Abstract:  A  large  extinction  ratio  optical  shutter  has  been  demonstrated 
using  electrowetting  liquids.  The  device  is  based  on  switching  between  a 
liquid-liquid  interface  curvature  that  produces  total  internal  reflection  and 
one  that  does  not.  The  interface  radius  of  curvature  can  be  tuned 
continuously from 9 mm at 0 V to −45 mm at 26 V. Extinction ratios from 
55.8  to  66.5  dB  were  measured.  The  device  shows  promise  for  ultracold 
chip-scale atomic clocks.

1. Introduction 
High  extinction  ratio  optical  shutters  are  important  for  atomic  clocks,  gyroscopes, 
communications, 
include 
integrated  lithium-niobate  electro-optic  modulators  [1],  acousto-optic  modulators  [2],  and 
mechanical  methods  based  on  diaphragms  or  blades  [3].  These  systems  provide  elegant 
solutions for many applications. However, integrated modulators suffer from limited aperture 
and  contrast  ratio,  acousto-optic  modulators  are  constrained  in  their  extinction  ratio  by 
scattering,  and  mechanical  methods  are  prone  to  friction  issues  and  long  term  wear.  An 
attractive alternative for applications requiring large extinction ratio without mechanical parts 
is  offered  by  liquid-based  optical  devices.  Liquids  have  well  defined  interfaces,  angstrom 
level  surface  roughness  [4],  optical  isotropy,  and  low  optical  loss.  A  variety  of  techniques 
exist for controlling liquids including electrowetting [5], dielectrophoresis [6], pressure driven 
elastic membranes [7], and hydrogels [8]. The electrowetting effect is appealing as it enables 
transmissive, compact devices with minimal voltage requirements and no mechanical parts. 
The  technique  has  been  used  to  demonstrate  lens  and  prism  arrays  for  displays,  imaging, 
tunable apertures and switches [5–16]. 

technologies 

Although there are previous demonstrations of electrowetting-based displays [9], tunable 
irises [10], and switches [11–14], high extinction ratio (beyond 30 dB) shutters have not been 
demonstrated. There are many implementations of these functionalities, using opaque ink or 
oil  droplets  [5,  9,  11],  tunable  irises,  and  liquid  interfaces  operating  around  total  internal 
reflection [14] (TIR). In contrast, the shutter reported here demonstrates 66 dB of extinction 
ratio and low voltage operation due to high quality materials and a unique geometry. To the 
best of our knowledge, this is the largest extinction ratio demonstrated by an electrowetting-
based total-internal-reflection device to date. 
2. Shutter design 
The optical shutter is based on the principle of electrowetting, in which the contact angle and 
shape of a liquid droplet or interface is controlled with an applied voltage. In this design, the 
curvature of the liquid interface allows the device to switch between total internal reflection 
and transmission, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The device consists of a sealed glass cylinder that is 
filled with two liquids, dodecane oil and water, and a prism to couple in the incident light at 
the  correct  angle.  The  sidewall  of  the  cylinder  has  a  thin  film  electrode  followed  by  a 
dielectric layer and a hydrophobic coating. The cylinder is thermally bonded with glass frit to 
a  glass  substrate,  with  a  platinum  bottom  electrode  placed  in  between  the  cylinder  and 
substrate. At 0 V, incoming light strikes the liquid interface at approximately 72°, 4 degrees 
beyond  the  water-oil  TIR  critical  angle  of  68°,  relative  to  the  surface  normal.  Electrically 
tuning the interface curvature causes incident light at an appropriate angle and offset from the 
center to cross this critical angle and switch between total internal reflection and transmission 
states.

photographs show a shutter device at 0 V with an initial lens radius of 9 mm and at 20 V with 
an infinite radius of curvature. 

 

3. Fabrication 
We implement the electrowetting shutter using a design that enables tuning of the curvature of 
an interface between polar (water with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) and non-polar (dodecane 
oil)  liquids.  A  diagram  of  the  device  is  shown  in  Fig.  1(a),  while  a  photo  of  a  fabricated 
device in operation is shown in Fig. 1(b). 

The fabrication steps of the liquid shutter device are illustrated in Fig. 2. Glass frit solution 
is  placed  on  the  rim  of  a  glass  tube  and  baked  at  400  °C  [Fig.  2(a)].  A  platinum  wire  is 
annealed  and  shaped  in  the  form  of  a  loop  and  serves  as  the  base  electrode.  The  wire  is 
aligned onto the glass base underneath the glass tube, with glass frit facing down toward the 
substrate.  The  tube  is  clamped  down  to  the  substrate  and  the  fixture  is  cured  at  550  °C  to 
allow the frit to bond the glass pieces together, resulting in a hermetic seal between the tube 
and base [Figs. 2(c)-2(d)]. 

The platinum wire and base of the tube are masked off, with Kapton tape on the outer tube 
shell and substrate and a Teflon plug inside the tube, before the sides of the tube are sputter-
coated with indium zinc oxide (IZO) to form a continuous film from the inside to the outside 
of the tube. IZO, an optically transparent conductor, is sputtered onto the sample at an argon 
pressure of 5 mTorr and power of 120 W to achieve a deposition thickness of 300 nm. The 
mean free path of the sputtered IZO in the argon at this pressure is an order of magnitude 
shorter  than  the  distance  between  target  and  substrate,  enabling  diffuse  sputtering  and  a 
conformal coating from inside to outside of the tube. 

Before depositing the thin film dielectric, the glass tube is cleaned and the exterior masked 
with  Kapton  tape  to  allow  electrode  contact  from  outside  the  tube  after  the  dielectric 
deposition. Parylene C is deposited in a vapor-phase, low-vacuum system by VSI Parylene to 
a thickness of 0.93 µm. The samples are then dip-coated in a 1:20 solution of Dupont’s Teflon 
AF 1600: Fluorinert FC-40 for the 100 nm hydrophobic coating. To cure the Teflon above its 
glass transition temperature of 165°C, the samples are heated in an oven at 120 °C for 10 min 
and  then  170 °C  for 20  min.  The  insets  in  Figs. 2(e)-2(f)  show  the  thin  film  layers  on  the 
device.

substrate. (b-d) A platinum wire is placed between the tube and substrate, and glass frit is used 
to bond the two together. (e) The substrate is masked with Kapton tape outside the tube and a 
Teflon plug inside the tube. The glass tube is coated with indium  zinc  oxide (IZO). (f) The 
assembled tubes are coated with Parylene dielectric (VSI Parylene) and finished inside with a 
dip coat of Teflon AF hydrophobic layer. 

 

The  devices  are  filled  with  a  1%  sodium  dodecyl  sulfate  (SDS,  Sigma-Aldrich)  in  DI 
water solution. In addition to reducing the surface tension between the polar liquid and oil, the 
SDS provides a large, negatively charged dodecyl sulfate ion, which cannot easily penetrate 
the Parylene layer when a positive DC voltage is applied to the sidewalls. The dodecane oil is 
then injected into the device to form the oil/water electrowetting-tunable interface. 
4. Results 
We  characterized  the  extinction  ratio,  the  contact  angle  as  a  function  of  voltage,  and  the 
response time. The response time and extinction ratio were measured using a 780 nm laser 
diode in the optical setup shown in Fig. 3. The laser diode is spatially filtered and focused to a 
250 μm diameter spot on the liquid interface, offset from the center of the device by 2-3 mm 
to optimize the incident light position for switching between transmission and total internal 
reflection.  In  the  case  of  the  transmitted  beam,  the  output  light  is  collimated  and  focused 
through two spatial filters of pinhole diameters of 100 and 75 μm. For the totally internally 
reflected beam, one 200 μm pinhole is used. Spatial filters were selected to provide maximum 
extinction ratio for both the transmitted and internally reflected states.

nm laser diode is spatially filtered and then focused by a long focal length lens to minimize 
spot  size  incident  on  the  liquid-liquid  interface.  The  correct  angle  of  incidence  is  achieved 
using  a  pair  of  mirrors.  Both  the  transmitted  and  totally  internally  reflected  beam  states  are 
then passed through respective spatial filters to photodetectors.

The extinction ratio was measured by collecting the light onto two silicon photodetectors 
that are connected to either an oscilloscope or a lock-in amplifier. The results of the extinction 
measurements are shown in Fig. 4(a). We measure an extinction ratio of 55.8 dB for the beam 
P
),  and  66.5  dB  for  the  beam  that 
that  is  transmitted  through  the  device  (
trans OV
).  This  is  currently  the  highest  extinction 
undergoes  total  internal  reflection  (
ratio measured from an electrowetting optical shutter to the best of our knowledge. A sharp 
change in the transmitted optical power can be seen in Fig. 4(a) at ~20 V. This behavior was 
also  observed  by  imaging  the  beam  with  a  camera  after  the  first  spatial  filter.  Due  to  the 
device  geometry,  reflections  and  sidewall  scattering  change  dramatically  as  a  function  of 
voltage (contact angle). Two spatial filters are sufficient to eliminate most of the undesirable 
changes. However, at 20 V, a local peak arises as a spurious beam passes through both spatial 
filters before being blocked at voltages greater than 20 V. This change can be mitigated by 
minimizing sidewall scattering and reflections with antireflection coatings and changes in the 
device geometry. MATLAB modeling of the device including secondary reflections can be 
seen in Fig. 4(b). The model qualitatively matches the shape of the experimental results and 
quantitatively  confirms  the  maximum  extinction  ratio  at  0  V  and  ~25  V  for  the  internally 
reflected beam. The model does not capture scattering, and so demonstrates lower minimum 
power  in  the  transmitted  branch.  At  ~24 V, no power  is  received  in  the  MATLAB model. 
Discrepancies between experiment and model may be attributable to error for the following 
reasons: (1) the 3D device is simplified into a 2D model, (2) many experimental parameters 
can only be estimated and the system is sensitive to small changes, and (3) the model does not 
include scattering.

The contact angle of the liquid interface was characterized by analyzing photographs of 
the device as a function of applied voltage. The resulting curvature of the liquid interface can 
be fit to the Lippmann-Young equation [17]. Figure 5 illustrates the contact angle vs. applied 
voltage. The shaded region indicates the region of reflection for an angle of incidence of the 
incident beam (relative to the liquid normal) that exceeds 68 degrees, the critical angle.

Fig.  5.  Contact  angle  vs.  voltage  of  curved  interface.  The  shaded  area  indicates  where  total 
internal reflection (TIR) can be achieved with our setup. The non-TIR region indicates where 
none of the incident beam is internally reflected. 

From 0 V to ~18 V, the device operates in the total internal reflection state, as seen in the 
shaded area of Fig. 5. This agrees well with the extinction measurements in Fig. 4(a); both the 
reflected  and  transmitted  beams  exhibit  relatively  small  changes  in  optical  power  until  the 
applied voltage exceeds ~18 V. As the device enters the non-TIR state, the reflected beam 
power drops sharply, followed by a rise in the transmitted power as the beam becomes aligned 
to the spatial filter system. The reflected beam power remains high until the ~18 V transition 
as some of the incident beam is internally reflected at this interval. However, the two spatial 
filter systems in the transmitted branch require very specific alignment to receive significant 
power, and it is not until the curvature has approached −45 mm radius that significant power 
is detected. 

The  system  response  time  was  measured  by  collecting  incident  power  vs.  time  on  the 
transmitted optical power detector in response to a 26 V step function. For 90% transmission, 
the overall response time of the system was measured to be 4.88 seconds. Simulation however 
suggests that the response time of the liquid interface is approximately 300 ms to achieve 95% 
curvature. The system is highly sensitive to small changes in the height and curvature of the 
liquid  interface  due  to  alignment  through  the  spatial  filters,  necessitating  a  much  longer 
settling  time  to  detect  appreciable  transmitted  power.  From  the  experimental  results,  the 
curvature of the interface must exceed 99% of the long-term curvature before we reach 90% 
optical  transmission,  and  the  low-velocity  of  the  liquid  near  this  steady  state  curvature 
increases the shutter response time. The application of spatial filters on the output beams is 
necessitated  by  the  scattering  produced via  sidewall  interaction,  however  the  use of  spatial 
filters  significantly  decreases  the  acceptance  angle  for  alignment  and  therefore  limits  the 
transmission state to above 99% curvature. If the scattering can be reduced, the spatial filters 
can be tuned to allow transmission for a wider range of curvatures. This will have significant 
effect  on  the  response  time  as  the  curvature  according  to  simulation  should  reach  95% 
curvature  a  full  order  of  magnitude  faster  than  99%  curvature.  Furthermore,  no  power 
oscillations were observed as the device approached maximum curvature, suggesting that the 
system  is  overdamped.  The  overall  response  time  is  therefore  limited  for  the  following 
reasons: (1) The system is highly sensitive to small changes in curvature (2) the device has a 
large liquid volume (3) the system is overdamped. By using a smaller device design in the 
future  and further reducing  scattering,  it  should  be possible  to  ensure  millisecond  response 
times from this shutter [15].

device  design  the  potential  for  higher  extinction  ratios  if  the  secondary  reflections  and 
sidewall interactions can be avoided. Future designs could mitigate the effects of secondary 
reflections and scattering by using anti-reflection coatings. Scattering effects can be mitigated 
with new geometries to avoid interaction with solid interfaces such as the coated sidewalls. 
Furthermore,  existing  electrowetting  prism  designs  [16]  can  further  reduce  the  effects  of 
secondary  reflections  and  scattering  by  altogether  avoiding  interaction  with  curved  liquid-
liquid interfaces, instead biasing the TIR state on a flat, angled liquid interface. This has the 
potential to further increase the extinction ratio. Future system response time may also benefit 
from biasing the device operation around the transition point of total internal reflection and 
transmission, taking advantage of the full extinction ratio while reducing necessary changes in 
contact angle. 
5. Conclusion 
In  summary,  we  have  demonstrated  a  high  extinction  ratio  optical  shutter  based  on  an 
electrowetting lens. The smooth interface between the liquids combined with operation based 
on total internal reflection enables a high extinction ratio of 55 and 66 dB for the transmitted 
and  reflected  beams,  respectively.  Future  designs  may  achieve  even  greater  extinction  by 
avoiding  sidewall  interaction  as  well  as  utilizing  new  geometries,  and  with  future 
miniaturization show promise for high speed shutter applications in atomic physics, displays, 
communications and imaging.
