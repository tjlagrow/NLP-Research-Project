Introduction

This short note provides a guide to using the ENTCS macro package for
preparing papers for publication in your conference Proceedings. The Pro-
ceedings may be printed and hard copies distributed to participants at the
meeting; this is an option to Conference Organizers may choose to exercise.
The Proceedings also will be par of a volume in the series Electronic Notes
in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS), which is published under the aus-
pices of Elsevier Science B. V., the publishers of Theoretical Computer Science.
It’s home page is http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs

The ENTCS macro package consists of two (cid:12)les:

entcs.cls, the basic style (cid:12)le, and

entcsmacro.sty, a macro (cid:12)le containing the de(cid:12)nitions of some of the theorem-

like environments and a few other tidbits.

The formatting these style (cid:12)les impose should not be altered { the reason for
using them is to attain a uniform format for all papers in the Proceedings of
which your paper is a part.

Additional macro (cid:12)les can be added using \usepackage{...}. The (cid:12)le
entcsmacro.sty must be included in the list, as is done at the start of the
source (cid:12)le for this paper.

The ENTCS package requires a relatively up-to-date LATEX system in order
to be successfully used. This is re(cid:13)ected in two other packages that are called
by entcs.cls, which must be available on your machine. These are:

(cid:15) The hyperref package. This package allows the use of hyperlinks in (cid:12)les
prepared using LATEX2e, one of the main features of Adobe’s Acrobat c(cid:13)
Reader software. Be sure that you have at least version 6.69d of this pack-
age.

(cid:15) The ifpdf package. This is used by hyperref to di(cid:11)erentiate between the

use of pdfLATEX and LATEX2e, followed by dvips and then ps2pdf.
The (cid:12)le instraut.dvi contains information about the use of LATEXto pre-
pare (cid:12)les for online publication by Elsevier. This (cid:12)le refers to the older version
of LATEX that is no longer suppported, and that is inadequate for preparing
.pdf (cid:12)les for online publication. Reading this (cid:12)le should answer most of the
basic questions about LATEX that might arise.

2 Frontmatter

The biggest di(cid:11)erence between a \usual" LATEX style such as article.sty
and the ENTCS package is that the ENTCS macro package requires the title,
author’s name or names, abstract, keywords and \thanks" all to be included
within the frontmatter environment. At the beginning of the source (cid:12)le for
this paper, you’ll notice this. Also, you’ll notice that the usual \maketitle
is absent; it no longer is needed. The ENTCS style package automatically
generates the title, author’s name and address, and related material at the
beginning of the paper. Note also that hyperref has been disabled in this part
of the entcs.cls (cid:12)le, so references to footnotes aren’t linked to the appropriate
footenotes or addresses. This is an old problem with LATEX, involving the fact
that the references within the frontmatter aren’t passed cleanly to the linking
software.

For those who have used the ENTCS package before, the one new thing
to note is the inclusion of Keywords; these are now required by Elsevier {
they’re also required by ACM’s Computing Reviews which reviews ENTCS
publications.

The ENTCS macro package provides two alternatives to listing authors
names and addresses. These are described in detail in the (cid:12)le instraut.dvi.

2

Please list Your Lastname Here

Basically, listing each author and his or her address in turn, is the simplest
method. But, if there are several authors and two or more share the same
address (but not all authors are at this address), then the method of listing
authors (cid:12)rst, and then the addresses, and of referencing addresses to authors
should be used.

Also, notice that acknowledgment of support (the contents of \thanks)
should be done by a separate listing of \thanks[NSF]{To the NSF} with the
optional argument { [NSF] { being used for \thanksref which is attached to
those authors acknowledging such support. It is important that the \thanks
not be included within the scope of \author{} or of \title{}, but it must
be within the scope of the environment frontmatter.

More details about added terms such as \collab can be found in inst.dvi,

if they are needed.

Also, notice that the command \lastname{My Lastname} has been in-
cluded before the frontmatter begins. This command should contain the
last names of the authors of the paper. If there are no more than three au-
thors, then they should be listed with the word \and" between the last two;
if more than three authors collaborated on the paper, then the (cid:12)rst author
only should be listed, together with \emph{et al}. This command creates
the headline for each page after page 1.

Finally, please be sure to include an abstract for your paper.

3 Sectioning and Environments

Since ENTCS is published through the auspices of Elsevier Science B. V., their
style (cid:12)les have been used to create the ENTCS macro package. Here’s a proof
that this package is not much di(cid:11)erent than most of the ones one encounters:

De(cid:12)nition 3.1 A (cid:12)le is derived from another if it is obtained with only a few
modi(cid:12)cations from the original (cid:12)le.

Theorem 3.2 The (cid:12)le entcs.cls is derived from elsart.sty.

Proof. This is clear from the similarity of the output to the output from
Elsevier’s style (cid:12)les.
2

If one wants to start a proof with a descriptive word, such as \sketch",

then one can use the \begin{proof*}...\end{proof*} environment, as in

Proof (Sketch) This can be derived from simple observations.

2

The main di(cid:11)erences between the (cid:12)le entcs.cls and the elsartr.cls (cid:12)le
used by Elsevier are the more precise format we use { Elsevier’s generic (cid:12)les are
meant for preliminary editing, and more precise formatting is imposed using
a macro (cid:12)le designed for the speci(cid:12)c Elsevier journal in which the paper will
eventually appear. The entcs.cls and entcsmacro.sty (cid:12)les format papers

uniformly so that they all are easily recognizable as being from the series
Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.

All of the usual features of LATEX are available with these style (cid:12)les {
it is only the formatting that has been rigorously de(cid:12)ned. Thus, one has
available the sectioning commands \section,\subsection, \paragraph and
\subparagraph. The numbering scheme used is one under which Theorem
1.2.3 is the third numbered item in second subsection of the (cid:12)rst section of
the paper. In order to facilitate cross-references, all of the named environments
given below are numbered, and all use the same number scheme.

The (cid:12)le entcsmacro.sty contains additional information that is needed to
typeset a paper. It also has the de(cid:12)nitions of the AMS euler and blackboard
bold fonts builtin. If you want to use symbols for the natural numbers, the
reals, etc., then we prefer that you use the blackboard bold fonts, and not
plain bold fonts. This is accomplished by using the \mathbb font, as in N or
R.

The names of theorem-like environments are provided in entcsmacro.sty.
With the exception of the environment Algorithm, the names of all of these
are full name, rather than a shortened version. The environments provided
and their names are

(cid:15) \begin{theorem} ... \end{theorem} for Theorems,

(cid:15) \begin{lemma} ... \end{lemma} for Lemmas,

4 References and Cross-references

All the cross-referencing facilities of LATEX are supported, so one can use
\ref{} and \cite{} for cross-references within the paper and for references
to bibliographic items. As is done in this note, the References section 6 can
be composed with \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}.
Alternatively, BibTEX can be used to compile the bibliography. Whichever
one is used, the references are to be numbered consecutively, rather than by
author-de(cid:12)ned acronyms. Of course you can use your own acronyms for easy
reference to each of the items in the bibliography, as has been done with the
listing for this short note.

However, note that the references should not be started with a new \section

command.

The package hyperref is automatically loaded by entcs.cls, and this makes
all the cross-references within the document \active" when the pdf (cid:12)le of the
paper is viewed with Adobe’s Acrobat c(cid:13) Reader. The format for including
a link is simple: simply insert \href{URL} {text} where URL is the URL
to which you want the link to point, and text is the text you want to be
highlighted, which when clicked upon will bring up the desired web page.

4.1 Particulars about .pdf (cid:12)les

We now require that .pdf (cid:12)les be provided for publication online. A .pdf
(cid:12)le is viewable by Adobe’s Acrobat c(cid:13) viewer, which can be con(cid:12)gured to load
automatically within a browser. Viewing a properly formatted .pdf (cid:12)le with
Acrobat c(cid:13) allows the cross-references and links to URLs to be active. In fact,
Elsevier utilizes .pdf (cid:12)les in order to take better advantage of the web’s ca-
pabilities.

But one point we want to emphasize is that you should be sure to use Type
1 fonts when you typeset your LATEX source (cid:12)le. These fonts are scalable,
meaning that they carry information that allows the devise viewing the (cid:12)nal
output to scale the fonts to suit the viewer being used { from an onscreen
viewer such as Adobe’s Acrobat c(cid:13) Reader, to printing the (cid:12)le on a printer.
You can tell if you have used the right fonts by viewing the (cid:12)nal output on
your machine. It the fonts look grainy, then you have not used Type 1 fonts.
They can be located at the CTAN archive http://www.ctan.org { they are
public domain fonts, and don’t cost anything to add them to your system.

Assuming you have Type 1 fonts available, then there are there methods

for producing .pdf (cid:12)les.

5

Please list Your Lastname Here

Using dvips and ps2pdf

We list this option (cid:12)rst since it appears to be the most reliable and the
easiest to use, especially if you include embedded PostScript graphics (.eps
(cid:12)les) in your source (cid:12)le. Simply run LATEX2e on your source (cid:12)le, then apply
dvips to produce a PostScript (cid:12)le, and (cid:12)nally apply ps2pdf to obtain a .pdf
(cid:12)le.

The DVIPDFM utility

Another easy method for producing acceptable .pdf (cid:12)les is via the utility
dvipdfm. This utility is included in distributions of MikTEX, which runs
on Windows machines, but it probably needs to be added to your teTEX
distribution, if you are running LATEX on a UNIX machine. The utility and
precise information about installing it on your system can be found at the
web page http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm/. In essence, this utility
converts a .dvi (cid:12)le into a .pdf (cid:12)le. So, one can (cid:12)rst prepare the .dvi (cid:12)le
using LATEX, and then apply the utility dvipdfm to produce the needed .pdf
(cid:12)le. 4 This utility makes inclusion of graphics particularly simple { those that
are included in the LATEX source (cid:12)le are simply converted to the .pdf format.
As we note below, things are not so simple with the second alternative, which
is to use pdfLATEX.

pdfLATEX

An alternative to the (cid:12)rst possibilities to produce .pdf (cid:12)les is to process
the source (cid:12)le with pdfLATEX. This format is available from the standard
CTAN sites http://www.ctan.org. It appears that pdfLATEX and hyperref

have some problems when used together.
version 14d or later in order to minimize these issues.
If your system has
an earlier version (most teTEX distributions have version 13d), then you
can update your system by retrieving the latest version of pdfLATEX from
ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/cstug/thanh/pdftex/ . Even if the
recent versions are used, pdfLATEX has the same dealing with references em-
bedded with the frontmatter section described above for LATEX.

But there is one aspect of pdfLATEX that creates problems. Many authors
include EPS 5 (cid:12)les within their papers. While this is fairly straightforward
with LATEX, there are a couple of points to note when attempting this with
pdfLATEX.

To include a PostScript image in a .pdf (cid:12)le produced with pdfLATEX,
you (cid:12)rst have to convert the image to a .pdf (cid:12)le, and then it can be in-
cluded using the same command sequence as above. The conversion can be

4 Beware! The utility dvipdf does not produce acceptable .pdf (cid:12)les, and should not be
used. Only dvipdfm should be used to produce .pdf (cid:12)les.
5 EPS stands for embedded PostScript, which a(cid:11)ords a mechanism for including pre-
prepared PostScript (cid:12)les within a LATEX document.

accomplished most easily using Ghostscript; you can simply view the (cid:12)le in
Ghostview and then print the image to a .pdf (cid:12)le using the pdfwriter option
within Ghostview. The result for a standard chess board that is part of the
Ghostview distribution is the following image:

Here as well is a copy of a color image. While pdfLATEX can handle image (cid:12)les
in other formats, LATEX can only handle .eps images reliably.

It also should be noted that we have included two separate source (cid:12)les for
this example (cid:12)le { one for LATEX and one for pdfLATEX { because we want

7

Please list Your Lastname Here

to illustrate how to insert graphics images into the (cid:12)le. If your paper does
not include such images, then the same source (cid:12)le can be formatted by either
LATEX orf by pdfLATEX.

Using ENTCS Macros with Mac OS X

Of course, if your (cid:12)le doesn’t require .eps or other PostScript (cid:12)les, then
you can create the required .pdf (cid:12)le using any of the standard TEX imple-
mentations for the Macintosh. If you need to include PostScript (cid:12)les, and if
you are using TEXShop, then you can specify to use dvips and ghostview in
processing your (cid:12)le, and then you can apply ps2pdf to create the needed .pdf
(cid:12)le. Alternatibely, the Mac OS X operating system is based on UNIX, so it
supports the use of teTEX as described above.

5 Summary

The ENTCS macro package is relatively easy to use and provides a uniform
layout for all the papers that appear in ENTCS.

Problem 5.1 Finish your paper and get it to your Program Chairman on
time!

When you have (cid:12)nished preparing your paper, send a copy of the source (cid:12)le,
together with any macro (cid:12)les that are needed to your Program Chairman. If
the (cid:12)les are extensive, you can place copies in the pub/incoming sub-directory
of the ftp directory on the machine indicated by your Program Chairman using
anonymous ftp. If you do this, please send me email to alert me that the (cid:12)le(s)
are here.

Assigning Volume / Issue Numbers

One additional point worth mentioning is that ENTCS is moving to Sci-
enceDirect, Elsevier’s main platform for publishing electronic series, Because
ScienceDirect must publish entire volumes at the same time, we have changed
the procedure for preparing (cid:12)nal versions so that volume numbers will not
be assigned until the (cid:12)nal versions are ready. Guest Editors will now have
to receive the (cid:12)nal version of all papers in their Proceedings before a volume
and issue number will be assigned for the Proceedings. Even with the move to
ScienceDirect, the reference scheme already used for publications in ENTCS {
http://www.elsevier/nl/locate/entcs/ NNnn.html remains the valid way
to cite papers published in ENTCS, where NN denotes the number of the vol-
ume, and nn denotes the issue number. Publications consisting of an entire
volume should use 1 as the issue number.

Copyright Transfer Forms

One result of the move to ScienceDirect is that the corresponding author
of each paper published in ENTCS must submit a signed Copyright Transfer

8

Please list Your Lastname Here

Form to Elsevier in order for their paper to be published. A copy of this form
will be sent to each author by the Guest Editors of each volume. Details about
this agreement specifying the rights of the authors and the rights of Elsevier
are available at Elsevier’s Author Gateway.

Publication of Final Versions

Because ScienceDirect cannot easily accommodate changes to published
material, the Proceedings in its entirety must be ready before it can be pub-
lished. This is one reason why the volume and issue number is not assigned
until the (cid:12)nal versions of all papers have been sent to the Guest Editors for
(cid:12)nal processing.

6 Bibliographical references

ENTCS employs the plain style of bibliographic references in which references
are listed in alphabetical order, according the the (cid:12)rst author’s last name, and
are sequentially numbered. Please utilize this style. We have a BibTEX style
(cid:12)le, for those who wish to use it. It is the (cid:12)le entcs.bst which is included in
this package. The basic rules we have employed are the following:

(cid:15) Authors’ names should be listed in alphabetical order, with the (cid:12)rst author’s
last name being the (cid:12)rst listing, followed by the author’s initials or (cid:12)rst
name, and with the other authors names listed as (cid:12)rst name, last name.

(cid:15) Titles of articles in journals should be in emphasized type.

(cid:15) Titles of books, monographs, etc. should be in quotations.

(cid:15) Journal names should be in plain roman type.

(cid:15) Journal volume numbers should be in boldface type, with the year of pub-
lication immediately following in roman type, and enclosed in parentheses.

(cid:15) References to URLs on the net should be \active" and the URL itself should

be in typewriter font.

(cid:15) Articles should include page numbers.

The criteria are illustrated in the following.
