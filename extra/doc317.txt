ABSTRACT
We present a systematic study for ionization state of inter-stellar medium in
galaxies at z  0  3 with  140 000 SDSS galaxies and 108 intermediate to high
redshift galaxies from the literature using an ionization-parameter sensitive line ratio
of O iii5007O ii3727 and photoionization models We conrm that z  2  3
galaxies show an O iiiO ii ratio signicantly higher than a typical star-forming
galaxy of SDSS by a factor of  10 and the photoionization models reveal that these
high-z galaxies have an ionization parameter of logqioncm s1  76  90 a factor
of  4  10 higher than local galaxies For galaxies at any redshift we identify a cor-
relation between the O iiiO ii ratio and galaxy global properties of star-formation
rate SFR stellar mass M and metallicity Z We extend the fundamental metal-
licity relation FMR and develop the fundamental ionization relation FIR a four-
dimensional relation of ionization parameter SFR M and Z The intermediate and
high-z galaxies up to z  3 follow the FIR dened with the local galaxies in con-
trast with the FMR whose possible evolution from z  2 to 3 is reported We nd
that the FMR evolution of z  2  3 appears if one omits ionization parameter dier-
ences and that the FMR evolution does not exist for an average metallicity solution of
z  3 galaxies with a high-ionization parameter Interestingly all of two local Lyman-
continuum emitting galaxies LyC leakers have a high O iiiO ii ratio indicating
a positive correlation between O iiiO ii and ionizing photon escape fraction fesc
which is successfully explained by our photoionization models Because O iiiO ii
ratios of z  2  3 galaxies especially Ly emitters LAEs are comparable to or
higher than those of the local LyC leakers these high-z galaxies are candidates of
Lyman-continuum emitting objects A strong Ly emission can coexist with a large
fesc of  08 and the increasing fraction of LAEs towards high-z reconciles the pic-
ture of cosmic reionization whose major ionizing sources are faint galaxies having
intrinsically-bright Ly emission

INTRODUCTION
For galaxy formation studies it is essential to understand
physical conditions of inter-stellar medium ISM of galax-

gas-phase metallicity and ionization parameter A gas-phase
metallicity is a record of galaxys star formation history
and gas infalloutow and is commonly dened by oxygen

made with metal

Metallicities of galaxies have been well studied in the
local and high-z universe in the diagram of stellar-mass
vs metallicity MZ relation In the local universe a
tight MZ relation is recognized where a metallicity in-
creases with stellar mass eg Tremonti et al 2004 At
high-z similar MZ relations are reported at z  05  35
eg Savaglio et al 2005 Erb et al 2006 Maiolino et al
2008 Mannucci et al 2009 Zahid et al 2011 Yabe et al
2012 These studies nd the evolution of MZ rela-
tion a metallicity decreases towards high-z at a given
M Recently Mannucci et al 2010 and Lara-Lopez et al
2010 identify that the MZ relation depends on star
formation rate SFR which is initially suggested by
Ellison et al 2008 and propose the fundamental metallic-
ity relation FMR that forms a single plane in the stellar-
mass metallicity and SFR space The FMR holds over
z  0  25 with no evolution This would indicate that
there are physical processes commonly found in local and
high-z galaxies Many follow-up studies test the univer-
sality of the FMR over the wide range of stellar mass
SFR and redshifts eg Mannucci et al 2011 Richard et al
2011 Nakajima et al 2012 Niino 2012 Yabe et al 2012
Cresci et al 2012 Wuyts et al 2012 Christensen et al
2012a Belli et al 2013 Lara-Lopez et al 2013 Although
galaxies at z  25 follow the FMR galaxies at z 
3 appear to fall below the FMR Mannucci et al 2010
Mannucci et al 2010 claim that this disagreement sug-
gests that there are physical mechanisms dierent from those
of low-z galaxies at z  3 However this is still an open ques-
In contrast to metallicities
ionization parameters of
galaxies are poorly understood Recently Nakajima et al
2013 use a diagram of O iiiO ii ratio and R23-index to
study ionization parameters and metallicities for galaxies at
z  03 focusing on the properties of Ly emitters LAEs
at z  2 Nakajima et al 2013 report that a typical ion-
ization parameter increases towards high-z and suggest the
evolution of ionization parameter see also Lilly et al 2003
Hainline et al 2009 Richard et al 2011 However until re-
cently statistical studies for ionization parameters do not
cover i physical relations between ionization parameter
and galaxy global properties such as stellar mass and SFR
and ii evolution of the physical relations with ionization
parameter Dopita et al 2006a present that in the local
universe an ionization parameter seems to gradually de-
crease with M but do not address the issue about evolution
of this trend see also Brinchmann et al 2008
There is another diagnostics of ionization parameter
using a plot of N iiH and O iiiH ratios that is re-
ferred to as the BPT diagram Baldwin et al 1981 Lo-
cal star-forming galaxies form a tight sequence on the
BPT diagram eg Kaumann et al 2003a In contrast
high-z galaxies depart from the local star-forming se-
quence towards higher O iiiH ratio eg Shapley et al
2005 Erb et al 2006 Liu et al 2008 Hainline et al 2009
Finkelstein et al 2009 Yabe et al 2012 Similarly recent
spectroscopic surveys report that high-z galaxies on average
have O iiiH ratios much higher than local similar mass
galaxies Cullen et al 2014 Holden et al 2014 One inter-
pretation of that departure is evolution of ionization param-
eter eg Brinchmann et al 2008 Kewley et al 2013ab
Kewley et al 2013a have compared high-z galaxy line ra-
tios and theoretical predictions to investigate evolution of
the star-forming sequence on the BPT diagram and claimed
that high-z galaxies would have a larger ionization param-
eter a higher electron density andor a harder ionizing ra-
diation eld see also Brinchmann et al 2008 Kewley et al
2013b Shirazi et al 2013 have also argued a possibility
that the typical gas density of H ii-regions would be much
higher in high-z galaxies
Ionization parameters are also important for accurate
estimates of metallicity from nebular emission lines Metal-
licity estimation methods based on local empirical relations
eg Maiolino et al 2008 are often applied to high-z galax-
ies These methods implicitly assume ionization parameters
of typical local galaxies Since various studies suggest that
ionization parameter evolves with redshift the estimated
metallicities from local empirical relations would be biased
Recently a relationship between ionization parame-
ionizing photons fesc and
ter and escape fraction of
importance for cosmic reionization are discussed
Nakajima et al 2013 have pointed out a possibility that
fesc positively correlates with ionization parameter since
an optically-thin nebula could show a high O iiiO ii ra-
tio eg Giammanco et al 2005 Brinchmann et al 2008
Kewley et al 2013b If this correlation of ionization pa-
rameter and fesc is established ionization parameters al-
low us to investigate ionizing photon escapes that cannot
be directly observed for galaxies at the epoch of reioniza-
tion z  6 Fan et al 2006 Dunkley et al 2009 Studies
of galaxies at z  6  7 have identied a tension between
the ionizing photon production rate and cosmic reionization
eg Ouchi et al 2009 Robertson et al 2010 A moder-
ately high average fesc of  02 would be required for galax-
ies in the early universe to keep the inter-galactic medium
IGM ionized Nakajima et al 2013 have suggested that
LAEs exhibit higher ionization parameters than other high-
z galaxy populations such as Lyman-break galaxies LBGs
Because observations reveal that a fraction of LAEs to
star-forming galaxies of LBGs increases with redshift eg
Ouchi et al 2008 Vanzella et al 2009 Stark et al 2010
2011 more LAEs with a high ionization parameter ie
a high fesc would ease the tension of the decit of ioniz-
ing photons at the early universe However the claim of
Nakajima et al 2013 is made only with two LAEs and it is
unclear whether this is a general feature of LAEs One needs
to i investigate the trend that LAEs typically show an ion-
ization parameter higher than LBGs and ii understand the
physical reason of the correlation between ionization param-
eter and fesc with theoretical models Although predicting
fesc is challenging by using simulations or theoretical models
due to the large uncertainties in the assumptions about the
ISM and the limited resolutions eg Rahmati et al 2013
we investigate the correlation with photoionization models
assuming a simple homogeneous gas cloud as the rst step
This paper is organized as follows We describe our
samples of galaxies in Section 2 and test the main sam-
ple of SDSS in Section 3 In Section 4 we show all of our
galaxies in the O iiiO ii vs R23-index diagram and in-
vestigate galaxy properties in the diagram with the aid of
photoionization models We then clarify the dependencies
of ionization parameter on galaxy global properties of stel-
lar mass SFR and metallicities We introduce a new re-
lation named fundamental ionization relation FIR that
is described in the four-dimensional parameter space of
O iiiO ii ratio R23-index stellar mass and SFR We
discuss these observational results in Section 5 addressing
the issues of i the evolution of ionization parameter ii
the FMR evolution at z  3 iii the relations between
O iiiO ii ratio R23-index stellar mass and SFR and
iv the correlation between ionization parameter and fesc
Finally we summarize our results in Section 6 Throughout
this paper we estimate stellar masses and SFRs based on a
Chabrier 2003 initial mass function IMF and assume an
Asplund et al 2009 solar metallicity where logZZ

2 Although Brinchmann et al 2004 recommend that requiring
SN  3 in all four BPT diagram lines is useful we do not adopt
the criteria because the requirement could bias the sample re-
garding metallicity Indeed the criteria of SN ratio of H  25
is strong enough to remove lots of galaxies with low-SN emis-
sion lines in the sample By imposing SN ratios of all four BPT
diagram lines  3 the sample size decreases to  120 000 Nev-
ertheless we have checked that our main results do not depend
signicantly on the criteria In order to fairly compare with the
FMR of Mannucci et al 2010 we do not impose the require-
ment of SN ratios for the BPT diagram

curve given by Cardelli et al 1989 SFRs are estimated
from the H luminosities by using the Kennicutt 1998s
relation and total stellar masses from the broadband pho-
tometry All of the SFRs and stellar masses are corrected to
the Chabrier 2003 IMF We remove the same objects in
the catalog that are found by the MPAJHU group We
thus obtain 136 067 SDSS galaxies
In this sample we highlight two populations of galaxies
shown below
 Green Pea galaxies GPs Cardamone et al 2009 that
are local star-forming galaxies with a very strong O iii emis-
sion line whose EW is  1000 A They are found in the SDSS
spectroscopic sample of galaxies with green colors in the
SDSS gri composite images where the strong O iii emis-
sion fall in the r band Because the strong O iii emission
has to be redshifted to the bandpass of r the redshift of
GPs ranges from 0112 to 0360 We use 80 GPs given by
Cardamone et al 2009 that are free from AGN contami-
nation We cross-match the 80 GPs to our SDSS galaxies
and identify 51 GPs To include GPs at z  030 we per-
form the same cross-matching to SDSS galaxies that do not
meet the redshift criterion of 1 and obtain additional 15
GPs at z  03 We use a total of 66  51  15 GPs in our
analysis
 Lyman Break Analogs LBAs Heckman et al 2005
Hoopes et al 2007 Basu-Zych et al 2007 Overzier et al
2008 2009 that are super-compact UV-luminous local
galaxies whose characteristics are similar to those of high-
z LBGs The UV imaging survey performed by the Galaxy
Evolution Explorer GALEX is used to select star-forming
galaxies at 01  z  03 with a high luminosity of
LFUV  10103 L and a high far UV surface brightness of
IFUV  109 L kpc2 We compile catalogs of Hoopes et al
2007 Basu-Zych et al 2007 and Overzier et al 2009
and obtain 51 LBAs Cross-matching them to our SDSS
galaxies and removing AGN candidates we make an LBA
sample composed of 37 LBAs
We remove sources in our GP and LBA samples from our
SDSS galaxies and dene a sample of SDSS galaxies with
no GPs and LBAs as SDSS sample
212 LyC leakers
There are two local star-forming galaxies emitting Lyman-
continuum LyC radiation Haro 11 Bergvall et al 2006
Leitet et al 2011 and Tol 1247-232 Leitet et al 2013
They are initially selected as blue compact galaxies or H ii
galaxies and found to leak LyC radiation from the Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer FUSE data In order
to study the relation between ionization state and ionizing
photon escape we investigate the two LyC leaking galax-
ies Hereafter we refer to these two galaxies as LyC leak-
ers Emission line uxes for Haro 11 and Tol 1247-232 are
obtained from Bergvall  Ostlin 2002 and Terlevich et al
1993 respectively and stellar masses from Leitet et al
2013 Their SFRs are derived in the same manner as those
of our SDSS galaxies Section 211 Neither of them is con-
taminated by AGN Leitet et al 2013 We note that Haro
11 can be classied as an LBA Heckman et al 2011

best-t of our SDSS sample while the black dotted curve is the original FMR obtained by Mannucci et al 2010 and Mannucci et al

22 Intermediate and High Redshift galaxies
We make samples of intermediate- and high-z galaxies that
have rm estimates of stellar mass and spectroscopic mea-
surements of nebular emission lines hydrogen Balmer lines
O ii O iii We particularly include strongly lensed galax-
ies BXBM galaxies LBGs and LAEs
 Intermediate redshift galaxy sample z  05  15
is composed of 24 galaxies from the Gemini Deep Deep
Survey GDDS and 15 galaxies from the Canada-France
Redshift Survey CFRS Savaglio et al 2005 Maier et al
2005 Moreover we add 26 low-mass galaxies recently re-
ported by Henry et al 2013 and 4 strongly lensed galaxies
Christensen et al 2012a Queyrel et al 2009 to the sam-
ple In total the intermediate-z sample contains 69 galaxies
 High redshift galaxy sample z  2  3 con-
sists of 39 galaxies in total 21 strongly lensed galaxies
Pettini et al 2001 Fosbury et al 2003 Richard et al 2011

2012 Belli et al 2013 two LAEs Nakajima et al 2013
one metal-poor BX galaxy Erb et al 2010 and 15 LBGs
from the AMAZE and LSD projects Maiolino et al 2008
Mannucci et al 2009
We use a total of 108  69  39 intermediate- and high-z
galaxies in our analysis
We divide the high-z galaxy sample into two subsam-
ples LAE and LBG samples to investigate the relation-
ship between ionization state and Ly photon escape For
high-z galaxies with a Ly ux measurement we clas-
sify galaxies with EWrest Ly  20 A as LAE Lynx
arc Fosbury et al 2003 BX418 Erb et al 2010 Abell
1689 311 arc and SMACS J2031 arc Christensen et al
2012ab We include the two narrow-band selected LAEs
CDFS-3865 and COSMOS-30679 Nakajima et al 2013 to
the LAE sample For high-z galaxies with EWrest Ly 
20 A or no Ly ux measurement we regard these galaxies
as LBGs for simplication given the observational fact that
continuum-selected galaxies on average have an EW of Ly
 0 A eg Shapley et al 2003 Kornei et al 2010 Indeed
most of the z  3 galaxies in the sample of Maiolino et al
2008 are originally spectroscopically-conrmed based on
rest-frame UV absorption lines not Ly emission line see
also Vanzella et al 2006
We derive physical quantities for these intermediate-
and high-z galaxies with the same procedures as those for
our SDSS galaxies Emission line uxes are corrected for
extinction with HH and the extinction curve given
by Calzetti et al 2000 For galaxies with no H or H
measurement we correct for extinction estimated from
spectral energy distribution SED tting assuming that
the amount of extinction is the same in continuum and
emission lines For galaxies neither with HH nor dust
extinction from SED tting5 we adopt dust extinction
inferred from stellar mass based on the empirical relation
Gilbank et al 2010 SFRs are estimated from a hydrogen
recombination line of H or H corrected for dust extinction
with the Kennicutt 1998s relation If O iii4959 uxes
are not available in the literature6 we assume a value of
028 for the O iii49595007 ratio Richard et al 2011
We have conrmed that this assumption does not aect
our results signicantly We estimate intrinsic SFRs and
stellar masses using lens magnication factors for the
strongly lensed galaxies We place the lower upper limits
on the SFR and stellar mass of SGAS1527 SGAS1226
that only has the upper lower limit of the magnication
factor Wuyts et al 2012 We adopt the lower limit of
stellar mass given by Villar-Martn et al 2004 for Lynx
arc Fosbury et al 2003 For high-z galaxies with no
O ii detections
Fosbury et al 2003 Erb et al 2010
Richard et al 2011 we apply 3 upper-limit uxes of O ii
for the lower limits of O iiiO ii while we approximate
R23-indices under the assumption of no signicant O ii
ux Using the BPT diagram we have identied no obvious
AGN activity in the high-z galaxies
We note
that all
the local
intermediate-z and high-z galaxies used in this paper are
the properties

3 TESTING FMR WITH OUR SDSS SAMPLE
Before we present our analysis results we test whether
our SDSS sample reproduces the FMR Mannucci et al
2010 For this purpose we derive metallicities based on the
Maiolino et als 2008 empirical relations as adopted by
Mannucci et al 2010 Section 211 It should be noted
that our main discussion is based on metallicities derived
with ionization parameter from the photoionization mod-
els of Kewley  Dopita 2002 eg Section 43 In Figure
1 three panels from left to right show the M-metallicity
SFR-metallicity and 032-metallicity plots with our SDSS
sample The variable  is dened as a combination of M
and SFR
  logM   logSFR
where  is a free parameter Mannucci et al 2010 obtain
  032 that minimizes the scatter of their SDSS galaxies
in the -metallicity plane The colored lines in each panel
represent a mean metallicity of our SDSS galaxies for sub-
samples dened with SFR left and right panels and M
center panel in a 015 dex range We display subsamples
containing  50 galaxies
In the right panel of Figure 1 the solid black curve
indicates the quadratic best-t of our SDSS sample while
the dotted curve presents the original FMR Mannucci et al
2010 2011 The original FMR is expressed by a combi-
nation of a linear and a 4th-order polynomial functions
Mannucci et al 2011 From this plot the FMR of our
SDSS sample is almost identical to that of Mannucci et al
2010 2011 Therefore we conclude that our SDSS sample
successfully reproduces the original FMR of Mannucci et al
20107

The underlying gray dots are the SDSS galaxies Figure

a higher O iiiO ii ratio The red and blue diamonds
denote z  2  3 LAEs and LBGs respectively Compared
to the SDSS galaxies these high-z galaxies clearly present
an O iiiO ii ratio higher than most of galaxies by a
factor of  10 The majority of z  1 galaxies the gray
triangles are placed at the middle between the SDSS
galaxies and the z  2  3 LBGs LBGs at z  3 blue
diamonds with a circle have an O iiiO ii ratio higher
than those at z  3 on average In Figure 2 LAEs have
the highest O iiiO ii ratio This trend is rst claimed by
Nakajima et al 2013 but we conrm this trend with our
LAE and LBG samples signicantly larger than those used
in Nakajima et al 2013 The two local galaxies of GPs
green open circles and LBAs purple circles are placed
near the high-z galaxies These galaxies present the highest
R23-index and O iiiO ii ratio among the local galaxies
Interestingly the LyC leakers orange pentagons have
values of O iiiO ii ratio and R23-index similar to those
of GPs LBAs and high-z galaxies It should be noted that
some LAEs have a remarkably high O iiiO ii ratio that
cannot be found in the local galaxies
42 Physical Origin of Large O iiiO ii ratio
We investigate the physical origin of large O iiiO ii ratios
found in Section 41 using photoionization models There
are ve physical parameters of nebulae that change the
O iiiO ii ratio a spectral shape of ionizing source b
gas temperature c metallicity d ionization parameter and
e gas density First if the incident ionizing source includes
an AGN whose spectrum is hard high-ionization lines are
stronger than low-ionization lines However since our sam-
ples are free from a signicant AGN contamination Sec-
tion 211 the ionizing source dierence does not signif-
icantly change the O iiiO ii ratio Second gas temper-
ature changes the emissivity of O iii and O ii lines Gas
temperature is determined by the metal abundance because
coolings are dominated by collisionally excited metal ions
such as O O2 N etc We simply regard metallicity as a
control parameter of temperature and investigate the tem-
perature dependence on the basis of gas metallicity Thus
there are three key parameters metallicity ionization pa-
rameter and gas density that aect the O iiiO ii ratio
In Figure 2 we plot the photoionization models given
by Kewley  Dopita 2002 with the black curves The mod-
els predict line ratios at a given metallicity and ionization
parameter with a xed gas pressure8 of Pk  105 cm3 K
assuming isobaric conditions The models in Figure 2 indi-
cate that the O iiiO ii ratio and R23-index depend on
metallicity and ionization parameter
The models of Figure 2 present three important trends
on the O iiiO ii vs R23-index diagram
1 O iiiO ii ratio increases with ionization parameter
2 O iiiO ii ratio decreases with metallicity
8 For electron temperatures of 104 K This pressure corresponds
to a density of order 10 cm3
3 R23-index increases in a low-metallicity regime low-
Z branch from 12  logOH  75 to  85 and de-
creases in a high-metallicity regime high-Z branch from
12  logOH  85 towards a higher metallicity
The trend of 1 is explained by the boost of high-energy ion-
izing photons as the ionization parameter increases Such
high-energy photons produce more abundant O iii The
trend of 2 is caused by a decrease of gas temperature
in an H ii-region As gas metallicity increases gas temper-
ature drops due to cooling of metal lines For gas clouds
with high metallicity the far-infrared ne-structure cooling
of O2 is more ecient than those in optical wavelength
eg Charlot  Longhetti 2001 Dopita et al 2000 Thus
in optical wavelength O iii emission becomes faint while
O ii emission does not change dramatically which makes a
decrease of O iiiO ii ratio to a higher metallicity Simi-
larly the trend of 3 in the high-Z branch of 12  logOH
 85 is explained by the weak optical O iiiO ii emis-
sion with more dominant far-infrared ne-structure cooling
Thus the R23-index decreases with metallicity On the other
hand in the low-Z branch of 12  logOH  85 optical
collisional excitation lines including O iii and O ii are the
most ecient cooling radiation R23-index increases as oxy-
gen abundance ie metallicity increases To summarize
the O iiiO ii ratio depends strongly on ionization param-
eter and moderately on metallicity R23-index is mainly gov-
erned by metallicity but also depends albeit weakly on ion-
ization parameter
In addition to metallicity and ionization parameter
emission line ratios would be changed by gas density In fact
the recent study of Shirazi et al 2013 argues that a high
gas density would be an origin of the large O iiiO ii ratio
of high-z galaxies This argument is based on the following
ideas The ionization parameter is dened by
where QH0 is the number of hydrogen ionizing photons per
second Rs is the Stromgren radius and nH is the total hy-
drogen density The hydrogen ionizing photon production
rate of QH0 is balanced by a recombination rate under the
assumption of ionization equilibrium
HB
where B is a coecient of the total hydrogen recombination
to the n  1 levels and  is the volume lling factor of the
ionized gas The combination of Equations 2 and 3 yields
ion  QH0 nH 2
see also Charlot  Longhetti 2001 Shirazi et al 2013 By
the comparison with low and high redshift galaxies with
similar M and specic SFR and thus with similar metal-
licity under the assumption of the FMR being in place
Shirazi et al 2013 have found that the high-z galaxies
show an O iiiO ii ratio higher than low-z counterparts
by  05 dex indicating that high-z galaxies have a higher
qion than the low-z counterparts by  03 dex Based on
Equation 4 Shirazi et al 2013 have argued that nH in-
creases by a factor of  8 to high-z assuming that high-z
galaxies and their low-z counterparts have similar QH0 and
 values Indeed Shirazi et al 2013 have conrmed that
high-z galaxies tend to have a high electron density which
is measured directly from emission lines
Because ionization parameter is determined by QH0 
nH and  Equation 4 ionization parameter is a funda-
mental parameter of photoionization models which allows
the potential evolutions of nH QH0  and  The assumption
of no evolution of IMF would also be an open question eg
Dave 2008 Narayanan  Dave 2013 Therefore we inter-
pret the O iiiO ii ratio as a function of ionization param-
eter and metallicity in this paper Hereafter we study the
relation between O iiiO ii ratio and R23-index with var-
ious ionization parameters and metallicities in the following
analysis
43 Interpretation of the O iiiO ii and
R23-index Relation
In this section we evaluate the average values of our galax-
ionization parameter and metallicity that are sensi-
tive to O iiiO ii ratio and R23-index measurements
using the method given by Kobulnicky  Kewley 2004

sponds to a metallicity value in the low-Z high-Z branch
of metallicity We use dust-corrected O iiiO ii ratio and
R23-index Note that without other metallicity indicators
this method does not provide a single solution but multiple
solutions from low-Z and high-Z branches The demarca-
tion metallicity between the two branches is 12  logOH
 84 We use Equations 57 to estimate a metallic-
ity and ionization parameter iteratively until the metallicity
converges We evaluate errors of metallicity and ionization
parameter by Monte Carlo simulations For each galaxy sam-
ple we obtain the average values of R23-index O iiiO ii
ratio and their uncertainties We assume that for each of the
ux ratios the probability distribution of the true value is
a Gaussian with its sigma equal to the observed uncertainty
in the ux ratio We randomly select a set of R23-index and
O iiiO ii ratio following these Gaussian probability dis-
tributions and calculate metallicity and ionization parame-
ter with the set of R23-index and O iiiO ii ratio based on
Equations 57 We repeat the process 500 times and de-

ne one sigma errors of metallicity and ionization parameter
by the 68 percentile of the distribution
The estimated values are summarized in Table 1 and
shown in Figure 3 We list the ranges of values in both
the high-Z and low-Z branches for the intermediate and
high-z galaxy samples but for the local galaxy samples For
the SDSS sample only the values in the high-Z branch are
given since the average metallicity for the low-Z branch
12  logOH  77  81 is signicantly lower than that
estimated with R23-index and N 2-index Figure 1 We
have checked that the SDSS high-Z branch metallicity of
12  logOH  892  912 Table 1 is consistent with our
estimate in Section 3 as well as those estimated in previous
studies eg Tremonti et al 2004 Mannucci et al 2010
For GPs LBAs and LyC leakers we calculate the metallic-
ities and ionization parameters for individual objects whose
two-branch solutions are distinguished by other metallicity
indicators of gas temperature andor N 2-index see also Sec-
tion 52 Their 68 percentile of the distributions are listed
in Table 1 and shown in Figure 3
Although only weak constraints are placed on metal-
licity due to the degeneracy of the two branch solutions
the dierence of ionization parameters between galaxy sam-
ples is clearly found in Figure 3 The SDSS galaxies have
the average value of logqioncm s1  73 see also eg
Dopita et al 2006a In contrast high-z galaxies have an
ionization parameter of logqioncm s1  76  90 High-z
LBGs have an ionization parameter higher than the SDSS
8 K Nakajima  M Ouchi
galaxies by a factor of  4 and high-z LAEs show the high-
est ionization parameter among the galaxy samples which
is about an order of magnitude higher than the SDSS galax-
ies In the local galaxies GPs and the LyC leakers exhibit
ionization parameters much higher than the SDSS galaxies
Similarly the ionization parameter of LBAs is high These
extreme local populations of GPs LyC leakers and LBAs
have an ionization parameter as high as LBGs and LAEs at
high redshifts Moreover the ionization parameter of GPs
is comparable to that of LAEs In this sense GPs could be
local counterparts of high-z LAEs
Figure 2 suggests that there is a variation of ioniza-
tion parameter in the SDSS sample In fact the SDSS
galaxy distribution sequence departs from the model curve
of  2  107 cm s1 In the large R23-index regime we rec-
ognize the slope of the SDSS galaxy sequence steeper than
that of the photoionization model predictions This trend in-
dicates that galaxies with a low metallicity of 12  logOH
 85 have a high ionization parameter eg Dopita et al
2006a Nagao et al 2006 If the MZ relation is in place
eg Tremonti et al 2004 this would imply that low-M
galaxies have a high ionization parameter We examine the
possible dependencies of M and other galaxy global prop-
erties on ionization parameters in Sections 44 and 45 Simi-
larly the important characteristics can be found in the small
R23-index regime The sequence of SDSS galaxies presents
an upturn from high to low R23-index values This trend is
probably caused by the presence of a hidden AGN activity
in a galaxy In this regime the SDSS galaxies departing from
the model curve would be also dominated by objects with a
low SFR and a high M Section 45 see also Dopita et al
2006a
44 Dependence of O iiiO ii on M and SFR
In Section 43 we have estimated the typical ionization
parameters for our galaxy samples from the comparisons
of the photoionization models with the measurements of
O iiiO ii and R23-index and compared them Figure 3
However these comparisons do not focus on possible depen-
dencies on galaxy global properties such as M and SFR
Figure 2 presents a relatively large scatter in O iiiO ii
ratios at a given R23-index in one galaxy sample This scat-
ter could be originated from the galaxy global properties
To address the issue we examine the dependencies of the
O iiiO ii ratio on the galaxy global properties
Figure 4 shows O iiiO ii ratios as a function of M
SFR specic SFR sSFR SFR divided by M and 032
Equation 1 with   032 Figure 4 indicates that the
O iiiO ii ratio correlates with the galaxy global proper-
ties of M SFR sSFR and 032 A high O iiiO ii ra-
tio is found in low M low 032 and high sSFR galaxies
A similar trend is initially proposed by Brinchmann et al
2008 but we nd these trends in local extreme popula-
tions and high-z galaxies There is an anti-correlation be-
tween O iiiO ii and metallicity Section 42 Thus the
dependence of O iiiO ii ratio on M and 032 is reason-
able because the MZ relation and the FMR are in place
In this way the O iiiO ii ratio is tightly related to the
galaxy global properties while this ratio is an indicator of
ionization parameter and metallicity In the next section we
investigate dependencies of the galaxy global properties on
Figure 4 From top to bottom dependence of O iiiO ii on
M SFR sSFR and 032 The symbols and colors are the same
as those used in Figure 2

on the O iiiO ii vs R23-index diagram
Before moving to the next section we comment here on
the variations of global properties for the galaxies shown in
Figure 4 First GPs are the least massive and the most ac-
tively star-forming galaxies in the local universe Their low
032 values are probably due to their low metallicities eg
Amorn et al 2010 LBAs are the next extreme population
The LyC leakers have SFRs as high as GPs and LBAs High-
z galaxies have a M comparable with the SDSS galaxies
but a SFR higher than these local galaxies This tendency is
consistent with the evolution of the star-formation main se-
quence eg Daddi et al 2007 The SFRs and M of high-
z galaxies are little higher than those of GPs and LBAs
while the sSFR of high-z galaxies are comparable with those
of GPs and LBAs LAEs exhibit remarkable properties on
average having the least M and the highest SFR among
galaxies at any redshifts
45 Fundamental Ionization Relation
As shown in Figure 2 the O iiiO ii vs R23-index diagram
allows us to study ionization state of hot ISM in galaxies In
Section 44 we discuss that the O iiiO ii ratio depends on
four galaxy global properties of M SFR sSFR and 032
The large scatter found in Figure 2 would be explained by
the dierences of the galaxy global properties
In order to investigate the dependencies of M SFR
sSFR and 032 on the O iiiO ii vs R23-index plane we
make subsamples of our SDSS sample We choose one quan-
tity from the four galaxy global properties The chosen quan-
tity is referred to as a 3rd quantity hereafter A bin size of
a subsample is 015 dex in the 3rd quantity For a given sub-
sample we calculate a median O iiiO ii ratio of galaxies
in a range of logR23  01 We use subsamples with  50
galaxies for our analysis The left panels of Figure 5 show the
subsamples of M SFR sSFR and 032 on the O iiiO ii
vs R23-index plane Figure 5 indicates that the relation
between O iiiO ii and R23-index depends on the galaxy
global properties A high O iiiO ii ratio can be found
in less massive more eciently star-forming and probably
more metal-poor galaxies Dopita et al 2006a We intro-
duce a parameter   which combines R23-index and
one of the 3rd quantities
   logR23    
where  is a free parameter and   logM1010 M
logSFRM yr1 logsSFRGyr1 and 032 100 for
a 3rd quantity of M SFR sSFR and 032 respectively We
calculate a scatter of the SDSS subsamples in the relation
of O iiiO ii and   by varying  for each of the 3rd
quantities  As a result the scatter is minimized at  
012 007 015 025 for  of M SFR sSFR 032
The right panels of Figure 5 present our SDSS galaxies on
the O iiiO ii and   plane The median values of the
SDSS subsamples are tted by a quadrature
logO IIIO II  a0  a1   a2 2
 
where a0a2 are free parameters The best-t parameters
are given in Table 2 We show the best-t quadratures in
the right panels of Figure 5 These plots suggest that the

3rd quantity can reduce the systematic dispersions How-
ever it is unclear whether the new parameter of  reduces
the dispersion by a physical reason or a simple statistical
reason Here we use  dened in Equation 1 as a 3rd
quantity and search for an optimal combination of M and
SFR by varying parameters of both  and  9 Note that the
parameter  denotes the best combination of M and SFR
for metallicity Mannucci et al 2010 while the parameter
 denes the best combination of these quantities for both
metallicity and ionization parameter Based on Equation 8
with    100 we calculate 2 of the free parameters
 and  Here we assume that 1 O iiiO ii dispersions
of our subsamples are originated from measurement errors
These 1 dispersions are used to obtain the 2 values
Figure 6 shows 2 values of  and  The minimum 2
is provided by the parameters of    029 025 The
026 and   025006

tent with the one of the FMR   032 Thus 032

dependence of M we have found in our analysis that a  function
with   SFR provides the best-t value of   0 Table 2
which indicates that a SFR alone does not reduce the scatter of
the SDSS galaxy distribution

for   032 is the best 3rd quantity to describe the rela-
tion Moreover we have newly constrained the  parameter
that is tightly related to ionization parameter The best-t 
rules out   0 at the  95  condence level The results of
our analysis suggest that ionization parameters given with
the O iiiO ii vs R23-index diagram is important to char-
acterize galaxies and that ionization parameters are closely
related to the galaxy global properties of M and SFR as
well as metallicity
We compare our various galaxy samples with the best-
t function of the SDSS galaxies in Figure 7 This gure is
the same as the bottom right panel of Figure 5 but with
high-z galaxies and local extreme populations GPs LBAs
and the LyC leakers Although the best-t function is de-
rived with the SDSS sample alone high-z galaxies and local
extreme populations follow the same relation or fall on the
extrapolation of the function It should be noted that no
signicant dierences are found between galaxies at z  2
and 3 The relation of best-t function between O iiiO ii
and   Figure 7 is thus thought to be a fundamental
relation consisting of ionization parameter metallicity M
and SFR over cosmic time Hereafter we refer to the relation
as fundamental ionization relation FIR
5 DISCUSSION
51 Evolution of Ionization State
We have conrmed the trend that high-z galaxies have ion-
ization parameters signicantly higher than local galaxies
The SDSS galaxies typically show qion  2  107 cm s1
while the high-z LBGs exhibit an ionization parameter
higher than the SDSS galaxies by a factor of  4 Table 1
Figure 3 This evolution of ionization parameter is consis-
tent with the trend that high-z galaxies depart from the local
star-forming sequence in the BPT diagram towards higher
O iiiH ratio eg Brinchmann et al 2008 Kewley et al
2013ab and with the recent spectroscopic surveys of high-z
galaxies Cullen et al 2014 Holden et al 2014 The evolu-
tion of ionization parameter can be closely related to the
evolution of SFR and M As shown in Figure 5 a high
O iiiO ii ratio ie a high ionization parameter is found
in low M low 032 and high sSFR galaxies Since high-
z galaxies tend to have a higher sSFR or smaller 032
than local galaxies Figure 4 cf the evolution of the star-
formation main sequence Daddi et al 2007 they are sup-
posed to show an ionization parameter typically higher than
local galaxies Note that ionization parameter is by deni-
tion the ratio of ionizing photon and hydrogen atom den-
sities Since the amount of ionizing photons and hydrogen
atoms would be positively correlated with SFR and stel-
lar mass respectively the evolution of ionization parameter
would be explained by the increase of sSFR ie the high
SFR and low mass for high-z galaxies
The local extreme populations of GPs LyC leakers and
LBAs have an ionization parameter as high as z  2  3
LBGs and LAEs Moreover the ionization parameter of GPs
is comparable to that of LAEs GPs low metallicities see
also Amorn et al 2010 and SFR Izotov et al 2011 are
also analogous to those observed in LAEs In these senses

GPs could be local counterparts of z  23 LAEs However
GPs are quite rare objects in the local universe occupying
only  006  of the SDSS sample Nakajima et al 2013
Cardamone et al 2009 The number density of GPs is ap-
proximately two orders of magnitude smaller than that of
z  2 LAEs Interestingly Heckman et al 2005 report a
similar dierence of abundances between LBAs and z  3
LBGs These results indicate that galaxies with a high ion-
ization parameter would emerge in a high redshift universe
and that these galaxies are more dominant in high-z than
the local universe
Recently some studies have found galaxies with very
strong nebular emission lines that are called extreme
emission line galaxies
EELGs eg van der Wel et al
2011 Atek et al 2011 van der Wel et al 2011 investigate
EELGs at z  17 in the CANDELS deep imaging data of
HSTWFC3 These EELGs present a very strong O iii of
EW  1000 A that signicantly boosts ux measurements
in a NIR broadband which are similar to the bright r-band
uxes of GPs Although no estimates of ionization param-
eter are given for EELGs due to lacks of O ii data they
could have a very high ionization parameter suggested from
their very large EWO iii low M  108 M and high
sSFR  50 Gyr1 Kakazu et al 2007 study ultra-strong
line galaxies USELs at z  1 identied by narrowband
imaging and nd that USELs have extremely low metallic-
ities 12  logOH  8 and very high O iiiO ii ratios
 3  100 They argue that USELs typically have ion-
ization parameters as high as qion 108 cm s1 Obviously
ionization parameter is a key quantity to characterize these
extreme populations of galaxies
52 Revisiting the Issue of FMR Evolution from
z  2 to 3
Mannucci et al 2010 have suggested that the FMR can
describe properties of galaxies with no redshift evolution up
to z  25 and claimed that galaxies at z  3 fall sig-
nicantly below the FMR by  06 dex The analysis of
Mannucci et al 2010 indicates the evolution of FMR from
z  2 to 3 but it is not clear why the FMR evolves only
between z  2 and z  3 In contrast to the FMR evolution
we have argued in Section 45 that no signicant dierences
are found between galaxies at z  2 and 3 in the FIR Fig-
ure 7 We address the question why the FMR shows the
evolution but no evolution is found in the FIR
Mannucci et al 2010 use metallicities of z  3 galax-
ies given by Maiolino et al 2008 and Mannucci et al
2009 that are estimated with the local empirical rela-
tions of Maiolino et al 2008 The local empirical rela-
tions of Maiolino et al 2008 are obtained from two sam-
ples i 259 local galaxies with 12  logOH  84 whose
metallicities are estimated by the electron temperature Te
method and ii 22 482 star-forming SDSS galaxies with
12  logOH  82 given with the photoionization model
Kewley  Dopita 2002 see also Nagao et al 2006 Figure
8 presents R23-index and O iiiO ii ratio of the two sam-
ples The red dashed curves denote the local empirical re-
lations determined with these two samples Maiolino et al
2008 Figure 8 compares the photoionization models black
solid curves with the local empirical relations and indicates
that the local empirical relations implicitly assume an ion-
ization parameter Given the fact that high-z galaxies have
an ionization parameter higher than local galaxies Section
51 the local empirical relations assuming a relatively low
ionization parameter would provide biased metallicity es-
timates for high-z galaxies At z  25 the N ii6584H
ratio can be used to estimate metallicities andor to discrim-
inate one from two metallicity solutions given by R23-index
However at z  25 N ii6584 and H lines cannot be de-
tected from the ground The O iiiO ii ratio is needed to
determine one from two metallicity solutions of R23-index
The bottom panel of Figure 8 shows that the photoioniza-
tion model predicts a lower metallicity if a lower ionization
parameter is assumed Thus one may underestimate metal-
licities of z  3 galaxies with the local empirical relations
since the ionization parameter of z  3 galaxies is signi-
cantly higher than those of local galaxies Section 51
We evaluate the bias of z  3 galaxy metallicity es-
timates which is originated from the local empirical re-
lation We estimate metallicities of z  3 galaxies with
the Kobulnicky  Kewley 2004 method in the same man-
ner as Section 43 allowing the ionization parameter evo-
lution We compile a total of 15 z  3 galaxies from
AMAZE Maiolino et al 2008 and LSD Mannucci et al
2009 projects First for a consistency check we estimate
metallicities of our 15 z  3 galaxies with the local empiri-
cal relation used by Mannucci et al 2010 We nd that the
average metallicity of the z  3 galaxies is 12  logOH
 81 left panel of Figure 9 which is consistent with that
of Mannucci et al 2010 12  logOH  80  82 We
conrm that our 15 galaxies and the local empirical rela-
tion can reproduce the results of Mannucci et al 2010
Then using the Kobulnicky  Kewley 2004 method we

using the Kobulnicky  Kewley 2004 method that is free from the bias of ionization parameters The red and blue circles denote
metallicities of the z  3 galaxies in the cases of high- and low-Z branches respectively Four z  3 galaxies are omitted from the
plot since their R23-index values are out of the range where the Kobulnicky  Kewley 2004 method is available The blue circles are
consistent with the Mannucci et al 2010s average value while the red circles appear to follow the FMR
obtain average metallicities of our 11 z  3 galaxies for the
low-Z and high-Z branches that are 12  logOH  820
and 865 with ionization parameters of qion  66  107
and 11  108 cm s1 respectively Typically  02  03 dex
errors are associated with the estimates of metallicity and
ionization parameter for each of the galaxies Note that four
out of fteen galaxies are omitted from these metallicity es-
timates since their R23-index values fall out of the range
covered by Equations 6 and 7 The right panel of Fig-
ure 9 compares the metallicity estimate of Mannucci et al
2010 with ours allowing the ionization parameter evolu-
tion The high-Z branch metallicities appear to follow the
FMR black dashed curve Mannucci et al 2010 2011 In
contrast the low-Z branch metallicities fall below the FMR
which is consistent with the result of Mannucci et al 2010
Because
is no useful
such as
N ii6584H that determines one from two metallicity
solutions of low and high-Z branches we cannot conclude
which metallicities are correct and whether z  3 galaxies
follow the FMR However we nd that the high ionization
parameter of  11  108 cm s1 for the high-Z branch so-
lution agrees with the our ndings of ionization parameter
evolution from z  0 to 3 Section 51 Moreover there
are no physical reasons for the sudden departure from the
FMR from z  2 to 3 eg the smooth evolution of cosmic
SFRstellar mass densities at z  2 Bouwens et al 2011
Stark et al 2013 Theoretical studies do not nd the depar-
ture from the FMR at z  3 Our metallicity estimates of
high-Z branch of z  3 galaxies are comparable with those

hydrodynamical simulations Dayal et al 2013 have ex-
plained the trend of the FMR with the redshift-independent
Figure 10 LBAs in the FMR plot Metallicities are estimated by
the Kobulnicky  Kewley 2004 method The red and blue cir-
cles denote metallicities in the cases of high- and low-Z branches
respectively For each LBA the two metallicity solutions are dis-
tinguished by the other metallicity indicators see text The lled
circles present metallicities that agree better with the other metal-
licity estimates The open circles show less likely solutions LBAs
on average have metallicities of high-Z branch and follow the
simple analytic model These pieces of evidence imply that
the z  3 galaxy metallicities of high-Z branch with the
14 K Nakajima  M Ouchi
high-ionization parameter are correct and that z  3 galax-
ies follow the FMR
As local counterparts of high-z galaxies we also exam-
ine LBAs in the FMR plot in Figure 10 Their metallicities
are estimated in the same manner as those for z  3 galax-
ies However their two metallicity solutions can be distin-
guished since other metallicity indicators of gas tempera-
ture andor N ii6584H ratio are available for the local
galaxies The lled circles display metallicities that agree
better with those estimated by the other metallicity indica-
tors Figure 10 suggests that LBAs follow the FMR if their
metallicities are estimated with ionization parameter We
have also checked that the FMR is valid for GPs whose
metallicities are estimated in the same manner as those for
LBAs These ndings conrm the validity of the FMR over
the wide ranges of stellar mass and SFR in the local uni-
verse Another notable trend in Figure 10 is that the LBAs
metallicities of high-Z branch with high-ionization param-
eter are generally correct This is what we argue for the
z  3 galaxies Since LBAs are local UV-selected galaxies
whose characteristics are similar to those for LBGs eg
Overzier et al 2009 their trends in the FMR plot support
our argument that z  3 LBGs have metallicities of high-Z
branch with high-ionization parameter and follow the FMR
For more conclusive discussion of z  3 galax-
ies one needs deeper NIR spectroscopy to provide an
ionization parameter indicator of Ne iii3869O ii3727
eg Nagao et al 2006 Levesque  Richardson 2013
Richardson et al 2013 or IR   3m spectroscopy from
the space to obtain N ii6584H that determines one from
two metallicity solutions In particular the Ne iiiO ii ra-
tio is observable from the ground up to z  5 We have
conrmed the utility of the Ne iiiO ii ratio for LAEs
whose ionization parameters are very high Fosbury et al
2003 Christensen et al 2012b
53 Fundamental Ionization Relation
As demonstrated in Section 52 ionization parameter is im-
portant for metallicity estimates Although the FMR repro-
duces properties of galaxies with no signicant evolution
input metallicities to the FMR would be sometimes biased
due to the evolution of ionization parameters In this sense
the FIR is advantageous because the FIR allows the dif-
ference of ionization parameter The FIR consisting of the
ducial 032 parameter requires non-zero  where   0 is
ruled out at the  95  condence level Section 45 This
indicates that the four-dimensional relation of FIR between
ionization parameter metallicity SFR and M is useful to
characterize gas properties of galaxies
54 Relationship between Ionization State and
Ionizing Photon Escape
We have found in Figure 2 that the z  0 LyC leakers
show O iiiO ii ratios signicantly higher than typical low-
z galaxies which suggest that these LyC leakers have a high
ionization parameter The LyC leakers O iiiO ii ratios
are comparable to those of GPs LBAs and z  2  3 galax-
ies These results imply that galaxies with a high O iiiO ii
ratio GPs LBAs and z  2  3 galaxies may have a high
Figure 11 O iiiO ii vs fesc predicted by our cloudy models

dashed lines The blue cyan green light green and orange lines
denote O iiiO ii-fesc relations for a metallicity of Z  005 01
02 05 and 10 Z respectively
To examine the dependence of O iiiO ii ratio on
fesc we perform photoionization model calculations with
cloudy version 1302 Ferland et al 1998 2013 We as-
sume a constant-density homogeneous inter-stellar gas cloud
with a spherically closed geometry A volume lling fac-
tor of the ionized gas is assumed to be unity for simpli-
cation We include dust physics and the depletion fac-
tors of the various elements from the gaseous phase in
the same manner as the analysis of Dopita et al 2006b
In non-solar metallicities we assume that both the dust
model and the depletion factors are unchanged but the
dust abundance is assumed to scale linearly with the gas
metallicity as adopted in Nagao et al 2011 All elements
except for nitrogen carbon and helium are taken to be
primary nucleosynthesis elements For nitrogen we use
a form given by Lopez-Sanchez et al 2012 to take ac-
count of its secondary nucleosynthesis component in a high
metallicity range For carbon and helium we use forms in
Dopita et al 2006b Photoionization models are calculated
with the parameters of Z  005 01 02 05 10 Z

The incident ionizing radiation elds are generated by Star-
10 We have checked that changing the density to nH  10 cm3
and 103 cm3 does not alter our results Since both O iii and
O ii are collisionally excited lines their intensities are simi-
larly enhanced if the density is smaller than their critical den-

The nebula thus cannot form a complete Stromgren sphere
burst99 Leitherer et al 1999 We use instantaneous burst
models at zero age with a Kroupa 2001 IMF and lower
and upper mass limits of 01 and 120 M respectively Stel-
lar metallicities are matched to the gas-phase ones Under
these assumptions and conditions we evaluate fesc with the
number of ionizing photons escaping from a thin cloud with
a low column density We adopt a neutral hydrogen column
density NHI as the stopping criterion of our calculations
that ranges from NHI  1015 to 1020 cm2 The escape frac-
tion is dened as a ratio of transmitted ionizing photons
  912 A to input ionizing photons
Figure 11 shows the cloudy calculation results on
the O iiiO ii vs fesc plot Figure 11 indicates that the
O iiiO ii ratio increases with fesc This trend qualita-
tively explains the large O iiiO ii ratio of the LyC leakers
in Figure 2 This relationship between O iiiO ii ratio and
fesc is understood by one of the two classications of star-
forming nebulae
1 Ionization-bounded nebula whose radius is deter-
mined by the ionization equilibrium between the ionizing
photon production rate and the recombination rate Equa-
tion 3 Figure 12a The radius of the ionized region is called
the Stromgren radius
2 Density-bounded nebula whose radius is determined
by the distribution of gas cloud Figure 12b The density-
bounded nebula does not expend all of ionizing photons but
leak ionizing photons that are not used for the ionization of
the nebula
The ionizing photon escape takes place in the density-
bounded nebula under the assumption of homogeneous gas
cloud A density-bounded nebula with a less NHI emits more
ionizing photons and has a higher fesc Giammanco et al
2005 On the other hand in the ionization-bounded nebula
lower ionization species of O producing O ii dominate
in the outer region of the nebula while an O2 zone pro-
ducing O iii exists near the ionizing source eg Shields
sities of 7  105 cm3 for O iii and 316  103 cm3 for O ii
Osterbrock 1989 fesc is mainly governed by NHI
Ionization State of ISM in Galaxies
1990 Oey  Kennicutt 1997 Pellegrini et al 2012 Thus
the O zone of density-bounded nebula is smaller than that
of an ionization-bounded nebula but the size of O2 zone is
similar in the density-bounded and ionization-bounded neb-
ulae As a result the O iiiO ii ratio is large in density-
bounded nebulae and nebulae with a less NHI have a higher
O iiiO ii ratio From the combination of NHI vs fesc and
NHI vs O iiiO ii relations we understand the positive
correlation between O iiiO ii and fesc We note that we
consider a very simple case with the assumption that H ii-
regions are homogeneous density-bounded nebulae In real-
ity conditions of H ii-regions with ionizing photon escape
could be more complex eg ionization-bounded nebulae
with highly ionized low density holes eg Zackrisson et al
2013 see also the end of this section However we present
in this paper the simple case to investigate the possibility
that the O iiiO ii ratio could be aected by the condition
of H ii-regions where ionizing photon escapes take place It
is beyond the scope of this paper whether or not the as-
sumption of the density-bounded nebulae is reasonable The
assumption remains to be tested by future observations
In Figure 11 O iiiO ii ratios are determined not only
by fesc but also by ionization parameter and metallicity For
example the O iiiO ii ratio increases by an order of mag-
nitude from logqion  75 to 85 Similarly the O iiiO ii
ratio increases by a factor of  2  4 from Z  10 and
01 Z although this dependence is small Section 42 On
the other hand the O iiiO ii ratio increases by a factor
of  2  3 from fesc  0 to 05 The O iiiO ii ratio is thus
sensitive to fesc as well as ionization parameter and metal-
licity These results would suggest that a galaxy with a high
O iiiO ii ratio can be a candidate of high fesc object but
that not all of high O iiiO ii objects are LyC leakers
In Figure 7 we have found that most of galaxies at
z  0  3 follow the FIR within the uncertainties How-
ever some galaxies clearly depart from the FIR at a few
sigma level The two z  0 LyC leakers have an O iiiO ii
ratio higher than the FIR by a factor of  2  3 at high
signicance The enhancement of O iiiO ii ratio may be
caused by an ionizing photon escape If it is true some GPs
and LAEs lying above the FIR would be good candidates of
ionizing photon emitting objects In Figure 7 LAEs partic-
ularly have a very high O iiiO ii ratio some of which are
departing from the FIR more signicantly than LBGs over
the sizes of error bars This physical characteristics would
be originated from a very large fesc given by a low NHI of
LAE The low NHI of LAE is also supported by the gas-
dynamics study of Hashimoto et al 2013 who claim that
LAEs typically have a NHI lower than LBGs from the anal-
ysis of velocity osets between a Ly line and low-ionization
interstellar absorption lines with respect to the systemic ve-
locity This tendency is conrmed with a larger number of
LAEs by Shibuya et al 2014a In this companion paper
Shibuya et al 2014b examine LAE structures suggesting
that LAEs with a large Ly EW tend to have a small elliptic-
ity This is consistent with the theoretical results that Ly
photons can more easily escape from face-on disks having
a small ellipticity due to a low NHI eg Verhamme et al
2012 Yajima et al 2012 Zheng  Wallace 2013 Moreover
recent deep narrowband imaging surveys have indicated dif-
fuse Ly emitting halos around high-z star-forming galax-
ies that are more prominent for LBGs eg Steidel et al
16 K Nakajima  M Ouchi
2011 than LAEs Feldmeier et al 2013 Since most of the
observed Ly emission in the diuse halos is probably orig-
inated from the galaxy H ii-regions and scattered to the line
of sight by extended H i gas in the galaxys circum-galactic
medium CGM LAEs could exhibit Ly halos weaker than
LBGs due to their smaller amounts of H i gas in the CGM
This scenario is consistent with our argument of low NHI of
LAE Interestingly that interpretation also consistently ex-
plains the results of direct LyC detections of z  3 galaxies
that reveal a high fesc for LAEs  01  03 than LBGs
 005 Iwata et al 2009 Nestor et al 2011 2013 Thus
an origin of the high fesc in LAEs would be their optically
thin H i gas surrounding star-forming regions A similar sug-
gestion of the high fesc is inferred for GPs Jaskot  Oey
2013 The local LyC leakers show an fesc comparably high
as LBGs  002  01 Bergvall et al 2006 Leitet et al
2013 and thus have an O iiiO ii ratio as high as LBGs
LAEs with a high fesc would play a key role in
supplying ionizing photons for cosmic reionization in the
early universe Previous z  6  7 galaxy surveys have
suggested that the universe could not be totally ionized
by galaxies alone at z  6  7 if one assumes similar
properties of galaxies at z  3 that include fesc  005
eg Ouchi et al 2009 Robertson et al 2010 Because
the fraction of LAEs in star-forming galaxies increases
with redshift at least up to z  6 eg Ouchi et al 2008
Vanzella et al 2009 Stark et al 2010 2011 Hayes et al
2011 the average fesc for z  6 galaxies would be higher
than that for z  3 galaxies The higher fesc for z  6
galaxies may resolve the problem of ionizing photon decit
in cosmic reionization Note that the number of observed
LAEs suddenly drops from z  6 to 7 This could be due
to the Ly damping absorption of partly neutral IGM
Vanzella et al 2011 Pentericci et al 2011 Ono et al
2012 Schenker et al 2012 or optically thick systems in the
intervening IGM Bolton  Haehnelt 2013 Alternatively
the decreasing fraction of LAEs could be explained by the
intrinsic decrease of galaxies with strong Ly emission
at z  6 Dijkstra et al 2014 If we assume the former
scenarios galaxies with an intrinsically bright Ly line
would not decrease from z  6 to 7 However this is still
an open question A similar implication is provided by
Schenker et al 2013 on the basis of a small velocity oset
of Ly line with respect to the systemic velocity for z  34
galaxies We also note that this picture would be consistent
with the observational fact that gas fraction of star-forming
galaxies increases with redshift or more properly with
sSFR eg Tacconi et al 2010 2013 Santini et al 2014 If
the molecular gas exists in dense cores of clumps embedded
in density-bounded nebulae ionized by young stars the
galaxy could have a high gas fraction and high fesc A dense
molecular gas clump could reside inside the H ii-region
since the dense gas could be self-shielded from ionizing
radiation A good example is found in the Orion nebula
see eg Genzel  Stutzki 1989 for a review Such clumpy
geometry of dense molecular gas could explain the high gas
fraction active star-formation and high fesc in high-z LAEs
In the discussion of high fesc for LAEs there is one
caveat that Ly emission would become weaker in a high
fesc because less ionizing photons are spent for making
ionized gas that emit Ly Therefore LAEs may not be
Figure 13 EWLy vs fesc plot The dashed curve is our
cloudy model for Z  02 Z and logqion  80 that represents
upper limits of EWLy values see text Observational results

a population of high fesc The dashed curve in Figure 13
shows the relation between EWLy and fesc predicted by
our cloudy models Here we assume qion  108 cm s1 and
Z  02 Z typical values observed in GPs Amorn et al
2010 and z  2 LAEs Nakajima et al 2013 The dashed
curve presents that the EWLy decreases sharply if its
fesc are over  08 However in fesc  00  08 EWLy
remains unchanged within a factor of  2 We have checked
that the overall trends are the same adopting other values of
qion and Z For example EWLy increases decreases by
a factor of  2  3 for Z  005 Z 1 Z LAEs are usually
dened as galaxies with EWLy  20 A If an escape frac-
tion is very high fesc  09 a galaxy cannot be observed as
an LAE However LAEs or galaxies with EWLy  20 A
can exist in the range of fesc  08 Since a very high fesc
of  08 is not required for cosmic reionization but only
fesc  02 Robertson et al 2013 the weakening of Ly
in density-bounded nebulae does not rule out the possibil-
ity that major ionizing sources are LAEs Figure 13 also
compares our model and the recent observational results for
z  3 LAEs and LBGs whose fesc are measured from LyC
uxes Nestor et al 201311 EWLy values of our model
are regarded as upper limits because EWLy decreases
by dust extinction and hydrogen scattering The observa-
tional results fall below our model and are consistent with
our model The observations indicate a positive correlation
between fesc and EWLy in fesc  05 while our model
shows a nearly constant EWLy in this regime This dif-
ference would infer that LAEs have a less dust extinction a
more homogeneous geometry for isotropic Ly scattering a
less metallicity and more ionizing photons than LBGs
We note that our calculations assume a density-
bounded nebula with a spherically closed geometry and
predict dependencies of NHI on the emergent spectra A
volume lling factor of the ionized gas is assumed to
11 We refer to Nestor et al 2011 and Shapley et al 2003 for
the ranges of EWLy of LAEs and LBGs respectively
be unity Thus we have presented this specic case of
EWLy as a function of fesc However the EWLy
and fesc involve various complex physical eects EWLy
depends on gas and dust geometries eg Neufeld 1991
Scarlata et al 2009 cf Duval et al 2014 and galactic scale
outow eg Kunth et al 1998 Verhamme et al 2006
fesc anti-correlates with a covering fraction of neutral gas
Recent spectroscopic studies suggest a low covering frac-
tion of neutral gas in high-z star-forming galaxies eg
Shapley et al 2003 Steidel et al 2010 Jones et al 2013
There exist the other complex physics of EWLy and fesc
Nevertheless our analysis reveals the relation of EWLy
and fesc for the case that H ii-regions are homogeneous
density-bounded nebulae
6 SUMMARY
We investigate ionization state of hot ISM in galax-
ies at z  0  3 with  140 000 SDSS galax-
ies and 108 intermediate and high redshift galax-
ies using
and metallicity
sensitive
O iii5007 4959O ii3727H
R23-index Our
main results are summarized as follows
an ionization parameter
O iii5007O ii3727
 We conrm that z  2  3 galaxies show an O iiiO ii
ratio signicantly higher than a typical star-forming galaxy
of SDSS by a factor of  10 Figure 2 The photoionization
models reveal that these high-z galaxies have an ionization
parameter of logqioncm s1  7690 a factor of  410
higher than local galaxies Figure 3
 We nd a high ionization parameter in local extreme
populations of green pea galaxies GPs Lyman-continuum
emitting galaxies LyC leakers and Lyman break analogs
LBAs and the ionization parameters of these galaxies are
comparable with the ones of z  2  3 galaxies Figure 3
These local extreme populations are quite rare and their
number densities are nearly two orders of magnitude smaller
than those of z  2  3 galaxies
 We identify a correlation between the O iiiO ii ra-
tio and galaxy global properties of star-formation rate
SFR stellar mass M and metallicity Figure 4 A high
O iiiO ii ratio is found in less massive eciently star-
forming and metal-poor galaxies
 We develop a four-dimensional relation of ionization pa-
rameter SFR M and metallicity Figure 5 extending
the fundamental metallicity relation FMR Mannucci et al
2010 Lara-Lopez et al 2010 with ionization parameter
The intermediate and high-z galaxies up to z  3 as well as
the local extreme populations follow the same relation de-
ned with the SDSS galaxies Figure 7 The relation is thus
referred to as the fundamental ionization relation FIR
 We particularly nd no signicant dierences between
galaxies at z  2 and 3 in the FIR Figure 7 This is in
contrast with the FMR whose possible evolution from z  2
to 3 is reported Mannucci et al 2010 We suggest that the
FMR evolution can arise if one omits ionization parameter
dierences and adopts local empirical metallicity relations
for high-z galaxies We indicate that the FMR evolution
does not exist for one out of two average metallicity solu-
tions of z  3 galaxies with a high ionization parameter of
logqioncm s1  8 right panel of Figure 9
Ionization State of ISM in Galaxies
 We nd the z  0 LyC leakers exhibit O iiiO ii ra-
tios signicantly higher than typical low-z galaxies although
there are only two LyC leakers This trend suggests a posi-
tive correlation between O iiiO ii and ionizing photon es-
cape fraction fesc Our photoionization models of cloudy
reproduce the trend Figure 11 Since O iiiO ii ratios for
z  2  3 galaxies especially Ly emitters LAEs are com-
parable to or higher than those of the low-z LyC leakers
these high-z galaxies are candidates of high fesc objects
 Our cloudy photoionization models
EWLy remains almost unchanged if its fesc is  0  08
Figure 13 indicating that galaxies are identied as LAEs
of a Ly emitting population if their fesc values are below
 08 Faint galaxies with intrinsically-bright Ly having
a high fesc could signicantly contribute to the ionizing
photon production for cosmic reionization since recent
observations report that a fraction of LAEs in star-forming
galaxies increases with redshift at the epoch with no IGM
damping absorption eg Ouchi et al 2008 Vanzella et al
2009 Stark et al 2010 2011 If
it is true this would
ease the tension of ionizing photon decit problem eg
Ouchi et al 2009 Robertson et al 2010
