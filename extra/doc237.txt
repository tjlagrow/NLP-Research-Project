Abstract In this review I focus on the galactic properties in clusters at z  0102
The most salient results regarding the evolution in galaxy colors spectral features
and morphologies are discussed
1 Blue galaxies the Butcher-Oemler eect
The Butcher-Oemler eect is the excess of galaxies bluer than the
color-magnitude sequence where most ellipticalspassive galaxies lie
in clusters at z  01  02 as compared to the richest nearby clusters
1 Butcher and Oemler were well aware that the fraction of blue
galaxies depends on a number of things including the cluster type
the clustercentric radius considered and the galaxy magnitude limit as
discussed below
Optical versus X-ray cluster selection  The dependence of the blue
fraction on the cluster properties is potentially critical given that se-
lecting dierent types of clusters at dierent redshifts could in principle
mimic an evolution For this reason it is interesting to ask whether
optically and X-ray selected samples of clusters reach similar conclu-
sions regarding the Butcher-Oemler eect 2 3 Based on the CNOC
Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology X-ray-selected clus-
ter sample an evolution of the blue fraction with redshift very similar
to the original Butcher-Oemler result has been conrmed 4 5 In-
terestingly the blue fraction shows no simple trend with cluster X-ray
luminosity 2 3 6 a point I will discuss later
Richness  How the blue fraction fB depends on cluster richness has
been the subject of an extensive study by 7 who found fB to be
higher in poor clusters and lower in rich clusters and to increase with
redshift for all types of clusters It would be important to verify how
fB depends on richness using a clustercentric radial limit that varies
with the cluster scalelength instead of the xed metric radius 07 Mpc
adopted by this study because this choice could induce a spurious trend
with richness by sampling dierent areas in rich and poor clusters 6
Substructure Possibly the most relevant question of all is how the blue
fraction and the star formation activity in general depend on cluster
substructure ie on the mergingaccretion history of the cluster The
exact relation between subcluster merging and blue fraction still needs

to be quantied though there is a tendency for clusters with the highest
blue fractions to show signs of recent merging events 8 9 2 10 Based
on spectroscopy there is of course ample evidence for larger fractions
of starforming galaxies in substructured than in relaxed clusters This
trend can originate from a higher average SF activity in the smaller
less massive systems that make up substructured clusters 11 12
but can also be amplied by starbursts induced by the merger itself
13 14 8 15 as predicted by several theoretical simulations
Given the dependence of blue fraction on the cluster characteristics
understanding how fB evolves at z  05 is more problematic with the
current cluster samples a very massive cluster at z08 MS1054-03
has a blue fraction similar to typical values in clusters at z04-05 16
while in other z  1 clusters higher fractions approaching 70-80 have
been reported 17 18
Two aspects are worth highlighting here First we should appreciate
that fully understanding at any given redshift how the galaxy proper-
ties depend upon the cluster properties is very useful in order to uncover
how environment aects galaxy evolution Thus the dependence of
the galactic properties on the cluster characteristics is not a burden
that is in our way when trying to disclose evolutionary eects On the
contrary it is in a sense the very thing we are looking for
Second the lack of simple correlations between the galaxy prop-
erties and the cluster most general easier to observe characteristics
such as the total X-ray luminosity or the optical richness shows that a
single global cluster property of this kind is an insucient information
to characterize the cluster status in a useful way for galaxy evolu-
tion studies More detailed pieces of information are needed including
among others quantitative measurements of the cluster mass of the
ICM local density the knowledge of the dynamical status of the cluster
and its history of accretion of other clustersgroups In this sense the
wavelength criterion for cluster selection optical versus X-ray is not
useful on its own because there is no cluster selection method that is
immune from the problem of carefully understanding a posteriori on a
cluster-by-cluster basis what is the cluster status and history
Great care is required to compare fB values of dierent clusters
in a meaningful way also because the blue fraction depends on the
magnitude limit adopted on the passband 6 see also De Propris in
these proceedings and on the clustercentric radius 5 have shown
that when looking only at the central core region typically  05
Mpc no trend with redshift is observed while the Butcher-Oemler
eect is conspicuous outside of the core The radial distribution of the
blue galaxies and its evolution with z must be related to the infall of
eld galaxies onto the cluster The declining infall rate onto clusters at
poggiantiportotex 2022008 059 p2
lower z is likely to play an important role in the Butcher-Oemler eect
together with the evolution of the average star formation rate in the
eld galaxies and the decline of star formation in cluster galaxies 5 4
The Butcher-Oemler eect and the fact that the galaxy populations in
clusters evolve signicantly during the last Gyrs are conrmed by the
spectroscopic and morphological studies described below This evolu-
tion involves luminous giant galaxies though probably not the most
massive early-type galaxies that populate the top end of the magnitude
sequence as discussed in the next section
2 Red galaxies the color-magnitude sequence
There is a general consensus regarding the ages of the stellar pop-
ulations in early-type cluster galaxies ie in ellipticals and S0s as
morphologically-classied from HST images The slope zero-point and
scatter of their color-magnitude CM relation at various redshifts in-
dicate passive evolution of stellar populations that formed at z 2-3
and the CM slope is found to be mostly driven by a mass-metallicity
relation 19 20 21 22 16 see also 23 Moreover well dened CM
red sequences in higher redshift clusters z  1 are now being observed
eg 24 25 26 27 and there are hints for a atter CM sequence at
high-z 29 28 that still needs to be comprehended The old stellar ages
in early-type galaxies are conrmed also by their spectroscopic features
see below eg 30 31 and by fundamental-plane mass-to-light ratio
and Mg- studies eg 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 though this latter
type of works have been necessarily limited to relatively small numbers
of the brightest galaxies
This homogeneity of histories of early-type galaxies in clusters needs
to be contrasted with a number of other results and considerations
a The population of early-type galaxies observed in distant clusters
does not necessarily comprises all the early-type galaxies existing at
z0 Morphological transformations might occur in clusters see below
and change later-type starforming galaxies into some of the early-type
galaxies present in clusters today Due to this progenitor bias in
distant clusters we would be observing only those galaxies that were
already assembled as early-type and stopped forming stars at high
redshift 32 20 39
b The blue galaxies observed in distant clusters responsible for the
Butcher-Oemler eect must largely have disappeared  become
red by z0 4 see also 2 have shown that the color-magnitude dia-
gram observed at intermediate z rich of blue galaxies can be reconciled
with the CM diagram of the Coma cluster with very few luminous blue
galaxies if star formation is halted in the blue galaxies at intermediate
redshifts
poggiantiportotex 2022008 059 p3
c Related to the previous point some works at z  1 argue for a
truncation of the CM sequence 40 as only bright galaxies are found to
be in place on the sequence and there is a decit of fainter red galaxies
This is possibly related to the fact that when star formation is halted in
blue Butcher-Oemler galaxies they evolve becoming redder and fainter
going to populate the red sequence at magnitudes fainter than the top
brightest 1 or 2 magnitudes Furthermore a UV-excess has been found
in the galaxies on the red sequence as compared to passive evolution
models 18 40
d On the color-magnitude sequence there are also passive spirals at
all redshifts 31 at z05 41 at z03 42 in Coma 43 at z025
and some mergers at z08 44
All these ndings suggest that the color-magnitude sequence of clus-
ters today except the very brightest end of it must be composed of
a variegated population of galaxies that had a variety of star forma-
tion histories Though probably the mass-metallicity relation remains
a main driver of the CM relation intricate age and metallicity eects
must be at work as also shown by the age-metallicity anticorrelation in
passive galaxies found by a number of studies based on spectral indices
see 45 and references therein
3 Spectroscopy absorption-line spectra
When the rst spectra of galaxies in distant clusters were taken the
biggest surprise was the nding of galaxies with strong Balmer lines in
absorption and no emission lines First recognized and named EA
by 46 their spectra were rst modeled in detail by 47 Now known
also as ka galaxies they can be explained if star formation was
active in the recent past and was halted at some point during the
last 1-15 Gyr The strongest cases equivalent width EWH  5 A
require a strong starburst before the truncation of the star formation
A large number of works have found and analyzed ka spectra in
distant clusters 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 11 The Mass-to-
Light ratios of the few studied ka galaxies appear to be much lower
than that of early-type galaxies and are consistent with them having
undergone a recent starburst 33 34
In 10 clusters at z04-05 the MORPHS collaboration has found
the ka fraction to be signicantly larger in clusters than in the eld
at similar redshifts 56 31 These cluster kas have mostly spiral
morphologies and present a radial distribution within the cluster that
is intermediate between the passive and the emission-line galaxy pop-
ulations In contrast 57 interpret their results on the CNOC clusters
concluding there is no signicant excess of kas in the clusters at
z03 compared to the eld The dierence between the MORPHS and
poggiantiportotex 2022008 059 p4
the CNOC results cannot be ascribed to the optical vs X-ray cluster
selection the brightest X-ray clusters in both samples have similar X-
ray luminosities the MORPHS clusters spanning a factor of 17 in X-ray
luminosities while the CNOC clusters a factor of 4 but the most X-
ray luminous MORPHS clusters tend to be those with the highest ka
fractions A Principal Component Analysis of the CNOC spectra by
5 nds a Post-Starformation component which again is intermediate
in dynamical state and stellar age between the old passive population
and the eld-like starforming component This component presents a
small excess in clusters compared to the eld but the PCA cannot be
easily translated into galaxy number fractions and thus be compared
with the MORPHS results
An excess of ka galaxies in clusters as opposed to the eld is a
strong evidence for a quenching of star formation in galaxies as a con-
sequence of the cluster environment The implications of ka spectra
regarding the presence of starburts in clusters at high-z will be discussed
in the next section The fact that kas mostly have spiral morpholo-
gies indicates that spectrophotometric and morphological evolution are
largely decoupled and suggests that the timescale for morphological
transformation must be longer than the ka timescale  15 Gyr
31 ka galaxies at low redshift
The occurrence of ka galaxies at low z is believed to be low both in the
eld 01 58 and in clusters 59 In Coma and other nearby clusters
Balmer strong galaxies have been reported at a reduced frequency and
burst strength weaker Balmer lines compared to distant clusters
14 15 60 and references therein It has been suggested that in
Coma this Balmer strong galaxies are preferentially associated with
the NGC4839 group infalling from South-West 14 and the central
concentration of the latest star formation activity seems to support the
post-starburst scenario 60 Recently in a magnitude-limited new spec-
troscopic survey of Coma galaxies we nd no ka galaxy as luminous
as those in distant clusters but a signicant population of faint kas
dwarf galaxies MV  185 with no preference for the NGC4839
group 61 This work suggests that while strong-lined ka spectra in
luminous galaxies appear to be an important phenomenon in distant
clusters in the local Universe the ka incidence is mostly related with
dwarf galaxies
4 Spectroscopy emission-line spectra
Emission lines are the most widely used indicators of ongoing star for-
mation in the optical because their ux is roughly proportional to the
current star formation rate Surprisingly the evolution with redshift

Figure 1 Evolution of the SFR per unit L
dotted line
B in the eld solid line and cluster
of the fraction of cluster galaxies with emission lines has not been
properly quantied so far although there is a trend for higher emission
line fractions at high z eg 30 62 I try to show this graphically
in Fig 1 where I have plotted the SFR per unit L luminosity as
derived from the OII3727 line at z05 and at z0 for eld galaxies
solid line and cluster galaxies dotted line At z05 this is based on
the MORPHS cluster and eld samples and at z0 on the Dressler 
Shectman spectroscopic database Dressler et al in prep The most
striking result of this gure is the fact that the evolution in the clusters
appears to be accelerated with respect to the eld in a similar way as
found by 4 on the basis of photometric data Most works have instead
focused on the clustercentric radial behaviour of the emission line prop-
erties the mean EWOII is known to decrease with radius eg 63
This mean EW is calculated including all galaxies in the clusters also
early-type galaxies and in principle could be simply explained by the
morphology-density relation However even for a given morphological
type the EWOII distribution appears to be skewed towards lower
EWs in the cluster than in the eld 56 64
A still open and debated question is whether before quenching
star formation the cluster environment produces also a star formation
enhancement in the infalling galaxies Evidence for this enhancement
arises from the strong ka cases whose spectra can only be explained as
post-starburst galaxies Considering that these strong-lined case must
be the youngest observed relatively soon after truncation and that
soon they will evolve into kas with more moderate line strength the
fraction of post-starburst galaxies among ka spectra is necessarily
high In principle the starbursting progenitors of these post-starburst
galaxies could simply be eld starburst galaxies that have infallen into
poggiantiportotex 2022008 059 p6
the clusters and had their star formation terminated Whether the
starbursts in the eld population are sucient to account for the ka
population observed in distant clusters is an issue requiring further
study Dressler et al in prep Examples of cluster-induced starbursts
have been observed in nearby clusters where it is easier to study the
star formation signatures in great detail
No need for a star formation enhancement in clusters is found in-
stead by looking at the OII or H equivalent width distributions in
clusters versus eld and as a function of radius no excess of emission
line galaxies as fractions of total number of galaxies is observed as
well as no tail at high EWs eg 63 41 However eventual cluster-
induced starbursts might have gone undetected by this kind of analysis
for at least three reasons a a possibly short burst timescale b if
the end-eect of the cluster is to quench star formation the fraction of
emission-line galaxies detected does not say anything about the amount
of star formation ongoing in the still currently starforming galaxies
and c dust could moderate the line emission and it is expected to do
so especially in those galaxies with the highest star formation rates
41 The role of dust
There are several lines of evidence indicating the importance of dust
extinction in galaxies in distant clusters In the local Universe galax-
ies with very strong emission lines are usually faint very late-type
galaxies Sd Irr while massive and luminous starburst galaxies in
most cases show a combination of strong early Balmer lines in absorp-
tion and weak-to-moderate OII emission 65 and references therein
These spectral features are easily understood and reproduced by spec-
trophotometric models in which younger stars suer a higher dust
extinction than older stellar populations as can be reasonably expected
31 66 67 68 Hence searching for very strong emission lines is not
an ecient method to identify starbursts with high SFRs
Spectra resembling those of local massive starbursts with high dust
extinction have been found in a signicant fraction  10  of both
cluster and eld galaxies at z  05 31 Furthermore the H line in
emission has been detected in some otherwise ka or passive spectra
again suggesting that the OII line in the blue might not have been
detected due to dust obscuration 69 70
Additional evidence that SFRs can be strongly underestimated in
the optical comes from studies at dust-free wavelengths radio contin-
uum emission has been detected in some of the strongest youngest
ka galaxies at z04 71 and some optically passive galaxies in low
redshift clusters 70 suggesting they are undergoing a current star
formation activity that is invisible in the optical Mid-IR estimates of
poggiantiportotex 2022008 059 p7
the SFR in star-forming galaxies in a cluster at z02 lead to values a
factor 10 to 100 higher than those based on the OII line 72 while
standard dust corrections usually adopted only account for a factor 25
5 Morphologies
Before HST a few ground-based studies provided hints that the galax-
ies responsible for the Butcher-Oemler eect are prevalently spirals with
disturbed morphologies andor mergers 73 74 Already the rst HST
images proved that indeed distant clusters contain a large number of
spirals many of which are disturbed 75 76 77 78 79 55 Moreover
in the MORPHS clusters the high spiral fraction corresponds to a low
S0 fraction suggesting that a signicant fraction of the spirals evolve
into at least some of the S0s that dominate rich clusters today 78 also
94 This result has been questioned by other studies 80 81 but at
least part of the discrepancy might be ascribed to the fact that these
works have focused on the number ratio of S0 to elliptical galaxies
This latter quantity more prone to errors than the simple fractions of
each morphological type has been found to be highly dependent on
the cluster characteristics in particular on the central concentration
of ellipticals in the clusters 83 When considering separately the E
S0 and spiral fractions as a function of redshifts studies at z01-025
conrm the trend of evolution of S0s 83 Also if the overall early-type
fraction ES0 is examined a strong evolution with redshift is found
16 82 with high redshift clusters being composed of a much larger
fraction of late type galaxies
Signatures for quite recent star formation in S0 galaxies consis-
tent with a transformation from spirals have been detected in sev-
eral clusters while such activity is found to be absent in ellipticals
84 85 86 87 88 see also Katgert in these proceedings However
not all studies nd a dierence among the stellar population ages of
S0s and ellipticals eg 19 89 38 A possible explanation for the
discrepant results are the magnitude limits of the various studies since
most of the S0s with recent star formation avoid the top end of the
luminosity function as expected evolving the luminosities of typical
star-forming spirals at intermediate redshifts 86
Interestingly cosmological high-resolution simulations are able to
account for the morphology-density relation of ellipticals but they fail
to reproduce the properties of the S0s as if some additional mecha-
nism for S0 formation not currently included in the models might be
required 90 91
Finally 44 argue for an unexpectedly large fraction of mergers in a
cluster at z08 Since most of these pairs have red colors we might be
witnessing the formation of ellipticals through the merging of galaxies
poggiantiportotex 2022008 059 p8
whose stars formed at high z as expected in hierarchical models of
structure formation
Due to space limitations I am forced to omit in these proceedings
the discussion of the morphology-density relation 78 83 84 92 and
of the star formation-density relation 93 94
