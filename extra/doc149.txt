Abstract We present results of surveys for high redshift galaxies selected by their
having produced detectable Mg II and Lyman limit absorption in the spectra of
background QSOs We discuss the properties of the absorbing galaxies the connec-
tion between galaxy properties and absorption line signatures and how a combina-
tion of QSO absorption line and conventional faint galaxy techniques can be used
to study cid12eld galaxy evolution to very large redshifts
 Introduction
The sub ject of QSO absorption lines seems to be reaching a remarkable level
of maturity where the statistics of the various classes of systems are well
known over a very large range of redshifts and ecid14cient high resolution spec-
trographs on large telescopes are making feasible and relatively routine
the accumulation of detailed information for individual absorption systems
Nevertheless the actual application of the absorption line studies as tools
in understanding the nature of galaxies and the intergalactic medium as a
function of time are in a state of infancy in many respects It is of course
here that the promise of the whole cid12eld must be realized the unique access
to physical details of galaxies as a function of time must be exploited and
then integrated into the global picture of galaxy formation and evolution
The aim of this contribution is twofold cid12rst in order to understand the
overall implications for galaxies of the studies of metal line absorption sys-
tems it is crucial to know exactly what types of galaxies represent potential
absorbers how the absorption properties might be related to the galaxy prop-
erties and what parts of those galaxies give rise to various types of absorption
signatures Second and very much related to the cid12rst but perhaps of more
immediate interest to the community interested in galaxy evolution per se
what can one infer about the evolution of normal cid12eld galaxies using the pres-
ence of absorption rather than cid13ux density in some observed bandpass as
the selection criterion I will argue that once the selection function of the
absorbing galaxies is understood absorptionselected galaxies can be used
to understand the overall evolution of cid12eld galaxies to redshifts far beyond
where an apparent magnitude limited sample breaks down and can be used
to examine the galaxy luminosity function in a potentially much less biased
manner even in the redshift range of overlap between the methods
Charles C Steidel
From the point of view of those of us working in the cid12eld of QSO absorp-
tion lines the most basic motivation for the kind of study described below is
to provide a context in which all of the rich detail that will come out of the
present and future absorption line studies can be understood and assimilated
by those outside of the cid12eld From the point of view of the galaxy evolution
community the methods represent an independent approach to examining the
evolution of cid12eld galaxies with redshift and the means to extend cid12eld galaxy
redshift surveys including of course the accompanying detailed physics
accessible only through the absorption lines well beyond z   Because
many of the results I will discuss have been summarized recently elsewhere
Steidel  Steidel et al   Steidel and Dickinson  I will
devote most of the discussion in this article to new results on the gaseous
structure of absorbing galaxies and on the dependence of extended gaseous
envelopes on galaxy properties
 Establishing the Selection Function
 Observational Methods and Biases
As discussed in more detail elsewhere see above references we use as our ab-
sorption selection criterion the Mg II cid21cid21  doublet with rest equiv-
alent width W
A because the statistics are well-known for the entire
cid23
redshift range  cid20 z cid20  Steidel  Sargent  and because it turns
out to be a very ecid11ective tracer of H I gas that has NH I
cid24
cid0
for this reason we usually refer to the sample as being gas cross-section se-
lected at an ecid11ective H I threshold that corresponds to gas with cid28
cid24
the Lyman continuum and so the sample could equally well be described as
selected by the presence of a Lyman limit system LLS It turns out that
the redshift path density dNdz for such systems is consistent with no evolu-
tion in comoving total crosssection ie the product of the space density
of the absorbers and the ecid11ective mean crosssection of individual absorbers
remains constant over the whole redshift range observed this fact becomes
very useful in deducing eg luminosity functions and space densities of the
galaxies as a function of redshift see x The distinct advantages of an
absorptionselected galaxy sample from the point of view of understanding
cid12eld galaxy evolution are detailed in Steidel et al 
Before summarizing the results of our completed survey for absorption-
selected galaxies at z cid20  it is worth making some general comments on the
technique used and possible biases inherent in the method We have adopted a
strategy similar in some respects to the one used in the seminal study of Mg II
absorbing galaxies by Bergeron  Boisscid19e   we obtain deep continuum
images for our survey they are taken over a very wide wavelength baseline
from the visual to the Kband of the cid12elds of the QSOs and essentially begin
our search for the absorber at the position of the QSO and work our way out
in angular separation
The Nature and Evolution of AbsorptionSelected Galaxies
We wish to emphasize that provided one obtains spectra of the candi-
date galaxies near the QSO sight line the search strategy adopted is in no
way biased against discovering nonabsorbing galaxies in other words one
is just as likely to identify a putative population of non-absorbing galaxies
by searching in cid12elds in which absorption is known to be present as where it
is not  if they are there they will be found Nevertheless in our study we
have included with our sample of  absorber cid12elds chosen to have Mg II
absorption with W
cid21 
A and  cid20 z cid20  about  QSO cid12elds in which
cid23
no Mg II absorption is present over the same range of redshift These con-
trol cid12elds have the obvious advantage that if no ob jects are seen close to
the line of sight no galaxy spectroscopy is necessary to resolve any confusion
about the presence of an interloper ie a galaxy close to the line of sight
but producing no absorption For the faint galaxy spectroscopy part of the
program we have made every attempt to obtain spectra of all detected ob-
jects within cid24 
of the QSO corresponding to cid24 h
kpc at the typical
cid0
redshift of the survey and often we have obtained spectra of several ob jects
per cid12eld at larger angular separations This search radius was adopted largely
from experience if it had turned out to be necessary to go to larger radii to
cid12nd a galaxy at the absorption line redshift then we would have extended the
search What we have found is the nearest galaxy with a redshift matching
that of the absorption system and in several cases we have found evidence
for galaxy groups not surprising since most presentday galaxies reside in
groups In any individual case therefore one cannot prove that the iden-
ticid12ed ob ject is the absorberit could be a galaxy at the same redshift but
larger impact parameter However as will be described below we see very
signicid12cant correlations of the identicid12ed galaxy properties with the absorption
line properties and a remarkable absence of interloper galaxies at redshifts
dicid11erent from that of the absorption so that it is clear beyond almost all
reasonable doubt that the adopted strategy has succeeded in cid12nding the ac-
tual absorber Similarly we cannot go incid12nitely faint in either the imaging or
the spectroscopy so that the possibility would always exist that the true
absorber is a hopelessly faint ob ject perhaps situated directly on top of the
QSO see eg York et al  Yanny  York  however this too can
be rejected in a statistical sense because we have found a galaxy at the right
redshift in every case without reaching extremely faint levels although the
identicid12ed galaxies do in fact represent a very wide range in absolute luminos-
ity and as will be detailed below the galaxy luminosities the distribution of
pro jected impact parameters and the observed absorption line characteristics
form a remarkably coherent relationship

 The Nature of the Absorbing Galaxies z cid20 
As stated in x many of the results of the survey have been presented else-
where and for lack of space in the current contribution we refer the interested
reader to those references for more details We concern ourselves here primar-
ily with what types of galaxies are represented in a sample selected by metal
line absorption It has turned out that the Kband data has been extremely
important to an interpretation of the results of the absorbing galaxy survey
initially the purpose of the nearIR data was to get an idea about the extent
to which the observed restframe B band luminosities constructed from our
optical data
were biased by current rates of star formation It turns out
however see x that it is the K luminosity that is a much more robust
predictor of a galaxys potential to produce detectable absorption The wide
color baseline also allows one to classify galaxy morphological really spec-
troscopic types which are extremely useful in the absence of HSTresolution
images for every cid12eld
First the widely cited conclusion of Bergeron  Boisscid19e  that only
bright galaxies are absorbers turns out not to be completely accurate in
view of a much larger sample while the absorbers have a mean luminosity of
about L
and L
where these refer to restframe luminosities the
cid3
cid3
actual range of luminosity spans more than a factor of  with the faintest
identicid12ed absorber having L
cid25 L
 The spectra and the opticalIR
cid3
colors of the absorbing galaxies suggest that the sample is drawn from the
ful l range of galaxy spectroscopic types from very blue ob jects with the colors
or presentday latetype spirals and Im galaxies to ob jects which have the
colors and spectra of completely unevolved elliptical galaxies see Figure 
There is no evidence for any tendency for the absorbing galaxies to have
particularly high star formation rates on average As can be seen from Figure
 the average absorber maintains the restframe B cid0 K color of an Sb
spiral for the full range of redshifts observed This is consistent with a cid24
constant rate of star formation for the absorbing galaxy population as a
whole since at least z cid24  We also see no evidence for luminosity evolution
of the population in either restframe B or restframe K over the same
redshift range see Steidel et al  Steidel  Dickinson  One of the
most surprising conclusions see also x below is that galaxies of similar K
luminosities but with widely dicid11ering current star formation rates appear to
have extended gaseous envelopes that are indistinguishable The implications
of this fact will be discussed in x
It is important for the purposes of obtaining accurate luminosity distributions
to make the appropriate kcorrections to reach restframe absolute magnitudes
for example simply using an observed R magnitude with no bandpass correction
to obtain MR can lead to relative errors of up to  magnitude for galaxies in
the redshift range of interest
The Nature and Evolution of AbsorptionSelected Galaxies

sorbing galaxies versus redshift Note that the galaxies appear to represent the full
range of spectroscopic types but have an average color equivalent to a presentday
Sb galaxy across the whole redshift range
 The Geometry of the Extended Gas and the Absorber
Selection Function
The advantage of a large sample of absorbing galaxies is that it begins to
become feasible to extract signicid12cant relationships between the gaseous sizes
of the galaxies the galaxy luminosity and the absorption line properties
Establishing these statistical trends together with the determination of the
nature of any nonabsorbing population is crucial to inserting the absorb-
ing galaxy population into the context of general cid12eld galaxy evolution For
example it has been somewhat of a tradition over the last cid24  years to
calculate the expected sizes of QSO absorbers of various classes based on
knowledge of dNdz and assumptions about the galaxy luminosity function
luminosity size scaling relation and gasphase geometry It is now possible
to turn the whole problem around and infer based on direct observations
all of the relations that were always assumed and directly derive the galaxy
luminosity function If we understand what selection function is in ecid11ect for
gas cross-section selected galaxies it is possible to produce a cid12eld galaxy
luminosity function directly that is almost completely independent of those
produced from the apparent magnitude selected surveys of recent years see
eg Lilly  Songaila et al  Colless 
The usual assumption has been that the gaseous sizes of galaxies would
obey the Holmberg  relation R
 and the luminosities are
Charles C Steidel
drawn from a Schechter  luminosity function On the basis of a subset of
the current sample we made the claim that the absorbers followed a relation
that is closer to R
Steidel  this exponent often called cid12  is a
very important number to determine because it controls the extent to which
the gas cross-section selection criterion depends upon luminosity and hence
it determines the ecid11ective volume probed by an absorption line survey as a
function of galaxy luminosity We have undertaken a new determination of
cid12  using the following method
We include all galaxies with redshifts whether they have produced ab-
sorption or not in the survey cid12elds We then assume spherical halos of
gas obeying the relation R  R
 searching for the best values of
cid3
cid3
cid12
cid3
and cid12  sub ject to the following criteria First we minimize the number of
galaxies that fall on the wrong side of the R cid0 L curve ie minimize the
number of absorbing galaxies falling outside the curve and the nonabsorbing
galaxies falling inside the curve and we also insist that the distribution of
normalized impact parameters D
L where D
is the observed
impact parameter and R
L is the expected halo extent for a galaxy of
the same luminosity as the observed galaxy is consistent with the expected
radial distribution which should be nD
for the assumed ge-
ometry This cid12tting process results in two slightly dicid11erent relationships
  h
and RL
  h
 with the for-
cid0
cid3
cid0
cid3
mer having smaller scatter The halo sizeK luminosity relationship is plotted
in Figure  the most important point to notice is how amazingly well the sim-
ple model actually describes the data and how poorly a model with cid12  
cid12ts the data Note that under the bestcid12t curve there are essentially no
nonabsorbing galaxies This results in two very important conclusions cid12rst
if a galaxy is brighter than M
 cid0 or about L
 and it falls within
cid3
 of a QSO sight line it will produce detectable Mg II absorption  this
means that inside that radius the covering fraction of the absorbing gas is
unity independent of galaxy spectroscopicmorphological type Secondly this
same absence of nonabsorbers below the curve means that the assumption
of spherical halos must be close to the truth For example if the absorption
were all produced by extended thin disks one would expect statistically that
 of the galaxies within RL
 would produce no detectable absorption
see also x below
On the other hand despite the surprising regularity of the above re-
sults there is evidence that the existence of extended gas capable of producing
absorption depends on environment at least in extreme cases Bechtold 
Ellingson  have shown that galaxies located in the same clusters as
QSOs generally do not produce detectable MgII absorption However cluster
cores have a very small cross-section on the sky so it is not surprising that
in a collection of  or so random lines of sight we did not probe any such
environments Again we already have evidence that many of the absorbers
are members of groups but there is clearly much work to be done in estab-

describing the data
lishing the detailed environments of the galaxies and any possible ecid11ect on
the absorbing cross-sections or halo gas kinematics
 Dependence of Absorption Line Properties on Galactocentric
Distance
Lanzetta and Bowen  have noted a signicid12cant inverse correlation be-
tween the observed equivalent width of the Mg II absorption lines and the
impact parameter between the QSO sight line and the centroid of the ab-
sorbing galaxy from the sample of Bergeron  Boisscid19e  Since it is fairly
well-established from highresolution observations that the Mg II equivalent
width is proportional to the number of individual velocity components eg
Petit-Jean  Bergeron  it is natural to try to obtain a radial cloud
density distribution function from the observed correlation Unfortunately a
larger data set reveals that the situation is probably much more complicated
the data for our z cid20  sample are plotted in Figure  Note that most if not
all of the very high equivalent width systems turn out to be damped Lyman
alpha absorbers with impact parameters smaller than h
Most of
cid0
We have no direct information on the H I column density for most of the z  
absorbers note also that many of the very strong systems are taken from the
Charles C Steidel
the correlation is produced by these systems where galactic rotation almost
certainly enters into the observed kinematics see Art Wolfes contribution
to these proceedings Note also that al l of the known damped systems have
D cid20 h
kpc but that several of them have very small Mg II equivalent
cid0
widths some of them would not make it into a Mg II selected sample with
A  Figure  emphasizes the need to explore the detailed relation
cid23
of the absorption line kinematics to the actual galaxy morphology and sky
orientation this can be done to z cid24  with HST images in combination with
high-resolution spectroscopy see x
Fig  Plot showing the Mg II equivalent width versus impact parameter Points
surrounded by circles are known damped Lyman cid11 absorbers The anti-correlation
of line strength and impact parameter is signicid12cant at the cid27 level
 The Galaxy Luminosity Function
Armed with a very robust empirical determination of the scaling of galaxy gas
cross-sections with luminosity one can then turn the observed distribution
of galaxy luminosities into a true luminosity distribution provided that the
absorption systems themselves have been drawn from a statistically homoge-
neous sample simply by weighting the histogram by R
L which for the
K luminosity would be L
 This cross-section weighting is equiva-

lent to dividing by the ecid11ective volume probed by an absorption line survey
literature and are not part of our unbiased sample although we have re-observed
all of them as part of our survey In a sample the size of ours cid24  absorbers

The Nature and Evolution of AbsorptionSelected Galaxies
as a function of luminosity directly analogous to the selection function in an
apparent magnitude selected redshift survey However note that the volume
probed in an absorption-selected survey is much more weakly dependent on
luminosity L
rather than L
 and therefore one is actually sampling
the full range in galaxy luminosities at a given redshift much more uniformly
in an absorptionselected sample The absorbing galaxy Kband luminosity
function is is shown in Figure  note that it is quite well-represented by a
Schechter luminosity function with faint end slope cid11 cid25 cid0 to M

The absolute normalization of the luminosity function is obtained from the
same relationship that has traditionally been used to calculate R

Here dNdz  RL and L
are empirically determined and cid8

cid3
by assuming that a Schechter function which cid12ts the observed luminosity
distribution applies
We note that the shape of the restframe B luminosity function is quite
dicid11erent see Steidel et al  Steidel  Dickinson  resembling a
Gaussian rather than a Schechter function We have attributed this dicid11erence
to the fact that the population of intrinsically small faint M
 star forming
faint blue galaxies which contribute signicid12cantly to the cid12eld galaxy lu-
minosity function even at relatively bright values of M
 apparently do not
possess signicid12cant gaseous envelopes This is further evidence that the exis-
tence of the gaseous halos is dependent on galaxy mass independent of star
formation rate In fact we can see from the absorber luminosity function that
the luminositycross-section scaling relation derived above must break down
for luminosities smaller than L cid25 L
 otherwise we would have found
either many more very faint absorbers the relatively weak dependence on
luminosity and the knowledge that the luminosity function is rising at faint
magnitudes requires this or more blank cid12elds More work that explores the
transition region of the luminosity function at faint intrinsic luminosities
from absorber to nonabsorber would be very important in establishing the
natureorigin of the absorbing gas

 Some Preliminary HST Imaging Results
We Steidel Dickinson Meyer  Sembach have obtained a very deep
 s image with WFPC- on board HST of the cid12eld of the QSO C
 which has  absorbing galaxies along a single line of sight allowing us to
directly observe the galaxy morphology and orientations with respect to the
QSO sight line First of all we are very encouraged that the actual observed
morphological types match very well the types we had assigned the galaxies
on the basis of the spectra and opticalIR colors in this cid12eld ranging from
SdIm to S The z   absorber is clearly a nearly edge-on mid-type
spiral but it also produces a Lyman cid11 absorption line with N H I   cid2
cid0
on the basis of our FOS spectrum The galaxy has a pro jected separa-
tion from the line of sight of h
kpc but after correction for inclination
cid0
if one insists that the absorption arises in the disk the minimum disk extent
would have to be cid24 h
kpc in a galaxy with a luminosity of only L
cid0
cid3
Despite intensive spectroscopy the identicid12cation of the z
  system
which produces a damped Lyman alpha line with N H I    cid2 
cid0
remains ambiguous the galaxy responsible must be considerably fainter than
The Nature and Evolution of AbsorptionSelected Galaxies 
cid24 L
 This may serve to caution us against assuming that all high column
cid3
density gas must be concid12ned to disks of luminous galaxies
The  galaxies producing metal lines along this sight line have impact
parameters ranging from  cid0 h
kpc and on the basis of our FOS spectra
cid0
there is a clear trend for the equivalent width ratio WC IVWMg II to
increase with galactocentric distance More data of this kind will clearly be
interesting in investigating the actual ionization structure of the halos see
also Bergeron  Lanzetta 
 Absorbing Galaxies at Higher z
One of the advantages of an absorptionselected sample is that the galaxies
can be followed using identical selection criteria well beyond z   where
faint apparent magnitudes for ob jects of normal luminosity and lack of strong
spectroscopic features cause conventional cid12eld galaxy surveys to break down
We have recently begun a survey designed to follow the absorption-selected
galaxies to z cid24  see Steidel  Dickinson  for details in order to estab-
lish the cid12eld galaxy luminosity function using techniques described above at
hz i   Insisting on spectroscopic completeness would of course encounter
the same dicid14culties as the cid12eld galaxy redshift surveys however for the ab-
sorption selected sample we make use of very strong predictions based on
the z   sample on color angular separation apparent magnitude etc
together with a priori redshift information so that evolution of the galaxy
population producing absorption can be evaluated using deep imaging one
optical passband and one near-IR K passband alone This allows us to
establish the galaxy luminosity function over a signicid12cant range of intrinsic
luminosity in redshift regimes that are unexplored by the cid12eld galaxy redshift
surveys Our preliminary results suggest that no spectacular evolution is oc-
curring even to z cid24  in the cid12eld galaxy population and in fact we have
been able to establish that the space density of the normal Hubble sequence
galaxies that appear to dominate the absorption cross-section remains con-
stant to within cid24  Steidel  Dickinson  and that there has been
at most modest passive evolution of the stellar populations here again the
Kband data are crucial for epoch-to-epoch comparisons over that entire
redshift range Taken together with the results of the cid12eld galaxy redshift
surveys a scenario in which relatively luminous galaxies have been in place
since very high redshifts but where the population of very blue galaxies is
undergoing substantial evolution even at relatively modest redshifts seems to
be indicated A great deal of work is called for in understanding the possibly
We also note that the known damped Lyman cid11 systems in our z   sample show
a marginally signicid12cant tendency to be fainter and bluer than the Mg II selected
sample as a whole The mean luminosity is only cid24 L

intimate connection between the halo gas supply of the luminous galaxies
which we see in absorption and the rapidly evolving faint blue galaxy
population see x
Absorption line selection has clear advantages for cid13agging the sites of
known very high redshift ob jects since LLSs are now known far beyond
z   in principle the same selection criteria can be used at these extreme
redshifts as at lower redshift to target searches for the absorbing galaxies At
z   one can take advantage of a guaranteed spectroscopic feature in the
spectrum of any ob ject forming starsa discontinuity at the rest frame Ly-
man limit of the galaxy redshifted into the optical portion of the spectrum
One need not make any assumptions about the fraction of ionizing photons
escaping a young galaxy or even the details of the intrinsic spectral energy
distribution of the galaxy as a pronounced discontinuity will be present from
consideration of the opacity of the IGM Lyman cid11 forest blanketing plus
optically thick intervening clouds alone see Madau  We were able to
take advantage of the expected characteristic colors of ob jects in the red-
shift range  cid20 z cid20  in a custom photometric system U
GR to identify
the ob ject which may be producing the damped Lyman cid11 absorption system
at z   toward Qcid0 Steidel  Hamilton  and possibly to
identify a group or cluster of ob jects associated with it Steidel  Hamilton
 Giavalisco et al  Max Pettini and I have been continuing this
program in an ecid11ort to establish the detectability of other LLS-selected high
redshift galaxies in the same redshift range Steidel  Pettini  in total
we have identicid12ed  out of  of the systems observed including Qcid0
and found many z   galaxy candidates that may be associated with the
absorbers or with the background QSOs Both putative absorbing galaxies
have luminosities only slightly in excess of L
 The relatively low detection
cid3
rate compared to the lower redshift surveys may be ascribed to the fact that
our current detection limits only allows us to detect galaxies of luminosity
cid3
 At present the population of absorbers at z   is largely uncon-
cid24
strained and a luminosity distribution consistent with the lower z absorbers
cannot be ruled out but observations going cid0 magnitudes deeper quite
possible with cid0 m telescopes will be very telling Also of interest of
course is the galaxy environment and morphology at such early times These
can also be addressed currently using HST and large ground-based telescopes
The Nature and Evolution of AbsorptionSelected Galaxies 
 What Does It All Mean
A general result about which we can all rest assured at this point is that
the QSO metal line systems at least those that are optically thick in the
Lyman continuum see Ken Lanzettas contribution for extensions to lower
H I column density regimes are produced by normal galaxies and therefore
in studying the absorption line systems one is justicid12ed in claiming that we
are learning about the history of such ob jects However the absorbers ex-
hibit at least to z cid24  or so a very large range in star formation rate
color luminosity and from the limited data that exist morphological type
This means that when we talk about evolution in metallicity dust content
kinematics etc we are talking about a very wide range of galaxy types and
we must keep this in mind  it may well be that the wide range in metallicity
observed at z
 Pettini  recid13ects very dicid11erent evolutionary histories
cid24
for various sub-populations of galaxies
On the other hand the one property of the of the galaxies that seems
to be most important in determining the size and geometry of the absorbing
gas is the galaxy mass and the geometry and sizes inferred are remarkably
regular in nature The picture of spherical halos with a cutocid11 near h
cid0
kpc is no doubt a tremendous over-simplicid12cation of the true situation how-
ever again the data indicate that something is regulating the extended gas
distribution to a very large extent That the star formation rate does not
appear to be important to the nature of the halos I believe argues very
strongly against a model in which the extended gas is produced by outcid13ow
from the central regions at least one which is powered by star formation as
in models of giant galactic fountains Rather the data seem to point to
incid13ow as the dominant source of gas and the relatively short timescales for
the existence of gas in the extended halos because of cloudcloud collisions
and dissipation means that the incid13ow must occur continuously over at least
a Hubble time the time period over which we observe the absorption What
is a self-consistent physical picture that can explain the regularity of the gas
at an ecid11ective H I column density threshold of cid24 
 and make it
cid0
weakly dependent on mass alone I suspect that the link is in the pressure
and pressure gradient of the medium concid12ning the cid24 
K clouds in which
case there would be a characteristic radius at which the pressure is sucid14cient
to make the density of the infalling material just optically thick in the Lyman
continuum in the presence of the prevailing UV radiation cid12eld whereas the
gas distribution will extend at lower column densities to much larger galac-
tocentric radii see Lanzetta  This pressure if it is due to some hot
medium is expected to be dependent only on the overall size of the potential
well hence the mass dependence and roughly spherical geometry Whether
or not this picture is correct there is clearly a great deal of theoretical work
to be done in understanding the physics of the absorbing regions
One cid12nal comment it is not just from the new generation of -m tele-
scopes and high resolution spectrographs that the ma jor advances will come
 Charles C Steidel
in our cid12eld It is clear that the picture one can assemble from combining
the information obtained from the QSO spectroscopy and from HST and
groundbased imaging and spectroscopy of the same galaxies will allow us to
overcome the limitations imposed by photon starvation and actually under-
stand how normal galaxies have evolved from the epoch of their formation
to the present
