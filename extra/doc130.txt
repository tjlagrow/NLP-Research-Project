ABSTRACT
The evolution in the comoving space density of the global average galaxy star formation rate SFR out to
a redshift around unity is well established Beyond z  1 there is growing evidence that this evolution is at
or even increasing contrary to early indications of a turnover Some recent analyses of z  6 photometric
dropouts are suggestive of a decline from z  3 to z  6 but there is still very little constraint on the extent
of dust obscuration at such high redshifts In less than a decade numerous measurements of galaxy SFR density
spanning z  0 to as high as z  6 have rapidly broadened our understanding of galaxy evolution and a summary
of existing SFR density measurements is presented here This global star formation history compilation is found
to be consistent to within factors of about three over essentially the entire range 0  z  6 and it can be used to
constrain the evolution of the luminosity function LF for star forming SF galaxies The LF evolution for SF
galaxies has been previously explored using optical source counts as well as radio source counts at 14 GHz and
a well-known degeneracy between luminosity evolution L  1  zQ and density evolution   1  zP 
is found Combining the constraints from the global SFR density evolution with those from the 14 GHz radio
source counts at sub-millijansky levels allows this degeneracy to be broken and a best tting evolutionary form
to be established The preferred evolution in a H0  70 M  03   07 cosmology from these combined
constraints is Q  270  060 P  015  060

1 INTRODUCTION
The increase by an order of magnitude in the global co-
moving space density of galaxy star formation rate SFR from
z  0 to z  1 has been well established by numerous mea-
surements in recent years eg Wilson et al 2002 Haarsma
et al 2000 Flores et al 1999 Cowie et al 1999 Hogg et al
1998 Hammer et al 1997 Lilly et al 1996 see also the list
of references in Tables 2 and 4 A large body of data has now
been collected to measure this evolution and the shape of the
star formation SF history at higher redshifts now approach-
ing z  6 As will be seen within measurement uncertainties
and the limitations of the various surveys used this large het-
erogeneous dataset is highly consistent over the entire redshift
range 0  z  6 and constrains the SFR density to within a
factor of about three at most redshifts
With such a wealth of measurements now available the evo-
lution of the global galaxy SFR density can be used as a robust
constraint on various simulations and semianalytic models of
galaxy evolution This is already being pursued by many au-
thors eg Somerville et al 2001 Pei et al 1999 and tan-
talising indications about the details of galaxy evolution are
suggested as a result such as collisionally induced star forma-
tion being favoured as the dominant mode of galaxy evolution
as opposed to steady ongoing star formation Somerville et al
2001 The richness of the available measurements offers a very
strong constraint that must be met by such models but full ad-
vantage has not yet been taken of this important resource
To illustrate this point a compilation drawn from the liter-
ature of SFR density measurements as a function of redshift
is presented here and constraints on the evolving luminosity
function of star forming galaxies are derived Together with
constraints from radio source counts the SF history data allow
the degeneracy between rates of luminosity and density evolu-
tion to be broken and a robust constraint on both is derived
The details of the measurements from the literature are pre-
sented in  2 and evolving luminosity functions for star form-
ing galaxies are presented in the context of the SF history dia-
gram in  3 In  4 the SF history compilation is used in con-
junction with the radio source counts to constrain the form for
the evolving LF The results are discussed in  5 and conclu-
sions summarised in  6 A at Lambda cosmology is assumed
throughout as indicated by numerous recent measurements
with H0  70 km s1 Mpc1 M  03   07 eg
Spergel et al 2003
2 THE MEASUREMENTS
Measurements of galaxy SFR density have been compiled
from the literature converted to a common cosmology and
SFR calibration and corrected for dust obscuration where nec-
essary in a common fashion This is necessary in order to
consistently compare measurements made at different wave-
lengths The star formation calibrations chosen are presented
in Table 1 all assuming a Salpeter 1955 initial mass function
IMF and mass range 01  M  100 M The H UV
and far infrared FIR calibrations adopted are those from Ken-
nicutt 1998 The 14 GHz SFR calibration chosen is that of
Bell 2003 derived to be consistent with the FIR calibration
from Kennicutt 1998 This calibration gives SFRs lower by
about a factor of two than the calibration of Condon 1992 for
logL14W Hz1  218 As luminosity decreases the SFRs
approach those of Condon 1992 and become higher for lumi-
nosities below logL14W Hz1  205
21 Cosmology conversion
The conversion from the originally chosen cosmology to that
assumed here is as follows Since in a at universe comoving
volume is proportional to comoving distance cubed Vc  D3
A M Hopkins
the comoving volume between redshifts z  z and z  z
c z  z Since luminosity
Vcz z  D3
is proportional to comoving distance squared L  D2
c  then
the SFR density for a given redshift range assuming that all
galaxies lie at the central redshift
c z  z  D3
 
Vcz z 
c z  z  D3
c z  z
So in order to convert from one cosmology to another this ex-
pression is evaluated for both cosmologies at the appropriate
redshift and the ratio used as the conversion factor This is sim-
ilarly described by Ascasibar et al 2002 and an equivalent
form used by Hogg 2002
In the case of converting luminosity functions LFs the con-
version of the luminosity and volume components need to be
done separately When applying a luminosity-dependent obscu-
ration correction as described below the LF being used must
rst be corrected for the cosmology to ensure that the obscura-
tion corrections applied correspond to the correct luminosities
in the nal cosmology To convert the LF the characteristic lu-
minosity and the volume normalisation factors L and  in
the Schechter 1976 or Saunders et al 1990 parameterisa-
tions are converted This is done in a similar fashion to that
described above using the proportionalities already given
This procedure for converting cosmologies with the coarse
assumption that all galaxies lie at the central redshift is only
approximate The expected uncertainties introduced by this as-
sumption though even in the case of the measurements span-
ning the largest redshift ranges are at most of the order of 10
which is small compared to the factors of two to three by which
the actual measurements may differ from each other as seen
22 Obscuration corrections
Obscuration by dust is well known to affect measurements
of galaxy luminosity at UV and optical wavelengths Correct-
ing for this effect is not always straightforward however since
measurements of an obscuration sensitive parameter such as
the Balmer decrement or UV spectral slope are not always easy
to obtain It has become a standard procedure to make an ap-
proximate obscuration correction by assuming an average level
of expected obscuration such as AV  1 mag and uniformly
correcting all objects This procedure has the advantage that
it is straightforward to apply either to a luminosity function or
a luminosity density being simply a scaling factor Recently
though it has been shown that galaxies with high luminosities
or SFRs tend on average to suffer greater obscuration than
faint or low SFR systems Hopkins et al 2001a Sullivan et al
2001 Perez-Gonzalez et al 2003 Afonso et al 2003 Hop-
kins et al 2003c but see also Buat et al 2002 Correcting for
such a luminosity-dependent or SFR-dependent effect is not
as straightforward as for a common obscuration though since a
knowledge of the full LF is necessary It is further complicated
by the fact that the specic relation describing the luminosity-
dependent effect is strongly dependent on the selection criteria
of the sample being investigated Afonso et al 2003 Hopkins
et al 2003c
These issues are not insurmountable however and both a
common obscuration and a luminosity-dependent obscuration
are explored below In some cases actual measurements of the
obscuration such as the Balmer decrement have already been
used by the original authors with obscuration curves consistent
with those assumed below to correct the LFs or the SFR density
estimate These results are always used in favour of invoking
less reliable average corrections It must also be emphasised
that although different average obscurations are assumed be-
low for the common obscuration correction depending on the
wavelength used to select the sample being corrected these are
not necessarily inconsistent They are based on observed aver-
age obscurations for similarly selected samples in the literature
Some issues regarding the use of average obscuration correc-
tions are discussed further below but it should be clear that for
surveys that detect only relatively low obscuration systems for
example a relatively small average obscuration correction is
appropriate The corresponding LF derived from such a sample
is then used by tting a Schechter function for example to
infer the details of brighter but more heavily obscured systems
that fall below the detection threshold as well as systems below
the survey limit that are fainter and possibly less obscured
In all obscuration corrections used herein for emission line
SFR measurements H H OII the galactic obscuration
curve from Cardelli et al 1989 is used For continuum mea-
surements primarily UV wavelengths from 1500 A to 2800 A
the starburst obscuration curve from Calzetti et al 2000 is
used see also Calzetti 2001 When applying a common ob-
scuration correction AH  10 mag is assumed for emission
line measurements often found as the average obscuration to
H emission in samples of local galaxies eg Kennicutt 1992
Hopkins et al 2003c Similarly for UV-selected samples a
typical obscuration is found to be AV  10 mag eg Sulli-
van et al 2000 Tresse et al 1996 although this value is based
on galactic obscuration curves rather than the starburst curves
from Calzetti assumed here To convert this to the appropriate
AV for the Calzetti curve the mean Balmer decrement corre-
sponding to this value is rst inferred The analysis of Sullivan
et al 2000 is used as a reference here and those authors base
their obscuration corrections on the Seaton 1979 galactic ob-
scuration curve Since R  AV EB  V  and R  32 is
assumed the mean value of AV  10 from Sullivan et al
2000 gives EB  V   0313 But EB  V  also depends
on the choice of obscuration curve
EB  V  
logf Hf H286
04kH  kH
Calzetti et al 1996 Here f Hf H is the Balmer decre-
ment and kH  kH is the difference between the values
of the obscuration curve at the wavelengths of H and H The
latter quantity is 119 for the Seaton 1979 curve and gives a
Balmer decrement of 403 corresponding to the mean AV  1
For the Calzetti et al 2000 curve kHkH  127 and
this Balmer decrement gives EB  V gas  0293 similar to
the above value Indeed AV gas  kV EB  V gas  119
with kV   405 a little higher than the 1 mag from the
galactic curve To correct the stellar continuum the relation
EB  V star  044EB  V gas is used Calzetti et al
2000 The subscript notation gas and star refer to neb-
ular and stellar continuum obscuration respectively Finally
AV star  044kV EB  V gas  052 Note that in Equa-
tion 2 it is necessary to use k appropriate for nebular obscu-
ration Equation 4 of Calzetti et al 2000 Hence AV  10
for the Seaton 1979 curve becomes AV star  052 for the
Calzetti 2001 curve It would simplify comparisons such as
this to have obscuration sensitive quantities presented as ob-
servables such as Balmer decrement or UV spectral slope
These should be elementary to provide in addition to derived
On the evolution of star forming galaxies
values dependent on the chosen obscuration curve like AV and
EB  V 
To summarise when a common obscuration correction is
performed below emission line measurements are corrected us-
ing AH  10 and the Cardelli et al 1989 galactic obscu-
ration curve and continuum UV measurements are corrected
using AV star  052 and the Calzetti et al 2000 starburst
obscuration curve
It is interesting to note that an obscuration at the wavelength
of H of AH  10 mag corresponds to AV  122 us-
ing the galactic obscuration curve of Cardelli et al 1989 or
AV  129 using the curve of Seaton 1979 compared to
AV  10 using galactic obscuration curves found for UV se-
lected samples This observation is consistent with the expected
result that the average obscuration of galaxies selected at red-
der wavelengths around H can be greater than those selected
at UV wavelengths where the more heavily obscured systems
will not enter the sample This effect is seen quite strikingly
in the radio-selected sample of star forming galaxies analysed
by Afonso et al 2003 who nd systematically higher median
obscurations at all luminosities than in the optically selected
sample explored by Hopkins et al 2003c
The analysis of Massarotti et al 2001 in addition empha-
sises the important result that making obscuration corrections
based on an average observed AV or EB  V  will result in
an underestimate of the true measurement They explain that
the effective mean obscuration is larger than the mean of the
observed obscurations This implies that the SFR densities ob-
tained using the common obscuration corrections above will be
underestimates of the true SFR densities
The analyses of SFR-dependent obscuration Hopkins et al
2001a Sullivan et al 2001 Afonso et al 2003 Hopkins et
al 2003c clearly indicate that using such empirical trends to
make obscuration corrections should only be done in the ab-
sence of more direct measurements In the case of measure-
ments in the literature that have been obscuration corrected di-
rectly using Balmer decrements and obscuration curves consis-
tent with those adopted here these obscuration corrected re-
sults are taken directly with appropriate cosmology and SFR
calibration conversions where necessary Where no obscura-
tion correction has been made but an observed LF published an
SFR-dependent obscuration correction can be performed For
the form of this correction herein the relation between obscu-
ration and SFR from Hopkins et al 2001a is adopted after
conversion to the presently assumed cosmology This relation
is illustrated briey for obscuration at the wavelength of H
as follows Objects with logLHW  33 or equivalently
SFRH  008 M yr1 are assumed to suffer no obscura-
tion Above this level the effect of obscuration increases to eg
a factor of 2 at an observed prior to obscuration correction
logLHW  341 corresponding to an apparent SFRH 
1 M yr1 This increases again to a factor of 5 at an observed
logLHW  364 or SFRH  198 M yr1 and con-
tinues increasing indenitely for higher luminosities compare
with Figures 2a and 3a of Hopkins et al 2001a
It is important to note that this form appears to be appropriate
for optically selected samples particularly those restricted to
higher equivalent width systems A similar relation was found
by Sullivan et al 2001 although Perez-Gonzalez et al 2003
nds a relation with a steeper slope and Hopkins et al 2003c
show that when lower equivalent width systems enter the sam-
ple the median obscurations for a given luminosity or SFR can
be notably higher In a radio-selected sample free from obscu-
ration based selection biases Afonso et al 2003 nd a rela-
tion with signicantly higher median obscurations for a given
SFR compared to optically selected samples see discussion in
Hopkins et al 2003c Since the samples to be corrected herein
are UV or H selected the form from Hopkins et al 2001a
was deemed appropriate It should be noted that if other pub-
lished relations were used this would result in larger obscu-
ration corrections than applied here If a galactic obscuration
curve is used for the UV continuum corrections rather than that
of Calzetti et al 2000 the obscuration corrections for the UV
SFR density measurements would again be larger
23 OII SFR calibrations
The issue of SFR calibrations for OII luminosities is a com-
plex one
In particular the OII to H ux ratio of 045
Kennicutt 1992 1998 for local galaxies is now recognised to
be strongly luminosity-dependent Jansen et al 2001 as well
as having metallicity and obscuration dependencies Aragon-
Salamanca et al 2002 compared observed and obscuration
corrected OIIH line ux ratios in two different local galaxy
samples the H selected Universidad Complutense de Madrid
UCM survey Gallego et al 1996 and the B-band selected
Nearby Field Galaxy Survey NFGS Jansen et al 2001 They
nd that the luminosity dependence is primarily due to obscu-
ration effects and for the UCM survey the obscuration cor-
rected OIIH ratio has considerably smaller scatter than the
observed ratio with a median value close to unity The ob-
scuration corrected ratio is also largely independent of lumi-
nosity although they caution that sample selection effects still
need to be carefully accounted for Tresse et al 2002 explore
the OIIH ux ratio for different redshift ranges using the
Canada-France Redshift Survey CFRS They nd little evi-
dence for evolution in the luminosity dependence of the ob-
served ux ratio out to z  1 The important conclusion is that
an OIIH ux ratio appropriate to the sample given the sam-
ple selection effects should be chosen when converting OII
luminosities to H and to SFR
Of the OII-based SFR density estimators compiled here
Teplitz et al 2003 adopts the relation of Jansen et al 2001
in deriving the SFR density at z  09 and they comment that
the average value of the OIIH ratio is close to 045 for their
sample Hammer et al 1997 presents observed OII lumi-
nosity densities for the CFRS sample Over the redshift range
spanned by these measurements Tresse et al 2002 nd a me-
dian observed OIIH ratio of 046 for CFRS galaxies This
ratio is adopted here in converting the OII luminosity densities
of Hammer et al 1997 to SFR densities The OII-derived
SFR densities from Hogg et al 1998 assume the local ratio
of 045 although this is not constrained by independent esti-
mates for the sample used Since higher luminosities will dom-
inate the sample at higher redshifts lower OIIH ux ratios
may be more appropriate at high redshifts This would act to
steepen the slope of the SFR density with redshift dened by
these points
24 The compilation
The collection of measurements from the literature is pre-
sented in Table 2 with  given for both methods of obscuration
correction common and luminosity-dependent The same val-
ues appear in both these columns for measurements not requir-
ing obscuration correction IR sub-mm and radio or for those
A M Hopkins
where Balmer decrement measurements were used directly by
the original authors to correct the data prior to deriving lumi-
nosity functions This table also indicates the effective factors
used in performing the cosmology correction from the original
reference and in both types of obscuration correction A total
of 33 references provide data here giving a total of 66 points
measured in the z  plane These are shown in Figure 1
Of these points 41 have measured obscuration corrections are
able to have an SFR-dependent obscuration correction applied
or have no need of obscuration corrections and these results
are shown in Figure 2 Adjacent data points from the OII de-
rived measurements of Hogg et al 1998 are not independent
having been constructed in overlapping bins
The LF parameters where available are given in Table 3 af-
ter converting to the cosmology assumed here This table in-
dicates whether the published LF includes obscuration correc-
tions based on observed obscuration estimates or not If not
integrations over these LFs are performed in order to apply the
SFR-dependent obscuration correction detailed above A xed
luminosity range is used for these integrations depending on
the wavelength at which the LF is estimated For H LFs the
integration is over 300  logLHW  400 For UV LFs
the range is 150  logLUVW Hz1  25 For 14 GHz
LFs the range is over 150  logL14W Hz1  280
The data from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey
GOODS Giavalisco et al 2004 which include the two high-
est redshift UV-based data points come from an integration of
their derived luminosity functions that has an imposed abso-
lute magnitude cutoff brighter than the limits assumed here for
the other surveys As a result the points corresponding to this
survey shown in Figure 1 are actually lower limits to the total
SFR density that would have been derived with the luminosity
range indicated above Integration of the LF over a magnitude
range comparable with the above luminosity range is likely to
increase these estimates by a factor of two or so This would
improve the level of consistency with the high redshift sub-mm
measurement and the evolving radio luminosity function re-
sults see  3 below It is worth emphasising here as an aside
that many high-redshift studies of the comoving SFR density
some of which are discussed further in  52 below impose a
luminosity or magnitude limit on the integration of the LF to
avoid strong biases from the assumption of a faint end slope
poorly constrained by observation When comparing measure-
ments in the literature it is obviously desirable to be consistent
in the extent of the LF integrations being compared as depend-
ing on the limits chosen the results can vary by factors of two
to four or so
A common parameterisation for the evolution of the SFR
density with redshift is a simple power law
  1  z
for z  1 where  has been estimated in the literature to range
from around 15 Cowie et al 1999 to 39 Lilly et al 1996
with most favoured values around 3 for an Einstein-de Sitter
EdS cosmology The meta-analysis of Hogg 2002 gives a
robust measurement of of   33 08 for an EdS cosmology
and a weighted mean t of   274  028 for the cosmology
assumed here Using the current data compilation restricted
to measurements for z  10 an ordinary least squares OLS
Isobe et al 1990 regression of log  on log1  z is per-
formed to estimate both  and log z  0 For the assump-
tion of a common obscuration this gives
log   310  025 log1  z  180  004
Although both overlapping binnings for the data of Hogg et
al 1998 are shown in Figure 1 only the independent bins at
z  02 04 06 08 10 have been used in this t This re-
sult is consistent with that of Hogg 2002 although somewhat
higher The main reason for this is that the measurements of
Mobasher et al 1999 have been neglected in the current com-
pilation
If that result is omitted from the analysis of Hogg
2002 a value of   315  029 would have been derived
highly consistent with the present estimate The measurements
of Mobasher et al 1999 are omitted here primarily because of
the signicant incompleteness affecting their estimates partic-
ularly for the higher redshift bin For the case of the luminosity-
dependent obscuration the OLS regression gives
log   329  026 log1  z  180  004
The consistency of these two results should not be too surpris-
ing given that the 14 GHz and FIR derived data remain un-
changed from one to the other Both these relations are pre-
sented as dot-dashed lines in Figures 1 and 2 respectively It
is worth emphasising the similarity though between many of
the data points at z  1 when corrected for obscuration using
the two different methods For these points the difference be-
tween the two different methods ranges from  20 Treyer
et al 1998 Tresse  Maddox 1998 where the SFR depen-
dent obscuration corrected value is lower than with the com-
mon obscuration to  30 Connolly et al 1997 the point
at z  075
25 Surface brightness dimming
The question of whether any given survey is complete over
the full range of galaxy sizes for each interval of xed lumi-
nosity is complex to address comprehensively In most cases
ux or ux density limits imposed in constructing source cata-
logues are effectively surface brightness thresholds witness the
so-called resolution correction made to radio galaxy source
counts eg Hopkins et al 2003a when constructed from peak
ux density selected samples to account for missing low sur-
face brightness sources Different methods used by different
authors to address or ignore this issue which affects both low
and high redshift samples may contribute to some extent to the
scatter in the values seen for the estimated SFR density at each
redshift
Photometric redshifts have been used with large deep sam-
ples of galaxies to estimate the SF history consistently over a
very broad redshift range Pascarelle et al 1998 Lanzetta et al
2002 The issue of correctly accounting for surface brightness
dimming is of particular concern with this method as a xed
ux limit corresponds to dramatically different surface bright-
ness limits at different redshifts and this can strongly bias the
inferred SF history results This problem is explored in detail by
Lanzetta et al 2002 in which the SFR intensity distribution
hx is introduced The evolution of hx is explored by as-
suming three different models one corresponding to luminosity
evolution one to a surface-density evolution and an intermedi-
ate model dened by allowing the break point of the double-
power-law distribution to evolve The results of that analysis
are shown in Figure 3 and presented in Table 4 after incorpo-
rating obscuration corrections using the common obscuration
assumptions described above It can be seen that the three mod-
els explored by Lanzetta et al 2002 are highly consistent with
the range of values measured in the other studies compiled here
The central model seems to be most consistent and this is also
apparently the most consistent with the data derived in Lanzetta
On the evolution of star forming galaxies
et al 2002 from the neutral hydrogen column density mea-
sured from damped Ly absorption systems between redshifts
25  z  5 There is also an apparent underestimate for all
three models around z  15 compared to the numerous other
measurements in this region as well as when compared to the
lower limit inferred from the radio source counts lower dotted
line see  3 below There is also a continual increase above
z  5 counter to the assumptions made in the evolving radio
LF modelling below It is possible that the photometric redshift
estimation erroneously identies extreme redshifts higher than
z  6 or 7 for objects whose true redshifts are around z  15
where the 4000 A break an important feature in constraining
photometric redshifts is shifted out of the optical spectral win-
Apart from this issue the SFR density evolution measured
from photometric redshift estimates when corrected for obscu-
ration effects appears highly consistent with all the other mea-
surements and with the constraints from radio source counts
This is an encouraging result suggesting that possible surface
brightness related biases in the other estimates of SFR density
compiled here are at most similar to the scatter seen between
different measurements at similar redshifts They may well be
somewhat less given the other sources of uncertainty involved
This does not suggest that these effects should be ignored but
rather that more or less appropriate corrections have been used
by most authors in accounting for these effects
3 EVOLVING LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS
In order to have a reference for interpreting these results
and the overall compilation evolving LFs for star forming SF
galaxies have been explored
Numerous measurements of evolutionary parameters or
forms for galaxy LF exist in the literature For the current ex-
ploration the evolving 14 GHz LF for star forming SF galax-
ies from Haarsma et al 2000 is particularly relevant as are the
constraints on 14 GHz SF LF evolution from deep radio source
counts eg Hopkins et al 1998 Rowan-Robinson et al 1993
The SF history analysis of Haarsma et al 2000 provides mea-
surements at discrete redshifts in addition to the derived evolv-
ing LF These points cannot be converted directly to the chosen
SFR calibration since this is luminosity-dependent In order to
be able to show these results however the ratio of each of these
points to the measured evolving LF at the appropriate redshift
was noted These factors were then applied to the evolving LF
after the cosmology and SFR calibration conversions and the
resulting data points are those given in Table 2 and shown in
Figures 1 and 2 This is a somewhat coarse way to make the
conversion but it seems unlikely to have introduced an error of
more than about 15 given the locations of these points with
respect to the nearby FIR data points from Flores et al 1999
both before and after the conversion
To convert evolving LFs to the assumed cosmology in or-
der to compare with the current data compilation the following
relation is used see discussion of Equation 4 from Dunlop 
Peacock 1990
1L1 z
 2L2 z
where L1 is the luminosity derived from a given ux density
and the luminosity distance corresponding to z in the rst cos-
mology and L2 is the luminosity derived from the same ux
density with the luminosity distance for z in the second cos-
l1 with the dl being
mology In other words L2  L1  d2
the luminosity distances in the respective cosmologies
The evolving 14 GHz SF galaxy LFs after the cosmology
conversion are converted to SFR densities at each redshift
This is done simply by integrating the LF at each redshift af-
ter converting luminosity to SFR As well as the evolving LF
of Haarsma et al 2000 the local 14 GHz LF for SF galaxies
from Condon 1989 is also used by invoking pure luminosity
evolution L  1  zQ having a cutoff at z  2 Constraints
from faint radio source counts suggest that 25  Q  41
eg Hopkins et al 1998 and the evolution of the SFR den-
sity corresponding to these two extremes is calculated The cos-
mology conversion in both cases is performed after the applica-
tion of the appropriate evolutionary factors since the derivation
of these parameters was performed assuming an EdS cosmol-
ogy The resulting SF histories derived assuming Q  25 and
Q  41 in the EdS cosmology are shown as dotted lines in
Figures 1 2 and 3
4 CONSTRAINTS ON THE LF EVOLUTION
The above comparisons illustrate the utility of the SF history
to provide constraints on the form of the LF evolution for SF
galaxies Earlier studies have used the 14 GHz radio sources
counts with some success to constrain the rate of pure luminos-
ity evolution L  1  zQ for the SF galaxy population eg
Rowan-Robinson et al 1993 Hopkins et al 1998 Seymour et
al 2004 while assuming no density evolution   1  zP 
with P  0 The constraints on these forms of evolution from
radio source counts suffer from a degeneracy between luminos-
ity and density evolution Hopkins et al 2003b in the same
fashion as found for the optical source counts eg Lin et al
1999 By itself the SF history diagram when used to constrain
the evolution of the LF suffers from a similar degeneracy To-
gether though the source counts and the star formation history
can be combined to break this degeneracy and this is explored
The local luminosity function for star forming galaxies of
Sadler et al 2002 was adopted This was allowed to evolve
assuming combinations of density evolution spanning 6 
P  6 in steps of 031 and luminosity evolution spanning
1  Q  7 in steps of 021 In addition a cutoff in lumi-
nosity evolution was imposed above z  2 such that for higher
redshifts L  1  2Q This is the same cutoff as used in ear-
lier estimates of pure luminosity evolution Rowan-Robinson
et al 1993 Hopkins et al 1998 The constraint derived from
the source counts does not turn out to depend strongly on this
cutoff or indeed on the assumed cosmology this was also re-
cently shown by Seymour et al 2004 although this is not true
for the SF history constraint For each value of P Q both
the source counts and the star formation history were predicted

either the source count measurements and uncertainties respec-

radio source counts used in the 2 estimation are those from
the Phoenix Deep Survey PDS data of Hopkins et al 2003a

White et al 1997 for ux densities 31  S14  502 mJy
In addition to the star forming galaxies to t the source counts
an active galactic nucleus AGN population is also necessary

those derived using the common obscuration correction Only
the independent data points from Hogg et al 1998 from this
compilation were used and the data point derived from Con-
don 1989 was excluded as its very small uncertainty other-
wise dramatically affects the resulting 2 The GOODS data
points at high redshift were also excluded as they are effectively
lower limits due to the incomplete LF integration as described
above The resulting 2 arrays were converted to reduced 2
values using 58 degrees of freedom there are 6 parameters in
the model 4 from the LF and the 2 evolutionary parameters
for the source counts with 64 measurements and 48 for the SF
history with 54 measurements These reduced 2 arrays were
then converted to log-likelihoods using logL  052
The joint likelihood for each P Q pair assuming the mea-
surements for the source counts and the SF history can be
treated as independent is simply the product of the likelihoods
the sum of the log-likelihoods derived from the source counts
and the SF history The assumption of independence is not triv-
ial since both the SF history and the source counts involve in-
tegrations over the same luminosity function weighted in the
case of the SF history by the luminosity For the SF history
the integration is over luminosity while for the source counts it
is over redshift As an analogy this can be thought of as tak-
ing a distribution of points in ux densityredshift space and
projecting them as distributions over either redshift or ux den-
sity This would correspond to the integrations over ux density
or luminosity for a xed redshift or redshift respectively If
the distribution of points in ux densityredshift space is not
correlated the resulting projections are independent and the
corresponding probability distributions can be assumed to be
independent Since this is true for deep radio surveys such as
the PDS the assumption of independence is likely to be reason-
Figure 4 shows the 1 2 and 3  contours for the constraints
from both the source counts and the SF history as well as the
joint constraint These contours are dened by subtracting 05
10 and 15 respectively from the maximum of logL and the
constraints from the SF history and the source counts seem to be
consistent with each other at about the 2  level The maximum
likelihood evolutionary parameters resulting from the joint con-
straint is Q  270  060 P  015  060
To provide some further context for this result the predicted
redshift distributions for radio sources are shown in Figure 5
with the SF galaxy contribution derived assuming these rates
of evolution Four ux density limits are shown ranging from
1 mJy above which almost all radio sources are AGN domi-
nated to 005 mJy the level to which the 14 GHz source counts
are currently robustly measured and where SF galaxies domi-
nate the source numbers It can be seen in Figure 5d corre-
sponding to the ux density limit relevant for the current analy-
sis that SF galaxies dominate the distribution for redshifts be-
low about z  07 while AGNs contribute a signicant pro-
portion only at higher redshifts This along with the other lim-
itations on this analysis at higher redshift such as the assumed
redshift cutoff in the SF galaxy evolution and the lack of a large
number of SF history estimates implies that the current anal-
ysis is perhaps less sensitive to the nature of galaxy evolution
at high redshifts and is constrained most strongly by the nature
of low to moderate redshift SF galaxies Altering the param-
eters of the assumed AGN luminosity function within a small
range constrained to retain the consistency with the observed
radio source counts for example has the effect of modestly
changing the shape of the predicted redshift distribution for the
AGNs Since these predominantly lie at high redshift and bright
ux densities the radio source count constraints for the evolu-
tion of the SF galaxy population are not signicantly affected
The assumed redshift cutoff in the SF galaxy evolution above
z  2 can be seen as a sharp turnover in the SF galaxy numbers
at this redshift most noticable in Figure 5c and 5d This
type of artifact is unlikely to appear in more realistic models of
galaxy evolution and reects the illustrative nature of the cur-
rent investigation which obviously leaves some room for re-
nement The other aspect that must be taken into account in
any interpretation of the distributions in this Figure is the effect
of the optical counterpart brightness in constraining any obser-
vational redshift distributions that may be obtained Models of
bivariate radio-optical LFs and corresponding forms of evolu-
tion have been used to predict such distributions eg Hopkins
1998 Hopkins et al 1999 although such analysis is beyond
the scope of the present work
The likelihood contours for the SF history and source count
constraints seen in Figure 4 show fairly well dened slopes
corresponding to degeneracies in P Q The reasons for these
degeneracies can be understood in a little more detail by con-
sidering the dependence on P and Q of the calculations used
to produce the SF history and the source counts The source
counts are considered here rst and can be written as
SN S  Z dz
c 3 and
where L  4S1  zDcz2 and Vc  4D3
the subscript c indicates the comoving distance or volume
The adopted forms for the luminosity and density evolution
01  zP  mean that
Lz  L
LL can be written as 1  zP 
0f y where y  LLz
Now the comoving distance can be approximated as Dcz 
DEdSz1z with the Einstein-de Sitter comoving distance
01  zQ and z  
DEdSz  2cH1 11  z and  being a function of

1  z Transforming the integral over z into one over y gives

This is a relation that can now be used to estimate the form of
the degeneracy between P and Q given the observed source

SN S  S32 and this should be independent of z for small

at least in the regime in which the counts are dominated by
objects at relatively small redshifts Since there should be no
dependence on 1  z in this regime it might thus be expected
that the constraint from the number counts scales as
P  2Q  4
This is independent of  since at small z all cosmologies have
similar Dcz relations The degeneracy indicated by the actual
numerical estimates giving the likelihood contours in Figure 4
is P 2Q  54 The difference from the scaling derived above
is because as might be expected the contribution to the source
counts from higher redshifts is not negligible
The evolution of the SF history is somewhat simpler to un-
derstand Since most SFR indicators are proportional to lumi-
nosity z is just the evolution of the luminosity density

The observed slope of log z with log1  z thus constrains
the value of the sum P  Q This slope has been seen to be
about 3 up to z  1 so P  Q  3 which is in excellent
agreement with the degeneracy in P Q seen in Figure 4 for
the SF history likelihood contours
This analysis suggests that there are understandable reasons
for the degeneracies seen between P and Q and the measure-
ments are consistent with what might be expected from this
analysis The form of the degeneracies are fortunately differ-
ent for the source counts and the SF history and the degenera-
cies can be broken by combining these constraints More de-
tailed investigation along these lines might usefully identify ad-
ditional observables that could similarly be used to break such
degeneracies yet further constraining the form of evolution of
the star forming galaxy luminosity function
5 DISCUSSION
51 Limitations of this analysis
There appears to be a large discrepancy factors of two in the
local SFR density derived from integrating various local radio
LFs When the actual LFs are compared however the measure-
ments are highly consistent compare eg the LF and parame-
terisations of Sadler et al 2002 and Machalski  Godlowski
2000 The discrepancy here occurs because of the different
LF parameters derived even for the same functional form
which when integrated over the complete luminosity range give
different results This is in part a contribution of the poorly con-
strained tails of the LFs but there is also a contribution from the
different values for L which translate to different locations for
the peak in the luminosity density as a function of luminosity
and hence to the derived total SFR densities It is known that
LF parameters are not independent and the effect of this is that
the uncertainty in the LF integral requires the incorporation of
the LF parameter error ellipse in addition to the Poisson un-
certainties typically quoted The result is that at least some of
the scatter in the SF history diagram will be due to different
choices for LF parameterisation not only for radio LFs but
also at other wavelengths
This systematic uncertainty is clearly not accounted for in
the published uncertainties for the SFR density measurements
These typically reect only assumed Poisson counting uncer-
tainties while neglecting other systematics that may be impor-
tant for any particular survey typically because these effects
are difcult to quantify As a result the quoted uncertainties
for most data points are likely to be lower limits to the true
uncertainties This has not been accounted for in the 2 cal-
culations used above to constrain the SF galaxy LF evolution
One way to minimise any bias introduced by this issue might
be to bin the measured SFR density points in redshift summing
in quadrature their published uncertainties By combining ad-
jacent data points as an average or median the most extreme
outlying points as well as those with the least representative
uncertainties will have their disproportionate effects on the 2
statistic minimised This has been explored using several dif-
ferent binnings of the data ranging from including as few as
5 points per bin to as many as 8 points per bin coarser bin-
ning leaves the problem unconstrained as there are then fewer
data points than free parameters while ner binning eliminates
the advantage of this method as there are then too few points
per bin to smooth out the more extreme measurements The
joint constraint with the source counts when using this method
is changed only marginally although the likelihood peak in the
constraint from the SF history alone moves along the line of de-
generacy to smaller Q and larger P values This suggests that
the apparent marginal consistency at the 2  level between the
SF history and source count datasets separately is likely to be
an artifact of a few measurements contributing disproportion-
ately to the 2 estimate for the former and the true consistency
could be much better
The preferred value for the luminosity evolution Q  270
060 is highly consistent with a recent estimate from mod-
els incorporating luminosity evolution only no density evo-
lution when constrained by the 14 GHz source counts Sey-
mour et al 2004
It is worth noting though that is some-
what lower than the tted slope to the SF history data points
for z  1   310  025 This cannot be completely ex-
plained by the small contribution from the density evolution
P  015  060 since even together these effects produce a
slightly atter slope compared with  This is a result both of
including points at z  1 in the 2 calculation as well as the
effect of the constraint from the source counts the constraint
from the SF history alone seems to favour somewhat higher
values of Q with negative values for P  Regarding the choice
of local SF galaxy LF for the investigation of the evolution-
ary parameters choosing a different LF from that of Sadler et
al 2002 would produce slightly different results for the best-
tting values of P Q The LF from Condon et al 2002
producing one of the lowest values for the local SFR density
would favour somewhat higher rates of luminosity or density
evolution and a correspondingly steeper slope in the global SF
history diagram When the constraints from the source counts
are incorporated though the resulting preferred values still do
not change much from those derived above
Apart from the factors of two uncertainty in the local esti-
mate for the SFR density the other most strikingly outlying
points include the lowest redshift UV-derived points Sullivan
et al 2000 Treyer et al 1998 and the OII data from Hogg et
A M Hopkins
al 1998 The latter is explained by that author simply as the
effect of the small numbers contributing to each redshift bin
and the choice of bin location prompting the use of the over-
lapping bins chosen to emphasise the extent of this effect The
UV-derived estimates at z  015 appear to be high compared
with other estimates from H OII or radio luminosities at
similar redshifts It is likely that this is actually a result of an
overestimated obscuration correction both with the common
obscuration and the SFR-dependent obscuration methods used
which can be seen to produce similar corrections The under-
lying reason for this is a combination of lower luminosity sys-
tems having lower obscurations and low-redshift UV-selected
samples being dominated primarily by such relatively low lu-
minosity systems This is supported by the fact that the SFR
density derived for the samples of Tresse  Maddox 1998
and Treyer et al 1998 using the SFR dependent obscuration
gives a lower value than that using the common obscuration
correction Further as can be seen from Figure 1 of Sullivan
et al 2000 for example although the mean obscuration is
close to AV  1 mag for this sample the median is some-
what lower probably closer to AV  08 mag The effective
obscuration correction for this sample in terms of a common
obscuration should thus be somewhat lower than assumed For
the luminosity-dependent obscuration similarly the curve from
Hopkins et al 2001a is again less appropriate having been
derived from a sample containing more heavily obscured sys-
tems at all luminosities than are likely to be found in the local
UV-selected samples When these effects are accounted for the
UV-derived points at z  015 will be moved lower more con-
sistent with the rest of the compilation around this redshift
52 The shape of the z  3 SF history
Recent investigations of z  6 i-band dropouts have sug-
gested that the SF history is steadily dropping from z  3 to
z  6 Bouwens et al 2003 Fontana et al 2003 Stanway et al
2004 These analyses compare the comoving SFR density for
objects with high SFRs  15 Myr1 Stanway et al 2004
and nd a decrease in this SFR density of almost an order of
magnitude from z  3 to z  6 The reason for limiting the
analysis to objects with high SFRs is to avoid the extrapola-
tions made in assuming a particular faint end slope  for the
LF If the faint end slope is assumed to be   16 Yan et
al 2003 Bouwens et al 2003 and the LF integrated over all
luminosities the derived SFR density is a factor of about four
greater than for just the high SFR objects alone Bouwens et al
2003 The value established assuming this faint end slope by
Bouwens et al 2003 after conversion to the UV SFR calibra-
tion adopted here is 004 Myr1 If obscuration corrections
are then made assuming the common obscuration correction
used herein the SFR density is increased by another factor of
about 34 to 014 Myr1 at z  6 highly consistent with the
other estimates shown in Figure 1 It should be emphasised that
the estimated  40 decrease in comoving SFR density from
z  3 to z  6 claimed by Bouwens et al 2003 lies entirely
within the scatter of the measurement compilation and asso-
ciated uncertainties over this redshift range The much lower
z  6 SFR densities derived by Fontana et al 2003 and Stan-
way et al 2004 indicating an order of magnitude drop from
z  3 are less consistent being signicantly lower than the
estimates of Bouwens et al 2003 These apparent inconsis-
tencies are related to the small numbers of objects in the sam-
ples at most about 30 with as few as 6 galaxies contributing to
some analyses the assumptions involved in correcting for in-
completeness and the uncertainty in the faint end slope of the
luminosity function Requiring an absolute magnitude limited
sample for example seems to imply constant SFR densities up
to z  6 Fontana et al 2003 There is evidence too for
faint end LF slopes as steep as   16 or steeper Yan et
al 2003 at these redshifts which would also support relatively
little evolution
Given these uncertainties it is clear that larger samples are
needed at these high redshifts probing to fainter luminosities
to robustly determine the faint end slope of the LF before it
is possible to reliably constrain the shape of the SFR density
evolution beyond z  3
6 SUMMARY
An extensive compilation from the literature of SFR den-
sity measurements as a function of redshift has been presented
These data have been converted to a consistent set of SFR
calibrations common cosmology and consistent dust obscu-
ration corrections where necessary The compilation thus pro-
duced gives a highly consistent description of the evolution in
galaxy SFR density with redshift constrained to within fac-
tors of about three at most redshifts up to z  6 In produc-
ing this compilation different assumptions regarding obscura-
tion have been explored For those measurements requiring ob-
scuration corrections the assumptions used were those deemed
most likely to be appropriate Alternative assumptions regard-
ing the obscuration corrections however will act to increase
the SFR densities derived compared with those presented here
with the possible exception of the poorly known obscuration
properties of high redshift systems z  1
This rich compilation of SFR density evolution provides a
robust constraint for many investigations of galaxy evolution
and this has been illustrated by constraining the evolution of the
SF galaxy LF In combination with constraints from the radio
source counts the SF galaxy LF is found to evolve with lumi-
nosity and density evolutionary parameters Q  270  060
and P  015  060 respectively An analysis has been per-
formed of the degeneracies between P and Q seen in the sepa-
rate constraints from the source counts and the SF history This
suggests that the origin of these degeneracies is reasonably well
understood and this methodology may be a useful tool for iden-
tifying additional observables that could be used as additional
constraints for breaking such degeneracies
While every effort has been made to be as thorough as possi-
ble in the current compilation it is possible that some datasets
or measurements may have been inadvertently omitted
seems unlikely though that such omissions will signicantly
alter the above conclusions At the same time it is the authors
hope that a complete and expansive review of this topic more
so than possible in the present case will be able to do justice to
the wealth of current and ongoing measurements contributing
to our understanding of this aspect of galaxy evolution

aThe factor effectively used in converting  from the cosmology assumed in the original reference to that assumed here In cases
where an LF has been integrated this factor is the appropriate combination of the conversion factors applied separately to L and 
b  calculated using the common obscuration correction
cThe factor corresponding to the common obscuration correction applied in calculating com An ellipsis means that an obscura-
tion correction applied in the original reference was retained or that no obscuration correction is necessary
d  calculated using the SFR-dependent obscuration correction No entry means that no LF parameters were available for use in
applying an SFR-dependent correction Lower limits too are not transferred to this column
eThe effective factor corresponding to the SFR-dependent obscuration correction applied in calculating sfrd It should be em-
phasised that this is merely the inferred effective correction as the actual correction is done through an integral over the luminosity
function while applying corrections varying as a function of luminosity An ellipsis means that an obscuration correction applied in
the original reference was retained or that no obscuration correction is necessary No entry means no sfrd was available
f Obscuration correction valid at the wavelength of H since the OII LF is converted to an H LF before obscuration correction
gObscuration correction valid at the wavelength of H corresponding to a 1 mag correction at the wavelength of H

Note  Units of L are W for H LFs or W Hz1 for UV or 14 GHz LFs Units of  are 103 Mpc3 The 14 GHz LFs
from Condon et al 2002 and Condon 1989 use a parameterisation corresponding to hyperbolic visibility functions These are
parameterised using Y  306 B  19 X  2235 W  067 for Condon et al 2002 and Y  288 B  15 X  22108
W  0667 for Condon 1989 after conversion to the currently assumed cosmology
1 Effective H LF inferred from observed OII LF
2 Obscuration corrected by original authors using measured values of obscuration for individual objects
3 This LF was not tted to the observations Rather the observations at z  22 appear consistent with the z  13 LF of Yan
et al 1999 in the cosmologies assumed by those authors so that LF is adopted for this higher redshift Note that the cosmology
conversions at the different redshifts give rise to different L and  values for the currently assumed cosmology
4 The form of the LF here is that of Saunders et al 1990 where  has a slightly different denition from that in the Schechter
1976 LF and the  parameter effectively broadens the bright end of the LF

FIG 1 Evolution of SFR density with redshift using a common obscuration correction where necessary The points are color-coded by rest-frame wavelength
as follows Blue UV Green OII Red H and H Pink X-ray FIR sub-mm and radio The solid line is the evolving 14 GHz LF derived by Haarsma et al
2000 The dot-dashed line shows the least squares t to all the z  1 data points log   310 log1  z  180 The dotted lines show pure luminosity
evolution for the Condon 1989 14 GHz LF at rates of Q  25 lower and Q  41 upper The dashed line is the fossil record from Local Group galaxies

FIG 2 As for Figure 1 with a luminosity-dependent obscuration correction Symbols and lines as in previous Figure The least squares t to the z  1 data
points dot-dashed line in this Figure is log   329 log1  z  180
FIG 3 Lines are as in previous Figures although note the different scales on the axes The points show the data from Figure 4 of Lanzetta et al 2002
circles correspond to the green data points of that Figure squares to the blue points and triangles to the red points after correction for a common obscuration
This emphasises the high level of consistency between the current compilation and the UV estimates at high redshift even when the effects of surface brightness
dimming are taken into account
On the evolution of star forming galaxies
FIG 4 Probability contours showing 1  2  and 3  likelihood regions in the P  Q plane Blue contours are the constraint from the sub-mJy radio source
counts red are from the star formation history diagram and green are the joint constraint
FIG 5 Redshift distributions predicted from the evolving radio LFs for four different radio ux density limits The SF galaxy LF assumes the best-tting
luminosity and density evolution derived from the previous Figure Q  270 P  015 In each panel the dot-dashed line is the contribution from AGN galaxies
the dashed line is that from SF galaxies and the solid line is the total galaxy redshift distribution
