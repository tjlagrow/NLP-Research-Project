Abstract
I present a comprehensive review of the evolution of galaxy structure in the universe from
the rst galaxies we can currently observe at z  6 down to galaxies we see in the local
universe I further address how these changes reveal galaxy formation processes that only
galaxy structural analyses can provide This review is pedagogical and begins with a de-
tailed discussion of the major methods in which galaxies are studied morphologically and
structurally This includes the well-established visual method for morphology Sersic tting
to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness prole shapes non-parametric structural
methods including the concentration C asymmetry A clumpiness S CAS method
the GiniM20 parameters as well as newer structural indices Included is a discussion of
how these structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies such as their scale
star formation rate and ongoing merger activity Extensive observational results are shown
demonstrating how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z  3
from small compact and peculiar systems in the distant universe to the formation of the
Hubble sequence dominated by spirals and ellipticals we nd today This review further
addresses how structural methods accurately identify galaxies in mergers and allow mea-
surements of the merger history out to z  3 The properties and evolution of internal
structures of galaxies are depicted such as bulges disks bars and at z  1 large star form-
ing clumps The structure and morphologies of host galaxies of active galactic nuclei and
starburstssub-mm galaxies are described along with how morphological galaxy quenching
occurs Furthermore the role of environment in producing structure in galaxies over cosmic
time is treated Alongside the evolution of general structure I also delineate how galaxy
sizes change with time with measured sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at
a given stellar mass This review concludes with a discussion of how the evolving trends in
sizes structures and morphologies reveal the formation mechanisms behind galaxies which
provides a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation
1 INTRODUCTION
Galaxy structure is one of the fundamental ways in which galaxy properties are described
and by which galaxy evolution is inferred There is a long history of the development of
this idea which began with the earliest observations of galaxies and continues up to the
modern day as one of the major ways we study galaxies This review gives a detailed
description of the progress made up to late-2013 in using galaxy structure to understand
galaxy formation and evolution
It is meant to be used as a primer for obtaining basic
information from galaxy structures including how they are measured and applied through
cosmic time
The introduction to this review rst gives an outline of the basic events in the history
of galaxy morphology and structure analyses while the second part of the introduction
describes how galaxy structure ts into the general picture of galaxy formation I also give
a detailed description of the goals of this review at the end of the introduction
11 Historical Background
Galaxy morphology has a long history one that even predates the time we knew galaxies
were extragalactic When objects which today we call galaxies were rst observed what
clearly distinguished them from stars was their resolved structure Since this time structure
and morphology has remained one of the most common ways galaxies are described and
studied
Initially this involved visual impressions of galaxy forms This has now been
expanded to include quantitative methods to measure galaxy structures all the way back
to the earliest galaxies we can currently see
The rst published descriptions of galaxy structure and morphology predates the tele-
scopic era For example the Andromeda nebula was described as a small cloud by the
Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Su in the 10th century Kepple  Sanner 1998
The study of galaxies remained descriptive until the late 20th century although more and
more detail was resolved as technology improved As a result for about 150 years the
science of galaxies was necessarily restricted to cataloging and general descriptions of struc-
ture with notable achievements by Messier and William and John Herschel who located
galaxies or nebula by their resolve structure as seen by eye Even before photography rev-
olutionized the study of galaxies some observers such as William Parsons the 3rd Earl of
Rosse noted that the nebulae have a spiral morphology and rst used this term to describe
galaxies most notably and famously in the case of M51
It was however the advent of photography that astronomers could in earnest begin to
study the morphologies and structures of external galaxies The most notable early schemes
were developed by Wolf 1908 and Lundmark 1926 among others This ultimately led to
what is today called the Hubble classication which was published in essentially its modern
form in Hubble 1926 with the nal Hubble Tuning Fork established in Hubble 1936
and Sandage 1961 The basic Hubble sequence Figure 1 consists of two main types of
galaxies ellipticals and spirals with a further division of spirals into those with bars and
those without bars Hubble and the astronomers who followed him could classify most
nearby bright galaxies in terms of this system
The development of morphological classication methods continued into the 20th century
with newer methodologies based solely on visual impressions For example de Vaucouleurs
1959 developed a revised version of the Hubble sequence which included criteria such as
as bars rings and other internal features that were prominent on photographic plates of

Figure 1
A modern form of the Hubble sequence showing the sequence of ellipticals and S0s and the
tuning fork in spirals The elliptical sequence is determined by the overall shape of the galaxy
while spiral classications are divided into dierent types a-c depending upon how wound-up
spiral arms are how large the bulge relative to the disk is and how smooth the spiral arms in the
spirals arm The tuning-fork is the dierential between spirals with and without bars Also shown
is the extension of this sequence to dwarf spheroidal galaxies and irregular galaxies both of which
are lower mass systems Kormendy  Bender 2012
galaxies Likewise van den Bergh 1960 1976 and later Elmegreen  Elmegreen 1987
developed a system to classify galaxies based on the form of spiral arms and the apparent
clumpiness of the light in these arms
While it is important to classify galaxies visually and all systems have some use as all
features should be explained by physics it is not obvious which structural features of galax-
ies are fundamental to their formation history Ultimately morphology and structure needs
to prove to be useful for understanding galaxies as there is now extensive use of photo-
metric and spectroscopic methods permitting measurements of perhaps more fundamental
measures of stellar populations and dustgas properties in galaxies Along these lines at
roughly the same time as progressively complicated classication systems were developed
astronomers such as Holmberg 1958 established that physical properties of nearby galax-
ies correlate with morphology in a broad context Holmberg 1958 found that ellipticals
are typically massive and red and show little star formation while spirals are less massive
bluer and have evidence for ongoing star formation This quantitatively expands into other
physical parameters as well eg Roberts 1963 Roberts  Haynes 1994 Conselice 2006a
Allen et al 2006
It is also well known that this segregation of morphology in the lo-
cal universe provides an important clue for understanding the physics of galaxy formation
especially as local environment is found to strongly correlate with a galaxys morphology
eg Dressler 1984 see 47
A revolution in morphological and structurally studies came about with the advent of
photometric photometry and especially the later use of Charged Coupled Devices CCD
which made detailed quantitative measurements of light distributions in galaxies possible
The rst major contribution from this type of work was by de Vaucouleurs 1948 who
used photometry to show that the light proles of what we would identify today as massive
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
ellipticals all follow roughly the same fundamental light distribution known as the de
Vaucouleurs prole
This was later expanded by others most notably Sersic 1963 who demonstrated that
a more general form of light distributions matched galaxy light proles with disks having
exponential light proles while the light distribution within massive ellipticals generally
following the de Vaucouleurs prole This has led to a huge industry in measuring the light
proles of galaxies in the nearby and distant universe which continues today 22
During the 1970s and 1980s the study of galaxy structure expanded to include the de-
composition of galaxy light into bulge and disk proles eg Kormendy 1977 as well as
features such as bars rings and lenses eg Kormendy 1979 de Vaucouleurs et al 1993
The three dimensional structure of disk galaxies was investigated eg van der Kruit 
Searle 1982 as well as detailed studies of bulges and disk in spiral systems eg de Jong
1996 Peletier  Balcells 1996 We also now know there is a great diversity in elliptical
galaxy internal structures eg Kormendy et al 2009
Similar investigations demonstrated that secular evolution within disks can provide an
explanation for how bars rings and lenses can form eg Kormendy 1979 Combes 
Sanders 1981 These eects not driven by hierarchical galaxy formation are also likely
responsible for the formation of pseudo-bulges and may drive the formation of central
massive black holes eg Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 Sellwood 2013
While there is a large amount of work done on the structures and morphologies of galax-
ies in the nearby universe eg see Kormendy et al 2009 Buta 2013 it is dicult to
investigate more than the very basics of structure and morphology when studying distant
galaxies This is due to the fact that current technology does not allow us to resolve these
distant galaxies in the same detail as we can for closer systems As such this review will
concentrate on the features and properties of galaxy structure which we can measure in
distant galaxies and how this reveals how galaxy evolution and formation occurs
The result of this is that one of the areas where galaxy structure and morphology has
made its biggest impact is its ability to measure fundamental properties of distant galaxies
that we can compare with nearby galaxies to determine evolution There are extensive
methods for studying galaxy evolution which galaxy structure analyses are becoming an
essential aspect of and providing unique information on the history and physics of galaxy
assembly which I detail in this review
12 Galaxy Structure within the Context of Galaxy Formation
We know that there is signicant evolution in galaxies over time as the stellar mass density
of galaxies evolves rapidly at 1  z  3 with about half of all stellar mass formed by z  1
eg Bundy et al 2005 Mortlock et al 2011 We also know that there is a vast diversity
of star formation histories for individual galaxies and that the integrated star formation
rate density in the universes history peaks at z  25 and declines at higher and lower
redshifts eg Shapley 2011 Madau  Dickinson 2014 this volume However it is not
clear from these observations what arewere the driving forces creating galaxies
Theory oers several approaches for understanding how galaxies form which detailed
studies are starting to probe We now believe that galaxy formation can happen in a
number of ways This includes
in-situ star formation in a collapsed galaxy major and
minor mergers and gas accretion from the intergalactic medium Galaxy structure and
morphology are perhaps the best ways to trace these processes as I discuss in this review
Another major question I address in this review is how do the structures and morphologies
4 Christopher J Conselice
of galaxies change through cosmic time Major issues that this topic allows us to address
include the formation history of the Hubble Sequence whether galaxies form in-side-out
or out-side-in  how long does a galaxy retain its morphology is morphology a invariant
quantity in a galaxy over a long cosmic time-span and furthermore what relative role does
star formation and merging play in galaxy formation
Galaxy structure and morphology has made a signicant impact on these questions largely
due to the Hubble Space Telescope HST and its various Deep Field campaigns starting
in the mid-1990s nding thousands of galaxies at redshifts z  1 within these images This
is complemented by extensive imaging and spectroscopy for nearby galaxies carried out by
surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS and the Millennium Galaxy Catalog
eg Shen et al 2003 De Propris et al 2007 Combining these surveys makes it possible
to study in detail the structures of distant galaxies and to compare these with structures
at dierent redshifts This has led to a renaissance in the analysis of galaxy structure
including parametric tting using Sersic proles and the development of non-parametric
measurements of galaxy structure that have allowed us to use galaxy morphologystructure
as a tool for deciphering how galaxy assembly occurs over cosmic time
We are in fact now able to resolve galaxies back to redshifts z  8 with imaging from
space and recently as well with adaptive optics from the ground eg Conselice  Arnold
2009 Carrasco et al 2010 Akiyama et al 2008 This reveals that galaxy structure
is signicantly dierent in the early universe from what it is today and that there is a
progression from the highest redshifts where galaxies are small peculiar and undergoing
high star formation rates to the relative quiescent galaxies that we nd in the nearby
universe How this change occurs and what it implies for galaxy evolution is another focus
of this review
Another ultimate goal is to describe the methods for measuring galaxy structure and
morphology for nearby galaxies up to the most distant ones we can see I also discuss how
galaxy structure correlates with physical properties of galaxies such as their star formation
rate merging and their overall scale I then provide a description of the observed structural
evolution of galaxies and a discussion of what this implies for the driving mechanisms
behind galaxy formation using the calibrated methods
The amount of information we have about the structures and properties of galaxies de-
clines as one goes to higher redshift systems and issues that arise due to observational
bias must be dealt with I therefore also discuss systematics that can be addressed through
imaging simulations to determine the real evolution of the morphologies and structures of
galaxies I nish this review with a discussion of future uses of galaxy structuremorphology
including the potential with the advent of JWST and Euclid
This review is structured as follows
In 2 I describe the analysis methods used for
measuring the morphologies and structures of galaxies In 3 I describe how structures and
morphologies reveal fundamental galaxy properties and evolutionary processes while 4 de-
scribes the observed evolution of the structures of galaxies through cosmic time I nish this
review with a description of how galaxy structure and evolution is becoming an important
aspect for understanding the underlying theory of galaxy formation and cosmology in 5
and give a summary and future outlook in 6
2 Structural Measurement Methods
In this section I describe the various ways in which galaxy structure is measured and quan-
tied for comparisons across all redshifts There are a great diversity of nearby galaxy
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
properties that cannot be examined at high redshift and this review only concentrates
on that general features that can be measured This includes the traditional approach of
using visual estimates to classify galaxies into morphological types as well as quantitative
methods Visual methods has had a resurgence with the advent of Citizen Science projects
such as Galaxy Zoo which provides online tools for non-scientists to classify over a million
galaxies Lintott et al 2011 as well as large Hubble Space Telescope projects such as CAN-
DELS eg Kocevski et al 2011 Kartaltepe et al 2014 The bulk of this section however
describes the quantitative methods for measuring galaxy structure and the limitations to
this approach The interpretation of what these measurements imply are discussed in 3
and 4
21 Visual Morphology
The classic approach towards understanding the structures of galaxies is through their
apparent visual morphology The major system of classication in use today has a develop-
ment through Hubble 1926 de Vaucouleurs 1959 and Sandage 1961 1975 as outlined
briey in the introduction Modern reviews of galaxy classication by eye into visual types
can be found in Buta 2013
When studying the morphologies of distant galaxies the visual classications can only be
placed into a few limited and well dened classes spirals ellipticals and irregularpeculiars
The spirals can be further subdivided into spirals with or without a bar In this review
peculiars are interpreted as mergers of two preexisting galaxies while irregulars are lower
mass galaxies that contain a semi-random pattern of star formation such as is seen in
Magellanic irregulars Typically these irregulars are too faint to be seen at high redshifts
and therefore are not considered in this review in any detail
Visual morphological classications has been performed on nearly all deep Hubble Space
Telescope imaging starting from its earliest days eg Dressler et al 1994 van den Bergh
et al 1996 This has continued with deeper and deeper HST observations including those
that sample the rest-frame optical in the near-infrared eg Mortlock et al 2013 Lee et
al 2013 There are however some limitations to how these classications can be used at
higher redshifts as it is not clear how the apparent morphology of a galaxy will change due
to redshift eects rather than real evolution 235
There is also the issue that galaxies which look elliptical or disky do not have the
same characteristics as systems with the same morphologies seen nearby 41 It is clear
that the properties of distant galaxies that look elliptical and disky do not have the same
physical properties as systems with the corresponding morphology in the nearby universe
Features such as sizes light proles colors and star formation rates dier within the same
galaxy morphological type through time eg Conselice et al 2011 Mortlock et al 2013
Buitrago et al 2013 Therefore throughout this review a morphological type is only a
visual determination of how a galaxy looks and does not predispose to a certain local galaxy
type or template or to ascribe a certain formation history or scale
22 Parametric Measurements of Structure
Historically one of the rst ways in which galaxy structure was quantied was through the
use of integrated light proles These proles are simply measured by taking the average
intensity of a galaxy at a given radius and then determining how this intensity changes
as a function of radius This was rst described in detail by de Vaucouleurs 1948 who
6 Christopher J Conselice
used the measurements of light from photometry at dierent apertures for ellipticals and
proposed a tting form A similar but more general form was found to better explain the
surface brightness proles by Sersic 1963 for dierent types of galaxies
IR  I0  expbn  RR1n
e  1
where the shape of the prole is described by the Sersic index n and the value of bn
is determined such that Re is the eective radius containing half of the light within the
galaxy and is a function of the index n The standard canonical benchmarks are that the
de Vaucouleurs prole is given by n  4 and exponential disks by n  1 In principle
the values of n and Re are used as fundamental and rst order structural parameters of
galaxies
The use of the Sersic prole to describe nearby galaxies is extensive eg Kormendy et
al 2009 and it has more recently been applied to distant galaxies as we discuss in 42
For reviews on the use of resolve photometry through surface brightness proles to study
early type galaxies see eg Kormendy  Djorgovski 1989 Allen et al 2006 Simard et
al 2011
2002 as well as GIM2D by Simard et al
Recently the tting of galaxy two dimensional proles with various forms such as the
Sersic exponential and de Vaucouleurs prole is done through the GALFIT code by Peng
2011 These allow a simple and
quick method for measuring the light proles and radii of many galaxies providing data
for understanding the evolution of galaxy structure This allows for the measurements of
dierent light components at high-z although these codes and other similar ones have
limitations such as a constant ellipticity assumption within a given component but are
sucient for gross measures of galaxy structure
23 Non-parametric Measurements of Structure
Another more recent measurement technique involves the non-parametric method of mea-
suring galaxy light distributions Non-parametric methods of measuring galaxy structure
began in the photographic era with attempts to quantify the light concentration in galax-
ies by Morgan 1962 although extensive quantitative measures were not done until the
mid-1990s
The development of methods to measure the light structures of galaxies began in earnest
when the rst deep images of distant galaxies were obtained with the Hubble Space Tele-
scope Shade et al 1995 Abraham et al 1996 although their use for low redshift mea-
surements was also noted at about the same time although in terms of a physical property
rather than a descriptive quantity eg Rix  Zaritsky 1995 Conselice 1997 Bershady
et al 2000 Conselice et al 2000ab These early papers show that quantitative galaxy
structure correlates with other parameters such as color and peculiar features indicating
mergers or galaxy interactions eg Rix  Zaritsky 1995 Conselice 1997 Conselice et al
2000a
At present the most common methods for measuring galaxy structure in a non-parametric
way is through the CAS system eg Conselice 2003 231 - 233 and through similar
parameters Takamiya 1999 Papovich et al 2003 2005 Abraham et al 2003 Lotz et al
2004 Law et al 2007 Freeman et al 2013 These parameters are designed to capture
the major features of the underlying structures of these galaxies but in a way that does
not involve assumptions about the underlying form as is done with the Sersic tting 22
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
These non-parametric parameters are also measurable out to high redshifts making them
ideal for deriving galaxy evolution over many epochs as we discuss in 4
I give a brief description for how these parameters are measured Typically as we discuss
below corrections must be applied to account for noise and to use a reproducible radius
eg Bershady et al 2000 Conselice et al 2000a This radius issue has been addressed in
detail by eg Conselice et al 2000a Bershady et al 2000 and Graham et al 2005
The radius typically used in these measures is the Petrosian radius which is dened as
the location where the ratio of surface brightness at a radius IR divided by the surface
brightness within the radius  I R  reaches some value which is denoted by R
Petrosian 1976 The value of  changes from 0  1 at the center of a galaxy down to
  0 when the light from the galaxy is zero at its outer edge
This method of measuring the radius is much less inuenced by surface brightness dim-
ming than other methods such as using an isophotal radius and is therefore useful for
measuring the same physical parts of galaxies at dierent redshifts eg Petrosian 1976
Bershady et al 2000 Graham et al 2005 The mathematical form for this radius is given
R 
 I R 
where most observables in non-parametric morphologies are measured at a radius which
corresponds to the location where R  02 or a relatively small multiplicative factor of
this radius often 15 times eg Bershady et al 2000 Conselice 2003 Lotz et al 2004
231 Asymmetry Index One of the more commonly used indices is the asymmetry
indexA which is a measure of how asymmetric a galaxy is after rotating along the line of
sight center axis of the galaxy by 180 deg Figure 2 It can be thought of as an indicator
of what fraction of the light in a galaxy is in non-symmetric components
The basic formula for calculating the asymmetry index A is given by
A  mincid18 I0  I180
cid19  mincid18 B0  B180
cid19
Where I0 represents is the original galaxy image I180 is the image after rotating it from its
center by 180  The measurement of the asymmetry parameter however involves several
steps beyond this simple measure This includes carefully dealing with the background
noise in the same way that the galaxy itself is by using a blank background area B0 and
nding the location for the center of rotation The radius is usually dened as the Petrosian
radius at which R  02 although once out to large radius the measured parameters are
remarkably stable
Operationally the area B0 is a blank part of the sky near the galaxy The center of
rotation is not dened a priori but is measured through an iterative process whereby the
value of the asymmetry is calculated at the initial central guess usually the geometric
center or light centroid and then the asymmetry is calculated around this central guess
using some fraction of a pixel dierence This is repeated until a global minimum is found
Conselice et al 2000a
Typical asymmetry values for nearby galaxies are discussed in Conselice 2003 with el-
lipticals having values A  002  002 while spiral galaxies are found in the range from
A  007  02 while for Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies ULIRGs which are often
mergers the average is A  032  019 and for merging starbursts A  053  022 Con-

represents the original galaxy image while R is this image rotated by 180 deg For the
clumpiness S B is the image after it has been smoothed blurred by the factor 03  r  02
The details of these measurements can be found in Conselice et al 2000a for asymmetry A
Bershady et al 2000 for concentration C and Conselice 2003 for the clumpiness index S
selice 2003 Table 1 lists the typical asymmetry and other CAS values Conselice 2003
Quantitative structural values for the same galaxy can also dier signicantly between wave-
lengths This is important for measuring these parameters at higher redshifts where often
the rest-frame optical cannot be probed an issue we discuss in more detail in 235
The concentration of light is used as a method for quan-
232 Light Concentration
tifying how much light is in the center of a galaxy as opposed to its outer parts It is a
very simple index in this regard and it is similar to and correlates strongly with Sersic
n values which are also a measure of the light concentration in a galaxy There are many
ways of measuring the concentration including taking ratios of radii which contain a certain
fraction of light as well as the ratio of the amount of light at two given radii eg Bershady
et al 2000 Graham et al 2005 These radii are often dened by the total amount of
light measured within some Petrosian radius often at the same location as used for the
measuring the asymmetry index
The denition most commonly used is the ratio of two circular radii which contain a inner

the total galaxy ux Figure 2

A higher value of C indicates that a larger amount of light in a galaxy is contained within
a central region The concentration index however has to be measured very carefully as
dierent regions and radii used can produce very dierent values that systematically do
not reproduce well when observed under degraded conditions eg Graham et al 2001
Graham et al 2005
The clumpiness or smoothness S parameter is used to describe
233 Clumpiness
the fraction of light in a galaxy which is contained in clumpy distributions Clumpy galax-
ies have a relatively large amount of light at high spatial frequencies whereas smooth
systems such as elliptical galaxies contain light at low spatial frequencies Galaxies which
are undergoing star formation tend to have very clumpy structures and thus high S val-
ues Clumpiness can be measured in a number of ways the most common method used as
described in Conselice 2003 is
S  10 cid20cid18 Ixy  I 
cid19 cid18 Bxy  B
cid19cid21 
where the original image Ixy is blurred to produce a secondary image I 
xy Figure 2 This
blurred image is then subtracted from the original image leaving a residual map containing
only high frequency structures in the galaxy Conselice 2003 The size of the smoothing
kernel  is determined by the radius of the galaxy and the value   02  15  r  02
gives the best signal for nearby systems Conselice 2003 Note that the centers of galaxies
are removed when this procedure is carried out as they often contain unresolved high-spatial
frequency light
Figure 3 shows a diagram for how these three CAS parameters are measured on a typical
nearby spiral galaxy Furthermore the CAS parameters can be combined together to create
a 3-dimension space in which dierent galaxy types can be classied For example Figure 3
shows the concentration vs asymmetry vs clumpiness diagram demonstrating how these
parameters can be used to determine morphological types of galaxies in the nearby universe
in CAS space

the concentration and asymmetry indexes plotted with colored points that reect the value of the
clumpiness for each galaxy Systems that have clumpiness values S  01 are colored red galaxies

points for C  3 For the S  C diagram red is for systems with asymmetries A  01 green have
values 01  A  035 and blue for A  035 When using these three morphological parameters
all known nearby galaxy types can be distinctly separated and distinguished in structural space
Conselice 2003
234 Other Coefficients Another popular structural measurement system is the
GiniM20 parameters which are used in a similar way to the CAS parameters to nd galaxies
of broad morphological types especially galaxies undergoing mergers eg Abraham et al
2003 Lotz et al 2004 Both of these parameters measure the relative distribution of light
within pixels and do not involve subtraction as is used for the asymmetry and clumpiness
parameters and therefore in principle may be less sensitive to high levels of background
noise eg Lotz et al 2004
The Gini coecient is a statistical tool originally used in economics to determine the

distribution of wealth within a population with higher values indicating a very unequal
distribution Gini of 1 would mean all wealthlight is in one personpixel while a lower
value indicates it is distributed more evenly amongst the population Gini of 0 would mean
everyoneevery pixel has an equal share The value of G is dened by the Lorentz curve
of the galaxys light distribution which does not take into consideration spatial position
In the calculation of these parameters each pixel is ordered by its brightness and counted
as part of the cumulative distribution see Lotz et al 2004 2008 A galaxy in this case is
considered a system with n pixels each with a ux fi where i ranges from 0 to n The Gini
coecient is then measured by
f nn  1
2i  n  1fi
where f is the average pixel ux value The second order moment parameter M20  is similar
to the concentration in that it gives a value that indicates whether light is concentrated
within an image However a M20 value denoting a high concentration a very negative value
does not imply a central concentration as in principle the light could be concentrated in
any location in a galaxy The value of M20 is the moment of the uxes of the brightest 20
of light in a galaxy which is then normalized by the total light moment for all pixels Lotz
et al 2004 2008 The mathematical form for the M20 index is

where the value of Mtot is
ficid2xi  xc2  yi  yc2cid3
where xc and yc is the center of galaxy which in the case of M20 this center is dened as
the location where the value of Mtot is minimized Lotz et al 2004 The separation for
nearby elliptical spirals and ULIRGs is similar to that found by the CAS parameters see
Lotz et al 2004 2008
Other popular parameters include the multiplicity index  which is a measure of the
potential energy of a light distribution eg Law et al 2007 Values of  range from 0
for systems that are in the most compact forms to those with values   10 which are
often very irregularpeculiar eg Law et al 2012a Another recent suite of parameters
developed by Freeman et al 2013 include features that measure the multi-mode M 
intensity I and deviation D of a galaxys light prole with the intention to locate
galaxy mergers
235 Redshift Effects on Structure One of the major issues with non-parametric
structural indices is that they will change for more distant galaxies both due to any evo-
lution but also due to distance eects creating a smaller and fainter image of the same
system This must be accounted for when using galaxy structure as a measure of evolution
eg Conselice et al 2000a Conselice 2003 Lisker 2008
There are several ways to deal with this issue which is similar to how corrections for point
spread functions in parametric tting or weak lensing analyses are done The most common
12 Christopher J Conselice
correction method for non-parametric parameters is to use image simulations These sim-
ulations are such that nearby galaxies are reduced in resolution and surface brightness to
match the redshift at which the galaxy is to be simulated at These new simulated images
are then placed into a background appropriate for the instrument and exposure time in
which the simulation takes place Conselice 2003 The outline for how to do these simula-
tions is provided in papers such as Giavalisco et al 1996 and Conselice 2003 amongst
others
To give some idea of the dicultly in reproducing the morphologies and structures of
galaxies Figure 4 shows simulated nearby early-type spirals as to how they would appear
in WFC3 imaging data from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field Conselice et al 2011a What
can be clearly seen is that it is dicult and sometimes even impossible to make out features
of these galaxies after they have been simulated
Another issue when examining the structures of distant galaxies is that these systems will
often be observed at bluer wavelengths than what is typically observed with in the nearby
universe due to the eects of redshift For example pictures of galaxies at z  12 taken
with WFPC2 and ACS are all imaged in the rest-frame ultraviolet Figure 5 shows what
rest-frame wavelength various popular lters probe as a function of redshift This shows
that we must go to the near infrared to probe rest-frame optical light for galaxies at z  1
It turns out that the qualitative and quantitative morphologies and structures of galaxies
can vary signicantly between rest-frame ultraviolet and rest-frame optical images eg
Meurer et al 1995 Hibbard  Vacca 1997 Windhorst et al 2002 Taylor-Mager et al
2007 although these morphologies are not signicantly dierent for starbursting galaxies
with little dust at both low and high redshift Dickinson 2000 Conselice et al 2000b While
it is clear that the CAS method works better at distinguishing types at redder wavelengths
eg Lanyon-Foster et al 2012 its use has also expanded into image analyses with HI
and dust-emission maps from Spitzer eg Bendo et al 2007 Holwerda et al 2011 2013
The process for accounting for the eects of image degradation is to measure the morpho-
logical index of interest at z  0 and then to remeasure the same values at higher redshift
after simulating For the morphological k-correction the approach has been to measure the
parameter of interest at dierent wavelengths and to determine by interpolation the value
at the rest-frame wavelength of interest
Using the asymmetry index as an example the nal measure after correcting for redshift
eects is
Anal  Aobs  ASBdim  Akcorr
where Akcorr is the usually negative morphological k-correction ASBdim is the posi-
tive correction for images degradation eects Other parameters can be measured the same
way This is a necessary correction to examine the evolution of a selected population at the
same eective depth resolution and rest-frame wavelength
3 The Physical Nature of Galaxy Structure
The ultimate goal in this review is to trace how structure evolves over cosmic time and
using this as a method to decipher galaxy evolution As such I present in this section
work to date which describes how physical information is derived from galaxy structural
parameters
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
Figure 4
Nearby galaxies originally observed at z  0 in the rest-frame B-band simulated to how they
would appear at z  25 also observed in the rest-frame B-band within the Hubble Ultra Deep
Field WFC3 F160W H band These systems are classied as late-type spirals Sc and Sd in the
nearby universe but can appear very dierent when simulated to higher redshifts as can be seen
here and when using quantitative measures The typical sizes of these galaxies are several kpc in
eective radii and are at a variety of distances see Conselice et al 2000a Conselice et al 2011a
These changes in structure both in apparent morphology and in terms of the structural indices
must be carefully considered before evolution is derived eg Conselice et al 2008 Mortlock et al
31 Star Formation and Galaxy Structure
The star formation process within galaxies is critical as galaxies would not exist without
stars in them Star formation is also one of the major criteria for classication within the
Hubble sequence The eects of star formation has also been used to classify spiral galaxies
into various classes eg van den Bergh 1976 Elmegreen  Elmegreen 1987
Star formation is an enormous topic with a large amount of work published eg Ken-
nicutt 1998 Kennicutt  Evans 2012 Madau  Dickinson 2014 and we thus limit our
discussion to how star formation and galaxy structure are related The integrated star for-
mation density evolution of galaxies in the universe has been studied in detail and is now
well characterized The integrated star formation rate increases from a low initial value at
z  6 to a peak at z  2 and thereafter declines At higher redshifts z  1 there is also a
well dened relation between star formation rate and stellar mass such that higher mass
galaxies have a higher rate of star formation eg Noeske et al 2007 Bauer et al 2011
This is important as galaxies undergoing star formation can have very dierent mor-
phologies and structures from passive galaxies Examples of this include clumpy spiral
arms knots of star formation central bright starbursts etc This can be seen for example
when viewing local galaxies whereby those with star formation appear clumpier and more
asymmetric than those without star formation
Furthermore there are also morphological k-correction eects such that star forming
galaxies have a smaller dierence in their morphology between ultra-violet through optical
and near-infrared light eg Windhorst et al 2002 Taylor-Mager et al 2007 This
generally reveals that at shorter wavelengths the morphologies and quantitative structures

shaded area shows the region in which the rest-frame optical light of distant galaxies can be
probed from between 038 m to 09 m As can be seen the H-band allows rest-frame light up to
z  3 to be imaged while the K-band can extend this out to z  45
are tracing the distribution of star formation directly At optical wavelengths longer than
the Balmer break we are sampling a mixture of stars at dierent ages with older ages
dominating the SEDs at longer wavelengths There are also very dusty galaxies such as
sub-mm sources and ULIRGs which can have a signicant fraction of their optical light
absorbed eg Calzetti et al 2000
It is not just apparently morphology which is aected by star formation but also the
quantitative structure It is well known that star forming galaxies without signicant dust
are quite blue but the eects of star formation can also be seen in their structure Quan-
titative measurements of structure strongly correlates with the star formation rate within
galaxies as measured by the correlation between the clumpiness index S and the H
equivalent width Conselice 2003 This is also seen in more asymmetric and clumpy light
distributions within H imaging of nearby galaxies and when examining the light distri-
bution at 24 m imaging using Spitzer Space Telescope imaging eg Bendo et al 2007
Conselice 2003 calibrate how the clumpiness index can be used as a measure of star for-
mation and Conselice et al 2000a show that asymmetry values correlate strongly with

32 Structure as a Merging Indicator
One of the primary physical eects that can be seen in the structures of galaxies is when
two galaxies merge or interact with each other When these dynamical events occur the
structures of these systems often become very peculiar and distorted especially when the
merging galaxies contain a similar amount of mass in a major merger1 We have learned
much about nearby galaxy mergers such as ULIRGs eg Joseph  Wright 1985 Sanders
 Mirabel 1996 as well as through numerical simulations eg Mihos  Hernquist 1996
that have shown convincingly that peculiar galaxies are often mergers Toomre  Toomre
1972 This demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between structure and this
fundamental galaxy formation process
Early measurements of galaxy lopsidedness through Fourier decomposition of structure
and by using the asymmetry parameter measured on nearby galaxies found a correlation
with the presence of interacting or merging neighbors eg Rix  Zaritsky 1995 Conselice
1997 Reichard et al 2008 As such galaxy structure is a powerful method for deter-
mining whether a galaxy is undergoing a recent major merger This has been measured in
many ways from using visual estimates of mergers based on peculiar structures to more
quantitative results
One automatic method for nding mergers is the CAS approach Conselice 2003 where
merging galaxies are those with a high asymmetry which is also higher than the value of
the clumpiness The simple condition
A  035  A  S
accounts for a large fraction but not all of local galaxies which are mergers  ie ULIRGs
and starbursts in mergers see Figure 3 While the contamination from non-mergers is
fairly low at a few percent the fraction of actual mergers which are identied is roughly
50 Conselice 2003 This is largely due to the fact that galaxies involved in the merger
process are only quantitatively asymmetric for about a third of the life-time of the merger
see 34
There is also the relationship found by Lotz et al 2006 for locating major mergers
using GiniM20 parameters is given by
G  014  M20  033
A more recent criteria developed by Freeman et al 2013 uses multi-mode M  intensity
I and deviation D statistics to quantify which galaxies are mergers This study shows
that a higher fraction of real mergers can be found using these indices compared with CAS
or GiniM20
One ultimate result of nding these mergers is that it allows us to calculate the merger
fraction within a population of galaxies The basic merger fraction fm is calculated as the
number of mergers selected within a given redshift bin and stellar mass limit or luminosity
cut Nm divided by the total number of galaxies within the same redshift and stellar
mass selection NT The merger fraction is thus dened as
1Note that a major merger throughout this review is a merger where the ratio of the stellar masses of
the progenitors are 13 or greater A minor merger is one with a mass ratio of less than 13
16 Christopher J Conselice
fmM z 
This merger fraction is also a function of stellar mass and redshift The CAS mergers
are nearly all major mergers Conselice 2003 2006b Lotz et al 2008 whereas GiniM20
measures all types of mergers both minor and major
Furthermore for structural samples we are calculating the merger fraction as opposed to
the galaxy merger fraction The dierence is important when comparing with pair studies
where the two progenitors can be resolved The dierence between these two is subtle but
important The merger fraction considers a merger as having already happened with the
two galaxies that have merged now counted as a single system The galaxy merger fraction
is the fraction calculated when both of these galaxies merging are considered as two separate
galaxies which they were before the nal merger
The galaxy merger fraction fgm is thus the number of galaxies merging where a system
which has already condensed into a single galaxy is counted as two galaxies divided by the
number of galaxies in the total sample For small merger fractions this ratio is about a
factor of two larger than the merger fraction which counts only the merger remnants Con-
selice 2006b The equation to derive the galaxy merger fraction with observables through
morphology with the assumption that every merging galaxy has exactly two progenitor
galaxies is given by
fgmM z 
2  NM
NT  NM
2  fm
1  fm
This relation does not hold if a merger occurs with more than two galaxies Conselice 2006b
although these are very rare de Propris et al 2007 The morphological measurement of
the nearby merger fraction gives values of fm  001 de Propris et al 2007 A discussion
of the measurement of this at higher redshifts is included 43
33 Galaxy Scale Properties and Galaxy Structure
One of the interesting facts about galaxies is that many of their characteristics can be
explained by an underlying property which is likely its halo or total mass Caon et al
1993 Disney et al 2008 As an example it was noted early on that galaxy light prole
shapes of ellipticals correlated strongly with the radius or magnitude of a galaxy eg Caon
et al 1993 This implies that the scale or mass of an elliptical galaxy has an inuence on
a galaxys overall light prole and shape
This can also be seen in the detailed structures of galaxies In general it appears that on
average galaxies with a higher degree of central concentration have larger total or stellar
masses This is also seen in the concentration index which is another measure of the degree
of light concentration with more massive galaxies having a higher value of concentration
eg Conselice 2003 This concentration also correlates with the fraction of light in bulge
and disk components This relation is such that the more concentrated a galaxy is the less
likely it will contain a signicant disk eg Conselice 2003 In fact it is likely that it is
the fraction of bulge light which drives this correlation with more massive systems more
likely to have signicant and concentrated bulges
Concentration also separates galaxies with dierent star formation histories in the local
and high redshift universe In a study using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS Strateva
et al 2001 showed that non-star forming galaxies are more concentrated than star forming
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
blue systems This can also be seen with other overall galaxy properties eg Allen et al
2006 Conselice 2006 The light concentration for ellipticals also correlates with the mass
of the central massive black hole eg Graham et al 2002 Savorgnan et al 2013
34 Numerical Simulations of Galaxy Structure
Simulations of galaxy formation are critical for interpreting and understanding the meaning
of structural indices of galaxies In fact one of the rst computer simulations of galaxy
formation by Toomre  Toomre 1972 showed that the peculiar morphologies of galaxies
seen in eg the Arp 1966 atlas were due to systems undergoing major mergers rather
than some other cause Since then numerical simulations of galaxies have proven an ef-
fective method for interpreting the structures and morphologies of galaxies in both the
local universe and at higher redshifts In many ways this approach towards understanding
galaxy morphology has just begun and promises to be a powerful and eective approach
for interpreting the meaning of structure in the future
Mihos  Hernquist 1996 was one of the rst papers to demonstrate in detail how the
peculiar galaxies seen in deep HST imaging were in fact due to the merger process using the
TREESPH hydrodynamical method from Hernquist  Katz 1989 Interest in comparing
simulated merger results with observables was largely in terms of starbursts and spectral
energy distributions of galaxies eg Barnes  Hernquist 1991 However some attempts
were made even very early to use these merger N-body models as a method of interpreting
Hubble Space Telescope morphologies of galaxies Mihos 1995
Applying quantitative structural methods described in 2 to these numerical simulations
of structural evolution was rst carried out by Conselice 2006b who used the CAS method
to calculate the time-scale of the merger process on dark-matter particle simulations nding
a merger time-scale of  03  08 Gyr for galaxies having a high enough asymmetry to
be identied as an unambiguous merger 32 This time-scale is critical for interpreting
galaxy merger fractions through cosmic time as it allows us to convert merger fraction to
merger rates and thus derive how mergers are driving galaxy formation Using these results
Conselice 2006b measure that a typical galaxy undergoes 4416
09 mergers from z  3 to
z  0
Conselice 2006b also show that the time when a merger is asymmetric is distributed
throughout the merger process and is not located at one particular time Nor would the
merging systems always be identiable as such when studied with the CAS parameters
In addition to giving a robust time-scale Conselice 2006b also show that only a fraction
about a 13 of a merging galaxys time-sequence would be found through CAS as a major
merger The time-scale derived is also largely independent of the viewing angle of the
merger and an asymmetry signal is only present within major mergers with mass ratios of
13 or greater
The simulations used in Conselice 2006b are however simple in that they do not include
the eects of star formation or dust which are well know to produce dramatic changes
in morphology eg Taylor-Mager et al 2007 34 When star formation and dust are
added to simulations of galaxy structure the quantitative structural parameters measured
are similar to those seen in nearby galaxies and the measured structure correlates with
other properties such as color in the same way it does for nearby galaxies eg Lotz et al
2008 Hambleton et al 2011
The paper Lotz et al
2008 include the rst measurements of CAS and GiniM20
parameters on numerical simulations that includes old and young stars star formation

ine how the amount of cold gas mass in progenitor galaxies inuences morphology These
simulation results are passed through the SUNRISE Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code

Lotz et al 2008b 2010ab further investigate the location in CAS and GiniM20 pa-
rameter space for mergers in dierent scenarios and for dierent properties of the merging
galaxies They investigate the time-scale for how long these simulated galaxies appear as a
merger based on where they fall in these non-parametric structural spaces see Figure 6
for an example of these simulations These papers also investigate how the dust viewing
angle orbital parameters gas properties supernova feedback and total mass alter the struc-
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
tural merger time-scale Lotz et al 2008b 2010a nd that most properties - the total
mass supernova feedback viewing angle and orbital properties of mergers have very little
inuence on the derived time-scales The mass ratio and gas mass fraction of the merging
galaxies aect the derived merger time-scales signicantly however
Mergers are identied within both CAS and GiniM20 at the rst pass of the merger as
well as when the systems nally coalesce to form a remnant Lotz et al 2008 However
merging galaxies are not found in the merger area of the non-parametric structural param-
eters for the entire merger This however allows the time-scales for structural mergers to
be calculated Lotz et al 2008 2010a nd that the asymmetry time-scales for gas-rich
major mergers are 02-04 Gyr and 006 Gyr for minor mergers Lotz et al 2010a The
GiniM20 time scales are m  02  04 Gyr These are relatively quick time-scales and
thus suggests that the observed merger fraction converts to a high merger rate
This is similar but not exactly the same as what is calculated for merger time scales
from dynamical friction for merging objects to have a separation change from ri to rf  The
dynamical friction time-scale is given by tf ric

M cid19
where vc is the relative velocity between the two merging galaxies at a given time M is
the mean accreted mass and the Coulomb logarithm ln   2 Dubinski et al 1999
Dynamical friction calculations such as these have dominated the calculation of galaxy
time-scales up until simulations of mergers reveled more subtle results although the blunt
calculations from eq 13 are often a good rough estimate for merger time-scales giving
values of  05 Gyr for equal mass mergers
Lotz et al
2008b 2010a also nd that the asymmetry index is sensitive to major
mergers of ratios of 14 or less while the GiniM20 is sensitive for mergers down to 19
 thus probing more minor mergers Lotz et al 2010b however nd that very gas rich
galaxies such as those seen in high redshift may have longer time-scales for merging with gas
rich progenitors which are likely to be more common at higher redshifts This would provide
a merger asymmetry signal for more minor mergers as long as they were more gas rich
However it is clear that massive galaxies with M0  1010 M  where most measurements
have been made to date at z  3 have a low gas mass fraction eg Erb et al 2006
Mannuci et al 2010 Conselice et al 2013
4 Measurements of Galaxy Structural Evolution
The above sections describe how we can measure the structures and morphologies of galaxies
through various approaches and the meaning of this structure In this section I discuss how
these measurements have been applied to galaxies at all redshifts to decipher how evolution
is occurring within the galaxy population
When galaxies were rst found in the distant universe they were not resolved enough to
study their structures and morphologies and the evolution of galaxies was observationally
driven by number counting and colors eg Koo  Kron 1992 with the faint blue galaxy
excess problem at faint magnitudes dominating the eld for twenty years until redshifts
for these systems became available eg Ellis 1997
The problem of galaxy evolution and formation is a large one and this review does not
focus on this question However galaxy structure and morphology reveals information
that cannot be provided by other methods
I do however give a brief overview here of
20 Christopher J Conselice
the important questions in understanding galaxy evolution For a general review of galaxy
properties at z  2 see Shapley 2011 for an observational perspective and Silk  Mamon
2012 for a theoretical one For nearby galaxys a few recent relevant reviews are Blanton
 Moustakas 2009 van der Kruit  Freeman 2011 and Conroy 2013
Galaxies are now studied up to redshifts z  7  10 although at the highest redshifts
less information is available The most common measures for these distant galaxies are
colors stellar masses star formation rates sizes and basic structures From this we know
that the volume integrated star formation rate increases with time from these ultra-high
redshifts until around z  2 when the star formation rate begins to decline see Madau 
Dickinson 2014 this volume Stellar mass measurements roughly agree with this picture
such that about half of all stellar mass is formed by z  1 eg Mortlock et al 2011
Galaxies are also much bluer in the past Finkelstein et al 2012 with some debate and
uncertainty concerning the star formation history of individual galaxies and the relevant
role and commonality of very old andor very dusty galaxies at redshifts z  1
What is largely unavailable from examining stellar masses stellar populations and star
formation histories is how these galaxies assembled Clearly galaxies are fed gas or have
very large gas reservoirs in them to sustain and produce star formation How this gas gets
into galaxies is a fundamental question as is the relative role of mergers vs star formation
in forming galaxies Since the number of massive galaxies at high redshifts is a factor of
ten or so less than those today clearly much evolution and formation in these systems has
occurred
Galaxy structure provides a way to examine this problem as it permits us to determine
which modes of galaxy formation are active within a galaxy The rst and by far the most
common method is to study the merger history through the techniques described in 32
Another method is to simply examine the visual morphologies of galaxies to determine when
the Hubble sequence is in place and after combining with color size and star formation
rates to determine when spirals and ellipticals are roughly in their current form In par-
ticular the examination of the sizes of galaxies has provided a very puzzling evolution such
that galaxies of similar masses are up to a factor of 2-5 times smaller than corresponding
galaxies seen today eg Buitrago et al 2008 Cassata et al 2013
Furthermore resolved imaging allows us to study the formation history of individual com-
ponents of galaxies such as disks bulges spiral arms clumps of star formation etc which
reveals formation information not available when examining the galaxy as a whole This
section which is the heart of this review article provides the current observational evidence
for morphological and structural evolution and what it implies for galaxy formation
41 Observed Evolution of the Hubble Sequence
The rst science result I discuss is how the visual Hubble sequence evolves throughout
the universe This can simply be restated as measuring the number density and relative
fractions of galaxy types at a given selection which are classied as ellipticals spirals and
peculiars As mentioned earlier we do not consider irregulars as these are typically lower
mass galaxies that are not detected at high redshift due to their faintness It is also largely
impossible to use ner classications such as Sa or Sb on distant galaxies as the resolution
is not good enough even with Hubble Space Telescope imaging to resolve this type of detail
More distant galaxies also appear to be quite dierent from Hubble types making this type
of detailed morphologies unnecessary and undesirable eg Conselice 2005
This relates to a fundamental question that has been asked since galaxies were discovered

derived from three dierent surveys  SDSS for nearby galaxies POWIR survey Conselice et al
2007 for systems up to z  2 and the GOODS NICMOS Survey for systems for systems at
z  18  3 In this plot disk-like galaxies are those with Sersic indices n  25 and spheroid-like
galaxies are for those with n  25 The right panel shows the morphological evolution as judged
from visual estimates Plotted here is both the fraction of types as well as the number density
evolution The orange shading gives the total number density of all galaxies as a function of
redshift up to z  3 As can be seen there is a gradual transition from galaxies that appear
peculiar and disk-like in their Sersic indices at high redshifts z  15 which gradually transform
into early types today
which is whether or not a galaxy retains its morphology over a long period of cosmic time
Otherwise if morphological transformations do occur what processes drive this internal
or external and how often does a galaxy change its morphology
One of the rst observations noted when examining the rst deep HST images was that
many of the fainter galaxies were peculiar eg Driver et al 1995 Abraham et al 1996
Schade et al 1995 These early studies were limited to examining galaxy number counts
as no redshifts were known for these faint galaxies In addition to a faint blue excess it
22 Christopher J Conselice

The latest version of the evolution of the Hubble sequence with redshift for galaxies with
M  1010 M  These classications are corrected for image degradation such that
misclassication due to distance are accounted for within these fractions Mortlock et al 2013
Examples of images of galaxies in each of these bins is shown in the observed H160-band or
rest-frame optical Further analysis shows that there is a downsizing trend such that the most
massive galaxies form into Hubble sequence galaxies earlier than lower mass galaxies Mortlock et
al 2013
was clear that there was also a peculiar excess and often for the faintest galaxies This is
where the eld remained until redshifts for a signicant number of these peculiar galaxies
were obtained
The eld of high redshift studies changed dramatically in 1995-1997 with the advent of
the both the Hubble Deep Fields HDF Williams et al 1996 Ferguson et al 2001 and
the discovery of a signicant population of high-redshift galaxies that could be discovered by
the Lyman-Break technique Steidel et al 1996 Shapley 2011 now referred to as Lyman-
Break Galaxies LBGs The HDF and later signicant campaigns to obtain very deep
Hubble imaging such as the Hubble Deep Field South Williams et al 2000 the Great
Observatories Origins Deep Survey GOODS Giavalisco et al 2004 the Hubble Ultra
Deep Field UDF Beckwith et al 2006 the COSMOS eld Scoville et al 2007 the
Extended Groth Strip survey EGS Davis et al 2007 and most recently the CANDELS
survey Grogin et al 2011 Koekemoer et al 2011 have revolutionized the eld of galaxy
formation studies and in particular the study of morphologies
The critical nature of these deep elds is not simply that they are deeper than previous
deep HST imaging but that they are the fulcrum of large-scale eorts to obtain photom-
etry at the faintest levels possible at nearly all wavelengths This allowed redshifts to be
measured for most galaxies using photometry through so-called photometric redshifts eg
Dahlen et al 2013 for a recent discussion of the use of this method The availability
of these redshifts allows us to measure evolution over broad redshift ranges which was not
possible before as spectroscopic samples were few and far between even with the use of
relatively large multi-slit spectrographs such as LRIS on Keck eg Cohen et al 1996

The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
Early observations using a mixture of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts showed
that the Hubble sequence was certainly not in place at high redshifts z  1 van den Bergh
1996 when examined using WFC2 data This was veried in the rest-frame optical after
deep near-infrared NICMOS observations of the HDF were taken in 1998 Dickinson 2000
A deeper analysis of this showed that using the rest-frame optical structures of galaxies
the Hubble sequence was nearly completely absent at z  2 and only at z  15 did spirals
and ellipticals become as common as peculiar galaxies Conselice et al 2005 Buitrago et
al 2013 Figure 7
The latest results on the evolution of visual morphology as dened solely by visual types
from the CANDELS survey is shown in Figure 8 Mortlock et al 2013 for systems with
stellar masses M  1010 M  It must be stressed that this gure only shows the visual
estimates of galaxy morphology The classication of a spiral elliptical or peculiar does
not imply that these galaxies have a certain star formation rate color mass or size In
fact what is often seen is that these visual morphologies do not correlate well with other
physical properties eg Conselice et al 2011b Mortlock et al 2013 What is also seen is
a stellar mass dierence in the formation history of the Hubble sequence with the highest
mass galaxies appearing to form into visual ellipticals and disks before lower mass systems
Mortlock et al 2013
What Figures 7 and 8 show is that at z  2 the dominant morphological type is peculiar
while disks and ellipticals become more common at lower redshifts see also Conselice et
al 2005 Kriek et al 2009 Delgado-Serrano et al 2010 Mortlock et al 2013 Figures 9
and 10 show images of the most massive galaxies at both z  1 and z  2 in the Hubble
Ultra Deep Field demonstrating the stark dierences between the two This review later
examines in 43 what these peculiars are potentially evolving into at lower redshifts There
is however a general trend such that peculiar systems and galaxies with internal features
such as blobs have a higher star formation rate than smoother galaxies eg Lee et al
2013 This shows that while the Hubble sequence itself is not formed early in the history
of the universe there are trends which suggest it is becoming established
Another interesting aspect to examine is not only the fraction of dierent galaxy types at
various redshifts but also their number density evolution as a function of galaxy type We
know from galaxy stellar mass measurements that the most massive systems are largely in
place at z  1 at the same number density as at z  1 eg Bundy et al 2005 Mortlock
et al 2011 It is the lower mass galaxies which typically increase the most in terms of
the relative number density from the epoch z  0  2 In the nearby universe most of the
massive galaxies are ellipticals thus this implies that most of the evolution in morphology
will also be within the lower mass galaxies which is what is found In additional to a mass
downsizing we also nd a morphological downsizing such that morphological ellipticals are
formed before the other galaxy types most notably the spirals However whether these
galaxies are inherently similar to the ellipticals and disks today is a separate question
411 The Formation of Ellipticals and Disks - Bars Bulges Disks and Spiral
Arms One of the major questions in galaxy evolution we would like to address is when
modern spirals and ellipticals form This is related to the formation of the Hubble sequence
but is a more detailed question as what appears as an ellipticalspiral may be quite dierent
from systems classied this way in the local universe We thus are interested in determining
when systems with the same morphology to galaxies we see in the local universe ie disks
and ellipticals achieve a similar physical state as measured through other properties While
morphological fractions are similar at z  05  08 as seen in the nearby universe physical

properties of galaxies with similar types - such as colors star forming knots and tidal
features have not reach the same level as locally It is only recently at z  03 that the
galaxy population appears in most ways similar to that of today
This question can also be further divided into many sub-questions but for the purposes
of this review I will examine the formation history of galaxies identiable as disks and
ellipticals in their gross morphology as well as the formation of more detailed features such
as spiral arms bulges and bars
One major issue is the bar fraction of galaxies and how it has evolved with time Early
studies found that the bar fraction evolves signicantly Abraham et al 1999 while later
studies nd that bars were already in place up to z  1 Elmegreen Elmegreen  Hirst
2004 Jogee et al 2004 Using the two degree area COSMOS HST survey Sheth et al
2008 nd that the bar fraction increases from z  084 to z  02 from 20 to  60 of
all disk galaxies Sheth et al 2008 however nd that the bar fraction is roughly constant
with redshift for the most massive and red disk galaxies
In fact most of the observed
evolution occurs for the lower mass bluer disk galaxies
The fraction of spiral galaxies with bars tells us when the disks in these galaxies become
dynamically mature enough to form these structures The fraction of bars also allows us
to determine if bars have a role in the evolution of star formation bulge formation and
the triggering of AGN and the formation of supermassive black holes The observational
studies above all locate bars within disks either through changes in ellipticity and position
angle in the surface brightness proles of galaxies or through visual inspection It remains
to be seen how the bar fraction holds when observed with a near-infrared band such as
within the CANDELS survey
A related issue is nding the onset of spiral structure which has remained a problem
for a variety of reasons especially the diculty of an unambiguous detection due to res-
olutiondepth issues Several papers published with the advent of ACS on HST showed
that there are many examples of disk-like morphological systems at high redshifts This
includes the disks found by Labbe et al 2003 the Luminous Diuse Objects of Conselice
et al 2004 and later systems identied by Elmegreen et al 2007 as clump-clusters
More recently Law et al 2012 discovered a galaxy with a likely bona-de spiral structure
at z  218 which also contained a large internal velocity dispersion based on IFU spec-
troscopy Spiral arms however appear very rare at high redshift and likely only a small
number are formed before z  1 This is a major problem that needs more addressing and
could be done with recently available data However there are many galaxies with clumpy
features that are potentially spiral arms and disks in formation which we discuss in detail
in 44
Another feature of spirals and disks if the formation of bugles While the traditional
scenario is that bulges form in mergers 43 recent results suggest that bulges can form
in multiple ways Psedo-bulges are dierent from classical bulges in that they are likely
formed through secular processes within a disk This can be seen in the dierent correlations
between bulge properties and central massive black holes eg Kormendy  Ho 2013
While morphology itself can often be ambiguous in terms of matching with contemporary
Hubble types integral eld unit IFU or long slit spectroscopy can remove some degenera-
cies In particular the use of integral eld spectroscopy on z  1 systems reveals important
clues about the nature of these high redshift galaxies Forster Schreiber et al 2009 Glaze-
brook et al 2013 Currently the most inuential studies have been carried out with the
SINFONI IFU on the VLT as well as some work done with OSIRIS on Keck Law et al
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
These surveys most notably the SINS collaboration eg Forster Schreiber et al 2009
nd an equal distribution of dierent kinematic classes which are rotationally dominated
mergers and very compact galaxies with a high velocity dispersions eg Buitrago et al
2013b for massive galaxies The true nature of these systems is not yet known although
in general it appears that galaxies at z  2 which are clumpy tend to have high velocity
dispersions This perhaps reveals the formation modes of disk galaxies at high redshift
results in a high velocity dispersion The future looks promising for combining larger
surveys of IFU measurements of distant galaxies with resolved morphologies to decipher
evolution Large surveys with for example KMOS on VLT and MOSFIRE on Keck will
revolutionize this area in the coming years
42 Size and Prole Shape Evolution
One of the most important ndings in galaxy evolution studies in the past decade has been
the discovery that distant galaxies are more compact than systems of the same mass in
the local universe eg Daddi et al 2005 Trujillo et al 2007 Buitrago et al 2008 van
Dokkum et al 2008 2010 Weinzirl et al 2011 Baro et al 2013 Williams et al 2014
This change in sizes with time is now well characterized and the evolution of galaxy
sizes at a constant stellar mass selection of M  1011 M can be characterized by a power
law of the form Re  1  z The value of the power-law slope changes with the
galaxy surface brightness type such that the disk-like galaxies with Sersic indices n  25
evolve with   082  003 while spheroid-like galaxies with n  25 have   148 
004 Figure 11 This demonstrates that there is a faster evolution in measured sizes for
spheroid-like galaxies which therefore have a more eective increase in size over cosmic
time than the disk-like objects
This size evolution is such that the eective radii of massive galaxies increases by up to
a factor of ve between z  3 and today at the same stellar mass eg Buitrago et al
2008 Cassata et al 2013 The form of this evolution has been investigated to determine
whether or not the increase is due to the build up of the entire galaxy or just the inner or
outer parts The data to date show that galaxy growth through sizes is occurring in its
outer parts with the central parts in place at early times eg Carrasco et al 2010 van
Dokkum et al 2010 This indicates that the build up of massive galaxies is an inside out
process whereby the inner parts of massive galaxies are in place before the outer parts with
the same stellar mass density as today eg Hopkins et al 2009
An alternative way to investigate this problem is to examine the number of compact
and ultra-compact galaxies at various redshifts There is some controversy over whether
or not there exist in the local universe compact galaxies with sizes similar to those seen at
high redshifts However what is clear is that the number densities of these ultra-compact
galaxies declines in relative abundance very steeply at z  2 Cassata et al 2013
The processes responsible for this increase in sizes at lower redshifts is not well understood
and is currently a source of much debate The most popular explanation is that this size
increase is produced through minor mergers eg Bluck et al 2012 McLure et al 2013
although other ideas such as AGN performing work on gas is another idea eg Bluck et
al 2011 However the outer parts of nearby massive galaxies are too old to have been
formed in relatively recent star formation and the star formation observed at high redshift
is not sucient to produce the observed increase in sizes Ownsworth et al 2012
The major idea for the physical mechanism producing galaxy size evolution is through dry
minor mergers as major mergers are not able to produce the observation of increasing size

2011 The size evolution is divided into galaxies with elliptical-like proles with Sersic indices
n  25 and disk-like proles having n  25 The measured eective radius re is plotted as a
function of the ratio with the average size of galaxies at the same stellar mass measurements with
M  1011 M at z  0 from Shen et al 2003
without signicantly increasing mass eg Khochfar  Silk 2006 Naab et al 2009 Bluck
et al 2012 Oser et al 2012 Shankar et al 2013 There is currently some controversy
over whether or not the observed minor merger rate is high enough to provide this increase
in sizes with the most massive galaxies with M  1011 M appearing to have enough
minor mergers eg Kaviraj et al 2009 to produce this size evolution Bluck et al 2012
but this may not be the case for lower mass systems eg Newman et al 2012 It does
appear however that minor mergers are a signicant mechanism for producing low levels of
star formation in early-types at z  08 as well as for adding signicant amount of stellar
mass to these galaxies Kaviraj et al 2009 2011 One of the major issues is determining
not only the number of minor dry mergers but also the time-scale for these mergers 34
which more simulations would help understand
Along with the evolution of galaxy sizes there is also a signicant evolution in the un-
derlying structures of galaxies at higher redshifts One of the cleanest ways to see this is
through the evolution of the Sersic parameter n Figure 7 When examining the evolution
of derived values of n as a function of redshift for both a stellar mass and at a constant
number density selection it is apparent that galaxies have lower n values at higher redshifts
for the same selection eg Buitrago et al 2013 this has been interpreted by some to
imply that these galaxies are more disk-like at high redshifts Bruce et al 2012 although
the morphologies of these systems by visual inspection and their internal structures and
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
colors are not similar to modern disks eg Conselice et al 2011 Mortlock et al 2013 It
appears that these disk-like galaxies while having light proles similar to modern disks are
much smaller have a higher stellar mass and are often undergoing intense star formation
with peculiar morphologies making them un-disk-like in all other regards They indeed are
likely a type of galaxy with no local counterpart
43 The Merger History
One of the primary if not the primary use of galaxy structure at high redshift at the time
of writing is using it to measure the merger history of galaxies This is a major issue in
extragalactic astronomy as merging is not only a method for galaxies to form but is also a
potential way in which black holes star formation and other internal features of galaxies are
assembled Merging is also one of the key predictions of the Cold Dark Matter model which
is the dominant idea for how galaxy evolution occurs through cosmic time eg White 
Rees 1978 Blumenthal et al 1984 Cole et al 2000
The merger history of galaxies was rst measured through galaxies in pairs - systems of
at least two galaxies near enough to each other to merge in a reasonable amount of time
typically 20 or 30 kpc and in the case of kinematic pairs with a low velocity dierence of
around 200 km s1eg Patton et al 1997 2002 Le Fevre et al 2000 Lopez-Sanjuan et
al 2011 2012 Simulation results show that most pairs of galaxies selected in this way will
eventually merge and within a time-scale comparable to dynamical friction eg Moreno
et al 2013 Using pairs to nd galaxies which are merging is still a large industry and
interested readers are referred to the latest papers in this eld eg Lopez-Sanjuan et al
2011 2012 Tasca et al 2013 Pairs of galaxies also provide a check on the methodology we
use to nd major mergers as it is an independent measure of this formation mode However
the merger fraction measured through pairs is more statistical in nature than structure and
does not reveal for certain whether a galaxy is a merger or not
A detailed CAS structural study of starburst ULIRGs and other merging galaxies shows
that another route for measuring the merger history is through the use of the asymmetry
index whereby the most asymmetric galaxies are ones involved in mergers Conselice 1997
Conselice et al 2000ab Conselice 2003 32 The merger history is also measured through
other parameters whereby mergers occupy a unique parameter space eg Lotz et al 2004
2008 Freeman et al 2013
While there is no perfect 11 relation between parameter space denitions of mergers
with all mergers identiable by eye we still nd that about half of all identiable mergers
fall within specic regions of parameter space and that there is a low contamination from
other galaxy types 32 Thus galaxy merger fractions are an observation which has to
be interpreted carefully with the use of galaxy merger models
The merger fraction history is the basic
431 The Merger Fraction Evolution
observable which reveals how mergers are changing and evolving through cosmic time It is
measured at high redshift through the criteria described in 32 and the resulting merger
fractions are shown in Figure 12 eg Conselice et al 2008 2009 Bluck et al 2012
This gure shows that the inferred merger fraction increases with redshift This increase is
typically t as a power-law of the form
fm  f0  1  zm
30 Christopher J Conselice
where f0 is the merger fraction at z  0 and m is the power-law index for measuring mergers
In general the higher the value of m the more steeply the merger history increases at higher
redshifts An alternative parameterization of the merger history is given by a combined
power-law exponential eg Conselice et al 2008 whose form is
fm    1  zmexp1  z
The local z  0 merger fraction in this formalism is given by fm0   exp and the
merger peak is located at zpeak  1  m This form of the merger fraction evolution
appears to t lower mass galaxy merger fractions better than a single power-law up to
z  3 as this allows for a peak at a value of the mergers and a decline at higher redshifts
In fact only the highest mass galaxies with M  1010 M appear to increase up to z  3
while lower mass galaxies have a merger peak around z  15  25 and declining at higher
redshifts eg Conselice et al 2008
While it initially appeared that there were signicant dierences in merger histories be-
tween dierent studies eg Lin et al 2004 it is now clear that these are due to several
eects The rst is that the value of the power-law index m can vary signicantly just
due to the value of the anchor redshift at z  0 Secondly when comparisons are done
between galaxies selected in the same way stellar mass or absolute magnitude and cor-
rect time-scales are used for dierent techniques 34 then merger rates agree within the
uncertainties eg Conselice et al 2009 Lotz et al 2011
The merger history tends to peak at z  25 for massive galaxies with M  1010 M at
values of fm  03  04 and decline at lower redshifts The values for m found in the
literature can vary signicantly but most of this is due to dierent selections dierent
redshift ranges used and the use of various values for the local merger fraction The rst
studies using pairs nd a very steep increase up to z  1 with m  2809 for a luminosity
selected sample up to z  04 Patton et al 1997 The value of m was later found by
Patton et al 2002 to be m  23  07 within the CNOC2 redshift survey up to z  055
Le Fevre et al 2000 measure the merger fraction using 285 galaxies in the CFRS and
LDSS surveys up to z  1 nding a power-law index of m  32  06 although this
lowers to m  27  06 after considering selection eects Other studies have found similar
values with m  15  07 for brighter galaxies in the VVDS de Ravel et al 2009 and
m  31  01 for pairs up to z  1 in the COSMOS eld Kartaltepe et al 2007 These
are however all relatively nearby galaxies at z  1 For higher redshifts Bluck et al 2009
nd a power-law of m  30  04 for galaxies with M  1011 M using pairs from the
GOODS NICMOS Survey
Within morphological studies Conselice et al 2003 nd a high m index of m  4 for
massive galaxies with M  1010 M  with m values around m  1  2 for lower mass
galaxies This is similar to what is found by Le Fevre et al 2000 when examining the
merger history of visually disturbed galaxies in Hubble imaging This was conrmed by
Conselice et al 2008 using the same methods but on the Hubble Ultra Deep Field data
Conselice et al 2003 also show how the merger fraction slope m can vary signicantly
depending on what redshift limit is used and whether stellar mass or luminosity cuts are
applied to the selected sample In a detailed study of z  1 galaxies from the COSMOS
survey Conselice et al 2009 nd an index of m  23  04 for galaxies with stellar masses
of M  1010 M  On the other hand Lotz et al 2008 nd that the merger fraction
does not evolve signicantly with redshift between z  02  12 with a weak increase in
the merger fraction with m  023  103 using the GiniM20 methods Later however it
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
was shown that GiniM20 is very sensitive to minor mergers and once these eects are
considered the tted parameter is m  2 up to z  12 Lotz et al 2011 Other methods
of measuring the merger or interaction rate includes looking for ringed galaxies DOnghia
et al 2008 a method which derives a merger fraction index with m  3
The merger fraction is simply just an ob-
432 Galaxy Merger Rate Evolution
servational quantity as it is the fraction of galaxies in a sample which have merged with
another galaxy This merger fraction can eectively be anything from zero to near unity
depending on the mass ratio and time-scales of interest Merger fractions must therefore be
carefully interpreted The physical quantity we are interested in is the merger rate which
gives the number of mergers occurring per unit time and in some cases per unit volume per
unit time
Bluck et al 2012 Lotz et al 2008 and Conselice 2006b show that CAS is only
sensitive to major mergers of mass ratios of 41 and greater and has a particular time-scale
of about  05 Gyr associated with the merger sensitivity 34 This is very similar to the
merger parameter sensitivity when using pairs of galaxies with mass ratios of 41 or greater
ie major pairs Thus by examining the merger fraction with CAS we are likely tracing
the same systems as measured through galaxies in pairs
The merger fraction is converted into a galaxy merger rate through the use of the merger
time-scale m which can be derived through simulations Lotz et al 2010a see 34 or
through the decline in the merger fraction at lower redshifts Conselice 2009 The result
of both approaches is that the CAS merger time-scale is around 05 Gyr for a galaxy to
remain peculiar in parameter space with the merger time-scale in GiniM20 at a similar
level but which is more sensitive to minor mergers 34
Using the merger time scale the merger rate per galaxy is thereby dened by the param-
eter  eg Bluck et al 2009 Conselice et al 2009
M z 
The value of  is in units of Gyr giving the average amount of time between mergers for
a galaxy within the given selection property typically stellar mass and within a given
redshift range Note that within the denition of  the galaxy merger fraction is used
rather than the merger fraction 32 The value of  as a function of redshifts for CAS
merger measures and pair selection mergers sample is shown in Figure 13
Using the evolution of the galaxy merger rate per galaxy  the the number of merg-
ers that occur between various redshifts is calculated by integrating the inverse of  over
redshift
Nmerg  Z t2
1dt  Z z2
1  z
The result of this is studied in detail in Conselice et al 2009 and Bluck et al 2009
with initial results using simulations discussed in Conselice 2006b The result of these
calculations show that the number of major mergers a galaxy undergoes between z  3 and
z  1 is 4308 major mergers at z  3 Conselice et al 2008 for galaxies selected with
stellar masses M  1010 M  There also appears to be a limited number of mergers at
higher redshifts z  3 Conselice  Arnold 2009
The  denition of the merger rate is per galaxy and thus does not take into account the
overall merger rate within the universe Thus ultimately we are interested in the galaxy

merger rate M z

where nm is the number density of galaxies at a given redshift While this is the ultimate
quantity in galaxy merger studies it is dicult to measure and the number density nm
has its own associated uncertainties eg Mortlock et al 2011 In Figure 13 we plot the
merger rate for galaxies using the CAS systems for pairs and mergers using the number
densities of galaxies from Mortlock et al 2011
While the number of mergers is an interesting and fundamental quantity we are ulti-
mately interested in the amount of stellar mass added from mergers to galaxies over time
The total amount of stellar mass accreted into a galaxy is calculated as a double integral
over the redshift range of interest z1 to z2 or look-back times t1 and t2 and over the
stellar masses range in which is being probed M1 to M2 and can be expressed as
MM  Z t2
t1 Z M2
M 
mz M
mM
dMdz
where mM is the merger time-scale which depends on the stellar mass of the merging
pair Bluck et al 2012 From this we calculate the total integration of the amount of mass
assembled through merging for galaxies with stellar masses M  1011 M  For a z  3
mass complete sample at this limit Conselice et al 2013 nd a value MMM0 
056  015 where M0 is the initial average stellar mass at z  3 and MM is the
average amount of stellar mass accreted in mergers at z  1  3 This ratio is the fractional
amount of stellar mass added both due to major and minor mergers for systems with stellar
mass ratios down to 1100 for an average massive galaxy after following a merger adjusted
constant co-moving density Conselice et al 2013 By observing the number of mergers we
can get an idea of how much gas is added to galaxies through the merger process Comparing
this to the star formation rate there is a large deciency which must be accounted for by gas
accreted from the intergalactic medium Using this number and the observed star formation
rate within these galaxies the gas accretion rate from the intergalactic medium is calculated
at around 100 M year1 adding roughly the same amount of stellar mass to these galaxies
as mergers Conselice et al 2013
44 Resolved Morphological Formation Histories
Independent of the formation of the gross or bulk galaxy structure is the formation of their
stars and how this correlates with structure and its assembly This is eectively done by
examining the spectral energy distributions of individual components in galaxies ie disks
or bulges andor a newer technique of examining the SEDs of individual pixels With
resolved imaging it is therefore possible to determine to some extend the star formation
history of individual resolution elements eg Abraham et al 1999 Zibetti et al 2009 as
well as the stellar mass within these eg Lanyon-Foster et al 2007
Early results using small samples of few dozen galaxies at z  1 Abraham et al 1999
demonstrated that many morphologically selected ellipticals in their sample show a diver-
sity in their star formation histories with recent bursts of star formation commonly seen
Abraham et al 1999 also showed that bulges in these systems almost always have ages
older than their disks This was followed up with a study of 79 eld spheroids by Menan-
teau et al 2001 who nd that a third of their morphologically regular systems have recent

star formation in their centers with so-called blue cores It is possible that some of these
systems are forming the pseudo-bulges that we see in the nearby universe
There are other studies of the bulges of distant galaxies including Hathi et al 2009
who nd that bulges at 08  z  13 have ages of a 1-2 Gyr with stellar masses up to 1010
M in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field They also nd that late type bulges are younger than
early types a nding which also exists in the local universe However classical bulges up
to z  1 with de Vaucouleur proles are found to have old stellar populations similar to
giant ellipticals at the same epoch Koo et al 2005
Another potentially powerful approach towards understanding the formation history of
galaxies is to examine their light distribution on a pixel by pixel basis The idea here is
that each pixel or resolution element is independent of others and each has their own SED
which can be t by stellar population analysis methods eg Bothun 1986 Abraham et
al 1999 Lanyon-Foster et al 2007 Local galaxies have dierent pixel color magnitude
diagrams depending on morphological type with early types having a much narrow locus
of points than disk galaxies

of commonly found galaxies at high-redshifts typically around z  2 as seen in deep WFC3
images from surveys such as CANDELS For each of these galaxies the top rows demonstrate the
image in the IJH HST bands the rest-frame U-V color map and a map which indicates whether
pixels belong to the inner colored red outer green or clump region dark blue for each galaxy
The solid black ellipses show the area which contains half of the rest-frame U-band light for each
system The second row for each galaxy shows the U-band light prole which is color coded by the
pixel type labeled in the U  B color map and on the right by the location of the various pixels

that the large clumps seen in distant star forming galaxies are mostly star forming regions
Clumps are also found to be central o-central or outer and these clumps may play a role
in forming the bulges of these galaxies through a secular process Bournaud et al 2007
Elmegreen et al 2008 Genzel et al 2008 5 This shows that there are methods beyond
hierarchical clustering for the formation of structures within galaxies
45 High Redshift AGNStarbursts and Star Formation Quenching
One of the major ideas behind how mergers drive galaxy formation is that when galaxies
merge gas clouds collide triggering star formation At the same time gas is driven to
the centers of galaxies producing active galactic nuclei AGN eg Hopkins et al 2008
Observationally we also know that galaxies which are concentrated with for example a
high Sersic prole are more likely to be quenched eg Bell et al 2012 Fan et al 2013
There is therefore a strong theoretical reason to expect that structure as inuenced by
mergers should correlate with galaxy formation There is also strong evidence that the
star formation in galaxies is regulated by structure How these relate however is not yet
Observational it has proven thus far dicult to correlate the presence of mergers through
either pairs or the presence of a distorted or peculiar structures with the presence of AGN
or a star formation excess at high redshift Recent studies such as Cotini et al 2013
use CAS indices to show that the fraction of nearby galaxies with AGN are roughly ve
times more likely than a control sample to have a distorted structure However studies
at higher redshifts generally do not nd that more asymmetric or merging galaxies have a
higher AGN fraction eg Grogin et al 2005 Gabor et al 2009 Kocevski et al 2012
This is also found in the deepest ACS Hubble imaging although it does appear that AGN
are found in more concentrated galaxies at higher redshifts Grogin et al 2005 There is
also a lack of a higher fraction of peculiarmerging galaxies found in the GEMSSTAGES
HST survey by Bohm et al 2013 for AGN with luminosities of LX  1044 erg s1 This
may be an indication that Type-1 AGN are more likely to be found in early-type massive
systems It remains to be seen if obscured AGN the Type-2s are found in more merging
systems and thereby represent an earlier phase of the merger
Another major issue in which morphology and structure play an important role is un-
derstanding the origin of dusty star forming galaxies the so-called ULIRGs or sub-mm
galaxies Sub-mm galaxies are those which appear very bright at sub-mm wavelengths
typically at 850 m and are at high-redshift at z  1 Morphological analyses of these sub-
mm galaxies showed early on that they are involved in merger activity and have peculiar
morphologies eg Chapman et al 2003 Conselice et al 2003b Many of these galaxies
have structures and morphologies consist with being involved in mergers eg Ricciardelli
et al 2011 Kartaltepe et al 2012 nd that a sample of ULIRGs selected from the
CANDELS elds are more likely than a eld galaxy sample to be involved in galaxy inter-
actions and mergers 725
7 vs 323 However Swinbank et al 2010 argue using a
large sample of sub-mm galaxies that their morphologies are not signicantly dierent from
other star forming eld galaxies at similar redshifts Swinbank et al 2010 also nd that
their sub-mm galaxies have light proles more similar to early-types than disks Although
Targett et al 2011 nd that sub-mm galaxies have disk-like proles and conclude that
these systems are more like forming disks than spheroids forming in mergers This suggests
that the morphology of sub-mm galaxies is still open for debate with results that appear
to be conicting More detailed work likely with adaptive optics in the K-band to avoid
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
issues with dust and morphological k-corrections are needed to make further progress
Furthermore as mentioned earlier there is a strong observed correlation between galaxies
which have steep surface brightness proles with n  25 and the quenching of star for-
mation eg Bell 2012 This shows that galaxy structure either produces a change in the
galaxy history or more likely is a symptom of the eects which produces this quenching
In general there are a few ways to quench the star formation seen in galaxies at high red-
shift Some of these are environmental such as ram-pressure stripping and strangulation
eg Peng et al 2010 However these processes will be ineective for the bulk of eld
galaxies which we study in this review What is more likely driving the quenching of typical
eld galaxies is merger driven or driven by the stellarhalo mass in some form of feedback
process eg Peng et al 2010 Peng et al 2012 Lilly et al 2013 Carollo et al 2013
The most likely candidates are mergers that either heats gas or removes most of it in giant
starbursts preventing further star formation The other idea for this feedback is that it is
the result of AGN The idea here is that the ongoing star formation is truncated by the
existing gas in a galaxy being heated or removed by an active AGN eg Croton et al
2006 It is therefore likely that a few critical processes are ongoing to produce the Hubble
sequence and specically the red passive and concentrated high mass systems
46 The z  3  6 Frontier
By far the bulk of what we know of galaxy structural evolution is at z  3 The reason for
this is simply because this is the limit where we can observe the rest-frame optical using
observations in the near-infrared from the Hubble Space Telescope which is only eective at
imaging at lters bluer than the H-band often H160 with WFC3 and NICMOS However
there are some observations of galaxy structure at even higher redshifts that provides some
information about the formation of these galaxies To date most of these observations are
done in a red lter using the ACS camera on Hubble either the I814 or z850 band It must
be remembered that these systems are being observed in the rest-frame ultraviolet and
thus their morphologies will be dominated by young stars
There have only been a few major studies that focus on the structures of these ultra-high
redshift galaxies Ferguson et al
2004 study the sizes and the axis ratios of Lyman-
break galaxies LBGs galaxies up to z  6 in the GOODS elds nding that galaxies are
smaller and more disk-like in their axis ratios at higher redshifts This was also shown in
an extensive study of 4700 LBGs by Ravindranath et al 2006 who nd that 40 have
exponential light proles 30 have de Vaucouleurs proles and the remaining 30 have
multiple cores The ellipticity distribution of these LBGs shows that these systems are
skewed towards high values with   05 which cannot be explained by viewing disks and
spheroids at various angles Ravindranath et al 2006 This is either an indication that
these systems are mergers or that star formation is distributed in the outer parts of these
galaxies creating these elliptical structures
For ultra-high redshift galaxies Conselice  Arnold 2009 examine the visual morpholo-
gies and pair fractions of Lyman-break galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field ACS Filters
from z  46 These ACS data on the UDF still provide the highest resolution and deepest
imaging of the most distant galaxies Conselice  Arnold 2009 nd that the fraction of
z  3  6 Lyman-break galaxies which are peculiar in appearance is roughly constant at
 30 throughout this redshift range Conselice  Arnold furthermore demonstrate that
many of the LBGs at these redshifts have tidal like features  fans shells etc that resemble
merger signatures seen at lower redshifts The derived merger fraction from LBG pairs also
38 Christopher J Conselice
agrees with the merger fraction based on CAS and visual estimates Conselice  Arnold
2009 Cooke et al 2010
It is perhaps surprisingly easier to identify galaxies in pairs at these redshifts than at lower
redshifts as one can use the drop-out band to remove contamination and thus ensure that
two galaxies close by in the sky are at least at a similar redshift This results in a smaller
correction needed to calculate merger fractions and thus the merger fraction in principle
can be measured more accurately Conselice  Arnold 2009 Jiang et al 2013 similarly
examine the rest-frame UV morphologies of 51 Lyman galaxies and 16 Lyman-break
galaxies and nd a merger fraction for the brightest galaxies of around 50 and otherwise
a diversity in morphology
Most recently using WFC3 data from the UDF Oesch et al 2010 show that z  7  8
galaxies are very compact with a typical size of 0703 kpc with little size evolution down
to z  6 There is more development down to z  4 with the observation of more extensive
wings of light at these lower redshifts and a corresponding increase in sizes eg Ferguson et
al 2004 following a similar power-law with redshift as is found for size evolution between
z  3 and z  0 Buitrago et al 2008 Mosleh et al 2012
47 Role of Environment in Structure Formation
Galaxy morphology is well known to correlate strongly in the local universe with environ-
ment eg Dressler 1984 Postman et al 2005
It is also clear that there is a strong
relationship between morphology and stellar mass such that the most massive galaxies
tend to have elliptical morphologies and lack star formation Combining this with the
morphology-redshift relation shows that the structure of a galaxy depends upon its mass
local environment as well as time Which of these is the leading cause for producing galaxy
evolution is an active area of study
The problem of galaxy morphology as a function of density is a large area of research and
is outside the immediate scope of this article However it is relevant to discuss some of the
major ndings and how they relate to the evolution of galaxy structure with time The
major eect of morphology is that the type of galaxy either elliptical or spiral depends
to a large degree in the nearby universe on the local density of that particular galaxys
environment This relation is such that the higher the density of the local environment the
more likely a galaxy will be early-type and non-star forming eg Dressler 1984 Gomez
et al 2003 Blanton  Moustakas 2009 Disk properties are also highly environmentally
driven with few classical bulge or elliptical systems in low density environments Kormendy
et al 2010
It is also the case that more massive galaxies are more likely to be early type The
question is which relationship is more fundamental and relates to the old issue of nature
vs nurture for galaxy formation The structures and morphologies of galaxies can help
address this problem especially by examining the limited number of observations we have
of galaxy structure in high redshift overdensities or proto-clusters
Observations of overdensities at high redshifts are just starting in earnest but already
provide some clues to this Very massive clusters at high redshifts up to z  12 contain a
similar pattern of morphologies and densities as local galaxies such that the denser areas
contain a higher fraction of systems which are elliptical This tends to break down for the
limited number of cluster candidates found at higher redshifts where the galaxy population
is irregular and peculiar as is found for the general high redshift galaxy population eg
Papovich et al 2012
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
Detailed studies are however possible up to z  1 both by using eld galaxies of various
local environments as well as looking at the morphological and structural distributions of
galaxies within rich clusters at various redshifts For eld galaxies Tasca et al 2009
examine the morphology-density relationship for 100000 galaxies in the COSMOS survey
They nd that the morphology-density relation changes slightly with redshift becoming
atter at higher-z eg Grutzbauch et al 2011ab Above a stellar mass of about 10106
M the morphologies of galaxies appear to become more dominated by the stellar mass as
the critical factor rather than density eg Grutzbauch et al 2011a The situation in rich
clusters at z  1 and the formation of S0s is such that the trend with environment is not
as steep as is found at z  0 This suggests that S0s are not entirely formed yet in these
distant clusters however the elliptical population does seem to be in place compared with
the population at z  0
Another structural feature that can be investigated is the size evolution and how it varies
with environment The limited number of investigations of this have found that galaxies at
z  1 in higher density environments show signs of a more rapid increase of galaxy size with
redshift in comparison to the eld eg Cooper et al 2012 Lani et al 2013 This is one
indication whereby a dense environment can facilitate a more rapid evolution in galaxies
although it is a slight eect that needs further conrmation
5 Comparisons to Theory
Galaxy morphology and structure allows a new way to compare with cosmologically based
galaxy formation models as well as those which include extensive physics such as star
formation AGN feedback and supernova in more detailed hydrodynamical models This
review only briey discusses this large topic and how it relates to galaxy structure For a
more detailed recent review on the theory of galaxy formation from a theoretical prospective
see Silk  Mamon 2012
Galaxy formation models were rst developed to explain the structures of galaxies namely
the bulgediskhalo trichotomy and the ages of the stars in these components Eggen et al
1962 The default initial assumption in the rst galaxy formation models was that galaxies
formed like stars in a relatively rapid collapse In the 1980s the rst computer simulations
of structure formation showed that a universe dominated by Cold Dark Matter CDM
matched observations of galaxy clustering on large scales Davis et al 1985 and that
within this framework galaxy assembly should be hierarchical Blumenthal et al 1984
yet this is a fundamental prediction which is just now starting to be tested with only a few
papers comparing the observations to the theoretical predictions eg Bertone  Conselice
2009 Jogee et al 2009 Hopkins et al 2010 Lotz et al 2011
The situation today is that there are many simulations that are used to predict proper-
ties of the galaxy population and how it evolves through time These models are largely
successful when predicting basic properties of nearby galaxies such as their luminosities
masses colors and star formation rates as well as scaling relationships of galaxies How-
ever problems still exist in predicting the abundances of low and high mass galaxies eg
Conselice et al 2007 Guo et al 2011 Within galaxy formation models there are very
famous problems such as the satellite and the CDM dark matter prole but there are also
signicant issues when examining how the evolution of galaxies occurs and trying to match
this with the theory Another major problem is that there are several large disk galax-
ies without signicant bulges in the nearby universe that are not predicted in CDM eg
Kormendy et al 2010
40 Christopher J Conselice
One of the ways to further test these models is to investigate how well CDM models can
reproduce the formation history of galaxies as seen through the merging process using the
so-called semi-analytical method eg Bower et al 2006 Guo et al 2011 We show this
comparison with the measured merger fractions in Figure 12 at two dierent stellar mass
ranges of M  1010 M and M  1011 M  Plotted as the thin solid black line towards
the lower part of each diagram is the prediction for the major merger fraction for galaxies
from the Millennium simulation Bertone  Conselice 2009 Also shown on these gures
as the dotted blue line is the same predictions for major mergers for Warm Dark Matter
models eg Menci et al 2012 which do a better job than CDM in matching the observed
data However CDM better matches if minor mergers are taken into account although
the comparison merger fraction is only for major mergers based on the methodology used
Conselice 2003a Lotz et al 2010a
Other recent attempts to predict the merger history of observed galaxies include the
abundance matching technique eg Stewart et al 2008 where observed galaxies are
matched to halos in models through their comparative abundance levels Hopkins et al
2010 predict based on this abundance matching the merger rate and fraction for galaxies
The result of this is show in Figure 12 for galaxies between M  101011 M  While the
merger fractions from Hopkins et al 2010 are higher than those from the CDM models
they are still lower than the observations see also Jogee et al 2009 and Lotz et al 2011 for
further discussions Similar results from Stewart et al 2008 are also shown in Figure 12
who nd results similar to Hopkins et al 2010
Finally as a contract to these Maller et al 2006 present cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation results for similar mass galaxies of a few times 1010 M  and nd the highest
merger fraction predictions of any simulation result Figure 12 This shows that the pre-
dictions for merger histories are not correct or consistent with each other and that more
simulation work should be focused on this critical aspect of the galaxy population This is
an area where future work is certainly needed
There are several other types of simulations in which galaxy structure and morphology
can be directly compared with observations of galaxies through cosmic time Perhaps the
most direct of these is to compare the properties and structural features of distant galaxies
to hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation Some of this work for galaxy mergers is
discussed in 34 Early work in this area showed that the components of galaxies - namely
bulges and disks were the result of accretion events eg Steinmetz  Navarro 2002 and
argued from their simulations that the Hubble type of a galaxy is not stable for long periods
of cosmic time Governato et al 2007 show that disk galaxies can be simulated which
have properties that match the morphological properties and kinematics of nearby disks
although this simulation is not in a cosmological context Overall however it is very dicult
to predict the formation of galaxy morphology in simulations and in a real sense this will
be the ultimate test of galaxy formation models in the future
Also as discussed in 46 one of the most commonly seen properties in high redshift star
forming galaxies is that they often contain large clumps of star formation within their disks
A major question is how these clumps form evolve and how they may play a role in the
formation of other galaxy components such as bulges and AGN Bournaud et al 2013
examined this problem computationally to determine how clumps with stellar masses of
M  1089 M evolve in gaseous disks The major question is whether these clumps
dissipate within 50 Myr or so the dynamical time-scale of the clumps or if they regenerate
and survive Bournaud et al 2013 nd that these clumps can last around 300 Myr through
acquiring new gas from its disk although some mass is lost through tidal eects This is
The Structural Evolution of Galaxies
enough time to migrate towards the center of the galaxy which can fuel the AGN or merge
to form a bulge This shows that these clumps may provide a signicant route for galaxies
to form Thus we have evidence for both inside-out and outside-in formation occurring
in the galaxy population What remains to be seen is whether one of these mechanisms is
dominant and the relative role of both in forming galaxies
6 Summary and the Future
I present here a review of galaxy structure and morphology studies in the galaxy population
through cosmic time from z  8 until today The approach taken in this review is largely
observational with a limited amount of interpretation although I do show where galaxy
structure and morphology can test galaxy formation and even cosmological models in a
new largely unexplored way
As of January 2014 the major conclusions concerning galaxy structure and its evolution
as discussed in this article can be summarized as
I Galaxy structure and morphology is the longest studied observational feature of galaxies
In this review galaxy morphology is the apparent classication based on visual inspection
while structure is a way to quantify the light distributions in galaxies
In many ways
morphology is still a descriptive science and visual eorts continue to provide useful infor-
mation in the form of large-scale projects to classify many galaxies as in the Galaxy Zoo
eort The Hubble sequence has and likely will remain the major paradigm in which we
consider galaxy morphology although this system does not work at high redshifts where
most galaxies cannot be classied into a single Hubble type 41
II Using the Hubble scheme the evolution of three broad classes of galaxies are now classied
accurately out to z  3  namely ellipticals spirals and peculiars The relative abundance
of these galaxies has been measured as a function of redshift out to these early times What
we nd is that the peculiar galaxies dominate the galaxy population at z  25  3 with a
relative fraction of at least 70 Galaxies which are elliptical and spiral like in appearance
but not necessarily in physical properties see 41 become progressively more common at
lower redshifts The number densities of these two normal galaxies together equals that of
the peculiars by z  14 Mortlock et al 2013
III Since galaxy morphology by visual estimates is limited in its ability to derive the physics
behind galaxy formation and by its nature is not quantitative the use of parametric 22
and non-parametric 23 methods are essential for deriving in a quantitative way how
galaxies are evolving These quantitative indices also correlate to some degree with the
present and past star formation history and properties of a galaxy More work is needed
to establish these relations with more certainty but it appears that the Sersic index and
concentration correlate with the scale or mass of a galaxy the clumpiness index with the
star formation and the asymmetry parameter with ongoing merging activity 3
IV The merger history is now know from applying structural analyses to galaxy images in
deep Hubble Space Telescope surveys such as the Hubble Deep Field 4 The result of this
is that the galaxy merger fraction increases with redshift at all stellar mass and luminosity
selections This increase can be t well by a power-law 1  zm up to z  3 although at
higher redshifts the structurally derived merger fraction may plateau Conselice  Arnold
2009 Using numericalhydrodynamical simulations the time-scales for these mergers can
be calculated and thus merger fractions can be converted into merger rates 432 The
42 Christopher J Conselice
merger rate allows for the calculation of the number of mergers galaxies at various masses
undergo as well as the amount of stellar mass which is added to galaxies due to the merger
process The result of this is that it appears that up to half of the stellar mass in modern
massive galaxies were formed in mergers between 1  z  3 although at z  1 dry mergers
are likely more responsible for the further formation of these galaxies
V The resolved structures of galaxies also allows us to measure the internal features of
galaxies and how they are assembling There is some controversy over the formation his-
tory bulges disks and bars although many of these are likely formed by secular processes
produced internally by disk dynamical evolution This is an area where signicant progress
could be made in the next few years The most up to date results suggest that the bar
fraction for spiral galaxies at z  1 depends upon the stellar mass of the galaxy The most
massive galaxies have a similar bar fraction at z  08 as they do today yet lower mass and
bluer disk galaxies have a signicantly lower bar fraction than similarly low mass nearby
disks This mirrors the evolution of the Hubble sequence itself where more massive galaxies
settle into normal ellipticals and disks before lower mass galaxies Spiral structure is a
dicult problem and while some examples exist at high redshift even at z  2 the general
onset of when disks form spirals is almost totally unconstrained by observations
VI Resolved imaging also permits us to measure the spectral energy distributions and
colors of galaxy components and individual pixels of dierent galaxies This is another
area where more work needs to be performed but it appears that bulges of spirals tend to
be older than their disks at high redshift but there are examples of many ellipticals which
have blue cores and central star formation 411 Pixel-pixel analyses show that galaxies
have a mixed star formation history and that the inner parts of galaxies are often older
than their outer parts Pixel studies also show that the clumps seen in distant star forming
galaxies are composed of young stellar populations and thus must have recently formed or
regenerate themselves
VII Perhaps the most popular at present problem in galaxy structural evolution is the
apparent compactness in size of galaxies at high redshifts The observations show that
massive galaxies at z  1 have sizes which are a factor of 2-5 smaller than similar massive
galaxies in todays universe This result has been studied in many dierent ways and the
sizes of a stellar mass selected sample of galaxies increases gradually as a function of redshift
with a power-law increase  1  z where  varies from 08 to 15 depending upon
whether the selected samples are disk-like or elliptical-like 42 Results to date suggest
that these galaxies are building up their outer parts over time to become larger systems
rather than adding mass to their centers This process is unlikely driven by star formation
and theory suggests that this formation is produced by minor merger events 42
In summary we have learned much about galaxy morphology and structure over the past
15 years There are however many open questions still remaining on all aspects of using
structure to determine evolution More work needs to be done in tying galaxy structure to
underlying physics both through empirical work and in simulations Furthermore the time-
scales for structural features such as mergers and large clump survival are critical to better
understand Broad morphological features will remain important over the next decades as
telescopes such as JWST Euclid LSST the Dark Energy Survey amongst others will all
resolve many more galaxies than we can currently study and at higher redshifts This opens
up entirely new possibilities and the with careful thoughtful planning a new revolution in
galaxy structure may be upon us soon
