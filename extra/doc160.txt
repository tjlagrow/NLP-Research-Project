Abstract Gas accretion is necessary to maintain star formation spiral and bar struc-
ture and secular evolution in galaxies This can occur through tidal interaction or mass
accretion from cosmic laments Dierent processes will be reviewed to drive gas to-
wards galaxy centers and trigger starbursts and AGN The eciency of these dynamical
processes can be estimated through simulations and checked by observations at dierent
redshift across the Hubble time Large progress has been made on galaxies at moderate
and high redshifts allowing to interpret the star formation history and star formation
eciency as a function of gas content dynamical state and galaxy evolution
Introduction
In the last decade cosmological simulations have emphasized the importance of cold
gas accretion onto galaxies in the mass assembly in particular at high redshift eg
Keres et al 2005 Dekel et al 2009 Devriendt et al 2010 This mode of accretion
is thought to be about one order of magnitude more important than galaxy mergers in
mass assembly unlike what was assumed in the hierarchical scenario
In parallel simulations of isolated galaxies show how important is the gas accre-
tion to maintain star formation at a constant level as is observed in spiral galaxies to
explain abundance gradients and also to maintain the spiral structure In the following
the impact of gas accretion is rst described and then we will review the evidence of
circumgalactic gas inow
2 Role of gas accretion secular evolution bars
Secular evolution involves mainly the disk galaxies of the Hubble sequence all spirals
and irregulars As for the ellipticals their formation scenario is still heavily relying
on mergers either a few major mergers or more likely a series of minor mergers to
heat the stellar component destroy disks progressively and cancel out any angular
momentum explaining its low values in this class
In disk galaxies the main motor of evolution is non-axisymmetries and bars
When the disk is abundant in gas as are most high redshift disky objects then the
bars are not long-lived but weakened and destroyed by the accumulation of mass in the
centers and by the exchange of angular momentum between the gas and the stars of
the bar Friedli  Benz 1993 Berentzen et al 1998 Bournaud  Combes 2002 A
weakened bar would transiently look like a lens inside its inner ring eg Laurikainen
et al 2009
FCombes
The frequency of bars in disk galaxies as a function of mass shows an interest-
ing bimodality Nair  Abraham 2010 with two maxima in the blue cloud and in the
red sequence This was also found by Masters et al 2011 with the Galaxy Zoo al-
though not by the S4G consortium see K Sheth this meeting but this could be due
to selection eects
Bars can act in conjunction with spirals to redistribute the angular-momentum
across galaxies and to modify signicantly stellar radial proles The non-linear inter-
actions at resonances overlap multiply the eects Minchev et al 2011 In less then 3
Gyrs the eective sizes of galaxy disks may be multiplied by 3 and the corresponding
radial migration brings high-velocity dispersion stars in the outer parts Disk thickening
is also substantial Minchev et al 2012 When gas accretion is considered the strength
of bars can be re-boosted and new stars formed out of the accreted gas continuously
re-shape the radial stellar proles It is then possible to obtain the three observed types
Type I as a single exponential disk Type II as a truncated one when star formation is
newly forming at the break and beyond the break the star formation threshold is not
yet reached and Type III the anti-truncated prole can be obtained in case of strong
gas accretion in the outer parts cf Fig 1 The Type III morphology appears relatively
transient and able to evolve into Type II or Type I Its presence could be a tracer of
accretion events There is some correlation of these Type II with weakened bars as
expected from strong gas accretion Bournaud  Combes 2002 Combes 2011
When the gas accretion occurs essentially from non-aligned cosmic laments
characteristic signatures may occur such as inclined and warped rings Roskar et al
2010 or even polar rings when the accretion is near polar Brook et al 2008 have
shown how a lenticular system is rst formed from matter accretion which suddenly
stops when the birth lament is consumed out The next lament in the perpendicular
direction then fuels a relatively stable polar ring system Gas accretion may mimick
galaxy interactions since it can produce asymmetries lopsidedness clumpiness and
sfatbursts Even if the accretion is globally symmetric and isotropic it may be tem-
porarily on one side only
Gas accretion replenishes the extended gas reservoirs present around most spiral
galaxies This gas slowly spirals in when in quiescent state However the rst tidal in-
teraction may drive the gas violently towards the center and strongly aects abundance
gradients that can even be reversed Montuori et al 2010 low-metallicity gas ows
into the center and dilutes the abundance of the central gas in a time-scale shorter than
the time required for this gas to re-enrich through the triggered nuclear starburst Such
gradient reversals have been observed at high redshift in the MASSIV survey Queyrel
et al 2012
Inside-out disk formation inowoutow metallicity
Gas accretion occurs in the outer parts of disks and is a way to explain inside-out
disk formation There are now multiple evidence of this progressive mode of disk
formation Through observations of galaxies as a function of redshift it is possible to
track the evolution directly However nding the progenitors of today galaxies is not
easy Statistically this is solved by matching the galaxies at a given cumulative number
density for instance 14 104 Mpc3 Plotting the mass of these matched galaxies
at a given redshift Patel et al 2013 follow the mass increase of galaxies over z3
to 0 They notice that this mass increase involves only the mass of the outer parts

giant Sa left and giant Sb right The various colored lines correspond to dierent
epochs The rst row shows the evolution of stellar surface density and the two
others the radial and vertical velocity dispersions From Minchev et al 2012
while the mass inside 2kpc is stable in all the same galaxies This fact is related to the
observations that the normalised galaxy radius at a given mass increases by a factor 3
from z3 to 0 Newman et al 2012 It is possible that dry minor mergers explain this
increase of size without much mass accretion in the case of quenched galaxies For
star forming disk galaxies external gas accretion accompanied by secular evolution
is necessary In the GASS sample of local galaxies detected in HI-21cm Wang et al
2011 nd that galaxies richer in HI are bluer and the more so in the outer parts the
radial gradient of color is a function of HI-mass fraction They conclude that the gas
must be accreted slowly and relaxed since there is no correlation between HI-fraction
and lopsidedness in this sample
More directly looking at H in the 3D-HST project in 57 galaxies at z 1 Nelson
et al 2012 nd that the eective radii of galaxies in ionised gas and new stars is
about 13 larger than the eective radius of the rest-frame R-band stellar continuum
representing older stars The eet is larger for massive galaxies that certainly are the
rst to form inside-out
FCombes
In this inside-out scenario with gas accretion the radial migration will produce a
typical reversal of stellar ages in the outer parts the gas is accreted at the radius of the
break which is where the new stars are formed accentuating the negative age gradient
from the center After the break only old stars migrated from the center are expected
and there is now a positive gradient Roskar et al 2008 This age gradient reversal has
been observed in M33 by Williams et al 2009 Some other galaxies do not show any
break but a at age gradient in the outer parts Vlajic et al 2011
4 Evidence of gas accretion HVC warps QSO absorption
Most of the gas from cosmic laments is accreted at large scales settles down to the
disk and spirals in progressively Since the alignment process occurs through preces-
sion and dissipation with a time-scale of the order of a few dynamical times at these
large radii this can take some Gyrs during which galaxies appear warped or perturbed
in the outer parts Warps and polar rings are therefore the best tracers of external ac-
cretion and indeed most spiral galaxies are observed to be warped eg Briggs 1990
Binney 1992 Reshetnikov  Combes 1998 Also the frequency of asymmetries and
lopsidedness in spiral galaxies cannot be explained but with external accretion Jog 
Combes 2009
Searches have been done of extra-planar gas in the halo of spiral galaxies Fra-
ternali et al 2002 Heald et al 2011 Gentile et al 2013 and the quantities found are
relatively small NGC 891 being the most remarkable for its gas entension The ori-
gin of this gas is multiple Some gas can be ejected into the halo by stellar feedback
fountain eect or through tidal disruption of satellites In the Milky Way the High
Velocity Clouds HVC and the Magellanic stream are good examples This gas is ac-
creted progressively with an interface of multiphase gas but at a rate lower than the
star formation rate 04 Myr in the Galaxy Putman et al 2012
The way external hot gas is accreted might be complex Fraternali  Binney
2008 The fountain eect ejects ionised gas into the halo where it encounters the
hot coronal gas Merging with this assumed non-rotating gas it looses angular mo-
mentum and cold gas condensates in the shock Finally more gas is infalling down
that was uplifted by star formation feedback The metallicity of the infalling gas is
relatively high since it is a mixture of gas from very dierent origins The same kind
of processes is invoked in cool core clusters as schematically shown in Figure 2 The
hot X-ray gas in the cluster halo is dense enough at the center to cool down and fuel a
central AGN But the radio jets of the AGN re-heat the medium in creating two cav-
ities of plasma pushing the X-ray gas out at the cavity boundaries There the gas is
cooling down to low temperatures and molecular clouds are observed through their
CO emission Salome et al 2006 2008 In parallel the AGN jets drag some molecular
gas previously settled in the central galaxy and this uplifts some high-metallicity gas
at 20-30kpc which explains the more ecient cooling in laments far from the center
and the gas abundance sucient to produce CO emission
High velocity clouds have been found around M31 and M33 in the local group
and also along a gas bridge between M31 and M33 Lockman et al 2012 About 121
HVC have been detected around the isolated galaxy NGC 6946 Boomsma et al 2008
In nearly face-on galaxies these HVC re traced by the numerous HI holes they created
in the disk plane as demonstrated in M101 Kamphuis et al 1991 Some of these
highly perturbed galaxies are aslo lopsided like UGC7989 Noordermeer et al 2005
Gasaccretionindiskgalaxies
Figure 2
Left Schematical view of the fountain gas in the hot corona of the
Milky Way from Fraternali et al 2013 Ionised gas is elevated to the hot halo
compresses and provokes the cooling of the hot gas which comes back to the plane
as high or intermediate velocity clouds This is a way to accrete external gas since
more gas cools down than was elevated by the star formation feedback Right An
analogous feedback mechanism occurs in cool core clusters Here we see in the
Perseus cluster the two radio jets lling two cavities in the hot X-ray gas white
contours and bubbles where the heated X-ray gas does not cool At the boundary
of the cavities gas can cool enhancement of X-ray emission and even very cold
gas forms and is visible in CO emission dark contours and arcs In this scenario
gas is not cooling towards the center as previously expected but at  20kpc form
the center of the cluster
More generally 30 of galaxies show an asymmetry larger than 10 as quantied by
the Fourier decomposition of the density In poor environments low surface brightness
LSB galaxies are dwarfs particularly rich in HI gas and revealing spectacular warps
like NGC 2915 Meurer et al 1006 NGC 5055 Battaglia et al 2006 or NGC 3741
Begum et al 2005 Gentile et al 2007
Another important way to discover the circum-galactic gas around galaxies is
through absorption measurements in front of remote quasars The various systems
can be sorted by their column density from the Ly forest at very low columns to
the damped Ly DLA at NHI  1020 cm2 passing through the Lyman limit systems
LLS The abundance of the systems varies as a power law Prochaska et al 2010
Fumagalli et al 2011 have derived from cosmological simulations the probability
to observe absorptions in front of backgound sources at z23 and according to the
distance from the center of the galaxy up to the virial radius The result is that there
are only 10 of line of sights optically thick in HI and 1 probability to nd a DLA
About 30 of absorbers come from massive galaxies and their streams There has been
some debate about the lling factor of gaseous laments around galaxies While Dekel
et al 2009 claim a lling factor for cold laments of 25 between 20 and 100kpc
around a halo of total mass 1012 M at z25 in the same conditions Faucher-Giguere
 Keres 2011 or Kimm et al 2011 nd 2 or 5  respectively So the observation
of cold gas accretion is dicult for the small lling fators but also due to the confusion
with the galaxy host when the line-of-sights are too close or the low metallicity of the
circum-galactic gas if carbon lines are used
FCombes
Another possibility would be to detect Ly photons emitted when the gas is in-
falling in dark matter haloes in some way when it re-radiates its gravitational energy It
has been proposed that the frequently observed Ly blobs at high redshift are precisely
due to this radiation But the simulations from Faucher-Giguere et al 2010 taking
into account the proper self-shileding etc have shown that the gravitational emission
in these blobs is negligible Ly blobs are powered by star formation or AGN Now
several hundreds of Ly blobs have been discoverd Matsuda et al 2006 2011 The
Ly line is resonant and requires radiative transfer to better understand the shapes of
the proles observed Verhamme et al 2006 have showned that in case of outowing
material a P-cygni prole is expected with emission on the red side and absorption
on the blue side The reverse is expected for inowing gas However in all Ly blobs
observed until now there are always P-cygni proles with emission in the red therefore
only outows have been detected
Another way to detect the laments could then be through uorescence of Ly
photons emitted by a starburst or a luminous quasar This has been done in a few
cases Rauch et al 2011 Cantalupo et al 2012 but this clever technique should be
developed more A powerful quasar can illuminate dark gas or dark galaxies up to
100kpc distance
Finally when absorption lines are detected in front of quasars what are the meth-
ods to distringuish inows from outows in the circumgalactic medium CGM Two
methods have been used and are illustrated in Figure 3
Using an H I-selected sample of 28 Lyman limit systems LLS at z1 observed
in absorption with the HST-COS spectrograph Lehner et al 2013 are able to deter-
mine their metallicity from weakly ionized metal species eg O II Si II Mg II and
nd that the metallicity distribution of the LLS is bimodal with metal-poor and metal-
rich branches peaking at about 25 and 50 solar metallicities Both branches have
comparable number of absorbers The metal-rich branch likely traces winds recycled
outows and tidally stripped gas while the metal-poor branch has properties consistent
with cold accretion streams
When the galaxy host is detected in the proximity of the absorbant lines of sight
it is possible to determine the azimuthal orientation of the gas Is it towards the minor
axis more likely to be an outow or the major axis then it is probably an inow
Bouche et al 2012 2013 have shown that the number of absorbants as the function
of angle with respect to the major-axis reveals a bimodal distribution also These are
MgII absorbants at z 01 Fig 3 The outow speeds are found to be 150-300 kms
ie of the order of the circular velocity and smaller than the escape velocity by a factor
of 2 The outow rates are typically two to three times the instantaneous SFRs
5 Evolution with redshift of gas content
It is now well established that the global SFR in the Universe evolves towards a max-
imum at about z1-2 and then decreases by a factor 10 to the present eg Bouwens
et al 2012 When the SFR is normalized to the stellar mass the specic SFR called
sSFR is derived which is the inverse of the growth time-scale for the galaxy This typ-
ical time-scale has been establied to be 2 Gyr at z0 and then regularly decreases with
increasing z There was a recent debate about a possible plateau of the sSFR after z2
but this has been corrected Smit et al 2013 The rst galaxies are so active in form-
ing stars that their nebular emission dominates their total emission Without precise

LLS at z1 The hashed histograms correspond to upper limits The peak of the
tw maxima are marked by vertical dotted lines The low metallicity LLS could cor-
respond to inows while the high metallicity ones to outows From Lehner et al
2013 Right Bimodal distribution of the MgII absorbers at z01 according to the
angle from the major axis of the hosts According to the small drawing it is expected
that outows occur on the minor-axis and inow on the major-axis From Bouche
et al 2012
spectroscopy it was not possible to disentangle the continuum from the lines and the
continuum was over-estimated With the recent re-normalisation the sSFR increases at
all redshift which corresponds better to the simulations predictions
Why galaxies in the main sequence of star formation are more ecient to form
stars at high redshift According to our PHIBSS survey detecting about 52 galaxies at
z12 and 23 with the IRAM interferometer we determine that the gas fraction over
all baryons in these galaxies increase with redshift up to 50 at least The gas fraction
is 34 at z12 and 44 at z23 while it is only of the order of 5 at z0 Tacconi
et al 2010 2013
The evolution of the specic SFR is shown in Figure 4 where we have assumed
that the depletion time-scale for star formation in the main sequence can be modelled as
tdep  15 1z-105 Gyr We have shown that the gas fraction was strongly correlated
to the sSFR and explored the whole range from 10 to 90 In the Kennicutt-Schmidt
diagram the surface density of gas and the SFR surface density follows the main se-
quence branch With respect to the gas surface density divided by the dynamical time
all objects main sequence and starbursts align on the same almost linear curve This
is due to the smaller dynamical time-scale of nuclear starbursts
When only ULIRGS and starbursts are considered the strong increase of star for-
mation eciency rate is explained at high redshift by two factors with comparable
weight rst the gas fraction is higher by a factor 3 at z1 with respect to z0 and the
star formation eciency SFR per unit gas mass is also higher by a factor 3 Combes
et al 2013
6 Conclusion
External gas supply is fundamental for secular evolution bars drive gas towards the
very center and accretion is necessary to replenish the disk to reform a bar or for the
galaxy to stay on the blue cloud instead of directly move on the red sequence

The gas accretion is slow progressive from gas reservoirs in the outer parts of
galaxies Matter and angular momentum is redistributed by non-axisymmetries and
bars including radial migration These processes explain the inside-out disk formation
that is now currently observed at all redshifts The evolution of the disk sizes at a
given mass can also be explained by slow matter accretion and dry minor mergers In
particular secular evolution can multiply the eective radii by up to a factor 3
Gas accretion was more intense in the past It could be the explanation together
with galaxy interactions and y-bys to abundance gradients reversal in galaxy disks
Tidal forces drive the gas reservoir into the center and this nearly primordial gas dilutes
the metallicity of the central gas on a time-scale shorter than the enrichment time-scale
due to the triggered starburst
Warps and polar rings might be the best evidence of gas accretion since their
setlling takes a few Gyr and they reect non-aligned accretion of matter Other evi-
dence of accretion can be seen in high velocity clouds high-column density absorbants
in front of quasars There is a bimodality between the gas inowing and outowing
with almost equal weights through the metallicity and the angle of accretion
Gasaccretionindiskgalaxies
There is a strong redshift evolution of gas fraction in galaxies which can explain
the SFR history peaking at z1-2 The disk dynamics at high z is dierent from what is
observed locally since the high gas fraction makes disks highly unstable and turbulent
