RESUMEN
ABSTRACT
We present a phenomenological approach to the study of disk galaxy evolution based on i a detailed modelling
of the Milky Way used as a prototype disk galaxy and ii an extension of the model to other disks through
some simple scaling relations obtained in the framework of Cold Dark matter models The main conclusion is
that on average massive disks have formed the bulk of their stars earlier than their lower mass counterparts It
is not yet clear why the star formation hierarchy has been apparently opposite to the dark matter assembly
hierarchy

1 INTRODUCTION
Accordingly to the currently popular scenario
for galaxy formation pioneered by White and Rees
1978 the dark haloes of galaxies form hierarchically
by the gravitational clustering of non-dissipative
dark matter while the luminous parts form through
a combination of gravitational clustering and dissi-
pative collapse which may be aected by feedback
The major uncertainty in this scenario concerns the
baryonic component since the physics of star for-
mation and feedback are very poorly understood at
present thus requiring a parametric approach to the
problem Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation
help to explore large regions of the relevant param-
eter space and have produced quite encouraging re-
sults eg Cole et al 2000 still they have not yet
managed to reproduce succesfully some key observed
properties of disks van den Bosch 2002 or ellipticals
Thomas et al 2002
Simple ie not dynamical models of chem-
ical andor photometric galaxy evolution use
general fewer free parameters than semi-analytical
models If the number of observables that are suc-
cessfully reproduced is much larger than the num-
ber of free parameters it is reasonable to assume
that the galaxian histories produced by such mod-
els may indeed match the real ones In that spirit
we have developed a simple approach to disk galaxy
evolution based on i a detailed model of the Milky
Way used as a prototype Sec 2 and ii an exten-
sion to other disks trough some simple scaling rela-

massive disks have formed the bulk of their stars ear-
lier than low mass ones Whether this star forma-
tion hierarcy is compatible with the dark matter
assembly hierarchy remains to be demonstrated
2 A SIMPLE MODEL FOR THE MILKY WAY
Several simple models have been developed in the
past few years on the chemical evolution of the Milky
Way disk eg Prantzos and Aubert 1995 Chiap-
pini et al 1997 Boissier and Prantzos 1999 Chang
et al 1999 Portinari and Chiosi 2000 Although
they may dier considerably in their ingredients ra-
dial dependence of Star formation rate andor infall
rate inclusion or not of radial inows etc these
models converge in the following points see eg dis-
cussion in Tosi 2000 i infall of primordial or low
metallicity gas on a long timescale 7 Gyr is re-
quired locally in order to reproduce the observed
G-dwarf metallicity distribution in the solar neigh-
borhood ii strong radial dependence of the Star for-
mation rate andor the infall rate is needed in order
to reproduce the observed radial proles of gas SFR
and metal abundances Note
in recent cosmologi-
cal hydro-simulations of galaxy formation Sommer-
Larsen et al 2002 nd that gas accretion in regions
8 kpc distant from the centers of Milky Way type
spirals takes place on timescales of 6 Gyr in rea-
sonable agreement with the requirements of simple
models
Fig 1 displays the results of a simple model
from Boissier and Prantzos 1999 which also repro-

of the Milky Way disk according to the model of Boissier
and Prantzos 1999 In all panels the solid curves cor-
respond to model results at galactic ages of 1 4 and
13 Gyr respectively the latter heavy curves are com-
pared to observations of the present day disk in the left
panels shaded regions for the gaseous and stellar pro-
les and data points for the Star Formation Rate The
model leads naturally to dierent scalelengths for the B-
band 4 kpc and the K-band 26 kpc in agreement
with observations
duces all the main observables in the solar neighbor-
hood The adopted SFR as a function of radius R is
of the form
R  A V R R1 15
where V R is the rotational velocity at R and G
the gas surface density this SFR is based on the
assumption that large scale star formation in spirals
is induced by the passage of the spiral waves Wyse
and Silk 1989
The model reproduces satisfactorily the observed
chemical and photometric radial proles of the MW
disk Fig 1 as well as those of oxygen and other
metal abundances Hou et al 2000 in particular
the model predicts a atenning of the abundance gra-
dients with time due to the assumed inside-out for-
mation of the disk in agreement with the recent
observational results of Maciel and Da Costa2002
based on O abundances of planetary nebulae of vari-
ous age classes Note taking into account the uncer-
tainties in evaluating ages of planetary nebulae the
importance of that agreement should not be overes-
timated it is however encouraging
Fig 2 displays the evolution of several observ-
ables of a Milky Way disk as a function of redshift in
Fig 2 Results of the Milky Way disk model of Boissier
and Prantzos 1999 plotted as a function of the red-
shift for a Universe with M 030 070 and H065
kmsMpc The model suggests that such disks are
fainter in the K-band in the past but slightly brighter in
the B-band at intermediate redshifts they are also more
compact in the past especially in the B-band
a standard cosmology according to the model It
appears that such disks evolved with quasi-constant
amount of gas and were in the past substantially
more compact in the B-band they also were slightly
brighter in the B-band at least at redshifts z  1-2
and always fainter in the K-band
Although the model reproduces successfully the
present day proles of the Milky Way disk its pre-
dictions for the past history of such disks cannnot
be considered very robust since a degenerate solu-
tion several dierent histories leading to the same
nal state cannot be excluded Still it is tempt-
ing to explore the consequences of that model after
extending it to other disk galaxies
3 SCALING RELATIONS FOR GALACTIC
Assuming that the MW is a typical spiral one
may try to extend the model to the case of other
disk galaxies by means of simple scaling relations in
an analoguous way the Sun is a typical star used to
calibrate models of stellar evolution The scal-
ing relations derived by Mo et al
1998 in the
framework of Cold Dark Matter models of galaxy
formation can be used Boissier and Prantzos 2000
BP2000 to describe disks as two-parameter family
scale length Rd and central surface brightness 0
in terms of the corresponding MW parameters rep-
resented by subscript G below

The two fundamental parameters entering these re-
lations are the circular velocity VC a measure of the
disks mass and the spin parameter  a measure
of the disks angular momentum distribution large
VC values correspond to massive disks and large 
values to extended ones The baryonic fraction md
of the disks is taken to be 005 in our calculations
Finally for the MW parameters we have RdG26
kpc 0G1150 Mpc2 VCG220 kms
Note that these scaling relations apply to gaseous
disks assumed to be formed at the redshift of the
corresponding dark halo formation this formalism is
adopted in semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution
where the baryon accretion history the infall his-
tory in our terminology is determined essentially
by the dark matter accretion history A Schmidt
type law for star formation with an eciency pro-
portional to local dynamical timescale is usually as-
sumed in such models along with some prescription
for feedback a term describing the way gas is af-
fected by the energy input from stars the interplay
between the three eects accretion star formation
feedback determines the eective star formation ef-
ciency in semi-analytic models
A dierent approach is adopted in BP2000 the
star formation law and eciency A Eq 1 are kept
the same as in the MW model with rotational ve-
locity curves properly calculated while the infall
rate is adjusted in order to reproduce main proper-
ties of present-day spirals This approach ie us-
ing present-day properties of galaxies to infer their
histories has been characterised as backwards ap-
proach to galaxy evolution eg Fereras and Silk
2001 our use of scaling relations borrowed from
Cold Dark Matter forwards models qualies our
approach rather as a hybrid one In fact the scal-
ing relations allow to tie the geometric properties of
disks to those of the Milky Way and nothing more
the overall disk evolution is really determined by the
assumed infall or mass accretion history
4 RESULTS
Our hybrid approach allows to reproduce suc-
cessfully a large number of observables of galaxies in
the local Universe BP2000 including disk sizes
and central surface brightness Tully-Fisher rela-
tions in various wavelength bands colour-colour and
Fig 3 From top to bottom Colour metallicity at 3 kpc
from the center gas fraction and star formation eciency
dened as star formation rate divided by the total gas
amount as a function of rotational velocity for galac-
tic disks
In general more massive rapidly rotating
disks are redder more metal-rich and gas poor than less
massive ones however the star formation eciency does
not seem to depend on the disks mass Put together
these observational data suggest that the more massive
disks are chemically and photometrically older than less
massive ones The curves corrspond to model results of
Boissier et al 2001 for three values of the spin param-
eter  13 1 and 3 times the one of the Milky Way the
latter corresponds to the solid curves in all panels
colour-magnitude relations gas fractions vs magni-
tude abundances as a function of local and inte-
grated properties etc it also reproduces naturally
detailed spectra from the Kennicut atlas of galaxies
for various galaxy types
We nd that the crucial ingredient of that success
is the assumption that gas is infalling more slowly in
galaxies with smaller masses andor surface densi-
ties These two parameters are the main drivers of
disk evolution We note that Bell and de Jong 2000
reach similar conclusions but they attribute a more
PRANTZOS
important role to local surface density while we nd
that galaxy mass plays an even more important role
on average massive disks are older than lower mass
ones Disks with VC 100 kms have formed the
rst half of their stars within 4-9 Gyr while disks
with VC 300 kms have done so within 2-6 Gyr
depending on spin parameter that is surface den-
sity see Boissier et al 2001
The main observational arguments on which our
conclusion is based are presented in Fig 3 One sees
that on average massive disks are redder poorer in
gas and richer in metals than less massive ones Each
one of these observables taken separately could be
easily explained eg
redder colours could be ex-
plained by larger amounts of dust as invoked eg in
Somerville and Primack 1999 or Avila-Reese and Fir-
mani 2000 When all three observables are consid-
ered together the idea of a star formation eciency
increasing with galaxy mass apears as a viable expla-
nation Such a possibility has been invoked in Fer-
reras and Silk 2001 but it requires huge amounts
of undetectable gas to be present in small galaxies
However when the fourth observable is taken into
account namely the absence of any dependence of
the present-day of star formation eciency on rota-
tional velocity or B-magnitude see Boissier et al
2001 the only viable explanation is the one invoked
above massive disks are older
5 CONCLUSION
In the currently popular paradigm of hierarchi-
cal galaxy formation low mass dark matter haloes
form rst while more massive ones are formed later
through accretion and merging in principle baryons
are supposed to follow the dark matter but their fate
is largely unknown at present due to a lack of a re-
liable theory of star formation and feedback
In recent cosmological hydro-simulations by
2001 it is found that star for-
Nagamine et al
mation in small galaxies has stopped many Gyr
ago in clear contradiction with observations of local
galaxies On the other hand van den Bosch 2002
nds that semi-analytical models even with feed-
back produce massive disks that are systematically
bluer than their lower mass counterparts again in
contradiction with observations the reason of the
failure is obviously related to the fact that the mass
accretion histories of baryons are largely dictated by
the hierarchical clustering of dark matter eg Avila-
Reese and Firmani 2000 Once gas becomes avail-
able it forms rapidly stars feedback can only delay
star formation for a short time shorter than the sev-
eral Gyr that are observationally required to obtain
small disks bluer than massive ones
Our simple hybrid model for disk evolution
calibrated on the MW suggests that on average mas-
sive disks have formed the bulk of their stars several
Gyr earlier than low mass ones Their predictions
match successfully most currently available observ-
ables including data from surveys at intermediate
redshifts Boissier and Prantzos 2001
At present and despite claims to the contrary
there is no satisfactory explanation at least not a
published one for the observables presented in Fig
3 in the framework of hierarchical galaxy formation
It remains to be shown why star formation in galax-
ies apparently followed an inverted hierarchy wrt
the dark matter asembly Feedback oers an obvi-
ous solution to that problem but the required delay
timescales appear unphysically large
