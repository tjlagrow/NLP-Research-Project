Abstract This is a brief introduction to the closing discussion of the IAU Symposium 295
The Intriguing Life of Massive Galaxies that was held in Beijing from August 27 through 31
2012 The discussion was focused on only four hot items namely 1 the redshift evolution of the
size of passively evolving galaxies 2 the evolution with redshift of the specic star formation
rate 3 quenching of star formation in galaxies and dry merging and 4 the IMF
Keywords Galaxy Evolution Elliptical Galaxies Star Formation IMF
1 Introduction
I have been asked by the organizers to introduce the nal discussion of this IAU
Symposium 295 The Intriguing Life of Massive Galaxies thus trying to provoke a wide
participation by the audience I have chosen to focus the discussion on just a few among
the many issues that have been addressed and debated at this exciting meeting For each
topic after ve minutes of introduction some ten or more minutes of general discussion
followed All this was recorded but at this point it is not clear whether it will become
accessible on line on the site of the symposium Therefore this short article is limited to
a report of my introduction to each topic in the wish of attracting readers towards the
actual event if the records will become available
I wish to start by confessing that already quite some time ago I lost faith in the ability
of theoretical models to tell us how real galaxies form and evolve being them of the
semianalytic or the hydro-simulation variety The reason is that once the mess of bary-
onic physics is added to the clean elegance of dark matter N-body realizations most if
not all predictive power is lost in a plethora of adjustable parameters meant to describe
the many physical processes at work Just to name a few star formation galactic winds
cold streams supermassive black hole formation nuclear activity and its feedback chem-
ical evolution galaxy mergers starbursts disk instabilities multiphase ISM supernova
feedback ram pressure stripping dust formation radiative transfer and many more For
example Benson  Bower 2010 list over two dozens adjustable parameter for their
semi-analytic model So being an indel my view of theory would be biased and I pre-
ferred to drive the discussion towards some specic points that direct observations may
help to clarify
2 The Size Evolution of Passively Evolving Galaxies
Over a dozen talks have been dealing with the size of passively evolving galaxies PEG
at the various redshifts Sizes are straightforward to visualize and eective radii Re are
relatively easy to measure thus over one hundred papers have been dedicated in recent
years to report on how high redshift PEGs are smaller and denser at given stellar mass
compared to their local analogs and what processes may account for their apparent
growth by up to a factor of  4 from z  25 to z  0 Indeed at xed stellar mass
the average Re of PEGs  Re  as normalized to the local Re  M relation steadily
declines with increasing redshift a trend that with few exceptions eg Valentinuzzi et
al 2010 Cassata et al 2011 Newman et al 2012 has been often entirely ascribed to
the physical growth of individual galaxies Accretion of an envelope of small satellites
minor mergers has been widely entertained as the leading mechanism to pu up the
individual high-z compact PEGs until they reach their due nal dimension Yet this is
only part of the story and likely only a minor one
The fact is that the comoving number density of massive PEGs is increasing by a large
factor  25 between z  25 and 0 with most of this increase taking place between
z  25 and  1 Hence the run of the average size of PEGs primarily reects the size
with which at each redshifts they rst appear as quenched rather than the subsequent
grow of each of them Thus the real challenge is to understand why galaxies which
are quenched at later times are born bigger than those formed earlier rather than or
not only to understand to which extent individual PEGs secularly increase their size
Precursors to PEGs must be star forming galaxies likely spending most of their time on
their main sequence growing inside-out Hence the later they are quenched the bigger
they are and presumably the bigger their passive remnant Is just this the main story
An intriguing aspect is that the number density of compact PEGs actually appears
to increase with cosmic time peaking at z  1 eg Cassata et al 2011 right when
 Re  is most rapidly increasing  and then starts to drop at lower redshifts Thus
between z  25 and  1 the distribution of eective radii of newly formed PEGs is
rapidly evolving and does so in such a way that the birth rate of normal size PEGs is
higher than a sill increasing birth rate of compact ones It is only below z  1 that the
number density of compact PEGs starts to drop and some growth of individual galaxies
must take place Thus understanding the redshift evolution of  Re  requires to follow
simultaneously the complex interplay between the growth of individual galaxies and the
birth of new PEGs and their size distribution A key issue that remains to be settled
concerns the number density of compact PEGs in the local Universe how does it compare
with the number density at redshift 1 or 2
3 The Specic Star Formation Rate
The specic star formation rate sSFR of main sequence galaxies as a function stellar
mass and cosmic time conveniently parameterized as sSFRM t  M 
 t plays a
pivotal role in galaxy evolution It controls the growth rate of galaxies the evolution of
their mass function and can have a direct eect even on quenching of star formation
itself Despite its importance the precise value of  is still uncertain with values in the
literature spanning a very wide range 040 the result depending on how star
forming galaxies are selected and how SFR and M are measured
There is clear evidence that the sSFR drops systematically with time since z  2 by
at least a factor of  20 hence   22 25 This drop with time increase with lookback
time and redshift runs almost parallel to the specic mass increase rate of merging dark
matter halos thus hinting for a direct link between star formation rate and accretion
rate of the haloes A simple interpretation of such quasi-parallelism is that the supply
of fresh baryons gas feeding star formation in galaxies follows the dark matter halo
accretion rate as if baryons and dark matter were fairly bound to each other However
beyond redshift  2 the sSFR appears to atten then remaining nearly constant ie
  0 all the way to very high redshifts eg Gonzalez et al 2010 On the contrary
the specic increase rate of dark matter haloes keeps increasing
IAUS295  The Intriguing Life of Massive Galaxies Introducing the Final Discussion3
This divergence from parallelism beyond z  2 has caused some concern on the the-
oretical side eg Weinmann Neinstein  Dekel 2011 as it would apparently demand
drastic modications to widely adopted assumptions as if baryons and dark matter were
substantially decoupled at early cosmic times Thus measuring the actual value of  for
redshifts beyond  25 has potentially strong implications for the relative behavior of
baryons and dark matter It may also be especially relevant for reionization but may be
relatively unimportant for the actual mass growth of galaxies which most takes place at
lower redshifts In phenomenological models of galaxy evolution eg Peng et al 2010
compared to a   0 case a   0 beyond z  25 would imply a dierent ratio of the
nal galaxy stellar mass to the mass of the initial seed having otherwise rather irrelevant
eect on the nal outcome But a precise measurement of the run of the sSFR with mass
and time ie of  and  remains a central issue for a proper understanding of galaxy
formation and evolution Contrary to previous results it has been reported at this meet-
ing that the sSFR may still be increasing somewhat even well beyond z  2 eg Stark
et al 2012 Thus the issue remains unsettled and worth attracting further studies
4 Quenching and Dry Merging
Quenching of star formation then turning to passive evolution is perhaps the most
salient event in the life of a galaxy Observations tell us that the fraction of quenched
galaxies is a strong function of both stellar mass and local overdensity Thus two distinct
physical processes must exists dubbed mass quenching and environment quenching that
act independent of each other Peng et al 2010 What remains to be established is the
physical nature of these two processes what is environment quenching and what is
mass quenching
Is environment quenching just ram pressure stripping or strangulation or a combi-
nation thereof Is mass quenching a process internal to galaxies themselves such as eg
Figure 1 A modication of the original cartoon with an idealized sketch of the transition from
star-forming blue cloud galaxies to quenched red sequence galaxies black and grey scale
Faber et al 2007 In color the actual path of galaxies being mass quenched is indicated in
blue together with a modest further mass increase by dry merging short red arrow
AGN feedback or is it an external process also related to the environment eg galax-
ies are quenched when the mass of the host dark matter halo exceeds a threshold value
Does mass quenching work by ejecting gas out of galaxies or by preventing accretion of
cold gas into galaxies In other words what is mass in mass quenching Is it M or Mh
Theoreticians appear to be equally divided and probably only observations can answer
the question
Yet quenching may not be the last event in the evolution of massive galaxies Post-
quenching dry merging can also take place and in a popular cartoon such further mass
increase may be as large as a factor  10 see Figure 1 This scenario was motivated by
the perception that star-forming SF galaxies as massive as the most massive quenched
galaxies would not exist hence massive PEGs M1011 M could not form by just
quenching star formation in a blue cloud galaxy then moved to the red sequence ie
there would be not enough massive blue galaxies in the distant Universe with masses
comparable to those of the brightest red galaxies Actually massive enough SF galaxies
do exist but they are very rare The reason why they are rare is precisely because they
are growing in mass so rapidly that their life expectancy as star forming is very short
they soon are going to be mass quenched Thus the cartoon is missing the main point
most of the action ie most of the mass quenching takes place near the top end of the
mass function of SF galaxies for M1011 M within the open ellipse in Figure 1 a
region left empty in the original plot
Now dry merging does certainly exist but its role is not as prominent as sometimes
envisaged In high density regions the Schechter M 
 of quenched galaxies is just  01
dex higher than in low density regions where merging is almost absent Peng et al
2010 Thus dry mergers make just an average  20 mass increase certainly not a
factor  10

elliptical galaxies color coded blue to red with increasing velocity dispersion from van Dokkum
 Conroy 2012 Two synthetic stellar population spectra are also shown for an age of 13 Gyr
and Milky Way bottom light IMF s  135 and a bottom heavy IMF s  4 equivalent to a
logarithmic slope x  3 as s  x  1

5 The IMF
Finally the IMF usually described by a power law dN  M sdM  It is currently
common practice to adopt a universal IMF for a broad range of astrophysical applications
such as eg to estimate stellar masses and star formation rates of galaxies from the local
to the most distant Universe so far explored Yet it is perfectly legitimate to entertain
the notion that the IMF may not be universal Indeed from time to time one appeals
to dierent IMFs to ease perceived discrepancies between some theoretical models and
observations eg Dave 2008 or between the dynamical and stelllar population mass to
light ratios of galaxies eg Cappellari et al 2012 Thus sometimes one appeals to a top
heavy IMF with a lot of massive stars boosting the luminosity and metal production rate
sometime to a bottom heavy IMF with a lot of low mass stars making just mass but little
light and no metals In particular in a recent surge of papers observational evidence has
been presented that would favor a very bottom heavy IMF in massive elliptical galaxies
This was based on the strength of the Na I 8190 A doublet and the FeH Wing-Ford
band at 9900 A which both are strong in dwarfs and weak in giants van Dokkum 
Conroy 2012 Ferreras et al 2012 and references therein These features appear to be
stronger in such galaxies than in synthetic stellar population models which adopt a Milky
Way bottom light IMF as illustrated in Figure 2 from van Dokkum  Conroy 2012
Notice that the depth of the NaI feature is just a few percent of the pseudocontinuum
and then a drastic variation of the IMF with the low-mass slope changing from s  135
to 4 leads to a variation of the central line depth from  962 to just  952
Formally as shown in Figure 1 even steeper IMFs would be required for the ellipticals
with the highest velocity dispersion Clearly the NaI feature is very insensitive to the
IMF slope and moreover deriving such slope from the strength of this feature rests
entirely on the reliability of the stellar population models used to draw synthetic spectra
such as those shown in Figure 1 Thus to trust the resulting IMF one has to trust the
ability of synthetic models to reproduce the feature with exquisite accuracy Therefore
a check of such models should be mandatory before taking into serious consideration
systematic IMF variations as a function of the velocity dispersion of elliptical galaxies
This is especially true given that models are particularly uncertain ie uncalibrated
for the super-solar metallicities typical of the most massive elliptical galaxies
Any inference on the IMF from integrated light ultimately rests on synthetic stellar
population models and therefore on their reliability For example Cappellari et al 2012
have convincingly demonstrated that mass closely follows light in the core of elliptical
galaxies thus contributing to break the IMF-dark matter degeneracy Having constrained
as marginal the dynamical eect of dark matter they nd that in the core of elliptical
galaxies the ML ratio as inferred from dynamical modeling increases with M and
central velocity dispersion  more than current stellar population models predict They
then interpret this departure in terms of a systematic trend of the IMF with increasing
galaxy mass andor  The ML ratio is certainly a more fundamental bulk property
of galaxies compared to a weak spectral feature Yet also in this case the inference on
the IMF is correct only as long as stellar population models are correct Worth noting
is indeed that also metallicity increases with mass andor  and gets super solar at high
mass and  right where both the heavier IMF is demanded and where population models
are less reliable There is in fact another degeneracy yet to be broken one between the
IMF and stellar population models whose use is unavoidable to infer anything about the
