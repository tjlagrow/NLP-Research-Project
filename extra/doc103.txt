Draft version January 21 2015
ABSTRACT
We show that the ratio of galaxies specic star formation rates SSFRs to their host halos specic mass
accretion rates SMARs strongly constrains how the galaxies stellar masses specic star formation rates and
host halo masses evolve over cosmic time This evolutionary constraint provides a simple way to probe z  8
galaxy populations without direct observations Tests of the method with galaxy properties at z  4 successfully
reproduce the known evolution of the stellar masshalo mass SMHM relation galaxy SSFRs and the cosmic
star formation rate CSFR for 5  z  8 We then predict the continued evolution of these properties for
8  z  15 In contrast to the non-evolution in the SMHM relation at z  4 the median galaxy mass at xed
halo mass increases strongly at z  4 We show that this result is closely linked to the attening in galaxy
SSFRs at z  2 compared to halo specic mass accretion rates we expect that average galaxy SSFRs at xed
stellar mass will continue their mild evolution to z  15 The expected CSFR shows no breaks or features at
z  85 this constrains both reionization and the possibility of a steep falloff in the CSFR at z  910 Finally
we make predictions for stellar mass and luminosity functions for the James Webb Space Telescope which
should be able to observe one galaxy with M  108M per 103 Mpc3 at z  96 and one such galaxy per 104
Mpc3 at z  15

1 INTRODUCTION
The James Webb Space Telescope JWST launch 2018
will strongly constrain galaxy formation from z  20 to z  8
Gardner et al 2006 Population III stars globular clusters
supermassive black hole seeds and the rst galaxies are all
expected to form during this epoch see Bromm  Yoshida
2011 for a review Early galaxies are also expected to
reionize the intergalactic medium see Loeb  Barkana 2001
Haardt  Madau 2012 for reviews Yet constraints on how
many z  8 galaxies JWST will observe have been contra-
dictory Some observations with the Hubble Space Telescope
HST show a deciency of star-forming galaxies at z  9 and
above Ellis et al 2013 Oesch et al 2014b However HST
imaging of clusters has returned evidence for both steeply
declining and mildly evolving cosmic star formation rates
Bouwens et al 2014a Coe et al 2013 Zheng et al 2014
Oesch et al 2014a And to date long gamma-ray bursts de-
tected with Swift which measure the total cosmic star forma-
tion rate as opposed to only star formation above a threshold
suggest only mild evolution in the total cosmic star forma-
tion rate at z  8 Robertson  Ellis 2012 Kistler et al 2013
Wang 2013
Resolving this discrepancy by observing more z  8 galax-
ies is difcult with current instruments Indirect approaches
based on existing measurements of z  7 and z  8 galax-
ies Bradley et al 2012 Schmidt et al 2014 Bouwens et al
2014c represent an alternative Stars formed at z  15 or
z  10 are still present in z  78 galaxies so at the most ba-
sic level a measurement of the current specic star formation
rate can be used to guess how many stars were in place at

nection between galaxy growth and the growth of collapsed

Yang et al 2009 Leauthaud et al 2012a Reddick et al 2013
Tinker et al 2013 Behroozi et al 2013b suggests that a more
physical extrapolation can be made
Jaacks et al 2012ab Dayal et al 2013
Previous theoretical work on the growth of galaxies in
dark matter halos at high redshift has included hydrodynami-
cal simulations eg Finlator et al 2011 Wise et al 2012ab
analytical eg Lacey et al 2011 and semi-empirical mod-
els eg Trenti et al 2010 Tacchella et al 2013 Wyithe et al
These models have tended to require signi-
cant assumptions for how galaxy luminosity is connected
to dark matter halo properties
imposed either indirectly
through sub-grid models in hydrodynamical simulations
or directly as in a constant halo massluminosity relation
in Trenti et al 2010 or as in the semi-analytical models in
Lacey et al 2011 Although the accuracy of existing lumi-
nosity functions at z  8 is disputed as noted above some
of these models predict a sharp decline in the cosmic star for-
mation rate above z  8 due to the lack of galaxies above the
HST observational threshold Trenti et al 2010 Finlator et al
2011 Jaacks et al 2012a Dayal et al 2013
We adopt an approach with somewhat weaker assump-
tions which constrains how the relative growth of galaxies
ie their specic star formation rates relates to the rela-
tive growth of their dark matter halos ie their specic halo
mass accretion rates We show that the ratio of these two
quantities predicts the trajectory along which high-redshift
galaxies evolve in the stellar masshalo mass planeie
it constrains the historical stellar masshalo mass relation-
ship As we will discuss this relationship is valuable not
only for predicting high-redshift and faint galaxy properties
but also for understanding the SSFR plateauthat is why
galaxy SSFRs at xed stellar mass are relatively at at z  2

Figure 1 Galaxy evolution in the stellar masshalo mass plane The back-
ground gure shows the stellar masshalo mass relations from z  8 to z  0
from Behroozi et al 2013c Evolution in this plane is set by two factors
Galaxies specic star formation rates SSFRs set the rate at which they in-
crease in log stellar mass Similarly their specic halo mass accretion rates
SMARs set the rate at which they increase in log halo mass The power-
law slope of their future stellar masshalo mass trajectory is therefore set by
the ratio of their SSFRs to their SMARs recalling that this slope equals rise
SSFR over run SMAR Combining measured specic star formation rates
with halo mass accretion histories from simulations therefore lets one predict
galaxies previous evolution in the stellar masshalo mass plane
Weinmann et al 2011 In addition the connection to SSFRs
also offers a better understanding of why the stellar mass
halo mass relationship appears to evolve at redshifts z  4
Behroozi et al 2013c but remains relatively constant for
z  4 Behroozi et al 2013b
We describe the details of our approach in 2 discuss ex-
isting constraints from observations and simulations in 3
present tests and error analyses of the approach in 4 and
present results for z  8 galaxy populations in 5 We discuss
how these results affect the SSFR plateau dwarf galaxy
star formation efciency abundance matching including the
too big to fail problem reionization and expectations for
JWST in 6 nally we summarize conclusions in 7 Our
adopted cosmology is a at CDM universe with M  027
b  0045 h  07 8  082 and ns  095
these are
very similar to the WMAP9 best-t parameters Bennett et al
2013 Throughout this paper we use the virial spherical over-
density denition in Bryan  Norman 1998 for halo masses
2 THEORY
21 Basic Principles
Galaxy star formation histories are typically parametrized
as a function of time ie SFRt Yet physically interpreting
SFRt is not straightforward because changes in SFR with
time come both from large-scale environment eg the red-
shift dependence of mass accretion rates and local properties
eg host halo mass and gravitational potential well depth
We therefore consider a more physical parametrization which
separates these two effects
Galaxies at time t f in a given stellar mass bin will have a
well-dened average stellar mass M f  and a well-dened
average halo mass Mh f  The halo mass is determinable
through abundance matchingmodeling if it is not known
through other means 32
In this paper we parametrize
the average growth of the galaxies in terms of the average
growth of their host dark matter halos ie as MMht The
changing cosmological accretion rate is captured in the aver-
age halo mass growth history Mht The historical efciency
with which the galaxies converted infalling baryons into stars
is captured in how M depends on Mh We can write the galax-
ies average star formation histories in terms of MMh as
SFRMht 
Just as for SFRt-parametrized star formation histories the
form of MMh will depend on the redshift and stellar mass
of the galaxies in question5
As with tting SFRt directly we have to make an assump-
tion about the functional form of MMh Regardless of its
true form we can approximate the recent stellar masshalo
mass history as a power law This form is especially reason-
able for galaxies at z  4 which are typically not massive
enough to experience AGN feedback and so only experience
stellar feedback supernovae and reionization over much of
their growth histories We also test this assumption directly in
4 for galaxies from z  4 to z  8 So we let
MMh  M fcid18 Mh
Mh fcid19
where  is the unknown power-law dependence We re-
emphasize that Eq 2 describes the historical evolution of a
galaxy population so  differs from the local slope of the
stellar masshalo mass SMHM relation at time t f if and
only if the SMHM relation is evolving with redshift
Combining Eq 2 with Eq 1 the star formation rate history
becomes a simple expression
SFRt 
Letting SSFRt be the specic star formation rate M- 1
as a function of time and letting SMARt be the halo specic
mass accretion rate M- 1
dt  the beautiful symmetry in Eq
3 is apparent
SSFRt
SMARt
That is the ratio of a galaxy populations average SSFR to its
average specic host halo mass accretion rate will be constant
under the weak assumption that the recent historical stellar
masshalo mass relation for the populations progenitors has
a power-law form
If we remove the assumption of a power-law growth history
we note that this ratio still describes the recent growth of the
galaxies
SSFRt
SMARt
d log M
d log Mh
d logM
d logMh
which is valid as long as SSFRt and SMARt are both pos-
itive As shown in Fig 1 Eq 5 is really a geometric state-
ment about the logarithmic stellar masshalo mass plane
The SSFR sets the galaxies velocity along the logarithmic
stellar mass axis and the SMAR sets the velocity along the
logarithmic halo mass axis The ratio of these two velocities
5 We note that stellar mass loss through supernovae and stellar winds
and stellar mass gain through mergers will also change M These effects
cancel to within 10 percent see 22 and Fig 2 so we continue to write

average specic halo mass accretion rates as a function of halo mass and redshift The specic halo mass accretion rate depends only weakly on halo mass
rise over run corresponds to the slope of the galaxies tra-
jectory in this plane this slope will be constant as long as

Eqs 4 and 2 therefore yield a simple way to constrain
galaxy progenitors For this method two galaxy stellar mass
functions at nearby redshifts would sufce for observational
constraints The remaining inputs include host halo masses
for the galaxies which may be found by abundance match-
ingmodeling 32 halo mass accretion histories deter-
mined via dark matter simulations 33 and galaxy specic
star formation rates which are set by the growth of the stellar
mass function between the two redshifts 31 32 The ratio
of the galaxies specic star formation rates to their host ha-
los specic halo mass accretion rates Eq 4 then yields the
power-law slope of the progenitors historical stellar mass
halo mass relation This can be used to infer basic informa-
tion about the galaxies progenitors including the progeni-
tors star formation histories specic star formation rates
stellar masses and halo masses As no observations of the
progenitors are required this method can yield constraints on
galaxy populations which are otherwise too faint or at too high
of a redshift to be observed directly
Eg one may also model
We note in passing that Eq 5 applies for any pair
of coupled variables
growth of black holes in galaxies using the ratio of spe-
cic black hole mass accretion rates to specic star for-
mation rates Current research in the coevolution of black
holes in galaxies has focused on the correlation between
black hole accretion rates and star formation rates see eg
Silverman et al 2008 Aird et al 2010 Mullaney et al 2012
Conroy  White 2013 Chen et al 2013 Hickox et al 2014
Considering the relationship between the specic rates instead
may be an interesting avenue for future research
22 Stellar Mass Loss Mergers Scatter and the Initial Mass
Function
A galaxys stellar mass can change not only because of
new star formation Eq 1 but also through stellar mass
loss stellar winds and supernovae and mergers of smaller
galaxies We adopt the stellar mass loss fraction as a
function of time from Behroozi et al 2013c which is
based on the FSPS population synthesis model Conroy et al
The logarithmic form results in a very rapid 15 loss over the
rst 25 Myrs followed by another more gradual loss of 15
over the next 500 Myrs For the high-redshift z  4 galaxies
we consider typical specic star formation rates are on the or-
der of 510 10- 9 yr- 1 Behroozi et al 2013c which lead to
characteristic formation timescales of 100200 Myrs Since
these timescales fall in the gradual loss regime the overall
stellar mass loss is quite insensitive to the exact star forma-
tion histories and is in the range 1520
We next calculate the expected gain in stellar mass from
mergers This is a convolution between halo merger rates
and the stellar masshalo mass relation both of which we
take from constraints in Behroozi et al 2013c As shown in
the left panel of Fig 2 merging halos contribute about 12
18 of the total stellar mass in most galaxies for 4  z  8
very massive galaxies may receive up to a 30 contribu-
tion This small fraction can be understood from the fact
that the stellar mass to halo mass ratio declines with halo
mass so most of the incoming stellar mass will come from
major mergers Behroozi et al 2014b The aforementioned
star formation timescales 150 Myrs are shorter than the
expected major merger timescales 1 per 300 Myr from
z  8 to z  6 Fakhouri  Ma 2008 Fakhouri et al 2010
Behroozi et al 2013c meaning that mergers contribute a mi-
nority of the stellar mass growth
As a result mergers and stellar mass loss nearly cancel each
others effects Fig 2 left panel representing in only a 5
10 total correction to  in Eq 4 From z  8 to z  4 ha-
los grow by a factor of  1 dex so this correction would re-
sult in a 0102 dex error in the inferred stellar masses over
this range see also Eq 7 This is well within typical 03
dex systematic errors for stellar masses Conroy et al 2009
Behroozi et al 2010 2013c All the same we correct the
stellar mass in Eq 4 to remove stellar mass from mergers and
to include stellar mass lost due to passive evolution This pro-
cess is described in 32
Another potential source of error is scatter in halo mass at
BEHROOZI  SILK
xed stellar mass The average specic halo mass accretion
rate is an extremely weak function of halo mass Fig 2 right
panel Eg a change of 03 dex in halo mass corresponds
to a change of  55 in the specic mass accretion rate for
1012M halos However galaxy mass may correlate with a
halos recent accretion rate which can bias the galaxies host
halo specic accretion rates We avoid these kinds of selec-
tion biases by directly constraining the average stellar mass
and the average star formation rate as a function of halo mass
as in Behroozi et al 2013c as discussed in 32 This allows
us to select galaxies at xed halo mass the corresponding av-
erage specic halo mass accretion rates can then be calculated
in an unbiased way from a dark matter simulation 33 and
Fig 2 right panel
Finally the choice of initial mass function IMF has a
minimal effect The primary effect of switching eg to a
Salpeter 1955 IMF would be to identically rescale the SFR
and stellar mass leaving their ratio unchanged Conroy et al
2009 Although the stellar mass normalization would be af-
fected the predicted evolution from Eq 4 would remain the
same A secondary effect would be to change the inferred
stellar mass loss by 510 depending on galaxy metallic-
ity Shimizu  Inoue 2013 but this would not change the
ratio of the star formation rate to the total stellar mass ever
formed which is what is relevant for Eq 4 However we
note the possibility that the IMF may change to be more top-
heavy at high redshifts for reasons including lower metallic-
ities high gas opacity ultracompact star clusters tidal shear
or rising CMB temperatures see Scalo 2005 Bonnell et al
2007 for reviews Some specic recent examples are given
for starbursts in Weidner et al 2011 for low metallicity at
high redshift in Narayanan  Dav 2013 for ultracompact
star clusters and low metallicity in Marks et al 2012 and
disturbed galaxies in Habergham et al 2010
3 CONSTRAINTS FROM OBSERVATIONS AND SIMULATIONS
We discuss direct specic star formation rate measurements
in 31 our method for constraining stellar masses and spe-
cic star formation rates as a function of halo mass and red-
shift in 32 and the dark matter simulations we use in 33
31 Measuring Specic Star Formation Rates
Specic star formation rates are difcult to measure di-
rectly This is most clear at low redshifts where many in-
dependent determinations are available eg Fig 3 compares
several direct measurements of the z  1 SSFR from recent lit-
erature These have all been normalized to a Chabrier 2003
Initial Mass Function IMF however signicant disagree-
ment is present both in the amplitudes and slopes of the mea-
surements Behroozi et al 2013c found that this level of
scatter 03 dex between different publications direct mea-
surements is present at all redshiftseven for those now con-
sidered nearby z  05
The magnitude of these uncertainties is important because
they directly translate into the uncertainty in the power-law
slope of the star formation efciency inferred from Eq 4 see
4 For that reason it is not appropriate to rely on specic
SFR measurements from a single source We instead rely
on the meta-analysis technique described in Behroozi et al
2013c and 32 which combines constraints from many dif-
ferent direct SSFR measurements with constraints from the
growth rate of the stellar mass function For our methodol-
ogy tests 4 we restrict the meta-analysis to data obtained
at z  5 for our predictions 5 we use the full data for z  8

icant scatter in both amplitudes and slopes Except where specied we
adopt the specic star formation rates from the meta-analysis technique in
Behroozi et al 2013c which incorporates these and other published con-
straints on galaxy SSFRs as well as constraints from the growth of the stellar
mass function from z  8 to z  0
As shown in Fig 3 this meta-analysis process is largely
equivalent to taking the median of the published direct SSFR
measurements However for completeness we discuss the
results from using single-source direct measurements of the
SSFR in Appendix A
32 Constraining the Stellar MassHalo Mass Relation and
Specic Star Formation Rates through Abundance
Modeling
We here distinguish abundance modeling from abundance
matching The latter nonparametrically constrains the stel-
lar masshalo mass SMHM relation by assigning galax-
ies ranked by decreasing stellar mass to halos ranked by
decreasing halo mass within equal volumes Abundance
modeling instead assumes a parametric form usually in-
formed by abundance matching for the SMHM relation
and uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMC method to
constrain the posterior distribution for the SMHM param-
eters This approach benets because observational con-
straints besides the stellar mass function SMF at a single
redshift may be readily incorporated into the MCMC like-
lihood function Examples include SMFs at multiple red-
shifts Moster et al 2010 2013 Behroozi et al 2010 2013c

We follow the same technique used in Behroozi et al
2013c and we refer readers to that paper for full details
Briey we adopt a six-parameter functional form to describe
the SMHM relation at a single redshift This form includes
parameters for a characteristic halo mass and stellar mass a
faint-end power-law slope a massive-end turnoff a shape for
the transition between faint- and massive-end behavior and
PREDICTING HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXY EVOLUTION
the scatter in stellar mass at xed halo mass For each pa-
rameter three variables control the evolution at low z  05
medium 05  z  2 and high z  2 redshifts giving a
total of 18 variables to describe the evolution of the SMHM
relation We additionally include nuisance parameters for sys-
tematic effects including systematic offsets in recovered stel-
lar masses for active and passive galaxies random errors in
stellar masses incompleteness at high redshifts due to dusty
andor bursty star formation and the fraction of stellar growth
due to in situ star formation vs ex situ mergers
Every location in this parameter space corresponds to a spe-
cic choice for the SMHM relation SMMhz as a function
of halo mass and redshift For the halo mass denition we use
the peak historical virial Bryan  Norman 1998 halo mass
along halos growth trajectories Mpeak which was found by
Reddick et al 2013 to be the best halo mass proxy for re-
producing galaxy clustering and luminosity functions Each
choice of SMMhz then represents a unique way to assign
stellar masses for every halo at every timestep in a dark matter
simulation The expected stellar mass function at any redshift
is therefore set by the number density of galaxies in dark mat-
ter halos expected specic star formation rates and cosmic
star formation rates are set by the growth of galaxies along
dark matter merger trees The closeness of these expectations
to observed constraints gives the relative likelihood for the
chosen parameter set an MCMC algorithm then determines
the posterior distribution of allowable SMHM relations as
well as the implied specic star formation rates as a func-
tion of halo mass and redshift required by 22 and 31
As the dark matter halo merger trees allow full bookkeeping
for the amount of stellar mass accreted in mergers and lost
through passive stellar evolution these corrections to galaxy
stellar masses can be readily subtracted as discussed in 22
For observational constraints we use the compilation in
Behroozi et al 2013c This includes stellar mass functions6
specic star formation rates7 and cosmic star formation rates8
from z  8 to z  0 For the tests in 4 we have also performed
a restricted analysis excluding all verication dataie all
data at z  5
The main output of this model is the posterior distribution
for MMhzie the stellar mass as a function of halo mass
and redshift As averaged star formation rates as a function
of halo mass and redshift are available from the intermediate
steps in the calculation we can straightforwardly calculate the
posterior distribution of specic star formation rates as a func-
tion of redshift and halo mass

109 dark matter particles in a 250 Mpc h- 1 comoving
periodic box from z  80 to z  0 using the ART code
Kravtsov et al 1997 Kravtsov  Klypin 1999 Its mass and
force resolution 19  108M and 1 kpc h- 1 respectively
allow it to resolve dark matter halos down to 1010M The
assumed cosmology is a at CDM cosmology with param-
eters m  027   073 h  07 8  082 and ns  095
these are very close to the WMAP9BAOH0 best-t values
Bennett et al 2013 Dark matter halos were found using the
ROCKSTAR phase-space temporal halo nder Behroozi et al
2013d merger trees were assembled using the CONSISTENT
TREES code Behroozi et al 2013e which reconstructs miss-
ing halos in merger trees to preserve gravitational consistency
across simulation timesteps
As discussed in 21 and 32 our approach requires the av-
erage growth rate h Mpeaki for halos as a function of redshift
and mass Behroozi et al 2013c already determined the me-
dian mass accretion histories for halos in Bolshoi we there-
fore build on this existing t which is expressed as a function
of the z  0 halo mass and the scale factor The full calibra-
tion and tting procedure are discussed in Appendix B For
the halo mass function we adopt the modied Tinker et al
2008 form in Behroozi et al 2013c which was t to the
Bolshoi halo mass function for 0  z  8
Bolshois constraints on halos weaken above z  8 due
to its mass completeness limit However extrapolating the
Behroozi et al 2013c halo mass function t to higher red-
shifts compares well to the t in Watson et al 2013 which
is calibrated to z  26 We nd maximum differences of 15
25 between the two mass functions from z  10 to z  15
these are consistent with systematic biases from the choice of
halo nder Knebe et al 2011 2013 Watson et al 2013 We
also have compared to the average mass accretion histories in
Wu et al 2013 nding a maximum difference of 5 in the
specic mass accretion rates at z  10

In this section we check how well Eqs 24 can be used
to derive the z  4 stellar masshalo mass SMHM relation
from the z  4 galaxy SMHM relation SSFRs and halo spe-
cic mass accretion rates Starting at z  4 is motivated be-
cause we approximated galaxies historical stellar masshalo
mass SMHM relationships as pure power laws Eq 2 This
approximation is most appropriate if the galaxys history is
dominated by a single feedback mode eg stellar feedback
for star formation see 21 at z  4 AGN-mode or other
feedback in massive galaxies results in rapidly declining star
formation histories Behroozi et al 2013c9 Note that while
any starting redshift z  4 is reasonable we choose z  4 be-
cause it gives the longest redshift baseline z  4 for galaxies
up to z  8 over which we can test the predictions of Eqs 24
Predicting the high-redshift SMHM relation is only a fair
test if no high-redshift data has been used as a constraint To
that end we have rerun the abundance modeling framework
discussed in 32 using observational data constraints cover-
ing 0  z  5 As noted in 31 and 32 the inclusion of stel-
lar mass function data at z  5 allows the growth of the stellar

ies with more complicated histories although only for the galaxies recent

and SSFRs at z  4 are shown in comparison to the results
of Behroozi et al 2013c which used data constraints from

relation of the restricted analysis is as expected slightly dif-
ferent from the best-tting result of Behroozi et al 2013c
but it is still well within the observational error bars
tremely consistent with constraints on the evolution of the

redshift z  8 from Behroozi et al 2013c They are also
consistent with nonparametric abundance matching of stel-
lar mass functions at those redshifts Fig 4 within the ex-
pected systematic observational errors While the shape and
amplitude of the SMHM relation remain relatively constant

lution and the fully-constrained evolution over z  4 to z  8

42 Specic and Cosmic Star Formation Rates
We next calculate how Eq 4 predicts that the SSFR for
109M galaxies changes with redshift Fig 5 given SSFRs
and SMARs at z  4 Fig 4 At xed redshift more mas-
sive galaxies have lower specic star formation rates SSFRs
and larger specic halo mass accretion rates SMARs than
smaller galaxies see eg Fig 4 As a result they would
be expected to maintain a smaller SSFRSMAR ratio over
their growth history Eq 4 The more massive the galaxy
is at z  4 the higher the redshift when it reached 109M
Since more massive galaxies have lower SSFRSMAR ra-
tios Fig 4 we expect that the SSFRSMAR ratio at xed
stellar mass will decline with increasing redshift
This is exactly what is shown in Fig 5 While the spe-
cic mass accretion rate rises steadily with redshift the de-
clining SSFRSMAR ratio leads to an apparent plateau
Weinmann et al 2011 which is extremely consistent with
the observed specic star formation rates at high redshifts
We also show the expected observed cosmic star forma-
tion rates in Fig 6 again calculated from galaxy SSFRs
at z  4 To calculate these we applied the expected spe-
cic star formation rates and the expected stellar mass
halo mass relationship 41 to the halo mass function
Behroozi et al 2013c We integrated the resulting num-
ber density down to an assumed UV luminosity threshold of
M1500AB  - 18 matching recent high-redshift observations
Oesch et al 2014b where UV luminosities were computed
without including dust as described in Appendix C As shown
in Fig 6 the cosmic star formation rates expected from the
SSFR to SMAR ratio of z  4 galaxies are extremely consis-
tent with existing observations from z  5 to z  8
We note that the uncertainties on specic star formation
rates are not as sensitive to the redshift baseline because the
errors are not cumulative The fractional uncertainty  in
the SSFR to SMAR ratio  translates directly into the frac-
tional uncertainty in specic star formation rates As   25
41 this suggests that specic star formation rate predic-
tions are extremely robust as long as the assumption of a
power-law historical stellar masshalo mass relation Eq 2
holds Galaxy star formation rates will be the product of the
SSFR and stellar mass which will result in fractional errors
 log101   - 025z dex
Since the total integrated stellar mass must remain constant
an error in  will result in redistributing when past cosmic star
formation happened The error in Eq 8 thus has a sign change
when log101   025z Noting that log101  is well-
approximated by  log10e for small  this fractional error
- 1 re-
becomes zero for redshift baselines of z  4 log10e

SMARs were equal   1 the relative growth rates of galaxy
stellar mass and host halo mass are the sameso that the his-
torical stellar masshalo mass ratio remains constant For 
slightly greater than unity this will still be approximately true
so that the historical SMHM ratios will have at most a weak
dependence on their historical halo mass So the galaxies
forming stars at peak efciency at z  4 will be the progeni-
tors of the galaxies forming stars at peak efciency at z  4
Similarly the halo mass at which the SMHM ratio reaches any
chosen amplitude is also expected to evolve see also 52
The uncertainties in these predictions grow as the red-
shift baseline increases At high redshifts halo growth is

5 RESULTS
We discuss predictions for high-redshift specic and cos-
mic star formation rates in 51 stellar masses in 52 and
sensitivity to errors in 53
51 Predictions for Specic and Cosmic Star Formation
As shown in Fig 5 we expect specic star formation rates
to rise slowly with redshift at xed galaxy mass At z  4 and
above galaxy SSFRs are nearly the same magnitude as host
halo specic mass accretion rates see eg Fig 4 As argued
in 21 and 41 the ratio of SSFRs to halo specic mass ac-
cretion rates is conserved for progenitors of z  4 galaxy pop-
ulations hence higher-redshift SSFRs will also be about the
same magnitude as the slowly-rising halo specic mass accre-
tion rates Since the choice of initial redshift is arbitrary we
show the SSFR evolution predicted from assuming constant
SSFR to SMAR ratios for galaxies starting at z  5 z  6 and
z  7 in Fig 5 Consistent with the error analysis in 42 these
predictions are all very similar to each other as well as to the
prediction from the restricted analysis in 42
Predictions for observed cosmic star formation rates are
shown in Fig 6 as in 42 we require galaxies to have a
threshold UV luminosity of M1500AB  - 18 These star forma-
tion rates show a smooth decline from z  4 to z  15 As with
SSFRs we show predictions from assuming constant SSFR to
SMAR ratios taken from Behroozi et al 2013c for galaxies
starting at z  5 z  6 and z  7 as well as from the restricted
analysis in 42
As noted in 1 Oesch et al 2014b found an apparent
sharp steepening in the CSFR evolution beyond z  8
our model we do not nd this steepening to occur
itively this is because galaxy stellar mass doubling times at
z  7 and z  8 are on the order of 100200 Myrs see Fig
5 Hence if galaxy SSFRs at z  7 and z  8 are correct
there should still be signicant star formation ongoing at z  9
and z  10 If the Oesch et al 2014b results turn out to be
correct on the other hand specic star formation rates at
z  7 and z  8 would have to be a factor of 3 higher than
current measurements ie beyond existing corrections for
nebular emission Labb et al 2013 The tension between
the Oesch et al 2014b measurements and our predictions is
at the 152 sigma level Fig 7 We nd that the discrep-
ancy is too large to be explained by cosmic variance uncer-
tainties Trenti  Stiavelli 2008 or by underestimating the
effective UV luminosity threshold by a factor of 25 Fig
7 Instead these results may indicate that the UVSFR con-
version in Oesch et al 2014b underestimates the star for-
mation rate for young stellar populations at lower metallici-
ties Castellano et al 2014 Madau  Dickinson 2014 Al-
ternately the contamination exclusion criteria in Oesch et al
2014b may be too restrictive eg removing point sources to
exclude contamination from nearby stars may also affect com-
pact galaxies at very high redshifts We note that high-redshift
measurements are rapidly evolving as this manuscript was
being revised Oesch et al 2014a found a doubly-imaged
z  10 candidate in the Frontier Fields which may suggest
a somewhat higher cosmic star formation rate Fig 7
We can also predict the total observed  unobserved
CSFR galaxies too faint to be observed at a given redshift can
be constrained by their descendants at a later redshift A UV
luminosity threshold of M1500AB  - 18 is expected to miss
nearly half of the total star formation rate at z  8 and miss
two-thirds by z  12 Long gamma-ray bursts at high red-
shifts can also constrain the total CSFR Although signicant
calibration uncertainties remain for how the long gamma-ray
burst rate depends on metallicity and redshift10 our predic-
tions are generally within the one-sigma error bars of cur-
rent constraints Kistler et al 2009 2013 We caution that
Kistler et al 2009 2013 normalized the ratio of the cosmic
gamma ray burst rate to the CSFR using the CSFR calibration
in Hopkins  Beacom 2006 As discussed in Behroozi et al
2013c more recent measurements of the CSFR have been
systematically lower than the Hopkins  Beacom 2006 cal-
ibration by 03 dex this new normalization would lower the
GRB-derived star formation rates by at least the same factor
As shown in Fig 7 lowering the Kistler et al 2013 results
by 03 dex results in excellent agreement with our predictions
for the total CSFR

lar mass evolution are  025 dex for a redshift baseline of
z  4 and  05 dex for a redshift baseline of z  8 these

mass ratios for halo masses below Mh  109M Gnedin 2000
The median predicted evolution of the SMHM ratio is
shown in Fig 9 We nd that the redshift evolution seen in
the SMHM ratio from z  4 to z  8 is expected to continue
to very high redshifts More quantitatively we can calculate
as a function of redshift the halo mass at which the stel-
lar mass is one percent of the halo mass The evolution of
this halo mass with redshift is shown in Fig 10 At z  4
this mass hardly evolves which suggests that halo mass de-
termines galaxy star formation efciency at z  4 see also
Behroozi et al 2013b At higher redshifts this mass evolves
continuously from 10115M at z  4 to 1093M at z  15
ie over two orders of magnitude across this redshift range
This evolution cannot be explained by appealing to an evolv-
ing halo mass denition Eg it outpaces even that expected
over the halo
prole which is a direct physical measure of the halos po-
tential well depth The evolution at z  4 may match better
with a xed central density eg density within the central 1
kpc as shown in Fig 10 which would correspond to a xed

of galaxies ie if there is a strong rank correlation between
the true galaxy stellar masses and the observationally calcu-
lated galaxy stellar masses the inferred halo masses will not
be affected As a result the specic star formation rates as a
function of halo mass are robust
The systematic biases in absolute stellar masses do affect
the stellar mass  halo mass relationships presented in this
paper We have included these uncertainties in the error bars
in Figs 4 8 9 and 10 for high-redshift predictions we have
also included uncertainties from Eq 7 Yet the conclusion
that the characteristic halo mass for the stellar masshalo
mass relation changes from z  8 to z  4 is extremely robust to
these uncertainties As shown in Figs 9 and 10 the halo mass
for a given SMHM ratio is signicantly lower at z  8 than it
is at z  4 Considering the slope of the SMHM relation the
stellar mass for a given halo mass is a full decade higher at
z  8 than it is at z  4 This means that at xed cumulative
number density galaxy stellar masses are one dex higher at
z  8 than would be predicted by keeping the z  8 SMHM
relationship the same as at z  4 This level of evolution cannot
be explained by known systematic biases which are only of
order 025 dex
We note that the stellar mass functions we have used for z 
7 and z  8 were obtained by converting UV luminosity func-
tions Bouwens et al 2014c to stellar mass functions using
Gonzlez et al 2011 The Gonzlez et al 2011 conversion
applied to luminosity functions at z  4 and z  5 results in
mass functions systematically too low compared to other re-
sults at z  4 and z  5 eg Stark et al 2009 Marchesini et al
2010 however it is in agreement with Stark et al 2009
by z  6 This may be because galaxies become systemati-
cally less dusty Bouwens et al 2014b and younger Fig 5
at high redshifts and so have higher luminosity to mass ratios
Nebular emission lines in high-redshift galaxies can bias stel-
lar mass estimations Stark et al 2013 de Barros et al 2014
however using the Gonzlez et al 2011 conversion at z  6
gives consistent results with these recent studies D Stark
priv comm Due to these concerns we have generated UV
luminosity functions from our assumed star formation histo-
ries and nd that they agree directly with the Bouwens et al
2014c luminosity functions in Appendix C Finally we have
checked that new stellar mass functions from the CANDELS
survey at z  6 are within the error bars of the converted stellar
mass functions that we use Duncan et al in prep Grazian
et al in prep

results
Planck Collaboration et al 2013 suggest
that M may
be higher and h may be lower than the values used in this
paper see however Spergel et al 2013 We nd that
the differential comoving volume as a function of redshift
affecting stellar mass functions and cosmic star formation
rates decreases by only 67 for z  4 when we adopt
M  0307 and h  068 The increased M does result in
an increase to the high-redshift halo mass function at xed
cumulative number density halo masses are  008 dex
larger at z  4 and  019 dex larger at z  15 Fig 11 This
corresponds to an average change in mass accretion rates of
001 dex 2 which we explicitly verify with halo merger
trees in Appendix B
A 2 change in halo mass accretion rates is within the ex-
isting uncertainties for the mass accretion rate tting formula
that we use Appendix B we therefore do not expect this

describes the evolution reasonably well for z  4 neither constant mass nor
constant vmax tracks the mass evolution for z  4 Instead the evolution is
much closer to the average mass accretion histories of halos suggesting that
high redshift star formation efciency may be more inuenced by environ-
mental factors eg mass accretion rates than at lower redshifts
cess and we cannot rule out contributions from other sources
53 Sensitivity to Systematic Errors
531 Stellar Mass Functions
Results in this paper depend mostly on the growth of the
stellar mass function over redshifts from z  8 to z  4 es-
pecially since this growth largely constrains galaxy specic
star formation rates 32 We therefore address several
uncertainties in high-redshift stellar mass functions includ-
ing 025 dex systematic biases in recovering stellar masses
Behroozi et al 2013c Curtis-Lake et al 2013 sample vari-
ance from small survey volumes 01 dex for the z  7 stel-
lar mass functions Trenti  Stiavelli 2008 and low-redshift
interlopers at the massive end of the stellar mass function
We cannot directly resolve interloper contamination so we
avoid presenting results from the bright end of the stellar
mass function where such contamination is most an issue
eg galaxy stellar masses  1095M at z  8 The spe-
cic star formation rates we calculate as a function of halo
mass are robust to the other two issues Sample variance
uncertainties are reduced because we use a smooth function
to model the redshift evolution of the stellar mass function
32 Currently-known uncertainties in computing stellar
masses eg assumed stellar population histories dust mod-
eling uncertainties in stellar population synthesis do not re-
sult in systematic biases that change rapidly with redshift or
stellar mass Therefore when comparing two stellar mass
functions at two nearby redshifts systematic biases will re-
sult in similar offsets to the stellar masses in both stellar mass
functions The relative growth of stellar massesie specic
star formation ratescomputed from these stellar mass func-
tions will therefore be largely unaffected While the absolute
galaxy stellar masses will be affected by these biases the in-
ferred halo masses depend only on galaxy cumulative number
densities as a function of stellar mass So as long as the sys-
tematic uncertainties do not destroy the overall rank-ordering

6 DISCUSSION
As we have shown in 2 and 4 the ratio of galaxies
specic star formation rates SSFRs to their host halo spe-
cic mass accretion rates SMARs sets the evolution of the
galaxy progenitors stellar masshalo mass SMHM rela-
tions Knowledge of two of these three quantities allows one
to solve for the third as discussed in 5
In this section
we discuss several consequences of this three-way relation-
ship as well as implications of our predicted high-redshift
galaxy evolution We consider the specic star formation
rate plateau in 61 reionization in 62 expectations for
JWST in 63 abundance matching in 64 and comparisons
to other work in 65

As shown in Figs 9 and 10 we nd that the evolution of
the SMHM relation can be very simply described At z 
4 the SMHM ratio depends much more on halo mass than
on redshift Behroozi et al 2013b At z  4 however the
characteristic halo mass evolves strongly with redshift More

This evolution at high redshift is close to the average accretion
rate of halos Fig 10 so the SMHM ratio is approximately
unchanging as a function of cumulative number density or of
peak height 
As discussed in 53 and as shown in Fig 10 this mass evo-
lution is much larger than can be explained by known system-
atic biases We note that this mass evolution is not only con-
sistent with attening in specic star formation rates at high
redshifts Weinmann et al 2011 but also that they are equiv-
alent statements For a galaxy population with a given stel-
lar mass and redshift the ratio of the galaxies SSFRs to their
host halos specic mass accretion rates is equal to the power-
law slopes of their historical SMHM relations Eqs 24 If
these historical slopes are not completely parallel to the slope
of the SMHM relation at the starting redshift then galaxies
will evolve off their original SMHM relationshipthat is to
say the SMHM relationship as a whole must evolve with red-
shift As a corollary evolution in the ratio of galaxy SSFRs to
their host halo specic halo mass accretion rates eg Fig 5
must be accompanied by evolution in the SMHM relationship
as the ratio changes the evolutionary trajectories of galaxies
will change and no single SMHM relationship can be parallel
to all galaxy trajectories
Flattening of galaxy specic star formation rates at high
redshifts implies a decrease in the ratio of galaxy SSFRs to
their host halo specic mass accretion rates In Fig 5 the ratio
of galaxy SSFRs to host halo mass accretion rates is consis-
tent within observational errors with the slope of the SMHM
relation at xed redshift at least for z  4 However the ratio
at higher redshifts is too low to be consistent From Eq 5
if this ratio falls below the slope of the SMHM relationship
at xed redshift and if the SMHM relationship has a posi-
tive slope then the SMHM relationship will evolve to higher
efciencies at higher redshifts
So the growth rate of the stellar mass function and the
attening in observed specic star formation rates both pro-
vide evidence that halos with masses below 1012M formed
stars more efciently at very high redshifts than they did for
0  z  4 Part of the reason for this may be a change in the
gravitational potential well depth at xed halo mass Fig 10
52 This is not likely the only explanation as it would re-
quire evolution in the characteristic halo mass over 0  z  4
Fig 10 feedback efciency at high redshift may also be re-
duced However other factors like increased central density
at high redshifts Fig 10 may decrease cooling times enough
to explain the evolution
62 Reionization
Knowing the cosmic star formation history it is possible
to calculate the hydrogen reionization history of the universe
We use the minimal reionization model of Haardt  Madau
2012
where Q is the reionized fraction nion is the creation rate den-
sity of ionizing photons nHHe is the number density of hy-
drogen and helium atoms and trec is the recombination time
In this model single ionization of helium is assumed to hap-
pen at the same time as hydrogen we assume that the helium
mass fraction is Y  024 Ionizing photon production is given
nion  N fescCSFR
where N is the number of ionizing photons per unit mass of
stars fesc is the average escape fraction from galaxies and
CSFR is the cosmic star formation rate For a low-metallicity
Salpeter IMF N would be 5  1060M- 1

Figure 14 The halo mass below which 50 of star formation occurs as a
function of redshift ie the median halo mass for star formation The errors
are dominated by uncertainties on the faint-end slope of the star formation
rate function
Since the Chabrier IMF that we use has fewer low-mass stars
but the same number of high-mass ionizing stars we take
N equal to 765  1060M- 1
  this corresponds to 6400 pho-
tons per baryon in stars While inferences at z  5 suggest
escape fractions less than 10 the escape fraction at high red-
shifts is very uncertain Hayes et al 2011 Simulations sug-
gest that the escape fractions can be very large Wise  Cen
2009 Wise et al 2014 current models typically adopt ei-
ther a constant fesc or an fesc which rises rapidly with red-
shift Haardt  Madau 2012 In this paper we use a constant
fesc to simplify the interpretation of our results we note that
this would roughly correspond to the star-formation weighted
average fesc for models in which fesc evolves with time To
explore the range of uncertainties we allow fesc to vary from
01 to 06
The recombination time is given by
trec  BnHHeC- 1
where we take B to be the case B recombination coefcient
at 10000K for hydrogen 279  10- 79 Mpc3 yr- 1 and C to be
the clumping factor The determination of C is also uncertain
with estimates ranging from C  2 to C  4 at high redshifts
Haardt  Madau 2012 we take C  3 as our ducial value
and allow C to vary from 2 to 4 for modeling uncertainties
For any reionization history we can also calculate an opti-
cal depth  for Thomson scattering given by
  TZ tnow
QnHHe  QHeIIInHecdt
where T
is the Thomson cross-section of an electron
6986  10- 74 Mpc2 QHeIII is the fraction of helium that has
been doubly ionized and nHe is the number density of helium
Since the double ionization of helium happens much later than
single ionization it changes  by only  0001 we therefore
x the redshift of double ionization to z  35
The largest uncertainty for  is the escape fraction fol-
lowed by uncertainties in the normalization of the cosmic star
formation rate Fig 12 followed by subdominant uncertain-
ties in the clumping factor If the cosmic star formation rate
at z  4 was currently underestimated by a factor of 2 an
average escape fraction of 02 would be consistent with the
most recent WMAP results at the 1 level However if cur-
rent high-redshift CSFRs are correct fesc would need to av-
erage at least 05 during reionization These escape fractions
agree with other models which match the optical depth eg
Haardt  Madau 2012 Alvarez et al 2012 Bouwens et al
2012b Robertson et al 2013 and are plausible for certain
types of galaxies Wardlow et al 2014 Dijkstra et al 2014
but are higher than typically seen in low-redshift observations
Hayes et al 2011
We also show the expected reionization history of the uni-
verse in Fig 13 for fesc  05 As with the optical depth the
normalization of the cosmic star formation rate is a substan-
tial uncertainty For this escape fraction 68 condence lim-
its on the redshift of half-reionization are 7  z  10 Absent
independent constraints the escape fraction is completely de-
generate with the normalization of the cosmic star formation
history in these models This makes it difcult to use  or the
reionization history as a constraint on galaxy formation or
vice versa
As noted in Alvarez et al 2012 and Wise et al 2014 an
escape fraction which varies strongly with halo mass would
result in an escape fraction which varies strongly with red-
PREDICTING HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXY EVOLUTION
shift as assumed in Haardt  Madau 2012 This is because
the median halo mass for star formation ie the halo mass
below which 50 of star formation occurs is a strong func-
tion of redshift Fig 14 From Fig 14 and Fig 9 we expect
that the galaxies which would reionize the universe at z  8
are typically below 108M and their host halos are typically
below 1010M While escape fractions for these low-mass
galaxies can be observed locally we note that the nature of
star formation in their high-redshift counterparts will likely
be very different as evidenced by the very different stellar
masshalo mass ratios Fig 9
63 Expectations for JWST
If low-mass halos continue to become more efcient at z 
8 Fig 9 JWST should be able to see many M  108M
galaxies out to at least z  15 Fig 15 see also Appendix C for
luminosity functions By comparison if the stellar mass
halo mass relation were xed at z  8 and did not evolve to z 
15 the expected number density of galaxies at z  15 would
drop by over two orders of magnitude Fig 15 We expect
that JWST will rule out at least one of these two scenarios
very shortly after launch Due to the rapid buildup of the halo
mass function from z  15 to z  8 the number density of
galaxies observed with JWST will be very constraining for
galaxy formation models
We nd that the expected faint-end slopes for the stellar
mass functions are -185 to -195 from z  9 to z  15 These
are steep suggesting that deeper JWST pointings will result
in many more observed galaxies However none of the slopes
are signicantly steeper than the faint-end slopes we expect at
z  8 -18 suggesting that the evolution in faint-end slopes
observed over 4  z  8 Bouwens et al 2012b does not con-
tinue to higher redshifts
We note that Eq 4 also constrains the maximum attainable
specic star formation rates for galaxy populations as a func-
tion of redshift From Eq 4 we have
SSFR  SMAR
So maximum SSFR would require maximizing the specic
halo mass accretion rates SMARs as well as the power-law
slope  of the historical SMHM relation The maximum
value of  is limited by available mechanisms to regulate star
formation For halos which are just large enough to accrete
reionized gas  109M Gnedin 2000 and form their rst
stars the specic star formation rates could be effectively in-
nite At larger masses eg  1010M the most important
mechanisms become stellar winds and supernovae from mas-
sive stars Agertz et al 2013 Typical values of  for 1010M
and larger halos range from   2 at z  0 to   1 at z  4
It is difcult to imagine that  could be much higher than 2
because the energy and momentum requirements for leaving
a halo both scale as a low power of the halo mass Eg the
energy needed to escape from a halo scales as halo mass to
the two-thirds power and the escape velocity scales as halo
mass to the one-third power That said we consider values
from   1 to   4 to cover any exotic future feedback mech-
anisms
Note that all variation from galaxy physics is contained in
the slope  and the range   1 to   4 constitutes only
a 03dex uncertainty in the maximum specic star forma-
tion rates for halos larger than 1010M The uncertainty in
specic halo mass accretion rates is negligible in compari-
son as those are directly measurable from dark matter sim-

ulations Appendix B Hence the maximum average SSFRs
for a mass-selected galaxy population are limited to be within
a factor of 14 of the specic mass accretion rates at all red-
shifts as shown in the top panel of Fig 16
These constraints are consistent with existing measure-
ments of galaxy SSFRs Fig 16 They also place strong con-
straints on what typical stellar populations will look like at
higher redshifts Eg at z  10 averaged specic star forma-
tion rates are limited to no more than 10- 73 yr- 1 If a sur-
vey returned higher average specic star formation rates for
galaxies in a chosen stellar mass bin it would most likely
indicate that the survey was biased towards selecting highly
star-forming galaxies or that the analysis pipeline was giving
biased stellar masses or star formation rates11
64 The Too Big to Fail Problem and Satellite Galaxy
Abundance Matching
Redshift evolution in the stellar masshalo mass relation
at z  4 can strongly affect the stellar mass for satellite galax-
ies For example the scatter in satellite stellar masses at
xed peak halo mass could be very large depending on the
distribution of satellite formation times This is especially
true for the satellite halo mass range expected to host the
brightest dwarf satellites of the Milky Way  1091010M
Boylan-Kolchin et al 2012 identied several Milky Way
satellites which were much too bright compared to z  0 stellar
masshalo mass relation Conversely Boylan-Kolchin et al
2012 found that not all of the most massive satellite halos
of the Milky Way could host the brightest satellite galaxies
ie the too big to fail problem While several papers have
shown that the observations may be explained by a combi-
nation of cyclic feedback and tidal interactions with the disk
of the Milky Way Governato et al 2012 Zolotov et al 2012
Teyssier et al 2013 Pontzen  Governato 2014 it remains
possible that some of the satellites were formed and accreted
very early in the history of the universe In this case Figs 9
and 10 would suggest that these early-formed satellites should
have a higher stellar mass than later-formed satellites at xed
circular velocity
We briey note that abundance matching methods typically
match galaxies to halos using the SMHM relation at a sin-
gle redshift For satellites this creates some consistency is-
sues because it is often not clear whether it is better to use the
SMHM relation at the time of the satellites accretion or peak
halo masspeak maximum circular velocity Behroozi et al
2010 Yang et al 2012 Moster et al 2013 At z  2 cluster-
ing and conditional luminosity functions indicate that satellite
galaxy masses are best set by using the SMHM relation at a
single redshift Reddick et al 2013 Watson  Conroy 2013
physically this indicates continued star formation in a frac-
tion of satellites after accretion Wetzel et al 2013 How-
ever strong evolution in the SMHM relation at high redshifts
suggests that abundance matching using the SMHM relation-
ship at the time of accretion or peak halo properties will better
capture satellite galaxy masses at z  4
65 Comparison with Previous Semi-Empirical Models
Several previous models such as Trenti et al 2010 and
Wyithe et al 2014 have assumed that high-redshift star for-
mation occurs in bursty episodes Under this interpretation
11 Of course it could also indicate that CDM is wrongthough this
avenue seems an unlikely way that this could be proven
many galaxies at z  4 are unobserved because they are tem-
porarily not forming stars This assumption is in part based
on rest-frame UV angular clustering measurements at z  4
such as Lee et al 2009 We note however that modeling
angular clustering measurements can be extremely challeng-
ing The Lee et al 2009 conclusions are largely based on the
discrepancy between the 1-halo autocorrelation term between
their model and the observed data However the 1-halo term
is dominated by satellites which tend to have lower star for-
mation rates than central galaxies As a result the Lee et al
2009 results largely constrain the duty cycle of satellites if
only 30 of satellites are star-forming at z  4 this would
still allow 90 of all galaxies to be star-forming since the
satellites make up a small fraction at these redshifts Addi-
tional issues generic to all angular correlation functions are
appropriately propagating uncertainties in the redshift distri-
bution which are difcult to determine for faint galaxies with
UV-only detections and understanding how the sample se-
lection function eg color-color cuts affects the redshift-
dependent average bias of the selected galaxies We note that
Conroy et al 2006 nds no duty cycle to be necessary when
matching angular correlation functions at z  4 and z  5 fur-
ther suggesting that it is very difcult to use angular correla-
tion functions as robust constraints on galaxy duty cycles
the growth of
Separately Wyithe et al 2014 argued for lower duty
cycles so that
the stellar mass density
matches the cosmic star formation rate however previous
discrepancies have largely been resolved Reddy  Steidel
2009 Bernardi et al 2010 Moster et al 2013 Behroozi et al
2013c Also the concern in Wyithe et al 2014 that z  4
galaxies cannot have formed stars at their observed rates
for an entire Hubble time is resolved by strong evidence
for individual galaxies having rising star formation rates
Papovich et al 2011 Behroozi et al 2013ac Moster et al
2013 Lee et al 2014 as well as the overall rise in the total
cosmic star formation rate with time
Because of problems with angular correlation functions
duty cycles at z  4 may not be fully determined until fu-
ture deep rest-frame optical observations Wyithe et al 2014
In our approach we chose not to assume low duty cy-
cles due to several heuristic arguments Most importantly
UV light continues to be emitted by stellar populations up
to 100 Myr old Conroy et al 2009 Castellano et al 2014
Madau  Dickinson 2014 At z  8 this is comparable to
specic halo mass accretion ratesso even if a major star-
burst expels all the gas from a galaxy an equal amount of re-
placement gas will have re-accreted by the time the rst stellar
population fades in the UV At z  4 halo specic mass accre-
tion rates are somewhat lower 2- 3  10- 9 yr- 1 but the typi-
cal halo still grows by 20- 25 in 100 Myr These high accre-
tion rates make it difcult for stellar feedback to completely
quench star formation on long timescales Second high
quenched fractions at z  4 are inconsistent with K-band se-
lected stellar mass functions at z  4 because it would imply
a discontinuous jump between LBG-selected at z  4 and K-
selected at z  4 stellar mass functions Instead the growth
of LBG-selected stellar mass functions into K-selected mass
functions is extremely consistent with measured specic star
formation rates Behroozi et al 2013c Moster et al 201312
Third the quenched fractions measured in K-selected samples
at 2  z  4 are very low Brammer et al 2011 Muzzin et al
2013 except at the very highest stellar masses which is in-
12 This argument also excludes dust from hiding many galaxies at z  4
PREDICTING HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXY EVOLUTION
consistent with a large quenched fraction at z  4unless the
quenched galaxies at z  4 all return to being star forming
at z  4 Fourth regardless of the feedback prescription the
observational duty cycle of galaxies above 109M is unity
in hydrodynamical simulations G Snyder P Hopkins priv
comm Jaacks et al 2012b Wise et al 2014
Despite the differences with our approach both Trenti et al
2010 and Wyithe et al 2014 also nd that galaxy star for-
mation must be more efcient at high redshiftsin their lan-
guage that galaxies have higher duty cycles Their conclusion
is driven by the same evidence as ours namely that if the
same stellar masshalo mass or star formationhalo mass
relationship for z  4 halos were applied to z  8 halos the
resulting stellar mass SFR and luminosity functions would
be an order of magnitude less than observational constraints
531 However we note that the Trenti et al 2010 ex-
tension to high redshifts z  8 is very different than ours
because their duty cycle is nearly 100 at z  8 and has no
more room to grow Hence the Trenti et al 2010 predic-
tions are very similar to the case in Fig 15 where the stellar
masshalo mass relationship is assumed to be xed for z  8
As noted in 63 JWST should be able to very quickly distin-
guish these two scenarios
We note nally that Tacchella et al 2013 took a very dif-
ferent approach which was to model halo star formation
histories as a combination of a burst and a longer-duration
star formation mode While this model provides an excel-
lent match to luminosity functions star formation histories
of halos are not self-consistent across redshifts S Tacchella
priv comm For example the star-formation history of z  5
halos at z  6 in the model is not consistent with the star-
formation histories of z  6 halos at z  6 so if applied to
merger trees the model would require retroactive modica-
tion of galaxy star formation histories It is nonetheless still
interesting mathematically to consider the resulting redshift
evolution the Tacchella et al 2013 model also does not pre-
dict any break in the slope of the cosmic star formation rate
for z  8
7 CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a simple theoretical basis for predicting
galaxy stellar mass specic star formation rate and host halo
mass evolution at high redshifts 21 We reach the follow-
ing conclusions
1 The ratio of galaxies specic star formation rates to
their host halos specic mass accretion rates can be
used to predict galaxies evolution in the stellar mass
halo mass plane with redshift 21 41 42 Ap-
pendix A
2 Tests of this predictive model with galaxy properties at
z  4 successfully match observational constraints on
the stellar masshalo mass relation specic star for-
mation rates and cosmic star formation rates for z  5
to z  8 41 42
3 Galaxy specic star formation rates are expected to in-
crease only mildly at higher redshifts 51
4 Cosmic star formation rates are not expected to rapidly
fall at z  85 in contrast to recent HST measure-
ments but consistent with estimates from long gamma-
ray burst rates 51
5 Halos smaller than 1012M are expected to be increas-
ingly efcient at star formation at z  4 52 which is
strongly linked with the plateau in galaxy SSFRs at
xed stellar mass 61
6 This evolution in efciency is too strong to allow star
formation efciency to be set only by gravitational po-
tential well depth at z  4 52 at z  4 halos main-
tain similar stellar masshalo mass ratios along their
progenitor histories
7 Matching WMAP constraints on the optical depth with
our model requires high average escape fractions of
fesc  02 during reionization 62
8 JWST should see many M  108M galaxies over the
entire redshift range 8  z  15 63

APPENDIX
A TESTS OF THE METHODOLOGY AT Z  01
Because we used abundance modeling to calculate stellar masshalo mass SMHM relations as well as specic star formation
rates 32 throughout this paper it may seem that some of the simplicity of 21 has been lost Here we show that the method
still works without the extra machinery of 32 albeit with some cost to accuracy
In the left panels of Fig 17 we show the SMHM ratios derived in Reddick et al 2013 along with specic star formation
rates from Salim et al 2007 Reddick et al 2013 derived their results from abundance matching the Moustakas et al 2013
stellar mass function at z  01 to halos in the Bolshoi simulation 33 The bottom two panels on the left of Fig 17 also show
the specic halo mass accretion rates from Appendix B These panels show the stark contrast between the formation of galaxies
and halos at low redshifts galaxies in low-mass halos are forming stars much more rapidly than their halos are growing and the
opposite is true for galaxies in high-mass halos
In the right panels of Fig 17 we show predictions for the SMHM ratios at z  1 2 and 3 from using the Reddick et al 2013
and Salim et al 2007 data directly in Eqs 4 and 2 We note that the stellar mass estimators used in Moustakas et al 2013 and
Salim et al 2007 are different each using SED tting with their own stellar population history models and dust models We also
note that the Salim et al 2007 SSFRs are the ratio of current SFR to currently remaining stellar mass whereas Eq 4 requires
the ratio of current SFR to the total stellar mass ever formed For a 13 Gyr-old population the ratio of currently remaining to total
formed stellar mass is 54 Eq 6 so we also show predictions if we multiply the Salim et al 2007 SSFRs by this fraction
These predictions therefore bracket the range of allowable ages for stellar populations We make no attempt to correct for stellar
mass gained in mergers 22 Behroozi et al 2013c nd that the merger contribution is negligible for Mh  1012M halos but
can be important for Mh  10135M halos at z  2
Nonetheless this predictive range is in remarkable agreement with constraints from Behroozi et al 2013c at z  1 and z  2
We nd it astonishing that the physical properties of galaxies three-quarters of the way back to the Big Bang are predictable
using observations of practically our own backyard The agreement at z  2 is not so good and it is worth understanding why the
relationship breaks down at higher redshifts In fact at low redshifts a simple pure power-law star formation efciency history
like that assumed in Eq 2 is only a reasonable description for low-mass galaxiesie galaxies with masses less than 10105M
in halos with masses less than 1012M Predictions for high-mass galaxies work because their specic star formation rates are
low As long as the predicted specic star formation rates are less than the inverse Hubble time huge relative errors no longer
matter the buildup of the galaxy stellar mass from z  2 to z  0 will be only small fraction of the total see also Eq 7 However
at z  2 many of the massive galaxies today were forming most of their stars Behroozi et al 2013c and the growth of galaxies
relative to their halos was much faster eg Fig 4 Getting the magnitude of the specic star formation rates correct therefore
becomes more important and the simple extrapolation in Eq 2 breaks down
B CALIBRATING MASS ACCRETION RATES
We calculate halo mass accretion rates from the growth of halos between discrete simulation timesteps As usual if the
timesteps are spaced too closely halo growth will be small relative to measurement errors eg Poisson noise and halo nding
algorithm instabilities If the timesteps are too far apart the halo growth rate will change over the time interval and the inferred
rates will be biased To work around this problem we adopt a parametrized tting function for the average halo growth rate
In this way the inferred halo growth between any two redshifts can be checked for consistency with direct measurements from
simulations
The choice of tting function is important since we are modeling halo growth over large redshift ranges eg z  8 to z  15
Common tting forms eg Wechsler et al 2002 McBride et al 2009 Wu et al 2013 approximate the early growth of halos
as exponential in redshift While not a bad approximation at a single halo mass halos at different masses will have different
exponential growth rates Since larger halos form later their growth proles are better t by steeper exponential growth rates
Wechsler et al 2002 McBride et al 2009 extrapolating this faster growth to high redshifts results in the progenitor mass
histories of high-mass halos unphysically falling below the progenitor mass histories of lower-mass halos
Behroozi et al 2013c avoid this problem by tting the growth history of halos at a single mass 1013M with a standard

Figure 17 Test of the methodology in 21 at low redshifts The top-left panel shows the stellar masshalo mass SMHM ratio for z  01 derived in
Reddick et al 2013 by pure abundance matching ie considering a single redshift only compared to the SMHM ratio in Behroozi et al 2013c derived by
abundance modeling 32 The middle-left panel shows the specic star formation rates from Salim et al 2007 as a function of halo mass using Reddick et al
2013 to convert between stellar mass and halo mass along with specic halo mass accretion rates as a function of halo mass Appendix B The bottom-left
panel shows the same data except this time plotted as a function of stellar mass The top-right panel compares the Behroozi et al 2013c constraints on the
SMHM ratio at z  1 black line to predictions for the z  1 SMHM ratio using the z  01 Reddick et al 2013 SMHM ratio and the Salim et al 2007 SSFRs
with the methodology in 21 red line The blue line shows the predictions if the Salim et al 2007 SSFRs are not corrected for passive stellar mass loss 22
The middle-right and bottom-right panels show the analogous comparisons at z  2 and z  3 As explained in the text the assumption of a power-law historical
SMHM relation for galaxies at z  01 breaks down at z  2 and above

where MM0z gives the median virial mass Bryan  Norman 1998 for progenitors of halos with mass M0 at z  0
Since we are interested in average accretion rates instead of the growth of the median halo mass we cannot use the values
directly from this function However rather than re-tting all the parameters we consider simple modications to the time
derivative of this function

BEHROOZI  SILK
where M0Mpeaka is the inverse function of MmedM0a ie MmedM0Mpeakaa  Mpeak
To compare with simulations we have measured the following proxy for specic mass accretion rate for every halo in Bolshoi
for every timestep redshift z
Mpeakz - Mpeakz  05
Mpeakztz -
tz  05
where tz is the time since the Big Bang at redshift z Calculating mass growth over a redshift delta of 05 ensures a typical
halo growth of 0125 dex which is well beyond the typical 15 mass uctuations expected for halo nder mass recovery
Behroozi et al 2013e When a timestep at exactly z 05 was not available we used the closest timestep available Bolshoi has
180 timesteps which are spaced between 40-90 Myr apart so this granularity becomes important at z  4
For each trial parameter set in Eq B8 we calculated the expected values for  as a function of halo mass and redshift We nd
that the following formula for average mass accretion rates is the best match to the Bolshoi simulation

We show a comparison between this formulas expected values for  and the actual values in Bolshoi as a function of halo mass
and redshift in the left panel of Fig 18 The tting-formulas typical deviations are 23 from the measured values
We have also checked this formula against two newer simulations Bolshoi-Planck uses a cosmology M  0307   0693
h  068 8  0823 ns  096 similar to the Planck best-t cosmology Planck Collaboration et al 2013 This simulation used
the same box size 250 Mpc h- 1 particle number 20483 force resolution 1 kpc h- 1 and simulation code ART as Bolshoi
As noted in 532 this cosmologys specic mass accretion rates are expected to be about 2 different from that of the Bolshoi
simulation This expectation is borne out in Fig 18 right panel where the measured deviations from the tting formula in Eq
B8 are 45 We also used the Lb125 simulation to constrain the low-mass and high-redshift accretion rate behavior that is
not as well sampled by Bolshoi Lb125 uses a cosmology in between the Bolshoi and Bolshoi-Planck cosmologies M  0286
  0714 h  07 8  082 ns  096 This simulation used a smaller box size 125 Mpc h- 1 with the same particle number
20483 as Bolshoi but with slightly higher force resolution Plummer-equivalent of 05 kpc h- 1 and using the GADGET simulation
code Springel 2005 The smaller box size and consequent lack of larger-scale modes reduces average halo accretion rates at
xed halo mass to 90-95 of those in Bolshoi
C LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS
Since we use converted UV luminosity functions to constrain the growth of stellar mass at z  7 it is important to check that
the stellar mass growth we infer is self-consistent with the observed UV luminosity functions We follow the same procedure for
generating luminosities as in Behroozi et al 2014a specically we generate UV luminosity functions using the FSPS stellar
population synthesis code Conroy et al 2010 Conroy  Gunn 2010 and assume that the metallicity of stars produced follows
the extrapolated gas-phase metallicity as a function of stellar mass and redshift from Maiolino et al 2008 Dust represents a
signicant uncertainty however as the only practical method for inferring the dust content of individual galaxies at z  7 is to
use the UV slope  Bouwens et al 2014b We therefore show all results both with and without the effects of a Charlot  Fall
2000 dust model
UV luminosity functions at z  7 and z  8 generated from the best-t stellar growth models in Behroozi et al 2013c are
shown in the top panels of Fig 19 As suggested by the evolution of  with luminosity more luminous galaxies are likely dustier
than fainter galaxies Bouwens et al 2014b This seems in qualitative agreement with our generated luminosity functions as
the observations lie closer to the models including dust for bright galaxies and are closer to the models without dust for faint
galaxies
We have also generated apparent luminosity functions in several HST WFC3 F125W and F160W and JWST NIRCAM
F200WF444W lters from our predictions in 5 which appear in the bottom panels of Fig 19 If the dust-luminosity relation
extends to higher redshifts it is likely that the true luminosity functions will be closer to the models including dust for bright
galaxies and closer to the models without dust for faint galaxies However we caution that the systematic errors from uncer-
tainties in stellar mass growth histories are signicant these are 075 09 125 and 175 mag at z  96 108 125 and 15
respectively

Figure 19 Luminosity functions at z  7 Top panels predicted UV luminosity functions at z  7 and z  8 compared to those in Bouwens et al 2014c Dust is
