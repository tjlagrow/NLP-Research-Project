Abstract
This review aims to give a summary of our understanding of galaxy evolution as infered from
studies of nearby galaxies how observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope have con-
tributed signicantly to our detailed understanding of the older stellar populations in Local
Group dwarf galaxies Recent results from VLT are also promising interesting future prospects
for the study of resolved stellar populations in nearby dwarf galaxies
Introduction
How do galaxies form and then evolve over time This is one of the most fundamental questions
in astronomy and the answer has far reaching implications for the accurate interpretation of any
observations of galaxies throughout the Universe Galaxies are the end products of all the star
formation in their entire lifetimes and the ratios of chemical elements and remaining stellar pop-
ulation provide evidence for this past star formation Only if we understand how galaxies change
with time and especially how they may look when they are young can we use them to accurately
understand what we see in galaxy surveys at high-redshift because otherwise we dont know which
type of galaxies we may be viewing There are currently numerous techniques available to uncover
information buried in the properties of individual stars
It will make a signicant dierence in
the interpretation of galaxy surveys if they preferentially detect populations of star-bursting dwarf
galaxies - which do not trace the mass distribution in the universe - or if the galaxies we detect are
massive spirals or ellipticals which do We thus have to understand how dierent types of galaxies
evolve so we are able to distinguish their progenitors in redshift surveys
It must be fair to assume that all the galaxies we see today in and around our Local Group are
broadly representative our region of space is neither over-dense a cluster environoment nor under-
dense in a void All nearby galaxies have doubtless been forming and evolving for a signicant
fraction of the age of the Universe If this were not true it would mean that our local region of
space is in some way peculiar and there is no evidence for this Thus as new techniques and
instruments enable us to determine more and more accurate star formation histories for nearby
galaxies over 90 of the lifetime of the Universe we can hope to obtain a representative picture of
galaxy evolution from our local neighbourhood and with it the ability to predict what galaxies look
like at all redshifts Detailed studies of nearby galaxies will thus provide an independent method
to compare with redshift survey predictions
It is apparent that some galaxies have a more or less constant global star formation rate through
time eg spirals and some appear to be subject to sudden intense bursts of star formation eg
irregulars and then some stopped forming stars entirely at some point in the past eg ellipticals
Filling in the crucial details of this basic scenario requires the detailed analysis of the fossil record
of ancient star formation

Aquarius b Phoenix and c Cetus and as a comparison d the globular cluster Ruprecht 106
which resulted from UT1FORS1 imaging in August 1999 in exceptional seeing conditions Tolstoy
et al 2000 Representative error bars are also plotted for each data set These data have not been
corrected for any reddening eects From the Ruprecht 106 data a ducial mean was found for the
RGB and HB This is then over-plotted on each of the dwarf galaxy CMDs
Imaging Star-Formation Rate Evolution
The most detailed information on how a galaxy has evolved in time comes from measuring the
star-formation rate as a function of time or the star formation history SFH and the most direct
and unambiguous method of doing this comes from interpreting CMDs of a signicant fraction of
the individual stars in a galaxy This is a plot of the temperature versus the luminosity of all the
stars bright enough to be detected in a galaxy in the observed quantities of colour and magnitude
see Figure 1 Because of our detailed understanding of stellar properties these measurements can
be converted into physical parameters such as age or SFH chemical composition and enrichment
history initial mass function environment and dynamical history of a system Some of these
parameters are strongly correlated such as chemical composition and age since successive gener-
ations of stars may be progressively enriched in the heavier elements Thus detailed numerical
simulations of CMD morphology are necessary to disentangle the complex eects of dierent stellar
populations overlying each other and make an eective quantitative analysis of possible SFHs To
Figure 2 Here we show two examples of UT1FORS1 low-resolution spectra of the Ca II triplet
region of two red giant stars in the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxies observed in
August 1999 Tolstoy et al 2001 They both lie at the opposite extremes of Ca II triplet line
widths measured in our sample For display purposes the spectra have been normalized to their
continuum level and then arbitrarily shifted The upper spectrum is of star c2-838 in Fornax with
a calcium triplet metallicity of FeH 127 and the lower spectrum is of star o1-1 in Sculptor
with FeH 230 They both have good SN with 30 in the upper spectrum and 20 in the
lower Also shown here is the sky spectrum This shows that although this region of the spectrum
is relatively free of bright sky lines the weaker Ca II triplet line at 8498A is more likely to be
aected by sky lines than the other two
this end There have been numerous recent developments in crowded eld photometry techniques
and advanced methods of interpreting highly populous and detailed CMDs from nearby galaxies
eg Tosi et al 1991 Tolstoy  Saha 1996 Aparicio et al 1996 Dolphin 1997 Dohm-Palmer et
al 1997 Hernandez et al 1999 Harris  Zaritsky 2001
The exquisite stable high spatial resolution combined with photometric accuracy of images
from the Hubble Space Telescope HST have allowed us to probe further back into the history
of star formation of a large variety of dierent galaxy types with widely diering star formation
properties and extend our studies out to the edges of the Local Group and beyond with greater
accuracy than ever before We have learnt several important things about dwarf galaxy evolution
from these studies Firstly we have found that no two galaxies have identical star formation
histories some galaxies may supercially look the same today but they have invariably followed
a dierent paths to this point Now that we have managed to probe deep into the star formation
history of dwarf irregular galaxies in the Local Group it is obvious that there are a number of
similarities in their global properties with those of dwarf ellipticalspheroidal type galaxies which
were previously thought to be quite distinct However the ellipticalspeheroidals tend to have
one or more discrete episodes of star formation through-out their history and dwarf irregulars are
characterised by quasi-continuous star-formation The previous strong dichotomy between these
two classes has been weakened by these new results and may stem from the dierences in the
environment in which these similar mass galaxies were born into or have inhabited for most of their

Figure 3 Here we show a small region of four UT2UVES high-resolution spectra observed in
August 2000 and January 2001 of stars in Sculptor and Carina dwarf spheroidals and one of a
comparison star in metal-poor globular cluster M 55 Tolstoy Venn Shetrone Hill Primas Kaufer
 Szeifert in prep Here we can see lines from Ca I 61222 Fe I 61366 61377 and Ba II
61417 Clearly both Carina and Sculptor exhibit a range of abundance variation within their
stellar population and there are also interesting dierence between the two galaxies
3 Spectroscopy Metallicity Evolution
If we want to understand the detailed chemical enrichment of galaxies by their constituent stars
we need to accurately measure the relative abundances of a range of dierent elements in high
resolution spectra To date most metallicity determinations for stars in nearby galaxies and there
arent many have been derived either from single chemical element studies from low resolution
spectra see Figure 2 or from broad-band photometry and these are at best simple estimates
Thus in spite of considerable eorts with 4m class telescopes many of the most basic questions
remain unanswered for most of the Local Group galaxies What is the total range in FeH for
stars within a galaxy Does the FeH match that of the Milky Way halo populations Globular
clusters or eld stars Do the elemental ratios particularly Fe and r- and s- processFe
ratios in nearby systems track those seen in the metal poor eld or in the globular clusters
Results from high resolution spectra taken with HIRES at the Keck Observatory have started
to answer these detailed questions about the enrichment history of a variety of dierent elements
within galaxies other than our own eg Shetrone et al 1998 Shetrone et al 2001 Venn et al
2001 The new ESO Very Large Telescope VLT observatory on Paranal in Chile consists of four
8m diameter mirror telescopes and a slew of modern instrumentation The large collecting area
and the high resolution spectrograph UVES allows us amongst other things to spectroscopically
determine the abundances of a large variety of elements for individual stars eg Hill et al 2000
Primas et al 2000 Recent results of UVES spectroscopy of stars of known age in a dwarf galaxy
CMD are shown in Figure 3 By looking at galaxies outside our own we gain the advantages
of perspective and thus we have a better chance to build up a complete picture of metallicity
variations over time The most interesting stars to get a large range in age are faint enough in
external galaxies to require an 8m telescope Including chemical evolution history in CMD analysis
will result in a signicant improvement in our understanding of how galaxies evolve
For example rather than just measuring a single present day end-product abundance of an
element we can select individual stars of dierent ages from imaging data and measure how the
enrichment of many dierent elements has varied with time This means we can measure how the
chemical composition of the interstellar medium the basic building material for future stellar pop-
ulations is altered by successive generations of stars Deep precision multi-colour photometry in
combination with spectroscopic metallicity measurements of the individual stars in external galaxies
can uniquely determine the star formation histories of nearby galaxies going back many giga-years
These studies make clear the potential of deeper data from VLT and new HST instruments for a
range of galaxy types
4 Prospects for the future
We are currently apparently in the embarrassing situation of at least claiming to understand
the properties of distant high-redshift galaxies better than those in the nearby Universe It is only
with the arrival of large telescopes with excellent image quality and high through-put spectrographs
that we can start to make really detailed comparisons between the properties of distant and nearby
galaxies This is because the individual low mass old stars in the nearby universe which formed
when the Universe was young at high redshift are faint Thus to see them in galaxies external to
our own requires at least an 8m class telescope
There are a number of ways in which the current interpretation of CMDs can be dramatically
improved One is more and deeper CMDs of a larger sample of nearby galaxies It is still most
ecient to use HST to obtain deep CMDs to study the old main sequence turnos but large scale
surveys down the magnitude of the Horizontal Branch can better be carried out with ground-based
telescopes such as the VLT see Figure 1 When galaxies are satellites of our own Milky Way
they are typically close enough that excellent results can best be achieved using wide eld imagers
on 2m class telescopes eg MPAESO22m WFI on La Silla or the INTWFC on La Palma of
which there have been some nice results shown at this conference I believe that the most important
contributions will come from continuing the eort to improve our ability to interpret the details in
CMDs There will be signicant progress when we have measured abundances of a large variety of
elements for stars of known age for individual stars in a CMD
The observed redshift distribution of faint galaxies detected in deep UVoptical imaging surveys
has been assumed to trace the star formation history of the Universe eg Madau et al 1996
Lilly et al 1996 The majority of these galaxies are at intermediate redshift z  1 late
type intrinsically small and undergoing a strong burst of star formation This means that the
nearby Universe the Local Group must contain clearly identiable remnants from this relatively
recent epoch  5  8 Gyr before present ie corresponding to z  051 when the peak in
the universal star formation rate is predicted to occur Initial comparisons suggest that studies of
nearby galaxies do not yield the same SFH as is inferred from optical redshift surveys eg Tolstoy
1998 However the best present day candidates for this intermediate redshift galaxy population
are the extremely numerous but presently faint dwarf irregular galaxies which have not yet been
studied in sucient detail It is also true to say that although we know that nearby spirals and
especially ellipticals have very large old stellar populations it is dicult to be very precise beyond
about 8  10 Gyr ago corresponding to a redshift range z 1  2 with current data This is all
going to change dramatically with large telescopes and more sensitive instruments Sub-mmradio
wavelength surveys are also pointing to SFHs very dierent from those implied by optical data
eg Blain et al 1999 and these surveys suggest a much larger type of galaxy eg ellipticals
which are typically at higher redshift z  2
A complete survey of the resolved stellar populations in the local Universe will accurately trace
star formation variations within both large and small galaxies and determine if and when bursts
of star formation occur and how long they last It might well be that optical redshift surveys are
strongly biased towards low mass dwarf irregular galaxies undergoing short bursts of star formation
and that they are thus not accurate indicators of the dominant mode by mass of star formation
in the Universe which occurs in much larger galaxies
The more detailed is our understanding of star formation processes and their eect on galaxy
evolution in the nearby Universe the better we will understand the results from studies of the
integrated light of galaxies in the high-redshift Universe
