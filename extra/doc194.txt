ABSTRACT
The inuence of under-dense environments on the formation and evolution of galaxies is studied by analysing
the photometric properties of  200 galaxies residing in voids taken from our SDSS DR10 void catalog up to
z  0055 We split void galaxies into two subsamples based on the luminosity density contrast of their host
voids sparse void s    095 and populous void p    087 We nd that galaxies in sparse
voids are less massive than galaxies in populous voids The luminosity distribution of galaxies in populous
voids follows the same distribution observed across the SDSS survey in the same redshift range Galaxies in
the sparse voids are also bluer suggesting that they may be going through a relatively slow and continuous
star formation Additionally we nd that the luminosity function of galaxies in populous voids is represented
with the Schechter function whereas the same does not hold for sparse voids Our analysis suggests that
the properties of a host void plays a signicant role in the formation and evolution of the void galaxies and
determining the large scale evolution of voids is an important step to understand what processes regulate the
evolution of galaxies

1 INTRODUCTION
One of the main outstanding problems in observational
cosmology is to understand how galaxy properties are inu-
enced by their environments and evolve with cosmic time
For instance in over-dense regions groupsclusters distinct
mechanisms such as tidal force ram pressure stripping and
harassment play a fundamental role in galaxy star forma-
tion rate color and morphology eg Veilleux et al 2005
Kormendy et al 2009 By incorporating these quenching
mechanisms galaxies in higher density regions tend to be red-
der and earlier type have lower star formation rate and are
more strongly clustered Some of these trends might lead
to the well-known morphology-density relation Dressler
1980 In addition to these baryonic processes there are other
mechanism that can change the properties of the galaxies in
dierent environments The relation between dark matter per-
turbations in background and the distribution of dark mat-
ter halos that host galaxies which is known as the halo
bias parameter play a crucial role in the properties and mass
distribution of the galaxies To understand the inuence
of environment on galaxy formation most of the previous
studies have focused on the properties of galaxies in high-
density regions eg Scarlata et al 2007 Bower et al 2008
and few studies have focused on eld and void galaxies eg
Pustilnik et al 2002 Rojas et al 2004 Goldberg et al 2005
Hoyle et al 2005 2012 Kreckel et al 2012 Pan et al 2012
In this letter we consider the other extreme case and study the
inuence of environment on galaxies which reside mainly in
the under-dense or void regions Since there are no complex
processes such as close encounters and galaxy mergers in void
regions void galaxies are excellent probes of the eect of en-
vironment and cosmology on structure formation and galaxy
evolution
Early spectral and photometric studies of void galax-
they are statistically bluer have
ies have shown that
a later morphological type and higher specic star for-
mation rates than galaxies in average-density environ-
ments Rojas et al 2004 2005 Patiri et al 2006

lation can provide valuable information on void regions

In this study we focus on the photometric properties of void
galaxies in various under-dense regions drawn from Sloan
Digital Sky Survey SDSS DR10 We use 1014 void galax-
ies which reside in 167 voids that are characterized by their
luminosity density contrasts
An important question is whether the formation of void
galaxies is in anyway determined by the properties of the
host voids We attempt to address this issue by separating
the void galaxies located in more under-dense regions which
we refer to as sparse voids from those that reside in denser
regions referred to as populous voids We dene sparse void
s    095 and populous void p    087 the mo-
tivation for which is discussed in the Section 3 We describe
the observational data and sample selection in Section 2 The
properties of the void galaxies are discussed in Section 3 A
summary and concluding remarks are presented in section 4
Throughout this paper we assume a at CDM cosmol-
ogy and adopt following cosmological parameters the Hub-
ble parameter H70 km s1 Mpc1 and the matter density

2 SAMPLE SELECTION
To study the eect of under-dense environment on for-
mation and evolution of void galaxies we use a catalog of
voids extracted from a volume-limited spectroscopic sample
of SDSS DR10 Ahn et al 2014 using the method described
in Tavasoli et al 2013
The boundaries of the selected region of SDSS are 135 
RA  235 and 0  DEC  55 which contains  66000
galaxies with a limiting r-band magnitude of mrpetrosian 
1777 up to z  0055
The redshift of all selected galaxies are corrected for the
motion of the local group and are given in the CMB rest-
Furthermore the k-corrections of SDSS galaxies
are carried out using the kcorrect algorithm developed by
Blanton et al 2003 and Blanton  Roweis 2007 In order
to produce a homogeneous sample of data suitable for the sta-
tistical study of void galaxies we take a volume-limited sam-
ple in the redshift range 0010  z  0055 The upper limit
for the redshift is dened by the limiting magnitude Mr  -19
and leaves  40000 galaxies in the nal sample To extract
a void catalog from our SDSS spectroscopic sample we ap-
ply the void nder algorithm introduced by Aikio  Mahonen
1998 which does not require voids to be spherical
Prior to applying this void nding algorithm we classied
wall and eld galaxies based on the distance to the nearest
neighbor Hoyle  Vogeley 2002 Whereas eld galaxies are
candidate as void galaxies the AM algorithm starts on the
cartesian gridded wall galaxy sample by dening a distance
eld To assign each element in the grid sample to a subvoid
we employed the climbing algorithm Schmidt et al 2001
Finally if the distance between two subvoids is less than both
distance elds they will be joined into a larger void The void
volume was estimated using the number of grid points inside
a given void multiplied by the volume associated with the grid
cellsee Tavasoli et al 2013 for further algorithm details
The generated void catalog includes variety of voids in size
Rv and luminosity density contrast v The luminosity density
contrast of a void is dened by v  v  mm where v
Tavasoli et al
is given by the ratio of the total luminosity of galaxies inside
a given void by the volume of that void and m is mean lu-
minosity density of the volume-limited sample Hereafter for
simplicity we use density contrast instead of luminosity den-
sity contrast For each void we dened its eective radius Rv
as the radius of a sphere whose volume is equal to that of the
void In order to avoid counting spurious voids in our catalog
the size of voids should be larger than Rv  7 Mpc Our nal
catalog contains 167 voids within which 1014 void galaxies
brighter than -19 reside
3 RESULTS
In this section we describe general properties of the void
galaxies that reside in various under-dense regionsThe main
aim is to nd a connection between the evolution of void
galaxies and density contrast of voids To characterize the en-
vironment of void galaxies we attribute the density contrast of
each void to all galaxies residing in that void Fig 1 presents
the distribution of the density contrast associated with 1014
void galaxies identied in 167 voids
The distribution has a mean of   091 with a standard
deviation of 004 shown with dotted and dashed lines respec-
tively
Fig 1 shows that the under-dense regions where
void galaxies reside have dierent density contrasts In order
to explore the eect of under-dense regions on the evolution
of void galaxies we dene two subclasses of void galaxies
according to the density contrast of their host voids sparse
void s    095 and populous void p    087
The two classes are dened after rejecting all galaxies within
1 around the mean contrast density Hereafter we refer to
them as s-sample and p-sample for simplicity which repre-
sent the void galaxies in sparse and populous voidsThere are
110 and 111 galaxies in our s-sample and p-sample located
inside 38 and 25 voids respectively Based on the denition
of void sphericity as given by Tavasoli et al 2013 the s- and
p-voids have average sphericity of 071 and 069 respectively
with the standard deviation of 006 for both samples Hence
there is no dierence between the shape of the voids in two
samples However the median size of the voids in s-sample
13 Mpc h1 is  3 Mpc h1 larger than that of p-sample The
latter will eect the normalisation of the luminosity function
see Fig 4 In the following subsections we compare photo-
metric properties luminosity color and luminosity function
of void galaxies in s- and p-samples to trace the eect of var-
ious cosmic environment
31 Luminosity
Absolute luminosity is a ne tracer of the total mass of
galaxies Hence to study the distribution of masses of void
galaxies we use their luminosity as a proxy Unlike over-
dense regions it is expected that the probability of nding
massive halos in void region to be small Lack of merger
events can be a logical explanation of such observations
Fig 2 presents the distribution of the r-band absolute mag-
nitude of void galaxies measured from Petrosian magnitude
Petrosian 1976 The s- and p-samples are drawn using solid
and dashed lines respectively As it can be seen galaxies in
the s-sample have a distribution peaked at  -195 with few
galaxies brighter than  -21 On the contrary the p-sample
shows a broader distribution that extends to  -22 There-
fore voids of higher density contrasts can host signicantly
brighter presumably more massive galaxies than those of
lower density counterpart Using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
KS test we nd that the probability of the two samples to be

samples respectively The dotted line presents the distribution for our par-
ent sample obtained by a Monte Carlo simulation and the errorbars are the

drawn from the same parent distribution is negligible zero
Hence the dierence between the two samples reported here
is statistically signicant We further check how dierent
are these two samples in comparison with our parent sam-
ple 39750 galaxies from which we have extracted our void
catalog This exercise will demonstrate how the void galaxy
luminosity distribution may dier from the luminosity distri-
bution of galaxies across the local universe as a whole To do
so we try a Monte Carlo analysis as following 1 randomly
choose 110 galaxies out of 39750 2 calculating number of
galaxies in each magnitude bin 3 repeating steps 1 and 2
1000 times 4 and nally nding the mean and standard de-
viation of the 1000 numbers in each bin We have chosen 110
galaxies at step 1 to keep the same number of galaxies as
those of s- or p-sample The mean and standard deviation ob-
tained in each bin are shown as dashed-dotted histogram and
errorbars in Fig 2 This analysis shows that the p-sample
closely follows the parent distribution Running a KS test we
nd more than 80 probability that parent and p-sample to
have the same distribution
In stark contrast parent and s-
sample present a very dierent magnitude distributions with a
zero percent KS test probability
Existence of massive object in p-sample might be due to
the hierarchical nature of structure formation andor high ef-
ciency of star formation in their progenitors This indicates
that the formation of void galaxies and their path of evolution
can strongly depend on their environmental properties Dis-
criminating between galaxies in various voids our results also
provide an interesting tool to test the prediction of cosmolog-
ical dark matter simulations and semi-analytical models
32 Color
The color of galaxies can be used to probe their dominant
stellar populations and star formation history Generally bluer
galaxies have younger stellar population in comparison with
red galaxies It is also known that blue galaxies are dominated
by late types while the red galaxies are dominated by early
types eg Strateva et al 2001
Within the hierarchical framework of CDM galaxies as-
Fig 3 The g-r color distribution of sparse and populous void galaxies
are shown in solid and dashed lines respectively The K-S test shows that
the probability of two samples being drawn from similar distribution is only
about 0002 The dotted line presents the distribution for our parent sam-
ple obtained by a Monte Carlo simulation and the errorbars are the standard
deviation of each bin see text for description
semble their masses over time via dierent modes Depend-
ing on the physical processes and when they act on shaping
the galaxy the resulting stellar populations can become red-
der or remain blue through sustained star formation Since
processes like merging and gas accretion are important envi-
ronment can strongly regulate the evolution of galaxies This
picture demonstrates why galaxy environment appears to play
a key role in controlling the stellar population properties of
the galaxies and they are the product of a complex assembly
and environment history Observations of void galaxies se-
lected by dierent samples show that statistically they are gas
rich blue and late-type disk galaxies Rojas et al 2004 2005
Patiri et al 2006 Kreckel et al 2011b Kreckel et al 2012
Herewe investigate the color dierences between void
galaxies in the sparse and populous samplesThis approach
allows us to see how galaxy color depends on properties
of host voids 
To do so we use the model color
g  r which is derived from the SDSS model magnitudes
For each galaxy these are derived from the best tting de
Vaucouleur de Vaucouleurs 1948 or exponential proles
Freeman 1970 Fig 3 shows the color distribution of void
galaxies in the range of  02  09 Although both distri-
butions have a wide range of colors a bimodality is clearly
visible The s- and p-sample present single peak around
g  r  04 blue and 08 red respectively Repeating the
same Monte Carlo analysis as that in section 33 we nd a
30 probability that parent and p-sample to be drawn from
the same distribution dotted histogram in Fig 3
Although the star formation history of a galaxy is a function
of stellar mass the g  r distribution of void galaxies might
include a real evolutionary eect caused by the dependence
of the red and blue void galaxy on the density contrast of a
In other words regions with dierent initial cosmo-
logical density elds might result in dierent galaxy popula-
tionsnamely active or passive

One of the key statistical tools to study the galaxy distri-
bution is the luminosity function LF One can describe the
global properties of galaxy populations and study the forma-
tion and evolution of galaxies through the LF To understand
how galaxies form we also need to understand how the LF de-
pends on the environment The inuence of the local environ-
ment on the LF from over-dense to under-dense regions su-
perclustervoid has been investigated by several authors eg
Barkhouse et al 2007 Bai et al 2009 Robotham et al 2010
Zandivarez  Martnez 2011 Although there are many LF
studies using dierent samples and approaches at dierent
redshifts eg Johnston 2011 the majority of them are related
to galaxies in over-dense regions Not many have explored the
LF of void galaxies Hoyle et al 2005 It is not yet clear how
the LF of void galaxies depends on the properties of their host
Here we use s- and p-sample to study the LF of void galax-
ies in dierent voids taking the eect of density contrast into
account In Fig 4 we show the LF of s- and p-sample in
the r-band Petrosian magnitude as squared symbols with error
bars We describe the LFs using Schechter function Schechter
1976 which has the following shape
L  LL exp LL
where   L and  are the three parameters to t The best t-
ting LF for dierent samples are shown in Fig 4 where the pa-
rameters are given in Table 1 Clearly the LF of s-sample does
not follow a Schechter function This can also be inferred
from the large errors in the M parameters The large error
in the M indicate the insensitivity of the LF of the s-sample
to this parameters Further because the t passes through 1-
 of all points the LF of this sample follows a power-law
Fitting a pure power-law we nd a power-law index of  
215  021 with a reduced  054 and While the  of
power-law is smaller than that of Schechter  070 but the
power index of both are consistent within the errors The LF
of all void galaxies as well as that of p-sample are well tted
with the Schechter The relatively large error in M of the p-
sample is due to the large errors in its LF which caused by the
number statistics
There are clear dierences between the LF of s- and p-
sample which is mainly due to the lack of bright galaxies in
the sparse sample Moreover while the LF of the p-sample
follows a Schechter function it seems like a power-law for
the s-sample Gaussian and double Schechter have been alter-
natively used to describe the LF of galaxies Even a cursory
look at the LF of s-sample shows a Gaussian would not t
it Further tting a double Schechter which has 6 parameters
in the current LF does not seem to be statistically reasonable
Hence the available data does not allow us to further inves-
tigate it the detailed dierences in the shapes of the LF for
the two void galaxy samples implies that the possible variety
of formation andor evolution mechanisms are a function of
galaxy density even among obvious voids
4 DISCUSSION
In this paper we have studied the photometric properties
of void galaxies based on void catalog on SDSS DR10 at
z  0010  0055 Our void catalog consists of a large va-
riety of voids from small to large and encompasses a range
in density contrast from low to high population
In order
to investigate how the density contrast of voids aects the
evolution of void galaxies we dene two subsample of void
galaxies which are located in sparse and populous voids Our
results indicate that the two populations show systematic dif-
ferences in photometric properties such as luminosity color
distribution and the luminosity function While the luminos-
ity distribution of galaxies in populous voids follows the lu-
minosity distribution of the general population of galaxies in
SDSS within 0010  z  0055 the luminosity distribution
of galaxies in sparse voids show that they are generally dim-
mer Also the colors of galaxies residing in sparse voids are
bluer and the galaxy generally less luminous indicating that
they are likely to have low but sustained rates of inecient
star formation throughout their evolution
Furthermore the LF of galaxies in sparse voids do not fol-
low a Schechter function seen in the populous void galaxies
In this letter we have shown clear indications that the voids
with dierent density contrasts also host dierent galaxy pop-
ulationsWhat is also quite interesting is the similarity be-
tween the properties luminosity color and LF of galaxies
in populous voids and the general population of galaxies in
the local universe It is not unimaginable that sparse voids
could be the least evolved voids in the context of hierarchical
structure formation Sheth  van de Weygaert 2004 Based
on this indicative study one could argue that populous voids
contain a mixed population of galaxies which might be the
consequence of mergers among voids contrary to the sparse
voids which seem to present a more homogeneous galaxy
population
The purpose of this study was to highlight the important
role of the density contrast specially at the extreme low den-
sity environments of the voids s-sample Now having shown
that the properties of galaxies depend on whether or not a void
is sparse or populous in a non-trivial way it is important to de-
termine why some voids are sparse and some are populous to
truely understand how environmental density aects galaxy
evolution and what processes regulate this evolution
