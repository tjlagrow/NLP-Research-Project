In this paper we discuss the chemical evolution of elliptical
Abstract
galaxies and its consequences on the evolution of the intracluster medium
ICM We use chemical evolution models taking into account dark matter
halos and compare the results with previous models where dark matter
was not considered In particular we examine the evolution of the abun-
dances of some relevant heavy elements such as oxygen magnesium and
iron and conclude that models including dark matter halos and an initial
mass function IMF containing more massive stars than the Salpeter
1955 IMF better reproduce the observed abundances of Mg and Fe
both in the stellar populations and in the ICM ASCA results We also
discuss the origin of gas in galaxy clusters and conclude that most of it
should have a primordial origin
Introduction
The properties of elliptical galaxies are not easy to study since we can measure
only their integrated properties which contain information on several stellar pop-
ulations of stars with dierent ages and metallicity Unfortunately the eects
of age and metallicity upon colors and metallicity indices are dicult to dis-
entangle Detailed models of chemical evolution and population synthesis are
therefore necessary to solve this degeneracy
What we currently know about the properties of elliptical galaxies can be
summarized as follows most of them seem to be among the oldest objects in
the universe containing old red stars although some recent studies Faber et
al 1995 seem to indicate that ellipticals are not all coeval This is at variance
with fact that elliptical galaxies dene a fundamental plane which constrains the
mass to luminosity ratio a quantity sensitive to the age of stellar populations
to have a scatter less than 16 for ellipticals in rich clusters Faber et al 1987
This fact argues in favor of the ellipticals being all coeval Renzini 1995
Ellipticals follow the well known color-magnitude relation in the sense that
their colors become redder with increasing luminosity and metallicity Faber
1972 The average metallicity of these objects appears to be solar or higher
Weiss et al 1995 thus indicating that they have undergone a fast and intense
star formation history perhaps interrupted by the occurrence of galactic winds
Finally another constraint to models of chemical evolution of ellipticals
arguing for them to be old systems is the measured SN rate These galaxies
have only SNe of Type Ia which are believed to originate from old stars namely
white dwarfs in binary systems
Metallicity indeces of Fe and Mg seem to indicate an overabundance of
-elements relative to iron in the nuclei of elliptical galaxies and that this over-
abundance increases with galactic luminosity On the other hand the MgFe
ratio seems to be constant inside the same galaxy Worthey et al 1992 Carollo
and Danziger 1994 thus indicating that the gradients of Mg and Fe inside the
galaxies are roughly the same The existence of such gradients seems to be now
well established Carollo et al 1993 and clearly indicates that some dissipative
processes have occurred during the formation of ellipticals
Elliptical galaxies are also known to have large halos of gas emitting in the
X-ray band These halos represent an indirect indication that these galaxies
should contain extended dark matter halos Other indications of the existence
of such halos comes from HI kinematics planetary nebulae gravitational lens-
ing and dynamical studies see Carollo et al 1995 and references therein The
abundances measured by ASCA in the X-ray emmitting gas indicate a very low
iron abundance in disagreement with the results from stellar populations How-
ever the derivation of abundances from the X-ray spectra is still aected by
many uncertainties as recently discussed by Arimoto et al 1996 Another re-
sult from ASCA inuencing the evolution of ellipticals concerns the abundances
derived for the ICM in galaxy clusters They indicate a clear overabundance of
-elements relative to iron in the ICM Mushotzky 1994 This result is rel-
evant to the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies since they are the major
contributors to the enrichment of the ICM as we will see in the next sections
2 The standard model of chemical evolution
The model we are going to discuss has been developed rst in Matteucci and
Tornambe 1987 and subsequently rened in Matteucci 1992 Matteucci and
Gibson 1995 and Gibson and Matteucci 1997 where a detailed description
can be found We will only remind here that it belongs to the category of
the supernovae SNe-driven galactic wind models In this model ecient star
formation leads to the development of a galactic wind once the thermal energy
of the gas due to the energy injection from SNe and stellar winds is equal or
larger than the binding energy of the gas The star formation is assumed to
stop after the occurrence of the galactic wind and the galaxy evolves passively
thereafter During this stage the only active process is the restoration of gas from
the stars into the interstellar medium ISM The only active SNe in this phase
are the Type Ia which continue exploding until the present time in agreement
with the observational evidence The model includes the most recent ideas on
SN progenitors and nucleosynthesis indicating that SNe Ia originate from long
living stars whereas SNe of Type II originate from short living stars Type Ia
SNe are believed to produce roughly  06M of Fe and the SNe of Type II
roughly  01M of Fe The so-called -elements O Mg Ne Si etc are
thought to be preferentially formed in Type II SNe
21 Basic equations
We follow the evolution of the abundances of 13 chemical elements as described
in Matteucci and Gibson 1995
The initial mass function m is assumed to be constant in time and
expressed as a power law We explore several prescriptions for the IMF a
Salpeter 1955 b Arimoto and Yoshii 1987 and c Kroupa et al 1993
The star formation rate is assumed to be simply proportional to the volume
gas density through a constant the star formation eciency This eciency is
constant in time but is assumed to vary with the galactic mass in the sense
that the eciency decreases when the total mass increases This is based on a
suggestion from Arimoto and Yoshii 1987 that the eciency of star formation
should be inversely proportional to the dynamical timescales This assumption
is not necessarily true since we could think that the star formation eciency
may increase with galactic mass as suggested by Tinsley and Larson 1979 and
Matteucci 1994 in the hypothesis of the formation of ellipticals by merging
of gaseous fragments According to these dierent assumptions on the star
formation eciency we can predict very dierent behaviours of the abundances
and abundance ratios as functions of galactic mass as we will see in the following
The binding energy of the gas is computed by assuming that elliptical galax-
ies possess heavy but diuse halos of dark matter and we follow the formulation
of Bertin et al 1992 According to these authors and Matteucci 1992 we
can write the binding energy of the gas as the sum of two terms one being the
binding energy of gas due to the luminous matter and the other the binding
energy of the gas due to the interaction between dark and luminous matter

where Mgas Mlum and Mdark are the mass of gas the mass of luminous matter
and the mass of the dark matter respectively The quantities rL and rD are
the half-light radius and the the radius of the dark matter core respectively In
the Bertin et al 1992 formulation the ratio rL
can vary in the interval 01
 045 The case with dark matter distributed like luminous matter although
unrealistic is represented by WLD  1
The total mass of the galaxy is dened as
which can be written as
Mtot  Mlum  Mdark
Mtot  1  RMlum
where R  Mdark
ponent
is the ratio between the mass of the dark and luminous com-
For the sake of simplicity we assume that every galaxy irrespective of its
luminous mass has R  10 and rL
 01 This means heavy but diuse halos
of dark matter The choice of relatively diused dark matter halos seems to
be appropriate for elliptical galaxies as shown by the models Matteucci 1992
and Matteucci and Gibson 1995 as well as by the lack of dynamical evidence
for dark matter inside one or two optical radii Carollo et al 1995 However
we do not exclude a possible variation of the amount andor concentration of
dark matter with galactic luminosity as it seems to be the case in spiral galaxies
Persic and Salucci 1988 Persic et al 1996 The possibility of such variations
has been already discussed by Renzini and Ciotti 1993 in order to explain the
properties of the fundamental plane for ellipticals
The thermal energy of the gas is calculated by considering both the SN and
stellar wind energy injection The contribution to the thermal energy of gas
from SNe is written as
EthSN  Z t
t  t
RSN tdt
where RSN t is the SN rate either Type I or II and SN t is the fraction of
the initial blast wave energy which is transferred into the ISM as thermal energy
is the explosion time For the particular form of SN t see Matteucci
and Gibson 1995 and Gibson and Matteucci 1997
The contribution to the thermal energy of the gas from stellar wind is
calculated according to Gibson 1994 and is written as
EthSW  Z t
W m t  t
When the total thermal energy of gas is equal or larger than its binding en-
ergy a galactic wind develops and lasts until this condition is reversed Whether
there is only an early wind episode or whether more episodes occur is a delicate
point and depends crucially on the balance between the eects of the potential
well and the injection of energy from stars Clearly the presence and distribu-
tion of dark matter plays a very important role in determining the onset and
the entity of galactic winds
3 Results for elliptical galaxies
For standard model described herein the star formation eciency decreases with
galactic mass This model predicts that more massive galaxies develop a galac-
tic wind later than the less massive ones the reason being that the potential
well depth increases with the total mass of the galaxy while the eciency of
star formation decreases This behaviour can change if one assumes that the
eciency of star formation is increasing with the total mass and one can obtain
the situation where the more massive galaxies develop a galactic wind before the
less massive ones Matteucci 1994 analysed this case and referred to it as the
inverse wind scenario The reason for requiring an inverse wind situation resides
in the fact that one cannot explain the increase of the MgFe ratio in the nuclei
of ellipticals as a function of galactic luminosity Worthey et al 1992 In fact
the standard model predicts exactly the opposite behaviour due to the winds
developing later in more massive ellipticals which drives the average MgFe
downward This downward trend results from the increased contribution of
Fe-donating Type Ia SNe in the more massive galaxies This behaviour is well
illustrated in Figure 1 where we show the predictions of the standard model
concerning the OFe ratio oxygen and magnesium should vary in lockstep in
the gas for model computed with dierent IMFs and dierent initial luminous
masses The times for the occurrence of the galactic wind is marked on each
curve From this gure it is easy to see that if the times for the occurrence of the
galactic wind become shorter and shorter with increasing galactic mass then the
average OFe would increase with galactic mass instead than decrease Another
possibility in order to obtain an inverse wind situation might be to vary the
amount andor the concentration of dark matter in a way such that the more
massive galaxies would have less andor less concentrated dark matter This
sounds like an interesting possibility although it has not yet been calculated
in detail since it seems to happen in spiral galaxies Persic and Salucci 1988
Persic et al 1996 and in dwarf spheroidal galaxies Kormendy 1990 From
this discussion it becomes evident how abundance ratios in stellar populations
and gas in ellipticals can be used to constrain the amount and concentration of
dark matter in these objects Another possibility however could be a variable
IMF from galaxy to galaxy In this case in fact one does not need to have an
inverse wind situation as shown in Matteucci 1994 This possibility has also
the advantage of reproducing the slight increase of the MLB ratio with galac-
tic mass Bender et al 1992 The variation of the IMF should be such that
more massive galaxies should have more massive stars relatively to less massive
galaxies
Finally a very important feature of Figure 1 is that independently of the
assumed IMF and time for the occurrence of a galactic wind a high OFe
ratio in the dominant stellar population is achieved only if the period of major
star formation has been short namely no longer than  3  108 years This is
a very strong conclusion since it implies a very fast process for the formation
of big ellipticals at variance with the hierarchical clustering scenario for galaxy
formation
Matteucci and Gibson 1995 calculated several models for ellipticals of
initial luminous mass in the range 10  109  20  1012M for the three IMF
cases a b and c One set of models was calculated with an increasing star
formation eciency Their results are shown in Table 1
All of these models contain the same prescriptions about dark matter The
interesting fact is that in all the models they found only early galactic winds and
this was mainly due to the presence of dark matter The epoch for the onset of

from several 107 years to several 108 years After the wind the galaxies evolve
passively just accumulating the gas restored by all the dying stellar populations

4 Contribution of the ellipticals to Fe and -elements of the ICM
Matteucci and Gibson 1995 derived power relationships between the ejected
masses M ej
i of gaschemical species and the nal galactic mass from the results
shown in Table 1 Then they integrated these ejected masses on the cluster
mass spectrum Schechter 1976 under the assumption that mainly ellipticals
and S0 galaxies contribute ejected gas to the ICM This assumption is generally
supported by the observational evidence that there is a clear correlation between
the total visual luminosity of the ellipticals in clusters and the total masses of
iron and gas measured in the X-ray band Arnaud 1994 However as we will see
in the next section there could be the possibility that dwarf galaxies previously
underestimated in clusters contribute non-negligibly to the total gas mass in
clusters The derived integrated masses together with the predicted OFe
SiFe and iron mass-to-light ratio for the clusters IMLR are shown in Table
2 Table 2 shows the results obtained for a typical rich and poor cluster All the
models are computed by assuming Ho  85 km sec1 Mpc1 with the exception
of the classic wind model with the Arimoto and Yoshii 1987 IMF where the
results for Ho  50 km sec1 Mpc1 second row of each case are also shown
One of the most relevant results shown in Table 2 is the total mass of gas
ejected from the ellipticals which is in all cases far less than observed indicating
that the majority of the ICM should have a primordial origin This conclusion
had already been reached by Matteucci and Vettolani 1988 but in this case
the discrepancy with the observed total gas masses is even stronger since due to
the presence of dark matter halos the galaxies do not eject all of their available
gas as it was the case in the Matteucci and Vettolani 1988 models Therefore
the presence of dark matter in galaxies has important consequences also for
the interpretation of the origin of the ICM as we will see even better in the
next section Another important result is the predicted OFe ratio in the
ICM Recent ASCA data suggest that OFe is high and positive 01  07
Mushotzky 1994 From Table 2 we can see that only models with a at IMF
case b can reproduce the observed values It is worth noting that the existence
of only early winds is also a necessary although not sucient condition to
achieve this situation
In fact if all the gas restored by stars is allowed to
eventually be lost the resulting OFe ratio in the ICM is low and negative as
a result of the continuous injection of Fe from SNe of Type Ia as it was the case
in Matteucci and Vettolani1988s model Abundance ratios in the ICM are
therefore an extremely useful and tight constraint to understand the evolution

of the abundances derived from the X-ray spectra whereas the situation is not
yet clear as already mentioned before
5 More on the source of the ICM gas
While the bright and intermediate part of the luminosity function of a cluster is
consistent with a slope   125  145 Ferguson and Sandage 1995 there
are recent indications that the faint-end slope MB  150 of the luminosity
function may be signicantly steeper   18  22 De Propris et al 1995
Trentham 1994 suggested that if the faint-end slope of the luminosity function
is taken into account we can explain all the gas in clusters as due to galaxies
and in particular to dwarfs
In particular in order to achieve this one has to assume that each galaxy
irrespective of its mass looses a fraction of its total mass luminousdark of
the order of   033 The range of galactic masses contributing to the gas being
104  1011M and the slope of the faint- end of the luminosity function being in
the range   14  17 Under these prescriptions he was able to account
for all the gas in clusters as due to galaxies but he predicted for dwarf galaxies
ML  L042027 not in very good agreement with the observational esti-
mate Kormendy 1990 in fact suggests that the exponent of this law for dwarf
galaxies is   013  031 This exponent  measures how rapidly dwarf
galaxies become dark matter dominated as their luminosity decreases Later
Nath and Chiba 1995 calculated more realistic  values varying with galactic
Figure 2

non-spiral- originating V-band cluster luminosity and the observed

mass and found that in order to explain all the gas in clusters as due to dwarfs
one needs to assume   17  19 thus obtaining a   055  037
totally outside the observed range Therefore they showed that more realistic
assumptions weaken the argument of Trentham 1994 Recently Gibson and
Matteucci 1997 extended the model for elliptical galaxies described before to
dwarf spheroidal galaxies included updated physical inputs and calculated the
total contribution to the gas and metal of the ICM from dwarf and giant el-
liptical galaxies These authors calculated also the photometric evolution see
Gibson 1996 for details of the considered galaxies in order to have a larger
number of constraints to compare with the results and took into account the
extreme case where all the gas produced by stars after the early wind phase
is eventually lost They found that the simple suggestion of Trentham 1994
about the amount of mass which should be ejected by each galaxy is extremely
unrealistic In order to reproduce realistic galaxies namely with the right colors
and luminosities they found   004  008 They used a slope for the faint
end of the luminosity function -19 Their results indicate that also under
these extreme conditions and for any reasonable choice of the main parameters
is not possible to explain all of the gas in clusters as due to galaxies In particu-
lar they found that the contribution of dwarfs to the total gas is not negligible
and it raises the galactic contribution up to 35 to compare with the negligible
amount of galactic gas obtained by Matteucci and Gibson 1995 by considering
only normal ellipticals In Figures 2 and 3 we show the predicted total masses
of iron and gas as functions of the total visual luminosity of the cluster galaxies
compared with the data from Arnaud 1994 From these gures it is clear that
the contribution of dwarfs to the gas in not negligible whereas their contribution
to metals is negligible This conclusion is in agreement with Nath and Chiba
1995 who also showed that dwarfs contribute negligibly to the iron content in
clusters
Finally we would like to stress the fact that this result about the origin of
gas in clusters is quite robust In fact Gibson and Matteucci 1997 have chosen
the most favorable conditions for the galaxies to loose mass In particular they
assumed that the amount and concentration of dark matter in dwarfs is constant
thus underestimating their potential well The  value that they predict is in
fact   007 lower than the observed range
