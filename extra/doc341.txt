Abstract This paper is in two unequal halves After dealing with the
possibility of a genuine continuum background at   1 cm and showing
that it is unlikely to arise in interesting circumstances the remainder of
the discussion is devoted to discrete radio sources and their consequences
for cosmology Three main issues are considered i what makes a galaxy
radio loud ii what do we know about how the population of radio-loud
galaxies has changed with epoch and iii what can observations of high-
redshift radio galaxies tell us about general questions of galaxy formation
and evolution The main conclusion is that radio galaxies are remarkably
ordinary massive ellipticals The high-redshift examples are generally old
and red and do not make good candidates for primaeval galaxies
1 INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this review is to see what facts of cosmological interest can be dredged
from wavelengths of above a few cm In order to deal with modern research rather than
ancient history it will be necessary to cheat a little and concentrate on the discrete-
source population rather than genuine smooth backgrounds  a strategy adopted by
many other speakers at this meeting However to do duty to the advertised title we
begin with a few comments about what a non-discrete background might actually mean
were it to exist Following this the concentration will be on radio galaxies why are
they active and how has the degree of activity changed with redshift The nal sections
attempt to liberate us from the shackle of the radio waveband altogether and to ask
what general conclusions may be drawn about stellar evolution and galaxy formation
from opticalIR data on high-redshift radio galaxies

2 THE SMOOTH RADIO BACKGROUND
Malcolm Longair has described how the Cavendish Laboratory spent the 1960s prac-
ticing human sacrice in order to determine the extragalactic radio-source background
with the following approximate result
I  6000 cid16
1 GHzcid1708
Jy sr1
to within an uncertainty of about 20 in amplitude and 01 in spectral index This
background dominates over the CMB for   1 m and is consistent with the integrated
contribution of discrete sources
On the other hand it is also not ruled out that a genuine continuum background
might exist at up to 10 or so of the above level What would this mean if it was
really so The hope would be to learn something about diuse intergalactic gas and
there are two standard emission mechanisms to which we might appeal synchrotron
radiation and bremsstrahlung The parameters available are the density of the emitting
plasma parameterised by its contribution to  in the case of synchrotron radiation the
electrons would have an assumed power-law energy distribution plus the local value of
either the magnetic eld B or temperature T  both of which should scale as 1  z2
The resultant background can then be worked out in the standard way see Longair
1978 For synchrotron radiation we get
I  1014 h cid18 B
nTcid1918
1 GHzcid1708

Jy sr1
What is a plausible value for the intergalactic magnetic eld It is worth recalling that
magnetic elds are very much a skeleton in the closet of cosmology since we cannot
easily rule out rather large values  which would signicantly change our ideas about
structure formation for example A nice review of the issue is given by Coles 1992
he argues that B could be as large as 104 nT This would allow observed magnetic
elds in astrophysical sources to be made via compression rather than dynamo eects
and would greatly alter the progress of galaxy clustering For such a eld the observed
background would be produced with h  103 This is an implausibly high density
for a plasma with fully relativistic electrons but it is perhaps surprising that the eect
is this close to being interesting
Turning to bremsstrahlung one can simply try scaling old solutions for the X-ray
background in which a low-energy ux of around 103 Jy sr1 is produced by models
with T  108 K and h2  01 Since bremsstrahlung emissivity scales as T 12 this
implies
I  103 cid0h2cid12 cid18 T
1Kcid1912
Jy sr1
If we ignore the diculty in keeping plasma at such temperatures ionized this seems
the closest that the radio background is likely to get to setting constraints on Cold Dark
Matter  
3 WHAT MAKES A RADIO-LOUD GALAXY
Turning now to the innitely more interesting issue of the population of discrete radio
sources we rst review what is known about the causes that lead to enhanced radio
emission
For orientation it is convenient to give a sketch of the population ordered ac-
cording to output Dene P  log10 L21 cmWHz1sr1 at P  24 we nd the classical
radio galaxies and quasars conventionally divided roughly into Fanaro-Riley 1974
FRII objects like Cygnus A and compact sources such as 3C273 At intermediate pow-
ers 23  P  24 we nd FRI sources twin-jet objects such as 3C31 often lurking in
clusters At P 
 24 we nd all the rest of astronomy radio-quiet quasars starburst
galaxies and normal galaxies We shall be concerned here with the bona-de radio
galaxies having P 
 23
Two outstanding systematics of such galaxies have long been known they are
virtually without exception associated with ellipticalS0 galaxies and moreover with
the massive members of this class This strong tendency for the probability of strong
radio activity to increase with optical luminosity is illustrated in Figure 1 It is however
interesting that this gure conceals a more complex behaviour noted by Owen  White
1991 They showed that the more powerful FRII sources are actually less likely in the
most massive galaxies  ie the FR transition shifts to higher radio power at higher
optical power This may indicate an inuence of the local density on the ability of a
radio jet to remain stable see Prestage  Peacock 1989 Nevertheless the increased
tendency of more massive galaxies to produce sources of FRI output or above is not in
conict with this interesting discovery
The rather narrow spread in stellar luminosity for radio galaxies has long been
known and is perhaps best illustrated in the infrared Hubble diagram Lilly  Longair
1984 which displays an rms of only 04 mag The average absolute magnitude is
somewhat brighter than for normal ellipticals The most direct way of demonstrating
this is not to rely on local samples where powerful radio galaxies are rare but to turn
to a direct comparison at intermediate redshifts Aragon-Salamanca et al 1991 give
K-band data on ellipticals in the A370 cluster at z  037 from which a Schechter
K   163 for the ellipticals can be determined Lilly  Longair give K  152 for
the mean radio galaxy at this redshift but this is in a 10 diameter aperture whereas
the cluster data are in 48 apertures The aperture correction at this radius is well

Figure 1
dierent bins in optical luminosity taken from Sadler Jenkins  Kotanyi 1989 Above
P  21  22 the probability of radio emission is a very rapidly rising function of optical
luminosity
modelled by L  r05 which introduces a small 04 mag correction and leads to the
conclusion
hLRGi  19L
Both the large size of this mean luminosity and its small dispersion may be understood
quantitatively as empirical manifestations of the strong trend of radio activity with
optical luminosity If we say that the probability of a galaxy hosting a strong radio AGN
is P  L
opt then multiplying this rising power law into the exponential truncation of
a Schechter function for the elliptical population as a whole gives roughly the observed
mean luminosity and scatter if   4  5 This may also go a good deal of the way
towards explaining the dominance of elliptical hosts the L values for elliptical galaxies
tend to be a few tenths of a magnitude brighter than for spirals a gap which may
be stretched to as much as a magnitude if we allow for typical bulge-to-disk ratios
to obtain the L ratios between ellipticals and spiral bulges We would then predict
NENS  25  102
In other words massive ellipticals dominate powerful radio
sources because only they have the exceptionally deep potential wells needed for the
most active radio AGN This is far from the whole story rst any possible spiral
identications for powerful radio sources must be more at the  103 level second the
whole reasoning rests on the strong L trend which remains unexplained There is still
a major puzzle here
Are there any other distinguishing features of radio galaxies Almost all other
peculiarities can either be traced directly to the eect of the AGN such as the strong
narrow emission lines or to the peculiarity of high mass already discussed It would be
important to know if there were any systematic dierences between those galaxies that
turn on a radio active nucleus and those that do not  but there is no strong evidence
for any such dierence Various suggestions have been made but these have usually
turned out to be small and subtle eects whose reality generates controversy
For example about a decade ago it was suggested that radio-loud galaxies were
redder by about 003 mag in B  V Sparks 1983 rounder Disney  Sparks 1984
more rapidly rotating Jenkins 1984 and in denser environments Sparks et al 1984
than their radio-quiet counterparts of the same optical luminosity Sparks et al 1984
argued that these trends could be understood within a single picture of fuel gathering in
potential wells with the deeper wells being more successful at generating radio activity
However in subsequent years the picture has become somewhat more complicated as
further data have accumulated For example Heckman et al 1985 found that the
suggestion of excess rotation was due to a few incorrect measurements in the compilation
used by Jenkins Smith  Heckman 1989 found a normal distribution of axial ratios
and claimed that galaxies were bluer  sometimes by as much as 02 mag
in B  V 
Finally Smith  Heckman 1990 found environments consistent with those of radio-
quiet ellipticals Part of the problem here may be that any peculiarity may be a function
of radio power so that dierent studies can yield dierent answers unless they use the
same denition of radio-loudness Also the range of properties of radio-quiet ellipticals
is large and diverse misleading conclusions may be reached unless there is a large and
complete comparison sample What is needed is a large sample of radio-loud ellipticals
whose properties can be compared to a radio-quiet set matched in optical luminosity
and redshift
In the meantime claimed peculiarities of radio ellipticals need to be treated
with caution Two properties which are presently in this provisional class are the
suggestion that radio ellipticals have low-level isophote distortions indicative of merg-
ing Smith  Heckman 1989 and the question of dynamics Smith Heckman 
Illingworth 1990 found that radio-loud ellipticals lie on the fundamental plane in
sizeluminosityvelocity dispersion space but there are some suggestions that they may
occupy a dierent region of the plane  being brighter at a given velocity or size San-
som Wall  Sparks 1987 Romanishin  Hintzin 1989 It will be interesting to see
how these suggestions hold up We certainly badly need some clear set of clues as to
what triggers these objects
4 LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS
Now consider what we know empirically about the abundance of radio AGN at high
redshift and what constraints this information may set on models of structure forma-
41 Observational results
No signicant new datasets relevant to the luminosity function of powerful radio sources
have been published since the study of the RLF published by James Dunlop and myself
in 1990 This was based on nearly-complete redshift data on roughly 500 sources down to
a limit of 100 mJy at 27 GHz plus fainter number-count data and partial identication
statistics
The main conclusions of this study were rstly to arm long-standing results
Longair 1966 Wall Pearson  Longair 1980 that the RLF undergoes dierential
evolution the highest luminosity sources change their comoving densities fastest Nev-
ertheless because the RLF curves the results can be described by a model of pure
luminosity evolution for the high-power population in close analogy with the situa-
tion for optically-selected quasars Boyle et al 1987 The characteristic luminosity in
this case increases by a factor  20 between the present and a redshift of 2 Similar
behaviour applies for both steep-spectrum and at-spectrum sources which provides
some comfort for those wedded to unied models for the AGN population There is
a remarkable similarity here to the evolution of starburst galaxies distinguished by
blue optical-UV continua and strong emission from dust which make them very bright
in the IRAS 60-m band It has been increasingly clear since the work of Windhorst
1984 that such galaxies make up a substantial part of the radio-source population
below S  1 mJy The evolution of these objects at radio wavelengths and at 60 m
is directly related because there exists an excellent correlation between output at these
two wavebands Rowan-Robinson et al 1993 have exploited this to investigate the
implications of IRAS evolution for the faint radio counts They nd good consistency
with the luminosity evolution L  1  z3 reported for the complete QDOT sample
of IRAS galaxies by Saunders et al 1990
Were it not for the fact that some populations of objects show little evolution
eg normal galaxies in the near-infrared Glazebrook 1991 one might be tempted to
suggest an incorrect cosmological model as the source of this near-universal behaviour
The alternative is to look for an explanation which owes more to global changes in the
Universe than in the detailed functioning of AGN One obvious candidate long sus-
pected of playing a role in AGN is galaxy mergers Carlberg 1990 suggested that this
mechanism could provide evolution at about the right rate although see Lacey  Cole
1993 Why the evolution does not look like density evolution is still a major stumbling
block but it seems that we should be looking at this area quite intensively given that
mergers have been implicated in both AGN and starbursts and that there may be some
evidence for their operation from the general galaxy population Broadhurst Ellis 
Glazebrook 1992
However it is unclear how much emphasis should be placed on this apparent
universality particularly limited statistics make it uncertain just how well luminosity
evolution is obeyed For example Goldschmidt et al 1992 have produced evidence
that the PG survey is very seriously incomplete at z 
 1 if conrmed this would imply
that the evolution of quasars of the very highest luminosities is less than for those a
few magnitudes weaker Furthermore the QDOT database was aicted by an error in
which 10 of the galaxies were assigned incorrectly high redshifts Lawrence private
communication this will probably weaken the IRAS degree of evolution It may well
be that the degree of unanimity described above will prove spurious and that we will
be left with the unsurprising situation that a complex phenomenon like AGN evolution
can only be described simply when the samples are too small to show much of the detail
42 Redshift cuto and interpretation
At higher redshifts the uncertainties increase as the data thin out but there is evidence
that the luminosity function cannot stay at its z  2 value at all higher redshifts The
form of this redshift cuto is uncertain we cannot at present distinguish between
possibilities such as a gradual decline for z  2 or a constant RLF up to some critical
redshift followed by a more precipitous decline We therefore present a straw man
model designed to concentrate the minds of observers in which the luminosity evolution
goes into reverse at z  2 and the characteristic luminosity retreats by a factor  3 by
z  4 Figure 2
Figure 2
The evolving RLF according to the pure luminosity evolution model of
Dunlop  Peacock 1990 The main features are a break which moves to higher powers at
high redshift but which declines slightly at z  2 the strength of the break and the rate
of evolution are comparable for both radio spectral classes
This model predicts the following fraction of objects at z  35 as a function
of 14-GHz ux-density limit 05 at 100 mJy 3 at 1 mJy Without some form of
cuto these numbers would be about a factor of 5 higher The reason for the increased
ease of detecting a cuto at low ux density is that the RLF is rather at at low powers
for   P  and S   we expect dNdz  1  z212 Steep spectra and a
steep RLF thus discriminate against high redshifts but at low powers the atter RLF
helps us to see whatever high-z objects there are more easily It should be relatively easy
to test for the presence of a cuto on the basis of these predictions This is especially
true at low ux densities see Figure 3 Here we still sample the at portion of the
RLF even at high redshift and so the predicted numbers of high-redshift sources is large
without a cuto  around 15 at z  4 for a sample at 1 mJy
Figure 3
A plot of the integral redshift distributions predicted for two samples
limited at 14-GHz ux densities of 100 mJy and 1 mJy The upper line shows a prediction
for a luminosity function which is held constant for z  2 the lower line shows the prediction
of the negative luminosity evolution model of Dunlop  Peacock 1990
Whether or not the redshift cuto is real we seem to have direct evidence that
the characteristic comoving density of radio galaxies has not altered greatly between
z  4 and the present Integrating to 1 power of 10 below the break in the RLF we
  106h3 Mpc3
Is this a surprising number In models involving hierarchical collapse the characteristic
mass of bound objects is an increasing function of time At high mass the abundance
of objects falls exponentially if the statistics of the density eld are Gaussian Clearly
a model such as CDM which falls in this class will be embarrassed if the density of
massive objects stays high to indenite redshifts The analysis of this problem using
the Press-Schechter mass-function formalism Press  Schechter 1974 was rst given
by Efstathiou  Rees 1988 for optically-selected quasars
There are two degrees of freedom in the analysis what mass of object is under
study and what are the parameters of the uctuation power spectrum For the rst
Efstathiou  Rees had to construct a long and uncertain chain of inference leading from
quasar energy output to black-hole mass to baryonic galaxy mass to total halo mass
For radio galaxies things are much simpler because we can see the galaxy directly
Infrared observations imply that certainly up to z  2 the stellar mass of radio galaxies
has not changed signicantly At low redshift there is direct evidence that the mass
of radio galaxies exceeds 1012 M so it seems reasonable to adopt this value at higher
redshift Figure 4 shows the Press-Schechter predictions for two COBE-normalized
CDM models The low-h model which ts the shape of the galaxy-clustering power
spectrum Peacock 1991 intersects the observed number density at low-ish redshifts 7
 8 whereas the standard h  05 model with its higher degree of small-scale power
predicts many more objects This is clearly only a suggestive coincidence at present but
it is clearly interesting that the model which most nearly describes large-scale structure
also predicts that the formation of massive objects should occur near the point at which
we infer a lack of high-z AGN
43 Black-Hole abundances
In the spirit of this meeting it is probably important to concentrate on integrated
properties of the radio-source population One important feature of this sort is the relic
density of black holes deposited by the work of past AGN This is something which
has been discussed extensively for radio-quiet quasars but which has not been given
so much attention in the radio waveband alone The advantage of doing this is that
as discussed above we have a rather good idea of which galaxies host radio-loud AGN
and therefore we know where to look for any debris from burned-out AGN The basic
analysis of this problem goes back to Soltan 1982 He showed that the relic black-hole
density may be deduced observationally in a model-independent manner as follows
The mass deposited into black holes in time dt by an AGN of luminosity L is
dMc2  1g L  dt
where  is an eciency and g is a bolometric correction To obtain the total mass
density in black holes we have to multiply the above equation by the luminosity function
which already gives the comoving density as required and integrate over luminosity
The integral can be converted to one over redshift and ux density and the integrand
depends of the observable distribution of redshifts and ux densities so the answer is
model dependent Doing this for the Radio LF gives a much lower answer than for
optically-selected QSOs which have a much higher density

The epoch dependence of the integral mass function in CDM calculated
using the Press-Schechter formalism as in Efstathiou  Rees 1988 The normalization is
to the COBE detection of CMB uctuations Results are shown for two Hubble constants
the standard h  05 upper panel and h  03 lower panel Here h is merely
a tting parameter used to describe the shape of the power spectrum and it does not
presuppose a true value of the Hubble constant The vertical scaling of density with h is
given explicitly and the mass values assume h  05 The extra small-scale power in the
former case means that many more massive hosts than the observed radio-galaxy number
horizontal line are predicted even at z  10
Since we know rather well the present density of massive elliptical galaxies eg Loveday
et al 1992 we may distribute half the above radio mass into ellipticals above the
median radio-galaxy luminosity with the following result for the mean hole mass
hMi  2000 1g h3 M
What is the bolometric correction for radio galaxies We know that the total output
generally peaks in the IRAS wavelength regime with an eective g  100 Heckman
Chambers  Postman 1992 this gives
hMi  2  105 1 h3 M
which paints a rather less optimistic prospect for detection than studies based on the
output of QSOs This is because even with such a large g the actual energy radiated
by radio galaxies is rather low and this is not compensated for fully by the relative
rareness of the host galaxies The above gure is not easy to reconcile with large
black-hole masses suggested for some radio AGN For example Lauer et al
suggest a central mass of M  3  109 M for M87 Without suggesting that M87 is
greatly atypical this can always be made consistent by assuming a low enough eciency
However this would not t well with the view that radio galaxies are powered via
electrodynamic extraction of black-hole rotational energy eg Blandford 1990 here
the eciency can be up to   1  212 If masses of order 109M are substantiated
in several radio galaxies or radio-quiet massive ellipticals this would be quite a puzzle
Probably the simplest solution would be to suggest that the total energy was higher
than suggested by the above sum  perhaps because radio ellipticals spend part of their
lives as QSOs where the total energy output would be considerably higher for a given
radio power
5 HI SEARCHES FOR HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXIES
We now turn to the question of what the radio waveband has to say about the properties
of galaxies seen at high redshifts One unique capability of radio astronomy for cosmol-
ogy is the detection of neutral hydrogen via the 21 cm line This tends to receive most
attention at low redshifts via the Tully-Fisher relation and the studies of the distance
scale and peculiar velocities However it also gives a unique way of detecting neutral
gas at high redshift  even beyond the limit of z  5 where quasar absorption-line stud-
ies can probe Particularly motivated by early pancake theories of galaxy formation
in which purely baryonic models give a supercluster-scale coherence length to the mass
distribution there have been a number of attempts over the years to use low-frequency
observations to detect neutral hydrogen at high redshifts eg Davies Pedlar  Mirabel
1978 z  33  49 Bebbington 1986 z  84 Uson Bagri  Cornwell 1991 z  33
Wieringa de Bruyn  Katgert 1992 z  33 These are sensitive only to rather large
structures for a Gaussian velocity dispersion v the expected ux density is
 199 cid18 MHI
1014 Mcid19 cid16
103 km s1cid171
D2 1  z
where D is comoving distance divided by cH0  eg D  21  1  z12 in an
  1 model Since sensitivities of a few mJy are typically attained the experiment is
sensitive to masses in the range 1014  1015 M
Most such experiments have yielded only upper limits but the VLA experiment
of Uson Bagri  Cornwell 1991 claimed the detection of a resolved object with a peak
ux density of 10 mJy The inferred parameters of their object were
z  3397
MHI  1014 h2 M
  5  1 h1 proper Mpc
v  77 km s1
This experiment caused much debate particularly the authors claim that this was
an example of a Zeldovich pancake The characteristics of the emission are certainly
hard to understand in any other way The gas mass and size of object together with
the eective volume of space surveyed are about right for a rich cluster of galaxies
However in addition to the minute velocity dispersion one would also not expect to nd
intracluster gas in a neutral state In hierarchical models it is continually shock heated
by new infalling clumps of mass as structure grows The only neutral gas would be
associated with individual galaxies producing much less massive neutral condensations
eg Subrahmanian  Padmanabhan 1993 The only possibility might be a group
of unusually neutral-rich galaxies resembling the damped Lyman- absorption systems
seen in quasar spectra in this context it is worth noting that Wolfe 1993 has shown
these to lie in regions of high density at least in terms of cross-correlation with weaker
Lyman- emitters In any case it would still be necessary to appeal to the coincidence
of seeing a cluster close to its turn-round time to explain why the velocity dispersion is
so small and even this does not solve things completely since there will be a dispersion
associated with substructure
Only in models with an initial coherence length does the gas have time to cool
and regain its neutrality following heating at the initial collapse of the cluster Without
attempting to turn history back to a time before dark matter perhaps the least radical
modication would involve warm dark matter with a coherence length of a few Mpc
This would in any case lead to the usual top-down chain of events for galaxy formation
Since we believe that objects of cluster mass in fact mainly formed relatively recently
Lacey  Cole 1993 see also the contribution to this volume by S White this would
have important implications for the ages of galaxies For this reason it is vital that the
Uson et al object be either conrmed or shown not to exist Van der Kruit private
communication suggests that the Westerbork group have indeed failed to detect it
which may cause some relief to those distressed by the above discussion Whatever the
eventual outcome such observations will continue with increasing sensitivity and will
be capable of setting interesting constraints on conditions at high redshift
6 STELLAR POPULATIONS AT HIGH REDSHIFT
61 The golden age
Finally for a line of argument that turns out to lead in completely the opposite direction
 ie to galaxy formation at rather high redshift  we turn to the stellar populations in
high-redshift radio galaxies Most of the 1980s constitute a vanished age of innocence
for the radio cosmologists at this time they were the only ones able to nd galaxies at
 1 in any sort of numbers A series of investigations established several interesting
properties for these objects in particular
i The well-dened Kz relation for 3CR radio galaxies consistent with purely pas-
sive evolution of their stellar populations and producing 1 mag of brightening
by z  1 Lilly  Longair 1984
ii The large scatter in the optical-IR Lilly  Longair 1984 and optical eg Spin-
rad  Djorgovski 1987 colours of 3CR galaxies which was interpreted as re-
ecting the occurrence of bursts of star formation in otherwise passively evolving
objects
iii Lilly 1989 argued for a two-component model in which a bluer component was
superimposed onto a rather red underlying galaxy To reproduce the spectral
energy distribution of the red component and thus of the reddest radio galaxies
required ages greater than 1 Gyr pointing to high formation redshifts Lilly 1989
Dunlop et al 1989b Windhorst Koo  Spinrad 1986 although there was some
controversy over the model dependence of the exact ages Chambers  Charlot
iv Perhaps the high-water mark of this period was the discovery by Lilly 1988 of
090234 at z  34 at a time when the galaxy redshift record was 18 The
apparently red colours of this object argued for a large enough age that the bulk
of the stars must have formed at z 
 6  an inference of enormous importance
for models of galaxy formation
However over the last few years a revisionist tendency has appeared  leading to
all the above achievements being questioned Even at the time there was some doubt
whether we could be sure that the above behaviour was representative of all galaxies
Fears of a radio-induced bias appeared well founded with the discovery of what has
become known as the alignment eect the realisation that at large redshifts z 
 08
the optical and radio axes of many of the most powerful radio galaxies are aligned
McCarthy et al 1987 Chambers Miley  van Breugel 1987 Near-IR images of 3CR
galaxies appeared to conrm that the infrared morphologies of these objects were in
general just as peculiar as their optical morphologies Chambers Miley  Joyce 1988
Eisenhardt  Chokshi 1990 Eales  Rawlings 1990 These discoveries provide direct
evidence of radio-induced pollution of the UV-optical light of radio galaxies and this
led some authors to suggest that these sources are thus useless as probes of galaxy
evolution in general eg Eisenhardt  Chokshi 1990
Furthermore it has become apparent that Lillys galaxy 090234 does not have
the properties initially claimed The K ux is rather lower than Lillys measurement
and a large fraction of this smaller total is contributed by the OII 3727A line which
is redshifted into the K window The result is that the galaxy in fact looks very young
nearly at-spectrum with no evidence for the presence of an old component On this
basis and considering other similar objects at extreme redshifts Eales et al 1993
have argued that radio galaxies at z 
 2 are in eect protogalaxies observed in the
process of formation
Before accepting this remarkable reversal of conventional wisdom however it is
worth bearing in mind that the galaxies under discussion are among the most luminous
few dozen radio AGN in the entire universe inevitably they are the high-redshift
members of bright samples with S  1  10 Jy In order to draw any general conclusions
about galaxy formation it is necessary to understand the eect the AGN has on the
opticalIR properties of the galaxy within which it is embedded
62 Alignments as a function of power
What is required is to be able to study the properties of galaxies with a wide range
of radio powers and this is what James Dunlop  I have attempted in some recent
work Dunlop  Peacock 1993
In order to eliminate possible confusion with any
epoch dependence we worked with a redshift band around z  1 At this redshift it
is relatively easy to select samples unbiased by optical selection and the objects are
bright enough that high-quality data can be obtained We considered galaxies from
two catalogues 19 high-power 3CR galaxies 14 low-power comparison galaxies with
S27 GHz  01 Jy from the Parkes Selected Regions PSR Downes et al 1986 Dunlop
et al 1989a The PSR galaxies are a factor  20 less radio luminous than their
3CR counterparts Radio luminosity is the only signicant dierence between the radio
properties of the two samples
Our principal dataset on these galaxies is deep infrared images taken with the
62  58 pixel InSb array camera IRCAM on the 39m United Kingdom Infrared Tele-
scope UKIRT with the camera operating in the 062-arcsecpixel mode From these
images we investigated the extent of the the alignment eect at z  1 To avoid sub-
jective factors the infrared position angles were determined automatically by using the
moments of the sky-subtracted ux within some circular aperture We decided to vary
the diameter of the aperture to adapt to the size of the radio source because there are
virtually no examples of optical or IR emission extending beyond the radio lobes If the
diameter of the radio source lay between 5 and 8 arcsec an aperture equal in diameter
to the radio source was used If the radio source was greater than 8 arcsec in diameter
an 8 arcsec diameter was used larger apertures generally contain foreground objects
If the radio source was smaller than 5 arcsec in diameter a 5-arcsec diameter was used

Histograms of IR  Radio position angle dierences for the 3CR and
PSR samples The clear dierence seen here is completely robust to dierent methods for
determining position angles It is related to the fact that the PSR galaxies are also rounder
and generally lacking in an extended aligned component of blue light
Figure 5 shows the resulting IRradio alignment histogram for the 3CR and PSR
subsamples The infrared alignment eect is extremely obvious in our data for the 3CR
galaxies which appears to contrast with the conclusions of Rigler et al 1992 Much
of the apparent discrepancy arises from the fact that we have a larger sample Position
angles for objects in common generally agree well but with some exceptions which are
due to dierent methods of analysis Rigler et al 1992 sometimes use a large aperture
where their position angle is aected by companion objects In contrast to the 3CR sub-
sample there is no evidence of any signicant alignment between the infrared and radio
morphologies of the PSR galaxies This result is very robust and quite obvious given
the images the PSR galaxies are rounder with generally little sign of the disturbance
evident in many of the 3CR images
This argues in favour of the two-component model advanced by Lilly 1989 and
Rigler et al 1992 In this the underlying galaxy is round but there is a component
of variable amplitude which is elongated along the radio axis and it is this which leads
to the alignment Our data demonstrate that the strength of this component correlates
well with radio power as is perhaps not so surprising in retrospect Certainly several
models for the production of this light exist that predict a correlation with radio power
scattering induced star formation inverse Compton emission  see eg Daly 1992 for
a review We shall not be concerned here with having to plump for a specic model
but it is worth noting that evidence is starting to mount in favour of the explanation
in terms of scattering from a hidden blazar The main argument in this direction is
the measurement of polarization with E-vector perpendicular to the radio axis The
rst measurements of this eect gave very low percentage polarizations implying that
this could not be the dominant mechanism However with better resolution imaging
polarimetry is now producing polarized fractions of 
 20 in the outer parts of strongly
aligned galaxies Jannuzi  Elston 1991 Tadhunter et al 1992 Cimatti et al 1993
Given geometrical dilution it now seems plausible that the aligned component results
from scattering in at least some objects
63 Colours and ages of radio galaxies
Having seen that the extent of the aligned component scales so dramatically with radio
power we now look for other opticalinfrared properties which correlate with power
Given that the aligned component is often bluer than the nucleus of the galaxy we
should certainly expect to see some correlation between colour and power A useful way
of quantifying the degree of UV activity was introduced by Lilly 1989 He assumes
that the observed spectrum of a radio galaxy arises from a combination of two distinct
components  an old population with a well-developed 4000A break and a young
at-spectrum component This simple model can be tted to the observed colours by
varying one parameter This is f5000 the fractional contribution of the at-spectrum
component to the galaxy light at a rest wavelength of 5000A This method can also
be used with some success to estimate the redshift for objects which lack spectroscopy
see Lilly 1989 Dunlop  Peacock 1993 Some of the PSR objects had their redshifts
estimated in exactly this way the redder objects with low f5000 also have low levels of
emission-line activity and so are of course the hardest spectroscopic targets
This procedure is illustrated in Figure 6 For the old or red component we
chose to adopt a spectrum capable of producing the reddest colours seen in radio galaxies
Figure 6
Two examples of the spectral tting used to determine estimated redshifts
and f5000 the relative contribution of the at-spectrum component The red component
is the spectrum produced by a 1-Gyr Burst model of galaxy evolution at an age of 10 Gyr
The blue component is a power-law with spectral index   02 f   the mean
optical spectral index found for quasars by Barvainis 1990 2355010 is a red radio galaxy
with only a very small value of f5000 while 0059027 is one of the bluer galaxies in the
PSR sample
at z  1 eg 3C65 in practice this was achieved using the spectrum produced by a
stellar population of age 10 Gyr in an updated version of the models of Guiderdoni 
Rocca-Volmerange 1987 For the young or blue component we decided to adopt a
power-law spectrum f   with a spectral index   02 This choice of spectrum
can be justied at two dierent levels First the exact value of  was chosen in the
spirit of scattered quasar light Barvainis 1990 concluded that the mean value for
the optical spectral index in high luminosity quasars ie those whose optical spectra
are essentially uncontaminated by a host galaxy contribution is   02 Second
empirically this form of spectrum is an excellent representation of the approximately
at f optical-UV continuum actually observed in high-redshift radio galaxies
In Figure 7 we show the quantitative relation between this denition of UV
activity and radio power Radio power and f5000 appear to be strongly correlated no
PSR galaxy has f5000  019 whereas more than half the 3CR galaxies have f5000 
020 This result contrasts sharply with that of Lilly 1989 who reported that in his
combined 3CR and 1-Jy sample there was no signicant correlation between f5000 and
P408 MHz The origin of the dierence appears to be an error in Lillys calculation of
radio luminosity An interesting aspect of the relation with power is that all sub-samples
appear to possess a range of f5000 values but with power apparently setting the upper
limit in f5000 This suggests the existence of a second parameter which determines the
actual level of UV light  see Dunlop  Peacock 1993 for further discussion
For the present the point to emphasise is that this diagram provides a quan-
titative denition of a radio-quiet galaxy At least at z  1 any galaxy with P27 
10255 WHz1sr1 for h  12 has a negligibly small level of UV activity There have
been some suggestions that UV activity and alignments are functions specically of red-
shift but there is little evidence that this is anything other than a reection of the above
Radio power P27 GHz versus f5000 for the combined 46-source 3CR1-

JyPSR sample 3CR sources are shown as squares 1-Jy sources as triangles and the PSR
sources as circles Notice that the correlation is mainly in the sense of setting an upper limit
to f5000 at given power
trend in a ux-limited sample Until proven otherwise the natural null hypothesis is
that galaxies below this power level at higher redshifts also reect the properties of the
general population of massive ellipticals
In Figure 8 we compare the R  K colours of the PSR and 3CR galaxies Several
other objects which are not part of our PSR and 3CR subsamples have been included
here for comparison purposes These are i the very red 3CR galaxy 3C65 ii the
ve 1-Jy galaxies with measured redshifts for which r  K colours are given by Lilly
1989 and iii all spectroscopically conrmed quasars with 05  z  20 in the Parkes
Selected Regions sample for which R  K colours exist Dunlop et al 1989a
This diagram displays a number of important features First with the obvious
exception of 3C65 the PSR galaxies are consistently redder than the 3CR galaxies
moreover the PSR galaxies display remarkably little dispersion in their optical-infrared
colours This is well consistent with the ndings of Rixon Wall  Benn 1991 at
lower redshift they found the rest-frame colours of radio ellipticals at z  03 to be
constant to within a few hundredths of a magnitude
In contrast the 3CR galaxies
scatter downwards from the well-dened PSR locus towards the region of colour space
occupied by the PSR quasars the very red galaxies 3C65 and 112937 appear to be
exceptional Of the six 3CR galaxies with R  K  40 all but one 3C252 have
K-band morphologies clearly aligned with their radio axes
The homogeneity of the PSR galaxies along with the lack of any dramatic align-
ment eect in the redder galaxies suggests instead that the true optical-infrared colour
of a radio-quiet elliptical at z  1 is actually R  K  48 Values of f5000  005
might be a feature of most elliptical galaxies at z  1 This is certainly consistent

50 kms1Mpc1 UV-hot model of elliptical galaxy evolution Rocca-Volmerange 1989
with the results of Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 From opticalIR photometry of
clusters of galaxies up to z  08 they conclude that ellipticals mainly radio-quiet
in the highest-redshift clusters are slightly bluer than present-day ellipticals On the
assumption that these galaxies formed in a single burst their data allow the epoch of
formation to be as low as z  2 However the radio-selected samples extend the range
still further Although the above discussion has concentrated on the situation at z  1
the PSR sample contains a number of galaxies inferred from colour-estimated redshifts
and from the Kz relation to have z  2 These also are apparently old and red with
R  K  4  5 If this is taken to imply a minimum age of 1h1 Gyr the formation red-
shift is pushed out to between 33 and 72 depending on  Note that this is the epoch
at which the whole galaxy must be assembled ellipticals cannot have been assembled
from many small clumps after star formation had ceased Bower Lucey  Ellis 1992
It will be fascinating to pursue this line of argument in mJy samples where we may
hope to nd normal radio galaxies at z  3 If these are still red the consequences for
galaxy formation models will be radical indeed
7 CONCLUSIONS
This review has given a brief summary of the properties of galaxies as viewed in the
radio background In conclusion it is worth emphasising three points
i Although some factors such as galaxy mass and Hubble type strongly dispose a
galaxy to host a radio-loud AGN we still have no denite understanding of why
this should be so Other distinguishing marks of radio galaxies might be helpful
in this process but few if any are clearly established
ii With certain exceptions such as the situation at z  2 we have a good statistical
description of how the abundance of radio AGN evolves Again though we are
very far from understanding why active nuclei found it so much easier to function
at high redshift
iii High-redshift radio galaxies should probably not be thought of as in any way
primaeval If we ignore the few dozen most luminous sources in the universe
then the opticalIR properties of high-redshift radio galaxies are consistent with
those of radio-quiet ellipticals They appear to be red and old theories in which
most massive galaxies complete their star formation at z  4 are required
