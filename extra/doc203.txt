ABSTRACT
Cumulative number density matching of galaxies is a method to observationally
connect descendent galaxies to their typical main progenitors at higher redshifts and
thereby to assess the evolution of galaxy properties The accuracy of this method is
limited due to galaxy merging and scatter in the stellar mass growth history of individ-
ual galaxies Behroozi et al 2013 have introduced a renement of the method based
on abundance matching of observed galaxies to the Bolshoi dark-matter-only simula-
tion The EAGLE cosmological hydro-simulation is well suited to test this method
because it reproduces the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and
has a representative sample of passiveactive galaxies We nd agreement with the
Behroozi et al 2013 method for the complete sample of main progenitors of z  0
galaxies but we also nd a strong dependence on the current star formation rate
Passive galaxies with a stellar mass up to 101075Mcid12 have a completely dierent me-
dian mass history than active galaxies of the same mass This dierence persists if we
only select central galaxies This means that the cumulative number density method
should be applied separately to active and passive galaxies Even then the typical
main progenitor of a z  0 galaxy already spans two orders of magnitude in stellar
mass at z  2 Any observational analysis using cumulative number density matching
therefore needs to be tested on a range of simulations
Key words galaxies evolution  galaxies formation  galaxies high-redshift
1 INTRODUCTION
Observations provide properties of samples of galaxies at
dierent redshifts Inferring the typical evolution of individ-
ual galaxies from these observations is non-trivial since it
involves linking representative progenitor- and descendant-
galaxies This link is not directly observable since every
galaxy is normally only observed at one instance in time
Once we have the ideal cosmological simulation that re-
produces the evolution of all properties of galaxy samples
across cosmic time we can retrieve typical galaxy evolu-
tion tracks from this However at the moment the space of
possible simulations is many-dimensional and not well con-
strained by physics from rst principles Changes in one of
the modelling assumptions can aect many predictions in a
complicated way Vice versa the comparison of simulation
predictions and observations does not easily translate into a
required change in the model ingredients For that reason

apart from comparing galaxy samples in observations and
simulations it is important to attempt to infer the typical
evolution of individual galaxy properties as much as possible
directly from observations
Cumulative number density matching of galaxies across
redshift is a promising method to achieve this In its orig-
inal form it does not need any simulation input The cu-
mulative number density at a given redshift and mass is
dened as the comoving number density of galaxies with a
stellar mass larger than or equal to the given mass Main pro-
genitors are then selected at a constant cumulative number
density The underlying assumption is that galaxies evolve
conjointly building up stellar mass in a similar way with-
out changing rank order based on stellar mass or velocity
dispersion
This method originating from the work of Loeb  Pee-
bles 2003 has been employed by Papovich et al 2011
and Lundgren et al 2014 to study stellar mass and star
formation rate SFR evolution out to z  8 by van Dokkum
et al 2010 and Patel et al 2013 to study the evolution of
Clauwens et al
the structural parameters of massive galaxies out to z  3
by van Dokkum et al 2013 and Morishita et al 2015 to
study the stellar density prole evolution of Milky-Way-like
and massive galaxies since z  3 and by Finkelstein et al
2015 to predict the abundance of bright z  9 galaxies
Cumulative number density matching is not expected
to be a perfect method for inferring the evolution of galax-
ies because it neglects galaxy mergers and because rank or-
der may not be conserved The viability of the method has
therefore been investigated by Leja van Dokkum  Franx
2013 applied forward in time to the descendants of z  3
galaxies based on the Guo et al 2011 semi-analytic model
of galaxy formation They nd that a constant cumulative
number density is a good rst order approximation for these
descendants Behroozi et al 2013 apply the method back-
wards in time to the main progenitors of z  0 galaxies
They use by construction a representative history of the
galaxy stellar mass function GSMF based on the abun-
dance matching of observed galaxies to the Bolshoi dark-
matter-only simulation They nd that a constant cumula-
tive density is a poor prescription for matching main pro-
genitors and they give a recipe to account for the increase
in the running median cumulative number density towards
higher redshifts that results from merging 016z dex
This equation applies to a large range of galaxy masses and
redshifts up to 8 Other recent studies have been undertaken
by Torrey et al 2015 based on the Illustris hydrodynamic
simulation and by Mundy Conselice  Ownsworth 2015
for four semi-analytic methods
In this work we investigate the accuracy of the cumula-
tive number density matching technique by comparing to re-
sults of the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulation Schaye et al
2015 Crain et al 2015 EAGLE is arguably the rst hy-
drodynamic simulation that has an accurate enough evolu-
tion of the GSMF Furlong et al 2015 and a representative
enough passiveactive galaxy population Schaye et al 2015
Trayford et al 2016 to address this question in some detail
2 SIMULATION
We follow the main progenitors of redshift zero galaxies
in the 100 Mpc3 sized EAGLE simulation RefL100N1504
This simulation has been calibrated to the z  0 GSMF
and mass-size relation It has an initial gas particle mass
of 18  106 Mcid12 and a maximum gravitational force soften-
ing of 700 pc We use the public data release described in
McAlpine et al 2016 Following De Lucia  Blaizot 2007
the main progenitor is dened as the progenitor with the
most massive integrated history
3 RESULTS
Fig 1 shows the median mass history of main progenitors
in three 025 dex wide mass bins at z  0 For all mass
bins also those not shown at lower and higher masses a
constant cumulative number density dotted black curve
signicantly overestimates the true median main progenitor
mass solid black curve in the simulation Typically there is
already an 05 dex dierence in mass at z  2 We conrm
that this oset is adequately captured by the prescription of
Behroozi et al 2013 of increasing the cumulative number
density by 016z dex compare solid and dashed black
curves The fact that the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulation
gives the same median main progenitor mass history as the
abundance matching technique of Behroozi et al 2013
shows that this is mainly a property of the dark matter
halo merger tree provided that the history of the GSMF is
accurately captured by the simulation
However hydrodynamic processes do determine what
kind of galaxy can be expected to be found in what kind of
halo The technique of nding representative main progeni-
tors via cumulative number density matching assumes that
galaxies of a certain mass share a common history We know
from observations that the redshift zero galaxy population is
bimodal with clear active star forming and passive galaxy
populations eg Strateva et al 2001 We expect that the
history of a typical passive galaxy diers from that of a
typical active galaxy remaining closer to its current stellar
Indeed
in the EAGLE simulation the current ac-
tivepassive status of a galaxy dened using a sSFR cut
at 1011yr is highly predictive for its median main pro-
genitor mass history The blue and red curves in Fig 1 show
the median main progenitor mass of the z  0 active re-
spectively passive galaxy populations The three mass bins
cover the interesting region that goes from no dierence be-
tween activepassive at 1075  log10MMcid12  11 and
higher via a signicant dierence at Milky Way-like masses
105  log10MMcid12  1075 towards a large dierence
at 1025  log10MMcid12  105 and lower These dier-
ences can be of the same order as those between a constant
cumulative number density and the Behroozi et al 2013
prescription roughly 05 dex at z  2 The 10th  90th per-
centile blue and red shaded regions show that there is also
a large variation in main progenitor masses
Fig 2 shows the median cumulative number density for
the same galaxy samples as in Fig 1 At a given redshift the
comoving cumulative density refers to the number density
of galaxies with a stellar mass larger than or equal to the
median main progenitor mass of the indicated galaxy sam-
ple which is selected at z  0 We see that the median main
progenitor of the active galaxies follows the exponential cu-
mulative number density increase of Behroozi et al 2013
but the median main progenitor of the passive galaxies rst
evolves along a track of constant cumulative number density
up to z  15 after which it follows the same exponential
trend as the main progenitors of active galaxies albeit at
an oset which would correspond to a more massive active
galaxy at redshift zero
This behaviour can be explained by comparing the evo-
lution of the sSFR of the main progenitors of the active
versus passive z  0 galaxy selections Fig 3 shows the ra-
tio of the average sSFRs of the passive and active galaxy
selections in dierent z  0 mass bins We see that the
main progenitors of passive galaxies have a reduced sSFR
with respect to the main progenitors of active galaxies up
to z  125 for the highest-mass bin and up to z  25
for the lowest-mass bin Higer-mass passive galaxies have on
average quenched later Although not all the stellar mass
growth can be attributed to the sSFR of the main progeni-
tor since dry mergers also contribute the integrated eect
of this sSFR dierence between the active and passive sam-

Cumulative number density in EAGLE
Figure 1 The history of the median main progenitor stellar mass in the EAGLE simulation for three 025 dex wide mass bins selected
at z  0 The solid black curve denotes the true median main progenitor mass The dotted black curve shows the stellar mass at a
constant cumulative number density The dashed black curve follows the stellar mass at an exponentially evolving cumulative number
density as suggested by Behroozi et al 2013 Solid blue and red curves denote the true median main progenitor masses for the subsets
of z  0 active respectively passive galaxies The shaded regions denote the corresponding 10th  90th percentiles
Figure 2 The cumulative number density of main progenitors All selections are the same as in Fig 1 The median main progenitor mass
of the z  0 passive galaxies solid red lines tends to follow a constant cumulative number density at low redshift and an exponential
increase in the cumulative number density parallel to the Behroozi et al 2013 prescription at higher redshifts
ples plays a large part in driving the dierence in median
main progenitor mass and the corresponding dierence in
cumulative number density The redshift range over which
the passive main progenitors in Fig 2 follow a constant cu-
mulative number density roughly agrees with the redshift
range in Fig 3 for which the sSFR is reduced
In order to get a better insight into the dierence be-
tween the true main progenitor galaxy sample and that ob-
tained with dierent cumulative number density matching
techniques Fig 4 shows a snapshot at redshift 2 of the two
most relevant galaxy properties the stellar mass and the
sSFR for the main progenitors of galaxies with Milky Way-
like masses at redshift zero The top panel shows the sig-
nicant dierence between the constant cumulative number
density technique and that obtained by using the real me-
dian cumulative number density which gives results that
are very similar to the Behroozi et al 2013 prescription
The bottom panel shows the dierence when using the real
median cumulative number density for active and passive
galaxies separately At z  2 the stellar mass range of the
main progenitors which was 025 dex at redshift zero al-
ready spans several orders of magnitude Since the EAGLE
galaxies follow a relatively tight stellar mass versus dark
matter mass relation the same applies to the halo mass

progenitors of the passive z  0 galaxy sample divided by that

ple selected at redshift zero to have a stellar mass of 105

panel black dots denote the true main progenitors magenta dots
denote the galaxy sample that would be selected at z  2 based
on a constant median cumulative number density and green dots
denote the galaxy sample that would be selected using the true
median main progenitor stellar mass which gives similar results
as the prescription of Behroozi et al 2013 In the bottom panel
a redshift zero selection is made on activepassive galaxies de-
noted by the bluered bands Blue and red dots denote the true
main progenitors of the active respectively passive galaxies Black
and grey dots denote the galaxy sample that would be selected at
z  2 using the correct median main progenitor mass separately
for the active and passive sample
Hence any technique that does not sample a representative
spread in stellar mass will select a rather unrepresentative
sample of main progenitors Moreover for such a wide dis-
tribution the median and the mean stellar mass will dier
substantially
Depending on which galaxy property is studied one
might need a dierent cumulative number density matching
technique For example a study like that of van Dokkum
et al 2013 which uses a cumulative number density
matching technique to observationally assess the radial stel-
Figure 5 The median cumulative number density of the main
progenitors of z  0 galaxies in dierent mass bins indicated by
dierent colours separately for passive and active centrals top
panel and for passive centrals and satellites bottom panel The
top panel shows a similar dierence between active and passive
cumulative number densities for central galaxies as Fig 2 showed
for all galaxies The bottom panel shows that the main progen-
itors of passive satellites tend to be more massive than those of
passive centrals of the same mass
lar mass buildup of Milky Way-like galaxies would benet
from using a cumulative number density based on the aver-
age stellar mass or even better including a representative
variation in mass
Apart from discriminating between the progenitors of
active and passive galaxies an obvious other selection crite-
rion is on satellite- versus central galaxies Fig 5 top panel
shows that selecting only the main progenitors of central
galaxies gives a similar dependence on the activepassive
state as for all galaxies in Fig 2 so the dierence in mass
between the main progenitors of active and passive galaxies
is not mainly caused by the quenching of satellite galaxies
Fig 5 bottom panel shows however that the main pro-
genitors of passive satellites tend to be more massive than
those of passive centrals This dierence could be due to
earlier quenching of satellite galaxies andor the stripping
of stars from satellite galaxies There is no similar dierence

Hence the cumulative number density matching tech-
nique should discriminate between the main progenitors of
active and passive galaxies in order to obtain a reasonable
accuracy Exactly how to implement this is not clear One
could base such a method on a simulation like EAGLE and
device a main progenitor selection scheme based on both
stellar mass and sSFR This would however negate the ini-
tial appeal of the method that it only depends on observa-
tions and on the dark matter merger tree in the case of the
Behroozi et al 2013 method

in mass between the main progenitors of active centrals and
satellites not shown
Our results indicate that the progenitor masses are sys-
tematically oset for passive galaxies by an amount simi-
lar to the correction calculated by Behroozi et al 2013
In addition the properties of the progenitors are system-
atically correlated over time eg SFR and hence central
density Sersic prole etc This means that in the ab-
sence of a procedure to correct for these correlations the
method has only limited applicability At the highest masses
n  5  104  10016z Mpc3 the method works best
4 CONCLUSIONS
We use the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation to study the
accuracy of the cumulative number density matching tech-
nique in creating a representative sample of main progenitor
galaxies as a function of redshift The EAGLE simulation is
well suited to study this question because it reproduces the
evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and has a rep-
resentative population of passive and active galaxies Our
main ndings are as follows
 Using a constant cumulative number density prescrip-
tion to nd typical main progenitors of redshift zero galaxies
neglects mergers and signicantly overestimates the median
progenitor mass The error is  05 dex at z  2 for galax-
ies in the stellar mass range 1010Mcid12  M  1011Mcid12 and
 025 dex for M  1011Mcid12 Fig 1
 The prescription of Behroozi et al 2013 to increase
the cumulative number density by 016 dex per z accu-
rately captures the evolution of the median main progenitor
stellar mass As Behroozi et al 2013 used a dark mater
only simulation this shows that the evolution of the median
main progenitor mass is mainly set by the properties of the
halo merger tree Fig 2
 The main progenitor masses of z  0 galaxies that are
less massive than 101075Mcid12 critically depend on the current
star formation rate At z  2 the median main progenitor
mass of passive galaxies sSF R  1011yr at z  0 is
 05 dex higher than that of active galaxies Figs 12
 The dierence between the median main progenitor
mass of active and passive galaxies or equivalently the
dierence in median cumulative number density increases
gradually up to z  2 Out to this same redshift we see a
reduced average sSFR for the main progenitors of passive
galaxies compared to those of active galaxies Fig 3
 The mass dierence between the main progenitors of
passive and active galaxies persists if we only select central
galaxies Fig 5
 The large dierence between main progenitor masses
of passive and active galaxies calls for an inclusion of an
sSFR distinction in the cumulative number density matching
technique
 The spread in main progenitor masses already spans
several orders of magnitude at z  2 Fig 4 Therefore
it is imperative to include the variation in the main pro-
genitor stellar masses or cumulative number densities in
observational studies that use the cumulative number den-
sity matching technique For such a wide distribution the
average eg main progenitor density prole is expected to
be dierent from the median
