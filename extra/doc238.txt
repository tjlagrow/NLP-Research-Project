Abstract K band luminosity functions LFs of three massive high redshift clusters of galaxies
are presented The evolution of K  the characteristic magnitude of the LF is consistent with
purely passive evolution and a redshift of formation zf  152
1 Introduction
Near-infrared photometry of galaxies in high redshift clusters provides an excellent
method of studying evolution in the baryonic masses of cluster galaxies The K band is
rather insensitive to the enhanced blue emission associated with young stellar popula-
tions This means that observations made in the K band are measuring emission from
the old stellar populations thus the near-infrared NIR luminosity is much more closely
correlated with the stellar mass of a galaxy than optical luminosities which may be sig-
nicantly inated by the presence of only a small but young stellar population The
K band has the added advantages that it has relatively small k-corrections and these
are very similar for galaxies of dierent spectral-type and the extinction due to dust
is also small Therefore by measuring the LFs of galaxies in high redshift clusters and
comparing to well established LFs of nearby systems it is possible to determine how the
distribution of stellar mass throughout the cluster population has evolved
2 Sample and Observations
We have obtained K band photometry of the central regions of three of the most
massive  101415M high redshift z  083  103 clusters of galaxies known All
three were discovered in the WARPS serendipitous X-ray survey Scharf et al 1997
Observations were made with UFTI on the UKIRT telescope on Mauna Kea Hawaii
The seeing was typically half an arcsecond in K The observations typically covered 3
arcminutes square corresponding to 3040 of the virial radii Further details of the
observations and analysis can be found in Ellis  Jones 2004
3 Modelling Passive Evolution
In the traditional monolithic collapse picture of galaxy formation Eggen et al 1962
all the stars in a galaxy are formed in an inital burst and thereafter the galaxy evolves
only in a passive quiescent manner as its stars make their journey along the main se-
quence This results in a gradual dimming of the stars and consequently the galaxy Any
further episodes in the evolution of galaxies such as secondary bursts of or gradual
star-formation activity mergers and gravitional eects such as harrassment stripping

starvation etc must take place against this background of the passive evolution of the
pre-existing stars
Thus in order to establish whether any of these extra-passive processes are important
in the evolution of cluster galaxies or more strictly if they are important in the evolution
of the K band luminosities of cluster galaxies we adopt the approach of modelling a
passively evolving system and searching for irregularities between the predictions of the
model and observations Unless the K band is insensitive to these extra-passive events
they should show up as dierences Thus it may be expected that the following analysis
is more senstive to issues regarding the mass-assembly of the galaxies than it is to the
star-formation history of galaxies
We have modelled passive evolution using the synthetic stellar population libraries of
Bruzual  Charlot 2003 Stellar populations with a Salpeter initial mass function and
solar metallicity were assumed The evolution was modelled for instantaneous bursts at
zf 15 2 and 5 along with predictions of no evolution
4 Results
LFs were constructed individually for each cluster after applying a statistical subtrac-
tion of foreground background galaxies based on number counts of galaxies from nearby
oset elds observed at the same time as the clusters and on spectroscopic informa-
tion for the brighter cluster members where available The LFs for ClJ0152 top left
ClJ1226 top right and ClJ1415 bottom left are shown in gure 1
Schechter 1976 functions were t to the LFs of each cluster individually with the
faint end slope xed at   09 the local value for the Coma cluster De Propris et al
1998 and the eld Gardner et al 1997 since the data were not deep enough to constrain
both  and K  precisely The evolution of K  with redshift is shown in the lower right
panel of gure 1 along with lower redshift points from De Propris et al 1999 The
models described in the previous section are normalised at low redshift to K  of the
Coma cluster De Propris et al 1998 The evolution is seen to be consistent with passive
evolution models with zf  15 if the models are normalised to Coma or a higher redshift
of formation if the models are normalised to the low redshift points from De Propris et al
1999
Purely passive evolution of early-type galaxies is consistent with several other stud-
ies including the evolution of the K band luminosity function De Propris et al 1999
Toft et al 2003 studies of the scatter of the colour-magnitude relation see eg Ellis et al
1997 Stanford et al 1998 and evolution of the fundamental plane in terms of mass-light
ratios van Dokkum et al 1998
Whilst the observed evolution is fully consistent with passive evolution it may be
reconciled with the framework of hierarchical formation of structure so long as any
merging between luminous galaxies in massive clusters takes place before z  1 As
the systems under consideration here are unusually massive they will be associated
with regions of large over-density and thus it is perhaps expected that objects will
assemble collapse at early epochs in such an environment Furthermore the large velocity
dispersions associated with massive clusters makes the likelihood of mergers small see
eg Diaferio et al 2001 For a more thorough discussion of this work see Ellis  Jones
