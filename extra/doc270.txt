ABSTRACT
We use new models of stellar population synthesis to estimate the fraction of stars
formed during the last major bursts of star formation in ES0 galaxies in low-redshift clus-
ters z  04 from the spectral signatures of intermediate-age stars We nd that the mass
fraction of stars formed in late bursts in early-type galaxies in clusters must have decreased
smoothly with redshift from about 8 at z  1 to less than 1 at z  0 This result
which we interpret as a constraint on stellar mass added in mergers is nearly independent
of the assumed ages and morphological types of the progenitor galaxies prior to the last
major bursts of star formation We then compute the implied color and 4000 A break evo-
lution for progenitors of ES0 galaxies in clusters at redshifts 0  z  1 We investigate
a conservative model in which all present-day ES0 galaxies are assumed to initially be
elliptical galaxies and to then undergo bursts of star formation at the rate estimated from
the signatures of intermediate-age stars at low redshifts This model reproduces well the
observed spread of colors and 4000 A breaks of galaxies in high-redshift clusters but un-
derestimates the fraction of galaxies in the blue tail of the distribution Such a discrepancy
may be interpreted as an increasing fraction of spiral galaxies in clusters at high redshift
as suggested independently by recent HST observations of intermediate-redshift clusters
The current data do not seem to require morphological evolution of cluster galaxies out
to z  04 but suggest that either morphological or strong luminosity evolution might
have played a major role at z  07 Our results provide spectrophotometric corroboration
to high redshift of a common but poorly justied interpretation of the Butcher-Oemler
eect

1 INTRODUCTION
Clusters are valuable laboratories for studying galaxy evolution over large look-
back times because they are more readily identiable than eld galaxies at high redshifts
The extent to which galaxy evolution diers between cluster and eld environments is not
clear Present-day clusters are rich in elliptical galaxies whereas the eld population is
rich in spiral galaxies Many galaxies in distant clusters have red colors consistent with the
hypothesis that these galaxies formed coevally at a redshift z  2 and evolved passively to
become the ES0 galaxies which dominate present-day clusters such as Coma eg Bower
Lucey  Ellis 1992 Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 However there is also strong evidence
for the evolution of galaxies in clusters Butcher  Oemler 1978 1984 pointed out that
the fraction of blue galaxies in the cores of rich clusters increases with redshift from about
2 at z  0 to nearly 20 at z  04  the Butcher-Oemler eect see also Dressler
 Gunn 1983 1992 Couch  Sharples 1987 Lavery  Henry 1988 These blue galaxies
are generally interpreted as star-forming galaxies which have disappeared today either
because they merged or because they were only temporarily blued by interaction-induced
starbursts Dressler  Gunn 1983 Lavery  Henry 1988 Evrard 1991 Recently HST
observations have revealed that in reality many blue galaxies in several clusters at z  04
are normal spiral or at least disky galaxies which do not show signs of interactions and
vigorous bursts of star formation Couch et al 1993 Dressler 1993
The evidence for evolution of cluster galaxies also comes from absorption-line studies
of ES0 galaxies in low-redshift clusters z  04 Many of the galaxies which were
observed exhibit spectral signatures consistent with the presence of intermediate-age stellar
populations Couch  Sharples 1987 Lavery  Henry 1988 Pickles 1989 Dressler  Gunn
1992 This would indicate that the galaxies were forming stars and hence were bluer
only a few billion years ago However the fact that many blue galaxies in distant clusters
appear to be normal spiral galaxies suggests that morphological evolution of spiral into
 3 
ES0 galaxies could also have played a signicant role over the last few billion years The
situation is complicated by the fact that present-day clusters contain a signicant fraction
of gas-poor spiral galaxies with colors nearly as red as ES0 galaxies with B  V  09
see the recent review by Oemler 1992 On average about 1020 of galaxies in the cores
of nearby rich concentrated clusters are of late type Dressler 1980 Butcher  Oemler
1978 whereas only 25 are blue where a blue galaxy is dened as having a B  V color
at least 02 mag bluer than the ES0 sequence at the same absolute magnitude Butcher
 Oemler 1984 In this context the absorption-line signatures of intermediate-age stars
in ES0 galaxies represent an invaluable means of estimating the mininum fraction of blue
galaxies in high-redshift clusters which could have become ES0 galaxies today regardless
of morphological evolution
In this paper we use stellar population synthesis models to estimate the implications
of the signatures of intermediate-age stars in ES0 galaxies in low-redshift clusters for the
photometric evolution of these galaxies at high redshifts when the stars formed Our main
purpose is to evaluate the minimum color evolution implied by the low-redshift spectral
analyses and hence to infer the additional evolution of colors or morphology needed
to explain the blue galaxy content of high-redshift clusters We rst describe in 2 the
signatures of the past history of star formation in the spectra of passively evolving galaxies
using new models of stellar population synthesis We use these arguments in 3 to interpret
the results of absorption-line studies of ES0 galaxies in low-redshift clusters z  04 in
terms of the average rate of star formation as a function of redshift in progenitors of ES0
galaxies z  1 We then compute in 4 the implied spectrophotometric evolution for
progenitors of ES0 galaxies at high redshift and compare this with direct observations
of galaxies in distant clusters We discuss in 5 the implications of our results for the
color and morphological evolution of galaxies in clusters Most of the arguments presented
 4 
throughout this paper pertain to the evolution of galaxies in the cores of rich concentrated
clusters
2 PREDICTIONS FROM POPULATION SYNTHESIS MODELS
We rst describe the signatures of the past history of star formation in the spectra of
passively evolving galaxies using the Bruzual  Charlot 1993 models of stellar population
synthesis The models have solar metallicity and include all phases of stellar evolution from
zero-age main sequence to supernova explosion for progenitors more massive than 8 M
or the end of the white-dwarf cooling sequence for less massive progenitors Most of the
stellar spectra were taken directly from observations of Galactic stars at near-ultraviolet
optical and near-infrared wavelengths and were extended into the far ultraviolet using
model atmospheres The main adjustable parameters in the population synthesis models
are the star formation rate and the initial mass function IMF Here we are primarily
interested in the evolution of galaxies which stop forming stars after a last burst of star
formation We consider two extreme histories of star formation for the underlying galaxy
a burst of duration 5  108 yr model elliptical galaxy and a constant star formation rate
model spiral galaxy In each case we assume that star formation stops when the galaxy
undergoes a last burst of star formation of duration 108 yr The age of the underlying ellip-
tical or spiral galaxy at this time and the mass fraction of the burst  dened throughout
this paper as the fraction of the nal mass in stars of the galaxy which is formed during
the burst  are kept as free parameters We further adopt in all models the Salpeter IMF
with lower and upper cutos of 01 and 100 M respectively
Figure 1 shows the evolution of the opticalinfrared colors and 4000 A break of the
model spiral and elliptical galaxies when the burst of star formation occurs at an age of 6
Gyr and involves 10 of the total mass we have adopted here the denition of the 4000
A break given by Bruzual 1983 ie the dimensionless ratio of the uxes in two bands just
 5 
redward and blueward of the 4000 A discontinuity Before the burst the colors of the
model elliptical galaxy redden rapidly as the most massive stars leave the main sequence
and the 4000 A break becomes strong the red phase around 1 Gyr which is mostly visible
in the I  K color is produced when stars on the asymptotic giant branch dominate the
spectrum see Bruzual  Charlot 1993 Meanwhile the colors and 4000 A break of the
model spiral galaxy remain almost constant since they are dominated by massive stars that
are continuously replenished on the main sequence During the burst at an age of 6 Gyr
the new input of massive stars blues the colors and reduces the 4000 A break temporarily
in both models From then on the evolution of the colors and 4000 A break depend only
weakly on the past history of star formation The dierence between the two models in
Figure 1 is less than 01 mag in all colors and less than 10 in the 4000 A break at all ages
after 6 Gyr Moreover the colors and 4000 A break at ages greater than 65 Gyr are nearly
the same as those of the model elliptical galaxy before the burst Hence we conclude from
Figure 1 that the age and history of star formation of a galaxy which has evolved passively
for several billion years cannot be determined from only the observed continuum emission
The situation is even further complicated when corrections for reddening have to be made
Fortunately more precise information on the past history of star formation in pas-
sively evolving galaxies can be learned from the absorption lines of hydrogen and of other
prominent atoms and molecules such as Mg Mg2 Fe Ca Na Sr and CN OConnell 1980
1986 Burstein et al 1984 Rose 1985 Couch  Sharples 1987 Pickles 1985 Worthey
Faber  Gonzalez 1992 Jablonka  Alloin 1993 We now illustrate this The medium
wavelength resolution and unique metallicity of the models used here restrict our analysis
to only a few absorption lines Two suitable examples are the equivalent width of the H
absorption line and the ratio of the central intensity of the combined CaII H and H lines
to the central intensity of the CaII line referred to as the CaII H  HCaII K index
Rose 1985 These features both hardly depend on metallicity Rose 1984 1985 The
 6 
CaII H  HCaII K index which is constant in F G and K stars drops signicantly in
A and B stars as the CaII lines weaken and the H-Balmer lines strengthen Therefore a
strong H absorption equivalent width indicates the presence of stars younger than about
2 Gyr and a strong CaII H  HCaII K index that of older longer-lived stars
We show in Figure 2 the evolution of the H absorption equivalent width and the
CaII H  HCaII K index as a function of U  V and V  K colors for the two models
of Figure 1 The evolution is shown starting from the age of 6 Gyr when the burst occurs
triangles At this age the model spiral galaxy has a stronger H equivalent width and
a weaker CaII H  HCaII K index than the model elliptical galaxy because it contains
some A and B stars Shortly after the burst at an age of 65 Gyr the U  V and
V  K colors of both models already approach those characteristic of passively evolving
galaxies see Fig 1 However the H equivalent width and CaII H  HCaII K index
continue to evolve signicantly for about 15 Gyr with a weak dependence on the past
history of star formation in the underlying galaxy In particular from 65 to 8 Gyr the
H absorption equivalent width of the model galaxies drops by an order of magnitude and
the CaII H  HCaII K jumps by more than 50 while the colors redden by less than
01 mag Therefore stellar absorption lines can reveal recent bursts of star formation in
galaxies with colors otherwise typical of old passively evolving stellar populations We
have considered here only the cases of the H equivalent width and CaII H  HCaII K
index whose sensitivities are limited to roughly 2 Gyr after a burst of star formation
However other combinations of prominent metallic features can help detect bursts of star
formation which are several billion years old eg Pickles 1985
Absorption-line strengths can also be used to untangle the competing eects of
metallicity and age on the spectra of passively-evolving galaxies Stars of increasing metal-
licity have redder colors and evolve more slowly eg Schaller et al 1992 Thus the age
assigned to a stellar population from its observed colors is a strong function of metallicity
 7 
Pickles 1985 1989 see also Pickles  van de Kruit 1988 has investigated the eects of age
and metallicity on galaxy spectra by using isochrone spectra of instantaneous-burst stellar
populations for six dierent ages between 2 and 15 Gyr and four metallicities between
00017 and 006 He showed that tight constraints on the age and metallicity of the various
generations of stars in a galaxy can be obtained by requiring the observed spectrum to be
tted with a combination of isochrone spectra which reproduces the prominent metallic
lines in addition to the continuum emission One then infers the fraction of light generally
in the optical region of the spectrum produced by stars of a given age Unfortunately we
cannot illustrate this method here because our population synthesis models are restricted
to solar metallicity We refer the reader to the studies by Pickles 1985 Jablonka  Alloin
1993 and Worthey 1993
We also emphasize here that the contribution to the optical light by the youngest
stars in a galaxy provides valuable information on the fraction of the galaxy mass involved
in the last major burst of star formation Figure 3 shows the evolution of the fractional
contribution to the visual luminosity of various model galaxies by stars created in a last
burst As expected the fraction of V light produced by new stars in a model elliptical
galaxy scales with the fraction of the galaxy mass involved in the last burst of star formation
Fig 3a The contribution peaks during the burst when new massive stars occupy the
main sequence and then drops to a nearly constant value For example when 2 and
10 of the stars are created during the burst their contribution to the V light 2 Gyr later
is 5 and 24 respectively The reason for the nearly constant contribution at late ages
is that the visual luminosity of a passively evolving stellar population changes only slowly
after a few billion years see Fig 1 of Bruzual  Charlot 1993 In fact this also implies
that the fraction of V light produced by young stars depends only weakly on the age of
the underlying population at the time of the burst as Figure 3b shows Figure 3c further
indicates that the predicted contribution by stars formed in a last burst to the visual
 8 
luminosity is only about 20 lower when the underlying galaxy is a model spiral instead
of elliptical galaxy Hence the contribution by young stars to the visual luminosity of a
passively evolving galaxy can be used to estimate the fraction of mass involved in the last
burst of star formation almost independently of the age and past history of star formation
of the underlying galaxy when the burst occured
3 RATE OF RECENT STAR FORMATION IN EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES
In this section we estimate the rate of recent star formation in early-type galaxies at
low redshifts z  04 from the absorption-line signatures of intermediate-age stars using
the models and arguments presented in the previous section Since we cannot directly
perform spectral analyses based on many spectral lines and include the eects of varying
metallicity we use here the results of several detailed absorption-line studies of low-redshift
ES0 galaxies that were published over the last few years These results are conveniently
expressed in terms of the fraction of the optical light of the galaxies accounted for by
stars formed in the last few billion years From the fractional contributions to the optical
light we can then securely estimate the mass of stars formed 2 The galaxies studied
at low redshifts were mostly selected from the eld but the few examples in clusters
present similar characteristics OConnell 1980 Burstein et al 1984 Rose 1985 Gonzalez
1993 At higher redshifts spectral analyses have mainly been performed on cluster galaxies
Dressler  Gunn 1982 1983 1992 Couch  Sharples 1987 Lavery  Henry 1988 Mellier
et al 1988 Pickles 1989 Jablonka  Alloin 1993 Most of the galaxies in question have
luminosities around L which correspond to masses in the range 05  15  1011h2M
We do not consider here the rst-ranked giant cD galaxies observed in some rich clusters
which have typical luminosities  10L and are believed to accrete up to 4075 of
their mass in a Hubble time by cannibalizing other cluster galaxies eg Lauer 1988 We
now interpret these observations
 9 
Rose 1985 has analyzed the absorption lines of a sample of 12 nearby ES0 galaxies
with luminosities in the range 001L  L  L He found that the CaII H  HCaII K
indices of the galaxies have a sharp distribution except for one outlier NGC 205 around
a mean value corresponding to the index of the prototypical elliptical galaxy M323 This
dwarf galaxy is one of the best studied nearby ES0 galaxies and it exhibits several
signatures of recent star formation Spinrad  Taylor 1969 Faber 1972 Pritchet 1977
OConnell 1980 1986 Burstein et al 1984 Rose 1985 Freedman 1992 The common
value of the CaII H  HCaII K index in nearly all the galaxies studied is signicantly
lower than the value expected from the proportions of main-sequence dwarfs and red giants
indicated by the Sr IIFe I indices Rose concludes that the discrepancy between the CaII H
 HCaII K and SrII Fe I indices implies that roughly 2 of the light at 4000 A in the
galaxies is produced by extra populations of A and B stars Since the evolutionary phase
of the stars is not known this sets an upper limit on the contribution by main-sequence
A and B stars with lifetimes less than 25 Gyr Using diagrams similar to those shown in
Figure 2 we infer that typically less than 05 of the mass in stars in nearby ES0 galaxies
have formed within the last 25 Gyr
The observed color dispersion of nearby ES0 galaxies provides another upper limit
on their young star content although this requires accurate photometry see Fig 1 Early-
type galaxies follow a color-magnitude relation which is generally attributed to an increase
in metallicity from faint to bright luminosities eg Faber 1977 Bower Lucey  Ellis
3 The weak dependence of the CaII H  HCaII K index on luminosity does not
contradict the increasing strength of prominent metallic lines Mg2 Fe etc of ES0
galaxies with luminosity In fact the latter is generally attributed to a change in metallicity
eg Worthey Faber  Gonzalez 1993 The CaII H  HCaII K index on the other
hand depends only weakly on metallicity Rose 1985
 10 
1992 Schweizer  Seitzer 1992 show that the departure of the U  B and B  V colors
of nearby ES0 galaxies from the mean color-magnitude relation correlates with their ne-
structure index a measure of dynamical youth and absorption-line strengths Thus the
dispersion of ES0 galaxies around the mean color-magnitude relation could originate at
least in part from an age dierence Schweizer  Seitzer consider a model in which they
assume that ES0 galaxies result from equal-mass mergers of two spiral galaxies of the same
type Sb-Sb or Sc-Sc They adopt three main parameters the star formation timescale
  of the model spiral galaxies 6 Gyr for Sb galaxies and 10 Gyr for Sc galaxies the mass
fraction  of the available gas converted into stars at the time of the merger typically
10 and the age of the spiral galaxies 15 Gyr Schweizer  Seitzer then use population
synthesis models to interpret the relative blueing of each of the 69 galaxies of their sample
in terms of the time tm elapsed since the merger The results range from 4  tm  10
Gyr for Sb-Sb mergers to 5  tm  11 Gyr for Sc-Sc mergers The galaxy mass fraction
converted into stars during the merger can then be expressed as  exptm  15  where
tm and  are in Gyr
ES0 galaxies at higher redshifts also show many signs of recent star formation
Dressler  Gunn 1983 1992 Lavery  Henry 1988 and Jablonka  Alloin 1993 have
discovered many red galaxies in clusters at 03  z  06 with strong Balmer absorption
lines characteristic of post-starburst spectra Pickles 1989 see 2 of the present paper has
spectroscopically evaluated the ages of young stellar populations and their contribution to
the visual luminosity in bright R  20 mag red B  R  20 mag galaxies in clusters
at redshifts between 018 and 039 with absolute luminosities 04L  L  25L To
increase the signal-to-noise ratio in the observations he coadded the spectra of the galaxies
observed in each of the six clusters in his sample distinguishing between a faint  L
and a bright  L class This procedure is justied by the small dierences in colors
and line strengths of individual spectra in a given class In fact the inferred fraction of
 11 
V light accounted for by young 26 Gyr stars appears to be roughly comparable for the
two luminosity classes in each cluster Therefore we adopt here the average over faint
and bright galaxies of the fraction of visual luminosity contributed by young stars as a
measure of the rate of recent star formation in ES0 galaxies in each cluster This fraction
appears to increase with redshift from about 7 at z  018 to about 12 at z  039
The population synthesis models indicate that the corresponding fraction of the galaxy
masses transformed into stars 2  6 Gyr earlier ranges from roughly 4 at z  018 to 8
at z  039
Couch  Sharples 1987 have also analyzed the stellar content of bright R 
20 mag red BJ  R  20 mag galaxies in three rich clusters at z  031 Unlike Pickles
1989 they identied marked dierences in the signatures of recent star formation among
the galaxies which they classied into normal ES0 galaxies 62 objects and ES0
galaxies with strong H absorption equivalent widths 11 objects with EWH 3 A
Couch  Sharples measured the CaII H  HCaII K indices of the coadded spectra of
the two types of galaxies but did not determine the relative contributions to the light by
main-sequence dwarfs and red giants An upper limit on the number of young A and B
stars however may be obtained from the dierence between the observed indices and the
value corresponding to the case of a red giant-dominated stellar population The result
is that less than 10 of the light at 4000 A in the normal ES0 galaxies is produced by
A and B stars This implies that less than 18 of the stars formed in the last 25 Gyr
The coadded spectrum of the strong-lined galaxies on the other hand is well tted by a
population synthesis spectrum in which 50 of the light at 4000 A is produced by 1015
Gyr old stars Allowing for the observed dispersion in H equivalent widths this would
imply that about 835 of the stars formed between 1 and 15 Gyr ago The relative
fractions of normal and strong-lined galaxies then suggest that on average ES0 galaxies
in clusters at z  031 formed less than about 15 of their stars in the last 25 Gyr and
 12 
roughly 1251 between 10 and 15 Gyr ago The mass fractions of young stars could
therefore be similar for the all the galaxies studied by Couch  Sharples the dierences
in H equivalent widths resulting from small dierences in the ages of these stars
Figure 4 summarizes the results of the previous paragraphs For consistency we
have reexpressed all the observational limits on the fraction of luminosity of ES0 galaxies
produced by young stars as limits on the contribution in the V band Fig 4a The ages
of the stars which vary from one observation to another are indicated in billion years
Figures 4b and 4c show the resulting limits on the mass fraction of stars formed in early-
type galaxies as a function of redshift We have reexpressed constraints on the age of stellar
populations as constraints on their redshift of formation for two cosmological models a
at universe with q0  05 and h  045 and an open universe with q0  01 and h  055
where h  H0100 km s1 Mpc1 Both correspond to a present age of the universe
of about 15 Gyr and lead to similar predictions Figure 4 shows that the mass fraction
of stars formed in ES0 galaxies increases with redshift from less than 1 at z  0 to
about 8 at z  1 This result was anticipated earlier by Pickles 1989 on the basis
of his data Moreover the upper limits set by Schweizer  Seitzer 1992 on past rate
of star formation in nearby eld galaxies for their two assumptions of Sb-Sb mergers and
Sc-Sc mergers obtained with an earlier version of the population synthesis models used
here Charlot  Bruzual 1991 bracket the results for cluster galaxies in Figure 4 Thus
recent star formation might be a generic feature of ES0 galaxies both in clusters and in
the eld
We show two other limits in Figure 4 One is the lower limit on the mass accretion
rate by L galaxies in a standard model of hierarchical clustering dashed line in Fig 4b
This is the minimum mass fraction accreted by an L galaxy to a given redshift in a cold
dark matter-dominated universe Carlberg 1990a 1990b Toth  Ostriker 1992 The
steep rise of this limit at high redshift is not in contradiction with our results because
 13 
some of the accreted material might already be in the form of old stars In a low-density
universe Fig 4c the crude limit on the mass accreted by an L galaxy obtained using the
scaling formulae of Carlberg 1990b is much lower Toth  Ostriker 1992 also derived an
upper limit on the mass of material accreted recently by spiral galaxies from the thinness
and coldness of their disks Although spiral and elliptical galaxies are generally found in
dierent environments it is interesting to see how this limit compares to that on the mass
of stars formed recently in ES0 galaxies According to Toth  Ostriker a typical giant
spiral galaxy must have accreted less than 4 of its disk mass in the last 5 Gyr This
is roughly 2 of the mass of a typical L ES0 galaxy since elliptical galaxies have an
average mass-to-light ratio twice that of spiral galaxies eg Faber  Gallagher 1979
This upper limit therefore compares with that obtained by Rose 1985 for ES0 galaxies
and is indicated by an open triangle in Figures 4b and 4c
The evolution of the star formation rate in ES0 galaxies shown in Figure 4 repre-
sents in reality an average over large redshift intervals as the horizontal error bars indicate
This result does not imply that ES0 galaxies should form stars at all times In fact the
ages of intermediate-age stars estimated from the absorption-line strengths in the spectra
of the galaxies are uncertain by a few billion years Fig 4a As Figure 1 shows when
a galaxy stops forming stars the colors reach the values characteristic of old passively
evolving stellar populations in less than 1 Gyr Thus although the galaxies in a given
cluster may present similar signatures of recent star formation there should be a disper-
sion in the ages and hence colors of galaxies around the mean epoch of star formation
predicted by Figure 4 The identication by Couch  Sharples 1987 of galaxies with
dierent Balmer-line strengths but associated with the same mass of new stars in clusters
at z  031 supports this expectation

4 IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC
EVOLUTION AT HIGH REDSHIFTS
The star formation rates obtained in the previous section imply that ES0 galaxies
in clusters have undergone spectrophotometric evolution at redshifts 0  z  11 We now
evaluate this evolution using the population synthesis models and compare our results with
observations of high-redshift clusters In particular Dressler  Gunn 1983 1990 1992
have obtained g r and i photometry of 15 rich clusters at redshifts 004  z  094 They
also measured the 4000 A breaks of bright r  22 mag galaxies in each cluster This
spectroscopic subsample may be slightly incomplete but is thought to include galaxies in
the full range of colors in representative proportions More recently Aragon-Salamanca et
al 1993 obtained V  I and K photometry of 10 rich clusters at redshifts 055  z  092
two of which belong to the Dressler  Gunn sample They selected the galaxies in the
K band as opposed to the r-band selection by Dressler  Gunn to reduce the chances
of biasing the sample toward blue objects However unlike Dressler  Gunn Aragon-
Salamanca et al do not have redshifts for their galaxies hence the most distant clusters
may be signicantly contaminated by foreground objects The clusters themselves in these
samples were selected from various catalogues for which the reddest lter corresponds to
the photographic N band e  8000 A The main results of these studies are that the
fraction of star-forming galaxies in clusters increases with redshift the Butcher-Oemler
eect and that beyond a redshift of about 07 the reddest galaxies in clusters show
evidence for evolution consistent with passive evolution the blueing of the red envelope
In the following we examine how the evolution of the colors and 4000 A break expected
from recent star formation in ES0 galaxies compares with the ranges of colors and 4000
A breaks of galaxies in these observations The distributions of the spectrophotometric
properties among galaxies in a cluster will be addressed in the next section
 15 
The history of star formation prior to the last major burst of star formation in
model galaxies is a free parameter since it has little inuence on the subsequent evolution
Fig 3 We recall that our main purpose in this paper is to evaluate the minimum
amount of evolution implied for ES0 galaxies in clusters by the signatures of recent star
formation We therefore consider a conservative model in which all ES0 galaxies are
assumed to initially be elliptical galaxies formed at a redshift zF  5 and to then undergo
bursts of star formation at various redshifts at the rate estimated previously from the low-
redshift signatures of intermediate-age stars we adopt throughout this section q0  05
and h  045 We will also discuss later the case of progenitor spiral galaxies and the
eect of changing zF The evolution of the V  K and I  K colors of the model elliptical
galaxy in the absence of late bursts of star formation is shown by the dashed lines in Figure
5 The colors are zero-pointed to the k-corrected colors of a non-evolving bright elliptical
galaxy which has V  K  325 and I  K  187 at z  0 for the lter response functions
adopted in Fig 5 Bruzual  Charlot 1993 As expected the model elliptical galaxy is
bluer at high redshifts than a non-evolving elliptical galaxy but has V  K  0 and
I  K  0 at z  0 ie at an age of about 135 Gyr for our adopted parameters
Also shown in Figure 5 are the observed colors of galaxies in high-redshift clusters from the
sample of Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 and in Figure 5a the V  K colors of galaxies
in the Virgo and Coma clusters from Bower et al 1992 The Butcher-Oemler eect and
the blueing of the red envelope at high redshift are mostly apparent in the V  K color
which is more sensitive than the I  K color to variations of the rest-frame blue light
The solid lines in Figure 5 show the eects of new bursts of star formation on the
color evolution of the model elliptical galaxy Again this is the minimum color evolution
expected for ES0 galaxies in clusters from their signatures of intermediate-age stars at
low redshifts The dierent curves on the gure correspond to the estimates at dierent
redshifts of the mean mass fraction of new stars in the progenitors of ES0 galaxies from
 16 
Figure 4b As expected the bursts of star formation temporarily blue the galaxies which
then rapidly recover the red colors characteristic of passively evolving stellar populations
see Fig 1 Figure 5 shows that the modest amount of star formation predicted for ES0
galaxies at high redshifts is sucient to explain the full range of blue colors seen in the
data We have checked that the increase of the color range with redshift is primarily
caused by the shift of the lters into the rest-frame ultraviolet which is more sensitive
to the presence of young stars than the optical and infrared light rather than by the
increase of the star formation rate The reason for this is that elliptical galaxies have
modest ultraviolet luminosities Thus for any amount of star formation blue massive
stars dominate the ultraviolet spectrum The strong dependence of the color range on
redshift is common to the models and data in Figure 5 However some of the observed
blue objects may be foreground galaxies Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993
We compare in Figure 6a the 4000 A break evolution of the model galaxies of
Figure 5 with the observed 4000 A breaks of galaxies in high-redshift clusters by Dressler
 Gunn 1990 For reference we also show the 4000 A breaks of eld ES0 galaxies from
Hamilton 1985 and Spinrad 1986 Again the Butcher-Oemler eect and blueing of the
red envelope are manifest in the cluster data In this case however the cluster memberships
of all galaxies are secure At z  0 the model elliptical galaxy has the standard B4000 22
of present-day ES0 galaxies Hamilton 1985 Spinrad 1986 Furthermore the bursts
of star formation at various redshifts produce small 4000 A breaks that can match the
observations The range of B4000 however does not depend on redshift as sensitively
as the range of colors considered previously because the 4000 A break samples the rest
frame spectra of the objects In fact galaxies with 4000 A breaks of about 12 are found
at all redshifts Hence if the signatures of intermediate-age stars in low-redshift ES0
galaxies are interpreted as recent bursts of star formation superimposed on old elliptical
galaxies the bluest colors and weakest 4000 A breaks observed for galaxies in high-redshift
 17 
clusters can be explained However the same range of spectrophotometric properties
could be obtained for much dierent amounts of star formation This emphasizes again
the usefulness of constraints from absorption-line studies of low-redshift cluster galaxies
Several galaxies in Figures 5 and 6a appear to have observed colors that are much
redder and 4000 A breaks that are much stronger than the model elliptical galaxy at
01  z  1 This deserves comment because old passively evolving stellar populations are
generally expected to generate the reddest spectra Extinction by dust is unlikely to be the
explanation for these red objects because the I K color appears to be at least as reddened
as the V  K color Furthermore dust has little inuence on the 4000 A break with B4000
increasing by less than 015 for an extinction AB  1 Another possible source of reddening
is metallicity The population synthesis models used here are limited to solar metallicity
However present-day elliptical galaxies are observed to have an average metallicity of
nearly twice solar with a dispersion of about 50 Gonzalez 1993 We have evaluated
the eect of increasing and decreasing the metallicity by a factor of two in the models
using recent stellar evolutionary tracks and model atmospheres for non-solar metallicities
by Schaerer et al 1993 and Kurucz 1992 see Charlot et al 1993 for details The
results indicated by the error bars in Figures 5 and 6 show that most of the red galaxies
can be understood as early-type galaxies with less than twice solar metallicities The few
galaxies with very red colors in Figure 5 could be background galaxies even though similar
objects do not seem to appear in control eld samples Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 A
possible explanation may be that they underwent recently a burst of star formation with
an IMF decient in low-mass stars Charlot et al 1993 This in fact could also explain
the very large 4000 A breaks of some cluster galaxies in Figure 6a
The predicted spectral evolution after the last major burst of star formation is
similar if cluster galaxies are assumed to be initially spiral instead of elliptical galaxies
In Figure 6b we show the evolution of the 4000 A break for models in which bursts of
 18 
star formation are added to progenitor spiral galaxies which formed stars continuously
since zF  5
In this case B4000 remains nearly constant as long as star formation is
maintained in the underlying spiral galaxy dashed line Then when a nal burst occurs
and star formation stops the 4000 A break increases rapidly as in the case of a progenitor
elliptical galaxy In fact as in Figure 6a the model galaxies in Figure 6b have at z  0 the
typical B4000 22 of present-day ES0 galaxies Hence we conclude from Figures 5 and
6 that the signatures of intermediate-age stars in low-redshift ES0 galaxies imply that
these galaxies could have been some of the objects with the bluest colors and weakest 4000
A breaks observed in high-redshift clusters This conclusion does not depend on the exact
fraction of stars thought to have formed recently in ES0 galaxies since similar ranges
of colors and 4000 A breaks could be obtained for dierent predictions Finally we note
that Figures 5 and 6 alone do not allows us to determine whether the progenitors of ES0
galaxies were preferentially spiral or elliptical galaxies in distant clusters
5 DISCUSSION
The main result of the previous sections is that a few billion years ago the progen-
itors of ES0 galaxies in present-day clusters were at least temporarily blued by modest
amounts of star formation Their colors and 4000 A breaks were then indistinguishable
from those of galaxies which make up the Butcher-Oemler eect We can use this result to
set constraints on the global evolution of galaxies in clusters in the following way The con-
servative model considered in 4 in which the progenitors of all ES0 galaxies are assumed
to be old elliptical galaxies undergoing late bursts of star formation provides a lower limit
to the fraction of blue galaxies expected to be found in clusters at high redshifts for two
reasons rstly ES0 galaxies could equally well be the products of blue spiral progenitor
galaxies Fig 6b and secondly ES0 galaxies represent on average only 8090 of the
 19 
galaxy population in the cores of rich concentrated nearby clusters The remaining galax-
ies are spiral and irregular galaxies These have colors systematically redder in clusters
than in the eld B  V   02 mag implying that many early-type spiral galaxies in
clusters have colors nearly as red as ES0 galaxies B  V  09 However the galax-
ies were presumably bluer in the past Hence by modelling the evolution of only ES0
galaxies and assuming that these were old elliptical galaxies which underwent late bursts
of star formation one obtains a lower limit on the fraction of blue galaxies in high-redshift
clusters Any excess of blue galaxies in the observed color distribution with respect to this
prediction may then be identied as spiral progenitors of ES0 galaxies or the progenitors
of present-day spiral galaxies or even galaxies which have since faded away
To investigate this further we now compute the expected distribution in a cluster
at a redshift z of the spectrophotometric property C for example a color of progenitors
of present-day ES0 galaxies under the conservative assumption that these were initially
elliptical galaxies formed at zF  5 The mean mass fraction of stars added to the galaxies
at z can be inferred from the observed trend in Figure 4b This fraction however could
have been added at any redshift in an interval z  z z  z corresponding to the
uncertainties of a few billion years on the ages of young stellar populations in low-redshift
ES0 galaxies Fig 4a Therefore the distribution of property C at a mean redshift hzi
can be expressed as
NC  Z z
zz
dz X tC z z
where P tC z z is the total time between z  z and z  z during which a galaxy
undergoing a burst at z is observed to have the property C Figure 4 indicates that z
and z correspond typically to uncertainties on the age of about 1 Gyr at z  05 and
2 Gyr at z  05
 20 
In the remainder of this paper we identify the spectrophotometric property C as
the 4000 A break for three main reasons 1 color distributions of distant cluster galaxies
are more dicult to interpret since they generally are subject to foreground contamination
eg Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 2 the 4000 A break has the advantage of sampling
directly the rest-frame spectra of galaxies while the interpretation of observed colors in-
volves k-corrections which depend on the unknown morphological types of the galaxies
and 3 the 4000 A break is much less sensitive than colors to the presence of dust in
the galaxies Charlot et al 1993 Figure 7 shows the expected distribution at dierent
redshifts of the 4000 A break of progenitors of low-redshift ES0 galaxies calculated using
the results of the previous section and equation 1 above We indicate for reference the
expected distribution of B4000 in the absence of late bursts of star formation ie for
elliptical galaxies evolving passively since zF  5 Fig 7a As expected the inclusion of
new bursts of star formation produces a tail at small B4000 in the histograms Fig 7b
The fraction of galaxies in the tail increases with redshift from about 12 at z  005 to
almost 30 at z  05 The reason for this is that the mass fraction of new stars and
hence the time during which these dominate the spectra of the galaxies increases with red-
shift Figs 3a and 4b The fraction of objects with 4000 A breaks smaller than passively
evolving galaxies drops again under 20 at redshifts z  07 because the model elliptical
galaxy still has a small 4000 A break at these early ages We note that shortening the
timescale of new bursts of star formation from our adopted value of 01 Gyr to 001 Gyr
would reduce the fraction of galaxies in the tail of the distribution by less than 1
In reality the 4000 A break of early-type galaxies also correlates with luminosity an
eect similar to the color-magnitude relation 3 Thus the distribution of 4000 A breaks
for ES0 galaxies in a cluster is expected to be broadened by their spread in luminosity The
most natural way to compare our predictions with observations would be to normalize the
4000 A breaks of a sample of observed galaxies to a xed absolute magnitude using the mean
 21 
B4000-magnitude relation in the sample eg Butcher  Oemler 1984 Unfortunately we
cannot use this approach here because the magnitudes of individual galaxies in the Dressler
 Gunn 1990 sample under consideration are not available Therefore we must include
in the models the inuence of the luminosity function of ES0 galaxies on the distribution
of 4000 A breaks We evaluate this eect using observations of galaxies in the Virgo cluster
We adopt the gaussian approximation of the B-band luminosity function of ES0 galaxies
in this cluster given by Sandage Binggeli  Tamman 1985 We may ignore dEdS0
galaxies since all galaxies in the Dressler  Gunn sample have luminosities larger than
01L Gunn 1989 Furthermore we estimate the B4000 V -magnitude relation for ES0
galaxies in Virgo using the recent determination of the U  V  V color-magnitude relation
by Bower et al 1992 and the tight correlation between B4000 and U  V color Aragon-
Salamanca et al 1993 The B4000 B-magnitude relation can then be evaluated using the
B  V  V color-magnitude relation Sandage 1972 This is the least certain step because
the B  V  V color-magnitude relation is not very tight Finally we obtain the relative
number of ES0 galaxies with a given 4000 A break from the B4000 B-magnitude relation
and B luminosity function
The distribution of B4000 obtained in this way for ES0 galaxies in the Virgo cluster
is close to a gaussian distribution with a mean of 213 and a standard deviation of about
015 For comparison the mean and standard deviation of the 4000 A breaks of eld
galaxies observed at hzi  005 are 219 and 013 respectively Hamilton 1985 Spinrad
1986 Here we are primarily interested in the dispersion of the B4000 distribution which
we include in the models by assuming that the distribution of 4000 A breaks of early-type
galaxies has the same shape at all redshifts as determined for ES0 galaxies in the Virgo
cluster The mean of the distribution on the other hand is taken to be the value predicted
by the models In particular at z  005 the model elliptical galaxy considered above has
B4000 221 We note that the similarity of the color-magnitude relations in Virgo Coma
 22 
and Abell 370 indicates that the dispersion in B4000 for early-type galaxies may in fact
not change signicantly out to at least z  04 Aragon-Salamanca Ellis  Sharples 1991
Since the dispersion in B4000 only pertains to ES0 galaxies we do not apply a correction
to model galaxies which have just undergone a new burst of star formation so long as the
amplitude of their 4000 A break is more than 02 smaller than the expected value for a
passively evolving galaxy at the same redshift
Figure 8a heavy histograms illustrates the broadening by the B4000-magnitude
relation of the predicted distributions of 4000 A breaks for the progenitors of ES0 galaxies
from Figure 7b Also shown are the observed distributions of 4000 A breaks for galaxies in
clusters at the same redshifts from the sample of Dressler  Gunn 1990 dotted histograms
these include the spiral galaxy population
It appears that as expected high-redshift
clusters contain signicantly more galaxies with small 4000 A breaks than predicted by
our conservative model To quantify this result we rst estimate the characteristics of
the dominant population of early-type galaxies with large 4000 A breaks at the various
redshifts in both the models and data We use the biweight central location and scale
estimators which are particularly suited for non-gaussian distributions with tails such as
those investigated here Beers Flynn  Gebhardt 1990 The resulting estimates of the
central locations are shown by arrows above the histograms in Figure 8a At z  05 the
predicted and observed distributions of B4000 for early-type galaxies have similar central
locations However the scale  an estimate of width  of the observed distributions
 025 is larger than that of the predicted distributions  015 This dierence appears
to result from an excess both of galaxies with unusually large breaks and of galaxies with
small breaks in the observed distributions
At z  07 galaxies with large 4000 A breaks are not observed and the early-type
population is no longer well dened This is the blueing of the red envelope discussed by
Dressler  Gunn 1990 and Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 In the models however
 23 
the distribution of early-type galaxies is still well dened at these high redshifts and the
central location decreases much more weakly The absence of galaxies with strong 4000
A breaks may not be common to all clusters at z  07
In fact this result has been
challenged by the recent discovery by Dickinson 1993 of several galaxies in two clusters
at z  12 with red R  K colors consistent with those predicted by our model elliptical
galaxy For reference we also show in Figure 8b the results obtained when the progenitor
elliptical galaxies of present-day ES0 galaxies are assumed to form at zF  2 instead of
zF  5 In this case the central locations of the observed and predicted histograms are in
slightly better agreement at high redshift and remain in good agreement at low redshift
The paucity of the observed sample at hzi  09 however does not allow us to favor a low
We can now investigate the fraction of galaxies with 4000 A breaks signicantly
smaller than ES0 galaxies in the histograms of Figure 8 We dene here the fraction
of galaxies with small 4000 A breaks in a cluster to be the fraction of the total cluster
population with B4000 at least 05 smaller than the central location of the model B4000
distribution This appears to be the minimum signicant dierence with respect to the 4000
A breaks of early-type galaxies common to all model histograms in Figure 8 triangles
In this denition we have used the central location of the predicted distribution because
it agrees with the observed one for z  04 and is more clearly dened at higher redshift
The resulting fraction of galaxies with small B4000 in Figure 8 is larger in the data than
in the models at all redshifts except for hzi  05 In fact the observed sample at this
redshift includes the cluster 001616 which is known to be particularly decient in blue
galaxies Koo 1981 Butcher  Oemler 1984 We then nd that for zF  5 the predicted
fractions of galaxies with small B4000 are 6 4 4 3 and 3 and the observed ones
are 10 19 4 27 and 33 at hzi  005 04 05 07 and 09 respectively The
 24 
model predictions are naturally lower than those obtained previously without including
the B4000-magnitude relation
The above results taken at face value suggest that under the most conservative
assumptions the signatures of recent star formation in low-redshift ES0 galaxies could
explain at least 60 21 100 11 and 9 of the observed population of star-forming
galaxies in clusters at hzi  005 04 05 07 and 09 respectively The prediction for hzi
 05 is probably not representative of most clusters since it is based on the unusual galaxy
population of 001616 Koo 1981 Butcher  Oemler 1984 Also the prediction for hzi
 005 follows from only an upper limit by Rose 1985 on the mass fraction of stars formed
over the last 25 Gyr in nearby ES0 galaxies and hence may be overestimated Despite
these uncertainties there appears to be a trend of increasing fraction of galaxies with
small 4000 A breaks in high-redshift clusters which cannot be explained by the occurence
of bursts of star formation in old elliptical galaxies According to the crude modelling
performed above this unaccounted fraction would represent at least 40 of the observed
star-forming galaxies at hzi  005 increasing to roughly 80 at hzi  04 and 90 at
hzi  07
The most natural explanation for the excess population of galaxies with small 4000
A breaks in distant clusters is to invoke spiral galaxies About 1020 of galaxies in
the cores of rich concentrated nearby clusters are of late type Butcher  Oemler 1978
However few of these galaxies are blue as many Sa and Sb galaxies have colors and
4000 A breaks comparable to those of ES0 galaxies Dressler  Schectman 1987 Oemler
1992 Hence if only 4 of red spiral galaxies in present-day clusters were blue at hzi
 005 and if most of them about 15 of the total cluster population were still blue at
hzi  04 the discrepancy between the predicted and observed fractions of galaxies with
small 4000 A breaks at z  04 in Figure 8a could be explained without having to invoke
morphological evolution of spiral into ES0 galaxies Fig 6b shows that star-forming spiral
 25 
galaxies at z  04 can have today a 4000 A break as strong as ES0 galaxies In fact
recent spectral analyses and HST observations indicate that many of the blue galaxies in
clusters at 03  z  04 are normal spiral or disky galaxies Couch et al 1993 Dressler
1993 Jablonka  Alloin 1993 At a redshift of 07 however the unaccounted fraction
of galaxies with small B4000 in Figure 8a is too high to be explained by the single color
evolution of spiral galaxies A possible explanation would be for these excess galaxies to
be spiral progenitors of present-day ES0 galaxies implying that morphological evolution
has played a major role early on in clusters Alternatively the excess star-forming galaxies
at z  07 could have faded away by the present epoch dynamical disruption top-heavy
IMF etc
Hence spectral analyses of low-redshift ES0 galaxies and the 4000 A break dis-
tributions of galaxies in distant clusters suggest that the Butcher-Oemler eect originates
from enhancement of the population of blue spiral galaxies at high redshift Out to a red-
shift z  04 the available data do not seem to require morphological evolution and can be
understood if the star formation eciency of spiral galaxies has declined substantially by
the present epoch Several processes have already been proposed for causing such a decline
see the review by Oemler 1992 ram-pressure stripping of the interstellar medium of the
galaxies through interactions with the hot intracluster medium galaxy-galaxy interactions
and mergers tidal interaction with the cluster gravitational potential and removal of the
external gas supply of galaxies by the dense cluster environment At z  07 on the other
hand more than simple color evolution seems to be required to explain the large fraction of
galaxies with small 4000 A breaks in the clusters observed by Dressler  Gunn 1990 A
natural explanation would be to invoke morphological evolution of spiral into ES0 galax-
ies but the excess population of star-forming galaxies could also have faded away by the
present time It appears therefore that direct morphological studies at high redshifts will
 26 
be the most secure way to draw more denite conclusions about the evolution of galaxies
in clusters
