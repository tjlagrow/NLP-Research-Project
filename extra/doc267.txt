Abstract
The secular evolution process which slowly transforms the morphology of a
galaxy over its lifetime could naturally account for observed properties of the
great majority of physical galaxies if both stellar and gaseous accretion pro-
cesses are taken into account As an emerging paradigm for galaxy evolution its
dynamical foundation had been established in the past few years and its obser-
vational consequences are yet to be fully explored The secular evolution picture
provides a coherent framework for understanding the extraordinary regularity
and the systematic variation of galaxy properties along the Hubble sequence

Introduction
The dominant view over the past few decades has been that the structural
properties of galaxies remain largely unchanged unless galaxies were perturbed
by violent events such as mergers Toomre  Toomre 1972 This view is
particularly favored by the currently popular hierarchical clusteringcold dark
matter CDM paradigm of structure formation and evolution Peebles 1993
and the references therein In the early 1980s photometric and kinematic ev-
idence in the buldges of late-type galaxies and hints from N-body simulations
of barred galaxies which incorporated a dissipative gas component prompted
several investigators to speculate that a fraction of late-type bulges might be
formed from gas accretion under the bar potential Kormendy 1982 Combes
 Sander 1981 These early observations and speculations have since been
further developed into one version of the secular evolution scenario which
emphasizes the role of dissipative gas accretion in the formation of the so-
called pseudo bulges in late type galaxies Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 and
the references therein
Even though the role of mergers during the early phases of galaxy assembly
is still to be assessed growing evidence has shown that at least since z  1
the rate of merger appears to have been signicantly reduced Conselice et al
2003 and during subsequent time the signicance of merger in transforming
galaxy morphology is likely to be overshadowed by the slower secular evolu-
tion process Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004
However secular evolution involving gas alone under barred potential leads
to some apparent paradoxes First of all as emphasized by Andredakis and
coworkers Andredakis Peletier  Balcells 1995 the continuity of the galaxy
properties across the entire Hubble sequence highlighted for example by the
continued variation of Sersic index n in tting the bulge surface density pro-
le indicates that there is not an apparent break in the formation mechanism
between the late-type disk galaxies and mid-to-early-type disk galaxies How-
ever due to the paucity of gas compared to stars in most galaxies manifest-
ing as a gaseous-to-stellar mass ratio of 110 or less which is true even for
high-redshift late-type disk galaxies presumably a result of rapid star forma-
tion following the accretion shocks of dissipative disk formation D Sanders

simply is not enough of a reservoir of gas for use to build up the bulges of
intermediate Hubble type galaxies such as our own which has a bulge mass
comparable to the disk mass not to say for galaxies of even earlier Hubble
types Secondly bulges of intermediate to early type galaxies including our
own consists mostly of stars of very old age Jablonka Gorgas  Goudfrooij
2002 and could not have been built up by the secular accretion of gas over
a Hubble time which subsequently formed stars Even though Kormendy and
Kennicutt 2004 argued that some of these bulges may be termed classical
ie they could have formed out of the dissipative collapse at an early stage of
galaxy formation they nonetheless pointed out that a good fraction of these
apparently old bulges have stellar kinematics which were rotation-dominated
and are related to the kinematics of their disks hinting at a secular evolution
origin for their formation
These and other apparent paradoxes such as the existence in some galax-
ies of dense core in the central region which appears to be formed by radial
gas accretion and yet is kinematically decoupled from the bulge stars can be
naturally resolved if we allow also the possibility of stellar accretion Such
a possibility was not explored in the past decades mainly due to a theoretical
barrier ie the well-known result that the stellar motion in a galaxy contain-
ing quasi-stationary non-axisymmetric patterns conserves the Jacobi integral
in the rotating frame of the pattern Binney  Tremaine 1987 and the orbital
motion of stars under such potentials generally will not exhibit secular delay
or increase since there is no wave and disk star interaction except at the wave-
particle resonances which are usually localized for quasi-steady wave patterns
Lynden-Bell  Kalnajs 1972
Generation of the Hubble Sequence
Physical Mechanisms for Producing the Secular
Morphological Evolution of Galaxies
It was rst demonstrated in Zhang 1996 1998 1999 that secular orbital
changes of stars across the entire galaxy disk are in fact possible due to the col-
lective instabilities induced by the unstable density wave modes such spirals
bars as well as by the skewed 3D density distributions reected in the twisted
isophotes of many high-redshift galaxies These skewed global patterns were
shown to lead to a secular energy and angular momentum exchange process be-
tween the disk matter and the wave pattern mediated by a local gravitational
instability or a collisionless shock at the potential minimum of the pattern
Zhang 1996 The integral manifestation of this process is an azimuthal phase
shift between the potential and density spirals which results in a secular torque
action between the wave pattern and the underlying disk matter As a result of
the torquing of the wave on the disk matter the matter inside the corotation
radius loses angular momentum to the wave secularly and sinks inward The
wave carries the angular momentum it receives from the inner disk matter to
the outer disk and deposits it there causing the matter in the outer disk to drift
further out
Closed form evolution rates can be derived for this process In the quasi
steady state the rate of angular momentum exchange between a skewed den-
sity wave pattern spiral bar etc and the basic state of the disk per unit area
is given by Zhang 1996 1998
r  
2 Z 2
1r 
V1r 
which for two sinusoidal waveforms is given by
r  m2AAV sinm0
where A and AV are the amplitudes of the density and potential waves re-
spectively and 0 is the phase shift between these two waveforms
The orbital decay rate it induced on a disk star or a gas clump can be
derived from equation 2 as
F 2v0 tani sinm0
where F is the fractional wave amplitude which is the geometric average of
the fractional density and potential wave amplitude v0 is the circular velocity
of the star i is the pitch angle of the spiral m is the number of spiral arms
respectively
From the above expressions we can easily see why the skewness of the pat-
tern is needed It is the skewness of the mass distribution which leads to the
potentialdensity phaseshift through the Poisson equation Zhang 1996 With-
out phaseshift there will be no secular angular momentum exchange between
the wave and the disk matter at the quasi-steady state and thus no secular mass
redistribution A perfect oval or triaxial mass distribution without any skew-
ness will not be the direct driver for secular evolution
For our own Galaxy if we assume that over the past Hubble time the Galac-
tic spiral pattern has an average 20 amplitude and 20 degree pitch angle the
orbital delay rate can be calculated using equation 3 to be about 2 kpc of or-
bital decay per Hubble time Therefore a star in the Suns orbit will not make it
all the way in to the inner Galaxy in a Hubble time However the correspond-
ing mass accretion rate across any Galactic radius inside corotation is about
6  109M per Hubble time A substantial fraction of the Galactic Bulge can
thus be built up in a Hubble time
Another important consequence of spiral-induced wave-basic state interac-
tion is the secular heating of the disk stars Since a spiral density wave can only
gain energy and angular momentum in proportion to the pattern speed p and
a disk star loses its orbital energy and angular momentum in proportion to its
circular speed  an average star cannot lose the orbital energy entirely to the
wave the excess energy serves to heat the star The resulting orbital velocity
diffusion rate is given by
D    pF 2v2
c tani sinm0
Using parameters appropriate for the Galaxy this can quantitatively explain
the observed age-velocity dispersion relation of the solar neighborhood stars
Zhang 1999 Wielen 1977 This secular heating process since it originates
from a local gravitational instability at the arms serves to increase all three
space velocities of stars The vertical component of the velocity dispersion al-
lows the stars to gradually drift out of the galactic plane as they spiral inward
to become bulge stars The corresponding energy injection into the interstel-
lar medium if used as the top-level energy input for turbulence cascade can
quantitatively account for the size-linewidth relation of the Galactic molecular
clouds Zhang et al 2001 Zhang 2002
The secular morphological evolution process leads to the Hubble type of an
average galaxy to evolve from the late to the early Zhang 1999 The secular
evolution speed is expected to be faster for cluster galaxies than for isolated
eld galaxies which were observed to evolve slowly because the rate of sec-
ular evolution is proportional to the wave amplitude squared and pattern pitch
angle squared see eg equations 3 4 and cluster galaxies are found to have
large amplitude and open spiral patterns excited through the tidal interactions
with neighboring galaxies and with the cluster potential as a whole This natu-
rally accounts for the morphological Butcher-Oemler effect
Generation of the Hubble Sequence
The secular evolution of galaxies through the internal process mediated by
skewed non-axisymmetric patterns is a rigorous consequence of the Newtonian
dynamics and the assumption of global self-consistency The analytical equa-
tions for the evolution rates equations 3 and 4 are quantitatively conrmed
in N-body simulations Zhang 1998 Detailed comparison of the predictions
of the secular evolution theory with the observed galaxy properties and with
other theories of galaxy evolution can be found in Zhang 2003 In what fol-
lows we will highlight the role of secular evolution in generating the structural
properties and scaling relations of galaxies
Generation of the Structural Properties of Galaxies
Along the Hubble Sequence through Secular Evolution
The properties of disk galaxies vary systematically along the Hubble se-
quence from the late to the early Hubble types An important descriptor of
the structural characteristics of disk galaxies is the rotation curve After as-
sembling hundreds of observed rotation curves for nearby disk galaxies Per-
sic Salucci  Stel 1996 found that these rotation curves fall onto a two-
dimensional surface in the three-parameter space of normalized galactic radius
velocity and the absolute magnitude Since for the nearby galaxies the varia-
tion of the absolute magnitude corresponds to the variation of Hubble type ie
bigger and brighter galaxies generally have earlier Hubble types this means
that the rotation curve shapes also vary systematically for galaxies of varying
Hubble types In Figure 1 we plot three typical rotation curves generated using
the data from Persic et al 1996
Using dynamical relations for equilibrium axisymmetricspherically sym-
metric mass distributions ie V R2  GMdynR
 as well as MdynR 
0 projr2rdr  R R
0 r4r2dr where MdynR is the dynamical or to-
tal mass within a galactic radius R including the contributions from both the
luminous and the dark components and projR is the total projected sur-
face density disk plus spheroidal at radius R we can infer the underlying
mass and surface density distributions corresponding to the different regimes
for each type of rotation curves cf Figure 1
I Steeply rising solid body rotation curve as observed for the inner regions
of early type galaxies
This regime is characterized by solid body rotation   0  constant or a
nearly linear rise of rotation velocity V R  0R Using V R2  2
GMdynR we obtain Mdyn  0R3
G  which implies a constant volume density
  0  0

equating MdynR  R R
4 R30 which
gives projR  20R ie the solid-body regime corresponds to a constant
column density 0 and linearly rising projected surface density projR  R
0 projr2rdr and MdynR  3
Typical rotation curves for disk galaxies of varying absolute magnitudes as well

bottom M24 where M is the absolute magnitude of the representative galaxy data from
Persic et al 1996
II Gently rising rotation curve as representative of the very late type disks
including most of the dwarf galaxies and low-surface-brightness LSB disk
galaxies
This regime can be shown to correspond to approximately constant pro-
jected surface density as found to be the case for many LSB disks Assume
projR  0  constant we obtain MdynR  R R
0 02rdr  0R2
which we equate to V R2RG to obtain V R2  0RG which indeed
corresponds to a gently rising rotation curve
Instead of constant projected surface density many LSBs are found to have
instead constant volume density de Blok 2003 These two views constant
projected surface density or constant mass volume density can be consistent
if the scale height in the central regions of these LSBs are nearly constant as
for a pancake-type proto galaxy cloud collapse
III Flat rotation curve as is representative of the outer part of most SbSc
galaxies
In this regime the projected surface density prole should be close to 1R
as shown below Assume projR  0R0
R  where 0  projR  R0
we have MdynR  R R
0 projr2rdr  0R02R Using again V R2 
GMdynR we obtain V R2  G0R02RR or V R  G0R02 
constant Therefore the at rotation curve regime corresponds to 1R projected
surface density distribution
IV The falling rotation curve regime as representative of the outer part of
the early type galaxies
In this regime the projected surface density projR falls off faster than
1R and can be up to proj  0 Keplerian For the extreme case of Keplerian

0 and V R2  GMdyn
R  which is indeed falling
R  or V R  q GMdyn
In the secular evolution scenario a typical galaxy starts its life with proper-
ties similar to that of an LSB galaxy The high-z correspondence of the local
LSBs appears to be the damped L system Wolfe 2001 which also possesses
disk-like morphology with large scale length and a constituting mass compo-
nent which is gas rich and metal poor
As the proto galaxy disk contracts and condenses the global spiral insta-
bility develops which begins the mass-redistribution process that transforms
the at surface density distribution to a more and more centrally concentrated
mass distribution The intermediate stage of this evolution resembles Free-
mans type II disks Freeman 1970 and the later stage with a a 1R projected
surface density resembles a Freemans type I disk
As the evolution progresses the inward-accreted disk stars rise out of the
disk plane to become bulge stars The thermalized three-dimensional bulge
mass will have nearly constant volume density and undergoes solid-body rota-
tion The outer part of the visible disk starts to be drained of matter producing
the falling rotation curve
This entire evolution sequence therefore corresponds to a galaxy evoling
from the lower rotation curve to the upper rotation curve in Figure 1
The twisted isophotes often found for the Hubble Deep Field galaxies are
expected to evolve into the observed variation of major axis with radius for
elliptical galaxies Faber  Jackson 1976 possibly bypassing the disk for-
mation phase at least for some galaxies Like the spiral structure the twisted
isophotes are results of dissipation and differential rotation and just as in the
case of spiral structure these three-dimensional skewed structures will also
lead to a phaseshift between the potential and density distributions resulting
in accelerated secular morphological changes
Generation and Evolution of the Galaxy Scaling
Relations Along the Hubble Sequence
Galaxy scaling relations Faber  Jackson 1976 Tully  Fisher 1977 Djor-
govski  Davis 1987 Dressler et al 1987 own their existence rst and fore-
most to the fact that galaxies are equilibrium congurations and satisfy the
Virial theorem relation see eg Binney  Tremaine 1987 This relation
dictates that during any quasi-equilibrium evolution process of a gravitational
system E  T  V 2 where T is the kinetic energy V is the potential
energy and E  T  V is the total energy of the system The fact that spiral
galaxies can remain on the Tully-Fisher relation during secular morphological
evolution despite the fact that stars cant radiate about 12 of the converted po-
tential energy away is due to the fact that spiral density wave actually carries
about 12 of the dissipated orbital energy equal to potential energy away to
the outer disk to be deposited there Zhang 1999 The existence of a collective
dissipation process at the spiral arms also made possible the regulated conver-
sion of orbital velocity to random velocity so a single kinetic energy the half
that is not being carried away can enter the Virial relation no matter how it is
apportioned between the circular and the random motions
According to the Virial theorem we set G1 in the following derivations
of scaling relations Mdyn  V 2
e Re where Mdyn is the dynamical mass of
a galaxy Ve is the effective velocity spread which corresponds to the total
velocity dispersion for an elliptical galaxy or the maximum rotation velocity
for a spiral galaxy and Re is an effective radius which makes the Virial relation
Dene the mean surface brightness of a galaxy SB as SB  L
where L
is the luminosity of the galaxy and the dynamical mass-to-light ratio MdynL
can be written as Mdyn  MdynL  L Therefore it follows that
MdynL2  L2  M 2
dyn  V 4
e R2  V 4
MdynL2L 
Therefore we nally have from
L  V 4
MdynL2 
We thus see that in order to obtain the classical Tully-Fisher relation which has
L  V 4
e  we must have SB  MdynL  constant This can be accomplished
in two ways to have SB and MdynL each being constant or to have the
variations of the two factors offset each other during an evolution process
Traditionally the former was assumed to be the case see eg the discus-
sions and references in Shu 1982 It is now known that both these quantities
vary considerably for galaxies along the Hubble sequence The surface bright-
ness is found to be higher for earlier type galaxies McGaugh  de Blok 1998
and the references therein whereas the dynamical mass-to-light is found to be
lower for the earlier Hubble types Zwaan et al 1995 Bell  de Jong 2001
The observed opposing trends of variation of surface brightness and dynamical
mass-to-light ratio is naturally explained as the outcome of the secular baryonic
mass accretion and the increase fraction of luminous baryon mass especially
towards the central region of a galaxy as its Huuble type evolve from late to
early The Tully-Fisher relation can be maintained as long as the increase in
surface brightness is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the dynam-
ical mass to light ratio during the secular evolution process
Generation of the Hubble Sequence
In the secular evolution scenario since most of the elliptical galaxies ie
those lower luminosity so-called disky ellipticals are the end results of evo-
lution from the initial condition of disks we speculate that spiral galaxies may
satisfy similar kind of fundamental plane relation just as ellipticals This has
been found to be so see eg Pharasyn Simien  Heraudeau 1997 The
fundamental plane relation for spirals can likewise be derived from the Virial
theorem Starting from
 L12
12 Mdyn
we have
which leads to
10 log Ve  1  2Mt  e  constant
where Mt is the absolute magnitude and e is the face-on average surface
brightness in magarcsec2 and where we have assumed MdynL  L Pha-
rasyn et al 1997 found that tting I band and K band data of a sample of
spiral galaxies to this relation resulted in   015 ie the mass-to-light ra-
tio slightly decreases with increasing luminosity which is consistent with what
we would expect from a secular evolution picture ie as the secular evolution
advances L increases and MdynL decreases
The fundamental plane relation for elliptical galaxies and bulges were rst
obtained by Faber et al 1987 Djorgovski  Davis 1987 and Dressler et
al 1987 One type of the fundamental plane relation for ellipticals can be
written as cf equation 2a and 2b of Djorgovski  Davis 1987
This relation can be re-written into the form
L  V 345
SB086
MtRe  862log Ve  01e  constant
which can be further written as we arrive at
10 log Ve  125M Re  e  constant
Comparing equations 10 and 13 we see that apart from a possible differ-
ence in the constant term accounting for the change in total luminosity the
only difference between the spiral and elliptical fundamental plane relations
is in the different sign of the mass-to-light ratio exponent    015 for
spirals and   013 for ellipticals and bulges where  is dened through
MdynL  L This difference is apparently brought about by the fact that
spiral galaxies still have varying reserves of baryonic dark matter to form stars
therefore as the secular evolution proceeds and therefore L increases the
mass-to-light ratio decrease whereas elliptical galaxies have essentially ex-
hausted their central baryonic dark matter supply thus the ellipticals in more
advanced stage of evolution which also generally have larger L will experi-
ence greater degree of dimming which is reected in the increase of mass-to-
light ratio with L
