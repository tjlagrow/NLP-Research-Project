Abstract Large volume cosmological simulations succeed in reproducing the large-scale struc-
ture of the Universe However they lack resolution and may not take into account all relevant
physical processes to test if the detail properties of galaxies can be explained by the CDM
paradigm On the other hand galaxy-scale simulations could resolve this in a robust way but
do not usually include a realistic cosmological context
To study galaxy evolution in cosmological context we use a new method that consists in
coupling cosmological simulations and galactic scale simulations For this we record merger and
gas accretion histories from cosmological simulations and re-simulate at very high resolution the
evolution of baryons and dark matter within the virial radius of a target galaxy This allows us
for example to better take into account gas evolution and associated star formation to nely
study the internal evolution of galaxies and their disks in a realistic cosmological context
We aim at obtaining a statistical view on galaxy evolution from z  2 to 0 and we present
here the rst results of the study we mainly stress the importance of taking into account gas
accretion along laments to understand galaxy evolution

1 Introduction
The morphology of galaxies in the Local Universe is well constrained by observa-
tions but is still largely unexplained Indeed large volume cosmological simulations
fail to reproduce realistic galaxies For instance the disks formed are often too con-
centrated  it is the angular momentum problem well known since the early work
of Navarro  Benz 1991 It is still unclear whether this is an intrinsic problem of the
CDM paradigm or if something ie resolution physical processes is missing in these
simulations
Another puzzle is the question of disk survival till z0 Koda et al 2007 For in-
stance Kautsch et al 2006 study a large sample of edge-on spiral galaxies in the SDSS
and nd that a signicant fraction of them ie roughly one third are bulgeless or
superthin This is still unexplained by cosmological models Indeed CDM predicts
that galaxy interactions are frequent see eg the recent work by Stewart et al 2007
More exactly major mergers that are well known to destroy disks to form ellipticals
Barnes  Hernquist 1991 are rather rare but minor mergers are much more com-
mon These minor mergers can thicken disks and if frequent enough could even form
elliptical galaxies Bournaud et al 2007 The problem is then to nd whether CDM
predicts too many mergers or if the satellites have properties and orbital parameters such
that they have little inuence on the galactic disks Also gas accretion along laments
could fuel a thin disk and counteract the eect of mergers Dekel  Birnboim 2005

To study the properties of galaxies at low and high redshift it thus seems necessary
to take the full cosmological context into account Large scale cosmological simulations
could of course achieve this goal and give a statistical view on galaxies at each redshift
but for now they mainly lack resolution at the galactic scale On the contrary small
volume cosmological simulations like the one performed by Naab et al 2007 can resolve
galactic scales in detail but are so time-consuming that obtaining a statistical sample is
for now a challenge
A rst method to solve these problem is to use semi-analytical models ie extracting
merger trees from cosmological simulations and using dierent recipes to infer physical
properties of galaxies Somerville et al 2001 Hatton et al 2003 Khochfar  Burkert 2005
The drawback is that approximations are necessary
Another possibility has been explored by Kazantzidis et al 2007 Read et al 2007
and Villalobos  Helmi 2008  they extract merger histories from cosmological simu-
lations and re-simulate these histories at higher resolution Nevertheless they perform
collisionless simulations with no gas component neither in the main galaxy nor in satel-
lites nor in laments
We here present a new approach where we re-simulate at high resolution a history given
by a cosmological simulation using self consistent realistic galaxies the main galaxy and
the satellites have a gas disk a stellar disk and a dark matter halo and we also take into
account gas accretion from cosmic laments Our goal is to obtain a statistical sample
of merger and accretion histories in a CDM context to simulate the resulting galaxies
and to compare our results to observations at various redshifts
After a description of the technique used we will present our rst results and emphasize
the importance of gas accretion along laments to understand galaxy evolution
2 Method
21 Analysis of the cosmological simulation
Merger histories and accretion data are extracted from a dark matter only cosmological
simulation performed with the AMR code RAMSES Teyssier 2002 This simulation
has an eective resolution of 5123 and a comoving box length of 20 h1 Mpc The
mass resolution is 69106 M so that a Milky Way type halo is made of a few 105
particles The cosmology is set to CDM with m03 07 H070 kms1Mpc1
and 809
In this simulation halos are detected with the HOP algorithm Eisenstein  Hut 1998
with peak240 saddle200 and outer80 the minimal number of particles per halo is
xed to 10 In the following we also take into account particles that do not belong to a
halo and we consider them as diuse accretion
The halo of which we want to build the merger and accretion history is then chosen
in the nal snapshot of the simulation at z  0 and is traced back to higher redshift
typically z  2  we will call it the main halo From z  2 to z  0 each halo or
particle in the case of diuse accretion entering a sphere around the main halo the
radius of this sphere is the virial radius of the main halo at z0 is recorded with its
mass position velocity and spin spin is of course omitted for diuse accretion

The history that has been extracted from the cosmological simulation is re-simulated
with a particle-mesh code Bournaud  Combes 2002 Gas dynamics is modeled with a

galaxy seen face-on and edge-on each panel is 40 kpc x 40 kpc in size Right  large scale view
of the gas distribution in a simulation box the panel is 440 kpc x 440 kpc in size
sticky-particle scheme with r08 and t07 and star formation is computed according
to a Kennicutt law with an exponent 15
The maximum spatial resolution is 130 pc For the two simulations shown hereafter
the mass resolution varies from 12104 M to 21104 M for gas particles from 6104
M to 14105 M for stellar particles and from 12105 M to 44105 M for dark
matter particles This allows to have a total number of particles of the order of 15106
at the end of both simulations
222 Model galaxies
Each halo of the cosmological simulation ie the main halo as well as all the interacting
satellites is replaced with a realistic galaxy having a disk a bulge and of course a dark
matter halo The total mass of the galaxy is divided in 20 of baryons and 80 of dark
matter the mass of dark matter being given by the cosmological simulation The dark
matter halo follows a Burkert prole extended to its virial radius with a core radius
chosen to follow the scaling relations given in Salucci  Burkert 2000 The disk radius
of each galaxy is proportional to the square root of its mass so that the surface density
is constant from one galaxy to another
The gas fraction in the disk is 30 for galaxies that have a halo mass lower than
1011 M For galaxies that have a greater halo mass the gas fraction is set to 30 at
high redshift z08 and 15 at low redshift
Figure 1 left side shows for example the initial distribution of gas and stars in the
main galaxy
223 Diuse accretion
Each dark matter particle that is considered as diuse accretion in the cosmological
simulation is replaced with a small blob of particles containing in mass 20 of gas and
80 of dark matter
The right side of gure 1 shows an example of simulation where the main galaxy edge-
on is surrounded by accreted gas clearly in a lament and a few satellite galaxies

time for the two simulations studied here  in the left case the mass growth is dominated by
accretion and in the right one by mergers
23 Two examples
We present here the rst results concerning two simulations that have been chosen to
have a mass at z0 of the order of magnitude of the mass of the Milky Way They have
very dierent histories
In the the rst one the mass growth of the galaxy is dominated by diuse accretion
at a mean rate of  5 Myr Only some very minor mergers take place the most
important of these mergers having a mass ratio of 121 see on the left panel of gure 2
the mass evolution as a function of time We will call this simulation the calm case
The other simulation also contains diuse accretion but is mainly dominated by merg-
ers There is a rst period of repeated minor and major mergers mass ratios 81 101
31 and 41 at the very beginning of the simulation then a calm phase and nally a
major merger mass ratio 151 at low redshift see right panel of gure 2 We will call
it the violent case
3 Results
31 The calm case
The evolution of the distribution of gas and stars is shown in gure 3 Gas is smoothly
accreted around the galaxy and falls onto the disk Minor mergers are not strong and
frequent enough to destroy the stellar disk They only slightly heat it and a thin stellar
disk is rebuilt thanks to gas from diuse accretion along the laments The thin disk is
mainly formed from stars younger than 4 Gyr and has a well-dened structure with two
spiral arms
32 The violent case
In this case the evolution of the morphology of the galaxy is totally dierent see gure
4 The disk is destroyed early by the rst series of mergers In fact after the rst of
these mergers which has a mass ratio of 81 the disk is already very perturbed and the
following mergers contribute to the transformation of the galaxy into an elliptical
Nevertheless thanks to gas accretion that takes place along a lament a gas disk is
gradually re-built into the elliptical galaxy this would not happen if only mergers were
taken into account in the simulation New stars form in this disk forming a young stellar
disk inside the old spheroid see gure 5 this disk being in a perpendicular plane with
respect to the initial disk Finally the last major merger with a mass ratio of 151
destroys this disk and the galaxy becomes elliptical again

4 Conclusion
In order to study galaxy evolution in cosmological context we have successfully de-
veloped a technique that allows us to perform high resolution simulations taking into
account realistic merger and gas accretion histories
The rst two simulations shown here do not allow us to draw any general conclusion
on galaxy evolution in a CDM context Nevertheless we can already conrm that even
low mass satellites can thicken disks and that ellipticals from both through repeated
minor mergers and major mergers We also emphasize that gas accretion from laments
can allow to rebuild a thin disk in a galaxy which proves the absolute necessity to take
this accretion into account to understand galaxy evolution
