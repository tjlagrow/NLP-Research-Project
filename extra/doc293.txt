ABSTRACT
We report on a uniform comparative analysis of the fundamental parameters of earlytype galaxies
at z1 down to a well dened magnitude limit MB  200 in the eld and MB  205 in the
clusters The changes in the MLB ratio from z1 to today are larger for lower mass galaxies in
all environments and are similar in the eld and in the clusters for galaxies with the same mass By
deriving ages from the MLB ratio we estimate the formation redshift for early-type galaxies as a
function of galaxy mass and environment We nd that the age of early-type galaxies increases with
galaxy mass downsizing in all environments and that cluster galaxies appear to have the same age
within 5 as eld galaxies at any given galaxy mass The rst result conrms similar ones obtained
by other means while the second one is controversial The most recent incarnation of the hierarchical
models of galaxy formation and evolution is capable of explaining the rst result but predicts that
cluster galaxies should be older than eld galaxies We also nd a total lack of massive earlytype
galaxies M  31011M with a formation redshift smaller than 2 which cannot be due to selection

1 INTRODUCTION
Earlytype galaxies ETG contain most of the visible
mass in the Universe Renzini 2006 and are thought
to reside in the highest density peaks of the underlying
dark matter distribution Therefore understanding their
evolution is crucial for understanding the evolution of
galaxies and structures in general In the 3-dimensional
space of their main parameters the eective radius Re
the central velocity dispersion  and the average surface
luminosity within Re hIie  L2R2
e ETG concentrate
on a plane thus called the Fundamental Plane FP Djor-
gowski  Davis 1987 Dressler et al 1987 This implies
that besides being in virial equilibrium ETG show a
striking regularity in their structures and stellar popula-
tions eg Renzini  Ciotti 1993 which allows at least
at a rst order to use their main observables for deriving
the galaxy mass and ML ratio For instance assuming
R14 homology the mass is given by Michard 1980 see
also Cappellari et al 2005
M  5Re2G
Moreover the slope of the FP can be interpreted as a
systematic variation of the ML ratio along the plane
by a factor of  3 eg Ciotti Lanzoni  Renzini 1996
At high redshift the FP is known to stay thin and its
intercept shows an oset with respect to the local one
that corresponds to a change in ML consistent with
Electronic address sperelloarcetriastroit
passive luminosity evolution see Renzini 2006 and ref-
erences therein
If ascribed to dierences in the stel-
lar populations the observed changes in the ML ratio
can be used to infer the ages of ETG We report on a
comparative analysis of the best data on the fundamen-
tal parameters of ETG at z1 the highest redshift for
which these data are currently available obtained from
recent spectroscopic observations with 8-10m class tele-
scopes complemented with deep imaging with the Hub-
ble Space Telescope Using the Universe as a time ma-
chine and proting from the large leverage provided by
the redshift we infer ages for ETG and analyse them as
a function of galaxy mass and environment We assume
a at Universe with m  03   07 and H0  70
km s1Mpc1 and we use magnitudes based on the Vega
system
2 BACKGROUND
studies
di Serego Alighieri et al
Treu et al 2005 van der Wel et al 2005 of the FP
of ETG in the eld at z1 in the rest-frame B-band
down to relatively faint luminosities MB  200 and
hence small masses demonstrate that
in addition to
the oset the FP at z1 also shows a dierent slope
This implies that the galaxy MLB ratio evolves with
redshift in a way that depends on the galaxy mass
By comparing the MLB ratio of eld ETG to that
of massive M  1011M ETG in clusters a faster
evolution of MLB for the less massive galaxies has
been derived and it is interpreted as a manifestation of
downsizing ie the tendency of smaller galaxies to have
di Serego Alighieri et al
later or more prolonged star formation histories than
the massive ones Cowie et al 1996
Very recently the high-z FP of the ETG has been stud-
ied in two clusters RX J015271357 at z0835 and RX
J122693332 at z0892 reaching a similarly faint lim-
iting absolute magnitude MB  205 also in the rest-
frame B-band Jrgensen et al 2006 This has pointed
out that also in the clusters the slope of the FP changes
with redshift a manifestation of downsizing even in high
density environments
Unfortunately because of an error in the calibration of
the galaxy luminosities used by Jrgensen et al 2006
the photometry for the two clusters should be oset to
brighter luminosities with a factor 1  z Correcting
for this error corresponds to an oset in logL to brighter
luminosities with log1z which is 026 and 028 for RX
J015271357 z  0835 and RX J122693332 z 
0892 respectively Therefore the cluster data which we
have used in the published version of this letter ApJ 647
L99 should be changed and we present here a corrected
version of our original letter see also the Erratum to

3 THE FORMATION EPOCH OF CLUSTER AND FIELD
EARLYTYPE GALAXIES
We make a uniform comparison of these results on the
high redshift FP Fig 1 and on the consequent vari-
ations of the MLB ratio Fig 2 both in the eld
by using the samples of di Serego Alighieri et al 2005
and of Treu et al
2005 and in the clusters by using
the sample of Jrgensen et al
2006 As a reference
in the local Universe we use new data for the Coma
cluster Jrgensen 1999 Jrgensen et al 2006 The
gures show that the change in MLB between ETG
at high redshift and the local ones decreases with the
galaxy mass and is very similar in the clusters and in
the eld However since the clusters are at a slightly
lower redshift a deeper analysis is necessary to show this
more clearly The usual way to achieve this purpose is
to compare the MLB ratio of the high redshift ETG
with the corresponding ratio obtained for massive M 
1011M cluster ETG at the same redshift as compiled
and parameterized by van Dokkum  Stanford 2003
However this analysis is unsatisfactory since the mas-
sive cluster ETG are not necessarily a uniform class
and by construction such a procedure prevents one
from studying the lower mass cluster galaxies What
is of interest is how the star formation history of ETG
or at least their average stellar age depends on both
galaxy mass and environment We analyse this by in-
terpreting the changes in MLB as dierences in the
ages of the stellar populations1 While the star for-
mation histories of some ETG could have had multi-
ple episodes of star formation Treu et al 2005 we
can only estimate luminosity weighted average stellar
ages by using single stellar population models We
therefore infer galaxy ages using the relation between
MLB and age obtained by evolutionary population
1 It has been shown that other possible interpretations ie sys-
tematic structural changes and partial support by rotation can
only explain a small fraction of the observed dierential evolution
of MLB  and that this evolution correlates with the rest-frame
U  B colour thereby providing independent evidence for changes
in the stellar populations di Serego Alighieri et al 2005
synthesis models Maraston 2005 see also httpwww-
astrophysicsoxacukmarastonSSPnml and as-
suming that the model stellar mass is proportional to
the dynamical mass obtained from equation 1 Since
the MLage relation depends both on the stellar initial
mass function IMF and on the metallicity we adopt
a Kroupa 2001 IMF which is known to better repro-
duce the characteristics of low and high redshift galaxies
Moreover we estimate the galaxy metallicity from the ob-
served velocity dispersion following Thomas et al 2005
see also Annibali et al 2006 and we assume that this
relationship does do not evolve with redshift as in the
case of passive evolution Given the values of MLB and
metallicity for every galaxy in our sample ages have been
inferred by means of a spline interpolation of the popu-
lation synthesis model results Then the lookback time
to formation has been derived by using the Universe as a
time machine and exploiting the large leverage provided
by the considerable distance of the observed ETG The
uncertainties on the age estimates have been computed
taking into account the known errors in MLB as well
as the uncertainties on the estimated metallicities due
to the known errors in the velocity dispersion measure-
ments and to the observed scatter in the metallicity vs
velocity dispersion relation Thomas et al 2005
The resulting formation epochs of ETG are shown in
Figure 3 as a function of galaxy mass both for the cluster
and for the eld environment The estimated ages for the
two brightest cluster galaxies 1567 in RXJ01527-1357
and 563 in RXJ122693332 Jrgensen et al 2006
are 234  26 and 164  09 Gyr respectively and are
not included in Fig 3 see below for a discussion about
these large ages A clear and important result is the
lack of young massive ETG In particular all ETG with
M  3  1011M have a lookback time to formation
larger than 10 Gyr and have a formation redshift larger
than 2 Clearly this cannot be the result of a selection
eect since relatively young massive ETG could not es-
cape from the available surveys
Conrming the analysis of the evolution of MLB
given at the beginning of this section we nd that more
massive galaxies are older than lower mass ones in all
environments and that cluster galaxies have the same
age within 5 as eld galaxies with the same mass
in the whole mass range see Fig 4 A similar de-
pendence of the age on the mass has already been ob-
tained by an analysis of the absorption line indices of
a sample of local ETG Thomas et al 2005 How-
ever Thomas et al
2005 nd that ETG in clusters
are older than those in the eld by about 2 Gyr Given
the number of objects in the samples that we have ex-
amined and the errors in the estimate of their age we
should have seen such a systematic age dierence if it
were present in the data that we have used We ar-
gue that using the Universe as a time machine should
be more powerful than archaeology on local galaxies
since galaxies are caught closer to the action
estingly also the Coma ETG show the downsizing ef-
fect and their formation redshifts are very consistent
with those of z1 ETG Jrgensen 1999 This sug-
gests that the z1 samples examined here are not much
aected by the progenitor bias van Dokkum  Franx
2001 di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 Thus our results
suggest that the rst ETG to form are the most massive

similar in the eld and in the clusters

and at z0892 open red triangles The dashed line is the best
t plane to the Coma cluster galaxies Compared to the local one
the FP at high redshift is oset and rotated in all environments
ones independently of the environment
Although the absolute ages that we derive are some-
what model dependent are aected by an approximate
metallicity estimate and obviously depend also on the
adopted cosmological parameters we stress that the
trends of age dierences between high redshift and local
ETG and between galaxies with dierent masses and in
dierent environments are much more robust
One of the uncertainties aecting the age estimates de-
rives from the assumption of structural homology when
computing masses through equation 1 It is well known
that ETG show a systematic departure from homol-
ogy both locally Caon Capaccioli  DOnofrio 1993
Gutierrez et al 2004 Gavazzi et al 2005 and at z1
di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 and that more precise
dynamical masses can be obtained taking these devia-
tions into account using the Sersic 1968 prole to
describe the observed surface brightness distribution
instead of the R14 law Bertin Ciotti  Del Principe
2002 These mass estimates can be up to  50 higher
di Serego Alighieri et al
redshift samples compared to the local one is clearly vis-
ible also for larger masses thus cannot be totally due to
selection eects see also van der Wel et al 2005
Very recently the largest high resolution simulation of
the growth of cosmic structure in the hierarchical forma-
tion scenario the Millennium Run Springel et al 2005
has been used to study how the ages of ETG depend on
environment and on galaxy mass De Lucia et al 2006
In this model since merging of smaller galaxies is an im-
portant ingredient for the formation of ETG the galaxy
formation time which is when most of its stars formed
and the galaxy assembly time which is when stars assem-
bled in the single galaxy that we observe are considered
separately De Lucia et al 2006 Our dating based on
changes in the MLB ratio relates to when the stars
formed rather than to when they assembled The semi-
analytic hierarchical model of De Lucia et al
2006 is
able to reproduce the already known result ie that the
formation times are earlier for more massive ETG al-
though the downsizing eect is considerably steeper in
the model than in the data see Fig 3 but clearly
predicts that cluster galaxies should be older than eld
galaxies which is not what we observe

galaxies but can also be lower by up to 20 for the high
mass galaxies di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 Unfor-
tunately we do not have Sersic indices for all the ETG
examined here but we have checked on the K20 eld
samples of di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 that the ages
estimated by taking non homology into account do not
vary substantially from those given in Fig 3 and 4 com-
puted using eq 1 Since the brightest cluster galaxies
are known to deviate from the R14 prole and if the
inuence of dark matter increases in high mass galaxies
these factors could lead to an overestimate of the the ages
of the most massive ETG in the cluster sample
The inuence of selection eects is shown by the dashed
lines in Fig 2 which represent the magnitude limit of
the K20 eld samples of di Serego Alighieri et al 2005
