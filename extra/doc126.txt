Abstract We present the Fundamental Plane FP of eld early-type galaxies at 05  z  10
Our project is a continuation of our eorts to understand the formation and evolution of early-
type galaxies in dierent environments The target galaxies were selected from the comprehensive
and homogeneous data set of the GeminiHST Galaxy Cluster Project The distant eld early-
type galaxies follow a steeper FP relation compared to the local FP The change in the slope of
the FP can be interpreted as a mass-dependent evolution Similar results have been found for
cluster early-type galaxies in high redshift galaxy clusters at 08  z  1 Therefore the slope
change of the FP appears to be independent of the environment of the galaxies

1 Introduction
Early-type galaxies obey a tight linear relation in 3-D log-space the Fundamental
Plane FP Djorgovski  Davis 1987 Dressler et al 1987 dened by their size re
average surface brightness hIei and stellar velocity dispersion  Via a study of the FP
constraints on the formation epoch and evolution of early-type galaxies are possible
Over the past twenty years a signicant eort has been devoted to understand the
physical processes involved in this empiric relationship in the nearby universe Previous
works of eld early-type galaxies at higher redshift up to z  12 found evidence for a
mass dependent evolution eg Treu et al 2005 di Serego Alighieri et al 2006 Recently
Fritz et al 2009a detected recent star formation in less-massive eld early-type galaxies
up to z  08 This rejuvenation accounts for 5-10 in the total stellar mass budget of
these galaxies possible triggered through AGN feedback
2 Observational Data
Target galaxies were selected from the GeminiHST Galaxy Cluster Project This
project is an extensive observational campaign to investigate the formation and evolu-
tion of distant galaxies in rich galaxy clusters from z  1 to the present-day Jrgensen et
al 2005 For 15 massive X-ray luminous galaxy clusters LX 01  24 keV 6 2  1044
erg s1 from z  01 to 1 intermediate-resolution GeminiGMOS spectroscopy and
HSTACS or WFPC2 imaging were obtained The MOS masks included primarily ex-
pected cluster members while vacant space was lled with slits for objects that have
similar brightnesses but slightly bluer or redder colours than expected for early-type
cluster members Out of three cluster elds RXJ01527-1357 RXJ122693332 and
RXJ141513612 we have extracted 20 galaxies with early-type morphology and 05 
z  1 hzi  074 which are used in the following The high SN and intermediate
resolution galaxy spectra hSN i  25 A1

3 The FP of Field Early-Type Galaxies up to z  1
Fig 1 shows the FP for eld early-type galaxies squares in rest-frame Johnson B-
band compared to 116 early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster triangles The slope
of the FP for eld galaxies at high redshift is steeper than that for their local coun-
terparts We interpret the slope dierence between the distant and local relation as a
mass-dependent evolution Less-massive eld galaxies M 6 8  1010M evolve faster
than their more massive counterparts The ML evolution with z is under investigation
Similar results have been found for galaxy clusters at 08  z  10 Jrgensen et al 2006
2007 Fritz et al 2009b This suggest that environmental eects play only a minor role
on the evolution of early-type galaxies A combined analysis of the FP and absorption
line strengths for the eld galaxies will be presented in Fritz et al 2009c in prep
