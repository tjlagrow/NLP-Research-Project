ABSTRACT
We describe modications to the joint stepwise maximum likelihood method of Cole 2011
in order to simultaneously t the GAMA-II galaxy luminosity function LF corrected for ra-
dial density variations and its evolution with redshift The whole sample is reasonably well-t
with luminosity Qe and density Pe evolution parameters Qe Pe  10 10 but with signif-
icant degeneracies characterized by Qe  1404Pe Blue galaxies exhibit larger luminosity
density evolution than red galaxies as expected We present the evolution-corrected r-band
LF for the whole sample and for blue and red sub-samples using both Petrosian and Sersic
magnitudes Petrosian magnitudes miss a substantial fraction of the ux of de Vaucouleurs
prole galaxies the Sersic LF is substantially higher than the Petrosian LF at the bright end

INTRODUCTION
The luminosity function LF is perhaps the most fundamental
model-independent quantity that can be measured from a galaxy
redshift survey Reproducing the observed LF is the rst require-
ment of a successful model of galaxy formation and thus accurate
measurements of the LF are important in constraining the physics
of galaxy formation and evolution eg Benson et al 2003 In ad-
dition accurate knowledge of the survey selection function and
hence LF is required in order to determine the clustering of a ux-
limited sample of galaxies Cole 2011
A standard 1Vmax Schmidt 1968 estimate of the LF is vul-
nerable to radial density variations within the sample This vul-
nerability can be largely mitigated by multiplying the maximum
volume in which each galaxy is visible Vmax by the integrated
radial overdensity of a density-dening population Baldry et al

tial dependence of the galaxy number density are separable are
by construction insensitive to density uctuations However if the
sample covers a signicant redshift range galaxy properties such
as luminosity and number density are subject to systematic evolu-
tion with lookback time All of the above methods must then either
be applied to restricted redshift subsets of the data or be modied
to explicitly allow for evolution eg Lin et al 1999 Loveday et al
Cole 2011 recently introduced a joint stepwise maximum
likelihood JSWML method which jointly ts non-parametric es-
timates of the LF and the galaxy overdensity in radial bins along
with an evolution model In this paper we describe modications
made to the JSWML method in order to successfully apply it to the
Galaxy and Mass Assembly GAMA survey Driver et al 2011
In the GAMA-II sample L galaxies can be seen out to redshift
z  035 and so one has a reasonable redshift baseline over which
to constrain luminosity and density evolution Loveday et al 2012
have previously investigated LF evolution in the GAMA-I sample
nding that at higher redshifts all galaxy types were more lumi-
nous blue galaxies had a higher comoving number density and red
J Loveday et al
galaxies had a lower comoving number density Here we exploit
the greater depth 04 mag of GAMA-II versus GAMA-I and use
an estimator of galaxy evolution that does not assume a parametric
form eg a Schechter function for the LF
The paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we describe
the GAMA data used along with corrections made for its small
level of incompleteness Our adopted evolution model is described
in Section 3 and the density-corrected Vmax method in Section 4
Methods for determining the evolution parameters are discussed in
Section 5 We present tests of our methods using simulated data in
Section 6 and apply them to GAMA data in Section 7 We briey
discuss our ndings in Section 8 and conclude in Section 9
Throughout we assume a Hubble constant of H0 
100h km s1 Mpc1 and an M  03   07 cosmology
in calculating distances co-moving volumes and luminosities
2 GAMA-II DATA K- AND COMPLETENESS
CORRECTIONS
In April 2013 the GAMA survey completed spectroscopic cover-
age of the three equatorial elds G09 G12 and G15 In GAMA-II
these elds were extended in area to cover 12  5 degrees each1
and all galaxies were targeted to a Galactic-extinction-corrected
SDSS DR7 Petrosian r-band magnitude limit of r  198 mag In
our analysis we include all main-survey targets SURVEY CLASS

tancesFramesv12 are corrected for local ow using the Tonry et al
2000 attractor model as described by Baldry et al 2012
We calculate LFs using both Petrosian 1976 and Sersic
1963 photometry corrected for Galactic extinction using the dust
maps of Schlegel et al 1998 We use single Sersic model magni-
tudes truncated at ten effective radii as t by Kelvin et al 2012
Kelvin et al show that these recover essentially all of the ux for
an n  1 exponential prole and about 96 per cent of the ux
of an n  4 de Vaucouleurs prole SDSS Petrosian magnitudes
while also measuring almost all of the ux for exponential proles
measure only about 82 per cent of the ux for de Vaucouleurs pro-
les Blanton et al 2001 Sersic magnitudes are however more
susceptible to contamination from nearby bright objects which
can cause them to be overestimated by several mag We identify
galaxies which may have contaminated photometry by searching
for brighter stellar neighbours within a distance up to a maximum
of ve arcmin of twice the stars isophotal radius isoAr in
the SDSS PhotoObj table Five per cent of GAMA targets are
agged in this way

ies have positive m ie are brighter in Sersic than Petrosian

contaminated red galaxies preferentially have brighter Sersic than

Petrosian magnitudes This is as expected assuming that they are
bulge-dominated and hence have proles with higher Sersic index
We exclude an additional 487 targets 03 per cent of the to-
tal for which the r-band Sersic and Petrosian magnitudes differ by
more than 2 mag This magnitude difference cut is somewhat arbi-
trary but is designed to exclude galaxies with bright stellar neigh-
bours that do not quite satisfy the above criterion for instance if a
galaxy lies on a stars diffraction spike or with bad sky background
determination It seems extremely unlikely that the Sersic magni-
tude would recover more ux than this from an uncontaminated
galaxy

is given in Table 1 For the former sample just over half of the cases
of possibly overestimated Sersic ux appear to be due to a nearby
star which has more successfully been excluded from the Petrosian
ux estimate For the latter sample the most common cause of un-
derestimated Sersic ux or overestimated Petrosian ux is likely
due to deblending issues or a bad sky determination We note that
the presence of a nearby bright star should be totally uncorrelated
with a galaxys intrinsic properties and so excluding targets for this
reason should not bias the sample in any way A small bias could
be caused by excluding the cid39 20 per cent of inspected galaxies
about 006 per cent of total targets for which the suspect photom-
etry is caused by a neighbouring galaxy since galaxies in crowded
regions are expected to be more luminous than average In cases
when the Petrosian and Sersic magnitudes differ by more than 2
mag both magnitude estimates are suspect and so it is debatable
whether these objects should be GAMA targets at all At worst
the effect of excluding targets with bright stellar neighbours or dis-
crepant magnitudes 53 per cent of the entire GAMA-II sample
will be to bias the LF normalization low by up to ve per cent
After excluding GAMA main survey targets with either an un-
reliable redshift 12 per cent or suspect photometry 53 per cent
we are left with a sample of 173527 galaxies in the redshift range

2011 As shown in Appendix B of Taylor et al 2011 and Fig 17
of Kelvin et al 2012 SDSS model magnitudes which have
been recommended for calculating galaxy colours eg Stoughton
et al 2002 are ill-behaved for galaxies of intermediate Sersic
index which are well t by neither pure exponential nor pure de
Vaucouleurs proles GAMA matched-aperture magnitudes do not
force a particular functional form on the galaxy prole and so pro-
vide more reliable colours for all galaxy types In practice we nd
that the choice of magnitude type used for K-corrections makes lit-
tle difference to our LF estimates with the Schechter t parameters
changing by less than 1-sigma We use K-corrections to reference
redshift z0  01 in order to allow direct comparison with previous
results Loveday et al 2012 For the three GAMA-II targets which
are missing AUTO magnitudes and for the 33 per cent of targets
for which KCORRECT reports a 2 statistic of 100 or larger im-
plying a poor SED t we set the K-correction to the mean of the
remaining sample We have visually inspected 235 of these targets
with poor-tting SEDs About 29 per cent are close to a bright star
or are otherwise likely to suffer from poorly-estimated sky back-
ground about 22 per cent have one or more close neighbours and
may thus suffer contaminated photometry about 13 per cent show
evidence of AGN activity The remaining 35 per cent show no ob-
vious reason for the SED t to be poor but it seems likely that
many of these cases may be due to poor u-band photometry with
underestimated errors
While SDSS DR7 has improved photometric calibration over
DR6 used for selection of GAMA-I targets it will suffer from the
same surface-brightness-dependent selection effects as DR6 and so
we assume the same imaging completeness Cim as shown in Fig 1
of Loveday et al 2012 In this paper we only measure the r-band
LF and so assume that target completeness is 100 per cent In fact
just 01 per cent of GAMA-II main targets with r  198 mag lack
a measured spectrum with no systematic dependence on magnitude

While the vast majority of galaxies 995 per cent have Wi  2
there is a tail of rare objects with weights as high as 100 or more
We have visually inspected the 157 objects with an assigned weight
above 100 Of these 38 per cent are close to a bright star or are oth-
erwise likely to have a poorly-determined sky background another
38 per cent have nearby neighbouring galaxies which might lead to
a compromised surface-brightness estimate 10 per cent are isolated

limit corresponds to the inverse redshift success rate for galaxies
with the faintest bre magnitudes Fig 2 While only 297 galaxies
016 per cent of the total have Wi  50 these galaxies are likely
to lie at the extreme faint end of the LF where there are few ob-
served galaxies and so spurious weights could potentially bias the
LF faint end The mean galaxy weights before and after applying
this cap are 112 and 109 respectively
The effect of applying this weight cap is to reduce the best-t
value of the density evolution parameter Pe by about 40 per cent
with a corresponding increase in the best-t value of the luminosity

When subdividing GAMA galaxies into blue and red sub-
samples we use the colour cut of Loveday et al 2012 namely
01g  rKron  015  003 01Mr  5 log h
A detailed investigation of colour bimodality in GAMA has re-
cently been presented by Taylor et al 2015 They utilise restframe
and dust-corrected g  i colour and argue that a probablistic as-
signment of galaxies to R and B populations is preferable to
a hard and somewhat arbitrary redblue cut They also empha-
sise that colour is not synonymous with morphological type but
rather provides a proxy for mean stellar age within a galaxy Also
of course a galaxy may appear red in uncorrected restframe colour
due to dust extinction rather than an old stellar population In this
paper we stick with the simple colour-cut of equation 2 for two
reasons i to allow direct comparison with the results of Loveday
et al 2012 ii the Taylor et al 2015 model of the colourmass
distribution has been tuned to a nearly volume-limited sample of
galaxies at redshift z  012  the model parameters are likely to
evolve at higher redshift
Uncertainties in measured quantities such as radial overden-
sity and the LF are determined by jackknife resampling We sub-
divide the GAMA-II area into nine 4  5 degree regions and then
recalculate the quantity nine times omitting each region in turn
For any quantity x we may then determine its variance using
Varx 
N  1
xi  x2
Ncid88
where N  9 is the number of jackknife regions xi is our estimate
of x obtained when omitting region i and x is the mean of the
xi The numerator N  1 in the pre-factor allows for the fact
that the jackknife estimates are not independent Each jackknife
region contains an average of 19281 galaxies for the full GAMA-
II sample ie without colour selection
3 PARAMETRIZING THE EVOLUTION
We parametrize luminosity and density evolution over the redshift
range 0002  z  065 using the parameters Qe and Pe in-
troduced by Lin et al 1999 This model assumes that galaxy
populations evolve linearly with redshift in absolute magnitude
parametrized by Qe and in log number density parametrized by
Pe Specically the luminosity e-correction is given by Ez 
Qez  z0 such that absolute magnitude M is determined from
apparent magnitude m using
M  m  5 log10 dLz  25  Kz z0  Qez  z0
where dLz is the luminosity distance assuming the cosmolog-
ical parameters specied in the Introduction at redshift z and
Kz z0 is the K-correction relative to a passband blueshifted by
z0 Luminosity evolution is determined relative to the same redshift
z0  01 as the K-correction
Evolution in number density P z is parametrized as
P z  P z01004Pezz0  P z  01004Pez
The motivation for this choice of parametrization is that if the shape
of the LF does not evolve with redshift that is it shifts only hori-
zontally in absolute magnitude by Qe and vertically in log-density
by Pe then luminosity density L evolves as
Lz  Lz01004PeQezz0
While Pe and Qe are strongly degenerate and so poorly con-
strained individually their sum Pe  Qe is well-constrained Lin
et al 1999 Loveday et al 2012 We set further constraints on the
linear combination of these parameters in Section 7
4 DENSITY-CORRECTED Vmax METHOD
In this section we describe our technique for determining the LF
using a maximum-likelihood density-corrected Vmax estimator as-
suming that evolution is known We will discuss how we determine
the evolution parameters Qe and Pe in Section 5 Our method is
based on the joint stepwise maximum likelihood JSWML method
of Cole 2011 which jointly ts the LF and overdensities in radial
bins of redshift caused by large-scale structure Coles derivation
starts with an expression for the joint probability of nding a galaxy
at specied redshift and luminosity and assumes that all galaxies
have identical evolution- and K-corrections We wish to allow for
individual K- and in the future e- corrections in which case it
is easier to start with the conditional probability that an observed
galaxy of luminosity Li has a redshift zi assuming that the lu-
minosity and spatial dependence of the galaxy number density are
separable This conditional probability is given by Saunders et al

Here we have factored the mean density at redshift z nz

zmaxi is the maximum redshift at which galaxy i would still be
3 Following Cole 2011 we use the term overdensity to mean a multi-
plicative relative density so that   1 corresponds to average density

Adopting binned estimates of the galaxy overdensity  and
weighting each galaxy by its incompleteness-correction weight
Wi we obtain a log-likelihood
jPjVjDij  ln
jPjVjSij
Here Vj Pj and j are the volume density evolution and galaxy
overdensity respectively in redshift bin j the function Dij is a sim-
ple binning function equal to unity if galaxy i lies in redshift bin
j zero otherwise and Sij is the fraction of redshift bin j in which
galaxy i is visible In the present analysis we employ redshift bins
of width z  001 The maximum-likelihood solution for the
overdensities j given by  lnLj  0 may be obtained by

cid88
where Dil  1 if galaxy i is in luminosity bin l zero other-
wise Cole 2011 shows that this expression may be derived via
maximum likelihood at least in the case of identical e- and K-
corrections
Cole also discusses an extension to this method whereby pa-
rameters describing the density evolution P z may be deter-
mined simultaneously with the overdensities j by adding prior
constraints on the values of j using the known clustering of galax-
ies However for our choice of density evolution parametrization
equation 5 the derivative in Cole equation 25 no longer de-
pends explicitly on the evolution parameter leading to a lack of
convergence We therefore prefer to search over both luminosity
and density evolution parameters as described in the next section
A stepwise estimate of the LF as given by equation 10 is not
constrained to vary smoothly from bin to bin Furthermore at very
low and high luminosity there may be bins containing no galaxies
resulting in an ill-dened log-likelihood see equation 12 below
This problem is exacerbated when exploring possible values of the
luminosity evolution parameter Qe as galaxies will then shift from
bin to bin as Qe is varied resulting in unphysical sharp jumps in
likelihood To overcome these problems we employ a Gaussian-
smoothed estimate of the LF
cid88
cid18 Mi  Ml
cid19
Here the smoothing kernel G is a standard Gaussian b is the
smoothing bandwidth Mi is the K- and e-corrected absolute
magnitude of galaxy i and Ml is the absolute magnitude at the cen-
tre of bin l In order not to underestimate the extreme faint-end of
the LF it is important to apply boundary conditions to GS corre-
sponding to the chosen range of absolute magnitudes We do this
using the default renormalization method and bandwidth choice of
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
GAMA LF evolution
the python module pyqtfitkde4 GS does not of course
correspond to the true galaxy LF but rather to the LF convolved
with a Gaussian of standard deviation b Therefore when plotting
the LF and tting a Schechter function we use the standard binned
LF bin rather than GS
5 DETERMINING EVOLUTION PARAMETERS
In Coles original derivation of this method one maximises a pos-
terior likelihood Cole equation 385 over the luminosity evolution
parameter Qe Cole calls this parameter u When applying this
method to GAMA data we found that the estimated value of Qe
diverged unless one places an extremely tight prior on its value6
Our problem was traced to the fact that varying Qe changes all
of the inferred absolute magnitudes as well as visibility limits
for each galaxy Choosing xed absolute magnitude limits within
which to determine the LF thus results in a change of sample size
as Qe varies leading to likelihoods that cannot be directly com-
pared Even if one includes the term on the second line of Cole
equation 36 which yields Ntot ln Ntot in the case of identical
K- and e-corrections the estimate of Qe still diverges as galaxies
shift systematically brighter or fainter as Qe decreases or increases
We therefore consider two alternative methods to optimize the evo-
lution parameters
51 Mean probability
Our rst solution is to consider not the product of the probabilities
of observing each galaxy but instead the geometric mean of the
probabilities which does not vary systematically with sample size
N Our pseudo-log-likelihood lnP is then given by Cole equation

where Wsumj is the sum of galaxy weights in redshift bin j
Wsuml is the sum of galaxy weights in luminosity bin l and
SLminijLl is the fraction of luminosity bin l for which galaxy i
at redshift zj would be visible The term on the second line is a con-
stant in the case of identical K- and e-corrections with identical
e- but independent K-corrections we nd that including this term
makes a negligible difference to the maximum-likelihood solution

5 Note that Cole equations 3638 are missing factors of Pp such that
each occurrence of Vp should read VpPp
6 We believe that the reason that the test described in Section 5 of Cole
2011 was successful was due to i placing a very tight prior   005
on the density evolution parameter and ii simulating a very deep galaxy
survey extending to magnitude r  24 and redshift z  14 Both of
these factors minimize the degeneracy between luminosity and density evo-
lution and hence aid convergence The GAMA-II sample is signicantly
shallower r  198 z  065 and we do not wish to place tight prior
constraints on either of the evolution parameters
J Loveday et al
The terms on the third line are priors on the radial overdensities
j and the evolution parameters Pe and Qe The priors on j are
essential as these values are completely degenerate with the den-
sity evolution parameter Pe As discussed by Cole the expected
variance in j is given by

the fact that because galaxies are clustered they tend to come in
clumps of 4nJ3 galaxies at a time Peebles 1980 We nd how-
ever that much more reliable estimates of 2
j are obtained from
jackknife sampling  see Fig 6 below This is particularly true
in the higher redshift bins where one is sampling the clustering of
the most luminous galaxies and where adopting a universal value
for J3 underestimates the actual density uctuations observed be-
tween jackknife samples The priors on Pe and Qe are optional
and may help convergence in some cases We adopt broad pri-

Our second method compares LFs estimated in two or more red-

modelled then the LFs should be in good agreement if evolution

limits see Section 33 of Loveday et al 2012 and which include
at least ten galaxies for all values of Qe between specied lim-
its In practice we have found best results are achieved using just
two redshift ranges split near the median redshift of the sample
z  02 so that the knee region of the LF around L is well-
sampled by both and hence the degeneracies between luminosity
and density evolution are minimized If one chooses three or more
redshift ranges there will be very little luminosity coverage in com-
mon to the lowest and highest ranges and so one does not really
gain much information in doing so Again it is essential to place a
prior on the overdensities nal sum in equation 14 with 2

with density evolution This method places no priors on the values
for the evolution parameters
53 Finding optimum evolution parameters
We rst evaluate 2 values using each of the above methods on
a rectangular grid of Pe Qe thus allowing one to visualise the
correlations between the evolution parameters The grid point with
the smallest 2 value is then used as a starting point for a downhill
simplex minimisation to rene the parameter values corresponding
to minimum 2
In order to quantify the degeneracy between evolution param-
eters we slice the 2 grid in bins of Pe For each slice we t a
quadratic function to 2Qe using the ve Qe 2 values clos-
est to the point of minimum 2 in that slice Using this quadratic
t we locate the point Qe2
of minimum 2 and its 1-sigma
range ie the range of Qe values where 2 increases by unity from
the minimum We nd both for simulations and for real data that
the Qe2
Pe relation is very well t by a straight line and so
we perform a linear least-squares t to Pe Qe2
 to obtain the
relation Qe  mPe  c which minimizes 2
6 TESTS USING SIMULATED DATA
61 The simulations
In this section we test our implementation of the JSWML estimator
using simulated data following the procedure outlined in Section 5
of Cole 2011
We start by choosing a model LF with Schechter 1976 and
evolution parameters close to those obtained from the GAMA-I sur-
vey by Loveday et al 2012 and as given in Table 2 We then
randomly generate redshifts with a uniform density in comoving
coordinates modulated by our assumed density evolution equa-
tion 5 over the range 0002  z  065 Absolute magnitudes
are selected randomly according to our assumed Schechter func-
tion from the range 24  M  12 From each absolute mag-
nitude we subtract Qez  01 to model luminosity evolution We
then assign apparent magnitudes r using K-correction coefcients
selected randomly from the GAMA-II data and reject simulated
galaxies fainter than r  198 This process is repeated until suf-
cient random galaxies have been generated to give the required
number density

within a volume corresponding to that of the three GAMA-II elds
viz 3  5  12  180 deg2
In order to simulate the effects of galaxy clustering we spilt
the simulated volume into 65 redshift shells p of equal thickness
z  001 and with volume Vj For each shell we generate a ran-
dom density perturbation j drawn from a Gaussian with zero mean
and variance 4J3Vj with 4J3  30 000h3Mpc3 We then
randomly resample Ncid48
j  1  jNj of the original Nj simulated
galaxies in each shell p thus producing uctuations consistent with
the assumed value of J3
Imaging completeness and redshift success are modelled by
generating surface brightnesses and bre magnitude for each sim-
ulated galaxy according to the relations observed in GAMA-I data
see Appendix A1 of Loveday et al 2012 Imaging completeness
Cim is then determined from Fig 1 of Loveday et al 2012 and
redshift success Cz from equation 1 Simulated galaxies are then
chosen randomly with probability equal to CimCz and assigned
a weight Wi  1CimiCz i to compensate for those simulated
galaxies omitted from the sample
This procedure is repeated to generate ten independent mock
catalogues each containing around 180000 galaxies These mock
catalogues are run through the JSWML estimator with evolution
parameters being determined using both methods discussed in the
previous section Since the mock galaxies are clustered only in red-
shift shells and not in projected coordinates on the sky we de-
termine the expected variance in overdensity using equation 13

the error contours are signicantly smaller using the LFredshift
2 method compared with the mean probability method However
this test is idealized in that our choice of evolution parametriza-
tion is identical in the simulations and in the analysis7 and so we
will apply both methods of constraining evolution parameters to
the GAMA data in the following Section Note that the simulations
have no inbuilt covariance between evolution parameters they all
use identical values of Pe and Qe The degeneracies as quantied
by CovQe Pe and the parameters m and c in Table 2 arise as
a result of the tting process For an LF described by an unbroken
power law the degeneracy between Pe and Qe would be total ie
evolution in luminosity and density would be indistinguishable
7 RESULTS FROM GAMA
71 Evolution
Fig 5 shows 95 per cent condence limits on the evolution param-
eters Pe Qe determined using equations 12 and 14 for the full
GAMA-II sample and for blue and red galaxies separately We see
that the condence limits obtained with the two different methods
largely overlap although there are small differences between them
Best t evolution parameters are given in Table 3 The difference
in LFs obtained using evolution parameters determined with the
two different methods is negligible much less than the 1- random
errors see Table 4 This illustrates the robustness of the LF es-
timate to the individual values assumed for Pe and Qe as long as
their joint estimate is reasonable eg they lie within the 95 per cent
likelihood contours of Fig 5 then overestimating one evolution pa-
rameter eg Pe is largely compensated for by underestimating the
other eg Qe
The differences in density evolution Pe for red and blue
galaxies are not signicant Blue galaxies do however exhibit sig-
nicantly stronger evolution in luminosity Qe and in luminosity
density Qe  Pe than red galaxies at the  5- level
The differences between red and blue galaxies agree qualita-
tively with those of Loveday et al 2012 although in the present
analysis we no longer see any evidence for negative density evolu-
tion for red galaxies The three samples show very similar degen-
eracies in Pe Qe parameter space The errors on Pe and Qe in
Table 3 are the formal errors obtained by holding one parameter
xed and varying the other until 2 increases by one Given the
scatter in 95 per cent condence limits between simulations shown
in Fig 4 more realistic errors and their covariance may be ob-
tained from Table 2
Since the exact values assumed for the evolution parameters
have such a small effect on the LF parameters see Table 4 below
for the remainder of this paper we assume evolution parameters
found from the LFredshift method in the lower half of Table 3
72 Radial overdensities
Radial overdensities are shown in Fig 6 While our evolution
model is performing well insofar as z oscillates about unity for
redshifts z cid46 05 beyond this limit the overdensities are systemat-
ically high This effect is almost entirely due to red galaxies sug-
gesting that luminosity andor density evolution increases sharply
at z  05 for these galaxies compared with our model section 3
7 We are performing a self-consistency test It is unlikely that real galaxy
populations evolve exactly according to our parametrization

pected are slightly more pronounced in the red galaxy sample
Note that the error bands given by equation 13 shaded regions
in Fig 6 are signicantly largersmaller than the jackknife errors
at lowhigh redshift There are two reasons for this i the low-
redshift bins sample too small a volume for the J3 integral to have
converged and ii the lowhigh-redshift bins are dominated by
faintluminous galaxies with weakerstronger clustering than the
average dened by the assumed value of J3 This is why we use
jackknife errors rather than the predicted variance in determining
j  We have tried halving the number of redshift bins to 32 ver-
ifying that the tted parameters are insensitive to the redshift bin-
ning with parameters changing by less than one sigma when the
redshift bin size is doubled from z  001 to z  002
73 LFs
Petrosian and Sersic r-band LFs are shown in Fig 8 Surface
brightness and redshift incompleteness have been taken into ac-
count by appropriately weighting each galaxy up to a maximum
weight of 50 Section 2 We have t a Schechter function to each
binned LF using least squares the t parameters are tabulated in
Table 4 Note that the Schechter t for red galaxies underestimates
the faint end of the LF as well as the bright end  see below It is
likely that the faint-end upturn for red galaxies is at least partly due
to the inclusion of dusty spirals in this sample the luminosity and
stellar mass functions of ESa galaxies of Kelvin et al 2014ab

too few to constrain a more complicated evolution model or to look
for a large overdensity at these redshifts see Fig 7

liptical morphology are blue g  i0 cid46 06 the converse is not
true a substantial number of galaxies with spiral morphology are

tion of spheroidal galaxies is more likely to be due to the presence
of so-called little blue spheroids Kelvin et al 2014b Fig A1 Fi-
nally we note that Taylor et al 2015 have shown that the shape
of the low-mass end of the stellar mass function of red galaxies is
sensitive to how red is dened A low-mass upturn is seen when
using the denition of Peng et al 2010 but not when using those
of Bell et al 2003 and Baldry et al 2004
The red galaxy LF and that for the combined sample show
a bright-end excess there are signicantly more high-luminosity
Mr5 lg h  23 mag galaxies than predicted by the Schechter
function t This is particularly true for the LF measured using
Sersic magnitudes which capture a larger fraction of the total light
for de Vaucouleurs prole galaxies which dominate the bright end
of the LF eg Bernardi et al 2013 A bright-end excess above
a best-tting Schechter function has been observed in many other
surveys eg Loveday et al 1992 Norberg et al 2002 Montero-
Dorta  Prada 2009 and appears to be particularly pronounced
in bluer bands eg Montero-Dorta  Prada 2009 Loveday et al

Figure 7 Redshift histograms for the whole GAMA-II sample and for blue
and red galaxies separately The curves in each panel give the predicted
redshift distribution based on our evolving LF model ts
2012 Driver et al 2013 As Driver et al 2013 point out given
the approximately Gaussian distribution of galaxy colours the LF
cannot be well t by a Schechter function in all bands One should
however be aware of the possibility that Sersic magnitudes extrap-
olated as they are out to ten effective radii are susceptible to over-
or under- estimating the ux of even isolated galaxies if the Sersic
parameters are poorly t although the tting pipeline does attempt
to trap for poor ts Hence we also show LFs using more stable
Petrosian magnitudes
Our Schechter ts to these LFs are consistent with the r-
band LFs determined from the GAMA-I sample by Loveday et al
2012 using slightly different methods and shown in Fig 8 as
dotted lines We also show the corrected LF from the Blanton
et al 2005 low-redshift SDSS sample without colour selection
Considering that this plot is comparing the LFs of SDSS galaxies
within only 150h1Mpc with GAMA galaxies out to z  065 the
agreement is remarkably good and provides further evidence that
the simple evolutionary model adopted allows one to accurately
recover the evolution-corrected LF despite its poor performance
beyond redshift z  05 Fig 6

full GAMA-II sample measured in four redshift slices as indicated
calculated using equation 10 with the best-t evolution parame-
ters and radial overdensities and taking into account the appropri-
ate redshift limits If the evolution model accurately reects true
evolution and if we have successfully corrected for density vari-
ations then these LFs should be consistent where they overlap in
luminosity In the bottom panel we have divided each LF by the LF
determined from the full sample 0002  z  065 top panel
of Fig 8 in order to make differences more clearly visible We
see that the lowest redshift LF z  01 is about 1020 per cent
lower than the 01  z  02 LF indicating that the linear evo-
lution model is somewhat undercorrecting at the lowest redshifts
The low-redshift underdensity is particularly severe at the bright
end the most luminous Mr  5 lg h cid46 215 mag galaxies are
underdense by  50 per cent relative to the higher redshift slices
In order to investigate these discrepancies further we repeat
this analysis using redshift-sliced LFs determined using Sersic

indicated for the full GAMA sample applying evolutionary corrections as
given in Table 3 Bottom panel The same LFs relative to the overall LF

magnitudes with results shown in Fig 10 The underdensity of lu-
minous low-redshift galaxies is now much less severe instead we
see an increased scatter between redshifts at the bright end with
perhaps the 01  z  02 LF biased high relative to the oth-
ers It thus seems likely that the underdensity of luminous low-
redshift galaxies apparent in Fig 9 is largely due to Petrosian mag-
nitudes missing a signicant fraction of the ux of luminous galax-
ies which will tend to have a de Vaucouleurs-like prole This
problem is further exacerbated for such galaxies at low-redshift
which will have large angular extent and thus also be susceptible to
poor background subtraction Blanton et al 2011 show that galax-
ies of radius  100 arcsec have their magnitudes underestimated
by around 15 mag in the SDSS DR7 database Both Sersic and
Petrosian photometry are subject to over-deblending or shredding
of large galaxy images When running the Sersic tting pipeline
Kelvin et al 2012 aimed towards undershredding as they were
specically focussed on the primary galaxies in systems with close
neighbours However this does mean that the Sersic uxes become
susceptible to non-detection of nearby secondary sources which
introduces a positive ux bias in crowded elds for a small fraction
of galaxies see Section 2
In conclusion while the redshift-sliced Petrosian LFs do
show some systematic differences use of GAMA-measured Sersic
magnitudes which capture a larger fraction of total ux for de

ing the Davis  Huchra 1982 minimum-variance estimator Any
over-estimate of luminosity evolution would lead to a correspond-
ing under-estimate in density evolution due to the assumption of
an unchanging faint-end slope with redshift and the strong corre-
lation between Schechter parameters Although any determination
of evolution will be affected by degeneracies between luminosity
and density evolution our method makes no assumption about the
unobserved faint-end slope of the LF at higher redshifts On the
other hand we do assume a parametric form for evolution
is also plausible that
the discrepancies between esti-
mated evolution parameters are due to the uncertainties in
incompleteness-correction required when analysing most galaxy
surveys For example when we cap our incompleteness-correction
weights to 5 we see a reduction in the estimated density evolution
parameters There are likely to be other effects leading to system-
atic errors in the determination of evolution parameters which are
not reected in the statistical error contours
A positive density evolution for the All galaxy sample would
suggest a reduction in the number of galaxies with cosmic time ei-
ther through merging or due to galaxies dropping out of the sample
selection criteria as they passively fade Neither scenario seems ter-
ribly likely Robotham et al 2014 see evidence for only a small
merger rate in the GAMA sample Perhaps a more likely explana-
tion is that the apparent density evolution at low redshift is actually
caused by a local underdensity eg Keenan et al 2013 Whit-
bourn  Shanks 2014
82 Future work
There are several ways in which the present work can be extended
Having derived density-corrected Vmax values for each
galaxy it is then trivial to determine other distribution functions
such as the stellar mass and size functions and their evolution By
way of a quick example in Fig 11 we plot the stellar mass function
for low-redshift z  006 GAMA-II galaxies using the stellar
mass estimates of Taylor et al 2011 In the mass regime where
Figure 10 As Fig 9 but using Sersic magnitudes
Vaucouleurs-prole galaxies and which have an improved back-
ground subtraction compared with SDSS DR7 largely mitigates
these differences and suggests that our evolution model is a rea-
sonable one
8 DISCUSSION
81 Comprison with previous results
While our evolution-corrected LFs agree well with previous esti-
mates our nding of positive density evolution in the sense that
comoving density was higher in the past is at odds with most pre-
vious work which has tended to nd either mildly negative Cool
et al 2012 or insignicant Blanton et al 2003 Moustakas et al
2013 density evolution Faber et al 2007 nd a declining co-
moving number density with redshift for their red sample with no
noticeable density evolution for their blue and full samples Zucca
et al 2009 also nd a declining comoving number density with
redshift for their reddest sample for their bluest galaxies they nd
increasing number density with redshift
At least some of the discrepancy between the sign of the den-
sity evolution between us and eg Cool et al 2012 might be ex-
plained by the way in which the LF and evolution are tted Cool
et al 2012 t the characteristic magnitude M to each redshift
range using the Sandage et al 1979 maximum-likelihood method
holding the faint-end slope parameter  xed at its best-t value for

VLT Survey Telescope Kilo-degree Survey VST KiDS imaging
in the GAMA regions Future work will explore the evolution of
the stellar mass function
The density-corrected Vmax values will also be used to gener-
ate the radial distributions of random points required to measure the
clustering of ux-limited galaxy samples Farrow et al in prep
We plan to explore the possibility of using the Taylor et al
2011 stellar population synthesis SPS model ts to GAMA data
to derive luminosity evolution parameters Qe for individual galax-
ies If the models can predict Qe with sufcient reliability the de-
generacy in tting for both luminosity and density evolution would
be largely eliminated This would also allow for the fact that galax-
ies have individual evolutionary histories
We also plan to incorporate the environmental-dependence of
the LF into our model Note that the radial overdensities shown
in Fig 6 are a poor estimate of the density around each galaxy
since they are averages over the entire GAMA-II area within each
redshift shell McNaught-Roberts et al 2014 present estimates of
the LF for galaxies in bins of density within 8h1Mpc spheres
We are currently extending density estimation to the full GAMA
sample using a variety of density measures Martindale et al in
This main focus of this paper has been to correct the LF and
radial density for the effects of evolution rather than to measure
evolution per se An alternative way of constraining evolution is
to measure how the luminosity of galaxies at a xed space density
evolves Via comparison with a model for the evolution of stellar
populations or luminosity evolution of the fundamental plane one
can estimate the rate of mass growth eg Brown et al 2007
9 CONCLUSIONS
We have described an implementation of the Cole 2011 JSWML
method used to infer the evolutionary parameters the radial den-
sity variations and the r band LF of galaxies in the GAMA-II sur-
vey For the overall population we nd that galaxies have faded
in r-band luminosity by about 05 mag and have decreased in co-
moving number density by a factor of about 16 since z  05 ie
over the last 5 Gyr or so When the population is divided into red
and blue galaxies the differences in density evolution parameter Pe
are statistically insignicant Luminosity evolution is signicantly
stronger for blue galaxies than for red Evolution in the luminosity
density evolution of blue galaxies is higher than that of red at the
 5- level These ndings are consistent with those of Loveday
et al 2012 based on GAMA-I and are as expected since a frac-
tion of galaxies that were blue in the past will have since ceased
star formation and become red
While there still exists some degeneracy between the param-
eters describing luminosity Qe and density Pe evolution for
GAMA-II data see Fig 5 analysis of simulated data and compar-
ison with a local galaxy sample from SDSS Blanton et al 2005
shows that we are able to recover the evolution-corrected LF to high
accuracy In detail GAMA LFs are poorly described by Schechter
functions due to excess number density at both faint and bright
luminosities particularly for the red population
The density-corrected Vmax values will be made available via
the GAMA database
