ABSTRACT
We present a simple empirically motivated model that simultaneously predicts the evolution of the
mean size and the comoving mass density of massive  1011 M early-type galaxies from z  2
to the present First we demonstrate that some size evolution of the population can be expected
simply due to the continuous emergence of early-type galaxies The Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS
data reveal that in the present-day universe more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical
mass have older stellar populations This implies that with increasing look-back time the more
extended galaxies will be more and more absent from the population In contrast at a given stellar
velocity dispersion SDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age which implies that
the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which galaxies stopped forming stars
turning into early-type galaxies Based on this we dene an empirically motivated redshift-dependent
velocity dispersion threshold above which galaxies do not form stars at a signicant rate which we
associate with the transformation into early-type galaxies Applying this formation criterion to a
large sample of nearby early-type galaxies we predict the redshift evolution in the size distribution
and the comoving mass density The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the
observed evolution Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of galaxies between the
formation redshift and the present based on cosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter
halos Such mergers after the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably dissipationless
dry where the increase in size is expected to be approximately proportional to the increase in
mass This model successfully reproduces the observed evolution since z  2 in the mean size and
in the comoving mass density of early-type galaxies with mass M  1011 M We conclude that the
recently measured substantial size evolution of early-type galaxies can be explained by the combined
eect of the continuous emergence of galaxies as early types and their subsequent growth through dry
merging

1 INTRODUCTION
Over the past ve years it has become clear that
early-type galaxies do not constitute a passively evolv-
ing population Their predominantly old stellar popu-
lations notwithstanding substantial evolution occurs up
until the present day The main evidence for such evo-
lution is the increase in comoving mass density by a
factor of about three from z  1 to the present eg
Bell et al 2004b Brown et al 2007 Faber et al 2007
Recently additional evidence for continuing structural
evolution of the early-type galaxy population was pro-
vided by the observation that distant z  15 quiescent
galaxies have much smaller sizes than early-type galax-
ies of the same stellar mass in the present-day universe

This surprising result
raising questions about the evolutionary connection of
these compact galaxies with present-day descendants
was recently put on rmer footing by van der Wel et al
2008 using early-type galaxies with accurate dynam-
ical masses thus removing the most important system-
atic problem that may hamper the z  2 results the
absolute uncertainty in the mass estimates they in-
ferred substantive size evolution by a factor of  2 at
a given mass between z  1 and present Recently also
Bernardi 2009 showed that size evolution continues up
until the present day and must be a smooth function of
redshift Although the remaining uncertainties are not
negligible see eg Hopkins et al 2009a it has become
clear that the observed size evolution cannot be explained
by systematic uncertainties
formed early are smaller
Because halos that collapsed at earlier epochs were
denser and gas-rich dissipative processes were more
it has been argued
important for galaxy formation
that galaxies that

In this
scenario because the number of early-type galaxies in-
creases with cosmic time and the more recently formed
galaxies are larger there is a direct connection between
the size and comoving mass density evolution in the
early-type galaxy population This is true even without
individual galaxies changing in size over time
This paper explores the extent to which the growth of
the population can account for the observed size evo-
lution andor whether additional mechanisms to in-
crease the size evolution of individual galaxies are re-
quired As a proof of concept we rst investigate the
present-day early-type galaxy population for clues that
indicate that evolution in the mass-size relation may be
expected purely due to evolution of the population not

lations than largeextended early-type galaxies with the
same mass In Section 3 we show that this is indeed
the case
Is there a parameter for which age and size
are independent Continuing along the track of previ-
ous work eg Bernardi et al 2005 Chang et al 2006
Graves et al 2008 which demonstrated that stellar ve-
locity dispersion  is the fundamental parameter be-
hind well-known correlations such as the color-magnitude
and mass-metallicity relations we show that  also cor-
relates with and perhaps drives the age of the stellar
population This suggests that formation epoch and 
are related
We cast this idea as an empirical relationship between
the velocity dispersion of an early-type galaxy and the
redshift zET at which it emerged as an early-type galaxy
This model to describe the population evolution of early-
type galaxies allows us to predict which portion of the
present-day early-type galaxy population already existed
at a given redshift z In turn such a   zET relation-
ship in conjunction with the present-day  distribution
thus describes the evolution with redshift of the proper-
ties of the population as a whole in particular its size
distribution This is akin to the concept of progenitor
bias van Dokkum  Franx 2001 As it turns out a
signicant size evolution is expected even in the absence
of size evolution of individual galaxies
Then we continue and include a prescription for
subsequent merging based on the cosmological simu-
lations of the dark matter halo assembly by Li et al
2007 The merger rates that we derive are in agree-
ment with those found empirically eg Bell et al 2006
Lotz et al 2008 Lin et al 2008 Because we exam-
ine the merger history after the last major episode of
star-formation activity and the transformation into an
early-type galaxy by denition these mergers are dis-
sipationless or dry van Dokkum 2005 Bell et al 2006
Naab et al 2006 Under reasonable assumptions for the
relationship between the properties of progenitors and
descendants based on numerical simulations of merging
gas-poor progenitors eg Ciotti  van Albada 2001
Gonzalez-Garca  van Albada 2003 Nipoti et al 2003
Boylan-Kolchin et al 2005 Robertson et al 2006 we
can predict how individual galaxies grow This evolu-
tion of individual galaxies is then superimposed on the
evolution of the population Section 4 A comparison
with the observations allows us to investigate whether the
continuous growth of the early-type galaxy population
with galaxies experiencing pung through dry mergers
is able to explain the observed size evolution with red-
shift or whether other perhaps unknown physical mech-
anisms must play a signicant role Potential caveats

2 SUMMARY OF HIGH-REDSHIFT OBSERVATIONS
Before describing and testing our model we summarize
the relevant high-redshift measurements that we seek to
explain These are the evolutions of the characteristic
size and the comoving mass density of early-type galaxies
from z  1 and z  2 to the present
21 The Early-Type Galaxy Population at z  1
Size evolution between z  1 and the present has
recently been measured by van der Wel et al 2008
who found at a given dynamical mass Re z  1 
z098011 for galaxies with masses M  1011 M
This corresponds to Re 1  Re 1Re006 
054  004 z  006 is the center of the redshift bin in
which we select our sample of nearby early-type galaxies
described in Section 3 and will be used throughout as a
benchmark
The second observational quantity we compare our
model with is the evolution of the comoving mass density
 We derive the change in the comoving mass density of
early-type galaxies with masses larger than 1011 M from
the evolution of the normalization  of the luminos-
ity function for red galaxies as measured by Faber et al
2007 Even though not all massive red galaxies have
early-type morphologies the fraction of early-type galax-
ies among these changes little between z  1 and the
present eg Bell et al 2004a van der Wel et al 2007
We assume that the characteristic mass at the knee of
the mass function M   71  1010 M does not change
implying that the evolution in  is identical to that in 
This assumption should hold because the evolution of the
ML as derived from evolution of the fundamental plane
zero point and the observed evolution of L cancel How-
ever it cannot be ruled out at this stage that M  changes
by  01 dex From the results presented by Faber et al
2007 we derive that 1  1006  035 013
for galaxies with mass M  1011 M where the error
includes an uncertainty of 01 dex in the evolution of M 
22 The Early-Type Galaxy Population at z  2
The observational constraints at higher redshifts are
far less secure than at z  1 due to limited sample
sizes and systematic uncertainties Simply extrapolating
the z  1 size evolution measurement mentioned above
to z  2 without regard to other measurements gives
Re2  036  004 Compiling all available data sets
at higher redshifts up to z  25 van der Wel et al
2008 found marginally faster evolution of Re z 
1  z120012 ie Re 2  029  004 Assum-
ing that the dierence between the robust but gener-
ously extrapolated z  1 results and the direct but
systematically uncertain z  2 results is indicative
of the true systematic error we conservatively adopt
Re2  03  01 as the most realistic estimate of the
size evolution between z  2 and the present We note
that all measurements have been obtained for galaxies
with masses M  1011 M At lower masses samples
are non-existent or severely biased
The observational constraints on  and hence 
are less secure at z  2 than at z  1 again
because of systematic uncertainties The latest es-
timate by Marchesini et al 2008 yields 24 
014005
008 for all galaxies with stellar masses larger than
1011 M

2008 Perez-Gonzalez et al 2008 are consistent with this
estimate Kriek et al 2008 have shown that already at

dierence between stellar mass and dynamical mass is negligi-
ble for the mass range of interest here van der Wel et al 2006

not depend on size or size does not depend on age at xed  c and d The same as panels a and b respectively but with H
line strength instead of age along the y-axis The trends are similar as those seen with age albeit with larger uncertainties Since H is a
robust age indicator the similar behavior in this gure of H and age demonstrates that the trends seen with age are not caused by model
uncertainties in the age estimates and cannot be articial e and f  The same as panels a and b respectively but with metallicity
instead of age along the y-axis As with age there is no correlation between size and metallicity at xed  We note that the size of the
SDSS spectroscopic aperture cannot explain the observed trends see Section 31 for details
z  24 the majority 568
12 of such massive galaxies
have red colors and that those show no or little evi-
dence for star-formation activity This number is some-
what lower than for the nearby massive galaxy popula-
tion which has a red sequence fraction of 77 In addi-
tion despite the quiescent nature of the red z  2 galax-
ies it is as yet unclear what their morphologies are They
are barely spatially resolved such that it is impossible to
tell whether they have smooth surface brightness proles
and constraints on the shape of their surface brightness
proles are rather poor even though Toft et al 2007
showed that exponential proles are perhaps a better
representation than De Vaucouleurs proles Given these
constraints on the evolution of the redearly-type frac-
tion among the massive galaxies at z  2 we arrive at

ulation of early-type galaxies
In this approach indi-
vidual early-type galaxies are assumed not to evolve af-
ter their formation in either mass or size A sample
of 17483 nearby early-type galaxies at redshifts 004 
z  008 has been constructed by Graves et al 2008
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS database
DR6 Adelman-McCarthy et al 2008 Only galaxies
with measured velocity dispersions on the red sequence
either without emission lines or with high OII-to-H
ratios and with concentration parameters C  25 are
included in the sample These criteria eectively exclude
star-forming galaxies but include genuine early-type
galaxies with nuclear activity see Yan et al 2006 For
the description of the velocity dispersions and the deter-
mination of eective radii as well as our dynamical mass
estimator Mdyn  R2
 we refer to van der Wel et al
2008 In addition we require that luminosity-weighted
stellar ages are available from Gallazzi et al 2005
16279 out of 17483 galaxies have such an age estimate
3 A SIMPLE EMPIRICAL MODEL I
DENSITY REFLECTS FORMATION EPOCH
We develop an empirical estimate of the formation
epoch of early-type galaxies based on the correlations
between the global properties of the present-day pop-
31 Correlations between Global Properties of
Early-Type Galaxies
It is well known that early-type galaxies with large
masses and velocity dispersions have older stellar popula-
Size and Number Density Evolution of Early-Type Galaxies
ticular narrow bin around   200 km s1 the size-age
distribution Again there is no sign that age depends
on size or vice versa Moreover the scatter is remark-
ably uniform and rather small  10 We could not
identify a parameter that correlates with the residual in
the size-age relation at xed  This includes environ-
ment using the Yang et al 2007 SDSS group catalog
we nd that the scatter in age does not correlate with
group membership the mass of the group the distance
to the group center or whether galaxies are centrals or
satellites see also van den Bosch et al 2008b
The age estimates are unavoidably model dependent
and may therefore be hampered by systematic uncertain-
ties In Figure 1c and 1d we replace stellar population
age by H absorption line strength The strength of this
Balmer line is relatively insensitive to metallicity and is
therefore a good tracer of age Although the random un-
certainties are substantially larger the picture remains
the same at xed dynamical mass the H line is stronger
for larger galaxies implying a younger stellar population
whereas at xed velocity dispersion there is no correla-
tion between size and line strength We conclude that
the trends with stellar population age in Figure 1a and
1b are robust and not articial
In Figures 1e and 1f we show the correlation between
size and metallicity As with age for the population
as a whole there is a positive correlation between size
and metallicity as expected from the combination of
the mass-metallicity relation and mass-size relations At
xed velocity dispersion Figure 1f however there is no
correlation between size and metallicity which is consis-
tent with the idea that the velocity dispersion traces the
potential well depth By necessity we also nd that at
xed dynamical mass the metallicity is smaller for large
galaxies see Figure 1e
The SDSS spectroscopic aperture does not sample
the entire galaxy therefore some aperture eects may
be expected age and metallicity gradients could in-
troduce articial trends in Figure 1 However aper-
ture eects would cause a positive correlation between
agemetallicity and size not the observed anticorrela-
tion Therefore we conclude that aperture eects do not
strongly aect our analysis
The emerging picture is consistent with previous work
It has been shown that at xed  there is no color-
magnitude relation Bernardi et al 2005 Graves et al
2008 which indicates that velocity dispersion more so
than luminosity determines the properties of the stellar
population unless some sort of conspiracy renders trends
invisible However this possibility is excluded by the
lack of a trend in Figures 1b 1d and 1f In addition
Chang et al 2006 nd that at xed velocity dispersion
there is almost no correlation between stellar mass and
absorption line indices
Very recently several authors have noted similar trends
or lack thereof as in our Figure 1 Graves et al 2009
show that at xed velocity dispersion age and metal-
licity do not correlate with galaxy size see our Figures
1b and 1f Moreover Shankar  Bernardi 2009 derive
the same trend that we show in Figure 1a at xed mass
old galaxies are smaller than young galaxies
Furthermore
Kaumann et al
of galaxy
Bell  de Jong
for any type
stellar mass surface density is a better
2004 showed that
Fig 2 Size vs stellar population age for present-day early-
type galaxies in a narrow range of velocity dispersion The line with
the errorbars is a running median while the other lines indicate
the scatter 1 and 2 The scatter is of order 10 and the
residual from the running median does not correlate with any other
parameter
tions than those with low masses and velocity dispersions
Trager et al 2000 Thomas et al 2005 Gallazzi et al
2006 Graves et al 2007
In Figure 1a we also show
that in our SDSS sample massive galaxies have older stel-
lar populations In the same gure it can also be seen
that naturally size increases with mass As a corollary
we have that loosely speaking galaxies with large sizes
have older stellar populations than galaxies with small
For these broad global trends it does not matter what
tracer of mass is adopted Dynamical mass and velocity
dispersion both show similar correlations with size and
age compare Figures 1a and 1b However the dier-
ence between the dynamical mass and the velocity dis-
persion comes to light when we dissect the sample and
look at the relation between age and size at xed dy-
namical mass or at xed velocity dispersion At a xed
dynamical mass there is an anti-correlation between size
and age large galaxies have younger stellar populations
than small galaxies Figure 1a This trend persists over
a mass range of almost two orders of magnitude from
 1010 M to  1012 M and there is no clear indi-
cation that the slope of the age-size relation depends on
The correlation between age and size at xed mass
implies that the zero point and scatter of the mass-size
relation will evolve with redshift even if we assume that
individual galaxies do not change in size This is simply
due to the fact that larger younger galaxies did not ex-
ist yet at earlier epochs This is in essence the model
prediction made by Khochfar  Silk 2006 The result
shown in Figure 1a provide the rst empirical evidence
for this process
It is perhaps surprising that the picture changes quite
dramatically if we look for an age-size relation for galax-
ies with a given velocity dispersion In Figure 1b it can
be seen that at a given velocity dispersion there is no ev-
idence that small galaxies are older than large galaxies
On the other hand if one realizes that Mdyn  Re2
the size-age relation has to be atter at xed  than
at xed Mdyn or may even be reversed The fact that
the relation should disappear altogether at xed  is
however not obvious In Figure 2 we show for one par-
van der Wel et al
predictor than stellar mass of the star-formation history
and current star-formation activity and surface density
is closely related to velocity dispersion This was made
explicit by Kaumann et al 2006 who showed that
there is a sharp transition in the fraction of quiescent
versus star-forming galaxies at particular values of both
surface density and velocity dispersion
These previous results and our result that age and size
at a given  are uncorrelated Figure 1b tell us some-
thing about the signicance of  as a and perhaps the
fundamental characteristic of a galaxy We now pursue
the idea that  can be used as a predictor of the epoch
when star formation was truncated and an early-type
galaxy emerged
32 The Formation Epoch of Early-Type Galaxies
As a starting point we take the observation by
Kaumann et al 2006 that at the present epoch the
transition between star-forming and quiescent galaxies
takes place at   125km s1 Truncation of star forma-
tion may be associated with the morphological transfor-
mation to an early-type galaxy and so we may suppose
that newly formed early-type galaxies in the present-day
universe have a velocity dispersion of ET  125 km s1
This transition is not innitely sharp in reality there are
late-type galaxies with higher  and early-type galaxies
with lower  We ignore this scatter in our model but in
Section 51 we will briey comment on the consequences
for our model predictions
Given such a velocity dispersion threshold for star-
formation activity in the present-day universe we may
expect that such a threshold existed at earlier epochs as
well but not necessarily with the same value The re-
lation between age and velocity dispersion Figure 1b
implies that ET would have had to be higher in the
past Observational evidence for the existence of ET at
high redshifts was recently found by Franx et al 2008
who used data extending to z  3 to show that there ex-
ists a surface mass density threshold ET above which
star-formation activity drops suddenly and signicantly
Interestingly this threshold was shown to be larger at
higher redshifts We parametrize the velocity dispersion
threshold for the truncation of star formation and the
transformation into an early-type galaxy as follows
ETz  125 km s1 1  z
Consequently given the velocity dispersion of a galaxy
we can estimate the redshift at which its star formation
was truncated and it attained its early-type morphology
zET  cid16
125 km s1cid171
Although precise constraints on the amount of evolu-
tion are still lacking due to systematic errors and small
sample sizes the results from Franx et al 2008 imply
that  must lie in the range 14    34
following we will adopt   34 as the standard value
which turns out to provide the best results We will dis-
cuss the dependence of our results on the chosen value
and the range allowed by the data in Section 5 We note
that the redshift dependence of ET is consistent with
the long-standing result from fundamental plane stud-
ies at high redshift that high-mass galaxies have stel-
lar populations with high formation redshifts z  2
see van Dokkum  van der Marel 2007 and references
therein and also with the observation that this forma-
tion redshift depends on mass low-mass galaxies having
younger stellar populations epochs van der Wel et al
2005 Treu et al 2005 In addition this is in agreement
with archaeological studies of nearby early-type galaxies
eg Thomas et al 2005 Gallazzi et al 2008
To quantify the model predictions for earlier epochs
we apply Equation 1 to our nearby galaxy sample only
retaining those with   ETz as galaxies that were
early types already at redshift z In Figure 3 we show
how the early-type galaxy population would build up at
dierent present-day masses for   34 Half of the
galaxies with present-day masses exceeding 1012 M had
become early types by z  2 while half of those with
masses exceeding 1011 M had become early types by
z  1 This behavior is reminiscent of the predictions
by eg De Lucia et al 2006 and Neistein et al 2006
who also predict that massive galaxies formed their stars
earlier than less massive galaxies
In addition to comoving mass density evolution Equa-
tion 2 also implies size evolution at xed dynamical mass
at a given mass large galaxies have smaller velocity dis-
persions and therefore became early-type galaxies more
recently Figure 4 shows the predicted evolution in the
size distribution from the present to z  1 and z  2
The behavior of the model is straightforward at progres-
sively higher redshifts the minimum velocity dispersion
of a galaxy the dotted lines in Figure 4 is higher as
dened by Equation 1 The resulting evolution in both
the number of galaxies and their size distribution can
readily be seen How does this model compare with the
observations described in Section 2 For z  1 we nd
1  061 and Re 1  081 both for galaxies with
mass M  1011 M and where the latter is the aver-
age oset from the local mass-size relation computed in
log-space The actually observed evolution is faster see
Section 21 and Figure 5 signicantly for the evolution
in average size and marginally for the mass density evo-
lution For z  2 the model predicts 2  009 and
Re2  071 The comoving mass density in this case
agrees well with the observed value The observed size
evolution however is much stronger than this model pre-
dicts see Section 22 and Figure 5
Despite the quantitative disagreements it is encour-
aging that this model which only prescribes a redshift-
dependent -threshold when galaxies stop forming stars
and become early types implies trends in the right di-
rection These results suggest that the continuous top-
down emergence of new early-type galaxies can explain
roughly half of the observed size evolution with indi-
vidual galaxies not changing after their initial transfor-
mation However an indication that individual galaxies
must change as well was recently found by Trujillo et al
2009 the local abundance of galaxies with the same
properties as the compact high-redshift objects is very
low implying that such galaxies did not survive in their
original form It is clear that size evolution of individual
galaxies has to occur as well
4 A SIMPLE EMPIRICAL MODEL II
GROWTH THROUGH MERGERS
Size and Number Density Evolution of Early-Type Galaxies
2007 We conclude that it is sensible to approximate
the merger histories of dark matter halos by assuming a
series of merger events with randomly chosen n in the
range 1  n  100
Since we are not interested in the merger history of a
halo growing from 1 of its present-day mass but rather
in the merger history of a halo between z  1 or z  2
and the present we need to know by how much halos
grow over that period of time Contrary to the distri-
bution of n the growth with time depends on halo mass
van den Bosch 2002 Wechsler et al 2002 We focus on
halo masses in the mass range Mhalo  1012  1013M
which corresponds to the halo masses of galaxies with
masses in the range M  1011  1012M In the Li et al
2007 simulations halos in this mass range had as-
sembled  50 of their present-day mass by z  1
Mz1  M 030009
 where 009 is the scatter and
 30 by z  2 Mz2  M 055028
Combining the elements discussed so far we have
the following practical method to construct the possi-
ble merger history between z  1 and the present for a
halo with present-day mass M  We assume a series of
mergers with mass ratios 1ni with 1  ni  100 a se-
quence of randomly chosen real numbers For example
the most recent merger involved a main progenitor with
mass n1Mn1 1 and a minor or accreted progenitor
with mass Mn1  1 The main progenitor is in turn
assumed to be the product of a merger with ratio 1n2
The main progenitor is followed in this manner assum-
ing a sequence of mergers with ratio 1ni up until the
point that the expected mass for the main progenitor at
z  1 is reached This expected mass is Mz1  M x
where x is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a
mean 030 and a standard deviation 009 To construct
the merger history between z  2 and the present the
only dierence is that we choose x from a Gaussian distri-
bution with mean 055 and a standard deviation 028
In practice in order to conserve mass the mass ratio
of the nal event is rounded such that the Mz1 is pre-
cisely M x
z0 In case x  0 which we formally allow we
assume that no mergers have occurred
This process describes the merger history of a halo
van den Bosch et al 2008a found that the vast major-
ity of the galaxies in the mass range of interest here
should be central galaxies We therefore assume that
the merger history of the halo directly corresponds to
the merger history of the galaxy We incorporate one
exception to this rule into the model mergers involv-
ing halos with mass Mhalo  1011 M do not increase
the mass of the galaxy but only the mass of the halo
This takes into account that such small halos contain
a much smaller fraction of stars eg Cooray  Sheth
2002 van den Bosch et al 2007 The growth in galaxy
mass is therefore somewhat slower than the growth in
halo mass As it turns out our model predictions are
not strongly aected by this In Section 52 we discuss
the eect of possible delays between mergers between ha-
los and mergers between their occupying galaxies
For each galaxy in the nearby sample we construct a
Monte Carlo realization of its merger history as described
above which predicts by how much the mass of the main
galaxy grows between z  1 z  2 and the present and
how the accreted mass is distributed over a number of ad-

izontal dotted line indicates a fraction of 50 High-mass galax-
ies emerged as early-type galaxies earlier than low-mass galaxies
Note that this evolutionary picture does not include merging as
described in Section 4
We now augment the simplistic model from Section 3
by a prescription to include subsequent merger activity
of galaxies after the epoch of transformation into early
types After constructing merger histories we describe
how mergers aect in our model the masses sizes and
velocity dispersions of early-type galaxies
41 Merger Histories
After they become early types galaxies still undergo
subsequent evolution in terms of merging andor mi-
nor episodes of star-formation activity without chang-
ing their overall morphological properties apart from
perhaps brief periods of time after accretion events
That this can lead to substantial size evolution has been
shown by Naab et al 2007 To include such evolution
schematically into our model we implement merger his-
tories based on simulations of dark matter halo assembly
from Li et al 2007
Following Li et al 2007 we dene n as the inverse
of the fractional mass increase in a merger
In other
words if the mass of the main progenitor is Mi then the
mass of the merger remnant is Mf  1  1nMi The
Li et al 2007 simulations demonstrate that the num-
ber of mergers does not depend on n ie the probability
distribution of n is at To realize merger histories we
can therefore assume a series of accretion events with ran-
domly chosen n We verify this simplied approach by at-
tempting to reproduce the merger histories that Li et al
2007 inferred starting with seed halos that have 1 of
their present-day mass When we allow mergers in the
range 1  n  100 we construct an ensemble of merger
histories with the same number of mergers with n  3
n  4 and n  6 as found by Li et al 2007 see their
Figures 11 and 12 In addition our scatter in the num-
ber of such mergers is also close to that found by Li et al
van der Wel et al

model described in Section 32 ie without merging The model presented in the middle column includes merging as described in Section
43 only considering the main progenitors of present-day early-type galaxies The model presented in the right-hand column includes in
addition all progenitors as described in Section 44 The top row in which all panels are identical shows the observed local mass-size

Equation 1 The middle row shows the predicted mass-size relation for z  1 The dotted line now corresponds to   210 km s1 which
is ET at z  1 The lighter gray scale reects the evolution in the number of galaxies In addition their size distribution is dierent The

Size and Number Density Evolution of Early-Type Galaxies
ditional progenitors at z  1 z  2 Hence we have
two sets of merger trees one that describes the z  1
progenitors and another that describes the z  2 progen-
itors The average number of mergers per galaxy with
mass ratios exceeding 12 is  025 between z  1 and the
present  055 between z  2 and the present the av-
erage number of mergers with mass ratios exceeding 14
is  040  090 Note that whereas the dry merger
rate per unit time per early-type galaxy was higher in
the past the dry merger rate per unit time and per unit
comoving volume was smaller due to the strong evolu-
tion in the comoving density of early-type galaxies The
merger rates in our model are consistent with or lower
than the available observational constraints on the dry
merger rate between z  1 and the present Bell et al
2006 Lotz et al 2008 Lin et al 2008
how the evolution in the number of early-type galaxies
and their size distribution is altered when we augment
the ET model from Section 3 by dry merging only con-
sidering the main progenitors Relative to the scenario
without merging the number of high-mass galaxies de-
creases more rapidly with redshift while the number
of lower-mass galaxies decreases less rapidly The aver-
age dierence in size is predicted to be somewhat larger
than in the absence of merging The agreement with
the observations improves considerably see Figure 5
The merger model now predicts a redshift evolution of
Re1  068 and Re 2  045 for the average size
at a given mass and 1  038 and 2  003 for
the comoving mass density The agreement with the ob-
servations is not perfect though the observed evolution
of the mean size is still  30 faster than predicted
42 The Eect of Dry Mergers on Galaxy Sizes
44 The Properties of Accreted Progenitors
A crucial part of the model
is the eect of merg-
ing on the sizes of galaxies Because we are inter-
ested in the merger history of galaxies that are al-
ready early types we focus on dissipationless dry
merging According to most numerical simulations the
remnants of gas-poor mergers of equal-mass progeni-
tors situated in dark halos have roughly twice the size
of those progenitors eg Ciotti  van Albada 2001
Gonzalez-Garca  van Albada 2003 Nipoti et al 2003
Robertson et al 2006 yet Boylan-Kolchin et al 2005
nd that the size of the remnant is typically only 15
times that of the progenitors This dierence may in
some cases be explained by the assumed orbits
bound orbit used by Boylan-Kolchin et al may be re-
sponsible for remnants that are smaller than found by
eg Ciotti et al who use a parabolic orbit However
not all simulations with bound orbits lead to small rem-
nants eg Robertson et al 2006 such that the rea-
son for the discrepancy is not completely clear
agreement with the majority of the predictions we as-
sume that equal-mass dry merger products have dou-
ble the size of the progenitors see Section 5 for fur-
ther discussion The virial theorem then implies that
the velocity dispersion remains constant supported by
the numerical simulations Moreover the results of
Gonzalez-Garca  van Albada 2003 and Nipoti et al
2003 suggest that for a dry merger with any mass ratio
the size of the main progenitor increases linearly with
mass keeping its velocity dispersion constant The im-
plied decrease in surface brightness is such that merg-
ers of this kind move galaxies roughly but not precisely
along the fundamental plane see eg Robertson et al
2006 This is reassuring because scenarios in which this
is not the case are dicult to reconcile with the observed
tightness of this scaling relation eg Rix et al 1994
These considerations allow us to directly and linearly link
the growth in mass and size in our merger scenario
43 The Evolution of the Main Progenitors
First we investigate the evolution of the main progen-
itors in the merger scenario described above ignoring
the smaller progenitors Because we assume that merg-
ers do not alter the velocity dispersion of the main pro-
genitor it is straightforward to combine the predicted
merger history from Section 41 with the formation red-
shift criterion described in Section 32 Figure 4 shows
At redshifts z  1 when few major mergers occur and
the growth of halos is relatively slow it is probably su-
cient to consider only the main progenitors as we did in
the previous section However at higher redshifts when
major mergers are more frequent and halos grow fast this
simplication may become inappropriate It is therefore
also necessary to include the smaller progenitors in the
analysis and assess the question how their masses and
sizes aect the evolution of the population averages In
the following we do not consider merger activity of the
smaller progenitors before their accretion onto a larger
object thus some of the uncertainty remains
We make two assumptions regarding the properties of
the minor progenitors First because we are mainly in-
terested in dry merging we assume that all progenitors
are early-type galaxies Second we assume that the ve-
locity dispersions of all progenitors are equal to the dis-
persion of the main progenitor and therefore also equal
to that of the nal descendant see Section 42 The
second assumption is seemingly quite extreme and is ob-
viously not valid for minor mergers However since the
goal is to predict only the abundance and sizes of pro-
genitors with mass M  1011 M this is not necessar-
ily a problem Moreover Equation 1 implies that in
our model all early-type galaxies at any epoch have a
minimum velocity dispersion ET At redshifts z  2
where smaller progenitors matter the number of early-
type galaxies is a rapidly declining function of veloc-
ity dispersion such that most galaxies available for dry
merging will have comparable velocity dispersions Thus
given the characteristics of our model so far it is defen-
sible that galaxies that partake in mergers at z  2 with
mass ratios 13 or 14 have similar velocity dispersions
The population of smaller progenitors by denition
have smaller masses than the population of main pro-
genitors Their inclusion will mostly aect the predicted
comoving mass density evolution at z  2 see Figure
4 Quantitatively the model predicts 1  045 and
2  005 both consistent with the data see Fig-
ure 5 The eect on the predicted evolution in average
size at xed mass is less pronounced the model predicts
Re1  063 and Re 2  040 not much slower
than observed the remaining disagreement is of order
1  2
Overall it is quite remarkable that such a simplistic
estimate of the redshift at which galaxies transform into
van der Wel et al
ies This remains to be an issue especially for the most
massive galaxies Bernardi 2007 Even a 5 systematic
error has major consequences for the z  2 predictions
because the number of galaxies with high dispersions de-
clines very rapidly with increasing dispersion This im-
plies that the formation-redshift distribution is rapidly
and perhaps articially truncated as well Increasing all
velocity dispersions by 5 leads to a higher comoving
mass density at z  2 by as much as a factor of 3 while
the increase at z  1 is just 10 whereas size evolution
is only slowed down by less than 5 over the entire red-
shift range We conclude that the predictive power of our
model regarding the comoving mass density evolution at
z  2 is likely limited by systematic uncertainties in the
velocity dispersions of massive nearby galaxies
A further simplication in our model is that there is
no scatter in the relationship between velocity disper-
sion and formation redshift As a result the predicted
comoving mass density evolution will be overestimated
particularly at z  2 where the model predictions depend
strongly on the steepness of the mass function It is be-
yond the scope of this paper to properly implement such
scatter as this would require a more advanced synthesis
between the formation epoch and merger history of the
galaxies in our simulated samples
Finally we assume that the truncation of star for-
mation coincides with a morphological transformation
Even though those events may have the same cause they
need not occur simultaneously
52 Uncertainties in the Estimated Merger Histories
We make the approximation see Section 41 that the
merging of dark matter halos is followed by the merging
of the galaxies within t  tHubble due to dynamical
friction In reality galaxies occupying merging halos may
merge not at all such as in the case of infall of a galaxy-
sized halo into a cluster-sized halo or they may merge
quickly such as in the case of two galaxy-sized equal-
mass halos Generally speaking the larger the mass-
ratio of a halo-halo merger the longer the delay of the
galaxy-galaxy merger see eg Boylan-Kolchin et al
2008 Kitzbichler  White 2008 It may therefore be
necessary to invoke a delay for galaxy mergers with re-
spect to halo mergers To obtain an upper limit we test
the eect of a long 25 Gyr delay on our model predic-
tions which is of the same order as the Hubble time at
high redshift and amounts to a few times the dynamical
time scale of large clusters In practice this means that
the galaxy merger activity between z  1 and the present
reects halo merger activity between z  2 and z  02
As a consequence major merger activity with mass ra-
tios of 12 or less is boosted substantially from 025 to 05
mergers per galaxy between z  1 and the present This
results in the stronger size evolution Re 1  057
and Re 2  035 which would be in excellent agree-
ment with the data see Figure 5 Both the observa-
tional and model uncertainties are too large however to
draw the conclusion that a delay in galaxy merger activ-
ity is preferable especially because the mass dependence
of this phenomenon is not taken into account
A merger delay for the galaxies under consideration
may indeed not be of great importance as cosmologi-
cal simulations that explicitly treat galaxy mergers as
separate from halo mergers nd similar merger rates

successfully reproduces both size and mass density evolution from
z  2 to the present
early types and the simple assumptions regarding their
subsequent merger activity can come so close to repro-
ducing the observations
5 MODEL UNCERTAINTIES
The model presented in Sections 3 and 4 is a drastically
simplied description of the formation and evolution of
early-type galaxies In this section we describe some of
the uncertainties that arise from the simplications and
their potential impact on the model predictions
51 Uncertainties in the Estimate of the Formation
As stated in Section 32 the value of the exponent
in Equations 1 and 2 was chosen a posteriori   34
producing the best results The model predictions are
quite sensitive to the choice of  Trying a range of values
for  we nd that for the standard version of our model
as described in Section 4 in order to be consistent with
all data at the 2 level the exponent has to have a value
in the range 065    085 This is consistent with
the results of Franx et al 2008 For lower values of
 we nd in particular that the predicted evolution of
the mean size is slower than observed For higher values
the predicted comoving mass density at z  2 is lower
than observed Clearly if we change the prescription for
merging see Sections 52 and 53 the allowed range for
 also changes however in order for the model to remain
consistent with the observed evolution of the comoving
mass density  has to be close to 075
A related problem is a possible systematic uncertainty
in the velocity dispersions of nearby early-type galax-
Size and Number Density Evolution of Early-Type Galaxies
for galaxies as we nd for halos Maller et al 2006
Khochfar  Silk 2008 This along with our nding that
any merger delay only increases the redshift evolution of
the mean sizes ie our model in this sense provides a
lower limit implies that our conclusions are not compro-
mised by the simple assumption that galaxies mergers are
instantaneous reections of halo mergers
53 Uncertainties in the Properties of Progenitors
Our modeling assumes that in a dry merger the size of
the main progenitor grows proportionally to its mass in-
crease We justify this choice in Section 4 but it is useful
to discuss its eect on the model predictions If a sub-
stantial amount of orbital energy were transferred from
the stellar component to the dark halo the descendant
would be more tightly bound than the progenitors This
would result in a fractional size change less than that in
mass which is what Boylan-Kolchin et al 2005 nd in
their simulations The results from Boylan-Kolchin et al
2005 in fact suggest that dry mergers move galaxies
along the slope of the present-day mass-size relation in
which case no redshift evolution in size at xed mass due
to merging would be expected Our approach implies
that no energy is transferred to the halo resulting in
large relatively loosely bound merger remnants with an
unchanging velocity dispersion in agreement with most
other simulations see Section 42 This is why mergers
play an important role in shaping the early-type galaxy
population in our modeling Conversely we would infer
that the strong redshift evolution of the mean size im-
plies that the amount of energy transferred to the halo
must be small
The above arguments make it very clear that our model
would not work without the assumption that galaxies
at least the main progenitors grow in size more or less
proportional to their mass The properties of the smaller
progenitors before merging with the main progenitors are
a separate but related issue In Section 44 we justied
our assumption that all progenitors partaking in a merger
have nearly the same velocity dispersion This breaks
down at lower redshifts where a reservoir of galaxies
with a large range in mass and dispersion is available
for merging
It is therefore useful to test the sensitiv-
ity of the model predictions on this assumption To do
so we consider the following alternative scenario the
smaller progenitors follow the present-day mass-size rela-
tion with respect to the main progenitor ie we assume
that their size ratios are MaccrMmain056 Shen et al
2003 van der Wel et al 2008 The virial theorem re-
quires lower velocity dispersions for the smaller progen-
itors than for the main progenitor By comparing this
lower velocity dispersion with the threshold associated
with the particular redshift that is being simulated ie
z  1 or z  2 we can decide in a very natural man-
ner within the context of our model whether the smaller
progenitor is a late-type galaxy or an early-type galaxy
If it has such a low dispersion that the implied formation
redshift according to Equation 2 is lower than the simu-
lated redshift it is omitted from the sample otherwise it
is retained Despite the substantially dierent approach
this exercise has a limited eect on the model predic-
tions The predicted size evolution is  10 slower and
the predicted comoving mass density evolution  10
faster We conclude that the assumptions regarding the
properties of the smaller progenitors are not of crucial
importance to the model predictions
It is in principle possible that in a minor merger
the relative increase in size is larger than the relative in-
crease in mass In the case of virialized progenitors and
remnants homology and zero energy transfer between
the stars and the dark matter halo following the analyt-
ical work of Boylan-Kolchin et al 2005 we derive that
the ratio of the radii of the merger remnant Rr and the
main progenitor Rm is
1  n2
n  n2 
where n as before is the mass ratio of the main pro-
genitor and the accreted progenitor and  is the slope
of the mass-size relation for the progenitors R  M 
For n   we have that RrRm  1  2n for   1
implying that for minor accretion events the relative
increase in size is close to twice the increase in mass
see also Naab et al 2009 This may provide an ex-
planation for the evolution of the most compact galaxies
in the observed z  2 samples eg Zirm et al 2007
van Dokkum et al 2008 which our model does not re-
produce The diculty in the context of our model
however is that knowledge of the nature of very small
accreted galaxies which in this scenario would be the
main contributors to size evolution becomes essential
It seems unrealistic to suppose that low-mass galaxies
are not gas rich and are not forming stars As a con-
sequence mergers will be dissipative with a dierent
eect on the evolution of the scaling relations see eg
Robertson et al 2006 Ciotti et al 2007 Hopkins et al
2009b A more complete description of the merger his-
tory of galaxies including a prescription for dissipation
will be required to fully explore the role of mergers with
large mass ratios However if energy transfer to the halo
is a minor factor the large number of expected minor ac-
cretion events could be a viable explanation for the most
compact observed galaxies at z  2
If minor mergers that are gas poor dominate the
growth of early-type galaxies size evolution can be
regarded as the assembly of a low-density envelope
around a high-density central region
In such a sce-
nario the compact high-redshift galaxies survive as
the centers of present-day massive galaxies The prop-
erties of the centers of local early-type galaxies and
the distant compact galaxies are
indeed not signif-
icantly dierent Bezanson et al 2009 Hopkins et al
2009a On the other hand there is no indication that
the outer envelopes of early-type galaxies the wings
of De Vaucouleurs-type surface brightness proles have
evolved since z  1 van der Wel et al 2008 We con-
clude that it is thus far unclear from an empirical per-
spective what the relative contributions of major and
minor merging are
Summarizing there are two elements of the model
that are essential to any success in explaining the ob-
servations rst the evolving velocity dispersion thresh-
old which is associated with the formation of early-type
galaxies second the growth of the main progenitor of
present-day early-type galaxies by means of the accre-
tion of mass through dry mergers in such a manner that
size grows proportionally to mass
van der Wel et al
6 TESTABLE PREDICTIONS
Our model predicts mass-dependent size evolution
with the high-mass end of the mass-size relation chang-
ing least with redshift see Figure 4 This is mainly
due to the higher formation redshifts of more massive
galaxies Such a trend is furthermore strengthened by
the presumed properties of the accreted progenitors de-
scribed in Section 44 This prediction is exactly opposite
to the prediction by Khochfar  Silk 2006 that massive
galaxies will display the strongest evolution This seem-
ing discrepancy may be explained if the star-formation
histories of galaxies in the Khochfar  Silk 2006 model
are closely linked to the assembly histories of their halos
We explicitly separate these processes by invoking a cri-
terion for galaxies transforming into early types that is
unrelated to the assembly history only considering fur-
ther assembly through dry merger events after the epoch
of their initial emergence as early-type galaxies
Unfortunately the current observations are not of
sucient quality to decide this matter The z 
1 mass-radius relation of the sample of early-type
galaxies with dynamical mass measurements used by
van der Wel et al 2008 has a somewhat steeper slope
than the local mass-size relation see also Ferreras et al
2009 but this is a marginal eect of order 2 and
which in addition could also be explained as a dier-
ence between cluster and eld galaxies
Interestingly
the z  2 samples show a hint that the reverse may
be the case van der Wel et al 2008 with samples with
the largest masses showing the largest osets from the
local mass-size relation in qualitative but not quantita-
tive agreement with the predictions by Khochfar  Silk
2006
Another feature predicted by our model is a decrease
with redshift in the scatter in size at xed mass see
Figure 4  This is simply because at xed mass the
larger galaxies are younger at earlier epochs the larger
galaxies at a given mass were not yet members of the
early-type galaxy population such that the scatter was
smaller than it is nowadays How rapidly the scatter is
predicted to evolve with redshift depends on the imple-
mentation of merger activity but regardless of the de-
tails a decrease with redshift is expected Therefore a
measurement of the scatter in the high-redshift mass-size
relation mainly tests our idea that there is a relation be-
tween age and size at xed mass which we already know
to exist given the archaeological properties of present-day
early-type galaxies see Figures 2 and 1 The eect of
dry mergers on the scatter is in our model of secondary
importance The z  1 observations are consistent with
a non-evolving scatter within 2 but the best-tting
value points toward smaller scatter at earlier epochs see
van der Wel et al 2008 in agreement with our model
Clearly larger samples are required to conrm this ten-
tative result
Our study here concerns several fundamental scaling
relations for early-type galaxies It is therefore interest-
ing to consider the implications of our model for another
fundamental scaling relation that we have not mentioned
so far the connection between super-massive black holes
and their host galaxies eg Kormendy  Richstone
1995 Magorrian et al 1998 Ferrarese  Merritt 2000
Gebhardt et al 2000 Graham et al 2001 In our dry-
merger scenario the growth of galaxies is obviously con-
nected to the growth of the mass of the central black
hole M We assume that  remains constant in dry
mergers Section 42 whereas the mass of the halo the
galaxy and that of the black hole grow more or less pro-
portionally Hence the evolution of M is more closely
linked to the evolution of the total mass of both the halo
and the galaxy than to  However note that this is not
an argument against a fundamental relationship between
 and M that may have determined the initial shape of
the scaling relations between black-hole and bulge prop-
erties It is as yet unclear what the intrinsic scatter in
these scaling relations is or whether one of the relations
is fundamental in the sense that the intrinsic scatter is
zero eg Tremaine et al 2002 Ferrarese  Ford 2005
Nor is it clear if and in which direction the M scal-
ing relations evolve with redshift for non-active galax-
ies despite recent progress for galaxies with active nu-
clei eg Salviander et al 2007 Woo et al 2008 In the
context of our model evolution with redshift is expected
and the intrinsic scatter is unlikely to be zero Scatter
and redshift evolution in the M- relation is expected
due to continuous dry merging and the variety of the
merger history of galaxies with a given  see Section
41 The scatter should then correlate with the size of
the galaxy bulge Furthermore assuming that  and
M are initially related scatter and evolution in the M-
Mdyn bulge mass relation is expected due to the -
dependent formation redshift of galaxies and the scatter
in the relationship between  and Mdyn see Section
32 The scatter should then correlate with size and the
age of the stellar population However the current ob-
servational constraints on both the scatter of the present-
day black-hole scaling relations and their evolution with
redshift are not suciently accurate to provide evidence
against or in favor of our model
Indications that the
scatter indeed correlates with a third parameter have
been found eg Marconi  Hunt 2003 but the sta-
tistical signicance of these results is quite marginal and
their interpretation still debated eg Graham 2008
In addition to the M- relation the model presented
here also predicts some characteristics of other scaling
relations such as the Faber-Jackson Faber  Jackson
1976 and M g2   Dressler et al 1987 relations
Equal-mass dry mergers have little eect on the M g2 
 relation as both the metallicity and the velocity dis-
persion remain unchanged The scatter may decrease
somewhat as merging will
lead to regression to the
mean metallicity at xed velocity dispersion Unequal-
mass mergers will slightly decrease the metallicity of
the merger remnant compared to the metallicity of the
main progenitor because of the mass-metallicity rela-
tion which may somewhat increase the scatter in the
M g2   relation
If we assume that luminosity is a
proxy for mass our model predicts scatter in the Faber-
Jackson relation This reects the variety in the merger
history of galaxies and is equivalent to the expected scat-
ter in the M- relation Hence our model predicts a
correlation between the scatter in the M- relation and
the Faber-Jackson Both of these should also correlate
with galaxy size The correlation between the scatter in
Faber-Jackson relation and galaxy size is of course well
known The existence of the fundamental plane is there-
fore consistent with a scenario in which dissipationless
Size and Number Density Evolution of Early-Type Galaxies
merging plays an important role
7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We present a simple empirically motivated model that
simultaneously predicts the evolution in the mean size
and the comoving mass density of early-type galaxies be-
tween z  2 and the present A large sample of nearby
early-type galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey serves as the starting point The redshifts at
which galaxies transform into early-type galaxies ie
their formation redshifts are estimated based on an
evolving velocity dispersion threshold ET above which
galaxies have low specic star-formation rates This is
motivated in part by the observation that the stellar
population age of present-day early-type galaxies is a
simple function of their velocity dispersion
In addi-
tion to a prescription for estimating formation epochs
several merging scenarios between the formation epoch
and the present are explored Merger trees are generated
such that they match the results from simulations of the
mass assembly history of dark matter halos Assuming
dissipationless dry merging and a simulation-inspired
prescription for the eect of such mergers on the size
of galaxies we successfully reproduce both the observed
evolution in the mean size and in comoving mass den-
sity of early-type galaxies with mass M  1011 M be-
tween z  2 and the present Our model quantitatively
explains the recently measured substantial size evolu-
tion of early-type galaxies Our model does so by com-
bining the continuous emergence of early-type galaxies
starting with systems with the highest velocity disper-
sion with subsequent merging Recently and from the
very dierent perspective of hydrodynamical simulations
Hopkins et al 2009b also considered such a combina-
tion of growth of the population and growth of individual
galaxies and arrived at similar conclusions
We emphasize that our model for estimating the for-
mation redshifts of early-type galaxies is entirely phe-
nomenological We have so far not addressed the ques-
tion why the velocity dispersion would be closely related
to the formation redshift Surely this is related to the
formation of bulges perhaps regulated by feedback mech-
anisms An obvious connection can be made between the
crucial role that velocity dispersion plays in our model
and the importance of black hole growth It will be in-
teresting to see whether a theoretical framework can be
constructed that explains from rst principles that early-
type galaxies which form during a certain epoch have
velocity dispersions that are independent of mass
The most troubling issue of our model which aects
the merger part is the eect of mergers on the sizes
of the descendants As mentioned in Section 42 some
confusion remains in the literature describing the results
from numerical simulations Even if this issue is resolved
it will remain unclear how a multitude of minor accretion
events will aect size evolution In principle a stronger
eect on the sizes of the main progenitors than we assume
in our model is physically possible This may explain the
presence of very compact galaxies in the z  2 samples
however dissipation will have to be incorporated in our
model to make realistic predictions which is beyond the
scope of this study
Besides the possibly underestimated eect of minor ac-
cretion events in our model there are other potential
solutions to the puzzle that the most compact galaxies
present First the systematic uncertainties in the ob-
servations may still be underestimated the ultimate test
would be a direct measurement of the velocity disper-
sion Initial steps in this direction were recently taken
by Cenarro  Trujillo 2009 They nd based on an
analysis of stacked spectra that the velocity dispersions
of quiescent galaxies at z  15 may be somewhat higher
than those of present-day galaxies with the same stel-
lar mass Second physical mechanisms besides merging
may play a role A recently proposed idea is that quasar
feedback is perhaps responsible for the observed size evo-
lution through the ejection of gas simultaneously pro-
viding an explanation for the cessation of star formation
and the increase in size Fan et al 2008 An indication
that this cannot be the mechanism that fully explains
the observed size evolution is that a substantial frac-
tion of this evolution took place between z  1 and the
present over this period massive early-type galaxies are
known not to undergo phases of intensive nuclear activ-
ity On the other hand quasar feedback could contribute
at higher redshifts providing an explanation for the re-
maining discrepancy between our model predictions and
the most compact galaxies found at z  2
