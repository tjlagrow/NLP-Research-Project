ABSTRACT
We study the galaxy morphology-luminosity-environmental relation and its redshift evolution using
a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey GOODS In the
redshift range of 04  z  10 we detect conformity in morphology between neighboring galaxies
The realm of conformity is conned within the virialized region associated with each galaxy plus dark
matter halo system When a galaxy is located within the virial radius of its nearest neighbor galaxy
its morphology strongly depends on the neighbors distance and morphology the probability for a
galaxy to be an early type fE strongly increases as it approaches an early-type neighbor but tends
to decrease as it approaches a late-type neighbor We nd that fE evolves much faster in high density
regions than in low density regions and that the morphology-density relation becomes signicantly
weaker at z  1 This may be because the rate of galaxy-galaxy interactions is higher in high density
regions and a series of interactions and mergers over the course of galaxy life eventually transform late
types into early types We nd more isolated galaxies are more luminous which supports luminosity
transformation through mergers at these redshifts Our results are consistent with those from nearby
galaxies and demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy interactions have been strongly aecting the galaxy
evolution over a long period of time

1 INTRODUCTION
The role of environment in determining galaxy proper-
ties is one of key issues in galaxy formation and evolution
In particular galaxy morphology is known to depend on
environment It was rst noted by Hubble  Humason
1931 who found a large population of ellipticals
and lenticulars in galaxy clusters Later systematic
studies for the connection between galaxy morphology
and environment suggested the morphology-radius re-
lation Oemler 1974 and the morphology-density re-
lation MDR Dressler 1980 MDR was detected in
the group environment Postman  Geller 1984 and
was also found in galaxy clusters at redshifts up to 1
Dressler et al 1997 Treu et al 2003 Smith et al 2005
Postman et al 2005
Since the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS York et al
2000 and Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey
2dFGRS Colless et al 2001 have produced unprece-
dentedly large photometric and spectroscopic data of
nearby galaxies the environmental dependence of galaxy
properties in local universe has been extensively re-
visited eg Goto et al 2003 Balogh et al 2004ab
Tanaka et al 2004 Blanton et al 2005 Weinmann et al
2006 Park et al
Park  Hwang 2008 Among them Park et al 2007
found that the environmental dependence of various
galaxy properties is almost entirely due to their corre-
lation with morphology and luminosity that depend on
the local density If both morphology and luminosity are
xed galaxy properties such as color color gradient con-
centration size velocity dispersion and star formation
rate SFR are nearly independent of the local density
This study was extended by Park et al 2008 who took

into account the eect of the nearest neighbor galaxy
They found that galaxy morphology depends critically
on the small-scale environment which is characterized
by the morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy and
the mass density due to the nearest neighbor galaxy in
addition to the luminosity and the large-scale density
They suggested a unied scenario that the morphology
and luminosity of a galaxy change through a series of
galaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers
More recently Park  Choi 2009 investigated the de-
pendence of galaxy properties on both the small- and
large-scale environments They found two characteris-
tic pair-separation scales where the galaxy properties
abruptly change the virial radius rvirnei of the near-
est neighbor galaxy where the eects of galaxy inter-
action emerge and 005 rvirnei where the galaxies in
a pair start to merge The role of large-scale den-
sity is weak when morphology and luminosity are xed
Park  Hwang 2008 reported that the morphology
transformation in massive galaxy clusters is driven by
hydrodynamic interactions between galaxies and by re-
peated gravitational interactions among galaxies or be-
tween galaxies and their host cluster Surprisingly the
galaxy morphology does not depend on the local galaxy
number density at xed luminosity and xed nearest
neighbor separation They found that the morphology-
radius relation exists within the cluster virial radius but
that galaxy morphology is determined almost entirely
by the nearest neighbor distance and morphology out-
side the cluster virial radius The MDR is only an ap-
parent phenomenon through the statistical correlation of
the local galaxy number density with luminosity and the
nearest neighbor distance
The MDR beyond the local universe was investi-
gated mostly in high density regions of galaxy clus-

Cooper et al 2008 The MDR and CDR observed lo-
cally are also found at high redshifts z  1 but the
slope of the relation appears to be dierent from the local
one It means that galaxy morphology or color evolves
dierently depending on the background density in the
sense that the stronger evolution is seen in high density
regions Interestingly the SFR-density relation at high
redshifts z  1 is reversed compared to the local one
Namely the SFR of high redshift galaxies is larger in high
density regions than in low density regions Elbaz et al
2007 Cooper et al 2008
These observational ndings raised important ques-
tions 1 whether the correlations between the galaxy
properties and the local density are the consequence
of environmental-driven evolution 2 which relation is
the most fundamental one Cooper et al 2006 2007
Poggianti et al 2008 The physical mechanism of envi-
ronmental eects on the galaxy properties is also poorly
understood Cooper et al 2006 Moreover there are
few studies that focus on the role of the nearest neighbor
galaxy which turned out to be very important in the evo-
lution of galaxy morphology and luminosity Park et al
2008 Since the galaxy interactions and mergers with
neighbor galaxies may be more frequent at high redshifts
it is necessary to investigate the role of neighbor galax-
ies in determining the properties of high redshift galaxies
hoping that the main mechanism for galaxy evolution be
understood
In this paper we study the morphology and luminosity
of high redshift galaxies adopting the method similar to
that used for nearby SDSS galaxies Park et al 2008

study Environmental dependence of galaxy morphology

21 Observational Data Set
We used a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in GOODS
GOODS is a deep multiwavelength survey covering two
carefully selected regions including the Hubble Deep
Field North HDF-N and the Chandra Deep Field
South CDF-S Hereafter two GOODS elds centered

approximately 300 arcmin2 and each region was ob-
served by NASAs Great Observatories HST Spitzer
and Chandra ESAs XMM-Newton and several ground-
based facilities HST observations with Advanced Cam-
era for Surveys ACS were conducted in four bands

ages have a pixel scale of 003 pixel1 and point-
spread function FWHM of 01 Spectroscopic data
for GOODS sources are enormous in the literature
GOODS-North Cohen et al 2000 Cowie et al 2004
Wirth et al 2004 Reddy et al 2006 and GOODS-South
Szokoly et al 2004 Le Fevre et al 2004 Mignoli et al
2005 Vanzella et al 2005 2006 2008 Ravikumar et al
2007 Popesso et al 2009 Among the sources in the
ACS photometric catalog we used 4443 galaxies whose
reliable redshifts are available in the literature for further
analysis
Since we are going to investigate the eects of the near-
est neighbor galaxies it is important to identify genuine
neighbor galaxies In addition since we use a spectro-
scopic catalog of galaxies combined from various red-
shift surveys with diverse selection criteria our sample
is heterogeneous Therefore it is necessary to know the
completeness of our spectroscopic sample accurately To
compute the spectroscopic completeness we used a sam-
ple from the ACS photometric catalog with the objects
having SExtractor stellarity class greater than 079 The
value was chosen from the stellarity distribution of gen-
uine stars conrmed by the spectroscopic observation In
Figure 1 we plot the completeness of each survey as a
function of the observed magnitude SExtractor BEST
magnitude and color It is seen that the completeness
decreases signicantly near i775WBEST  235 The
mean completeness at i775WBEST  235 is 69 and
63 for GOODS-North and -South respectively
Evolution of Galaxy Morphology

the spectroscopic sample of galaxies in GOODS-North a and
GOODS-South b Solid lines dene the volume-limited sample
used in this study
noted that the completeness below the magnitude limit
changes signicantly with color which can cause a bias
in the studies of galaxy morphology
The rest frame B-band absolute magnitude MB of
galaxies is computed based on the ACS photometry with
Galactic reddening corrections Schlegel et al 1998 and
K-corrections Blanton  Roweis 2007 The evolution
correction an increase of 13MB per unit redshift was
applied to compute the nal rest frame MB Faber et al
In Figure 2 we show the evolution corrected
rest frame MB as a function of redshift for the sam-
ple of galaxies with i775WBEST  235 We nally
dene a volume-limited sample of 1332 galaxies with
MB  180 and 04  z  10 for further analysis
22 Morphology Classication
For the volume-limited sample of galaxies shown in
Figure 2 we visually inspected the images in individual
Bviz bands and Bvi pseudo-color images We divided
the galaxies into two morphological types early types
ES0 and late types SIrr Early-type galaxies are
those with little uctuation in the surface brightness and
color and with good symmetry while late-type galaxies
show internal structures andor color variations in the
pseudo-color images However the total color itself is
not used as a classication criterion We checked our re-
sults by comparing with the morphological classication
of Bundy et al 2005 who used the same ACS images
as ours and found that 98 of our classications agree
with those of Bundy et al Some galaxies that were clas-
sied as early types in Bundy et al 2005 are found to
be late types in this study because of color variations in
the pseudo-color images
To see how often we classify galaxies dierently because
we classied galaxies in dierent wavelength bands across
redshift we made the following experiment We classi-
ed galaxies at 04  z  06 brighter than MB  180
using their v- or i-band images separately and checked if
the morphological types of each galaxy agree with each
other At z  09 the i-band is centered at 4000A in the
Fig 3 Velocity dierence between the target galaxies with
185  MB  200 and their neighbors brighter than MB  05
as a function of the projected separation Early- and late-type
target galaxies are in left and right panels respectively Galaxies
of GOODS-North are in a and b and those of GOODS-South
in c and d
rest frame and this wavelength roughly corresponds to
the v-band at z  05 We found no galaxy was assigned
dierent morphology Therefore our morphology clas-
sication is not expected to be aected by the redshift
eects
23 Galaxy Environment
We consider two kinds of environmental factors a sur-
face galaxy number density estimated from ve nearest
neighbor galaxies 5 as a large-scale environmental pa-
rameter and the distance to the nearest neighbor galaxy
rp as a small-scale environmental parameter
The background density 5
is dened by 5 
p51 Dp5 is the projected proper distance to the
5th-nearest neighbor The 5th-nearest neighbor of each
target galaxy was identied among the neighbor galaxies
with MB  180 that have velocities relative to the tar-
get galaxy less than 1000 km s1 to exclude foreground
and background galaxies
To dene the small-scale environmental parameter at-
tributed to the nearest neighbor we rst nd the nearest
neighbor of a target galaxy that is closest to the target
galaxy on the projected sky and satises the conditions
of magnitude and relative velocity We searched for the
nearest neighbor galaxy among galaxies that have mag-
nitudes brighter than MB  MBtarget  05 and have
relative velocities less than v  vneighbors  vtarget 
600 km s1 for early-type target galaxy and less than
v  400 km s1 for late-type target galaxy These
values are the same as those used for selecting the near-
est neighbor galaxy in the SDSS data Park et al 2008
Since we use the volume-limited sample of galaxies with
MB  180 we study only the target galaxies brighter
than MBtarget  185 so that their neighbors are com-
In Figure 3 we plot the velocity dierence for all neigh-
bor galaxies with velocity dierence less than 900 km
s1 To t the velocity distribution we used the Gaus-
Hwang  Park
sian plus constant model for each type of target galaxies
by combining the data in two surveys We obtained for
the galaxies at projected proper distance rp  100 h1
kpc the best-ts values v  35148 and 216103 km
s1 for early- and late-type target galaxies respectively
It indicates that the velocity limit used for selecting the
nearest neighbor is large enough not to miss the neighbor
galaxies
The spectroscopic completeness can aect the identi-
cation of the genuine nearest neighbor The complete-
ness that depends on the apparent magnitude and color
as shown in Figure 1 can also depend on the distance
between galaxies due to the diculty in observing galax-
ies close to each other using multi-object spectrograph
MOS We checked the completeness as a function of
the projected distance to the target galaxy and found
that it does not change with the projected distance It
might be because we combined spectroscopic data from
numerous references therefore the diculty in observing
nearby galaxies using MOS is signicantly reduced
The virial radius of a galaxy is dened as the radius
within which the mean mass density is 200 times the
critical density of the universe c and is given by
rvir  3L4200c13
where L is the galaxy luminosity and  is the mass-to-
light ratio We assume that the mass-to-light ratio of
early-type galaxies is on average twice as large as that of
late-type galaxies at the same absolute magnitude MB
which means early 2late see 25 of Park  Choi
2009 and 2 of Park et al 2008 The critical den-
sity of the universe c is a function of redshift z and
mz  czbz  cz1  z3 where b and 
are the mean matter densities in proper and comoving
spaces respectively Then the virial radius of a galaxy
at redshift z in proper space can be rewritten by
rvirz  3Lm0800m01  z3  013
m0 and 0 are the density parameters at the present
epoch We compute the mean mass density  using the
galaxies at z  0407 with various absolute magnitude
limits varying from MB  175 to 200 We found
that the mean mass density appears to converge when the
magnitude cut is fainter than MB  180 which means
that the contribution of faint galaxies is not signicant
because of their small masses
In this calculation we
weigh each galaxy by an inverse of completeness accord-
ing to its apparent magnitude and color see Fig 1 We
obtain   00145L20 h1Mpc3 where L20 is
the mass of a late-type galaxy with MB  20 This -
nal value we adopted is computed using all galaxies with
i775WBEST  235 and 04  z  07 to account for the
contribution of faint galaxies as much as possible
If we adopt m0  027 and 0  073 the virial
radii of galaxies with MB  185 and 200 at z  0
are 220 and 350 h1 kpc for early types and 180 and
280 h1 kpc for late types respectively The proper-
space virial radii of galaxies with the same luminosities
as above but located at z  1 are 160 and 250 h1 kpc
for early types and 120 and 200 h1 kpc for late types
respectively

31 Background Density Dependence of Galaxy
Morphology
In Figure 4 we plot the fraction of early-type galaxies
as a function of the background density 5 To account
for the incompleteness shown in Figure 1 the early-type
fraction is computed by weighing each galaxy by the
inverse of completeness corresponding to its apparent
magnitude and color Each of the volume-limited sam-
ples is divided into brighter 1925  MB  2000
and fainter 1850  MB  1925 subsamples The
solid and dotted lines are early type-fractions fE for
brighter and fainter subsamples respectively The un-
certainties of the fraction represent 68 1 condence
intervals that are determined by the bootstrap resam-
pling method Figure 4 clearly shows that the early-
type fraction increases along with 5 ie MDR which
is already known in similar high redshift surveys eg
Capak et al 2007 We note that the overall early-type
fraction is higher for the brighter subsamples in all sur-
It implies that the morphology-luminosity rela-
tion is already well-established at the redshifts under
study The background density dependence of morphol-
ogy seems stronger for the brighter galaxies In partic-
ular the early-type fraction of the brighter sample rises
sharply at high densities of 5  10 h2 Mpc2
32 Eects of the Nearest Neighbor
To measure the eects of the nearest neighbor galaxy
on the galaxy morphology we plot in Figure 5 the frac-
tion of early-type galaxies as a function of the distance
to the nearest neighbor We can see the probability that
a galaxy is found to be an early type strongly depends
on the projected distance to the nearest neighbor galaxy
rp as well as neighbors morphology When a galaxy
is located farther than the virial radius from its nearest
neighbor galaxy rp  rvirnei the early-type fraction
slowly increases as the distance to the neighbor decreases
but its dependence on neighbors morphology is weak
On the other hand when rp  rvirnei the early-type
fraction increases as the target galaxy approaches an
early-type neighbor but decreases as it approaches a

nearest neighbor galaxy The distance is normalized with respect
to the virial radius of the nearest neighbor Galaxies in the com-
bined GOODS-North plus South sample are used in a those of
GOODS-North sample in b and those of GOODS-South in c
late-type neighbor It is important to note that the bifur-
cation of the early-type fraction occurs at rp  rvirnei
In the case of the cosmology we adopt the radius rp 
rvirnei corresponds to the local mass density due to the
neighbor of n  740 The bifurcation of the early-type
fraction at rp  rvirnei is similarly found by Park et al
2008 using nearby z  01 SDSS galaxies
To investigate the eects of large-scale environment on
the morphology in company with the eects of the near-
est neighbor galaxy we study the early-type fraction in
the two-dimensional environmental parameter space as
shown in Figure 6
In this case the combined sample
of GOODS-North plus South is used Galaxies are dis-
tributed along the diagonal in this gure due to the sta-
tistical correlation between rp and 5 But there is a
signicant dispersion in rp at xed 5 It is noted that
galaxies are located in wide ranges of 5 and rp for both
early- and late-type neighbor cases even though the early
types tend to have relatively larger 5 and smaller rp In
this gure one can study the dependence of fE on rp at
each xed value of 5 by moving along a vertical line
Figure 6 clearly shows that when rp  rvirnei the de-
pendence of morphology on the background density and
the nearest neighbor distance becomes completely dier-
ent when the neighbors morphology changes When the
neighbor is a late type fE of target galaxies is about 02
and is almost independent of rp or 5 But when the
neighbor is an early type fE can rise up to 07 when
the target galaxy enters a region with the background
density exceeding 5  10h2Mpc2 There is also a
discontinous rise in fE when the galaxy approaches the
neighbor closer than about 03rvirnei which corresponds
to 50  100h1kpc When rp  rvirnei galaxy morphol-
ogy is independent of all environmental factors and fE
is about 02 It should be emphasized that the dierence
between the left and right panels of Figure 6 is mani-
fest only when rp is less than about 2rvirnei As noted
above a direct eect of the existence of the neighbor on
fE is evident at the neighbor distance of rp  03rvirnei
Fig 6 Morphology-environment relation when the nearest
neighbor galaxy is an early type upper or a late type lower
Contours show constant early-type galaxy fraction fE Galaxies
used here are brighter than MB  185
in the case of early-type nearest neighbor This conrms
the net eects of the nearest neighbor on morphology
at xed large-scale environment for the GOODS galax-
ies However the eects of late-type neighbors do not
appear as strong as what is seen for the nearby SDSS
galaxies Park  Choi 2009 More data with a higher
completeness are needed to conrm it
In Figure 7 we plot the evolution-corrected rest frame
MB as a function of the distance to the nearest neighbor
for the combined sample of GOODS-North plus South
with MB  185 The lines show the median value in
each projected separation bin Top panels show that the
early-type galaxies having rp  rvirnei are signicantly
brighter than those at rp  rvirnei while the magni-
tude dierence for late-type galaxies in the two regions
is smaller If we divide the galaxies into those in rela-
tively higher density region 5  6 h2 Mpc2 and those
in lower density region 5  6 h2 Mpc2 the increase
of galaxy luminosity with increasing rp is manifest in the
high density region
4 DISCUSSION
41 Morphology and Luminosity Transformation
We found in Figure 5 that the morphological types of
high redshift galaxies depend critically on the small-scale
environment which is characterized by the morphology
of the nearest neighbor galaxy and the distance to the
nearest neighbor galaxy
If our results are aected by
the trend that the early-type fraction fE is higher when
the local density is higher ie MDR fE should be a

and f Number in parenthesis is the number of galaxies in the combined sample or local density subsample
function of rp which is independent of the neighbor mor-
phology and the two curves in the top panel of Figure
5 have the same amplitude at each neighbor separation
The fact that fE is independent of neighbor morphology
at rp  rvirnei but starts to show a signicant depen-
dence at rp  rvirnei demonstrates that the neighbor
eects are the dominating factor of the change in fE and
the large-scale background density is not
Increase of fE with decreasing the neighbor distance
at rp  rvirnei can be explained by the tidal eects of
neighbor galaxy Park et al 2008 showed that tidal en-
ergy deposit relative to the binding energy for the dark
halos of equal mass galaxies is not negligible at the sep-
aration of virial radius The tidal eects can accelerate
the consumption of cold gas changing late types to early
types In fact Park  Choi 2009 showed that the cen-
ter of late-type galaxies becomes bluer by the existence of
neighbor galaxies even when rp  rvirnei independently
of the morphological type of the neighbor Their surface
brightness and central velocity dispersion increase as the
neighbor distance decreases implying the growth of the
bulge component
The bifurcation of fE at rp  rvirnei was interpreted
as due to the hydrodynamic eects of the nearest neigh-
bor Park et al 2008 If a target galaxy approaches a
late-type neighbor within one virial radius of the neigh-
bor the cold gas of the neighbor can ow into the target
galaxy and the target galaxy tends to become a late type
On the other hand if the target galaxy approaches an
early-type neighbor within one virial radius of the neigh-
bor the hot gas and the tidal force of the neighbor ac-
celerate the consumption of cold gas so that the target
galaxy tends to evolve to an early type
Moreover it is noted in Figure 6 that the galaxies tend
to be early types when they have close early-type neigh-
bors even though they are in low density regions and the
galaxies are likely to be late types when they have close
late-type neighbors even though they are in high density
regions The galaxy morphology appears to depend on
the large-scale background density But it may be the re-
sult of the cumulative eects of neighbor interaction that
is stronger in high density regions Park et al 2008
We also found in Figure 7 that isolated galaxies are
brighter than less isolated ones These results can pro-
vide important hints for the evolution of galaxies Previ-
ously Park et al 2008 obtained results similar to ours
using the SDSS data see their Fig 6 and suggested a
unied scenario as follows Once the separation of two
galaxies becomes small enough namely rp  005rvirnei
Park  Choi 2009 they undergo a merger and the
merger product will be more massive The merger prod-
uct will typically nd itself isolated from its neighbors
of comparable mass As galaxies experience a series of
merger events the cold gas will be exhausted due to the
merger-induced star formation Thus the massive galax-
ies are likely to be early types As a supporting evidence
for this scenario they showed that at xed background
density post-merger features such as large displacement
of the galaxy nucleus from the center turmoil features
andor very close double cores are more frequently seen
in the isolated galaxies compared to the less isolated ones
We extended our analysis to another multiwavelength
survey AEGIS of which survey area 710 arcmin2 is
larger than GOODS 300 arcmin2 Using AEGIS data
we measured the early-type fraction of target galaxies as
a function of the nearest neighbor distance eg Fig 5
and found that the early-type fraction does not change
signicantly with the neighbor distance even though it
showed dependence on the large-scale background den-
sity Furthermore it does not show the bifurcation in ac-
cordance with neighbors morphology These results are
inconsistent with those from GOODS and SDSS samples
Evolution of Galaxy Morphology
Fig 8 Early-type fraction in the combined GOODS-North
plus South sample as a function of redshift Filled and open circles
indicate the early-type fraction in high and low density regions
respectively located at the median redshift in each redshift bin
eg Park et al 2008 Park  Choi 2009 The results
from AEGIS may have been signicantly aected by the
low completeness of DEEP2 survey Since the complete-
ness of DEEP2 spectroscopic survey is only about 05 it
is expected that the nearest neighbor is seriously misiden-
tied compared to the case using the GOODS or SDSS
data Our Monte Carlo experiment shows that the frac-
tion of the misidentied nearest neighbor reaches about
50 when the sample completeness is 50 We there-
fore conclude that it is not appropriate to study galaxy
interactions using the DEEP2AEGIS data
42 Redshift Evolution of Galaxy Morphology
If galaxies transform their morphology through a se-
ries of interactions and mergers it is expected that the
high-redshift galaxies on average are less massive and
richer in cold gas Successive consumption of cold gas in
galaxies through interaction and merger events is likely
to transform late types into early types And then
the early-type fraction at high redshifts is expected to
be lower compared to that at low redshifts and the
fraction of blue early types among early types to be
higher at higher redshifts Park et al 2008 Capak et al
2007 see also Conselice et al 2005 2008 Lotz et al
2008 Menanteau et al 2004 Lee et al 2006 Puzia et al
2007 Moreover the early-type fraction is expected to
evolve dierently depending on the background density
Park et al 2008 Since the mean separation between
galaxies is relatively smaller and the mergerinteraction
rate is higher in high density regions galaxies are ex-
pected to show a stronger time evolution in morphology
as well as luminosity color and SFR in high density
regions On the contrary in low density regions where
the mean separation between galaxies is larger the time
evolution of galaxies is expected to be slower because
the interactions and mergers among galaxies are less fre-
There have been several studies of the evolution of mor-
phology of high redshift galaxies focusing on the role of
environment For example Nuijten et al 2005 used

galaxies with n  2 in the eld does not change with
redshift while that in the high density region tends to
increase toward the low redshift When they use red
galaxies with u  g   1 the fraction of red galaxies
increases as redshift decreases in all environments How-
ever since they used photometric redshifts to estimate
the local density the environment was not accurately
determined In fact Cooper et al 2007 found no time
evolution of the fraction of red galaxies in low density re-
gions at 04  z  135 using spectroscopic redshift data
of DEEP2 galaxy redshift survey though the number of
red galaxies in their sample may be too small to draw a
statistically signicant conclusion
Recently Capak et al 2007 used Gini parameter to
select early-type galaxies in COSMOS data They found
that the early-type fraction in all environments grows
as redshift decreases and the growth rate is larger in
high density regions compared to that in low density re-
gions However in low density regions with 100 galax-
ies Mpc2 the early-type fraction at z  04 changes
little with redshift van der Wel et al 2007 adopted a
combination of Sersic index n and bumpiness of galaxies
as a proxy of galaxy morphology in SDSS and GOODS-
South data They found no time evolution of the early-
type fraction at z  08 for both cluster and eld regions
They suggested that the reason why they could not nd
the evolution of the early-type fraction even in high den-
sity regions is because they used mass-selected samples
and dierent morphological classication from the other
studies
To conrm the environmental dependence of evolution
of galaxy properties we present the early-type fraction as
a function of redshift in Figure 8 We divide our sample
according to the redshift and the background density It
shows that the early-type fraction in high density regions
is higher than that in low density regions in all redshift
intervals explored Moreover the early-type fraction in
high density regions increases much more rapidly as red-
shift decreases It indicates a strong evolution of galaxy

morphology in high density regions which is consistent
with the observational results of some of previous studies
and also with the predictions of Park et al 2008
Since our study indicates that the nearest neighbors
derive the transformation of galaxy morphology it is
important to check galaxy morphology has evolved un-
der strong inuence of the nearest neighbors Figure
9 is such an examination We divided our sample into
two subsets containing galaxies with early- or late-type
neighbors In this analysis we included only those galax-
ies that are interacting with neighbors rp  rvirnei
For the early-type fraction at low redshifts we used the
SDSS galaxies with 200  Mr  215 and z  01
and whose magnitudes roughly fall into our MB magni-
tude range Choi et al 2007 Park et al 2008 Figure 9
clearly shows that the early-type fraction monotonically
increases as redshift decreases and the early-type frac-
tion for the case of early-type neighbor is always larger
than that for the late-type neighbor case Primordial ori-
gin is not likely to be the reason for this systematic dier-
ence because the neighbor eects are limited within rel-
atively tiny volume of the universe associated with each
galaxy see Fig 5 As a comparison the RMS displace-
ment of matter in the at CDM universe is 77h1Mpc
by z05 more than an order magnitude larger than
the virial radius of typical galaxies Park  Kim 2009
This result demonstrates an important role of the near-
est neighbor in the evolution of galaxy morphology and
is consistent with the prediction that the early-type frac-
tion from high to low redshifts will increase because a
series of interactions and mergers tend to transform late
types into early types
In summary the early-type fraction in high density re-
gions increases signicantly as redshift decreases while
that in low density regions increases much more gently
The evolution of galaxy morphology is also found to de-
pend critically on the small-scale environment which is
characterized by the morphology of the nearest neighbor
galaxy and the distance to the nearest neighbor galaxy
in addition to the large-scale background density A large
sample of high redshift galaxies is needed to separate be-
tween the roles of small- and large-scale environments
We also found that isolated galaxies are brighter than
less isolated ones All these results are consistent with
the predictions of Park et al 2008 and conrm their
unied scenario of transformation of galaxy morphology
and luminosity class at high redshifts
It implies that
galaxy-galaxy interactions play an important role in the
evolution of morphology and luminosity classes of galax-
ies over a long period of time
5 CONCLUSIONS
eters We examined the eects of the nearest neighbor
galaxy and the local galaxy number density on the galaxy
morphology Our main results are as follows
1 The early-type fraction increases with the surface
galaxy number density estimated from 5th-nearest
neighbor galaxies 5 This conrms the MDR
followed by high redshift galaxies 04  z  10
2 When a galaxy is located farther than the virial
radius from its nearest neighbor galaxy the prob-
ability for the galaxy to be an early type fE de-
creases with increasing distance and is indepen-
dent of morphological type of the nearest neighbor
3 When the separation with the nearest neighbor
galaxy is smaller than the virial radius of the neigh-
bor fE increases as the target galaxy approaches
an early-type neighbor but tends to stay constant
as it approaches a late-type neighbor Conformity
in morphology between neighboring galaxies is con-
rmed at high redshifts The realm of conformity
is conned within the virialzed region associated
with each galaxy plus dark halo system
4 We nd that more isolated galaxies are more lumi-
nous It can be explained by the luminosity evolu-
tion of galaxies through a series of mergers
5 The early-type fraction fE increases very rapidly
as redshift decreases in high density regions but
increases only mildly in low density regions At
z  1 the MDR seems very weak and it should be
conrmed by higher redshift data Our ndings are
consistent with the prediction of Park et al 2008
that the early-type fraction evolves much faster in
high density regions than in low density regions
because the rate of galaxy-galaxy interactions is
higher in high density regions and a series of inter-
actions and mergers through a cosmic time trans-
form late types into early types
The critical role of galaxy-galaxy interactions in
the evolution of galaxy properties has been con-
rmed in the general environment Park et al 2008
Park  Choi 2009 and in the galaxy cluster environ-
ment Park  Hwang 2008 at low redshifts The results
of the present work extend the previous ndings to high
redshifts We plan to further extend our analysis to even
higher redshift universe and to high redshift clusters
Using the spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the
GOODS we presented evidence for morphology and lu-
minosity transformation of galaxies at 04  z  10 We
determined the morphological types of all high redshift
galaxies by visual inspection and used spectroscopic red-
shifts of galaxies to determine the environmental param-
