Abstract A new ChemoDynamical Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamic CD-SPH code is presented The disk
galaxy is described as a multifragmented gas and star sys-
tem embedded in a cold dark matter halo with a rigid po-
tential eld The star formation SF process SNII SNIa
and PN events and the chemical enrichment of gas have
all been considered within the framework of the standard
SPH model which we use to describe the dynamical and
chemical evolution of triaxial disklike galaxies It is found
that such approach provides a realistic description of the
process of formation chemical and dynamical evolution of
disk galaxies over a cosmological timescale
Key words chemical and dynamical evolution of disk

1 Introduction
The dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies is one of
the most interesting and complex of problems Naturally
galaxy formation is closely connected with the process of
largescale structure formation in the Universe
The main role in the scenario of largescale struc-
ture formation seems to be played by the dark matter
It is believed that the Universe was seeded at some early
epoch with low density uctuations of dark nonbaryonic
matter and the evolving distribution of these dark ha-
los provides the arena for galaxy formation Galaxy for-
mation itself involves collapse of baryons within poten-
tial wells of dark halos White  Rees 1978 The prop-
erties of forming galaxies depend on the amount of bary-
onic matter that can be accumulated in such halos and
the eciency of star formation The observational sup-
port for this galaxy formation scenario comes from the
recent COBE detection of uctuations in the microwave
background eg Bennett et al 1993

The investigation of galaxy formation is a highly com-
plex subject requiring many dierent approaches The for-
mation of selfgravitating inhomogeneities of protogalac-
tic size the ratio of baryonic and nonbaryonic matter

Eisenstein  Loeb 1995 Steinmetz  Bartelmann 1995
and the protogalaxys collapse and its subsequent evo-
lution are all usually considered as separate problems
Recent advances in computer technology and numeri-
cal methods have allowed detailed modeling of baryon
matter dynamics in the universe dominated by colli-
sionless dark matter and therefore the detailed gravi-
tational and hydrodynamical description of galaxy for-
mation and evolution The most sophisticated models
include radiative processes star formation and super-
nova feedback eg Katz 1992 Steinmetz  Muller 1994
Friedli  Benz 1995
The results of numerical simulations are essentially af-
fected by the star formation algorithm incorporated into
modeling techniques The star formation and related pro-
cesses are still not well understood on either small or large
spatial scales such that the star formation algorithm by
which the gas material is converted into stars can only be
based on simple theoretical assumptions or on empirical
observations of nearby galaxies The other most impor-
tant eect of star formation on the global evolution of a
galaxy is caused by a large amount of energy released in
supernova explosions and stellar winds
Among numerous methods developed for the modeling
of complex three dimensional hydrodynamic phenomena
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics SPH is one of the
most popular Monaghan 1992 Its Lagrangian nature al-
lows easy combination with fast Nbody algorithms mak-
ing it suitable for simultaneous description of the complex
dynamics of a gasstellar system Friedli  Benz 1995
As an example of such a combination the TREE-SPH
Hernquist  Katz 1989 Navarro  White 1993
Peter Berczik ChemoDynamical SPH code for evolution of star forming disk galaxies
was successfully applied to the detailed modeling of disk
galaxy mergers Mihos  Hernquist 1996 and of galaxy
formation and evolution Katz 1992 The second good ex-
ample is a GRAPE-SPH code Steinmetz  Muller 1994

model the evolution of disk galaxy structure and kinemat-
In recent years there have been excellent papers con-
cerning the complex SPH modeling of galaxy formation
and evolution Raiteri et al 1996 Carraro et al 1997
Our code proposes new energetic criteria for SF and
suggest a more realistic account of returned chemically
enriched gas fraction via SNII SNIa and PN events
The simplicity and numerical eciency of the SPH
method were the main reasons why we chose this tech-
nique for the modeling of the evolution of complex multi
fragmented triaxial protogalactic systems We used our
own modication of the hybrid NbodySPH method
Berczik  Kravchuk 1996 Berczik 1998 which we call
the chemodynamical SPH CD-SPH code
The dark matter and stars are included in the
standard SPH algorithm as the Nbody collisionless sys-
tem of particles which can interact with the gas com-
ponent only through gravitation Katz 1992 The star
formation process and supernova explosions are also in-
cluded in the scheme as proposed by Raiteri et al 1996
but with our own modications
2 The CD-SPH code
21 The SPH code
Continuous hydrodynamic elds in SPH are described by
the interpolation functions constructed from the known
values of these functions at randomly positioned parti-
cles Monaghan 1992 Following Monaghan  Lattanzio
1985 we use for the kernel function Wij the spline ex-
pression in the form of

neighborhood of each particle within the 2  hi remains
constant Mihos  Hernquist 1996 The value of NB is
chosen such that a certain fraction of the total number
of gas particles N aects the local ow characteristics
Hiotelis  Voglis 1991 If the dened hi becomes smaller
than the minimal smoothing length hmin we set the value
hi  hmin For dark matter and star particles with
Plummer density proles we use accordingly the xed
gravitational smoothing lengths hdm and hstar
If the density is computed according to Equation 2
then the continuity equation is satised automatically
Equations of motion for particle i are
i  ii  iext
where Pi is the pressure i is the self gravitational
potential ext
is a gravitational potential of possible
external halo and avis
is an articial viscosity term
Hiotelis et al 1991 The energy equation has the form
ivi 
i  i
Here ui is the specic internal energy of particle i The
term i  ii accounts for non adiabatic processes not
associated with the articial viscosity in our calculations
i  0 We present the radiative cooling in the form
i  iui i  
i Ti  n2
where ni is the hydrogen number density and Ti the
temperature To follow its subsequent thermal behaviour
in numerical simulations we use an analytical approxi-
mation of the standard cooling function T  for an op-
tically thin primordial plasma in ionization equilibrium
Dalgarno  McCray 1972 Katz  Gunn 1991 Its abso-
lute cuto temperature is set equal to 104 K
The equation of state must be added to close the sys-

To achieve the same level of accuracy for all points in
the uid it is necessary to use a spatially variable smooth-
ing length In this case each particle has its individual
value of h Following Hernquist  Katz 1989 we write

In our calculations the values of hi were determined
from the condition that the number of particles NB in the

To solve the system of Equations 3 4 and 5 we
use the leapfrog integrator Hernquist  Katz 1989 The
time step ti for each particle depends on the particles ac-
celeration ai and velocity vi as well as on viscous forces
To dene ti we use the relation from Hiotelis  Voglis
1991 and adopt Courants number Cn  01
We carried out Berczik  Kolesnik 1993 a large se-
ries of test calculations to check that the code is correct
the conservation laws are obeyed and the hydrodynamic
elds are represented adequately all with good results

23 The star formation algorithm
It is well known that star formation SF regions are as-
sociated with giant molecular complexes especially with
regions that are approaching dynamical instability The
early phase of star formation does not seem to crucially
aect the dynamics of a galaxy From the beginning of
the collapse such a system decouples from its surround-
ings and evolves on a completely dierent timescale When
the chemically enriched gas content of the galaxy de-
creases the heating by winds and supernova explosions
Leitherer et al 1992 begins to play an important role
in the dynamics of the galaxy The overall picture of
star formation seems to be understood but the detailed
physics of star formation and accompanying processes on
either small or large scales remains sketchy Larson 1969
Silk 1987
All the above stated as well as computer constrains
cause the using of simplied numerical algorithms of de-
scription of conversion of the gaseous material into stars
which are based on simple theoretical assumptions andor
on results of observations of nearby galaxies
To describe of the process of converting of gaseous ma-
terial into stars we modify the standard SPH star forma-
tion algorithm Katz 1992 Navarro  White 1993 tak-
ing into account the presence of random motions in the
gaseous environment and the time lag between the ini-
tial development of suitable conditions for star forma-
tion and star formation itself Berczik  Kravchuk 1996
Berczik 1998 The rst reasonable requirement incorpo-
rated into this algorithm allows selecting gas particles
that are potentially eligible to form stars It states that in
the separate gas particle the SF can start if the absolute
value of the gas particles gravitational energy exceeds
the sum of its thermal energy and the energy of random
motions
i  Ech
Gravitational and thermal energies and the energy of
random motions for the gas particle i in model simula-
tion are dened as
i   3
5  G  m2
2  mi  c2
2  mi  v2


where ci  p  Ti is the isothermal sound speed
of particle i We set   13 and dene the random or
turbulent square velocities near particle i as
mj  vj  vc2
mj  vj
For practical reasons it is useful to dene a critical
temperature for SF onset in particle i as
   G  i  h2
i  v2
Then if the temperature of the gas particle i drops
below the critical one SF can proceed
Ti  T crit
We think that requirement 8 or in another form 13
is the only one needed It seems reasonable that the chosen
gas particle will produce stars only if the above condi-
tion hold over the interval that exceeds its free - fall time
tf f  p3  32  G   This condition is based on the
well known fact that due to gravitational instability all
substructures of a collapsing system are formed on such a
timescale Using it we exclude transient structures that
are destroyed by the tidal action of surrounding matter
from consideration
We also dene which gas particles remain cool
ie tcool  tf f  We rewrite this condition as presented
in Navarro  White 1993 i  crit Here we use the
value of crit  003 cm3
When the collapsing particle i is dened we create the
new star particle with mass mstar and update the gas
particle mi using these simple equations
mstar    mi
mi  1    mi
Here  dened as the global eciency of star forma-
tion is the fraction of gas converted into stars according
to the appropriate initial mass function IMF The typ-
ical values for SF eciency in our Galaxy on the scale
of giant molecular clouds are in the range   001  04
Duerr et al 1982 Wilking  Lada 1983 But it is still a
little known quantity In numerical simulation the model
parameter has to be checked by comparison of numerical
simulation results with available observational data Here
we dene  as
  1  Eth
i  Ech
i   Egr
with the requirement that all excess mass of the gas
component in a starforming particle which provides the
inequality  Egr
 is transformed into the
star component In the code we set the absolute maxi-
mum value of the mass of such a star particle mstar
25 106 M ie  5 of the initial particle mass mi

At the moment of stellar birth the position and veloc-
ities of new star particles are equal to those of parent
gas particles Thereafter these star particles interact
with other gas star or dark matter particles only by
gravitation The gravitational smoothing length for these
Plummer like particles is set equal to hstar
24 The thermal SNII feedback
We try to include the events of SNII SNIa and PN in the
complex gasdynamic picture of galaxy evolution But for
the thermal budget of the ISM only SNII plays the main
role Following Katz 1992 we assume that the explo-
sion energy is converted totally into thermal energy The
stellar wind action seems not to be essential in the en-
ergy budget Ferriere 1995 The total energy released by
SNII explosions 1044 J per SNII within a star particle
is calculated at each time step and distributed uniformly
between the surrounding ie rij  hstar gas particles
Raiteri et al 1996
25 The chemical enrichment of gas
Every star particle in our SF scheme represents a sep-
arate gravitationally closed star formation macro region
like a globular cluster The star particle is character-
ized by its own time of birth tbegSF which is set equal
to the moment of particle formation After the formation
these particles return the chemically enriched gas into sur-
rounding gas particles due to SNII SNIa and PN events
For the description of this process we use the approxima-
tion proposed by Raiteri et al 1996 We consider only
the production of 16O and 56Fe and try to describe the
full galactic time evolution of these elements from the
beginning to present time ie tevol  130 Gyr
With the multipower IMF law suggested by Kroupa
et al 1993 the distribution of stellar masses within a
star particle of mass mstar is then
209  m13
if 01  m  05
m  mstar  A 
if 05  m  10
a0Z  10130  00755  log Z  00081  log Z2

a2Z  12620  03385  log Z  00542  log Z2


These relations are based on the calculations of
the Padova group Alongi et al 1993 Bressan et al 1993
Bertelli et al 1994 and give a reasonable approximation
to stellar lifetimes in the mass range from 06 M to
120 M and metallicities Z  7  105  003 dened
as a mass of all elements heavier than He In our cal-
culation following Raiteri et al 1996 we assume that Z
scales with the oxygen abundance as ZZ 16O16O
For those metallicities exceeding available data we take
the value corresponding to the extremes
We can dene the number of SNII explosions inside a
given star particle during the time from t to tt using
a simple equation
NSNII 
mdeadt
mdeadtt
mdm
where mdeadt and mdeadt  t are masses of stars
that end their lifetimes at the beginning and at the end of
the respective time step We assume that all stars with
masses between 8 M and 100 M produce SNII for
which we use the yields from Woosley  Weaver 1995

nes the total ejected mass by one SNII - mtot

the ejected mass of iron - mFe

where tdead is expressed in years m is in solar units
and coecients are dened as
Following van den Hoek  Groenewegen 1997 Sam-
land 1997 and Samland et al 1997 we assume that
all stars with masses between 1 M and 8 M pro-
duce PN We dene the average ejected masses in
solar units of one PN event as Renzini  Voli 1981

a value of NB  1 Ngas provides qualitatively correct
treatment of the systems large scale evolution
As the initial model relevant for CDM - scenario
we took a constantdensity homogeneous gaseous triaxial
conguration Mgas  1011 M within the dark matter
halo Mhalo  1012 M We set A  100 kpc B  75
kpc and C  50 kpc for semiaxes of system Such triaxial
congurations are reported in cosmological simulations of
the dark matter halo formation Eisenstein  Loeb 1995
Frenk et al 1988 Warren et al 1992 Initially the cen-
ters of all particles were placed on a homogeneous grid
inside this triaxial conguration We set the smoothing
parameter of CDMH bhalo  25 kpc These values of
Mhalo and bhalo are typical for CDMH in disk galaxies
Navarro et al 1996 Navarro et al 1997 Burkert 1995
The gas component was assumed to be cold initially
T0  104 K As we see in our calculations the inuence
of random motions essentially reduces the dependence of
model parameters on the adopted temperature cuto and
therefore on the adopted form of the cooling function it-
The gas was assumed to be involved in the Hubble
ow H0  65 kmsMpc and the solid - body rotation
around z - axis We added small random velocity compo-

tions of fragments The initial velocity eld was dened

is assumed that the model galaxy halo contains the

3 Results and discussion
31 Initial conditions
After testing our code demonstrated that simple assump-
tions can lead to a reasonable model of a galaxy The
SPH calculations were carried out for Ngas  2109 gas
particles According to Navarro  White 1993 and Rai-
teri et al 1996 such a number seems adequate for a
qualitatively correct description of the systems behaviour
Even this small a number of gas particles produces
Nstar  31631 star particles at the end of the calcu-
lation
The value of the smoothing length hi was chosen to
require that each gas particle had NB  21 neighbors
within 2  hi Minimal hmin was set equal to 1 kpc and
the xed gravitational smoothing length hstar  1 kpc
was used for the star particles Our results show that
where x y z is the angular velocity of an initially
rigidly rotating system
The spin parameter in our numerical simulations is
  008 dened in Peebles 1969 as
 L0  p Egr
G  Mgas  Mhalo52 
L0 is the total initial angular momentum and Egr
the total initial gravitational energy of a protogalaxy It
is to be noted that for a system in which angular mo-
mentum is acquired through the tidal torque of the sur-
rounding matter the standard spin parameter does not
exceed   011 Steinmetz  Bartelmann 1995 More-
its typical values range between   007004

tions of gas particles at the nal time step tevol  130
Gyr The box size is 50 kpc In Fig 5 we present the
distributions of star particles The star distributions
have dimensions typical of a disk galaxy The radial ex-
tension is approximately 25  30 kpc The disk height is
around 1  2 kpc In the center the bar -like structure
is developed as a result of strong initial triaxial structure

whole in the plane of the disk we can see the spiral - like
distribution of particles with extended arm laments The
gas particles are located within central 5  10 kpc
Except for the central region  2 kpc the gas dis-
tribution has a exponential form with radial scale length
 28 kpc The column density distributions of gas gasr
and stars r are presented in Fig 6 The total column
density is dened as totr  gasr  r The to-
tal column density distribution totr is well approxi-
mated in the interval from 5 kpc to 15 kpc with an
exponential prole characterized by a  35 kpc radial
scale length This value is very close to one a reported
recently 35 kpc for the radial scale length of the to-
tal disk mass surface density distribution obtained for our
Galaxy Mera et al 1998b The value of tot  55 M
pc2 near the location of the Sun r  9 kpc is close to a
recent determination of the total density 52 13 M pc2
Mera et al 1998a
Fig 7 shows both the rotational velocity distribu-
tion of gas Vrotr resulting from the modeled disk
galaxy calculation and the rotational curve for our Galaxy
Vallee 1994 both of which are very close
The gaseous radial Vradr and normal Vzr velocity
distributions are in Fig 8 and Fig 9 The radial veloc-
ity dispersion has a maximum value  60 kms in the
center a high value mainly caused by the central strong
bar structure Near the Sun this dispersion drops down
to  20 kms Such radial dispersion is reported in the
kinematic study of the stellar motions in the solar neigh-
borhood Bienayme 1998 while the normal dispersion is
near  20 kms in the whole disk This value also coin-
cides with the vertical dispersion velocity near the Sun
Bienayme 1998
We present the temperature distribution of gas T r in
Fig 10 As seen the distribution of T r has a very large
scatter from 104 K to 106 K In our calculation we set the
cuto temperature for the cooling function at 104 K the
gas cant cool to lower temperatures
The modeled process of SNII explosions injects to a
great amount of thermal energy into the gas and gener-
ates a very large temperature scatter also typical of our
Galaxys ISM At each point even with crude numerical
approximations a good t can be reached for all dynami-
cal and thermal distributions of gas and stars in a typical
disk galaxy like our Galaxy
33 Chemical characteristics
Fig 11 shows the time evolution of the SFR in galaxy

verted into stars at the end of calculation The most in-
tensive SF burst happened in the rst  1 Gyr with a
maximal SFR  35 Myr After  15  2 Gyr the SFR
is decreases like an exponential function until it has a
value  1 Myr at the end of the simulation To check

The agemetallicity relation of the star particles in
the solar cylinder FeHt is shown in Fig 12 with
observational data taken from Meusinger et al 1991 and
Edvardsson et al 1993 while in Fig 13 we presented
the metallicity distribution of the star particles in the
solar cylinder NFeH The model data are scaled to
the observed number of stars Edvardsson et al 1993 In
Fig 12 each model point represents the separate star
particle The mass of each star particle is dierent from
 104 M up to  25 106 M because the star forma-
tion eciency -  is dierent in each star forming region
The model point is systematically higher than the obser-
vations especially near the t  5 Gyr but if we also
analyze the mass of each star particle we see that the

more massive particles systematically show lower metal-
licity than the observations If one divides the metallicity
to equal zone and calculate the sum of the mass in each
metallicity zone in Fig 12 we get the results in Fig 13
and in this gure we see what the model mass distribution
has shifted to the lower metallicities
007 dexkpc From observations of PN of dierent
types Maciel  Koppen 1994 we obtained the values
003 dexkpc for PNI 0069 dexkpc for PNII 0058
dexkpc for PNIII 0062 dexkpc for PNIIa and 0057
dexkpc for PNIIb All this agrees well with the oxygen
radial gradient in our Galaxy

ticles in the solar cylinder one found in Fig 14 In this
gure we also present the observational data from Ed-
vardsson et al 1993 and Tomkin et al 1992 All these
model distributions are in good agreement not only with
presented observational data but also with other data col-
lected from Portinari et al 1997
The OH radial distribution OHr is shown in
Fig 15 The approximation presented in the gure is ob-
tained by a least - squares linear t At distances 5 kpc
 r  11 kpc the models radial abundance gradi-
ent is 006 dexkpc In the literature we found dier-
ent values of this gradient dened in objects of dierent
types From observations of HII regions Peimbert 1979
Shaver et al 1983 we obtained oxygen radial gradient
34 Conclusion
This simple model provides a reasonable selfconsistent
picture of the processes of galaxy formation and star for-
mation in the galaxy The dynamical and chemical evo-
lution of the modeled disklike galaxy is coincident with
observations for our own Galaxy The results of our model-
ing give a good base for a wide use of the proposed SF and
chemical enrichment algorithm in other SPH simulations
