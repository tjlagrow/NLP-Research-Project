Abstract We analyse a Far InfraRed FIR catalogue
of galaxies at 60 m with a ux limit of  110 mJy ex-
tracted from a deep subsample of the IRAS Faint Source
Survey Monte-Carlo simulations and optical identication
statistics are used to put constraints on the evolution of
galaxies in the FIR We nd evidence for strong evolution
of IRAS galaxies in luminosity  1  z32 0203 or
density  1  z60 0507 for f60m  150 mJy in
agreement with previous claims An excess of rather red
faint optical counterparts with B  18 consistent with
the above evolution is detected We interpret these re-
sults as strong evolution at recent times among the star-
burst or dusty AGN population of merginginteracting
galaxies Most of these objects at moderate redshifts may
pass unnoticed among the population of massive spirals
in broad-band optical surveys because of large amounts
of dust extinction in their central regions A possible link
with the strong evolution observed in the optical for blue
sub-M  galaxies is discussed

1 Introduction
This is the second paper in a series where we try pho-
tometricaly to quantify galaxy evolution at low redshifts
z  03 from reasonably large and homogeneous sam-
ples We have shown in Bertin  Dennefeld 1996 paper
I that optical galaxy counts were consistent with little
evolution down to BJ  21 corresponding to z  02 for
M  galaxies In this paper we investigate the case of the
far-infrared domain

The Far-InfraRed FIR is very sensitive to ongoing
star-formation activity in galaxies Warm dust essentially
heated by the blueUV continuum of young OB stars
makes a large contribution to the total FIR output of late-
type objects At the same time a signicant heating by
an Active Galactic Nucleus AGN is possible in the most
luminous FIR-emitting objects although the respective
contributions of star-formation and AGNs are not yet well
determined In this context a statistical analysis of a deep
and homogeneous FIR-selected galaxy sample should eas-
ily allow one to trace evolution of star-formation andor
AGN activity with redshift
The IRAS InfraRed Astronomical Satellite survey
with its four infrared channels at 12 25 60 and 100 m
provides a unique tool for such studies despite its moder-
ate sensitivity Based on the Point Source Catalog PSC
and the more recent Faint Source Catalog FSC extracted
from the IRAS data several workers have investigated
the evolution hypothesis on subsamples reaching various
depths The situation is still somewhat unclear although
evolution seems to be detected at 60 m in most cases
Using PSC data with solid identications and radial ve-
locities Saunders et al 1990 claimed a very strong evo-
lution eect in their sample while Fisher et al 1992
found theirs compatible with no evolution the latter has
however a somewhat lower median redshift Using the
deeper FSC data Lonsdale et al 1990 found evidence
for strong evolution from source number counts Oliver
et al 1995 reported also evolution in their spectroscopic
subsample though at a slightly milder rate Two deeper
studies Hacking  Houck 1987 and Gregorich et al 1995
made on much smaller specic areas a few tens of square
degrees suggest a large excess of faint detections
In order to clarify the problem and to complete these
studies by providing the missing link between exten-
sive shallow catalogs f 60m  02 Jy and small very
deep studies f60m  100 mJy we have undertaken
E Bertin M Dennefeld and M Moshir faint IRAS sources
an identication program of IRAS sources at 60 m on
some selected areas in the sky focusing ourselves espe-
cially on the faintest ux domain achievable with the Faint
Source Survey FSS plates f60m  120 mJy with
a signal-to-noise ratio of 4 Our purpose is twofold 1 to
estimate the reliability of the IRAS survey at its very faint
end and 2 to characterize the population of IRAS galax-
ies in the 100 mJy domain where evolution is expected
to begin to show up in models of FIR galaxy counts
At this low SN level the data cannot be interpreted in
a straightforward way completeness reliability and mea-
surement biases must be quantied accurately We rely
here on both Monte-Carlo simulations and optical identi-
cations to estimate these eects
The paper is organized as follows In 2 we describe
the selection of the infrared real sample 3 is devoted
to the description of our Monte-Carlo simulations of IRAS
catalogs These are then used in 4 to interpret statistics
on the infrared data confusion noise number counts In
5 we rely on optical identications to put further con-
straints on the nature of faint sources We summarize our
results in 6 and compare them to those of other studies
In 7 we nally discuss the implications in the framework
of galaxy evolution
2 The data
The data in this study come from the Very Faint Source
Sample VFSS The VFSS was generated by one of us
MM after the completion of the FSS The data in the
FSS were searched for regions where 1 The IR cirrus indi-
cators NOISRAT and NOISCOR Moshir et al 1992 were
small 2 the spacecraft coverage was at least 4 HCONs
and 3 there was a minimum number of nearby galax-
ies These conditions led to a list of FSS plates which
were then processed through the normal processing pipe-
line Their average instrumental noise is 25 mJy instead
of about 40 mJy for more typical FSS plates Since with
these conditions the reliability of the sample had been
veried to be high through spot checks the extraction
thresholds for the normal FSS pipeline which were set
conservatively were reduced from SN of 3 to 25 in or-
der to increase the completeness of the VFSS down to 110
mJy at 60 m and similar increases in completeness in
the other 3 bands The resulting VFSS database covers
400 square degrees in 4 separate contiguous regions Table
1 and contains approximately 2500 sources detected at
60 m The VFSS is about 2 times deeper than the FSC
and contains many unique sources since they can not be
found in any other IRAS catalogue or database1
Although we have only upper limits at 12 25 and
100 m for the great majority of the 60 m detections
1 Although the eld studied by Hacking  Houck 1987 has
one of the highest spacecraft coverages and thus passes condi-
tion 2 it fails to pass condition 1 for cirrus contamination and
was automatically excluded

sq degrees
a few stars lie in the sample We removed them by re-
questing infrared sources to have f25m  f60m
This simple criterion proves to lter eciently most galac-
tic objects but might also discard a few Seyfert galaxies
eg Dennefeld  Veron 1986 However as only 2 of
our detections do not pass the lter criterion all identi-
ed as bright stellar sources in our optical subsample we
consider this eect to be negligible
3 The Monte-Carlo 60 m sample
About 23 of our detections at 60 m have a SN lower
than 5 ie a photometric accuracy worse than 20 At
these levels one expects the data to be seriously aected
by completeness and reliability problems Important pho-
tometric errors if they are not purely fractional do sig-
nicantly bias number counts Eddington 1913 as well
as many other statistics that can be drawn from a ux
limited survey Murdoch et al 1973 have tabulated the
Eddington bias in the typical case of an underlying Eu-
clidean slope and Gaussian ux errors down to a safe
5 level For detections lying below this level the sim-
ple analytical correction used by Oliver et al 1995 from
the Murdoch et al calculations cannot be applied The
only escape is to proceed through Monte-Carlo simula-
tions This can be easily done here as both the instru-
mental and total noise levels are nearly constant over the
surveyed zone We have therefore created mock infrared
images mimicking FSS plates on which was run a source
extraction algorithm similar to the original one used for
the FSC Statistics drawn from the simulation catalogs
could then be directly compared with those from the real
observations with the hope of discriminating against dif-
ferent models of the IRAS galaxy population
The Monte-Carlo approach has some limitations at
these low SN levels mainly because assumptions have
to be made about the noise distribution For this rea-
son we included only two components in the simulations
instrumental noise which we considered to be Gaus-
sian and galaxies Given the very high coverage in our
elds the data conditioning involved in the production of
FSS plates including de-glitching median ltering and
trimmed average should have removed all signicantly
non-Gaussian features from the instrumental noise distri-
bution Filaments from infrared cirrus Low et al 1984
are more of a threat and can easily create false detections
by themselves In what follows we will keep in mind the
E Bertin M Dennefeld and M Moshir faint IRAS sources
possible existence of such noise components But one can
remark that the eect of transient noise sources like cir-
rus peaks and glitches whose distributions are strongly
skewed toward positive values is essentially to lower the
reliability of detections
31 The galaxy population
We modeled the ux distribution of infrared galaxies as-
suming a constant comoving number density and a Saun-
ders et al 1990 Luminosity Function LF

where L60  L at 60 m   109   0724
and L  295 108 h2L These best-t parameters de-
pend slightly on the value of H0 which was conveniently
set to 60 kms1Mpc1 in our simulation close to the
value of 66 kms1Mpc1 adopted by Saunders et al
L60 was normalized so as to t the QDOT galaxy
counts Rowan-Robinson et al 1991 over the domain
1  f60m  2 Jy It therefore assumes that evolu-
tionary eects are negligible at this ux level We adopted
the luminosity-dependent t of Hacking  Houck 1987
to the Soifer et al 1987 Bright Galaxy Sample for the
distribution of spectral indices Pure luminosity evolution
was introduced in some of the realizations by making the
L parameter evolve as 1  zQ This simple form is not
introduced here with strong physical justication but only
to provide a convenient estimator for the evolutionary rate
of the galaxy population in the infrared Luminosity evo-
lution was preferred to density evolution as it is more con-
venient to simulate through Monte-Carlo methods At the
depth reached by our data signicant evolution can only
be probed for FIR-luminous galaxies As for these galaxies
the LF behaves much like a power-law Eq 1 very similar
results are obtained for pure density evolution We gave
to the cool and warm components Saunders et al
1990 the same rate of evolution for simplicity In fact the
warm starburst component proves to be the essential
contributor to the part of the LF where evolution can be
probed here
The spatial distribution of galaxies was simulated us-
ing a three-dimensional log-normal density eld Coles 
Jones 1991 and the Saunders et al 1992 autocorrela-
tion function truncated at 20 Mpc and kept constant in
spatial coordinates The log-normal model gives a honest
t to the count probabilities in the 12 Jy sample Bouchet
et al 1993 and although it may be unable to reproduce
very high density regions of features like sheets and la-
ments it provides an interesting alternative to other sim-
ple toy universe construction methods eg Soneira 
Peebles 1978 Benn  Wall 1995
The overall

150 h1 Mpc wide extending up to z  2 This redshift
simulated galaxy sample was
limit was chosen here for practical purpose It does not
aect by more than a few  counts with f60m 
10 mJy for the highest evolution rates considered in this
paper Although projected clustering was obvious on
simulation images as seen by eye none of the statisti-
cal measurements discussed in this paper proved to be
aected signicantly if we switched to a simple Pois-
sonian distribution Nevertheless all numbers presented
here were derived from simulations with clustering
32 The images
For the sake of simplicity we simulated directly IRAS im-
ages by projecting galaxies over the frame without in-
cluding the complex co-adding of individual scans The
simulated images were given the same pixel size as the
original FSS plates 05 This generously samples the re-
constructed IRAS point spread function thereby re-
moving the need for oversampling when projecting the
infrared sources before convolution At the same stage
we added white noise to account for instrumental noise
Images were convolved by Fast-Fourier Transform with a
3721Gaussian beam a reasonable t to the 60 m
FSS templates at these ecliptic latitudes with the minor
axis average in-scan direction aligned with the y-axis
Finally we suppressed the mean background and low spa-
tial frequencies by applying the standard 60 m zero-sum
median lter of the FSS Moshir et al 1992 along the
y-axis of the image In the FSS this point-source ltering
was normally done on individual IRAS scans which im-
plies some angular dispersion in the nal images at high
ecliptic latitude Anyway our simulated in-scan point-
source proles are in excellent agreement with those from
the original plates
33 Source extraction
The mock catalogue was created from the simulated im-
ages by running a slightly modied version of the SExtrac-
tor Bertin  Arnouts 1996 photometry program tuned
to mimic closely the original FSC Extractor from IPAC
Moshir et al 1992 In particular the standard clipped
rms estimate of background noise in SExtractor was re-
placed by the 68-quantile from the FSC extractor and
the integrated ux of detected sources by the peak pixel
intensity as for the real data
4 Infrared statistics
41 Confusion noise
It is interesting to compare the average 68-quantile mea-
sured on simulations with those from the real ux-maps
Table 2 This parameter is particularly sensitive to the
density of undetected sources in quadrature about 23
of the confusion noise is expected to come from sources
in the 10-100 mJy ux range with the models considered
E Bertin M Dennefeld and M Moshir faint IRAS sources
here The 68-quantile is fairly stable in our simulations
and in the real measurements and enables us to constrain
the number of these faint galaxies Model-dependent con-
clusions about the evolution rate can be drawn from it
there is of course a dependence on model normalisa-
tion itself but number counts of bright sources should
restrict this uncertainty to less than  10 As Table 2
shows the uctuations predicted by a model evolving as
L  1  zQ with Q  4 are too large the uncertainty
quoted here represents the rms of the 68-quantile over
the southern subset area where it reaches its minimum
value The Q  3 and Q  35 models agree well with
the data if there is no other contribution than pure instru-
mental noise aects in our FSS elds Milder-evolution and
no-evolution models may require additional noise cirrus
for example to t the data

Some very faint cirrus can unambiguously be seen
in the unltered 60 m maps which means they may
somehow contribute to the background confusion noise
Gaultier et al 1992 have estimated the confusion noise
at 60 m due to cirrus to be about 7 mJy rms at high
galactic latitude in the FSC This might be taken as a
typical value for our catalog as our elds are located at
only b  35 but are amongst the cleanest of the in-
frared sky concerning cirrus emission and are comparable
to higher galactic latitude zones Because the infrared sur-
face brightness distribution of cirrus has generally much
larger wings than a Gaussian one should expect their con-
tribution to the total 68-quantile to be less than 7 mJy
in quadrature However given the large uncertainties in
the real importance of cirrus emission in our elds we do
not discard the possibility of signicant cirrus contamina-
tion of both background and individual source measure-
In any case this uctuation analysis is consistent with
previous estimates that used the integrated infrared back-
ground Oliver et al 1995 although it is slightly more
stringent for the Q  4 zf  2 model which is only
marginally compatible with our data
42 Number counts
Deriving raw infrared number counts is straightfor-
ward here as we are dealing with a homogeneous set of
data Comparison with our Monte-Carlo samples is shown
in Fig 1 The Eddington bias is clearly visible below
f60m  200 mJy The best t value for Q proves
to depend on the ux range considered For f60m 
150 mJy ie for sources above with SN higher than 5 we
nd Q  32  02 which however raises to Q  36  03 if
we consider only the 015-02 Jy range In the more uncer-
tain 011-015 Jy domain we nd Q  39  02 Account-
ing for a 10 possible error in the model normalisation
yields a  03 additional uncertainty to the values of
Q quoted above These numbers may indicate that the
1  zQ dependence in luminosity is inappropriate for de-
scribing the eect seen here However we shall remember
that as stressed earlier assumptions about the noise dis-
tribution become very critical in the 011-015 Jy bin and
will aect conclusions made with low SN data
This brings the question of whether our elds represent
a fair sample of the Universe ie is there a relative ex-
cess of faint or bright sources due to large scale-structures
which could distort the statistics see eg Lonsdale 
Hacking 1990 Fortunately this point can be addressed
using our bright optical galaxy counts in the same areas
paper I Expressed with the same magnitude scale they
are similar to those done on much larger catalogs APM
COSMOS in the 17  BJ  21 range where most of the
optical counterparts to faint IRAS sources lie A strong
distortion of galaxy counts induced by the presence of
large scale structures is thus excluded
An interesting question is what happens to number
counts if we add some Gaussian noise to the no-evolution
model in order to reach the observed intensity of uc-
tuations The answer is almost nothing as can be seen
in Fig 1 As expected this test indicates that the no-
evolution model could be saved only if the distribution
of hidden noise components is extremely non-Gaussian
creating noise peaks without increasing too much the 68
quantile
5 Optical identications
In order to nd out whether the faint source excess mea-
sured in the previous sections is real or contaminated by
noise peaks some identication work is necessary Sys-
tematic studies conducted at higher IRAS ux limits eg
Wolstencroft et al 1986 1992 Sutherland  Saunders
1992 have shown that the optical domain is well adapted
to this task
51 The data
Thirty percent 6 Schmidt plates of the VFSS were anal-
ysed using photographic data in the blue BJ and red RF
passbands The sensitivity of deep survey plates is well
matched to our IRAS study as the VFSS error box at the
faintest ux levels occupies roughly 1 square-arcminute on
the sky and contains already an average of  03 galax-
ies brighter than BJ  21 Full details about the optical
catalog can be found in Paper I we summarize here its
main features This catalogue is quite small compared to
E Bertin M Dennefeld and M Moshir faint IRAS sources
than it may appear as IRAS and bright optical galaxy
catalogs do have an overlap large enough so that one can
build a local bivariate luminosity function The most com-
prehensive study in that eld was done by Saunders et al
1990 who proposed a Gaussian distribution of the blue
absolute luminosity with standard deviation M  072
and mean
M  1995 log h03cid18log
 1124  log h2cid192
Note that the original expression contains a sign error
M normally refers here to a B0
T magnitude which cor-
responds almost to our BJ magnitude system Paper I
as we drop the average correction for internal extinction
Ai  021 Rowan-Robinson 1987 Although 2 is based
on limited statistics and rather inaccurate optical mag-
nitudes we believe it does provide a globally correct de-
scription of the link between the 60 m and blue luminos-
ity functions because 1 relation 2 correctly reproduces
both the LF IRLB distribution for normal luminosity
sources Rowan-Robinson et al 1987 Bothun et al 1989
and the saturation of optical luminosities observed in
Ultraluminous InfraRed Galaxies ULIRGs Smith et al
1987 Soifer et al 1987 2 integrating over all possible
infrared luminosities leads to a blue luminosity function
in excellent agreement with recent local determinations2
eg Ellis et al 1996 The bivariate luminosity function
based on 1 and 2 is shown in Fig 2 We assume rela-
tion 2 to hold out to z  03 corresponding to the most
distant luminous galaxies we might detect in numbers
both in FIR and in the optical This obviously supposes
a negligible evolution of their dust content over the cor-
responding period of time We shall tackle this point in
522 k-corrections
In order to give the right optical k-corrections to our sim-
ulated IRAS sources one has to make some general as-
sumption about their opticalUV spectral energy distri-
bution SED The large majority of IRAS galaxies con-
tained in FIR ux-limited samples are spirals eg de
Jong et al 1984 with average morphological type Sbc
Bothun et al 1989 Sauvage  Thuan 1994 Although
their rest-frame optical colours span a considerable range
it is dicult to nd an obvious trend with FIR luminos-
ity Leech et al 1988 1989 Hutchings  Ne 1991 An
Sbc SED also proves to reproduce satisfactorily the ob-
served optical continuum of 14-GHz sub-mJy starburst
galaxies with B  22 Benn et al 1993 Given the
tight correlation existing between radio-continuum and
far-infrared galaxy luminosities de Jong et al 1985 Helou
It is interesting to note that this leads to a high normali-
sation of the local blue luminosity function in agreement with
our bright optical counts Paper I
Fig 1 Raw number counts compared with models at 60 m
The PSCQDOT Rowan-Robinson et al 1991 and FSC
Lonsdale et al 1990 counts have been added for comparison
The FSC counts are not corrected for the Eddington bias and
so their two faintest bins are probably overestimated For clar-
ity the Monte-Carlo models were plotted only for uxes below

bars are Poissonian uncertainties Monte-Carlo models become
very noisy brightward of 1 Jy and have not been drawn there
for clarity Note that the bin size is not constant
large galaxy surveys like APM eg Maddox et al 1990
or COSMOS eg Heydon-Dumbleton et al 1989 but is
well calibrated within  01 mag thanks to a high density
of photometric standards The completeness for galaxies
is expected to be better than a conservative 90 at least
for 17  BJ  20 Brighter than this there might be some
loss due to inaccurate star-galaxy separation and under-
estimation of uxes  01 mag because of photographic
saturation eects Positions are accurate within a fraction
of arc-second This is sucient for identifying faint IRAS
sources which have typical positional uncertainties of a
fraction of arcminute
52 The simulated optical sample
As for the infrared statistics presented in the previous sec-
tions extreme caution should be taken in interpreting the
results of optical identications We dont know a priori
what fraction of real IRAS sources can be identied espe-
cially given the large errors in f60m at our ux level
Here again we addressed this question using a Monte-
Carlo method by simulating a sample of identied optical
counterparts to the articial sample described in 3
521 Optical luminosity
We rst assigned some random optical luminosity to each
infrared Monte-Carlo galaxy with theoretical ux re-
ceived on Earth f60m  10 mJy according to a suit-
able optical60 m distribution This is an easier task
E Bertin M Dennefeld and M Moshir faint IRAS sources
The positional uncertainty of an IRAS detection is es-
sentially a function of the local reconstructed IRAS point
spread function and the SN Assuming the error distribu-
tion is roughly Gaussian this denes the traditional error
ellipses around the estimated object position described by
the x y and  respectively the rms error along the ma-
jor axis cross-scan the rms error along the minor axis

we can express the probability for the true optical coun-
terpart to lie between r and r  dr as
prr dr  Q er22 r dr
where Q is the probability for the infrared detection to
exist and to be detectable in the optical catalogue In or-
der to check that this modeling ts the data correctly
we derived maximum-likelihood estimates of x y and
 from optical
identications of the brightest infrared
sources f60 m 02 Jy We were able to recover the
catalogue values within 10-20 Of course this does not
mean that the modeling is adequate There is indeed some
evidence that the wings of the positional error distribution
are larger than Gaussian ones eg Sutherland  Saunders
1992 we will quantify the consequences of this eect in
the next section As shown in Fig 3 the Gaussian model
proves to t correctly the distribution of optically bright
BJ  17 counterparts in our catalogue One can how-
ever already detect a slight excess  5 of the total of
identications at about 3 along the cross-scan direction

several galaxies pass this criterion the barycenter of the group
is taken The model curve assumes Gaussian positional errors
and take into account contamination by chance counterparts

Equation 4 denes the probability density for a gen-
uine identication to lie around the IRAS detection We

The dotted curve represents Eq 2 Dashes indicate lines of

et al 1985 f14GHz  102f60m these sources
are representative of the faintest ones we might detect in
our 60 m sample We have therefore adopted the Sbc
SED from Pence 1976 to compute optical k-corrections
through our BJ and RF passbands and the average Sbc
hBJ  RF i  096 typical rest-frame colour from Paper I
We will nd in 55 other arguments justifying this choice
We nally end up with a large number of articial
sources having in addition to their unbiased f60m
uxes BJ and RF magnitudes that could directly go
through the same complex IR detection and optical iden-
tication processes as real galaxies
53 Identication method
Because of the low resolution of IRAS images  2 at
60 m the reliability of the identication technique is
crucial for nding the right optical counterparts to faint
infrared sources This is even more critical here because
of the particularly low infrared SN and optical faint-
ness for most of the candidates We have adopted the
likelihood-ratio method inherited from radio-source iden-
tication programs de Ruiter et al 1977 Prestage  Pea-
cock 1983 which was successfully applied in previous
IRAS studies Wolstencroft et al 19861992 Sutherland
 Saunders 1992
E Bertin M Dennefeld and M Moshir faint IRAS sources
can compare it to the probability of encountering by
chance an optical object of class c brighter than mag-
nitude m between r and r  dr
pf r m c dr  2X Y Ncm r dr
where Ncm is the projected density of optical objects
with class c brighter than m This leads to the likelihood
ratio denition from Wolstencroft et al 1986
done with dierent densities of contaminating sources For
this reasons we have chosen
L  supLi
though it might certainly be less eective for multiple
sources than eg L  Pi Li In the presence of contam-
ination by chance optical objects the observed proba-
bility for L as dened by 7 to exceed some threshold

Sutherland  Saunders 1992 stressed that L is inde-
pendent of the number of optical candidates lying in the
error ellipse Some extra information can be gained from
the presence or absence of these other candidates if one
assumes that the true optical counterpart to the infrared
source is unique However this hypothesis is dangerous
for IRAS galaxies because of the non-negligible fraction
of multiple systems optically identied eg Gallimore 
Keel 1993 Besides the articial and real optical galaxy
samples do not have the same density of background
galaxies as the rst one comes from an infrared ux-
limited sample any estimator that combines information
from the other optical detections is likely to behave dier-
ently in both cases We therefore conformed to the stan-
dard likelihood ratio L as an individual identication es-
timator for optical candidates
For every IRAS detection lying within the area of our
optical catalog likelihood ratios Li associated to every
potential optical candidate were obtained in the follow-
ing way First we estimated the NcBJ  separately for
stars c  S and galaxies c  G from the number
counts relative to the current plate Then we dened a
circular zone with a 3 radius around each IRAS posi-
tion This corresponds to a large condence interval for r
at least 6 or a diameter 3 times larger than the IRAS
beam FWHM Finally the Li were computed using 6
for all optical detections within the circular zone The
same procedure was applied to the articial optical sam-
ple around detections in the simulated 60 m images but
this time using NGm  dexp 05BJ  150 which pro-
vides a good t to our integrated galaxy number counts
per square degree paper I The sizes of the articial
error ellipses were computed with formulae IIF5 and
IIF6 in Moshir et al 1992 assuming the number of
scans to be hN i  20 and a background noise of 302 mJy
54 Identication rate
What real fraction of infrared sources possess one or more
optical counterparts Using the individual likelihood ra-
tios Li we can dene a global estimator L for each IRAS
detection from which we will derive an identication ra-
tio Here again we need to be able to compare statistics
where prL  L0 and pf L  L0 are the probabilities
to have L  L0 because of real and fortuitous optical
identications respectively Thus
p  pf
1  pf
pf can be measured by putting error ellipses at random
positions in both real and articial catalogs which then
enables us to compare the real identication rates pr
Fig 4 Identication rate corrected for the eects of spurious
identications of IRAS sources with a likelihood threshold of
5 The lines are the Monte-Carlo models as in Fig 1
Figure 4 shows pr as a function of the 60 m ux for
L0  5 which proves to be a good compromise between
completeness and reliability Although they do not enable
us to choose between the models these statistics seem
to indicate that the faintest infrared sources cannot be
attributed to a large number of unexpected noise peaks
Another interesting result is the rather low identication
rate predicted by simulations at high SN about 80
This in good agreement with the observations and the 
90 identication rates reported for the FSC Sutherland
et al 1991 Wolstencroft et al 1992 once the dierences
in the sizes of error ellipses and the addition of chance
identications have been accounted for An examination
E Bertin M Dennefeld and M Moshir faint IRAS sources
of the simulated FSS images reveals that the unidentied
sources are produced by confusion with close neighbours in
projection Because of the large width of the IRAS beam
the barycenter of some detections can be shifted by a few
pixels ie 5 or more at high SN adding a a long tail to
the Gaussian error distribution For these detections the
measured likelihood ratio of the optical counterparts is
thus very close to zero We conclude that this phenomenon
might be responsible of most of the high SN unidentied
point-sources in the FSC Note that cirrus sources do also
constitute potential deection factors
55 Optical colour distribution
The colour distribution for all identications with L  10
roughly a 10 contamination is shown in Fig 5 together
with the average colour tracks produced by the dieren-
tial k-corrections computed with the Pence 1976 SEDs
For clarity only the no-evolution model is plotted The
Q  3 4 models yields tracks very similar to those of the
no-evolution model which is normal as Eq 2 provides
very little evolution in optical luminosity for luminous FIR
sources The dispersion in colours appears to be substan-
tially smaller than for an optically limited sample and as
can be seen the bulk of the IRAS population follows quite
closely the Sbc track supporting our choice in 522 to
adopt an Sbc type for the average optical k-correction

proportion of fortuitous sources to about 10 Solid curves are

described in the text assuming dierent k-corrections From

comparison the dashed line indicates the average colour of our
complete optical galaxy sample as a function of magnitude
56 Magnitude distribution
We now turn to comparing the magnitude distribution
with model predictions Once again we have to subtract
the contribution from fortuitous detections One can de-
compose the total observed number of identications per
magnitude bin at magnitude m nm as
nm  1  pf nrm  1  prnf m  ncm
where nrm is the number of real counterparts and nf m
the number of fortuitous optical galaxies in the same mag-
nitude interval ncm represents the contribution from
IRAS sources for which both real and fortuitous identi-
cations can occur with probability prpf  We dont know
ncm but we can safely bracket it between the two ex-
treme cases
0  ncm  pf nrm  prnf m
The lower bound corresponds to the case where the mag-
nitude bin is totally depleted by the presence of the two
competitors and the higher bound corresponds to the
case where there is no depletion at all The true value is
quite probably intermediate Inserting ncm in 10 we

The magnitude distribution of IRAS sources with L  5
is plotted in Fig 6 together with model predictions for
two 60 m ux domains As expected from the evolution
models excess sources are found on the dim side of the
histogram A very good agreement is found for 3  Q  4
but like the identication rate statistics they do not put
further constraints to the exact amount of evolution
6 Summary and comparison with other works
Although they cannot be considered as really independent
one from each other the results of the four statistical tests
described above background uctuations number counts
identication rate and magnitude distribution do provide
a picture remarkably consistent with the phenomenologi-
cal L  1  zQ evolution model with 3  Q  4 The
most stringent test is given by the number counts with
Q  32  02  03 down to 015 Jy with some indication
of a stronger evolution below 02 Jy However the uc-
tuation analysis indicates that Q cannot increase much
beyond Q  4 below 01 Jy As indicated earlier a pure
density evolution yields a similarly good t to the data
with a comoving density evolving as  1  z60 0507
down to 015 Jy
These values are in good agreement with the value
found on shallower surveys by Saunders et al 1990 who
found Q  31  10  although according to some au-
thors eg Fisher et al 1992 or Oliver et al 1995 this

number might largely be aected by biases  and Oliver
et al 1995 with Q  33  08 However they do a priori
rule out the extreme evolution discovered by Gregorich
et al 1995 in their IRAS number counts In particular
their high density of faint sources is incompatible with
our background uctuation analysis A check done on the
Gregorich et al 1995 elds reveals that they contain cir-
rus which might produce a large fraction of false detec-
tions and should also contribute signicantly to the to-
tal background noise and its associated Eddington bias
Strong cirrus emission also aects the Hacking  Houck
1987 deep eld but the dispersion in their scanning an-
gles smoothes considerably edge-eects on cirrus struc-
tures This might explain why their counts are in better
agreement with ours Our counts and those from previous
studies are summarized in Fig 7
7 Discussion
71 The nature of the faint source excess
Our statistics probes mainly the evolution of infrared lu-
minous galaxies L60  L The good ts given to the
data by the L  1  z32 model and the large excess
of faint optical counterparts indicate that luminous IRAS
galaxies should be  5-7 times more numerous at z  03
than at the present time What are these galaxies Ac-
cording to our Monte-Carlo model the optical counter-
parts with 20  BJ  21 should have an average 60 m
luminosity L60  51011h2L and should be at a red-
shift z  03 in agreement with their rather red colours
BJ  RF  16 if their optical continuum is close to
that of local Sbcs These are therefore potential Ultra-
Luminous InfraRed ULIRGs candidates This picture is
consistent with the redshift distribution of the optically
faint ULIRGs surveyed by Clements et al 1996a Ob-
jects with brighter optical counterparts BJ  20 have
naturally a lower FIR excess but most are still redder
than the average population in the same magnitude do-
main They are very probably similar to the population
of starburst spirals with  M  optical luminosities iden-
E Bertin M Dennefeld and M Moshir faint IRAS sources
tied in the sub-milliJansky radio surveys3 Benn et al
1993 Windhorst et al 1995 although at smaller redshifts
z  01-02 Hence it seems unlikely that a large frac-
tion of the detected excess of faint 60 m sources at the
100 mJy level might be caused by dust-enriched primeval
galaxies as suggested by Franceschini et al 1994
Wang 1991a 1991b proposed a pure FIR-luminosity
evolution scenario based on the evolution of dust content
in normal galaxies Although some variants of this model
might be able to predict a signicant increase of FIR lumi-
nosity in galaxies over the few past Gyr they rely on the
assumption that emitters are optically thin at blueUV
wavelengths This is certainly not the case for most of FIR-
luminous galaxies the sole population of galaxies that can
be detected by IRAS at signicant redshifts As these ob-
jects already have LFIR  LB  adding more dust should
not be very eective in increasing their FIR luminosities
eg Belfort et al 1987 Therefore a moderate change in
the dust content of galaxies since z  03 should not be a
major contributor to the evolution observed yet for IRAS
galaxies
The evolution rate of luminous IRAS galaxies is in re-
markable agreement with those of QSOs eg Boyle et al
1988 or X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei AGN
eg Maccacaro et al 1991 which brings up the link be-
tween AGN and ULIRGs as most of the latter may har-
bour AGNs eg Sanders et al 1988 An important ques-
tion is therefore does the evolution concern the global
FIR-luminous galaxy population or is it limited to mon-
sters containing active nuclei The magnitude distribu-
tion in our faintest 60 m ux bin Fig 6 seems to in-
dicate that most of the sources found in excess are not
ULIRGs and consequently according to local statistics
Leech et al 1989 are less likely to contain an AGN
A stronger argument against a sample dominated by
AGNs may come from spectroscopic identications of sub-
milliJansky radio-sources Benn et al 1993 which as we
saw can be compared to our sample and has proven to
contain a minority of AGN-like spectra Extreme caution
should however be made in interpreting these spectra as
optical signatures of a central engine might be hidden by
the large amounts of dust present in the nuclear regions
of such objects see eg Dennefeld 1996
72 The link with optical evolution
Deep number counts conducted at visible wavelengths
have revealed a large excess of faint galaxies over the no-
evolution predictions from q0  0 cosmological models
Tyson 1988 Colless et al 1990 Lilly et al 1991 Met-
calfe et al 1991 1995 Smail et al 1995 as well as a
blueing of the global population with fainter magnitudes
Incidentally the evolution of sub-mJy radio sources seems
compatible with that of IRAS galaxies Rowan-Robinson et al
The z  1 redshift distributions obtained from spectro-
scopic surveys are however apparently in good agreement
with no-evolution models which suggests a diminution or
a fading with time of low and moderate luminosity mem-
bers of the blue galaxy population4 since z  05 Broad-
hurst et al 1988 Lilly 1993 Ellis et al 1996 Driver et al
1995 Various scenarios to explain this observational phe-
nomenon have been proposed including a delayed forma-
tion epoch of dwarf galaxies Babul  Rees 1992 Babul
 Ferguson 1996 decimation through intense merging
Guiderdoni  Rocca-Volmerange 1991 Broadhurst et al
1992 or more prosaically biases in the determination
of the local luminosity function Davies 1990 McGaugh
1994 Gronwall  Koo 1995
Now strong evolution among the spiral population
apparently seen at FIR and radio wavelengths is a tempt-
ing argument for hypotheses advocating recent evolution
of the optical LF Evolution in FIR is detected in red-
shift surveys of IRAS samples Saunders et al 1990 Oliver
et al 1995 and could be explained for example through
an increasing rate with z of galaxy-galaxy interactions
which are known to be ecient triggers of starburst ac-
tivity eg Larson  Tinsley 1978 or AGNs Sanders
et al 1988 There are indeed both theoretical Toomre
1977 Carlberg 1990 and observational Zepf  Koo 1989
Burkey et al 1994 Carlberg et al 1994 evidences for such
a rapid increase with redshift of the merging rate at least
to z  07 A few attempts have been made to link a
strong starburst-driven evolution of the FIR luminosity
function to that of the optical Lonsdale  Harmon 1991
Lonsdale  Chokshi 1993 Pearson  Rowan-Robinson
1996 They involved simple proportionality between the
optical and FIR evolution either in density or luminos-
ity and therefore predicted a large increase in the comov-
ing space density of optically bright M  M  galaxies
with redshift which is unfortunately not seen at z  05
The same problem arises with stellar population synthesis
models applied to starburst-driven evolution eg Carl-
berg  Charlot 1992
But this apparent contradiction could be alleviated by
remarking that the possibly large increase of blue con-
tinuum emission resulting from starburst activity is often
largely hidden at blueUV wavelengths in FIR luminous
galaxies It is a fact that the complex role of dust and
in particular its geometry with respect to the stars has
been ignored in many models trying to reproduce number
counts with starburst-evolution In massive spirals star-
formation induced by merging is generally concentrated in
the central regions of the galaxy eg Hummel 1981 Con-
don et al 1982 Bushouse 1987 Such a feature is likely
to originate from radial inow of disk gas triggered by
the interaction and is well reproduced in numerical sim-
ulations eg Hernquist 1989 Minhos  Hernquist 1994
4 For simplicity we shall refer to these objects as faint blue
galaxies
E Bertin M Dennefeld and M Moshir faint IRAS sources
The associated circumnuclear starburst which may sur-
round an AGN is usually heavily reddened in the optical
and does not increase so much the total blueUV light
output of the galaxy ULIRGs are rarely ultraluminous
at visible wavelengths as reected by relation 2 On the
contrary starbursts in eld dwarf galaxies dominated by
gas-rich dust-decient late types eg Van den Bergh 
Pierce 1991 Wang  Heckman 1996 typically show up in
optically prominent giant H II regions eg Huchra 1987
and are often found to dominate the total blueUV emis-
sion Hence statistically starbursts observed in both types
of galaxies possess very dierent observable signatures
Therefore the hypothesis that starburst galaxies which
dominate IRAS faint number counts are the same as those
that make the excess seen in the optical at intermediate
redshifts Pearson  Rowan-Robinson 1996 is not con-
vincing
There is nevertheless evidence from optical redshift
surveys that the galaxies with M  M  observed in excess
at z  05 are actively star-forming galaxies Ellis 1996
and references therein Recent studies have estimated
their evolution in terms of global brightening at blue wave-
lengths between now and z  03  5 to  1  15 mag
Driver et al 1996 Rix et al 1996 similar to what we
inferred for IRAS galaxies in FIR Is the evolution of
FIR-luminous galaxies closely related to that of faint blue
galaxies In the hypothesis of a recent evolution dom-
inated by starburst processes in both populations this
question is essentially linked to the existence of a com-
mon triggering mechanism in which case we may consider
IRAS galaxies as massive dusty versions of the faint blue
galaxies Although interactionmerging seems to be the
rule among distant IRAS galaxies at least for the most
luminous members Clements et al 1996b1996c the sit-
uation is much less clear for faint blue galaxies Deep Hub-
ble Space Telescope images present visual evidence for a
high proportion of interactingmerging objects increasing
steeply with magnitude Driver et al 1995 van den Bergh
et al 1996 Nevertheless many of these sources may well
be luminous galaxies at much higher redshifts or in some
cases knots of star-formation observed in single objects
Besides optical observations of nearby dwarf galaxies un-
dergoing starbursts reveal that a large fraction are ap-
parently isolated objects Campos-Aguilar  Moles 1991
Telles  Terlevich 1995 which argues against interac-
tions as a unique triggering mechanism of starburst activ-
ity at recent epochs Still one cannot exclude the hypoth-
esis of interactions or collisions with HI clouds supported
by 21 cm observations of the environment of nearby HII
galaxies Taylor et al 1995
Another test of the interaction scenario might be pro-
vided by studying the spatial or angular two-point cor-
relation function One could expect the distribution of
sources triggered by interactions to exhibit some dier-
ences with respect to the global late-type density eld In
fact both IRAS and blue galaxies happen to have cluster-
ing properties barely distinguishable within measurement
errors from their common parent population of late-type
galaxies eg Infante  Pritchet 1995 Mann et al 1996
Oliver et al 1996 although this may not be true at very
small scales Carlberg et al 1994 Infante et al 1996
We shall therefore conclude this discussion by point-
ing out that a simple and appealing scenario in which
the strong recent evolution among late-type galaxies at
moderate redshifts is related to an increase of the merg-
inginteraction rate with lookback time appears qualita-
tively compatible with the observations In this scenario
FIR-luminous galaxies would then represent the massive
dusty counterparts of faint starbursting blue galaxies
More data are clearly necessary to test this hypothesis on
the observational side under others to follow the evolu-
tion of the intermediate luminosity population in the FIR
This should be possible with the ISO Infrared Space Ob-
servatory satellite It would also allow to assess more ac-
curately the evidence for strong evolution at low redshifts
in the FIR deduced so far only from IRAS measurements
8 Conclusions
We have analysed a deep homogeneous 60 m subsample
of galaxies at the lowest ux limit reached by the IRAS
Faint Source Survey yielding the following results
1 Detection and measurement biases were assessed
through Monte-Carlo simulations which prove to repro-
duce satisfactorily most observed features of detected
IRAS sources at 60 m In particular the rather high pro-
portion of unidentied sources in the FSC  10 can
totally be accounted for by deections caused by neigh-
bouring IR sources
2 Background uctuation analysis and number counts
provide evidence for strong evolution in FIR luminosity
 1  z32 0203 or density  1  z60 0507 in
agreement with previous studies
3 Sources in excess are genuine and are generally as-
sociated with faint relatively red optical counterparts
which we interpret as being M  massive starbursting
galaxies at redshifts  01
4 Photometric properties of distant IRAS galaxies
suggest that the advocated starbursts or AGNs are
considerably hidden by dust at UVvisible wavelengths
which would explain why no large number of related op-
tically luminous objects is showing up in optical surveys
at z  05
5 Faint IRAS galaxies in excess are unlikely to be
the ones making the excess in number counts at blue
wavelengths and z  05 but this does not exclude that
both populations follow the same evolution mechanism
ie interaction-induced starbursts
