ABSTRACT
We explore the rate and impact of galaxy mergers on the massive galaxy population using the amplitude of the
two-point correlation function on small scales for M  5 1010M galaxies from the COSMOS and COMBO
17 surveys Using a pair fraction derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a low-redshift benchmark the
large survey area at intermediate redshifts allows us to determine the evolution of the close pair fraction with
unprecedented accuracy for a mass-selected sample we nd that the fraction of galaxies more massive than
51010M in pairs separated by less than 30 kpc in 3D space evolves as Fz  00130000191z121025
between z  0 and z  12 Assuming a merger time scale of 05 Gyrs the inferred merger rate is such that
galaxies with mass in excess of 1011M have undergone on average 05 07 mergers involving progenitor
galaxies both more massive than 5 1010M since z  06 12 We also study the number density evolution of
massive red sequence galaxies using published luminosity functions and constraints on the MLB evolution from
the fundamental plane Moreover we demonstrate that the measured merger rate of massive galaxies is sufcient
to explain this observed number density evolution in massive red sequence galaxies since z  1

1 INTRODUCTION
in their halos
The distribution of galaxies in a colour-magnitude diagram
shows a bimodality galaxies with red optical colors occupy a
relatively tight sequence in color the red sequence while blue
galaxies show a wider dispersion and populate the so-called
blue cloud Blanton et al 2003 This bimodality has existed
for most of the history of the universe eg Bell et al 2004
Faber et al 2007 Taylor et al 2009 However the stellar mass
density of red sequence galaxies has increased by a factor  2
since z  1 while it has remained approximately constant for
blue galaxies Bell et al 2004 Faber et al 2007 Brown et al
2007 Yet the majority of stars are formed in blue galax-
ies Bell et al 2007 Walcher et al 2008 which implies that
galaxies migrate from the blue cloud to the red sequence see
eg the discussion by Faber et al 2007
While signicant evolution of the integrated mass function of
red galaxies is generally agreed upon the evolution in the num-
ber density of high-mass galaxies has been shown to be consis-
tent with zero eg Cimatti et al 2006 Cool et al 2008 How-
ever given the large uncertainties the constraints are not tight
There is ample room for considerable evolution and such evo-
lution is expected in a CDM hierarchichal cosmology which
predicts signicant growth of galaxies through merging espe-
cially at the high-mass end De Lucia  Blaizot 2007
The most massive non-starforming galaxies are essentially
all spheroidal ie have ellipticities  04 van der Wel et al
2009 indicating that they formed through merging Toomre  Toomre
1972 Schweizer  Seitzer 1992 Kormendy et al 2009 Shape
distributions do not specify when merging happened Some
valuable constraints have been placed by the study of the clus-
tering properties of red galaxies in this mass range by White et al
2007 who found that 13 of massive red satellites disappear
between z09 and z05 by merging with the central galaxies
The goal of this paper is to estimate the impact of galaxy
mergers on the evolution of massive galaxies from z  1 to the
present day and more specically on the massive end of the
red sequence To that end we measure the merger fraction since
z  12 in a large sample of mass-selected galaxies We will
test whether these measurements are consistent with predic-
tions from hierarchichal formation models and providing an
independent estimate of the number density of the most mas-
sive red galaxies with the observed evolution of the bright tail
of the luminosity function of red galaxies
It is observationally challenging to identify galaxy merg-
ers especially at large cosmological distances Mergers are
found either in an early phase of the interaction when the
two galaxies have not yet coalesced and are found in a close
pair Patton et al 2000 Le Fvre et al 2000 Lin et al 2004
2008 Bell et al 2006a Kartaltepe et al 2007 Robaina et al
2009 or in a later phase when they display signatures of
gravitational interaction and are just prior to or after coales-
cence Abraham et al 1996 Conselice et al 2003 Lotz et al
2004 Bell et al 2005 McIntosh et al 2008 Jogee et al 2009
Heiderman et al 2009 Robaina et al 2009 A wide range
of results have been found for the merger fraction evolution
parameterized as 1  zm with m ranging from 0 to 4 eg
Patton et al 2000 Le Fvre et al 2000 Lin et al 2004 Kartaltepe et al
Here we use robust 2point correlation function techniques
on a sample of galaxies with 02  z  12 with stellar masses
in excess of 5  1010M selected from the COSMOS and
COMBO17 surveys to quantify the merger rate of massive
galaxies and its evolution We augment the statistical signi-
cance of our analysis by using an estimate of the pair fraction
found in Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS at z  01 The total
volume probed by this study at intermediate redshifts is at least
Aday R Robaina et al
4 times larger than any previous massselected study on the
evolution of the merger fraction and reduces dramatically the
systematic uncertainties related to cosmic variance by the use of
four independent elds Then we compare the inferred galaxy
merger rate with the observed number density evolution of mas-
sive M  1011M red galaxies from z  1 to the present
day which we obtain by converting Brown et al 2007 LFs to
stellarmass functions We assume H0  70 kms m  03 and
  07
2 SAMPLE AND METHOD
The bulk of our sample is drawn from the 2 sq degree
COSMOS survey Scoville et al 2007 We use photometric
redshifts calculated from 30-band photometry by Ilbert et al
2009 comparison with spectroscopic redshifts shows excel-
lent accuracy We use those redshifts to derive rest-frame quan-
tities and stellar masses by using the observed broad-band pho-
tometry in conjunction with a non-evolving template library de-
rived using Pgase stellar population model see Fioc  Rocca-Volmerange
1999 and a Chabrier 2003 stellar initial mass function IMF
The use of a Kroupa et al 1993 or a Kroupa 2001 IMF
would yield similar stellar masses to within  10 The
reddest templates are produced through single exponentially
declining star formation episodes intermediate templates also
have a low-level constant star formation rate SFR and the
bluer templates have superimposed a recent burst of star forma-
tion A full description of the stellar masses will be provided in
a future paper comparison with Pannella et al 2009 masses
shows agreement at the 01 dex level

 with C - 122 We t the latter ex-
pression to our data to nd the parameters  and r0 and use
them in the real-space 2pcf to nd the fraction of galaxies in
close pairs
As we wish to preserve SN we did not integrate along the
entire los when calculating wrP Instead we allowed galax-
ies to form a pair only if the redshift difference was smaller than
pair  2 z with z being the redshift error of the primary
galaxy As the photo-z errors follow a Gaussian distribution
with width z Wolf et al 2003 2004 a fraction of the pairs
would be missing by simply imposing the los criteria Thus
following Bell et al 2006a the fraction of galaxy pairs is

Then wrP is multiplied by 1 f in order to account for miss-
ing pairs in our case a correction factor of 119
Given the 3D correlation function r the differential prob-
ability of nding a galaxy occupying a volume V at a distance
r of another galaxy is P  n1 rV where n is the number
density of secondary galaxies Then by a simple integration
of this expression we obtain the probability of a galaxy be-
ing within a distance r f of any other galaxy Patton et al 2000

where fpair is the fraction of galaxies in close pairs As galaxy
interactions are completely decoupled from the Hubble ow
we calculate probabilities as a function of the proper physical
separation between the two galaxies Errors in the correlation
function are calculated by means of bootstrap resampling
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This work aims to an understanding of the impact of galaxy
mergers on the evolution of massive galaxies and the evolution
of the red sequence at its massive end To that end we apply the
above method to our sample of galaxies with M  51010M
regardless of their optical colors to nd the fraction of galaxies
in close physical pairs which we will use as a proxy for the
fraction of galaxies undergoing a galaxy interaction Hereafter
all reference to close pairs will refer to galaxy pairs with in-
ferred separations smaller than 30 kpc in 3D space Fig 1 and
Table 1 show the result of our 2pcf analysis
The projected correlation functions in Fig 1 are shown over
the range 10  rpkpc  1000 in physical not comoving
units as is appropriate for a process such as galaxy merging
that has decoupled from the Hubble ow One can see that the
tted power laws are good descriptions of the run of wrp with
radius down to the resolution limit of  15 kpc Below this
radius we extrapolate the power law t We have checked the
accuracy of this extrapolation by comparison with extremely
close pairs resolved by HST in the study of two of the four elds
used in this paper by Robaina et al 2009 An extrapolation of
To combat the sample variance of a single 2 sq degree eld
we augment the COSMOS sample with a sample drawn from
three widely-separated 025 sq degree elds from COMBO-
17 COMBO17 photo-zs colors and stellar masses have been
extensively described in Wolf et al 2003Wolf et al 2004
Borch et al 2006 and Gray et al 2009 Given the different
depths of the two surveys we only include galaxies from the
COMBO-17 catalog at z  08 where it is complete for our
mass limit The nal sample comprises  18000 galaxies with
M  51010M over an area of  275 sq deg in the redshift
range 02  z  12
We use the fraction of galaxies with a companion closer than
30 kpc close pairs as a proxy for the merger fraction as those
systems are very likely to merge in a few hundred Myr1 As
redshift errors translate into line-of-sight los distance un-
certainties of the order of  50 - 100 Mpc we use projected
2-point correlation functions 2pcf to nd the number of pro-
jected close pairs and then deproject into the 3D space
The projected correlation function wrP is the integral along
the line of sight of the real-space correlation function

the plane of sky and  the line-of-sight separation A conve-

our power-law ts to small radius would predict that  40
of all our galaxies in r  30 kpc pairs should have r  15 kpc
separations we nd that  30 of galaxies in close pairs have
r  15 kpc separations using HST data Accounting for the fact
that Robaina et al 2009 required additional interaction signa-
tures such as tidal tails for a pair to be assigned to that cate-
gory2 and that some extremely close pairs will be classied as
already coalesced merger remnants we argue that this level of
agreement is remarkable and we conclude our extrapolation to
radii r  15 kpc is appropriate3
In Table 1 we show the parameters for the 3D correlation
function that we obtain by deprojecting the 2D 2pcf The evo-
lution of the merger fraction is mainly driven by the evolution
in the number density of galaxies above 5 1010M in physi-
cal coordinates together with some evolution in the clustering
length r0
In Fig 2 we show the fraction of massive galaxies found in
pairs with separations r  30 kpc as a function of z To aug-
ment the data at z  01 we calculate the SDSS close pair
fraction using  and r0 given by Li et al 2006 We ad-
just their r0 by  5 an empirical adjustment based on the
COSMOSCOMBO-17 sample to account for different lower
mass limits and binning We also use the number density of
galaxies fullling our mass criteria adopting the g-band se-
lected stellar-mass function in Bell et al 2003 after correcting
for stellar IMF and H0
Fz  f 0 1 zm to the lled points in Fig 2 ie the SDSS
pair fraction the combined COSMOSCOMBO17 pair frac-
tion at 02  z  08 and the COSMOS pair fraction at 08 
z  12 We nd f 0  00130 00019 and m  121 025
These associated uncertainties are at the same level as the sys-
tematic uncertainties in close pair fraction evolution caused by
uncertainty in the overall stellar ML scale and its evolution
since z  1
We perform an error-weighted least-squares t of the form
In our correlation function we do not impose a specic mass
ratio criteria but given the shape of the mass function above
2While most of the projected close pairs at r  15 kpc are likely to be under-
going an interaction the morphological signatures do not need to be necessarily
evident Gas fractions and orbital parameters strongly inuence the strength of
the tidal features Then we would expect to nd a fraction of extremely close
pairs respect to the total number of close pairs with rp  30 kpc slightly below
the expected 40
3Note that we could have seemingly sidestepped this issue by using pairs
with 15  r  30 kpc for the close pair measurement and adjusting the
timescale to reect the amount of time pairs spend separated by 15  rkpc 
30 Nonetheless in this case one would still want to conrm that systems that
reached 15 kpc continue to approach smaller radii amounting to an exercise
equivalent to conrming the power law extrapolation

 5  1010M from our combined COSMOS  COMBO17 sample in dif-
ferent redshift bins The bestt power law is overplotted following the color
code of the different redshift bins The power-law parameters are given in
Table 1 The dot-dashed line represents the bestt power law to the SDSS
sample derived from results by Li et al 2006 The vertical dashed line rep-
resents the separation limit for close pairs of 30 kpc physical The vertical
dotted line represents the average of the redshift bins limit where one can
no longer reliably resolve individual galaxies in a pair from the groundbased
photometry
M  5  1010M we expect most of the mergers to be ma-
jors ie with mass rations between 11 and 14 We measure
the fraction of pairs in projection which fulll such a mass ra-
tio criterion nding a value between 70 and 90 percent in the
different redshift bins
Galaxies from the COSMOS survey represent 70 of our
sample in the bins ranging from z  02 to z  08 however the
addition of COMBO17 galaxies helps to decrease the sam-
ple variance From the work by Moster et al 2010 we esti-
mate that the sample variance is reduced by a factor of  30
by including the three  025 sq deg independent elds from
COMBO17 This effect is clearly seen in Fig 2 Considering
only galaxies from COSMOS there is an abrupt transition be-
tween z  07 and z  09 which is smoothed by the inclusion
of COMBO17 galaxies
In Fig 2 we also show the prediction for the close-pair frac-
tion from the semi-analytic models SAM of Somerville et al

2008 updated as described in Hopkins et al 2009 The
models shown here adopt the best-t cosmological parameters
given in Komatsu et al 2009 We extract the merger rate
of galaxies where both progenitors have stellar masses above
5 1010M normalize by the total number density of galaxies
above this mass and multiply by two to obtain the fraction of
galaxies involved in mergers the quantity that we estimate ob-
servationally per Gyr Then we multiply by the timescale over
which a merger would be observed as a close pair which here
we assume to be   05 Gyr following Patton  Ateld 2008
and Bell et al 2006a in order to convert this merger rate into
the equivalent of the observed fraction With this assumed
timescale the model predictions are in excellent agreement with
our observational results Assuming an uncertainty of  30
in the timescale matching the numbers from Lotz et al 2009
for close galaxy pairs timescales would correspondingly shift
vertically the model line by a similar number Predictions from
other SAMs tend to agree reasonably well with those of the
Somerville et al 2008 models as shown in Fig 11 of Jogee
et al 2009 see also Guo  White 2008 and Hopkins et al
31 Comparison with previous works
Very few studies of close pair fraction evolution use mass-
limited samples Bell et al 2006a used COMBO17 data
075 sq deg the same catalog we use here to complement
our COSMOS catalog to nd a fraction of galaxies in close
major pairs r  30 kpc of 28 for galaxies more mas-
sive than 3  1010M at 04  z  08 in excellent agree-
ment with our result despite the slightly different mass limit
They also performed an autocorrelation of all galaxies with

is shown as empty squares The point by Xu et al 2004 is shown as the
grey diamond McIntosh et al 2008 is shown as the grey star The results of
Bundy et al 2009 have been corrected down by 33 in order to match our
pair denition see text for details
M  25  1010M nding a pair fraction of  5 Adopt-
ing in our analysis instead a mass limit of M  25 1010M
we recover a pair fraction of  5 The main driver of this
higher pair fraction is the fact that  50 of close pairs in a
sample limited to have M  25  1010M have mass ratios
between 14 and 110 ie the major merger fraction is similar
but the close pair fraction is boosted by a considerable contri-
bution from minors
Recently Bundy et al 2009 performed a similar measure-
ment by studying a sample of galaxy pairs from the GOODS
elds total area  01 sq deg In Fig 3 we show their results
for the mass range  3  1010M after converting their frac-
tion of pairs to the fraction of galaxies in pairs Bundy et al
2009 study the fraction of major mergers in galaxies with
M  3 1010M including galaxies 15 mags fainter than that
mass limit while by our denition of a close pair both galax-
ies need to be above our mass limit It is natural that they nd
a higher pair fraction but we quantify this difference by per-
forming a test in which we try to reproduce the Bundy et al
2009 methodology Given the nature of our method it is dif-
cult to perform a cross-correlation in order to match their pair
denition instead we study the 2D distribution of galaxies in
a similar fashion as Bundy et al 2009 That is we look for
galaxies with separations r  30kpc and matched in redshift
space and subtract random counts We perform such a test in
the redshift range 02  z  06 where we are complete for
stellar masses of  1 - 2 1010M with both our pair deni-
tion both galaxies above 5 1010M and also keeping such
a mass limit for the primary but allowing the secondary to be
a factor 4 less massive In the rst case we nd as expected
a result compatible with the one found with the 2pcf and in
the second we nd that the pair fraction is larger by a factor of
 15 Extrapolating this ratio to the higher redshift bins we
accordingly re-scale the Bundy et al 2009 numbers by mul-
tiplying their results by 067 in order to match our pair deni-

tion The difference is reduced to a factor of less than 2 in the
lower redshift bins while our results basically agree at z  1
We also show the estimate from Xu et al 2004 who used a
combined sample from the 2MASS and 2dFGRS surveys af-
ter converting their results to our IMF and H0 and the result
from McIntosh et al 2008 who measured the merger frac-
tion in galaxy groups based in projected pairs with additional
signs of gravitational interaction Before performing the com-
parison we further correct the pair fractions found by Xu et al
2004 and Bundy et al 2009 down by 30 to account for
pairs in their analyses that are genuinely associated with each
other so are not random projections have projected separa-
tions of  30 kpc but are separated by more than 30kpc in real
space ie galaxies in groups that are projected along the line
of sight Bell et al 2006a4
We can not compare our measurements with morphological
studies of merger fractions because of uncertainties with the
nature of the progenitors  differentiation between major and
minor mergers can be extremely challenging especially in the
case in which one of the progenitors is very gas-rich and selec-
tion effects related to orbital parameters galaxy structure and
gas fractions with the latter introducing a bias in the recovery
of interacting systems at higher z Lotz et al 2009 A more
fundamental difference with respect to morphological studies
both those performed with visual classications Jogee et al
2009 and with automated classiers Conselice et al 2009
Lotz et al 2008 is the fact that both merger remnants and
closely interacting pairs can show signatures of gravitational
interactions see Robaina et al 2009 for a discussion on the
relative numbers of merger remnants and close pair interactions
with morphological disturbances These two groups are related
to different time scales and the strength and abundance of tidal
features is also different often degenerate with other parame-
ters such as gas fraction Studies on close pair statistics aim to
detect the galaxy interaction in an early stage where both pro-
genitors can be studied separately while morphological studies
include systems both before and after the coalescence For this
reason a direct quantitative comparison is impossible
also hazardous to compare with close pair measurements based
on luminosity-selected samples Lin et al 2008 used a sam-
ple of galaxies with B-band magnitudes corrected for passive
luminosity evolution - 21  MB  - 19 For red galaxies this
is roughly compatible with our massselected sample but it
includes many low-mass blue galaxies which makes a com-
parison impossible because their clustering properties are very
different As an extreme example in which one close pair is
formed by a very red MB  - 21 galaxy and a very blue one with
MB  - 19 the stellar-mass ratio in this hypothetical interaction
could be as high as 40 This pair denition is clearly not com-
patible with one in which both galaxies are selected by stellar
mass Furthermore as merging can enhance the star forma-
tion activity Barton et al 2000 Robaina et al 2009 selecting
galaxies in rest-frame blue bands is biased in favor of mergers
as such a selection would recover merging systems with lower
mass given the decreased ML ratio induced by the interaction
All of these effects will be more pronounced in gasrich galax-
ies and gas fractions were likely higher in the past leading to
a redshift dependent bias
Kartaltepe et al 2007 derived the evolution of the pair frac-
tion from a luminosity-selected sample from a similar dataset
4This effect is present also in pair fractions determined from spectroscopic
redshifts as long as a deprojection to the 3D space is not performed
as analyzed in this paper Their very different result they nd
m  31 01 is caused at least in part by the difference be-
tween mass and luminosityselected samples as described
above as well as by the fact that they do not correct for pas-
sive luminosity evolution
In addition they identify pairs in
both the ground-based and HSTACS-based catalogues Be-
cause their sample is selected by ground-based luminosity very
close pairs that are only resolved by ACS can be as bright as a
single galaxy in a more widely separated pair that is resolved
in the ground-based imaging This articially raises that close
pair fraction especially at high redshift
Summarizing we choose not to compare with merger frac-
tions obtained by morphological indicators nor with those ob-
tained by close pair counts in luminosity-selected samples
these provide measurements of different merger-related quan-
tities and can not in general be compared to our measurement
32 The impact of galaxy merging on the creation of
M  1011M galaxies
Our measured fraction of M  5  1010M galaxies in
close pairs as a function of redshift constrains the impact that
merging-induced mass assembly has on the creation rate of
M  1011M systems
As only  6 of our galaxies with a projected companion
at r  30 kpc has a second companion at such separation we
assume that the number of close pairs is simply one half of the
number of galaxies in close pairs neglecting the very minor
inuence of such a small number of galaxies in triplets The
fraction of newly created M  1011M galaxies due to merg-
ing is frem  NcpN11 where Ncp is the number of close pairs of
galaxies above 51010M each regardless of their optical col-
ors and N11 is the total number of galaxies with stellar masses
in excess of 1011M
Following Patton  Ateld 2008 or Bell et al 2006a the
merger timescale for galaxy pairs at this separation is approxi-
mately   05 Gyrs so we compute the creation rate of newly
assembled galaxies Rrem as Rrem  frem We integrate the
merger rate over cosmic time nding that on average present
day galaxies with stellar masses larger than 1011M have un-
dergone 05 07 mergers since z  06 12 from interactions
between galaxies more massive than 5 1010M
33 The mergerdriven evolution of the red sequence
In the previous sections we have studied the impact of merg-
ing of the evolution of the mass function of galaxies without
restriction to the optical colors of the progenitors or descen-
dants Now we want to address the question whether our ob-
served merger rate evolution can explain the observed number
density evolution in the massive end M  1011M of the red
sequence
First we convert the evolution of the B-band luminosity
function LF of red galaxies as measured by Brown et al
2007 to the evolution in the number density of galaxies more
massive than 1011M For this conversion we use the typi-
cal stellar mass-to-light ratio of nearby red galaxies MLB 
34 06 eg Bell et al 2003 Kauffmann et al 2003 and ap-

certainties We estimate the nal uncertainty by estimating the
typical dispersion of those 10000 realizations The results from
this exercise are shown in Fig 4 We nd an evolution in the
number density of the massive end of the red sequence of a fac-
tor  4 between z  1 and z  0
Our inference of a factor  4 evolution in the number density
of red sequence galaxies with M  1011M is somewhat larger
than a number of recent estimates The main reason for this is
our adoption of the recent results by van Dokkum  van der Marel
2007 for the evolution of ML determined through FP evo-
lution who nd relatively rapid evolution of ML leading to
more rapid inferred fading of the stellar population than as-
sumed by many previous works For example Cimatti et al
2006 found a result compatible with a constant number den-
sity of M  1011M galaxies in the interval 0  z  08 In
order to obtain that result they applied a passive luminosity
correction of logMLB  046  004 to a sample drawn
from COMBO17 and DEEP2 Davis et al 2003 Faber et al
2007 This luminosity correction was obtained from the works
by van Dokkum  Stanford 2003 and Treu et al 2005 and is
lower than the one found a few years later by van Dokkum  van der Marel
2007 with a larger sample This apparently small differ-
ence in logMLB has strong implications when studying the
number density evolution of massive red galaxies at the level
of  15 - 2 between z  1 and z  0 Also the number of
galaxies in their COMBO17 or DEEP2 samples is relatively
small when compared to the  7 sq deg of the NOAO Deep
WideField Survey NDWFS Jannuzi  Dey 1999 used by
Brown et al 2007 Cool et al 2008 used a sample of lumi-
nous red galaxies LRG from SDSS and spectroscopic follow
up from MMT to address a similar question They found no
evolution in the number density of LRGs since z  09 We be-
lieve that the main driver of the difference between Cool et als
result and ours is again the correction for ML ratio evolution
They used stellar population models from Bruzual  Charlot
2003 and Maraston 2005 which gives slower evolution than
FP zeropoint evolution constraints
In a recent work Matsuoka  Kawara 2010 studied the
number density evolution of massive galaxies since z  1 from
a sample drawn from UKIRT Infrared Digital Sky Survey and
SDSS Instead of applying an average ML correction they cal-
culated stellar masses for individual galaxies at all redshifts
nding a factor  4 evolution at M  1011M when adding-
up their two mass bins Unlike our present work they did
not differenciate between red and blue galaxies but given the
predominance of red galaxies at such high stellar masses they
report a blue fraction  30 at all redshifts in the same mass
range we believe that our factor  4 evolution agrees remark-
ably well with their result
We now address the question of whether galaxy mergers be-
tween massive galaxies can drive the observed number density
evolution of massive red galaxies For that purpose we use the
result for the merger rate found in Section 32 and work un-
der the assumption that mergers between massive galaxies will
produce remnants with red optical colors Dry gasfree merg-
ers are likely to play an important role in the build-up of the
massive end of the red sequence van Dokkum 2005 Bell et al
2006b and the descendant systems of such interactions will
clearly be red systems as well Moreover mergers involving
massive blue disklike galaxies are also expected to produce
red ellipticals as remnants Major interactions independently
of the color of the progenitors are expected to perturb the or-

bits of the stars in the galaxies and form elliptical systems
but the observed fraction of spheroidal galaxies with blue opti-
cal colors is a negligible fraction of the total at masses above
1011M see Schawinski et al 2009 Kannappan et al 2009
Huertas-Company et al 2010 It is likely that even those few
systems will passively evolve to the red sequence in  1 Gyr
so our assumption that merger remnants with masses above
such stellar mass will become red sequence galaxies is justi-
We use the number density of massive systems at z  09
that we have obtained as the starting point and calculate the
growth in the number of massive red galaxies implied by our
measurement of the merger rate We show the result of this ex-
ercise as the solid line in Fig 4 We stress that the observed
evolution lled circles and the one implied by our measure-
ment solid line are completely independent except for the fact
that we use the observed density at z  09 to anchor the evolu-
tion predicted by our close pair fractions We nd that mergers
of massive galaxies can explain the evolution in the observed
number density of massive red galaxies since z  1 In different
words the majority of galaxies observed today at the massive
end of the red sequence have been assembled in the last 8 Gyrs
through mergers of massive galaxies
We have used   05 Gyrs but using the   1 Gyr timescale
from Kitzbichler  White 2007 produces a somewhat slower
evolution that is still compatible within the error bars
There are two caveats we would like to mention Firstly
given the nature of our method some of the progenitor galaxies
have masses above 1011M so strictly speaking they are not
newly formed massive galaxies Second because we adopt a
lower mass limit of 5  1010M we underestimate the num-
ber of major mergers that could lead to the formation of a
massive galaxy For example a pair with individual masses
M  6 1010M and M  4 1010M would not make it into
our pair sample but would produce a major merger remnant of
1011M Assuming that the merging population has a compo-
sition similar to our overall sample we estimate that this latter
The merger-driven evolution of massive galaxies
lower mass limit issue has an impact a factor  2 larger on the
creation of  1011M galaxies than the overestimate caused by
double counting already massive red galaxies ie for every 10
massive galaxies we are counting as produced by mergers there
would be 1-2 which were already above 1011M and  3 that
we are not accounting for because one of the progenitors has a
mass below our mass limit of 5 1010M This means that our
results are uncertain at the level of  20 when counting newly
formed massive red galaxies We do not apply this correction to
our results but would like to stress that if anything we slightly
underestimate the real creation rate of massive galaxies induced
by merging
Hopkins et al 2008 found by using HOD models a merger-
driven evolution of a factor 34 in the integrated stellar mass
density in red elliptical galaxies between z  1 and z  0 Given
that we focus on the massive end of the distribution a quanti-
tative comparison is impossible but we argue that our results
are in qualitative good agreement with the trend seen in that
work and in Hopkins et al 2006 where they found some evo-
lution in M  1011M red galaxies in the same redshift range
by evolving the mass function of red galaxies in a manner com-
patible with the predicted merger rates
White et al 2007 studied the clustering of luminous red
galaxies in the NDWFS in conjunction with HOD models nd-
ing that  13 of red luminous satellites present at z  09 have
dissapeared by z  05 The most likely explanation to this phe-
nomenon is that merging has taken place decreasing the num-
ber of such galaxies in good qualitative agreement with our
result
Also in a recent work van der Wel et al 2009 studied the
shape axis ratio distribution of a large sample of quiescent
galaxies drawn from the SDSS Quiescent galaxies with promi-
nent disks are exceedingly rare at stellar masses above 1011M
providing a strong indication that most if not all massive qui-
escent galaxies form through major mergers Our results are
consistent with this entirely indepent result and moreover sug-
gest that most of this merger activity occurred over the past
 8 Gyrs since z  1
4 CONCLUSIONS
We have studied the impact of galaxy mergers on the evolu-
tion of massive galaxies by using 2point correlation functions
to measure the fraction of galaxies in close pairs from a sam-
ple of  18000 galaxies more massive than 5 1010M drawn
from the COSMOS and COMBO17 surveys and a pair frac-
tion estimate from SDSS We have also used constraints from
the observed evolution of the fundamental plane zeropoint to
calculate the number density evolution of M  1011M red
galaxies from Brown et al 2007 LFs Our main ndings are
1- The fraction of galaxies more massive than 51010M in
close pairs evolves as Fz  00130 00019 1 z121025
in the redshift range 0  z  12 Assuming a merging timescale
of   05 Gyr this implies that galaxies more massive than
1011M have undergone on average 05 07 major merg-
ers since z  06 12 involving progenitors more massive than
5 1010M
2- The number density of M  1011M galaxies on the
red sequence increases by a factor of  4 between z  1 and
z  0 This result depends strongly on the assumed evolu-
tion of the ML ratio which we have assumed here to be
logMLB  0555 0042 between z  1 and z  0 following
recent estimates by van Dokkum  van der Marel 2007
3- The evolution implied by our measured merger rate is
sufcient to explain this observed number density evolution of
massive red galaxies since z  1 major mergers between mas-
sive M  5 1010M galaxies are the main driver of the red
sequence growth at its massive end
