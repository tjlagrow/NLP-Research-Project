ABSTRACT
Context Star forming early-type galaxies with blue optical colours at low redshift can be used to test our current understanding of
galaxy formation and evolution
Aims We want to reveal the fuel and triggering mechanism for star formation in these otherwise passively evolving red and dead
stellar systems
Methods We undertook an optical and ultraviolet study of 55 star forming blue early-type galaxies searching for signatures of recent
interactions that could be driving the molecular gas into the galaxy and potentially triggering the star formation
Results We report here our results on star forming blue early-type galaxies with tidal trails and in close proximity to neighbouring
galaxies that are evidence of ongoing or recent interactions between galaxies There are 12 galaxies with close companions with
similar redshifts among which two galaxies are having ongoing interactions that potentially trigger the star formation Two galaxies
show a jet feature that could be due to the complete tidal disruption of the companion galaxy The interacting galaxies have high star
formation rates and very blue optical colours Galaxies with no companion could have undergone a minor merger in the recent past
Conclusions The recent or ongoing interaction with a gas-rich neigbouring galaxy could be responsible for bringing cold gas to
an otherwise passively evolving early-type galaxy The sudden gas supply could trigger the star formation eventually creating a blue
early-type galaxy The galaxies with ongoing tidal interaction are blue and star forming thereby implying that blue early-type galaxies
can exist even when the companion is on yby so does not end up in a merger
Key words galaxy evolution elliptical and lenticular galaxy interactions galaxy star formation
1 Introduction
Early-type galaxies ETGs are morphologically classied as el-
lipticals or lenticulars based on visual inspection of imaging
data They are observed to be passively evolving stellar sys-
tems that follow a tight red sequence when placed on the galaxy
colour magnitude diagram Faber 1973 Visvanathan  Sandage
1977 Baldry et al 2004 These galaxies are predominant in
dense environments like the centres of galaxy clusters which
are hostile to star formation Dressler et al 1987 This obser-
vational evidence makes them classic example of systems that
formed at very early epochs z  2 followed by passive evolu-
tion Renzini 2006 However there is growing evidence from
deep surveys in recent years that have demonstrated that the
stellar mass in red sequence galaxies has been increasing over
the past eight billion years Bell et al 2004 Faber et al 2007
Brown et al 2007 This could happen because of stellar mass
growth through scenarios such as galaxy mergers tidal interac-
tions and in situ star formation These processes operate in the
eld increasing the stellar mass of ETGs by accreting more stars
and gas thereby triggering star formation throughout an existing

base population of evolved stars Star formation can then elevate
the blue spectral energy distribution of ETGs which will change
their position from the red sequence to the blue cloud on the
galaxy colour-magnitude diagram
Indeed a sample of such ETGs have been observed to be sig-
nicantly bluer than the red sequence galaxies Schawinski et al
2009 hereafter S09 McIntosh et al 2014 S09 have reported
204 blue ETGs at low redshifts 002  z  005 with approx-
imately L luminosities The early-type morphology of these
galaxies has been conrmed based on visual classications from
the galaxy zoo They are observed to have a range of velocity
dispersions   200 kms as found in low density environ-
ments and make up 57  04  of the low-redshift early-type
galaxy population Blue ETGs are absent above u  r colour 
25 mag a region that is populated by red sequence galaxies on
the colour-magnitude diagram S09 S09 have classied the
blue ETGs based on the positions on line diagnostic diagram
Baldwin et al 1981 with 25  as only star forming 25  as
both star forming and AGN 12  as AGN and 38  as having
no strong emission lines to classify The star formation rates of
the 55 star forming blue ETGs are very high 045 to 21 Myr
and the colours are too blue for any such systems found in the
local universe We are interested in revealing the mechanisms
responsible for star formation in the blue ETGs as it helps in our

encompasses the virial radius of a typical L galaxy a criterion
that is crucial for studies of the environments of blue ETGs The
companion galaxies in the  66 eld are checked for their
proximities spectroscopic redshifts and possible interactions
with the blue early-type galaxy Companion galaxies within
the chosen eld that share a minimum redshift increment of
z  0002  v  600 Kms were classied as neighbours
Based on this criterion we found a total of twelve blue ETGs
with neighbouring galaxies and this corresponds to  22 
of the star forming blue ETG sample The g band images of
these galaxies are then analysed for the signs of interactions and
the projected distance between the galaxy and the immediate
neighbour The blue ETGs studied here show signatures of
recent or ongoing interactions Two galaxies are found to have
ongoing tidal
interactions with trails through which stellar
material is connected We could also identify two galaxies
with an extended jet feature Four galaxies are found to have
companions with a disturbed morphology that can occur because
of the tidal interaction with the blue ETG The details of twelve
blue ETGs with neighbouring companions and of two galaxies
having unusual features are given in Table 1 We adopted the
galaxy-naming convention following the S09 objID Figure 2

The ultraviolet UV spectral energy distribution of a star
forming galaxy is dominated by the ux from the young
hot massive stars The near UV images of blue ETGs could
eectively trace the signatures of ongoing star formation We
checked GALEX near-UV 1750-2750  database images of
12 galaxies with neighbours for possible interaction-induced
star formation The GALEX near-UV channel is dominated
by the zodiacal light with typical surface brightness levels of
265 magarcsec2 and the GALEX plate scale 15 pixel is
coarser than that of the SDSS images Martin et al 2005 This
makes the detection of ner details in near-UV very dicult
There are GALEX data for 10 out of the 12 galaxies with neigh-

a cold gas supply either from recent gas- rich merger or tidal

the observed intense burst of star formation We report here

images for our analysis The near ultraviolet galaxy images were
taken from the GALEX Galaxy Evolution Explorer database
Martin et al 2005 We constructed the colour magnitude

using the data generated from a volume-limited catalogue of
SDSS galaxies with photometric errors less than 02 mag The
galaxys absolute magnitudes are based on SDSS petromag and
the colours are derived from SDSS modelMags Figure 1 shows
the colour-magnitude diagram with a blue cloud populated by
late-type galaxies and a red-sequence dominated by ETGs The
55 ETGs studied in this work fall in the blue cloud irrespective
of their early-type morphological classication

The genuine cases of tidal
interactions are seen in Figure

appears to be disrupted in morphology owing to the blue ETG
The companion galaxy is having ongoing star formation as is
evident from the near-UV image Figure 3a Figure 2b shows
Galaxy 180 which hosts a spiral companion with disrupted
morphology The system is interacting and the blue ETG
have a very high star formation rate of 18 Myr The spiral
companion is being stripped of its spiral arms with tidal trails
connecting the galaxies which is the site of ongoing star
formation as seen in the near-UV image Figure 3b Figure 2c
shows Galaxy 190 which is interacting with a blue companion
Figure 2d shows Galaxy 172 with a jet feature that appears
to be a tidally destroyed companion galaxy We note that the
SDSS exposure time 54s is not adequate for bringing out the
ner details which can only be achieved with deep imaging data

diagrams
We plotted 55 blue ETGs in the galaxy optical colour- vs
absolute-magnitude diagram and in the absolute-magnitude
vs specic star formation rate diagrams as shown in Figure 4
The aperture-corrected star formation rate data from S09 is
derived using the H emission line strength measured from the
3 SDSS bre spectrum of the inner 3 Kpc at z  005 of the
galaxy see Section 32 of S09 for details and scaled for the
galaxy-wide star formation The specic star formation rates
were computed using the galaxy stellar mass estimates from
the best-t spectral energy distribution using the exible stellar
population synthesis code Conroy et al 2009 The colours
were derived from SDSS modelMags which measures the ratio
of the global ux distribution of the galaxy observed in two
dierent lter pass bands Star formation aects both the u  r
colour and the absolute magnitude making the galaxies appear
both brighter and bluer on the colour-magnitude diagram The
galaxies on the magnitude star formation rate diagram show a
trend toward brighter galaxies having high star formation rates
It is clear from these diagrams that the interacting galaxies

bours and one galaxy 190 with ongoing interaction has no
GALEX observation The contribution from the zodiacal light
to the noise level of the images was suppressed by employing
statistical smoothing techniques We performed a Gaussian
-smoothing using a kernel of a width of three pixels to enhance
the signatures of star formation along the interacting trails
Figure 3 shows the selected near-UV images of two galaxies
Galaxy 119 and the neighbouring galaxy are found to have
enhanced emission in near-UV when compared to optical data
This could be due to the sudden burst of intense star formation
due to the gravitational interaction between galaxies We could
not detect an interacting trail between the galaxies in the near
UV data However there can be an exchange of molecular gas
fueling star formation between the galaxies which is only
detected from radio or sub-mm observations Galaxy 180 on the
other hand has interaction trails with the companion and the
blobs of enhanced emission are clearly visible in the near-UV
images This could be due to triggered star formation episodes
happening within the interacting trails of the galaxies or we are
witnessing the burst of ongoing star formation in the arms of the
spiral galaxy that is being stripped by the blue ETG

cic star formation rates The star forming blue ETGs are shown in
black twelve galaxies with neighbours with green diamonds interact-
ing galaxies with blue diamonds and the galaxies with jet features with

have high star formation rates and very blue colours This is
a strong indication that interaction between galaxies triggers
the star formation We do caution that it is dicult to make a
general conclusion based on data from two interacting systems
However it is likely that other systems might have undergone
such an interaction in the recent past This is supported by the
distribution of the 12 galaxies with close companions in the
diagrams Galaxies with a jet feature have high star formation
rates though the colours are redder for one galaxy than in the
rest of the sample

It has been known since the seminal work of Dressler 1980 that
galaxies are prone to morphological transformation in a dense
environment This is supported by the observations of the domi-
nance of ellipticals and S0 galaxies in dense galaxy clusters com-
pared to star forming spiral galaxies Galaxies get transformed
from spirals to ellipticals and S0s when they fall into dense envi-
ronments The blue early-type galaxies reported here could un-

ies were analysed to check for an environmental dependence of

searched for the presence of galaxy groups or clusters The

The high star formation rates of blue early-type galaxies need an
abundant supply of the cold molecular hydrogen that fuels them
In the absence of HICO data on these galaxies we checked for
other radio data that can be used as a proxy to trace the molec-
ular hydrogen Data on 16 blue early-type galaxies exist at 14
GHz from the FIRST Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-
cm survey using Very Large Array Becker et al 1995 Radio
sources within a separation of 10 arc sec from the galaxy opti-
cal coordinates are reported with ux density in mJy in the 14
GHz radio continum There are 16 galaxies with 14 GHz con-
tinum ux density above the survey detection threshold of 1 mJy
Figure 6 shows the plot of specic star formation rates against
the detected 14 GHz continum ux It is interesting to note that
the galaxies with neighbours do not have ux detection irre-
spective of the FIRST survey observations The radio data can at
least trace the star formation if not the presence of neutral hy-
drogen for the 16 galaxies shown here Future HI observations
with VLAGMRT should shed more light on the neutral hydro-
gen content and kinematics in blue early-type galaxies

6 Discussion
The existence of morphologically disturbed and peculiar red se-
quence galaxies are studied in detail by Kaviraj et al 2011 and
Kaviraj 2010 using SDSS and HST imaging data respectively
These studies conclude that mergers are responsible for the
morphological disturbance found in their sample of ETGs The
galaxies studied in our work are blue and a few have ongoing
interactions that make it an ideal case of caught in the act
That these galaxies are blue and star forming during the phase
of interaction galaxy 180 and 190 point towards a scenario in
which such galaxies can exist without a merger scenario The
star formation rates of the blue ETGs are very high making
them brighter and bluer in comparison with the red sequence
galaxies The high star formation rates are only possible with an
abundant supply of cold gas Early-type galaxies are generally
gas-poor systems and they cannot support fuel for such high
star formation rates and for the galaxy-scale blue colours found
in blue ETGs Young et al 2011 2014 This prompted us to
speculate that the fuel for star formation could be accreted
from the companion galaxy which could be a possible scenario
at least in the case of galaxies where one can see ongoing
interactions The companion galaxies are signicantly bluer
in comparison with the blue ETGs Details of companion
galaxies are given in Table 2 They could be potentially
gas-rich galaxies and show signatures of active star formation
in terms of H emission line strength in the SDSS spectra
The existence of blue ETGs can be explanied by the frosting
scenario of residual star formation found in local ETGs on the
red sequence in which an early-type galaxy may have triggered
star formation over the old base population Trager et al 2000
Serra  Trager 2007 The initial phase of this scenario will
rapidly move the galaxy from the red sequence to the blue
cloud and will subsequently change the position on the galaxy
colour magnitude diagram These galaxies will have high star
formation rates depending on the availability of cold gas and
will move back to the red sequence within one billion years
once the gas supply or star formation ceases We speculate that
the blue ETGs studied here are at dierent phases of getting
cold gas from the companion and have migrated from the red
sequence to the blue cloud The interacting galaxies could be
in the most ecient case of gas accretion as is evident from
the high star formation rate 18 M yr The wide range of
star formation rates in these galaxies might correspond to the
scenario where we are observing the galaxy at dierent periods
of the star formation activity The virialisation time scale for a
L galaxy could be smaller than the time scale of ongoing star
formation This along with the shallow SDSS imaging explains
the reason for not seeing interaction features in many of the star
forming blue ETGs
The galaxies in the local Universe are observed to have
gas-rich companions with H I content in the range  106 - 108
M Sancisi et al 2008 We consider the case of gas-rich dwarf
galaxy Leo P in the local Universe that have H I content  106
M Giovanelli et al 2013 On interaction with a L ETG
this galaxy could supply fuel for less than million years with
a modest star formation rate of 1 Myr assuming an ecient
case of neutral-to-molecular hydrogen conversion The fuel
will exhaust more rapidly in the case of a star formation rate of
the 18 Myr observed in the extreme case of spiral galaxy tidal
stripping event reported in this paper Galaxy 180 This makes
a cold gas supply and the existence of blue ETGs becomes a
transient phase in the evolution of a normal early-type galaxy
and could explain the statistically low fraction S09 of such
galaxies in the local Universe The extent of the interaction
between the companion and the galaxy can be understood from
deep optical orand radio HI imaging and can be studied for the
stellar and gas exchange between the galaxies The maintenance
of the galaxy early-type morphology in a scenario of cold gas
accretion from a companion followed by galaxy-scale star
formation has to be addressed by detailed simulations The fate
of the interacting companion depends on the mass ratio between
the galaxies and can either be a yby or a majorminor merger
Recent literature points towards minor mergers as responsible
for the increase in stellar mass in ETGs residing in low density
environments Kaviraj 2014 The galaxies without a detected
companion in SDSS images could have gone through a minor
merger phase and can explain the presence of jet features in the

7 Conclusions
We presented here an analysis of optical and near-UV imaging
data of 55 star forming blue ETGs in order to understand
the mechanism responsible for star formation We searched
for signatures of recent interactions potentially triggering the
star formation Star forming blue ETGs show tidal trails and
close proximity to neighbouring galaxies which is evidence
of ongoing or recent interactions between galaxies Out of 55
blue ETGs 12 galaxies have very close blue companions of
similar redshifts Two of these galaxies are ongoing interacting
systems with blue colours and high star formation rates Two
galaxies show a jet feature that could be due to tidal disruption
of the companion galaxy Blue ETGs appear to have high
star formation rates as high as 21 Myr which is only
possible with an abundant cold gas supply from a reservoir
The recent or ongoing interaction with a gas-rich galaxy could
be responsible for bringing molecular gas to an otherwise
passively evolving red ETG The gas supply could trigger the
star formation eventually creating a blue early-type galaxy The
galaxies with ongoing tidal interaction are blue and star forming
which implies that blue early-type galaxies can exist even when
the companion is on yby so does not need to end up in a merger
