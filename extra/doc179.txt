ABSTRACT
We have considered the star formation properties of 1616 isolated galaxies from the
2MASS XSC selected sample 2MIG with the FUV GALEX magnitudes This sample
was then compared with corresponding properties of isolated galaxies from the Local
Orphan Galaxies catalogue LOG and paired galaxies
We found that dierent selection algorithms dene dierent populations of isolated
galaxies The population of the LOG catalogue selected from non-clustered galaxies
in the Local Supercluster volume mostly consists of low-mass spiral and late type
galaxies The SSF R upper limit in isolated and paired galaxies does not exceed the
value of dex-94 This is probably common for galaxies of diering activity and
environment at least at z006 The fractions of quenched galaxies are nearly twice
as high in the paired galaxy sample as in the 2MIG isolated galaxy sample From
the behaviour of SSF R vs M relations we deduced that the characteristic value
inuencing evolutionary processes is the galaxy mass However the environmental
inuence is notable paired massive galaxies with logM 115 have higher SSF R
than isolated galaxies Our results suggest that the environment helps to trigger the
star formation in the highest mass galaxies We found that the fraction of AGN in the
paired sample is only a little higher than in our isolated galaxy sample We assume
that AGN phenomenon is probably dened by secular galaxy evolution
Key words Galaxies general evolution star formation active
1 INTRODUCTION
Recent observational and theoretical results have shown that
a peak of the star formation rate SF R appears between z
2-3 decreasing to the present epoch Bouwens et al 2011
Burgarella et al 2013 Behroozi et al 2013 and references
therein This is likely due to the fact that evolution of bi-
modality in colour distribution is clearly observed showing
that the fraction of red massive ie early type galaxies
with quenched star formation is higher at z 0 than in the
earlier epochs Star formation rate also depends on the envi-
ronmental density assuming that quenching of star forma-
tion is more ecient in high density regions Cucciati et al
2006 Scoville et al 2013 Tal et al 2014
Meanwhile the dominant factor of quenching is dif-
ferent for the high mass central and low mass satel-
lite galaxies According to ndings by Peng et al 2010
2012 the former galaxies preferred the self-regulated mass
quenching while quenching in latter galaxies occurred
mainly due to environmental andor merging inuence see
ccid13 2013 RAS
also Tinker et al 2013 Tal et al 2014 Wetzel et al 2014
However the physical mechanisms of internal mass quench-
ing are still under discussion It would appear that active
galactive nuclei AGN feedback is the dominant regime for
internal mass quenching Occurring in high mass galaxies
it consists in kinematic outows winds from the accretion
disk surrounding the black hole This removes the cold gas
from the galaxies terminating the star formation The the-
oretical underpinnings of the importance of this process are
described by Khalatyan et al 2008 Dubois et al 2013
and others The observational evidence is summarized in
Fabian 2012 see also a statistical study by Lemaux et al
2013 It is also noted that radio feedback observed in radio-
loud AGN plays an important role in the host galaxy star
formation quenching see for example Croton et al 2006
For example Schawinski et al 2014 argues in a that AGN
feedback is a key factor accompanying spiral galaxy merg-
ing for quenched elliptical galaxy formation Apparently this
process could explain a formation of isolatedvoid early type
2 O Melnyk et al
galaxies where an inuence of environment is minimal Cro-
ton  Farrar 2008 It is thought that AGN feedback in-
uence could also be positive triggering star formation on
shorter timescales Zinn et al 2013 Zubovas 2013 In addi-
tion to minor and major mergings the processes of ram pres-
sure stripping harassment and strangulation facilitate envi-
ronmental quenching Relatively slow strangulation where
a galaxy loses its gas due to tidal eects produced by the
gravitational potential of the groupcluster seems to be a
more eective quenching mechanism than others van den
Bosch et al 2008 Taranu et al 2014
An eective method for the study of environmental im-
pact upon galaxy evolution is to compare the properties of
galaxies from dense environments with corresponding prop-
erties of isolated galaxies ie objects that have not been
appreciably aected by an external inuence of their en-
vironments for at least a few Gyr see Verley et al 2007
Karachentseva et al 2010 This has been conrmed by com-
parison between modelling results and observations reveal-
ing that properties of isolated galaxies have been mainly
inuenced by internal processes Hirschmann et al 2013
showed that only 45 of isolated galaxies have experienced
at least one merger event in the past most of the mergers
are minor with mass ratios between 14 and 110 More
results and discussions on the small satellites search and
their inuence on isolated galaxy properties can be found in
works by Verley et al 2007 Karachentseva et al 2011
Argudo-Fernandez et al 2013 and Melnyk et al 2014
We note that the isolated galaxies are objects selected
in projection on the sky or in velocity 3D space with basic
criteria of no signicant companions in a given volume ex-
amples of the dierent approaches can be found in the works
by Karachentseva 1973 Varela et al 2004 Allam et al 2005
Elyiv et al 2009 Karachentseva et al 2010 Karachentseva
et al 2010a Hernandez-Toledo et al 2010 Karachentsev et
al 2011
This is the main dierence between isolated galax-
ies and non-clustered or eld galaxies These are ob-
jects located outside of groups and clusters de Vaucouleurs
1971 Turner  Gott 1977 Makarov  Karachentsev 2011
Karachentsev et al 2012 in addition to void galaxies se-
lected as objects residing in low density regions Rojas et al

The most discussed sample of isolated galaxies is the
Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies Karachentseva 1973 KIG
1 The catalogue includes 1050 galaxies with m cid54 157 and
  3 ie 4 in the CGCG catalogue Zwicky et al
1961-1968 The largest contribution to the analysis of the
KIG properties was done by the AMIGA team with their
most important results in Verley et al 2007 Lisenfeld et
al 2007 2011 Durbala et al 2008 Leon et al 2008
Sabater et al 2008 2012 Fernandez Lorenzo et al 2012
and Argudo-Fernandez et al 2013
In Karachentseva et al 2010 we applied slightly mod-
ied Karachentseva 1973 isolation criteria to the Two
Micron All-Sky Survey Extended Source Catalog 2MASS
1 The catalogue is known as KIG in Russian transcription but
the abbreviation CIG is also widely used
XSC Jarrett et al 2000 to compile the sample of near-
infrared isolated galaxies 2MIG see details in the next
section The properties of galaxies from the 2MIG cata-
logue have been investigated in several works Karachent-
seva et al 2011 estimated the orbital masses and mass-to-
luminosity ratios of isolated galaxies with faint companions
It was shown that these companions have a weak inuence
on the dynamic isolation of the 2MIG galaxies Kudrya et
al 2011 considered the statistical relations between dier-
ent observational characteristics while Kudrya  Karachent-
seva 2012 constructed the Tully-Fisher relations for the
2MIG galaxies Coziol et al 2011 made an extensive anal-
ysis of AGN impact in the 2MIG sample concluding that
this AGN phenomenon is closely connected with the inter-
nal factor of galaxy evolution Pulatova et al 2015 reached
a similar conclusion making a multiwavelength analysis of
36 2MIG galaxies displaying AGN Anderson et al 2013
investigated a large sample of X-ray selected 2MIGs ob-
served with ROSAT reporting an extended emission pres-
ence around a signicant part of the isolated galaxy sample
Melnyk et al 2014 considered the near-infrared and op-
tical colours of the 2MIG galaxies comparing them with
corresponding colours of galaxies located in denser regions
It was found that in general 2MIG galaxies have a bluer
colour than galaxies in pairsgroups except the most com-
pact pairs which are a little bluer than the 2MIGs possibly
due to recent merging events
In this paper we also consider the Local Orphan Galax-
ies catalogue LOG Karachentsev et al 2011 which was
compiled from the eld non-clustered galaxies within the
Local Supercluster volume by applying the isolation crite-
ria used by Karachentseva 1973 Applying the KIG isola-
tion criterion to the ux-limited CGCG galaxy catalogue
Karachentseva 1973 selected 4 isolated galaxies The
use of the slightly modied KIG criterion to the 2MASS XSC
catalogue also ux-limited giving 6 isolated galaxies
Essentially we assume that isolated galaxies exist but are
not numerous When compiling the LOG catalogue volume-
limited we took these percentages into account and xed
the 5 level as typical for isolated galaxies
Karachentsev et al 2013 studied the star formation
properties of the LOG galaxies and found that the specic
star formation rate SSF R  SF RM upper limit does
not exceed the value of logSSF R  -94 yr1 This agrees
with the corresponding upper limits for the galaxies from
the Local Universe located in dierent environments Kara-
chetsev  Kaisina 2013 and for galaxies of dierent activity
types in the Markarian sense Karachentseva et al 2014
The current paper is a continuation of our previous in-
vestigations of basic properties of the 2MIG isolated galaxy
sample focusing upon the SF R properties We aim to de-
velop a better understanding of the level of the star for-
mation in the Local Universe We dene this as SF R and
SSF R vs stellar mass M and other relations for the 2MIGs
and compare them with corresponding relations for the LOG
isolated galaxy population compiled from a dierent pri-
mary sample with dierent selection conditions We also
study the environmental inuence on star formation quench-
ingtriggering comparing the 2MIG properties with those
of galaxies from the widecompact pairs
In Section 2 we present the isolation criteria for the
2MIG and LOG samples selection and describe data used in
ccid13 2013 RAS MNRAS 000 115
the paper In Section 3 we discuss the star formation prop-
erties of the 2MIG and LOG isolated galaxies The results of
a comparison of the basic SF R relations and AGN contam-
ination for isolated and paired galaxies are given in Section
4 In Section 5 we give a summary of our results and the
main conclusions
2 THE DATA
21 The 2MIG catalogue
isolated galaxies
The 2MIG entire sky catalogue of
Karachentseva et al 2010 was selected from 16 million
objects of the 2MASS XSC Jarrett et al 2000 Selection
of objects was performed twice
i automatically according to the original criteria of
isolation by Karachentseva 1973 adapted to the 2MASS
X1iai cid62 s  30
4 cid62 aia1 cid62 14
where subscripts 1 and i refer to the xed galaxy and its
neighbours respectively Essentially a galaxy with a stan-
dard angular diameter a1 is considered to be isolated if its
angular separation X1i from all its neighbours with signi-
cant angular diameters ai inside interval 2 is equal to or
exceeds 30ai
ii visual
inspecting of the images DSS122 and
SDSS3 of all isolated candidates to identify visible neigh-
bours Visual inspection allowed us to physically eliminate
multiple systems with blue neighbours missed in the auto-
matic selection see details in Karachentseva et al 2010 Fi-
nally the 2MIG catalogue consists of 3227 galaxies brighter
than Ks  12 mag and with angular diameters aKs cid62 30cid48cid48
We found approximately 6 of isolated galaxies among the
51572 extended sources of the 2MASS XSC survey
In total 2869 from the 3227 2MIG galaxies have ra-
dial velocities according to the NED4 and HyperLeda5
databases We removed 23 galaxies from the 2MIG list due
to the presence of signicant companions in their neighbour-
hood or otherwise their protometry was contaminated by a
projected star 2MIG90 174 243 3206 586 1137 1172

22 The LOG catalogue
The isolated galaxies for the LOG list were selected from
the primary catalogue of 11000 galaxies within the volume
of the Local Supercluster VLG 3500 kms at the Galac-
tic latitudes b  15 At rst only galaxies from the pri-
mary galaxy catalogue of the virialized groups were selected
For that Makarov  Karachentsev 2011 used a modied
percolation method This takes into account the individual
characteristics of galaxies and the following conditions
where V12 is the velocity dierence between two galax-
ies R12 is the corresponding projected distance G is the
gravitational constant and M12 is the total mass of the pair
Each galaxy mass was calculated using condition MLK 
Mcid12Lcid12 LK is the 2MASS Ks band luminosity while 6
is the empirical coecient The condition 3 means that
a total energy of the physical pair must be negative and
supplemented by condition 4 according to which the pair
of components should remain within the sphere of zero-
velocity
where H0 is the Hubble constant All the pairs satisfy-
ing conditions 3 and 4 with a common main component
were combined into a group Therefore a primary sample of
11000 galaxies was divided into clusterized galaxies ie
54 are located in virialized groups and non-clusterized
galaxies The candidates for isolated galaxies were chosen
4 O Melnyk et al
by application of the clusterization algorithm to all galax-
ies with empirical coecient k   40240 If at this
strong condition a galaxy still remained non-clustered it
was considered as a candidate to the isolated one see more
details in Karachentsev et al 2011 Among 990 isolated
candidates the true isolated galaxies were chosen by ap-
plication of the Karachentseva 1973 selection criteria ie
visual inspection of all targets and their environments As a
result the LOG catalogue consists of 520 isolated galaxies
3 of which were excluded as non-isolated Karachentsev et
al 2013 In this paper we consider 428 LOG galaxies with
F U V measurements see subsection 23
23 The photometry and formulas
The current 2MIG and LOG samples consist of 1616 and 428
galaxies respectively These samples were observed with the
GALEX telescope7 in far ultraviolet F U V  ef f  1539 A
FWHM  269 A wavelength The photometry was taken
from the GALEX pipeline All-Sky catalogue8 while the pho-
tometry for the nearest large diameter galaxies were taken
from Gil de Paz et al 2007 Karachentsev Makarov 
Kaisina 2013 and Karachentsev et al 2013 Since UV
wavelengths are direct tracers of young massive stars and
FUV ux is one the most reliable indicators of the SF R
Lee et al 2009 the global rate of star formation in a
galaxy SF RF U V  was calculated according to Kennicutt et
al 1998 see also Salim et al 2007 Lee at al 2009

where L is expressed in erg s1 Hz1
It is known that mid-infrared IR emission is an indi-
rect tracer of SF R This is due to re-emmission starlight on
small-grain dust for details see review by Calzetti 2012
We took into account the IR impact into SF R using the
WISE9 W4 22 m mid-IR band from the pipeline cata-
logue At rst we calculated SF RIR calibrated by Jarrett et
al 2013

Since the stellar population of galaxies has an average
mass-to-luminosity ratio in the K-band ML1 Bell et al
2003 see also Jarrett et al 2013 the stellar masses of galax-
ies were derived from Ks luminosity A similar approach was
also applied in previous works by Karachentsev Makarov

sev et al 2013 and Karachentseva et al 2014 with which

Galactic extinction for Ks and F U V bands was cal-
culated using EB  V  values according to the Schlegel
et al 1998 maps and the Cardelli et al 1989 extinction
law where Rv31 Internal absorption in galaxies was taken
into account with values of 0085ai and 193ai for Ks and
F U V bands respectively The coecients were taken from
Karachentsev Makarov  Kaisina 2013 and the value of

Hyperleda The WISE W4 band was neither corrected for
neither Galactic nor internal extinctions

pletion time expressed in units of T0 The coecient 185

W1 34 m W2 46 m W3 12 m and W4 22 m
10 In the listed papers the K-band galaxy magnitudes were de-
rived from B-band corresponding magnitudes This was due to
underestimation of Ks magnitudes for very local big size objects
in the 2MASX catalogue However the Ks total magnitude es-
timation gives a slightly larger masses than using B-band We
therefore keep in mind that calculation of the masses using B-
band calibration includes larger masses for the 2MIG galaxies in
01-02dex In other words from Fig 2 it follows that if the stel-
lar masses for the LOG galaxies were calculated from Ks total
their masses would be shifted further to the low end of the mass
function

3 STAR FORMATION PROPERTIES OF
ISOLATED GALAXIES FROM THE 2MIG
AND LOG SAMPLES
31 Types and masses
In this section we describe the basic sample distributions
of the 2MIG galaxies in comparison with the LOG isolated
galaxy catalogue These were selected from totally dierent
galaxy samples applying dierent selection algorithms see
subsections 21 and 22 Fig 1 presents the radial velocity
distribution of the 2MIG sample Note that the LOG sample
is limited by the Local Supercluster LS volume VLG 3500
kms Fig 2 compares the 2MIGs and LOGs morphologi-
cal type and stellar mass distributions on the left and mid-
dle panels respectively and dependence of stellar mass on
galaxy morphological type on the right We also show in
Fig 2 the same dependences for the 2MIG sample in the
same volume as the LOG samples 2MIG LS As can be
seen the galaxies in the LOG catalogue have signicantly
latter morphological types than the 2MIG galaxies They are
up to two-orders of magnitude less massive than the 2MIG
galaxies even within the same morphological type
We see that dierent selection algorithms applied to 2D
and 3D primary samples dene dierent populations of iso-
lated galaxies The population of the LOG galaxies mostly
consists of low mass spiral and late type galaxies which are
preferably located in globally low density regions in par-
ticular in voids Elyiv et al 2013 The population of the
2MIGs in contrast is totally dierent it consists of nor-
mal mass companion-less galaxies of predomintantly early
type spirals These are located in local regions of low den-
sity From Fig 2 follows that galaxies in the volume limited
2MIG LS sample are signicantly massive that the LOG
galaxies Moreover we have only 16 coincident 2MIG LS-
LOG galaxies 6 from the 2MIG LS sample
32 Star formation rates and neutral hydrogen
fraction
Fig 3 left panel shows the fraction of neutral hydrogen as a
function of stellar mass The fraction of neutral hydrogen in-
creases with decreasing galaxy mass The lines represent the
linear regressions for three samples 2MIG LOG and 2MIG
LS We see that all slopes are similar however the relation
for the 2MIG sample is atter because of a smaller fraction
of galaxies with high fraction of neutral hydrogen and high
fraction of galaxies with moderate and higher stellar masses
The slope for the 2MIG LS sample is a somewhat steeper
The E M and L morphological type division has the eect of
separating the total morphological scale into 3 groups early
type galaxies E -2  1 spiral middle types M 25 and
late types L 610 In total 20 47 and 66 of our E
M and L galaxies respectively are detected in HI meaning
that these galaxies are still have signicant gas reservoirs
Note that only 663 2MIG galaxies and 389 LOG galaxies in
Figure 5 Distribution of SF RIR and SF RF U V ratios for
quenched Q and non-quenched nQ 2MIG galaxies N341 and
N1275 respectively HI detected galaxies of all morphological
types are also shown N663
the Hyperleda have HI measurements 41 and 91 from
the total numbers respectively
On the right panel of Fig 3 we plotted the star for-
mation rate FUV as a function of hydrogen mass for the
2MIG galaxies The line represents the well-known Schmidt-
Kennicutt law with slope 32 Kennicutt 1998 We see
that galaxies of all types are located very symmetrically
however the scatter for early type galaxies are larger The ex-
istence of early type galaxies with high SF RF U V and small
hydrogen mass may tell us that their UV light may originate
not only from the young stars
Fig 4 presents the star formation rate SF RF U V as a
function of stellar mass for the 2MIG LS and LOG samples

morphological type division middle panel The right panel
the same excepting that total star formation rate SF Rtot
calculated by formula 7 This was done using a linear com-
bination of SF RF U V and SF RIR From the comparison
of the LOG and 2MIG LS samples we conclude that the
LOG population completes logSF RF U V vs logM main
sequence to the low mass end In each gure we clearly
see the separation between two concentrations the main se-
quence and so called quenched or red and dead galax-
ies We will refer to these concentrations as to non-quenched
nQ and quenched Q galaxies in order to have a non-visual
classication The border between these two regions may be
roughly dened as F U V  K AB66 and is marked by
the red line in Figs 4 and 8 The nQ concentration consists
of mainly M and L galaxies 85 however the Q concen-
tration is formed predominantly by E galaxies 82 ac-
cording to our visually dened types In total 95 of our
ML galaxies are located on the main sequence and corre-
spondingly only 5 of them are quenched Meanwhile 60
of E type galaxies are located in the Q region while the rest
40 are main sequence ie still show signs of star forma-
tion This is conrmed by the fact that at least 33 of E
type galaxies in nQ region are detected in HI 49 of all
nQ galaxies have HI detections while only 10 of E type
galaxies in the Q region still have neutral hydrogen 11 of

all Q galaxies have HI detections According to Schawinski
et al 2014 this evidences the fact that star formation of
elliptical galaxies was quenched rapidly by rapid removal of
the gas contrary to spirallate type galaxies In this case
star formation halted far slower due to gradual gas loses
driven by secular andor environmental processes
33 SF RIR vs SF RF U V
Table 1 represents
the mean and median values of
logSF RF U V  logSSF RF U V  logSF Rtot and logSSF Rtot for
the full 2MIG sample and its varying sub-samples It fol-
lows from Table 1 that the ratio between SF Rtot calcu-
lated from SF RIR and SF RF U V using 7 and SF RF U V
is somewhat dierent for E M L Q and nQ types 34
19 13 43 and 18 times respectively The distributions of
ratio SF RIRSF RF U V for Q nQ and HI-detected galaxies
are shown in Fig 5 Apparently our Q ie also E galax-
ies have higher ratios of SF RIRSF RF U V than the other
types Normally the ellipticals do not contain much dust ex-
cept for giant elliptical galaxies as a result of mergers How-
ever the mid-IR emission in early type galaxies can contain
a large contribution an order of magnitude stronger from
intermediate-age and older stellar populations than from the
young stars see references in Salim et al 2012 Calzetti
et al 2012 and Jarrett et al 2013 In Table 2 we show
some characteristics of galaxies from the 2MIG sample with
ccid13 2013 RAS MNRAS 000 115
the highest ratios of SF RIRSF RF U V 50 We see that
only a few galaxies have SDSS spectra However 2MIG417
and 2MIG1573 have AGN according to the NED Moreover
these galaxies have high W1-W2 WISE IR colours that
allow them to be considered as having bright IR AGN see
subsection 42 for the details 2MIG1155 is a very local
galaxy with an enormously high SF RIRSF RF U V 2689
ratio The WISE W4 magnitude 0482 agrees with Her-
shel 24 m MIPs measurement 52 Jy Bendo Galliano 
Madden 2012 The galaxy also contains a small fraction
of neutral hydrogen We assume that 2MIG1155 could be
a starburst due to the value of SSF Rtot-958 yr1 and
by taking into account its location on colour-colour plot in
Fig12 starburst region Jarrett et al 2011 In general all
galaxies listed in Table 2 are located in or near that region
see for example the localization of 2MIG1840 and 2MIG842
in Fig 12 second and third galaxy with the highest levels
of SF RIRSF RF U V 
We also note that 2MIG2024 is probably a starforming
galaxy in outgoing merging with a moderate SSF Rtot-
1019 yr1 This is also conrmed by its SDSS spectrum
2MIG1142 2MIG1443 2MIG1840 and 2MIG1987 have signs
of disturbance andor visible small satellites These could
have weak inuence on main galaxy properties Karachent-

logSSF R for 2MIG galaxies is near dex-94 -yr1 This
agrees with results obtained by Karachentsev  Kaisina

P 0 and F 0 is able to reproduce its stellar mass during the
Hubble time at the currently observed star formation rate
It follows that the reserves of gas are sucient to support
the observed SF R during a second Hubble time It follows
from the left panel of Fig 7 see also Karachentsev et al
2013 that only half of the LOGs gas reserves are dissipated
In general the value of the P parameter for the 2MIG LS
galaxies is lower than one for the LOGs As a result the
average current star formation rate is able to reproduce only
a part 12 of their stellar mass over a time T0 Thus in
past epochs the star formation rate of the 2MIG galaxies was
somewhat higher In particular L-type galaxies have almost
the same amount of gas as LOGs during present epochs
However the gas fraction in M and E type galaxies is much
smaller and will be consumed over less time than T0

would like to dene the environmental inuence if any ex-
ists on the SF R properties of galaxies located in denser
environments contrasted with isolated ones Here we briey
describe the selection procedure applied for the galaxy pairs
searching
Initially we extracted from the 2MASS XSC catalogue
galaxies with Ks 12 and aK cid62 30cid48cid48 according to the
2MIG selection criteria obtaining the same primary volume-
limited sample Then we found the closest neighbour for ev-
ery galaxy from the sample according to the angular separa-
tion between galaxies We took only 2200 of the most tightly
spaced pairs and correlated the positions of their galaxies
with objects from the NED and Hyperleda databases Fi-
nally we rejected from the consideration 1 all pairs without
radial velocities for at least one pair member 2 pairs with
velocity dierences of dV 1000 kms We then took into ac-
count only pair members having F U V magnitude Our nal
sample contained 1482 paired members We considered pairs
with dV 1000 kms and linear projected distance R 240
kpc the full sample Pairs the most compact pairs CP
having dV 150 kms and R 50 kpc median values are
dV  534832 kms and R  291010 kpc while the wider pairs
WP with dV 150 kms or R 50 kpc median values
are dV  15615180 kms and R  848053 kpc Here it is
noted that we did not apply any isolation criteria for se-
lected pairs our formal criterion suggests that members
of pairs are closer to each other than to any other galaxy
We consider paired galaxies located in high density regions
in comparison with 2MIG galaxies However a visual inspec-
tion revealed that the closest neighbours to the CP WP
members are located no closer than in 42R Note that
we did not take into account blue smaller galaxies with
aK  30cid48cid48 which are located near selected galaxies approx-
imately in 16 cases In Melnyk et al 2014 it was shown
that the colour properties of WP12 members are close to
galaxies located in groups contrary to CP pairs the colours

comparison
In general the sample of paired galaxies contains far more
E type galaxies than the 2MIG sample 56 vs 31 see
also discussion in Melnyk et al 2014 We therefore observe
a kind of morphology-density relation Dressler 1980 with
the result that in higher populated regions the fraction of
early-type galaxies is higher A similar relation was previ-
ously noted by Karachentsev 1987 for paired vs isolated
galaxies and Vavilova et al 2009 for galaxies in triplets
in comparison with isolated ones Therefore we see that the
most eective quenching occured in high density regions
This was also noted in many other previous works see for
example Cucciati et al 2006 Scoville et al 2013 Tal et
al 2014
Fig 8 left panel presents the F U V  K AB colour
distribution for the 2MIG and paired galaxies while the
right panel represents the coincidence between colour
types and visually dened types The red line FUV-
K AB66 denes a chosen border between so called
quenched Q and non-quenched nQ galaxies see also Fig
4 A detailed comparison between visual morphology and
QnQ types are given in subsection 32
From the comparison of mean star formation character-
istics of the 2MIG and paired galaxies Tables 1 and 4 re-
spectively we can conclude that paired galaxies have lower
values of SF R and SSF R for all sub-samples excluding L
types where the star formation rates of paired galaxies are
clearly higher However in spite of similar selection crite-
ria described in the previous subsection paired galaxies ap-
pear to be slightly more massive than isolated galaxies this
was reported also in Melnyk et al 2014 For example the
mean logMSD for L-type galaxies of Pairs and 2MIGs are
1059053 and 1027069 respectively Therefore in or-

ues in the narrow ranges of stellar masses 9logM 10

Fig 9 presents the relation between the star formation
rates of logSF RF U V on the left logSF Rtot on the right and
the stellar mass with the mean values with standard 1 devi-
ations For the main sequence galaxies we see the dierence
in slopes  for the 2MIG and paired galaxies the gradient
for the former sample is smaller than the latter For compar-
ison the ts for the Millenium simulations 0z03 and
SDSS data from Elbaz et al 2007 have slopes of 082
and 077 respectively while the Boissier et al 2010 model
for z0 ts with slope 065 Herewith the low mass nQ
isolated galaxies have higher level of SF R than paired galax-
ies while massive paired galaxies have somewhat higher SF R
than isolated galaxies In Fig 10 we show the same values
as in Fig 9 for the 2MIGs but we split the sample of paired
galaxies into the wide and compact pair members WP and
CP We see that the values of logSF RF U V and logSF Rtot
for nQ galaxies are usually higher for the CP members than
for galaxies in the WP sample This reveals a possible trig-
gering eect due to interaction in the closer pairs
Table 5 shows the signicance of the dierence in the
low and high mass ends for the nQ galaxies where visual
dierences in the Figs 910 are prominent The Students t-
test probabilities in the columns mean that the sub-samples
of the 2MIGs and PairsWPCP drawn from the same par-
ent sample and having the same mean values The Students

in 115logM 12 mass range are more convincing than at

lar mass comparing Q and nQ types of the 2MIG WP and

can be seen that the level of SSF R in nQ isolated galaxies
is somewhat higher than in paired galaxies supporting the
previous results that galaxies located in low density regions
have a higher level of specic star formation rate than those
from denser regions Rojas et al 2004 Patiri et al 2006
Elyiv et al 2013 A dierence between SSF R of galaxies
in cluster and eld were found also by Haines et al 2013
for higher redshift galaxies 015 z 02 The authors
found that the starforming cluster galaxies have systemati-
cally 30 lower SSF R than eld galaxies at all mass ranges
However this dierence is negligible between galaxies in the
cluster outskirts and in the eld Our results are in nom-
inal agreement with Hainess results in the low mass end
ccid13 2013 RAS MNRAS 000 115
However our ndings suggest that the most massive paired
galaxies 115logM 12 have a higher SSF R triggering
star formation Note that our pairs may be located as in clus-
ters as in the eld The level of SSF R for quenched galaxies
is the same for the isolated and paired objects showing that
there is no environmental inuence for these almost empty
gas galaxies

al 2007 Only two galaxies in our pairs have logSSF R a
little higher than -94
Therefore we suggest that on the lower mass end galax-
ies from denser environments have an older stellar popula-
tion which we can interpret as a sign of an environmental
quenching However at higher masses the positive inuence
of the environment which triggers starformation becomes
remarkable It follows from our ndings that the main fac-
tor of evolutionary processes is mainly dened by the mass-
factor though the environmental inuence is notable It is
possible that we are unable to dene the dierence with bet-
ter signicance due to the smaller environmental eect in
comparison with mass-inuence In general we are in agree-
ment with the results obtained in previous works by other
authors see for example Peng et al 2010 2012 and Tal et
al 2014

94 -yr1 also noted in subsection 34 of this paper In
the previous section we found some shortageexcess of SF R
and also SSF R according to environmental events for low
masshigh mass galaxies Here we would like to examine
how it is related to the AGN activity For this we check and
compare the AGN presence in isolated and paired galaxies
Since we have the WISE magnitudes for almost all of
our galaxies we dene the AGN fraction according to W2-
W1 vs W3-W2 colour diagrams which is eective in selec-
tion of bright IR AGN see for example Jarrett et al 2011
the majority of these sources should be also bright in X-
rays Mateos et al 2012 Fig 12 presents the WISE colour-
colour plots for galaxies from the 2MIG left panel and
WPCP samples right panel Since near 12 of our sample
are also SDSS targets we marked with dierent colour sym-
bols SDSS-selected AGN type 1 and 2 on the left panel of
Fig 12 The AGN classication was carried out by Coziol et
al 2011 Pulatova et al 2015 and a few additional AGN
sources were found in the NED Of course this spectroscopic
classication is not homogeneous rather only indicative We
marked with black dots any galaxies which do not contain
AGN or where we have no information about AGN presence
In Fig 12 we also marked with lines dierent criteria for the
selection of the brightest IR AGN from Mateos et al 2012
Stern et al 2012 and Hwang et al 2012
In Fig 13 we show the fractions of AGN according to
the weakest criterion by Hwang et al 2012 W1-W2044
for the 2MIG and full paired sample in dierent mass in-
tervals on the left and also separately for Q and nQ sub-
samples on the right These uncertainties correspond to
95 condence level 2 calculated with the Binomial test
We see that the fraction of AGN in paired samples is almost
always higher than in an isolated galaxy sample However
the advantage is not crucial to conclude that the AGN phe-
nomenon is necessarily connected with environmental den-
sity We also did not nd any increase in AGN fraction in
most tight pairs as shown by Ellison et al 2011 though we
do not have a large statistical sample on pairs with R20
Here we are in agreement with ndings by Coziol et al
2011 Sabater et al 2012 Hernandez-Ibarra et al 2013
and Pulatova et al 2015 who studied the nuclear activity
in a few samples of isolated galaxies and showed that sec-
ular evolution is a main mechanism for AGN triggering at
least in the Local Universe Here we have to make a reserva-
tion that in our sample of the local galaxies we do not have
bright X-ray AGN which evolution may be explained by the
merging events see for example Santini et al 2012

5 CONCLUSIONS
In the paper we have considered the star formation prop-
erties of 1616 isolated galaxies from the 2MIG catalogue
Karachentseva et al 2010 with FUV magnitudes The
star formation rates SF R and specic star formation rates
SSF R of 2MIG galaxies were compared with correspond-
ing properties of isolated galaxies from the LOG catalogue
Karachentsev et al 2011 and with paired galaxies WP 
wide pairs and CP  the most compact pairs with velocity
dierence less than 150 kms and a projected distance less
than 50 kpc We summarize our main ndings below
1 Dierent selection algorithms applied to dierent
primordial samples dene dierent populations of isolated
galaxies The population of the LOG catalogue selected
from the Local Supercluster non-clustered galaxies mostly
consists of spiral and late type galaxies These are up to
ccid13 2013 RAS MNRAS 000 115
two orders of magnitude less massive than the 2MIG galax-
ies of corresponding morphology The 2MIG population in
ontrast was selected from the 2MASX Jarrett et al 2000
within quite bright near-infrared galaxies Ks 12 mag and
angular diameters aKs cid62 30cid48cid48 consisting of normal mass
galaxies predominantly of early spirals Late type galaxies
of both samples have almost the same amount of gas at
present epochs though the gas fraction in spiral and early
type galaxies of the 2MIG sample is much smaller and will
be consumed over less time than T0 In general the SF R vs
M and SSF R vs M relations of the LOG sample complete
2MIG corresponding relation to lower masses
2 The SSF R upper limit in all considered galaxy sam-
ples ie isolated and paired of the Local Universe at least
at z006 does not exceed the value of dex-94 This
is probably common for galaxies of diering activity located
14 O Melnyk et al
in dierent types of environments Karachentsev et al 2013
Karachentsev and Kaisina 2013 Karachentseva et al 2014
3 The fractions of quenched Q with FUV-K AB 
66 galaxies of 105logM 115 masses are nearly twice
as high in the paired galaxy sample than among the 2MIG
isolated galaxies This suggests that quenching proved more
eective in higher density regions in the past Cucciati et
al 2006 Scoville et al 2013 Tal et al 2014 From the be-
haviour of SF R vs M relations we concluded that the main
factor of evolutionary processes is dened by the galaxy
mass However the environmental inuence is notable the
2MIGs and pairs main sequence non-Quenched with FUV-
K AB  66 galaxies have dierent gradients the rela-
tion for the former sample is smaller than the latter ie the
paired galaxies have somewhat lower SF R and SSF R at low
masses and higher SF R and SSF R for the massive galaxies
with logM 115 The Students t-test showed that the dif-
ference is signicant only for the high-mass end Therefore
we suggest that the environment triggers star formation in
the highest mass galaxies Moreover the values of SF R and
SSF R are higher in general for galaxies in the most closely
spaced pairs suggesting the outgoing interactions
4 The existence of a signicant fraction of quenched
isolated galaxies 21 reveals that the main quenching
mechanism probably does not depend on the environmen-
tal density The similarity of the mean values of the SF R
and gradients in SF R vs M also in SSF R vs M rela-
tions for quenched 2MIG and paired galaxies also support
the assumption that the dominant quenching mechanism is
similar for galaxies located in all type of environments and
depend mainly upon the galaxy mass possibly the main
driving mechanism is AGN feedback Croton  Farrar 2008
see also discussion in Peng et al 2010 and Schawinski et al
5 We found that the fraction of AGN in paired samples
is a little higher but not signicantly in the statistical sense
than in our isolated galaxy sample We suggest that AGN
phenomenon is not necessarily connected with environmen-
tal density and most probably dened by secular galaxy
evolution conrming the previous results by Coziol et al
