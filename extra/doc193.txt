Abstract
Galaxies are not uniformly distributed in space On large scales the Universe
displays coherent structure with galaxies residing in groups and clusters on
scales of 1-3 h1 Mpc which lie at the intersections of long laments of galax-
ies that are 10 h1 Mpc in length Vast regions of relatively empty space
known as voids contain very few galaxies and span the volume in between these
structures This observed large scale structure depends both on cosmological
parameters and on the formation and evolution of galaxies Using the two-point
correlation function one can trace the dependence of large scale structure on
galaxy properties such as luminosity color stellar mass and track its evolution
with redshift Comparison of the observed galaxy clustering signatures with
dark matter simulations allows one to model and understand the clustering of
galaxies and their formation and evolution within their parent dark matter ha-
los Clustering measurements can determine the parent dark matter halo mass
of a given galaxy population connect observed galaxy populations at dierent
epochs and constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy evolution models
This chapter describes the methods used to measure the two-point correlation
function in both redshift and real space presents the current results of how
the clustering amplitude depends on various galaxy properties and discusses
quantitative measurements of the structures of voids and laments The inter-
pretation of these results with current theoretical models is also presented
1 Historical Background
Large scale structure is dened as the structure or inhomogeneity of the Uni-
verse on scales larger than that of a galaxy The idea of whether galaxies are
distributed uniformly in space can be traced to Edwin Hubble who used his
catalog of 400 extragalactic nebulae to test the homogeneity of the Universe
Hubble 1926 nding it to be generally uniform on large scales In 1932 the
larger Shapley-Ames catalog of bright galaxies was published Shapley  Ames
1932 in which the authors note the general unevenness in distribution of
the galaxies projected onto the plane of the sky and the roughly factor of two
dierence in the numbers of galaxies in the northern and southern galactic
hemispheres Using this larger statistical sample Hubble 1934 noted that on
angular scales less than 10 there is an excess in the number counts of galax-
ies above what would be expected for a random Poisson distribution though
the sample follows a Gaussian distribution on larger scales Hence while the
Universe appears to be homogeneous on the largest scales on smaller scales it
is clearly clumpy
Measurements of large scale structure took a major leap forward with the
Lick galaxy catalog produced by Shane  Wirtanen 1967 which contained
information on roughly a million galaxies obtained using photographic plates at
the 05m refractor at Lick Observatory Seldner et al 1977 published maps of
the counts of galaxies in angular cells across the sky see Fig 1 which showed
in much greater detail that the projected distribution of galaxies on the plane
of the sky is not uniform The maps display a rich structure with a foam-like
pattern containing possible walls or laments with long strands of galaxies
clusters and large empty regions The statistical spatial distribution of galaxies
from this catalog and that of Zwicky et al 1968 was analyzed by Jim Peebles
and collaborators in a series of papers eg Peebles 1975 that showed that
the angular two-point correlation function dened below roughly follows a
power law distribution over angular scales of 01 5 In these papers it was
discovered that the clustering amplitude is lower for fainter galaxy populations
which likely arises from larger projection eects along the line of sight As faint
galaxies typically lie at larger distances the projected clustering integrates over
a wider volume of space and therefore dilutes the eect
These results in part spurred the rst large scale redshift surveys which
obtained optical spectra of individual galaxies in order to measure the red-
shifts and spatial distributions of large galaxy samples Pioneering work by
Gregory  Thompson 1978 mapped the three-dimensional spatial distribu-
tion of 238 galaxies around and towards the ComaAbell 1367 supercluster In
addition to surveying the galaxies in the supercluster they found that in the
foreground at lower redshift there were large regions  20 h1 Mpc shown well
in their Figure 2a with no galaxies which they termed voids Joeveer et al
1978 used redshift information from Sandage  Tammann 1975 to map the
three-dimensional distribution of galaxies on large scales in the southern galac-
tic hemisphere They mapped four separate volumes that included clusters as
well as eld galaxies and showed that across large volumes galaxies are clearly
clustered in three dimensions and often form chains of clusters now recognized
as laments
Two additional redshifts surveys were the KOS survey Kirshner Oemler
Schechter Kirshner et al 1978 and the original CfA survey Center for As-
trophysics Davis et al 1982 The KOS survey measured redshifts for 164
galaxies brighter than magnitude 15 in eight separate elds on the sky cover-
ing a total of 15 deg2 Part of the motivation for the survey was to study the
Figure 1 Angular distribution of counts of galaxies brighter than B  19 on
the plane of the sky reconstructed from the Lick galaxy catalog from Seldner
et al 1997 This image shows the number of galaxies observed in 10  10
cells across the northern galactic hemisphere where brighter cells contain more
galaxies The northern galactic pole is at the center with the galactic equator at
the edge The distribution of galaxies is clearly not uniform clumps of galaxies
are seen in white with very few galaxies observed in the dark regions between

three dimensional spatial distribution of galaxies about which the authors note
that although not entirely unexpected it is striking how strongly clustered
our galaxies are in velocity space as seen in strongly peaked one dimensional
redshift histograms in each eld
The original CfA survey completed in 1982 contained redshifts for 2400
galaxies brighter than magnitude 145 across the north and south galactic poles
covering a total of 27 steradians The major aims of the survey were cosmologi-
cal and included quantifying the clustering of galaxies in three dimensions This
survey produced large area moderately deep three dimensional maps of large
scale structure see Fig 2 in which one could identify galaxy clusters voids
and an apparent lamentary connected structure between groups of galaxies
which the authors caution could be random projections of distinct structures
Davis et al 1982 This paper also performed a comparison of the so-called
complex topology of the large scale structure seen in the galaxy distribution
with that seen in N-body dark matter simulations paving the way for future
studies of theoretical models of structure formation
The second CfA redshift survey which ran from 1985 to 1995 contained
spectra for 5800 galaxies and revealed the existence of the so-called Great
Wall a supercluster of galaxies that extends over 170 h1 Mpc the width of the
survey Geller  Huchra 1989 Large underdense voids were also commonly
found with a density 20 of the mean density
Redshift surveys have rapidly progressed with the development of multi-

ascension projected through 3 in declination from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift
Survey from Colless et al 2004
object spectrographs which allow simultaneous observations of hundreds of
galaxies and larger telescopes which allow deeper surveys of both lower lu-
minosity nearby galaxies and more distant luminous galaxies At present the
largest redshift surveys of galaxies at low redshift are the Two Degree Field
Galaxy Redshift Survey 2dFGRS Colless et al 2001 and the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey SDSS York et al 2000 which cover volumes of  4  107 h3
Mpc3 and  2  108 h3 Mpc3 with spectroscopic redshifts for 220000 and
a million galaxies respectively These surveys provide the best current maps of
large scale structure in the Universe today see Fig 3 revealing a sponge-like
pattern to the distribution of galaxies Gott et al 1986 Voids of 10 h1
Mpc are clearly seen containing very few galaxies Filaments stretching greater
than 10 h1 Mpc surround the voids and intersect at the locations of galaxy
groups and clusters
The prevailing theoretical paradigm regarding the existence of large scale
structure is that the initial uctuations in the energy density of the early Uni-
verse seen as temperature deviations in the cosmic microwave background grow
through gravitational instability into the structure seen today in the galaxy
density eld The details of large scale structure  the sizes densities and dis-
tribution of the observed structure  depend both on cosmological parameters
such as the matter density and dark energy as well as on the physics of galaxy
formation and evolution Measurements of large scale structure can therefore
constrain both cosmology and galaxy evolution physics
2 The Two-Point Correlation Function
In order to quantify the clustering of galaxies one must survey not only galaxies
in clusters but rather the entire galaxy density distribution from voids to super-
clusters The most commonly used quantitative measure of large scale structure
is the galaxy two-point correlation function r which traces the amplitude of
galaxy clustering as a function of scale r is dened as a measure of the ex-
cess probability dP  above what is expected for an unclustered random Poisson
distribution of nding a galaxy in a volume element dV at a separation r from
another galaxy
dP  n1  rdV
where n is the mean number density of the galaxy sample in question Peebles
1980 Measurements of r are generally performed in comoving space with
r having units of h1 Mpc The Fourier transform of the two-point correla-
tion function is the power spectrum which is often used to describe density
uctuations observed in the cosmic microwave background
To measure r one counts pairs of galaxies as a function of separation
and divides by what is expected for an unclustered distribution To do this
one must construct a random catalog that has the identical three dimensional
coverage as the data  including the same sky coverage and smoothed redshift
distribution  but is populated with randomly-distribution points The ratio of
pairs of galaxies observed in the data relative to pairs of points in the random
catalog is then used to estimate r Several dierent estimators for r have
been proposed and tested An early estimator that was widely used is from
Davis  Peebles 1983
DR  1
where DD and DR are counts of pairs of galaxies in bins of separation in the
data catalog and between the data and random catalogs and nD and nR are the
mean number densities of galaxies in the data and random catalogs Hamilton
1993 later introduced an estimator with smaller statistical errors
DR2  1
where RR is the count of pairs of galaxies as a function of separation in the
random catalog The most commonly-used estimator is from Landy  Szalay
1993
RRDDcid18 nR
nDcid192
 2DRcid18 nR
nDcid19  RR 
This estimator has been shown to perform as well as the Hamilton estimator
Eqn 3 and while it requires more computational time it is less sensitive to the
size of the random catalog and handles edge corrections well which can aect
clustering measurements on large scales Kerscher et al 2000
As can be seen from the form of the estimators given above measuring r
depends sensitively on having a random catalog which accurately reects the
various spatial and redshift selection aects in the data These can include
eects such as edges of slitmasks or ber plates overlapping slitmasks or plates
gaps between chips on the CCD and changes in spatial sensitivity within the
detector ie the eective radial dependence within X-ray detectors If one is
measuring a full three-dimensional correlation function discussed below then
the random catalog must also accurately include the redshift selection of the
data The random catalog should also be large enough to not introduce Poisson
error in the estimator This can be checked by ensuring that the RR pair counts
in the smallest bin are high enough such that Poisson errors are subdominant
3 Angular Clustering
The spatial distribution of galaxies can be measured either in two dimensions as
projected onto the plane of the sky or in three dimensions using the redshift of
each galaxy As it can be observationally expensive to obtain spectra for large
samples of particularly faint galaxies redshift information is not always avail-
able for a given sample One can then measure the two-dimensional projected
angular correlation function  dened as the probability above Poisson of
nding two galaxies with an angular separation 
dP  N 1  d
where N is the mean number of galaxies per steradian and d is the solid angle
of a second galaxy at a separation  from a randomly chosen galaxy
Measurements of  are known to be low by an additive factor known
as the integral constraint which results from using the data sample itself
which often does not cover large areas of the sky to estimate the mean galaxy
density This correction becomes important on angular scales comparable to
the survey size on much smaller scales it is negligible One can either restrict
measurements of the angular clustering to scales where the integral constraint
is not important or estimate the amplitude of the integral constraint correction
by doubly integrating an assumed power law form of  over the survey area
 using
where  is the area subtended by the survey In practice this can be numerically
estimated over the survey geometry using the random catalog itself see Roche
 Eales 1999 for details
The projected angular two-point correlation function  can generally be
t with a power law
  A
where A is the clustering amplitude at a given scale often 1 and  is the slope
of the correlation function
Z Z d1d2
From measurements of  one can infer the three-dimensional spatial two-
point correlation function r if the redshift distribution of the sources is
well known The two-point correlation function r is usually t as a power
law r  rr0 where r0 is the characteristic scale-length of the galaxy
clustering dened as the scale at which   1 As the two-dimensional galaxy
clustering seen in the plane of the sky is a projection of the three-dimensional
clustering  is directly related to its three-dimensional analog r For
a given r one can predict the amplitude and slope of  using Limbers
equation eectively integrating r along the redshift direction eg Peebles
1980 If one assumes r and thus  to be a power law over the redshift
range of interest such that

where dNdz is the number of galaxies per unit redshift interval and gz de-

gz cid18 dz
drcid19 r1F r
Here F r is the curvature factor in the Robertson-Walker metric
ds2  c2dt2  a2dr2F r2  r2d2  r2sin2d2
If the redshift distribution of sources dNdz is well known then the ampli-
tude of  can be predicted for a given power law model of r such that
measurements of  can be used to place constraints on the evolution of r
Interpreting angular clustering results can be dicult however as there is
a degeneracy between the inherent clustering amplitude and the redshift distri-
bution of the sources in the sample For example an observed weakly clustered
signal projected on the plane of the sky could be due either to the galaxy popu-
lation being intrinsically weakly clustered and projected over a relatively short
distance along the line of sight or it could result from an inherently strongly
clustered distribution integrated over a long distance which would wash out the
signal The uncertainty on the redshift distribution is therefore often the dom-
inant error in analyses using angular clustering measurements The assumed
galaxy redshift distribution dNdz has varied widely in dierent studies such
that similar observed angular clustering results have led to widely dierent con-
clusions A further complication is that each sample usually spans a large range
of redshifts and is magnitude-limited such that the mean intrinsic luminosity
of the galaxies is changing with redshift within a sample which can hinder
interpretation of the evolution of clustering measured in  studies
Many of the rst measurements of large scale structure were studies of an-
gular clustering One of the earliest determinations was the pioneering work of
Peebles 1975 using photographic plates from the Lick survey Fig 1 They
found  to be well t by a power law with a slope of   08 Later studies
using CCDs were able to reach deeper magnitude limits and found that fainter
galaxies had a lower clustering amplitude One such study was conducted by
Postman et al 1998 who surveyed a contiguous 4 by 4 eld to a depth of
IAB  24 mag reaching to z  1 Later surveys that covered multiple elds on
the sky found similar results The lower clustering amplitude observed for galax-
ies with fainter apparent magnitudes can in principle be due either to clustering
being a function of luminosity andor a function of redshift To disentangle this
dependence each author assumes a dNdz distribution for galaxies as a func-
tion of apparent magnitude and then ts the observed  with dierent models
of the redshift dependence of clustering While many authors measure similar
values of the dependence of  on apparent magnitude due to dierences in
the assumed dNdz distributions dierent conclusions are reached regarding the
amount of luminosity and redshift dependence to galaxy clustering Addition-
ally quoted error bars on the inferred values of r0 generally include only Poisson
andor cosmic variance error estimates while the dominant error is often the
lack of knowledge of dNdz for the particular sample in question
Because of the sensitivity of the inferred value of r0 on the redshift distri-
bution of sources it is preferable to measure the three dimensional correlation
function While it is much easier to interpret three dimensional clustering mea-
surements in cases where it is still not feasible to obtain redshifts for a large
fraction of galaxies in the sample angular clustering measurements are still em-
ployed This is currently the case in particular with high redshift andor very
dusty optically-obscured galaxy samples such as sub-millimeter galaxies eg
Brodwin et al 2008 Maddox et al 2010 However without knowledge of the
redshift distribution of the sources these measurements are hard to interpret
4 Real and Redshift Space Clustering
Measurements of the two-point correlation function use the redshift of a galaxy
not its distance to infer its location along the line of sight This introduces
two complications one is that a cosmological model has to be assumed to con-
vert measured redshifts to inferred distances and the other is that peculiar
velocities introduce redshift space distortions in  parallel to the line of sight
Sargent  Turner 1977 On the rst point errors on the assumed cosmology
are generally subdominant so that while in theory one could assume dierent
cosmological parameters and check which results are consistent with the as-
sumed values that is generally not necessary On the second point redshift
space distortions can be measured to constrain cosmological parameters and
they can also be integrated over to recover the underlying real space correlation
function
On small spatial scales  1 h1 Mpc within collapsed virialized overden-
sities such as groups and clusters galaxies have large random motions relative
to each other Therefore while all of the galaxies in the group or cluster have a
similar physical distance from the observer they have somewhat dierent red-
shifts This causes an elongation in redshift space maps along the line of sight
within overdense regions which is referred to as Fingers of God The result is
that groups and clusters appear to be radially extended along the line of sight
towards the observer This eect can be seen clearly in Fig 4 where the lower
left panel shows galaxies in redshift space with large Fingers of God pointing
back to the observer while in the lower right panel the Fingers of God have
been modeled and removed Redshift space distortions are also seen on larger
scales  1 h1 Mpc due to streaming motions of galaxies that are infalling
onto structures that are still collapsing Adjacent galaxies will all be moving
in the same direction which leads to coherent motion and causes an apparent
contraction of structure along the line of sight in redshift space Kaiser 1987
in the opposite sense as the Fingers of God
Redshift space distortions can be clearly seen in measurements of galaxy
clustering While redshift space distortions can be used to uncover informa-
tion about the underlying matter density and thermal motions of the galaxies
discussed below they complicate a measurement of the two-point correlation
function in real space
Instead of r what is measured is s where s is
the redshift space separation between a pair of galaxies While some results in
the literature present measurements of s for various galaxy populations it is
not straightforward to compare results for dierent galaxy samples and dierent
redshifts as the amplitude of redshift space distortions diers depending on the
galaxy type and redshift Additionally s does not follow a power law over
the same scales as r as redshift space distortions on both small and large
scales decrease the amplitude of clustering relative to intermediate scales
The real-space correlation function r measures the underlying physical
clustering of galaxies independent of any peculiar velocities Therefore in order
to recover the real-space correlation function one can measure  in two dimen-
sions both perpendicular to and along the line of sight Following Fisher et al
1994 v1 and v2 are dened to be the redshift positions of a pair of galaxies
s to be the redshift space separation v1  v2 and l  1
2 v1  v2 to be the
mean distance to the pair The separation between the two galaxies across rp
and along  the line of sight are dened as
rp ps  s  2
One can then compute pair counts over a two-dimensional grid of separations to

alized structures along the line of sight from Tegmark et al 2004 Shown are

in this slice 67626 galaxies in total while the bottom row shows galaxies that
have been identied as having Fingers of God The right column shows the
position of these galaxies in this space after modeling and removing the eects

of God eect can be seen in the lower left panel as the positions of galaxies

An example of a measurement of rp  is shown in Fig 5 Plotted is  as a
function of separation rp dened in this gure to be  across and  along the
line of sight What is usually shown is the upper right quadrant of this gure
which here has been reected about both axes to emphasize the distortions
Contours of constant  follow the color-coding where yellow corresponds to
large  values and green to low values On small scales across the line of sight
rp or   2 h1 Mpc the contours are clearly elongated in the  direction
this reects the Fingers of God from galaxies in virialized overdensities On
large scales across the line of sight rP or   10 h1 Mpc the contours are
attened along the line of sight due to the Kaiser eect This indicates that
galaxies on these linear scales are coherently streaming onto structures that are
still collapsing
As this eect is due to the gravitational infall of galaxies onto massive
forming structures the strength of the signature depends on matter Kaiser
1987 derived that the large-scale anisotropy in the rp  plane depends on
  matterb on linear scales where b is the bias or the ratio of density uctua-
tions in the galaxy population relative to that of dark matter discussed further

ments of rp  dened as

nomials and  is the angle between s and the line of sight The ratio 20

Similar measurements have been made with clustering measurements using data
from the SDSS Very large galaxy samples are needed to detect this coherent

nd   070  026 at z  077 using data from the VVDS and argue that
measurements of  as a function of redshift can be used to trace the expansion
history of the Universe We return to the discussion of redshift space distortions
on small scales below in Section 63
What is often desired however is a measurement of the real space clustering
of galaxies To recover r one can then project rp  along the rp axis As
redshift space distortions aect only the line-of-sight component of rp 
integrating over the  direction leads to a statistic wprp which is independent
of redshift space distortions Following Davis  Peebles 1983

where y is the real-space separation along the line of sight If r is modeled as
a power-law r  rr0 then r0 and  can be readily extracted from the
projected correlation function wprp using an analytic solution to Equation
wprp  rpcid18 r0

where  is the usual gamma function A power-law t to wprp will then recover
r0 and  for the real-space correlation function r In practice Equation 17
is not integrated to innite separations Often values of max are 40-80 h1
Mpc which includes most correlated pairs It is worth noting that the values of
r0 and  inferred are covariant One must therefore be careful when comparing
clustering amplitudes of dierent galaxy populations simply comparing the r0
values may be misleading if the correlation function slopes are dierent It is
often preferred to compare the galaxy bias instead see next section
As a nal note on measuring the two-point correlation function as can be
seen from Fig 3 ux-limited galaxy samples contain a higher density of galaxies
at lower redshift This is purely an observational artifact due to the apparent
magnitude limit including intrinsically lower luminosity galaxies nearby while
only tracing the higher luminosity galaxies further away As discussed below
in Section 6 because the clustering amplitude of galaxies depends on their
properties including luminosity one would ideally only measure r in volume-
limited samples where galaxies of the same absolute magnitude are observed
throughout the entire volume of the sample including at the highest redshifts
Therefore often the full observed galaxy population is not used in measurements
of r rather volume-limited sub-samples are created where all galaxies are
brighter than a given absolute magnitude limit This greatly facilitates the
theoretical interpretation of clustering measurements see Section 8 and the
comparison of results from dierent surveys
5 Galaxy Bias
It was realized decades ago that the spatial clustering of observable galaxies
need not precisely mirror the clustering of the bulk of the matter in the Uni-
In its most general form the galaxy density can be a non-local and
stochastic function of the underlying dark matter density This galaxy bias 
the relationship between the spatial distribution of galaxies and the underlying
dark matter density eld  is a result of the varied physics of galaxy formation
which can cause the spatial distribution of baryons to dier from that of dark
matter Stochasticity appears to have little eect on bias except for adding
extra variance eg Scoccimarro 2000 and non-locality can be taken into
account to rst order by using smoothed densities over larger scales In this
approximation the smoothed galaxy density contrast is a general function of
the underlying dark matter density contrast on some scale
g  f 
where     1 and  is the mean mass density on that scale If we assume
f  is a linear function of  then we can dene the linear galaxies bias b as the
ratio of the mean overdensity of galaxies to the mean overdensity of mass
b  g
and can in theory depend on scale and galaxy properties such as luminosity
morphology color and redshift In terms of the correlation function the linear
bias is dened as the square root of the ratio of the two-point correlation function
of the galaxies relative to the dark matter
b  galdark matter12
and is a function of scale Note that dark matter is the Fourier transform of the
dark matter power spectrum The bias of galaxies relative to dark matter is
often referred to as the absolute bias as opposed to the relative bias between
galaxy populations discussed below
The concept of galaxies being a biased tracer of the underlying total mass
eld which is dominated by dark matter was introduced by Kaiser 1984 in
an attempt to reconcile the dierent clustering scale lengths of galaxies and rich
clusters which could not both be unbiased tracers of mass Kaiser 1984 show
that clusters of galaxies would naturally have a large bias as a result of being
rare objects which formed at the highest density peaks of the mass distribution
above some critical threshold This idea is further developed analytically by
Bardeen et al 1986 for galaxies who show that for a Gaussian distribution of
initial mass density uctuations the peaks which rst collapse to form galaxies
will be more clustered than the underlying mass distribution Mo  White
1996 use extended Press-Schechter theory to determine that the bias depends
on the mass of the dark matter halo as well as the epoch of galaxy formation
and that a linear bias is a decent approximation well into the non-linear regime
where  1 The evolution of bias with redshift is developed in theoretical
work by Fry 1996 and Tegmark  Peebles 1998 who nd that the bias is
naturally larger at earlier epochs of galaxy formation as the rst galaxies to
form will collapse in the most overdense regions of space which are biased akin
to mountain peaks being clustered They further show that regardless of the
initial amplitude of the bias factor with time galaxies will become unbiased
tracers of the mass distribution b 1 as t   Additionally Mann et al
1998 nd that while bias is generally scale-dependent the dependence is weak
and on large scales the bias tends towards a constant value
A galaxy population can be anti-biased if b  1 indicating that galaxies
are less clustered than the dark matter distribution As discussed below this
appears to be the case for some galaxy samples at low redshift The galaxy bias
of a given observational sample is often inferred by comparing the observed clus-
tering of galaxies with the clustering of dark matter measured in a cosmological
simulation Therefore the bias depends on the cosmological model used in the
simulation The dominant relevant cosmological parameter is 8 dened as the
standard deviation of galaxy count uctuations in a sphere of radius 8 h1 Mpc
and the absolute bias value inferred can be simply scaled with the assumed value
of 8 As discussed in section 91 below the absolute galaxy bias can also be
estimated from the data directly without having to resort to comparisons with
cosmological simulations by using the ratio of the two-point and three-point
correlation functions which have dierent dependencies on the bias While this
measurement can be somewhat noisy it has the advantage of not assuming a
cosmological model from which to derive the dark matter clustering This mea-
surement is performed by Verde et al 2002 and Gaztanaga et al 2005 who
nd that galaxies in 2dFGRS have a linear bias value very close to unity on
large scales
The relative bias between dierent galaxy populations can also be measured
and is dened as the ratio of the clustering of one population relative to another
This is often measured using the ratio of the projected correlation functions of
each population
bgal1gal2  wpgal1wpgal212
where both measurements of wprp have been integrated to the same value of
max The relative bias is used to compare the clustering of galaxies as a function
of observed parameters and does not refer to the clustering of dark matter It is
a useful way to compare the observed clustering for dierent galaxy populations
without having to rely on an assumed value of 8 for the dark matter
6 The Dependence of Clustering on Galaxy Prop-
The two-point correlation function has long been known to depend on galaxy
properties and can vary as a function of galaxy luminosity morphological or
spectral type color stellar mass and redshift The general trend is that galax-
ies that are more luminous early-type bulge-dominated optically red andor
higher stellar mass are more clustered than galaxies that are less luminous
late-type disk-dominated optically blue andor lower stellar mass Presented
below are relatively recent results indicating how clustering properties depend
on galaxy properties from the largest redshifts surveys currently available The
physical interpretation behind these trends is presented in Section 8 below
61 Luminosity Dependence

redshift What is plotted is the spatial distribution of galaxies in a ux-limited
sample meaning that all galaxies down to a given apparent magnitude limit are
included This results in the apparent lack of galaxies or structure at higher
redshift in the gure as at large distances only the most luminous galaxies
will be included in a ux-limited sample In order to robustly determine the
underlying clustering one should if possible create volume-limited subsamples
in which galaxies of the same luminosity can be detected at all redshifts In
this way the mean luminosity of the sample does not change with redshift and
galaxies at all redshifts are weighted equally
The left panel of Fig 6 shows the projected correlation function wprp
for galaxies in SDSS in volume-limited subsamples corresponding to dierent
absolute magnitude ranges The more luminous galaxies are more strongly
clustered across a wide range in absolute optical magnitude from 17  Mr 
23 Power law ts on scales from 01 h1 Mpc to 10 h1 Mpc show that
while the clustering amplitude depends sensitively on luminosity the slope does

projected correlation function wprp for SDSS galaxies in dierent absolute
magnitude ranges where brighter galaxies are seen to be more clustered On
the right is the relative bias of galaxies as a function of luminosity Both gures
are from Zehavi et al 2005
not Only in the brightest and faintest magnitude bins does the slope deviate
from   18 and have a steeper value of   20 Across this magnitude range
r0 varies from 28 h1 Mpc at the faint end to 10 h1 Mpc at the bright
end This same general trend is found in the 2dFGRS and other redshift surveys
eg Norberg et al 2001
The right panel of Fig 6 shows the relative bias of SDSS galaxies as a
function of luminosity relative to the clustering of L galaxies measured at
the scale of rp  27 h1 Mpc which is in the non-linear regime where   1
Zehavi et al 2005 L is the characteristic galaxy luminosity dened as the
luminosity of the break in the galaxy luminosity function The relative bias is
seen to steadily increase at higher luminosity and rise sharply above L This is
in good agreement with the results from Tegmark et al 2004 using the power
spectrum of SDSS galaxies measured in the linear regime on a scale of  100
h1 Mpc The data also agree with the clustering results of galaxies in the
2dFGRS from Norberg et al 2001 The overall shape of the relative bias with
luminosity indicates a slow rise up to the value at L above which the rise is
much steeper As discussed in Section 82 below this trend shows that brighter
galaxies reside in more massive dark matter halos than fainter galaxies
62 Color and Spectral Type Dependence
The clustering strength of galaxies also depends on restframe color and spectral
type with a stronger dependence than on luminosity Fig 7 shows the spatial
distribution of galaxies in SDSS color coded as a function of restframe color
Red galaxies are seen to preferentially populate the most overdense regions
while blue galaxies are more smoothly distributed in space This is reected
in the correlation function of galaxies split by restframe color Red galaxies
have a larger correlation length and steeper slope than blue galaxies r05-6
h1 Mpc and  20 for red L galaxies while r03-4 h1 Mpc and  17
for blue L galaxies in SDSS Zehavi et al 2005 Clustering studies from the
2dFGRS split the galaxy sample at low redshift by spectral type into galaxies
with emission line spectra versus absorption line spectra corresponding to star
forming and quiescent galaxies and nd similar results that quiescent galaxies
have larger correlation lengths and steeper clustering slopes than star forming
galaxies Madgwick et al 2003
Red and blue galaxies have distinct luminosity-dependent clustering proper-
ties As shown in Fig 8 the general trends seen in r0 and  with luminosity for
all galaxies are well-reected in the blue galaxy population however at faint
luminosities L  05L red galaxies have larger clustering amplitudes and
slopes than L red galaxies This reects the fact that faint red galaxies are
often found distributed throughout galaxy clusters
Galaxy clustering also depends on other galaxy properties such as stellar
mass concentration index and the strength of the 4000A break D4000 in
that galaxies that have larger stellar mass more centrally concentrated light
proles andor larger D4000 measurements indicating older stellar populations
are more clustered Li et al 2006 This is not surprising given the observed
trends with luminosity and color and the known dependencies of other galaxy
properties with luminosity and color Clearly the galaxy bias is a complicated
function of various galaxy properties
63 Redshift Space Distortions
The fact that red galaxies are more clustered than blue galaxies is related to
the morphology-density relation Dressler 1980 which results from the fact
that galaxies with elliptical morphologies are more likely to be found in regions
of space with a higher local surface density of galaxies The redshift space
distortions seen for red and blue galaxies also show this
As discussed in Section 4 redshift space distortions arise from two dierent
phenomena virialized motions of galaxies within collapsed overdensities such as
groups and clusters and the coherent streaming motion of galaxies onto larger
structures that are still collapsing The former is seen on relatively small scales
rp  1 h1 Mpc while the latter is detected on larger scales rP  1 h1 Mpc
While the presence of redshift space distortions complicates the measurement of
the real space r these distortions can be used to uncover information about
the thermal motions of galaxies in groups and clusters as well as the amplitude
of the mass density of the Universe matter

escent galaxies on the left show larger Fingers of God than the star forming
galaxies on the right reecting the fact that red quiescent galaxies have larger

ters while blue galaxies populate further into the galaxy voids Taken from
Zehavi et al 2011

red and blue galaxies in SDSS as a function of luminosity While all galaxies
are more clustered at brighter luminosities and red galaxies are more clustered
than blue galaxies at all luminosities below L the red galaxy clustering length
increases at fainter luminosities The clustering slope for faint red galaxies is
also much steeper than at other luminosities Taken from Zehavi et al 2011
Figure 9 Two-dimensional redshift space correlation function rp  as in
Fig 6 here  is used instead of rp for quiescent absorption line galaxies on the

tortions are dierent for the dierent galaxy populations with quiescent andor

motions relative to each others This naturally arises if red quiescent galax-
ies reside in more massive virialized overdensities with larger random peculiar
velocities than star forming optically blue galaxies The large scale coherent
infall of galaxies is seen both for blue and red galaxies though it is often easier
to see for blue galaxies due to their smaller Fingers of God
These small scale redshift space distortions can be quantied using the 12
statistic known as the pairwise velocity dispersion Davis et al 1978 Fisher et al
1994 This is measured by modeling rp  in real space which is then con-
volved with a distribution of random pairwise motions f v such that

where the random motions are often taken to have an exponential form which
has been found to t observed data well

In the 2dFGRS Madgwick et al 2003 nd that 12 416  76 km s1 for
star forming galaxies and 12 61292 km s1 for quiescent galaxies measured
on scales of 8-20 h1 Mpc Using SDSS data Zehavi et al 2002 nd that 12is
 300  450 km s1 for blue star forming galaxies and  650  750 km s1 for
red quiescent galaxies It has been shown however that this statistic can be
sensitive to large rare overdensities such that samples covering large volumes
are needed to measures it robustly
Madgwick et al 2003 further measure the large scale anisotropies seen in
rp  for galaxies split by spectral type and nd that   049  013 for
star forming galaxies and   048  014 for quiescent galaxies This implies
a similar bias for both galaxy types on large scales though they nd that on
smaller scales integrated up to 8 h1 Mpc the relative bias of quiescent to star
forming galaxies is brel  145  014
7 The Evolution of Galaxy Clustering
The observed clustering of galaxies is expected to evolve with time as structure
continues to grow due to gravity The exact evolution depends on cosmological
parameters such as  and matter Larger values of  for example lead to
larger voids and higher density contrasts between overdense and underdense
regions By measuring the clustering of galaxies at higher redshift one can break
degeneracies that exist between the galaxy bias and cosmological parameters
that are constrained by low redshift clustering measurements It is therefore
useful to determine the clustering of galaxies as a function of cosmic epoch not
only to further constrain cosmological parameters but also galaxy evolution
One might expect the galaxy clustering amplitude r0 to increase over time
as overdense regions become more overdense as galaxies move towards groups
and clusters due to gravity However the exact evolution of the clustering
of galaxies depends not only on gravity but also on the expansion history of
the Universe and therefore cosmological parameters such as  Additionally
over time new galaxies form while existing galaxies grow in both mass and
luminosity Therefore the expected changes of galaxy clustering as a function
of redshift depend both on relatively well-known cosmological parameters and
more unknown galaxy formation and evolution physics which likely depends on
gas accretion star formation and feedback processes as well as mergers
For a given cosmological model one can predict how the clustering of dark
matter should evolve with time using cosmological N-body simulations For
a CDM Universe r0 for dark matter particles is expected to increase from
08 h1 Mpc at z  3 to 5 h1 Mpc at z  0 Weinberg et al 2004
However according to hierarchical structure formation theories at high redshifts
the rst galaxies to form will be the rst structures to collapse which will
be biased tracers of the mass The galaxy bias is expected to be a strong
function of redshift initially  1 at high redshift and approaching unity over
time Therefore r0 for galaxies may be a much weaker function of time than it is
for dark matter as the same galaxies are not observed as a function of redshift
and over time new galaxies form in less biased locations in the Universe
The projected angular and three dimensional correlation functions of galaxies
have been observed to z  5 Star-forming Lyman break galaxies at z  35 are
found to have r0  4 6 h1 Mpc with a bias relative to dark matter of  3 4
Ouchi et al 2004 Adelberger et al 2005 Brighter Lyman break galaxies
are found to cluster more strongly than fainter Lyman break galaxies The
correlation length r0 is found to be roughly constant between z  5 and z  3
implying that the bias is increasing at earlier cosmic epoch Spectroscopic galaxy
surveys at z  2 are currently limited to samples of at most a few thousand
galaxies so most clustering measurements are angular at these epochs In one
such study by Wake et al 2011 photometric redshifts of tens of thousands of
galaxies at 1  z  2 are used to measure the angular clustering as a function of
stellar mass They nd a strong dependence of clustering amplitude on stellar
mass in each of three redshift intervals in this range
At z  1 larger spectroscopic galaxy samples exist and three dimensional
two-point clustering analyses have been performed as a function of luminosity
color stellar mass and spectral type The same general clustering trends with
galaxy property that are observed at z  0 are also seen at z  1 in that
galaxies that are brighter redder early spectral type andor more massive
are more clustered The clustering scale length of red galaxies is found to be
 5 6 h1 Mpc while for blue galaxies it is  35 45 h1 Mpc depending on
luminosity Meneux et al 2006 Coil et al 2008 At a given luminosity the
observed correlation length is only 15 smaller at z  1 than z  0 indicating
that unlike for dark matter the galaxy r0 is roughly constant over time These
results are consistent with predictions from CDM simulations
The measured values of r0 at z  1 imply that are more biased at z  1
than at z  0 Within the DEEP2 sample the bias measured on scales of
 1 10 h1 Mpc varies from  125 155 with brighter galaxy samples being
more biased tracers of the dark matter Coil et al 2006 These results are
consistent with the idea that galaxies formed early on in the most overdense
regions of space which are biased
As in the nearby Universe the clustering amplitude is a stronger function
of color than of luminosity at z  1 Additionally the color-density relation is
found to already be in place at z  1 in that the relative bias of red to blue
galaxies is as high at z  1 as at z  01 Coil et al 2008 This implies that
the color-density relation is not due to cluster-specic physics as most galaxies
at z  1 in eld spectroscopic surveys are not in clusters Therefore it must
be physical processes at play in galaxy groups that initially set the color and
morphology-density relations Red galaxies show larger Fingers of God in
rp  measurements than blue galaxies do again showing that red galaxies
at z  1 lie preferentially in virialized more massive overdensities compared to
blue galaxies Both red and blue galaxies show coherent infall on large scales
8 Halo Model Interpretation of r
The current paradigm of galaxy formation posits that galaxies form in the center
of larger dark matter halos collapsed overdensities in the dark matter distri-
bution with    200 inside of which all mass is gravitationally bound The
clustering of galaxies can then be understood as a combination of the cluster-
ing of dark matter halos which depends on cosmological parameters and how
galaxies populate dark matter halos which depends on galaxy formation and
evolution physics For a given cosmological model the properties of dark mat-
ter halos including their evolution with time can be studied in detail using
N-body simulations The masses and spatial distribution of dark matter halos
should depend only on the properties of dark matter not baryonic matter and
the expansion history of the Universe therefore the clustering of dark matter
halos should be insensitive to baryon physics However the eciency of galaxy
formation is very dependent on the complicated baryonic physics of for exam-
ple star formation gas cooling and feedback processes The halo model allows
the relatively simple cosmological dependence of galaxy clustering to be cleanly
separated from the more complex baryonic astrophysics and it shows how clus-
tering measurements for a range of galaxy types can be used to constrain galaxy
evolution physics
81 Estimating the Mean Halo Mass from the Bias
One can use the observed large scale clustering amplitude of dierent observed
galaxy populations to identify the typical mass of their parent dark matter
halos in order to place these galaxies in a cosmological context The large
scale clustering amplitude of dark matter halos as a function of halo mass is
well determined in N-body simulations and analytic tting formula are pro-
vided by eg Mo  White 1996 and Sheth et al 2001 Analytic models
can then predict the clustering of both dark matter particles and galaxies as a
function of scale by using the clustering of dark matter halos and the radial
density prole of dark matter and galaxies within those halos Ma  Fry 2000
Peacock  Smith 2000 Seljak 2000 In this scheme on large linear scales
where   1    1 the clustering of a given galaxy population can be used
to determine the mean mass of the dark matter halos hosting those galaxies for
a given cosmological model To achieve this the large-scale bias is estimated by
comparing the observed galaxy clustering amplitude with that of dark matter
in an N-body simulation and then galaxies are assumed to reside in halos of a
given mass that have the same bias in simulations
Simulations show that higher mass halos cluster more strongly than lower
mass halos Sheth  Tormen 1999 This then leads to an interpretation of
galaxy clustering as a function of luminosity in which luminous galaxies reside
in more massive dark matter halos than less luminous galaxies Similarly red
galaxies typically reside in more massive halos than blue galaxies of the same
luminosity this is observationally veried by the larger Fingers of God ob-
served for red galaxies Combining the large scale bias with the observed galaxy
number density further allows one to constrain the fraction of halos that host
a given galaxy type by comparing the galaxy space density to the parent dark
matter halo space density This constrains the duty cycle or fraction of halos
hosting galaxies of a given population
82 Halo Occupation Distribution Modeling
While such estimates of the mean host halo mass and duty cycle are fairly
straightforward to carry out a greater understanding of the relation between
galaxy light and dark matter mass is gleaned by performing halo occupation
distribution modeling
The general halo-based model discussed above in which the clustering of
galaxies reects the clustering of halos was further developed by Peacock  Smith
2000 to include the eciency of galaxy formation or how galaxies populate
halos The proposed model depends on both the halo occupation number equal
to the number of galaxies in a halo of a given mass for a galaxy sample brighter
than some limit and the location of the galaxies within these halos
Peacock  Smith 2000 model it is assumed that one galaxy is at the center of
the halo the central galaxy and the rest of the galaxies in the same halo are
satellite galaxies that trace the dark matter radial mass distribution which
follows an NFW prole Navarro et al 1997 The latter assumption results in
a general power law shape for the galaxy correlation function
A similar idea was proposed by Benson et al 2000 who used a semi-
analytic model in conjunction with a cosmological N-body simulation to show
that the observed galaxy r could be reproduced with a CDM simulation
though not with a  CDM simulation with matter  1 They also employ
a method for locating galaxies inside dark matter halos such that one galaxy
resides at the center of all halos above a given mass threshold while additional
galaxies are assigned the location of a random dark matter particle within the
same halo such that galaxies have the same NFW radial prole within halos as
the dark matter particles see Fig 10 left panel
In these models the clustering of galaxies on scales larger than a typical
halo  1  2 h1 Mpc results from pairs of galaxies in separate halos called
the two-halo term while the clustering on smaller scales  1 h1 Mpc is
due to pairs of galaxies within the same parent halo called the one-halo term
When the pairs from these two terms are added together the resulting galaxy
correlation function should roughly follow a power law
Benson et al 2000 show that on large scales there is a simple relation
in the bias between galaxies and dark matter halos while on small scales the
correlation function depends on the number of galaxies in a halo and the nite
size of halos When the clustering signal from these two scales corresponding to
the two-halo and one-halo terms is combined a power law results for the
galaxy r right panel Fig 10 Galaxies are found to be anti-biased relative
to dark matter ie less clustered than the dark matter on scales smaller than
the typical halo though the bias is close to unity on larger scales The clustering
of galaxies that results from this semi-analytic model is also found to match the
observed clustering of galaxies in the APM survey above a given luminosity
threshold Baugh 1996
By dening the halo occupation distribution HOD as the probability that a
halo of a given mass contains N galaxies P NM  Berlind  Weinberg 2002
quantify how the observed galaxy r depends on dierent HOD model pa-
rameters Using N-body simulations they identify dark matter halos and place
galaxies into the simulation using a simple HOD model with two parameters
a minimum mass at which a halo hosts on average one central galaxy Mmin
at the center of the halo and the slope  of the P NM  function for satel-
lite galaxies The latter determines how many satellite galaxies there are as
a function of halo mass They further assume that the satellite galaxies fol-
low an NFW prole as the dark matter does though the concentration of the
radial prole can be changed They show that the two-halo term is simply
the halo center correlation function weighted by a large scale bias factor while
the one-halo term is sensitive to both  and the concentration of the galaxy
prole within halos Obtaining a power law r therefore strongly constrains
the HOD model parameters
Kravtsov et al 2004 propose that the locations of satellite galaxies within
dark matter halos should correspond to locations of subhalos distinct gravita-
tionally bound regions within the larger dark matter halos instead of tracing
random dark matter particles Using cosmological N-body simulations they
show that at z  1 r for galaxies should deviate strongly from a power law
on small scales due to a rise in the one-halo term In this model the cluster-
ing of galaxies can be understood as the clustering of dark matter parent halos
and subhalos and the power law shape that is observed at z  0 is a coinci-
dence of the one- and two-halo terms having similar amplitudes and slopes at
the typical scale of halos They nd that the formation and evolution of halos
and subhalos through merging and dynamical processes are the main physical
drivers of large scale structure

that is provided by SDSS departures from a power law r were detected by
Zehavi et al 2004 using a volume-limited subsample of 22000 galaxies from
a parent sample of 118000 galaxies The deviations from a power law are small
enough at z  0 that a large sample covering a suciently large cosmological
volume is required to overcome the errors due to cosmic variance to detect these
small deviations It is found that there is a change in the slope of r on scales
of 1-2 h1 Mpc this corresponds to the scale at which the one and two halo
term are equal see Fig 11 Zehavi et al 2004 nd that r measured from
the SDSS data is better t by an HOD model which includes small deviations
from a power law than by a pure power law The HOD model that is t has
three parameters the minimum mass to host a single central galaxy Mmin the
minimum mass to host a single satellite galaxy M1 and the slope of P NM 
 which determines the average number of satellite galaxies as a function
of host halo mass In this model dark matter halos with Mmin  M  M1
host a single galaxy while above M1 they host on average MM1 galaxies
Using wprp one can t for M1 and  while the observed space density of
galaxies is used to derive Mmin For a galaxy sample with Mr  21 the best-
t HOD parameters are Mmin  61  1012 h1M M1  47  1013 h1M

Interpreting the Luminosity and Color Dependence of
Galaxy Clustering
In general these HOD parameters reect the eciency of galaxy formation and
evolution and can be a function of galaxy properties such as luminosity color
stellar mass and morphology Zehavi et al 2011 present HOD ts to SDSS
samples as a function of luminosity and color and nd that  is generally 10-
11 though it is a bit higher for the brightest galaxies 13 for Mr  220
There is a strong trend between luminosity and halo mass Mmin varies as a
function of luminosity from  1011 h1M for Mr  18 to  1014 h1M
for Mr  22 M1 is generally 17 times higher than the value of Mmin for all
luminosity threshold samples see Fig 12 This implies that a halo with two
galaxies above a given luminosity is 17 times more massive than a halo hosting
one galaxy above the same luminosity limit Further the fraction of galaxies
that are satellites decreases at higher luminosities from 33 at Mr  18 to
4 at Mr  22 The right panel of Fig 12 shows the mass-to-light ratio of the
virial halo mass to the central galaxy r-band luminosity as a function of halo
mass This gure shows that halos of mass  4  1011 h1M are maximally
ecient at galaxy formation at converting baryons into light
In terms of the color dependence of galaxy clustering the trend at fainter
luminosities of red galaxies being strongly clustered with a higher correlation
slope  see Fig 8 is due to faint red galaxies being satellite galaxies in rela-
tively massive halos that host bright red central galaxies Berlind et al 2005
HOD modeling therefore provides a clear explanation for the increased clustering
observed for faint red galaxies For a given luminosity range 20  Mr  19
Zehavi et al 2011 t a simplied HOD model with one parameter only to nd
that the fraction of galaxies that are satellites is much higher for red than for
blue galaxies with 25 of blue galaxies being satellites and 60 of red
galaxies being satellites They nd that blue galaxies reside in halos with a
median mass of 10117 h1M while red galaxies reside in higher mass halos
with a median mass of 10122 h1M However at a given luminosity there is
not a strong trend between color and halo mass though there is a strong trend
between luminosity and halo mass Instead the dierences in wprp reect a
trend between color and satellite fraction the increased satellite fraction in par-
ticular drives the slope of r to be steeper for red galaxies compared to blue
galaxies And while the HOD slope  does not change much with increasing
luminosity it does with color due to the dependence of the satellite fraction on
color Having a higher satellite fraction also places more galaxies in high mass
halos as those host the groups and clusters that contain the satellite galaxies
which increases the large scale bias and boosts the one halo term relative to the
two halo term The HOD model facilitates interpretion of the observed lumi-
nosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering and provides strong crucial
constraints on models of how galaxies form and evolve within their parent dark
matter halos
Interpreting the Evolution of Galaxy Clustering
As mentioned in Section 7 above the galaxies that are observed for clustering
measurements at dierent redshifts are not necessarily the same populations
across cosmic time A signicant hurdle in understanding galaxy evolution is
knowing how to connect dierent observed populations at dierent redshifts
Galaxy clustering measurements can be combined with theoretical models to
trace observed populations with redshift in that for a given cosmology one can
model how the clustering of a given population should evolve with time
The observed evolution of the luminosity-dependence of galaxy clustering
can be t surprisingly well using a simple non-parametric non-HOD model that
relates the galaxy luminosity function to the halo mass function Conroy et al
2006 show that directly matching galaxies as a function of luminosity to host
halos and subhalos as a function of mass leads to a model for the luminosity-
dependent clustering that matches observation from z  0 to z  3 In this
model the only inputs are the observed galaxy luminosity function at each
epoch of interest and the dark matter halo and subhalo mass function from
N-body simulations Galaxies are then ranked by luminosity and halos by mass
and matched one-to-one such that lower luminosity galaxies are associated with
halos of lower mass and galaxies above a given luminosity threshold are assigned
to halos above a given mass threshold with the same abundance or number
density This abundance matching method uses as a proxy for halo mass the
maximum circular velocity Vmax of the halo for subhalos they nd that it
is necessary to use the value of Vmax when the subhalo is rst accreted into
a larger halo to avoid the eects of tidal stripping With this simple model
the clustering amplitude and shape as a function of luminosity are matched for
SDSS galaxies at z  0 DEEP2 galaxies at z  1 and Lyman break galaxies
at z  3 In particular the clustering amplitude in both the one and two halo
regimes is well t including the deviations from a power law that seen at z  1
Ouchi et al 2005 Coil et al 2006 These results imply a tight correlation
between galaxy luminosity and halo mass from z  0 to z  3
While abundance-matching techniques provide a simple zero parameter
model for how galaxies populate halos a richer understanding of the physical
properties involved may be gained by performing HOD modeling Zheng et al
2007 use HOD modeling to t the observed luminosity-dependent galaxy clus-
tering at z  0 measured in SDSS with that measured at z  1 in DEEP2 to
conrm that at both epochs there is a tight relationship between the central
galaxy luminosity and host halo mass At z  1 the satellite fraction drops for
higher luminosities as at z  0 but at a given luminosity the satellite fraction is
higher at z  0 than at z  1 They also nd that at a given central luminosity
halos are 16 times more massive at z  0 than z  1 and at a given halo
mass galaxies are 14 times more luminous at z  1 than z  0
Zheng et al 2007 further combine these HOD results with theoretical pre-
dictions of the growth of dark matter halos from simulations to link z  1 central
galaxies to their descendants at z  0 and nd that the growth of both halo
mass and stellar mass as a function of redshift depends on halo mass Lower
mass halos grow earlier which is reected in the fact that more of their z  0
mass is already assembled by z  1 A typical z  0 halo with mass 3  1011
h1M has about 70 of its nal mass in place by z  1 while a z  0 halo
with mass 1013 h1M has 50 of its nal mass in place at z  1 In terms of
stellar mass however in a z  0 halo of mass 5  1011 h1M a central galaxy
has 20 of its stellar mass in place at z  1 while the fraction rises to 33
above a halo mass of 2  1012 h1M They further nd that the mass scale of
the maximum star formation eciency for central galaxies shifts to lower halo
mass with time with a peak of  1012 h1M at z  1 and  61011 h1Mat
z  0
At 1  z  2 Wake et al 2011 use precise photometric redshifts from the
NEWFIRM survey to measure the relationship between stellar mass and dark
matter halo mass using HOD models At these higher redshifts r0 varies from
6 to 11 h1 Mpc for stellar masses  1010 M to 1011 M The galaxy bias is
a function of both redshift and stellar mass and is 25 at z  1 and increases
to 35 at z  2 They nd that the typical halo mass of both central and
satellite galaxies increases with stellar mass while the satellite fraction drops
at higher stellar mass qualitatively similar to what is found at lower redshift
They do not nd evolution in the relationship between stellar mass and halo
mass between z  2 and z  1 but do nd evolution compared to z  0 They
also nd that the peak of star formation eciency shifts to lower halo mass with
Simulations can also be used to connect dierent observed galaxy popula-
tions at dierent redshifts An example of the power of this method is shown
by Conroy et al 2008 who compare the clustering and space density of star
forming galaxies at z  2 with that of star forming and quiescent galaxies at
z  1 and z  0 to infer both the typical descendants of the z  2 star forming
galaxies and constrain the fraction that have merged with other galaxies by
z  0 They use halos and subhalos identied in a CDM N-body simulation
to determine which halos at z  2 likely host star forming galaxies and then use
the merger histories in the simulation to track these same halos to lower red-
shift By comparing these results to observed clustering of star forming galaxies
at z  1 and z  0 they can identify the galaxy populations at these epochs
that are consistent with being descendants of the z  2 galaxies They nd that
while the lower redshift descendent halos have clustering strengths similar to
red galaxies at both z  1 and z  0 the z  2 star forming galaxies can not
all evolve into red galaxies by lower redshift as their space density is too high
There are many more lower redshift descendents than there are red galaxies
even after taking into account mergers They conclude that most z  2 star
forming galaxies evolve into typical L galaxies today while a non-negligible
fraction become satellite galaxies in larger galaxy groups and clusters
In summary N-body simulations and HOD modeling can be used to interpret
the observed evolution of galaxy clustering and further constrain both cosmo-
logical parameters and theoretical models of galaxy evolution beyond what can
be gleaned from z  0 observations alone They also establish links between dis-
tinct observed galaxy populations at dierent redshifts allowing one to create
a coherent picture of how galaxies evolve over cosmic time
9 Voids and Filaments
Redshift surveys unveil a rich structure of galaxies as seen in Fig 3 In addi-
tion to measuring the two-point correlation function to quantify the clustering
amplitude as a function of galaxy properties one can also study higher-order
clustering measurements as well as properties of voids and laments
91 Higher-order Clustering Measurements
Higher-order clustering statistics reect both the growth of initial density uc-
tuations as well as the details of galaxy biasing Bernardeau et al 2002 such
that measurements of higher-order clustering can test the paradigm of structure
formation through gravitational instability as well as constrain the galaxy bias
In the linear regime there is a degeneracy between the amplitude of uctuations
in the dark matter density eld and the galaxy bias in that a highly clustered
galaxy population may be biased and trace only the most overdense regions
of the dark matter or the dark matter itself may be highly clustered How-
ever this degeneracy can be broken in the non-linear regime on small scales
Over time the density eld becomes skewed towards high density as  becomes
greater than unity in overdense regions where      1  but can not
become negative in underdense regions Skewness in the galaxy density dis-
tribution can also arise from galaxy bias if galaxies preferentially form in the
highest density peaks One can therefore use the shapes of the galaxy over-
densities through measurements of the three-point correlation function to test
gravitational collapse versus galaxy bias
To study higher-order clustering one needs large samples that cover enor-
mous volumes all studies to date have focused on low redshift galaxies Verde et al
2002 use 2dFGRS to measure the Fourier transform of the three-point corre-
lation function called the bispectrum to constrain the galaxy bias without
resorting to comparisons with N-body simulations in order to measure the clus-
tering of dark matter Fry  Gaztanaga 1993 present the galaxy bias in terms
of a Taylor expansion of the density contrast where the rst order term is the
linear term while the second order term is the non-linear or quadratic term
Measured on scales of 5  30 h1 Mpc Verde et al 2002 nd that the linear
galaxy bias is consistent with unity b1  104  011 while the non-linear
quadratic bias is consistent with zero b2  005  008 When combined
with the redshift space distortions measured in the two-dimensional two-point
correlation function rp  they measure matter  027  006 at z  017
This constraint on the matter density of the Universe is derived entirely from
large scale structure data alone
Gaztanaga et al 2005 measure the three-point correlation function in 2dF-
GRS for triangles of galaxy congurations with dierent shapes Their results
are consistent with CDM expectations regarding gravitational instability of
initial Gaussian uctuations Furthermore they nd that while the linear bias
is consistent with unity b1  093  010 008 the quadratic bias is non-zero
b2b1  034011008 This implies that there is a non-gravitational con-
tribution to the three-point function resulting from galaxy formation physics
These results dier from those of Verde et al 2002 which may be due to the
inclusion by Gaztanaga et al 2005 of the covariance between measurements
on dierent scales Gaztanaga et al 2005 combine their results with the mea-
sured two-point correlation function to derive 8  088  012  010
If the density eld follows a Gaussian distribution the higher-order cluster-
ing terms can be expressed solely in terms of the lower order clustering terms
This hierarchical scaling holds for the evolution of an initially Gaussian distri-
bution of uctuations under gravitational instability Therefore departures from
hierarchical scaling can result either from a non-Gaussian initial density eld
or from galaxy bias Redshift space higher-order clustering measurements in
2dFGRS are performed by Baugh et al 2004 and Croton et al 2004a who
measure up to the six-point correlation function They nd that hierarchical
scaling is obeyed on small scales though deviations exist on larger scales  10
h1 Mpc They show that on large scales the higher-order terms can be sig-
nicantly aected by massive rare peaks such as superclusters which populate
the tail of the overdensity distribution Croton et al 2004a also show that the
three-point function has a weak luminosity dependence implying that galaxy
bias is not entirely linear These results are conrmed by Nichol et al 2006
using galaxies in the SDSS who also measure a weak luminosity dependence in
the three-point function They nd that on scales 10 h1 Mpc the three-point
function is greatly aected by the Sloan Great Wall a massive supercluster
that is roughly 450 Mpc Gott et al 2005 in length and is associated with tens
of known Abell clusters These results show that even 2dFGRS and SDSS are
not large enough samples to be unaected by the most massive rare structures
Several studies have examined higher-order correlation functions for galaxies
split by color Gaztanaga et al 2005 nd a strong dependence of the three-
point function on color and luminosity on scales 6 h1 Mpc Croton et al
2007 measure up to the ve-point correlation function in 2dFGRS for both blue
and red galaxies and nd that red galaxies are more clustered than blue galaxies
in all of the N-point functions measured They also nd a luminosity-dependence
in the hierarchical scaling amplitudes for red galaxies but not for blue galaxies
Taken together these results explain why the full galaxy population shows only
a weak correlation with luminosity
92 Voids
In maps of the large scale structure of galaxies voids stand out starkly to the
eye There appear to be vast regions of space with few if any L galaxies Voids
are among the largest structures observed in the Universe spanning typically
tens of h1 Mpc
The statistics of voids  their sizes distribution and underdensities  are
closely tied to cosmological parameters and the physical details of structure for-
mation eg Sheth  van de Weygaert 2004 While the two-point correlation
function provides a full description of clustering for a Gaussian distribution de-
partures from Gaussianity can be tested with higher-order correlation statistics
and voids For example the abundance of voids can be used to test the non-
Gaussianity of primordial perturbations which constrains models of ination
Kamionkowski et al 2009 Additionally voids provide an extreme low den-
sity environment in which to study galaxy evolution As discussed by Peebles
2001 the lack of galaxies in voids should provide a stringent test for galaxy
formation models
921 Void and Void Galaxy Properties
The rst challenge in measuring the properties of voids and void galaxies is
dening the physical extent of individual voids and identifying which galaxies
are likely to be in voids The void nder algorithm of El-Ad  Piran 1997
which is based on the point distribution of galaxies ie does not perform any
smoothing is widely used This algorithm does not assume that voids are
entirely devoid of galaxies and identies void galaxies as those with three or
less neighboring galaxies within a sphere dened by the mean and standard
deviation of the distance to the third nearest neighbor for all galaxies All other
galaxies are termed wall galaxies An individual void is then identied as the
maximal sphere that contains only void galaxies see Fig 10 This algorithm
is widely used by both theorists and observers
x h-1 Mpc
Figure 13 Void and wall galaxies in the SDSS Shown is a projection of a 10 h1
Mpc slab with wall galaxies plotted as black crosses and void galaxies plotted
as red crosses Blue circles indicate the intersection of the maximal sphere of
each void with the midplane of the slab from Pan et al 2011
Cosmological simulations of structure formation show that the distribu-
tion and density of galaxy voids are sensitive to the values of matter and
 Kaumann et al 1999 Using CDM N-body dark matter simulations
Colberg et al 2005 study the properties of voids within the dark matter dis-
tribution and predicts that voids are very underdense though not empty up
to a well-dened sharp edge in the dark matter density They predict that 61
of the volume of space should be lled by voids at z  0 compared to 28 at
z  1 and 9 at z  2 They also nd that the mass function of dark matter
halos in voids is steeper than in denser regions of space
Using similar CDM N-body simulations with a semi-analytic model for
galaxy evolution Benson et al 2003 show that voids should contain both dark
matter and galaxies and that the dark matter halos in voids tend to be low
mass and therefore contain fewer galaxies than in higher density regions
particular at density contrasts of   06 where   mean 1 both dark
matter halos and galaxies in voids should be anti-biased relative to dark matter
However galaxies are predicted to be more underdense than the dark matter
halos assuming simple physically-motivate prescriptions for galaxy evolution
They also predict the statistical size distribution of voids nding that there
should be more voids with smaller radii  10h1 Mpc than larger radii
The advent of the 2dFGRS and SDSS provided the rst very large samples
of voids and void galaxies that could be used to robustly measure their statis-
tical properties Applying the void nder algorithm on the 2dFGRS dataset
Hoyle  Vogeley 2004 nd that the typical radius of voids is 15 h1 Mpc
Voids are extremely underdense with an average density of -094 with
even lower densities at the center where fewer galaxies lie The volume of space
lled by voids is 40 Probing an even larger volume of space using the SDSS
dataset Pan et al 2011 nd a similar typical void radius and conclude that
60 of space is lled by voids which have -085 at their edges Voids
have sharp density proles in that they remain extremely underdense to the
void radius where the galaxy density rises steeply These observational results
agree well with the predictions of CDM simulations discussed above
Studies of the properties of galaxy in voids allow an understanding of how
galaxy formation and evolution progresses in the lowest density environments
in the Universe eectively pursuing the other end of the density spectrum from
cluster galaxies Void galaxies are found to be signicantly bluer and fainter
than wall galaxies Rojas et al 2004 The luminosity function of void galaxies
shows a lack of bright galaxies but no dierence in the measured faint end
slope Croton et al 2005 Hoyle et al 2005 indicating that dwarf galaxies
are not likely to be more common in voids The normalization of the luminosity
function of wall galaxies is roughly an order of magnitude higher than that of
void galaxies therefore galaxies do exist in voids just with a much lower space
density Studies of the optical spectra of void galaxies show that they have
high star formation rates low 4000A spectral breaks indicative of young stellar
populations and low stellar masses resulting in high specic star formation
rates Rojas et al 2005
However red quiescent galaxies do exist in voids just with a lower space
density than blue star forming galaxies Croton et al 2005 Croton  Farrar
2008 show that the observed luminosity function of void galaxies can be repli-
cated with a CDM N-body simulation and simple semi-analytic prescriptions
for galaxy evolution They explain the existence of red galaxies in voids as re-
siding in the few massive dark matter halos that exist in voids Their model
requires some form of star formation quenching in massive halos  1012 M
but no additional physics that operates only at low density needs to be included
in their model to match the data
It is therefore the shift in the halo mass
function in voids that leads to dierent galaxy properties not a change in the
galaxy evolution physics in low density environments
922 Void Probability Function
In addition to identifying individual voids and the galaxies in them one can
study the statistical distribution of voids using the void probability function
VPF Dened by White 1979 the VPF is the probability that a randomly
placed sphere of radius R within a point distribution will not contain any points
ie galaxies see Figure 11 The VPF is dened such that it depends on the
space density of points therefore one must be careful when comparing datasets
and simulation results to ensure that the same number density is used The VPF
traces clustering in the weakly non-linear regime not in the highly non-linear
regime of galaxy groups and clusters
Benson et al 2003 predict using CDM simulations that the VPF of galax-
ies should be higher than that of dark matter that voids as traced by galaxies
Figure 14 A schematic of the void probability function VPF The top panel
shows the comoving distribution of galaxies in a small portion of the DEEP2
survey projected through 10 h1 Mpc while the lower panel shows a fraction
of the empty spheres identied with a radius of 6 h1 Mpc in the same vol-
ume from Conroy et al 2005 Because the gure is projected through one
dimension it may appear that galaxies reside inside of identied voids in three
dimensions the voids contain no galaxies
are much larger than voids traced by dark matter This results from the bias of
galaxies compared to dark matter in voids and the fact that in this model the
few dark matter halos that do exist in voids are low mass and therefore often
do not contain bright galaxies Croton et al 2004b measure the VPF in the
2dFGRS dataset and nd that it follows hierarchical scaling laws in that all
higher-order correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the two-point
correlation function They nd that even on scales of 30 h1 Mpc higher-
order correlations have an impact and that the VPF of galaxies is observed to
be dierent than that of dark matter in simulations
Conroy et al 2005 measure the VPF in SDSS galaxies at z  01 and
DEEP2 galaxies at z  1 and nd that voids traced by redder andor brighter
galaxy populations are larger than voids traced by bluer andor fainter galaxies
They also nd that voids are larger in comoving coordinates at z  01 than at
z  1 ie voids grow over time as expected They show that the dierences
observed in the VPF as traced by dierent galaxy populations are entirely con-
sistent with dierences observed in the two-point correlation function and space
density of these galaxy populations This implies that there does not appear
to be additional higher-order information in voids than in the two-point func-
tion alone They also nd excellent agreement with predictions from CDM
simulations that include semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution
Tinker et al 2008 interpret the observed VPF in galaxy surveys in terms
of the halo model see Section 8 above They compare the observed VPF in
2dFGRS and SDSS to halo model predictions constrained to match the two-
point correlation function and number density of galaxies using a model in
which the dark matter halo occupation depends on mass only They nd that
with this model they can match the observed data very well implying that
there is no need for the suppression of galaxy formation in voids ie galaxy
formation does not proceed dierently in low-density regions They nd that
the sizes and emptiness of voids show excellent agreement with predictions of
CDM models for galaxies at low redshift to luminosities of L  02L
93 Filaments
Galaxy laments  long strings of galaxies  are the largest systems seen in
maps of large scale structure and as such provide a key test of theories of
structure formation Aragon-Calvo et al 2010 show that in simulations while
laments occupy only  10 of the volume of space they account for 40 of
the mass content of the z  0 Universe Measuring the typical and maximal
length of laments as well as their thickness and average density therefore
constrains theoretical models Various statistical methods have been proposed
to identify and characterize the morphologies and properties of laments eg
Sousbie et al 2008 and references therein
In terms of their sizes the largest length scale at which laments are sta-
tistically signicant and hence identied as real objects is 50-80 h1 Mpc ac-
cording to an analysis of galaxies in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey LCRS
Shectman et al 1996 by Bharadwaj et al 2004 They show that while there
Figure 15 Filaments identied in the SDSS galaxy distribution from Sousbie et
al 2008 Individual laments are shown in green overlaid on the galaxy density
eld show in purple The Sloan Great Wall is identied in the foreground lying
between the red arrows
appear to be laments in the survey on longer scales these arise from chance
alignments and projection eects and are not real structures Sousbie et al
2008 identify and study the length of laments in SDSS by identifying ridges
in the galaxy distribution using the Hessian matrix 2xixj and its eigen-
values see Fig 12 They nd excellent agreement between observations and
CDM numerical predictions for a at low matter Universe They argue that
lament measurements are not highly sensitive to observational eects such as
redshift space distortions edge eects incompleteness or galaxy bias which
makes them a robust test of theoretical models
Bond et al 2010 use the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix of the smoothed
galaxy distribution to identify laments in both SDSS data and CDM simula-
tions and nd that the distribution of laments lengths is roughly exponential
with many more laments of length 10 h1 Mpc than  20 h1 Mpc They
nd that the lament width distribution agrees between the SDSS data and N-
body simulations The mean lament width depends on the smoothing length
for smoothing scales of 10 and h1 Mpc the mean lament widths are 55 and
84 h1 Mpc In CDM simulations they nd that the lamentary structure
in the dark matter density distribution is in place by z  3 tracing a similar
pattern of density ridges This is in contrast to what is found for voids which
become much more prominent and low-density at later cosmic epochs
Choi et al 2010 use the methods of Bond et al 2010 to study the evo-
lution of lamentary structure from z  08 to z  01 using galaxies from the
DEEP2 survey and the SDSS They nd that neither the space density of la-
ments nor the distribution of lament lengths has changed signicantly over the
last seven Gyr of cosmic time in agreement with CDM numerical predictions
The distribution of lament widths has changed however in that the distribu-
tion is broader at lower redshift and has a smaller typical width This observed
evolution in the lament width distribution naturally results from non-linear
growth of structure and is consistent with the results on voids discussed above
in that over time voids grow larger while laments become tighter ie have a
smaller typical width though not necessarily longer
10 Summary and Future
This overview of our current understanding of the large-scale structure of the
Universe has shown that quantitative measurements of the clustering and spa-
tial distribution of galaxies have wide applications and implications The non-
uniform structure reveals properties of both the galaxies and the dark matter
halos that comprise this large-scale structure Statistics such as the two-point
correlation function can be used not only to constrain cosmological parameters
but also to understand galaxy formation and evolution processes The advent
of extremely large redshift surveys with samples of hundreds of thousands of
galaxies has led to very precise measurements of the clustering of galaxies at
z  01 as a function of various galaxy properties such as luminosity color and
stellar mass inuencing our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve
Initial studies at higher redshift have revealed that many of the general cor-
relations that are observed between galaxy properties and clustering at z  0
were in place when the Universe was a fraction of its current age As larger
redshift surveys are carried out at higher redshifts much more can be learned
about how galaxy populations change with time Theoretical interpretations of
galaxy clustering measurements such as the halo occupation distribution model
have also recently made great strides in terms of statistically linking various
properties of galaxies with those of their host dark matter halos Such studies
reveal not only how light traces mass on large scales but how baryonic mass and
dark matter co-evolve with cosmic time
There are many exciting future directions for studies of galaxy clustering
and large-scale structure Precise cosmological constraints can be obtained using
baryon acoustic oscillation signatures observed in clustering measurements from
wide-area surveys Eisenstein et al 2005 Specic galaxy populations can be
understood in greater detail by comparing their clustering properties with those
of galaxies in general For example the clustering of dierent types of active
galactic nuclei AGN can be used to constrain the AGN fueling mechanisms
lifetimes and host galaxy populations Coil et al 2009 As discussed above
measurements of galaxy clustering have the power to place strong constraints
on contemporary models of galaxy formation and evolution and advance our
understanding of how galaxies populate and evolve within dark matter halos
