Abstract We investigate the old stellar populations of the 3CR radio galaxies at red-
shift z  1 using observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope and the United
 35 kpc the infrared radial intensity proles
Kingdom InfraRed Telescope At radii r 
of the galaxies follow de Vaucouleurs law whilst at larger radii the galaxies show an
excess of emission similar to that of low redshift cD galaxies The locus of the high
redshift 3CR galaxies on the Kormendy relation is investigated passive evolution of
the stellar populations is required to account for their oset from the relation dened
by low redshift giant ellipticals and brightest cluster galaxies The 3CR galaxies on
average possess larger characteristic radii than the low redshift brightest cluster galax-
ies Coupled with existing evidence these results are strongly suggestive that distant
3CR galaxies must be highly evolved systems even at a redshift of one and lie at the
centre of moderate to rich protoclusters
1 Introduction
The revised 3CR sample of radio sources dened by Laing et al 1983 consists
of the brightest radio sources in the northern sky selected at 178 MHz It con-
tains radio galaxies and quasars out to redshifts z  2 The low redshift radio
galaxies in the sample have long been known to be associated with giant el-
liptical galaxies containing old stellar populations if the high redshift sources
are similarly associated with giant ellipticals then these sources provide an ideal
opportunity to study the evolution of stellar populations at early cosmic epoch
and thus to constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution
Following the advent of infrared bolometers Lilly and Longair 19821984
obtained infrared Kmagnitudes for an almost complete sample of 83 3CR galax-
ies with redshifts 0  z  16 Plotting K magnitude against redshift for these
objects they showed that the resulting relation has a remarkably small scatter
 06 magnitudes The tightness of this correlation was interpreted as indicat-
ing that the high redshift 3CR host galaxies are also giant elliptical galaxies Lilly
and Longair 1984 showed that unless the deceleration parameter is as large as
q0  35 the shape of the Kz relationship is not consistent with nonevolving
stellar populations but that at least passive evolution is required
The opticalultraviolet morphologies of the distant galaxies are however
far more complicated In 1987 McCarthy et al and Chambers et al discovered
that the optical emission of powerful high redshift radio galaxies tends to be

elongated and aligned along the direction of the radio emission Our HST images
have allowed us to study the morphologies of these galaxies on kpc scales and
demonstrate that the form of the alignment diers greatly from source to source
Longair et al 1995 Best et al 19961997b in some cases it arises from the
elongation of a single central emission region whilst in others strings of bright
knots are seen to stretch along the radio axis The most promising models for
this aligned emission are star formation induced by the radio jet scattering of
quasar light by dust or electrons or nebular emission from the warm ionised gas
eg Rottgering and Miley 1996
2 Spectral energy distributions
The critical point about all of the mechanisms for producing the aligned emission
is that they possess relatively at spectra and so at the longer wavelengths of
the infrared emission they are dominated by the emission of the underlying old
stellar population
To estimate the fraction of the Kband ux density that would arise from the
aligned emission we produce a relatively simple model for the spectral energy
distributions SEDs of the galaxies using a combination of two components
i a passively evolving old stellar population and ii a at spectrum f   0
emission component representing the aligned emission The SED of the rst
component was derived using the stellar synthesis codes of Bruzual and Charlot
19931997 assuming that the stars formed in a 1 Gyr burst beginning at a
redshift z  10 A Scalo IMF with upper and lower mass cutos of 01 and
65M was adopted The precise spectral shape of the second component of the
t depends upon the nature of the alignment eect the adoption of a at spectral
index provides a good compromise and will not be too far wrong in any case
For each galaxy we calculate the sum of these two components which best
matches the broad band ux densities of the galaxies measured at four dierent
wavelengths from our UKIRT and HST images taking account of any emission
line contributions Best et al 1997a 3C437 and 3C470 for which only two
broad band ux densities were available and 3C22 and 3C41 which both possess
strong nuclear components in the infrared images see Section 3 were omitted
from this analysis The ts obtained are generally good To illustrate this in
Figure 1 we show the results for the rst half of the sample These indicate that
the simple two component model provides a good representation of the SEDs of
these galaxies The percentage of Kband light associated with the at spectrum
component ranges from only  1 in the very passive sources 3C65 and 3C337
up to  22 in the case of 3C368 with an mean value of  8 Although these
percentages would be higher if a redder spectral shape had been adopted for the
aligned component the assumption that the Kband light is dominated by the
old stellar population seems reasonably secure

3 Radial intensity proles
Our observations can be used to compare the radial intensity proles of these
galaxies with de Vaucouleurs law Ir  exph767 rre14i For 8 of the
galaxies in the sample there is little evidence for a signicant ultraviolet emission
component in the sense that only a small  5Jy at spectrum component is
required in the t to their SED and the morphologies of the HST images are
almost symmetrical For these galaxies the radial proles of the optical emission
were measured with nearby companions objects being removed and replaced
by the average of the background pixels at that distance from the centre of
the galaxy The radial proles are shown in Figure 2 in 6 of the 8 cases a de
Vaucouleurs prole provides an excellent match to the observed data The cases

3CR radio galaxies which do not show a signicant active ultraviolet component The
characteristic radius of each determined from the gradient of the best tting straight
line is given
of 3C22 and 3C41 are discussed below The values of the characteristic radius
can typically be measured to an accuracy of order 15
Using the characteristic radii determined from the HST images the infrared
proles of these galaxies can also be investigated For each of the galaxies a
de Vaucouleurs prole with the characteristic radius derived from the HST t
and an unresolved emission source were each convolved with eects of the see-
ing which was typically between 1 and 12 arcsec The combination of these
two components which provided the best match to the observed data was then
determined in each case the results being shown in Figure 3 the dashed line
shows the radial prole of the de Vaucouleurs component the dotted line shows
that of the point source component and the solid line shows the total intensity
prole note that in many cases the best t was produced using no point source
component and so this does not appear on the plot In each case a good match
is obtained
Such ts could also be made for the remaining galaxies in the sample for
which no de Vaucouleurs t to the HST data was possible due to the aligned
emission For these galaxies the characteristic radius was allowed to be a further

galaxies shown in Figure 2 using the sum of an unresolved point source dashdot
line and a de Vaucouleurs prole with the characteristic radius determined from the
HST images dashed line For each of the proles the eect of seeing has been taken
into account The sum of the two components is indicated by the solid line Note that
in many cases the best t does not involve a point source component
free parameter in the t For the ve galaxies with redshifts z  14 the low
signaltonoise ratio of the infrared images meant that the 2 of the t varied
only slowly with characteristic radius and so the besttting characteristic ra-
dius was not welldened these galaxies have therefore been omitted from the
analysis For the remaining galaxies the characteristic radius could typically be
determined to an accuracy of  35 and the best tting models are shown in
Figure 4
Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate that except for the two cases of 3C22 and 3C41
there is only a small  10 point source component contributing to the total
Kband ux density of the 3CR radio galaxies Indeed the point source contri-
bution is consistent within the 90 condence limits with being zero in all but
these two cases For 3C22 and 3C41 approximately 37 and 24 respectively
of the Kband emission is associated with an unresolved emission source It is
interesting to note that these two galaxies are the brightest in our sample in
the Kband lying furthest from the mean Kz relationship Best et al 1997a

The characteristic radii have been determined from the best tting proles The same
notation is used as in Figure 3
Rawlings et al 1995 have previously proposed that 3C22 possesses a signi-
cant unresolved Kband contribution and together the detection of broad H
emission Economou et al 1995 from this galaxy this suggests that this source
may be a reddened quasar

It is noticeable that for a proportion of the galaxies the observed emission
prole becomes brighter than the predicted de Vaucouleurs prole at large radii
suggesting that these galaxies possess diuse extended envelopes To improve
the signaltonoise of this feature we have scaled the radial prole of each
galaxy with respect to the characteristic radius derived for it and summed the
intensity proles Only those galaxies for which 10  re  20 were included
for galaxies with a smaller re there will still be a signicant eect due to the
seeing at radii of 2 to 3 re whilst for galaxies with a larger re there is insucient
signal at the largest radii to accurately test for the presence of the halo For
the 12 galaxies which meet this criteria the scaled radial proles were summed
weighting each galaxy equally and the results are presented in Figure 5 At radii
rre14
 125 corresponding to r  35 kpc there is a clearly signicant halo
component
This halo component is very similar to that of low redshift cD galaxies which
lie towards the centre of galaxy clusters Together with the large a few times
1011M masses of these galaxies this suggests that high redshift 3CR galax-
ies may live in moderately rich environments Existing evidence supports this
hypothesis eg the detection of cooling ows around these galaxies Crawford
and Fabian 1995 evidence for companion galaxies in narrowband OII images
McCarthy 1988 and the fact that individual wellstudied 3CR galaxies at high
redshift appear to live in clusters eg 3C324 Dickinson et al 1996

4 The Kormendy relation for the redshift one 3CR radio
galaxies
The Kormendy re vs e projection of the fundamental plane alleviates the need
for detailed spectroscopy which is a dicult process for high redshift galaxies
In the previous section we obtained good estimates for the characteristic radii of
the 3CR galaxies by measuring also their surface brightnesses it will be possible
to compare their location on the Kormendy projection with those of low redshift
brightest cluster galaxies and giant ellipticals Thus we can investigate how
much evolution of the stellar populations must be occurring with cosmic epoch
There are a number of details which need to be dealt with before the lo-
cation of the 3CR galaxies on the Kormendy relation can be determined The
foremost of these is that we can not use the HST images to measure the surface
brightnesses because of the large component of light associated with the aligned
emission at these wavelengths Instead the Kband images must be used with
the adoption of an appropriate kcorrection We must also take account of the
eects of seeing in the Kband observations of any point source or at spec-
trum contributions to the ux density as calculated in the earlier sections of
this paper and compensate for cosmological surface brightness dimming
As a rst null hypothesis we assume that the stellar populations of the
3CR radio galaxies are not evolving and so we use the SED of low redshift
giant elliptical galaxies to calculate the required kcorrection The restframe B
band surface brightnesses thus calculated for the 3CR radio galaxies are plotted
against the measured de Vaucouleurs radii in Figure 6a together with data from
low redshift samples of giant ellipticals and brightest cluster galaxies Oegerle
and Hoessel 1991 Schombert 1987 and a sample of low redshift radio galaxies
Lilly and Prestage 1987 The 3CR galaxies have greater surface brightnesses
than the low redshift galaxies in the fundamental plane implying that some
stellar evolution must have occurred between a redshift of one and the current
We can repeat the process but instead make the more physical assumption
that the stellar populations of the 3CR radio galaxies form at high redshift
z  10 and then evolve passively If evolution is occurring the stellar popu-
lations observed in the high redshift radio galaxies will be younger and hence
brighter than those seen in the nearby galaxies The Bruzual and Charlot 1993
1997 stellar synthesis codes were used to construct such passively evolving galax-
ies with the age that each 3CR galaxy would possess and thus to calculate the
required kcorrection The models were then used to determine the evolution
in the restframe Bmagnitude of the stellar populations that would occur for
each galaxy between its observed redshift and a redshift of zero This proce-
dure therefore derived surface brightnesses of the 3CR galaxies that could be
compared directly with low redshift giant ellipticals in the fundamental plane
The derived surface brightnesses are plotted against the de Vaucouleurs ra-
dius in Figure 6b It can be seen that they lie along the fundamental plane
dened by the low redshift giant ellipticals providing further evidence that the

crosses and low redshift radio galaxies open squares The low redshift data are
taken from Rigler and Lilly 1994 and references therein The ellipse indicates the
error ellipse for the 3CR galaxies whose characteristic radius was measured from the
UKIRT data those for which the measurement was from the HST data have much
an error ellipse less than half of this size a Assuming no evolution of the stellar
populations of the 3CR galaxies b Assuming that the stellar populations evolve
passively The dashed line shows a line of constant total luminosity
stellar populations evolve passively There is an indication that the slope of the
fundamental plane dened by the 3CR galaxies may be slightly steeper than
that of the low redshift giant ellipticals but this is likely to be just a selection
Philip Best Malcolm Longair and Huub Rottgering
eect the dashed line on Figure 6b shows a line of constant total luminosity for
the galaxies that is a line along which the product of the surface brightness and
the square of the characteristic radius is constant the 3CR galaxies lie closely
along this line That is they lie within the fundamental plane and also along
the line of constant luminosity
According to standard cannibalism models eg Hausman and Ostriker 1978
the position of a galaxy along the fundamental plane is interpreted as being
related to its merger history Galaxies which have undergone more mergers and
are more highly evolved lie further to the right along the fundamental plane In
this respect it is interesting to note that i on Figure 6 the high redshift 3CR
galaxies possess a smaller spread of characteristic radii than those of the low
redshift samples indicating perhaps that these galaxies are all seen at a similar
point in their evolutionary history and ii the mean characteristic radius of
the 3CR galaxies 146  14 kpc is larger than that of the low redshift samples
110  05 kpc The indicates that the 3CR galaxies must be highly evolved
systems even by a redshift of one
5 Conclusions
From our study of the high redshift 3CR radio galaxies we conclude the following
points
 The radial intensity proles of the host galaxies of the 3CR radio sources
are well matched by de Vaucouleurs law
 The galaxies possess extended cD type halos
 Passive evolution of the stellar populations is required if the 3CR galaxies are
to lie along the fundamental plane dened by low redshift giant ellipticals
 Their characteristic radii are large with relatively little scatter
We conclude that the 3CR radio galaxies at redshift z  1 are highly evolved
galaxies containing old stellar populations which lie at the centre of moderately
rich protoclusters
