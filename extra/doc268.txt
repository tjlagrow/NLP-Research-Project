are compared with those at z  2  3 LBGs to see evolution of LBGs from z  5
to z  3  2 The LBGs at z  5 are tend to have smaller stellar masses but
they may show large star formation rates and specic star formation rates
Introduction
We have been studying properties of Lyman Break Galaxies LBGs at z  5
 1 Gyr after the Big Bang and before z  3 In this contribution we present
our recent results obtained for z  5 LBGs and possible evolution from z  5
LBGs to z  2  3 LBGs Our sample at z  5 was made in a eld including
the Hubble Deep Field North HDF-N by using the Subaru SCam through V -
IC- and z-lters Since in and around the HDF-N eld many spectroscopic
data were available the color criteria to select the z  5 LBGs can be reliably
examined A sample of z  5 LBGs was chosen from galaxies brighter than
z  265 mag A number of the sample is  600 in an area of  500 arcmin2
2 Luminosity dependent evolution
UV luminosity function is presented by Iwata et al 2003 2007 2008 this vol-
ume In their results from z  5 to  3 a number of faint LBGs fainter than
L is increasing with redshift while in the brighter part the number does not
change signicantly Although there is a controversy on this result a luminosity
dependent evolution of UV luminosity function is indicated
Spectroscopic follow-up observations of a part of our LBG sample were made
by Ando et al 2004 They found that UV luminous LBGs brighter than L
do not show large equivalent width of Ly emission line Ando et al 2006
showed this trend together with other LBGs as well as Ly emitters LAEs
This may be due to the dusty environment or the presence of more massive HI
gas in the luminous LBGs

3 Stellar masses and star formation rates in z  5 LBGs
Using public IRAC data in the GOODS-N region and those obtained in the
anking elds we constructed a z  5 LBG sample with IRAC photometry
From the sample of the LBGs mentioned above we selected the LBGs those
are free from the contamination by neighboring objects by eye inspection The
sample size is  170 about half of them are detected both in IRAC channels
1 and 2 We derived the Spectral Energy Distributions SEDs for the sample
and made SED tting The spectral model adopted for the SED tting we use
is rather traditional because we intend to compare with the results obtained
in the previous studies at z  2  3 stellar synthesis code by Bruzual and
Charlot 2003 with 02 Z the Salpeter IMF 01  100M under constant
star formation history and Calzetti extinction curve Calzetti et al 2000 We
include the H emission line calculated from the model intrinsic star formation
rate and extinction The SED tting method is the essentially the same as that
by Sawicki and Yee 1998 In the tting we xed the redshift to be 48
The resulting stellar masses star formation ages color excess and star
formation rates are presented in Figure 1 left overlayed with those obtained
for z  3 LBGs Shapley et al 2001 and for z  2 LBGs Shapley et al 2005
The rest-frame UV luminosity and optical luminosity of these samples are mostly
overlapped each other The stellar masses of the z  5 LBGs are signicantly
smaller than those at z  2  3 and ages are smaller on average These suggest
the premature nature of the z  5 LBGs Stellar mass function and stellar mass
density at z  5 are presented by Yabe et al 2008 this volume
4 LBGs with large SFRs
As seen from Figure 1 left the star formation rates SFRs are systematically
larger than those in z  2  3 LBGs Figure 1 right shows SFRs against their
stellar masses for z  5 LBGs lled circles The SFRs are very high amounting
to several hundreds M yr1 These values are signicantly larger than those
seen in z  2  3 LBGs shown as open symbols in Figure 1 right They
are also larger compared with the results for z  01  2 star forming galaxies
eg Daddi et al 2007 The specic star formation rates tend to decrease
with decreasing redshift It is suggested that the z  5 LBGs are in active star
forming phase and have dusty environment In fact the color excesses obtained
for the z  5 LBGs tend to be larger than those obtained for z  2  3 LBGs
Figure 1left We may be witnessing an emergence of a population of active
star forming galaxies at z  5
If the z  5 LBGs keep the high SFRs they should have stellar masses
more than 1011M at z  3 The distributions of the expected stellar masses at
z  2  3 are shown as dotted lines in Figure 1left suggesting that the z  5
LBGs are not the progenitor of the z  2  3 LBGs or the large SFRs should
If the SFRs decline exponentially with a time scale of 108 yr SFRs
decline
should be very much small at z  3 Thus the star formation may be episodic if
the z  5 LBGs are the progenitor of z  3 LBGs Or they might be progenitor
of passive massive galaxies at z  2  3

open symbols Solid lines show regression lines for star forming galaxies at
the redshifts shown taken from Daddi et al 2007
However as known well there may be an age-extinction degeneracy in the
SED tting Because we do not have NIR photometric data our SED tting
may suer from the degeneracy To examine this we made SED tting for
LBGs at z  5 sampled by Stark et al 2007 in which J and K photometry
are available We made SED tting with and without J and K data The
resulting output parameters are shown in Figure 2 left The stellar masses are
robust as seen from the gure The SFRs are also rather robust except for a
few extraordinary cases though the error bars are large We also estimated
the color excess using the method by Meurer et al 1995 and found many
of the objects have the color excesses consistent with the SED tting We also
made various tests to see whether the large SFRs are due to some articial
causes Figure 2 right shows output parameters of the SED tting when we
take redshift as a free parameter upper left panel other star formation history
upper right panel metallicity lower left panel and other extinction curves
lower right panel As seen from the panels except for the adoption of other
extinction curves majority of estimated SFRs agree with those obtained in the
ducial model
No LBGs with large SFRs coincide with SCUBA sources Pope et al 2005
X-ray sources Alexander et al 2003 and VLA sources Richards 2000 The
estimated upper limits on SFRs from these surveys are  1500M yr1 It is
worth noting that many of these LBGs with large SFRs do not reside in the
SCUBAChandra surveys Further observations are necessary to denitively
conclude the presence of such population
