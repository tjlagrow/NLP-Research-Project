ABSTRACT
In order to explain the small scale-lengths detected in the recent deep eld
observations performed from large ground-based telescopes and from the Hubble
Space Telescope we investigate the predictions at high redshifts for disk galaxies
that formed by infall Changes with redshift in the observed properties of eld
galaxies are directly related to the evolution of the disks and of the stellar
populations We see that changes in the rest frame luminosity of a galaxy induce
smaller values of half-light radii than are predicted assuming no evolution
Comparisons are presented with two observed samples from Mutz et al 1994
and Smail et al 1995

Introduction
Studies of the faint eld population of galaxies have traditionally been based on
number counts and analyses of redshift distributions Distinguishing Hubble types andor
measuring the morphological characteristics of these galaxies has only become feasible with
the advent of new era telescopes Observations from the largest ground-based telescope
have provided data on the sizes of faint eld galaxies Smail et al1995 while more rened
morphological classication can be achieved using high-resolution observations with the
Hubble Space Telescope Mutz et al 1994 Casertano et al 1995 Driver Windhorst 
Griths 1995 Glazebrook et al 1995 Driver et al 1995 Schade et al 1995 Abraham et
al 1996
At faint magnitudes I  22 and R  26 expected median redshift greater than 05
eg Lilly et al 1995 the dominant eld population consists of very small disk systems
with mean scale-length of  02  03 arcsec Casertano et al 1995 Smail et al 1995 The
corresponding drop in median galaxy size with increasing magnitude and redshift is faster
than predicted by assuming a xed intrinsic angular size of galaxies Mutz et al 1994 Im
et al 1995 Smail et al 1995 Hence faint distant galaxies are either intrinsically smaller
or their emission is more concentrated toward the nuclear regions than that of low-redshift
bright galaxies In fact the evolution of stellar populations in galaxies is likely to aect the
intrinsic surface brightness prole and therefore the observed half-light radius
Studies of our own galaxy have converged on a model for global star formation in
which the Galaxy formed inside out leading to predictions of star formation rate gas
surface density and metallicity as functions of time and galactic radius eg Lacey and
Fall 1985 Wang and Silk 1994 Prantzos and Aubert 1995 have demonstrated that a
robust and generic model contains the following ingredients a rate of star formation that is
proportional to the product of gas surface density and dierential rotation rate and infall
 4 
of unenriched gas during the rst few Gyr The radial dependence of the star formation
prescription on total gas surface density and via a star formation threshold on dierential
rotation rate has been veried for a sample of nearby spirals in a study of H emission from
prominent HII regions by Kennicutt 1989 Because the rotation curves are at throughout
most of the star-forming regions of disks it follows that disks must have formed inside-out
Hence small scale-lengths are expected at early ages
In this Letter we consider idealized disk galaxy models with infall to explore the
inuence of the radial dependence of the star formation rate on the observed angular sizes
of distant galaxies In 2 we present models that reproduce the characteristics of local
disk galaxies of various morphological types and compute the predicted evolution of the
intrinsic surface brightness proles with redshift In 3 we compare our models with recent
observations by Mutz et al 1994 and Smail et al 1995 We conclude from this simple
but quantitative analysis that intrinsic luminosity evolution provides a potential explanation
for the decrease in the angular size of faint galaxies observed in deep surveys In all the
calculations presented below we adopt a xed Hubble constant of Ho  50 kmsecMpc
2 Disk Galaxies Infall Formation
We rst describe infall formation models that reproduce the observed characteristics of
present-day disk galaxies of various Hubble types Models with infall are favored by recent
studies of chemical evolution in the Galactic disk that are consistent with the observed gas
and star surface densities metallicity prole and star formation rate Ferrini et al 1994
Dopita  Ryder 1994 see Prantzos  Aubert 1995 for a detailed comparative analysis
Prantzos  Aubert conclude that a phenomenological model satisfying the observational
requirements is one with infall in which the SFR depends on radius and time following a
 5 
Schmidt-type law
SF Rr t  1  R1 gr t
Mpc2Gyr1
where R  032 is the returned fraction of mass that was formed into stars gr t is the
gas surface density at radius r and age t and gr  031  Rrr1 Gyr is the gas
consumption timescale r  85 kpc This model explains many properties of our galaxy
both as a function of radius and of age Equation 1 relies on the instantaneous recycling
approximation which must be relaxed in studies of the metallicity in the inner radii of disks
eg Prantzos  Aubert 1995 Since we are interested here only in galactic luminosity
and size evolution our results are not appreciably aected by this approximation The
evolution of gas surface density in the infall disk model can be written
dgr t
 SF Rr t1  R  f r t
where f r t  exptf r is the infall rate of metal-free gas with characteristic timescale
f r We normalize the infall rate to the total surface density tot of stars plus gas observed
at the age T  135 Gyr Solving equation 2 for the evolution of the gas surface density
we obtain
gr t  totr T 
exptgr  exptf r
1  f rgr1  expT f r
So far we have considered a pure disk model for which the main free parameters are
the infall time scale f r and the total surface density distribution of stars plus gas at time
T  totr T  We now adjust these parameters for galaxies of dierent Hubble types Sb
Sbc-Sc and Sd-Im by combining the disk model with a type-dependent bulge component
to reproduce the observed spectral energy distributions surface brightness proles bulge-
to-total luminosity ratios and Scalo parameters ie the ratio of present-to-past averaged
SFR of nearby galaxies To achieve this we compute the spectrophotometric properties of
model galaxies using the latest version of the Bruzual-Charlot stellar population synthesis
models Charlot Worthey  Bressan 1996 The initial mass function is assumed to be
 6 
a power law with the Salpeter slope and upper and lower cutos at 125 M and 01 M
respectively We x the metallicity at the solar value This should be a good approximation
at most ages but may slightly underestimate by less than 20 the luminosity at the
youngest ages because metal-poor stars are somewhat more luminous than metal-rich ones
Bruzual  Charlot 1996
We adopt constant infall time scales of f  3 Gyr 7 Gyr and  for the model
Sb Sbc-Sc and Sd-Im galaxies respectively For all galaxy types at T  135 Gyr the
disk component is assumed to have the total surface density distribution of stars plus gas
observed in the disk of the Galaxy Fig 1 of Prantzos  Aubert 1995 We then dene the
surface density of stars plus gas inside the bulge at T  135 Gyr as well as the bulge
radius for the dierent types by requiring that 1 the bulge-to-total luminosity ratios
of Sb Sbc-Sc and Sd-Im galaxies be 020 013 and 00 respectively Kennicutt et al
1994 Ferguson  McGaugh 1995 and 2 the bulge and disk surface brightness proles
t exponential laws with a type-independent scale length ratio of  01 Andredakis et al
1995 Courteau et al 1996 The model galaxy bulges at T  135 Gyr are assumed to have
null gas surface density and exponential stellar surface density proles normalized to t
the adopted disk proles at bulge radii of 2 kpc and 15 kpc for the Sb and Sbc-Sc types
respectively The validity of the models is checked by comparing the model spectra at age
135 Gyr with those of present-day Sb Sbc-Sc and Sd-Im galaxies The spectral energy
distribution is essentially controlled by the Scalo parameter which is observed to range
from about 001 in Sa galaxies to over 10 in late-type spiral galaxies eg Kennicutt et al
1994 The Scalo parameters produced by the adopted Sb Sbc-Sc and Sd-Im models are
 045  07 and  12 respectively The model Sb Sbc-Sd and Sd-Im galaxies computed
in this way have absolute B magnitudes at T  135 Gyr of about 195 197 and 199
respectively

The predicted rest frame surface brightness proles at an age of 135 Gyr are displayed
in Figure 1a for the three galaxy types Figure 1b shows that the evolution of the underlying
stellar population implies signicant changes in the surface brightness proles At z  3
the central regions of the Sb galaxy are intrinsically signicantly brighter than at z  0
while those of the the Sd-Im galaxy are only slightly brighter The reason for this is that
early-type disk galaxies with short timescales of star formation fade more rapidly than
late-type ones As a result from z  0 to z  3 the apparent surface brightness of Sb
Sbc-Sc and Sd-Im galaxies drops by about 3 4 and 5 magarcsec2 respectively As we
shall see below these changes in the surface brightness proles of disk galaxies with infall
have important consequences for the observed angular sizes and half-light radii In Figure 1c
we have convolved the predicted proles with an observational point spread function PSF
of FWHM 01 arcsec We note the consistency between our predicted proles for forming
bulgedisk systems and the proles tted to star-forming galaxies at redshifts greater than

3 Comparison with Observations
Sizes of faint eld galaxies have been measured in high-resolution HST images as
part of the Medium Deep Survey MDS project Griths et al 1994 Mutz et al 1994
Casertano et al 1995 Phillips et al 1995 Forbes et al 1995 which allow morphological
classication to I  22 mag and to even fainter magnitudes R  27 mag in ground-based
studies using the Keck telescope Smail et al 1995 Even though ground-based studies do
not allow morphological classication of galaxies at these faintest magnitudes a comparison
with the models presented in 2 is also important because disk galaxies are expected to
dominate the eld population see below In comparing our models with observations we
account for the eect of the PSF and specic magnitude measurement scheme adopted
 8 
aperture or isophotal The convolution with a PSF has the eect of increasing the inferred
half-light radii We further assume for simplicity that the simulated galaxies are observed
face-on We now present results of comparisons of the models with the observations of Mutz
et al 1994 and Smail et al 1995
Consider rst data from the HST MDS project taken with the Wide Field Planetary
Camera in two lters V 5550 A and I8930 A Mutz et al 1994 These include
isophotal magnitudes measured down to outer isophotes of SBV   270 magarsec2 and
SBI  255 magarcsec2 for 33 morphologically identied disk galaxies at 002  z  06
PSF of F W HM  01 arcsec In Figure 2 we compare the observed evolution of half-light
radius and I magnitude as a function of redshift with the predictions of the various disk
models We have assumed that galaxies formed at a redshift zf  10 in an   1 universe
but similar results would be obtained for cosmologies with zf  5  30 and   01  10
Also indicated by large crosses in the two panels are the observed properties of nearby disk
galaxies from the sample of Mathewson et al 1992 The predicted angular sizes and
I magnitudes are consistent with the mean of the observations at low and high redshifts
although the model I magnitudes may be slightly fainter than the MDS magnitudes at
the highest redshifts Figure 2a also shows that at z  1 the predicted half-light radius
of Sd-Im galaxies becomes smaller than that of earlier-type disks The reason for this is
that Sd-Im galaxies have the faintest central surface brightness Fig 1b and hence only
light from the very central part of the disk satises the isophotal magnitude selection For
comparison we also show in Figure 2a the predictions of no-evolution models assuming
constant intrinsic luminosity proles of galaxies Even though evolution aects only mildly
the predictions in the observed range of redshifts it makes considerable dierence at z  1
Next we consider the sample of galaxies observed in the V  R and I bands by Smail
et al 1995 with the Keck Telescope Following Smail et al we compute model R
 9 
magnitudes by adopting the largest of a xed 15 arcsec diameter aperture or isophotal
diameter down to a surface brightness limit of SBR  283 magarcsec2 The adopted
seeing FWHM is 06 arcsec The observed mean half-light radii are plotted as a function of
R magnitude in Figure 3 together with model predictions for four dierent combinations of
zf and  The observational relation is more tightly dened than the radius-redshift and
magnitude-redshift relations considered previously Fig 2 because it is based on a much
larger sample of objects As a result the dierences in the predictions for the various disk
Hubble types are larger than the observational uncertainties
To make a more meaningful comparison with the observations we have estimated
weighted average values of the predicted half-light radius of the disk population as a
function R magnitude We assume that 70  of the local eld population is accounted for
by disk galaxies with ratios SbSbc-ScSd-Im 25  25  20 Ferguson  McGaugh
1995 independent of redshift We do not include here the contribution to the average
half-light radius values by elliptical and S0 galaxies but a recent morphological analysis of
ultradeep HST images suggests that early-type galaxies should account for only a minority
of the observed galaxies at the faintest magnitudes Abraham et al 1996 Although a large
fraction of galaxies at I  25 mag in these observations appear to be peculiar irregular or
merging systems this may be in part a bias due to our viewing these systems in rest-frame
UB bands We then expect the high-redshift predictions of our models presented in terms
of half-light radii rather than detailed prole tting to be a reasonable representation
of disk sizes in young or even forming galaxies Figure 3 shows results both including
and not including intrinsic luminosity evolution The dierences in the shapes of the rhl
curves are especially striking at the faintest R magnitudes The predictions of models with
evolution to R  26 depend moderately on the assumed redshift of formation and density
parameter The dependence is stronger for Sb galaxies than for Sd-Im galaxies because
earlier-type galaxies have shorter timescales of star formation and fade more signicantly
 10 
as they age As expected predictions of models without evolution do not t the data
at faint magnitudes and they depend more markedly on  We interpret the overall
agreement between predictions and observations in Figure 3 as an indication that within
the framework of disk galaxy formation by infall intrinsic luminosity evolution should be
included to explain at least partially the small observed sizes of disk galaxies at faint
magnitudes
In summary we have applied infall formation models to simulate the radial dependence
of the SFR in dierent Hubble types of disk galaxies The inside-out formation of galaxies
in these models together with the chemical evolution of their stellar populations change
the rest-frame surface brightness proles of the simulated galaxies as they evolve Earlier
types are more aected by this intrinsic luminosity evolution Observational constraints for
the samples analyzed in Mutz et al 1994 and in Smail et al 1995 were imposed on the
modeled galaxies As expected and shown in Figures 2 and 3 infall models including rest
frame luminosity evolution predict angular sizes smaller than models with xed half-light
radius Moreover such models can explain the clear trend toward very small sizes observed
at faint magnitudes and high redshift The simple models considered here are based
primarily on tting the properties of nearby galaxies and provide a robust description of
present epoch star formation rates and luminosity proles Evolving these models backward
in time is the most direct approach towards interpreting data on distant galaxies It would
be of considerable interest to rene the predictions of our models by including a more
realistic mix of galaxy types and luminosities in order to make a more detailed comparison
with the characteristics of the population observed in the Hubble Deep Field sample
