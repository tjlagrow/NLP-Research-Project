ABSTRACT Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are the most insignicant extragalactic stellar
systems in terms of their visibility but potentially very signicant in terms of their role in the
formation and evolution of much more luminous galaxies We discuss the present observational
data and their implications for theories of the formation and evolution of both dwarf and giant
galaxies The putative dark matter content of these low-surface-brightness systems is of partic-
ular interest as is their chemical evolution Surveys for new dwarf spheroidals hidden behind

the stars of our Galaxy and those which are not bound to giant galaxies may give new clues as
to the origins of this unique class of galaxy
1 INTRODUCTION
The astrophysical signicance of small extragalactic systems the dwarf and related classes
of galaxies remains unclear Hodge 1971 Did these galaxies once lie along the main path
of galaxy formation or are they merely collections of leftover matter produced by secondary
processes Are they strongly bound or are they dissolving in the Galactic tidal eld Hodge
1964 Hodge and Michie 1969 Cold dark matter CDM models for galaxy formation have
served to focus these issues In CDM low mass galaxies would be the rst objects to become
bound and drop out of the expanding Universe Blumenthal et al 1984
In general these small systems should not have survived to the present day but should
be subsumed into larger systems White and Rees 1978 Moore Frenk and White 1993 or
more correctly their dissipationless dark halos should have merged with the fate of the visible
galaxy being very uncertain Lacey and Cole 1993 Kaufmann and White 1993 The baryonic
material will keep its separate identity only if it has dissipated enough energy to be more tightly
bound than the next level of the hierarchy White 1983 Cen and Ostriker 1993 this may indeed
be the case Navarro et al 1994 The ideas of the CDM model lead naturally to the question
of whether dark-matter-dominated low-mass galaxies exist in nature and to the build-up of
luminous galaxies like the Milky Way by merging of substructure eg reviewed by Silk and
Wyse 1993 Extracting the merging history  and future  of the Milky Way Galaxy may be
possible by study of satellite galaxies
As a result there have been renewed eorts to measure the spatial distributions dynamics
structures and other properties of low-mass galaxies in a variety of environments Faber and
Lin 1983 Lin and Faber 1983 Thuan Gott and Schneider 1987 Eder et al 1989 Puche and
Carignan 1991 Vader and Sandage 1991 Ferguson and Sandage 1990 including low-surface-
brightness galaxies Disney and Phillips 1987 Impey Bothun and Malin 1988 Schombert et al
1992 Sandage Binggeli and Tamman 1985 Karachentseva Schmidt and Richter 1984 The
advent of automated plate-measuring machines and large format CCDs coupled to multi-object
spectrographs has resulted in data for large numbers of individual stars in several of the Galactic
dwarf spheroidal dSph systems together with rigorous searches for more companions to our
Galaxy
Satellite galaxies at high Galactic latitude may often be found by simply plotting stellar
surface density contours projected on the sky For example the dwarf galaxy discovered in the
Sextans constellation latitude b  423 by Irwin et al 1990 is clearly seen in their Figure 1b
which plots all stellar objects down to the plate limit BJ  225 note the paucity of objects
classied as stars  the contours plotted start at 15 imagesarcmin2 and increase in steps of 05
imagesarcmin2 The dwarf has an angular extent of a degree or so Dwarf galaxies could be
hiding at lower latitudes where there is sucient foreground disk that the over-density of the
satellite is too small a perturbation to be detected by a simple sum of all stellar images An
example of this is the Sagittarius dwarf recently discovered Ibata Gilmore and Irwin 1994 as
part of a survey of the kinematics of the bulge Gilmore and Ibata in prep The dwarf initially
manifest itself as a moving group with very distinct kinematics from the bulge and rather
localised in angular position The color-magnitude diagram of the eld where the moving group
is seen kinematically contains a fairly obvious core-helium-burning red clump indicative of an
intermediate-age population and giant branch which are not detected in those elds where the
stars have normal bulge kinematics Isolating stellar images which have the color and apparent
magnitude of the clump and plotting isodensity contours of the dierence between the moving
group eld and an oset eld revealed the spatially-extended dwarf galaxy Ibata Gilmore and
Irwin 1994 The isophotes are very aspherical suggestive of tidal stresses The distance to the
dwarf may be estimated from the clumpHB magnitude resulting in a position  12 kpc from
the Galactic center on the other side of the Galaxy  5 kpc below the disk plane The dwarf
is inferred to be rather massive similar to the Fornax dwarf galaxy from application of the
observed luminosity-metallicity relation of the extant satellite galaxies Caldwell et al 1992
and from the red clumpgiant population At least three globular clusters have kinematics
and distances that are suggestive of their being physically associated with the dwarf galaxy
Follow-up deep photometry has conrmed the dSph nature of the Sagittarius dwarf and the
intermediate age  10 Gyr Mateo et al 1994
Multi-object spectroscopy on large telescopes has provided radial velocities and chemical
abundances for large enough samples of stars in the Galactic dSph to begin to make quanti-
tative analyses of the internal dynamics and enrichment histories while deep large-area color-
magnitude diagrams allow the dSph stellar populations to be disentangled from the foreground
Galaxy Proper motions of the Galactic-companion dSph are beginning to become available
and will constrain the orbits of these objects Searches for low-surface-brightness dwarfs beyond
the Local Group using large-format CCDs should reveal counterparts to the local dSph large-
area photometric surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey will provide ideal datasets for
identication of dSph This review aims to put these new and anticipated results in context
The least-massive known galaxies are the dSph systems The dSph galaxies exist at a
key position in the hierarchy of spheroidal stellar systems  although as we discuss further
below whether or not they are bound is open to question In some properties they appear to
be the logical extension of the diuse dE galaxy structural family to low luminosities Wirth
and Gallagher 1984 Kormendy 1985 and yet in some respects also resemble low-luminosity
disk galaxies Kormendy 1987 Additionally they overlap in luminosity with the more massive
globular star clusters such as 47 Tuc or Omega Centauri Webbink 1985
However despite their similarities in total stellar luminosities dSph galaxies and globular
clusters have dramatically dierent structures de Carvalho and Djorgovski 1992 Globulars are
centrally concentrated and have central stellar densities even in the relatively unconcentrated
Palomar globulars that are  100 times the central stellar densities of the much more diuse
dSph galaxies Webbink 1985 Djorgovski 1993 A wide-ield image of the Ursa Minor dSph
is shown in Figure 1
Indeed our current understanding of star formation suggests that the
stars in dSph could not have formed at the currently observed low stellar densities Evidently
something happened between the epoch of star formation and now a something that is most
probably related to the inferred low escape velocities of these diuse systems Dekel and Silk
1986 The presence of globular star clusters in the Fornax dSph demonstrates that at least this
dSph is a true galaxy and extends the trend for all known globular star clusters to be bound to
galaxies although the search for truly intergalactic globular clusters continues Arp and Madore
1979 The signicance of the fact that the Fornax dwarf has many more globular clusters per
unit galaxy luminosity than expected from normal galaxies is not clear although perhaps the
lower tidal eld and lack of other internal destruction mechanisms could be a factor Rodgers
and Roberts 1994
Equilibrium dynamical models which require large dark-matter densities have now been
constructed for several dSph galaxies being most extreme in terms of mass-to-light ratio for
the Draco and Ursa Minor galaxies Lake 1990a Pryor and Kormendy 1990 In an insightful
pair of papers Faber and Lin 1983 and Lin and Faber 1983 suggested that the presence
of a dominant dark-matter component is the key feature which distinguishes galaxies from star
clusters luminous mass cannot be the crucial factor and that all small galaxies have similar and
large dark-matter components Since the publication of these papers evidence has been mounting
for dark matter in the dwarf irregular galaxies with the trend that lower luminosity disk systems
Sc and later have relatively more dark matter Puche and Carignan 1991 Ashman Salucci
and Persic 1993 It is tempting to identify the dSph galaxies as the gas-poor counterparts of
irregulars but many questions remain some of which we address in this review
A summary of the currently-known galaxies in the Local Group is given in Table 1 based
on van den Bergh 1992 The membership of the Local Group also becomes uncertain at larger
distances eg for galaxies like Leo A see van den Bergh 1994a Hoessel et al 1994
We dene a dSph to be a galaxy with a total luminosity of MB  14 low optical
surface-brightness fainter than 22 V-magnitudes per square arcsec and no nucleus Note that
this denition excludes NGC 205 NGC 147 NGC 185 and many of the elliptical dwarfs found
in the Virgo cluster even those of low surface-brightness Binggeli and Cameron 1991
particular bona de dSph galaxies and certainly all dSph systems for which we will have good
dynamical models in the near future are located near the Milky Way and M31 two massive
spirals The close association between the dSph dwarfs and massive galaxies has a number of
signicant consequences which have been individually discussed in the literature during the past
decade In this paper we will 1 revisit the implications of the satellite status of Galactic dSph
systems especially in terms of the assumption of dynamical equilibrium 2 consider why such
connections might occur between dwarf and giant galaxies and 3 emphasize the importance
of resolving these questions
2 BASIC PROPERTIES OF dSph GALAXIES
Recent papers by among others Da Costa 1992 Caldwell et al 1992 Mateo et al
1993 Zinn 1993 and Kormendy and Bender 1994 provide good overviews of dSph galax-
ies Properties of the Galactic dSph systems can be divided into three main areas consisting
of structural parameters mass size internal kinematics stellar populations ages chemical
elemental abundances binary star fractions gas content and environment factors orbits cor-
relations between internal properties and Galacto-centric radius A summary of basic dSph
characteristics drawn from the current literature Hodge 1982 Zaritsky et al 1989 Demers and
Irwin 1993 Lehnert et al 1992 is given in Table 2
21 Structure
The dSph are apparently ellipsoidal galaxies of low central surface brightness Their stellar
density proles like those of other dE systems are t either with low central-concentration King
models or with exponential disks having scale lengths of 100 - 400 pc see Figure 2 The outer
radii of these systems are dicult to determine due to their large angular sizes and faintnesses
Visual central surface-brightnesses are in the range of 22  26 magarcsec2 and are not strongly
correlated with the absolute visual magnitudes which extend down to MV  9 for the Ursa
Minor system Lake 1990a Mateo et al 1993 Nieto et al 1990
The dSph like other dEs are in one way more disky than even spirals Where van
der Kruit and Searle 1982 have found the exponential stellar disks of spirals often end rather
abruptly after about 5 scale lengths the Andromeda dSph remain exponential in form out
to nearly seven scale-lengths where they are lost into the sky background Armandro et al
1993 The presence of such smooth edges in dSph and dE galaxies are not understood but
could be a symptom of the eects of tidal heating Aguilar and White 1986 However it
should be remembered that perhaps as many as ten orbits are required before a tidal radius is
well-dened with no sustained memory of the initial radius Seitzer 1985 and the dSph are
suciently distant that this is a substantial fraction of a Hubble time The projected axial
ratios of the dSph are in the range of 0 
 1  ba 
 06 Hodge 1971 Caldwell et al 1992
and are not very dierent from the range seen in dwarf irregular galaxies Lin  Faber 1983
note that the axial ratios of the dSph may be due in part to tidal stretching as discussed below
Internal kinematics are now available for most of the known Galactic dSph galaxies from
high precision observations of radial velocities of individual stars with more data being analysed
Several points stand out from the current kinematic data Kormendy 1985 Pryor and Kormendy
1990 Ashman 1992 Freeman 1993 Suntze et al 1993 Hargreaves et al 1994ab
1 The central velocity data can be t by a simple Gaussian projected-velocity distribu-
tion function but it is not yet established that this distribution is independent of location within
the galaxy though this is the model generally used The spatial variation of the internal stellar
kinematics is of great importance in constraining dynamical models but the data analysed to
date have not allowed any strong conclusions data which several research groups have in hand
should be capable of distinguishing dark-matter models
2 All of the dSph central velocity dispersions are in the 5-12 kms range This is near the
magic velocity dispersion of young stars and HI gas in the thin disks of spirals van der Kruit and
Shostak 1984 generally believed to have something to do with hydrogen cooling at T 10 000
K and to the stellar velocity dispersions in globular star clusters Illingworth 1976 but is larger
than the velocity dispersions of typical OB associations The velocity dispersions also do not
correlate with optical luminosities If interpreted using the virial theorem the conclusion is that
the dSph all have approximately the same mass while their luminosities span a wide range
3 There is no evidence for rotational support to very low levels in some of the dSph
for which suitable spaially-resolved kinematic data are available such that v  03 in the
Fornax Freeman 1993 and Sculptor dSph systems In this regard the dSph although appearing
moderately attened are like other dE galaxies in being supported by anisotropic velocities
Bender and Nieto 1990 Mateo et al 1991 A shear-velocity eld has been detected in the
Ursa Minor dSph Hargreaves et al 1994b consistent with rotation about the apparent major
axis with v of order unity in the outer regions These data are interpreted as the result of
tidal stretching along the initial minor axis combined with the generation of a net azimuthal
streaming by preferential tidal stripping of stars on prograde orbits Hargreaves et al 1994b
Spatially-resolved kinematics will allow better equilibrium dynamical models to be constructed
for dSph galaxies as has been done for globular clusters Lupton et al 1989 Gunn and Grin
The density structures of dSph galaxies have been widely discussed in the literature
especially in connection with the dark-matter problem The simplest approach for nding
core ML ratios is to t core velocity dispersion data together with the star-count brightness
proles to equilibrium dynamical models with isotropic velocity dispersions Lake 1990a Pryor
and Kormendy 1990 Hargreaves et al 1994a This process yields ML values in the range from
5-15 for the Fornax and Sculptor dSph systems and up to 100 for the Ursa Minor Sextans and
Draco systems These models applied to Ursa Minor Carina and Draco also give high central
densities of about 01Mpc3 most of which must be in the form of dark matter Lin and Faber
1983 This contrasts with inferred central dark-matter densities of 
 001Mpc3 for gas-rich
dwarf irregulars Puche and Carignan 1990 and typical spiral galaxies Kent 1987 The lack
of rotational support to some of these dSph however implies anisotropic velocity dispersions as
shown by Pryor and Kormendy 1990 use of anisotropic models would result in a somewhat
reduced core mass density The uncertainties and subtleties associated with the determination
of ML are discussed for example by Hargreaves et al 1994ab and in Binney and Tremaine
1987
Lack of knowledge about orbits also complicates discussions of the internal dynamics of
the dSph If we assume that the Galactic dSph are on only moderately elliptical orbits then
the orbital periods are several times longer than the internal crossing times Alternatively if
these dSph are now making their apo-Galacticon passages on highly eccentric orbits then since
the time spent in the dense inner Galaxy is a small fraction of the orbital period the time scale
for variations in the tidal eld produced by the Milky Way may be close to the internal crossing
time Thus the question of the degree to which dSph galaxies are in dynamical equilibrium
remains open The ongoing eorts to measure proper motions of the nearest dSph galaxies
Scholz and Irwin 1993 Majewski and Cudworth 1993 Cudworth Schweitzer and Majewski
1994 which will allow three-dimensional orbits to be determined will be a good test of models
22 Stellar Populations
The dSph galaxies occupy an intermediate position in terms of stellar populations Their
metal abundances as inferred from the spectra and colors of red giants fall in the regime dened
by Galactic globular clusters with most Galactic dSph galaxies having mean metallicities similar
to the peak of the halo globular clusters or 15 dex An example of a color-magnitude diagram
for the Carina dSph is shown in Figure 3 taken from Smecker-Hane et al 1994
However dSph galaxies are unlike most globulars in that a range of abundances is present
in several of the Galactic dSphs see Table 2 Further the globular clusters of the Fornax
dwarf do not all have the same chemical abundance but range from 135 dex to 193 dex
Dubath Meylan and Mayer 1992 In addition the Fornax Carina Draco and Leo I dSphs
have intermediate-age stellar populations identied from AGB stars and a tentative turno
population with an inferred last epoch of major star formation of near 5 Gyr Aaronson 1986
Mighell 1990 Mighell and Butcher 1992 Lee et al 1993 Smecker-Hane et al 1994 reviewed by
Freedman 1994 These four dSph systems therefore are fundamentally dierent from globular
star clusters and it is likely that age spreads also exist in other dSphs but these are not trivially
detected in faint old stellar populations where the main sequence turno is dicult to identify
Freedman 1994 Indeed the stellar population of Leo I is predominantly of intermediate age
with no obvious signature of very old stars Demers Irwin and Gambu 1994 There may be a
trend of the percentage of intermediate-age stars with distance from the Milky Way such that
the more distant the dSph the larger the fraction of younger stars Silk Wyse and Shields 1987
van den Bergh 1994b although the newest Galactic dSph the Sagittarius dwarf does not t
this trend
The evolution of gas in small galaxies is probably largely controlled by the ow of matter
into and out of the systems Due to the low escape velocities of dSph galaxies the ability of
these systems to retain SNe ejecta is limited Larson 1974 Vader 1986 Dekel and Silk 1986
and thus metallicities will depend on mass loss perhaps even more than on the star formation
history Sandage 1965 Vader 1986 De Young and Gallagher 1990 Furthermore the internal
dynamical evolution of the system may be greatly aected by galactic winds Meurer et al
1992 have found compelling evidence for star-formation-driven gas loss from a dwarf galaxy
ongoing surveys Marlowe 1995 will allow an estimate of the importance of galactic winds in
general In addition small galaxies may be able to capture cooling gas from the circumgalactic
environment allowing rejuvenation of the stellar population Silk Wyse and Shields 1987  thus
competition for gas could provide an explanation for trend of intermediate age population with
distance from the Milky Way This process will further modify metallicity distributions with
possible signatures in chemical element ratios  those elements primarily synthesised in Type
II supernovae such as oxygen may be aected more than those elements primarily synthesised
in the deaths of long-lived progenitor stars such as iron Wheeler Sneden and Truran 1989
Gilmore and Wyse 1991
The galactic-wind model for Galactic dSph also seems to be consistent with the lack of any
detectable interstellar matter in these systems Searches for cool gas via the HI 21-cm line have
yielded only upper limits Knapp Kerr and Bowers 1978 Mould Stavely-Smith and Wright
1990 with MHILV
 001 although the confusing eects of the Magellanic Stream and high
velocity HI complicate searches for cool gas in nearby galaxies This should be compared with
the MHILV ratios of 001-01 observed for some dE and transition dSphdIrr galaxies such as
the Phoenix dwarf Carignan Demers and Cote 1991 As a group the Galactic dSph galaxies
are among the most HI-poor galaxies known
An examination of Table 2 suggests the complexities expected from galactic-wind models
are present in chemical abundances of the Galactic dSph retinue The most massive systems
have higher metallicities as predicted by wind-induced mass-loss models but the presence of
an intermediate-age stellar population in Carina indicates that other eects have also been
important In a wind mass-loss model we would expect that the presence of intermediate-age
stellar populations the metallicity levels and the galactic mass correlate and yet this does not
appear to be strictly true However the low mean metallicity of the stars in dSph galaxies is
indeed the expected signature for galaxies where chemical evolution has been strongly inuence
by gas loss via winds rather than by astration assuming an invariant stellar Initial Mass Function
IMF Hartwick 1976 In addition the distribution of stellar metallicities in a few dSph appear
to be skewed as expected if sudden loss of gas truncated the chemical evolution Suntze 1993
23 Orbits and Environment
The orbits of the dSph galaxies will not be fully known until proper motion measurements
begin to become available within the next few years These measurements are extremely dicult
because the proper motions are expected to be small For example a transverse velocity of
100 km s1 at a distance of 50 kpc yields a proper motion of about  05 milliarcsec yr1
This is currently just feasible by using extragalactic objects to dene the stationary reference
background on deep plates taken with large reectors over multi-decade time baselines see
Majweski  Cudworth 1993 Kroupa Roser  Bastian 1994
Even in the absence of detailed orbits the available radial velocities however already
present an interesting picture Zaritsky et al 1989 If the dSph were on circular orbits then
their Galactocentric radial velocities should be a small fraction of the circular velocity at their
locations For example if we adopt a maximal mass model for the Galaxy with Vc  220 kms
at 100 kpc we would expect Vr
 25 kms for near circular orbits thus we immediately see that
most of the Galactic dSph cannot have circular orbits Little and Tremaine 1987 and Fich
and Tremaine 1991 analyzed the dynamics of dSph systems in the context of determining the
Galactic mass distribution They conclude that most of the nearby dSph are likely to be bound
to the Milky Way and have phase-mixed over their orbits which have a range in eccentricities
Thus it is proper to assume that most dSph galaxies have completed several orbits around the
Milky Way since their formation and with the possible exception of Leo I Byrd et al 1994
are not newly acquired members of the Galactic family
Three additional interesting points emerge from these discussions 1 With the exception
of the disturbed Saggitarius dSph the innermost Galactic dSph are currently located near the
estimated outer radius of the Galactic dark halo R 
 50 kpc 2 The orbits of some dSph may
be suciently extended that the inuence of M31 needs to be taken into account 3 In the
absence of proper motion measurements we cannot prove that the dSph are bound to the Milky
3 THE PRICE OF PROXIMITY EFFECTS OF THE MILKY WAY
The array of Galactic dSph galaxies presents us with a highly ordered distribution across
the sky As noted several years ago Kunkel and Demers 1976 Lynden-Bell 1982ab most of
the dSph systems fall near either the great circle dened by the Magellanic Stream or a second
nearby great circle which perhaps associated with the Fornax system The Galactic dSph retinue
does not have the appearance expected if these systems were being captured from a postulated
reservoir of faint dwarf systems Tremaine 1987 Majewski 1994
If we want to make dSph
galaxies as independent entities then a plausible physical mechanism must be found to order
these systems into the present near polar-ring structure about the Milky Way
One might appeal to dynamical friction to accomplish the task of selecting which Galactic
satellites could survive However even for a dark-matter dominated system with MLV  100
the dynamical friction time scales can be estimated from standard relationships eg Binney
and Tremaine 1987 to give
tdf  MgalMsatellitetcrossing  1012yr
for circular orbits at the present radii of the inner Galactic dSph The masses of existing dSph
galaxies are too low by a factor of 100 for dynamical friction to be important at their present
locations And even if the orbits were eccentric an equivalent circular radius of  10 kpc is
needed for these systems to experience orbital decay in less than 1010 yr The orbits of the well-
studied dSph galaxies around the Milky Way have yet to be profoundly inuenced by dynamical
friction Quinn and Goodman 1986 As a corollary there appears to be no obvious way for
dynamical forces associated with a spheroidal Galactic dark halo to have aligned an initially
random distribution of dSph galaxies into the current near-polar-orbit array
A second destruction mechanism for satellites of galaxies is tidal heating and disruption
In its simplest form this process can be viewed as the shrinking of a zero-velocity surface about a
mass distribution A rough guide to the tidal radius rj is then given by the Jacobi limit Binney
and Tremaine 1987 essentially that disruption occurs when the mean density of the satellite
and parent galaxy are equal This can be written in a useful form for the dSph systems as
rj  15LV dSph107L1012MMMW MLV dSph13D100kpckpc
Thus for the Draco dwarf with LV  2  105L D75 kpc the tidal radius is rj 
300MLV 13 pc or rj  600 pc for a normal stellar composition While the radii of dSph
galaxies are extremely dicult to determine observationally Lake 1990a suggests that the
photometric radii based on the Hodge star counts for the Draco and Ursa Minor dSphs are
r  25 arcmin or  05 kpc Thus the sizes of the dSph are at least close to the expectations of
a simple tidal model although their internal velocity dispersions suggest that they are actually
too tightly bound for tidal shredding to be eective
The real situation is certainly even more complex than indicated by this rough calculation
For example Kuhn and Miller 1989 suggest that resonant coupling may enhance tidal heating
and also lead to the disruption of dSph galaxies More extensive discussions of the complex
dynamical issues associated with tidal interactions can also be found in the literature describing
the destruction of globular star clusters eg Aguilar 1993 and references therein We also
note that the qualitatively expected eects of tidal heating are clearly present observationally
in outer regions of some elliptical galaxies Kormendy 1977
Another tidal limit may be set if dSph get suciently close to the Milky Way to interact
with the disk This could produce disk shocking which will inuence the internal structures of
dSph when their densities are comparable to that of the local disk Aguilar 1993 Capaciolli
Piotto and Stiavelli 1993 Additionally passages through the outer gas-rich Galactic disk
would lead to an external ram pressure on gas within dSph especially if the disk extends in
ionized gas beyond the neutral HI edge Maloney 1992 This mechanism would then further
reduce the ability of these systems to retain gas Such an eect may be operative on the
Magellanic Clouds producing the Magellanic Stream Mathewson et al 1987 Wayte 1991
although a straightforward tidal origin for the Stream remains viable Gardiner Sawa and
Fujimoto 1994 Note that both bound and unbound orbits of the LMC are consistent with the
present proper motion measurements Kroupa Roser and Bastian 1994
With the recognition of tidal heating as a destructive mechanism for dSph galaxies we can
divide models of the internal dynamics of dSph systems into two major classes The equilibrium
models deal with each galaxy individually and assume that external processes have had a negli-
gible eect on the internal structures This class of model yields high dark-matter densities for
some dSph galaxies including the Carina system which is currently too far from the Milky Way
to experience signicant tidal eects Pryor and Kormendy 1990 In this picture a universal
structure for the dSph would be that of dense galaxies which are gravitationally equivalent to
rocks and are not inuenced by the Galactic tides The spatial distribution of dSph galaxies then
is in roughly a steady state and will evolve only slowly in response to dynamical perturbations
eg passages of the Magellanic Clouds
An alternative view is that the dSph are as fragile as they appear from their low stellar
surface densities These systems then are being tidally heated and thus eventually will be
destroyed Kuhn and Miller 1989 Kuhn 1993 In this model the Galactic population of dSph
galaxies is evolving and some systems could have been disrupted in the past Indeed we would
expect that the innermost mean radius where dSph systems are found might move outward with
time as closer-in objects are disrupted The present-day dSph galaxies then would be remnants
of what may once have been a more extensive satellite population
4 CONSEQUENCES OF THE DARK-MATTER PROBLEM
The central issue in interpretation of the velocity dispersion observations is whether or
not the dSph galaxies are in dynamical equilibrium states If they are equilibrium systems then
a dominant dark-matter component is required in several dSph systems Furthermore this dark
component is inferred to have central densities that are ten times larger than those derived for
more luminous galaxies The nature of the dark matter is also an open issue at present with
baryonic dark matter perhaps favored by the high densities which are suggestive of dissipative
material However should the dSph be in the process of disruption then obviously the virial
theorem should not be applied and the presence of an excess density of dark matter is not
secure
We now consider the implications of the dark-matter problem by considering three possible
41 Non-Baryonic Dark Matter
Faber and Lin 1983 used equilibrium dynamical models to conclude that the dSph
probably have very high mass-to-light ratios and therefore contain large amounts of dark matter
This was later put in the cosmological context of the hierarchical clustering Cold Dark Matter
scenario where the rst scales to turn-around and presumably form stars are of the mass
scale of dwarf galaxies Blumenthal et al 1989 The properties of these systems and their
possible identication with present-day dwarf galaxies is discussed in Dekel and Silk 1986
The persistence of dwarfs in groups of galaxies is unclear  the CDM halos of typical ie 1
perturbations on this scale most certainly merge but the fate of the luminous components is
unknown Lacey and Cole 1993 Kauman and White 1993
However the large inferred central dark-matter densities of the dSph suggest that in this
picture the dSph evolved from higher amplitude density uctuations greater than 3 which
collapsed and virialised at high redshift 1  z  20 cf Evrard 1989 The dSph would then
be the most ancient galaxies They are also relatively close to the Galaxy and highly clustered
which may be consistent the statistics of density peaks Kaiser 1984 Bardeen et al 1986
The very dense individual dark halos of the dSph would retain their identity even within the
outer dark matter halo of the Milky Way Thus this model 3 dwarfs in CDM is dynamically
self-consistent The low stellar densities would result from galactic winds In this model stars
are born at normal densities and then expand in response to mass loss driven by winds and
supernovae from massive stars although the details remain to be calculated In particular it
is very hard to understand why the dissipationless stellar population should have expanded in
response to gas loss while the dark matter remained dense
42 Baryonic Dark Matter
Alternatively the high densities inferred for the dSph dark matter could be an indication
of dissipation consistent with the dark matter being baryonic Lake 1990b The recent identi-
cation of gold-plated candidate micro-lensing events in lines-of-sight towards to the Magellanic
Clouds interpreted as lensing of background stars in the Clouds by foreground dark objects
in our Galaxy Alcock et al 1993 Aubourg et al 1993 consistent with lensing by objects
with sub-solar mass has revitalised interest in brown dwarfs as halo dark matter However this
would require that the stellar IMF at the time of dark halo formation were very dierent from
the present-day IMF and indeed dierent from the IMF of the stellar halo which appears to
show a downturn below a few tenths of a solar mass much like the disk Dahn 1994 It may be
that the lensing events observed are more like those seen towards the Galactic bulge Udalski et
al 1993 which are believed due to normal low mass stars and that both lens and source are
in the Clouds Further deep K-band imaging of high latitude elds has failed to nd evidence
for faint red stellar objects Hu et al 1994 as have observations with Hubble Space Telescope
Bahcall et al 1994 Baryonic dark matter playing a dominant role in dSph would have the
further requirement that the IMF be variable from dSph to dSph
Larson 1987 has suggested that an IMF biased towards massive stars could self-
consistently provide dark remnants and also provide self-enrichment to give a correlation between
ML and FeH which has an uncertain observational status in the Galactic dSph However as
above quite how the dark matter remains dense while the stars become diuse is unclear This
problem is exacerbated by the need to prevent too much enrichment from the massive stars
which requires very signicant gas loss many times that of the mass left behind This must
occur on a timescale which is rapid compared to the star formation rate but slow compared
to the internal crossing time to avoid unbinding the system Thus dSph with no evidence for
extended star formation are particularly dicult in this scenario
A skew in the IMF rather than truncation which would further excacerbate potential
problems with unbinding the system should be detectable from the value of the ratios of alpha-
capture elements to iron peak elements from Type II supernovae Wyse and Gilmore 1992
This eect reects the variation of oxygen and other nucleosynthetic yields with supernova
progenitor masses For example a slope with power law index atter by unity from the IMF
in the solar neighborhood produces enhancements in oxygen relative to iron that is perhaps a
factor of three higher than that seen already a factor of three above solar in the halo stars in
the solar neighborhood Wyse and Gilmore 1992
Note that in the lowest mass gas-rich galaxies for which good rotation curve data exist
there is an apparent relationship between the gravitational eld and the HI gas This manifests
itself in the sense that the observed rotation curve is a scaled version of the rotation curve one
would derive from the HI alone Puche and Carignan 1991 A similar eect is also seen in the
outer parts of massive galaxies Bosma 1982 One is tempted to conclude that like the HI the
halo dark matter is indeed baryonic Gallagher 1990 consistent with indications from Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis that a large fraction of baryons are dark Walker et al 1991 and indeed just
the amount of dark matter inferred on the scale of galactic halos However it should be noted
that the recent detection of unexpectedly large amounts of deuterium in a quasar absorption
line system by Songaila et al
1994 and by Carswell et al
1994 would if conrmed by
observations of other systems make ubiquitous baryonic dark-matter haloes impossible
43 No Dark Matter NDM
The possibility that dSph do not contain the dark matter inferred from the analyses of
the velocity data could arise in two ways Firstly the internal orbital motions of the expected
population of binary stars  found to be ubiquitous at the 30 level in all normal stellar systems
 will cause a zero point oset in the observed velocity dispersion The long-period binaries could
provide a contribution of a few kms to the dispersion which is very dicult to remove compared
to the more obvious higher orbital motion outliers However this is uncomfortably close to the
amplitude required to remove the need for dark matter once subtracted o from the observed
velocity distribution to obtain the center of mass motions of the binaries in the potential well of
the dSph Indeed Suntze et al
1993 nd that a binary fraction of 25 in giant stars with
periods between 1yr and 1000 yr is sucient to increase the velocity dispersion to observed
values even given a true ML of only 3 as seen in normal old stellar populations This eect
needs careful modelling Mathieu 1985 Suntze et al 1993 Hargreaves et al 1994
Secondly it is not rmly established that the dSph with very high inferred ML ratios
are in virial equilibrium In this case there may be no dark matter NDM and the dissolution
timescale is the critical parameter  it cannot be too short For example in this interpretation
present observations would suggest that 39 of the dSph companions to the Milky Way would
be in the process of coming apart presumably due to tidal stresses and so without a steady
source of dSph we require that the dissolution time be greater than 25 of the age of the
stellar populations of the dSph  or 
 5 Gyr Furthermore the association of apparently high
ML values with the cores of dSph galaxies exacerbates this diculty While these problems
are somewhat ameliorated if some dSph are not bound to the Galaxy the problem of supply of
dSph remains Also unanswered in this model is the origins of marginally-bound galaxies with
ultra-low stellar densities
The NDM model is in principle feasible because most models predict that the dissolution
of marginally bound dSph will not be sudden Lynden-Bell 1982b noted that the major axes
of the stellar bodies of many dSph galaxies may align with their orbits as predicted for galaxies
that are being tidally distorted This eect has been nicely illustrated by McGlynn 1990 in
his Figure 2c Since particles which become unbound have low positive energies they thus
only slowly drift away from their distressed parent galaxy As discussed in a slightly dierent
context by Tremaine 1993 a tidally disrupted object will spread out into a tidal stream of
length s determined by the spread in orbital frequency over the size of the object After time
t the size of the remnant relative to the radius of the satellite at which tidal stripping began
is sRsatellite   t where  is the angular frequency of a circular orbit at the galactocentric
radius where satellite was disrupted For disruption at 50 kpc after 1 Gyr the satellite is
spread out to only four times its original size As mentioned above CDM models lead to
the expectation of signicant phase-space structure in the Milky Way remnants of disrupted
subsystems which may have been observed as halo moving groups eg Arnold and Gilmore
1992 The disruption model for the Galactic dSph system promoted by Kuhn 1993 cannot
be dismissed out-of-hand but also does not address the questions of how these galaxies initially
formed the origins of high core ML values and why they now have such low central stellar
densities However it is clear that at least the Sagittarius dwarf and Ursa Minor show evidence
for on-going tidal stretchingdisruption as discussed above
An objection to this model that is often raised concerns the supply of dSph since unless
there is both creation and destruction we are observing the dSph at a privileged epoch However
there may indeed be a source of dSph in the interaction between the Milky Way and companions
As noted earlier the dSph and the Magellanic Clouds are not uniformly located on the sky but
occupy two great circles Kunkel and Demers 1976 Lynden-Bell 1982ab This suggests a tidal-
debris origin  the break-up of the Greater Magellanic Galaxy and some other now-defunct
companion galaxy  for the dSph This model has several attractive features i It directly
addresses the non-random spatial distribution of the known Galactic dSph ii Objects that
are plausibly self-gravitating dwarf galaxies have been found in the process of formation in both
observed and numerical model tidal-tails Barnes and Hernquist 1992 Mirabel Dottori and
Lutz 1992 iii This model naturally gives velocity dispersions for dSph that are close to the
10 kms HI velocity dispersion of typical galactic disks iv This will yield low-density galaxies
Gerola Carnevali and Salpeter 1983
One has still to explain possible problem areas such as why there are no dSph of the
metallicity of the LMC the internal kinematics which seems to require dark matter in the more
distant dSph companions of the Milky Way and the large range of star formation ages
5 DWARF SPHEROIDAL GALAXIES BEYOND THE MILKY WAY
51 The Andromeda dSph Galaxies
The Galactic family of dSph galaxies is not unique Van den Bergh 1972a 1972b
discovered four candidate dSph galaxies near the M31 galaxy one of which And IV turned out
to be a star cluster in the M31 disk Jones 1993 The remaining three galaxies And I And II
and And III have been shown by Caldwell et al 1992 to be structurally similar to Galactic
dSph in terms of optical scale lengths luminosities and surface brightnesses see Figure 4
The parallel between properties of Galactic and M31 dSph also extends to stellar popu-
lation characteristics These galaxies are like those associated with the Milky Way in showing
no very recent star formation but a range in stellar ages And I is dominated by an old stellar
population Mould and Kristian 1990 while And II Aaronson et al 1985 and And III Ar-
mandro et al 1993 contain AGB stars that are indicators of small intermediate age several
Gyr stellar populations The improved photometry for And I and And III of Caldwell et al
provide estimates of the total luminosity that place the Andomeda dSph on the luminosity-
metallicity relationship dened by the Galactic dSph as does And II Konig et al 1993 Konig
et al 1993 also show that there exists signicant spread in the metallicity of the giant branch
in And II as may be expected from the inferred age spread
By their very existence the Andromeda dSph immediately show that the dSph cannot
be produced by a very rare process Even though surveys for dSph are still not fully complete
around M31 it evidently is poorer in dSph than the Milky Way despite its larger bulge close
diuse dwarf E companions NGC 205 and NGC 185 and ongoing interaction with M32 That
the M31 dSph follow a similar luminosity-metallicity relationship as the Milky Way systems
albeit for only two objects and with considerable scatteralso suggests that the evolution of
the stellar populations is likely to be largely controlled by internal processes For example if
dSph were produced by galactic wind sweeping of small companion galaxies or by the break-up
of a larger system then the metallicity-luminosity relationship could well dier between host
galaxies What is not known is whether the M31 dSph show any evidence for dense dark matter
and whether like their Milky Way cousins a range in ML exists
52 Independent dSph Galaxies
As we move further away from the Milky Way there is naturally less information about
any class of galaxy This is an especially severe problem for the dSph systems due to their
small sizes and extremely low surface brightnesses These objects are challenging to nd and
study as companions to M31 and indeed even in the extended Milky Way system However the
Tucana Dwarf has been suggested to be a distant isolated dSph by Lavery and Mighell 1992
who interpreted their color-magnitude diagram as being that of a dSph galaxy at a distance of
about 1 Mpc These results are conrmed by deep images taken by Seitzer et al 1994 with
the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescope and thus the Tucana Dwarf
demonstrates that dSph galaxies can exist as independent entities not physically associated
with any large galaxy
In addition there exist fascinating low-luminosity galaxies which have mixed dIrrdSph
traits Within the Local Group of galaxies the dwarf system LGS3 presents an interesting
example of a possible transition object LGS3 is not near any giant systems shows no evidence
for HII regions which would indicate the presence of ongoing large scale star formation Hunter
et al 1993 but yet contains little HI M HI  106M Lo Sargent and Young 1993 Thus
LGS3 seems to be a near-dSph possibly approaching the stellar fossil phase of its life Perhaps
closer to the dSph systems is the Phoenix dwarf which is a low-surface-brightness galaxy with
even less HI Carignan Demers and Cote 1991 and a dSph-like stellar population with a few
younger stars included van de Rydt Demers and Kunkel 1991 The distance estimate of
van de Rydt et al for Phoenix places this galaxy at a distance comparable to M31 such that
it is not bound to a major galaxy However this estimate is based on correctly identifying
the evolutionary state and hence luminosity of resolved red stars and may very well be an
underestimate So perhaps we are seeing some evidence that the nal step in becoming a pure
dSph galaxies takes longer in isolated systems than in dwarfs which are companions to giants
a point which can be explored as the statistics on faint galaxies in the Local Group improve in
coming years van den Bergh 1994ab
The extensive studies of diuse dwarf E galaxies in the Virgo cluster also have begun
to give partial answers to these issues eg Binggeli and Cameron 1991 Photometry of
these galaxies suggest that the diuse dwarf E and dSph galaxies may lie on the same surface
brightnessluminosity relationship see Bender et al 1993 although for such low brightness
galaxies selection eects are a major concern Phillipps Davies and Disney 1988 In addition
both classes of galaxies can be t with exponential radial brightness proles often have low ro-
tation velocities for their observed degree of attening Bender and Nieto 1990 and likely have
similar luminosity-metallicity correlations Kormendy and Bender 1994 use new observations
of Virgo Cluster ellipticals to strengthen this connection They suggest that dwarf diuse Es
and dSphs are not only a single structural class but that this class should be called the dwarf
spheroidals Sandage and Homan 1991 present a related argument for parallelism between
dE and dSph systems in discussing the existence of Phoenix dwarf-like transition morphology
galaxies which sit between the dwarf irregular and dwarf diuse ES0 classes Physically the
dEdSph galaxy family can be attributed to similar evolutionary processes in which mass loss
has been a key ingredient Binggeli 1994
6 CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
Dwarf spheroidal galaxies present a nearby albeit dim challenge to current ideas about
the formation and evolution of galaxies The signicance of these objects will become clearer
within the next few years as new observations yield better information on their most fundamental
properties An outline of some possibilities is given in Table 3 We can therefore look forward
to expanding our knowledge of the dSph in several key areas
1 The dark matter issue is critical to understanding the true nature of the dSph
galaxies This issue contains several unresolved questions First we have not yet rigorously
shown that the nearer dSph galaxies are in dynamical equilibrium Until we can establish
the dynamical states of the dSph we will not know if or how much dark matter is required
If some dSph systems are indeed now dissolving then we should also search for ultra- low
surface brightness clouds or moving groups of stars which could mark the presence of previously
disrupted Galactic dSph galaxies Freeman 1990 Arnold and Gilmore 1992 Zinn 1993 Majewski
Indeed the best indications that the Galaxy has been caught in the act of eating a
companion galaxy have come from radial velocity surveys Ibata Gilmore and Irwin 1994
At the other extreme conventional equilibrium dynamical models of the Draco and Ursa
Minor galaxies require very high densities of dark matter If the dark matter in these objects
is non-baryonic then the high densities imply very early formation times see Peebles 1989 for
this argument and the dSph could well be the oldest class of galaxy Yet high densities could
also be due to dissipative processes and therefore a sign that this dark matter is baryonic It is
too early to draw broad conclusions about the nature of non-baryonic dark matter on the basis
of properties of Galactic dSph galaxies alone
2 The non-random distribution of the Galactic retinue of dSph satellites may be a prime
clue of the origins of these systems As emphasized by Lynden-Bell 1982ab and more recently
by Majewski 1994 this pattern is suggestive of the production of dSph galaxies via the tidal
disruption of larger systems In this model it is hard to see how the remnants would retain very
high densities of non-baryonic dark matter We therefore place a high priority on determining
if the two great circles of Galactic dSph systems represents a physical association eg through
searches for dSph galaxies located elsewhere around the Milky Way and via proper motion
measurements to determine orbital directions for especially the nearer dSph systems As always
with the dSphs nothing is simple and the radial velocity data already defy any straightforward
model for the orbital distributions
3 Some the basic properties of the dSphs such as metallicity and presence of an inter-
mediate age population may correlate with Galactocentric distance DG Silk Wyse and Shields
1987 This is puzzling in view of the radial velocity data which suggest that the dSph are not
on high angular momentum orbits that cover small ranges in DG The crossing times for these
orbits are short and so we might expect that even if radial gradients were introduced during
the formation of dSph galaxies they would have been rapidly reduced by orbital mixing Better
data are needed to dene the signicance of radial trends in the properties of Galactic dSph
systems and this should include comparisons between the properties of Galactic and external
dSph galaxies Armandro et al 1993
4 Many Galactic dSph satellites have had complicated evolutionary histories Although
these dSph galaxies have low densities and tiny escape velocities even if dark matter is present
they have a range in either stellar metallicities or ages Both features require the host galaxy to
have been inuenced by multiple generations of stars in contrast to the single stellar generations
found in most Galactic globular star clusters The kinds of processes responsible for these
evolutionary complexities can be revealed as new measurements dene the properties of the
main sequence luminosity functions in the nearest dSph companions to the Milky Way Similarly
abundance determinations of iron peak elements which have an important source in long-lived
Type Ia supernovae versus elements such as O Mg or Si which are predominantly formed
in Type II supernovae will enhance our understanding of the way in which the dSph became
polluted to modest levels with met als
5 We are in one way indeed observing the dSph at a special epoch Although several
dSph supported star formation as recently as perhaps 3 Gyr in the past none of the dSph are
thought to currently be capable of producing new stars It is therefore important to understand
why these galaxies have dropped out of the league of star forming galaxies on a time scale that
is only a fraction of the cosmic time In this regard the possible existence or not of a reservoir
of proto-dSph is a critical issue It may be that this special epoch is related to the collapse of
bound groups of galaxies cf Silk Wyse and Shields 1987 in which case the existence or not
of isolated dSph is crucial
6 Study of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way will elucidate the formation and evo-
lution of the Milky Way itself and hence that of typical spiral galaxies Hierarchical-clustering
scenarios of galaxy formation lead naturally to a synthesis of the ideas presented by Eggen
Lynden-Bell and Sandage 1962 whereby the stellar halo formed during a rapid monolithic
collapse phase and by Searle and Zinn 1978 whereby an extended more chaotic accretion
phase formed the stellar halo

FIGURE CAPTIONS
FIG 1This print is from a IIIaJ plate taken with the Kitt Peak 4-m Mayall telescope as part
of an ongoing astrometric program It shows the diuse cloud of stars which mark the main
body of the Ursa Minor dSph The orientation is north up and east to the left a more detailed
nding image can be found in Cudworth et al 1986 The dSph galaxies are dicult to detect
when individual stars are unresolved due to their very low optical surface brightnesses and yet
the optical may be the best waveband for nding this type of purely stellar galaxy Courtesy
of K Cudworth Yerkes Observatory
FIG 2Shown above is the mean radial stellar density prole for the Ursa Minor dSph as pre-
sented by Hargreaves et al 1994 copyright 1994 Royal Astronomical Society reproduced
with permission on the basis of measurements by M Irwin and D Hatzidimitriou in prepara-
tion with the Cambridge APM The solid line is a King model t which shows a core and outer
tidal cut-o with a possible excess of stars The dotted line is an exponential prole t

This plot clearly shows a well-dened giant branch RGB an asymptotic giant branch AGB
horizontal branch HB including the RR Lyrae variables red clump and main sequence turno
This type of CMD results from a mixture of old and intermediate age stellar populations as
outlined by the descriptive guide in the lower panel of the gure
FIG 4This CCD image shows the And I dSph Structurally And I resembles both the Galactic
dSph systems and fainter non-nucleated dE galaxies found in the Virgo Cluster of galaxies

Notes DG is the Galactocentric distance in kpc 0 is central surface brightness in V magsquare
arcsec Vr is the Galactocentric radial velocity in kms and v is the observed stellar velocity
dispersion in kms Distances and radial velocities are from Zaritsky et al 1989 except for
Leo II Lee et al 1993 Sagittarius Ibata Gilmore and Irwin 1994 and Sextans Irwin et
al 1990 da Costa et al 1991 The MV are from van den Bergh 1992 with the exceptions
of the Sagittarius dwarf Ibata Gilmore and Irwin 1994 and Leo II Demers and Irwin 1993
small dierences are found in tabluations of MV but given the uncertainties of typically 03 mag
for measurements of these low-surface-brightness systems eg see Hodge 1982 da Costa et al
1991 these dominate over most of the stated distance uncertainties The surface brightness of
the Sagittarius dwarf is taken from Mateo et al
1994 Abundances are from the literature
and include results from spectroscopy of individual stars eg Lehnert et al 1992 and deriva-
tions based on giant branch properties eg Lee et al 1993 Stellar population ages are our
assessments based on the current literature where stellar populations with ages of  10 Gyr are
classied as intermediate age

Explanation and notes
Table entries refer to important I or critical C observations Deep Ptm includes imaging to
faint levels such as is planned with the HST Surveys are wide angle studies Multi- Wavlength
includes radio radio infrared VUV and other types of measurements Spectra are high and
low spectral resolution for stars and Prop Motion are absolute proper motion determinations
The objectives are 1 Find more examples of dSph galaxies around the Milky Way and in the
nearby universe 2 Measure radial stellar surface density proles and shapes 3 Determine
internal radial velocity distribution functions versus radius 4 Undertake surveys for ionized
neutral and molecular gas including circumstellar ejecta 5 Stellar metallicity determinations
including abundance ratios for key elements which are sensitive to the nucleosynthesis history
6 Ages of stars and 7 Orbits for individual Galactic dSph systems
