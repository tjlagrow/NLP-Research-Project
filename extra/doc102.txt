ABSTRACT
We study the evolution of disc galaxies in group environments under the eect of
both the global tidal eld and close-encounters between galaxies using controlled N -
body simulations of isolated mergers We nd that close-range encounters between
galaxies are less frequent and less damaging to disc galaxies than originally expected
since they mostly occur when group members have lost a signicant fraction of their
initial mass to tidal stripping We also nd that group members mostly aect disc
galaxies indirectly by modifying their common global tidal eld Dierent initial orbital
parameters of group members introduce a signicant scatter in the evolution of
general properties of disc galaxies around a median evolution that is similar to
when only the eect of the global tidal eld is included Close-encounters introduce a
high variability in the properties of disc galaxies even slowing their evolution in some
cases and could wash out correlations between galaxy properties and the group total
mass The combined eect of the global tidal eld and close-encounters appears to be
inecient at formingenhancing central stellar bulges This implies that bulges of S0
galaxies should be mostly composed by young stars which is consistent with recent
observations

INTRODUCTION
Galaxies experience dierent environments during their life-
times inhabiting regions of the Universe ranging in density
from average to medium and high in environments such
as groups and clusters of galaxies eg Lacey  Cole 1994
Zhao et al 2003 Berrier et al 2009 McGee et al 2009
In these regions galaxies evolve under the inuence
of a combination of environmental and internal processes
Galaxies infalling onto a halo experience the eects of the
global tidal eld of their host eg Gnedin 2003 which
can vary gradually in intensity along their orbits or more
abruptly if the halo grows rapidly or the galaxys stellar
mass grows signicantly after accretion eg Neistein et al
2011 Galaxies can also experience gravitational interac-
tions with other halo galaxies or substructures in the form
of direct mergers or close-encounters with lowhigh relative
velocity Moore et al 1996 Mastropietro et al 2005 For
galaxies in dense environments both the cold and hot re-
 villalobosoatsinafit
serves of gas can be removed hydrodynamically by the hot-
ter intra-group or intra-cluster medium via processes such
as ram-pressure stripping Gunn  Gott 1972 and starva-
tion Larson et al 1980 Balogh et al 2009 which can limit
severely the capacity of galaxies to continue forming stars
after accretion Internal galactic processes such as gas cool-
ing star formation supernovae feedback active nuclei feed-
back formation of central bars also aect the evolution of
galaxies and their contributions can be triggeredaected by
environmental factors
Environmental eects are believed to play a crucial role
in the evolution of galaxies in dense regions of the Universe
However the precise mechanisms through which they aect
galaxies remain unclear see the review by Weinmann et al
2011 They are thought to be the culprits behind the lower
star formation lower fraction of disc morphologies and red-
der colours observed in galaxies belonging to groups and
clusters in comparison to regions of lower density eg
Dressler et al 1997 Lewis et al 2002 Gomez et al 2003
Balogh et al 2004 Weinmann et al 2006 McGee et al

Recent studies based on cosmological simulations com-
bined with semi-analytic models claim that a signi-
cant fraction of galaxies that currently reside in mas-
sive clusters have been accreted as part of galaxy groups
McGee et al 2009 De Lucia et al 2012 but see also
Berrier et al 2009 These results emphasise the concept
of galactic pre-processing Zabludo  Mulchaey 1998
Lisker et al 2013 In this scenario a considerable fraction
of galaxies observed at present time in clusters have had
most of their properties shaped within group environments
This highlights the importance of understanding in detail
the role of the environment in the evolution of galaxies
within groups
However theoretical studies on environmental eects
within galaxy groups remain surprisingly few while most
of the theoretical eort has been largely focused on galax-
ies residing in either massive clusters eg Moore et al 1999
Gnedin 2003 Mastropietro et al 2005 or in Milky Way-like
haloes eg Mayer et al 2001ab Klimentowski et al 2009
Kazantzidis et al 2011 Most of the recent studies on the
evolution of galaxies in group-like environments by means
of observations or numerical simulations Feldmann et al
2011 Tonnesen  Cen 2012 Bahe et al 2013 Bekki
2013 Taranu et al 2013 Vijayaraghavan  Ricker 2013
Wetzel et al 2013 Ziparo et al 2014 have concentrated on
the formation of elliptical galaxies the eect of ram-pressure
stripping on galaxies by the intergalactic medium and on
the eciency of galaxies to form stars while they inhabit
a group Interestingly little attention has been paid to un-
derstand better the relative contribution of dierent envi-
ronmental and environmentally-triggered processes eg
driven by the global tidal eld close-encounters between
galaxies rapid halo growth to the overall evolution of galax-
ies in groups This is a fundamental step in order to com-
prehend how galaxies currently residing in massive clusters
have been pre-processed
Close-encounters between galaxies are considered one
of the main contributors to their evolution Within groups
these encounters take place at lower relative velocity with
respect to interactions within more massive clusters Given
the long duration of the gravitational perturbation galaxy
close-encounters in groups can induce signicant changes in
the structure of galaxies
Bekki  Couch 2011 investigate the combined eect
of the global tidal eld of groups and repetitive close-
encounters on the evolution of spiral galaxies using chemo-
dynamical simulations They nd that the combined tidal
interaction can have a signicant impact on the morphol-
ogy of galaxies inducing series of bursts of star formation
that increase the stellar mass in the central bulges These
results suggest that groups are suitable environments where
S0 galaxies can be formed in line with implications from ob-
servational evidence Wilman et al 2009 Just et al 2010
As mentioned above however the relative contribution
of the global tidal eld and close-encounters to the gen-
eral evolution of galaxies in groups remains unclear Group
members except the galaxy under study are usually mod-
elled as point mass objects In addition the use of stan-
dard Schechter functions for the stellar mass distribution
of group members does not allow the evolution that group
members experience in terms of their orbits structure and
mass content to be followed consistently starting from stel-
lar masses consistent with recent observations Moreover
by adopting a signicantly higher number of group mem-
bers in comparison to observations as done for example in
Bekki  Couch 2011 the contribution of close-encounters
to galaxy evolution could be largely overestimated All these
factors are potentially relevant for the way galaxies interact
with each other and perhaps more importantly for how
galaxies might also aect the environment they inhabit In
groups the co-evolution between a single galaxy and its envi-
ronment should be more signicant than in clusters because
of its larger contribution to the total mass of the environ-
ment see Aceves et al 2013
In the previous paper of this series Villalobos et al
2012 we explore the evolution of disc galaxies within the
global tidal eld of a galaxy group by means of N -body sim-
ulations of isolated mergers covering an ample parameter
space of dierent orbits disc inclinations galaxy-to-group
mass ratios and presence of a central bulge We nd that
the galaxy-to-group mass ratio and the initial inclination of
disc galaxies at the time of accretion play a fundamental role
in the evolution of galaxies within a group see also Bekki
2013 Specically we nd that disc galaxies start suering
signicant evolution due to the global tidal eld only af-
ter the mean density of the group within the orbit of the
galaxy exceeds 031 times the disc galaxy central density
Dierent inclinations of disc galaxies at the time of accre-
tion cause them to experience signicantly dierent struc-
tural evolution In particular retrograde infalls inclination
of 180 with respect of their orbital plane allow accreted
galaxies to retain their initial disc structure for a signi-
cantly longer time in comparison to prograde infalls incli-
nation of 0 Additionally we nd that the global tidal eld
of a group environment is not ecient at either inducing the
formation of central bulges in stellar discs or enhancing ex-
isting ones at the time of accretion This result suggests
that the global tidal eld alone cannot explain the forma-
tion of S0 galaxies in groups and that additional processes
eg close-encounters internal processes are required to
explain the formation of additional bulge stars Finally we
nd that more massive galaxies suer more tidal stripping
due to the fact that the stronger dynamical friction acting
on them drags them rapidly to the densest region of the
group where they are exposed to stronger tidal forces
In this paper we present the results of controlled N -
body simulations of infalling disc galaxies as they are ac-
creted onto a group-size halo that contains a central galaxy
and a population of satellite galaxies We explore dier-
ent orbital parameters consistent with cosmological sim-
ulations for the infalling disc galaxy and various spatial
velocity and mass distributions for the population of satel-
lite galaxies Our main goal is to determine the contribution
of low-velocity close-encounters to the evolution of galaxies
within a group environment Our approach is to compare
simulations of the combined inuence of global tidal eld
and close-encounters to simulations where only the inuence
of the global tidal eld is included
As in the rst paper of this series our group environ-
ments are built from idealised initial conditions and do not
account for hierarchical growth In particular our simula-
tions do not consider cases where galaxies are accreted and
evolve as part of sub-haloes within a group halo1 Note
also that our simulations do not include gaseous compo-
nents and star formation since we focus on the eect of
close-encounters and the group tidal eld on the stellar
content of galaxies that is already present at the time they
are accreted onto a group environment We plan to explore
the eect of internal processes and the evolution of star for-
mation in galaxies within groups in the next paper of this
series
The layout of this paper is as follows Section 2 describes
the set-up of our experiments Section 3 describes our nd-
ings in Section 4 we discuss our results and in Section 5 we
give our conclusions
2 SET-UP OF NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
We have carried out 113 simulations of isolated mergers be-
tween a disc galaxy and a group halo containing a popula-
tion of galaxies Our basic setup is to release a single disc
galaxy at a time on a bound orbit from the virial radius
of the larger halo exploring its evolution for 12 Gyr As the
galaxy infalls toward the central region of the halo dragged
by dynamical friction it suers the eects of both the global
tidal eld of the group and also of close-encounters with
other galaxies within the group Each simulation generates
192 snapshots which allow us to follow accurately the orbits
mass stripping and overall evolution of each galaxy
21 Initialisation of multi-component systems
The group halo in our simulations is modelled as a N -
body self-consistent multi-component system composed by a
DM halo that follows a NFW density prole Navarro et al
1997 and a central stellar spheroid following a Hernquist
density prole Hernquist 1990 Our main haloes have a to-
tal mass of 1013M following the the mass range reported
by McGee et al 2009 and De Lucia et al 2012 where
signicant environmental eects on galaxies must take place
see also Berrier et al 2009 Additionally a population of
galaxies are embedded in the group halo which are also com-
posed by both a NFW halo and a central stellar component
following a Hernquist prole In the rest of the paper we
refer to these galaxies as group members or group popu-
lation Each disc galaxy is modelled as a multi-component
system with a NFW DM halo a stellar disc following an
exponential radial density prole and a sech2 vertical den-
sity prole In some experiments we also include a Hern-
quist central stellar bulge A detailed description of the pro-
cedure followed to initialise our systems can be found in
Villalobos  Helmi 2008
We have carried out preliminary tests to ensure the sta-
bility of each system and lack of evolution due to either
particle or time resolution
1 De Lucia et al 2012 estimate that about half of low 9 
logMM  10 and intermediate 10  logMM  11
mass group members are accreted onto their nal group when
they are satellite galaxies The remaining half being accreted
while being central galaxies or isolated ones

22 Number of group members
The number of group members in our simulations has been
chosen to be consistent with observations of the average
number of satellite galaxies found in haloes in the mass range
131  log Mhalo  133 and with 01Mr  5 log h  19 re-
spectively from the SDSS-DR4 z 02 Yang et al 2008
The most likely number of satellite members within these
limits is found to be 3 We have however chosen to con-
sider 4 satellite galaxies in our simulations in order to max-
imise the number of close-encounters and their eect on the
disc galaxy We have also explored the eect of 8 satellite
galaxies in our simulations
23 Stellar and DM mass content of group
members and disc galaxies
The initial stellar mass of each group member has been ran-
domly drawn from the conditional stellar mass function of
satellite galaxies average number of galaxies as a function of
galaxy stellar mass in a DM halo of a given mass obtained
from SDSS-DR4 observations Yang et al 2009 This cor-
responds to a modied Schechter function

The stellar mass of the disc galaxy is chosen to be com-
parable to that of the Milky Ways stellar disc
For simplicity the same DM-to-stellar mass ratio is used
for the disc galaxy and group members 401 However in
our simulations group members are initialised to resemble a
galaxy population on their way to relax within the group
halo as opposed to an infalling galaxy population To this
aim haloes of group members are initialised with half the
DM mass corresponding to their stellar mass ie with an
eective DM-to-stellar mass ratio 201 having eective
radii that are also half their respective virial radii This is
based on our previous study of the eect of the global tidal
eld of groups on galaxies Villalobos et al 2012 see also
Chang et al 2013 which shows that infalling galaxies lose
approximately half of their DM content after the rst peri-
centric passage about the group centre
Our tests show that larger and smaller DM-to-stellar
mass ratios for group members compared to the chosen
one lead to fewer and weaker close-encounters respectively
More massive group members are aected more eciently
by dynamical friction which causes them to sink earlier than
the disc galaxy This leaves little time for close-encounters to
take place On the other hand since less massive group mem-
bers are less aected by dynamical friction they have longer
infall times with respect to the disc galaxy Even though this
leaves plenty of time for close-encounters they are generally
weak and cause little damage to the disc galaxy
24 Initial orbital parameters of group members
and disc galaxies
The orbital positions and velocities of group members are
assigned after randomly replacing particles of the group DM
halo with the multi-component N -body systems described
1010 M
1010 M
Labels follow a nomenclature that indicates the number of
group members 48 the relative total DMstars mass en-
closed adding all group members 12 and the relative distri-
bution of stellar mass in group members with respect to the
stellar disc This can be either less LO or more massive HI
or balanced BA MDM Mstars Rvir and astars indicate the
DM mass stellar mass virial radius and Hernquist scalelength
of the stellar component for each group member DM haloes
and stellar spheroids are modelled with 105 and 104 parti-
cles respectively The actual DM mass with which each group
member is initialised corresponds to half the values listed see
Section 2
above As a rst approximation this is consistent with ob-
servations eg Lin et al 2004 Biviano  Poggianti 2010
showing that the projected number density of galaxies in
clusters can be described with NFW density proles
Following this procedure the spatial distribution of
group members populates randomly the volume of the group
halo However we apply a set of conditions to the ran-
dom choice of initial positions and respective velocities for
group members in order to avoid that they are initialised
too close to each other to the disc galaxy to the cen-
tre of the group or outside the virial radius of the group
Specically the initial orbital position Ri and respective
velocity for the ith-group member is assigned only if all
of the following conditions are simultaneously satised i
Rij  Re

group where Rij
Ridisc is the separation between the centres of mass of
the i-th and j-th group member disc galaxy and Re

Before placing a group member at its assigned position
a spherical volume containing an equivalent amount of DM
mass is locally removed from the group halo in order to keep
constant the total amount of mass of the system within the
virial radius of the group Our tests show that this removal
of DM mass from the group halo does not cause signicant
or long-lasting perturbations to its radial density prole
As in Villalobos et al 2012 the initial orbital param-
eters of the disc galaxy are chosen to be consistent with the
distribution of orbital parameters of infalling substructures
at the time they cross the virial radius of their parent halo as
extracted from cosmological simulations eg Benson 2005
25 Parameter space coverage
Tables 1 and 2 show a list of the structural kinematical and
numerical properties of the group halo and disc galaxy used
in our simulations Note that with respect to our previous
simulations on the eect of the global tidal eld of groups
on galaxies we have chosen a comparatively smaller group
halo for the disc galaxy under study This deliberate choice
has been taken in order to maximise the frequency andor
eectivity of close-encounters within the group halo and
their eect on the disc galaxy
Our experiments cover a parameter space related to sev-
eral properties of the disc galaxy and of the population of
group members that are potentially relevant for the evo-
lution of the disc galaxy under the combined eect of the
global tidal eld and close-encounters
For the disc galaxy we explore both prograde and ret-
rograde infalling orbits with respect to its direction of ro-
tation the most likely and extreme infall eccentricities ac-
cording to cosmological simulations and the eect of a cen-
tral stellar bulge see Table 3
Regarding the population of group members we probe
the eect of dierent number of members total mass and
mass distribution see Table 4
In our simulations we explore combinations of one as-
pect of the parameter space related to the disc galaxy and
one related to the population of group members in all exper-
iments the same group halo is used Additionally for each
combination we explore 12 dierent initial orbital distribu-
tions ie initial positions and velocities for the group mem-
bers satisfying the conditions described in Section 24 We
also perform control simulations only with the group halo
and disc galaxy group members are not included aiming
to assess the net eect of close-encounters on the evolution
of the infalling disc galaxy Following the labels introduced
in Tables 3 and 4 we refer to a given experiment using the
following notation ddd for the control simulation ex-
ploring a parameter of the disc galaxy dddgggggg for a
combination of parameters of the disc galaxy and the group
population and regarding all 12 initial orbital distributions
explored for group members When a specic initial or-
bital distribution of group members needs to be referenced
a postx n is added as dddggggggn Eg the experiment
REF4g1tBA refers to the disc galaxy infalling with the most
likely orbital eccentricity onto a group with a population of
group members composed by 4 satellite galaxies with a rel-
ative total mass equals to 1 and a balanced stellar mass
distribution with respect to the stellar disc
It is important to highlight that the total mass in all
Close-encounters in a group environment
experiments is kept approximately constant 1013M to
facilitate the comparison with the control simulations
3 RESULTS
31 General properties of galactic encounters
In this paper we dene an encounter between the main disc
galaxy and a group member as a local minimum in the radial
separation between their centres of mass while both orbit
within the group environment Encounters are only regis-
tered while both the disc galaxy and a given group member
retain more than 5 percent of their initial stellar mass In
this way a disc galaxy can experience several encounters
with a single group member before either of their stellar
components is disrupted
Fig 1 shows an overview of the general properties of
235 encounters that the disc galaxy experiences with group
members combining all 12 simulations covering dierent
initial spatial distributions of group members for the ex-
periment with the most likely disc galaxys infalling orbit
REF4g1tBA experiment
We nd that most encounters happen relatively late in
our experiments with a most likely time of occurrence of
t6 Gyr This suggests that encounters take place mostly
after both the main disc galaxy and group members have
suered considerable mass stripping during their infalling
orbits which limits the damage caused by encounters on
the disc galaxy Note that a smaller fraction of encoun-
ters take place early in the simulations at t1 Gyr This
is due to the random assignment of the initial velocities
which puts galaxies preferentially on radially inward orbits
increasing the probability of encounters in the inner regions
of the group
We nd that the range of radial separation between a
disc galaxy and other group members during encounters is
rather broad reaching distances of 400 kpc However the
most likely radial separation during encounters is found at
50 kpc This is  25 times the scale-length of disc galaxies
at the most likely time of occurrence of encounters Very-
close encounters 20 kpc and in particular mergers be-
tween galaxies are either rare or non-existent in our simula-
tions This is in contradiction with the common assumption
that these events are frequent in the environment of groups
See Discussion
The distribution of relative radial velocity between
galaxies during encounters peaks around 500-600 km s1
This shows that encounters are still relatively fast in compar-
ison to the relative radial velocity expected in more massive
clusters 1000 km s1 The most likely relative velocity of
encounters in our simulations is consistent with estimations
of the characteristic velocity dispersion of the group halo
when approximated as an isothermal sphere
Finally we nd that the amount of total DM  stel-
lar mass mass bound to group members during encounters
tends to be rather small 281010M In a typical en-
counter a group member has a total bound mass that is
comparable to the mass bound to the stellar disc galaxy at
the most common time for an encounter We shall see that
this combined with the relatively large radial separation
between galaxies during encounters contributes to weaker

32 Orbital evolution of disc galaxies and
separation to group members
These general properties of encounters are similar to
those of the rest of our experiments and they also apply
when we restrict the analysis to close-encounters only
ie those taking place within a radial separation 100 kpc
though of course the number statistics is reduced in this
A parallel can be drawn with Knebe et al 2006 al-
though the scope and methodology of their study are dif-
ferent from ours They nd that penetrating encounters be-
tween DM satellites in clusters formed in cosmological sim-
ulations are also rare and have high relative velocities that
are comparable to the host one-dimensional velocity disper-
sion Additionally as we shall describe in Section 33 they
also nd that most of the mass loss experienced by satellites
is due to interactions with the host potential as opposed to
close-encounters
We characterise the orbital evolution of galaxies by the evo-
lution of the position of the centre of mass of the stellar
component of galaxies considering only stellar particles that
remain bound since the beginning of the simulations see
Section 33
Fig 2 top shows a comparison of the orbital evolution
of the disc galaxy for 12 dierent initial orbital distributions
of group members and 3 initial orbital eccentricities of the
disc As a reference the orbital evolution in the respective
experiments without group members is also shown The Fig-
ure shows that the inclusion of group members aects sig-
nicantly the infalling orbit of the disc galaxy In general
interactions with group members lead to an expansion of
the infalling orbit of the disc independently of its initial
eccentricity Interestingly the orbital expansion is found to
be the least signicant for the case of the most likely eccen-
tricity of infall We argue that the expansion of the infalling
orbits of disc galaxies does not come as a consequence of
direct interactions between the disc galaxy and the other

infalling eccentricities and the same initial orbital distribution for group members All orbits are followed until either the disc galaxy or
the respective group member is disrupted
galaxies in the systems Instead this is likely due to the fact
that by adding a galaxy population to the group halo-disc
galaxy conguration the total energyangular momentum
of the whole system is increased In some cases this causes
a signicant displacement of the densest region of the group
halo while the disc galaxy is infalling toward it Note that
the global DM density prole of group haloes only shows a
negligible evolution during our simulations
Fig 2 bottom shows the typical evolution of the radial
separation between the disc galaxy and the central galaxy
thickest and the group members thinner for dierent
initial infall eccentricities of the disc galaxy and for a xed
initial orbital distribution of group members We nd that
closer encounters between the disc and group members take
place when the orbit of the disc is more eccentric This is to
be expected since in such orbit the pericentres of a galaxy
will be smaller than in less eccentric orbits increasing the
probability that the galaxy will pass close to the centre of
the group where group members are also infalling
33 Stellar stripping of disc galaxies
We quantify the stellar stripping suered by galaxies by
computing the amount of bound stellar mass that galaxies
retain during their evolution within the group halo We ap-
ply the same algorithm as in Villalobos et al 2012 Briey
we i Consider all DM and stellar particles of the galaxy
that were bound at the previous snapshot as bound at the
current snapshot If the current snapshot is the initial one
then all galaxy particles are considered bound by construc-
tion ii Compute the total bound mass of the galaxy and
the velocity of its centre of mass iii Compute the binding
energy of the particles that are considered bound using the
updated velocity of the galaxys centre of mass iv Retain
only those particles that are still bound ie with negative
binding energy and recompute the total mass of the galaxy
v If the total bound mass from ii and iv has converged
then record it and go back to i for the next snapshot If
the total bound mass has not converged then go back to ii
using the bound particles found at step iv

extremes of the stellar stripping evolution suered by disc
galaxies when group members in dierent orbital distribu-

ing experiments when group members are not included Note
that the gure only shows experiments where the disc galaxy
is disrupted before 12 Gyr of evolution This typically ex-
cludes 1 or 2 cases in each experiment which does not aect
signicantly the estimation of the median behaviour
We nd that the inclusion of group members leads to
a broad range of possible stellar stripping evolution in disc
galaxies In particular the disruption time of identical stellar
discs can vary within a range of 1 to 6 Gyr with respect
to the case when no group members are included However
we nd that the median stellar stripping evolution over
dierent initial orbital distributions for group members can
be reasonably well described by the evolution of disc galaxies
in simulations where group members are not included Even
though the scatter in each experiment is relatively large
the lack of variation in the median evolution is encouraging
for theoretical studies attempting to obtain prescriptions for
stellar stripping evolution and merger timescales from con-
trolled simulations of isolated mergers that do not account
for the eect of other galaxies eg Boylan-Kolchin et al
2008 Villalobos et al 2013
Interestingly the median stellar stripping of stellar
discs when group members are included in the experiments
tends to be slower than when group members are not in-
cluded This is counter-intuitive as one would expect that
close encounters accelerate the disruption of the infalling
disc galaxy The slower stellar stripping can be understood
as a consequence of the expansion of the infalling orbit
of disc galaxies as explained in Section 32 This delays the
orbital passages of disc galaxies around the dense central re-
gion of the group where they are exposed to stronger tidal
forces This also highlights the fact that in our simulations
stellar stripping in disc galaxies is mostly driven by interac-
tions with the global environment which continuously grow
in mass by the disruption of group members rather than by
direct interactions between galaxies in the group these are
weak as discussed in Section 31
Note that these results are also valid for the disrup-
tion of the DM halo of disc galaxies and are similar between
experiments covering dierent orbital eccentricities of disc
galaxies number of group members within a factor of 2

of scatter in the mass stripping mostly depends on the
combined total mass of group members This is expected
since a more massive population of group members would
inject a larger amount of angular momentum to the sys-
tem2 Note that dierent morphologies of infalling satellites
could represent an additional source of scatter in their
mass stripping evolution see Chang et al 2013 Interest-
ingly the case when a disc galaxy infalls in a more radial
orbit is associated with an asymmetric scatter in its stellar
stripping
34 Structural evolution of stellar discs
As in Villalobos et al 2012 we study the structural
changes of disc galaxies as they orbit within a group envi-
ronment We start by rst centring the discs on their centre
of mass and aligning them in such a way that the Z-axis is
dened by their rotation axes Then structural properties
have been computed in concentric rings 1 kpc wide out
to 20 kpc from the disc centre considering only stars that
remain bound to the disc galaxy at a given time and that
are located within 3 kpc from the midplane We refer the
2 Assuming a xed group total mass this corresponds to cases
where the global DM content has a small contribution to the
group total mass see Aceves et al 2013 Note that in these cases
the variability in the properties of infalling disc galaxies is partic-
ularly high given the larger amount of angular momentum being
transferred by more massive group members
reader to Villalobos et al 2012 for a detailed description
of the procedure
Fig 4 illustrates the changes in the structural evolution
of a disc galaxy that are introduced only by dierent initial
orbits of group members while keeping the same number of
members their combined total mass and mass distribution
The disc galaxy infalls with the most likely orbital eccentric-
ity The structural evolution of the stellar disc is shown in
terms of its scale-length RD mean thickness hzi and am-
plitude of both central and global m  2 non-axisymmetries
Acentral bar Aglobal tidal arms For comparison the evo-
lution of the stellar disc in the corresponding experiment
without group members is included The Figure also shows
the evolution of the density contrast hGihDi to com-
pare the tidal forces acting on the disc galaxy due to the
central galaxy and each group member This quantity cor-
responds to the ratio between the mean mass density of the
central galaxy or a group member within the distance to
the disc galaxy and the mean mass density of the disc galaxy
within 10 initial scalelengths Both mean densities only in-
clude DM and stars that remain bound at a given time The
evolution of the density contrast due to the central galaxy
when no group members are present is also included
We nd that the inclusion of a population of group
members does not have necessarily a destructive eect on the
structure of the infalling disc galaxy on top of the evolution
induced by the global tidal eld In fact it is not uncommon
to nd that the inclusion of group members actually slows
down the structural evolution of discs induced by the global
tidal eld This can be seen not only in terms of the discs
scalelength and mean thickness but interestingly also in the
reduced formation of central bars3 The Figure also shows
3 In the context of our simulations the observed environmen-
A Villalobos G De Lucia and G Murante
that tidal forces on a disc galaxy by group members are in
most cases weaker than those induced by the central galaxy
This is consistent with the description of Fig 1 where en-
counters were found to be mostly distant in comparison to
the extension of discs and to take place mostly after group
members lose a signicant amount of their initial mass con-
tent This indicates that the global tidal eld of a group
plays a much more relevant role in the evolution of galaxies
in comparison to that of close-encounters
In Fig 4 the structural evolution of discs and the esti-
mation of tidal forces are followed only until either the stel-
lar component of the disc galaxy or that of a group member
has been disrupted We nd that identical disc galaxies in-
falling with the same orbit can survive longer when the
more massive group members also survive for a longer time
This points toward an important transfer of angular mo-
mentum from group members especially the most massive
ones to the whole system as they are aected by dynamical
friction within the group In fact our results suggest that
the overall inuence of group members on an infalling disc
galaxy comes mainly indirectly by modifying the global tidal
eld of the group as they are disrupted and by adding angu-
lar momentum to the whole system as they suer dynamical
friction
Figs A1 and A2 in the Appendix show the evolution
of the scalelength and mean thickness of disc galaxies in
all our experiments We nd that the median evolution can
be well described by simulations that do not include group
members while the inclusion of group members introduces
a signicant scatter
4 DISCUSSION
In the previous Section we have shown that within the pa-
rameter space explored with our simulations and the as-
sumptions we have adopted close-encounters between galax-
ies in groups are rare Additionally according to our simula-
tions close-encounters in groups have a limited direct eect
on the galaxies involved Instead most of the eect of group
members on an infalling disc galaxy comes indirectly via
modications to the global tidal eld of the group as group
members are tidally stripped andor merge Note that this
implies a potentially high variability in the way a galaxy
can be aected by other group members even when only
the orbital parameters of group members are dierent
41 On correlations between galaxy properties
and host halo mass
Previous studies have shown a correlation between sev-
eral observables of satellite galaxies age metallicity qui-
escent fraction and the mass of their host haloes eg
Pasquali et al 2010 De Lucia et al 2012 Wetzel et al
2012 These correlations are found to be relatively weak for
massive satellites while properties of less massive galaxies
show a clearer dependence on host halo mass As shown in
Section 3 even within host haloes of the same mass a partic-
ular galaxy can experience very dierent evolutionary paths
being strongly dependent on the evolution of other group
members and how they aect their common tidal eld The
high variability in the evolution of group galaxies found in
our simulations would likely weaken any underlying corre-
lation with halo properties Even though our measurements
cannot be easily translated into the observed correlations it
is striking to consider that the scatter found in our simula-
tions could be a conservative estimation Both rapid varia-
tions in the global potential through halo mass growth and
clustered accretion of group members could further increase
the scatter see Section 43
Alternatively Hou et al 2013 nd no signicant cor-
relation between the quiescent fraction of galaxies with the
dynamical mass of groups within the 101310145 M mass
in catalogues from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
SDSS the Group Environment and Evolution Collabora-
tion GEEC and the high redshift GEEC2 sample out to
z14 Interestingly they also nd that the quiescent fraction
is lower in groups with substructure for low mass galaxies
logMM  105
At face value both results are consistent with the out-
comes of our simulations if it is assumed that stronger grav-
itational interactions between a galaxy andor the global
eld are correlated to higher fraction of quiescent galaxies
The unclear correlation with halo mass found by Hou et al
is inline with the large scatter that group galaxies should
exhibit in their properties according to our simulations The
lower fraction of quiescent galaxies observed by Hou et al
in groups with substructure can be understood in terms
of the connection between the evolution of a given galaxy
and that of other group members as shown in Fig 4 The
Figure shows that the longer time the more massive group
memberssubstructures survive within the group ie are de-
tectable the less eective the global tidal eld acting on an
infalling galaxy is causing it to retain its stellar and even-
tually gaseous mass contentstructure for a longer time
However it is important to highlight that as opposed to
our group members in Hou et al substructure lies well be-
yond the viral radius of the halo which makes dicult a
direct comparison of their eects
42 Comparison to the eect of the global tidal
eld from previous simulations
421 Start of structural transformations in galaxies
within groups
In Villalobos et al 2012 we study the eect of only the
global tidal eld of the group environment on the evolution
of galaxies by means of controlled N -body simulations sim-
ilar to those presented in this work In our previous study
we found that accreted disc galaxies start suering a signif-
icant structural transformation due to the global tidal eld
only after the mean density of the group within the orbit of
the galaxy is 031 times the central mean density of the
galaxies After including the eect of other galaxies in the
tal dependence between barsbulges likelihood with environment
eg Skibba et al 2012 would appear to be linked to the presence
of gaseous components in group galaxies
4 As stated by Hou et al this apparent contradiction with pre-
vious studies is caused by dierent cuts in halo mass adopted to
explore underlying correlations
group environment we nd that this result remains a good
approximation as illustrated for a few cases in Fig 4 This
correspondence highlights the usefulness of relatively simple
and less costly simulations to characterise the mean evolu-
tion of disc galaxies being accreted onto a group Specically
these results can be used to assist the implementation of
particular physical processes in analytic and semi-analytic
models eg as done in recent studies on the formation of
the intra-cluster light in hierarchical galaxy formation mod-
els Contini et al 2014 and on environmental inuence on
quenching star formation Hirschmann et al 2014 submit-
422 On the formation of S0 galaxies in groups
In Villalobos et al 2012 we also nd that the global tidal
eld of a group alone is inecient at either inducing the
formation of central bulges in pre-existing stellar discs ie
in place before the accretion onto the group or enhanc-
ing pre-existing bulges These results can have important
implications for the formation of S0 galaxies in group en-
vironments S0 galaxies are characterised by having little
gas content practically no signs of spiral arms and often a
prominent central bulge Their formation processes is cur-
rently unknown although they are usually considered to
be the end product of spiral galaxies aected by environ-
mental processes Dressler 1980 Solanes  Salvador-Sole
1992 van Dokkum et al 1998 Increasing observational ev-
idence points toward the group environment as the char-
acteristic environment for the formation of these galaxies
Wilman et al 2009 Just et al 2010 In Villalobos et al
we concluded that if S0 galaxies are preferentially formed
in group environments then their prominent bulges could
not be produced by the eect of group tidal forces alone
This implies that bulges of S0 galaxies formed in groups
would be composed mostly by young stars In this study
we show that also the combined eect of global tidal eld
and close-encounters is not ecient at inducingenhancing
bulges of old stars in stellar discs This is illustrated for a
few cases in Fig 4 in terms of the amplitude of central in-
stabilities also conrmed by examining the evolution of the
surface density proles of each galaxy in our experiments
It is interesting to note that the eect of other group mem-
bers can actually inhibitdelay the formation of central in-
stabilities in comparison to the eect of the global tidal eld
Section 34 The implications of our simulations are consis-
tent with recent observational evidence based on absorption-
line index gradients Bedregal et al 2011 and spectroscopic
bulge-disc decomposition Johnston et al 2012 for a sam-
ple of S0 galaxies in the Fornax cluster indicating that in
those galaxies bulges are younger than the stellar discs5
5 However most of well spectro-photometrically studied S0
galaxies are high mass ones which might have a dierent for-
mation path with respect to low mass satellite S0 galaxies as
shown by Wilman  Erwin 2012 Wilman et al 2013
Close-encounters in a group environment
423 On prescriptions of merger timescales for galaxies
within groups
By means of
isolated controlled simulations of mergers
similar to those presented in this study Villalobos et al
2013 introduce a modication to the prescription of merger
timescales obtained by Boylan-Kolchin et al 2008 from
comparable simulations This modication consists in the
inclusion of an explicit dependence on the redshift at which
a galaxy is accreted onto a host halo and it is motivated by
the evolution of halo concentration with redshift The mod-
ied prescription oers an improvement up to 20 tdyn in
the prediction of merger timescales up to z  2 in absence
of interactions with other substructures
In Fig 3 we show that when the eect of close-
encounters with other group members are included in the
simulations the median stellar mass loss of a galaxy over
experiments with dierent initial orbital parameters for oth-
erwise the same set of group members can be reasonably
well approximated by the mass loss experienced by the same
galaxy only under the inuence of the global tidal eld of
the group This shows that when close-encounters are in-
cluded in the simulations the median merger time of a
galaxy can be well predicted by a relatively simple prescrip-
tion based only on the eect of the global tidal eld and
dynamical friction The inclusion of other group members
introduces a dispersion which appears to be mostly a func-
tion of the total mass of the galaxy population or the corre-
sponding global DM contribution to the group total mass
their mass distribution and number of members Such a dis-
persion could be introduced in galaxy formation models to
explore its eect Presumably this would increase the scat-
ter of predicted properties for group galaxies
43 Caveats
Regarding the initial conditions adopted for our simulations
disc galaxies resemble both in mass and radial extension a
slightly less massive Milky Way-like galaxy at z0 Instead
the radial extension and concentration of the DM halo of
the group environment for its quoted virial mass resembles
a halo at z1 This conguration is set by design as we have
attempted to maximise the eect of close-encounter between
galaxies by placing them in a relatively smaller volume Note
however that the structure of the simulated group is still
within ranges that are consistent with cosmological simula-
tions We have also carried out test simulations after scaling
the properties of both disc galaxies and the group DM halo
at several redshifts obtaining an even smaller eect on the
evolution of galaxies due to close-encounters
Our simulations do not account for the hierarchical
mass growth that the group DM halo might experience after
the disc galaxy under study has been accreted In this way
we do not consider possible rapid variations in the global
potential due to the accretion of massive substructure In
addition by assigning random positions and velocities to
group members within a halo our simulations could over-
smooth the distribution of galaxies thereby reducing the
eect of close encounters We estimate that the eect of hi-
erarchical mass growth of the group halo on the properties
of the disc galaxy would be similar to the eect introduced
by the inclusion of group members in the simulations That
A Villalobos G De Lucia and G Murante
is accreted substructure would modify the global tidal eld
of the group by either adding mass to its centre via mergers
andor by adding energyangular momentum to the system
Depending on the mass of the accreted substructure this
would translate into an additional scatter in the evolution
of the properties of galaxies around the median evolution
expected within a group halo that does not contain other
galaxies and does not experience mass growth
Finally our simulations do not consider cases where
galaxies are accreted as part of sub-groups onto a group
halo as it would be expected in the context of hierarchical
evolution of galaxy haloes In this way we neglect a possibly
signicant eect of close-encounters at low velocity disper-
sions of sub-group scales see Feldmann et al 2011
5 CONCLUSIONS
In this work we study the evolution of disc galaxies inhab-
iting a group environment using controlled collisionless N -
body simulations of isolated mergers Our goal is to estimate
the relative contributions of both the global tidal eld and
close-encounters between group members to the evolution
of disc galaxies We probe a parameter space that covers
a number of relevant aspects of the galaxy-group interac-
tion Regarding the disc galaxies we explore dierent ini-
tial inclinations with respect to the disc rotation dierent
orbital eccentricities consistent with cosmological simula-
tions and the presence of a central stellar bulge in the disc
Regarding the population of satellite galaxies in the group
we explore dierent number of members consistent with ob-
servations of groups variations in their stellar mass content
also consistent with observations and variations in the to-
tal mass of the satellite population Our ducial disc galaxy
resembles a bulge-less slightly less massive Milky Way
Our main results are the following
 Close-encounters in a group environment with the most
likely number of members are found to be rare and gravita-
tionally weak Most of the encounters between galaxies occur
at separations 50 kpc and relatively late in the simulations
when group members have already lost a sizeable fraction
of their initial mass reducing signicantly their capacity to
aect gravitationally the disc galaxy Thus in our simula-
tions the direct eect of close-encounters between galaxies
in groups is much less relevant than the inuence of the
global tidal eld of the group
 Within the group environment the inuence of other
members on a given galaxy is found to be mostly indirect
by altering the global tidal eld as group members trans-
fer to it mass via tidal stripping and energyangular mo-
mentum via dynamical friction The mass added to the
central region of the group shortens the merger timescale of
an infalling galaxy causing it to experience more structural
transformations and mass stripping On the other hand the
addition of energyangular momentum provokes a displace-
ment of the densest region of the group causing a delay
in the evolution of an infalling galaxy as the time between
pericentric passages about the group centre increases
 We nd that the evolution of general properties of disc
galaxies such as merger timescale stellar mass loss scale-
length mean thickness caused by other group members is
highly variable depending mostly on the initial orbital pa-
rameters positions and velocities of group members How-
ever the median evolution of disc galaxies is found to be
reasonably well approximated by the eect only due to the
global tidal eld ie in absence of close-encounters Inter-
actions with group members introduce a scatter around
the median evolution of disc galaxies whose amplitude
depends mostly on the combined total mass of the group
members their number and mass distribution
 Counter-intuitively disc galaxies can sometimes be less
aected by environmental eects after interacting with
group members ie galaxies can retain their initial structure
and mass content for a longer time The high variability of
the properties of disc galaxies due to the inuence of group
members could also wash out underlying correlations with
environmental properties such as the group mass
 The eect of the global tidal eld combined with close-
encounters between galaxies is inecient at inducing or
enhancing the formation of central bulges in stellar discs
present at accretion time This conrms our previous conclu-
sion that if S0 are formed from spiral galaxies preferentially
in group environments then their often large central bulges
should contain mostly relatively young stars in comparison
to their stellar discs This result is found to be consistent
with recent observations of S0 galaxies in the Fornax clus-
 Finally we nd that prescriptions based on simulations
that do not account for close encounters eg those done
to obtain merger timescales remain valid and can indeed
be used in the framework of galaxy formation models More
sophisticated implementations of those prescriptions could
include a scatter dependent eg on the total stellar mass
mass distribution and number of nearby galaxies
In the rst two papers of this series we have studied the
inuence of the global tidal eld and that of close-encounters
on the evolution of disc galaxies within group environments
estimating their relative contributions Thus far we have
focused on their eect on the stellar content of galaxies that
is already present when disc galaxies are accreted onto a
group In the third paper of this series we will examine the
contribution of the gaseous components of disc galaxies in
groups

APPENDIX A SCALELENGTH AND
THICKNESS EVOLUTION OF STELLAR DISCS
Figs A1 and A2 summarise the evolution of the scalelength
and mean thickness of disc galaxies in all our experiments
They show the median evolution over dierent initial or-
bital distributions of group members extreme cases and
the disc evolution in the corresponding control simula-
tions where group members are not included Even though
the inclusion of a population of group members introduces
a signicant scatter in the structural evolution of disc
galaxies in general the median evolution of both the scale-
length and mean thickness can be described remarkably well
by relatively simpler simulations that do not include group
members This is found to be independent of the initial or-
bital eccentricity of the disc galaxy its initial inclination
the presence of a central bulge the number of group mem-
bers the total mass of the population of group members and
their stellar mass distribution The scatter in the struc-
tural evolution of discs is driven mainly by the total mass
of the population of group members and to a lesser degree
by the eccentricity of the orbits
