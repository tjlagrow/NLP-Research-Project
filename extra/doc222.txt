Abstract
Galaxies in particular disc galaxies contain a number of struc-
tures and substructures with well dened morphological photometric and kine-
matic properties Considerable theoretical eort has been put into explaining
their formation and evolution both analytically and with numerical simulations
In some theories structures form during the natural evolution of the galaxy ie
they are a result of nature For others it is the interaction with other galaxies
or with the intergalactic medium  ie nurture  that accounts for a structure
Either way the existence and properties of these structures reveal important
information on the underlying potential of the galaxy ie on the amount and
distribution of matter  including the dark matter  in it and on the evolutionary
history of the galaxy Here I will briey review the various formation scenarios
and the respective role of nature and nurture in the formation evolution and
properties of the main structures and substructures
1 General introduction
What do we mean by nature versus nurture To some degree all galaxies have
one or more neighbours andor are inuenced by their surroundings So in the
absolute sense of the word there is no such thing as an isolated galaxy except
in computer simulations On the other hand even though a given structure
may be triggered by an interaction it will evolve within its galaxy potential
which together with the remaining characteristic properties of the galaxy will
inuence its evolution Thus no structure is 100 due to nature or 100 due to
nurture It is nevertheless useful to ask which of the two has mainly inuenced
the formation and evolution of a given structure and therefore in the following
I will assign the origin of a structure to one of these two alternatives
In fact as will be seen below more than one scenario is possible for each
structure and very often some mixture of nature and nurture can be involved
Hence one can only reason in terms of probabilities and propose this or that
agent as the most probable cause for a given feature Time comes into play as
if one goes suciently far back all galaxies have experienced important
interactions with their surroundings If however the time elapsed since the last
interaction is longer than the time necessary for a given structure to form one
can safely argue that this structure is due to nature rather than to nurture see
also a discussion in Hopkins 2009b
After these introductory remarks let me review what models and simula-
tions can tell us Since the subject is very broad I will discuss here only certain
aspects necessarily reecting my own preferences without me wanting to belit-
tle in any way work which I cannot mention for lack of time and space The list
E Athanassoula
of references given is likewise far from complete Finally I will only discuss the
formation of structures and not their destruction although the latter could also
be due either to nature or to nurture
2 Discs
Formation of galactic discs is one of the major still unsolved astronomical prob-
lems Very schematically one can distinguish two families of theories both with
important implications for the evolution and development of structures and stel-
lar populations in disc galaxies
The rst one explains disc formation as due to gas inow which can come ei-
ther in the form of a gradual accretion or of minor gas-rich mergers White  Rees
1978 Fall  Efstathiou 1980 Mo Mao  White 1998 Dekel  Birnboim 2006
Heller et al 2007 Genzel et al 2008 Agertz Teyssier  Moore 2009 Bournaud  Elmegreen
2009 Epinat et al 2009 Law et al 2009 etc
More recently however a second alternative has been proposed which if
conrmed would make discs the result of major mergers Since the pioneering
work of Toomre  Toomre 1972 and Toomre 1977 many arguments mainly
based on simulations have shown that a dry major merger will result in an
elliptical galaxy The outcome of wet major mergers has been relatively less
well studied and is more complex since it can result in a disc plus spheroid
The mass ratio of these two components depends not only on the gas fraction in
the progenitors and their mass ratio but also on the encounter orbit the relative
orientation of their discs and even on the properties of their gaseous component
particularly its feedback A merging of present day spirals even late types will
fall short of the necessary gaseous content Barnes 2002 At higher z however
progenitors are much more gas rich and the nal merger can be a disc galaxy
eg Springel  Hernquist 2005 Robertson et al 2006 Governato et al 2008
Hopkins 2009a Stewart et al 2009
More work is needed before the formation of discs by mergers can be con-
sidered as established Nevertheless
it is interesting to point out that this
second formation scenario which has considerable support from observations
Hammer et al 2005 2009 would result in younger discs Furthermore present
day discs and therefore their structures and substructures would then be of a
second generation following the ones formed initially in their progenitors
3 Bulges
Bulges are a very inhomogeneous class of objects Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004
Athanassoula 2005a reviews the various denitions of bulges and distinguishes
three types Classical bulges form mainly by mergings have a spheroidal shape
and a very centrally concentrated mass distribution BoxyPeanut bulges are
parts of bars that stick well out of the disc equatorial plane They form from
vertical instabilities of the bar material Finally discy bulges have the shape
of a disc but are not necessarily axisymmetric They are due to disc material
that has been pushed inwards either by interactionsmergers or by the torques
due to a bar Thus boxypeanut bulges can be primarily assigned to nature
classical bulges primarily to nurture and discy bulges to both
Structures in galaxies
4 Bars
N -body simulations have shown that stellar bars form naturally in galactic discs
for recent reviews see Athanassoula 2005b Binney  Tremaine 2008 and that
their growth rate depends on the halo-to-disc mass ratio  measured in the inner
parts of the galaxy  and the velocity dispersion in the disc Athanassoula  Sellwood
1986 Thus stellar bars grow faster in relatively more massive and colder discs
They then evolve by redistributing the angular momentum within the galaxy
This is emitted mainly from near-resonant material in the bar region and ab-
sorbed mainly by near-resonant material in the halo and the outer disc so that
the bar strength correlates well with the amount of angular momentum ex-
changed Athanassoula 2002 2003 The pattern speed of such bars decreases
with time and its evolution is followed by a number of morphological kine-
matic and photometric changes the most spectacular of which is the formation
of a boxypeanut bulge from the vertical instability of the bar Combes et al
1990 Raha et al 1991 Debattista  Sellwood 2000 Athanassoula  Misiriotis
2002 Valenzuela  Klypin 2003 ONeill  Dubinski 2003 Athanassoula 2003
2005a Debattista et al 2006 Martinez-Valpuesta et al 2006 For the forma-
tion and evolution of bars in gas rich systems see eg Bournaud et all 2005
Berentzen et al 2007 Romano et al 2008 and references therein
Thus bar formation and evolution can be explained as totally due to nature
Nevertheless interactions also can trigger bars or can strongly inuence bar
properties eg Gerin et al 1990 Miwa  Noguchi 1998 Berentzen et al 2003
2004 For example impacts by small companions can produce o-centred bars
which are generally shorter and less elongated than their centred precursors
Athanassoula Puerari  Bosma 1997
5 Spirals
In cases like M51 it is clear that the spiral has been triggered by an interaction
Toomre  Toomre 1972 Toomre 1981 This however is not true in all cases
and several mechanisms have been proposed to form spirals in isolation
The SWING mechanism Toomre 1981 relies on the amplication of a
spiral as it swings from leading to trailing in the corotation region of a shearing
galactic disc It involves an outwards travelling and swinging leading wave and
two trailing waves one travelling outwards from corotation to the outer Lindblad
resonance and the other inwards If the latter is reected at the centre of the
galaxy or at a sharp edge the cycle can close Thus this mechanism could
explain both grand design and occulent spirals
In the case of barred galaxies the spirals can also be due to material guided
by the manifolds emanating from the unstable Lagrangian points at the ends
of the bar Romero-Gomez et al 2007 Athanassoula et al 2009ab This the-
ory explains why grand design spirals in barred galaxies are trailing and have
preponderantly two arms It also reproduces well the shape of the arms
Thus although interactions can link spirals to nurture other mechanisms
explain them a result of nature

6 Rings
Like bulges rings are also an inhomogeneous class of objects Athanassoula  Bosma
1985 A small companion hitting a disc in a direction not too far from per-
pendicular to its equatorial plane and not too far from its centre will create
a density wave in the form of a ring propagating outwards Lynds  Toomre
1976 These rings are not common in agreement with the fact that they re-
quire particular impact parameters Often a second ring is visible The most
spectacular case is the Cartwheel galaxy which besides the rst and second
rings has also spokes between the two Such rings can be clearly attributed to
nurture
A dierent type of rings not due to a collisional encounter is often observed
in barred galaxies Depending on their location within the galaxy these can be
classied as nuclear when they are in the innermost parts of the disc inner rings
which have roughly the size of the bar and outer ones which have roughly twice
that size Buta 1995 The inner and outer rings can be due to material guided by
the manifolds emanating from the unstable Lagrangian points at the ends of the
bar Romero-Gomez et al 2006 2007 Athanassoula et al 2009ab ie they
can be explained by the same theory that explains spiral arms in such galaxies
This theory predicts the correct sizes and orientations for both inner and outer
rings In particular inner rings are elongated along the bar and outer ones either
along it or perpendicular to it as observed This theory also explains the rings
found in gas response simulations as those of Schwarz Salo Byrd Laurikainen
Rautiainen etc whose results agree very well with observations
Polar rings are yet a third type of rings They are external to the disc with
a size of the order of twice the disc radius and their plane makes usually an
angle of roughly 90 with that of the disc For this reason they are generally
believed to be due to the accretion of a companion galaxy or to mass transfer
during encounters ie due to nurture
7 Other features
71 Thick discs
Disc galaxies often have a second disc aligned with the standard well-known
thin disc with the same equatorial plane but much thicker Tsikoudi 1979
Burstein 1979 etc Its existence has been directly or indirectly attributed to
mergings with small companions or satellites captured by the disc The material
that constitutes it would then be either from the pre-existing thin disc which
has been pued up by the merging or directly from the companion which is
disrupted and adopts the orientation of the initial thin disc or from both eg
Walker 1996 Penarrubia 2006 Either way thick discs are attributed to nurture
72 Shells
Shells around an elliptical galaxy can be well explained as due to the disruption
of a small companion falling in the elliptical see Athanassoula  Bosma 1985
for a review Similarly small central discs in such galaxies can be due to gas-rich
infalling companions
Structures in galaxies
73 Warps
Although several attempts have been made to explain warps as due to nature I
will here focus on the nurture origin which is more generally followed Two such
possibilities have been mainly considered The rst possibility Ostriker  Binney
1989 Quinn  Binney 1992 Debattista  Sellwood 1999 Jiang  Binney 1999
Shen  Sellwood 2006 is that warps are due to cosmic infall If this reorientates
the outer parts of the halo by several degrees per Gyr the disc will develop a
warp with properties similar to those observed
The second and most straightforward way of producing warps is through the
tidal interaction with a close companion as has been witnessed in a large number
of simulations If this alternative is generally true ie if this is the way that all
warps are formed then we should be able to observe around all warped discs a
companion whose mass and orbit can account for the warp NGC 4013 was for a
long time believed to be a counterexample to this possibility Yet deep imaging
in Martinez-Delgado et al 2009 showed the debris of a past companion so
that even in this case the warp could be tidally generated
74 Bridges and tails
Spectacular examples of such structures can be seen in M51 or the antennae
After the pioneering work of Toomre  Toomre 1972 and the many other
studies that followed it it has become clear that these structures are due to
gravitational interactions ie are due to nurture
8 Summary
I discussed the possible formation mechanisms of structures and substructures in
galaxies focusing on whether their origin is due to nature or to nurture In most
cases there is more than one alternative A few structures can be explained only
by a mechanism relying on nurture but none uniquely only to nature
