It is by now well established that galaxy evolution is driven by intrinsic and environmental processes both contributing
to shape the observed properties of galaxies A number of early studies both observational and theoretical have shown
that the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their environmental local density and also on galaxy hierarchy
ie centrals vs satellites In fact contrary to their central most massive galaxy of a groupcluster satellite galaxies
are stripped of their gas and stars and have their star formation quenched by their environment Large galaxy surveys
like SDSS now permit us to investigate in detail environment-driven transformation processes by comparing centrals and
satellites In this paper I summarize what we have so far learnt about environmental effects by analysing the observed
properties of local central and satellite galaxies in SDSS as a function of their stellar mass and the dark matter mass of
their host groupcluster
1 Introduction
As shown by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS which
has extensively mapped the large-scale structure of the lo-
cal Universe in space and redshift most galaxies preferen-
tially live in aggregates whose size and mass range from
galaxy pairs to groups and clusters In the last three decades
it has become clear that galaxy mass and environment to-
gether concur to shape galaxy properties We well know for
example that the more massive galaxies residing in dense
regions tend to have an early-type morphology as well as
older and metal-richer stellar populations and to exhibit a
rather low star-formation activity aka the density - mor-
phology relation Dressler 1980 On the contrary galaxies
experiencing a signicant rate of star formation are typically
found in low-density environments Hashimoto et al 1998
At present we still need to understand in details the physics
of environmental effects and their interplay with the internal
secular evolution of galaxies
An obstacle to this kind of studies comes from the def-
inition of environment itself Environment has usually been
measured in terms of galaxy density ie the number den-
sity of galaxies out to the n-th neighbour although such a
measurement in a rich galaxy group or cluster is represen-
tative only of the local environment and not of the whole
groupcluster The advent of large surveys has made it pos-
sible to use groupcluster nding algorithms and thus quan-
tify environment on a physical basis in terms of its encom-
passing dark matter halo whose mass is estimated from the
stellar mass of the galaxies in each groupcluster cf Yang

et al 2005 2007 and links environment to the evolution
of structure in the Universe Within each environment it be-
comes also possible to distingusih galaxies between the cen-
tral the most massive galaxy and the satellites These two
classes of galaxies are in fact foreseen by simulations and
semi-analytic models SAMs of galaxy formation and evo-
lution to follow different assembly and star-formation his-
tories The distinction between centrals and satellites allows
us to directly compare their observed properties with those
predicted by simulations and SAMs in order to better con-
strain the mechanisms through which environment affects
galaxy evolution
Contrary to their central galaxy satellites orbit within
their environment and interact with the local Intra-Cluster
Medium ICM their peers and the potential well of their
groupcluster These interactions lead to erosion processes
which cause satellites to lose their reservoir of hot gas aka
strangulation cf Larson et al 1980 ionized and neutral
gas ram-pressure stripping Gunn  Gott 1972 as well as
their stars via tidal stripping eg Kang  van den Bosch
2008 Pasquali et al 2010 Harassment due to fast encoun-
ters Moore et al 1998 and tidal interactions with their
central galaxies can also remove gas and stars from satel-
lites Our goal is to use the observed properties of satellites
to quantify the amplitude and time scale of environmental
effects and how these parameters depend on galaxy stel-
lar mass and groupcluster halo mass on cluster-centric dis-
tance and redshift Therefore we will review what has been
learnt on galaxy environment at redshift z  0 in Sect 2
and 3 and we will describe the current knowledge of envi-
ronmental effects at higher redshifts in Sect 4 Conclusions
will follow in Sect 5

2 Quenching star formation
Since galaxy evolution is driven by galaxy stellar mass M
and environment at the same time we need to compare the
observed properties of satellites at xed M in order to char-
acterize environmental effects alone Moreover in the as-
sumption that satellites progenitors have similar properties
to present-day centrals of the same M the comparison be-
tween satellites and centrals in their properties at xed M
allows us to further constrain those galaxy transformations
that are induced solely by environment
In terms of their specic star formation rate SSFR
 SFRM most of the satellites residing in massive
haloes at z  0 are passive ie they are characterized by
logSSFRyr1  -11 In particular at xed M the frac-
tion of passive satellites increases with halo mass Mh and
is higher than the fraction of equally-massive passive cen-
trals at least for logMM  109 Wetzel et al 2012
also van den Bosch et al 2008 Moreover the fraction of
passive satellites is seen to steadily increase with M in any
environment of given halo mass This indicates that star for-
mation is most efciently suppressed in satellites by both
their intrinsic evolution ie secular evolution andor AGN
feedback especially at high M and environment an effect
that becomes more signicant at low M and high Mh This
trend does not imply though that all satellites in massive
haloes are quenched their distribution in SSFR is bimodal
irrespective of Mh only the amplitude of the peaks of the
star-forming and quenched satellites changes with M and
Mh At xed Mh the fraction of passive satellites increases
with M as more satellites quench their star formation ac-
tivity through their secular evolution or AGN feedback At
xed M the fraction of passive satellites increases as more
star-forming satellites are quenched by environment with
increasing Mh The transition region between the peaks of
the star-forming and passive satellites is though invariant
with respect to Mh being narrow in logSSFR and always
occurring at logSSFRyr1  -11 Wetzel et al 2012
Such a nding may imply that star formation in satellites
is quenched on a short time scale independent of Mh
A rapid quenching is also consistent with the fact that
low-mass satellites are older than equally-massive centrals
typically by just 15 Gyr at logMh2M  95 Fig-
ure 1 shows the average stellar age weighted by mass -
M relation solid lines for centrals in grey and satellites
in black It can be seen that satellites less massive than
logMh2M  105 are older than centrals of the
same stellar mass and this age difference becomes larger
with decreasing M At xed M the average stellar age
of satellites tends to increase with Mh and this trend is
more signicant for satellites with logMh2M  10
This can be explained if low-mass satellites in more massive
haloes had an earlier epoch of accretion with respect to low-
mass satellites in less massive environments Pasquali et al
2010 In this framework they ceased their star formation
activity early on and their stars evolved passively till now

black The dashed lines represent the 16th and 84th per-
centiles of the stellar age distribution within each bin of

The observed properties described above were used by
Wetzel et al 2013 see also Bahe et al 2015 to depict
the delayed-then-rapid quenching scenario for satellites
where low-mass galaxies are accreted onto a bigger halo at
an earlier redshift with respect to more massive galaxies
and keep forming stars and consuming their cold gas at the
same rate for 2 - 4 Gyr after infall Meanwhile tidal forces
induced by their groupcluster potential well deprive satel-
lites of their hot gas strangulation ie their gas reservoir
for future star formation After this period of time satellites
extinguish their star formation rapidly with an e-folding
time  08 Gyr
21 Ram-pressure stripping
A mechanism able to induce a rapid quenching of star for-
mation may be identied in ram pressure The interaction
between an orbiting satellite and the ICM of its host halo
triggers gas losses from the satellite and the fraction of
stripped gas is directly proportional to the satellite square
orbital velocity the ICM density and the groupcluster Mh
Bekki 2009 Kapferer et al 2009 Satellites subjected to
ram-pressure stripping are well known to exhibit a bent and
distorted spatial distribution of HI and H together with a
gaseous wake possibly undergoing star formation eg Ken-
ney et al 2004 2014 Vollmer et al 2004
There is more indirect evidence for the occurrence of
ram-pressure stripping encoded in the observed properties
of satellites This is the case when for example the fraction
of passive satellites is computed as a function of cluster-
centric distance The probability for a satellite of given M
to be quenched increases with decreasing distance from the
groupcluster centre and such a trend is more pronounced

A Pasquali Galaxy Environment
for low-mass satellites which were likely accreted at an ear-
lier time This observational result can be explained in terms
of the ICM density being larger in the central region of a
groupcluster than in its outskirts In addition the orbital ve-
locity of satellites at pericenter is signicantly higher than
at apocenter Ram-pressure stripping is thus expected to be
more efcient for satellites located in the inner parts of their
host halo
Furthermore radial proles of the fraction of passive satel-
lites show the existence of quenched satellites also at dis-
tances larger than the halo virial radius These satellites
may be backsplash galaxies moving on an eccentric orbit
which took them across the central region of their host halo
thus exposing them to ram-pressure and tidal stripping
and has now brought them outside the halo virial radius
Alternatively the accretion of a smaller galaxy group with
its own quenched satellites as well as the infalling of galax-
ies onto an extended ellipsoidal rather than spherical halo
can also increase the fraction of quenched satellites at R 
Rvir Wetzel et al 2012 Bahe et al 2013 Muriel  Coenda
Ram pressure is likely to be more efcient when act-
ing on gas more weakly bound to a satellite as in the case
of the HI gas generally distributed on a wider spatial scale
with respect for example to the ionized H gas used to esti-
mate star formation rates Indeed Fabello et al 2012 have
shown that the fraction of galaxies with a measured HI mass
from the ALFALFA survey Giovanelli et al 2005 declines
much more rapidly than the fraction of star-forming galax-
ies in haloes more massive than logMhM  13 More-
over Gavazzi et al 2013 have found that the HI content of
satellites in the Local Supercluster signicantly diminuishes
at small distances from M 87 where the ICM density is
likely the highest
The removal of cold and ionized gas clearly reduces
the galaxy star formation rate when compared at xed
M satellites tend to exhibit a lower global SSFR as
derived from their integrated colours Brinchmann et al
2004 than centrals Pasquali et al 2012 In addition the
stripping of metal-poor gas from the galaxy outskirts may
have an impact also on the galaxy gas-phase metallicity
In Figure 2 satellites in black are compared with equally
massive centrals in grey on the basis of their gas-phase
metallicity measured in the SDSS bre by Tremonti et al
2004 Therefore the gas-phase metallicity shown in Fig
2 is the oxygen metallicity of the Interstellar Medium in
the central region of galaxies It can be seen that satel-
lites tend to be metal-richer than centrals of the same
M and the difference in 12  logOH increases with
decreasing M so to reach a maximum value of 006
dex at logMh2M  82 Pasquali et al 2012
The gas-phase metallicity of satellites less massive than
logMh2M  95 becomes higher with increasing
Mh in particular at logMh2M  9 it increases by
015 dex in the range 11  logMhh1M  14 These
ndings are consistent with ram pressure which by strip-

ping the outermost gas is able to inhibit radial inows of
metal-poor gas that would otherwise diluite the gas-phase
metallicity in the inner region of satellites Since low-mass
satellites in present-day more masive haloes were accreted
earlier they have been exposed to ram-pressure stripping
for longer and have been able to preserve their gas-phase
metallicity at the time of infall better than their peers in
present-day less massive haloes Pasquali et al 2012
22 Comparison with SAMs predictions and
simulations
In their original version semi-analytic models of galaxy for-
mation and evolution assumed that upon accretion satel-
lites would instantaneously lose their reservoir of hot gas
thus experiencing an early and rapid quenching of their star
formation activity Consequently SAMs predicted fractions
of passive satellites much higher than observed especially
at low stellar masses logMM  10 cf for example
Weinmann et al 2006 An additional effect of a too early
and rapid quenching is that SAMs overestimate the stellar
age of low-mass satellites whose observed stellar ages are
instead younger Pasquali et al 2010
Recently Guo et al 2011 modied their SAMs by
introducing a dependence of strangulation on Mh also in
this case the predicted fraction of quenched satellites turns
out to be larger than observed particularly at low stellar
masses The comparison between observed and predicted
fractions of quenched galaxies implies once again that
low-mass satellites residing in haloes more massive than
logMhM  13 cease their star formation activity over
a long time scale of the order of 5 Gyr Quenching should

become shorter with increasing M De Lucia et al 2012
Hirschmann et al 2014
An alternative way to reconcile predicted and observed
fractions of passive satellites was proposed by Kang  van
den Bosch 2008 who adopted a strangulation time scale
of 3 Gyr in their SAMs and assumed that 50 of low-mass
satellites logMM  10 are tidally disrupted before be-
ing accreted onto their central galaxy As discussed below
there exists a growing observational evidence for satellite
galaxies being tidally stripped of their stars which may be
a prelude to tidal disruption at least for some of them The
fractions of quenched satellites computed by Kang  van
den Bosch 2008 follow the observed ones quite closely
The hydrodynamical simulations based on GADGET-2
and performed by Dave et al 2011 2013 automatically in-
clude ram-pressure stripping and predict a gas-phase metal-
licity difference between satellites and centrals as well as a
fraction of HI-poor satellites in good agreement with obser-
vations
3 Tidal stripping and stellar mass loss
Recent deep-imaging observations at optical wavelengths
with a limiting surface brightness g  28 - 30 mag
arcsec2 have revealed the presence of tidal tails streams
and shells around galaxies of both early and late type in
low-to-intermediate density environments as well as in clus-
ters These ne structures are commonly interpreted as the
result of recent close interactions or mergers during which
one or more companions were rstly tidally stripped of
their stars and later accreted Martnez-Delgado et al 2010
Sheen et al 2012 Duc et al 2015
N -body numerical simulations have indeed shown the
emergence of these tidal features during the assembly his-
tory of galaxies and how the morphology of such substruc-
tures depends on the orbit type of the accreted compan-
ions cf for example Johnston et al 2008 In particular
Chang et al 2013 simulated the gravitational interactions
between a central galaxy and its orbiting satellite in order
to study the morphological transformation of the satellite
galaxy as induced by tidal stripping These simulations in-
dicate that tidal stripping hence stellar mass loss from the
satellite begins when 90 of the satellite dark matter halo
has been removed At this point the efciency of tidal strip-
ping and the amplitude of the stellar mass loss critically de-
pend on the satellite morphology In the case of a pure disc
or a discbulge satellite with a tidal radius of the order of
the disc scale-length stellar mass loss is exponential and
the removal of most of the disc component occurs on a time
scale of few Gyrs The orientation of the satellite orbit and
the morphology of the central galaxy are found to have only
a second-order effect on tidal stripping
Tidal stripping and morphological transformations of
satellites are also driven by the global tidal eld of their
host halo The numerical simulations by Villalobos et al
2012 have shown that satellites can develop tidal features
The average stellar metallicity of centrals grey
solid line and satellites black solid line as a function of
their stellar mass The dashed lines represent the 16th and

each bin of stellar mass Pasquali et al 2010
and undergo relevant changes in their original morphology
once they cross a region of their host group where the mean
group density is comparable to their internal central den-
sity The efciency of tidal stripping and the time scale over
which most of the satellite stars are removed are found to
depend on the satellite stellar mass orbit type and the satel-
lite inclination with respect to the orbit
Another effect of tidal stripping in addition to tidal fea-
tures and morphological transformations may be identied
in the observed offset in stellar metallicity between central
and satellite galaxies at xed stellar mass Figure 3 shows
the dependence of stellar metallicity on M for centrals
solid grey line and satellites solid black line While at
the high-mass end central and satellite galaxies are equally
metal-rich satellites less massive than logMh2M 
103 exhibit a higher stellar metallicity than centrals of
the same M This difference becomes larger for decreas-
ing stellar mass and reaches a values of 02 dex at
logMh2M  93 Pasquali et al 2010 Obser-
vations also indicate the existence of a stellar metallicity
- Mh relation for satellites whereby the stellar metallic-
ity of low-mass satellites logMh2M  103 is
seen increasing in more massive galaxy groups A qual-
itative explanation of these trends rests on the fact that
upon accretion satellites lose stellar mass via tidal stripping
which leaves though stellar metallicity unaltered Thus
present-day satellites are most likely less massive than but
equally metal-rich as their progenitors Comparing present-
day satellites with centrals of the same M equals com-
paring present-day centrals with past more massive cen-
trals which are also metal-richer by virtue of the galaxy
stellar metallicity - M relation This ultimately produces
an offset in stellar metallicity when present-day satellites
and centrals are contrasted at xed present-day M In

A Pasquali Galaxy Environment
this framework a difference of 02 dex in logZZ at
logMh2M  93 would indicate that a satellite of
this present-day M has experienced a fractional mass loss
of about 50 Since satellite galaxies in present-day more
massive environments were accreted at an earlier time they
have undergone the effects of tidal stripping for a longer
period and consequently they are expected to be metal-
richer than satellites of the same M in less massive haloes
Pasquali et al 2010
4 Beyond z  0
We observe environmental effects also at higher redshifts
at least up to z  2 although larger distances progressively
hamper our capability of measuring detailed stellar param-
eters and limit our measurements to more massive galaxies
and environments Most measurements are restricted to star
formation rates from emission lines and photometry and to
stellar ages from the D4000 break
A number of studies have shown that at intermediate
redshift 02  z  08 star-forming galaxies in groups
and clusters exhibit star formation rates that are at xed
M a factor of two lower than those measured in the eld
population cf for example Poggianti et al 2006 Vulcani
et al 2010 Consequently the fraction of passive galax-
ies is observed to rise at xed M with halo mass from
the eld population to galaxy groups and clusters Follow-
ing the time evolution of the cosmic star formation rate
the fraction of passive satellites in groups and clusters tend
to become lower with increasing redshift and closer to the
value measured in the eld At xed Mh the number of pas-
sive galaxies steadily rises with increasing stellar mass in
analogy to what is observed at z  0 cf for example Lin et
al 2014 McGee et al 2011
Similar trends are observed at z  1 the fraction of star-
forming galaxies is a factor of 2 higher in the eld than in
groups at any galaxy stellar mass Moreover the fractional
number of star-forming galaxies within groups is seen to
increase with distance from the group centre most likely
a result of ram-pressure stripping being more efcient in
the central region of groupsclusters where the ICM is dens-
est Muzzin et al 2012 In particular Muzzin et al 2014
analysed the velocity-position distribution of post-starburst
satellites in several z  1 clusters and found that simula-
tions can reproduce it when satellites upon accretion are let
to form stars for about 1 Gyr the time needed to make their
rst passage at R  05 Rvir where environmental effects
become more efcient and then quench their star forma-
tion activity rapidly over a time scale between 01 and 05
Gyr cf also Balogh et al 2011 Mok et al 2014
Our knowledge of galaxy environment at z  15 - 2 is
clearly much sparser than at z  1 since the detection of
galaxy clusters at infrared wavelengths is challenging from
the ground and no extensive imaging and spectroscopic sur-
vey has been performed yet at these redshifts that can give
a statistically-robust against cosmic variance overview of
galaxy properties as a function of their haloes A number
of galaxy clusters have been discovered and studied beyond
z  15 which exhibit nearly the same fraction of passive
and star-forming satellites at odds with their z  1 counter-
parts mostly dominated by quenched galaxies The cluster
star-forming satellites experience star formation rates that
are comparable to those measured in the eld Hayashi et al
2010 They are seen to populate the cluster core and out-
skirts either in equal percentage cf Hayashi et al 2010 or
to become more numerous in the higher density regions of
these clusters Tran et al 2010 Santos et al 2015 Never-
theless some clusters at z  15 already exhibit a fraction of
passive satellites higher than in the eld and increasing with
decreasing cluster-centric distance possibly due to a more
efcient ram-pressure stripping in the cluster core see for
example Strazzullo et al 2013 The picture thus emerging
from these results is one where galaxy clusters at z  15 are
building up their core with the progenitors of the quenched
massive galaxies observed at z  1
5 Conclusions
The observed properties of satellite galaxies at z  0 can
be ascribed to a star formation activity that proceeds for 2 -
4 Gyr since accretion onto a bigger halo and subsequently
declines with an e-folding time  1 Gyr These time scales
do not signicantly depend on halo mass and are estimated
to be shorter at z  1 1 Gyr and 03 Gyr respectively
How can we reconcile these two snapshots in the time evo-
lution of cosmic structures
Tinker  Wetzel 2010 performed clustering measure-
ments for star-forming and passive galaxies so distin-
guished on the basis of their colours in three publicly
available surveys UKIDSS-UDS DEEP2 and COMBO-
17 and used the fraction of passive satellites to estimate by
comparison with simulations the satellites quenching time
and its dependence on redshift In this case the quench-
ing time is comparable with the above mentioned duration
of the satellite star formation activity after infall plus the
time scale of its subsequent rapid quenching The authors
found that the satellite quenching time scale increases with
decreasing redshift as 1 z15 in a similar way as the
dynamical time scale of dark matter haloes This likeness
would then suggest that satellites lose their hot gas aka
strangulation mainly because of tidal forces induced by
their host halo when they cross it This in concurrence with
the ram pressure stripping of coldionized gas would cause
the suppression of star formation in satellites
An alternative explanation of the redshift dependence
of the satellites quenching time comes from McGee et al
2014 who analysed the quenching times measured in the
literature for satellites at different redshifts with a model
for the baryon cycle in galaxies ie outows driven by star
formation The authors suggested that recurring outows
may be able to suppress the star formation activity of satel-
lites more rapidly than orbit-based gas stripping especially

for the more massive galaxies and at high redshifts Dedi-
cated measurements of outows their velocities and mass-
loading factors in central and satellite galaxies at high red-
shifts will provide an observational assessment of their con-
tribution to satellites quenching
While satellite galaxies fade and get disrupted centrals
follow a different evolution As shown by Pasquali et al
2009 central galaxies are the place most friendly to star
formation where star formation can continue over long time
scales This is because i their environment does not de-
prive them of their gas since they do not orbit in their host
halo ii they can accrete gas from their environment via for
example mergers or close encounters with gas-rich satel-
lites events that become progressively less likely in more
massive haloes given their higher velocity dispersion iii
They might accrete gas from their hot ICM and cool it so to
trigger a new episode of star formation Recently La Bar-
bera et al 2014 showed that central early-type galaxies
in groups logMhh1M  125 are characterised by
younger ages lower Fe ratioes and higher intrinsic red-
dening than central early-types of the same velocity disper-
sion  but in isolation Such ndings imply that central
early-types in groups assembled their stellar mass via gas
accretion over longer time scales from 04 Gyr at high 
to few Gyrs at low  than isolated early-type galaxies
