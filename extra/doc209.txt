ABSTRACT
The determination of stellar populations of galaxies are important for studying the
formation and evolution of galaxies because all galaxies contain many stars and they
evolve with galaxies Spectra data are usually used to determine the stellar populations
of nearby galaxies as they have the ability to disentangle the degeneracy between stel-
lar age and metallicity However it is dicult to give similar studies to distant eg
z  03 galaxies because of the lack of reliable spectra data This is actually limited by
current observational equipments and methods In fact the information of the stellar
ages and metallicities of distant galaxies are crucial for solving the problem of galaxy
formation and evolution Colours can give us some information of the stellar popula-
tions of distant galaxies In the paper I introduce our works about using colours to
estimate the ages and metallicities of the stellar populations of galaxies Some poten-
tial colours for studying stellar-population parameters age and metallicity and their
sensitivities to stellar-population parameters are reviewed A new composite stellar
population model that includes both single stars and binary stars is also introduced
Key words galaxies stellar content galaxies evolution galaxies formation
INTRODUCTION
The formation of galaxies is one of the biggest challenges
in astronomy and astrophysics It is the golden era to solve
this problem because we have had good background of the
formation and evolution of stars and the universe In fact
many works have been done and some progress has been
presented However it is far from well understanding galax-
ies and further researches are needed Evolutionary stellar
population synthesis is a widely used technique for study-
ing galaxies It can give reliable studies to galaxies via their
stellar contents because all galaxies contain a great deal
of stars and stars contribute mainly to the light of galax-
ies A lot of works studied galaxies using their stellar pop-
ulations see eg Li et al 2006 However most previous
works studied the stellar populations of nearby galaxies via
spectra-like methods while optical colours are thought to
be unusable for determining two stellar-population parame-
ters age and metallicity This is very the well-known stel-
lar agemetallicity degeneracy However some studies also
showed that colours in dierent bands are sensitive to dier-
ent stellar-population parameters and can possibly be used
to give estimates to stellar populations of distant galaxies
and then investigations to galaxy formation and evolution
I will review our works on trying to use colours to study the
stellar-population parameters of galaxies This will be use-
ful for future studies because colours can be obtained much
more easily than the spectra of galaxies
The structure of the paper is as follows In section 2
I introduce the sensitivities of colours to stellar-population
parameters and some potential colours for stellar population
studies In section 3 I summary a few points that should be
considered when using colours to study stellar populations
In section 4 I introduce a new stellar population model for
using colours to study stellar populations of galaxies Fi-
nally in section 5 I give a short conclusion
2 SENSITIVITIES OF COLOURS
Spectra line strength indices can be used to disentangle the
stellar agemetallicity degeneracy because they have dier-
ent sensitivities to the age and metallicity of stellar popu-
lations However optical colours are thought to be useless
for disentangling stellar agedegeneracy because they have
similar sensitivities to stellar-population parameters In or-
der to investigate the possibility of using colours in dierent
bands to study the ages and metallicities of stellar popula-
tions we investigated the sensitivities of colours to stellar-
population parameters Li et al 2007 In that work a sim-
ple stellar population model Bruzual  Charlot 2003 and
a relative sensitivity method were used The results showed
that colours in dierent bands have various sensitivities to
the inputs of stellar populations In detail some colours re-
lated to optical bands eg B  V  U  R R  I and
V  I are more sensitive to stellar age while some other

ones related to near-infrared bands eg B  K R  K
V  K and I  K to stellar metallicity However it
showed that every colour is aected by both stellar age and
metallicity This suggests that it is impossible to determine
stellar age or metallicity using one colour index However
using a pair of colours that consist of an age-sensitive colour
and a metallicity-sensitive colour the stellar ages and metal-
licities of galaxies can be determined One can refer to our
paper Li et al 2007 for more details When we tried to
study the sensitivities of some colours hereafter composite
colours including magnitudes on dierent photometry sys-
tems we found that some composite colours eg r  K
uK uR and iI have good sensitivities to stellar-
population parameters Thus they can be used for stellar
population studies If taken the usual observational errors
for magnitudes the abilities of dierent pairs of colours for
disentangling the well-known stellar agemetallicity degen-
eracy can be valued Li  Han 2008a It is shown that pairs
such as r  K u  R and r  K u  r are bet-
ter for usual stellar population studies However the uncer-
tainties in nal stellar ages and metallicities are somewhat
large near 100 This results from the large observational
uncertainties in colours Because dierent surveys have dif-
ferent observational uncertainties the errors in the results
of various surveys can be dierent a lot In future surveys
because colour uncertainties will be possibly reduced it will
be possible to give more accurate constraints on stellar ages
and metallicities of galaxies via colours
3 POINTS SHOULD BE NOTED
Colours related to dierent bands have various sensitivities
to stellar-population parameters and can help us to deter-
mine the stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies However
some points should be noted because simple stellar popu-
lation models are usually used but colours can be aected
by eg dust young stars and binary stars in galaxies and
observed colours are related to the distances of galaxies In
the following part I will mention a few points
31 Eects of young stars
Because early-type galaxies were thought to have some ho-
mogeneous and old stellar populations some simple stellar
population models were widely used in the studies of the
stellar populations of early-type galaxies However more
and more observations showed that there are recent star for-
mations in those galaxies It suggests that young stars are
common in all type of galaxies and there should be more
than one stellar populations in a galaxy In this case it is
necessary to consider the eects of young stars on the de-
termination of stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies as
young stars are usually bright and can contribute much to
the light One Li  Han 2007 of our works studied how
young stars can aect the stellar-population parameters de-
termined by colours That work shows that if there were two
stellar populations an old and a young one with the same
metallicity in a galaxy the younger the age or the larger the
mass fraction of the young component the bluer the colours
of the galaxy When one gives estimates to stellar ages and
metallicities via comparing a pair of colours of galaxies to
those of theoretical simple stellar populations younger ages
and richer metallicities are usually obtained Therefore one
should take the eects of young stars into account when
studying stellar-population parameters using colours
32 Eects of binary interactions
Because it is easier to model stellar populations via single
stars most widely used stellar population models are single-
star stellar population models ssSSPs which do not take
the eects of binary interactions into account However bi-
nary stars are common and they evolve dierently from sin-
gle stars Two of our works Li  Han 2008b Li  Han
2008c show that binary interactions make stellar popula-
tions less luminous while making colours bluer age-sensitive
line strength indices larger and metallicity-sensitive indices
less compared to ssSSPs When using colours to determine
the stellar-population parameters of galaxies dierent stel-
lar ages and metallicities will be obtained via ssSSPs and
bsSSPs Usually poorer metallicities and similar ages will
be given by ssSSP models compared to the results obtained
via bsSSP models Therefore when investigating the stel-
lar metallicities of galaxies the eects of binary interactions
should be taken into account In addition although ssSSP
and bsSSP models can give similar ages for galaxies it is
actually much more complicated in practical works because
the eects of binary interactions are degenerate with stellar-
population mixing This needs further investigations
33 Eects of dust and corrections
Most stellar population models do not take the eects of
dust into account but dust exists in galaxies and can change
the colours of galaxies Therefore the eects of dust should
be considered Many works about the dust of galaxies have
been done but there is a long way to go Although it is dif-
cult to give accurate corrections for the dust in galaxies
we can reduce the eects of dust in nal results via dening
our galaxy samples carefully If we study luminous and rel-
atively blue early-type galaxies dust will aect our results
much more slightly because there is less dust in such galax-
ies Moreover there are larger uncertainties in the results
of of galaxies with large eg  1 red shifts because the
corrections of the colours of such galaxies have much un-
certainties and they can lead to large uncertainties in nal
results However this will possibly be improved in the fu-
ture following the development of telescopes and the process
of observational data
4 A NEW MODEL FOR STELLAR
POPULATION STUDIES
Although there are many available stellar population models
and some of them are widely used there are some limitations
in those models It is necessary to build some new and more
advanced models for stellar population studies and galaxy
studies I introduce a new model for studying stellar popula-
tions of galaxies via colours or low resolution spectral energy
distributions SEDs This is a model that takes both the
eects of binary interactions and population mixing into ac-
count Because binary insteraction and population mixing
Application of colours in stellar population studies
Figure 1 The spectral energy distributions of three composite stellar populations with dierent metallicities A fraction of 50 is taken
for binaries
are common in galaxies the theoretical populations of the
new model are closer to those of galaxies
The model is built using an isochrone database Li 
Han 2008d of both single-star and binary-star stellar popu-
lations in which the evolution of stars was calculated via the
rapid stellar evolution code of Hurley et al 2002 When
building the new model we used BaSeL 31 spectra library
Westera et al 2002 to transform the results of stellar evolu-
tion into the SEDs of stellar populations Although a galaxy
may contains many populations we build our population via
two stellar populations an old and a young one This makes
it easier to calculate the model and possible to estimate the
characteristics of the main components of galaxies Follow-
ing the results of Thomas et al 2005 a exponentially de-
clining law with age is taken for the mass fractions of young
components in our work In such a case when the model is
used for studies some mass-weighted stellar ages and metal-
licities will be obtained for the components of galaxies As
the main results the SEDs and colours of composite stel-
lar populations are calculated In Fig 1 the SEDs of a few
populations are shown as an example We see that the UV-
upturns observed in elliptical galaxies are reproduced by our
new model In fact UV SEDs are sensitive to the recent star
formations of galaxies When we try to study the sensitivi-
ties of colours to the inputs of stellar populations photome-
tries in dierent bands are found to be sensitive to dierent
model inputs This will be useful for studying the metallici-
ties and the ages of the components of the stellar populations
of galaxies and then the star formation histories of galaxies
5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
Colours can help us to explore the stellar populations of
galaxies because dierent colours have various sensitivities
to the inputs of stellar populations If the galaxy sample is
well selected and suitable stellar population model is used
some credible results can be obtained via colours of galaxies
It is will be useful for studying the formation and evolution
of galaxies However some points should be noted in studies
