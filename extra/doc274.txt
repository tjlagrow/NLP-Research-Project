ABSTRACT
We present GMRT 1280 MHz radio continuum observations and follow-up optical studies
of the disk and nuclear star formation in a sample of low luminosity bulgeless galaxies The
main aim is to understand bulge formation and overall disk evolution in these late type galax-
ies We detected radio continuum from ve of the twelve galaxies in our sample the emission
is mainly associated with disk star formation Only two of the detected galaxies had extended
radio emission the others had patchy disk emission In the former two galaxies NGC 3445
and NGC 4027 the radio continuum is associated with star formation triggered by tidal in-
teractions with nearby companion galaxies We did followup H imaging and nuclear spec-
troscopy of both galaxies using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope HCT The H emission
is mainly associated with the strong spiral arms The nuclear spectra indicate ongoing nu-
clear star formation in NGC 3445 and NGC 4027 which maybe associated with nuclear star
clusters No obvious signs of AGN activity were detected Although nearly bulgeless both
galaxies appear to have central oval distortions in the R band images these could represent
pseudobulges that may later evolve into large bulges We thus conclude that tidal interactions
are an important means of bulge formation and disk evolution in bulgeless galaxies without
such triggers these galaxies appear to be low in star formation and overall disk evolution

1 INTRODUCTION
Bulgeless galaxies are an extreme class of late type spiral galaxiess
Scd to Sm that have practically no bulge and are nearly pure disk
in morphology Boker et al 2002 Although these galaxies are not
rare their formation and lack of evolution remains a puzzle both
for Cold Dark Matter CDM theories of hierarchical galaxy for-
mation White  Rees 1978 and the secular evolution theories of
galaxy disks Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 The former process
leaves clear signatures of merger history in the disks and the lat-
ter leads to the presence of oval distortions or disky bulges in the
galaxy centers neither of these features are seen in most bulgeless
galaxies One of the processes by which these disks could evolve
is through interactions with nearby companion galaxies The main
aim of this work is to search for signs of such evolution by map-
ping the star formation and nuclear activity in a sample of nearby
bulgeless galaxies This can help us better understand the transfor-
mation of these predominantly disk dominated galaxies into bulge
dominated systems
Bulgeless galaxies show a wide variation in disk morpholo-
gies ranging from the irregular dwarf galaxies to the nearly pure
disk galaxies such as NGC 6503 Kormendy et al 2010 They are
late type spirals and have large gas rich disks with low to mod-
erate star formation rates In some cases their galaxy disks may
be optically bright as in NGC 5457 M 101 which has a rel-
atively high star formation rate Boissier et al 2007 But most
bulgeless galaxies have moderate to low surface brightness LSB
disks a good example being NGC 2552 which has a low luminos-
ity disk de Blok 2005 Being late type galaxies their dust content
is often high Popescu et al 2002Ganda et al 2009Boselli et al
2012 and this can lead to signicant optical extinction Although
bulgeless small bars and oval distortions may be present as well
as occulent spiral arms that result in localized disk star forma-
tion Such features are much lower in the more isolated bulgeless
galaxies Kautsch 2009 eg The large scale spiral arms and bars
that signify strong disk instabilities are not seen in most of bulge-
less galaxies especially the low luminosity LL ones This sug-
gests that they may have dominant dark matter halos that stabilise
their disks against the formation of bars spiral arms or oval per-
turbations Indeed for the LSB bulgeless galaxies this is the case
Zackrisson et al 2006 Banerjee et al 2010 but this may also be
true for the brighter bulgeless galaxies as well Salucci  Persic
1997 Kormendy  Freeman 2004 Hence only nearby interac-
tions may be able to trigger disk instabilities that will lead to star
formation nuclear gas inow and central mass buildup in these
Das et al
galaxies It is these processes that could result in bulge formation
in such systems
The formation and evolution of bulgeless galaxies in a
CDM universe is not well understood Their angular momen-
tum and rotation velocities are not unusual for late type systems
Matthews  Gallagher 2002 but are too high to be compati-
ble with CDM models of galaxy formation DOnghia  Burkert
2004 Some models suggest that galactic outows due to super-
novae and stellar winds can remove low angular momentum ma-
terial from these disks leaving behind higher angular momentum
material in the disks Brook et al 2011 Governato et al 2010 Or
hot gas during the merging epoch is redistributed back to the disk
via a galactic fountain Brook et al 2012 However this process
may not explain the nearly pure disk morphology for the larger
bulgeless galaxies especially those that are relatively low in star
formation actvity Thus although dynamically these galaxies rep-
resent the simplest form of disk galaxies the physics behind their
simple form is far more challenging to understand
Apart from the challenge of forming such pure disk galax-
ies there is also the question of how they develop nuclear black
holes and active galactic nuclei AGN Galaxy bulges and AGN are
thought to grow together in the nuclei of galaxies eg Silk  Rees
1998 Daddi et al 2007 and most AGN in our nearby Universe
are associated with bulges eg Heckman et al 2004 But supris-
ingly AGN have been detected in the nuclei of bulgeless galaxies
Filippenko  Ho 2003 Satyapal et al 2007 Gliozzi et al 2009
Satyapal et al 2009 Perhaps the most well studied example is
NGC 4395 Filippenko et al 1993 The galaxy has a Seyfert 1
nucleus that has a black hole of mass  105 M
Peterson et al
2005 Peterson et al 2005 which puts it in the intermediate mass
black holes IMBH domain In fact most of the AGN detected in
bulgeless galaxies have been found to be associated with IMBHs
McAlpine et al 2011 Shields et al 2008 It is not clear where
these galaxies lie on the M   correlation as they barely have
a bulge or how to explain their AGN activity which should be
correlated with the formation of a bulge Recent studies indicate
that the SMBHs do not correlate with the disks or pseudobulges
in galaxies Kormendy et al 2011 hence the disk may not be di-
rectly correlated with the growth of nuclear black holes in bulge-
less galaxies The AGN found in these galaxies are often buried
inside nuclear star clusters which appear as bright cores in place of
bulges Boker et al 2002 Boker et al 2004 Walcher et al 2005
Seth et al 2008 Neumayer et al 2011
In this paper we investigate how star formation and nuclear ac-
tivity in bulgeless galaxies can result in bulge formation disk evo-
lution such galaxies We focus only on LL bulgeless galaxies that
may or may not have a bar but do not have a prominent bulge
We use radio observations to map the star formation and search for
compact nuclear emission in our sample of twelve galaxies Radio
emission has the advantage that it is not aected by dust obscura-
tion and hence in this case may be a better tracer of the star forma-
tion For a deeper understanding we have followed up two interest-
ing cases with optical spectroscopy and H imaging observations
In the following sections we discuss our sample the observations
and our results We then summarise our ndings and discuss their
implications
2 GALAXY SAMPLE
Our sample consists of twelve late type LL spiral galaxies Table 1
that appear to be bulgeless or have a minimal bulge in their Hub-
ble Space Telescope HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2
WFPC2 images Boker et al 2003 The galaxies have a range of
disk morphologies some have nearly pure disks and some have
progressively more distinct centers that may represent bulges in
early stages of evolution They all have compact stellar cores as in-
dicated by their HST I band light proles and are detected at some
level in their NRAO VLA Sky Survey NVSS radio maps How-
ever the resolution of NVSS is poor 45  and hence does not
show the detailed radio morphology Only six galaxies have Very
Large Array VLA Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Cen-
timeters FIRST radio maps UGC 4499 NGC 3445 NGC 3782
NGC 3906 NGC 4701 and NGC 5584 FIRST has a smaller beam
size 5  and so the higher resolution is able to pick up the more in-
tense emission that maybe associated with star formation Of these
six FIRST galaxies only NGC 4701 shows radio emission and it
is associated with the inner disk In the following paragraph we
briey describe our sample galaxies
ESO 418-8 NGC 4299 NGC 4540 and UGC 4499  All four
galaxies have fairly featureless disks that do not support recent
large scale star formation or spiral structure Only knotty or very
localised star forming regions are seen in the optical and UV maps
Gil de Paz et al 2007 The NVSS maps reveal extended but rela-
tively weak radio emission from the disks and is probably associ-
ated with the localized star forming regions
NGC 3346 and NGC 5668  Both galaxies are relatively nearby
and nearly face-on in orientation NGC 3346 has a small bar in
the center that is associated with a fairly strong spiral structure
NGC 5668 has less prominent spiral structure The NVSS maps
shows diuse and extended radio emission distributed over the in-
ner disks of both galaxies
NGC3445  Optical images suggest that this is a one armed spiral
galaxy The prominence of the southern spiral arm gives the galaxy
a lopsided appearance only a closer inspection of the 2MASS K
band image reveals the smaller northern arm NGC 3445 forms
part of a triplet of galaxies with two other galaxies NGC 3440
and NGC 3458 Close to the southern arm and lying east of the nu-
cleus of NGC 3445 there is a prominent star forming region that
may have formed from a retrograde encounter with a neighbour-
ing galaxy Cao  Wu 2007 GALEX observations of the galaxy
show that the star formation is extended over the disk Smith et al
2010 though much of it is associated with the spiral arms and the
nucleus The galaxy has a bright nucleus that hosts a nuclear star
cluster Seth et al 2008 but no AGN The radio ux in the NVSS
maps is large compared to other galaxies in our sample but due to
the poor resolution of NVSS not much can be said about the radio
morphology This is one of the few galaxies in our sample that has
been detected in CO emission Boker et al 2003 the molecular
gas mass is relatively low and centrally concentrated The galaxy
has a small oval bar in the center but bulge-disk separation was
not possible in this galaxy perhaps because the bulge is too small
Baggett et al 1998
NGC 3782 and NGC 3906  Both galaxies have small bars in their
centers but no strong spiral structure Knots of star formation are
distributed over their disks The radio emission is diuse and ex-
tended over the galaxy disks NGC 3782 is fairly inclined i  60
but NGC 3906 is close to face-on in morphology
NGC 4027  This galaxy like NGC 3445 appears to be a one armed
spiral galaxy in the optical images this is mainly due to the promi-
nent northern spiral arm that gives it a lopsided appearance The
smaller southern spiral arm appears much more prominent in the
HI images of the galaxy Phookun et al 1992 and extends down
towards the smaller companion galaxy NGC 4027A The net ef-

fect of the tidal interaction between NGC 4027 and NGC 4027A
has resulted in an extended HI ring around NGC 4027 The star
formation is distributed over the disk and and especially along the
spiral arms of NGC 4027 The 14 GHz radio continuum ux for
this galaxy is the highest in the sample Table 2 and the emission
is distributed over the disk and nuclear regions The molecular gas
mass of this galaxy is suprisingly low Young et al 1995 and less
than 6  106 M
Das et al 2005 it is close to the detection limits
in the FCRAO survey This is also the only galaxy in our sample
that has a very small bar that appears as an oval distortion in the
center of the galaxy Phookun et al 1992 Its bulge to disk size is
very low  125 Baggett et al 1998 which suggests that it may be
a pseudobulge or a bulge in early stages of formation
NGC 4701 and NGC 5584  Both galaxies have a small bright
nucleus and a occulent spiral structure Star formation is asso-
ciated with the spiral pattern The NVSS images show extended
but diuse radio emission from the disks and is probably associ-
ated with star forming regions over the spiral arms NGC 4701 also
shows some emission in the higher resolution FIRST radio map
The emission is concentrated about the nucleus and the inner disk
3 RADIO OBSERVATIONS
We observed the galaxies in radio continuum at 1280 MHz using
the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope GMRT located near Pune
India Ananthakrishnan  Rao 2002 Observations were done dur-
ing May 2008 Nearby radio source were used for phase calibra-
tion Each galaxy had a two hour scan excluding time spent on
nearby calibrators the average on source time was about 15 The
data was obtained in the native lta format converted to FITS for-
mat and then analysed using AIPS 1 Bad data was iteratively edited
and calibrated on a single channel until satifactory gain solutions
were obtained using standard tasks in AIPS This was used to gen-
erate bandpass solutions The central 110 channels were bandpass
calibrated and averaged to obtain the continuum database This was
then imaged using IMAGR Both natural and uniform weighted
maps of the galaxies were made to obtain the extended structures
and see if there is any compact emission associated with the nuclei
Figures 1-5 We also experimented with dierent UV tapers to
bring out the extended fainter radio emission
4 H IMAGING AND OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY OF
NGC 3445 AND NGC 4027
We did H imaging and optical spectroscopy of the two galaxies
NGC 3445 and NGC 4027 that showed extended emission in the
GMRT radio continuum maps The observations were done with
the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope HCT which is located at
the Indian Astronomical Observatory IAO at Hanle The tele-
scope is remotely controlled from the Center for Research and Edu-
cation in Science and Technology CREST which is part of the In-
dian Institute of Astrophyiscs IIA in Bangalore The spectrum of
NGC 3445 was obtained on a cloudless night on 17 March 2010 and
NGC 4027 was observed on a clear night on 19 January 2010 The
spectra were obtained using a 11192 slit 167l in combination
with a grism 7 blue region and grism 8 red region which cov-
ers the wavelength ranges 37007600  and 55009000  with
dispersions of 146  pixel1 and 126  pixel1 respectively
The spectral resolution is around  87  398 km s1 FWHM or
  169 km s1 at H for grism 7 and  7    136 and 103
km s1 at H and Ca ii Triplet respectively for grism 8 The spec-
tra were obtained after exposing both the galaxies for about 2400 s
in grism 7 The spectrum of NGC 4027 in grism 8 was obtained
with an exposure of 1800 s Due to the low signal to noise SN
ratio of the grism 8 spectrum of NGC 3445 we did not use it for
further analysis The slit was placed at the centre of the galaxy cov-
ering a central region of  2  5 1 corresponds to 135 pc at a
redshift of  00055
Data reduction was carried out using the standard tasks avail-
able within IRAF 2 which includes bias subtraction extraction of
one dimensional spectra wavelength calibration using the ferrous
argon lamp for grism 7 and ferrous neon lamp for grism 8 The
wavelength calibrated spectra were ux calibrated using one of the
spectroscopic standards of Oke 1990 observed on the same night
and then corrected for the redshifts of the galaxies The blue and the
red ux calibrated spectra of NGC 4027 were combined together

and NGC 4027 are shown in Figures 10 and 12
The H images of NGC 3445 and NGC 4027 were obtained
on 17 March 2010 from HCT The H lter installed inside the
Himalaya Faint Object Spectrograph system HFOSC is centered
around 6550  and has a bandwidth of 100  Bessells R l-
ter centered around 6400 with a BW of  1600  is used for
continuum subtraction similar to the procedure described in Waller
1990 As discussed by James et al 2004 for dark nights the
scaled R band exposure gives an excellent continuum subtraction
Each of the H frames was observed for 10 minutes Sky subtracted
unit exposure time R frame was scaled and subtracted out from the
H that was also sky subracted and normalized with respect to ex-
posure time The nal continuum subtracted H frames for two
galaxies NGC 3445 and NGC 4027 are shown in the Figures 6 and
7 respectively
5 RESULTS
51 Radio Observations
We have detected radio emission from ve of the twelve galax-
ies in our sample Table 2 Although all twelve galaxies have ra-
dio emission in the NVSS images only ve were detected in our
study There are several reasons for this  1 Some of the sources
have NVSS ux which is extended and diuse disk emission These
sources had low level ux 2 to 3 mJy  in NVSS which is close
to NVSS noise value With GMRT we conrmed that they are
non-detections eg ESO 418 NGC4499 NGC3906 NGC4540
2 Our GMRT observations were only two hours scans of each
source Hence the UV coverage is not very high Deeper obser-
vations are required to detect the more diuse emission Hence
only emission with high ux density is detected A good exam-
ple is NGC 4027 where the GMRT and NVSS uxes are close in
value 3 In some cases such as NGC 3782 the GMRT ux is much
less than the NVSS ux because of confusion with a much brighter
source nearby Since the NVSS beam is large this emission from a
nearby source is picked up 4 In one galaxy NGC 4701 the data
quality is not good enough too noisy to detect the source even
though the FIRST map shows some emission close to the nucleus
In some cases heavy agging was needed for the central baselines
this along with incomplete UV coverage led to non detections or
ux loss
In the following paragraphs we discuss our results in more de-
tail The GMRT ux is quite high for the galaxies NGC 3445 and
NGC 4027 and the NVSS and GMRT uxes are comparable In
these galaxies the radio emission is extended and associated with
massive star formation along the spiral arms Interestingly both
these galaxies are also tidally interacting with nearby companion
galaxies
i NGC 3782 NGC 4299 NGC 5668  All three galaxies show
only patchy radio emission associated with the disk eg Figure 1
NGC 4299 and is due to localized star formation Thus although
the galaxies show extended radio emission at 14 GHz in the NVSS
maps our higher resolution GMRT observations could only de-
tect small pockets of localized emission This suggests that unlike
NGC 3445 and NGC 4027 there is not much ongoing high mass
star formation in these galaxies
ii NGC 3445  The radio emission mainly follows the prominent
southern spiral arm Figure 2 and to some extent the less promi-
nent northern arm It is due to thermal emission associated with star
formation triggered by tidal interactions with the companion galax-
ies NGC 3440 and NGC 3458 Smith et al 2007 The peak ux
detected in our observations is 2 mJybeam where the beam is 8
and map noise is 015 mJybeam and is coincident with the large
star forming region south of the galactic nucleus The total radio
emission that we detect at 1280 MHz with the 8 beam is 113 mJy
which is about half of the the ux detected at 1420 MHz by NVSS
which has a much larger beam Table 2 In the high resolution
or uniformly weighted map Figure 3 the emission breaks up into
two peaks The brighter peak is associated with the southern spiral
arm and the other lies along the northern spiral arm Suprisingly
there is no emission associated with the nucleus even though this
galaxy does have a prominent nuclear star cluster Seth et al 2008
We calculated the star formation rate from the total infra-red lumi-
yr1 Bell 2003 Although this
nosity TIR its value is  1 M
is not high it is signicant for a relatively low luminosity galaxy
NGC 3445 is also one of the few galaxies in our sample that has
molecular hydrogen gas Boker et al 2003 it is mainly conned
to the inner parts of the galaxy disk and is probably associated with
the disk star formation
iii NGC 4027  This galaxy shows the maximum radio emission
in our sample Figure 4 The net ux is  88 mJy and is mainly

distributed around the southern spiral arm The emission north of
the galaxy center is patchy and does not follow the spiral pattern as
closely as the southern arm The emission along the southern spiral
arm is concentrated at two locations There is also some emission
associated with the galaxy nucleus it could be due to nuclear star
formation or weak AGN activity In the high resolution map Fig-
ure 5 most of the emission is associated with the southern arm
which indicates that the more intense star formation is located in
this part of the galaxy There is also emission associated with the
galaxy nucleus it may be due to the nuclear star cluster Seth et al
2008 or a weak AGN We determined the star formation rate from
yr1 Bell
the total infra-red luminosity and its value is  4 M
2003 The radio morphology clearly indicates that star formation
activity has been triggereed by the tidal interaction with the smaller
galaxy NGC 4027A that lies south of the galaxy and closely fol-
lows the large HI ring that envelopes both galaxies Suprisingly the
northern spiral arm is more prominent in the optical images than the
southern arm This could be due to the orientation of the galaxies
during the interaction Hence the northern spiral arm is comprised
of older stars due to previous star formation activity whereas the
southern arm represents ongoing star formation in NGC 4027
52 H imaging of NGC 3445 NGC 4027 and the Residual R
The H emission maps of NGC 3445 and NGC 4027 are shown in
Figures 6 and 7 The main emission regions are circled in red We
have determined the H ux for these knots and estimated the star
formation rate for these regions using the empirical relation of Ken-
nicutt 1983 the values are listed in Table 3 We have also obtained
the H subtracted R band images of the galaxies and examined the
core structure in both galaxies
NGC 3445  The distribution of H emission in NGC 3445 fol-
lows the UV emission quite closely as seen in the GALEX images
Gil de Paz et al 2005Smith et al 2010 There are two knots of
star formation concentrated along the spiral arms one lies north
of the galactic nucleus and the second which is much larger lies
southwest of the nucleus Figure 6 The radio emission also closely
follows the H emission as seen in the overlay Figure 8 We did
not detect any H emission from the nucleus only emission from
yr1
star forming regions in the tidally interacting arms is observed The
radio continuum peak at 1280 MHz coincides with the strong HII
regions located at the western and northern regions Table 3 shows
the H luminosities for the more prominent star forming knots as
well as their respective star formation rates SFR The SFR is less
yr1 for most regions except the large star formation knot
than 1 M
located in the southern arm which has a SFR of 15 M
NGC 4027  The H emission observed in NGC 4027 Fig-
ure 7 is much higher than that observed in NGC 3445 and the
FIR luminosity Table 2 is also higher This is probably because
the rate of newly forming stars is closely related to the tidal in-
teraction with the companion galaxy and the tidal interaction in
NGC 4027 Phookun et al 1992 appears to be stronger than that
in NGC 3445 The H emission in NGC 4027 closely follows the
spiral arms but is more concentrated along the southern arm where
there are two large knots of star formation these are clearly seen
in the radio map overlay Figure 9 As in NGC 3445 the peak of
the 1280 MHz radio emission coincides with the strong HII region
complexes in the spiral arms Using luminosity of each of the knots
we have derived the star formation rates Table 3 the number of
O stars present in each of the knots is also given in the Table 3 and
lies in the range 102 to 104 There is also H emission associated
with the nucleus which could be due to nuclear star formation and
possibly an AGN see next subsection
Residual R band Image  The H subtracted residual R band im-
ages are not very deep but give an idea of the disk structure in
both galaxies eg Figure 10 NGC 4027 We used the iraf task
ellipse to t ellipses and examine whether there are oval distortions
in the galaxy centers NGC 4027 has an oval distortion of ellip-
ticity approximately 06 and position angle 83 The size of the
oval distortion is  15 or 065 kpc The structure is disky rather
than spherical and suggests that it may be a pseudobulge that has
formed from the buckling of a much smaller bar and is in the pro-
cess of growing into a bulge Sellwood  Wilkinson 1993 The
bulge-disk decomposition of NGC 4027 yields a bulge scale length
of re  1 and disk e  162
Baggett et al 1998 The bulge
size is much smaller than our estimate using ellipse tting perhaps
because their decomposition measures the central core and not the
whole oval structure The R image of NGC 3445 also has a small
bulge in its center but it is not as elliptical as the incipient bulge
Das et al
in NGC 4027 The oval distortion in NGC 3445 appears to have an
ellipticity less than 05 and a position angle 45 the total size is
less than 05 kpc The bulge is too small for bulge disk decompo-
sition Baggett et al 1998 The images also show that both galax-
ies have spiral arms that are associated with the tidal interactions
with nearby galaxies The spiral structure is sharper in NGC 4027
than NGC 3445 possibly because the tidal interaction is stronger
in NGC 4027 Phookun et al 1992
53 Optical spectroscopy of NGC 3445 and NGC 4027
i NGC 3445  The optical spectrum of NGC 3445 is displayed in
Figure 11 The uxes of emission lines are tabulated in the Table 4
A strong underlying stellar population in absorption is detected at
H  H and H wavelengths The composite light from NGC 3445
is decomposed using an underlying stellar spectrum an Fe ii tem-
plate and a power-law continuum using a the Levenberg-Marquardt
2 minimization technique The procedure followed is discussed in
detail in Ramya et al 2011 The spectrum of NGC 3445 the de-
composed components and the model subtracted nal spectrum are
all plotted in Figure 12 The age of the underlying stellar popula-
tion is estimated to be in the range 500 Myr to 1 Gyr indicating
that a recent episode of star formation has occurred in the galaxy
The galaxy is also experiencing current episodes of star formation
as seen from the H images We searched for signatures of hid-
den AGN activity but no broad H emission line was detected even
after subtracting the underlying stellar continuum NGC 3445 is
classied as a galaxy with nuclear star clusters Seth et al 2008
rather than hosting an AGN or a composite kind of nucleus We
investigated where NGC 3445 lies on the Baldwin Phillips  Ter-
levich BPT diagram the values of log3  5007H  018
and logN ii  6584H 062 lie in the region occupied by
star forming galaxies The uxes of emission lines see Table 4
were used to calculate ionic abundances of each of the species
of O N S using the task ionic from the stsdas package of iraf
The electron temperature and density are  11107 K and  26
cm3 respectively The elemental abundances are estimated fol-
lowing the prescription of Pilyugin et al 2010 The oxygen abun-
dance 12  log O
H   84 and nitrogen abundance is estimated to be
12  log N
H   756 The metallicity is only slightly less than solar
12  log O
H   867 metallicity in value
ii NGC 4027  The spectrum of NGC 4027 is displayed in Figure
13 It is interesting to note that the spectrum does not show any for-
bidden lines of Oxygen like O ii  3727 3  49595007 or even
O i  6300 The non-detection of oxygen lines but presence of
N ii  65486584 and S ii  67176731 is surprising It could be
due to dust Roussel et al 2001 which may have used up most of
the oxygen during the formation of dense clouds Also the Balmer
decrement HH is approximately 6 which is much greater than
the theoretically expected value of 3 Table 5 displays the emission
line uxes equivalent widths and ionic abundances In compar-
ison with NGC 3445 the nitrogen and sulphur ionic abundances
of NGC 4027 are higher by about 06 dex and 01 dex respec-
tively which hints towards higher oxygen abundance and metallic-
ity than NGC 3445 The stellar decomposition was carried out and
the residual spectrum Figure 14 neither shows any oxygen line
nor show any broad H emission conrming that this galaxy hosts
a nuclear star cluster and not an AGN Seth et al 2008 The age
of the underlying stellar population as estimated from the best t
starburst99 template is  1 Gyr Using the emission line ratio of S
ii  67176731 the electron density is estimated to be 273 cm3
6 DISCUSSION
i Star Formation in Bulgeless Galaxies  Our radio observations
as well as general observations in the literature suggest that bulge-
less galaxies are generally poorly evolved systems that have low
star formation rates SFR unless interacting with nearby galax-
ies Kautsch 2009 In our study all the galaxies are rich in HI
Watson et al 2011 and hence have the capacity to support star
formation but most are fairly quiescent We compared our galax-
ies with other pure disk galaxies that have been studied in the
literature such as the relatively low luminosity galay NGC 6503
and the brighter galaxy M101 We estimated their SFRs using the
total infrared TIR luminosities Bell 2003 as we did for our
sample galaxies in Table 2 NGC 6503 which has a low SFR of
yr1 is close to the local void Karachentsev et al 2003
and is hence fairly isolated Its SFR is similar to NGC 3782 which
shows only patchy star formation M101 NGC 5457 however is
yr1 it is
a fairly bright star forming spiral and has a SFR 41 M
part of a group of mainly dwarf galaxies Kinney et al 1993 Its
SFR is similar to NGC 4027 but larger than NGC 3445 the star
formation is probably triggered by interactions with nearby galax-
ies in the group These two examples also suggest that bulgeless
galaxies are generally low in star formation unless interacting with
nearby galaxies This raises the possibilty that their disks are more
dark matter dominated than regular spirals and hence need a strong
trigger such as an interaction with a close companion galaxy to
start forming stars
ii Bulge growth in disk dominated galaxies  The main result of
this work is that we have found two cases of ongoing bulge for-
mation in two low luminosity bulgeless galaxies NGC 3445 and
NGC 4027 in which bulge formation has been triggered by close
tidal encounters with nearby galaxies Both galaxies are dark mat-
ter dominated systems since they are late type spirals with low
luminosity disks Salucci  Persic 1997 Such systems are not
easily perturbed to form bars and spiral arms However interac-
tion induced disk activity can result in enhanced star formation
that can eventually lead to the build-up of bulges in the galaxy
disks Kormendy  Fisher 2008 This process may be ongoing
in NGC 3445 where a small bright core or bulge maybe develop-
ing Alternatively tidal interaction can trigger bar formation and
this can lead to bulge growth through the formation of a pseudob-
ulge This may have happened in the case of NGC 4027 where
the small oval distortion that we see in the R band image may
have started out as a small bar instabilty this then buckled to form
an oval distortion or pseudobulge Combes et al 1990Raha et al
1991Martinez-Valpuesta  Shlosman 2004 Another example of
interaction induced activity in a LL galaxy is NGC 4625 This
galaxy is interacting with NGC 4618 and perhaps merging with
NGC 4625A Gil de Paz et al 2005 the close interaction has trig-
gered star formation in the extended low surface brightness LSB
disk of NGC 4625 Thus close tidal encounters are an important
mechanism for the evolution of halo dominated systems such as
LSB galaxies or low luminosity bulgeless galaxies such as those in
our study
iii AGN-bulge evolution  The well known black hole mass and
bulge velocity relation Ferrarese  Merritt 2000 Gebhardt et al
2000 Gultekin et al 2009 is dicult to understand in the context
of bulgeless galaxies since it implies that black hole growth is very
dicult without a bulge However there is a signicant number of
bulgeless galaxies that show AGN activity and have intermediate
mass black holes IMBH for example NGC 3367 and NGC 4536
McAlpine et al 2011 Kormendy et al 2011 have suggested that

a Fluxes of all species are normalised with respect to H ux and errors on the uxes are in the range 5  10 because of

b Since oxygen lines are undetected in the spectrum of NGC 4027 it was not possible to estimate the oxygen and nitrogen
abundances
there are two ways of forming nuclear black holes one driven by
mergers and gas infall it leads to the formation of classical bulges
and is often associated with SMBHs in massive galaxies The sec-
ond is through secular evolution processes the galaxy disks this
includes the formation of bars and pseudobulges This latter pro-
cess leads to the formation of smaller black holes or IMBHs in the
centers of galaxies In our study NGC 3445 may be in the pro-
cess of forming a bulge through the rst process ie gas infall and
central star formation whereas NGC 4027 may be an example of
the second mode of bulge growth In NGC 4027 the formation of
spiral arms and the growth of a central bar has been triggered by
close tidal interactions with the nearby galaxy NGC 4027 A lead-
ing to the formation of a pseudobulge Figure 10 and weak AGN
activity Although neither NGC 3445 or NGC 4027 show optical
emission lines characteristic of AGN the AGN activity may star
later Studies indicate that the nuclear black holes begin to accrete
and show AGN activity only after the initial starbursting phase is
over Cen 2011 The black holes formed in this manner however
through pseudobulge evolution may not lie along the M  relation

7 CONCLUSION
i We have detected radio emission at 1280 MHz from ve of
the twelve bulgeless galaxies in our sample Of these ve galax-
ies two galaxies NGC 3445 and NGC 4027 show strong radio
emission associated with their disks Both galaxies are closely in-
teracting with nearby companion galaxies and the radio emission is
mainly due to the tidally triggered disk star formation NGC 4027
also shows some nuclear radio emission In the remaining three
galaxies the emission was patchy and due to localized star forming
regions in their disks
ii Both NGC 3445 and NGC 4027 have H disk emission asso-
ciated with star formation along their spiral arms The radio emis-
sion closely follows the H emission The nuclear optical spec-
troscopy suggests that there is ongoing nuclear star formation in
both NGC 3445 and NGC 4027 it is possibly associated with the
formation of nuclear star clusters No AGN emission lines were
detected in the optical spectra of either galaxy
iii The optical R band images of both NGC 3445 and NGC 4027
show concentrations of mass in their nuclear regions This may rep-
resent small bulges in early stages of formation The close tidal in-
teractions has led to the formation of extended spiral structure and
star formation which contribute to the build-up of nuclear mass In
NGC 4027 there is an oval distortion that may represent a pseudob-
ulge Thus close tidal interactions rather than internal processes
may be important for bulge formation and disk evolution in low
luminosity bulgeless galaxies
