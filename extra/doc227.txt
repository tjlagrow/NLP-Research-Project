ABSTRACT
The growth of the supermassive black holes BHs that reside at the centres of most
galaxies is intertwined with the physical processes that drive the formation of the
galaxies themselves The evolution of the relations between the mass of the BH mBH
and the properties of its host therefore represent crucial aspects of the galaxy formation
process We use a cosmological simulation as well as an analytical model to investigate
how and why the scaling relations for BHs evolve with cosmic time We nd that a
simulation that reproduces the observed redshift zero relations between mBH and the
properties of its host galaxy as well as the thermodynamic proles of the intragroup
medium also reproduces the observed evolution in the ratio mBHm for massive
galaxies although the evolution of the mBH relation is in apparent conict with
observations The simulation predicts that the relations between mBH and the binding
energies of both the galaxy and its dark matter halo do not evolve while the ratio
mBHmhalo increases with redshift The simple analytic model of Booth  Schaye
2010 in which the mass of the BH is controlled by the gravitational binding energy
of its host halo quantitatively reproduces the latter two results Finally we can explain
the evolution in the relations between mBH and the mass and binding energy of the
stellar component of its host galaxy for massive galaxies m  1011 M at low
redshift z  1 if these galaxies grow primarily through dry mergers

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade it has become clear that the su-
permassive black holes BHs found at the centres of
virtually all galaxies with spheroidal components have
masses that are coupled to the properties of their host
galaxies Magorrian et al 1998 Ferrarese  Merritt 2000
Tremaine et al 2002 Haring  Rix 2004 Hopkins et al
2007 Additionally there exists evidence that BH masses
are coupled to the properties of the dark matter haloes
in which they reside Ferrarese 2002 Booth  Schaye
2010 Further correlations between quasar activity eg
Boyle  Terlevich 1998 and the evolution of the cosmic
star formation rate eg Madau et al 1996 provide evi-
dence that there exists a link between galactic star formation
and accretion onto a central AGN
It has long been recognised that the growth of BHs is
likely self-regulated Silk  Rees 1998 and that these tight
correlations indicate that the growth of BHs is tightly in-
tertwined with the physical processes that drive galaxy for-

mation However despite a wide variety of theoretical and
observational studies the origin of these relations is still de-
bated The study of the evolution of the BH scaling relations
therefore represents a crucial aspect of the galaxy formation
process that may provide us with additional clues regard-
ing the physical processes that give rise to the BH scaling
relations
Addressing these questions observationally is challeng-
ing Due to their extremely high luminosities bright quasars
provide a promising route to measuring BH masses at high
redshift through the widths of low-ionization lines that are
associated with the broad-line region close to the BH and
using the assumption of virial equilibrium eg Vestergaard
2002 It has however been claimed that this procedure
systematically underestimates BH masses Jarvis  McLure
2002 Measuring galaxy masses for these objects is very dif-
cult as the BH outshines the galaxy by a large factor see
eg the discussion in Merloni et al 2010 Since AGN sur-
veys are biased towards more massive black holes selection
eects also need to be taken into account eg Shen  Kelly
2009 Bennert et al 2010 which can make it dicult to dis-
tinguish between evolution in the normalization and in the
C M Booth  J Schaye
scatter in the scaling relations Lauer et al 2007 In spite of
these diculties measurements of the BH scaling relations
have been made as far out as redshift three
McLure et al 2006 found that the BHs associated
with radio loud AGN residing in galaxies of a given stellar
mass are a factor of four more massive at redshift two than
in the local Universe Decarli et al 2010 studied the C IV
line associated with the quasar broad line region in R-band
selected hosts at both redshifts zero and three and found
that BHs are typically a factor of seven more massive at
high redshift for a given galaxy mass These results are con-
sistent with other observational studies Walter et al 2004
Peng et al 2006ab Merloni et al 2010 Greene et al 2010
Bennert et al 2010 Taken together these papers suggest
an emerging consensus that at higher redshift BHs in hosts
of a given mass are systematically more massive than in
the local Universe although see Jahnke et al 2009 for one
study that nds no signicant evolution
The evolution of the relation between BH mass mBH
and stellar velocity dispersion  has been studied util-
ising the width of the O III line as a proxy for stellar
velocity dispersion Nelson  Whittle 1996 These studies
suggest that the mBH   relation either does not evolve
Shields et al 2003 Gaskell 2009 or does so weakly with
BHs  0103 dex more massive at z  1 Salviander et al
2006 Gu et al 2009 Woo et al 2008 Treu et al 2007
The evolution of the BH scaling relations has also been
studied using numerical simulations eg Robertson et al
2006 Johansson et al 2009 and semi-analytic models eg
Malbon et al 2007 Lamastra et al 2010 Kisaka  Kojima
2010 Robertson et al 2006 employed simulations of ide-
alised galaxy mergers initialised to have properties typical
of merger progenitors at various redshifts to construct the
relation between galaxy stellar mass m and  as a func-
tion of redshift and found that at a given value of  the
corresponding mBH decreases mildly with increasing red-
shift At z  1 the simulations of Di Matteo et al 2008
have BHs that lie slightly above the z  0 normalization
of the mBH   relation However these simulations were
stopped at z  1 and so cannot inform us about the evo-
lution of the mBH   toward lower redshift However for
z  1 they predict a weak evolution in the mBH  relation
such that at higher redshift galaxies of a given velocity dis-
persion contain slightly less massive BHs Johansson et al
2009 employed similar numerical techniques to argue that
it is unlikely that BHs are able to form signicantly be-
fore their host bulges Semi-analytic models that reproduce
many redshift zero properties of galaxies also predict that
at a xed  BH masses decrease with increasing redshift
Malbon et al 2007 These theoretical models thus pre-
dict evolutionary trends that go in the opposite direction
to those inferred from observations Finally the models of
Hopkins et al 2009 predict that at a xed stellar veloc-
ity dispersion BH masses at higher redshift are either the
same for mBH  108 M or slightly more massive for
mBH  108 M at xed  than their redshift zero coun-
terparts in agreement with observation
On the other hand the relation between BH mass and
galaxy bulge mass shows a positive evolution in both semi-
analytic models Malbon et al 2007 Hopkins et al 2009
and numerical simulations Di Matteo et al 2008 the mag-
nitude of which is comparable to that observed The larger
spread in the predictions for the evolution of the mBH  
relation may reect that it is more dicult to predict veloc-
ity dispersions which depend on both mass and size than
it is to predict masses
In Booth  Schaye 2009 hereafter BS09 we pre-
sented self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations of the co-
evolution of the BH and galaxy populations that reproduce
the redshift zero BH scaling relations These same simula-
tions also match group temperature entropy and metallic-
ity proles as well as the stellar masses and age distribu-
tions of brightest group galaxies McCarthy et al 2010 In
Booth  Schaye 2010 hereafter BS10 we used the same
simulations as well as an analytic model to demonstrate
that mBH is determined by the mass of the dark matter
DM halo with a secondary dependence on the halo con-
centration of the form that would be expected if the halo
binding energy were the fundamental property that controls
the mass of the BH In the present work we use the same
models to investigate why and how the BH scaling relations
evolve for massive galaxies
This paper is organised as follows In Sec 2 we sum-
marise the numerical methods employed in this study and
the simulation analysed In Sec 3 we present predictions for
the evolution of the BH scaling relations and compare them
to observations We nd that the evolution in the mBH  m
relation predicted by the simulations is in excellent agree-
ment with the observations while the measured weak evo-
lution in the mBH   relation is in apparent disagreement
and predict that while BH mass increases with redshift for
xed halo mass the relations between mBH and the binding
energies of both the host galaxies and DM haloes do not
evolve We demonstrate in 4 that the a analytic description
in which mBH is coupled to the DM halo binding energy
can reproduce the evolution of the relation between BH and
halo mass Furthermore we show that the evolution in the
relations between the BH and the stellar mass and binding
energy can be understood in terms of the more fundamental
relation with the binding energy of the dark halo and the
growth of massive galaxies through dry mergers Finally we
summarise our main conclusions in Sec 5
2 NUMERICAL METHOD
We have carried out a cosmological simulation using a signif-
icantly extended version of the parallel PMTree-Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics SPH code gadget iii last de-
scribed in Springel 2005 The simulation and code are
described in detail in BS09 we provide only a brief sum-
mary here In addition to hydrodynamic forces we treat
star formation Schaye  Dalla Vecchia 2008 supernova
feedback Dalla Vecchia  Schaye 2008 radiative cool-
ing Wiersma et al 2009a chemodynamics Wiersma et al
2009b and black hole accretion and feedback BS09
Springel et al 2005 We summarise in Sec 21 the essen-
tial features of the BH model
The properties of central galaxies and DM haloes
are calculated by rst identifying the most gravitationally
bound particle in each DM halo using the algorithm subfind
Springel et al 2001 Dolag et al 2009 which is then con-
sidered the halo centre All stars within a radius of 015rhalo
are then assigned to the central galaxy We note that our
ccid13 2010 RAS MNRAS 000 18
conclusions are insensitive to the exact choice for this ra-
dius and whether we use a xed physical value or a xed
fraction of the halo virial radius As long as the sphere en-
closes the central object our results are insensitive to this
choice Halo mass mhalo is calculated as the total mass
enclosed within a sphere centred on the most bound par-
ticle in the halo that has a mean density of 200 times the
mean density of the Universe and the virial radius rhalo is
the radius of this sphere Because it is not expected that the
same physics holds for both the central galaxy of a halo and
its satellites which are expected to rapidly have their gas
supply stripped when they become satellites our analysis is
restricted to BHs identied as residing in the central galaxy
in a DM halo dened as the galaxy closest to the centre of
the DM potential well of each halo
21 The black hole model
Seed BHs of mass mseed  103mg  105 M  where mg is
the simulation gas particle mass  are placed into every DM
halo that contains more than 100 DM particles which cor-
responds to a DM halo mass of 41  1010 Mh and does
not already contain a BH particle Haloes are identied by
regularly running a friends-of-friends group nder during the
simulation After forming BHs grow by two processes accre-
tion of ambient gas and mergers Gas accretion occurs at the
minimum of the Eddington rate mEdd  4GmBHmprTc
s  v232 where mp is the pro-
and maccr  4G2m2
ton mass T is the Thomson cross-section r is the radia-
tive eciency of the BH c is the speed of light cs and 
are the sound speed and gas density of the local medium v
is the velocity of the BH relative to the ambient medium
and  is a dimensionless eciency parameter The parame-
ter  accounts for the fact that our simulations possess nei-
ther the necessary resolution nor the physics to accurately
model accretion onto a BH on small scales Note that for
  1 this accretion rate reduces to the so called Bondi-
Hoyle Bondi  Hoyle 1944 rate
BHc2
As long as we resolve the scales and physics relevant
to Bondi-Hoyle accretion we should set   1 If a simu-
lation resolves the Jeans scales in the accreting gas then it
will also resolve the scales relevant for Bondi-Hoyle accre-
tion onto any BH larger than the simulation mass resolution
BS09 We therefore generally set  equal to unity How-
ever this argument breaks down in the presence of a multi-
phase interstellar medium because our simulations do not
resolve the properties of the cold molecular phase and as
such the accretion rate may be orders of magnitude higher
than the Bondi-Hoyle rate predicted by our simulations for
star-forming gas We therefore use a power-law scaling of
H in star-
the accretion eciency such that   nHn
H  01 cm3 is the critical density
forming gas where n
for the formation of a cold star-forming gas phase The pa-
rameter  is a free parameter in our simulations We set
  2 but note that the results shown here are insensitive
to changes in this parameter when   2 We note that we
do not resolve the Bondi radius of BHs less massive than
the particle mass in our simulations and that for BHs with
mBH  mg the Bondi radius is unresolved unless the density
is low or the temperature high Our choice of   1 there-
fore provides an underestimate of the true accretion rate in
these regimes However even setting   100 for all densi-
ccid13 2010 RAS MNRAS 000 18
Evolution of the black hole scaling relations
ties gives very similar results Booth  Schaye 2009 This
is because all BHs accrete almost all of their mass in short
near Eddington-limited bursts of accretion and thus that
our treatment of accretion in low-density environments is
less important The accretion model in high-density environ-
ments is necessarily very crude but we note that our results
are insensitive to the details of the accretion model as long
as  is suciently large that the BHs become more massive
than observed in the absence of feedback and if two reason-
able conditions are met that are necessary for self-regulation
to be possible Firstly the BH accretion rate must increase
with increasing density and secondly it must increase with
BH mass see BS09
Energy feedback is implemented by allowing BHs to in-
ject a xed fraction of the rest mass energy of the gas they
accrete into the surrounding medium The energy deposition
rate is given by

Shakura  Sunyaev 1973 and use f  015 as our ducial
value It was shown in BS09 that for f  015 this simu-
lation reproduces the observed redshift zero mBH  m and
mBH relations Energy is returned to the surroundings of
the BH thermally by increasing the temperature of Nheat
of the BHs neighbouring SPH particles by at least Tmin A
BH performs no heating until it has built up enough of an en-
ergy reservoir to heat by this amount Imposing a minimum
temperature increase ensures that the radiative cooling time
is suciently long for the feedback to be eective We set
Nheat  1 and Tmin  108 K but the results are insensitive
to the exact values of these parameters see BS09
22 The cosmological simulation
The simulation employed in the current work uses a cu-
bic box of size 50 comoving Mpch and assumes periodic
boundary conditions The simulation contains 2563 particles
of both gas and collisionless cold DM and is evolved down to
redshift zero The DM and initial baryonic particle masses
are 41  108 Mh and 87  107 Mh respectively Co-
moving gravitational softenings are set to 125 of the mean
interparticle separation down to z  291 below which they
switch to a xed proper scale of 2 kpch The simulation
employed in this study was previously also analysed as the
ducial simulation in BS09 and BS10
Comparison of the simulation employed in this study
to an otherwise identical one with eight two times lower
mass spatial resolution informs us in what mass and red-
shift range the relations between mBH and galaxy and halo
properties are numerically converged The relation between
mBH and both m and mhalo is numerically converged up
to redshift two for all haloes with mBH  10 mseed Mea-
surements of stellar velocity dispersion are however only
converged for z  1 and mBH  102 mseed We will only give
results for redshifts and BH masses for which the results are
converged with respect to numerical resolution
We note that these simulations do not resolve the scales

lar masses  1011 M We show a number of dierent mass cuts
for the simulation results to demonstrate that the results are in-
sensitive to the particular mass cut chosen Both the simulations
and observations in this plot show the total stellar mass of the
galaxies The simulation predicts that the median mBHm ratio
increases with redshift The predictions are in excellent agreement
with the observations regardless of the particular mass cut made
on which the BH is the gravitationally dominant compo-
nent in the galaxy and so cannot be used to study BH self-
regulation on the smallest scales However the simulations
do have sucient resolution for baryons to be gravitationally
dominant in the centres of haloes We cannot conclusively
rule out that if we increased our mass resolution signi-
cantly and used more sophisticated sub-grid models that the
BH would self-regulate on dierent scales However sugges-
tively in Booth  Schaye 2010 we veried that in simula-
tions with a spatial resolution of 05 kpch that at z  2 the
BH masses scale in the same way as in the lower-resolution
simulations

and galaxies
Fig 1 compares the predicted evolution of the median
mBHm ratio for dierent minimum stellar left panel and
BH right panel masses with observations of AGN in galax-
ies with m  1011 M The mBHm ratio increases with
redshift in close agreement with observations Merloni et al
2010 Decarli et al 2010 At redshift zero this agreement is
unsurprising because the eciency of AGN feedback in the
simulation was tuned to reproduce the normalisation of the
z  0 BH scaling relations The agreement at higher redshift
represents however a non-trivial prediction of a model in
which BHs self-regulate their accretion through the coupling
of a small fraction of the radiative energy to the ambient
medium
In Table 1 we show the predicted evolution up to z

and semi-analytic models Malbon et al 2007 Taken to-
gether the simulation predicts that the mBH  m and

Uhalo is 101  014 096  017 and the slope of the relation be-
tween mBH and U is 093007 096009 consistent with the
z  0 observational results of Feoli  Mele 2007 and Feoli et al
2010 At all redshifts these slopes are consistent with unity The
slopes of the relations between mBH and m  and mhalo are
116  006 12  02 46  08 44  08 and 15  02 15  03
There is thus no evidence for evolution in any of the slopes which
agrees with the results of Robertson et al 2006 for the mBH 
relation and with Di Matteo et al 2008 for the mBH  m rela-
tion The slopes of the z  0 relations are consistent with obser-
vations Haring  Rix 2004 Tremaine et al 2002 Bandara et al
ccid13 2010 RAS MNRAS 000 18
mBH   relations evolve such that the relation between
mBH and stellar binding energy  m2
 is independent of
redshift s  005  006
It is tempting to conclude from the nding that the
ratio mBHm2
 does not evolve that the BH mass is de-
termined by the binding energy of the galaxy However we
demonstrated explicitly in BS10 that the BH mass is instead
controlled by the binding energy of the DM halo This im-
plies that the binding energy of the galaxy tracks the binding
energy of the halo which we will conrm and explain below
32 The evolving relations between black holes
and dark matter haloes
We now turn our attention to the relations between the mass
of the BH and the DM halo in which it resides In BS10 we
argued that a BH grows until it has injected an amount of
energy into its surroundings that scales with the binding
energy of its host DM halo We therefore do not expect the
mBH  Uhalo relation to evolve Indeed in the simulation the
amplitude of this relation is independent of redshift with
s  003  005 as would be expected for a fundamental
link between mBH and the binding energy of the host DM
We do however expect the relation between mBH and
mhalo to evolve At higher redshift haloes of a given mass
are more compact than their redshift zero counterparts and
are thus more strongly gravitationally bound This means
that at a xed halo mass more energy is required to eject
gas from haloes at high redshift and in order to self-regulate
BHs must grow to be more massive Fig 2 shows the normal-
isation of the mBH  mhalo relation as a function of redshift
and conrms that the simulation predicts the amplitude of
this relation to increase with redshift red dashed curve

4 EXPLAINING THE EVOLUTION
As we already noted the idea that the binding energy of
the dark halo controls the mass of the BH explains our nd-
ing that the mBH  Uhalo relation is independent of red-
shift We will now show that the analytic model of BS10
also reproduces the evolution of the mBH  mhalo relation
and that it can explain the observed evolution in the scaling
relations with the stellar properties if the observed galaxies
evolve predominantly through dry mergers as predicted by
the simulation

are included The grey region represents the allowed range in evo-
lution predicted by the analytic model of BS10 which assumes
that the BH mass is controlled by the binding energy of the DM
halo The binding energy of an NFW halo depends on mass red-
shift concentration which itself depends on both mass and red-
shift and on the radius rej at which it is evaluated The grey

simulations BS10 nd 155  005 for the same simulation
as is analyzed here3 we would need to use x  022
By using an NFW density prole and Eq 5 we have
implicitly assumed that the dark matter prole is well de-
scribed by the results obtained from simulations that in-
clude only dark matter Duy et al 2010 have recently
shown that on the scales of interest here the back-reaction
of the baryons onto the dark matter is in fact very small
if feedback from AGN is included as required to reproduce
the observed stellar and gas properties of groups of galaxies

2010 Duy et al 2010
If as argued in BS10 the BH mass is controlled by the
DM halo binding energy then we expect the mBH  mhalo
relation to evolve because the halo binding energy depends
not only on halo mass but also on the virial radius and
concentration both of which vary with redshift for a xed
halo mass
If the c  mhalo relation did not evolve then we would
expect mBHmhalo  1z Eq 3 However because halo
concentration decreases with redshift Eq 5 we expect the
actual evolution of the mBH  mhalo relation to be weaker
ie s  1 The resulting relation between BH mass and DM
halo binding energy predicts that at a given mhalo mBH in-
creases with redshift and that by z  2 BHs are between
15 for rejrhalo  01 and 26 for rejrhalo  10 times
more massive than at redshift zero For our ducial radius
of self-regulation of x  022 BHs are 21 times more mas-
sive in excellent agreement with the simulation prediction
of s  065  006 Table 1
The evolution predicted by Eqs 3 - 5 is shown in Fig 2
The grey shaded region outlines the analytic prediction for
the evolution in BH mass over the range rejrhalo  01 10
and the solid black line shows the prediction for rejrhalo 
022 the value that reproduces the slope of the redshift zero
mBH  mhalo relation The red dotted curve shows the sim-
ulation prediction for the evolution of the mBH  mhalo re-
lation including all BHs with mBH  102 mseed At all red-
shifts the normalisation of the simulated mBH  mhalo rela-
tion is compatible with that predicted by the analytic model
For comparison the dashed black line shows the predicted
evolution of the mBH  mhalo relation if cmhalo were inde-
pendent of redshift The analytic model can only reproduce
the simulation result if the evolution of the concentration-
mass relation is taken into account
The evolution of the mBH mhalo relation thus provides
additional evidence for the idea that the masses of BHs are
determined by the binding energies of the haloes in which
they reside
42 The relations between mBH and galaxy stellar
properties
Considering now only the stellar masses for which the evo-
lution has been measured observationally m  1011 M
and the redshift range for which all of the stellar and BH
properties of the galaxies are converged numerically z  1
we ask if we can explain how the relations between BH mass
3 We quoted a slope of 15  02 Our error bar is greater because
BS10 used mBH  10mseed whereas we require mBH  100mseed
Figure 3 Galaxy properties as a function of redshift for m 
1011 M at each redshift we selected the 20 galaxies with stellar
masses closest to this value The yellow shaded region shows the
area that contains the 25th to 75th percentiles of the data and
the black solid curve shows the median The top panel shows the
ratio of stellar to halo binding energy and the bottom panel shows
the specic star formation rate SSFR mm The dashed line
in the bottom panel shows the inverse of the age of the Universe
Galaxies with SSFRs below this line may be considered passive
and galaxy stellar properties evolve BS10 showed that the
BH mass is determined by the binding energy of the DM
halo which explains why the mBH  Uhalo relation does not
evolve We nd that the mBH  U relation also does not
evolve implying that over the range of redshifts and masses
investigated here U  Uhalo The top panel of Fig 3 con-
rms that this is indeed the case in our simulation
For the binding energy of the galaxy to track that of the
halo we require the two to grow through the same mech-
anism This condition is met if the galaxies grow primarily
through dry mergers In the absence of signicant in-situ star
formation both the stellar component which is predomi-
nantly spheroidal for massive galaxies and the DM halo are
collisionless systems and are therefore expected to evolve in
a similar manner
The bottom panel of Fig 3 shows that at z 
1 the specic star formation rates SSFR msm of
galaxies with m  1011 M are signicantly lower than
the inverse of the Hubble time 1tH
implying that
the galaxies are indeed not growing signicantly via in-
situ star-formation
in agreement with various observa-
tions eg Schawinski et al 2006 van der Wel et al 2009
Bezanson et al 2009 van Dokkum et al 2010 The analy-
sis in Fig 3 was carried out for galaxies at a xed stellar
mass but the same results hold if we trace individual galax-
ies through time While the stellar masses of the most mas-
sive z  0 galaxies grew on average by a factor 265 since
z  1 the fraction of stars in the redshift zero objects with
birth redshifts below z  1 is on average only 15
Merloni et al 2010 studied the evolution of the BH
ccid13 2010 RAS MNRAS 000 18
scaling relation in the redshift range 1  z  22 and found
that at z  1 a large fraction of galaxies would be identi-
ed as star-forming This is consistent with our results as
the SSFRs of our galaxy sample are increasing with increas-
ing redshift so that a signicant fraction of them would be
identied as star-forming at z  1 The fraction would be
even higher if we had required the galaxies to contain active
AGN as is the case for the objects selected in the observa-
tions because AGN activity is typically accompanied by a
temporary increase in the star formation rate
One might naively think that the mBH  m relation
should not evolve at all if the galaxies grew predominantly
through dry mergers However the progenitors of galaxies
with m  1011 M at z  0 typically formed their stars and
grew their BHs later than the progenitors of galaxies that
already have the same stellar mass at z  1 Because the pro-
genitors of higher redshifts galaxies formed earlier they have
higher binding energies and thus greater BH masses relative
to their halo masses Thus even if m  1011 M galaxies
are growing predominantly by dry mergers at both redshifts
they may have dierent BH masses Observe however that
the evolution in the mBH  m relation that we predict for
these massive galaxies is only mild about 02 dex see Fig 1
and that in situ star formation thus become important for
z  1 see Fig 3
If the ratio of the stellar to halo binding energies re-
mains constant we can write
mBH  Uhalo  U  m2
To explain the evolution of mBHm that is observed for
m  1011 M and which the simulation reproduces we
need to know how the m   relation evolves for such
galaxies
Measurements of the evolution of the m   relation
have so far only been undertaken for a small number of
objects Cappellari et al 2009 presented stacked observa-
tions of seven galaxies with m  1011 M in the redshift
range 16  z  20 and found that these galaxies typically
have the same  as the very highest velocity dispersion
early-type galaxies of the same mass in the local Universe
This is in agreement with observations showing that galax-
ies of a given stellar mass are more compact at higher red-
shifts see eg Williams et al 2010 Indeed for early-type
galaxies with stellar masses  1011 M Cenarro  Trujillo
2009 nd that typical velocity dispersions decrease from
 240 kms at z  16 to  180 kms at z  0 which
implies   1  z03 Combined with Eq 6 this yields
mBHm  1  z06 in good agreement with the s  05
that is observed for galaxies of this mass
5 CONCLUSIONS
We have used a self-consistent cosmological simulation that
reproduces the observed redshift zero relations between mBH
and both galaxy and halo properties as well as the thermo-
dynamic proles of the intragroup medium to investigate
how and why these relations evolve through time
The relation between BH mass and host galaxy mass
predicted by the simulation is consistent with available ob-
servations at z  2 which are currently conned to m 
1011 M galaxies For such galaxies we predict that the ratio

with s  03 in apparent conict with recent observa-
tions The ratio between the BH mass and the binding en-
ergy of the dark halo is independent of redshift in agreement
with BS10 who argued that the BH mass is controlled by the
halo binding energy The simple analytic model of BS10 in
which the BH mass is assumed to scale in proportion to the
binding energy of the dark halo not only reproduces the
simulated redshift zero mBH  mhalo relation but also its
evolution For a xed halo mass BHs are more massive at
higher redshift because the haloes are more compact and
thus more tightly bound Assuming an NFW halo density
prole and the evolution of the halo concentration-mass rela-
tion predicted by simulations the model can quantitatively
account for the predicted evolution
The simulation predicts that the ratio between the
BH mass and the binding energy of the stellar component
of the galaxy is also independent of redshift at least for
m  1011 M and z  1 even though BS10 demonstrated
explicitly that the correlations between BH mass and stel-
lar properties are not fundamental This result is however
consistent with a picture in which massive galaxies grow
primarily through dry mergers at low redshift which we
showed to be the case in the simulation Combined with the
observed evolution in the m   relation this idea can
quantitatively account for the evolution in the mBH  m
relation
One interesting implication of this scenario is that the
evolution of the relations between BHs and the properties of
their host galaxies may dier for galaxies that do not grow
predominantly through dry mergers as would be expected
for lower masses and at higher redshifts We will investigate
this further in the a future work employing higher resolution
simulations
