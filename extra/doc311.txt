Abstract
Self-gravitating systems evolve toward the most tightly bound conguration
that is reachable via the evolution processes that are available to them
They do this by spreading  the inner parts shrink while the outer parts
expand  provided that some physical process eciently transports energy
or angular momentum outward The reason is that self-gravitating systems
have negative specic heats As a result the evolution of stars star clusters
protostellar and protoplanetary disks black hole accretion disks and galaxy
disks are fundamentally similar How evolution proceeds then depends on the
evolution processes that are available to each kind of self-gravitating system
These processes and their consequences for galaxy disks are the subjects of
my lectures and of this Canary Islands Winter School
I begin with a review of the formation growth and death of bars Then
I review the slow secular rearrangement of energy angular momentum
and mass that results from interactions between stars or gas clouds and
collective phenomena such as bars oval disks spiral structure and triaxial
dark halos The existence-proof phase of this work is largely over we have
a good heuristic understanding of how nonaxisymmetric structures rearrange
disk gas into outer rings inner rings and stu dumped onto the center The
results of simulations correspond closely to the morphology of barred and
oval galaxies Gas that is transported to small radii reaches high densities
Observations conrm that many barred and oval galaxies have dense central
concentrations of gas and star formation The result is to grow on timescales
of a few Gyr dense central components that are frequently mistaken for
classical elliptical-galaxy-like bulges but that were grown slowly out of the
disk not made rapidly by major mergers The resulting picture of secular
galaxy evolution accounts for the richness observed in galaxy structure
John Kormendy
We can distinguish between classical and pseudo bulges because the latter
retain a memory of their disky origin That is they have one or more
characteristics of disks 1 atter shapes than those of classical bulges
2 correspondingly large ratios of ordered to random velocities 3 small
velocity dispersions  with respect to the Faber-Jackson correlation between
 and bulge luminosity 4 spiral structure or nuclear bars in the bulge
part of the light prole 5 nearly exponential brightness proles and 6
starbursts So the cleanest examples of pseudobulges are recognizable
However pseudo and classical bulges can coexist in the same galaxy
I review two important implications of secular evolution
1 The existence of pseudobulges highlights a problem with our theory of galaxy
formation by hierarchical clustering We cannot explain galaxies that are
completely bulgeless Galaxy mergers are expected to happen often enough
so that every giant galaxy should have a classical bulge But we observe that
bulgleless giant galaxies are common in eld environments We now realize
that many dense centers of galaxies that we used to think are bulges were not
made by mergers they were grown out of disks So the challenge gets more
dicult This is the biggest problem faced by our theory of galaxy formation
2 Pseudobulges are observed to contain supermassive black holes BHs but
they do not show the well known tight correlations between BH mass and the
mass and velocity dispersion of the host bulge This leads to the suggestion
that there are two fundamentally dierent BH feeding processes Rapid global
inward gas transport in galaxy mergers leads to giant BHs that correlate with
host ellipticals and classical bulges whereas local and more stochastic feeding
of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies evidently involves too little energy
feedback to result in BH-host coevolution It is an important success of the
secular evolution picture that morphological dierences can be used to divide
bulges into two types that correlate dierently with their BHs
I review environmental secular evolution  the transformation of gas-rich
star-forming spiral and irregular galaxies into gas-poor red and dead S0
and spheroidal Sph galaxies I show that Sph galaxies such as NGC 205
and Draco are not the low-luminosity end of the structural sequence
the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies
Instead Sph galaxies
have structural parameters like those of low-luminosity SIm galaxies
Spheroidals are continuous in their structural parameters with the disks of S0
galaxies They are bulgeless S0s SIm S0Sph transformation involves
a variety of internal supernova-driven baryon ejection and environmental
processes e g ram-pressure gas stripping harassment and starvation
Finally I summarize how hierarchical clustering and secular processes can
be combined into a consistent and comprehensive picture of galaxy evolution
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
11 Introduction
These lectures review the slow secular evolution of disk galaxies both
internally and environmentally driven As a heuristic introduction at a
2011 winter school they emphasize a qualitative and intuitive understanding
of physical processes This provides a useful complement to Kormendy 
Kennicutt 2004 which is a more complete review of technical details and
the literature Since this is a school my lectures will be as self-contained as
possible There will therefore be some overlap with the above review and
with Kormendy 1981 1982b 1993b 2008a b Kormendy  Cornell 2004
Kormendy  Fisher 2005 2008 and Kormendy  Bender 2012
111 Outline
The secular evolution of disk galaxies has deep similarities to the evolution
of all other kinds of self-gravitating systems I begin by emphasizing these
similarities
In particular the growth of pseudobulges in galaxy disks is
as fundamental as the growth of stars in protostellar disks the growth of
black holes in black hole accretion disks and the growth of proto-white-dwarf
cores in red giant stars A big-picture understanding of these similarities is
conceptually very important The associated physics allows us to understand
what kinds of galaxies evolve secularly and what kinds do not This review
discusses only disk galaxies secular evolution of ellipticals is also important
but is less thoroughly studied
Galaxy bars are important as engines that drive secular evolution so
I provide a heuristic introduction to how bars grow and how they die Then
I review in some detail the evolution processes that are driven by bars and
by oval disks and the formation of the various kinds of structures that are
built by these processes I particularly emphasize the growth and properties
of pseudobulges Based on this I summarize how we recognize pseudobulges
and connect them up with our overall picture of galaxy formation
Two consequences among many of secular evolution are particularly
important I review the problem of understanding pure-disk galaxies These
are galaxies that do not contain classical bulges We infer that they have
not experienced a major merger since the rst substantial star formation
Many have barely experienced secular evolution We do not know how these
galaxies are formed Second I review evidence that classical bulges coevolve
with their supermassive black holes but pseudobulges do not
Next I discuss secular evolution that is environmentally driven Here I
concentrate on the evidence that gas-rich star forming spiral and irregular
galaxies are transformed into gas-poor red and dead S0 and spheroidal
John Kormendy
galaxies I particular emphasize the properties of spheroidals  that is tiny
dwarfs such as Fornax Draco and UMi and larger systems such as NGC 147
NGC 185 and NGC 205 These are in essence bulgeless S0 galaxies And
I review the various transformation processes that may make these objects
Finally I tie together our picture of galaxy formation by hierarchical
clustering and galaxy merging lectures by Isaac Shlosman Nick Scoville and
Daniela Calzetti and the secular evolution that is the theme of this School
112 Fast versus slow processes of galaxy evolution
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 emphasize that the Universe is in transition
from early times when galaxy evolution was dominated by fast processes 
hierarchical clustering and galaxy merging  to a future when merging will
largely be over and evolution will be dominated by slow processes Fig 11
Fig 11 Processes of galaxy evolution updated from Kormendy 1982b and from
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 Processes are divided vertically into fast top
and slow bottom Fast evolution happens on a free-fall dynamical timescale
tdyn  G12 where  is the density of the object produced and G is the
gravitational constant Slow means many galaxy rotation periods Processes are
divided horizontally into ones that happen internally in one galaxy left and ones
that are driven by environmental eects right The processes at center are aspects
of all types of galaxy evolution My lectures are about slow processes both internal
Sections 12  16 and environmentally driven Section 17
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
We have a well developed picture of galaxy formation that mostly
involves the processes in the upper-right corner of Fig 11 Quantum
density uctuations in non-baryonic dynamically cold dark matter form
immediately after the Big Bang and then get stretched by the expansion
of the Universe Gravity drives hierarchical clustering that causes these
uctuations to grow separate out from the expansion of the Universe
collapse and form galaxy halos The baryons rst go along for the ride and
later cool inside the halos to form stars and visible galaxies Spiral galaxies
form when halos quiescently accrete gas that dissipates and forms disks
Ellipticals form when galaxies collide and merge then dynamical violence
scrambles disks into ellipsoidal ellipticals It is a convincing story developed
in Toomre 1977a White  Rees 1978 Kaumann et al 1993
Steinmetz  Navarro 2002 2003 and many other papers Quoting Binney
2004 Cold Dark Matter theory has now reached the point at which it
should be admitted as a Candidate Member to the Academy of Established
Theories so that it can sit alongside the established theories of Maxwell
Einstein and Heisenberg
Now we are making a transition to a time in the far future when the
Universe will have expanded so much that most mergers that ever will
happen will already have happened Even now major mergers  dened
as ones in which the less-massive progenitor is within a factor of say
5  10 of the mass of the bigger progenitor  are uncommon Minor mergers
remain common now but will also get less common in the future As this
happens more and more galaxies spend more and more of their time not
undergoing fast and violent evolution events And between such events 
that is between galaxy collisions and mergers  galaxies in isolation do not
just sit and age their stars
Instead galaxies evolve on slow timescales
that is timescales that are much longer than the crossing time or the
collapse time We call such slow processes secular At present both
fast and slow processes are important
It is easy to nd especially in
cluster environments good examples of galaxies whose histories have been
dominated by fast processes They are the ellipticals and the classical bulges
of disk galaxies Elsewhere particularly in eld environments it is easy
to nd galaxies whose evolution has almost entirely been secular Both
of these types of galaxies are relatively easy to recognize But it is also
important to understand that both kinds of processes can be important in
a single galaxy and in particular that a galaxy can contain both a classical
merger-built bulge and a pseudo secularly built bulge Recognizing this
is dicult and indeed not always possible We will spend some considerable
eort on understanding how to dierentiate classical and pseudo bulges
John Kormendy
Beginning with the seminal paper of Toomre 1977a most work on galaxy
formation over the last 35 years has concentrated on hierarchical clustering
The idea of secular evolution got its start at almost the same time some of
the earliest papers on the subject are Kormendy 1979a 1979b 1981 and
Combes  Sanders 1981 But research on this subject remained for many
years a series of largely isolated cottage industries that did not penetrate
the astronomical folklore This changed very rapidly in the last decade In
particular Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 aimed to combine the cottage
industries into a general and well articulate paradigm on secular evolution
that complements hierarchical clustering Now this subject has become
a major industry Whole meetings have been devoted to it This is the
motivation that underlies the present Canary Islands Winter School
113 A comment about the name pseudobulges
As in Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 I use the name pseudobulge for all
high-density distinct central components of galaxies that are grown slowly
out of disks and not rapidly by galaxy mergers They divide themselves
into at least three subtypes that involve dierent formation processes Boxy
bulges in edge-on galaxies are bars seen side-on Combes  Sanders 1981
Bars are disk phenomena I will call these boxy pseudobulges Second
dense central components are grown out of disks when nonaxisymmetries
transport gas toward the center where it feeds starbursts Often these
are recognizably more disky than merger-built bulges But they are not
guaranteed to be at Still it is often useful to refer to them as disky
pseudobulges when we need to dierentiate them from boxy pseudobulges
Third nuclear bars are a recognizably distinct subset of disky pseudobulges
What problem am I trying to solve by calling all of these pseudobulges
Astronomers have a long history of inventing awkward names for things
For historical reasons we have two dierent names for the products of major
galaxy mergers If a merger remnant does not have a disk around it we
call it an elliptical But if an elliptical subsequently accretes cold gas
and grows a new disk e g Steinmetz  Navarro 2002 then we call it a
bulge In particular I will call it a classical bulge This is inconvenient
when one wants to refer to all elliptical-galaxy-like merger remnants without
prejudice as to whether they have associated disks Some authors call
these spheroidal galaxies This is exceedingly misleading because the
same name is used for dwarf galaxies such as Draco and Fornax that are
essentially bulgeless S0s see Section 17 here Another alternative is to
call them hot stellar systems This is misleading because some ellipticals
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
have lower velocity dispersions than some pseudobulges and indeed also than
some lenses which certainly are disk components I could dene the term
ellipsoidals to mean both classical bulges and ellipticals But this name
has no constituency So I will explicitly say bulges and ellipticals when I
need to refer to both at once
I do not want the same problem to happen with pseudobulges
12 Self-gravitating systems evolve by spreading
This is the most fundamental section of this review I want to give you a
heuristic intuitive understanding of why secular evolution happens in disk
galaxies And I want to show you how the evolution of essentially all self-
gravitating systems is fundamentally similar The theme of this Winter
School is the disk-galaxy version of that more general evolution
I made this point in Kormendy  Fisher 2008 and in Kormendy 2008a
However it is important enough  especially at a school  that I repeat it
here in detail The following is a slightly expanded and paraphrased version
of the discussion in Kormendy 2008a
The general principle that drives the evolution of self-gravitating systems
is this it is energetically favorable to spread That is as energy or angular
momentum is transported outward the inner parts shrink and grow denser
while the outer parts expand grow more diuse and in some cases escape
the system How to see this depends on whether the system is dominated
by rotation or by random motions
121 If dynamical support is by random motions
For systems that are dominated by velocity dispersion the argument is given
by Lynden-Bell  Wood 1968 and by Binney  Tremaine 1987 The
essential point is that the specic heat of a self-gravitating system is negative
Consider an equilibrium system of N particles of mass m radius r and three-
dimensional velocity dispersion v The virial theorem tells us that 2 KE 
PE  0 where the kinetic energy is KE  N mv22 and the potential energy
is PE  GN m2r The total energy E  KE  PE  KE is negative
This is what it means to be a bound system But the temperature of
the system is measured by v2 mv22  3kT 2 So the specic heat
C  dEdT  dN mv22dv2 is also negative
In the above G is
the gravitational constant and k is Boltzmanns constant
The system is supported by heat so evolution is by heat transport If the
center of the system gets hotter than the periphery then heat tends to ow
John Kormendy
outward The inner parts shrink and get still hotter This promotes further
heat ow The outer parts receive heat they expand and cool Whether
the system evolves on an interesting timescale depends on whether there is
an ecient heat-transport mechanism For example many globular clusters
evolve quickly by two-body relaxation and undergo core collapse Giant
elliptical galaxies  which otherwise would evolve similarly  cannot do so
because their relaxation times are much longer than the age of the Universe
122 If dynamical support is by rotation
Tremaine 1989 provides a transparent summary of an argument due to
Lynden-Bell  Kalnajs 1972 and to Lynden-Bell  Pringle 1974 A disk
is supported by rotation so evolution is by angular momentum transport
The goal is to minimize the total energy at xed total angular momentum
A rotationally supported ring at radius r in a xed potential r has specic
energy Er and specic angular momentum Lr given by
  and Lr  cid18r3 d
dr cid1912
Then dEdL  r where   r1ddr12 is the angular speed of
rotation Disks spread when a unit mass at radius r2 moves outward by
gaining angular momentum dL from a unit mass at radius r1  r2 This is
energetically favorable the change in energy

is negative because r usually decreases outward Thus disk spreading
leads to a lower energy state
In general disk spreading outward
angular momentum ow and energy dissipation accompany one another
in astrophysical disks Tremaine 1989
123 Spreading in various kinds of self-gravitating systems
The consequences are very general All of the evolution summarized in
Fig 12 happens because of the above physics
Globular clusters open clusters and the compact nuclear star clusters
in galaxies are supported by random motions Absent any gas infall they
spread in three dimensions by outward energy transport The mechanism
is two-body relaxation and the consequences are core collapse and the
evaporation of the outer parts
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Fig 12 Powerpoint slide that emphasizes the underlying similarity in evolutionary
processes that shape various kinds of self-gravitating systems The secular evolution
of galaxy disks top row is the subject of my lectures
Stars are spherical systems supported by pressure They spread in three
dimensions by outward energy transport The mechanisms are radiation or
convection mediated by opacity Punctuated by phases of stability when
nuclear reactions replace the energy that is lost stellar evolution consists
of a series of core contractions and envelope expansions One result is red
supergiants containing cores that will become white dwarfs neutron stars
or stellar mass black holes
Protoplanetary disks are supported by rotation they spread in two
dimensions by outward angular momentum transport The tendency toward
energy equipartition between low-mass and high-mass objects has the
consequence that big planets sink by inging smaller planets outward
the evolution results from the interaction of a big planet with a collective
phenomenon such as a spiral density wave in gas or rubble then the eect
is the same The results are hot Jupiters and colder Neptunes or rubble
Protostars are spherical systems coupled to circumstellar disks by
magnetic elds that wind up because of dierential rotation This drives
jets that look one-dimensional but that really are three-dimensional they
John Kormendy
carry away angular momentum and allow the inner circumstellar disk to
shrink and accrete onto the star Shu et al 1994 1995
An accretion disk around a black hole is supported by rotation so it
evolves by angular momentum transport The evolution happens because of
magnetic coupling between various parts of the accretion disk The details
are complicated but the net eect is that some material ows outward as
part of a jet and other material is accreted onto the black hole Note again
that pictures of this process  whether observations of radio jets or artists
conceptions of the accretion process  almost always show narrow jets But
as in the case of protostars outward angular momentum transfer must be
involved in order for some of the material to accrete onto the black hole
Galactic disks are supported by rotation They spread in two dimensions
by outward angular momentum transport Ecient engines are provided by
bars and by oval disks Like all of the above the evolution is secular  slow
compared to the collapse time or crossing time of the disk The growth of
a pseudobulge in a galactic disk is as natural as the growth of a star in a
protostellar disk and as the growth of a black hole in a black hole accretion
disk Only the processes that transport angular momentum are dierent
This secular evolution is the subject of my paper and this Winter School
124 What kinds of galaxy disks evolve secularly
For secular evolution to happen a galaxy needs two things
It needs a
driving mechanism such as a bar a globally oval disk Section 133 or
global spiral structure And disk spreading must be energetically favorable
Equation 12 tells us that it is more energetically favorable to transport
angular momentum outward the more the angular rotation velocity r
decreases outward This lets us divide galaxies into three types as follows
Galaxies that lack driving agents should not show strong secular evolution
Examples are unbarred galaxies with classical bulges and weak or no global
spiral structure e g M 31 NGC 2841 and NGC 4594 the Sombrero
Galaxy We will see that these objects generally do not show centrally
concentrated molecular gas and star formation We take this as an sign that
secular evolution largely is not happening
For galaxies with engines Fig 13 shows how the tendency to evolve
depends on the mass distribution as revealed by the rotation curve V r
Where V r increases proportional to r or even rather more slowly
the angular rotation velocity r is constant or very slowly decreasing
outward This means that it is not energetically favorable to evolve This
is the situation in an Scd galaxy like M 33 where we nd no pseudobulge
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Fig 13 Typical examples of spiral galaxies that do NGC 4736 bottom and do
not M 33 top have mass distributions that are conducive to secular evolution
The top-left plots Kormendy  Norman 1979 show a generic rotation curve V r
and associated angular velocity curves r  V rr and   2 where  is
the epicyclic frequency Where V  r   constant and secular evolution is
not energetically favorable Even where V r is turning downward from V  r
toward V  constant  decreases outward so slowly that secular evolution is
disfavored This is the situation throughout a galaxy like M 33 top-right rotation
curve and rotation curve decomposition from Corbelli  Salucci 2000 M 33 has
neither a classical bulge nor a signicant pseudobulge
In contrast NGC 4736
image at bottom-left from httpwwwwikiskyorg has a rotation curve that
decreases outward with radius as derived by de Blok et al 2008 bottom-right
panel here Disk spreading is energetically very favorable Moreover NGC 4736 is
a prototypical strongly oval galaxy so it has an engine for secular evolution Not
surprisingly it is our best poster child for secular evolution  an unbarred galaxy
with a pseudobulge identied by ve classication criteria Section 153
John Kormendy
The Corbelli  Salucci 2000 decomposition of the M 33 rotation curve
into contributions due to the stellar disk the gas disk and the dark matter
halo reveals an additional reason why secular evolution is disfavored The
contribution of the dark matter to V r is everywhere comparable to or
larger than that of the visible matter But dark halos are dynamically
much hotter than disks They do not participate in disk dynamics The
observation that the self-gravity of the disk is diluted by the gravity of
the much stier halo is a further sign that secular evolution is disfavored
Kormendy  McClure 1993 show that M 33 contains a nuclear star cluster
like a large globular cluster but no signicant evidence for a pseudobulge
In contrast if a galaxy has a at rotation curve then   1r and secular
evolution is energetically favorable top-left panels of Fig 13 Even more
extreme are galaxies in which the rotation curve decreases outward De Blok
et al 2008 conclude that the rotation curve of NGC 4736 decreases outward
Fig 13 bottom-right Under these circumstances secular evolution
should be especially important In fact NGC 4736 turns out to be our best
poster child for secular evolution in an unbarred galaxy see also Fig 16
Section 133 Fig 18 Fig 128 Fig 131 Fig 135 Fig 138 Table 13
It will turn out that angular momentum redistribution and therefore radial
mass transport happens mostly to gas The need for gas disfavors early-type
galaxies and favors late-type galaxies
Putting all this together we can already foresee what the observational
review in the rest of this paper will reveal Secular evolution in galaxy disks
in the current Universe happening mostly in intermediate-late-type
e g Sbc galaxies These are the galaxies in which pseudobulges turn
out to be most prominent Secular evolution is too slow to be important
in the latest-type galaxies because the mass distribution is too uy and
so it is not energetically favorable to transport angular momentum outward
And secular processes no longer transport much gas in S0 and Sa galaxies
because they no longer contain much gas Nevertheless 1 purely stellar
secular processes are expected to happen in these galaxies and 2 secular
evolution is believed to have been important in the past because many S0
galaxies are observed to contain disky pseudobulges
I turn next to a discussion of our motivation and where it will lead us
 This result depends on the assumption that the gas is on circular orbits everywhere in the
galaxy and that asymmetries in the velocity eld and in the galaxy image Fig 13 bottom-
left are due to warps These assumptions are not valid NGC 4736 has an oval disk Bosma
et al 1977 Kormendy 1982b 1993b Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 Fig 18 here A suitable
analysis of the velocity eld based on plausible axial ratios for the inner disk and outer ring has
not been made However it is likely that the true rotation curve decreases outward more slowly
than Fig 13 suggests Nevertheless disk secular evolution is more energetically favorable in
NGC 4736 than it is in most galaxies

13 The study of galaxy evolution  structural components
An important goal of extragalactic astronomy is to understand the structure
of galaxies as encoded e g in the classication schemes of Hubble 1936
de Vaucouleurs 1959 and Sandage 1961 1975 An updated version of
Hubble classication is shown in Fig 14 and a perpendicular cut through
de Vaucouleurs classication volume at stage Sb is shown in Fig 15 For
each kind of galaxy we want to understand the present structure and the
formation and evolution processes which created that structure
Our picture of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering and our Schools
subject of secular evolution are both important in creating the structures
in Figs 14 and 15 Ellipticals and classical elliptical-galaxy-like bulges
of disk galaxies form by hierarchical clustering and major mergers I review
this in Section 18 and Isaac Shlosman discusses it in his lectures Bulges
are usually classical in S0  Sb galaxies Secularly built pseudobulges are
not distinguished in Hubble classication but they are already important
in some S0s and they become the usual central component at type Sbc
and in later types Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 Unlike these permanent
components spiral density waves are temporary features of disks that mostly
last only as long as they have driving engines Toomre 1977b 1981
Fig 14 Revised Hubble classication Kormendy  Bender 1996 recognizing the
dierence the E  E dichotomy between boxy slowly rotating ellipticals that
have cores and disky-distorted more rapidly rotating and coreless ellipticals that
are continuous in their properties with S0s Ellipticals are understood to form via
rapid processes i e by major mergers and violent relaxation These are reviewed
in Section 18 where I discuss galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering S0 and
spheroidal galaxies not included in Hubble types form  I suggest  at least mostly
by environmental secular evolution Section 17 Spiral galaxies evolve partly
by rapid processes mergers make classical bulges shown orange in the gure
However the evolution of many spirals has been dominated by secular processes
including the formation of pseudobulges also shown in orange because Hubble
classes do not distinguish between classical and pseudo bulges

131 Inner rings r and outer rings R
Figure 14 omits several regular features in galaxy structure that we need to
understand The most important of these are encoded in de Vaucouleurs
1959 more detailed classication illustrated here in Fig 15 Rotate the
tuning fork diagram in Fig 14 about the E  S0 axis In the plane of the
page de Vaucouleurs retains the distinction between unbarred SA and
barred SB galaxies The new third dimension above and below the page
is used for the distinction between galaxies that do or do not contain inner
rings Fig 15 is a perpendicular cut through this classication volume
Fig 15 Perpendicular cut at type Sb through the galaxy classication volume as
dened by de Vaucouleurs 1959 I am grateful to Ron Buta for this version from

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Figure 16 top illustrates the distinction bottom half of Fig 15
between SBs galaxies in which two global spiral arms begin at the ends
of the bar and SBr galaxies in which there is a ring of stars and gas
surrounding the ends of the bar and the spiral arms start somewhere on this
ring In Figures 15 and 16 there is a prominent nearly straight dust lane
on the rotationally leading side of the bar in SBs galaxies Notwithstanding
Fig 15 there is generally no such dust lane in SBr bars Sandage 1975
Note in NGC 2523 that the inner ring is patchy and blue and contains young
stars like the outer disk but unlike the relatively red and dead bar and
pseudobulge This is a common property of inner rings
Fig 16 top Contrast SBs and SBr structure left SBsbc galaxy NGC 1300
has two global spiral arms that begin at the ends of the bar right The SBrbc
galaxy NGC 2523 has a somewhat more multi-armed but still global spiral pattern
with arms that begin from the inner ring not necessarily at the end of the bar
bottom Galaxies with outer rings left the RSBlens0a galaxy NGC 1291
and right the RSAlensab galaxy NGC 4736 The latter is a prototypical oval
galaxy It contains a pseudobulge that is identied by no less than ve classication
criteria from Section 153 NGC 2523 is a Hubble Heritage image NGC 2523
is from Adam Block NOAOAURANSF NGC 1291 and NGC 4736 are from

Figure 16 bottom shows another feature that is recognized by de
Vaucouleurs and Sandage although it is not given a separate classication bin
in diagrams like Fig 15 Both barred and unbarred galaxies can contain
outer rings R at approximately twice the radius of the inner disk
The properties of inner and outer rings are discussed for example in
Kormendy 1979b 1981 1982b Buta 1990 1995 2011 2012 Buta 
Crocker 1991 Buta  Combes 1996 and Buta et al 2007 I particularly
use the following
a Inner rings essentially always encircle the end of the bar
b Outer rings typically have radii  12 times the radius of the bar There is no
overlap in the distribution of radii of inner and outer rings
c Both inner and outer rings typically contain H i gas and star formation
d Inner rings typically have intrinsic axial ratios of  085  010 with the long
axis parallel to the bar Buta 1995
e Outer rings typically have intrinsic axial ratios of  087  014
In most
galaxies the long axis is perpendicular to the bar as seen face-on but a few
outer rings are elongated parallel to the bar Kormendy 1979b Buta 1995
f Figure 15 contains one mistake There is no continuity between the inner rings
in unbarred and barred galaxies Instead SA inner rings are similar to nuclear
star-forming rings in SB galaxies see Fig 131 in Section 151 Nuclear rings
are always much smaller than inner rings Comeron et al 2010
All of the above structural properties are natural products of the secular
evolution that I review in these lectures
132 Lens Components lens
Lenses are the nal morphological component that we need to recognize
observationally and to understand within our picture of galaxy evolution
There is much confusion in the literature about lenses
It is unfortunate
that de Vaucouleurs chose to use the name lenticular for S0 galaxies I
empathize a bulge-dominated edge-on S0 such as NGC 3115 or NGC 5866
is indeed shaped rather like an edge-on glass lens But this is due to the
combination of a thick bulge and a thin disk it does not happen because
these S0s contain lens components
In fact most unbarred S0s do not
contain lens components whereas some Sa and Sb galaxies  particularly
barred ones  do contain lens components We need to overcome the
confusion that results from use of the misleading name lenticular galaxy
In all of my papers including this one I avoid use of the name lenticular
galaxy and always call these objects S0 galaxies And I try to identify
lens components strictly using the following denition
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Fig 17 left Color JHK image of the SAlens0 galaxy NGC 1553 from the
2MASS Large Galaxy Atlas Jarrett et al 2003 image from NED The lens is the
elliptical shelf in the brightness distribution interior to the outer exponential disk
It is best seen in the V -band major-axis brightness prole shown in the right panel
Freeman 1975 The straight line is an exponential t to the disk prole
A lens component is an elliptical shelf in the brightness distribution of
a disk galaxy That is it has a shallow brightness gradient interior to a
sharp outer edge Typical face-on lenses have axial ratios of  085  09
Lenses occur most commonly in barred galaxies then the bar almost always
lls the lens in one dimension NGC 1291 in Fig 16 is an RSBlens0a
example of this conguration Lenses can also occur in unbarred galaxies
the prototypical example is the SAlens0 galaxy NGC 1553 Fig 17
It is important to note that there is no overlap in the intrinsic ellipticity
distributions of bars and lenses Bars always have much smaller pole-on
axial ratios of 
 14 So bars and lenses are clearly dierent even though
both occur only in disk galaxies A lens and an inner ring of the same size can
occur together e g NGC 3081 The properties of lenses are established
in Kormendy 1979b and in Buta 2011 2012 Buta et al 1996 2007
I will argue in Sections 1434  1436 that lenses are defunct bars That
is following Kormendy 1979b 1981 1982b I suggest that bars evolve
away into lenses when the secular evolution that they drive increases the
central mass concentration so much that the elongated bar orbits can no
longer precess together at the same bar pattern speed p
I use the notation SAlens and SBlens respectively for unbarred and
barred galaxies with lenses Buta et al 2007 uses the letter el I do not
do this only because it is dicult to distinguish el from the number 1
John Kormendy
It will turn out that lenses outer rings inner rings and pseudobulges
are like the more familiar classical bulges bars and disks in the sense that
they are distinct components in the structure of galaxies that retain their
essential character over many galaxy rotations They are dierent from
spiral arms which are density waves in the disk that last  more or less 
only as long as the engine that drives them Still there are many ways
in which the above components can be combined into a galaxy This results
in de Vaucouleurs classications that may be as complicated as RSBrbc
or RSBlens0a NGC 1291 in Fig 16 This complication makes many
people uneasy However I emphasize Every letter in such a complicated
galaxy classication now has a physical explanation within our picture of
secular galaxy evolution
It is a resounding testament to the educated
eyes of classiers such as Allan Sandage and Gerard de Vaucouleurs that
they could pick out regularities in galaxy structure that ultimately were
understandable in terms of galaxy physics
133 Oval Disks
Fundamental to our understanding of the engines that drive secular evolution
is the observation that many unbarred galaxies nevertheless are not globally
axisymmetric The inner disks of these galaxies typically have intrinsic
axial ratios of  085 Bars are more elongated typical axial ratio  02
but a much smaller fraction typically 
 13 of the disk participates
Observations indicate that oval disks are approximately as eective in
driving secular evolution as are bars
Oval galaxies can be recognized independently by photometric criteria
Kormendy  Norman 1979 Kormendy 1982b and by kinematic criteria
Bosma 1981a b They are illustrated schematically and with observations
of prototypical galaxies in Fig 18 The photometric criteria are
a The disk consists of two nested ovals each with a shallow brightness gradient
interior to a sharp outer edge
b The outer oval has a much lower surface brightness than the inner oval It can
consist of a featureless disk e g in an S0 galaxy or spiral arms that make a
pseudo  not quite closed outer ring or a complete outer ring
c The nested ovals generally have dierent axial ratios and position angles so
they must be oval if they are coplanar But the atness of edge-on galaxies at
these fairly high surface brightnesses shows that these disks are oval
NGC 4736 and NGC 4151 are outer ring and outer spiral arm versions of
oval galaxies Fig 18 I use the notation SAoval or SBoval  exactly
analogous to SAlens or SBlens  for galaxies with oval disks
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Fig 18 Criteria for recognizing unbarred oval galaxies shown schematically top
and with observations of NGC 4736 and NGC 4151 adapted from Fig 9 in
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 The image of NGC 4736 is from my IIIa-J plate
taken with the 19 m Palomar Schmidt telescope The image of NGC 4151 is from
httpwwwwikiskyorg The H i velocity contours of NGC 4736 and NGC 4151
are from Bosma et al 1977a and from Bosma et al 1977b respectively
John Kormendy
The kinematic criteria for recognizing ovals are that the velocity eld is
symmetric and regular but
a the kinematic major axis twists with radius
b the optical and kinematic major axes are dierent and
c the kinematic major and minor axes are not perpendicular
Here observation a is equally consistent with a warp But b and c point
uniquely to an oval velocity eld that is seen at a skew orientation Given
this conclusion observation a then means that the intrinsic orientations of
the outer and inner ovals are dierent Usually the outer oval is elongated
perpendicular to the inner one as seen face-on My favorite poster child for
secular evolution NGC 4736 shows all of these eects The classical Seyfert 1
galaxy NGC 4151 shows them even more clearly Fig 18
Figure 19 shows four more oval galaxies I use it to emphasize four points
1 Oval galaxies are very recognizable and very common It is curious that they
have not better penetrated the astronomical folklore Kormendy  Kennicutt
2004 show that they are important engines for secular evolution

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
2 There is a complete structural continuity in outer ring galaxies from RSB
objects that have strong bars to RSA objects that are completely barless
NGC 2859 is one of the best examples of an RSBlens0 galaxy in which the
bar lls the lens in one dimension Another excellent example is NGC 3945
Kormendy 1979b Fig 117 and Fig 124 here NGC 3504 and NGC 3368
are two examples among many of galaxies that have well dened oval disks and
extremely weak bars I have typed them as roval and soval because there
is a bright blue rim of star formation around the outside of the inner oval
exactly as in many rlens galaxies I am not aware of any measurements of
the bar strength that take into account the oval structure But the bars that
are revealed by the 2MASS survey at K  band must be only a few percent of
the disk light NGC 1068 is classied as unbarred by Sandage 1961 and by
Buta et al 2007 there is a hint of a bar in the 2MASS image Jarrett et al
2003 NGC 4736 is a purely unbarred oval galaxy
3 Albert Bosma has advocated for many years that lens and oval components
are the early-Hubble-type and later-Hubble-type versions of the same kind of
structure For many years I was unsure about whether or not to believe
I am now convinced that Albert is exactly correct The reasons are
discussed in Sections 1434  1436 Here I juxtapose RSBlens and
RSABoval galaxies in Fig 19 to emphasize their similarity I will continue
to use this notation throughout this review but I want to make it clear that
I believe that lens and oval structures are fundamentally the same
4 There also is a continuity from complete outer rings R such as the one in
NGC 2859 through spiral arms that are distorted until they almost closed to
form what is called a pseudoring R as in NGC 3504 through to spiral arms
that are less  but similarly  distorted as in NGC 4151 Fig 18 here and
NGC 1300 compare Fig 16 here with Fig 13 in Kormendy 1979b See de
Vaucouleurs 1959 de Vaucouleurs et al 1991 RC3 and Buta 2011 2012
for further discussion
All of these continuities prove to have important physical interpretations
within our developing picture of disk-galaxy secular evolution Most of them
are reviewed in the following sections The stellar dynamics of RSr
galaxies are discussed in Lia Athanassoulas 2012 third lecture
Further examples of the above structures are shown in Ron Butas 2012
lectures and in the de Vaucouleurs Atlas of Galaxies Buta et al 2007
 The RSAovalab galaxy NGC 4736 Figs 13 16 18 128 131 135 138 contains a
nuclear bar but no main bar The nuclear bar provides a connection to barred galaxies that
is relevant in Section 1528 But it is much too small to aect the overall evolution of the
galaxy NGC 4736 is therefore completely unbarred for the purposes of the present discussion
Similarly NGC 1068 Fig 19 also has a nuclear bar but no main bar
I suggest that the
connection between these two nuclear bars and their host oval disks is not an accident  that
in fact oval disks are the late-type analogs of lenses and thus were once barred see point 3
The hint is that some nuclear bars can survive even after the main bar has evolved away

134 Classical versus physical morphology of galaxies
At the start of a new science it is common to classify the objects under
study into natural groups Morgan 1951 whose members share observed
characteristics that are judged to be important The success of the taxonomy
depends on how well the natural groups  the classication bins  prove
to correlate with physics The galaxy classication scheme of Hubble
1936 and Sandage 1961 as augmented by de Vaucouleurs 1959 won
a Darwinian struggle between taxonomic systems because it succeeded best
in ordering galaxies by properties that helped us to understand galaxy
formation and evolution Ron Buta 2012 reviews this subject in his lectures
at this School
It is important  and fundamental to the aims of this paper  to
contrast morphological galaxy classication as practiced in the early days of
extragalactic research with what becomes necessary as the subject matures
Sandage and Bedke 1994 emphasize the importance early on of not being
led astray by preconceptions The extreme empiricist claims that no
whi of theory may be allowed into the initial classication procedures
decisions and actions Nevertheless every classier chooses which features
to consider as important and which to view as secondary Hubble succeeded
because he chose properties that became important to our understanding
Sandage recognizes this Hubble correctly guessed that the presence or
absence of a disk the openness of the spiral-arm pattern and the degree of
resolution of the arms into stars would be highly relevant Hubble based
his classication on choices made with future interpretation in mind
In contrast Kormendy 2004a At the level of detail that we nowadays
try to understand the time has passed when we can make eective progress
by dening morphological bins with no guidance from a theory Breaking
down the wall between morphology and interpretation successfully has
always been a sign of the maturity of a subject For example without
guidance from a theory how would one ever conceive of the complicated
measurements required to see solar oscillations or use them to study the
interior structure of the Sun In the same way we need the guidance of a
theory to make sense of the bewildering variety of phenomena associated
with galaxies and to recognize what is fundamental and what is not
This motivates a physical morphology Kormendy 1979a b 1981 1982b
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 not as a replacement for classical morphology
 which remains vitally important  but as a step beyond it Physical
morphology is an iteration in detail that is analogous to de Vaucouleurss
iteration beyond the Hubble tuning fork diagram
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
One purpose of this review is to bring this process up to date Our
aim is to engineer the best one-to-one correspondence that we currently can
between recognized types of galaxies or galactic building blocks and physical
processes of galaxy formation
It is reasonable to expect that an improved understanding of galaxies will
show that an initial classication missed some physics Also some features
of galaxies could not early on be observed well enough to be included in
the classication Two substantial additions and one small tweak to classical
morphology are needed here The small tweak is to recognize that nuclear
star-forming rings are distinct from and often occur together with inner rings
r in barred galaxies This was point f in Section 131 The rst major
correction is to recognize and dierentiate between real and counterfeit
ellipticals Section 17 The second is to recognize and dierentiate between
real and counterfeit bulges The latter are pseudobulges Section 15
An essential aspect of physical morphology is to treat galaxies as being
composed of a small number of building blocks the distinct components in
the mass distribution The problem that this solves and the benets that it
provides were described as long ago as Kormendy 1979a
Classical morphology assigns a classication cell to each list of galaxy
characteristics As we look at galaxies more and more closely the list
of observed characteristics becomes alarmingly large Thus the revised
morphological types of de Vaucouleurs already require about one hundred
cells de Vaucouleurs 1963 and still do not recognize features such as lenses
It is dicult to attach dynamical signicance to the bewildering variety of
forms that the system describes
In physical morphology we aim to identify as distinct components groups
of stars or gas whose structure dynamics and origin can protably be
thought of as distinct from the dynamics and origin of the rest of the galaxy
   The large number of cells in classical morphology is now thought of as
the many ways that components and their secondary behavior such as spiral
structure can be combined to make a galaxy The strength of this approach
is twofold It breaks up the complicated problem of galaxy structure into
smaller and more manageable pieces to which it is easier to attach dynamical
interpretations Secondly investigations of correlations and interactions
between components are very ecient in suggesting previously unrecognized
dynamical processes emphasis added Thus the component approach
provides an ecient framework for studies of galaxy dynamics
Throughout this review my aim is to tweak the distinctions between
galaxy components and hence their names until they are both correct
descriptions and uniquely tied to physical processes of galaxy formation

14 A Heuristic introduction to bars and spiral structure
Bars are the most important drivers for secular evolution in galactic disks
we will see them again and again throughout this School For this reason I
now want to give you a heuristic introduction to bar dynamics and evolution
Lia Athanassoula 2012 will talk about this subject in more detail Here
I concentrate on a simple version of the essential physics that you need to
understand in order to have an intuitive feel for how bars form grow and
die Bars are density waves in the disk That is the bar pattern rotates
more-or-less rigidly at a single pattern angular velocity p whereas the
angular velocity r of material in the disk varies with radius This is
even more true of spiral structure over most of a global spiral pattern the
stars and gas have   p they catch up to the spiral arms from behind
move through them in the rotation direction lingering in the arms to give
them their density enhancement and then move on in the rotation direction
toward the next arm Since bars and spirals have some similarities I briey
discuss spiral structure too
141 Orbital resonances in a galactic disk
Orbital resonances are the key to understanding bars and spirals The
main resonances  inner Lindblad resonance corotation and outer Lindblad
resonance  will recur in many of the lectures at this school I therefore need
to introduce them in some detail
The general orbit of a star in a galactic disk is an unclosed rosette because
the potential is not Keplerian that is the galaxy mass is distributed in
radius and not all in one central point as in for example the Solar System
Figure 110 shows disk orbits as seen in a frame of reference that rotates
clockwise orange arrow at the pattern speed p of some coherent structure
In this gure I show a spiral arm red because spirals almost always trail in
the rotation direction that is the arm is convex in the direction of rotation
Thus it is easy to remember the rotation direction at a glance I work in
the epicyclic approximation Mihalas  Routly 1968 Binney  Tremaine
1987 in which radial excursions are small Then at the radius where the
stars and the pattern corotate i e where p   green a stellar orbit
is a small elliptical epicycle around the mean radius The motion around
the ellipse is counterclockwise because the forward velocity is higher when
the star is closer to the center than average In the epicyclic approximation
the motion around the ellipse is simple harmonic Corotation is the most
important resonance in the galaxy because the mean position of the star
with respect to the global pattern never changes as long as p is xed
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Fig 110 Schematic illustration of galactic orbits as seen in a frame of reference
that rotates clockwise orange arrow at the pattern angular velocity p of some
coherent structure such as a spiral arm red The pattern stays xed as we view it
whereas stars drift with respect to the pattern forward clockwise inside corotation
and backward counterclockwise outside corotation At the corotation resonance
green p   a star with a small component of random velocity added to
 executes simple harmonic motion counterclockwise around a closed ellipse the
epicyclic approximation At the inner Lindblad resonance blue p    2
where  is the epicyclic frequency the stellar orbit is closed and the star executes
two radial excursions for every revolution forward around the center At the outer
Lindblad resonance red p  2 the orbit is closed and the star executes two
radial excursions for every revolution backward around the center in the rotating
frame At other radii several of which are shown the stellar orbits are unclosed
John Kormendy
We will need the epicyclic frequency  of the small radial and azimuthal
excursions around the mean motion
r cid18 V
dr cid19 
where V r is the rotation velocity as a function of radius r
If we move slightly inward from corotation toward the galactic center
then a star oscillates around almost-closed ellipses while drifting forward
with respect to the global pattern leftmost orbit illustrated in Fig 110
Contining toward smaller radii next three orbits inward in Fig 110 the
forward drift gets faster until the backward loop disappears and we end up
with an unclosed rosette orbit that involves somewhat more than two radial
excursions for every revolution forward in the rotation direction around the
center
It is clear that as we move farther inward and the forward drift
rate continues to increase the orbit again becomes almost closed now with
almost exactly two radial excursions for every revolution this is the second-
innermost orbit shown in the gure
Continuing toward still-smaller r we arrive at inner Lindblad resonance
ILR where the blue orbit is closed and the star executes exactly two radial
excursions while it drifts forward with respect to the global pattern by one
complete revolution around the center This happens where p    2
ILR is again an important resonance because the star repeatedly has the
same phase in its radial oscillation when it has the same position with respect
to the global pattern So the star interacts more strongly with the pattern
near ILR than it does elsewhere in the disk Moreover ILR gives us a
rst-order understanding of bar dynamics as discussed in the next section
Starting at corotation and moving outward stars drift backward with
respect to the global pattern as seen in our rotating frame At some large r
the orbit is closed as the star makes two radial oscillations for every
revolution backward around the center the orbit is not illustrated This is
outer Lindblad resonance OLR and it happens where p    2
The generic rotation curve V r and frequencies r and r  r2
are shown in Fig 13 Where V  r   2  and   2  0 Where
V  constant   2  and  2  1 12  decreases proportional
to  In between   2 rst rises and then falls with increasing r as the
rotation curve turns downward from V  r to V  constant The radial
range over which   2 varies little with radius turns out to be crucial to
the formation of bars and spiral arms The evolving height and radial extent
of the   2 maximum proves to control the fate of bars And the natural
pattern speed for bars proves to be p    2 As follows
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
142 Bars and spirals as almost-kinematic density waves
The essential insight into the dynamics of bars and global spirals is due to
Lindblad 1956 and Kalnajs 1973 see Toomre 1977b for a lucid review
It is illustrated in Fig 111 Especially for outward-rising rotation curves
M 33 and even for nearly constant or falling rotation curves M 81 the
angular precession rate   2 of ILR orbits is small and nearly constant
over much of the galaxy Suppose that   2 is exactly constant with r
Then If closed ILR orbits are arranged to produce a trailing spiral
enhancement in density top left or a straight bar top right the orbits
will precess together at exactly the same   2 and so will preserve the
spiral or bar shape These are purely kinematic density waves
Fig 111 bottom Frequencies   and  2 for almost-circular orbits in M 33
Shu et al 1971 and M 81 Visser 1980 Both galaxies have large radial ranges
in which   2  constant and ILR orbits precess almost together top left
From Kalnajs 1973 elliptical ILR orbits aligned to produce a spiral density wave
top right From Englmaier  Gerhard 1997 examples of principal orbit families
for a bar oriented at 45 The elongated orbits parallel to the bar are the x1 family
out of which the bar is constructed If   2  constant with radius over the
extent of the x1 orbits they precess together and preserve the bar shape Interior to
ILR the x2 orbits are perpendicular to the bar The almost-square orbit has four
radial oscillations for each revolution it is a 41 ultraharmonic resonance orbit
John Kormendy
it is the job of self-gravity to keep the orbits precessing exactly together
In practice   2 is not quite constant To make real bars or spirals
This discussion is a heuristic argument for another important conclusion
The natural pattern speed of a bar or global spiral is p    2 Note
in Fig 111 that this is much slower than  over most of the galaxy That
is stars and gas revolve around the galactic center more quickly than the
pattern rotates they catch up to the pattern from behind participate in
it for a time  lingering in the pattern and thereby enhancing its density
Toomre 1981  and then continue onward in the forward rotation direction
For bars corotation happens near the end of the bar or slightly beyond it
see Sellwood  Wilkinson 1993 for a review
Some barred galaxies that have substantial pseudobulges also have
nuclear bars  one-tenth of the radius of the main bar Section 1528
When the galaxy mass distribution is very centrally concentrated   2
has a high maximum at small radii frequency curves for M 81 in Fig 111
The natural pattern speed of a nuclear bar is roughly equal to the local value of
 2 and is therefore much higher than the pattern speed of the main bar
This is seen in numerical simulations Debattista  Shen 2007 Shen 
Debattista 2009 and in real galaxies Corsini et al 2003
The x1 family of closed bar orbits shown in Fig 111 and the similar
non-periodic orbits that are trapped around them by the bars self-gravity
involve large perturbations from circular orbits Strong bars are nonlinear
Then the approximations that we have made are not accurate In particular
the true pattern speed is rather larger than the local value of   2 e g
Shen  Debattista 2009 Nevertheless the epicyclic approximation still
captures the essence of the physics Ceverino  Klypin 2007
In particular for any realistic p    2 there must be an inner
Lindblad resonance in a centrally concentrated galaxy such as M 81 but
there cannot be an ILR in a pure-disk galaxy such as M 33 Inside ILR the
closed x2 orbits are elongated perpendicular to the bar Fig 111 So
they cannot be used to construct the bar and to maintain its self-gravity
We will see in Section 15 that the secular evolution of a barred galaxy is in
part to transport gas toward the center and thereby to build a pseudobulge
As secular evolution increases the central concentration of a barred galaxy
the inner maximum in  2 gets higher and wider in radius Therefore it
gets more dicult for self-gravity to keep the decreasing number of x1 orbits
precessing together Also the number of damaging x2 orbits increases The
bar gets weaker Thus bars naturally commit suicide by the secular evolution
that they drive This happens preferentially in early-type galaxies not in
galaxies such as M 33 All of these heuristic predictions prove to be accurate

143 The growth structural evolution and death of bars
This section is an overview of the life histories of bars  from rapid growth
through secular evolution in middle age through eventual death  at the
level that we need in this Winter School
I concentrate in this section
on the bars themselves the eects of bars on the other components in
their galaxies will be the subject of later sections
I will not cover the
rich dynamics of bars in their nonlinear phases For this work the best
review is Sellwood  Wilkinson 1993 Contact between the complicated
nonlinear dynamics that is reviewed there and the simplied story that I
tell here is not always good Thats where the frontier in this subject lies
Here I will summarize the most important bar evolution processes based on
a series of seminal papers Sellwood  Wilkinson 1993 hereafter SW93
provide more references and Athanassoula 2012 reviews  and indeed
advances  some of these subjects in her lectures at this School
My orientation is a little dierent from that of SW93 They take  as
much as possible in this complicated subject  a formal approach rooted in
the rigorous mathematics of galaxy dynamics I take an observers approach
That is I try to benet as much as possible from the insight gained from
analytical and n-body studies but I also put equal emphasis on letting the
observations suggest or in some cases prove which processes are at work
Sometimes observations hint that a process e g evolution of bars to lenses
takes place even when the theory of such a process is not well formulated
But asking the right question is the ecient road to progress So this
observational guidance is very useful One key is to remember which ideas
are hypotheses and which are proven And it is especially important not to
overinterpret the temptingly rich array of possibilities that are inherent in
this subject I will try to be clear about the condence with which various
ideas are suggested And I will emphasize what I believe are the most
important remaining problems
1431 Bar instability
Massive cold rotating disks are famously unstable to the formation of
bars e g Ostriker  Peebles 1973 Toomre 1977b 1981 SW93 Many
n-body studies start with a stellar disk that is highly unstable and then
follow the evolution of the bar that results Most results that are derived in
this way are probably realistic modulo important the neglect of gas and
dark matter However it is important to realize that bar evolution almost
certainly does not start this way It is unrealistic to think that a disk grows
axisymmetrically to a high mass meanwhile using up its gas to make stars
and only then discovers Oh my God that it is bar-unstable
John Kormendy
In a paper entitled Most Real Bars are Not Made by the Bar Instability
Sellwood 2000 expresses a related worry Most barred galaxies have enough
central mass concentration so the bar essentially must have an ILR That is
2 is similar to the curve for M 81 in Fig 111 Our heuristic arguments
in  142 then make plausible the result that also emerges from more detailed
studies e g Toomre 1981 namely that a bar instability never gets started
when the resulting bar would have a strong ILR Sellwood acknowledges
and dismisses the possibility that the disk might not originally have allowed
an ILR i e that the central concentration was manufactured by the bar
only after it formed One piece of supporting evidence was a conclusion
Abraham et al 1999 that strongly barred galaxies were rare at z  05
this is now known to be incorrect Jogee et al 2004 More immediate was
the concern that building up the central concentration weakens the bar I
will suggest below that bar suicide happens and it happens at a measurable
pseudobulge-to-disk ratio But I too have worried about why strong
bars can coexist with strong ILRs The evidence will suggest that when the
central mass grows slowly while the bar has a strong angular momentum sink
a nonlinear bar can  for a while  continue to grow even when it already has
an ILR But the more important point for the present section is this present
disk conditions do not favor the growth of bars by a simple instability
Possible implications
a Bar formation may be a threshold process that begins and then proceeds slowly
and perhaps episodically Sellwood 2000 as the disk grows massive enough
with respect to its dark halo see also Mihos et al 1997
b The formation of the stars that now make up the bars in early-type galaxies
happened long ago in progenitor galaxies about which we know very little E g
the boxy bulge  almost-end-on bar of our Galaxy is made of stars that are
very old and enhanced in  elements see Renzini 1999 for a review So its
stars formed over a period of 
 1 Gyr Gas fractions were much higher then
than they are now Genzel et al 2006 Gas may be centrally important to bar
formation Observations of high-redshift disks that are nevertheless younger
than our Galaxys bulge stars show surprises such as  108-M clumps and
high velocity dispersions Genzel et al 2006 Forster Schreiber et al 2009
The clumps are believed to form by violent instabilities and they eventually
merge to form at least some classical bulges Elmegreen et al 2008 Section
181 here None of this sounds like the typical initial conditions assumed in
n-body simulations of bar formation We have no reason to be condent that
we know how to start those simulations with realistic initial conditions
c Contrariwise a bar may form long after star formation makes the stellar disk
One way is thought to be through tidal tickling by neighboring galaxies e g
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Noguchi 1987 1988 1996 which also discusses gas infall Gerin et al 1990
Barnes et al 1991 Mihos et al 1997 It is dicult to test this for example by
looking for an excess of barred galaxies in dense environments such as the Coma
cluster The reason is that any extra tendency to form bars where there are
many galaxy encounters must compete with and may lose out to the stabilizing
eects of disk heating Marinova et al 2012 see Kormendy  Bender 2012 for
evidence that disk heating happens even in the Virgo cluster
d Occams razor is a dangerous weapon Answers are not guaranteed to be simple
All the above  i e a series of episodic encounter-driven growth spurts that
punctuate a steady slower growth by outward angular momentum transport
as envisaged by Sellwood 2000  may happen It is important to understand
that global spiral structure connected with a bar or inner ring is a signature
of outward angular momentum transport and therefore a sign that the bar is
growing stronger
In the next sections I review the life histories of bars and the evolution
that they drive in their host galaxies keeping the above issues in mind As
needed I emphasize where simulations do not yet include important physics
Limitations include 1 that many simulations do not include gas and gas
physics is variously but always importantly simplied 2 that continued
infall of gas and small galaxies is not included 3 that feedback from hot
young stars from supernovae and from active galactic nuclei is generally
not included and may be important and especially 4 that simulated
galaxies are usually not as multicomponent as real galaxies Two-body

1432 N -body simulations
Rapid bar growth via instability
followed by secular growth via angular momentum transport
Among the many published n-body studies of bar formation SW93 I focus
on Sparke  Sellwood 1987 because they analyze their simulation in ways
that tell us what we need to know The initial condition is an axisymmetric
galaxy with a bulge-to-total ratio of 03 The bulge is a rigid Plummer 1911
sphere with size  15 that of the disk A rigid potential is a limitation the
bulge gives the galaxy an ILR and it is interesting to see the surprising
lack of consequences but the bar and bulge cannot interact The disk is a

1964 axisymmetric stability parameter of Q  1 the initial disk was very
unstable The disk contained 50000 particles whose gravity was softened on
a length scale of 01 a Other limitations are that the model contains no gas
and no live dark matter halo of simulated particles both of these limit the
extent to which the bar sees a sink for angular momentum that allows it to
grow More detailed simulations can now be run but this subject does not
get the attention that it deserves and in particular analyses are not usually
as physically motivated and compelling as the one in Sparke  Sellwood
1987 There is much to be learned from this simulation as follows
Figure 112 shows the evolution of the disk density and Fig 113 shows
the growth in amplitude of the bar and the evolution of the pattern speed
of the bar and its associated spiral structure Time is measured in natural
units discussed in Sparke  Sellwood 1987 Beginning immediately and
extending to time 50 the disk rapidly grows a two-armed instability that
is bar-shaped near the center and a global two-armed spiral farther out
The bar rapidly grows stronger more stars participate the axial ratio of
the bar decreases the bar grows longer and its pattern speed decreases
Figure 113 dramatically reveals the important result that the pattern
speed of the bar is larger than the pattern speed of the spiral at all times
This is consistent with our heuristic argument the bulge creates a near-
central maximum in   2 and the pattern speeds of the bar at
relatively small radii and the spiral at relatively larger radii are comparable
to but slightly larger than the local value of   2 Note in Fig 113
frequency  2p because the pattern is bisymmetric Because p is smaller
for the spiral than for the bar the spiral continually shears away from the
bar It is no surprise that spiral arms do not necessarily start at the end of
the bar especially in galaxies such as NGC 2523 which have well developed
inner rings and which therefore are dynamically mature
Figure 113 makes it clear that the rapid instability-driven initial growth
of the bar is followed by a distinct later phase of secular growth when the bar
amplitude increases and p decreases more slowly than in the early rapid
phase In this collisionless model the outer disk has been heated so much
that the spiral structure is weak during the secular phase Fig 112 In real
galaxies there are two reasons why the later growth is more dramatic First
galaxies contain gas 1 its response is stronger than that of the stars and
in fact dissipative and 2 gas also keeps the stellar disk cooler and more
responsive because the stars that form from it are formed with low velocity
dispersions Second the dark halo in a real galaxy provides an additional
sink for the disk angular momentum
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
The bar ends roughly at corotation Therefore stars stream through the
bar density wave in the forward direction Analysis of the orbital structure
of the late-stage model shows that  as expected  the bar is made almost
exclusively of orbits trapped around the x1 family of closed orbits that align
with the bar Despite the presence of an IRL there are almost no orbits
analogous to the x2 family the model has only 50000 particles and not all
orbits were checked Additional details of the orbit structure are discussed
in Sparke  Sellwood 1987

Fig 113 Evolution of the bar in the n-body model of Sparke  Sellwood 1987
Panels a and b show the amplitude and phase of the bar as a function of time
A straight line is tted to the phases at late times It shows that the pattern speed
decreases quickly during the early rapid growth of the bar and then more slowly
during the later secular growth The bottom panels show contours of the square
root of the power in the bar or spiral perturbation as a function of frequency 
2p and radius Panel c is for the early part of the rapid growth up to time 31
and panel d is for the slow growth phase at times 40 to 103 A very important
conclusion is that the bar has a higher pattern speed than the spiral structure
Also note that the pattern speeds of both the bar and the spiral arms decrease
with time as shown for the bar in panel b The smooth curves show 2 solid
curve and 2  dashed curves for the initial axisymmetric model They apply
only approximately during the later nonlinear phases Nevertheless it is clear that
both the bar and the spiral have pattern speeds that are similar to but slightly
larger than the local values of  2 Also note that the bar develops despite the
fact that it has an ILR These are Figs 2 and 3 from Sparke  Sellwood 1987
Similar results are illustrated in Bournaud  Combes 2002

Comparison to real SB0 galaxies shows that the n-body bar model of
Sparke  Sellwood 1987 is realistic in many respects It has the shallow
density gradient and sharp outer edge of real bars in early-type galaxies It
has the rectangular shape observed e g in NGC 936 Fig 114 And it
shows qualitatively similar non-circular streaming motions At the end of
the simulation the disk is too hot to allow much spiral structure therefore
the bar has no live component with which it can eectively interact and as
a result it is very robust The situation in NGC 936 is similar the Toomre
1964 stability parameter in the outer disk is Q  3 to 4 so essentially no
small-scale structure is possible Kormendy 1984b Not surprisingly the
purely stellar-dynamical n-body model of Sparke  Sellwood 1987 is a
realistic simulation of an SB0 galaxy but not of a gas-rich barred spiral
Shortcomings of the model are easily linked to limitations in the physics
a The model is two-dimensional and therefore cannot include orbital complexity
including chaos that is fundamentally three-dimensional In particular the
bar cannot buckle and hence thicken in the axial direction Section 1433
b The lack of gas means that the model can simulate SB0 but not spiral galaxies
c The bar cannot grow very much at late times because the disk gets too hot The
same problem is well known in the context of understanding spiral structure
Quoting Toomre 1990 The gravitational forces involved in spiral structure
have the unwelcome side eect that they tend to increase the mean epicyclic
John Kormendy
motions of any stars    which take part Typically in just a few revolutions
these would-be participants become simply too hot to contribute appreciably
to any more fun In other words the vigor of these apparent spiral instabilities
was quickly recognized to doom any hopes for their longevity  unless one adds
some form of cooling    such as might be natural in a gas but surely not in a
disk of stars Toomre concluded that It really seems as if we typically need at
least to double the known amounts of reasonably active mass in the disks of Sc
galaxies  beyond the gas amounts that they are known to possess  in order
that such galaxies appear about as few-armed as they often are And from
where can they have obtained    such relatively cool additional disk material if
not from recent infall  emphasis added So another limitation of the Sparke
 Sellwood model  and of other n-body simulations  is the lack of continued
cosmological infall of cold gas Combes 2008a Bournaud  Combes 2002
d Lacking gas the bar cannot commit suicide by transporting gas to the center
and building a pseudobulge that makes it more dicult for x1 orbits to precess
together
I believe that n-body studies overestimate the robustness of bars
when they give them no opportunity to increase the central mass concentration
e Concurrently the bar cannot continue to grow stronger if the model does not
include a live halo of particles that can act as an angular momentum sink
These comments are not meant to be critical of Sparke  Sellwood 1987

study with the machinery that was available at the time
It focuses on
fundamentals that we need to understand Many n-body studies both before
and since have led to similar conclusion and have further extended our
understanding of bar evolution e g Athanassoula 2003 2005 2012
My remarks are meant to highlight how much this subject presents
opportunities to students now There is a danger that we may miss important
physics because we do not yet observe the early stages of bar formation This
is an opportunity for observers of high-z galaxies Modulo this uncertainty
I suggest that bars grow secularly via an ongoing competition between
outward angular momentum transport that strengthens the bar and the
buildup of pseudobulges that weaken the bar This competition allows some
barred galaxies to have both strong bars and high-mass pseudobulges that
create otherwise destructive ILRs near the center
Both the disk and the dark halo are angular momentum sinks For the
halo this conclusion is based mostly on n-body simulations e g Sellwood
1980 2006 2008 Athanassoula 2003 2005 Athanassoula  Misiriotis 2002
but note that Valenzuela  Klypin 2003 conclude that the eect is often
overestimated For the disk global spiral structure is the visible sign that
the process is ongoing
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Cold gas is important to the evolution for many reasons It makes the disk
more responsive both via its small velocity dispersion and by making new
stars that keep the disk cold Radial redistribution of gas is one product of
angular momentum transport And especially important is the conclusion
reviewed in the next sections that gas driven inward to the center builds
substantial pseudobulges in many galaxies The natural frequencies at which
ILR orbits want to precess therefore become less constant with radius When
this eect wins the above competition the bar is weakened or destroyed
Continued cosmological infall of cold gas is central to all of these processes
I argue in the rest of this review that many aspects of the above story are
well understood but that many opportunities remain to be explored
1433 Vertical buckling of bars and the formation of box-shaped bulges
The vertical thickening of bars into box-shaped bulges is reviewed from
a theoretical perspective in SW93 and from an observational perspective in
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 My review here is brief
N -body simulations show that strong bars thicken in the axial direction
until they look peanut-shaped when viewed side-on and box-shaped when
viewed at the most common orientations between side-on and end-on The
rst paper to show this  Combes  Sanders 1981  was one of the earliest
papers on galaxy secular evolution Two distinct processes are responsible
Figure 115 shows the evolution of an n-body bar that seen side-on turns
into a box-shaped bulge via a buckling instability in the axial direction
Raha et al 1991 The instability happens after the bar is well formed and
Fig 115 Face-on left and edge-on right views of the vertical buckling of an
n-body bar and the formation of a box-shaped bulge Figs 1 and 2 from Raha
et al 1991 The rotation period at the end of the bar is T  200 time units
John Kormendy
its growth is about as rapid as that of the original bar instability
Two bar rotations later the bar has weakend considerably grown more
centrally concentrated and become box- or peanut-shaped as seen side-on
The resemblance to box-shaped bulges in edge-on galaxies Section 1529
already noted by Combes  Sanders 1981 is compelling Many other
n-body studies reach similar results e g Athanassoula  Misiriotis 2002
Athanassoula 2003 2005 Athanassoula et al 2005 Shen et al 2010
A second mechanism by which bars may thicken in the axial direction is
via resonances between the rotation of the bar and the vertical oscillations
of disk stars e g Pfenniger 1984 1985 Combes et al 1990 Pfenniger 
Norman 1990 1991 Pfenniger  Friedli 1991 Hasan et al 1993 When the
vertical oscillation of stars is in resonance with the azimuthal rotation of a
bar each star repeatedly encounters the bar at a similar phase in its orbit
This pumps up the vertical velocity dispersion of disk stars and gives
the center a boxy appearance when viewed edge-on Unlike bar buckling
resonant heating is inherently a secular process
The relative importance of these two processes in making the observed
box-shaped bulges is not known However the most important conclusion
appears robust regardless of the answer when we see a boxy bulge in an
edge-on galaxy it is part of the bar and not a merger remnant We therefore
call these features box-shaped pseudobulges I return to them in Section
15 when I discuss the evolution that bars drive in their galaxies
1434 Bar suicide and the origin of lens components
I N -body simulations
Early n-body simulations suggested that bars are very robust see SW93
The reason is now clear those simulations contained no gas and so could not
engineer big changes in the central concentration of the mass distribution
More recent simulations which allow the galaxy to grow a central mass 
either by at or more naturally by rearranging the disk gas  show that
bars tend to commit suicide by the secular evolution that they drive
particular they force disk gas to fall toward the center where it builds up a
high-central-concentration pseudobulge and this causes the bar to weaken
Pseudobulge growth is covered in later sections The death of bars and their
evolution  I suggest  into lens components is discussed here
The earliest simulations of this process were motivated by the observation
that most galaxies contain central supermassive black holes Kormendy 
Richstone 1995 The earliest paper that I know Norman  Hasan 1990
already got essentially the modern answer It is estimated that a black hole
with mass equal to 17  the total mass is required to destroy the x1 family
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
of orbits and hence the bar No galaxy is known to have such a big black
hole Kormendy  Ho 2013 but we now know that a centrally concentrated
pseudobulge  although less eective than a point mass  has a similar eect
Hasan  Norman 1990 is a detailed followup Pfenniger  Norman 1990
concentrated on pseudobulge building by a combination of inward radial
gas ow and resonant vertical heating and they reached similar conclusions
about bars destruction Subsequent discussion has centered on the question
of how much central mass is needed to aect a particular degree of bar
weakening Apparent disagreements between papers mainly result from the
fact that uer central mass concentrations are less damaging to bars
Why central mass concentrations are destructive is easy to see using
Fig 111 and was summarized in Section 142 As the central mass increases
the central maximum in   2 becomes higher and broader in radius see
the panel for M 81 This shrinks the radius range in which   2 varies
slowly with radius and in which it is possible to have p   2 To
put it dierently the radius range between ILR and corotation in which
x1 orbits align with the bar gets smaller Recall that x2 orbits interior
to ILR align perpendicular to the bar So as the central concentration
increases there are fewer bar-supporting x1 orbits and they have a harder
time all precessing at the same rate p    2 As the bar potential
weakens self-gravity becomes less able to keep all the orbits precessing
together Once an orbit escapes from its alignment with the bar
phase-mixes azimuthally in a short time Even if there is no big change in
orbital eccentricities the long thin shelf in surface brightness that makes up
the bar will I suggest Kormendy 1979b tend to phase-mix azimuthally
into a lower-surface-brightness and more axially symmetric shelf in surface
brightness that has the same sharp outer edge that the bar had This is
precisely a description of a lens component It is part of the reason why I
suggest that as strong bars weaken the stars that escape from them grow
a lens I suggest further that we see galaxies at all phases of this evolution
some have bars and no lenses many have bars embedded in lenses of the
same major-axis size and some have lenses with no bars
The rest of this section reviews further papers on bar suicide and
observational evidence that lenses are defunct bars
Combes 2008b 2010 2011 gives brief theoretical reviews of bar-to-lens
evolution She also reviews an additional important aspect of bar dissolution
When gas loses angular momentum and ows toward the center the stellar
bar receives that angular momentum that is lost by the gas This makes
the orbits rounder and the bar weaker Papers that emphasize this eect
include Bournaud  Combes 2002 and Bournaud et al 2005

Fig 116 Death of an n-body bar as the central mass concentration is increased
adapted from Figs 1 2 and 3 of Norman et al 1996 An initial axisymmetric
disk was evolved to time 100 by which time a stable bar had developed leftmost
conguration shown in each of the three rows of particle distributions at the top
The top three rows show the time evolution as a point mass is grown at the center
Its mass shrinks from bulge size to zero size between t  100 to t  150 At the
end it makes up 0  3  and 7  of the mass of the disk top row to bottom row
In the absence of a central point mass the bar is stable top The bar is weakened
progressively more as the central mass increases The bar amplitude is shown in the
middle panel The bottom panel shows the t  200 amplitude as a function of the
nal central point pass Note that whereas higher point masses more thoroughly
destroy the bar its amplitude is non-zero even for a 7  central point mass
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
My lectures included an example from Norman et al 1996 of an n-body
simulation of the weakening of a bar by a growing central mass This is
illustrated in Fig 116 A Kuzmin  Toomre disk that contains 75  of the
mass is the only component modeled with 50000 live particles The rest
of the mass is in a rigid bulge This is modeled as the sum of two Plummer
spheres initially of the same size the aim was to let one of them shrink
in radius once the bar was well established The disk was initially given a
Toomre stability parameter of Q  1 ensuring that a bar would form This
already guarantees that the initial bar will coexist with a bulge whose BT
ratio is typical of observed galaxies Figure 116 shows that the inner part of
the disk formed a bar by time 50 if nothing further was done to the model
top row of particle distributions and no central mass amplitude line in
the middle panel the bar remained stable in amplitude to time 200
Between time 100 and time 150 about four bar tumbling periods the
lower-mass bulge Plummer sphere was shrunk by a factor of 50 in radius
Note that this turns it eectively into a point mass not a pseudobulge with
a realistic scale length No mass was added so the overall equilibrium of the
disk was essentially unaected But the amplitude of the bar decreased as
the central point mass was shrunk Even a 3  central point mass reduced the
bar amplitude substantially A 7  point mass killed it almost completely
Norman et al 1996 explored the mechanism whereby the bar is destroyed
in some detail both in the above two-dimensional simulation and in three-
dimensional simulations that give similar results In essence moving some
mass to the center shrinks the phase space e g radial range of the x1
orbits As ILR moves outward some x2 orbits appear and these do not
support the bar Some orbits become chaotic At some point time  1405
in Fig 116 the bar coherence quickly breaks down and the disk becomes
more axisymmetric Note that the bar is not destroyed completely
Norman and collaborators acknowledge that these are highly idealized
calculations intended to study just one aspect of the rich secular evolution
of barred galaxies The contraction of a rigid mass component is of course
highly articial and more to the point the pseudobulges that weaken real
bars have length scales  110 those of their associated disks they are not
point masses With Norman et al 1996 we emphasize that the model is
constructed so a relatively large bulge coexists comfortably with the bar
Figure 116 should be taken as a proof of concept of bar suicide not as a
denitive measurement of how much central mass concentration is required
to achieve it I use Norman et al 1996 and not more detailed simulations
as my example here because my purpose is primarily pedagogical and I dont
want the essential theme to get lost in the details of orbit analysis
John Kormendy
The real world is substantially more complicated in ways that make it
dicult to predict via simulations how much central mass concentration a
bar can tolerate No available simulation realistically follows the competition
between 1 the bar growth that results from allowing the disk and dark halo
to be angular momentum sinks with the disk kept cold and continually
replenished with cosmologically infalling gas and 2 the secular evolution
that builds up the central mass concentration and that thereby ghts the
growth of the bar While the pseudobulge grows both through gas infall
and star formation and e g Norman et al 1996 by the redistribution
of stars resonances such as but not limited to ILR sweep through the
central regions and continually keep a fresh supply of material responsive to
resonant interactions with the bar
So it is no surprise that some papers suggest that central mass
concentrations as small as a few percent of the disk mass are enough to
destroy bars e g Berentzen et al 1998 Sellwood  Moore 1999 Hozumi
 Hernquist 1999 2005 Bournaud et al 2002 2005 Hozumi 2012 whereas
others e g Friedli  Benz 1993 Norman et al 1996 Athanassoula et al
2005 nd that larger masses are necessary These apparent disagreements
are largely resolved by a fundamental conclusion due to Shen  Sellwood
2004
For a given central mass dense objects cause the greatest
reduction in bar amplitude while signicantly more diuse objects have a
lesser eect emphasis added The culprit in bar suicide is certainly not
the central supermassive black hole Shen  Sellwood 2004 or even a nuclear
star cluster since these typically have masses of  02  of the mass of a
classical bulge and a smaller fraction of the mass of a pseudobulge or disk
see Kormendy  Ho 2013 for a review
The results of Shen  Sellwood 2004 suggest that pseudobulges mainly
are responsible for destroying bars For a soft central mass whose size is
comparable to that of a pseudobulge Shen and Sellwood nd that a 5 
central mass decreases the bar strength to  60  of its undamaged value
whereas a 10  mass decreases the bar strength to  13 of its undamaged
value Orbital analysis reveals that the bar dies because the phase space of x1
orbits shrinks and many x1 orbits become chaotic as the bar decays In most
of these models the dark matter halo was a rigid potential and therefore
not an angular momentum sink Test runs with a live halo show that the
bar is then slightly harder to destroy Similarly the disk is dissipationless
and does not accrete cold gas from the cosmological web so it is not as good
an angular momentum sink as the disk in a real spiral galaxy Nevertheless
these results provide a realistic picture of what it takes to destroy a bar at
least as judged by a comparison with real galaxies Section 1435

1435 Bar suicide and the origin of lens components II Observations
Long before we knew of a process that could destroy bars Kormendy 1979b
1981 1982b suggested that bars weaken with time and evolve into lenses
Observations on which this suggestion was based include the following
a Lens components are very common in barred galaxies in the sample of 121
SB galaxies studied by Kormendy 1979b 54  of SB0 to SBa galaxies have
lenses The relative light contribution of the bar and lens varies widely from
barlens  1 to barlens  1 Figure 117 shows such a sequence I illustrate
many Blens structures in these lectures to emphasize how common they are
b Lens components occur but are rare in unbarred S0  Sa galaxies Examples
are shown in Figs 17 and 118 It is likely that the inner oval disks in later-
type typically Sb galaxies are lenses too If B  lens evolution occurs this
suggests that it goes nearly to completion i e bartotal light  0 rarely in
early-type galaxies and more commonly in mid-Hubble-type galaxies
c Lens components and bars in early-type galaxies have similar radial brightness
proles i e shallow surface brightness gradients interior to a sharp outer edge
The brightness proles of the lenses measured in Kormendy  Bender 2012
are well tted by Sersic 1968 functions with n  05 i e Gaussians
d When bars and lenses occur together the bar almost always lls the lens in
one dimension Kormendy 1979b Buta et al 2007 Buta 2011 2012 Fig 117
and references there Points c and d imply that to make a lens it is
sucient to azimuthally phase-mix bar orbits Points a and b hint that
such a process occurs in many barred galaxies but that bars are completely
destroyed only rarely This is consistent with Section 1434 moderate soft
mass concentrations weaken bars but do not necessarily destroy them
Fig 118 The prototypical unbarred S0 galaxy with a lens is NGC 1553 Fig 17
This gure shows two more examples NGC 2784 is from the de Vaucouleurs Atlas
and NGC 3245 rotated so north is at left is from httpwwwwikiskyorg The
lenses are the elliptical shelves in surface brightness just outside the pseudobulges
Several earlier gures show barless late-type analogs which probably also are lenses

e Figure 119 shows a compelling observation that supports B  lens evolution
The top panels show rotation velocity V and velocity dispersion  along the
major axes of the barred S0lens galaxy NGC 3945 Fig 117 and the unbarred
S0lens galaxy NGC 1553 Fig 17 The NGC 3945 bar is oriented along the
minor axis so the major-axis observations in Fig 119 really measure the lens
The bottom panel shows V  for these two galaxies plus NGC 2784 Fig 118
and two more SB0 galaxies I conclude 1 The inner part of each lens is hotter
than its corresponding pseudobulge That is  is higher and V is smaller in the
lens than in the pseudobulge 2 This behavior and the V  radial proles are
the same in barred and unbarred lenses 3 And V  in these lenses is similar
to V  along the ridge line of the strong bar in NGC 936 Kormendy 1983

John Kormendy
Thus the relative importance of ordered motions rotation and random motions
is similar in lenses and bars both observed and n-body-simulated In particular
at about 40  of the radius rlens of the lens V   08 Also  is the line-of-
sight velocity dispersion so the total velocity dispersion is likely to be at least
a factor of 2 larger This means that the ratio of rotational kinetic energy
to random kinetic energy is  13 in the inner parts of both bars and lenses
That is stellar orbits are similarly far from circular Lenses are parts of disks
Freeman 1975 and yet they are hotter than their associated pseudobulges
The close similarity of V 22 in bars and lenses cf Bosma et al 2010 means
that it is relatively easy for bars to evolve into lenses  it is enough if x1 orbits
escape the persuasion to precess together that is supplied by bar self-gravity it
is not necessary to change their energies and angular momenta drastically
f The fact that we see arbitrarily weak bars embedded in strong lenses is a powerful
argument that these bars were once stronger Kormendy 2004b NGC 3081 in
Fig 117 is the best example It contains an exceedingly faint bar but almost all
of the inner light is in the lens  which is much rounder  and the pseudobulge
Can we really imagine that one or two percent of the stars in a disk discover that
they are bar-unstable that they make a nice highly elongated bar and that most
of the disk meanwhile stays just slightly oval This is not what happens in n-body
simulations of bar formation There essentially all of the disk participates in
the instability and most disk stars that live interior to the nal radius of the bar
participate in the bar Thats why n-body bars buckle in the axial direction 
they are self-gravitating structures Lenses on the other hand appear to be at
e g Kormendy 1982b and Kormendy  Bender 2012 Thus the observation
Figs 117 and 118 that there is a complete continuity from barlens  1 to
barlens  1 to barlens  0 together with the above results strongly suggests
that bars evolve into lenses The fact that barless lenses are rare at early Hubble
types implies that any evolution is relatively slow or that it stops when a galaxy
gets transformed into an S0 The observation of barless ovals that appear to be
equivalent to lenses in galaxies such as NGC 4736 and NGC 1068 implies that
the evolution goes to completion more readily in galaxies that contain gas
All of these suggestions are comfortably consistent with  and arguably
could have been predicted from  our picture that bars drive secular
evolution that builds up the central density by forming pseudobulges that
are harmful to the survival of the bar
I do not want to argue too forcefully for this picture I especially do not
want to suggest that bar  lens evolution is the only thing that happens
But the most economical suggestion that is consistent with observations
and simulations is that bars evolve away as they increase the central
concentration of the galaxy One result is lens components that have the
same radii shallow brightness gradients and sharp outer edges as their
parent bars Some tests of this idea are suggested in Section 1437

III What pseudobulge mass is required to destroy bars
We get a preliminary idea of what P BT ratio divides SA and SB galaxies
by examining values for intermediate-Hubble-type oval galaxies that are
illustrated in this paper Two more such galaxies are shown in Fig 120
Table 11 shows the results The sample is small Also P BT ratios of
SAB galaxies vary widely perhaps because the central concentrations of
pseudobulges vary widely Nevertheless we derive a clean result as follows
Table 1 suggests that realistic pseudobulges with P BT  034  002 are
massive enough to destroy bars essentially completely and to convert them
into lenses This is a preliminary result reported here for the rst time

1437 Remaining puzzles and suggestions for further work
Our understanding of the lives and deaths of bars is now reasonably well
developed A few particularly obvious problems and suggestions about how
to address them are outlined below
a How do bars form Despite the long history of seeing violent instabilities when
n-body systems are given small Toomre Q by at  and despite convincing hints
that tidal tickling helps we understand bar formation less well than we think We
need to investigate bar growth both observationally by observing distant galaxies
and by using simulations Closely related and very important are b and c
b We need to study bar evolution via the competition between angular momentum
sinks the outer disk and dark halo which make the bar grow stronger and the
increasing importance of ILR as the bar moves material inward which makes
the bar grow weaker This is a complicated modeling job But the great richness
of possible interactions between nonaxisymmetric components is lost when the
relevant components either are not included or are turned into xed potentials I
do not criticize published papers for trying to distill clean subsets of the physics
that we want to study But there are eects that we cannot nd if component
interactions are switched o In particular it is likely that a bar can coexist with
a more massive pseudobulge if it grew in the context of the above competition
c Including gas is critically important in studying bar evolution Gas dissipation is
essential for the inward ow of the material that builds pseudobulges Whether
recycled not yet used up or accreted from outside gas helps to keep the disk cold
enough to be responsive Without it n-body disks get so hot that spiral structure
switches o and the disk gets less eective at absorbing angular momentum
Cosmological accretion of cold gas may be essential for realistic bar evolution
d On the observational front we need to measure the luminosity and mass functions
of elliptical galaxies classical bulges pseudobulges and disks as a function of
environmental density Early observations demonstrate that the answers are
dierent in clusters and in the eld Sandage et al 1985a Kormendy et al 2010
But we need more quantitative measures of the relative importance of secular
evolution and hierarchical clustering and merging as a function of environment
e The idea that bars evolve into lenses needs to be tested further Note how
many relevant observations and theoretical hypotheses date from the 1980s
This is an opportunity for todays students We need absorption-line kinematic
measurements of bars and lenses We need photometry and component
decomposition to see e g whether the barlens luminosity ratio tends to be
smaller as the pseudobulge is more massive or more centrally concentrated
Caution many decomposition codes use the assumption that each component has
a attening that is independent of radius This is certainly wrong and commonly
leads to unphysical conclusions e g about numbers of components And we
need mass models to determine halo properties There is much work to be done
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
15 Secular evolution and the growth of pseudobulges
This section reviews the processes of secular evolution in disk galaxies and
the structures that they produce I begin with bar-driven evolution but also
discuss why evolution happens in more than just barred galaxies Much
emphasis will be on the high-density central parts of galaxies that in the
past were confused with merger-built bulges As explained in Section 113
I call such components pseudobulges if  to the best of our knowledge 
they were not made by mergers but rather were grown out of the disk
The essential qualitative results of secular evolution were known more than
30 years ago at the time of my Saas-Fee lectures Kormendy 1982b From
that review Table 12 here lists the major structural components in galaxies
and what we then thought we knew about their origin All of the suggested
formation mechanisms are strongly supported by more recent work and form
the main subjects of these lectures The only change that I have made in
reproducing Table 12 is to remove a suggestion that the transition from
John Kormendy
ellipticals and bulges to thick and thin disks is continuous The only change
in emphasis that I would make in reformulating the table now would be to
emphasize major mergers as the origin of classical bulges and ellipticals and
note that dissipation and starbursts occur naturally in wet mergers
To bring this story up to date lets start by revisiting the denition of
a classical bulge The clearest statement that captures the intention of
morphologists such as Sandage and de Vaucouleurs is by Alvio Renzini
1999 A bulge is nothing more nor less than an elliptical galaxy that
happens to live in the middle of a disk There is a world of information
hidden in this beguilingly simple dention
First what is an elliptical Formally this subject is beyond the scope of
these lectures We understand that ellipticals form by major galaxy mergers
and not by secular processes Still we cannot understand pseudobulges
without knowing something about classical bulges and ellipticals Moreover
some lecturers at this school notably Isaac Shlosman and Nick Scoville
focus on our standard picture of the evolution of structure by hierarchical
clustering and galaxy mergers I try to connect this story with our picture
of secular evolution in Section 18 Some properties of elliptical galaxies and
classical bulges are compared in Section 17 Here I list the properties that
we need in the present section Classical bulges and elliptical galaxies
toward larger radii r with 2 
a have smooth nearly elliptical isophotes
b have Sersic 1968 function log Ir  r1n brightness proles that fall steeply
 4 for most bulges e g Fisher  Drory 2008
c satisfy the same fundamental plane correlations Djorgovski  Davis 1987
Faber et al 1987 Djorgovski et al 1988 Bender et al 1992 between the
eective radius re that contains half of the total light the eective surface
brightness e at re and the total absolute magnitude MV Fisher  Drory 2008
Kormendy  Bender 2012 as illustrated here in Fig 168 and
 n 
d generally rotate approximately as rapidly as oblate spheroidal stellar systems
that have isotropic velocity dispersions and that are attened mainly by rotation
e g Kormendy  Illingworth 1982
Point c is the most important because some of a b and d are shared
by other kinds of ellipsoidal stellar systems called spheroidals Section 17
I adopt the Renzini denition because it embodies the idea that I want
to emphasize namely that the denition of a component should be made in
terms of its formation physics as well as its observed properties
The problem with our denition is that it is dicult to apply especially
to galaxies that are not seen edge-on Therefore it is common to use one of
two surrogate denitions as illustrated in Fig 121 When a galaxy disk is
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Fig 121 Illustrating the surrogate denitions of a bulge M 87 is a giant elliptical
and NGC 4594 is a classical-bulge-dominated Sa galaxy seen almost edge-on These
are Hubble Heritage images The right panel shows the surface brightness prole
along the major axis of the Sb galaxy NGC 1353 we use it again in Fig 133 It
is decomposed into an outer exponential disk prole and an inner it will turn out
pseudobulge prole with a Sersic index of n  13  03
seen nearly edge-on e g NGC 4594 at center then the part of the galaxy
that is like an elliptical e g M 87 at left is the high-surface-brightness
centrally concentrated component that is thicker than the disk When the
galaxy is seen nearly face-on we cannot see such a central thickening But
we know from galaxies like NGC 4594 that the brightness prole of the
bulge is much steeper than that of the disk and extends near the center
to much higher surface brightnesses than those of the disk NGC 1353
in Fig 121 shows a clear separation between the high-surface-brightness
central pseudobulge and the outer exponential disk It also illustrates how
we decompose the surface brightness prole of a face-on galaxy into bulge
and disk parts that add up to the observed prole Bulge-disk decomposition
is discussed in Section 1741 Here I note the surrogate denition of a bulge
that is used when a galaxy is seen nearly face-on it is the central part of the
galaxy that is dened by the extra light above the inward extrapolation of
the outer exponential or Sersic disk prole That is the bulge-dominated
 10 It happens to be a pseudobulge
part of NGC 1353 is the part at r 
rather than a classical bulge but this does not aect the surrogate denition
The good news is that classifying bulges by using the surrogate denitions
is easy The bad news is that we dont know what they are physically That
is there is no guarantee that the surrogate denitions always identify central
components that originate via the same formation physics In fact I will try
to convince you in this section that the surrogate denitions often identify
high-surface-brightness central components that are nothing like ellipticals
especially in late-type galaxies
John Kormendy
Therefore I adopt a dierent approach that is more physically motivated
but also more hazardous Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 I dene classical
bulges to be elliptical galaxies that happen to live in the middle of a disk
For this to make sense physically we need to check that there exist central
components of disk galaxies that have essentially all of the properties of
comparable-luminosity elliptical galaxies This check has been made
is discussed in Sections 1744 and 181 The intention is that classical
bulges like ellipticals form via major galaxy mergers In contrast I dene a
pseudobulge as the dense central part of a galaxy  either a thick component
that bulges above and below an edge-on disk or the extra light at small
radii above the inward extrapolation of the outer disk prole  that was
constructed from the disk by mostly secular processes For this denition
to make sense we need to see convincing evidence that secular disk evolution
happens and that it makes pseudobulges that we know how to identify We
have such evidence the classication criteria are listed in Section 153
There turn out to be three generic kinds of pseudobulges Fig 122
These denitions involve dierent practical problems We always know
what we are talking about physically But it may be dicult to apply
the classication criteria I prefer this problem to the ones above that are
inherent in a descriptive classication My job in the rest of this section is
to present the case for a physically motivated denition of pseudobulges

pseudobulges is discussed here For nuclear bars see Section 1528

151 The response of gas to a rotating bar
Construction of outer rings inner rings and pseudobulges
Figure 123 shows the fundamental results of bar-driven secular evolution
The disk spreads Section 12 Gas at large radii gains angular momentum
it moves to still larger radii and is shepherded into an outer ring near OLR
This is identied with the outer rings in RSB galaxies Fig 124 Gas at
small radii gives up some of its angular momentum and falls to the center
High-density gas likes to make stars we see starbursts in Figs 129  131
We identify the result as a pseudobulge In between gas is focused into a ring
around the end of the bar the inner ring seen in SBr galaxies Fig 124

Figure 124 shows the close correspondence between the features produced
in the Simkin et al 1980 simulation and the morphology of barred galaxies
More sophisticated hydrodynamic calculations clarify the physics Fig 126
but it is remarkable that just letting gas particles stick together when they
collide is enough to reach the most basic conclusions

produced in the sticky particle simulation of Simkin et al 1980 NGC 3945 is

NGC 3081 have both an outer ring and an inner ring r such galaxies are rare
NGC 2217 contains a lens component that is lled by the bar in one dimension

similar morphology are shown in Figs 13 16 18 19 117 136 137 and 145
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Figure 125 explores the dierence between SBr and SBs galaxies
Sanders  Tubbs 1980 investigated how the response of gas to a bar varies
with bar pattern speed and strength Fast bars have small corotation radii
e g rcordisk scale length  07 in the bottom-left model panel They
drive SBs structure like that in NGC 1300 Slower bars end near corotation
rcora  11 and drive SBr structure like that in NGC 2523 Since bars
slow down as they evolve Fig 113 and since it takes time to collect gas
into an inner ring we conclude that SBs galaxies are dynamically young
and that SBr galaxies are dynamically mature
Fig 125 Contours of steady-state gas density in response to a bar adapted from
Sanders  Tubbs 1980 who also show intermediate cases The bar is horizontal
and has a length equal to four axis tick marks The top row explores the eect of
varying the ratio MBMD of bar mass to disk mass The second row varies the bar
axial ratio ba The third row varies the bar pattern speed parametrized by the
ratio rcora of the corotation radius to the disk scale length The middle column
is the same standard model in each row it resembles the SBr galaxy NGC 2523
The left panels resemble the SBs galaxy NGC 1300 The right panels take the
parameters to unrealistic extremes they do not resemble real galaxies
John Kormendy
Consistent with this conclusion is the observation Sandage 1975 that
dust lanes on the rotationally leading sides of bars are common in SBs
galaxies but rare in SBr galaxies cf Figs 16 124 125 The gas between
the inner ring and the pseudobulge has largely been depleted in SBr
galaxies see Kormendy  Barentine 2010 Fig 146 here and Barentine
 Kormendy 2012 for examples
Sanders  Tubbs 1980 also investigated the eects of varying the
strength of the imposed bar potential measured both by the ratio of bar
mass to disk mass MBMD top row of simulation results in Fig 125 and
by the axial ratio ba of the bar middle row of simulation results Very
weak bars MBMD  013 or bars that are not very elongated ba  12
more like an oval disk than like a bar produced weak SBs structure
that does not resemble well developed SBs galaxies such as NGC 1300
Parameters that are more realistic in matching strongly barred galaxies
MBMD  053 ba  14 and rcora  11 i e the standard model
shown in the middle column of model results provided the best match to
an SBr galaxy This model shows a linear maximum in gas density that
is parallel to the bar and oset from it in the forward rotation direction
like the straight dust lanes in SBs galaxies But the bar potential and gas
content are imposed by the initial conditions they are not self-consistently
evolved from more axisymmetric initial conditions This accounts for the
rarely observed coexistence of the oset gas density maximum in the bar
and the r structure Finally note that when the bar is much stronger than
bars in real galaxies MBMD  27 or much slower than in real galaxies
rcora  3 the gas response fails to resemble that in observed galaxies
Better simulations generally conrm and expand on the above conclusions
e g Salo et al 1999 Rautiainen  Salo 2000 Rautiainen et al 2005
Treuthardt et al 2009 see Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 for further review
In particular detailed hydrodynamic models of the gas response in the region
of the bar conrm the oset density maximum seen in the Sanders  Tubbs
1980 model and greatly clarify the nature of bar-driven secular evolution
The most illuminating simulations are by Athanassoula 1992 shown
here in Fig 126 She explored the response of inviscid gas to an imposed
bar concentrating on the production of gas shocks and their relation to dust
lanes If the mass distribution is suciently centrally concentrated to result
in an ILR then she found that straight gas shocks  which we identify with
dust lanes  are produced that are oset in the forward rotation direction
from the ridge line of the bar The x2 orbits that align perpendicular to
the bar inside ILR push the oset to be largest near the center This is seen
in Fig 126 and Fig 127 as well as in Fig 15 and Fig 16
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Fig 126 Comparison of the gas response to a bar Athanassoula 1992 model 1
with NGC 1365 The galaxy image is from the VLT and is reproduced courtesy of
ESO In the models the bar potential is oriented at 45 to the vertical parallel to
the lowest-density dark part of the gas density grayscale distribution at upper-left
The bar axial ratio is 04 and its length is approximately half of the box diagonal
The top-right panel shows the velocity eld arrow lengths are proportional to ow
velocities Discontinuities in gas velocity indicate shocks at the narrow ridge lines of
high gas density in the upper-left panel High gas densities are identied with dust
lanes in real galaxies The model correctly reproduces the observations that dust
lanes are oset in the forward rotation direction from the ridge line of the bar that
they are oset by larger amounts nearer the center and that very near the center
they curve and become nearly azimuthal The bottom-right panel shows the H i
velocity eld of NGC 1365 from Lindblad et al 1996 The contour interval is 20
km s1 The velocity contours crowd strongly in the dust lanes shown at lower-left
the scales of the two panels are slightly dierent This supports the interpretation
that the dust lanes are signatures of shocks in the gas velocity eld Shocks are
signs that the gas loses energy It must fall toward the center In fact NGC 1365
has high gas densities and active star formation in its bright center Lindblad 1999
Curran et al 2001a b Adapted from Fig 7 of Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004
John Kormendy
The consequence of shocks is that they inevitably imply that gas ows
toward the center Because the shocks are nearly radial gas impacts them
at a steep angle Therefore the velocity that is lost in the shock is mainly
rotational This robs the gas of energy and forces it to fall toward the center
Important conrmation of these results is provided by the observation that
H i gas velocity contours crowd closely just where we observe dust lanes in
optical images e g NGC 1365 in Fig 126 and NGC 1530 in Fig 127
The H i observations do not have high enough spatial resolution to prove
that a shock must be present but the rapid change in the velocity eld
coincident with the dust lane strongly supports the above evolution picture
It is easy to get a heuristic understanding of the gas velocity eld shown
in Fig 126 Gravitational torques produced by the bar accelerate the gas as
it approaches the bar As a result it climbs to larger radii as it crosses the
ridge line of the bar Then as it leaves the bar the bar potential minimum
is behind the gas and decelerates it Incoming gas overshoots a little before
it plows into the departing gas so the shocks are nearly radial but oset
from the ridge line of the bar in the rotationally forward direction
Fig 127 NGC 1530 is another excellent example of the crowding of H i velocity
contours at the position of the dust lane in an SBb galaxy The image is from

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Do observations show central concentrations of gas in barred galaxies and
in other galaxies e g oval disks in which the above secular evolution is
expected to happen And do they not show such central gas concentrations
in the absence of engines for secular evolution Figure 128 provides six
examples of the general result that the answer is yes
Fig 128 Radial proles of CO gas and stellar K-band surface brightness from
the BIMA SONG Fig 20 from Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 adapted from Regan
et al 2001 CO surface brightness is in magnitudes of Jy km s1 arcsec2 with
zeropoint at 1000 Jy km s1 arcsec2 The stellar surface brightness proles have
been shifted vertically to the CO proles Morphological types are from the RC3

2004 NGC 4736 is a prototypical pseudobulge also illustrated in Figs 13 16 and
18 All galaxies in this gure except NGC 7331 have structures that are expected
to cause gas to ow toward the center NGC 7331 is included to show the very
dierent CO prole in a galaxy with a probable classical bulge cf Fig 129

What happens to the infalling gas Concentrated into a small volume it
gets very dense Crunching gas likes to make stars The Schmidt 1959 
Kennicutt 1989 1998a 1998b law that star formation rates increase
faster than linearly with gas density makes this explicit Fig 132 here
Conrming our expectations observations point to enhanced star formation
often in spectacular starbursts near the centers of barred and oval galaxies
In particular Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared observations in the 24 m
bandpass are sensitive to warm dust that reradiates light from hot young
stars Fig 129 Survey results by Fisher 2006 and Fisher et al 2009
show ubiquitous central star formation in medium- and late-type barred and
oval galaxies but not in galaxies with classical bulges Fig 129

spectrum top right from Kennicutt 2003 shows the separate roughly black body
spectra of stellar populations in galaxies stars and of warm dust dust The
Spitzer Space Telescope MIPS 24 m bandpass is sensitive to dust that reradiates
light from young stars Thus SFRs are high where galaxies are bright at 24 m

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
More detailed views of this star formation are shown in Figs 130 and 131
Figure 130 shows NGC 5236 a particularly close and well known example
The dust lanes on the rotationally trailing sides of the spiral arms are
believed to have the same cause as the ones on the leading sides of the bar
they trace shocks where the gas enters the spiral arms Star formation is
triggered there by gas compression Since   p the gas moves forward
beyond the shock during the time that it takes stars to form As a result
the ridge line of bright young stars and H ii regions that are strung out like
pearls along the arms Baade 1963 is oset forward of the dust lanes Our
picture of how spiral density waves stimulate star formation and hence are
traced by young stars is discussed in Roberts 1969 Dixon 1971 Shu et
al 1973 and Roberts et al 1975 and is reviewed in Toomre 1977b
Returning to bar-driven inward gas transport and its consequences the
central regions of NGC 5236 are dominated by intense star formation Harris
et al 2001 Knapen et al 2010 Similarly the whole of the central region of
NGC 1365 Fig 126 is undergoing a starburst Kristen et al 1997 Galliano
et al 2008 Elmegreen et al 2009 A less intense but still prototypical
example is NGC 1300 Fig 16 Knapen et al 2006 Comeron et al 2010
Spiral galaxies in which there is no signicant ILR and in which the spiral
structure extends to the center can also have central starbursts for example

Nuclear starburst rings are particularly compelling examples of the star
formation that  we suggest  results from inward transport of disk gas
Figure 131 shows examples Three of these galaxies are barred but
NGC 4736 is in my prototypical unbarred oval galaxy Figs 13 16 18
It emphasizes again that numerical simulations and observations both imply
that oval galaxies evolve secularly in the same way that barred galaxies do

nonoverlapping images in the bandpasses indicated by the colors used in these RGB
renditions All colors are available in only two places around the ring but they make
it clear that this star-forming ring in a prototypical oval galaxy see Figs 13 16
and 18 is closely similar to the other nuclear rings which occur in barred galaxies
Note that these nuclear rings are distinct from and always smaller than the inner
rings that encircle bars see point f in Section 131
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
The star formation discussed in this section is not associated with galaxy
mergers and instead is closely connected with probable engines for secular
evolution and with observed features such as radial dust lanes in bars which
suggest that such evolution is in progress We conclude with some condence
that it is building pseudobulges Are the gas supplies and star formation
rates SFRs consistent with reasonable growth times for pseudobulges of
the observed masses
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 address this for nuclear star-forming rings
Fig 132 The rings have larger SFR densities SFR and total gas densities
gas than do spiral galaxies in general dening a Schmidt-Kennicutt relation
similar to the well known SFR  14

gure is taken the other data are from Kennicutt 1998b Diagonal lines show
gas consumption timescales if no additional gas is supplied to the central region
John Kormendy
currently available gas would be consumed in  02  2 Gyr However I have
argued that the central gas is continually replenished Thus the observed
SFRs of 01  10 M yr1 are consistent with the formation of pseudobulges
with masses  108  1010 M over several Gyr These values are reasonable
Fisher et al 2009 and Fisher  Drory 2010 use the Spitzer Space
Telescope to study SFRs and star formation histories in classical and pseudo
bulges in detail They conclude 2009 that All bulges are found to be
forming stars irrespective of bulge type pseudobulge or classical bulge
However classical bulges have the lowest specic SFR SFR per unit stellar
mass implying growth times that are longer than a Hubble time thus the
present-day SFR does not likely play a major role in the evolution of classical
In contrast at present-day SFRs the median pseudobulge could
bulges
have grown the present-day stellar mass in 8 Gyr
In almost all galaxies
in our sample the specic SFR of the bulge is higher than that of the
outer disk This suggests that almost all galaxies are increasing their BT
through internal star formation The SFRs in pseudobulges correlate with
their structure More massive pseudobulges have higher SFR density this
is consistent with the stellar mass being formed by moderate extended star
formation Bulges in late-type galaxies have similar SFRs as pseudobulges in
intermediate-type galaxies and are similar in radial size However they have
lower masses thus they have much shorter growth times  2 Gyr Our
results are consistent with a scenario in which bulge growth via internal star
formation is a natural and near ubiquitous phenomenon in disk galaxies
I want to emphasize the contrast between star formation in major mergers
and star formation during secular evolution Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004
Merger starbursts last 
 a few hundred million years Most classical bulges
and ellipticals are seen long after the assembly events that constructed them
Therefore they are mostly seen to contain old stars In contrast secular
evolution is inherently long-term Except in S0 pseudobulges we usually see
star formation in action If star formation is ubiquitous it must be secular
As a result ongoing star formation that is not observed to be associated
with morphological indicators of a merger in progress such as tidal tails is
the rst pseudobulge classication criterion listed in Section 153
We have a detailed picture of internal secular evolution in galaxy disks
Central molecular gas concentrations and starbursts are closely associated
with bars and oval disks that act as evolution engines They are not generally
found in classical bulges They are also closely associated with dust lanes and
H I velocity crowding in bars that are signatures of secular evolution These
correlations argue in favor of internal secular evolution and against the idea
that these features could be produced by large numbers of minor mergers

152 The observed properties of pseudobulges
Quoting Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 How can we tell whether a
pseudobulge is like an elliptical or whether it formed secularly The answer
and the theme of this section is that pseudobulges retain enough memory
of their disky origin so that the best examples are easily recognizable As
we move from proof of concept into work on large samples of galaxies we
will have to face the diculty that classication gets dicult when  as we
must expect  both a classical bulge and a subsequently grown pseudobulge
are present
In such cases bulge-pseudobulge decomposition is necessary
e g Erwin et al 2003 In this section I discuss the properties of more
prototypical pure pseudobulges to show how they dier from classical bulges
and ellipticals Section 153 then lists the classication criteria numbered
according to the subsections in the following discussion
1521 Pseudobulges of spiral galaxies show ongoing star formation
As noted in the previous section ongoing central star formation in relatively
normal spiral galaxies that show no signs of a merger in progress is a strong
pseudobulge indicator The work by Fisher et al 2009 2010 shows that
such star formation is generally present in morphologically classied pseudo
but not classical bulges If star formation is ubiquitous it must be secular
1522 Pseudobulges are atter than classical bulges
This is a two-part criterion First when the galaxy is highly inclined and the
ellipticity prole r tells us the relative attening of various components
pseudobulges are often not always seen to be atter than classical bulges
Commonly a part of them is as at as the associated outer disks Second
pseudobulges in spiral but not S0 galaxies usually show spiral structure
all the way to the center of the galaxy Classical bulges like ellipticals are
essentially never atter than   06  They cannot show spiral structure
This classication criterion can be applied even to face-on galaxies
The connection between pseudobulge atness and secular evolution has
been made since the earliest papers on this subject Kormendy 1993b
describes the prototypical pseudobulge in NGC 4736 like this The central
brightness prole is an r14 law that reaches the high central brightness
characteristic of a bulge Boroson 1981 However the r14-law component
shows a nuclear bar and spiral structure to within a few arcsec of the center
Bars are disk phenomena More importantly it is not possible to make
spiral structure in a bulge Thus the morphology already shows that the
r14-law prole belongs to a disk This is shown more quantitatively by
rapid rotation which is discussed here in Section 1523
John Kormendy
The importance of spiral structure is further emphasized by Courteau
et al 1996 Many of these late-type galaxies in their sample show
spiral structure continuing into the central regions
   We invoke secular
dynamical evolution and gas inow via angular momentum transfer and
viscous transport as the interpretation of the disky central structure
Spectacular examples of disky pseudobulges often with spiral structure
emerge from HST imaging surveys The best known of these is by Carollo
and collaborators Carollo et al 1997 1998 Carollo  Stiavelli 1998 Carollo
1999 Carollo et al 1999 2002 Seigar et al 2002 They refer to bulges
that are structurally unlike ellipticals as irregular bulges and note that
The widespread presence of star formation in the irregular bulges support
scenarios in which a fraction of bulges form relatively late in dissipative
accretion events driven by the disk Figures 133 and 134 show examples

structure that can only be sustained in a disk 3 because patchiness indicates the
presence of dust and star formation and 4 because its Sersic index n  13  03
is less than 2 From Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 which shows more examples
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Figure 134 shows HST images of the central parts of Sa  Sbc galaxies
All show at shapes spiral structure of patchy star formation These are
the central regions that by the surrogate denitions would be identied as
the galaxies bulges It seems safe to conclude that no one who saw these
images would dene bulges as mini-ellipticals that live at the centers of disks

1523 Pseudobulges are more rotation-dominated than classical bulges
Pseudobulges were rst recognized because rotation is more important with
respect to random motions than it is in classical bulges Via the Vmax  
diagram Fig 135 for galaxies such as NGC 3945 and NGC 4736 Kormendy
1982a b concluded that some SB bulges are more disklike than SA bulges
and a signicant fraction of the bulge in many SB galaxies may consist
of disk gas which has been transported to the center by the bar As the gas
accumulates it forms stars and builds up a centrally concentrated stellar dis-
tribution which is photometrically like a bulge but dynamically like a disk
Again the fundamental ideas about secular evolution have been with us for
a long time These results are brought up to date with more recent long-slit
spectroscopy in Fig 135 The result is that Vmax is larger at a given  in
pseudobulges most lled symbols than in classical bulges open symbols
or in ellipticals crosses
Fig 135 Relative importance of rotation and random velocity as a function of
ellipticity   1  axial ratio for various kinds of stellar systems Here Vmax is
the ratio of the maximum rotation velocity to the mean velocity dispersion interior
to re The Oblate line describes oblate-spheroidal systems that have isotropic
velocity dispersions and that are attened by rotation it is a consequence of the
tensor virial theorem Binney  Tremaine 1987 From Kormendy  Fisher 2008
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
The disky dynamics of pseudobulges are beautifully illustrated by the
SAURON teams integral-eld spectroscopy This result is particularly
important so Figs 136 and 137 show three examples in detail In Fig 136
the surface brightness prole tells us the part of NGC 4274 that the surrogate
 10 The two-
denitions would identify as the bulge It dominates at r 
dimensional kinematic and line-strength maps then show that compared
 10
to the rest of the inner parts of the galaxy the component at r 
rotates more rapidly has a lower velocity dispersion and has stronger H 
absorption lines The latter result means that the central disky structure is
made of younger stars than the rest of the galaxy As Falcon-Barroso et al
2006 and Peletier et al 2007a b 2008 note all this is very consistent
with our picture of bar-driven secular evolution
Figure 137 shows closely similar results for the SB galaxies NGC 3623 and
NGC 5689
It is remarkable how clearly the central component is a
rapidly rotating cold disk in all three galaxies The younger ages of the
pseudobulges also supports our evolution picture Note again that all three
galaxies are barred
Fig 136 SAURON integral-eld spectroscopy of the disky pseudobulge of the Sa
galaxy NGC 4274 The galaxy is barred but the bar is foreshortened because it
is oriented nearly along the minor axis It lls an inner ring as is normal in SBr
galaxies Kormendy 1979b The brightness prole upper-right is decomposed into
a Sersic 1968 function plus an exponential disk The Sersic function has n  13
i e n  2 as in other pseudobulges Section 1526 The pseudobulge dominates
 10 The kinematic maps Falcon-Barroso et al 2006 show
the light at radii r 
that this light comes from a disky component that is more rapidly rotating center
lower in velocity dispersion right and stronger in H line strength left from

Fig 137 SAURON integral-eld spectroscopy of the disky pseudobulges of the
SB0 galaxy NGC 5689 and the SABa galaxy NGC 3623 adapted from Falcon-
Barroso et al 2006 Again both bars are oriented nearly along the minor axis As
in NGC 4274 the bar in NGC 3623 lls an inner ring Also as in NGC 4274 the
kinematic maps show that both galaxies contain pseudobulges that are prominently
disky and more rapidly rotating center lower in velocity dispersion right and
stronger in H line strength left and hence younger than the rest of the inner
galaxy It is important to emphasize that pseudobulges generally show more than
one here three of the classication criteria listed in Section 153
1524 Pseudobulges have small velocity dispersions for their luminosities
Pseudobulges have smaller  than do classical bulges of the same MB e g
Kormendy  Illingworth 1983 Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 Gadotti 
Kaumann 2009 cf Falcon-Barroso et al 2006 Peletier et al 2007a This
could partly be due to low MLB ratios resulting from young stars
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
1525 Almost all pseudobulges have bulge-to-total ratios P BT 
 13
Bulges with BT 
 12 are classical
Fisher  Drory 2008 study the properties of pseudobulges in 79 S0  Sc
galaxies to clarify our classication criteria They show that in general
dierent classication criteria agree in distinguishing pseudobulges from
classical bulges To do this work they need rst to classify bulges using
purely morphological criteria Fig 138 This has the disadvantage that
morphology alone cannot always identify pseudobulges in S0 galaxies But
it lets them study a large sample and it allows a fair test of for example
the already strong hint see Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 that the Sersic
indices of pseudobulges are smaller than those of classical bulges
Fig 138 Morphological features used by Fisher  Drory 2008 2010 to classify
bulges as classical or pseudo Classical bulges have smooth nearly featureless and
nearly elliptical isophotes as do elliptical galaxies NGC 3998 NGC 3031  M 81
Pseudobulges show one or more of the following nuclear bars spiral structure or
patchy star formation bottom four galaxies From Fisher  Drory 2010
John Kormendy
Fisher  Drory 2008 measure surface brightness proles of their galaxies
using Hubble Space Telescope HST  archival images their own large-eld
images from the McDonald Observatory 09 m telescope and images from
archives such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS Combining data from
many sources provides accurate proles over wide dynamic ranges They
decompose the brightness proles into disk components with exponential
proles and pseudobulge components with Sersic 1968 function proles
Figure 139 is an example
This work further conrms the pseudobulge properties discussed in
previous sections and provides several new results
About half of early-type galaxies contain pseudobulges almost all Sbc
galaxies contain pseudobulges and as far as we know no Sc or later-type
galaxy has a classical bulge see Fig 140 This is in excellent agreement
with results discussed in Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004
Pseudobulges are often as at as their associated disks classical bulges
are thicker than their associated disks NGC 3031  M 81 and NGC 3169 in
Fig 139 are examples

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Fig 140 Logarithm of pseudobulge-to-total luminosity ratio BT versus Hubble
type Bulges are classied as in Fig 138 Black squares show how the average
BT for pseudobulges and classical bulges together correlates with Hubble type as
expected from its use as a Hubble classication criterion Sandage 1961 Note
some pseudobulges have log BT 16 From Fisher  Drory 2008
Pseudobulge-to-total luminosity ratios are almost always P BT 
 035
Fig 140 consistent with the expectation that one cannot secularly convert
almost all of a disk into a bulge Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 Small bulge-
to-total luminosity ratios BT do not guarantee that a bulge is pseudo but
large BT 
 05 guarantee that it is classical
1526 Most pseudobulges have Sersic n  2 Classical bulges have n  2
Figures 133 and 136 show that the pseudobulges in NGC 1353 and NGC
4274 have Sersic indices n  13  03 i e almost-exponential brightness
proles The pseudobulge in NGC 3169 Fig 139 has n  145  024
which is still close to exponential In contrast the classical bulge of M 81
has n  379  039 This dierence turns out to be a general result
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 review the history of this result The idea
that bulges in late-type galaxies have nearly exponential not r14-law
brightness proles dates back to work by Andredakis  Sanders 1994 and
Andredakis et al 1995 At rst no connection was made to pseudobulges
the result was just that n is smaller in bulges of later-Hubble-type galaxies
John Kormendy
Then Courteau et al 1996 carried out bulge-disk decompositions for
 300 galaxies and concluded that  23 of them  especially at late Hubble
types  are best tted by double exponentials one for the bulge and one for
the disk As a diagnostic of formation processes Courteau et al 1996 went
on to examine the ratio hbhd of the scale lengths of the inner and outer
exponentials They found that hbhd  008005 and concluded that Our
measurements of exponential stellar density proles in bulges as well as a
restricted range of bulge-to-disk scale lengths provide strong observational
support for secular evolution models Self-consistent numerical simulations
of disk galaxies evolve toward a double exponential prole with a typical
ratio between bulge and disk scale lengths near 01 D Friedli 1995 private
communication in excellent agreement with our measured values
Fisher  Drory 2008 nd closely similar results The eective radii re of
pseudobulges and the scale lengths hd of their associated disks are coupled
whereas the same is not true for classical bulges Specically the mean ratio
is rehd  021  010 for 53 pseudobulges but rehd  045  028
for 26 classical bulges Since re  1678 hb for an exponential the above
result for pseudobulges corresponds approximately to hbhd  013006
the conversion is approximate because the pseudobulges are not exactly
exponentials This conrms the results by Courteau et al 1996 and
similar results by MacArthur et al 2003 Courteau and MacArthur did
not calculate hbhd separately for classical and pseudo bulges and therefore
found a correlation with Hubble type rather than dierent distributions of
hbhd for the two types of bulges But Courteau and MacArthur like Fisher
and Drory interpreted the connection between bulge and disk properties
as a sign that secular evolution and pseudobulge formation become more
important at later Hubble types
As a result of this and other work see especially Weinzirl et al 2009
the connection between pseudobulges and small Sersic indices is by now
well established Classical bulges on the other hand have Sersic indices
like those of elliptical galaxies which have n 
 2 e g Kormendy et al
2009 hereafter KFCB Moreover the Sersic indices n  2 to 3 of ellipticals
are well understood as natural results of their formation by major galaxy
mergers e g Hopkins et al 2009a c see Kormendy et al 2009 for a
review So the connection between the n 
 2 Sersic indices of classical
bulges with their formation by major mergers is also well established
Therefore even though we do not fully understand how disk secular
evolution determines the resulting pseudobulge Sersic indices we see strong
enough correlations between n and other pseudobulge properties so that we
can use the Seersic index as a classication criterion Figs 141 142
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies

right plots are from Fisher  Drory 2010 In all panels the central components
are classied morphologically as in Fig 138
Therefore classical bulges have Sersic n  2 whereas pseudobulges usually
have n  2 Note in Fig 141 and in the earlier discussion of NGC 4736
that some pseudobulges do have Sersic indices as big as n  4 Therefore it
is always important to apply as many classication criteria as possible
1527 Fundamental plane parameter correlations
Figure 141 provides an introduction to the correlations between eective
radius re eective brightness e at re velocity dispersion  and bulge
absolute magnitude MV the fundamental plane Classical bulges satisfy
the fundamental plane correlations of elliptical galaxies Some pseudobulges
do so too But many have larger re and fainter e than do classical bulges
John Kormendy
Figure 168 updates the observation that classical bulges and ellipticals
have the same correlations Simulations of major galaxy mergers reproduce
these correlations e g Robertson et al 2006 Hopkins et al 2008 2009b
Earlier versions that emphasize pseudobulges are shown in Figs 142 and
143 Many pseudobulges satisfy the correlations for bulges and ellipticals
but in general they show substantially larger scatter

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Figure 143 shows the e  re correlation from Carollo 1999 I emphasize
this version because it shows more extreme pseudobulges together with
spheroidal galaxies galactic nuclear star clusters and globular clusters
Spheroidals form a sequence perpendicular to the correlation for ellipticals
Figs 142 161 Globular clusters are dierent from both ellipticals and
spheroidals Kormendy 1985 1987 The comparison that is important here
is the one between bulges plus ellipticals pseudobulges and galactic nuclei
Figures 142 and 143 show that some pseudobulges satisfy the parameter
correlations for classical bulges and ellipticals but many deviate by having
brighter e Kormendy  Bender 2012 or fainter e see also Falcon-Barroso
et al 2002 Kormendy  Fisher 2008 Gadotti 2009 All available data
suggest that pseudobulges fade out by becoming low in surface brightness
not by becoming like nuclear star clusters Nuclear star clusters are not
faint versions of pseudobulges Indeed tiny pseudobulges and normal nuclei
coexist in Scd galaxies like M 101 and NGC 6946 Kormendy et al 2010
The fundamental plane is only secondarily useful for bulge classication
Many pseudobulges satisfy the correlations for classical bulges so use of
the correlations as the only classication method Gadotti 2009 Gadotti 
Kaumann 2009 is not feasible Extreme pseudobulges can be identied
because their parameters deviate from the E correlations in Fig 142 but
these objects can usually be robustly classied using other criteria anyway

1528 Nuclear bars
Figure 144 shows examples of nuclear bars at the centers of barred and oval
galaxies Nuclear bars are well known phenomena de Vaucouleurs 1959
Sandage 1961 Kormendy 1981 1982b Buta et al 2007 Buta 2011 2012
They are always much smaller than the main bars in which they are
embedded Observations are consistent with the suggestion that their physics
is essentially the same as that of main bars How they form is not known
in detail but it is reasonable to expect that the growth of stellar disky
pseudobulges out of inowing cold gas can result in a bar instability
Pattern speeds p of nuclear bars are well predicted by Section 142 They
live at small radii where stellar densities are high and where  2 is large
So p    2 should be larger for nuclear bars than it is for main bars
This is seen in n-body models Debattista  Shen 2007 Shen  Debattista
2009 Direct measurement of p is dicult but Corsini et al 2009 use the
Tremaine  Weinberg 1984 method on NGC 2950 and conclude that the
main and nuclear bars have dierent pattern speeds For present purposes
dierent p is suciently well established by the observation that nuclear
bars have random orientations with respect to their main bars Fig 144
Bars are disk phenomena A nuclear bar therefore identies a pseudobulge
Fig 144 Bars within bars The main bar is rotated until it is horizontal Contour
levels are close together in intensity at large radii and widely spaced in intensity

1529 Boxy pseudobulges are edge-on bars
Section 1433 reviews how bars buckle and thicken in the vertical direction
and consequently look like box-shaped bulges when seen edge-on These
are parts of disks so I call them boxy pseudobulges The one in our
Galaxy is particularly clearcut because we are close enough to it so that
from our perspective the near side looks taller than the far side Fig 145

within our Galaxy at the position of the Sun bottom model panel the near side
of the bar is signicantly closer than the far side Therefore the near side looks
taller than the far side exactly as in the COBE image Blitz  Spergel 1991
John Kormendy
Observations which further show that boxy bulges are edge-on bars are
reviewed in Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 The well known example of
NGC 4565 Fig 146 from Kormendy  Barentine 2010 turns out to be an
SBr galaxy with a second tiny pseudobulge at its center that is distinct
from the boxy bar Fig 147
Fig 146 a Optical and b c Spitzer 36 m negative images of NGC 4565 shown
at dierent stretches to emphasize b the boxy bar and c an inner ring and
pseudobulge The newly detected pseudobulge is the central bright dot d Spitzer
IRAC 8 m negative image showing PAH emission and therefore star formation
from the inner ring and outer disk Because the inner ring is dark inside at 8 m
we conclude that the dark inside seen at 36 m is not caused by dust absorption
Rather the ring really is dark inside Therefore NGC 4565 is an SBrb galaxy
i e an almost-edge-on analog of NGC 2523 bottom panel The NGC 2523 image
has been scaled so the inner ring has the same apparent radius as in NGC 4565
and rotated to the apparent bar position angle inferred for NGC 4565 We suggest
that NGC 2523 if oriented as in the bottom panel and inclined still more until we
observed it almost edge-on would show the features seen in the NGC 4565 images
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Finding the tiny pseudobulge hidden inside the boxy bar of NGC 4565
solves a long-standing puzzle and cements an important implication for the
statistics of P BT luminosity ratios Compare NGC 4565 with any more
face-on barred galaxy such as NGC 2523 in Fig 146 Face-on galaxies show
a pseudobulge a bar and an outer disk i e three or more components
The edge-on galaxy NGC 4565 shows only a boxy bulge and a disk As
long as we thought that boxy distortions were minor features of bulges this
was no problem  many unbarred Sb galaxies have just a bulge and a disk
But if the box in NGC 4565 is an edge-on bar then the galaxy contains a bar
and a disk i e only two components This is not seen in face-on galaxies
except at very late Hubble types Where is the bulge in NGC 4565
Figures 146 and 147 show the answer The minor-axis prole of the boxy
structure is exponential Inside this structure there is a clearly distinct tiny
central component that has n  133  012 and that therefore is a second
disky pseudobulge The important implication is that P BT  006001
is much smaller than the value BT  04 Simien  de Vaucouleurs
1986 for the box Closely similar results are found for the edge-on boxy
bulge galaxy NGC 5746 Barentine  Kormendy 2012 Not counting boxy
bulges because they are bars P BT ratios are much smaller than we have
thought for essentially all edge-on galaxies with boxy bulges In particular
the classical-bulge-to-total ratio in our Galaxy is  0 Shen et al 2010

153 Pseudobulges classication criteria
The bulge-pseudobulge classication criteria updated from Kormendy 
Kennicutt 2004 are listed here for convenience They are identied by
the number m in the Section 152m in which they were discussed
1 If the center of the galaxy is dominated by Population I material young stars
gas and dust but there is no sign of a merger in progress then the bulge is at
least mostly pseudo
2 Pseudobulges often have disky morphology e g their apparent attening is
similar to that of the outer disk or they contain spiral structure all the way in
to the center of the galaxy Classical bulges are much rounder than their disks
unless the galaxy is almost face-on and they cannot have spiral structure
3 Pseudobulges are more rotation-dominated than classical bulges in the Vmax  
diagram
Integral-eld spectroscopy often shows that the central surface
brightness excess over the inward extrapolation of the outer disk prole is a at
central component that rotates rapidly and that has a small velocity dispersion
4 Many pseudobulges are low- outliers in the Faber-Jackson 1976 correlation
between pseudobulge luminosity and velocity dispersion A similar signature is
that  decreases from the disk into the pseudobulge
almost all pseudobulges have P BT 
5 Small bulge-to-total luminosity ratios do not guarantee that a bulge is pseudo but
 05 the bulge is classical
6 Most pseudobulges have Sersic index n  2 whereas almost all classical bulges
have n  2 The processes that determine the small Sersic indices of pseudobulges
are not understood but the correlation of small n with other pseudobulge
indicators is so good that this has become a convenient classication criterion
Note however that some pseudobulges do have Sersic indices as big as 4
 035 If BT 
7 Classical bulges t the fundamental plane correlations for elliptical galaxies
Some pseudobulges do too and then these correlations are not helpful for
classication But more extreme pseudobulges are uer than classical bulges
they have larger re and fainter surface brightnesses e at re These can easily be
identied using fundamental plane correlations
8 In face-on galaxies the presence of a nuclear bar shows that a pseudobulge
dominates the central light Bars are disk phenomena Triaxiality in giant
ellipticals involves completely dierent physics  slow not rapid rotation and
box not x1 tube orbits
9 In edge-on galaxies boxy bulges are edge-on bars seeing one is sucient to
identify a pseudobulge The boxy-nonrotating-core side of the E  E dichotomy
of elliptical galaxies into two kinds Kormendy et al 2009 cannot be confused
with boxy edge-on bars because boxy ellipticals  even if they occur in disk
galaxies and we do not know of an example  are so luminous that we would
measure BT  05 Then point 5 would tell us that this bulge is classical
It is important always to apply as many classication criteria as possible
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
154 Secular evolution and hierarchical clustering
We now have a well articulated paradigm of secular evolution in galaxy disks
that complements our standard picture of hierarchical clustering There is
no competition between these two galaxy formation pictures  both are
valid and their relative importance depends on cosmological lookback time
and on environment I have emphasized that the Universe is in transition
from early times when the rapid processes of hierarchical clustering were
most important in controlling galaxy evolution to future times when galaxy
merging will largely have nished and slow internal processes will dominate
In the present Universe the mass in bulges including ellipticals and that
in disks are roughtly equal Schechter  Dressler 1987 Driver et al 2007
Gadotti 2009 Tasca  White 2011 Uncertainties are large with estimated
ratios of the mass in bulges to that in disks as large as  2 Fukugita et al
1998 One reason is that the relative numbers of disks and merger remnants
is a strong function of environment disks predominate in the eld whereas
most giant ellipticals live in galaxy clusters Section 161
The ratio of mass in classical bulges to that in pseudobulges has not yet
been determined for large and unbiased galaxy samples It is reasonable to
expect that the ratio of masses is not large
In contrast the ratio of numbers of pseudobulges to numbers of classical
 1 Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 estimated that
bulges could easily be 
most Sa galaxies contain classical bulges that in Sb galaxies classical and
pseudo bulges are comparably common and that most Sbc galaxies contain
pseudobulges Recent work suggests that there are more pseudobulges at
early Hubble types than Kormendy  Kennicutt thought Fisher  Drory
2008 Weinzirl et al 2009 S0 galaxies contain pseudobulges more often
than Sa galaxies consistent with parallel-sequence galaxy classications in
which S0s form a sequence in P BT that parallels the sequence of spirals
Section 17 At late Hubble types Sc  Im galaxies appear never to contain
classical bulges Many Scd  Sm galaxies do not contain pseudobulges either
M 33 is an example and the main reason is that r depends little enough
on radius so that it is not energetically protable to transport angular
momentum outward Section 124
I conclude with a point of perspective from Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004
In the early 1970s when I was a graduate student Hubble classication
was in active use but we also knew about many regular features in galaxy
disks such as lens components nuclear inner and outer rings nuclear bars
and boxy bulges that we did not understand and that often were not even
included in the classication We also knew many peculiar galaxies no two of
John Kormendy
which look alike they did not t comfortably into Hubble classication and
we did not understand them either Now both the peculiar galaxies and the
structural regularities are becoming well understood within two paradigms
of galaxy evolution that got their start in the late 1970s The peculiar
galaxies were once normal but now are undergoing tidal interactions or are
galaxy mergers in progress Section 181 And structures such as rings and
lenses that are seen in many galaxies are products of the secular evolution
of relatively isolated galaxy disks Between collisions galaxies do not just
sit quietly and age their stellar populations Galaxies represent snapshots
of moments in time during dynamical evolution that goes on today and that
will contine to go on for many billions of years to come
16 Astrophysical implications of pseudobulges
The general implications of pseudobulges for galaxy formation are the main
subject of this Winter School Here I focus on two additional astrophysical
implications that came  at least to me  as a surprise First is the challenge
that classical-bulge-less galaxies even ones that contain pseudobulges
present for our picture of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering and
merging Second is the lack of any tight correlation between the masses of
supermassive black holes and the properties of pseudobulges
161 A challenge for our theory of galaxy formation
by hierarchical clustering and merging
Why are there so many pure-disk galaxies
Look at any movie of a numerical simulation of hierarchical clustering in
action Your overwhelmingly strong impression will be that the lives of
dark matter halos are violent They continually collide with and accrete
smaller halos which  by and large  approach from random directions
And virtually no halo grows large without undergoing at least a few major
mergers between progenitors of comparable mass
Given this merger violence how can there be so many bulgeless galaxies
The puzzle has two parts How does hierarchical clustering prevent the
formation of classical bulges that are the scrambled-up remnants of the
progenitor stars that predate the merger And how does the merger assembly
of galaxy halos prevent the destruction of large but very at disks at least
some of which are made in part of old stars Bulgeless disks are not rare
 In this review as in Kormendy et al 2010 I will adopt the sucient and practical denition
that a large galaxy is one in which the circular orbit rotation velocities of massless test
particles at large radii are Vcirc  150 km s1
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Figure 148 shows the purest examples of this problem the iconic late-type
galaxies whose edge-on orientations make it clear that they have no
classical bulges and no signs of pseudobulges Such galaxies are common

2009 and van der Kruit  Freeman 2011 review superthin galaxies
It is a challenge to explain these galaxies It helps that they are not large
Hyperleda lists rotation velocities of Vcirc  95 79 97 and 92 km s1 for
UGC 7321 IC 2233 IC 5249 and UGC 711 respectively This is smaller
than Vcirc  13510 km s1 in M 33 Corbelli  Salucci 2000 Corbelli 2003

Explaining bulgeless disks is least dicult for dwarf galaxies They suer
fewer mergers and tend to accrete gas in cold streams or as gas-rich dwarfs

al 2010 Attempts to explain pure disks have come closest to success in
explaining dwarf galaxies Robertson et al 2004 Governato et al 2010
Kormendy et al 2010 conclude that the highest-mass pure-disk galaxies
are the ones that most constrain our formation picture They inventory all
giant galaxies Vcirc  150 km s1 at distances D  8 Mpc within which we
can resolve small enough radii to nd or exclude even the smallest bulges
Table 13 documents the BT and P BT luminosity ratios for these galaxies
Giant bulgeless galaxies are not rare Figure 149 shows the most extreme
galaxies in which BT  0 rigorously Kormendy et al 2010 emphasize

bulge-to-total luminosity ratios of BT  0 They have the smallest pseudobulges

that we do not have the freedom to postulate classical bulges which have
arbitrary properties such as low surface brightnesses that make them easy
to hide Classical bulges and ellipticals satisfy well-dened fundamental
plane correlations Fig 168 Objects that satisfy these correlations cannot
be hidden in the above galaxies So BT  0 in 419 of the giant galaxies
in our sample Seven more galaxies contain pseudobulges since we believe
that these are grown secularly out of disks and not made via mergers these
are pure-disk galaxies from the hierarchical clustering point of view Four
more galaxies contain classical bulges smaller than any that are made in
hierarchical clustering simulations Only M 31 and M 81 have classical bulges
with BT  13 and only two more galaxies are ellipticals with BT  1

John Kormendy
Kormendy et al 2010 conclude that giant bulgeless galaxies do not
form the rare tail of a distribution of formation histories that include a few
fortuitously mergerless galaxies In the eld the problem of forming giant
pure-disk galaxies by hierarchical clustering is acute
In contrast in the
Virgo cluster 
 23 of the stellar mass is in merger remnants Therefore the
problem of explaining pure-disk galaxies is a strong function of environment
This is a sign that AGN feedback the physics popularly used to address
the problem is not the answer The eectiveness of energy feedback depends
on galaxy mass
In contrast galaxies tell us that environment is the
controlling factor Giant pure-disk galaxies Fig 149 are more massive
than small ellipticals And the thin disk of our Galaxy  which given its
boxy bar is a giant pure-disk galaxy  contains stars as old as 10 Gyr Oswalt
et al 1996 Winget  Kepler 2008 So I suggest that the solution to the
pure-disk problem is not to use energy feedback to delay disk star formation
in order to give the halo time to grow without forming a classical bulge I
believe that a viable solution must use the environmental dependence of the
pure-disk galaxy problem in an essential way e g Peebles  Nusser 2010
162 Supermassive black holes do not correlate with pseudobulges
Kormendy  Ho 2013 review a modest revolution that is in progress in
studies of supermassive black holes BHs in galaxy centers For more than
a decade observed BH demographics have suggested a simple picture in
which BH masses M show a single correlation each with many properties of
their host galaxies Fig 150 Most inuential was the discovery of a tight
correlation between M and the velocity dispersion  of the host bulge at
radii where stars mainly feel each other and not the BH Ferrarese  Merritt
2000 Gebhardt et al 2000 Tremaine et al 2002 Gultekin et al 2009
Correlations are also observed between M and bulge luminosity Kormendy

al 2005 Springel et al 2005 Hopkins et al 2006 Somerville et al 2008
This simple picture is now evolving into a richer and more plausible story
in which BHs correlate dierently with dierent kinds of galaxy components
BHs do not correlate at all with galaxy disks Kormendy  Gebhardt 2001
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Kormendy et al 2011 Kormendy  Ho 2013 although some pure-disk
galaxies contain BHs see Ho 2008 for a review And despite contrary views
Ferrarese 2002 Baes et al 2003 Volonteri et al 2011 it is clear that BHs
do not correlate tightly enough with dark matter halos to imply any special
relationship between them beyond the fact that dark matter controls most of
the gravity that makes hierarchical clustering happen Ho 2007 Kormendy
 Bender 2011 Kormendy  Ho 2013 So BHs coevolve only with bulges
What about pseudobulges They are closely connected with disks but
some contain BHs The best example is our Galaxy Genzel et al 2010
Hu 2008 nds for a small sample that BHs in pseudobulges have smaller
M than BHs in classical bulges and ellipticals of the same  Graham 2008
reports the possibly related result that barred galaxies also deviate from the
M   relation in having small M but interpretation is complicated by
the fact that some of his barred galaxies contain classical bulges e g NGC
1023 NGC 4258 some contain pseudobulges e g NGC 3384 our Galaxy
and some contain both NGC 2787 More denitively results similar to
Hus are found by Nowak et al 2010 and by Greene et al 2010
Kormendy et al 2011 and Kormendy  Ho 2013 now show for larger
samples that pseudobulges correlate little enough with M so coevolution
is not implied Fig 150 This simplies the problem of coevolution by
focusing our attention on galaxy mergers
It is a substantial success of
the secular evolution picture that a morphological classication of bulges
separates them into two kinds that correlate dierently with BHs

17 Environmental secular evolution
The structure and formation of S0 and spheroidal galaxies
Research on internal secular evolution is now a major industry but work on
environmental secular evolution still is a series of important but disconnected
cottage industries We need to make the subject an integral part of our
standard picture of galaxy evolution This section reviews environmental
secular evolution following Kormendy  Bender 2012
Our theme is that dwarf spheroidal dSph galaxies such as Draco and
UMi and higher-luminosity Sph galaxies such as NGC 205 are transformed
red and dead spiral and irregular galaxies and that many S0 galaxies
similarly are transformed earlier-type spirals That is Sph galaxies are
bulgeless S0s The easiest way to introduce this theme is using Fig 151
This is one of the best-known extragalactic images but it is not widely
realized that it includes an easy way to form a mental picture of the dierence
between elliptical and spheroidal galaxies In doing so it speaks directly to
the fundamental question What is an elliptical galaxy Fig 152

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
171 What is and what is not an elliptical galaxy
In Fig 151 M 31 is an Sb spiral with a classical bulge BT  034  003
Kormendy et al 2010 Absent the disk the bulge is indistinguishable from
a smallish elliptical M 32 is one of the tinest true ellipticals with a V -band
absolute magnitude of MV  167 Kormendy et al 2009 It is small and
dense and commonly called a compact elliptical cE But compactness is
not a disease it is mandated by the physics that makes the Fundamental
Plane Figs 157 168 In fact M 32 is an entirely normal example of a tiny
elliptical Kormendy et al 2009 In contrast NGC 205 is the most luminous
example in the Local Group of a galaxy that satises the morphological
denition of an elliptical but that diers quantitatively from ellipticals as
a result it is typed E5 pec NGC 205 has the same luminosity as M 32
MV  166 Mateo 1998 It looks dierent because it is larger lower in
surface brightness and shallower in surface brightness gradient Measured
quantitatively these dierences put NGC 205 near the bright end of a
sequence of elliptical-looking galaxies that is disjoint from  in fact almost
perpendicular to  the sequence of ellipticals and classical bulges in Figs 143
157 168  169 and 171 This means that NGC 205 is not an elliptical
Fig 152 What is an elliptical galaxy Morphologically the dwarf galaxy Leo I
top-middle panel resembles the dwarf irregulars Leo A and GR 8 in its low surface
brightness and shallow brightness gradient But it resembles the giant elliptical M 87
in having elliptical isophotes and no cold gas Since only the latter characteristics
morphologically dene ellipticals Leo I is often called a dwarf elliptical However
purely morphological criteria prove unable to distinguish objects that have dierent
formation histories Leo I turns out to be related to dI galaxies not to ellipticals So
I do not call it a dwarf elliptical rather I call it a dwarf spheroidal dSph galaxy
John Kormendy
Finding gas and young stars in it supports this conclusion We call such
objects spheroidal galaxies Sphs adapting a name dwarf spheroidal
that is in common use for smaller examples The fact that NGC 205 has
surface brightnesses similar to those of the disk of M 31 is not an accident
A variety of evidence leads to the conclusion that Sph galaxies are defunct
late-type galaxies whereas classical bulges and ellipticals are the remnants
of major galaxy mergers This story is the subject of the present section
Recall Section 134 how classical morphologists attach no interpretation
to descriptions whereas physical morphologists try to construct a system in
which classication bins uniquely separate objects that have dierent origin
and evolution I emphasized there that even though classical morphologists
try to avoid interpretation they nevertheless makes choices about which
features to view as important and which to view as secondary Figure 152
illustrates how this results in a problem for classifying elliptical galaxies In
its isophote shape Leo I resembles the elliptical galaxy M 87 However in its
surface brightness it resembles the irregular galaxies Leo A and Gr 8 Hubble
classication is based mainly on isophote shape so it has been common to
call galaxies like Leo I and NGC 205 dwarf ellipticals e g Sandage 1961
But there has never been any guarantee that structural morphology identies
physically dierent kinds of objects Figure 153 makes this point concrete
Fig 153 The danger of classifying using only morphology Who does not belong
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Fig 154 Dolphins are Mammals Convergent evolution happens It happens to
galaxies as well as to creatures on Earth and elliptical and spheroidal galaxies prove
to be examples They look morphologically similar but have dierent formation
histories I warmly thank Douglas Martin httpwwwdolphinandcowcom for

Who does not belong in Fig 153 The answer is of course well known
Fig 154 Dolphins Fig 153 top right are mammals even though they
are morphologically similar to sharks Fig 153 top left To make a living
both need to be well streamlined strong swimmers Convergent evolution
made them that way In contrast a leafy seadragon Fig 153 bottom right
httppicasawebgooglecomlhphotocEq5cwlB2 cmufKXlOKJcg is a
kind of seahorse whose main need is good camouage to avoid predators
So even though it is a sh its morphology has evolved to be very dierent
from that of a shark A Hubble classication of sea animals that was
supercially based on visible structural characteristics could mistakenly
combine sharks and dolphins into the same or closely related classication
bins and could miss the more subtle but more important dierences
that distinguish sharks and sea dragons from dolphins and cows Which
parameters best distinguish the physical dierences that are most important
to us is not necessarily obvious without detailed study
Convergent evolution happens to galaxies too
John Kormendy
172 The E  Sph dichotomy
Why did we ever think that Leo I and NGC 205 are ellipticals The answer
is that research on galaxies began with descriptive classical morphology
e g Hubble 1936 de Vaucouleurs 1959 Sandage 1961 and then the
above galaxies satisfy the denition of an elliptical However we will see in
Fig 159 that Sandage et al 1985b had no trouble in distinguishing between
E and dE galaxies of the same luminosity If this sounds surpassingly strange
to you you have the right reaction I will come back to this point below
Astronomers are conservative people  this is often healthy  and most
people clung to the idea that galaxies like Leo I and NGC 205 are ellipticals
even after hints to the contrary started to appear Figure 155 shows an
example Ellipticals lled circles have higher surface brightness at lower
galaxy luminosities whereas dwarf ellipticals open circles and crosses
have lower surface brightnesses at lower luminosities M 32 is consistent
with the extrapolation of the E sequence However at that time we thought
that M 32 is compact because it has been tidally truncated by M 31 King
1962 Faber 1973 Bingelli et al 1984 therefore concluded that E and dE
galaxies form a continuous but not monotonic sequence in surface brightness
as a function of luminosity Meanwhile one could wonder whether the two
sequences in Fig 155 already hint at dierent formation physics
Fig 155 Parameter correlations for elliptical and dwarf elliptical galaxies from
Bingelli et al 1984 These authors suggested that giant and dwarf ellipticals form
a continuous but not monotonic sequence in mean surface brightness as a function
of absolute magnitude MBT and that M 32  which deviates prominently from this
sequence  is pathological
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Fig 156 Luminosity functions of top normal elliptical galaxies roughly from
M 32 to M 87 and bottom spheroidal galaxies roughly from Draco and UMi to
galaxies such as NGC 205 Wirth  Gallagher 1984 At that time spheroidals
were commonly called dwarf ellipticals This gure then shows that the smallest
non-dwarf ellipticals have lower luminosity than the biggest dwarf ellipticals
Wirth  Gallagher 1984 were the rst to suggest that M 32-like compact
ellipticals and not the more diuse galaxies like Draco and Leo I and
NGC 205 form the faint end of the luminosity sequence of elliptical galaxies
This was based on a successful search for relatively isolated dwarf compact
ellipticals which resemble M 32 The new compact ellipticals and the well
known ones that are companions to larger galaxies were found to lie along the
extrapolation to lower luminosity of the correlations for normal ellipticals
of parameters such as eective radius and velocity dispersion With respect
to this family of normal ellipticals the diuse ellipticals are a distinct
structural family of spheroids whose properties begin to diverge from those
of the classical ellipticals at an absolute magnitude of MB  18 At
MV  15 these two families dier in mean surface brightness by nearly two
orders of magnitude The key point to note for this discussion is that in the
range 18 
 15 both structural classes of elliptical galaxies coexist
Wirth  Gallagher 1984 This implies that the luminosity functions of
elliptical and spheroidal galaxies dier as shown in Fig 156
The Wirth  Gallagher 1984 paper was largely based on four newly
found free-ying compact ellipticals The competing idea Faber 1973 that
compact ellipticals are tidally truncated was largely based on three galaxies
M 32 NGC 4486B and NGC 5846A then the diuse dwarfs would be the
faint extension of the E sequence With both conclusions based on small
numbers of galaxies it was not clear which picture is correct The rest of this
section reviews the now very strong evidence that Wirth  Gallagher 1984
were presciently close to correct in almost every detail including Fig 156
John Kormendy
As a graduate student at Caltech in the early 1970s I was brought up
on the picture that ellipticals form a continuous non-monotonic sequence in
their structural parameters from the brightest to the faintest galaxies known
Then in the 1980s I gained access to two important technical advances
The rst was CCD detectors that are linear in sensitivity over large dynamic
ranges The second was the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope CFHT which
had the best seeing then available on any optical telescope These allowed
me to study the central structure of galaxies in unprecedented detail The
results revolutionized my picture of ellipticals They conrmed and extended
Wirth  Gallagher 1984 whose ideas I was not aware of until the end of
my work The story is instructive for students so I describe it here in detail
abstracted from a popular article in Stardate magazine Kormendy 2008b
My CFHT surface photometry showed an unexpected result Fig 157
Ellipticals dene the sequence of red points less luminous ones are smaller
and higher in surface brightness from M 87 to M 32 This much was expected
for bright galaxies it is the correlation shown by the lled circles in Fig 155
Importantly the high-resolution CFHT photometry helps to ll in the gap
between M 32 and the other ellipticals This makes M 32 look less peculiar
Fig 157 Kormendy 1985 1987 showed with much larger samples that E and Sph
galaxies form disjoint sequences in parameter space cf Wirth  Gallagher 1984
Sphs yellow are not faint ellipticals red Instead their parameter correlations are
almost identical to those of dwarf spiral and irregular galaxies blue This gure
shows approximate central surface brightness and King 1966 core radius both
corrected as well as possible for PSF blurring versus B-band absolute magnitude
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
The surprise was the behavior of the dwarf ellipticals shown in Fig 157
by yellow points Using near-central parameters rather than parameters
measured within the eective radii re as in Fig 155 it is clear that dwarf
ellipticals do not satisfy the correlations for elliptical galaxies Less luminous
dwarf ellipticals are lower  not higher  in surface brightness A gap
has appeared between ordinary and dwarf ellipticals Wirth  Gallaghers
1984 conclusions are conrmed with a much larger sample
Size and density are diagnostic of galaxy formation so I realized at this
point that dwarf ellipticals are not ellipticals at all As one point after
another got plotted and intermediate cases failed to show up my previous
picture of elliptical galaxies fell apart Kuhn 1970 captures exactly what
happens in a scientists mind when his understanding of a subject falls apart
Quoting Kormendy 2008b The rst reaction was consternation What
have I screwed up I checked my data reduction I considered whether my
galaxy sample could be biased Nothing seemed wrong Better data just led
in an unexpected direction I had to accept the new result dwarf ellipticals
are not ellipticals But then we should not call them dwarf ellipticals
The smallest such companions to our Milky Way had sometimes been called
dwarf spheroidals So to minimize the departure from tradition I called all
such objects spheroidals The biggest ones in Virgo are only as luminous
as an average elliptical but they are giant spheroidals
If spheroidals are not ellipticals what are they Kuhn describes what
happens next Deprived of the guidance of any previous understanding of a
subject a scientist in the midst of a scientic revolution does not know what
to do next In turmoil and in desperation wild ideas get tried out most of
them wrong I plotted in my diagrams all the other kinds of stellar systems
that I knew about I plotted globular clusters of stars green points spiral
galaxy disks two large blue plus signs each an average for several galaxies
from Freeman 1970 and irregular galaxies blue plus signs The globulars
were unconnected with ellipticals and spheroidals But the irregulars and
spirals were a surprise They showed exactly the same correlations as the
spheroidals Aha A new picture was emerging Maybe spheroidals are
related to spirals and irregulars They have almost the same structure
They dont contain gas and young stars which are common in spirals and
irregulars And they have smoother structure But I realized that if the
gas were removed or converted into stars dynamical evolution of the now-
gasless spheroidal would smooth out its formerly patchy structure within a
few galactic rotations We knew that the dwarf spheroidal companions of
the Milky Way had varied star formation histories A few contain only old
stars as ellipticals do but most experienced several bursts of star formation
John Kormendy
and the most recent burst was a few billion or even as little as a few hundred
million years ago What are galaxies that have not yet had their last burst
of star formation and that therefore still must contain gas This is not
a controversial question Kormendy  Bender 1994 They are irregulars
I realized
if we looked at the Milky Ways dwarf spheroidals when the
Universe was half of its present age about half of them would still be
irregulars Irregulars have been turning into Sphs gradually over most of
the history of the Universe In the Virgo cluster lots of processes can make
this happen The most obvious is ram-pressure stripping as an irregular
galaxy falls into Virgo for the rst time it rams into the million-degree gas
that lls the cluster and its cold gas gets swept away It started to look
like no accident that the irregulars in Virgo live around the outside of the
cluster while the center is inhabited by spheroidals Binggeli et al 1987
Within a few days I had a new picture Spheroidals are defunct spiral
and irregular galaxies converted by their environment to look like ellipticals
This helped our picture of galaxy formation because we already knew
that ellipticals form by galaxy mergers whereas quoting Tremaine 1981
Dwarf elliptical satellite galaxies cannot form by mergers with other
satellites since their relative velocities are too high We were in trouble when
we had to nd a single formation process that could explain NGC 4472 one
of the biggest galaxies in the nearby Universe and dwarf spheroidals that
are a million times less luminous and that look like fragile gossamer clouds
of stars Fig 158 here But they look like the smallest irregulars minus gas
and young stars Fig 152 here So this problem was solved I reported these
results at a workshop in Rehovot Israel and they were well received The
result that E and Sph galaxies are dierent is called the E  Sph dichotomy
Fig 158 Luminosity sequence of dSph satellites of our Galaxy Fornax Sculptor
and Draco have absolute magnitudes of MV  132 111 and 88 respectively
Mateo 1998 and correspondingly decreasing surface brightnesses see Fig 157
Draco is the cloud of faint stars in the right panel the bright stars with the
instrumentally-produced red halos are foreground stars in our Galaxy Contrast
M 87 in Fig 152 Could M 87 and Draco really have similar formation histories
with dierent results only because changing the mass tweaks the formation physics
The results reviewed here imply that the answer is no We now believe that M 87
is a remnant of the dynamical violence of galaxy mergers whereas Draco formed
quescently as a dwarf irregular that lost its gas long ago From Kormendy 2008b

173 Mixed reactions to the E  Sph dichotomy
Scientic research is a quintessentially human enterprise as reactions to the
above result illustrate
The essential theoretical understanding of why Sph and SIm galaxies
have lower stellar densities at lower galaxy masses followed immediately
Dekel  Silk 1986 suggest that both the dIs and the dEs here dSphs
have lost most of their mass in supernova-driven winds after the rst burst
of star formation and that this process determined their nal structural
relations The dIs somehow managed to retain a small fraction of their
original gas while the dEs either have lost all of their gas at the rst burst
of star formation or passed through a dI stage before they lost the rest of the
gas and turned dE Our story here adds detail on dI dSph transformation
processes but otherwise is based on exactly the above picture
Reactions among observers have been more mixed The reasons are
many and revealing and occasionally entertaining they range from innate
conservatism to specic scientic arguments to turf wars I will concentrate
on the part of this history that is most instructive for students
I already noted that many astronomers are conservative they do not easily
discard a picture that they believed in for many years This is healthy 
imagine what would happen if we chased willy-nilly after every outrageous
idea that got proposed It is prudent to treat new ideas with respect but in
a mature subject it is uncommon for a long-held well-supported picture to
be completely wrong The situation is more tricky when subjects are young
and not yet well developed This proved to be such a case Nevertheless
it is understandable that people who had long been involved in research on
dwarf galaxies reacted to the above developments with some ambivalence In
particular the group of Sandage Binggeli Tammann and Tarenghi wrote a
series of papers on the Virgo cluster in the mid-1980s some before and some
after the Wirth  Gallagher 1984 and Kormendy 1985 1987 papers
Struggles with the new ideas were evident in some of the later papers The
nature of these struggles reveals how seeds of the new ideas could have been
recognized in the older results I belabor this point because the conceptual
blindness that results when we embrace a paradigm of how nature works
always threatens our ability to see something new As you do your research
it is healthy to be careful and conservative but also prudent to ask yourself
Am I missing something because of paradigm-induced conceptual blindness
Kuhn 1970 provides a perceptive discussion of this subject
Figure 155 already illustrated how one hint  the opposite slopes of the
surface-brightnessluminosity correlations  was contained in previous work
John Kormendy
Fig 159 Luminosity functions of elliptical and spheroidal galaxies in the Virgo
cluster This gure is adapted from Sandage et al 1985b who used the traditional
name dE for spheroidals I have updated the Hubble constant from H0  50 to
70 km s1 Mpc1 Magnitudes are in B band From Kormendy  Bender 2012
Figure 159 is a better illustration Sandage et al 1985b It shows with
data on Virgo galaxies the result that is shown schematically in Fig 156
The luminosity function of ellipticals is bounded at high and low L M 32 has
normal properties for its low luminosity but such tiny ellipticals are rare In
contrast spheroidal galaxies which Sandage et al 1985b call dEs never
are very bright but they get rapidly more common at lower luminosities
until they are lost in the detection noise The steep faint-end slope of the
luminosity function had been recognized for a long time Zwicky 1942 1951
1957 and is built into the well known Schechter 1976 analytic luminosity
function But to the best of my knowledge Sandage et al 1985a b
and Binggeli et al 1988 were the rst to measure luminosity functions
separately for dierent morphological types of galaxies and to show that only
Sph galaxies have luminosity functions that continue to rise with decreasing
luminosity to the detection limit of the data This is the solid result in
Fig 159 Here is the incongruity
Sandage et al 1985b distinguish between elliptical and dwarf elliptical
galaxies of the same luminosity Quoting Kormendy  Bender 2012 A
dwarf version of a creature is one that when mature is smaller than the
normal sizes of non-dwarf versions of that creature    And yet Fig 159
invites us to imagine that the smallest non-dwarf ellipticals are 20 times less
luminous than the brightest dwarf ellipticals
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Sandage and collaborators recognized and struggled with this incongruity
Quoting Sandage  Binggeli 1984 The distinction between E and dE
types is made on morphological grounds alone using surface brightness
as the criterion Normal E galaxies have a steep radial proe generally
following an r14 law with high central brightness The typical dE has a
nearly at radial prole following either a King 1966 model with a small
concentration index or equally well an exponential law The morphological
transition from E to dE is roughly at MB  18 but there is overlap
Recognition of this dierence dates back at least to Baade 1944 NGC 147
and NGC 185 are elliptical nebulae of very low luminosity In structure they
deviate considerably from what is considered the typical E-type nebula In
both objects the density gradient is abnormally low Binggeli et al 1985
also recognized the quantitative similarity beween spheroidals and irregulars
their Virgo membership criteria applied are 1 dE and Im members have
low surface brightness     Soon afterward Sandage et al 1985b admit
that We are not certain if this E  dE dichotomy is totally a tautology due
merely to the arbitrary classication criteria that separate E from dE types
   or if the faint cuto in the E luminosity function has physical meaning
related to the properties of E and dE types In the rst case the problem
would be only one of denition In the second the fundamental dierence in
the forms of the luminosity functions of E and dE types    would suggest
that two separate physical families may in fact exist with no continuity
between them cf Kormendy 1985 for a similar conclusion Revising a
long-held picture can be uncomfortable
Within a few more years Binggeli et al 1988 recognized that The
distinction between Es and dEs must almost certainly mean that the two
classes are of dierent origin Kormendy 1985 Dekel  Silk 1986 This is
also supported by the fact that the luminosity functions of Virgo Es and
dEs are dierent And Binggeli  Cameron 1991 concluded that there
are no true intermediate types between E and dE The E  dE dichotomy
is model-independent emphasis in the original
But psychology did not lose its hold on people Binggeli changed his mind
in a section entitled The EdE dichotomy and how it disappears Jerjen 
Binggeli 1997 emphasize the observation that in a plot of brightness prole
Sersic index versus MBT  E and dE galaxies show a continuous correlation
They conclude that compact ellipticals like M 32 and its analogs in Virgo
are special and that dEs form the extension of the ellipticals to low L
However this is not the only relevant correlation The observations which
suggest the dichotomy had not disappeared And the fact that one can nd
parameters of galaxies that are insensitive to the dierences between two
John Kormendy
types does not prove that the two types are the same Many parameters are
continuous between ellipticals and spheroidals E g the content of heavy
elements is not only a continuous function of luminosity for ellipticals and
spheroidals it is essentially the same continuous function for spirals and
irregulars too e g Mateo 1998 If we looked only at element abundances
we would be blind to all structural dierences encoded in Hubble types
More recent criticisms of the E  Sph dichotomy are reviewed in Kormendy
et al 2009 and in Kormendy  Bender 2012 The arguments involve
technical details such as sample size and prole analysis techniques These
are of less immediate interest and any discussion of them quickly gets long
I therefore refer readers to the above papers for our answers to the criticisms
A few are relevant here and will be discussed below But the best way to
address uncertainty about the E  Sph dichotomy is to observe larger samples
of galaxies and to address more general scientic questions as follows
174 Conrming the ESph dichotomy with large galaxy samples
Kormendy et al 2009 KFCB extend the sample size of the parameter
correlations in Fig 157 by measuring brightness proles for all known
ellipticals in the Virgo cluster and combining these with data on  275 Sph
galaxies Examples are shown in Fig 160 Data from many sources were
combined to construct composite proles over large dynamic ranges Sersic
functions t most of the galaxy light to remarkable precision over the t
ranges vertical dashes in Fig 160 the average RMS deviation  0040
mag arcsec2 for the whole KFCB sample Kormendy 2009 further added
ellipticals from Bender et al 1992 and Sphs from Chiboucas et al 2009
The updated Fig 157 is shown in Fig 161

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Figure 161 strongly conrms the dichotomy between E and Sph galaxies
as found in Kormendy 1985 1987 Binggeli  Cameron 1991 and Bender
et al 1992 1993 Note that the Sph sequence approaches the E sequence
near its middle not near its faint end
Fig 161 Global parameter correlations from KFCB and Kormendy 2009 with
Sph galaxies in the Local and M 81 groups updated from Kormendy  Bender
2012 This gure shows 90 ellipticals and 295 spheroidals One elliptical plots in
the Sph sequence when eective parameters are used dicult cases such as this
one were classied in KFCB using parameters measured at the radius that contains
10  of the total light Reason the E  Sph dichotomy is most pronounced when
near-central parameters are used contrast Fig 157 with this gure
John Kormendy
The small-re bright-e end of the sequence of ellipticals is dened in
part by galaxies like M 32 that are sometimes called compact ellipticals
As noted above compact ellipticals are not a special class They are
continuously connected to brighter ellipticals in essentially all parameters
Moreover M 32 is no longer unique as it appeared to be in Fig 157 We
now know of a number of M 32 analogs Binggeli et al 1985 Lauer et al
1995 Faber et al 1997 KFCB Figure 161 illustrates and KFCB reviews
evidence that M 32 is normal for its low L However it is often suggested
that these galaxies are compact only because they have been tidally stripped
by much larger companions e g Faber 1973 Ferrarese et al 2006 Bekki
et al 2001 Chen et al 2010 Kormendy  Bender 2012 review why it
is not plausible that this is the explanation for why small Es are compact
This issue is important so I enumerate the arguments here
a Compact ellipticals are not always companions of brighter galaxies Wirth 
Gallagher 1984 Some are so isolated that no tidal encounter with a big galaxy
is likely ever to have happened e g VCC 1871 Kormendy  Bender 2012
b Compact Es do not have small Sersic indices suggestive of tidal truncation
In fact they have the same range of Sersic indices n  2 to 35 as isolated
coreless ellipticals For example M 32 has n  29 larger than the median
value for coreless ellipticals Numerical simulations show that major mergers
of gas-poor galaxies like the ones in the nearby Universe make remnants that
have exactly the above range of Sersic indices Hopkins et al 2009a
c Many Sph galaxies also are companions of bright galaxies but we do not argue
that they have been truncated amd thereby made abnormally compact An
example is NGC 205 which is shown by the open square at MV T  166 in
Fig 161 It is much uer than M 32
d Figure 168 below will show that the compact end of the E sequence is also
dened by tiny bulges Classical bulges and ellipticals have closely similar
parameter correlations Most classical bulges that appear in our correlation
diagrams do not have bright companion galaxies
e In Fig 161 the ellipticals from M 32 to cD galaxies dene projections of the
fundamental plane correlations Djorgovski  Davis 1987 Faber et al 1987
Djorgovski et al 1988 Bender et al 1992 Its interpretation is well known
galaxy parameters are controlled by the Virial theorem modied by small
nonhomologies N-body simulations of major galaxy mergers reproduce the
E-galaxy fundamental plane not the Sph parameter sequence that is almost
perpendicular to it Robertson et al 2006 Hopkins et al 2008 2009b
Kormendy and Bender conclude some compact Es may have been pruned
slightly but tidal truncation is not the reason why the E sequence extends
to the left of where it is approached by the Sph sequence in Fig 161
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
1741 Classical bulges and ellipticals satisfy the same fundamental plane
parameter correlations I Bulge-disk decomposition
Point d above anticipates the result of this subsection classical bulges are
essentially indistinguishable from elliptical galaxies of the same luminosity
This in turn was further anticipated when I dened classical bulges to be
elliptical galaxies that happen to live in the middle of a disk Here the time
has come to ante up the evidence by adding classical bulges to Fig 161
Figure 162 emphasizes the most important requirement for this analysis
For each disk galaxy it is necessary to decompose the observed brightness
distribution into pseudobulge and disk parts This is a fundamental part of
the classication of the central component as classical or pseudo It provides
separately the parameters of the bulge and the disk both of which we need
For some applications a kinematic decomposition is also needed
Photometric decomposition is the crucial requirement that allows us to
ask whether classical bulges satisfy the parameter correlations for ellipticals
Absent such a decomposition even the distinction between ellipticals and
spheroidals is blurred This is part of the reason why Ferrarese et al 2006
Chen et al 2010 and Glass et al 2011 do not see the E  Sph dichotomy
If bulges and disks are combined in various proportions and then measured
as one-component galaxies it is inevitable that the resulting parameters
will be intermediate between those of bulges and disks and that including
them will blur the distinction between the bulge and Sph disk sequences
in Fig 161 see Figs 76 and 77 in KFCB and Figs 163 and 164 here
Fig 162 left Sombrero Galaxy and right NGC 4762 the second-brightest S0
galaxy in the Virgo cluster These galaxies illustrate why bulge-disk decomposition
is necessary NGC 4594 is an Sa galaxy with BT  093 002 Kormendy 2011b
Without photometric decomposition we measure essentially only the bulge We
learn nothing about the disk
If an S0 version of this galaxy e g NGC 3115
were viewed face-on it would be dicult even to discover the disk Hamabe 1982
In contrast NGC 4762 is an edge-on S0 with a tiny bulge BT  013  002
Fig 163 Without photometric decomposition we measure essentially only the
disk We learn nothing about the bulge
John Kormendy
The need for bulge-disk decomposition can best be understood using an
analogy Imagine studying a population of people horses and people who
ride on horses Knowing nothing about them one might measure parameters
and plot parameter correlations linear size mass     to look for dierent
physical populations and regularities within each population that might
drive interpretation We need to be careful because some parameters
volume mass density within this analogy mass-to-light ratio for galaxies
prove to be insensitive to structural dierences Still careful parameter study
is promising But the biggest people are bigger than the smallest horses If
random people are paired with random horses and the resulting population
of peoplehorses together with some pure people and some pure horses
are analyzed as one-component systems it is inevitable that a complete
continuity will be found between people and horses But it would be wrong
to conclude that people are the same as horses Rather if one decomposes
people and horses when they occur together and measures their parameters
separately it will be found that some parameter correlations clearly separate
people of various sizes from horses of various sizes even though their size
distributions overlap Further study will also show that certain special
parameters semi-trivially number of arms versus number of legs in this
analogy near-central parameters in the cases of galaxies are especially
helpful in distinguishing the physically dierent populations that are under
study The one elliptical galaxy red point that lies within the sequence of
Sphs green points in some panels of Fig 161 was classied using central
parameters Fig 34 in KFCB
It feels strange to beat this dead horse Im sorry  I could not resist

30 years It quickly became standard analysis Kormendy 1977a Burstein

all S0 galaxies from the HST ACS Virgo Cluster survey Cote et al 2004

added to the parameter correlation diagrams in Fig 168 But another and
 it will turn out  especially interesting result will be to extend the Sph
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
sequence to higher luminosities Kormendy  Bender 2012 conclude that
Sph galaxies and S0 disks but not bulges are continuous in their parameter
correlations That is Sph galaxies are bulgeless S0s
Three galaxies serve here to illustrate the transition from S0 galaxies with
large classical bulges and at disks to Sph galaxies with no bulges and with
structure that can be vertically disky or thick We start with NGC 4762
Figure 162 shows that it diers from our canonical picture of Hubble
classication Sandage 1961 in which S0 galaxies are transition objects
between elliptical and Sa galaxies The bulge-to-total luminosity ratio BT
is a classication parameter BT  1 for ellipticals and BT is intended
to decrease along the sequence E  S0  Sa  Sb  Sc With some noise this is
observed Simien  de Vaucouleurs 1986 But Sidney van den Bergh 1976
already recognized that some S0 galaxies such as NGC 4762 have small
bulges and except for their cold gas content and spiral structure are more
similar in their overall structure to Sbc galaxies than they are to Sa galaxies
As an alternative to the Hubble 1936 tuning-fork diagram he proposed
a parallel sequence classication in which S0 galaxies form a sequence
S0a  S0b  S0c with decreasing BT that parallels the sequence Sa  Sb  Sc
of spiral galaxies with similar decreasing BT ratios Van den Bergh
suggested that late-type S0 galaxies with small bulges are defunct late-type
spiral galaxies that were transformed by environmental processes such as
ram-pressure stripping of cold gas by hot gas in clusters The KB2012
bulge-disk decompositions of NGC 4762 and similar galaxies quantitatively
conrm van den Berghs picture as follows
The brightness prole of NGC 4762 measured along the major axis of
the disk is shown in Fig 163 left It shows a central bright and relatively
round bulge and at larger radii three shelves in a very at edge-on disk The
inner shelf is somewhat subtle but the steep decrease in surface brightness
between the middle and outer shelves is obvious in Fig 162 What is this
complicated structure This may seem like a tricky problem but in fact
it is easy Relatively face-on galaxies that have two or three shelves in
their brightness distributions are very common The ones with two shelves
are the oval-disk galaxies discussed in Section 133 To get a third shelf
it is just necessary to add an early-type bar  these have shallow radial
brightness gradients interior to a sharp outer end Now the bar normally
lls its attendant lens in one dimension Section 1434 and Fig 117 But
consider a non-edge-on SBlens0 galaxy such as NGC 2859 Fig 19 or
NGC 2950 Fig 117 in which the bar has a skew orientation not along
either the apparent major or apparent minor axis If we rotated either of
these galaxies about a horizontal line through the center in the corresponding
John Kormendy
gure until the galaxy was seen edge-on its disk would show three shelves
in its major-axis prole Exterior to the bulge the innermost shelf would be
the bar the next would be the lens and the third would be the outer disk
This is how Kormendy  Bender interpret Fig 163 left Thus NGC 4762
is an edge-on SBlens0 galaxy Bars and lenses have shallow brightness
gradients at small r so prole decomposition is easy The bulge Sersic
index n  229  005 and round shape identify it as classical Importantly
BT  013  002 is very small So Kormendy  Bender 2012 classify
NGC 4762 as SBlens0bc Note in Fig 163 right how measuring NGC
4762 as a single-component system green point with brown center mixes
parameters of the classical bulge brown point and disk green cross Only
after bulge-disk decomposition do we see that the tiny classical bulge of
NGC 4762 helps to dene the compact extension of the E  bulge parameter

NGC 4452 is closely similar to NGC 4762 but is even more extreme
Figure 164 left shows that it too
is an edge-on SBlens0 galaxy
The decomposition robustly shows that NGC 4452 has only a very tiny

John Kormendy
The parameter correlations in Figs 163 and 164 serve to emphasize how
bulge-disk decomposition improves our understanding of the E sequence
The small black lled dots show the parameters measured by Ferrarese et
al 2006 for the ACS Virgo cluster survey S0s They do not violate the
E sequence But they do combine bulge and disk properties into one set of
parameters so they fail to show something that is very important In each of
these two galaxies the bulge is tiny comparable in luminosity to the smallest
ellipticals The classical bulge of NGC 4762 helps to dene the extension of
the E sequence toward objects that are more compact than any spheroidal
Even the tiny pseudobulge of NGC 4452 lies near the compact end of the
Ebulge sequence cf Figs 142 and 143 which show other similarly
compact and tiny pseudobulges Figures 168 and 169 will summarize
the parameter correlations for classical bulges and S0 disks respectively
Here I want to emphasize two things First there exist S0 galaxies with
classical-bulge-to-total luminosity ratios BT that range from almost 1 to
essentially zero The pseudobulge in NGC 4452 is so small that one cannot
hide a signicant classical bulge in that galaxy Second both NGC 4762
and NGC 4552 have vertically thickened and warped outer disks Both
galaxies have nearby companions Kormendy  Bender 2012 interpret
these results as indicating that the outer disks are tidally warped and being
heated dynamically in the vertical direction They present evidence that
many other S0 and Sph galaxies in the Virgo cluster are dynamically heated
too Thus NGC 4762 and NGC 4552 are missing links that have some
properties of S0 galaxies and some properties of the brightest Sph galaxies
NGC 4638 is even more spectacularly an S0  Sph transition object
Figure 165 shows bottom the large-scale structure and top an embedded
edge-on disk and bulge in an enlargement from HST images When we wrote
KB2012 this structure was to our knowledge unique Figure 165 bottom
suggests that NGC 4638 is an edge-on S0 whose bulge happens to be very
boxy This would be interesting but not unique boxy bulges are discussed in
Section 1529 But already in the bottom panel of Fig 165 the structure
looks suspiciously unusual the brightness gradient in the boxy structure
is very shallow like that in its companion the normal SphN galaxy NGC
4637 The top panel of Fig 165 shows an almost-round small bulge in
NGC 4638 with a normal steep brightness gradient To our surprise the
brightness prole robustly shows Fig 166 that the outer boxy structure has
a Sersic brightness prole with n  111  012 characteristic of the main
body of a Sph galaxy This prole is not concave-upward as it would be if the
bulge and the boxy structure where part of the same component with n  4

Kormendy  Bender 2012 therefore conclude that NGC 4638 contains
three structural components and edge-on S0 galaxy that consists of an
n  36 14 classical bulge plus an n  05 01 Gaussian disk embedded in
a normal Sph galaxy with n  111012 I e NGC 4638 has the properties
of both an S0 and a Sph galaxy VCC 2048 is similar Fig 165 caption
It is instructive to compare the parameters of the three components of
NGC 4638 with their counterparts in pure S0 and Sph galaxies Fig 167
The classical bulge helps to dene the compact end of the normal E  Sph
parameter sequence It is within a factor or  2 as compact as M 32 The
disk proves to have the highest eective brightness of any S0 disk shown in
Fig 169 The reasons are 1 that it is edge-on so the path length through
it is large and 2 that its prole is Gaussian rather than exponential the
strong outer truncation results in small re and hence bright e The boxy
component is consistent with the extrapolation of the Sph sequence it is
the brightest Sph galaxy known in the Virgo cluster

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
NGC 4638 lives in a high-density part of the Virgo cluster where strong
dynamical heating is plausible Kormendy  Bender interpret the boxy Sph
part of the galaxy as the dynamically heated remnant of the outer disk
Because these stars are no longer part of a disk the disk that remains has
a strongly truncated i e Gaussian prole
KB2012 discusses additional evidence that higher-luminosity Sphs are by
and large more disky This is consistent with the suggestion that dynamical
heating is one of the S  Sph transformation processes and that this heating
has the smallest eect on the biggest most robust galaxies

1743 Interim summary and road map
In Section 1742 our discussion of the E  Sph dichotomy branched out in
a new direction  the close relationship between Sphs and S0 galaxy disks
Section 175 pursues this Meanwhile it is useful to summarize where we are
Section 17 is about environmental secular evolution The bottom line
will be that a variety of environmental processes appear to have transformed
some intermediate-Hubble-type spiral galaxies into S0s and some late-type
spiral and Magellanic irregular Im galaxies into Sphs Sph galaxies will
prove to be bulgeless S0s Missing link galaxies that have some S0 and
some Sph properties are the new subject that entered the above discussion
Recall that we were in the process of investigating the E  Sph dichotomy
That is even though they look similar elliptical and spheroidal galaxies have
quantitatively dierent structural parameters and parameter correlations
This imples that they have dierent formation histories  histories that
we are in the process of deciphering
I reviewed the history of the
above discovery concentrating on how improved measurements and enlarged
galaxy samples have strengthened the evidence for the dichotomy Originally
not recognized Fig 155 it was rst found using small galaxy samples
Fig 157 and since has been conrmed using 90 ellipticals and 295
spheroidals Fig 161 Our next aim has been to add classical bulges
to increase the sample size and to further show that tiny ellipticals are not
compact because they are tidally stripped This led us into a discussion
of bulge-disk decomposition and a description of three example galaxies
two of which have classical bulges that are substantially as compact as the
smallest ellipticals
In our standard picture of bulge formation by major
mergers these bulges would have formed before their attendant disks It is
implausible that such bulges are compact because they were tidally stripped
The bulge parameters measured and collected in KB2012 now allow us
to pay the piper in conrming our denition of bulges as essentially
ellipticals that live in the middle of a disk This is the subject of Section
1744 I then return to Sph and S0 galaxies in Section 175
1744 Classical bulges and ellipticals satisfy the same fundamental plane
parameter correlations II Results
Figure 168 shows the parameter correlations from Fig 161 with 57 bulges
added Of these 35 are known to be classical via their parameters and
the discussion in the source papers see the key I also add 22 bulges from
Baggett et al 1998 they are shown with open circles because we cannot be
certain that they are classical I examined all of these galaxies and ensured
as well as possible using Section 153 that their bulges are classical
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Figure 168 conrms the assumptions that underlie our denition of
classical bulges they satisfy the same parameter correlations as do ellipticals
Given the uncertainties in bulge-disk decomposition there is no evidence
that the scatter for classical bulges is dierent from that for ellipticals This
is an update of a result that has been found previously e g by Fisher 
Drory 2008 2010 Fig 141 here Pseudobulges can satisfy these relations
but they have much larger scatter and they fade out by becoming low in
surface brightness not by becoming compact Figs 142 and 143

Figure 169 shows Fig 168 with the disks of S0 galaxies added Kormendy
 Bender 2012 conclude that spheroidals are continuous in their parameter
correlations with the disks but not the bulges of S0 galaxies People call a
galaxy an S0 if it has smooth nearly elliptical isophotes and two components
a bulge and a disk
If it has no bulge and only one shallow-surface-
brightness-gradient component we give it a dierent name  a spheroidal

bulge correlation is steeper than that for disks bulges disappear at Vcirc  104 16

That bulges disappear where Fig 169 suggests is shown in Fig 170
Rotation curve decompositions conrm what our experience tells us bulges
disappear at Vcirc  100 km s1 or MV disk  18 Tully  Fisher 1977
There is noise e g M 33 has MV disk  190 and Vcirc  135  10 km s1
Corbelli 2003 and no bulge Kormendy  McClure 1993 But of course
we also expect that disks fade when they are transformed from SIm to S0
Figure 170 is an important observational target for future work the
formation physics that underlies it is largely unknown But there is ample
evidence that bulges disappear approximately where the Sph and S0 disk
sequences meet in Fig 169 This is enough to explain the dierent names
Kormendy  Bender 2012 suggest that the kink in the e  MV
correlation that happens roughly at the transition from S0 disk to Sph tells
us where the correlation turns into a sequence of decreasing baryon retention
at lower galaxy luminosity It is not an accident that this happens roughly
where the bulge contribution to the gravitational potential well disappears

176 Spiral and irregular galaxies have the same structural
correlations as S0 galaxy disks and Sph galaxies
Kormendys 1985 1987 conclusion that Sph galaxies are defunct dSIm
galaxies depended critically on the observation Fig 157 that they all have
the same structural parameter correlations That result was based on a small
number of galaxies and has never been checked KB2012 updates and
extends this test with 407 galaxies that cover the complete luminosity range
from the tiniest dwarf irregulars to the brightest Sc disks Figure 171 shows
that SIm galaxies do indeed have the same parameter correlations as S0
disks and spheroidals Therefore they are closely related

177 A revised parallel-sequence classication of galaxies
Figure 172 shows our proposed revision of Sidney van den Berghs 1976
morphological classication scheme based on the foregoing observations
Van den Bergh put S0 galaxies in a sequence that parallels the spirals the
classication parameter that determines the stage along either sequence is
the pseudobulge-to-total luminosity ratio P BT  Pseudo and classical
bulges are not distinguished in a classication based on small-scale images
this is the only practical strategy Only P BT and not parameters such as
spiral arm pitch angle determine the stage so van den Berghs classication
of spirals is not quite the same as Sandages or de Vaucouleurss We do not
address this issue Figure 172 adopts van den Berghs theme of placing S0s
and spirals in parallel sequences based only on P BT 
Kormendy  Bender extend ven den Berghs discussion in two ways
a They resolve the uneasy aspect of van den Berghs paper that he listed no S0c
or later-type S0 galaxies Based on a comparison of P BT ratios of S0s
with spirals of known Hubble type they nd several of the missing late-
type S0s e g the S0bc galaxy NGC 4762 the S0c galaxy NGC 4452 Section
1742 NGC 4452 is also singled out as an S0c by Cappellari et al 2011 who
independently propose a parallel-sequence classication based on kinematic
maps A few other S0cs are known Laurikainen et al 2011 Buta 2012
b They place Sph galaxies in parallel with Im galaxies They note that in a more
detailed classication that includes Sd and Sm galaxies some Sphs e g ones
with nuclear star clusters would be placed in parallel with late-type especially
Sm spirals and others e g ones without nuclei would be put in parallel with
Ims Adding Sph galaxies at the late-type end of the S0 sequence for the rst
time nds a natural home for them in a morphological classication scheme
Fig 172 Revised parallel-sequence morphological classication of galaxies The E
types are from Kormendy  Bender 1996 Transition objects between spirals and
S0s van den Berghs anemic galaxies exist but are not illustrated Bulge-to-total
ratios decrease toward the right Sc and S0c galaxies have tiny or no pseudobulges
Sph and Im galaxies are bulgeless From KB2012
John Kormendy
It is important to understand which observations lead to Fig 172
They involve quantitative parameter measurements but they do not involve
interpretation First the observations that establish E  S0  Sph continuity
a Galaxies with smooth nearly elliptical isophotes little cold gas and little star
formation range in bulge-to-total luminosity ratio from BT  1 to BT  0
Here the existence of a bulge component and the measurement of BT are
based on quantitative surface photometry on nonparametric measurements of
structural parameters for elliptical and Sph galaxies by integrating the observed
isophotes on parametric Sersic-function-based bulge-disk decomposition for
disk galaxies and on the resulting structural parameter correlations Figs 168
169 When BT  1 we call the object an elliptical when 1  BT  0 we
call the central component a bulge and the outer component  if at  a disk
and when BT  0 we call the galaxy a spheroidal
b In the structural correlations between eective radius re eective brightness
e  re and total absolute magnitude Sph galaxies dene a sequence that
is continuous with the disks but not the bulges of S0 galaxies There is some
overlap in luminosity between Sphs and S0 disks
c NGC 4762 NGC 4452 NGC 4638 and VCC 2048 are galaxies that have both S0
and Sph properties We know this because all four galaxies are seen edge-on
All contain at disks Three contain a tiny pseudobulge VCC 2048 contains
only a nuclear star cluster The thick outer components of all four galaxies
have parameters  including Sersic indices n  1  that are indistinguishable
from those of Sphs That is these galaxies consist of S0 central parts embedded
in Sph or Sph-like outer halos This helps to establish S0  Sph continuity
d Bigger Sph galaxies tend to be dynamically more S0-disk-like they have larger
ratios of rotation velocity to velocity dispersion van Zee et al 2004 Note
at all L some Sphs rotate slowly see KB2012 for a review
These observations justify our conclusion that Sph galaxies are continuous
in their properties with S0 disks which in turn motivates our juxtaposition
of Sph galaxies with S0cs In essence Sph galaxies are bulgeless S0s
 Allan Sandage 2004 accused Sidney van den Bergh of hermeneutical circularity in setting up
his parallel-sequence classication which  he thought  involved too much interpretation A
prosaic but sucient paraphrase is circular reasoning The basic idea is this a morphological
classication of galaxies should be set up based only on observations and not on interpretation
see Section 134 The aim is that regularities revealed by the classication will later aid
interpretation However if some interpretation is used in setting up the classication then the
aid that the classication can provide is foreordained This is circular reasoning In practice
science is not as black and white as Sandage suggests Even the greatest scientists Sandage
explicitly picked Hubble as one of these set up classications with future interpretation in mind
They make decisions about which observations to treat as relevant and which ones to treat as
secondary Van den Bergh did this faithfully Sandage was just uneasy about how important
those decisions were It should be clear from these remarks that I respect both sides of the
argument In the end further advances reviewed here have I claim vindicated van den Berghs
decisions For a classication to be successful it must ultimately motivate a clearcut paradigm
of interpretation Van den Berghs parallel-sequence classication has done this
 This is to prevent confusion with cD galaxies which have cluster-sized debris halos not disks
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Observations that suggest parallel sequences of SIm and S0Sph galaxies
a For every BT ratio that is observed in an S0 or Sph galaxy there are S or
Im galaxies that have corresponding similar BT ratios We see a continuous
transition from S0 to E as BT  0 We do not know whether Sas also have
a continuous transition BT  0 The Sombrero galaxy NGC 4594 has one
of the largest bulge-to-total ratios known BT  093  001 Kormendy 
Bender 2013 I know no Sa with larger BT  Thus it is prudent to retain a
classication S00 that is intermediate between elliptical and both Sa and S0a
b Except for details such as spiral structure the global structure of spirals and
S0s is similar For any generic Sa Sb or Sc galaxy there are similar S0a S0b
or S0c galaxies In particular the bulges of spiral and S0 galaxies both satisfy
the E parameter correlations The fractions of classical and pseudo bulges are
similar at similar stages along the tuning fork Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004
And the disks of SIm galaxies have almost the same parameter correlations
as Sph galaxies and S0 disks Fig 171
c Some Sph galaxies contain low-contrast spiral structure therefore they contain
embedded disks Jerjen et al 2000 2001 Barazza et al 2002 De Rijcke et al
2003 Graham et al 2003 Ferrarese et al 2006 Lisker et al 2006 2007 2009
d Many dSph companions of our Galaxy contain intermediate-age stellar
populations Da Costa 1994 Mateo 1998 Fig 173 here Tolstoy et al 2009
Both among the Galaxys satellites and in the larger HST ACS Nearby Galaxy
Treasury Survey Weisz et al 2011a b dS dIm and dSph galaxies have
similar heterogeneous star formation histories except that the star formation
rate in dSph galaxies is currently zero This is a matter of denition  if a dwarf
contains gas and star formation it is called dSphdIm or dIm The Virgo
cluster contains several examples Ferrarese et al 2006 KB2012
Fig 173 Star formation histories of dSph and dIm galaxies from Mateo 1998
Relative star formation rates are shown as a function of time since the Big Bang
John Kormendy
e Similarly some spiral galaxies in clusters contain gas only near their centers
and some S0s contain near-central gas and small amounts of star formation
This is discussed in Section 179 Here it again means that some S0 galaxies
are less dierent from some spiral galaxies than optical images would suggest
f Van den Berghs 1976 anemic galaxies are omitted from Fig 172 for
simplicity but they are galaxies that are intermediate in properties between
spiral and S0 galaxies Their contain only low-amplitude spiral structure star
formation The transition from S to anemic to S0 looks continuous
Thus a substantial collection of morphological and structural parameter
observations motivate our suggested parallel-sequence galaxy classication
We revise it to place Sph galaxies at the end of the S0 sequence juxtaposed
with the latest-type spirals and irregulars
It is important to note three
things We do not intend to imply that the luminosity function of galaxies
is the same at all stages of the tuning fork Indeed we already know that
Im and Sph galaxies tend to have lower luminosities than earlier-type S
and S0 galaxies Second we do not mean to imply that galaxies are equally
abundant at every stage of either the SIm or the S0Sph sequence Indeed
it is clear that S0c galaxies are much rarer than Sphs or earlier-type S0s
This provides a hint for interpretation But it is not a reason to change the
classication And third we do not intend to x what isnt broken Our
suggestion of a parallel-sequence classication is not meant to replace Hubble
classes We propose Fig 172 as a complement to Hubble classication
useful because it encodes a dierent collection of observations that are
relevant to a dierent collection of questions about formation physics
178 Parallel-sequence classication and
bimodality in the galaxy color-magnitude relation
Work on galaxy formation nowadays concentrates on the history of star
formation in the Universe and on understanding stellar populations The
iconic observation that current work tries to explain is the color bimodality of
galaxies in the color-magnitude relation as revealed by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey SDSS at low redshifts Strateva et al 2001 Bernardi et al 2003
Kaumann et al 2003a b Hogg et al 2002 2004 Blanton et al 2003 2005
Baldry et al 2004 and by HST studies of galaxies at high redshifts Figure
174 shows this result and illustrates how the E  S0  Sph arm of the parallel-
sequence tuning fork relates to it The bright end of the prominent and thin
red sequence consists of ellipticals S0s and some early-type spirals But
their luminosity functions are bounded at low L When the red sequence is
extended fainter it must become dominated by Sphs at MV  18 The
deepest surveys detect this Blanton et al 2005 Drory et al 2009

Fig 174 Correspondence between our parallel-sequence classication and the color
bimodality of galaxies in the SDSS color-magnitude relation The top panel shows
contours of galaxy number density in the correlation between SDSS u  r color
and galaxy baryonic mass MM Baldry et al 2004 The narrow red sequence
of mostly-non-star-forming galaxies and the broader blue cloud of star-forming
galaxies are well known The bottom panel shows the morphological types from
Fig 172 that dominate in various parts of the top panel The rapidly rising
luminosity function of spheroidals at the low-mass limit of the diagram may account
for the contour in the top panel at 90 22 The take-home point is that the
bright end of the red sequence consists of ellipticals S0s and early-type spirals but
the faint end is dominated by Sph galaxies Adapted from KB2012
179 SIm  S0Sph galaxy transformation processes
The natural interpretation of the observations discussed in this section is
that S0 and Sph galaxies are defunct red and dead versions of spiral and
irregular galaxies that have been transformed by physical processes to be
discovered Most of these turn out to be environmentally driven and slow
The relative ordering and positioning of galaxies in the parallel-sequence
classication is justied on purely observational grounds based on choices of
which results to use in the classication and which to regard  for present
purposes  as secondary However it would be disingenuous to pretend that I
and many others have not been thinking about the underlying formation and
evolution processes for a long time This is inevitable in a world where no
observational curiosity goes uninterpreted for long In fact there are many
candidate processes Astronomers frequently argue about which of many
compelling theories are correct My experience is that these arguments go
on longest when everybody is correct This is one of those occasions
John Kormendy
Candidate SIm  S0Sph galaxy transformation processes are reviewed
in KB2012 Here I list them briey including only the most important
supporting observations
a The main internal evolution process was already mentioned in Section 173
Below a ducial mass that corresponds to Vcirc  100 km s1 i e just where
bulges disappear Fig 170 and therefore galaxy names get changed from S0 to
Sph Fig 169 supernova-driven winds are expected to expell a larger fraction
of a galaxys baryons from lower-mass objects regardless of whether they now
are irregular or spheroidal e g Larson 1974 Saito 1979 Dekel  Silk 1986
Vader 1986 Schaeer  Silk 1988 see Hensler et al 2004 Stinson et al 2007
for two among many more recent discussions This is why I suggested that
the decreasing surface brightnesses of Sph and Im galaxies at lower luminosities
Fig 171 is a baryon retention sequence
b The most thoroughly studied external transformation process is ram-pressure
stripping of cold gas by hot gas in clusters and perhaps groups of galaxies
Suggested by Gunn  Gott 1972 the idea has varied in popularity It has
never gained widespread acceptance perhaps in part because Dressler 1980
argued that it was not the main cause of the morphology-density relation
that spiral galaxies get less abundant whereas S0 galaxies get more abundant
at higher galaxy densities in clusters Dressler argued that this result
does not strongly depend on cluster richness However examination of his
Fig 8  10 see Fig 25 in KB2012 shows that the ratio of S0 to S galaxies
increases from low-concentration clusters to high-concentration clusters to
X-ray-emitting clusters
An alternative hypothesis is that ram-pressure
stripping happens more easily in clusters of all richness than simple energy
arguments suggest More recent results bear this out
Compelling evidence for ongoing ram-pressure stripping is provided by H
and H i observations of spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster Chung et al 2007
Kenney et al 2004 2008 Figure 175 shows some of these results Many
spiral galaxies embedded in the X-ray gas that lls the cluster center show
remarkable H i tails The above authors interpret them as cold gas that trails
behind the galaxy after having been stripped from the galaxy by the hot gas in
the cluster The spectacular H laments that point from the tidally disturbed
NGC 4438 toward the hot-gas-rich NGC 4406 top panel in Fig 175 are
similarly interpreted as ram-pressure stripped Also many spirals near the
center of the cluster are much smaller and more depleted in H i than are galaxies
in the cluster outskirts Cayatte et al 1990 Chung et al 2009 Kormendy 
Bender 2012 note that the three most depleted galaxies illustrated in Fig 8
of Chung et al 2009 are NGC 4402 NGC 4405 and NGC 4064 They have
a mean absolute magnitude MV  194  02 Virtually all Sphs are fainter

suer H i stripping then the shallow potential wells of dSIm galaxies are
more likely to be stripped Substantial additional evidence also suggests that
ram-pressure stripping is more eective than we thought see KB2012 and van
Gorkom  Kenney 2013 for reviews
Can ram-pressure stripping still happen in the Local Groups much shallower
gravitational potential well Compelling observations which indirectly suggest
that the answer is yes are shown in Fig 176 Close companions of our
Galaxy of M 31 and of other nearby giant galaxies are almost all spheroidals
distant companions are irregulars SphIm transition galaxies tend to live at
intermediate distances and larger irregulars survive at closer distances to
their giant companions Einasto et al 1974 van den Bergh 1994a b 2007
Mateo 1998 Skillman et al 2003 Bouchard et al 2009 McConnachie 2012
Hints of similar eects in larger satellites are seen in the Zurich Environmental
Study ZENS Cibinel et al 2012 Like previous authors Kormendy  Bender
suggest that ram-pressure stripping can happen even in environments that are
gentler than cluster centers It may be indirect evidence for a pervasive warm-
hot intergalactic medium WHIM Dave et al 2001 that is dicult to detect
directly but that may be enough to convert dwarf irregulars into spheroidals
All this evidence suggests that ram-pressure stripping is one of the processes
that transforms late-type gas-rich and star-forming galaxies into red and dead
S0 and Sph galaxies

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
c Galaxy harassment is a dynamical process that should operate wherever
objects orbit repeatedly through rapidly varying gravitational potential elds
especially in virialized clusters of galaxies with velocity dispersions that are
much larger than the internal velocities of galaxies
It is the cumulative
eect of many encounters with other galaxies and with the cluster potential
Simulations show that it strips outer mass heats disks and promotes gas inow
toward the center that presumably feeds star formation Moore et el 1996 1998
Lake et al 1998 A variant is tidal stirring of dwarf galaxies on elliptical orbits
around our Galaxy or M 31 Mayer et al 2001a b 2006 Kormendy  Bender
concur with the above authors in suggesting that harassment converts late-
type disks into spheroidals and more robust earlier-type spirals into hotter
systems that resemble S0s A benet of this picture is that inowing gas can
feed star formation this helps to explain why S0 disks and spheroidals  which
must fade substantially after star formations stops  do not have much lower
surface brightnesses than current versions of SIm progenitors see Ferguson 
Binggeli 1994 for a review of this problem Gravity is not negotiable Its eects
are clean It is encouraging how many observations can be tied together into a
coherent picture if harassment is one of the galaxy transformation processes
1 Dynamical heating plausibly explains why faint spheroidals are not at
why many bright spheroidals contain disks either observed directly when seen
edge-on or inferred from their spiral structure and why the outer parts of our
rosetta stone galaxies NGC 4762 NGC 4552 NGC 4638 and VCC 2048 are
vertically thick whereas their more robust inner parts are at
2 Sph and Im galaxies have similar distributions of axial ratios Ferguson
 Sandage 1989 Binggeli  Popescu 1995 The latter authors conclude
that there is no evidence for a dierence between the attening distributions
of nucleated dEN and classical giant Es However
in my experience
many SphN galaxies are atter than any elliptical NGC 4637 in Fig 165 and
VCC 2048 in Fig 10 of KB2012 are examples Ferguson  Sandage note that
The similarity of attenings of dE bright no N and Im types removes one
of the previous objections to the hypothesis that some dwarf ellipticals could
be stripped dIs The exact engineering needs further study but dynamical
heating added to the fact that the smallest galaxies are not at anyway provides
a promising way to explain the attening observations

harassment from individual galaxies In the Virgo cluster it is irregular and
still in the early stages of formation Mihos et al 2005 2009 Arnaboldi et al

of tidally liberated stars and disrupted galaxies Richstone 1976 Dressler 1979

it is dicult to see how the mere heating of smaller galaxies could be avoided

of huge size 10000 pc in diameter in the extreme and of very low surface
brightness of about 25 B mag arcsec2 at the center discovered by Sandage
 Binggeli 1984 are spheroidals that have been harassed almost to death
5 Anisotropic dynamical heating is a natural way to try to explain triaxial
and slowly rotating Sphs e g Bender  Nieto 1990 This idea is consistent
with the observation that the brightest Sphs are in many cases the most disky
and rapidly rotating ones However unusually violent encounter histories can
allow a small number of Sphs to be anisotropic even at the highest masses
6 Carefully engineered encounter histories can make Sph galaxies that have
kinematically decoupled subsystems even counterrotation of the harassed outer
parts with respect to the inner galaxy De Rijcke et al 2004 Gonzalez-Garca et
al 2005 Counterrotating systems are seen in VCC 510 Thomas et al 2006
d Starvation of continued infall of cold gas from the cosmological structure
hierarchy is frequently discussed as an SIm  S0Sph transformation process
e g Larson et al 1980 Balogh et al 2000 Bekki et al 2002 Boselli et al
2009 Absent such infall star formation at currently observed rates generally
uses up the available gas in a few Gyr Larson et al 1980 Boselli et al 2009
Given the observation that the center of the Virgo cluster and a fortiori the
centers of rich clusters of galaxies are dominated by hot gas e g Fig 175 it
is dicult to see how starvation can be avoided These are not environments
where low-density cold gas can survive to feed continued accretion onto galaxies
for billions of years after the cluster acquires a large velocity dispersion
Thus many processes 1 may explain the growing dark matter dominance
i e baryon deciency of lower-mass dwarf galaxies and 2 can potentially
transfrom SIm galaxies into S0Sph galaxies Kormendy  Bender 2012
emphasize that the relevant question is not Which one of these mechanisms
is correct It is How can you stop any of them from happening It seems
likely to us that all of the above processes matter
In this regard I conclude by emphasizing the following points
Most papers Boselli et al 2009 is an exception investigate one process
when they get into trouble explaining some particular observation they
conclude that this process is not the answer If all above processes happen
then there is more potential to understand all of the diagnostic observations
Theorists like to ask clean questions investigating one process at a time
There are good reasons for this But Nature does everything together
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Eventually we will have to do likewise if we expect to understand galaxy
evolution The hellishly complicated interplay of dierent processes is a
feature not a bug We cannot avoid this problem forever
Second one observation that is frequently cited to disfavor ram-pressure
stripping and strangulation is that bulges are systematically bigger in S0s
than in spirals e g Dressler 1980 But i small pseudobulges in late-
type spirals skew the distribution of S-galaxy bulges to smaller luminosities
if such galaxies are transformed before secular evolution has time to make
pseudobulges the result is a Sph not an S0 Then it will not be counted
among the S0s Also ii the distribution of S0 bulges is skewed toward high
luminosity by the frequent misclassication of the highest ellipticals as S0s
KFCB This happens because their high Sersic indices n  4 give them
a core-halo appearance that persuades classiers to call them S0s An
example is the elliptical galaxy NGC 4406 which is classied S0 by Sandage
 Tammann 1981 Similarly giant ellipticals are commonly classied S03
when they contain nuclear dust disks e g the elliptical NGC 4459 KFCB
iii When accurate bulge-disk decompositions are carried out the folklore
that S0 galaxies mostly have large bulges is not conrmed Among S0s
discussed in KFCB and in KB2012 about half have P BT  05 and
six have P BT 
 13 the value for the Sb galaxy M 31 Finally iv the
distribution of BT in the progenitor galaxies of any transformation process
is a strong function of environment  bulgeless disks are preferentially made
in the eld and merger remnants are preferentially made in clusters such
as Virgo Kormendy et al 2010 So eld spirals do not fairly sample the
potential progenitors of S0 galaxies in clusters
Another observation that is frequently cited to disfavor ram-pressure
stripping and strangulation is that S0s have higher surface brightnesses than
spirals Disk fading that follows the shutdown of star formation might lead
us to expect the opposite eect But Fig 171 shows little sign of such an
eect Note that the surface brightnesses of both S0 and spiral disks are
not corrected for inclination so they are treated in the same way However
internal absorption is important in spirals and not in S0s So internal-
absorption-corrected surface brightnesses of spiral galaxy disks would be
brighter than those of S0 disks Also harassment  like any eect that
rearranges angular momentum  persuades some gas to fall toward the center
and should increase the surface brightness there via star formation
Finally Kormendy  Bender 2012 point out that S  S0 transformation
does not require the removal of all gas nor the quenching of all star formation
Some S0s still contain gas especially molecular gas near their centers e g
Welch  Sage 2003 Sage  Wrobel 1989 Thronson et al 1989 Devereux
John Kormendy
 Young 1991 Young et al 1995 These S0s form stars The Virgo spirals
whose outer H i distributions are truncated have normal central molecular
gas content Kenney  Young 1986 We do not need to solve the problem
of removing all gas from the deepest parts of galaxy potential wells
It is clear that much work  much complicated work  is still needed on
the messy baryonic physics of galaxy evolution But I am encouraged to
think that the still unknown details of the various transformation processes
do not threaten our overall picture that at least some S0s and likely all Sph
galaxies are defunct spiral and irregular galaxies
1710 Environmental secular evolution 
An Idea Whose Time Has Come
Morphological observations such as those encoded in the parallel-sequence
classication of Fig 172 lead to the robust conclusion that many S0s are
closely related to spiral galaxies and that essentially all Sph galaxies are
closely related to the latest-type spirals and irregulars Figure 172 does not
directly tell us what that relationship is However in recent years rapidly
improving observations of transformation processes in action including H i
and H tails relatively recent star formation in dSph galaxies vertically
thick outer disks in interacting S0s and rosetta stone galaxies with both
S0 and Sph properties strongly imply that some or all of a collection of
environmental processes transform spiral and irregular galaxies into red and
dead S0 and spheroidal galaxies This happens especially in rich clusters
but small galaxies can suer transformation even in relatively quiescent
environments such as the Local Group Kormendy  Bender 2012 suggest
that environmental secular evolution is An Idea Whose Time Has Come
18 Toward a Comprehensive Picture of Galaxy Formation
This section ties together our standard picture of galaxy formation by
hierarchical clustering lectures by Shlosman Scoville Calzetti with our
Schools subject of secular evolution lectures by Athanassoula Binney
Buta Peletier van Gorkom and me For pedagogical reasons it is useful to
introduce this standard picture here Shlosman 2012 provides more detail
What is at stake for future work We have a formation paradigm
quantum density uctuations in non-baryonic dark matter form immediately
after the Big Bang and then get stretched by the expansion of the Universe
gravity drives hierarchical clustering that causes the uctuations to grow
separate collapse and form galaxy halos the baryons cool inside the halos
to form stars and visible galaxies Spirals form when halos accrete gas that
dissipates and forms disks Ellipticals form when galaxies collide and merge
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
then dynamical violence scrambles disks into ellipsoidal Es This picture
is well supported by theory and observations What are the remaining
puzzles  the cracks in the paradigm They are short-cuts to progress
First what is understood Hierarchical clustering of dark matter initial
density uctuations is nowadays calculated in exquisite detail Fig 177
Results are in excellent agreement with observations of large-scale structure
Our job is illustrated in Fig 178 Hierarchical clustering of dark matter is
well understood background image More tricky is the physics of baryonic
galaxy formation within dark halos It is possible that all remaining problems
with our formation picture on galaxy scales are problems of baryonic physics
Fig 177 The Millennium Simulation Springel et al 2005 is the iconic example of
an n-body calculation of the formation of large-scale and galaxy-sized structures via
hierarchical clustering of primordial quantum density uctuations that have been
stretched by the expansion of the Universe and increased in contrast by self-gravity
John Kormendy
The good news is that ellipticals are fairly well understood Simulations
of the hierarchical growth of galaxies suggest that they change back and
forth between spiral and elliptical depending on whether their recent history
was dominated by a major merger or by cold gas dissipation Fig 179
Todays students did not live through the revolution in our understanding
that resulted from Toomres 1977a introduction of mergers to our lexicon
of galaxy formation I therefore review this subject briey
The rst bad news is that we do not know how to form bulgeless galaxies
Continued bulge growth is inherent to the story in Fig 179 Once you have
a bulge you cannot get rid of it This problem was reviewed in Section 161
The other bad news is that galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering of
cold dark matter still has problems on the size scales of individual galaxies
Reviews of the subject run the gamut from very optimistic Primack 2004
to sober Silk  Mamon 2012 to very pessimistic Kroupa 2012 This is a
sign of a subject in ux  of cracks in the paradigm These are opportunities
The comfortable news is that we have a growing understanding of secular
evolution in disk galaxies It happens now in low- and intermediate-density
environments But nding pseudobulges in Virgo S0s shows that it had time
to happen even in the progenitor environments of some present-day clusters
Fig 178 Theme of building a comprehensive picture of galaxy formation by
studying the physics of baryonic galaxies as embedded in the dark matter hierarchy
represented here by the Millennium Simulation High-density environments are
dominated by merger remnants  giant ellipticals in rich clusters We understand
them fairly well Low-density environments are dominated by pure-disk galaxies
such as M 101 we do not understand how they form Bulge-dominated spirals like
the Sombrero live in intermediate environments Barred and other galaxies that
undergo secular evolution also tend to live in intermediate-density environments
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies

the most massive progenitor at z  4 it already contains both old stars and a gas
disk In panel b a classical bulge forms in a major merger at z  3 and then
regrows a disk by later infall of cold gas Panel c at z  18 the galaxy looks
like an early-type spiral with a dense bulge surrounded by a young disk Panel
d At z  16 tidal forcing by a companion shown in the z  12 image triggers
a bar The satellite is accreted at z  118 but the bar prominent in the young
component survives for several more Gyr Panel e At z  07 the galaxy merges
with another galaxy that has about half of its mass The result is an elliptical
galaxy at z  027 This could accrete more gas and form a Sombrero-galaxy-like
system but it cannot get rid of its large bulge
John Kormendy
181 Formation of ellipticals by major galaxy mergers
It is hard to describe to todays students what a revelation it was when
Alar Toomre 1977a presented his hypothesis that all ellipticals are created
from progenitor disk galaxies by the dynamical violence of galaxy collisions
and mergers The feeling had been that stars are too small to collide so
interacting galaxies merely pass through each other We missed two points
First tidal eects are easily strong enough to scramble cold rotating disks
into dynamically hot ellipticals Doing this work takes energy out of the
orbits and soon causes the galaxies to merge Second large and massive halos
of dark matter surround visible galaxies and give them much bigger collision
cross sections than we thought when we saw only the visible stars It is no
accident that the merger picture became established soon after we realized
that dark matter is real Faber  Gallagher 1979 Mergers-in-progress turn
out to explain a whole zoo of previously mysterious peculiar galaxies e g
Figs 180  182 Toomres suggestion that mergers make all ellipticals is as
far as we know exactly correct And Toomres 1980 additional hypothesis
that mergers make classical bulges robustly looks to be exactly correct too

gravitational encounters Such encounters explain most objects in e g Arps

Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
I was in the audience for Toomres 1977a talk we all remember it as a
historic moment But not everyone was immediately captured by the new
ideas and I confess that I was a partial agnostic for longer than most
Kormendy 1989 was a late paper that tried to keep merger enthusiasm from
getting out of control Its point is still correct  the sequence of increasing
density in smaller ellipticals Fig 168 is a sequence of increasing dissipation
with accompanying starbursts during formation As emphasized all along
by Toomre merger progenitors generally contain gas crunching gas likes to
make stars and so star formation is an integral part of spiral-spiral mergers
By  1990 we understood that ultraluminous IRAS galaxies ULIRGS
are prototypical dissipative mergers in progress Joseph  Wright 1985

Central to the rapid acceptance of the merger picture was the extensive
observational evidence for mergers in progress that was published by
Francois Schweizer e g 1978 1980 1982 1987 1996 Figure 182 shows
the particularly convincing example if NGC 7252 the atoms for peace
galaxy
It has both diagnostic tidal tails and ripples or shells in
the light distribution that trace edge-on caustics of wrapped former disks
Shells too became standard merger diagnostics Malin  Carter 1980 1983
Schweizer  Seitzer 1988 Shells are seen in absorption as well as in stars an
example of the explanation of a previously mysterious peculiar galaxy as an
S0 that contains an accreted and now phase-wrapped dust disk is NGC 4753
Steiman-Cameron et al 1992 The correlation that stronger ne structure
such as shells is seen in ellipticals with younger stellar populations bluer
colors and stronger H absorption lines further supported the merger
picture and lled in the evolution time sequence between mergers in progress
and old completely relaxed and phase-mixed ellipticals Carter et al 1988
Fig 182 NGC 7252 is another prototypical merger-in progress that is making
an elliptical galaxy Schweizer 1982 Two tidal tails that point in roughly
opposite directions and that have opposite velocity dierences with respect to the
systemic velocity are the simplest diagnostic signature of a merger in progress
see the seminal paper by Toomre  Toomre 1972 The essential point is that
dynamical clocks run most slowly at the largest radii so remnant tidal tails persist
long after the main bodies of interacting galaxies have merged For H i observations
and n-body models of NGC 7252 see Hibbard et al 1994 1995 1996
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
Schweizer et al 1990 Schweizer  Seitzer 1992 Compelling further support
was provided both by detailed H i observations e g Hibbard et al 1994
1995 1996 2001a b  see httpwwwnraoeduastroresHIrogues and
especially by n-body simulations the master of the art is Josh Barnes
1988 1989 1992 Simulations further conrmed that mergers dump huge
amounts of gas to galaxy centers thereby feeding starbursts e g Barnes 
Hernquist 1991 1992 1996 Mihos  Hernquist 1994 Hopkins et al 2009a
By the time of the reviews of Schweizer 1990 1998 Barnes  Hernquist
1992 Kennicutt 1998c and Barnes 1998 the merger revolution in our
understanding of elliptical galaxies was a done deal
A variant of the merger picture involves the observation that many high-z
galaxies are dominated by 108  109 M kpc-size star forming clumps
e g Elmegreen et al 2005 2007 2008a 2009a b Bournaud et al 2007
Genzel et al 2008 Forster Schreiber et al 2009 Tacconi et al 2010
Bournauds galaxy UDF 1668 Fig 183 is remarkably similar to the initial
conditions used by van Albada 1982 to simulate the collapse of lumpy
initial conditions He showed Fig 183 here that relatively gentle collapses
produce Sersic-function proles with n  2  4 like those in real classical
bulges e g Fisher  Drory 2008 This is conrmed in modern n-body
merger simulations e g Hopkins et al 2009a
Fig 183 Mergers of two galaxies that consist mostly of stars make Sersic 1968
function remnants with indices n  2  4 An early illustration of this is van Albada
1982 whose initial conditions look remarkably similar to the clumpy high-z galaxy
UDF 1666 studied by Bournaud et al 2007
It is an example of the clump
instability picture discussed by Elmegreen et al 2008b Van Albadas initial
conditions were parameterized by the ratio of twice the total kinetic energy to
the negative of the potential energy In virial equilibrium 2T W  1 For smaller
values van Albada found that gentle collapses 2T W  05 make Sersic proles
with n  4 whereas violent collapses 2T W 
 4 This is a sign that
the clumps discussed by Elmegreen et al 2008b merge to make classical bulges
 02 make n 
John Kormendy
Elmegreen et al 2008b model gas-rich galaxy disks in the early Universe
and nd that they violently form clumps like those observed Fig 184 The
clumps quickly merge and make a high-Sersic-index bulge It rotates slowly
Rotation velocities decrease with increasing distance from the disk plane So
these are classical bulges and this is a variant on the merger picture From
many colorful conversations with Allan Sandage I suspect that he would
have welcomed this ELS with lumps picture ELS  Eggen et al 1962
Fig 184 A variant of the merger picture involves high-z disks that are unstable
to the formation of large clumps which quickly merge to form a classical bulge It
has ellipsoidal not cylindrical rotation bottom From Elmegreen et al 2008b
Secular Evolution in Disk Galaxies
182 Mergers and secular evolution both happen in a
hierarchically clustering Universe
It is impossible to remove the problem of galaxy formation from its
cosmological context of hierarchical clustering Jones 1992 Begun in
papers like White  Rees 1978 our picture of hierarchical clustering has
reached a remarkable level of sophistication The Millenniumm Simulation
is one example from a vast literature I want to emphasize again that the
merger formation of elliptical galaxies that was discussed in Section 181
the secular evolution of disk galaxies that was discussed in Sections 12  16
and the environmental secular evolution that was discussed in Section 17
all happen within the cosmological context of hierarchical clustering Much
work remains to be done in connecting the story of galaxy formation on the
kpc scales of most studies of individual galaxies with the Mpc scales where
n-body dark matter simulations are at their best Current work is dominated
by the complicated physics of baryons including the eects of reionization
dissipation star formation energy feedback and active galactic nuclei We
like to think that galaxies are mature objects and that our job is to study
galaxy evolution to see how they got that way But  23 of the baryons in
the Universe do not yet live in galaxies or have not yet cooled and formed
stars e g Fukugita et al 1998 Dave et al 2001 Read  Trentham 2005
Galaxy formation is much less nished than we like to think Our job is
far from nished too For all of us students of galaxies this is good news
