Abstract
I outline a quantitative method for characterizing galaxies both by photometric
form and indices of spectral-type applicable to both nearby and distant galaxies
Such a characterization provides insight on galaxy evolution because there are phys-
ical connections between galaxies stellar populations and their light distribution
Normal galaxies form-parameters surface-brightness image concentration and
asymmetry correlate well with spectral-index color which in turn correlates only
weakly with scale size or luminosity Deviations from these normal relations also
oer clues to the physical modes of galaxy formation and evolution As an example I
contrast a puzzling distant population of compact but luminous blue star-forming
galaxies to nearby samples These distant sources appear to be associated with the
bulk of the luminosity increase since z  1 They have structural properties compa-
rable to low-redshift populations and photometric properties within the norm for
nearby actively star-forming galaxies When combined however their photometric
and structural properties appear to be highly unusual

1 Classication and Evolution
While great strides recently have been made in identifying galaxies out
to very large look-back times eg Steidel et al 1999 when galaxies
form and how they evolve is still an issue of debate The primary phys-
ical processes determining a galaxys appearance are the aggregation of
matter and the ensuing star-formation stellar evolution and chemical
enrichment  all within the dynamical development of a gravitating
system It is possible and compelling to model these processes and
predict how galaxies appear a priori eg Contardo et al 1998 Our
limited understanding of the feed-back mechanisms associated with
and controlling star formation make such simulations challenging In
a complementary approach the specic form and time-scales of these
physical processes eg monolithic collapse vs merging of bound sys-
tems dissipation vs violent relaxation and monotonic vs stochastic
star-formation histories may be dierentiable within an observational
framework Sandage 1986 outlined how the Hubble sequence today
can be interpreted in terms of dierent monolithic collapse and star-
formation histories The interpretation however is not unique in hi-
erarchical structure-formation scenarios dierent inferences are drawn

for how disks and spheroids form eg van den Bausch 1998 With a
multiplicity of evolutionary paths to a single current galaxy type an
observational approach to dierentiating between these paths is desir-
able Since the ability to measure change relies on making a comparison
between galaxies at disparate distances classication is a cornerstone
of galaxy evolution studies
To proceed observationally a framework is needed which takes ad-
vantage of current knowledge For example there is a fundamental
connection between stellar populations and local galaxies structure
known since Baades study of on our own galaxy and the bulge of M31
Simply interpreted bulges are spatially compact nearly spherical dy-
namically warm Vrot  1 systems composed of old cool stars disks
are dynamically cold Vrot  1 more diuse and the sites of recent
massive star-formation This simple picture belies a much more complex
entanglement of stellar populations eg King 1971 and more varied
dynamical and structural properties of disks and bulges Nonetheless
large galaxies today have discernibly dierent spatial and dynamical
distributions of stellar populations These dierences are evolutionary
clues which can be exploited
Here we consider the following physically motivated classication
scheme to be applied to galaxies over a range of look-back times The
amount of dissipation in bound luminous matter is inferred directly
by measuring image concentration and surface-brightness Time-scales
for star formation and matter aggregation are assessed independently
via characterization of stellar populations gradients changes in galaxy
scales and asymmetry Concentration surface-brightness asymmetry
color and luminosity or size then compose at least part of a critical
subset of the classication tools necessary for studying galaxy evolu-
tion Together they are sensitive to the temporal change in the spatial
distribution of star-formation
Such a classication scheme sounds remarkably similar to that pro-
posed over years ago by Morgan  Mayall 1957 They reformulated
the concept of galaxy classication set forth by Hubble two decades
earlier and made stellar populations the primary classication pa-
rameter This departure allowed Morgan 1958 to discover that the
spectral-type of galaxies nuclear regions correlated strongly with im-
age concentration This is essentially the inverse of Hubble noting
that color correlated with morphological type but here in more phys-
ical terms of stellar densities and populations Nonetheless image
structure morphology or form remained an essential secondary pa-
rameter in Morgans classication This indicates the importance of
both form and spectral-type as independent classication axes

A Framework for Measuring Evolution
Form and spectral-indices1 are now being explored in exquisite detail
with modern data-sets there has been much recent progress in placing
galaxy classication on a secure quantitative footing eg these pro-
ceedings and references therein Most of these explorations however
have stayed within the context of the Hubble classication scheme
or consider either form or spectral-indices in isolation Conselice et
al 2000 and Jangren et al 1999 recently have demonstrated how
modern measures of form and spectral-indices can be used powerfully in
concert Whitmore 1984 long ago pointed the way His two dominant
dimensions are form disk-to-bulge ratio and color and scale size
and color Whitmores analysis based on local luminous spirals mixes
what we term here as form and spectral parameters To develop a
classication for both nearby and distant samples we deliberately want
to separate these parameters from each other and from scale and then
determine how correlations between them evolve
Indeed a crucial facet of classication is the ability to incorporate
galaxies of all scales mass size and luminosity in a physically intel-
ligible way Can late-type galaxies with neither well-formed disks nor
bulges but characteristically low luminosities be classied sensibly via
form and spectral-indices alone One distinguishing physical parameter
here is the ratio of the current to past-average star-formation rate It
should be possible to measure this parameter not only spectroscopically
eg color but via form through the amplitude of HII regions occu-
lence or high-frequency asymmetry relative to a smooth underlying
stellar population Hence there is promise that form and color can be
used to distinguish at least between active and quiescent dwarf galax-
ies and certainly between the majority of dwarfs and giants observed
locally Determining how such distinctions become distorted at higher
redshift gains us insight into how galaxies evolve
In the balance of this paper I sketch some of the principal dimensions
of the classication motivated above and demonstrate their utility for
understanding the nature of compact luminous galaxies observed at
intermediate redshifts
2 A Modern Revision of Morgans Classication Scheme
There are numerous ways to dene measures of form spectral-index
and scale What is presented here is not unique but the parameters
1 While Morgan intentionally dened galaxy nuclear spectral-type within the
paradigm of classical stellar classication this may not be suited ideally for a general
galaxy classication eg admixtures of hot and cool stellar components must be
characterized nuclear spectra may unobtainable or poorly dened For clarity we
henceforth refer to other measures of galaxy spectral-type as spectral-indices

that a there is a strong correlation in the mean between color and luminosity for
all galaxies but a large range of luminosity for a given color b while LBCGs are
among the most luminous galaxies for their luminosity they are not exceptional as
a class when compared to a general eld population at low redshift
have been chosen to be robust to changes in signal-to-noise and image
resolution and are cost-eective in terms of the required telescopic
observations relative to delivered information Specically we use
1 A spatially-integrated spectral-index or stellar population param-
eter ideally measured via optical and near-infrared multi-colors or
spectra but rest-frame B  V can be used as a low-cost surrogate
2 Form parameters concentration C surface-brightness  and
asymmetry A as measured in a single rest-frame band
3 Scale parameters size r and luminosity L  these should not
be viewed as identical since there is a range of surface-brightness
at any given r or L Ideally a kinematic measure of mass would be
added as a third independent scale parameter
Figures 1-3 illustrate selected correlations between the above pa-
rameters for two samples that we use to form a reference-set of nearby
galaxies i the Frei et al 1996 sample as studied by Conselice
et al 2000 and Jangren et al 1999 and ii the somewhat more
distant z  013 photometric sample from Bershady 1995 The
latter contains a substantial number of low-redshift low-luminosity
actively star-forming systems but has no measured form-parameters

centration vs B  V  Dashed lines are heuristic classication boundaries analogous

The Frei et al sample like most  if not all  bright galaxy sam-
ples is unrepresentative of the number and variety of low-luminosity
and small systems Consequently the reference distribution of form-
parameters based here only on the Frei et al sample should be viewed
as preliminary To amend this we are in the process of measuring form-
parameters for other samples containing nearby star-forming dwarfs
Here we schematically indicate the locus of dwarf ellipticalsspheroidals
in Figures 2 and 3 as compiled by Jangren et al 1999 and references
therein Finally we have included an intermediate redshift sample of
what we will term luminous blue compact galaxies LBCGs
Focusing rst on nearby samples the following correlations are
apparent Spectral-index and luminosity are well correlated Figure 1
but there is a substantial range in luminosity for a given type color
The form parameters correlate strongly with spectral-index Figure
2 moderately well with each other Figure 3 but very weakly with
scale NB only large r and L probed here To complete this suite
of gures see eg Okamura et al 1984 or Kent 1985 for  vs c
Conselice et al 2000 for A vs B  V  and Jangren et al 1999
for form vs scale While form and spectral-index together distinguish
well between normal Hubble types form-parameters alone are not as
good  particularly for separating intermediate and late Hubble types
In other words the dominant dierence between intermediate and late
types as dened by the Hubble sequence is color
We note that while we are considering  to be a form parameter
it contains a hidden luminosity scale This scale becomes evident if
for example the time-scales for size evolution is much larger than for
changes in the characteristic ML a galaxys stellar population Asym-

metry and image concentration may also be aected by evolution but
only by dynamical changes or spatially-dependent variations in star-
formation  is guaranteed to evolve even in a dynamically relaxed and
uniform stellar system Hence it is important to keep in mind that
evolution may drive dierent changes in A c and 
3 Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies
A particularly intriguing distant population consists of small but lu-
minous blue star-forming galaxies found in a number of deep redshift
surveys What we dene as LBCGs Jangren et al 1999 contain the
smallest galaxies for their observed luminosity eg Koo et al 1994
Guzman et al 1997 and Lilly et al 1998 have argued that these
sources appear to be the most rapidly evolving in terms of space-
density and hence are likely to be associated with if not a key com-
ponent of the observed increase in star-formation between 0  z  1
How do they t in to the above classication scheme
As seen in Figure 2 the LBCGs lie o the reference sequence when
viewed by form and spectral-index However their opticalnear-IR col-
ors and luminosities are within the upper bounds established for nearby
eld samples Figure 1 In terms of form-parameters alone Figure 3
the LBCGs are extreme in A vs  but not in terms of A vs c
Because our reference sample is incomplete it is problematic to
assess how unusual the LBCGs are in form Nonetheless the most lumi-
nous and compact LBCGs a sub-class which we refer to as CNELGs

do appear to be unusual even when compared to their slightly larger
counterparts SBGs of comparable rest-frame color and redshift z 
04 Figure 4 reveals color gradients roughly between rest-frame U
and J bands such that the most compact sources are bluer in their
centers indicative of young centrally concentrated bursts embedded
within older more extended populations The slightly more extended
sources like nearby normal galaxies show the characteristic reddening
in their centers due to the increasing relative dominance of the bulge
The most extreme LBCGs then show the opposite correlation between
form and stellar type exhibited by galaxies along the Hubble sequence 
ie in opposition to the underlying premise of our classication scheme
How might these sources individually evolve Are there local coun-
terparts To start the LBCGs color gradients allow us to conclude that
the intermediate-z bursts are not their rst More dicult to ascertain
is whether these sources a persist in or oscillate into and out of the lu-
minous blue phase via recurring bursts or b burst once or twice and
then fade into obscurity Certainly the stellar fossil record from the local
group Grebel 1998 Tolstoy 1998 is consistent with multiple burst
phases for dwarfs However do the LBCGs have adequate gas to sustain
signicant future bursts This critical question could be answered by
identifying comparable systems within redshift range of HI observations
z  015 If these sources have no subsequent bursts and simply fade
their image structure will evolve to become less concentrated lower
surface-brightness and more symmetric As in previous photometric
analysis Guzman et al 1998 Jangren et al 1999 nd the faded
colors and form of the LBCGs are still consistent with some of todays
spheroidal population eg NGC 205
Finally we would like to understand the origin of the centrally-
concentrated star-formation in these systems it appears as if they
are forming outside-in How was the gas which formed these stars
funneled into the central 1-2 kpc There are tails and wisps in these
systems indicative of interactions or merging but the bursts are large
L luminosities may contain as much as 10 of the total stellar
mass and the total mass appears to be small M 1010M based
on sizes and narrow line-widths STIS spectroscopy or high-angular
resolution integral-eld spectroscopy would be invaluable to determine
if the most extreme LBCGs are rotationally supported truly low mass
dynamically disturbed or are suering from super-novae driven winds
that may rid them of their ISM and quench future star-formation
