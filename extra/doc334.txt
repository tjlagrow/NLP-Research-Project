ABSTRACT
We examine the impact of using photometric redshifts for studying the evolution
of both the global galaxy luminosity function LF and that for dierent galaxy types
To this end we compare the LFs obtained using photometric redshifts from the CFHT
Legacy Survey CFHTLS D1 eld with those from the spectroscopic survey VIMOS
VLT Deep Survey VVDS comprising 4800 galaxies We nd that for z  20 in the
interval of magnitudes considered by this survey the LFs obtained using photometric
and spectroscopic redshifts show a remarkable agreement This good agreement led
us to use all of the four Deep elds of the CFHTLS comprising 386000 galaxies to
compute the LF of the combined elds and estimate directly the error in the parameters
based on the eld-to-eld variation We nd that the characteristic absolute magnitude
M  of Schechter ts fades by  07 mag from z  18 to z  03 while the character-
istic density  increases by a factor of  4 in the same redshift interval We use the
galaxy classication provided by the template tting program used to compute photo-
metric redshifts and split the sample into galaxy types We nd that these Schechter
parameters evolve dierently for each galaxy type an indication that their evolution is
a combination of several eects galaxy merging star formation quenching and mass as-
sembly All these results are compatible with those obtained by dierent spectroscopic
surveys such as VVDS DEEP2 and zCosmos which reinforces the fact that photometric
redshifts can be used to study galaxy evolution at least for the redshift bins adopted so
far This is of great interest since future very large imaging surveys containing hundreds
of millions of galaxies will allow to obtain important precise measurements to constrain
the evolution of the LF and to explore the dependence of this evolution on morphology
andor color helping constrain the mechanisms of galaxy evolution

Introduction
The galaxy luminosity function or number density of galaxies as a function of their luminosity
is a fundamental property of the galaxy distribution as it provides information on how visible mat-
ter is distributed among galaxies of various luminosities at a given epoch Therefore its evolution
can be used to constrain models of galaxy evolution and structure formation Benson et al 2003
In order to set tight constraints on these models one would ideally divide galaxies into a variety of
subgroups and derive independent luminosity functions that are known to vary signicantly with
respect to several physical parameters such as redshift color galaxy type star formation rate etc
With the advent of very large and deep galaxy surveys this has become possible leading to a large
number of works eg Faber et al 2007 Christlein et al 2009 Zucca et al 2009 However in
order to benet from large homogeneous and complete samples in most cases one has to rely only
on the photometric information with at most a partial spectroscopic coverage
While the local luminosity function has been extensively studied due to numerous spectroscopic
surveys carried out over the years Marzke et al 1994 Marzke  da Costa 1997 Marzke et al
1998 Folkes et al 1999 Blanton et al 2001 Madgwick et al 2002 probing its evolution to high
redshifts still represents a challenge One possible way of doing that is to take advantage of the
recent multi-band photometric surveys such as the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey
CFHTLS and use the photometric redshift technique to estimate distances The purpose of this
paper is to show that this is in fact possible at least using the redshift bins here adopted yielding
reliable results This is demonstrated using the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey VVDS data and one
of the Deep elds of CFHTLS Based on this nding we use all CFHTLS Deep elds to compute a
combined luminosity function and estimate the cosmic variance on their tted Schechter parameters
at dierent redshifts Finally we use the information provided by the template tting routine used
to estimate the photometric redshift to split the sample into galaxy types and compare with the
few results available in the literature This is relevant to investigate how reliable this approach
can be to explore the data that will eventually become public for surveys such as the Dark Energy
Survey DES and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope LSST
In Section 2 of this paper the details on the method used to compute the luminosity function
are discussed The data used is briey described in Section 3
In Section 4 the results of the
comparison of the luminosity functions computed using spectroscopic and photometric redshifts
are presented In this section we also show the evolution of the luminosity function derived for
the combined sample comprising all galaxies and split into dierent galaxy types which are then
compared with the results of other authors We present a summary of our conclusions in Section 5
Throughout this paper the cosmology used is m  03   07 and results are expressed
in terms of h  H0100

2 Estimating the Luminosity Function
The luminosity function M dM  expressing the number of galaxies with absolute magnitudes
in the interval M and M dM per unit volume is calculated in intervals of redshift using the 1Vmax
method Schmidt 1968 Thus a galaxy of absolute magnitude M at redshift z contributes to the
luminosity function with weight 1Vmax where Vmax is the maximum volume within which the
galaxy apparent magnitude is found between the catalog apparent magnitude limits also bounded
by the redshift bin limits
The absolute magnitudes are calculated as
M  m  25  5logDL  K
where m is the apparent magnitude of the galaxy the luminosity distance is given by DL  1zr
where r is the comoving distance in h1M pc K is the K-correction for the shift of the observed
spectrum with relation to rest frame reference band wavelength and width In this work we deal
only with the i-band in the AB photometric system so M stands for MiAB and no correction for
intrinsic dust reddening was performed
Our source for K-corrections is the code Le Phare which was run with spectral energy distri-
butions SEDs from Coleman et al 1980 with the addition of 8 SEDs from Kinney et al 1996
Ilbert et al 2006 These K-corrections are shown in Figure 1 and they are calculated for each
galaxy based on the best tting SED
In the following analysis we t the usual Schechter 1976 function
M dM  04 ln 1010041M M  
e1004M 
where M  is the characteristic absolute magnitude and  is the normalization factor Fits for
the Schechter function were performed by a least square method using the Marquardt-Levenberg
algorithm with M   and  as free parameters
3 Data
In this work we used photometric data from the four Deep elds of the CFHTLS from ob-
servations made with the MegaCam camera at the CFHT Each eld D1 D2 D3 and D4 covers
 1 square degree and was observed in the u g r i and z bands Table 1 presents general
information
The CFHTLS-D1 eld is particularly interesting for this work since it has both photometric
and spectroscopic observations from VVDS Photometry in the VVDS was carried out using B V 
 4 
R I lters Ilbert et al 2006 and additional photometric data in the J and K bands are available
from Iovino et al 2005 The spectra were obtained with the VIMOS spectrograph at the VLT
for objects selected in the range 175  IAB  240 Le Fevre et al 2005 yielding a total of 6582
galaxies We used only good quality spectroscopic redshifts quality ags 2 3 and 4 to z  2
reducing the sample to 4813
In this analysis we used the color catalogs processed by Terapix1 for all four Deep Fields
version T0003 but with a dierent set of updated masks produced by one of the authors CB
to cover defective regions and those surrounding very bright stars This was performed in two
steps rst by creating automatic polygons centered on stars brighter than i190 with a shape
including diraction spikes and a size scaled to the star magnitudes second by correcting by hand
these polygons in the case of the brightest stars that show large ghosts and by adding polygons
to mask remaining defects such as satellite trails From these catalogs we selected only objects
classied as galaxies by the Terapix group from a morphological criterion based on their location in
a compactness radius containing 50 of the total ux -magnitude distribution see Terapix site1
and located outside masked regions in order to avoid objects with contaminated magnitudes The
photometric redshifts we use are those provided in these catalogs calculated by the Le Phare code
which is based on a template tting method and improved by an empirical training set which
reduces the dispersion z1z from 0047 to 0029 Only galaxies with available magnitudes in
at least three bands had photometric redshifts determined The process to calculate such redshifts
is described in detail in Ilbert et al 2006 and was conducted by the Terapix and VVDS teams
AB  24 and z  13 we nd i
We choose the i band as the one dening the samples in this work since it is the closest to
that I-band dening the VVDS sample Comparing i
AB CFHTLS and IAB VVDS magnitudes
down to i
AB  IAB 011016 Due to this small dierence we took
for the i band the same values for the magnitude limit as the one in the I-band Thus whenever
we analyzed data from the CFHTLS individual elds and specially to compare the results with
the VVDS survey we used the limits 175  i
AB  240 also restraining the analysis to z  20
When analyzing the sample from the combination of the four CFHTLS areas we extended these
limits to 175  i
AB  250 corresponding to a 80 completeness level Ilbert et al 2005
For a sample with magnitude limit of i
AB  24 as in this work it is still possible to probe
the faint end of the luminosity function at z  1 and determine a reliable value for  when tting
the Schechter function Due to the lack of good sampling of faint objects at higher redshifts we
x the value of  usually for z  10 to that obtained in a previous bin where  is more reliably
determined
In the analysis of the following sections we subdivide the samples in individual CFHTLS
elds in redshift intervals 005-02 02-04 04-06 06-08 08-10 10-13 and 13-20 as
used by Ilbert et al 2005 When analyzing the combined sample of four elds the last intervals

considered are 13-16 and 16-20 Table 2 presents the number of galaxies in each redshift bin
for each sample analyzed in this work
We discard galaxies with large i-band magnitude errors 030 mag and photometric redshift
errors z  05z This process discards 30 of the galaxies in the redshift bin 005-02 less
than 1 in the bin 02-04 and a negligible amount in more distant bins The total number of
galaxies in the four CFHTLS Deep elds resulting from all these selections mentioned above is
385910 objects
4 Results
41 Photometric versus Spectroscopic Redshifts
In order to check how well photometric redshifts reproduce the luminosity function obtained
with spectroscopic redshifts we selected a sample of galaxies from the CFHTLS-D1 eld in common
with the VVDS area with both spectroscopic and photometric redshift determinations We call this
data the Spectroscopic Sample We note that photometric redshifts for eld D1 were obtained in the
CFHTLS from all available magnitudes which means that for many galaxies of this Spectroscopic
Sample typically 5 to 9 lters were used
Luminosity functions were calculated in dierent redshift intervals and Schechter ts were ob-
tained The derived M  and  are presented in Table 3 results obtained using both spectroscopic
zspec and photometric zphot redshifts while the luminosity functions and their Schechter ts
are shown in Figure 2 We note that these functions are not representative of a fair galaxy sample
since we do not apply the corrections for sampling biases and redshift determination eciency rate
as described by Ilbert et al 2005 Nevertheless since our primary goal is to compare luminosity
functions derived with zphot and zspec for the same set of objects the fact that both functions are
not fair representations is not relevant and they are computed only to evaluate their dierences in
M  and  These dierences are shown in Figure 3
At small redshifts 005  z  02 the uncertainties are large and might reect the small
number of galaxies in this bin see Table 2 which prevents a reliable determination of M  and 
At higher redshifts the results show a remarkable agreement indicating that photometric redshifts
reproduce the spectroscopic results
42 Combining the CFHTLS Deep Fields
We also calculate the luminosity function for all galaxies in the VVDS area using photomet-
ric redshifts and compare the characteristic parameters with those derived spectroscopically by
Ilbert et al 2005 yielding a good agreement between both results However as shown below the
 6 
availability of four CFHTLS areas similar in size can be used to improve the statistics concerning
this comparison as well as to investigate and quantify the dierences due to cosmic variance at
the  07 eective square degree scale Dierently from eld D1 photometric redshifts for elds
D2 D3 and D4 were obtained from the set of lters u g r i and z We estimate that for
the combined four CFHTLS elds 76 of the objects had zphot calculated with at least these ve
lters Moreover as shown by Ilbert et al 2006 the inclusion of the BVRIJK magnitudes for
galaxies in the CFHTLS-D1 eld reduces the number of catastrophic events at z  13 due to the
J and K bands but reduces z1z from 0029 to 0026 As discussed by Ilbert et al 2006
this is the larger eect of including the additional VVDS lters and the J and K bands These
authors also conclude that the accuracy of the photometric redshifts decreases toward fainter ap-
parent magnitudes and although half of the objects with catastrophic errors are those classied as
starburst the redshift accuracy is approximately independent of type
The derived luminosity functions and respective Schechter ts for each CFHTLS eld are pre-
sented in Figure 4 for dierent redshift bins Characteristic parameters M   and  of Schechter
ts are presented in Table 4 Although there is a general good agreement systematic dierences
are seen among the elds showing that cosmic variance is present in samples determined at the
07 deg2 scale In order to increase the number of objects in each redshift bin and minimize cosmic
variance we merged the samples of the four elds in a single combined CFHTLS sample The
luminosity functions and their Schechter ts in each redshift bin as well as the magnitude range
used for tting are shown in Figure 5 while M   and  are presented in Table 5
We note two features from Figure 5 One is that with photometric redshifts it is possible to infer
the apparent non-linear shape of the faint end of the luminosity functions seen at redshifts z  06
It is tempting to identify an upturn of the function before the incompleteness cut in the closest
redshift bins There is still a lot of discussion in the literature concerning this issue eg Ryan et al
2007 Liu et al 2008 Montero-Dorta  Prada 2009 Reddy  Steidel 2009 Banados et al 2010
Oesch et al 2010 Trenti et al 2010 and it is beyond the scope of this paper to address this
question We briey mention that some authors such as Blanton et al 2005 claim the necessity
to modify the Schechter function to correctly describe the data particularly the upturn of the
function at faint magnitudes Anyway it is becoming clear that this feature is a consequence of a
mix of galaxy populations eg Christlein et al 2009 which at fainter magnitudes are dominated
by very late type galaxies We mention this issue again in the next section
A second interesting feature is the systematic excess of galaxies at the bright end M  24
a range which introduces signicant uncertainties on the tted Schechter functions and which were
avoided in our tting process
Indeed the small areas of the individual CFHTLS elds may be
subject to a particular larger structure in a given redshift bin For instance Guzzo et al 2007
detected a galaxy cluster at z  07 in eld D2 that could be the reason for the excess at the bright
end displayed by the respective luminosity function in Figure 4 However the combined luminosity
functions in Figure 5 do show the excess for all redshift bins where the bright end is observable
We note that Montero-Dorta  Prada 2009 have also shown this excess in their analysis of the
 7 
SDSS-DR6 and claim this is the contribution of galaxies with active nuclei presenting a luminosity
excess compared to normal galaxies
The evolution of M  and  for the individual elds as well as for the combined sample are
shown in Figure 6 The results of the combined area largely agrees with those of Ilbert et al 2005
for the evolution of both M  and  as well as with those for the SDSS of Blanton et al 2001
for the DR1 and Montero-Dorta  Prada 2009 for the DR6 These results indicate for the global
sample a slow fading of M  with cosmic time by  07 mag from z  18 to z  03 and a much
faster dimming by  08 mag to z  0 Our results are also compatible with those of Faber et al
2007 who analyzing the DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys in the B-band nd a dimming in M 
of 12-13 mag from z  1 to z  0 Also Zucca et al 2009 nd that in the zCOSMOS 10k
sample M  fades in the B-band by  07 mag from z  09 to z  02
The lower panel of Figure 6 shows for  a similar trend as that of M  with an increase in
density by a factor of  4 from z  18 to z  03 The data suggest that there is also a signicant
increase in the characteristic density of M  galaxies in the i-band from z  03 to z  0 by a
factor of  2 We also show in this gure the results of Gabasch et al 2006 for the i band which
uses photometric redshifts and essentially indicates no evolution for M  and 
We note that the plateau seen in the lower panel of Figure 6 in the interval 11  z  05
is consistent with the decrease of the merging rate shown in Figure 5 of Conselice 2006 Also
noticeable in Figure 6 is that near z  0 M  dims rapidly while  also rises signicantly with
these values at z0 agreeing with those observed in SDSS This will be addressed in the next
section
Since the errorbars plotted in this gure for the combined area are the variances of M  and
 for the four elds Figure 6 and Table 4 allow us to estimate that the eect of cosmic variance
over M  is  015 mag for these elds of size  07 square degree for z  1 Similarly the eect of
cosmic variance over  from these areas is  120  103h3gals mag1Mpc3
43 Analysis per Galaxy Types
As many authors have pointed out the shape of the luminosity functions largely depends on the
galaxy population mix of the sample under analysis eg Sandage et al 1985 Blanton et al 2001
Croton et al 2005 Faber et al 2007 Zucca et al 2009 So in order to investigate the relative
contributions of each galaxy type to the luminosity function evolution we have the advantage that
the CFHTLS catalog includes the best t SED type that gave rise to the galaxy redshift This is
one of the additional benets of using a template tting method to compute photometric redshifts
We stress that although we refer to the galaxy types in this work as E S Irr and starburst sb
they should be considered spectral types instead of morphological ones since they are attributed
as a result of a SED tting process Luminosity functions and respective Schechter ts for these
types are presented in Table 6 and shown in Figure 7 in dierent redshift bins for the combined
 8 
CFHTLS areas The combination of the four elds was particularly important in the case of the
samples separated per galaxy type in order for them to be statistically signicant
The galaxies classied here as Irrsb outnumber the E and S types for objects fainter than
M  20 at all redshifts and are the dominant class for z  16 as can be seen from Figure
7 As noted by Zucca et al 2006 these galaxies are responsible for most of the evolution and
steepening of the global luminosity function measured by Ilbert et al 2005 We also note the rise
of the E class at z  16 forming even at these early epochs the majority of the brightest objects
M  22 As the Irrsb-type S-type galaxies display in the CFHTLS data a Schechter
form at early epochs in the range 16  z  20 but present local deviations at the faint end
at z  08 Moreover Figure 7 shows that as reported by dierent authors eg Blanton et al
2005 Christlein et al 2009 the steepness of the global luminosity function is due to the increasing
number of Irrsb-type galaxies with decreasing luminosity Also the contribution of the S-type
galaxies may play a role in deviating the luminosity function from a linear form at the faint end
We also note that the excess at the bright end at z  08 is present in the latter types as clearly
seen in the Irrsb luminosity functions
In Figures 8 9 and 10 we show the evolution of M  and  for the luminosity functions of
types E S and Irrsb galaxies We present values with reference to those at z  05 termed here
ref  in order to compare with dierent authors We nd that in the i-band
ref and 
- E-galaxies show a mild evolution of M  with a dimming of  06 mag from z  15 to z  03
while their number density increases in the same redshift interval by a factor  3 We have also
considered evolutionary eects using the K-corrections from Annis 2000 derived for the SDSS and
based on the evolutionary synthesis code PEGASE-2 of Fioc  Rocca-Volmerange 1997 Using
the K-correction representing passive evolution we nd that it does seem to reproduce reasonably
well the 06 mag dimming of this type of galaxies in the redshift range mentioned above
- S-galaxies undergo a fading in their characteristic value M  by 13 mag from z  18 to z  03
while  presents an increase by a factor of at least 2 from z  13 to z  03
- Irrsb-galaxies shows a continuous decrease in brightness  2 mag in M  from z  18 to
z  03 On the other hand  presents a distinctive evolution it rises by a factor  4 from z  18
to z  12 then proceeds in the reverse sense with a decrease in density by a factor  18 to z  03
We note that this galaxy type presents lower accuracies of photometric redshifts determinations as
shown in gure 8 of Ilbert et al 2006
- Inspection of table 7 indicates that the slope of the faint end does not change signicantly for
each galaxy type
As can be veried from gures 8 9 and 10 these results are in general in very good agreement
with what was found by other surveys such as the photometric MUSYC-ECDFS Christlein et al
2009 and COMBO-17 Faber et al 2007 as well as the spectroscopic VVDS Zucca et al 2006
DEEP-2 Faber et al 2007 and z-COSMOS Zucca et al 2009 In order to perform these compar-
 9 
isons we assumed that in the MUSYC-ECDFS early type galaxies correspond to our E-galaxies
while their late type objects not shown because present large variations correspond to our S-
galaxies Concerning the comparison with the VVDS we assumed that their Type 1 galaxies
correspond to our objects classied as E-type while their Types 2 and 3 correspond to our S-types
and their Type 4 corresponds to our Irrsb-galaxies When comparing with the DEEP-2 and
COMBO-17 we assumed that their red galaxies represent our E-type galaxies and their blue sample
represents our S-galaxies The comparison with the z-COSMOS results was done assuming that
their Type 1 corresponds to our E-galaxies their Type 2 corresponds to our S-galaxies and their
Types 3 and 4 correspond to our Irrsb galaxies Small discrepancies may have origin in the
dierent criteria used to dene the galaxy types in these works and in our analysis
It is interesting to note that the lower panels of Figures 8 and 10 show that in the range
z  10  05 most of the decline  for the Irrsb-type galaxies is compensated by a comparable
increase of the E-type galaxies This is consistent with the transformation of blue cloud galaxies
into red sequence objects proposed by several previous authors eg Bundy et al 2006 Faber et al
2007 Cattaneo et al 2008 Stringer et al 2009
From table 6 we nd that for z  02 the rise of  in the lower panel of Figure 6 is due to
the contribution of the S and Irrsb populations which is twice of that of the E-type galaxies
and which cause a decrease in the mean value of M  Even though this is a possible explanation
one should also be aware that in this interval photometric redshift errors are larger in particular
because the galaxy population is dominated by star-forming galaxies which may impact the results
We note that the good match between our results in the i-band and those of other works con-
cerning the evolutionary trends of M  and  is present even in the case of surveys in the B-band
such as the DEEP-2 and z-COSMOS In order to verify if the fact that we are comparing dierent
bands introduces inconsistencies in this comparison a younger stellar content predominantly con-
tributes to the B-band while an older stellar content to the i-band we calculate the luminosity
functions in a bluer lter such as the g-band The resulting M  and  are also plotted in gures
8 9 and 10 and present a good agreement with the i-band indicating that the latter may be used
to study the cosmic evolution of galaxy populations We note that when deriving the luminosity
density evolution Tresse et al 2007 nd measurable dierences between the I and B bands in
the VVDS data Since in our results M z is slightly steeper in the g-band for latter types we
checked for more subtle dierences between the i and g bands performing linear ts to the M 
evolution for these lters in the range 03  z  11 The dierence in this redshift interval is
only 005 mag for the E-type galaxies and increases from  02 mag for the S-type galaxies to  04
mag for the Irrsb-type galaxies These results are consistent with a stronger evolution of the
luminosity in the bluer bands which probes star formation better and is more intense in later type
galaxies

5 Conclusions
In this paper we have used the spectroscopic and photometric data available from VVDS and
CFHTLS surveys to determine how well can we reproduce the evolution of luminosity function
based on large photometric samples This is a necessary exercise considering the large photometric
surveys been planned for this decade
Our main conclusions are
1- Using a sample extracted from the VVDS data containing galaxies with both spectroscopic
and photometric redshifts we obtain very similar luminosity functions reproducing with zphot the
Schechter parameters M  and  obtained with zspec within the errorbars
2- We also nd that we can reproduce with the photometric data of the CFHTLS the evolution
of M  and  of the spectroscopic VVDS sample as obtained by Ilbert et al 2005 These results
indicate from z  18 to 03 a mild dimming in M  of  07 mag while  increases by a factor of
3- From the combined CFHTLS sample we estimate the cosmic variance in surveys areas  07
square degrees to be of order 015 in M  and of order 25 in  in the range z  03  13
4- The faint end slope of the global luminosity function varies from  15 to  13 from z  09
to z  03
5- We used template tting from the available Terapix photometric catalogs of the CFHTLS
to assign galaxy types and derive type dependent luminosity functions We nd that we can
reproduce with the combined CFHTLS sample the evolution of the characteristic parameters of the
luminosity function of existing spectroscopic surveys such as the VVDS Zucca et al 2006 DEEP2
Faber et al 2007 and zCosmos Zucca et al 2009 Evolution of M  as a dimming with cosmic
time is similar for all galaxy types but less pronounced for E-type galaxies The characteristic
densities  of E and S type galaxies evolve similarly as an increase towards low redshifts while
very late types show a distinctive evolution with a decrease in density from z  12 to 03
6- We nd also that the variation of the faint end slope of the global luminosity function is
essentially due to the evolving mixture of galaxy types with the increasing proportion of E and S
galaxy types with decreasing redshift
There are issues in the present analysis that deserve further investigation with larger and
deeper samples For instance the Irrsb-type galaxies which seem to play an important role at
z  16 are known to present large photometric redshift errors A more detailed analysis involving
the comparison with spectroscopic redshifts would be of interest to evaluate the reliability of the
results obtained here
Also redening the late-type sample for instance by combining SIrr as a single class and
starburst galaxies as a separate class may contribute to a better interpretation of the eects involved
 11 
in the evolution of the luminosity function and thus a better understanding of the processes driving
galaxy evolution
Finally re-computing the photometric redshifts without the u-band may provide limits to
the redshift interval which can be used to study the evolution of the luminosity function by future
surveys such as DES that will not include this lter Indeed Ilbert et al 2006 show the importance
of the u-band to photometric redshifts determinations in the ranges zphot  04 and zphot  3
The results of this paper show the ability of photometric redshifts in estimating distances when
a large database is used as will be the case of DES and future projects in the Petabyte scale as
LSST Modern computational tools designed to treat this kind of data provide powerful analyzes
taking advantage of multi-band photometry Larger sky areas to be surveyed by these projects
will yield deeper insight concerning the characterization of the galaxy luminosity function and its
evolution
