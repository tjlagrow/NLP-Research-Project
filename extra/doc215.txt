ABSTRACT
The analysis of the four-colour maps of galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field has revealed
in the sample of 04 z 1 early-type eld galaxies the existence of ellipticals with a
predominantly old coeval stellar population However there is another unexpected
category of HDF early-type galaxies in which the galaxy core is signicantly bluer
than the outer regions We demonstrate that these colour gradients are predicted by
the multi-zone chemodynamical model for the evolution of elliptical galaxies
We suggest that the colour gradient could be used as a chronometer for the evo-
lution of elliptical galaxies galaxies younger than a few Gyr exhibit cores bluer than
the surrounding galaxy due to ongoing star formation while more evolved galaxies
have redder cores due to metallicity gradients increasing toward the centre

INTRODUCTION
A surprising result of the analysis of the four-colour
U300B450V606I814 maps of the Hubble Deep Field Abra-
ham et al 1999 hereafter A99 Menanteau Abraham  Ellis
2000 is the existence of early-type eld galaxies with posi-
tive colour gradients in the centre galaxy nucleus bluer than
the outer surrounding region evidencing recent nuclear star
formation in early-type galaxies with 04 z 1
Although these bluer core spheroids BCSs could be
explained within the scenario of structure formation via hi-
erarchical merging in which the recent nuclear star forma-
tion would be the result of mergers leading to the formation
of an elliptical galaxy the high degree of symmetry in the
images requires additionally that after the merger the sys-
tems had had time to relax to a spheroidal geometry
On the other hand the appearance of these systems is
exactly that predicted by the chemodynamical model for
evolution of elliptical galaxies Friaca  Terlevich 1994
Friaca  Terlevich 1998 hereafter FT98 The chemody-
namical model is a single collapse model diering however
from the monolithic collapse model in that it is a multi-
zone model in which there is no coordination in the star
formation in the several zones of the model This allows
that locally the time scales for star formation could be of
the order of 01 Gyr in the central regions of the galaxy
leading to a super-solar MgFe ratio as observed in lumi-
nous ellipticals while it takes  1 Gyr for the main body of
the elliptical galaxy to be formed An important ingredient
of the chemodynamical model is the persistence of a central
ccid13 2000 RAS
cooling ow for 2 3 Gyr feeding star formation in the core
which would account for the core being bluer than the rest
of the galaxy as in the BCSs found in the HDF
Within the frame of the chemodynamical model the
BCSs at intermediate redshifts would be one of the mani-
festations of the general evolution of spheroids At higher
redshifts the chemodynamical model for the evolution of
spheroids predicts a link of the BCSs with Lyman break
galaxies Steidel 1995 1996 and the scarcity of passively
evolving elliptical galaxies Zepf et al 1997 Barger et al
1999 At z  3 the rst  1 Gyr of our model galax-
ies shows striking similarities to the Lyman break galax-
ies LBGs intense star formation compact morphology
the presence of outows and signicant metal content Our
investigation of the nature of the LBGs using the chemo-
dynamical model for spheroids  Friaca  Terlevich 1999
hereafter FT99 supports a scenario in which LBGs are the
progenitors of the present-day age of 13 Gyr moderately
bright 005L  14L spheroids Over the z  1 range
in general the continuing for  2  3 Gyr star formation
in the centre of ellipticals predicted by the chemodynamical
model could explain the relative absence of very red galaxies
in deep optical and near-infrared surveys as expected from a
population of passively evolving elliptical galaxies Jimenez
et al 1999 The BCSs would indicate the persistence of
the same continuing central star formation at redshift  1
It should be noted however that most of the mass of the
stellar population is formed during the rst Gyr typically
half of the present stellar mass of the galaxy is formed in

 05 Gyr and  5  30 during the extended lower level
central star formation phase
In this paper we follow in detail the evolution of colour
gradients in spheroids within the scenario of the chemody-
namical model and investigate the relation of the continu-
ing central star formation activity to the BCS population
Section 2 gives a description of the chemodynamical model
Section 3 presents the predicted evolution of colour gradi-
ents in spheroids We show that for a wide range of masses
there are 3 phases 1 an earlier phase with relatively at
colour gradients 2 the bluer core phase and 3 the redder
core phase Section 3 also discuss the possibility of using the
transition from the bluer core phase to the redder core phase
as an evolutionary clock in cosmological studies Finally in
section 4 we identify the BCS seen at 04  z  07 as
sub-L spheroids formed at z  1 with continuing central
star formation or recurrent bursts of central star formation
Section 4 summarises our conclusions
We adopt in this paper H0  70 km s1 Mpc1 in ac-
cordance with the value obtained by HST Key Project on the
Extragalactic Distance Scale H0  71  6 km s1 Mpc1
or including a possible metallicity dependence of the Chep-
heid period-luminosity relation H0  68  6 km s1 Mpc1

2 THE CHEMODYNAMICAL MODEL
In this work the evolution of spheroids is modelled with the
aid of the chemodynamical model of FT98 The chemody-
namical model combines multi-zone chemical evolution with
1-D hydrodynamics to follow in detail the evolution and ra-
dial behaviour of gas and stars during the formation of a
spheroid Within each spherical zone in which the model
galaxy has been divided for the 1-D hydrodynamical cal-
culations the evolution of the abundances of six chemical
species He C N O Mg Fe is calculated by solving the ba-
sic equations of chemical evolution The star formation and
the subsequent stellar feedback regulate episodes of wind
outow and cooling ow The knowledge of the radial gas
ows in the galaxy allows us to trace metallicity gradients
and in particular the formation of a high-metallicity core
in ellipticals
FT98 built a sequence of chemodynamical models re-
producing the main properties of luminous elliptical galax-
ies The calculations begin with a gaseous protogalaxy with
initial baryonic mass MG FT98 investigates models with
MG between 1011 and 5 1012 M In order to study LBGs
FT99 have subsequently extended the mass grid of the mod-
els of FT98 downwards to 5  109 M Intense star for-
mation during the early stages of the galaxy builds up the
stellar body of the galaxy and during the evolution of the
galaxy gas and stars exchange mass through star formation
and stellar gas return Owing to inow and galactic wind
episodes occurring during the galaxy evolution its present
stellar mass is  15  70 higher than MG Gas and stars
are embedded in a dark halo of core radius rh and mass
Mh we set Mh  3MG The models are characterised by
MG rh and a star formation prescription The SFR is given
by a Schmidt law SF  xSF  is the gas density and
SF  SF R is the specic SFR Here we consider the

to 100 M A more detailed account of the models can be

3 EVOLUTION OF COLOURS GRADIENTS
We have used the spectrophotometric models of Bruzual 
Charlot 1998 to compute the SED for each galaxy zone
This is done in a self-consistent way using the metallicity
given for each zone and each time by the chemodynamical
model and for a consistent IMF Then the SED is inte-
grated over several apertures redshifted reddened by the
Lyman  forest opacity Madau 1995 and convoluted with
the lter transmission curves Unless otherwise stated AB
magnitudes are used throughout this paper
It is helpful for the understanding the evolution of the
colour gradients to consider rst the evolution of the colours
in the rest-frame of the galaxy Figure 1 shows the evolution
of the U300  B450 colour more sensitive to on-going star
formation as seen through several annular apertures for
several models with MG ranging from 5  109 to MG 
2  1012 M The evolution of model with MG  2  1011
the ducial model of FT98 or model 2 following FT98
we label the models according MG in units of 1011 M is
typical of models covering a wide range of masses from less
than 1010 up to 1012 M Its evolution exhibits 3 distinct
epochs regarding the colour gradients 1 An early phase
during which the galaxy as a whole is blue due to wide
ccid13 2000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
spread intense star formation The region with the highest
SFRs extends out to r  3 kpc with little radial gradient
of specic SFR which results in a colour gradient at in
this region The very central region can be even redder than
its immediate surroundings during this phase due to the
very fast chemical enrichment for r  1 kpc where the
metallicity at 01 Gyr of the stellar population is 06 Z
2 After 3108 yr the SFR decreases from outside in but it
persists for more than 1 Gyr in the core r  1 kpc which
is signicantly bluer than the rest of the galaxy that is the
bluer core phase during which the galaxy would be seen as a
BCS 3 The last phase t  1 Gyr is the redder core phase
during which the level of star formation is low in the core
which is redder than the outer parts of the galaxy due to
its high metallicity The dips in the evolution of U300  B450
indicates bursts of star formation Note that the transition
from bluer core phase to the redder core phase is rapid
which suggest the use of this transition as a time-marker
The transition occurs later if we consider the surrounding
2  r  3 kpc region because in the outermost radii 5 
r  10 kpc the lower metallicities imply bluer colours
The evolution of the model with MG  2  1012 M
model 20 of FT98 illustrates another sequence of phases
that occurs only for very massive systems MG  1012 M
In this mass range the galactic wind occurs late and the
inner cooling ow stops for a short time after which it reap-
pears and eventually becomes a massive global cooling ow
extending over 100 kpc The bluer core is clearly present
only in the early stages of the evolution till  03 Gyr
After this time due to the complex inner cooling ow be-
haviour which extends over the whole r  10 kpc several
uncoordinated star formation episodes rend the colour gra-
dients ill-dened For t  15 Gyr the core is redder than
its surroundings although the transition of a bluer core to
a redder core is not smooth and the evolution of the colour
of the core is subject to some blueing at  3 Gyr due to
a weak late central star formation episode Finally in late
times t  10 Gyr the establishment of a massive global
cooling ow recovers a bluer core
Note that although the model with MG  1012 M is
also massive enough to develop a cooling ow in t  10 Gyr
visible as a dip in the U300  B450 proles after this time
during its rst 10 Gyr it exhibits the three-phase evolution of
the colour gradients with the characteristic clear separation
between the bluer core and the redder core stage at  1 Gyr

sponding to LB  07L being typical for a present-day
moderately luminous elliptical galaxy Figure 2 shows the
evolution of the colour gradient for this model The quan-
tity C is dened as the colour at an annulus 5  r  10
kpc minus the colour in the central kpc r  1 kpc Pos-
itive values of C therefore correspond to positive central
colour gradients and indicate a core bluer than the sur-
rounding galaxy The 5  r  10 kpc dimension chosen for
the annulus representing the non-nuclear part of the galaxy
falls inside a typical eective radius of a luminous elliptical
 10 kpc for a L elliptical This region is easily resolv-
able by large ground-based telescopes since 1 arcsec corre-

ogy m    1 At the same time the r  10 kpc re-
gion avoids the  1  z4 Tolman dimming of the surface
brightness which makes it dicult to detect the outermost
regions of the galaxy if it is at high redshifts As we can see
from Figure 2 the changes in the central colour gradient are
more dramatic for an epoch of galaxy formation zGF  5
but they are very noticeable for zGF  1 If the galaxy is
formed at a recent epoch zGF  1 the bluer core is more
noticeable in the V606 I814 colour while for higher redshifts
of galaxy formation  the U300 B450 colour would trace bet-
ter the continuing star formation in the galaxy centre For
instance for zGF  5 the galaxy would have an bluer core
for z  3 when it is in the phase of central continuing star
formation only in the U300  B450 colour with a maximum
around z  2 for zGF  5 while for the B450  V606 and
V606  I814 colours the core is redder than the surrounding
galaxy
The bluer core phase may be characterised by zrev the
redshift at which there is the reversal from blue core due
to central star formation to red core due to metallicity
gradient The values of zrev are exhibited in Table 1 for the
models colours and cosmologies used in this paper
The colour V606  I814 in which we can follow more
closely the evolution of the colour gradient has zrev  0764
for a m  03   07 cosmology and a recent galaxy
formation epoch zGF  1 The maximum of V606  I814
is C  0414 at z  0859 There is also a secondary
maximum of the central star formation at z  0799 C 
0285 At the maximum of star formation this galaxy would
be very bright I814  1774 and it would be easily de-
tectable in the HDF Since no BCS as bright as this has

that the typical BCSs are not  L-ellipticals formed at
zGF  1 Turning to higher zGF s zGF  5 the blue core
is more pronounced in the U300  B450  in which the max-
imum colour gradient occurs at z  2012 C  1851

32 A massive central galaxy in a cooling ow
Figure 3 shows the evolution of the colour gradient for the
FT98 model with MG  2  1012 M which has a present-
day stellar mass of 24 1012 M Note that the late cooling
ow episode in this model would require enough gas supply
through the outer boundary of the galaxy a condition that
would be met if the galaxy would be located at the centre of
a relaxed cluster of galaxies As a matter of fact the model
with MG  2  1012 M could represent an elliptical at the
bottom of the potential well of a cluster of galaxies collecting
the gas of a cooling ow formed in the intra-cluster medium
since the most massive central galaxies of cooling ows have
masses of this order
On the other hand the early cooling ow episode could
be maintained by the gas within the dark mass halo of the
protogalaxy itself and thus would not require that the galaxy
be located in a cluster or more properly speaking that the
protocluster containing the galaxy be well-developed
In this model the rst episode of star formation is over
a more extended region so the central colour gradient is
smaller In addition for a galaxy formed at zGF  5 the
reversal blue corered core is followed by a contra-reversal
red coreblue core due to later central star formation which
would correspond to the present-day central star formation
activity seen in a few central dominant galaxies in cooling
ows McNamara 1997
At late times Model 20 shows starbursts in its core fed
by the late cooling ow As a consequence as we approach
z  0 C varies wildly being positive most of the time
star formation in the core prevails
33 Recurrent star formation in ellipticals
One particularly interesting model is the model 213 of
FT98 because it exhibits recurrence of late central inow
episodes This model has MG  2  1011 M as the ducial
model but xSF  13 instead of xSF  12  xSF is
the index of Schmidt law describing the dependence of the
specic star formation rate on the gas density SF  xSF
see end of Section 2 As the SN I rate decreases the wind
stalls the gas starts to accumulate in the galaxy core and
the radiative losses drive a new central cooling ow The late
central inow episodes are brief and quickly put out by the
resulting burst of star formation The duration of the late
cooling ow episodes is a few times 107 yr and since the
separation between them is typically a few Gyr their duty
cycle is  1100 The turning on and o of the central inow
could correspond to the active and inactive states of the
core in both the super-massive black hole model of AGN
and the starburst model of AGN In addition the length
of the duty cycle of the central inow increases with time
and the amount of material deposited decreases implying a
steep decrease of the time-averaged luminosity of any central
activity powered by the infalling material For the model
213 the second central inow occurs at t  4 Gyr and
involves 15  107 M and the third one 84  106 M
happens at t  95 Gyr Each late central inow episode is
accompanied by enhanced star formation inside the central
kpc the signature of which is a temporary blueing of the
galaxy core
These late episodes of star formation of the model
213 imply that the blue core persists even at redshifts
lower than in the ducial model This can be seen from
the lower zrev of the model 213 in comparison to that of
model 2 For zGF  1 the rst central cooling ow episode
is more conspicuous in the V606  I814  as was the case for
model 2 The maximum of the V606  I814 colour gradient
occurs at z  0853 when C  0473 in the B450  V606
ccid13 2000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
colour C  0222 However the second central cool-
ing ow episode is more noticeable in B450  V606  cor-
responding to the local maximum C  0179 at z  0744
C  0114 in V606  I814  The third inner cooling ow
episode has a more pronounced signature in U300  B450
 but the associated starburst is so weak that it does not
change the redder core to a bluer core so C  0012 at
z  0681 The metallicity gradient eect dominates over
the impact of the star formation as we can see from nearly
constancy of the V606  I814 colour gradient C  0071
at z  0681
34 Colour gradients as cosmological probes
Star formation activity in high redshifts galaxies has already
been proposed to be used to determine the cosmological con-
stant  and the matter mass density of the Universes
m Melnick Terlevich  Terlevich 2000 We suggest
here the use of colour gradients as a cosmological probe The
time-scales for the evolution of the central colour gradient in
spheroids can potentially provide an independent clock for
measuring the age of the Universe Figures 2 also exhibits the
results for three dierent cosmologies illustrating the sen-
sitivity of the evolution of the colour gradient to the value
of m We consider a at cosmology m    1 with
012  m  045 as favoured by the simultaneous con-
straints of the rst acoustic peak of the angular power spec-
trum of the cosmic radiation background measured by the
BOOMERang de Bernardis et al 2000 and the redshift-
magnitude relation derived from high redshift supernovae
surveys Perlmutter et al 1999 Riess et al 1998 Schmidt
et al 1998 These latter works have already found evidence
for an accelerating Universe in which matter would provide
only  30  of the critical density for a at Universe with
the rest being accounted for by the cosmological constant
 Therefore the three cosmologies adopted here consider
m  03  012 and  045
An additional constraint is the age of the Universe
given by each cosmology 1198 1347 and 1709 Gyr for
m  045  03 and  012 respectively The  10 er-
rors on H0 prevent us from using values of H0 signicantly
lower than 70 km s1 Mpc1 so the age of the Universe
implied by m  045 would be dangerously low in compar-
ison to the ages of the oldest globular clusters  115  14
Gyr derived in the post-HIPPARCOS age DAntona Caloi
and Mazzitelli 1997 Salaris deglInnocenti and Weiss 1997
Pont et al 1998 Chaboyer et al 1998 Carretta et al 2000
We should also take into account the constraints on the
age of the Universe from high redshift old galaxies Lima
 Alcaniz 2000 One of the strongest lower limits on the
age of the high redshift Universe comes from the very red
galaxy 53W069 at z149 with a minimal stellar age of 40
Gyr Dunlop 1999 which for H0  60 km s1 Mpc1
implies m  05
A useful quantity that could be used to set the colour
clock of the evolving spheroid and distinguish between sev-
eral cosmologies and investigate the epoch of galaxy forma-
tion is zrev The cosmologies with smaller ms larger s
have larger lookback times and therefore higher zrevs
Moreover the models with masses around that of an
L-elliptical progenitor MG  1011  1012 M have zrev
remarkably similar which guarantees a fair accuracy for the

the model with 1011 M has zrev  0745 zGF  1 and
V606  I814  and zrev  1159 zGF  5 and U300  B450 
The respective values for the model with 1012 M are 0806
and 0970 and for model 2 0764 and 1263
Model 20 is not particularly useful as a colour clock due
to the massive late cooling ow which prevails at the present
time It is worth to note that if the model is old enough zGF
high and m low there is central star formation driven by
the late cooling ow Therefore as we can see from Table
1 the model galaxy has a bluer core at the present day for
cosmologies and zGF s that imply larger lookback times till
the epoch of galaxy formation tbGF  and in this case zrev
is not dened
35 Bluer Core Spheroids
It is interesting that the lower mass models of FT99 in-
tended to describe typical LBGs with velocity dispersions
around 70 km s1 have properties that are similar to those
of typical BCSs of A99 for instance BCS HDF-2264 at
z0478 In particular the models with MG  1010 M
and 5  109 M have prolonged central star formation ex-
tending for more than 3 Gyr see Figure 1 of FT99 Because
of this they could be seen as BCSs over a signicant fraction
of their lifetime These objects if they have been formed at

Figure 5 illustrates the evolution of the colour gradients
of the FT99 model with 5  109 M hereafter model 005
assuming zGF  1 Model 005 would be seen as a   55

of 13 Gyr 005L spheroid In this model the central cooling
ow is extinguished only at 363 Gyr By comparison in
the ducial model 2 the inner cooling ow ends at 180
Gyr In order to compare our results with observations with
the same resolution as those of HST as in A99 now C is
dened as the colour inside the annulus 2  r  3 kpc minus
the colour in the central kpc since the WFPC-2 pixel size
of 01 corresponds to 06 kpc at z  05 for a m  03
  07 cosmology The resolution is even better in the
colours V  I maps of A99 which have a drizzled pixel scale
of 004 allowing for instance a clear denition of the r 
025 blue core of the BCS HDF-2264 In addition in this
section we use Vega magnitudes as in A99
As we see from Figure 5 for z  06 our model galaxy
would be easily detected as a BCS in the V606  I814 colour
which is the more reliably determined colour in A99 Menan-
teau et al 2000 At z  07 C0472 and I814  2152
while the colour gradient is at in the outer part of the
galaxy V606  I814 2-3 kpc1354 and V606  I814 5-10

 respectively Model 005 was not tailored to reproduce
the BCS HDF-2264 but the similarities of the properties of
the model to the object suggest that if HDF-2264 is typi-
cal of BCSs they would-be z  05 counterparts of sub-L
spheroids since I814  2173 of the model at z  05 is
comparable to I814  2166 Menanteau et al 2000  I814
of our model varies within the range 212  218 between
z  04 and z  08
The colours of the outer region 2 3 kpc constrain the
average age of the stellar population of the galaxy Within
the scenario of our model the colours of the outer parts
of HDF-2264 suggest zGF somewhat higher than 10 As a
matter of fact model 005 has V606 I814 2-3 kpc1171 at
z  05 for zGF  1 while it has V606  I814 2-3 kpc1223
at z  05 for zGF  12 thus reproducing well the red
outskirts of HDF-2264 for which the reddest pixels have
V606  I814  13 with an error of 007 mag see Figure 4 of
On the other hand the recent central star formation at
z  0478 of HDF-2264 could be explained by some sec-
ondary central infall similar to that of model 213 Note
that at t  1 Gyr the model 005 has a fully developed
galactic wind with 1200 km s1 at r  10 kpc However at
 3 Gyr the galactic wind has weakened wind velocity of
270 km s1 at r  10 kpc and in the inner regions there
is only a highly subsonic outow 20 km s1 at r  1 kpc
The gas accumulated in the dark halo of the galaxy brakes
the outowing gas so it is possible that in some cases the
core accumulates enough gas returned by the evolving stars
to trigger late central star formation episodes this happens
in model 213 but for a  L galaxy In this connection
we could explain the scarcity of BCSs in galaxy cluster envi-
ronments Menanteau et al 2000 as due to the stripping of
the gas in the dark halo of the spheroid thus preventing very
prolonged  3 Gyr cooling ow-fed central star formation
as well as late recurrent central star formation episodes
4 CONCLUSIONS
The early-type galaxies with blue cores of A99 are very sym-
metrical showing no morphological peculiarity A99 points
out that the  40 fraction they nd for the early-type
systems with recent star formation is consistent with the
predictions from hierarchical models However in the hier-
archical model scenario after a merger event the resulting
system has to relax quickly enough in order to be classied
as an early-type galaxy
A alternative scenario to the merger picture would be
that proposed by the multi-zone single-collapse model in
which late gas central inow would feed star formation in
the core of the galaxy A spherically symmetrical star form-
ing population would naturally develop in the centre of the
galaxy and one would not need the extra ingredient of a
short relaxing time-scale as in the merger scenario
The central blue cores arise naturally in our models in
this way reproducing the colour gradients which are typical
of BCSs Within the scenario of our model if the HDF-2264
BCS at z0478 is typical of BCSs then they are z  05

This paper has been produced using the Royal Astronomical
SocietyBlackwell Science LATEX style le
counterparts of sub-L spheroids formed at redshifts some-
what larger than zGF  1 and requiring very prolonged
 3 Gyr cooling ow-fed central star formation or recur-
rent central star formation episodes This could account for
the scarcity of BCSs in rich clusters due to the removal of
the gas in the dark halo of the spheroid by the intracluster
medium Without the gas reservoir in the dark halo the gas
inside the galaxy would escape very rapidly thus preventing
any long term cooling ow that could feed very prolonged
central star formation activity At the same time any late
central starburst would be suppressed since it could not
be feed either by gas ejected by evolved stars and accumu-
lated in the galaxy or by old galactic wind ejecta braked in
the gas-lled dark matter halo and falling back towards the
galaxy
If the progenitors of  L spheroids were formed at
redshifts larger than zGF  1 they would give rise to high-
mass high-redshift counterparts of the 04  z  1 BCSs
If they are formed at zGF  5 they could be missed in
the standard multi-colour surveys designed to select candi-
dates to LBGs Although it is possible to nd some BCSs in
the present LBG samples the colour criteria used in search-
ing LBGs should be made more exible for instance red-
der B450  V606 colour indices in order to search for high-
redshift BCSs which would be the  03a to few Gyr old
progenitors of the present day  L ellipticals Moreover
according to the chemodynamical model for evolution of
spheroids due to the fact that the prolonged central star
formation characteristic of BCSs extends at least 2 Gyr
and sometimes longer than 3 Gyr the BCS stage in the
evolution of spheroids lasts somewhat longer than the LBG
stage 02  t  15 Gyr FT99 and should also be found
in abundant numbers at high redshifts provided that we ex-
plore regions in the colour diagrams wider than those used in
the selection of LBG candidates and perform deeper imag-
ing with higher resolution of the candidates to BCSs Fi-
nally these high-redshift BCSs would be useful probes for
the epoch of galaxy formation and the cosmological param-
eters of the Universe
