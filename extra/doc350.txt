Abstract We improved the stochastic 2-D galaxy disk models Mineikis
 Vansevicius 2014a by introducing enriched gas outows from galaxies and
synthetic color-magnitude diagrams of stellar populations To test the models
we use the HSTACS stellar photometry data in four elds located along the
major axis of the galaxy M33 Williams et al 2009 and demonstrate the
potential of the models to derive 2-D star formation histories in the resolved
disk galaxies
Key words galaxies evolution  galaxies individual M33
1 INTRODUCTION
One of the most informative sources to study the evolution of galaxy disks is
a resolved stellar photometry Accurate photometric data supported by realistic
galaxy evolution models allow one to derive the most important galaxy parameters
 star formation SF and metal enrichment histories see eg Aparicio  Hidalgo
2009 Moreover the possibility of determining 2-D star formation SF histories
over wide areas oers perhaps the best opportunity to peer into large scale beyond
giant molecular clouds SF processes in the galaxy disks
Recent studies based on wide eld and deep stellar photometry data in nearby
galaxies revealed spatially resolved SF histories see eg Harris  Zaritsky 2009
Rubele et al 2015 Lewis et al 2015 Such studies focussing on the large scale
SF in galaxies could lead to better understanding of the SF processes in general
For this purpose the 2-D stochastic galaxy disk evolution models Mineikis 
Vansevicius 2014a could serve as an alternative to the widely employed however
computationally expensive hydrodynamical models
In this paper we extend further our study of the galaxy M33 Mineikis 
Vansevicius 2014a using improved 2-D stochastic galaxy disk models The models
are improved in two aspects outows of the enriched gas are considered and
capabilities to generate synthetic stellar photometry catalogs are implemented
These new features enhanced the models and made them useful for the analysis of
spatially resolved SF histories in disk galaxies

2 THE MODELS
In this section we only briey sketch our 2-D galaxy disk models which are
presented in Mineikis  Vansevicius 2014a and compared with 1-D cases in
Mineikis  Vansevicius 2014b Below we discuss in more detail only new features
implemented in the models recently a prescription of gas outows from galaxies
and a method of synthetic stellar photometry data generation
21 2-D galaxy disk models
The 2-D galaxy disk models are composed of concentric rings subdivided into
cells of equal area The disk mass is building up by a gradual gas accretion from
the reservoir where gas resides initially The accretion rate follows a mean dark
matter accretion rate as reported by Fakhouri Ma  Boylan-Kolchin 2010 The
SF is simulated by stochastic SF events in the model cells The main model
parameters determining stochastic SF are the probability of triggered SF PT and
the SF eciency SFE PT controls the intensity of propagating SF SFE depends
on the average gas density in bursting cells G and two parameters  and

22 Gas outows
In the previous study Mineikis  Vansevicius 2014a we introduced gas ows
between the cells occurring due to SF events in the neighboring cells
In this
study we consider in addition the case when a fraction of gas residing in a cell is
ejected during the SF event and leaves the galaxy
We implemented a model of expanding super-bubbles in stratied atmospheres
following Baumgartner  Breitschwerdt 2013 We assume that after the SF
event in a cell all newly formed supernovae explode in the center of the cell
which is located exactly at the mid-plane of the disk We derive the mid-plane gas
density assuming the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium and a constant along
disk radius scale height hz  100 pc These approximations make the speed of
the expanding super-bubble in the z direction perpendicular to the galaxy disk
dependant only on the gas density in the cell and the mass of newly formed stars
luminosity of the last stellar population
Baumgartner  Breitschwerdt 2013 derived the conditions for disk gas out-
ow for the Milky Way by assuming that the expansion velocity of the top of
super-bubble reaches a critical value vzc  20 km s1 before the acceleration
due to the exponential drop in gas density in the z direction begins We applied
the same critical value to our models of the galaxy M33
In our models we assume that once the outow condition is fullled for the SF
event the cell loses gas instantly We also assume that the gas lost from the cell
is composed of the ejecta produced during the last 10 Myr from dying stars of all
populations residing in it Therefore the mass of gas lost from the cell i mOUTi
after the SF event is

SF event produces nSN  2 the outow from the cell is suppressed
23 CMDs generation
For each disk model cell we keep a complete star formation history in a matrix
St Z with age t and metallicity Z dimensions The step in age dimension t is
equal to the model integration time step The step in metallicity dimension varies
in the range 0103 dex Each stellar population corresponding to the particular
matrix element at birth is generated by using a stochastically sampled initial
mass function IMF We assume that stellar population j corresponding to the
matrix element Stj Zj has ages uniformly sampled within the time interval t
For each stellar population j we nd in the library the nearest by age isochrone
and interpolate the luminosity for each star of this population However we
do not interpolate stellar luminosities between metallicities See Table 1 for the
parameters used to generate CMDs
24 Model parameters
We use the same set-up of the model grid as in Mineikis  Vansevicius 2014a
Taking into account that gas outows implemented in the models remove only
enriched gas the strongest eect is expected on the evolution of galaxys metallic-
ity Since the enriched gas makes up a small fraction of the total mass of a galaxy
its removal can have only a negligible eect on the galaxys total mass budget
For the present study we used three models possessing the following values
of parameters PT and  along the degeneracy valley Mineikis  Vansevicius
2014a 03 and 10 the model A 034 and 02 the model B and 044 and
01 the model C respectively For simplicity we kept the parameter  xed at
the value   2 and generated three corresponding sets of models by varying the
outow parameter  in the range 02-09
3 RESULTS
A comparison of the updated stochastic 2-D galaxy disk models with the obser-
vational data for the galaxy M33 is presented in Fig 1 where the radial proles of
gas surface density surface brightness in the i and F U V passbands and metallic-
ity are shown The observed radial proles of surface brightness are de-projected
by adopting 54 for the inclination of the galaxys disk In the models metallic-
ity is converted to the oxygen abundance with the solar metallicity Zcid12  0015
Bressan et al 2012 and the solar oxygen abundance of 867 Asplund et al

The new models produce degeneracy valley almost identical to that demon-
strated in Mineikis  Vansevicius 2014a The only signicant dierence is seen
in the metallicity radial proles because the model galaxies lose dierent amount
of metal enriched gas due to dierent SF eciency along the degeneracy valley
The models with the highest  values experience more massive SF events which
are capable of producing outows even in the outer disk regions In contrast the
models with the lowest  values form less massive stellar populations ie cells lose
a smaller amount of the enriched gas The radial proles of the enriched gas loss
also dier between the models In the central parts of the galaxy all models lose
a similar fraction of the enriched gas however in the outer parts the dierence
becomes more pronounced The models with highest values of  lose signicantly
more metals in the outer parts compared to the lowest  models Therefore the

Fig 2 HSTACS WFC resolved stellar photometry data of the galaxy M33 Williams
et al 2009 The contour lines represent the observed CMD star density on the logarith-
mic scale adjacent lines indicate density diering by 10 compared with the model A
CMDs plotted in grey logarithmic scale The rows of panels from top to bottom show
the model CMDs with   02 top row   05 middle row and   09 bottom
row The columns of panels from right to left show CMDs sampled at radial distances
of 09 24 41 and 58 kpc from the M33 center
dierences in the metal enrichment history of the models make it possible to break
the parameter degeneracy
However to constrain galaxy SF parameters the resolved stellar photometry is
necessary For the CMD analysis we used the HSTACS WFC stellar photometry
data in four elds within the galaxy M33 kindly provided by Benjamin Williams
Williams et al 2009
The sizes of areas used to sample models at dierent radial distances are the
same as those of areas measured in Williams et al 2009 To compare the model
and observed CMDs we adopt for M33 a distance of 840 kpc the same extinction
for all elds AV  03 and apply to the model stars Gaussian errors calculated
using the relation between photometric errors and magnitude which was derived
from the observed star catalog individually for each eld The extinction for the
HSTACS bands was calculated according to Cardelli Clayton  Mathis 1989

Fig 3 The same as in Fig 2 but for the model B
with RV  31 Note however that in estimating the errors we do not take into
account the eects of crowded eld photometry and dierential extinction within
the galaxy M33
In Fig 2 we plotted CMDs of the model A with dierent values of the outow
parameter  together with the observational data for M33 The model CMDs
with   02 05 09 are shown in the top middle and bottom rows of panels
respectively The model CMDs sampled at dierent distances from the galaxy
center 09 24 41 and 58 kpc are shown in the columns of panels from the left
to the right respectively Fig 2 shows that CMDs of the model A are incompatible
with the M33 data With   02 05 only the CMDs in the outermost elds
match the observations The inner elds display features of clearly too metallic
stellar populations in comparison with the observed data The model CMDs with
the highest value of the outow parameter   09 in the inner elds match the
observational data however in the outer elds the models are clearly too metal
decient
In Fig 3 we compare in a similar way the observations with the model B In
the cases of   02 05 we see again the CMD features of too metallic stellar
populations in the inner elds However contrary to the model A in the case of
Resolved stellar populations in M33
Fig 4 The same as in Fig 2 but for the model C
  09 bottom row of panels the CMDs of the model B match the observations
both in the inner and in the outer elds
The model C with the lowest value of  is compared with the observations in
Fig 4 The low values of  suppress gas outow from the galaxy due to relatively
low-mass stellar populations forming in the disk As a result of this eect even
models with highest  values shows too metallic stellar populations throughout
the galaxy disk
5 CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated the capability of our improved stochastic 2-D models
of galaxy disk evolution to analyze resolved stellar photometry data of the galaxy
M33 The method of synthetic CMDs was proved to be a powerful tool to disen-
tangle degeneracies of SF history in the cases when a turn-o of the main sequence
is below the detection limit of photometry The synthetic CMDs help to break
parameter degeneracies discussed in our previous paper Mineikis  Vansevicius
2014a Therefore putting together our galaxy disk models galaxy radial pro-
le observations performed in a wide range of wavelength  from UV to radio
as well as high precision and high resolution stellar photometry observations with
T Mineikis V Vansevicius
HST we have demonstrated that degeneracies of the SF history parameters can
be resolved
