ABSTRACT
The Galform semi-analytic model of galaxy formation is used to explore the
mechanisms primarily responsible for the three types of galaxies seen in the local
universe bulge bulgedisk and disk identied with the visual morphological types
E S0a-Sbc and Sc-Scd respectively With a suitable choice of parameters the Gal-
form model can accurately reproduce the observed local Ks-band luminosity function
LF for galaxies split by visual morphological type The successful set of model pa-
rameters is used to populate the Millennium Simulation with 94 million galaxies and
their dark matter halos The resulting catalogue is then used to explore the evolution
of galaxies through cosmic history The model predictions concur with recent obser-
vational results including the galaxy merger rate the star formation rate and the
seemingly anti-hierarchical evolution of ellipticals However the model also predicts
signicant evolution of the elliptical galaxy LF that is not observed The discrepancy
raises the possibility that samples of z  1 galaxies which have been selected using
colour and morphological criteria may be contaminated with galaxies that are not
actually ellipticals

1 INTRODUCTION
The current paradigm constrained in part by the Ks-band
hereafter K-band luminosity function LF eg Benson
et al 2003 has galaxy disks forming through a combina-
tion of cold gas accretion Weinberg et al 2004 and feed-
back Oppenheimer  Dave 2006 with bulges resulting
from mergers eg Barnes  Hernquist 1992 Hopkins et al
2008 Masjedi et al 2008 Thus the diversity of galaxy
morphologies seen today represents the culmination of mul-
tiple evolutionary paths These end points in galaxy evolu-
tion are captured in a taxonomy devised by Hubble 1936
and rened by de Vaucouleurs 1959 and de Vaucouleurs
et al 1991 that is based on the relative prominence of
the stellar bulge and the degree of resolution of the spiral
arms Despite attempts to emulate this classication scheme
using quantitative proxies such as colours eg Strateva
et al 2001 concentration-asymmetry indices eg Watan-
abe et al 1985 Abraham et al 1996 Bell et al 2003
the Gini-M20 classiers Lotz et al 2004 and parametric
methods involving bulgedisk decompositions Schade et al
1996 Ratnatunga et al 1999 Simard et al 2002 there are
no quantitative measures that uniquely segregate galaxies
into the morphological groups represented by the de Vau-
couleurs numerical T system eg Graham  Worley 2008
ccid13 0000 RAS
Thus proxies are merely a useful stopgap until the dicult
and time consuming task of assigning visible morphologies
to the ever-growing number of cataloged galaxies can be ac-
complished1
Fortunately the time-consuming task of assigning visi-
ble morphologies has now been completed for the vast ma-
jority of nearby galaxies The principal aim of this paper
is therefore to use the K-band LF for nearby galaxies De-
vereux et al 2009 to constrain models of their formation
and evolution The K-band LF is of particular interest be-
cause of its relevance to understanding galaxy evolution in
the context of Lambda Cold Dark Matter CDM cosmol-
ogy at z  0 the K-band LF traces the stellar mass accu-
mulated in galaxies at a wavelength where interstellar ex-
tinction is minimal Devereux et al 1987 Bell  de Jong
2000 Bell et al 2003 Additionally the functional forms
for the K-band LFs distinguish between bulge dominated
and disk dominated systems which suggests that at least
two quite distinct galaxy formation mechanisms are at work
to produce the diversity of morphological types seen in the
local universe Previous attempts to model the LFs in the
context of hierarchical clustering scenarios eg Cole et al

Total K-band LF which is the sum over all galaxy types
because they are based on samples for which there are no
pre-existing morphological assignments In this paper the
K-band LFs are modeled for galaxies segregated by visible
morphology in order to better understand 1 the origin and
evolution of bulgeless disk galaxies represented in the ob-
servable universe by Sc-Scd galaxies 2 the role of secular
processes in building the bulges of spiral S0aSbc and
lenticular galaxies and 3 the galaxy merger history that
led to the formation of elliptical galaxies Our analysis dif-
fers from Parry et al 2009 in that the GALFORM model
predictions are constrained by the observed K-band LFs for
galaxies of dierent morphological type Those model pre-
dictions are then compared with recent observational results
including the type averaged galaxy merger rate and the type
specic star formation rate both quantied as a function of
redshift
Observationally there is a weak dependence of K-band
BT on visual morphology Graham  Worley 2008 which
is used in this paper to segregate the model galaxies into
three broad groups representing the three types of galax-
ies seen in the local universe namely bulge bulgedisk and
disk2 These three groups are identied with the visual mor-
phological types E S0a-Sbc and Sc-Scd respectively Fol-
lowing Graham  Worley 2008 these three broad groups
are identied in the models by adopting the range of BT
ratio listed in Table 1 The table also indicates the distri-
bution of BT within each morphological class illustrating
that most disk galaxies including S0s have a rather low
BT ratio For example 80 of S0 and later type galaxies
brighter than MK  5 log10 h  21 have BT cid54 054 If the
magnitude limit is lowered to MK  5 log10 h  19 we nd
that 80 of such galaxies have BT cid54 035 This is in agree-
ment with the broad conclusion of Graham  Worley 2008
that most disk galaxies including S0s have low BT ratios
eg BT 13
2 In principle other outputs from the model could be used to
provide additional information on morphological type However
Graham  Worley 2008 show that bulgedisk ux ratio is the
most useful discriminant as it varies more as a function of mor-
phological type than other indicators such as bulgedisk size
ratio for example
2 MODEL
The Galform semi-analytic model has been described most
recently by Bower et al 2006 and the reader is referred
to that paper for a full description In the model galax-
ies consist of an exponential disk containing both gas and
stars and a spheroidal stellar componentthe morphology
of the model galaxies is therefore determined by the rela-
tive amount of light in each component A few key points
regarding morphological evolution of model galaxies bear
reiterating however
 Galaxies initially form through the cooling of gas from
their surrounding dark matter halo This gas is assumed
to conserve its angular momentum during collapse and to
therefore form a disk As such a galaxy formed in isolation
will always be a pure disk galaxy unless it is suciently
self-gravitating to become unstable
 Disks which become too self-gravitating become unsta-
ble to the formation of global perturbations and therefore
destroy themselves Instability is judged using the criterion
proposed by Efstathiou et al 1982 For a disk to be stable
it must satisfy
GMDRD12
where v is the circular velocity of the disk at its half-mass
radius RD and MD is the mass of the disk The value of
 for purely stellar disks was found to be 11 by Efstathiou
et al 1982 although lower values may be appropriate for
gas rich disks Christodoulou et al 1995 We treat  as a
free parameter If a disk is deemed to be unstable according
to this criterion the disk is destroyed with any stars and
gas present forming a spheroidal system in which the gas is
then rapidly turned into stars3 The end result is a purely
spheroidal aka elliptical system
 Mergers between galaxies can also create a spheroidal
component Galaxy-galaxy mergers are driven by dynamical
friction on a satellite galaxy and its halo orbiting in a
larger dark matter halo Merging timescales are computed
using a modied form of Chandrasekhars dynamical friction
equation Lacey  Cole 1993 The timescales are scaled by
mrg a parameter of the model to allow some adjustment
of merger rates Mergers are split into two categories
 Minor Mergers These are mergers with M2M1 
fellip where M1 and M2  M1 are the baryonic masses
of the galaxies involved in the merger and fellip is a pa-
rameter of the model see below In a minor merger the
stars from the secondary lower mass galaxy are added
to the spheroidal component of the primary more mas-
sive galaxy while any gas from the secondary is added
to the disk of the primary A galaxy can therefore grow
a spheroidal component through the cumulative eects of
many minor mergers
 Major Mergers These are mergers with M2M1 cid62
fellip and cause the destruction of any prexisting stellar
disks such that all stars from the merging galaxies become
3 Since the treatment of this instability process in semi-analytic
models is somewhat uncertain an alternative and less dramatic
implementation is presented in the Appendix A2 The results do
not change the qualitative conclusions of this paper

part of the spheroidal component in the merger remnant
The fate of any gas in the merging galaxies also depends
on the merger mass ratio
 If M2M1  fburst where fburst is a parameter of the
model then the merger does not trigger a burst of star
formation and any gas forms a disk in the merger remnant
and may subsequently form stars in that disk
 If M2M1 cid62 fburst then the merger triggers a burst of
star formation and any gas present in the merging galaxies
is turned into stars on a short timescale and becomes part
of the spheroidal component of the merger remnant
 Once a spheroidal component has formed subsequent
gas cooling can cause a disk to regrow around the spheroid
resulting in a galaxy with intermediate bulge-to-total ratio
 The model includes supernovae feedback which is as-
sumed to drive gas out of a galaxy at a rate propor-

tional to the star formation rate

and Vhot and hot are parameters of the model Vhot may
dier for quiescent star formation in disks and bursts of star
formation
The Bower et al 2006 model was not constructed us-
ing morphological data as a constraint Our initial goal
therefore is to adjust the parameters of the Bower et al
2006 model so that it reproduces the observed morpho-
logically segregated LFs of Devereux et al 2009 shown in
Figure 1 A search for an alternative set of values for the six
model parameters that match the observed morphologically
selected LFs yielded the values listed in Table 2 The best
t model LFs lines are compared with the observed LFs
from Devereux et al 2009 points in Figure 1 Morpho-
logical class is indicated by colour in the gure The relative
abundance of each type in the model is forced to agree with
the data in the interval 235  MK  5 log10 h cid54 230
this is how the mapping between BT and morphological
class listed in Table 1 was determined but the morpholog-
ical mix is not enforced outside this magnitude range Also
shown for reference are the results from the unmodied
Bower et al 2006 model dashed lines The comparison
shows that the model results are quite similar
The model LFs for ellipticals lenticulars and bulge-
dominated spirals are peaked and decline toward both higher
and lower luminosities In contrast the Sc-Scd class contin-
ues to rise towards low luminosities and dominates the total
LF for MK5 log10 h  22 The black line and points indi-
cate the total ie all morphological types LF Not surpris-
ingly the model prediction here is also in good agreement
with the data This is to be expected however since the
model parameters are optimised to yield a satisfactory rep-
resentation of the observed LFs for each of the three broad
morphological types and the total LF is just the sum of
these Additionally Bower et al 2006 have already demon-
strated that the model can t the observed total K-band
LF The parameters yielding the best-t model Table 2
are similar to those adopted by Bower et al 2006 disk
instability estimates are unchanged but the rate of galaxy
merging has been reduced by a factor of 2 a lower mass ratio
in mergers is required to disrupt stellar disks a higher ratio
is required to trigger a burst while the feedback in bursts
but not disks has been weakened

3 RESULTS
Having found a successful set of model parameters they are
used to populate the Millennium Simulation Springel et al
2005 with galaxies To do this dark matter halo merger
trees are extracted from the Millennium Simulation using
the techniques described by Harker et al 2006 The trees
are then populated with galaxies in the manner described by
Bower et al 2006 but using the model parameters found
in the previous section This results in a catalogue of 94
million galaxies and their dark matter halos The catalogue
provides the magnitudes morphologies and other physical
characteristics for all of the galaxies including their evolu-
tion through cosmic history The catalogue can therefore be
used to explore galaxy evolution Our goal is to reveal the
key physical processes at work that produce the three broad
types of galaxies in the observable universe namely bulges
bulgesdisks and disks The resolution of the Millennium
Simulation as in any N-body simulation is limited In Ap-
pendix A1 a study of the eects of resolution demonstrates

311 Dark Matter Halo Properties
The relationship between galaxy luminosity and dark matter
halo mass is illustrated in Fig 2 as a function of morpho-
logical type The solid lines in Fig 2 indicate the mass of
the halo in which a galaxy formed dened here following
Cole et al 2000 such that halos are labelled as reform-
ing each time they undergo a doubling of their mass As
may be expected there is a correlation between galaxy lumi-
nosity and the median mass of the dark matter halo in which
such galaxies formed The slope of the relation is quite at
however showing a range of a factor of 20 in halo mass
over a factor of 100 range in luminosity
There is little dependence of median formation halo
mass on morphological type except for the E class which
form in halos around a factor of  3 more massive for a
given luminosity This may be expected for the E class if such
galaxies are built up via merging rather than continuous gas
accretion To attain the same luminosity as its accretion-
fueled counterpart a merger-built galaxy must form in a
more massive halo so that the rate of merging will be en-
hanced
The dashed lines in Fig 2 indicate the mass of the dark
matter halo in which a galaxy lives at z  0 In the case of
satellite galaxies this is the mass of the isolated dark matter
halo in which they orbit not the mass of the subhalo within
which they reside The dierence between the dashed and
solid lines is therefore indicative of how much mass has accu-
mulated in the dark matter halo since galaxies formed Dark
Figure 3 The Sc-Scd K-band LF blue line and points versus
the median formation halo mass function black line scaled by a
ML ratio
matter halos may grow through mergers of satellites and by
accretion With the exception of Sc-Scd galaxies the mass
of the halo in which galaxies live at z  0 greatly exceeds
the mass of halo in which they formed particularly for the
lower luminosity systems a simple consequence of the fact
that the low mass halos in which these faint galaxies form
are highly likely to be subsumed into much more massive
halos by z  0 by becoming satellites of those halos
Interestingly Sc-Scd galaxies of all luminosities occupy
dark matter halos that are only about a factor of two more
massive than those in which they formed Thus disk dom-
inated galaxies must have avoided major mergers by virtue
of living in dark matter halos having rather quiet merging
histories There are a wide variety of possible merger histo-
ries for halos of a given mass Stewart et al 2008 including
some fraction which will have avoided major mergers It is
known that halos in low density environments experience
lower merger rates than their counterparts in high density
environments Fakhouri  Ma 2009 and so are more likely
to have a quiet merger history Thus Sc-Scd type galaxies
are distinguished from the other morphological types hav-
ing formed preferentially in low density environments 65
of Sc-Scd galaxies brighter than MK  5 log10 h  20 are
central galaxies ie they are the most massive galaxy in their
halo and they grow primarily through gas accretion and not
mergers Consequently the Sc-Scd K-band luminosity func-
tion has a similar slope to the median formation halo mass
function as illustrated in Fig 3
312 Timescales
While interesting from a theoretical standpoint dark mat-
ter halo masses cannot be easily measured for most galax-
ies Although weak lensing Mandelbaum et al 2006 and
clustering Mandelbaum et al 2009 measures can constrain
halo mass for classes of galaxies Greater utility is provided

Figure 4 shows the median stellar mass-weighted age of
where t0 is the current age of the Universe and cid63t is the
star formation rate in a galaxy at time t split by morpho-
logical type as a function of their K-band magnitude Disk
dominated galaxies blue line are distinguished once again
this time by hosting a uniformly much younger stellar pop-
ulation than any other morphological type This suggests
that disk galaxies of all luminosities have been continuously
forming stars since their formation which the model reveals
is at a rate that is proportional to the baryonic mass of the
galaxy In contrast the ellipticals lenticulars and bulge dom-
inated spirals contain much older stellar populations with
median ages of 10Gyr This does not mean that the galaxies
formed 10Gyr ago merely that the stars now dominating the
baryonic mass of the galaxies typically formed at that time
As we shall see in 314 massive ellipticals were actually
assembled much more recently
313 Bursts and Bulge Formation
Figure 5 examines the fraction of a galaxys bulge mass that
was made in the most recent burst of star formation solid
lines and the fraction formed through disk instabilities the
remainder being made through minor or major mergers
Interestingly 3050 of the bulge mass in lenticulars and
bulge dominated spirals S0a - Sbc resulted from disk in-
stabilities with the remainder created in the most recent
burst of star formation which occurrred cid5410Gyr ago that
itself could have been triggered by a disk instability or a
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
merger Unfortunately there is no way to distinguish be-
tween the two possibilties in this gure The importance of
these processes is greatly diminished in elliptical galaxies
because they do not possess disks4 and in disk dominated
Sc-Scd galaxies because they have small or non existent
bulges5
314 Formation and Assembly Redshift Distributions
Figure 6 shows the distribution of star formation redshifts
zcid63 and assembly redshifts zassem The star formation red-
shift for a galaxy is dened to be the redshift at which half
of the nal stellar mass of the galaxy has been formed The
assembly redshift is the redshift at which half of the nal
stellar mass has been assembled into a single progenitor
Clearly for a given galaxy zassem  zcid63 The most striking
4 The dashed lines reect the mass of stars that were formed
through disk instabilities in all progenitors Thus the dashed red-
line indicates that disk instabilties may have been an important
mechanism for the progenitors of todays ellipticals We note that
the fraction of an ellipticals mass which formed as a result of disk
instability events is sensitive to the details of the treatment of
such instabilities in our model With our standard treatment on
averge 29 of the spheroid mass in bright MK5 log10 h  23
ellipticals is made via disk instability events Using a more mod-
erate treatment of instability events in which a minimal amount
of disk is converted into spheroid see Appendix A2 this num-
ber is reduced to 9 These fractions are relatively insensitive to
the resolution of the merger trees The resolution study described
in Appendix A1 indicates that they change by only 3 for the
brightest ellipticals as the resolution of the merger trees is in-
creased by a factor of 16 For the faintest ellipticals shown which
are closer to the resolution limit of our calculations the fraction
changes by only 7 with the same increase in resolution
5 However the models do indicate that disk instabilities may
be an important bulge formation mechanism in the luminous
MK  5 log10 h  23 mag Sc-Scd galaxies

Figure 6 The normalized distributions of zcid63 the redshift at which half of a galaxys nal number of stars were formed dashed lines
and zassem the redshift at which half of the galaxys nal stellar mass was assembled into a single progenitor solid lines are shown split
by morphological class colour coding as in Fig 1 Each panel corresponds to a dierent K-band magnitude interval as indicated in the
panel The distribution if normalized such that the integral under the curve is unity
feature of these distributions is that the most luminous -25
cid54 MK  5 log10 h cid54 -24 elliptical galaxies have a median
star formation redshift zcid63  3 while the median assembly
redshift is much lower zassem cid54 3 This clearly shows that
such galaxies are formed almost entirely through the merg-
ing of pre-existing systems that formed at higher redshift
The dierence between star formation and assembly times
diminishes for lower luminosity ellipticals suggesting fewer
mergers Also the stellar population is younger in lower lu-
minosity ellipticals compared to their more luminous coun-
terparts by  1 Gyr Since the other morphological types
S0-Sbc show remarkably little dierence between their star
formation and assembly redshift distributions it is primarily
the luminous ellipticals -25 cid54 MK  5 log10 h cid54 -24 whose
growth is dominated by the delivery of pre-formed stars via
mergers that happened recently since z  3
The star formation and assembly redshifts are virtually
identical for lenticular and spiral galaxies S0Scd which
suggests that major mergers do not play an important role
in the evolution of these galaxy types The zcid63 distributions
are strongly peaked at low redshifts for the disk dominated
Sc-Scd galaxies Thus the models indicate that they should
contain the youngest stellar populations with ages cid54 6 Gyrs
On the other hand the zcid63 distributions for lenticular and
bulge dominated spirals become broader with decreasing lu-
minosity suggesting a heterogeneous group with stellar pop-
ulations spanning a wide range in age
4 DISCUSSION
In order to understand both the trends found in 3 and
the morphological evolutionary paths of galaxies we exam-
ine formation tree diagrams such as Fig 7 These show the
detailed formation history of individual galaxies and there-
fore provide a more detailed examination of morphological
evolution The tree shown in Fig 7 is for a luminous ellip-
tical galaxy As expected from the results of 3 this galaxy
shows signicant merging activity There is a clearly identi-
able main progenitor which has been a pure elliptical since
z  05 Half of the stars in the nal galaxy were formed
by z  375 but where not assembled into a single galaxy
until z  026 Approximately one quarter of the stars in
the galaxy were formed as a result of a burst triggered by a
disk instability event which occurred at z  5
In Figs 8 through 10 we show tree diagrams for ran-
domly selected galaxies in the E S0a-Sbc and Sc-Scd
classes for a range of luminosities Note that the vertical
axis of each plot is adjusted to stretch from z  0 to the
earliest redshift at which the galaxy has an identiable pro-
genitor The E class shows a clear transition from forming

reduced for the lower luminosity galaxies6 This is apparent
for all morphological types except for the Sc-Scd class and
is a consequence of the shape of the galaxy mass function in
systems of diering halo mass eg Benson et al 2003for
the most massive halos the galaxy mass function is a very
steep function of halo mass such that there are many more
galaxies of slightly lower mass with which the central galaxy
can merge For lower mass halos the galaxy mass function
is shallower yielding relatively fewer galaxies of lower mass
This results in fewer galaxies with which to merge and fewer
progenitors The shape of the galaxy mass function in our
model arises because of supernovae feedback which is rela-
tively stronger in lower mass halos
The S0a-Sbc class has a much quieter history Only the
most luminous examples MK  5 log10 hcid54  25 are involved
in a few signicant mergers Lower luminosity systems expe-
rience periods of early growth characterized by multiple disk
instability events that cause the disk mass to rise and then
fall sharply More recent growth since z2 occurs when
the disk has stabilized and is able to form stars quiescently
until the gas supply is exhausted typically between z  1
and z  2 for the lower luminosity systems and z0 for the
luminous systems
The Sc-Scd class has the most uneventful formation his-
tory of all This is of course obvious from the fact that
this class is dened to have almost no spheroidal compo-
nent These galaxies must therefore have experienced no
signicant instability or merger events The tree diagrams
of Fig 10 show that this type of galaxy is characterized by
steady star formation in a disk fueled by cosmic infall which
continues either until z  0 or until the galaxy becomes a
satellite and therefore loses its gas supply
41 The Merger History as a Function of
Morphological Type
Figure 11 illustrates the merger history as a function of mor-
phological type F z is the fraction of galaxies with mass
25  1010Mcid12 corresponding to MK  5 log10 hcid54  227
that have undergone a major merger M2M1025 within
the past 1Gyr These selection criteria allow a direct compar-
ison with the observationally determined rates of Jogee et al
2009 and Lopez-Sanjuan et al 2009 Galaxies are segre-
gated according to their z  0 morphology and the reported
merger fractions resulted from integrating their respective
merger trees over z The model predicts an average merger
fraction integrated over all galaxy types of  2 which com-
pares favorably with the observed lower limit to the major
merger fraction for the sample S1 of Jogee et al 2009 and
the merger fraction measured at z  06 for a slightly more
luminous sample by Lopez-Sanjuan et al 2009 The model
reveals that the merger rate is highest for elliptical galaxies
 8 of ellipticals at z  0 resulted from a major merger
6 Galaxies of luminosity similar to that in panel d of this gure
are aected by the resolution limit of the simulation as the halos
that they occupy typically contain around 50 particles preventing
their lower mass progenitors from being resolved For galaxies of
luminosity comparable to that in panel c and brighter galaxies
resolution is not an issuethey inhabit halos typically containing
500 particles sucient to permit many lower mass progenitor
halos to be resolved in the simulation

that occurred in the past 1 Gyr The model elliptical merger
rate is signicantly higher than the merger rate estimated by
Masjedi et al 2008 for a sample of luminous red galaxies
in close pairs The model elliptical merger rate predicts sig-
nicant evolution of the elliptical LF as discussed in more
detail in the next section Very few of the z  0 lenticular
and S0a-Sbc spiral galaxies resulted from a major merger
and none of the Sc-Scd disk galaxies Thus the model pre-
dicts that Sc-Scd galaxies exist in the local universe because
they have not been involved in any collisions
We compare our predicted merger rates with other re-
cent attempts to measure this quantity from either N-body
simulations of dark matter or from semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation Before doing so we remind the reader that
our merger rate is that of galaxies and so there is no reason
to expect it to coincide with rates of for example dark mat-
ter halo merging or dark matter subhalo destruction both
of which are commonly measured quantities In particular
Stewart et al 2009 examined the rates of both halo merg-
ing when a halo rst crosses the virial radius of a larger
halo thereby becoming a subhalo and subhalo destruction
when a subhalo loses 90 of its mass in an N-body sim-
ulation of dark matter Stewart et al 2009 nd merger
rates which increase monotonically with increasing redshift
in disagreement with our own ndings However we caution
that these results are based purely on dark matter properties
with a simple redshift dependent mapping of galaxy lumi-
nosity to dark matter halo mass and so do not measure the
same quantity as presented in this work Similar results were
found by Genel et al 2009 On the other hand Bertone 
Conselice 2009 nd merger fractions comparable to ours
with a broad peak around z  15 and a gradual decline
towards higher redshifts The agreement is not surprising
however as they derive merger rates from a semi-analytic
model similar to the one used here
42 The Evolution of the Elliptical Galaxy
Luminosity Function
The model predicts signicant evolution of the elliptical
galaxy K-band luminosity function as illustrated in Fig-
ure 12 The LF at each redshift has been k-corrected and fur-
ther corrected for passive evolution to z  0 so that the LFs
may be compared on an equal basis Within the Galform
model k-corrections and passive evolution can be computed
precisely The model predicts the full SED of each galaxy
and so we can simply shift the lter to the galaxy rest frame
and compute the absolute magnitude which will then au-
tomatically include the k-correction For passive evolution
the model predicts the mix of stars in each galaxy at each
redshift including their distribution of ages and metallic-
ities To compute the magnitude of the galaxy at z  0
assuming passive evolution ie no further star formation
we simply articially increase the ages of these stars by the
lookback time to the current redshift and then sum their
SEDs to give the net SED of the galaxy passively evolved
to z  0 The passively evolved magnitude of the galaxy
is then trivially found by integrating under the appropri-
ate lter response function Our k and evolution corrections
are at least at low redshifts in reasonable agreement with
those determined observationally by Bell et al 2003 For
example in the K-band at z  05 we nd k and evolution
corrections of approximately k  075 and e  055 to be
compared to k  105  015 and e  04 from Bell et al
2003
Figure 12 shows that the space density goes up at the
high luminosity end and down at the low luminosity end as
the redshift decreases These evolutionary changes have been
quantied in Table 3 in terms of the Schechter parameters
h3 M5 log10 h and  The model results indicate that
the mass build-up of ellipticals is reected in the K-band
mostly through the large  226 increase in h 3 since z 
1 and a small 0201 mag brightening of M  5 log10 h
Parameterizing the LFs allows the luminosity density j
cid90
to be calculated by integration
M 1004Mcid12M dM
where Mcid12 is the absolute magnitude of the Sun corre-
sponding to 332 mag at K Bell et al 2003 The luminosity
density is important as it can provide a constraint on the
mass density of stars in galaxies given a mass to light ra-
tio The total K-band luminosity density at each redshift
was calculated by integrating equation 3 over the interval
25 cid54 MK5log10h cid5419 mag and the results are summa-
rized in Table 3 These values indicate that the luminosity
density or equivalently the mass density has increased by
about a factor of 24 since z  1 The predicted evolution
since z  2 is even more dramatic These model results con-
cur in general with recent observational results suggesting
that the stellar mass contained within the red galaxy pop-
ulation has at least doubled since z  1 Bell et al 2004
Willmer et al 2006 Blanton 2006 Faber et al 2007 Brown
et al 2007
Our model results further indicate that the mass den-
sity of luminous ellipticals grows at the expense of their
lower luminosity counterparts causing the faint end slope
to turn downwards with decreasing redshift Such low lu-
minosity ellipticals are presumably satellites of their more
luminous counterparts they are dicult to detect observa-
tionally with current technology and contribute negligibly
to the luminosity density evolution of ellliptical galaxies
At the other end of the luminosity range recent observa-
tions Brown et al 2007 Cool et al 2008 indicate that
the luminous MB 5log10h cid54 -21 red galaxy population
loosely identied with ellipticals were already in place at
z  1 whereas the corresponding model elliptical luminosity
density integrated between -245 cid54 MK 5log10h cid54 -255
shows an increase by a factor of 4 since z  1 Thus the
model predicts signicant evolution of the most luminous
elliptical galaxies since z  1 that observers do not see
One possible reason for the discrepancy is that the colour
selection criteria employed by observers may result in signi-
cant contamination of the observational datasets with galax-
ies that are not actually ellipticals causing elliptical galaxy
evolution to be underestimated This potential problem with
the observations was noted previously by Faber et al 2007
It is crucial therefore to understand the connection between
the luminous red galaxy population seen at z  1 and the
elliptical population at z  0 Are the luminous red galaxies
seen at z  1 the progenitors of todays ellipticals or are they
dusty objects destined to become what we recognise in the
local universe as lenticulars or early-type spiral galaxies
Of course another possibility is that the model may be at

fault in overestimating the evolution of luminous ellipticals
although in defense of the model it does succeed in pre-
dicting the observed space density of ellipticals at z  07

observed star formation rate as described in more detail in
the next section
43 The Star Formation History as a Function of
Morphological Type
With regard to elliptical galaxies the results presented
in Figure 6 conrm the trend seen observationally eg
Thomas et al 2005 and references therein that the star
formation redshift for elliptical galaxies is correlated with
their mass luminosity in the sense that the stars com-
prising the more massive luminous ellipticals are old The
model predicts that half the stars comprising todays lumi-
nous 25cid54 MK5 log10 h cid5424 ellipticals formed between
redshifts of 2 and 4 with ages  10 Gyr and were subse-
quently assembled via mergers that occurred since z 3
into the objects we recognise in the local universe as lu-
minous elliptical galaxies In contrast stars comprising the
lower luminosity 24cid54MK5 log10 h ellipticals are younger
with ages spanning 410 Gyrs and that were created in star
formation episodes the most recent of which were triggered
by disk instabilities that occurred since z  2 Thus the
seemingly anti-hierarchical behavior depicted in Figure 6 re-
sults from the fact that there are dierent mechanisms gov-
erning the star formation history of ellipticals mergers for
the luminous ones and disk instabilities for the less luminous
ones These results on formation redshift are insensitive to
merger tree mass resolution with galaxy mean stellar ages
changing by only a few percent if we increase the merger tree
resolution by a factor of 16 and to the details of the treat-
ment of disk instabilities adopting the minimalistic model
of Appendix A2 results in changes to mean stellar age of less
than 10 We note that in our model the amount of mass
brought in to low luminosity ellipticals by minor mergers is
relatively small due to the strong supernovae feedback which
acts to suppress galaxy growth in lower mass halos
In Figure 13 we compare model predictions concerning
the evolution of the specic star formation SSF rates with
those measured recently by Perez-Gonzalez et al 2008 for
massive cid62 1011 Mcid12 galaxies The measured star formation
7 Since the parameters of the model were adjusted to match the
observed morphologically segregated luminosity functions this is
not strictly a prediction However the unadjusted Bower et al
2006 model also yields a similar space density for elliptical
galaxies as shown in Figure 1
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
rates are computed assuming a Chabrier initial mass func-
tion and so correspond to the total star formation rate ie
including stars of all masses The same is predicted by the
model in which we compute the total star formation rate
from the known dynamical time and gas content of each
model galaxy The principal merits of the Perez-Gonzalez
et al 2008 work are that the SSF rates are based on UV
to Mid IR photometry and the results are segregated by vi-
sual morphology The gure shows that the observed SSF
rates for disky galaxies and spheroids are bounded by the
model predictions for disk and bulgedisk galaxies and
both the model and observations show a well established
trend that the SSFR is decreasing with decreasing redshift
with implications for the stellar mass accumulated in these
types of systems Dahlen et al 2007 Chen et al 2009
44 The Secular Evolution of Bulges
The model predicts that the bulges in spiral galaxies have
grown through a combination of disk instabilities and minor
mergers Observationally the colour of bulges are more sim-
ilar to the disks in which they reside than to other bulges
Balcells  Peletier 1994 Peletier  Balcells 1996 This
coupling between bulge and disk colour has been observed
out to z1 Domnguez-Palmero  Balcells 2008 2009
where younger bluer high surface brightness bulges have
been observed suggesting an epoch of bulge formation In
concurrence with the observations the model predicts that
bulges in luminous MK  5 log10 h 23 spiral galaxies have
grown signicantly through a combination of disk instabil-
ities and minor mergers since z2 and the model further
predicts that bulges have been growing for a much longer
time period since z4 in lower luminosity systems
5 CONCLUSIONS
The Galform semi-analytic model of galaxy formation
Bower et al 2006 has been employed to reproduce and ex-
plain trends in galaxy morphology seen across a wide range
of luminosities Small adjustments to the model parameters
permit excellent agreement with the observed morphologi-
cally selected K-band LF of Devereux et al 2009 although
the unmodied Bower et al 2006 model also performs very
well While predicting morphology from semi-analytic mod-
els and numerical simulations remains challenging a con-
servative approach has been adopted by categorising model
galaxies into just three broad classes E pure spheroid
S0-Sbc intermediate and Sc-Scd pure disk based on
their K-band bulge-to-total luminosity ratio Within this
conservative categorisation the results presented are con-

merging is in general commonplace The median merger

bulge dominated elliptical galaxies are essentially zero
icantly dierent from that of elliptical galaxies which do ex-
perience signicant merging However the variation around
that median history is much less for the Sc-Scd galaxies
than for ellipticals The Sc-Scd class typically experience a
very simple accretion history deviating little from the me-
dian and exhibiting relatively few large merging events The
formation history of these systems is therefore determined
by the rate of growth of their dark matter halo and the
corresponding rate of gas supply cooling and infall Galax-
ies in this class have typically been forming stars in their
disks over large fractions of cosmic history and continue to
do so at the present day Steinmetz  Navarro 2002 and
more recently Dutton 2009 have suggested that produc-
ing bulge-less disk galaxies in sucient numbers could be
challenging in a CDM universe In fact because there is a
suciently large number of dark matter halos with relatively
quiet merging histories bulge-less disk galaxies can prevail
in the numbers observed Additionally strong feedback pre-
vents the formation of relatively massive satellites around
these galaxies which are predominantly low mass
 Luminous elliptical galaxies form through multiple
mergers of smaller progenitors For the most massive ellipti-
cals these mergers tend to be dry and so contribute no new
star formation Interestingly the Galform model does not
produce the dwarf elliptical sequence which should emerge
at MK  5 log10 h  21 mag Thus the model prediction

with MK  5 log10 h  21 mag and the model prediction
that they form through disk instability events is uncertain
 The intermediate morphological types S0-Sbc are
characterized by an early period of merging and disk insta-
bility events which form the bulge followed by an extended
period of steady uninterrupted disk growth
 The model results concur with several observational re-
sults including the type averaged galaxy merger rate mea-
surements of the specic star formation rate the secular evo-
lution of spiral bulges the seemingly anti-heirarchical evolu-
tion of elliptical galaxies and the factor of  2 growth in the
luminosity density of elliptical galaxies since z  1 With re-
gard to the last point however the model predicts signicant
evolution at the high luminosity end of the K-band elliptical
galaxy LF that has yet to be conrmed observationally

APPENDIX A ROBUSTNESS OF MODEL
MORPHOLOGIES
In this appendix we explore to eects which could inuence
the morphological properties of model galaxies and demon-
strate that in fact our results are robust to these eects
A1 Resolution Study
Since morphological evolution in our model is driven at
least partly by merging activity it is important to assess
whether the resolution of the N-body merger trees that we
utilize causes us to miss some lower mass merging activity
and therefore to incorrectly estimate morphologies of some
galaxies While we currently do not have suitable N-body
merger trees with higher resolution available to us for a reso-
lution study we can instead utilize merger trees constructed
using a modied extended Press-Schechter approach see
Parkinson et al 2008 which is designed to produce trees
which are statstically equivalent to those found in N-body
simulations The advantage of this approach is that it allows
us to increase the resolution to almost arbitrarily high lev-
els While the results will not precisely match those obtained
using N-body trees they are suciently close to allow us to
explore the eects of changing resolution Figure A1 below
shows the results of a resolution study carried out in this
way on the morphologically segregated luminosity function
The thickest lines correspond to the case of N-body
merger trees drawn from the Millennium Simulation ie
used in this paper The remaining lines were all generated
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Figure A1 A study of resolution eects on the morphologically
segregated luminosity function of Fig 1 The thickest lines show
the results obtained utilizing Millennium Simulation merger trees
ie as used throughout our work The remaining three sets of
lines were produced using analytically generated merger trees us-
ing the algorithm of Parkinson et al 2008 The thickest of these
lines correspond to analytic trees with a mass resolution matched
to that of the Millennium Simulation while successively thinner
lines have 4 and 16 times better mass resolution
using the exact same model parameters but with merger
trees constructed using the Parkinson et al 2008 algo-
rithm Of these lines the thickest has a resolution matched
to that of the Millennium Simulation As can be seen
Fig A1 it does not produce luminosity functions in precise
agreement with those obtained using Millennium Simulation
merger trees since the analytic merger trees are not exactly
statistically equivalent to the N-body ones but they are
very close The thinner lines represent results obtained when
the mass resolution in the analytic merger trees is increased
ie shifted to smaller masses by factors of 4 and 16 It
can clearly be seen that there is no signicant change in the
predicted luminosity functions As such we conclude that
galaxy morphologies are well converged in our model when
using trees with the Millennium mass resolution This is
a consequence of the eects of supernovae feedback which
makes galaxy formation in lower mass halos highly ine-
cient and therefore to have little eect on more massive
galaxies
A2 Alternative Treatment of Disk Instabilties
The instability of galaxy disks is a dicult process to treat
analytically Our standard approach assumes that any un-
stable disk will quickly develop a strong bar and destroy
itself entirely turning the galaxy into a pure spheroid Re-
cent high resolution hydrodynamical simulations Agertz
et al 2009 show that unstable disks experience local insta-
bilities leading to fragmentation and the incomplete destruc-
tion of the disk To at least partially assess the importance
of the assumptions we make regarding disk instabilities we
have implemented an alternative disk instability treatment
Andrew J Benson and Nick Devereux
Figure A2 The eects of an alternative disk instability model on
the morphologically segregated luminosity function The thickest
lines show results from our standard treatment of disk instabili-
ties applied to merger trees extracted from the Millennium Simu-
lation Intermediate lines indicate the same standard treatment of
instabilities but applied to analytically derived merger trees us-
ing the algorithm of Parkinson et al 2008 Finally the thinnest
lines show the results of adopting an alternative treatment of disk
instabilities in which only just enough mass is transferred from
an unstable disk to cause it to restabilize applied to analytically
derived merger trees
in our model in which only just enough mass is transferred
from the disk to the spheroid component to restabilize the
diskan approach which has been adopted by other semi-
analytic models Hatton et al 2003 Croton et al 2006 Fig-
ure A2 shows the eect of switching to this alternative treat-
ment on the morphologically segregated luminosity function
The thickest lines show results utilizing Millennium Simula-
tion trees with our standard treatment of disk instabilities
Medium thickness lines show the same treatment of instabil-
ities but with analytic merger trees with resolution matched
to that of the Millennium Simulation Finally the thinnest
lines show results of using the alternative treatment of in-
stability events with analytic merger trees
The net result of switching to the alternative treatment
of instabilities is to slightly increase the number of bulgeless
galaxies at all luminosities with a corresponding decrease
in the numbers of intermediate and pure spheroid galaxies
The changes do not alter the qualitative trends of morpho-
logical mix with luminosity However in order to reproduce
quantitatively the observed morphological mix of galaxies
at MK  5 log h  23 would require adjusting the range of
BT ratios used to segregate galaxies into the three broad
morphological classes Table 1 The sense of the required
adjustment for the E pure spheroid class would be to
smaller BT ratios which is inconsistent with their observed
morphology and may be a sign that our standard treatment
of disk instabilities is more realistic
