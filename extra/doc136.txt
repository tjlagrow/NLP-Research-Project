Abstract The main properties of Damped Lyman alpha DLA sys-
tems are briey reviewed with the aim of studying the nature and evolu-
tion of the galaxies associated with this class of QSO absorbers Candi-
date DLA galaxies identied at z  1 in the elds of background QSOs
show a variety of morphological types without a predominance of spirals
Most properties inferred from spectroscopic studies at z  165 dier
from those expected for spiral galaxies The observational results instead
suggest that a signicant fraction of DLA systems originate in low-mass
andor LSB galaxies Evolution eects are generally not detected in DLA
systems This fact suggests that the dierences between the properties of
present-day spirals and those of high-z DLA systems may not be ascribed
to evolution Several selection eects can bias the observed population
of DLA absorbers Analysis of these eects indicates that the fraction
of spiral galaxies tends to be underestimated relative to the fraction of
low-mass or LSB galaxies
Introduction
The redshifted Ly absorptions observed in the spectra of QSOs originate in
intervening clouds with wide-ranging HI column densities When N HI  2 
1020 atoms cm2 the Ly  line shows a broad prole with extended radiation
damping wings Damped Ly  DLA absorption lines are always accompanied
by narrow metal lines at the same redshift zabs These absorption line systems
are quite rare the number per unit redshift interval being the lowest among all
types of QSO absorbers nz  02 at zabs  2 Wolfe et al 1995 About a
hundred DLA systems are currently known as a result of several surveys most of
them performed in the optical spectral range Wolfe et al 1986 1995 Owing to
the dramatic drop of QSO counts at high z only a reduced number of absorbers
have been detected at z  4 Storrie-Lombardi et al 1996a At z  165
Ly  absorptions can only be observed with space-born UV telescopes and the
number of systems identied is quite limited Lanzetta Wolfe  Turnshek 1995
Jannuzi et al 1998 and refs therein Turnshek 1998 DLA systems have also
been detected as redshifted 21 cm absorption in the continuum of radio loud
quasars Carilli et al 1996 and refs therein
Several reasons suggest that DLA systems originate in interstellar clouds
within galaxies located in the direction of the QSO i the high values of HI
column density typical of the interstellar medium of gas-rich galaxies ii the

presence of low ionization species of metals observed in Galactic HI regions iii
the line-of-sight velocity dispersion consistent with the typical values expected
for galactic disks iv the evolution of the comoving mass density of gas in DLA
absorbers which is suggestive of gas consumption due to star formation Wolfe
et al 1995 DLA systems have low metallicities typically ZZ  101 and
in some cases as low as ZZ  102 Pettini et al 1997a 1999 Therefore
the galaxies hosting DLA clouds must be chemically young and in some cases
must be in the very rst stages of their chemical enrichment
Studies of DLA absorbers allow us to probe young galaxies at high redshift
from the observation of only one line of sight though each galaxy This kind
of investigation is complementary to studies of Ly-break galaxies which allow
us to probe high redshift galaxies from the observation of their integrated emis-
sion The advantage of DLA absorption studies is the intrinsic brightness of the
background QSO which can be used to obtain spectra of unparalleled resolution
and signal-to-noise ratio at a given redshift The quality of these spectra allows
us to study the chemical and physical properties of young galaxies in unrivaled
detail
Even if the link between DLA absorbers and intervening galaxies is com-
monly accepted there is no general agreement on the nature of the galaxies
hosting the DLA clouds also called DLA galaxies hereafter The traditional
working hypothesis is that DLA galaxies are the progenitors of present-day spi-
rals Wolfe et al 1986 but alternative interpretations have also been proposed
eg Tyson 1988 While it is possible to study the evolution of DLA systems
per se understanding the nature of DLA galaxies is fundamental to put the phe-
nomenon in the general context of galactic evolution and to constrain theories
of structure formation The observational clues to the nature of DLA galaxies
are summarized in the next section of this contribution Selection eects are
considered in Section 3 while the evolution properties are discussed in Section
4 Finally the results are summarized in Section 5
2 Clues to the nature of DLA galaxies
One approach to cast light on the nature of DLA galaxies is to estimate the
number of galaxies of a specic morphological type T expected along a random
line of sight At z  0 the number per unit distance interval is
  Z T
 M   AT
 M   dM
where T
 is the optical luminosity function of the galaxies of type T in terms
of the absolute magnitude M  AT
 is the eective cross section of the column
density contour NHI  Nmin  2  1020 cm2 and the angled brackets indicate
a weighted average over all possible galaxian inclinations Estimates of the HI
content within galaxies at the present epoch indicate that most of the observed
absorptions should originate in spirals Rao  Briggs 1993 This prediction
however is not conrmed by studies of candidate DLA galaxies at low redshift
Section 21 Considering the lack of understaning at z  0 it is clear that
estimating the fraction nT
 at high z is highly speculative until we know
the eects of evolution and merging on morphology and galaxian sizes

Spectroscopic data are used to study chemical and physical properties Imaging
data are used to study the morphology of candidate DLA galaxies
Imaging
and spectroscopic data have a poor redshift overlap while the imaging is most
eective at z  1  the confusion with the QSO source is more critical at high
z  the spectroscopy is mostly performed at zabs  165

21 Morphology of candidate DLA galaxies
The galaxies responsible for the DLA absorption can be identied by studying
the eld of the background QSO Galaxies with impact parameter compatible
with the expected extension of the HI disk are considered as candidate absorbers
The impact parameter  h1
 kpc is estimated at the redshift of the absorber
and in order to conrm the identication one should also measure the redshift
of the galaxy and check if zgal  zabs When galaxies are not detected within a
reasonable value of  an upper limit to the surface brightness of the intervening
galaxy can still be derived The results of searches for DLA galaxies in QSO
elds are summarized in Table 1 Although the sample is limited and only a
few galaxies have a redshift measurement an important conclusion can already
be derived DLA galaxies at z  1 show a variety of morphological types S0
spirals dwarfs and dierent levels of surface brightness including low surface
brightness LSB galaxies In other words the population of DLA galaxies is not
Nature and evolution of Damped Lyman alpha systems
dominated by any specic type of galaxies and in particular spirals constitute
a small fraction of the sample contrary to the predictions based on the HI
content of nearby galaxies Rao  Briggs 1993 The selection eects discussed
in Section 3 may be responsible for this unexpected result
Elemental abundances
Abundances of DLA systems can be measured with accuracy and are already
available for about 50 systems Lu et al 1996 Prochaska  Wolfe 1999 Pettini
et al 1999 see also refs in Vladilo 1998 The HI column density can be easily
constrained within  01 dex or even better by tting the damping wings of
the Ly  prole The most common metals show unsaturated transitions which
allow column densities to be accurately determined Ionization corrections are
generally negligible thanks to the presence of neutrals or ions with IP  136 eV
which are dominant ionization stages in HI regions Dust probably represents
the main source of uncertainty in abundance determinations since an unknown
fraction of the elements is probably depleted into dust grains Section 23
Studies of the intrinsic abundances of DLA systems in the presence of dust have
been performed by Lauroesch et al
1996 and by Kulkarni Fall  Truran
1997 In these studies the dust-to-gas ratio k is considered a free parameter
with same value in all systems However the level of depletion scales with k
and it is essential to estimate k for each DLA cloud in order to properly correct
the abundances Vladilo 1998
Abundances of metal-poor Galactic stars are often used as a reference for
DLA studies since they reect the abundance pattern of the Milky-Way gas at
the time in which the rst stellar generations were formed By comparing abun-
dances of DLA systems at redshift z with abundances of Galactic stars formed
at look-back time tz we can test whether DLA galaxies undergo a chemical
evolution similar to that of the Milky Way The comparison between the two
sets of abundances can also be made at a given metallicity which measures the
level of chemical enrichment attained by each system
Metallicities The absolute abundance of zinc ZnH1 is generally used to
study the metallicities in DLA systems since zinc is expected to be unaected
by dust depletion Pettini et al 1997a 1999 Observed metallicities span
the interval 2  ZnH  0 with a column-density weighted mean value
ZnH  1 The metallicity distribution is dierent from that found in
the stellar populations of the Milky Way a result that casts doubts on the
relationship between high-z DLA systems and present-day spirals Pettini et al
1997b see however Wolfe  Prochaska 1998
Iron-peak abundances
Studies of metal-poor stars in the Galaxy indicate
that iron-peak elements trace each other with approximate solar ratios Ryan
Norris  Beers 1996 Deviations from the solar pattern can be present but
are generally negligible at the metallicity level of DLA absorbers The ZnFe
CrFe and NiFe ratios measured in DLA systems show signicant deviations
from the solar pattern inconsistent with those observed in metal-poor stars

Lu et al 1996 Pettini et al 1997a All these ratios follow the dierential
dust depletion pattern observed in the Milky Way interstellar gas Savage 
Sembach 1996 suggesting that the observed abundances are dominated by dust
depletion Section 23 The MnFe ratio is underabundant consistent with
that observed in metal-poor stars Lu et al 1996 however part of this eect
can also be ascribed to dust Vladilo 1998
Fe ratios The ratio between  and iron-peak elements is a well-known
tracer of galactic evolution In the Milky Way it decreases from the value Fe
 05 typical of metal-poor stars down to Fe  0 at higher metallicities
Wheeler Sneden  Truran 1989 The temporal delay between the metal injec-
tion from SNae Type II rich in  elements and SNae Type Ia rich in iron-peak
elements can explain the decrease of Fe in the course of evolution Mat-
teucci 1991 and refs therein The SiFe and SFe ratios in DLA systems
show overabundances which resemble Milky-Way metal-poor abundances Lu et
al 1996 However the result in itself is not conclusive since the SiFe and
SFe ratios are also enhanced in the nearby ISM as a consequence of dierential
depletion Savage  Sembach 1996 A way to obtain the intrinsic Fe ratio
is to select elements with negligible ISM depletions such as sulphur and zinc
which trace the  and the iron-peak elements respectively The few available
measurements give SZn  0 Molaro Centurion  Vladilo 1998 suggest-
ing that the enhancement of the SiFe and SFe ratios is due to dierential
depletion This suggestion is conrmed by a re-analysis of abundances in DLA
systems corrected for depletion Vladilo 1998 the resulting SiFe and SFe
Nature and evolution of Damped Lyman alpha systems
values are approximately solar Fig 1 consistent with the SZn results The
Magellanic Clouds Wheeler et al 1989 and BCGs Thuan Izotov  Lipovet-
sky 1995 are examples of galaxies with Fe  0 at low metallicity In general
any galaxy with low SFR at early epochs will be able to produce Fe  0 at
low metallicity because the onset of Type Ia SNae will occur before the galaxy
has time to attain solar metallicity Matteucci 1991
Nitrogen Nitrogen abundances can be used to probe the early stages of chem-
ical evolution However the relative importance of dierent production mech-
anisms  ie primary versus secondary production  is not fully understood
Matteucci Molaro  Vladilo 1997 Nitrogen abundances have been measured
in about ten DLA systems Molaro et al 1996 Lu Sargent  Barlow 1998
Centurion et al 1998 When the eects of dust are considered a substantial
fraction of NFe and NS ratios are lower than those observed in Galactic
metal-poor stars Centurion et al 1998 It is not possible to explain all the
observations with a unique production mechanism some cases suggest a sec-
ondary behaviour ie the nitrogen ratios increase with metallicity whereas
others show evidence of primary production ie the ratios are approximately
constant with metallicity Nitrogen ratios in DLA systems show similarities
with those measured in nearby metal-poor galaxies such as the NO ratios in
dwarf irregulars Kobulnicky  Skillman 1996 van Zee et al 1996 and the
NFe ratios in BCGs Thuan et al 1995
In one or two cases there is ev-
idence for an extremely high N ratio well above the values found in any
astrophysical site Molaro et al 1996
23 Dust
The rst evidence for dust in DLA systems was provided by a study of QSOs
with and without foreground DLA absorption Pei Fall  Bechtold 1991 The
optical spectral indices of the two samples are signically dierent and indicate
an enhanced reddening of the QSOs with intervening absorption The dust-to-
gas ratios k derived from this statistical study are typically between 5 and
20 of the Galactic value
The observation of dierent images of gravitationally lensed QSOs with
foreground DLA absorption is a powerful technique to study the dust properties
of the intervening galaxy The only case investigated up to now namely the zabs
 13911 system toward QSO 0957561 shows clear evidence of dierential dust
reddening between the two adjacent images of the QSO Zuo et al 1997 The
derived k is between 40 and 70 of the Galactic value
As mentioned above also the abundances of iron-peak elements provide
evidence for dust in DLA systems since the ZnFe CrFe and NiFe ratios
qualitatively follow the dust depletion pattern seen in the nearby interstellar
gas Savage  Sembach 1996 The observed pattern can be quantitatively
explained by assuming that the dust in DLA systems has same the composition
as in the Milky Way but with a dierent value of k in each system In fact one
can estimate the dust-to-gas ratio in each system from the condition that the
intrinsic iron-peak abundance ratios are solar Vladilo 1998 The resulting dust-
to-gas ratios show a large spread among dierent DLA absorbers with k values
mostly distributed between 2 and 25 of the Galactic value consistent with
Nature and evolution of Damped Lyman alpha systems
the range found by Pei et al 1991 In a given DLA system dust-to-gas ratios
estimated from dierent pairs of iron-peak elements yield consistent results as
expected from the basic assumption of the method Dust-to-gas ratios estimated
in this way are well correlated with metallicity Fig 2 in Vladilo 1998 The
existence of such a correlation and the evidence for dust obscuration described
in Section 31 indicate that the k values estimated indirectly from the iron-peak
abundances are indeed related to dust present in DLA systems
24 Kinematics
Kinematical properties are derived from the study of the line-of-sight velocity
dispersion of the systems determined from the proles of unsaturated metal
lines The HI gas is traced by low ions such as Si or Fe which have very
similar proles in each system and often show multiple absorption components
Since the line of sight samples the absorbers along random directions a large
number of observations is required to test models of DLA kinematics The
most extensive collection of velocity proles has been obtained by Prochaska
 Wolfe 1997 1998 by means of Keck observations The velocity widths
V  measured above a given threshold of optical depth range from about 50
km s1 up to 300 km s1 When multiple components are present the most
intense one is generally found at one edge of the prole These leading-edge
proles can be naturally produced by the intersection of a rotating disk with an
exponential gas density distribution Analysis of the full set of proles indicates
a consistency with models of fast-rotating Vrot  250 km s1 thick disks
a result supporting a relationship between high-z DLA systems and present-
day spirals models of slow-rotating low-mass galaxies are instead ruled out
Prochaska  Wolfe 1997 1998 However these conclusions are obtained by
assuming that all DLA systems are drawn from a homogeneous population of
galaxies an assumption probably incorrect given the observational evidence
shown in Table 1 In addition the conclusion that fast rotating disks are the only
viable explanation for the observed data has been disproved by Haehnelt et al
1998 According to these authors irregular protogalactic clumps can reproduce
the velocity proles distribution equally well The few proles with extremely
high values of V can be explained with occasional alignment of clumps at the
same redshift An argument against the hypothesis that DLA systems rotate at
Vrot  250 km s1 comes from an analysis of prole asymmetries performed by
Ledoux et al 1998 According to these authors there is evidence for regular
rotating disks only up to Vrot  120 km s1 while at higher velocities the
kinematics is more complex
Spin temperature
For DLA systems that lie in front of a radio loud quasar it is possible to observe
the 21 cm absorption in addition to the Ly  line An analysis of both spectral
ranges yields under suitable assumptions the harmonic mean along the line of
sight of the spin temperature of the gas  Ts  The typical values found in
DLA systems   Ts  103 K de Bruyn ODea  Baum 1996 Carilli et
al 1996  are generally much larger than those observed in the disk of the
Galaxy or in nearby spiral galaxies Braun 1997 and refs therein The higher
spin temperatures probably indicate that DLA galaxies have a larger fraction of
Nature and evolution of Damped Lyman alpha systems
warm gas than nearby spirals One approach to understanding this dierence
is through variation of the interstellar pressure the fraction of warm gas is
expected to be higher in regions where the mean pressure is lower Dickey 1995
Since the mean pressure is determined in part by the gravitational potential a
high fraction of warm gas could be a signature of gravitational potential lower
than in the Milky Way disk
Selection eects
Selection eects can alter the fraction of specic types of galaxies or particular
regions of galaxies detected in surveys of DLA systems Recognizing the role
of such eects is fundamental for a correct interpretation of the nature and
evolution of DLA galaxies
31 QSO obscuration
The absorbers with the highest dust content will obscure the background QSO
and will be missed from magnitude limited samples This eect of QSO extinc-
tion was rst investigated by Pei et al 1991 The possibility of determining the
dust-to-gas ratios k in individual systems allows us to estimate the importance
of the eect Vladilo 1998 Evidence for QSO obscuration comes an inspection
of Fig 2 DLA systems for which the product D  kNHI exceeds a critical
threshold are not observed D is an estimate of the dust content along the line
of sight and the tilted line in Fig 2 represents the D value that yields an extinc-
tion of 1 magnitude of the QSO in the observers frame Absorbers above this
line have probably not been detected because they obscure the QSO by more
than 1 magnitude Since dust and metals are strinctly linked one expects that
systems with high metallicity and high column density are missed due to the
same selection bias This eect has indeed been reported by Boisse et al 1998
As a consequence of QSO obscuration DLA absorbers with higher and
higher dust content or metallicity are only detectable at lower and lower values
of column density In particular present-day spirals with solar metallicity and
hence kkGal  1 can be missed when NHI  10207 cm2 according to the
trend shown in Fig 2 Dwarf or LSB galaxies which are characterized by lower
metallicities and dust content should be less aected by this selection bias
In addition LSB galaxies should be less aected because the column density
perpendicular to the disk is typically lower than in high surface brightness HSB
galaxies
Surface brightness
Dierences in surface brightness between galaxies can be understood if LSB
galaxies are hosted in dark halos with values of the spin parameter  larger
than those of HSB galaxies see Jimenez Bowen  Matteucci 1999 and refs
therein The cross-sections of individual galactic disks in equilibrium scale as
2 and therefore will be dominated by objects with large angular momentum
Mo Mao  White 1999 As a result LSB galaxies are expected to dominate
the cross-section for DLA absorption On the other hand HSB galaxies are
expected to dominate the rates of star formation and metal production

33 Galactocentric distance
The probability of detecting a galaxy in the interval of galactocentric distances
r r  dr is in general a function of r For a galactic disk seen face on the
dierential cross section for DLA absorption is dA  2r dr until NHI 
Nmin Therefore galactic regions with larger r have a higher probability of
detection unless the galaxy is seen exactly edge on Any property which shows
spatial gradients will be aected by this bias In particular our understanding
of chemical evolution properties of DLA systems will be biased since external
regions are less chemically evolved than inner regions
34 Gravitational lensing
The galaxy hosting the DLA system can act as a gravitational lens on the image
of the background QSO Smette Claeskens  Surdej 1997 have developed a
formalism to compute the eects of gravitational lensing by-pass eect and
amplication bias on the observed number density of DLA systems The by-
pass eect causes the line of sight to avoid the central part of the intervening
galaxy and to decrease its eective cross-section for absorption The amplica-
tion bias boosts the apparent magnitude of the QSO and therefore increases the
fraction of QSOs with foreground galaxies in magnitude-limited samples The
amplication bias acts in the opposite direction of dust obscuration However
in order to predict the overall eect one should model dust obscuration and
gravitational lensing in a self-consistent way It is interesting to note that both
Nature and evolution of Damped Lyman alpha systems
the by-pass eect and the galactocentric distance bias conspire to exclude
from the surveys the inner regions of galaxies ie the most chemically evolved
regions
Evolution of DLA systems
Detecting evolution eects in DLA systems is dicult for several reasons First
the low number of absorbers identied at low redshift represents a severe limi-
tation since z  165 corresponds to a look-back time of about 23 of the age
of the universe Second the selection eects mentioned in the previous sec-
tion imply that the observed samples are biased Third the samples are not
homogeneous since they can include galaxies of dierent morphological types
T  absolute magnitudes M  and redshifts of formation zf  moreover the line of
sight crosses the galaxy at a random radius r Therefore observations of any
physical quantity Q at dierent redshifts zabs will yield a data set of the type
Q  Qzabs T M zf  r where the redshift dependence of Q will be disguised
by uctuations induced by the other variables
41 Number density and comoving mass density
The number of absorbers per unit redshift interval is given by the product
of the absorber cross section A times the number density of absorbers per
comoving volume  The expression for a standard Friedmann universe

of intrinsic evolution   12 q  05 or   1 q  0 The work by
Lanzetta et al
1995 yields   115  055 consistent with no evolution
From a combined sample including DLA systems at z  4 Storrie-Lombardi
Irwin  McMahon 1996b nd   13  05 also consistent with no evolution
However these authors do nd evolution for the absorbers with NHI  1021
cm2 which show a decline at z  35 By combining the sample of DLA
systems with the constraints on present-day galaxies Rao Turnshek  Briggs
1995 nd   227  025 However this result should not be taken as evidence
for evolution until we understand clearly the link between DLA absorbers and
nearby galaxies
The mean comoving mass density of gas in DLA systems is given by
dlaz 
H  mH
c crit Z 
N f N z dN 
where  is the mean molecular weight of the gas crit is the current critical
density of the universe and f N z is the column density distribution function
see Storrie-Lombardi McMahon  Irwin 1996c and refs therein Analysis
of a sample including systems at z  4 indicates that dlaz increases from
z  0 to z  25 and apparently declines at z  35 Storrie-Lombardi et
al 1996c In the lowest redshift bin dlaz is roughly equal to the comoving
density of neutral gas derived from 21-cm emission surveys of nearby galaxies ie
Nature and evolution of Damped Lyman alpha systems
dlaz  064  21cm0 At the peak value dlaz is marginally consistent
with the mass density in stars in nearby galaxies ie dlaz  25  star0
These two facts suggest that the evolution of dlaz from the peak value to
the present-day value is governed by gas consumption due to star formation as
suggested by Wolfe et al 1995 However if the inequality dlaz  star0
holds true we are missing part of the gas responsible for the formation of present-
day stars This could be a consequence of the QSO obscuration bias which
aects the absorbers with highest column densities ie the absorbers that give
a dominant contribution to dlaz Eq3
A new study of DLA systems at low redshift suggests that dlaz could be
roughly constant from z  04 up to z  3 with dlaz  21cm0 Turnshek
1998 This nding would imply that the bulk of star formation took place only
relatively recently However the result must be considered with caution since
it is based on a very low number of systems and may also be aected by the
gravitational lensing bias Turnshek 1998
Jimenez Bowen  Matteucci 1999 have recently computed model pre-
dictions of dlaz for galaxies with low and high levels of surface brightness
According to these authors HSB galaxies consume neutral gas at a rate which
is too fast to explain the observed evolution of dlaz instead LSB galaxies
provide a good t to the data published by Storrie-Lombardi et al 1996c
42 Metallicity and abundance ratios
Metallicities are expected to increase in the course of evolution Measurements
of the ZnH ratio are now available for 40 DLA systems including 10 absorbers
at z  15 Pettini et al 1999 The analysis of this sample does not reveal ev-
idence for an increase with time the column-density weighted mean metallicity
is not signicantly higher at z  15 than at earlier epochs However the lack of
detection of evolution could be due to the inhomogeneity of the sample andor to
the presence of some selection bias The QSO obscuration bias may be responsi-
ble for missing systems of higher ZZ and higher column density Section 31
which are expected to give an important contribution to the metallicity at low
redshift The sample is inhomogeneous for studying the metallicity evolution in
the sense that ZZ depends on the SFR and on zf  two parameters that vary
in dierent types of galaxies in addition ZZ can vary with the galactocentric
distance r in a given galaxy
Even if evolution is not directly detected from the data model predictions of
metallicity evolution obtained for dierent types of galaxies yield results consis-
tent with the observations Lindner Fritze  Fricke 1998 Jimenez et al 1999
The models by Jimenez et al 1999 show explicitely the dependence of the
metallicity on zf and on r According to these models LSB galaxies formed at
zf  4 but not later t well the DLA metallicities HSB disks can account for
the observed data only if they form continuously in the interval 1  zf  4
The Fe ratio is expected to decrease in the course of chemical evolution
Section 22 Measurements of the SiFe ratio are available for almost 30 DLA
systems Lu et al 1996 Prochaska  Wolfe 1999 and for part of them it is
possible to perform the correction for dust depletion Vladilo 1998 The mean
corrected value is not signicantly lower at z  2 where SiFe 001007
dex than at z  2 where SiFe 010  009 dex Fig 1 The lack of
Nature and evolution of Damped Lyman alpha systems
evolution could be due to the inhomogeneity of the sample or to the presence
of some selection bias as in the case of the metallicity In fact all the selection
eects that alter the study of the metallicities will also aect the Fe ratio
which evolves with metallicity However the Fe ratios do not show evidence
for evolution even when plotted versus ZZ Vladilo 1998
43 Dust-to-gas ratios
The dust-to-gas ratios k estimated from the iron-peak abundances do not show
any trend with redshift This is consistent with the fact that k is very well
correlated with ZZ Fig 2 in Vladilo 1998 and the metallicity does not
evolve with redshift
Since metallicity is an indicator of chemical evolution the good correlation
between k and ZZ can be considered as evidence for evolution in DLA systems
The regular increase of the dust content with metallicity however constrasts
with the lack of any correlation with redshift We deduce that DLA systems do
evolve in a regular fashion but they attain a given level of metallicity or dust-
to-gas ratio at dierent redshifts This conclusion conrms that the sample of
DLA systems must include galaxies with dierent formation redshifts zf andor
dierent SFRs
44 Kinematics
From the analysis of a sample of 16 absorbers Ledoux et al 1998 nd that the
maximum V at a given z increases at lower redshifts This result if conrmed
would indicate that neutral regions exhibit increasingly faster motions with cos-
mic time However analysis of the set of 28 measurements of V obtained by
Prochaska  Wolfe 1997 1998 does not conrm the existence of such a trend
Wolfe  Prochaska 1998 nd that the maximum V measured at a given
ZnH increases with metallicity According to these authors this eect can
be explained by the passage of the lines of sight through rotating disks with
radial gradients in metallicity An alternative explanation is that DLA galaxies
with higher metallicities exhibit faster motions than DLA galaxies with lower
metallicities This interpretation would t nicely in a general trend of increasing
metallicity with increasing mass ie velocity dispersion
In any case the
statistics are still insucient to conrm the existence of this trend
Spin temperature
As mentioned in Section 25 the spin temperatures measured in high-z DLA sys-
tems are higher than those measured in present-day spirals The dierence could
be ascribed in principle to an eect of evolution However recent measurements
in two DLA systems at zabs  0221 and zabs  0091 yield  Ts   103K con-
sistent with the values found at high redshifts Chengalur  Kanekar 1999
This suggests that evolution may not be crucial and conrms that DLA galaxies
have properties intrinsically dierent from those observed in nearby spirals

Summary
The nature of the galaxies hosting DLA clouds is still a subject of debate How-
ever some important conclusions can be inferred by comparing the results ob-
tained from dierent observations At low redshifts candidate DLA galaxies in
the elds of the background QSOs show a variety of morphological types and
dierent levels of surface brightness Spirals are not the dominant contributors
contrary to the predictions based on the HI content of the nearby universe At
high redshift the hypothesis that DLA absorbers originate in protospirals is
not supported by spectroscopic studies of metallicities abundance ratios dust-
to-gas ratios and spin temperatures In particular Fe ratios and nitrogen
abundances hint at an origin in galaxies with properties similar to those ob-
served in nearby low-mass galaxies Studies of kinematics are consistent with
an origin both in massive disks proto-spirals and in low-mass galaxies
Evolution eects are generally not detected in DLA systems A possible
exception is the number density of NHI  1021 cm2 absorbers which seems
to decline at z  35 The comoving mass density dlaz apparently peaks at
z  25 and decreases at lower redshifts but this decrease is not corroborated
by recent observations At the peak value dlaz  star0 suggesting that we
are missing part of the gas responsible for the formation of present-day stars
Model predictions of LSB galaxies seem to better t dlaz than models of HSB
galaxies
Metallicities abundances ratios dust-to-gas ratios line-of-sight velocity dis-
persions and spin temperatures do not show evidence of redshift evolution As
a consequence the dierences between the properties of present-day spirals and
those of high-z DLA systems cannot be ascribed to evolutionary eects DLA
galaxies appear to be intrinsically dierent from nearby spirals
Dust production follows metal production in a very regular fashion in DLA
systems While this regular behaviour is proof of evolution the lack of any
correlation between metallicity and redshift suggests that DLA galaxies attain
a given level of metallicity at dierent cosmic epochs ie DLA galaxies must
have dierent formation redshifts zf andor dierent SFRs
Several selection eects conspire to bias the observed population of DLA
absorbers In particular high column density clouds located in environments
with relatively high metallicity can be missed owing to the QSO obscuration
eect This bias tends to decrease the fraction of spirals detected in the surveys
In general the contribution of the most chemically evolved galactic regions tends
to be underestimated On the other hand selection eects tend to favour the
detection of LSB galaxies and the fraction of low-mass galaxies does not seem
to be underestimated
In spite of their small sizes low-mass galaxies can be
detected if the faint end of the luminosity function is suciently steep Tyson
1988 a condition supported by results obtained at low z Zucca et al 1997
In conclusion DLA absorbers appear to be associated with a composite
population of galaxies without strong eects of evolution and with a prominent
representation of low-mass andor LSB galaxies A signicant number of massive
galaxies can be detected in absorption by increasing the statistics of DLA surveys
and by pushing the observational limits down to fainter magnitudes in order to
contrast selection eects
