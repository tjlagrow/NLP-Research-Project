Abstract We present a study of galaxy sizes in the local Universe as a function of galaxy
environment comparing clusters and the general eld Galaxies with radii and masses compa-
rable to high-z massive and compact galaxies represent 44 of all galaxies more massive than
3  1010M in the eld Such galaxies are 3 times more frequent in clusters than in the eld
Most of them are early-type galaxies with intermediate to old stellar populations There is a
trend of smaller radii for older luminosity-weighted ages at xed galaxy mass We show the
relation between size and luminosity-weighted age for galaxies of dierent stellar masses and in
dierent environments We compare with high-z data to quantify the evolution of galaxy sizes
We nd that once the progenitor bias due to the relation between galaxy size and stellar age is
removed the average amount of size evolution of individual galaxies between high- and low-z is
mild of the order of a factor 16

1 Introduction
Many recent observational studies have found a population of high-z z  1  25
massive M  1010M compact Re  2kpc galaxies eg Daddi et al 2005 Trujillo
et al 2006 Cimatti et al 2008 van Dokkum et al 2008 Saracco et al 2009 Cassata
et al 2011 and others In the great majority of these studies galaxies are selected to
be already passively evolving devoid of ongoing star formation at the redshift they are
observed Passive galaxies at high-z have been found to display a wide range in sizes
from extremely compact to those whose sizes are comparable to normal galaxies in the
local Universe Saracco et al 2009 Mancini et al 2010 Cassata et al 2011
Most high-z works use as local comparison the r-band Sloan median mass-size relation
for galaxies with Sersic index n  25 from Shen et al 2003 Trujillo et al 2009 and
Taylor et al 2010 searched for massive compact galaxies in Sloan and both found very
few such galaxies in the general eld at low redshift
Here we present a search for massive and compact galaxies in dierent environments at
low redshift using two galaxy samples for the general eld we use the Padova Millennium
Galaxy and Group Catalogue at z  00401 PM2GC Calvi et al 2011 and for galaxy
clusters the WIde-eld Nearby Galaxy cluster Survey at z  004 007 WINGS Fasano
et al 2006
Superdense galaxies with galaxy stellar masses and eective sizes similar to those of
2  3  109Mkpc2 were found to represent
high-z galaxies 50  05  M  Re
 20 of all galaxies with 3  1010  M  4  1011M in WINGS clusters based on
V-band images Valentinuzzi et al 2010 hereafter V10 Given the paucity of similar
galaxies in the eld studies mentioned above this suggested a strong environmental
dependence in the frequency of massive and compact galaxies at low-z V10
V10 and a number of other works Saracco et al 2011 Cassata et al 2011 Cappellari
et al 2012 and these proceedings to name a few also found that galaxy sizes depend
on the age of stars galaxies with older luminosity-weighted ages hereafter LW ages
are smaller As a consequence selecting the oldest galaxies at high-z those that have
already stopped forming stars at z  1  25 means selecting the most compact ones At
lower redshifts larger galaxies stop forming stars and enter the passive galaxy samples
causing the median mass-size relation to move to larger radii at xed mass Hence in
order to measure the correct amount of size evolution the sizes of high-z galaxies should
be compared only with those of galaxies whose LW age is so old that they were already
passive at high-z V10
Moreover in clusters at z  04  08 superdense galaxies are 40 of the galaxy
population and the mass-size relation in clusters evolves very little between z  06 and
z  0 Valentinuzzi et al 2010b
2 Results in the eld
Recently Poggianti et al 2012 submitted we have searched for massive compact
galaxies in the eld using the PM2GC a sample of low-z galaxies representative of the
general eld population drawn from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue MGC Liske et
al 2003 Driver et al 2005 We measured galaxy radii and galaxy morphologies with
GASPHOT Pignatelli  Fasano 2006 and MORPHOT Fasano et al 2012 respec-
tively from the MGC B-band images Size and stellar mass estimates are in very good
agreement with other existing measurements
After inspecting each superdense candidate we found 44 superdense galaxies out of
995 galaxies in the PM2GC corresponding to a fraction of 4407 among galaxies
with M  3  1010M The corresponding fraction in clusters from B-band WINGS
images is 11817 about half of the V-band percentage found by V10 This is due
to the small but systematic change of galaxy radii with wavelength with radii increasing
using bluer passbands
Most of the PM2GC superdense galaxies are red early-type galaxies 70 S0s and 23
ellipticals quite attened with a mean Sersic index n  28 and have intermediate-to-
old stellar populations with a mean LW age 55 Gyr and a mean mass-weighted age
93 Gyr
Figure 1 illustrates the relation between size and LW age for galaxies in dierent mass
bins and dierent environments for each galaxy mass the lower line is the PM2GC and
the upper line is WINGS At given size and environment more massive galaxies have
older ages both in clusters and in the eld following downsizing The plot shows that
at given mass and environment galaxies with smaller radii more compact are older
This eect is present both in clusters and in the eld although our analysis not shown
nds that the dependence of the median mass-size relation on stellar age is stronger in
clusters than in the eld
As a consequence the population of passive galaxies at low-z includes both the old on
average small galaxies and those galaxies that have stopped forming stars at later times
that have on average larger sizes This needs to be taken into account when trying to
quantify the evolution of the high-z samples
Evolution of galaxy sizes
21 Size evolution comparison with high-z studies
Figure 2 shows a compilation of various datasets of galaxies at z  1  25 dierent
symbols Daddi et al 2005 Trujillo et al 2006 van Dokkum et al 2008 Cimatti et al
2008 van der Wel et al 2008 Saracco et al 2009 Damjanov et al 2009 Mancini et al
2010 Cassata et al 2011 and their median mass-size relation solid line
To quantify the evolution in size we compare this relation with the median mass-size
relation of old LW age  10 Gyr galaxies in WINGS and the PM2GC two dotted lines
in Fig 2 We nd an average evolution of 02-025dex a factor 16-18 using WINGS
and PM2GC respectively This is half of what is found using all passive or n  25
galaxies in the PM2GC as usually done in the literature The evolution of galaxy sizes
is therefore much smaller than would be erroneously inferred at face value considering
as local descendants the whole passive galaxy population regardless of age
Using old WINGS or old PM2GC galaxies does not signicantly change the results It is
however important to stress that our simulations Millennium Simulation  semi-analytic
model presented in De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 predict that 60 of all galaxies that at
z  2 are massive  1011M and passive end up in haloes with masses above 1014M
by z  0 therefore in WINGS-like clusters in the local Universe Hence a large fraction
of the high-z passive and massive galaxies have evolved into todays cluster galaxies This
may explain the strong environmental dependence of the superdense incidence we nd
at low-z and indicates that galaxies in nearby clusters are the most appropriate local
counterparts to the high-z studies
