Abstract Old metal-poor globular clusters trace the formation and evolution of
early-type galaxies Their are the best probes at low redshift of the building-up of
galaxy halos at high redshift Their properties constrain the characteristics of their
progenitors Recent results suggest that DLAs at z  3 are the likely hosts for their
formation Finally they shed light on the old metal-poor halos probably present
around all early-type galaxies
Keywords early-type galaxy halo globular cluster
1 Why old metal-poor globular clusters
Old metal-poor globular clusters are excellent tracers for the formation
of galaxies see recent reviews by Ashman  Zepf 1998 Kissler-Patig
2000 Harris 2001 They are present in large numbers around all giant
galaxies studied to date and can therefore be used as a common tool
They are old  12  2 Gyr and thus witnessed the past since a time
corresponding to a high redshift z  3 somewhat dependent on the
cosmology They form as stars form ie understanding their epochs
of formation allows to study the star formation history of their host
galaxy Finally they are simple stellar populations easier to model
and to understand than the diuse stellar light of their host galaxies
Globular cluster sub-populations turned out to be very common
Zepf  Ashman 1993 and eg Gebhardt  Kissler-Patig 1999 To
rst approximation a typical globular cluster system shows two broad
sub-populations An old-metal poor sub-population is almost always
present as well as a more metal-rich old to intermediate age possibly
itself divided into sub-populations The properties of the latter resem-
ble those of the diuse stellar light Indeed the integrated light of early-
type galaxies appear to be dominated by the metal-rich component
Thus the old metal-poor globular clusters are a unique opportunity to
study the halo component of early-type galaxies otherwise dicult to
observe At the same time they allow to study at low-redshift the
building up at high redshift of early-type galaxies

2 The properties of the old metal-poor globular cluster
sub-populations
Only since the mid-90s studies investigate the properties of the vari-
ous sub-populations of globular clusters around early-type galaxies as
opposed to focusing on the general properties of the entire system
The rst dierence noticed in NGC 4472 between the red and
the blue sub-populations was their dierent density distributions
Geisler Lee  Kim 1996 The red clusters are signicantly more
concentrated towards the centre than the blue ones This is found to
be true in all other galaxies studied to date Furthermore the spa-
tial distributions also appear to dier Eg in NGC 1380 an S0
galaxy Kissler-Patig et al 1997 found the red clusters to follow the
ellipticity of the diuse light while the blue clusters where spherically
distributed Finally the kinematics of the two sub-populations were
found to dier systematically in the studied cases eg Kissler-Patig 
Gebhardt 1998 Zepf et al 2000 Cote et al 2001 In summary the
blue and the red globular clusters form two distinct sub-populations
from their properties and the blue metal-poor globular clusters have
halo properties
The metal-poor globular cluster also stand out with respect to their
sizes While the sizes of clusters in nearby galaxies were all found
to roughly correspond to the observed sizes in the Milky Way the
metal-poor clusters appear systematically larger than the metal-rich
ones at all galacto-centric radii eg Kundu  Whitmore 1998 Puzia
et al 1999 Larsen et al 2001 This result is interpreted as a imprint
from the time of formation hinting at the formation of metal-poor
clusters in shallower potential wells ie smaller fragments
The abundances and abundance ratios of old metal-poor clus-
ters are best studied using spectroscopy of clusters in nearby galaxies
All old-metal poor clusters are found to lie in the same region not only
in H  MgFe diagrams but also in Fe  Mg diagrams eg Kissler-
Patig et al 1998 Cohen et al 1998 Schroder et al 2001 This points
to very similar ages and -element ratios among all old metal-poor
clusters in the nearby universe including the Milky Way M31 and
Consequently the mean metalicity of the metal-poor globular
cluster sub-population in a given galaxy was found to be constant over
a large range of galaxy sizes morphologies and metalicity eg Ashman
 Bird 1993 Burgarella et al 2001 The properties of the metal-poor
sub-populations correlate only weakly if at all with their host-galaxy
properties

Old metal-poor halos around early-type galaxies
Finally the globular cluster luminosity function was show to be a
useful distance indicator especially when using only old-metal clusters
eg Kissler-Patig 2000 This in turn proves that the mass distribu-
tion of the globular clusters is universal and independent of the galaxy
properties again suggesting a formation process largely unrelated to
the nal host galaxy
The conclusion from the above is that old metal-poor globular clus-
ters are present in all observed early-type galaxies and have univer-
sal properties that do not depend or only weakly on the host galaxy
properties This suggests their formation in small fragments largely
independent of the nal host galaxy
3 On the nature of their progenitor fragments
The properties of old-metal poor globular clusters can constrain the na-
ture of their formation sites This was discussed by Burgarella Kissler-
Patig  Buat 2001 who identied damped lyman- systems DLAs
as likely sites for the formation of the old metal-poor globular clusters
Updating their result the ages of old metal-poor globular clus-
ters around 12  2 Gyr correspond to a redshift of formation of
z  4
15 in the current standard cosmology   03   07H0  70
kms1Mpc1 Comparing this with the latest abundance measure-
ments of DLAs eg Dessauges-Zavadsky et al 2001 indicates that
the mean abundance of DLAs at z  3 matches well the  150 solar
mean abundance of the old metal-poor globular clusters These DLAs
are thus likely to be the fragments in which one or more globular
clusters formed while DLAs at lower redshift might at least partly
belong to a dierent category of objects more evolved spirals
From the properties of the old metal-poor globular clusters we learn
the following on the nature of the fragments
 The fragments had metalicities between 10 FeH 25 dex
the range spanned by the old metal-poor clusters
 Their mass distribution is likely to have been a power-law of
slope around 2 transmitting this characteristic imprint to the mass
function of the globular clusters up to masses around 108 M The
high mass cut-o as judged from the largest dwarf galaxies hosting
metal-poor globular clusters only must have lied around 1091010M
 The fragments collapse at roughly z  3 without suering the
inuence of the nal host galaxies of which they formed the halos
later This way they probably enriched signicantly the intra-galactic
medium

4 Where are the old metal-poor stars in ellipticals
Clearly the presence of old metal-poor globular cluster sub-populations
calls for a stellar counter-part Where are the stars associated with this
halo population in early-type galaxies
There is good evidence that the old metal-poor globular clusters
formed with a very high specic frequency SN  20 ie have only
few stars associated with them while the metal-rich globular clusters
formed together with the vast majority of the stars low SN  12
This is supported i by the high specic frequency observed in dwarf
galaxies and halos dominated by old metal-poor globular clusters
ii by the relatively small amount of metal-poor stars contributing to
the integrated light of early-type galaxies see Maraston  Thomas
2000 Lotz et al 2000 iii by the direct comparison of the metal-poor
to metal-rich number ratios for stars and globular clusters in NGC
5128 the nearest giant elliptical Harris Harris  Poole 1999 While
the metal-rich stars vastly dominate in number the stellar population
metal-poor and metal-rich globular clusters appear in roughly similar
numbers
Therefore we expect only a small population of old metal-poor
stars associated with the old metal-poor globular clusters Such a
stellar population is dicult to detect within the diuse stellar light
dominated by the metal-rich stars
5 The formation of halos around early-type galaxies
In summary old metal-poor globular clusters form an independent
halo sub-population present in all galaxies Their properties suggest
a formation in small fragments identied with DLAs at z  3 This
implies that the metal-poor halos of giant ellipticals formed through the
assembly of mostly collapsed small fragments Their properties cor-
relate only weakly if at all with the host galaxy properties suggesting
that some fragments might have been inuence by the nal host galaxy
but many most formed as independent satellites
