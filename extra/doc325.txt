Abstract
We have observed the largest optical spectra sample of 74 blue compact galaxies
Stellar population properties of them were derived by comparing the equivalent
widths of strong absorption features and continuum colors using a method of em-
pirical population synthesis based on star cluster sample The results indicate that
blue compact galaxies are typically age-composite stellar system the continuum ux
fractions at 5870A due to old stellar components and young stellar components are
both important for most of the galaxies The stellar populations of blue compact
galaxies present a variety of characteristics and the contribution from dierent age
and metallicity components is dierent The star formation episodes are usually
short some galaxies maybe undergoing their rst global episode of star formation
while for the most sample galaxies older stars contribute to at most half the optical
emission Our results suggest that BCGs are old galaxies in which star formation
occurs in short intense burst separated by long quiescent phases

1 Introduction
Blue compact galaxies BCGs are characterized by their very blue
color compact appearance high gas content strong nebular emission
lines and low chemical abundances Detailed studies of BCGs are
important not only for understanding their intrinsic properties but
also for understanding star formation processes and galaxy evolution
in dierent environments To resolve the stellar components and better
constrain the star formation histories of BCGs we analyze the opti-
cal spectra of 74 BCGs with a Empirical Population Synthesis EPS
technique which has been pioneered by the work of Bica 1988 and
developed by the work of Cid Fernandes et al 2001
Our main goals are as follows 1 Resolve the stellar populations of
BCGs 2 Reconstruct the star formation histories of BCGs 3 Subtract
the underlying stellar absorption spectrum from the observed galaxy
spectrum and to obtain the emission line spectrum

2 Observations
We have observed optical spectra of 97 blue compact galaxies with the
216 m telescope at the XingLong Station of the Beijing Astronomical
Observatory BAO in China Kong  Cheng 2002 Using emission
lines of spectra 74 BCGs with narrow emission lines were classied
into star-forming galaxies SFG Kong et al 2002 The main goal
of this project is to measure the current star formation rates stellar
components metallicities and star formation histories and evolution
of BCGs therefore we are mainly interested in these 74 BCGs The
galaxy names were listed in Figure 1

31 Data and calculation
To resolve the stellar components of BCGs we have used the observed
equivalent width values of Ca iiK3933 H4102 CN4200 G band4301
H4340 Mg iMg h5176 absorption features the continuum uxes nor-
malized at 5870A at 3660 4020 4510 6630 and 7520A Kong et al
2002 and the empirical population synthesis method by Cid Fernandes
et al 2001 which is based on spectral group templates built from
star clusters and on Bayes theorem and the Metropolis algorithm
The output is the expected values of the fractional contribution Xi
of each stellar component to the total ux of galaxy at a reference
normalization wavelength such as 5870A
32 Stellar population
Age-grouped results of stellar population synthesis are plotted in Figure
1 XOLD made up from the sum of all base components with age  10
Gyr XINT corresponding to the 109 yr intermediate-age bin XYBC
standing for the contribution from the young blue stellar populations
107  108 yr and XHII containing the contribution of the power-law
component
A rst noticeable result in Figure 1 is that all BCGs show an un-
derlying old stellar population The presence of large fractions of old
components indicates that the star formation happened already at an
early stage and at a high rate It suggests that BCGs are old galaxies
The stellar populations of BCGs present a variety of characteristics
the dominant stellar population is dierent in dierent galaxies Some
BCGs have many young stellar populations However in others an
intermediate age stellar population makes an appreciable contribution

Empirical population synthesis for BCGs
Figure 1 Age-grouped synthetic population vector for the 74 BCGs The number in
the horizontal axis represents dierent age-grouped stellar population The vertical
axis shows the percentage contributions of these age-grouped populations Empty
histograms represent the ux fractions at 4020A and lled histograms correspond
to the ux fractions at 5870A respectively
Based on the stellar populations we found BCGs while sharing
some common global properties in fact exhibit a great diversity in the
star formation histories SFH The SFH of BCGs is more complex
than we thought we cannot use unication SFH to all BCGs
33 Synthesized spectra
In Figure 2 as an example we plotted the empirical population syn-
thesis results for 2 galaxies in our sample OBS represents the ob-
served spectrum of galaxy SYN represents the synthetic spectrum
was constructed using the star cluster templates and the EPS results
OBS-SYN resulting from subtracting SYN from OBS
The gure shows that the synthesized spectrum gives a good t
to the observed continuum and absorption lines for each galaxy It
suggested that the main energy sources of BCGs are young hot O B
stars which lead to the formation of HII regions around them Another
apparent character in Figure 2 is the absorption wing of H and H in

The emission line spectrum appears in the OBS-SYN dierence in the lower part
of the gure
observed spectrum was tted very well by the synthetic spectrum We
can use this synthetic spectrum to subtract the underlying stellar ab-
sorption from emission line spectrum Therefore the stellar subtracted
spectra should be very useful for further investigation of physical con-
ditions and chemical abundance of the emission line regions of BCGs
and will be used to accurate determine the element abundance and star
formation rate of BCG
