Abstract Major progress has been made over the last few years in understanding hydrody-
namical processes on cosmological scales in particular how galaxies get their baryons There is
increasing recognition that a large part of the baryons accrete smoothly onto galaxies and that
internal evolution processes play a major role in shaping galaxies  mergers are not necessarily
the dominant process However predictions from the various assembly mechanisms are still in
large disagreement with the observed properties of galaxies in the nearby Universe Small-scale
processes have a major impact on the global evolution of galaxies over a Hubble time and the
usual sub-grid models account for them in a far too uncertain way Understanding when where
and at which rate galaxies formed their stars becomes crucial to understand the formation of
galaxy populations I discuss recent improvements and current limitations in resolved mod-
elling of star formation aiming at explicitely capturing star-forming instabilities in cosmological
and galaxy-sized simulations Such models need to develop three-dimensional turbulence in the
ISM which requires parsec-scale resolution at redshift zero

1 Cosmological hydrodynamics the growth of galaxies
Dark matter-only simulations have long been the main tool of numerical cosmologists
They have drown a picture of galaxy formation in which mass assembly is mostly driven
by the gradual merging of small dark matter halos into larger ones the galaxies ie the
baryons are a relatively passive component that follows this hierarchical growth of dark
halos Cosmological simulations can now directly model the evolution of the baryons
not only in the so-called zoom simulations towards a single chosen galaxy but also in
large-scale simulations covering hundreds of Mpc such as the Marenostrum simulation
by Teyssier and collaborators Such simulations have revealed a richer picture of galaxy
assembly not purely hierarchical and not driven only by the dark matter structures
Baryons do not all lie within galaxies and halos but also form long laments along the
cosmic web which gather a large fraction of the gas even at moderate redshift z1-2
These reservoirs continuously supply gas into galaxies For small galaxies in low-mass
halos infalling gas is accelerated but the ow remains subsonic in the hot gas that lls
the halo this hot halo gas coming for instance from stellar winds is at T 1067K with
cs  100300 kms The infalling gas thus remains relatively cold 1045K and directly
fuels the central galactic disk Around massive galaxies infalling gas reaches supersonic
velocities and is shock-heated to the viral temperature 1067K by this virial shock
which typically stabilizes near the virial radius of the dark halo These cold accretion vs
hot accretion modes have been proposed by Birnboim  Dekel 2003 and detailed in
the simulations of Keres et al 2005 the cold mode supplies blue star-forming galaxies
while the hot mode could result in red and dead objects
Gas infall is not limited to pure cold and hot modes Cold ows in hot halos could be a

 Pichon The main galaxies
in this image are around L
and all have bulgedisk ratios
around unity There is a clear
lack of bulgeless or disk-domi-
nated galaxies but also a lack of
real ellipticals even in Marenos-
trum groups and proto-clusters
Sub-grid recipes that would re-
duce the bulge fraction in all
galaxies are not a satisfactory
answer to the whole diversity of
galaxy populations
more general mode Simulations by Kravtsov et al presented in Dekel  Birnboim 2006
suggest that cold gas streams at high redshift are dense enough to penetrate the hot gas
halo They directly reach the central galaxy in the form of cold unshocked gas ows
collimated in the hot halo The ubiquity of this mode for massive galaxies was further
pointed out in the Marenostrum simulation Ocvirk et al 2008 The number density
of such stream-fed galaxies in the simulation matches the observed comoving density of
star-forming galaxies at z  2 Dekel et al 2009 Cold streams in hot halos could be
an important growth mode even for relatively low-mass galaxies as shown by the Nut
simulation see Powell et al this meeting This supports an emerging picture in which
Milky Way-like galaxies get most of their mass from cold accretion Major mergers are
relatively unfrequent Genel et al 2008 Even small incoming halos ie minor mergers
account only a small fraction of the total infalling mass so a substantial part of the infall
should be quite smooth Genel et al 2010 The mass brought in as baryonic clumps in
dark halos ie major and minor mergers probably represents on average one third of
the baryonic supply onto  L galaxies Brooks et al 2009 Keres et al 2009
The dominance of mergers or smooth accretion should depend on mass The galaxy
mass function roughly as steep as the dark halo mass function at low masses and becomes
much shallower at high masses Hopkins et al 2010 In the low-mass regime this implies
that galaxy mergers are generally minor ones having two merging galaxies with similar
masses requires two haloes of similar masses which is unlikely so cold accretion could
dominate But for very massive galaxies above L the galaxy masses grow more slowly
than the halo masses because of some debated quenching mechanism When two
big halos of dierent masses merge together their galaxies have more similar masses
and galaxy mergers thus tend to be relatively major ones giant elliptical galaxies likely
mostly assembled through violent mergers
The formation of dwarf galaxies with stellar masses around 109 M largely driven by
cold gas accretion and feedback processes can be relatively well understood Governato et al
2010 and Brook this meeting Giant elliptical galaxies are also relatively well under-
stood as resulting from numerous early mergers and several possible quenching mech-
anisms Naab et al 2007 Johansson et al 2009 Martig et al 2009 Things are much
more complicated for galaxies in the L regime where the combination of cold accretion
mergers feedback processes and internal evolution is richer This regime encompasses a
large diversity of galaxy types from bulgeless rotating disks to slowly-rotating ellipti-
cals While environmental eects play an important role they cannot explain the bulk
diversity of galaxies there are eld ellipticals and galaxies with very low bulge fractions

in groups as well such as M33 in the Local group Explaining the diversity of L galax-
ies remains a major challenge the toughest part likely being to explain the survival of
bulgeless pure disk galaxies For instance all Marenostrum galaxies at L are bulgy
galaxies say S0 or Sa Fig 1 It is known that all simulations of this type lack bulgeless
galaxies but it is interesting to note that they lack elliptical galaxies at the same time
2 Milky Way progenitors in the early Universe
Since the formation of todays  L galaxies cannot be directly understood from
cosmological simulations let us examine the properties of their progenitors at redshift
z  2 when they contained only half of their present mass focusing on normally star-
forming galaxies rather than strong starbursts Optical surveys can decently resolve the
morphology of L galaxies at z 2 An extensive study was performed by Elmegreen
Elmegreen and collaborators 20042009 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field UDF Most
star-forming galaxies around L at z  1 are very clumpy with giant clumps that do not
resemble the star-forming clouds or GMCs of nearby spiral galaxies Fig 2 These high-z
galaxies are most often clumpy disks rather than multiple mergers Giant clump masses
can reach 1089 MSpectroscopic surveys study the resolved kinematics of ionized gas
eg Forster Schreiber et al 2009 Epinat et al 2009 They have conrmed that the
majority of normally star-forming objects in the young Universe are large rotating disks
with giant H clumps and suggest strong ISM turbulence with 1D dispersions of a
few tens of kmsMolecular gas observations of normally star-forming galaxies at z  1
Daddi et al 2010 Tacconi et al 2010 have revealed high gas fractions typically 50
of the baryons at z  2 with most of the gas most in dense molecular form Relatively low
excitations and Milky Way-like conversion factors are supported by dynamical arguments
Daddi et al 2010 and observations of CO SEDs Dannerbauer et al 2009
Gas-rich turbulent clumpy disks thus appear to represent the bulk of normally star-
forming galaxies at z  1 The giant clumps likely result from gravitational Jeans
instability in gas-rich disks with a Toomre parameter Q below or close to unity owing
to low spheroid fractions and strong turbulence maintains a high Jeans mass typical
clump mass Bournaud  Elmegreen 2009
3 Internal evolution in primordial high-redshift galaxies
Models of internal dynamics of clumpy disk galaxies were studied in Bournaud et al
2007a among others These clumps are massive enough to undergo tidal torquing and
friction and migrate inwards in a few disk rotation periods They can form a bulge with
properties typical for classical bulges at least in massive galaxies The clumps loose a

distribution dominated by a few gi-
ant clumps A zoom on a giant clump
shows sub-clumps and shocks This gi-
ant complex is overall supported by frag-
mentation and internal turbulence and
some internal rotation This prevents the
whole complex from reaching very high
average gas densities and high star for-
mation eciencies which could leave it
long-lived against stellar feedback
substantial fraction of their stars via tidal eects and maybe some gas through feedback
processes The released material can form an exponential disk The pre-existing stars can
be stirred in a very thick stellar disk which can be hot enough to remain thick down to
z0 even if mass infall continues to fuel the thin disk Bournaud et al 2009
Rapid internal evolution with bulge formation by giant clump instabilities in high-
redshift disks has now been reproduced with various codes and in cosmological simu-
lations Agertz et al 2009a Ceverino et al 2010 A major unknown is the survival of
the giant clumps to star formation feedback in particular radiative pressure from young
stars Murray et al 2010 Krumholz  Dekel 2010 have shown that giant clumps will
survive if they do not collapse into small superdense objects that would form stars too
rapidly and undergo too strong feedback This seems to be the case in observations
but measurements at the scale of clumps remain uncertain This is also the case in
AMR disk simulations Fig 3 where the giant star-forming complexes form many sub-
clumps and remain supported by internal turbulence and rotation instead of collapsing
Burkert et al 2009 Elmegreen  Burkert 2010 further suggest that the strong turbu-
lence in high redshift galaxies is mostly driven by the gravitational instabilities not by
feedback processes Burkert 2009 has shown simulations where the main source of tur-
bulence was a strong disruptive feedback but the result was not to disrupt the giant
clumps after they formed but to completely inhibit their formation which is not con-
sistent with observations There are probably observed signatures of feedback but they
may leave the largest and densest clumps relatively unaected Lehnert et al 2009
4 Galaxy mergers and the disk survival issue
The survival of disk galaxies remains a major issue even if a large part of the mass
comes from smooth ows galaxies should undergo a signicant number of mergers The
survival of massive disk galaxies with low bulge fractions remains misunderstood Even
if giant clumps and subsequent bulge formation at high redshift did not aect galax-
ies much merger-induced bulge formation alone seems inconsistent with the observed
fractions of bulges Weinzirl et al 2009
There have been claims that disks can survive or re-form in high-redshift mergers
because these mergers involve very high gas fractions eg Robertson et al 2006 Some
results were even called spiral galaxies Springel  Hernquist 2005 because a large
rotating gas disk was found but more than 50 of the baryons were actually in a stellar
bulge or spheroid after the merger this is not typical for a spiral galaxy A more
general issue is that mergers have never been studied in realistic high-redshift conditions
because the employed techniques have always modeled a warm stable and smooth gas
The real ISM especially in high-redshift galaxies is highly unstable and supported by
Galaxy formation hydrodynamics
supersonic turbulence in cold gas Real mergers at z2 with high gas fractions may thus
be fundamentally dierent and much more dissipative than existing models Disk survival
is uneasy with a turbulent heterogeneous ISM Bournaud et al 2010b
5 ISM physics in galaxy formation
Star-forming regions are not just substructures that emit most of the visible light They
have major consequences on disks and bulges at high redshift and a signicant impact in
mergers too Bois et al 2010 Teyssier et al 2010 The crucial role of the heterogeneous
cloudy and turbulent ISM and clustered star formation in global galaxy properties has
also been pointed out in recent cosmological simulations In low-mass dwarf galaxies this
can preserve bulgeless galaxies Brook this meeting More massive galaxies in the L
regime still have too massive bulges and spheroids in cosmological models but recent
work has shown that the physics of ISM turbulence clustered star formation and stellar
evolution may strongly reduce the predicted bulge fractions eg Semelin  Combes
2005 Piontek  Steinmetz 2009 Martig  Bournaud 2010 Nevertheless as pointed
out by Agertz et al 2010 too many free parameters in sub-grid models prevent robust
predictions and explicitly resolving the main star forming regions is needed
6 Resolved star formation in cosmological and galaxy-sized models
Galaxy formation models need to directly resolve the largest scales of star formation a
few giant clumps in high-redshift galaxies and a few tens of GMCs that drive the bulk of
the star formation in the Milky Way In theory the formation of GMCs is probably initi-
ated by gravitational instabilities in turbulent gas Elmegreen 2002 Krumholz  McKee
2005 which should be relatively simple to model However resolving star formation
is not achieved so easily in galaxy formation models
In cosmological simulations none of the recent and supposedly high-resolution models
resolves the main star formation regions at z  0 Models by Agertz et al or Governato et
al show an heterogeneous ISM which mainly results from supernovae feedback creating
empty bubbles and higher-density regions But high densities of thousands of atomscm3
are not reached and cloud-forming instabilities are absent Things are a bit easier at
redshift z  1 with giant clumps of star formation They have been directly captured in
cosmological simulations Agertz et al 2009a Ceverino et al 2010 They have not been
resolved though these giant clumps survive feedback because they keep a relatively
low density and hence a relatively low star formation eciency Maybe this is how a real
clump would be but the resolution limit may induce a severe bias The smallest cell size
in Ceverino et al is 70 pc and the thermal Jeans length has to be kept larger than a
few cells the total thermalturbulent Jeans length being necessarily even larger say
around 500 pc A star-forming clump could not become much more compact extremely
dense very eciently star-forming and rapidly disrupted by feedback It cannot fragment
into sub-clumps and become supported by internal turbulence but remains largely sup-
ported by the resolution limit instead Only isolated disk simulations directly resolving
the internal fragmentation of such giant clumps is directly resolved and their internal
turbulent support so that their internal density distribution and resulting eciency in
a given star formation scheme can be directly resolved see Fig 3
Resolving star-forming clouds at redshift zero is harder even in idealized isolated
galaxy simulations with box sizes of a few tens of kpc Recent works have studied the
formation of GMCs via cooling and gravitational instabilities in a galactic disk eg
Li et al 2005 Agertz et al 2009b Tasker  Tan 2009 They have highlighted the role
F Bournaud
Figure 4 Zoom on a GMC in a simulation of a whole galaxy including gas stars and dark
matter from Bournaud et al 2010a The left panel shows the gas density over a portion of
300  300 pc in the face-on disk The whole disk has a log-normal density PDF the right panel
shows the PDF for the single GMC shown to the left it has a log-normal shape with a signicant
high-density tail The high-density tail is where star formation takes place
of gravity and turbulence in driving GMC formation However these simulation do not
resolve the GMC properties for instance the typical radius of a GMC in the Tasker 
Tan model is around 20 pc for an AMR cell size of 7 pc The outer parts of these GMCs
are supported by rotation around the central core with a mini-spiral shape unlike real
GMCs and the internal regions are supported by the resolution limit ie by the thermal
pressure oor that maintains the thermal Jeans length larger than a few cells While the
mass of these GMCs could be realistic their properties such as the gas density distribution
or local free-fall time cannot be trusted Then assuming a given star formation recipe
on small scales Schmidt law or any other the resulting star formation activity in each
cloud cannot be robustly predicted
Nevertheless all these simulations have nicely shown that GMC formation is proba-
bly mostly driven by ISM turbulence and gravity We recently went one step further
and demonstrated the properties of gas clouds can be directly resolved in simulations
of whole galaxies including their size density distribution and internal turbulence
Bournaud et al 2010a and Fig 4 The average Jeans scale length sets the disk scale
height Starting from this most unstable scale a 3D turbulence cascade takes place The
turbulence cascade forms denser gas regions some of which become gravitationally unsta-
ble and collapse into dense clouds with local densities reaching 1056 cm3 This occurs
mainly in regions already compactied by stellar arms or bars which traces the coupled
instability of gas and stars in a bi-component disk see also Yang et al 2007 Owing
to a very high spatial and mass resolution 08 pc and 5  103 M the model shows
GMCs that stopped collapsing well before the resolution limit and inside which dense
sub-clouds bubbles and numerous structures with chaotic motions are directly resolved
A single GMC is shown on Fig 4 its PDF is log-normal with a substantial excess of high-
density gas consistently with observations of nearby GMCs Lombardi et al 2010 Star
formation in the model takes place above 5000 cm3 which is about the high-density
tail of the GMC PDF When collapsing this GMC evacuated most of its angular mo-
mentum by fragmenting and expulsing some substructures and at the observed instant
is dominated by internal turbulent motions
The process is almost entirely driven by turbulence and gravity but feedback is essen-
tial to maintain a steady state distribution Without feedback all gas mass will eventu-
ally end-up at the smallest scales of the turbulence cascade in superdense bullets at the
resolution limit Feedback regulates the process by disrupting dense structures on the
smallest scales and refuelling a turbulent steady state through larger-scale instabilities
This does not seem strongly aected by the hypothesis done on feedback and adding
HII region and radiative pressure feedback to supernovae feedback models could some-
what decrease the lifetime of gas clouds but would not change the main properties of
Galaxy formation hydrodynamics
the ISM density distribution that are primarily controlled by the gravity-driven turbu-
lence cascade Although the small-scale substructures inside GMCs are probably still
far from realistic magnetic eects should eventually become important it seems that
the main GMC properties can be correctly modeled in simulations of whole galaxies or
cosmological simulations provided that
 The spatial resolution reaches about 1 pc the gas disk scale height must be accurately
resolved to capture a 3D turbulence cascade in the ISM because there is no such cascade
in 2D A few resolution elements per scale height are not enough One must resolve several
Jeans length per disk scale height so that instabilities can arise over-densities above and
below the mid-plane and drive a vertical component of turbulent motions As the thermal
Jeans length itself is described by at least a few resolution elements to prevent articial
fragmentation and the total thermalturbulent Jeans length is substantially larger  at
least 10-20 resolution elements for supersonic turbulence This implies that the gas disk
scale height has to be resolved with say 100-200 resolution elements the resolution for
gravity and hydrodynamics for a typical z  0 galaxy needs to be around 1 pc
 Star formation and energy feedback of some sort is included so as to maintain a
steady turbulent state where clouds do not all collapse down to the resolution limit
 Long-range gravitational forcings from old stellar populations are included spiral
density waves bars etc Large-scale structures do participate to the turbulence cascade
down to small scales and the contribution of all stars to the disk stability in a combined
Qgasstars parameter is about as important as that from the gas itself
These requirements could in theory be achieved with any code but in practice are
probably easier to reach with oct-tree AMR codes such as RAMSES Teyssier 2002
grid renements over complex systems such as GMCs in a spiral disk are optimized
compared to patch-based and multi-grid techniques
7 Conclusions
While the assembly of baryons into galaxies seems relatively well understood on large
scales the properties of galaxies in the simulations are still far from matching those of
observed galaxy populations There is increasing evidence that small-scale processes such
as ISM turbulence fragmentation clustered star formation are crucial to understand
galaxy formation in particular in the primordial high-redshift phases They can have
major eects on the global properties of each galaxy and even on the global cosmological
evolution of baryons For instance temptative explanations of the downsizing in the -
CDM paradigm rely on AGN feedback Scannapieco et al 2005 Di Matteo et al 2008
However AGN fueling involves on a number processes inside the central kpc of galaxies
that are completely unresolved in cosmological models nuclear bars resonnances nuclear
starbursts mass loss from clusters etc see Combes 2001
Recent results and objective criteria to capture and correctly resolve the main star-
forming regions of galaxies have been presented They are unfortunately not reached in
present-day cosmological simulations especially at redshift zero but recent improvements
have been made in accounting for the multiphase ISM in galaxy formation models
