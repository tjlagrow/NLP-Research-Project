Abstract We discuss the accuracy of the abundance determinations of H ii regions
in our Galaxy and other galaxies We focus on the main observational constraints
derived from abundance determinations that have implications for models of galactic
chemical evolution a the helium to hydrogen abundance ratio HeH b the oxygen
to hydrogen abundance ratio OH c the carbon to oxygen abundance ratio CO
d the helium to oxygen and helium to heavy elements abundance ratios Y O
and Y Z and e the primordial helium abundance Yp
1 Introduction
The H ii region abundances provide important observational constraints
to test models of stellar evolution models of the chemical evolution of
galaxies and models of the evolution of the universe as a whole
Reviews on the abundances of Galactic and extragalactic H ii regions
have been presented before e g Peimbert 1993 1999 Garnett 1999
Henry  Worthey 1999
2 Temperature dierences and abundance determinations
From emission line spectra of Galactic and extragalactic H ii regions it
is possible to determine abundance ratios good quality spectra usually
permit to derive electron temperatures like TeO iii and TeN ii from
the O iii 43635007 and N ii 57556584 line ratios
Often only TeO iii is available and to estimate the temperature
of the regions of low degree of ionization photoionization models have
been used For example to determine TeO ii Izotov et al 1997
Izotov  Thuan 1998 and Deharveng et al 2000 have used the
models by Stasinska 1990 that provide a TeO iii versus TeO ii
relationship Photoionization models have been used also to estimate
the ionization correction factor for those elements that have not been
observed in all the stages of ionization present in the nebulae
There are other methods to determine the electron temperature like
the ratio of the Balmer continuum to a Balmer line the ratio of He iH i

lines and the ratio of recombination lines of C ii and O ii to forbidden
lines of C iii and O iii these other methods usually yield electron
temperatures substantially smaller than those provided by TeO iii
eg Peimbert 1967 Peimbert et al 1993 1995 Liu et al 2000
Several explanations have been proposed for the Te dierences the
main ones are temperature variations density variations and chem-
ical inhomogeneities eg Peimbert 1967 1971 Torres-Peimbert et
al 1990 Viegas  Clegg 1994 Liu et al 2000 Recent discussions
on this subject have been presented by Peimbert 1995 Stasinska
1996 1998 2000 and Liu et al 2000
Detailed photoionization models of I Zw 18 NGC 2363 and NGC 346
yield TeO iii values from 10 to 15 smaller than observed proba-
bly indicating that there are additional heating sources not considered
by the models like the deposition of mechanical energy Stasinska 
Schaerer 1999 Luridiana et al 1999 Relano  Peimbert 2000
The dierences in Te should be taken into account to derive accurate
abundance ratios
3 HeH
To derive accurate HeH abundance ratios it is necessary to use ac-
curate temperatures and densities Due to the collisional contribution
to the He i line intensities the higher the density the lower the com-
puted HeH ratio Due to the density variations present in H ii regions
it is well known that Nerms is smaller than the densities derived
from the ratio of two forbidden lines in general it can be shown that
e local where  is the lling factor and
for giant extragalactic H ii regions is typically of the order of 001
Consequently the use of Nerms yields a higher limit to the HeH
e rms  N 2
e local  N 2
For some objects only the Ne derived from the S ii lines is available
and therefore the NeS ii density has been used to determine the
HeH ratio Izotov et al 1994 pointed out that the region where the
S ii lines originate is not representative of the region where the He i
lines originate and proposed to determine self consistently the density
from ve of the best observed He i lines adopting TeO iii as the
representative temperature for the regions where the He i and H i lines
originate
Most HeH determinations have been made by adopting TeO iii
TeO iii provides us with an upper limit to TeHe ii for the two
following reasons a for metal poor H ii regions TeO iii  TeO ii
and the He i lines originate both in the O iii and the O ii zones b even
peimbert-mtex 5022008 533 p2
Abundances Derived from H ii Regions
if the O iii and the He i lines originate in the same zone in the presence
of temperature variations it can be shown that TeO iii  TeHe ii
Peimbert et al 2000a from nine He i lines of NGC 346 the bright-
est H ii region in the Small Magellanic Cloud derived self-consistently
NeHe ii HeH and TeHe ii They derived a TeHe ii value 9
smaller than TeO iii The maximum likelihood method implies that
the lower the temperature the higher the density and the lower the
derived HeH ratio this is a systematic eect and implies that the HeH
ratios derived from TeO iii are upper limits to the real HeH value
From photoionization models of giant H ii regions based on CLOUDY
Ferland 1996 it is found that TeHe ii is from 3 to 12 smaller
than TeO iii Peimbert et al 2000c
The abundances of the Sun and the Orion nebula have been used
as probes of Galactic chemical evolution and as standards for stars
and gaseous nebulae of the solar vicinity Therefore it is important to
compare them since they have been derived using dierent methods
A decade ago the OH dierence between the Sun and the Orion
nebula in the literature amounted to 044dex at present the dierence
is only of 011dex see Table I The change is due to two recent results
for Orion and one for the Sun a the 015dex increase in the OH
value derived from recombination lines which implies a t2  0024
relative to that derived from forbidden lines under the assumption of
t2  0000 b the increase of 008dex due to the fraction of oxygen
embedded in dust grains and c the decrease of 010dex due to a new
solar determination

intermediate mass stars in combination with yields for massive stars by Woosley 
Weaver 1995 and Woosley et al 1993 Portinari et al 1998 or Maeder 1992
To derive the total OH values in H ii regions it is necessary to
estimate the fraction of O embedded in dust grains For the Orion
nebula and NGC 346 the brightest H ii region in the SMC it is found
that FegasOgas is 12  03dex smaller than in the Sun Esteban et
al 1998 Relano  Peimbert 2000 Grevesse  Sauval 1998 For the
Orion nebula and for O poor extragalactic H ii regions it is found that
SigasOgas is 04601dex and 03901dex smaller respectively than in
the Sun Esteban et al 1998 Garnett et al 1995a Grevesse  Sauval
1998 From the SiO and FeO underabundances in H ii regions it is
estimated that the missing Si and Fe fractions are in dust grains in the
form of molecules that trap about 20 of the oxygen atoms
The observed CO ratios are important to test the dierent sets of
stellar yields present in the literature and the importance of the O-rich
galactic outows
The increase of CO with the age of the disk at the time the stars of
the solar vicinity were formed is due only to the ejecta of massive stars
Models with yields by Maeder 1992 or yields by Portinari et al 1998
can reproduce the increase of CO with age in the solar neighborhood

In Figure 1 we present the evolution of CO with time for three

as well as the CO values for a group of dwarf stars of dierent ages
From chemical evolution models of the Galaxy Carigi 2000 nds

negative CO gradients while those based on the yields by Woosley

ity Copi 1997 derives values of Y O in the 24 to 34 range Carigi
2000 computed chemical evolution models for the Galactic disk under
an inside-out formation scenario based on dierent combinations of
seven sets of stellar yields by dierent authors the Y O spread
predicted by her models is in the 29 to 46 range for the Galactocentric
distance of M17 59 kpc the spread is only due to the use of dierent
stellar yields For massive stars Y O increases along the sequence
Portinari et al 1998  Maeder 1992  Woosley  Weaver 1995
while for intermediate mass stars it increases along the sequence van
den Hoek  Groenewegen 1997  Renzini  Voli 1981  Marigo et
al 1996 The dierences between all the models and the observations
for t2  0000 are signicant while the dierences between some of the
models and the observations for t2  0037 probably are not
From a group of 10 irregular and blue compact galaxies Carigi et
al 1995 found Y O  448  102 where they added 02 dex
to the OH abundance ratios derived from the nebular data to take
into account the temperature structure of the H ii regions and the
fraction of O embedded in dust moreover they also estimated that O
constitutes 54 of the Z value Izotov  Thuan 1998 from a group
of 45 supergiant H ii regions of low metalicity derived that Y Z

Abundances Derived from H ii Regions
23  10 we nd from their data that Y Z  146  060 by adding
02 dex to the O abundances to take into account the temperature
structure of the H ii regions and the fraction of O embedded in dust
furthermore from their data we also nd that Y O  27  12 by
assuming that O constitutes 54 of the Z value
Carigi et al 1995 based on yields by Maeder 1992 computed
closed box models adequate for irregular galaxies obtaining Y O 
295 They also computed models with galactic outows of well mixed
material that yielded Y O values similar to those of the closed
box models and models with galactic outows of O-rich material that
yielded values higher than 295 The maximum Y O value that can
be obtained with models of O-rich outows without entering into con-
tradiction with the CO and Z  C  OO observational constraints
amounts to 35
Carigi et al 1999 based on yields by Woosley et al 1993 and
Woosley  Weaver 1995 computed chemical evolution models for
irregular galaxies and found very similar values for closed box mod-
els with bursting star formation and constant star formation rates
that amounted to Y O  42 The models with O-rich outows
can increase the Y O but they predict higher CO ratios than
observed
O-rich outows are not very important for the typical irregular
galaxy because they predict CO and ZO ratios higher than observed
Larsen et al 2000 reach the same conclusion based on models to
explain the NO ratios

7 Primordial Helium Abundance Yp
Recent discussions on the determination of Yp have been presented by
Thuan  Izotov 2000 and Peimbert  Peimbert 2000 Izotov 
Thuan 1998 from the Y  OH linear regression for a sample of 45
BCGs and Izotov et al 1999 from the average for the two most
metal decient galaxies known I Zw 18 and SBS 0335052 derive Yp
values of 0244300015 and 0245200015 respectively Alternatively
Peimbert et al 2000a b based on NGC 346 NGC 2363 and I Zw 18
derive Yp  0235100022 Most of the dierence is due to the TeHe ii
used by both groups while Izotov  Thuan and Izotov et al assume
that TeHe ii equals TeO iii Peimbert et al nd that TeHe ii is
about 9 smaller than TeO iii
Under the framework of standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis compu-
tations it is possible to compare the Yp Dp and Lip values through the
predicted b values
The high Yp determination of 02452  000151 combined with
standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis computations Thomas et al 1994
Fiorentini et al 1998 implies that at the 1 condence level bh2 is
in the 00139 to 00190 range For h  065 the Yp value corresponds to
0033  b  0045 a value in very good agreement with that derived
from the primordial deuterium abundance Dp determined by Burles
 Tytler 1998 that amounts to 0041  b  00471 for h  065
The low Yp determination of 02351  000221 implies that at
the 1 condence level bh2 is in the 00060 to 00081 range For h 
065 the Yp value corresponds to 0014  b  0019 a value in good
agreement with that derived from the primordial lithium abundance
Lip determined by Suzuki et al 2000 that amounts to 0015  b 
00332 for h  065 in very good agreement with the low redshift
estimate of the global budget of baryons by Fukugita et al 1998
who nd 0015  b  00301 for h  065 and consistent with
their minimum to maximum range for redshift z  3 that amounts to
0012  b  0070 for h  065
The discrepancy between the low Yp value and the Dp value should
be studied further
