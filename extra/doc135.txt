ABSTRACT
We present photometric evolution models of galaxies in which in addition to the stel-
lar component the eects of an evolving dusty interstellar medium have been included
with particular care Starting from the work of Calura Pipino  Matteucci 2008
in which chemical evolution models have been used to study the evolution of both
the gas and dust components of the interstellar medium in the solar neighbourhood
elliptical and irregular galaxies it has been possible to combine these models with a
spectrophotometric stellar code that includes dust reprocessing GRASIL Silva et
al 1998 to analyse the evolution of the spectral energy distributions SED of these
galaxies We test our models against observed SEDs both in the local universe and
at high redshift and use them to predict how the percentage of reprocessed starlight
evolves for each type of galaxy The importance of following the dust evolution is inves-
tigated by comparing our results with those obtained by adopting simple assumptions
to treat this component
Key words dustextinction - ISM  abundances - galaxies  evolution - galaxies 
INTRODUCTION
Small solid grains of material present within the interstellar
medium ISM of galaxies often referred to as dust absorb
and scatter stellar radiation mainly in the UV and optical
re-emitting it in the IR This process has been receiving
increasing interest due to the development of sophisticated
satellites operating in the IR initially IRAS ISO and more
recently Spitzer  and large earth bound telescopes for ex-
ample SCUBA a detector on the James Clerk Maxwell Tele-
scope operating in the sub-mm which have indisputably
demonstrated the importance of these particles Indeed it
has been found that approximately 30 per cent of all light
radiated by stars in the local universe has been dust repro-
cessed Soifer  Neugebauer 1991 and measurements of the
FIRsub-mm background estimate a potentially larger per-
centage  50 per cent reprocessed over the entire history of
the universe see eg Hauser  Dwek 2001 for a review
Hence a proper treatment of the dust reprocessing in
galaxies is essential both to derive physical quantities such

as star-formation rates and star-formation histories from ob-
servations and also when testing theoretical galaxy forma-
tion models against observations To do this it is necessary
to model the eect that the ISM has on the propagation of
photons from the stellar sources to the edge of the galaxy
As a result a good knowledge of the properties of the dust
component and its distribution within a galaxy is required
Observations from our own galaxy have provided in-
sights into the composition of interstellar dust its mor-
phology size distribution and relative abundance of its var-
ious elemental constituents and many viable models have
been proposed to explain them The most commonly used
dust compositions include those of Mathis Rumple  Nord-
sieck 1977 Draine  Lee 1984 Draine  Li 2001 and
2007Weingartner  Draine 2001 Desert et al 1990
Zubko Dwek  Arendt 2004 Such compositions try to
recreate the amount of extinction observed to local stars
the emission from local dust clouds and the depletion of el-
ements
Several galactic dust models have been proposed to fol-
low the propagation of photons through the ISM see reviews
by Dopita 2005 for starbursts Popescu  Tus 2005 for nor-
APSchurer et al
mal galaxies and Madden 2005 for irregular galaxies Such
galactic dust models treat this component with diering ge-
ometries and with varying degrees of sophistication Some
which solely involve radiative transfer calculations have
been used to account for the optical appearance of galax-
ies Xilouris et al 199719981999 Bianchi 2007 some have
only used dust emission models to account for the FIRSub-
mm SEDs Dale et al 2001 Draine  Li 2007 and some
which combine radiative transfer with a dust model in order
to self-consistently model SEDs from the UV to the sub-mm
and radio Silva et al 1998 hereafter S98 Bianchi Davies 
Alton 2000 Efstathiou Rowan-Robinson  Siebenmorgen
2000 Efstathiou  Rowan-Robinson 2003 Tus et al 2004
Piovan et al 2006
Many of the proposed models are based on the dust
composition models calculated for the Milky Way and for
simplicity use this same dust composition for all morpho-
logical types of galaxies and for every stage of their evo-
lution However unsurprisingly observations indicate that
dust properties are likely to vary with age and morphologi-
cal type For example observations of very high redshift and
hence young galaxies Maiolino et al 2004 and dwarf ir-
regular galaxies eg Galliano et al 2005 have been used to
infer very dierent sizes and compositions of dust grains in
these galaxies than those observed in the Milky Way So it is
unlikely to be sucient to model the eects of dust at all red-
shifts and in galaxies with very dierent properties and star
formation histories using only one grain distribution model
It is also common to calculate a total mass of dust by assum-
ing a dust-to-gas mass ratio proportional to the metallicity
of the galaxy with the same constant of proportionality in
all environments eg Granato 2000 et al Baugh 2005 et
al An assumption which is far from certain for example it
has been found that in dwarf irregular galaxies a lower than
expected dust-to-gas has been observed Hunt Bianchi 
Maiolino 2005 Galliano et al 2003 2005 Hence it would
be benecial when modeling the eects of dust reprocess-
ing in a range of dierent environments to be able to relax
these assumption and select appropriate dust properties for
each galaxy individually Unfortunately observational evi-
dence regarding the exact dust composition outside our own
galaxy is very limited It is therefore necessary at the present
time in order to model SEDs of galaxies of dierent type and
at dierent stages in their evolution to rely on theoretical
models which follow the evolution of dust
The dust grains are believed to be formed in a wide
range of astrophysical processes particularly in the stellar
outow of giant and Wolf-Rayet stars Recent FIR to sub-
mm observations of quasars have revealed large masses of
dust at high redshift Bertoldi et al 2003 Robson et al
2004 Beelen et al 2006 The presence of such quantities of
dust when the universe was 6 1 Gyr old before signicant
dust production from giant stars was possible suggests an
important role should be played by the enrichment due to
supernovae SNe Morgan  Edmunds 2003 Maiolino et
al 2004 Dwek et al 2007 and the observation of dust in
the remnants of SNe Dunne et al 2003 2008 Morgan et
al 2003 but see also Krase et al 2004 Wilson  Batrla 2005
and Sugerman et al 2006 have provided further evidence
for the formation of dust in these objects However this pro-
cess is complicated by the destruction of SNe dust grains by
the reverse shock propagating through the SNe ejecta Once
injected into the ISM the grains are subjected to a variety of
interstellar processes including thermal sputtering in high
velocity shocks evaporation and shattering by grain-grain
collisions and accretion in dense molecular clouds MCs
The challenge facing a dust evolution model is therefore
to combine all of these processes in one model and use it to
recreate several observation particularly the dust depletion
levels observed in the local universe examples include Dwek

This work aims to combine the two dierent areas by
using two well tested models the chemical and dust evolu-
tion model of CPM08 to follow the chemical and dust grain
evolution of galaxies of dierent morphology and then use
the GRASIL code S98 to use the calculated stellar and
dust evolution in order to calculate the SED expected for
the galaxy The importance of following the dust evolution
is tested by comparing these ducial SEDs with SEDs gen-
erated adopting two common simplications That the dust
to gas mass ratio is proportional to the metallicity and that
the dust composition in all galaxies is equal to that derived
for the Milky Way The main goal of this paper will be a
quantitative comparison between the SEDs generated using
the ducial model and that adopting the simplications In
such a way it is possible to estimate what errors could the-
oretically be expected from adopting such assumptions
We test our models of the three morphologies spirals
irregulars and ellipticals against observed SEDs in the local
universe Dale et al 2007 and the model elliptical galax-
ies at early times against observations of their expected
high redshift counterparts SCUBA galaxies Clements et
al 2008 and massive post-starburst galaxies at high red-
shift Wiklind et al 2008 We also use the models to pre-
dict how the percentage of reprocessed starlight evolves for
each type of galaxy
In this work it was only possible to follow in detail the
evolution of the chemical composition of the dust and not
how the size distribution and chemical makeup of the indi-
vidual grains evolve a potentially large but for now unavoid-
able limitation To test this alternative size distributions for
the irregular galaxy and for the young starbursting elliptical
galaxy were proposed based on observed extinction curves
and the resultant SEDs are presented
The plan of our paper is as follows In section 2 the
chemical and dust evolution model is explained in section
3 the spectrophotometric dust model is introduced and the
choices of parameters discussed in section 4 the integration
of the two models is briey described in section 5 the calcu-
lated SEDs are presented and are compared to observations
in addition a quantitative comparison is made between them
and the SEDs generated using the simple dust assumptions
in section 6 the implications of our work is discussed Some
concluding remarks are given in section 7
2 CHEMICAL EVOLUTION MODELS
The chemical evolution models that this paper is based upon
are presented in the CPM08 paper These models follow the
chemical evolution of several dierent elements in both the
gas and the dust components of the ISM of spiral elliptical
and irregular galaxies More detailed descriptions of these
Modeling the eects of dust evolution on the SEDs of galaxies
models can be found in Matteucci  Tornambe 1987 Mat-
teucci 1994 and Pipino et al 2002 2005 for the elliptical
galaxies Chiappini et al 1997 2001 for the spirals and
Bradamante et al 1998 for irregular galaxies For conve-
nience the main details will be summarized here
21 Gas Evolution
All the models consider only one gas phase In all models
the instantaneous recycling approximation is relaxed and
the stellar lifetimes are taken into account The abundance
of several of the elements in the gaseous phase of the ISM
H He Li C N O -elements Fe Fe peak elements and S-
process elements are followed from the birth of the galaxy
The following processes are considered
 The subtraction of elements from the gaseous phase of
the ISM due to star formation
 The production in stellar winds in low and intermediate
mass non-binary stars with masses 08 - 8 M
 The production in type Ia SNe by binary stars in sys-
tems with combined masses 3-16 M
 The production in type II SNe of massive stars of masses
8 - 100 M
 The increase in primordial elements due to infalling gas
 The loss of elements from gas outows due to galactic
wind as the thermal energy of the gas exceeds its binding
energy only present in the irregular and elliptical models
Low and intermediate mass stars contribute to the ISM
metal enrichment through quiescent mass loss and a plan-
etary nebula phase by adopting prescriptions by van den
Hoek  Groenwegen 1997 For massive stars and type Ia
SNe the empirical yields suggested by Francois et al 2004
are adopted
The star-formation eciencies and the rate of infall in
addition to the Initial Mass Function IMF are selected
for each of the galaxy morphologies in order to reproduce
observed chemical abundances
211 Spirals
The galactic disc is approximated by several independent
rings 2 Kpc wide without interchange of matter between
them In this picture spiral galaxies are assumed to form
as a result of two main infall episodes During the rst the
halo and the thick disc are formed During the second a
slower infall of external gas forms the thin disc with the gas
accumulating faster in the inner than in the outer region
with timescales equal to about 1 Gyr and 8 Gyr respectively
inside-out scenario The star formation rate is given by the
expression
r t  cid20 r t
r tcid212k1cid20 r tGal
r t cid21k1
ISM r t
Where r t is the total mass gas  stars surface density
at a radius r and time t r t is the total mass surface
density in the solar region The starformation eciency 
is set to   1 Gyr1 and becomes zero when the surface
density drops below th  7 Mpc2 as suggested by Ken-
nicutt 1989 For the gas density exponent k a value of 15
Figure 1 Predicted SF history in a the solar neighborhood

has been assumed by Chiappini et al 1997 in order to en-
sure a good t to the observational constraints of a large
set of local spirals Kennicutt 1998 The resultant star for-
mation history is shown in gure 1a for a 2 Kpc wide ring
located 8 Kpc from the Galactic centre which represents
the solar neighborhood
The IMF adopted is a simplied two-slope approxima-
tion to the actual Scalo 1986 IMF which is expressed by
the formula

212 Ellipticals
There is a long lasting debate on the scenario for the forma-
tion of elliptical galaxies While it is clear that dark matter
structures build up in a hierarchical fashion from smaller to
bigger ones there are strong hints that the much more com-
plex physics of visible matter impossible to simulate from
rst principles reverses to some level this trend Indeed
recent observations made in the past few years Cowie et
al 1996 Guzman et al 1997 Brinchmann  Ellis 2000 Ko-
dama et al 2004 Juneau et al 2005 Bell et al 2005 Noeske
et al 2007 add further support to previous suggestions
coming mostly from detailed studies of chemo-photometric
properties eg Thomas et al 2005 and references therein
for so called cosmic downsizing that large elliptical galax-
ies formed their stars at high redshift in a huge burst of star
formation and after that evolved in a almost passive way
for a recent comprehensive review see Renzini 2006 In-
deed a few modern semi-analytic models eg Granato et
al 2004 Bower et al 2006 try to obtain within a com-
putation of hierarchical build-up of dark matter potential
wells a rapid and high redshift assembly of baryons in large
galaxies which are dominated by ellipticals in other words
breaking the hierarchy of galaxy formation and mimicking
to some extent the monolithic scenario Somerville 2005
A fundamental ingredient may be a proper treatment of
APSchurer et al
the AGN feedback neglected in all previous computations
Which could make passive these galactic system after an
early z  2 and short phase  1 Gyr of rapid mergers of
similar sub-units
A detailed modelling of the physical mechanisms re-
sponsible for the downsizing is clearly outside the scope
of the present paper Thus here we adopt and investigate
the simple monolithic model proposed in CPM08 which has
been carefully calibrated against the chemistry of ellipti-
cals deferring the investigation of alternative and more com-
plex possibilities to future work The elliptical galaxies in
CPM08 form as a result of a rapid collapse of a homoge-
neous sphere of primordial gas leading to a period of intense
star-formation This star-formation is assumed to halt as the
energy of the ISM heated by stellar winds and SNe explo-
sions exceeds the binding energy of the gas sweeping away
almost all of the residual gas At later times the galactic
wind is maintained by type Ia SNe provided that the ther-
mal energy exceeds that of the binding energy of the gas
The star-formation rate is a Schmidt law expressed as
  Gkt
Where G is the total gas mass with an exponent k  1
The star formation eciency  is assumed to increase with
mass as originally postulated in Matteucci 1994 in order
to reproduce the positive correlation of MgFe with mass
eg Thomas et al 2005 In this paper models of galaxies
of three dierent masses have been followed Galaxies with a
nal stellar mass of 1010M the low mass galaxy described
in CPM08 with a star-formation eciency   5 Gyr1
Galaxies with a nal stellar mass of 1011M model La1 as
described in CPM08 with a star-formation eciency   15
Gyr1 Galaxies with a nal stellar mass of 1012M model
Ha1 as described in CPM08 with a star-formation eciency
  25 Gyr1 The star-formation history is shown in g-
ure 1b
The IMF adopted here is a Salpeter IMF of form
Salpm  017  m135
The IMF in dierent galactic system is a topic hotly de-
bated in literature For instance Baugh et al 2005 showed
that the only way to reproduce the statistic of sub-mm
sources usually considered the precursor of local ellipticals
in the context of their standard semi-analytic model is to
adopt an extremely top-heavy IMF during mergers However
their model still shows discrepancies with observed trends of
Fe in local ellipticals Nagashima et al 2005 and predicts
masses of sub-mm sources too low by more than one order
of magnitude Swinbank et al 2008
213 Irregulars
Two separate formation scenarios for irregular galaxies were
proposed in CPM08 In this paper only the rst scenario
is followed in which the irregular galaxies are assumed to
assemble from the infall of protogalactic small clouds of pri-
mordial chemical composition and to produce stars at a
slower rate than spirals This formation scenario has been
proposed to model dwarf irregular galaxies of a magellanic
The star formation rate is a Schmidt law as shown in
equation 3 with k  1 and a low star-formation eciency
  005 Gyr1 The star-formation history is shown in
gure 1c The IMF adopted is Salpeter as given by equation
22 Dust Evolution
In addition to the gas phase the CPM08 model also follows
the evolution of several of the elements in the interstellar
dust The elements considered are C O Si Mg Fe S The
factors considered are similar to those aecting the evolution
of the ISM and are
 The subtraction of dust elements due to star formation
 The production in stellar winds in low and intermediate
mass non-binary stars with masses 08 - 8 M
 The production in type Ia SNe by binary stars in sys-
tems with combined masses 3-16 M
 The production in type II SNe of massive stars of masses
8 - 100 M
 The loss of dust in outows due to galactic wind
 The destruction of dust primarily from SNe shocks
 The accretion of dust in dense molecular clouds MCs
The dust condensation eciencies assumed in the stellar
winds and in SNe are those suggested by Dwek 1998
The destruction rates in SNe shocks and the accretion
rates in MCs follow suggestions by McKee 1989 and Dwek
1998
221 Spirals
In the paper of CPM08 only the dust properties of the solar
neighborhood are considered
The accretion rates are set to realistic values following
Dwek 1998 and the destruction rates are set separately
for each element and are related to their individual con-
densation temperatures so that depletion fractions of the
elements in the model can reproduce those observed in the
local warm medium The results are shown in gure 2 For
the purposes of this paper we are interested in following the
evolution of the mass of carbon dust particles and silicates
dust particles composed of O Mg Si S Ca Fe The evo-
lution of these particles are shown in gure 3a
The solar neighborhood is believed to be representative
of the Galaxy as a whole Hence for this paper the prop-
erties calculated for the solar neighborhood will be used as
global properties for the whole galaxy
222 Ellipticals
For the initial starburst phase the same eciencies for ac-
cretion and destruction as in the solar neighborhood are as-
sumed However after the onset of the galactic winds ellipti-
cal galaxies will be largely devoid of cold gas Therefore it is
assumed that no accretion can occur and a much lower value
for the destruction eciency is used as derived by McKee
1989 for a hot and rareed medium Also an additional
destruction term is included to treat the thermal sputtering
which is thought to be the dominant source of destruction
in hot plasmas Following Itoh 1989 we assume that in a
 1 keV plasma nearly 90 per cent of the dust grains will
evaporate by sputtering in destrsputi  105ne yrcm3
Modeling the eects of dust evolution on the SEDs of galaxies
Lisenfeld  Ferrara 1998 Clayton et al 1996 it is assumed
that no accretion can occur The resultant dust evolution is
shown in gure 3c 
3 THE STELLAR POPULATION AND DUST
The far-UV to radio SEDs of the models discussed in section
2 will be calculated using the GRASIL code which follows
the evolution of the stellar population constructing a SED
at any given time rst taking into account the extinction
and emission by dust All the details are given in S98 and
only a summary of the main features are presented here
Though during certain phases of galaxy evolution AGN
activity may substantially contribute in shaping the ob-
served SED of the galaxy both providing an additional
point-like source in the center of the galaxy and contribut-
ing to the heating of galactic dust in the present paper we
do not consider this complication which we postpone to fu-
ture investigation This is justied by the fact that QSO
lifetimes are commonly estimated to be less than 100 Myrs
eg McLure  Dunlop 2002 Marconi et al 2004 Shankar
et al 2005 Hopkins  Hernquist 2008 so that during the
majority of the life of a galaxy any eect will be negligible
31 Stellar Population Model
The single stellar populations included in GRASIL are based
on the Padova stellar models and cover a large range in
ages and metallicity The SSPs include asymptotic giant
branch AGB isochrones which incorporate a treatment
of the dusty envelope around these stars and have been cal-
ibrated on the most recent data for the V-K colours of the
large magellanic clouds star clusters see Marigo et al 2008
Bressan et al 1998 The spectral synthesis technique con-
sists in summing up the spectra of each stellar population
provided by a simple stellar population SSP of appropri-
ate age and metallicity Z weighted by the star-formation
rate SFR  at the time of the stars birth Bressan et al
FtG 
SSPtG  t Zt  tdt
Where tG is the age of the galaxy and t is the birth age
of an individual SSP see also below the treatment of age
dependent attenuation The SFR and the metallicity values
are those calculated by the chemical evolution model see
section 21
32 Dust Model
GRASIL then calculates the radiative transfer of the
starlight the heating of the dust grains and the emission
from these grains with a self-consistent calculation of grain
temperatures for an assumed geometrical distribution of the
stars and dust and a specic grain model
The stars can be modeled in two main components
the bulge and the disc the latter not being present when
modeling elliptical galaxies The geometry is shown in g-
ure 4 The spherical bulge has an analytic King prole

223 Irregulars
For irregular galaxies the destruction value for the solar
neighborhood is used However since the observed molecu-
lar H content in dwarf irregular galaxies is very small with
molecular-to-atomic gas fractions of  10 per cent or lower

where the scalelength rc is a free parameter The disc is
described by a radially and vertically exponential prole
  expRRdexpzzd truncated at rt  6Rd where
the radial scalelength Rd and vertical scalelength zd are free
parameters
The dust component has the same disc and bulge pro-
les as the stellar component but can have scalelengths in-
dependent of the stellar component Within these proles
the gas and dust is further split into two main components
dense MCs and diuse cirrus The ratio of the total mass in
dust and gas located in the MCs to the total gas mass is a
free parameter fmc When a galaxy is composed of only a
bulge or a disc the MCs are dispersed evenly throughout the
galaxy however when a galaxy is modeled with both a disc
and a bulge as shown in gure 4 the MCs are located solely
in the disc Stars are assumed to form inside the MCs and
progressively escape them on a timescale tesc Specically
the fraction of stars inside clouds at time t after they formed
is assumed to be

Where tesc is a free parameter of the model The radii
and mass of the MCs are also free parameters of GRASIL
though the results actually depend only on the combination
mc which determines together with the dust-to-gas
ratio the optical depth of the clouds see S98 where Mmc
is the mass of a MC and Rmc is the radius of a MC
The dust is assumed to consist of a mixture of car-
bonaceous and silicate grains and polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons PAH The carbonaceous particles are assumed to
have the optical properties of randomly-orientated graphite
spheres The silicate grains are assumed to be amorphous sil-
icates The optical properties of silicate and graphite grains
are taken from Laor  Draine 1993 the optical proper-
ties of PAH molecules from Draine  Li 2007 The size
distribution used in this paper for our ducial models are
those chosen by S98 to match the extinction and emissivity
curves of the local ISM The size distribution for both the
carbon and silicate components are described by a double

bution is that derived by S98 to match observations from the

evolution model
The luminosities of the dierent stellar components
the stars in the bulge in the disc and young stars still in
clouds are calculated using the population synthesis model
described The GRASIL code then calculates the radiative
transfer of the starlight through the specied dust distri-
bution For the MCs a full radiative transfer calculation is
performed however for the diuse dust the eects of scatter-
ing are only approximated by assuming an eective optical
depth related to the true absorption and scattering opti-
cal depths by ef f  abs abs  sca12 Thus GRASIL
calculates for each point inside and outside the galaxy the
dust attenuated stellar radiation eld Using these values it
is then possible to calculate for each point inside the galaxy
the absorption of radiation thermal balance if in thermal
equilibrium or thermal uctuations if not and hence re-
emission for each grain composition and size Combining
the contributions from the attenuated starlight and from the
dust re-emission a SED for the galaxy is calculated which
depends on the angle the galaxy is viewed from

33 Choice of parameters
The value of the GRASIL parameters chosen for the dierent
galaxies are listed in table 2 The reasons for the choices
made are given below
331 Escape timescale tesc
This is a very important parameter controlling how long the
young stars remain in their birth clouds A value of 2 Myrs
for spiral and irregular galaxies is chosen following Granato
et al 2000 S98 found that larger values were needed to
t local starbursts tesc  20  60 Myrs to reect the dense
dusty environments found In a similar way one would ex-
pect much higher escape timescales for the early starburst-
ing phase of elliptical galaxies The rates of star-formation
however predicted by the CPM08 model far exceed those
observed in local starbursting galaxies and as a result the
escape timescale could reasonably be expected to be longer
still This value remains a free parameter of the model since
the precise dust condition present in SCUBA galaxies are
unknown In this work it has been set to 250 Myrs a value
found to provide good t to SCUBA galaxies at high red-
shift see section 531 After the onset of the galactic winds
in the elliptical galaxy all of the cold gas is blown out of the
galaxy and MCs cannot form as a result star formation is
stopped and consequently tesc  0
332 Optical depth of MCs Mmc Rmc
Combined these two parameters control the optical depth
of the MCs according to the ratio MmcR2
mc where Mmc
is the mass of a MC and Rmc is the radius of a MC Fol-
lowing Granato et al 2000 values of Mmc  106M and
Rmc16 pc are chosen for the spiral and elliptical galaxies
values which have been found to give good SED ts and are
consistent with observations
GRASIL has not been previously used to model irreg-
ular galaxies In order to t the SED in the MIR MCs with
a lower optical depth had to used in this work see section
333 Ratio of gas mass in MCs to total gas mass fmc
For spiral galaxies we choose a value of fmc  05 for this
parameter which agrees well with the values used to t local
spirals in S98
The passively evolving late phase in elliptical galaxies
will have no MCs so fmc  0 A value of 05 is adopted for
the starbursting stage
Lower value for the molecular-to-atomic gas fraction are
observed in irregular galaxies than in spiral galaxies see
section 223 and since most of the hydrogen in MCs is in
H2 while most of the diuse cirrus gas will be atomic H1
this lower value suggests a lower value of fmc Consequently
a value of fmc  01 has been chosen

t to a template constructed from local elliptical galaxies
a dust scalelength rd

length was required This conclusion was also reached by
Panuzzo et al 2007 who found it necessary to have dust
scalengths almost double the stellar ones in order to t a late
type galaxy of the Virgo cluster Spatially extended dust
has also been observationally detected by Temi Brighenti
 Mathews 2007 who have detected spatially extended
dust in two optically normal galaxies NGC 5044 and NGC
4636 Although it should be noted that Temi et al 2007
concluded that due to the short sputtering lifetime for ex-
tended dust  7 Gyrs and no evidence for a recent merger
that the most likely source of this dust was due to galactic
winds powered by a central AGN whereas in the CPM08
model the proposed mechanism for the galactic wind is dif-
ferent with SN1a and stars alone able to power the wind
for several Gyrs see Pipino et al 2005 Therefore due to
observational evidence and also typical values used in previ-
ous studies in the passively evolving phase we have set the
dust scale-length to be twice the stellar scale-length For the
APSchurer et al
early star-bursting phase the dust is likely to be more con-
centrated so the dust scale-length is set equal to the stellar
The irregular galaxy is modeled as a pure disc for both
the stellar and the dust components Observations for the
dust distribution in irregular galaxies are still largely incon-
clusive so we have set the dust scale-length equal to the
stellar one
34 Generating SEDs
In order for GRASIL to be able to calculate the intrinsic
stellar SED of a galaxy the stellar population code requires
a star formation history and a metallicity evolution which
are generated by the chemical evolution code and an IMF
which is set to that used in the chemical evolution code
To calculate the dust eected SED GRASIL requires a total
mass in dust in this work the dust-to-gas ratio will be the
quantity discussed and chemical composition of dust the
carbon over silicate ratio which are set by the dust evolution
model the other geometrical parameters are then set to the
values described in section 33 and the grain size distribution
to that derived in S98
For comparison SEDs are also calculated for galaxies
with the chemical evolution described by the CPM08 model
but without the detailed dust evolution properties Instead
two common assumptions will be adopted
 That the ratio of the dust mass to gas mass is propor-
tional to the metallicity through a constant normalised to
the Milky Way using the value 0008 calculated from obser-
vations for the dust to gas mass ratio as discussed in CPM08
So dust mass  metallicity gas mass
 That the chemical composition does not evolve So that
the fraction of carbon to silicate will be set to the value 019
for all times and morphologies a theoretical value found by
CPM08 for the ratio of CSi at 13 Gyr in the solar neigh-
borhood model
In addition for the irregular galaxy and for the starbursting
phase in elliptical galaxies the eect on the SED of releas-
ing a third assumption made routinely in other works as
well as for the ducial models in this paper namely that
the dust size grain distribution does not evolve and remains
constantly identical to that of the Milky Way is investigated
For clarity when the full dust treatment is used as de-
scribed in the CPM08 paper it will be referred to as the full
CPM08 model When the two assumptions outlined above
are adopted it will be referred to as the simple dust model
The dierence between the two models will be referred to
as the disparity This would be the error introduced by the
adoption of the simplications if one assumes that the du-
cial model is correct It is only a theoretical error
35 Treatment of PAH molecules
The abundance of PAHs is calculated from the chemical
composition of the dust predicted by the CPM08 model
specically their abundance is proportional to the total
abundance of carbon molecules in the dusty component of
the ISM The exact treatment of the absorption and emis-
sion processes for the PAH bands are then calculated follow-
ing the same procedure described in Silva et al 1998 and
Vega et al 2005 but updated with the most up-to-date
cross-sections outlined in Draine  Li 2007 calculated us-
ing new laboratory data and spectroscopic data observed by
the spitzer space telescope
Although PAH emissions have been found to be a ubiq-
uitous feature of both the Milky Way and external galax-
ies it is worth noting that the strengths of the PAH bands
have been found to vary between galaxies with low metal-
licity galaxies and galaxies hosting AGNs in particular being
found to be decient in PAH emission This has led several
authors to speculate that the abundances of PAHs could
be linked to the particular environmental conditions present
in their host galaxy For example it it thought that they
could be preferentially destroyed by strong UV radiation
eg Madden et al 2006 and could be more susceptible
to SNe shocks eg OHalloran et al 2006 This suggests
that the evolution of PAHs may not necessarily be identi-
cal to that of the larger carbon grains This eect has been
partly accounted for by following the treatment of PAHs
outlined in Vega et al 2005 Where in order to agree with
observations from around hot stars and HII regions from
within our galaxy the abundance of PAHs in the MCs within
GRASIL where the UV radiation will be strongest had to
be suppressed by a large factor  1000 with respect to the
cirrus component Using such a prescription it was shown
that GRASIL could reproduce the MIR spectrum of local
star-forming galaxies
Since in this work the evolution of the PAH dust popu-
lation has not been specically followed a detailed analysis
of the spectrum in the MIR will not be possible However
linking the abundance of the PAHs to both the environ-
ment by suppressing the PAH abundance in MCs and to
the chemical composition of the dust should be a reasonable
approximation and should be sucient to highlight broad
trends in the emission from this region
36 Comparison to Observations
361 Low Redshift
The theoretical SEDs are compared to observed nearby
galaxies of similar morphological type The data sample used
is that described in Dale et al 2007 which presents SEDs
for the 75 galaxies of the SINGS sample selected to span a
wide range of morphologies luminosities and IR to optical
ratios The data set comprises of galaxies at an average dis-
tance of  10 Mpcs and contains SEDs from UV to radio
wavelengths and includes 
 UV data from GALEX
 optical uxes from the RC3 catalogue de Vaucouleurs
 IR data from 2MASS ISO IRAS SPITZER
 Sub-mm data from SCUBA
 Radio data - from literature including the New VLA
Sky survey
All the galaxies of a particular morphological type are nor-
malised to a common value in the K -band
Our spiral model is designed to reproduce observations
of the Milky Way hence to represent this morphological
type all spirals of type SBb to SBc and SAb to SAc in the
SINGs data set were chosen numbering twenty four Our ir-
Modeling the eects of dust evolution on the SEDs of galaxies
regular galaxy is designed to reproduce observables of mag-
ellanic type irregular galaxies therefore the ten galaxies of
type Im will be used Our elliptical galaxy model is designed
to reproduce the observables of passively evolving elliptical
galaxies Of the six elliptical galaxies in the SINGS sample
two NGC 855 and NGC 3265 show very bright UV colours in
addition to srtong IR emission probably indicating ongoing
moderate starformation These two galaxies were identied
as starforming galaxies by Dale et al 2007 and were there-
fore not used in this work
362 High Redshift
In order for the elliptical galaxy formation scenario pre-
sented in this work to be correct one would expect to nd
observed galaxies at high redshift with SEDs similar to those
presented in this work It is therefore essential to check that
our young elliptical models are representative of the birth of
typical elliptical galaxies at high redshift by comparing the
theoretical models to observations However for each of the
masses of galaxy only one star formation history has been
followed with a xed set of values for all of the parameters
so the models could not be expected to account for all high
redshift objects Also due to the sheer variability of high
redshift galaxies the construction of an average high red-
shift SED is not possible Consequentially we compare our
models to two dierent high redshift data sets details of
which can be found in the relevant sections each thought
to be representative of a dierent stage of the young galax-
ies evolution to check that a reasonable proportion of the
observed galaxies have SEDs similar to that predicted by
our models
A chi-squared tting technique was employed to calcu-
late the age and redshift of the model which gives the best
t to the observed points Theoretical SEDs for the elliptical
galaxy in its starbursting and post-starbursting phases were
generated at several time steps from 005 Gyrs to 2 Gyrs
Each of these SEDs is then normalised and compared to the
observed spectra of the galaxy Since neither of the data sets
have spectroscopic redshifts the theoretical SEDs at all the
time steps are compared to the observed SED for a range
of redshift values and then the age and redshift which cor-
responds to the best t is selected using a chi-squared min-
imisation technique Due to the inherent uncertainty from
using such a limited template set in order to avoid spu-
rious results the possible redshift range will be limited to
within 30 per cent of the photometric redshift values calcu-
lated previously by other authors using more sophisticated
tting procedures

Figure 5 shows the results for the theoretical SEDs gener-
ated at 12 Gyrs compared to the mean SED of spiral galaxies
of types SBb to SBc and SAb to SAc from the SINGS sam-
ple The theoretical model shows a good correlation with the
observed spiral galaxies This suggests that the assumption
that the global properties of the galaxy can be represented

which it is undergoing a period of extreme starformation
by the chemical and dust evolution model of the solar neigh-
bourhood at late times is a good one
The evolution of the SED of spiral galaxies is shown in
gure 7 Due to the mainly quiescent slow evolution of the
spiral galaxies the SEDs do not show large changes through-
out their lifetime and there is little variation in the percent-
age of starlight reprocessed by the galaxy which for ages
greater than 1 Gyr remains fairly constant at a value of 30
per cent see gure 6
Also included in gure 7 are the SEDs generated for
the same chemical evolution model but adopting the two
dust assumptions Since the simple dust assumptions are
normalised to the full CPM08 model for the solar neighbour-
hood at 13 Gyrs the SEDs at 12 Gyrs are still in very close
APSchurer et al

galaxy with units erg s11030 The solid line shows the SEDs generated using the full CPM08 model the dashed line the evolution
adopting the simple dust model The lower panels displays the log residual between the two models
agreement As the age of the galaxy decreases the residuals
increase gure 9 as the assumptions made for the dust-
to-gas ratio and carbon over silicate ratios diverge from our
theoretically calculated values
Of the two simplications the disparity introduced by
assuming a dust-to-gas ratio dominate the residuals Assum-
ing a constant Milky Way chemical composition of the dust
has little eect on the SED because after initial uctuations
during the rst 2 Gyrs this ratio remains fairly constant
throughout the rest of its lifetime gure 8a Hence making
the simplication that the chemical composition does not
evolve with time will only lead to small dierences in the
SED gure 9a for the majority of the spiral galaxies life
At early times the dierent chemical composition calculated
mainly eects the MIR part of the SED due to the resulting
dierences in the abundance of PAHs
The assumed dust-to-gas ratio however leads to a more
signicant disparity particularly when the galaxy is younger
gure 9b since our model predicts a relationship between
the dust-to-gas ratio and the metallicity which is not en-
tirely linear gure 8b Therefore adopting this assumption
will introduce disparities which largely increase as the age
of the galaxy decreases This assumption will result in too
much dust in the galaxy and this will lead to an excess of
reprocessing The disparity will be most signicant in the
FIR part of the spectrum gure 9b
In this paper only the chemical evolution in the solar
neighbourhood has been followed and the SED of the whole
galaxy has been constructed by globalising the results Al-
though this has been shown to be a reasonable assumption
for old spiral galaxies in the local universe since the SEDs
generated are representative of observations it is unlikely
to be valid at higher redshifts The chemical evolution has
two infall episodes rst the halo and the thick disc forms fol-
lowed by the second phase in which the thin disc forms So at
early times the halo and thick disc will dominate the galax-
ies properties and the global properties could dier greatly
from that of the solar neighborhood The results for spiral
for very young galaxies ages 6 1 Gyr should therefore be
taken with caution
The CPM08 model and indeed all complete dust evolu-
tion models currently written only deal with the total mass
of dierent elements contained in grains As a result no infor-
mation is contained regarding how these elements are com-
bined to form grains and what size distribution these grains
should have Instead a composition and size distribution for
Modeling the eects of dust evolution on the SEDs of galaxies
however predicts a slightly dierent ratio for the dust-to-gas
ratio as well as a dierent graphite to silicate ratio than that
used in S98 Therefore if we use the S98 size distribution in
combination with the theoretical quantities of dust we have
calculated the resultant extinction and emission properties
will dier slightly from those observed
No adequate dust model was found in the literature
which could satisfactorily reproduce the observed extinction
curves with the low value of 019 for the ratio of carbon to
Silicon predicted by our model for example see Zubko et
al 2004 Hence for simplicity the S98 dust composition al-
ready included within the GRASIL model was used A likely
possibility is that existing dust models are tuned on low den-
sity environments cirrus while our CSi value should refer
to a galactic average
42 Properties of Irregular Galaxies
Figure 11 shows the results for the theoretical SEDs gener-
ated at 12 Gyrs compared to the SEDs for all the magellanic
type irregular galaxies of the SINGS sample Although the
irregular galaxies show some scatter in their SEDs the theo-
retical model manages to t the average properties remark-
ably well Also shown in the gure is the SED generated if
the two dust simplications are used By using these sim-
plications quite a clear discrepancy between the two SEDs
is introduced particularly in the IR and UV Although still
largely consistent with the observed SEDs there is a strong
hint that the simplied dust treatment is leading to more
dust reprocessing than that observed in the average galaxy
in the sample A common measure of the quantity of dust
reprocessing in a galaxy is the observed IRUV ratio eg
Dale 2007 Using the same formalism as Dale et al 2007
and equation 4 from Dale  Helou 2002 the median Total
IR to UV ratio was calculated for the irregular magellanic
galaxies in the sample to be 022 This agrees well with the
value of 021 calculated from the results of the full CPM08
model For the simple dust model however a value of 067
was calculated implying that to much energy has been ab-
sorbed in the UV and emitted in the IR
For the most part the disparity between the SED gener-
ated using the full dust treatment and that generated using
the simplications can be attributed to the assumption that
the dust-to-gas ratio scales with metallicity gure 12b As
gure 13b shows the theoretical values calculated by our
model are much lower than those calculated from the Milky
Way scaling relation by approximately a factor of 6 This
much lower dust to gas ratio can be mainly attributed to the
absence of accretion in our irregular galaxy model which will
results in smaller quantities of dust forming than would be
expected following the common Milky Way metallicity scal-
ing relation where dust accretion is prevalent Such a nding
is consistent with the work of Galliano et al 2003  2005
where dust masses were estimated for 4 local dwarf galaxies
and for two NGC 1569 and He 2-10 values for the dust-
to-gas ratio lower by a factors 4-7 and 2-10 than expected
were found and Hunt et al 2005 and Walter et al 2007
who estimated the dust masses in local dwarf galaxies and
found values consistently smaller than expected
Figure 13a shows that at ages greater than about 2
Gyrs the chemical composition calculated by the CPM08
model is signicantly dierent from that calculated for the

the dust grains must be assumed In previous works using
GRASIL it has been usual to use the grain distribution pop-
ulation suggested in S98 In that paper both the observed
extinction curves from the diuse medium within the Milky
Way and the observed galactic emission from dust was re-
produced using a combination of graphite and silicate grains
and PAH molecules
Our spiral chemical and dust evolution model is de-
signed to match observed properties of the solar neighbour-
hood and as a result it should also be capable of reproduc-
ing the observed galactic extinction and emission Our model
APSchurer et al
Figure 10 The evolution of the SED of the irregular galaxy panels the same as for gure 7
solar neighbourhood resulting in a much lower CSi ratio
Figure 12b shows that the main eect on the SED of the
galaxy of this lower CSi ratio will be in the MIR part of the
spectra with only a small eect at other wavelengths The
eect on the MIR of a change in the chemical composition
needs to be treated with caution since a major contributor
to this part of the spectra are PAHs whose evolution is not
specically followed by the CPM08 models see section 42 
The eect of the lower CSi value predicted by CPM08 on
the SED will largely be due to a reduction in the number of
PAH molecules and therefore in the luminosity radiated in
the PAH bands
Although the treatment of the PAHs in this work is in-
sucient to put any strong constraint on the nature of the
PAHs in the galaxies modeled it is worth noting the rel-
atively low abundance of CSi predicted for the irregular
galaxy compared to that of the solar neighbourhood This
is interesting since it is in agreement with the striking ob-
served correlation between the strength of PAH features and
the metallicity of the galaxy see eg Engelbracht et al 2005
Madden et al 2006 Wu et al 2006 OHalloran et al 2006
with low metallicity galaxies such as our theoretically mod-
eled irregular galaxy exhibiting very weak or no features
Several dierent explanations have been proposed for this
correlation These include the suggestion of more ecient
PAH destructive mechanisms in lower metallicity galaxies
eg Galliano 2005 Madden et al 2006 due to harder radi-
ation and the paucity of dust Alternatively OHalloran et
al 2006 proposed that the PAHs could be destroyed by nu-
merous shocks observed in low metallicity systems While it
has also been shown by Galliano et al 2008 that it is possi-
ble to explain the trend of PAH abundance with metallicity
using chemical evolution models Starting from the summa-
tions that lower metallicity galaxies are on average younger
than higher metallicity galaxies and that carbon dust and
PAHs are predominantly produced in AGB stars which recy-
cle their ejecta into the ISM after a relatively long period of
time It follows that the trend can be seen as a reection of
this delayed injection of carbon dust into the ISM by AGB
stars since younger systems will have had insucient time
to become enriched with PAHs The CPM08 chemical evolu-
tion models used in this work puts forward a new suggestion
since they show that even in older low metallicity systems
there is likely to be a lower abundance of carbon and there-
fore PAH molecules a possibility which could explain or at
least contribute to the observed trend
The relatively lower value of CSi predicted by the
CPM08 model with respect to that predicted for the solar

neighbourhood can be explained by examining the dierent
production and destruction rates used in the two dierent
environments In the solar neighbourhood model carbon is
assumed to be destroyed with a higher eciency than the
silicates This was chosen in order to explain the local dust
abundance pattern see CPM08 and is consistent with the
fact that carbon has a condensation temperature lower than
many silicates However the solar neighbourhood model also
includes dust accretion whose rate is assumed to be in-
dependent of the particular element For this reason the
abundance pattern produced by the preferential destruc-
tion of certain elements is partially smoothed out by the
non-dierential accretion In the irregular model however
where dust accretion is absent the higher destruction rate
attributed to the carbon is not compensated in the same
way giving rise to the lower CSi value
A possible source of error in this work is the absence
of an additional very cold grain VCG component as pro-
posed by Galliano et al 2003 and 2004 In these papers
a population of grains at very low temperatures were in-
troduced in order to explain an excess in the emission in
the sub-mm in the low metallicity galaxies observed Such
a component could be located at the center of dense clouds
see eg Galliano et al 2003 or in the galaxies outskirts
where the radiation eld is weak see eg Draine et al 2007
Galliano et al 2003 and 2005 estimated that for four low
metallicity irregular galaxies between 40 and 80 per cent of
the total dust mass is in the form of VCGs Such a dust
component is not currently included in our models and if
conrmed by additional sub-mm observations the inclusion
of such a large cold dust grain population should be inves-
tigated However any eect is likely to be slight For the
irregular galaxies over 80 per cent of the reprocessing is tak-
ing place within the MCs heated by the young stars As op-
posed to about 25 per cent in the spiral model The emission
of which is characterised only by the geometry and dust-to-
gas ratio of the MCs and would therefore be unaected by a
population of VSGs If a substantial proportion of the rest
of the dust takes the form of VCGs the result would be a
reduction in the amount of other larger sizes of dust grain
in the cirrus In our irregular model the cirrus component
only has a small observed eect on the SED at wavelengths
longer than the peak IR wavelength Therefore any eect
will be slight and will probably result in a slight decrease
in emission in the very FIR and an increase in the sub-mm
where the VSGs will emit
The evolution of the SED of irregular galaxies is shown
in gure 10 The quiescent low star formation rate leads to
SEDs which only slightly evolve with time The mass of dust
present in the galaxy initially increases rapidly until a time
 1 Gyrs is reached at which point it begins to plateau see
gure 3c The fraction of reprocessed light in the galaxy
follows suit rising rapidly to a value of  15 per cent and
then remains fairly constant throughout its lifetime A value
which is one half of the predicted light reprocessed in spiral
galaxies
As gure 12 shows the disparity between the SEDs gen-
erated using the simplications and the full dust treatment
actually decrease gradually as the galaxy gets younger with
the dierence from introducing the dust-to-gas scaling re-
lation always dominating that from assuming a constant
chemical composition With the largest eect always in the
IR with a very small eect in the optical and NIR part of
the spectrum
The dust size distribution in irregular galaxies is likely
to dier from that of the Milky Way eg Galliano et al
2005 This is highlighted by the fact that extinction curves
have been observed in both the small magellanic cloud
SMC and large magellanic cloud and have been found to
dier from that of the Milky Way The SMC extinction curve
is of particular interest since it is an irregular dwarf galaxy
with a substantially lower metallicity than the Milky Way
and should represent a dust environment similar to our the-
oretical irregular model The predicted extinction curve for
the mass and composition of dust predicted by our irregular
model has been compared to the observed SMC curve in or-
der to constrain a dust grain size distribution As gure 14

shows just by adopting the chemical composition predicted

ready calculated to match the properties of the Milky Way
a reasonable t is obtained to the extinction curve so the
dierent chemical composition alone can go some way to ex-
plaining the observed extinction curve By ne tuning the
parameters governing the size distribution in equation 7 an
improved t can be obtained as shown in the gure The
values of the best t parameters are shown in table 1
Figure 15 displays a comparison of the SEDs for the full
model adopting the size distribution constrained using the
SMC extinction curve to the SEDs for the full model using
the standard Milky Way derived size distribution It shows
that the dierence is small at all times largely because the
dierence in the two size distributions is small
43 Properties of Elliptical Galaxies
In our elliptical galaxy formation scenario there are two dis-
tinct stages An initial rapid collapse of a sphere of primor-
dial gas leading to intense star formation and a second qui-
escent stage where the star formation has stopped as almost
all of the gas is blown away by galactic winds These two
stages will be discussed separately Unless stated all results
shown are for the elliptical model with a nal stellar mass
of 1011M
431 Starbursting phase - High redshift
The evolution of the SED of our elliptical model during the
starbursting phase is shown in gure 16 Initially all the
stars will be located within their birth clouds MCs how-
ever since the dust mass is initially negligible the SED at
these very early times will have the form of just the bare
stellar component The MCs will soon become rapidly en-
riched with dust due to dust production in type II SNe and
as a result the reprocessing will rise quickly almost to 100
per cent after 0005 Gyrs gure 6 As the age of the galaxies
increase more stars will have had time to escape from their
MCs and as a result will be radiating in the more diuse cir-
rus hence the gradual decrease in reprocessing as observed
in the gure The small amount of PAH emission seen in
the SEDs of gure 16 is as a result of the large proportion of
dust emission coming from the MCs Due to the suppression
of the abundance of PAHs in these environments they will
consequentially produce little PAH emission After the on-
set of the galactic winds at 07 Gyr the majority of the dust
is blown out of the galaxy so the amount of reprocessing
drops at same the time the star formation is stopped and
the galaxy enters the passively evolving stage
Figure 18 shows the eect that the two simplications
will have on the SEDs Of the two adopting the assumption
that the dust-to-gas ratio will scale with the metallicity will
have the biggest eect This is because as gure 22 shows
that although such a relationship does hold for these young
galaxies initially ages  03 Gyrs the dust-to-gas value
calculated by the model soon diverges from the expected
value based on the metallicity and as a result using this
simplications leads to large disparities in the SEDs
Assuming a milky way chemical composition for the
dust however has little eect on the SEDs at early times
This is because as gure 22 shows the chemical composition
at least initially is remarkably similar to the value of 019
calculated for the solar neighbourhood As the burst pro-
gresses the CSi begins to drop leading to small dierences
between the SEDs of the full CPM08 model and the simple
dust model see gure 18b
Although the model calculates that the chemical com-
position of the total dust component is likely to be quite sim-
ilar to that of the solar neighbourhood throughout the burst
it does not necessarily follow that the individual grains will
be of the same composition and have the same size distri-
butions as that observed locally In the local universe much
of the dust is thought to be produced in the stellar winds of

low and intermediate mass stars However in young galaxies
at high redshift with ages less than 1 Gyr such stars would
not have had sucient time to evolve to this stage instead
the dust will be predominantly produced in SNe for detailed
information of the relative production rates of the various
mechanisms see gures 2 and 6 in CPM08 Hence the dust
properties in these young galaxies is thought to be very dif-
ferent to that observed in the local universe in the Milky
Way and in the SMC
One possible tool for the study of dust in the high red-
shift universe is QSOs According to recent models of QSO-
galaxy co-evolution eg Granato et al 2004 and Di Matteo
et al 2005 during the early stages of galaxy and black hole
growth the AGN is embedded in gas and dust and is there-
fore dicult to identify as an QSO however after the onset
of galactic winds because large quantities of dust and gas
will be swept away the QSO can be observed The prop-
erties of observed QSOs should therefore be predicted by
our elliptical model at times shortly after the onset of the
galactic wind Maiolino et al 2006 showed that the chem-
ical abundances observed in QSOs best match the chemical
abundances calculated for our giant 1012M elliptical model
at times later than 05 Gyrs corresponding to the epoch just
after the onset of the galactic winds supporting this the-
ory By studying the SEDs of QSOs it has been possible
to infer extinction curves for these objects and by studying
these observed curves it should be possible to constrain a
size distribution for our young elliptical galaxies
Maiolino et al 2004 calculated an extinction curve
for a high redshift QSO SDSSJ104846 at a redshift of
z6193 and found that the extinction curve diers greatly
from the extinction curves observed at low redshift The ob-
served extinction curve has been compared to the extinction
curve predicted by several models which have been written
to predict the size distribution of dust from SNe including
Bianchi  Schneider 2007 and Nozawa et al 2007 These
size distributions have been found to be consistent with the
observered QSO extinction curve leading to the conclusion
that the dust observed in the extremely high redshift objects
could indeed be dominated by SNe dust The processes in-
volved in the formation of dust in SNe is complicated and is
far from being completely understood Indeed the size dis-
tributions predicted by Nozawa et al 2007 and Bianchi
 Schneider 2007 dier substantially from each other In
addition both papers only consider the production and de-
struction of dust in SNe neither follow the accretion and
destruction of the SNe remnants in the ISM as well as that
by the galactic winds

Figure 20 shows the eect that adopting this size
distribution will have on the SEDs of elliptical galaxies
during their starburst phase The SEDs generated vary
substantially from those generated using the Milky Way
size distribution particularly in the NIR and MIR
SCUBA galaxies
The theoretical SEDs for the 1011M young ellipti-
cal galaxies are compared to SCUBA galaxies at high red-
shifts These galaxies have been found to be dust enshrouded
sources with very high star formation rates It is believed
that these SCUBA galaxies could represent the birth of gi-
ant elliptical galaxies Lilly et al 1999 Eales et al 2000
and should therefore correspond to the starbursting phase
of our elliptical models The data used is from the SHADES
survey of the SXDF eld Clements et al 2008 This survey
is ideal for the purposes of this paper since it has a good pho-
tometric coverage with observations from the optical Suburu
 XMM-Newton eld Deep Field SXDF B V R i and
z  Spitzer IRAC 36 45 58 9 m and MIPs 24 70 and
160 m and SCUBA Only the galaxies with the highest
redshift from the sample were used namely galaxies which
were found by Clements et al 2008 to have a photometric
redshift greater than two In total these galaxies numbered
thirteen
Figure 22 shows that for four of the observed galaxies
in the SHADES dataset our model was able to match
the general shape of the SED and the observed amount
of reprocessing The average age of the best tting full
CPM08 models for the four galaxies shown is 055 Gyrs
At such an age the theoretical model will still have ongoing
star formation Because only one star formation history has
been followed and no parameters varied perfect matches
could not be expected to all observed galaxies However
as shown even with this one simple star formation history
the observed SEDs of four out of the thirteen galaxies
investigated in this work could be reasonably reproduced
This suggests that the rationale of treating these galaxies
as obscured starbursts with a dust mass calculated by the
CPM08 model
is consistent with the observations Also
shown in the gure are the spectra for the simple dust

that of the full CPM08 model signicantly the theoretical

Giant post-starbusrt galaxies at high redshift
The theoretical SEDs calculated for young elliptical
galaxies are compared to massive galaxies which have been
observed to be already highly evolved at high redshifts Wik-
lind et al 2008 Since these galaxies are likely to be massive
the giant 1012M elliptical galaxy will be used in the ts
The galaxies in the data set have been selected by Wiklind
et al 2008 so that they are dominated by a stellar pop-
ulation older than  100 Myr and situated at z  5 They
should therefore correspond to a later stage in the evolution
of our elliptical galaxy model the post starburst stage of
our giant elliptical model Data points are available in the
optical ACS - B V i z  NIR VLTISAAC - J H Ks -
MIR deep imaging with the Spitzer Space Telescope with
IRAC 36 45 57 and 80 m and MIPS 24 m For the
chi-squared tting the point at 24 m was not included since
emission in this region could be dominated by an AGN
Many of the observed galaxies could be well matched
by our theoretical model and gure 23a shows good ts
to four of the galaxies in the sample The ts for the full
CPM08 the simple dust model and the full dust model
with the dust composition calculated in order to t the QSO
SDSSJ104846 are all good The theoretical SEDs diverge
from each other mostly in the rest frame FIR and since no
observations exist for this part of the spectrum the dier-
ence in ts in the SEDs is slight The average age of the
best tting full CPM08 models for the four galaxies shown
is 061 Gyrs At such an age our giant elliptical model cor-
responds to a post starbursting system with no current star
formation It should be noted that because only one star-
formation history was followed in this work our calculated
value for the stellar ages of the galaxies should be taken as
an indication of one possible formation scenario not as an
actual value
For several of the galaxies in the sample intriguingly the

observed MIPS ux at 24m far exceeds the ux predicted
by our model for example BBG 3348 This galaxy has been
observed in the x-ray with a luminosity of 3  1043erg s1
and it is therefore plausible that the observed MIPS ux
could have a contribution from an obscured AGN Such a
source could explain the higher ux observed in this band
but would have a minimal impact on the part of the SED
covered by the ACSISAACIRAC bands see eg Mobasher
2005 and would therefore not eect the presented SED t
in this region
Figure 23 however shows an alternative formation sce-
nario for this galaxy in which the predicted SED of the
1011M model is normalised and compared to the observed
SED The best t model has been found to have a stellar age
of 06 Gyr the same age as that calculated for the 1012M
model As can be seen from the t the MIPS 24m ux
is predicted by the model without the need of an obscured
AGN In this 1011M model star formation is still ongoing
at such an age Due to the nature of the dust model used
this young star formation will be entirely obscured within
dense MCs so will only contribute to the ux in the rest
frame MIR and FIR The older stars that have been able
to escape the MCs however will be only slightly absorbed
due to the less dense cirrus producing a similar SED in the
optical and NIR as the 1012M model described above
Both scenarios described obscured starburst or a pas-
sive galaxy with an AGN are equally consistent with the
data Longer wavelength observations would be required to
discriminate between them

Figure 24 shows the result for the theoretical SED of the el-
liptical model generated at 12 Gyrs compared to the SEDs
of the four passive local elliptical galaxies from the SINGS
sample The SED generated by the model with the full dust
evolution matches the observations well Elliptical galaxies
display fairly homogeneous optical colours a trend reected
in the observed galaxies in gure 24 which have almost iden-
tical SEDs from the optical to the NIR The SED in this
region is reproduced well by our full theoretical model and
also the simple dust model The four galaxies though show
larger scatter in the FIR and in the UV
Although there is much scatter in the observed FIR
bump probably due to a diering dust content the full
CPM08 model predicts FIR emission which agrees well with
the average of the observed points It can therefore be

thought of as having a dust content consistent with this
sample However when the simple dust model using the two
simple dust assumptions is used SEDs are generated which
signicantly overestimate the amount of FIR observed Pre-
sumably because of the larger dust content present due to
the assumption that the dust-to-gas ratio scales with the
metallicity see gure 22b In this work the assumption has
been introduced that the dust component is more extended
than that of the stellar component with a scalelength twice
as large see section 334 To check the robustness of our
results on this assumption the SED of the elliptical model
at 12 Gyr with a scalelength of the dust equal to that of
the stellar component was calculated This is also shown in
gure 24 and it can be seen that although this assumption
does have a noticeable eect on the SED the t for the full
CPM08 model is still consistent with the observations while
the simple dust model stills over predicts the emission in the
Out of the four passive elliptical galaxies in the sample
all four have observations in the NUV and three have ob-
served points in the FUV Although the galaxies do show a
small amount of scatter in this region the theoretical model
is able to reproduce a UV-upturn which is consistent with
the average points The UV scatter too could be partially
explained by diering amounts of extinction due to dierent
dust contents Indeed the simple dust model seems to under-
predict the luminosity in the FUV presumably because of
the greater dust content present However it has also been
claimed by several authors eg Kaviraj et al 2007 that the
range of UV colours observed in dierent early type galax-
ies could be due to a small amount of recent star formation

beyond the scope of the present paper
The theoretical evolution of the SED of the elliptical
galaxy is shown in gure 25 Young stars are the main con-
tributors to the UV so since there is no star formation the
elliptical galaxies are weak in the UV The amount of repro-
cessing in the galaxy gure 6 is always small at all times
less than 5 and follows the mass of dust present in the

Figure 18 shows that of the two simplications the
largest eect on the SEDs comes from assuming the depen-
dence of the dust-to-gas ratio on the metallicity will lead to
large disparities in the SED This is because this assump-
tion leads to large dierences in the dust to gas ratio with
the results obtained from the full CPM08 model see g-
ure 22b As gure 18 shows these disparities will have the
largest impact in the FIR part of the spectrum
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WORK
In this work only one likely chemical and dust evolution
model with one star-formation history has been followed for
each morphological type of galaxy based on average proper-
ties of the galaxy type as a whole It is therefore not possible
to prove conclusively the accuracy of the models since it is
unlikely that they will match exactly the SED of any one
specic galaxy However since the chemical-evolution mod-
els are designed to match average properties the generated
SEDs would be expected to match the general appearance of
many galaxies of the specic type and this is indeed what has
been found In this paper plots have been presented which
show acceptable ts to local spirals irregulars and ellipticals
simultaneously in their starbursting post star-bursting and
passive phase It should also be noted that although both
models contain many parameters very little ne tuning has
been performed to t observations Instead the parameters
have been set either to physically reasonable values based on
observations or to values which when used previously have
been found to give good ts to observations As a result
the ts are remarkably good and although far from con-
clusive seem to validate both the chemical evolution model
used the CPM08 model and the stellar population model
adopted GRASIL Only two parameters were tuned in this
work to match the observations For the irregular galaxies

Modeling the eects of dust evolution on the SEDs of galaxies
In the CPM08 paper it was found that the dust de-
pletion pattern is determined by the balance between de-
struction and accretion and since neither process can be
constrained accurately from the solar neighborhood nothing
denite can be learned about the rate of either However in
both the elliptical and irregular galaxies the accretion rates
should be negligible hence by studying such environments
it should in theory be possible to derive constraints for the
destruction rates of the dierent elements The reasonable
ts to local galaxies support the values chosen
The use of theoretical template SEDs in comparisons
with photometry has proved to be a useful tool in order to
gain insights into high redshift galaxies in particular for de-
termining a photometric redshift eg Rowan-Robinson et
al 2008 Among the templates commonly used are those of
well studied starburst galaxies in the local universe such as
ARP 220 and M82 However there is evidence that starburst
galaxies at high redshift display dierent characteristics to
their low redshift counterparts For example showing higher
specic star formation rates star formation rate  stellar
mass Bauer et al 2005 and have higher dust obscuration
rates Hammer et al 2005 It is therefore important to de-
velop a set of multi wavelength templates specic to the type
of galaxy expected at high redshift particularly with the
approaching launch of the European Space Agencys ESA
Herschel Space Observatory Pilbratt 2005 which will in-
crease the wavelength coverage for these objects Our models
deal with both the chemical and dust evolution in these early
galaxies in a self consistent way and in this paper the SEDs
generated have been shown to match high redshift galaxies
simultaneously in both the starbursting and post starburst-
ing stage They should therefore provide ideal templates for
the analysis of these high redshift galaxies Further work will
be carried out to generate and test a range of high redshift
templates
Also investigated in this work are the potential errors
you could expect by introducing two common simplica-
tions into the modeling of galaxies that the dust-to-gas
mass ratio is proportional to the metallicity and that the
dust composition in all galaxies is equal to that derived for
the Milky Way These errors are given as the dierence be-
tween our ducial models with the detailed dust treatment
and the models using the two simplications They will only
be correct for the models presented here and not for any
real galaxy in particular However the chemical evolution
models have been thoroughly tested against observations in
previous works and in this paper the SEDs have been shown
to be broadly consistent with the SEDs of the morphologi-
cal type modeled Therefore the disparities presented in this
work can be viewed as an example of the magnitude of errors
that could be expected if the simplications are adopted in
spiral irregular and elliptical galaxies In particular it has
been shown that for spiral galaxies the errors that could be
expected are small and decrease with the age of the galaxy
this is unsurprising since these simplications have been de-
veloped based on the Milky Way in the case of the chemical
composition and observations on local starforming galaxies
in the case of the dust-to-gas ratio For irregular and el-
liptical galaxies however it has been shown that potentially
the disparities introduced by adopting the two simplica-
tions could be much larger Of the two simplications it has
been shown that in both galactic types that the simplica-

which the stars are born needed to be reduced to a lower op-

is dependent on both the mass and the radius and is given
by MmcR2

amount of reprocessing observed in the SEDs of the SCUBA

tion likely to lead to the largest disparities is assuming the
dependency on the metallicity of the dust-to-gas ratio and
that the largest disparities would be expected in the IR part
of the spectrum
The main limitation of this work is that only the total
mass in each of the main dust species is followed The model
does not calculate in what proportions they combine with
to make up dust grains and what the size distribution of
these dust species could be As a result a major assumption
had to be introduced for the composition of the dust grains
that the size distribution does not evolve and all times will
be identical to that calculated to match properties of the
Milky Way S98 size distribution This assumption was re-
laxed in irregular galaxies where a dust composition consis-
tent with the SMC extinction curve was calculated and in
young elliptical galaxies where a dust composition consis-
tent with the extinction curve of a high redshift QSO was
found It was shown that adopting the dust composition
based on the SMC had only a small eect on the SEDs The
eect of adopting the dust composition consistent with the
QSO in young elliptical galaxies had a large eect particu-
larly in the NIR and MIR With the current observational
data it was not possible to put strong constraints on which
size distribution is the more realistic but the huge dierence
in the SEDs generated using the two dierent distributions
highlights how important using the correct size distribution
could be and how it could have large consequences for sur-
veys or any observations taken shortward of the peak of
the dust emission Precisely the wavelength range which the
Herschel Space Observatory is set to operate in
6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Starting from the models proposed in the CPM08 paper
the chemical and dust evolution models have been combined
with the GRASIL spectrophotometric population synthesis
code in order to generate SEDs for the solar neighborhood
and irregular and elliptical galaxies from the birth of the
galaxy to an age of 13 Gyr
The SEDs have been compared where possible to ob-
served SEDs A good t has been obtained for the spiral
model when compared to local spiral galaxies the elliptical
model has simultaneously tted observations of high-redshift
starbursting SCUBA galaxies high-redshift post starburst
galaxies and local galaxies while the irregular galaxy model
has been shown to match adequately the SEDs of local irreg-
ular galaxies of magellanic type The results are particularly
remarkable since very few of the GRASIL parameters were
Modeling the eects of dust evolution on the SEDs of galaxies
ne tuned in order to obtain these results instead they were
merely set to a combination of observationally motivated
values or to values which have been found to give good ts
to observations in previous works The good ts give further
indications that the galaxy formation scenarios chosen for
each morphological type in order to t the chemical proper-
ties of these galaxies are indeed valid In addition the good
ts particularly to the local elliptical and irregular galax-
ies suggest that the dust treatment adopted in the CPM08
paper are reliable and in particular support the destruction
and accretion rates chosen From these ts to observations
it has been shown that the optical depth in MCs in irregular
galaxies is likely to be lower than that of normal starform-
ing galaxies It has also been found that in order to match
the observations of SCUBA galaxies the stars in the young
extreme starbursting galaxies initially spend a large period
of time in dense MCs before escaping
It has been shown that SEDs generated using either
the assumption that the dust grain distribution in all en-
vironments is equal to that of the Milky Way or the as-
sumption that the dust-to-gas mass ratio scales with the
metallicity dier from those calculated using a full dust evo-
lution model Of these assumptions it has been found that
assuming a dust-to-gas ratio will introduce the largest dis-
parities while the disparities introduced from an assumed
chemical composition are small only having a potentially
large eect in the MIR due to a change in the abundance of
PAH molecules For spiral galaxies the disparities incurred
by adopting the assumptions are small and will decrease
with age and therefore increase with redshift to a large part
due to the normalisation of the assumptions in this model to
the results calculated for the spiral galaxy at 13 Gyrs The
disparities introduced by adopting the assumptions are more
signicant in the galaxies of the two other morphologies at
all ages particularly in elliptical galaxies and therefore dust
assumptions tuned to match those of the Milky Way should
be used with caution in these galaxies
It has also been shown that while using a Milky Way
size distribution to model irregular galaxies should be a rea-
sonable simplication for elliptical galaxies at high redshift
such a simplication could potentially lead to large errors
The reasonable t of the young elliptical galaxy to
SCUBA galaxies at a redshift of  22 and to a massive
post starburst elliptical at a redshift of  5 suggests that
the starbursting scenario adopted in this work is a reason-
able one and that models generated by these models could
act as useful templates to t to high redshift galaxies
This study can be thought of as a rst step toward a
more careful comparison between galaxy formation scenar-
ios and observed data particularly in the spectral regions
aected by dust emission The robustness of such a compar-
ison has clearly been shown to be aected by a proper treat-
ment of dust evolution and reprocessing in a wavelength
dependent way A more rigorous dust treatment which can
be applied to galaxy formation models will be the subject
of future papers
