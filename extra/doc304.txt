ABSTRACT
We investigate the luminosity evolution of the host galaxies of radio-loud AGN
through Hubble Space Telescope imaging of 72 BL Lac objects including new
STIS imaging of nine z  06 BL Lacs With their intrinsically low accretion rates
and their strongly beamed jets BL Lacs provide a unique opportunity to probe
host galaxy evolution independent of the biases and ambiguities implicit in quasar
studies We nd that the host galaxies of BL Lacs evolve strongly consistent with
passive evolution from a period of active star formation in the range 05  z 
25 and inconsistent with either passive evolution from a high formation redshift
or a non-evolving population This evolution is broadly consistent with that
observed in the hosts of other radio-loud AGN and inconsistent with the atter
luminosity evolution of quiescent early types and radio-quiet hosts This indicates
that active star formation and hence galaxy interactions are associated with the
formation for radio-loud AGN and that these host galaxies preferentially accrete
less material after their formation epoch than galaxies without powerful radio
jets We discuss possible explanations for the link between merger history and
the incidence of a radio jet

Introduction
From Hubble Space Telescope HST studies of local galaxies it appears that nearly
all contain supermassive black holes SMBHs Joseph et al 2001 Bower et al 2001 Sarzi
 2 
et al 2001 Barth et al 2001 Gebhardt et al 2003 Combined with the predictions from
hierarchical galaxy formation this suggests that the formation and evolution of galaxies and
SMBHs might be closely linked Silk  Rees 1998 Haehnelt  Rees 1993 Kaumann 
Haehnelt 2000 Franceschini et al 1999 Merrield et al 2000 Wang Biermann  Wandel
2000 di Matteo et al 2003 Circumstantial evidence also points to a direct link between
the evolution of normal galaxies with the AGN phenomenon  the co-moving densities of
both rise rapidly from today back to redshift  2 Schmidt  Green 1983 Boyle Shanks
 Peterson 1988 Shaver et al 1996 Lilly et al 1995 Driver et al 1995 Cowie et al 1996
Madau et al 1996 Connolly et al 1997 Cowie et al 2003 Hasinger 2003 Certainly it is
plausible that AGN luminosity aects host galaxy properties particularly star formation
rates eg de Young 1989 Rees 1989 Whittle 1992 Gonzalez Delgado 1995 Barthel 2001
Zirm Dickinson  Dey 2003 and a number of studies have found a dependence of maximum
AGN power on host galaxy luminosity Smith et al 1986 Veron-Cetty  Woltjer 1990

It may be that most galaxies pass through one or more active phases at some point
If so then comparing the luminosity
in their development Cavaliere  Padovani 1989
evolution of AGN host galaxies to that of normal galaxies allows us to study the link between
AGN activity and galaxy evolution If galaxy interactions are an important trigger of AGN
activity eg Hutchings  Campbell 1983 Heckman et al 1984 Yee 1987 Heisler 1991
Hutchings  Ne 1992 Canalizo  Stockton 2001 then there is a link between AGN activity
and the assembly of elliptical galaxies which should be reected in the luminosity evolution
of AGN host galaxies Franceschini et al 1999
Work on host galaxy evolution to date has largely been restricted to high-power sources
due to the diculty in nding low-power AGN at suciently high redshift for the evolution
of galaxies to become signicant The host galaxies of powerful radio-loud AGN at high
redshift appear to be brighter than general radio-loud host galaxies observed at low redshift
consistent with passively evolving stellar populations Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 Lilly
 Longair 1982 Kukula et al 2001 McLure  Dunlop 2000 Lehnert et al 1999 The same
is not observed of brightest cluster galaxies BCGs which exhibit at luminosity evolution
over the redshift range 0 to 1 Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 and so are likely to be gaining
in luminous mass This is also tentatively the case for other early-type galaxies Stanford
et al 1998 Lilly et al 1995 Kaumann et al 1996 Bell et al 2004 The host galaxies of
radio-quiet AGN seem to exhibit similar at or negative luminosity evolution and appear
to be gaining mass between redshift z  2 and the present Kukula et al 2001 Rix et al
2001 Ridgway et al 2001

However various biases make it impossible to condently ascribe the observed evolution
to the host galaxies themselves First it appears that maximum AGN power increases with
host mass Smith et al 1986 Veron-Cetty  Woltjer 1990 Hutchings et al 1984 Hooper
Impey  Foltz 1997 Schade Boyle  Letawsky 2000 McLeod Rieke  Storrie-Lombardi
1999 Scarpa  Urry 2001 ODowd Urry  Scarpa 2002 Dunlop et al
2003 This
may induce apparent redshift evolution in ux-limited samples Second in powerful AGN
scattered light from the nucleus and extended ionized gas contaminates host galaxy light
In radio galaxies nuclear emission may be mistaken for host galaxy light Dunlop  Peacock
1993 This contamination increases with AGN power which may again produce a spurious
host luminosity-redshift trend
BL Lac objects are intrinsically low-power AGN with much lower accretion rates than
quasars ODowd Urry  Scarpa 2002 or powerful radio galaxies yet the relativistic beam-
ing of their jet emission means that they can be detected in signicant numbers to z  1 at
which point galaxy luminosity evolution becomes measurable Fortuitously BL Lac objects
overcome many of the potential biases outlined above
First the apparent luminosity of BL Lac objects is dominated by magnied emission
from their relativistically beamed aligned jets Urry  Padovani 1995 This magnication is
in turn dominated by the angle of the jet to the line of sight Variation in jet angle washes out
any trend between the power of the nucleus and the luminosity of the host galaxy supported
by absence of any correlation between host luminosity and beamed nuclear luminosity Urry
et al 2000 Second the host galaxies of BL Lac objects are less likely to suer from
contamination by scattered light from their low-power nuclei nor do they tend to exhibit
the luminous extended ionized gas observed in more powerful AGN
Due to the 1  z4 surface brightness dimming of the hosts compared to 1  z3
dimming of the nucleus the Hubble Space Telescope HST is needed to reliably determine
In this paper we present new HST 1
BL Lac host galaxy parameters beyond z  06
STIS images of high-redshift BL Lac objects Combined with earlier z  06 HST WFPC2
observations we measure the evolution of radio-loud AGN host galaxies free from many of
the biases implicit in previous studies The observations and data analysis are described

galaxy luminosity evolution are presented in 4 and the discussion of these results in 5

2 Observations and Data Analysis
21 The Sample
The new STIS observations are high-redshift BL Lac objects selected from the cycle 6
HST snapshot survey of Urry et al 2000 The original 132 proposed snapshot targets were
chosen from six ux-limited samples These were essentially all known BL Lac objects in
complete samples in 1995 The 110 BL Lacs nally imaged in the snapshot program were
chosen at random from the larger sample and are an unbiased subset The sample chosen
for STIS imaging comprised the 9 least optically luminous BL Lacs with z  06 spanning
a range at least to z  1 As observed nuclear brightness is dominated by variation in jet
angle this luminosity requirement does not introduce signicant bias but does dramatically
increase our chances of detecting the host galaxy Table 1 gives the nal target list and
exposure information with the magnitudes and host galaxy limits derived from the WFPC2
snapshot images
These targets were imaged with the STIS camera aboard HST using the F2850LP
longpass lter This conguration maximizes sensitivity to the host galaxy sampling from
5500A to 10000A The absence in BL Lac objects of a big blue bump or extended line
emission as seen in quasars makes it possible to use such a broad lter
22 Data Reduction and Calibration
Four to ve exposures were taken for each target dithered in a square with edge length
5 pixels In each case one exposure was short enough to ensure that the nucleus was not
saturated The data were reduced using the STIS package in IRAFs STSDAS suite The
bias and dark frames were subtracted and the images at-elded using the routine STIS
reduction process CRREJ was used to perform cosmic ray rejection
Most of the long exposures resulted in over-exposure and bleeding of the BL Lac nuclei
In each of these cases the aected pixels in the combined image were agged and replaced
with the pixels in the shorter exposure normalised according to their exposure times
23 Sky Subtraction
Accurate determination of the background level and its uncertainty is critical in this
analysis as an incorrect measurement can easily lead to the false detection of host galaxies
 5 
The background was taken to be the median in the region of each combined imaged which
was unaected by any visible source Such sources were masked well beyond their visible
extent for determination of the background
The error in the background value was calculated from two contributions the pixel-
to-pixel Poissonian shot noise P oisson and the large-scale variation in the background
level largescale The latter was taken to be the maximum of standard deviation in the
medians of a grid of 2020 pixel squares and the standard deviation in the medians of the
four quadrants of the image The nal error in the subtracted sky value was then

shown are the contour plots of the regions surrounding the targets with north indicated by
the arrow head and east indicated by the arrow tail
24 Modelling the STIS Point Spread Function
Perhaps the most critical step in extracting the properties of the host galaxies is the
accurate modelling of the Point Spread Function PSF Unlike ground-based PSFs the HST
PSF is relatively stable with time and so synchronous PSF observations are not essential
However the PSF does vary signicantly across the surface of the chip and this must be
taken into account In all images the target was within 20 pixels of the centre so such spatial
variations are minimized
Due to deciencies in the Tiny Tim model of the STIS PSF it fails to account for
extended scattered light the STIS ghost loop and an asymmetric bulge near the PSFs
centre we elected to model the PSF with archival images of well-centred stars taken with
STIS in the F2850LP lter Highly over-exposed stellar images were used to model the
PSF wings while unsaturated images were used to model the central regions Figure 2 shows
the nal composite stellar PSF The ghost loop a reection feature in the STIS PSF was
found to vary signicantly even with small positional osets and so we simply mask this
feature in all of the analysis to follow
Given the potential inaccuracies in the STIS PSF extreme care was taken to account
for its uncertainties Deviations in the PSF arise from spatial variations time variations
and spectral variations The stars that were averaged to make our composite PSF have
dierent spectral types were taken at dierent times and are oset from each other spatially
 6 
although all are still relatively close to the centre Thus the deviations observed among
these PSFs should reect the potential dierence between the composite PSF and our data
We dene the uncertainty in each pixel of the composite PSF model to be the maximum
dierence between that pixel value and the corresponding pixels in the component stellar
images This gave a conservative uncertainty map which was used in the two-dimensional
host galaxy tting
25 Host Galaxy Fitting
Host galaxy properties were measured using two-dimensional model tting The models
comprised the stellar PSF 24 centred on an analytic galaxy model The host galaxies
were modelled with the following prole types a de Vaucouleurs r14 law an exponential disk
r1 law and a composite de Vaucouleurs plus exponential disk model The free parameters
tted for each host galaxy prole type were PSF normalization host galaxy normalization
two normalizations for the composite model host galaxy characteristic radius again two
parameters for the composite model ellipticity and position angle
Certain parameters were limited or xed as the quality of the data did not justify more
detailed tting The point source was xed at the centre of the galaxy as this is observed to
be the case all in low redshift BL Lacs Urry et al 2000 The galaxy models were limited
to the three prole types described as we are primarily interested in distinguishing between
disk- and bulge-dominated morphologies Modelling more detailed proles such as via the
Sersic index is beyond the scope of these data
Before tting images were carefully masked to eliminate all irregular features such as
close companions and tidal structure along with several pixels beyond the visible edges of
these features The centre-most few pixels of the nucleus are highly sensitive to sampling
errors The values of these pixels will depend strongly on exactly where in the pixel the
point-like nucleus falls If the model PSF is oset even slightly from this by as much as
005 of a pixel large errors will occur in the t as these central pixels strongly weight our
tting statistic To remedy this we sum the pixel values within a central circle with a 7-pixel
diameter and treat this as a single data point As a side-benet this process greatly reduces
the potential error due to an inaccurately modelled PSF
In all cases but that of 2240260 the ts indicated the presence host galaxies The
residuals of 0820225 1144379 1249174 1422580 and 1533535 were smooth and
either circularly or elliptically symmetric about the nucleus The residuals of 0138097
0235164 and 1308326 were less convincing so great care was taken to determine the
condence of the detections
 7 
251 Detection Criteria and Upper Limits
To determine whether the apparent host galaxy detections were signicant we tted
each image with the PSF alone and compared the 2 values of the best PSF-only t to the
best PSF  host galaxy t via the F-test We required that the model including the host
galaxy be preferred over the PSF-only t with 99 condence
To make certain that we did not mistake improperly subtracted background light for
the host galaxy we also perform the ts with the background over-subtracted by 2sky see
23 and required that the model including the host galaxy was preferred over the PSF-only
t with 95 condence in this case
To ensure that none of the detected host galaxies were simply artifacts of a poorly-
modelled PSF we redid the ts using each of the individual stellar images as our PSF model
instead of the combined stellar PSF and required again that the host galaxy detected with
each t was preferred over the PSF-only t with 99 condence For each alternate PSF
we again require the host galaxy be preferred at 95 with the background over-subtracted
After applying these requirements it was found that ve of the nine host galaxy were de-
tected with high condence These were the host galaxies of 0820225 1144379 1249174
1422580 and 1533535 Of the remainder 0138097 0235164 and 1308326 yielded
host galaxies in the initial t but these did not meet our condence requirements when the
background was over-subtracted andor the alternate PSFs used 2240260 did not show a
detectable host galaxy in any of the ts
Figure 3 shows the one-dimensional azimuthally averaged proles of both the data and
the best ts Galaxy proles are presented only in cases where the PSF  host galaxy
model is preferred over the PSF-only model according to the initial resolution criterion ie
for 0138097 and 0235164 and the exponential disk t of 1308326 where the model was
rejected only after increasing the sky background or after tting with an alternate PSF we
still present the best-t PSF  galaxy proles
Figure 4 shows the images with PSF subtracted For the detections we use the best
PSF normalization from the de Vaucouleurs t and for the non-detections we use the best
PSF-only t For the detections we also show the images with best-t PSF  de Vaucouleurs
model subtracted
As a last check we take the ratio of light in a aperture of radius 35 pixels around the
 8 
centre to the light an annulus from 15 to 50 pixels and compare to the same ratio for the
PSF In all ve of the condent detections the BL Lac image showed a signicant excess
of light in the annulus indicating the presence of host galaxies In the non-detections the
excess was marginal
For the non-detections we determined the upper limit on the host galaxy magnitude
by nding the maximum amount of host galaxy which could be added before the PSF 
host galaxy t became worse than the PSF-only t at the 99 condence level by an F-test
In these cases the galaxy model used was a de Vaucouleurs model with zero ellipticity and
an eective radius of 10 kpc  slightly higher than the median found for the low redshift
BL Lac hosts of 85 kpc Urry et al 2000 This is conservative as it will give a slightly
higher upper limit than for the median re
252 Uncertainty Analysis and Resolving Morphologies
The uncertainty in each tted parameter was determined by mapping 2 around the best
t To account for the uncertainty in the background subtraction the ts were performed
and the 2 volume was mapped with the background both under- and over-subtracted by
sky see 23 The uncertainty in each parameter was then the maximum displacement
from that parameter on the one-sigma hypersurface of the 2 volume
For a statistically signicant preference of one prole type over the other we again
employ the F-test requiring that their minimum 2 values dier with 99 condence In
most cases the de Vaucouleurs model was marginally preferred over the exponential disk
model however in only two of these cases was the preference signicant  for 0820225 and
1422580 In no cases was the exponential disk prole preferred over the de Vaucouleurs
prole with high condence
As might be expected the composite de Vaucouleurs  exponential disk model gave a
better t than either the de Vaucouleurs or exponential disk model alone Typically the
improvement in the t was marginal  at less than 90 condence according to the F-test in
all cases but 0820225 for which the three-component model was preferred over the best-t
two-component model with 90 condence
A number of the de Vaucouleurs model ts gave unphysically large eective radii sug-
gesting that the t may be trying to compensate for an extended disky component Restrict-
ing the PSF  de Vaucouleurs model to more physical scale lengths  requiring re  20 kpc
 then the composite galaxy model is preferred over the new best-t PSF  de Vaucouleurs
model for 0820225 at the 99 condence level If we apply the same condition to the rest of
 9 
the sample both 1422580 and 1533535 prefer the composite model at  95 condence
and 1144379 at the  90 level
Figure 3 shows 2 contours projected onto the mhostre plane for the de Vaucouleurs
and exponential ts of the resolved sources
26 K Corrections and Filter Conversions
Cousins R band absolute magnitudes are presented for purposes of comparison with the
low redshift BL Lacs in Urry et al 2000 These corrections were performed by assuming
SEDs for both the host galaxies and the nuclei The models of Bruzual  Charlot 1993
were used for the host galaxy SEDs calibrated to the galaxy colours reported in Fukugita
Shimasaku  Ichikawa 1995 a Hubble-type Ea spectrum B  R  157 for correcting
the de Vaucouleurs ts and a Hubble-type Sab B  R  134 for the exponential ts A
power law SED with   1 was assumed for the BL Lac nuclei
For the lter conversions the redshifted SED was convolved with the transmission
curve for the F2850LP lter and then normalised to the best-t host galaxy magnitudes
K corrections were performed assuming H0  70 km s1Mpc1 M  03   07 the
cosmology used throughout
The level of uncertainty in the host galaxy spectral corrections is potentially very
large For sources at these redshifts the F2850LP lter samples well below the rest-
frame 4000A break and hence is highly sensitive to the star formation history of the galaxy
Uncertainties may be as large as 06 mag if the high-redshift host galaxies have colours closer
to those of spiral galaxies rather than the red colours observed at low redshift Scarpa et al
2000a or even as large as 1 mag if they contain a strong starburst component The quoted
absolute magnitudes should be interpreted with this in mind
Galactic extinction was corrected using the relation to HI column density from Shull 
Van Steenberg 1995 EB  V   logNHI2172 cm2mag1
3 Host Galaxy Results
The results of the ts for the single-component galaxy models and the PSF-only model
are given in Table 2 Table 3 shows the results for the composite galaxy models

rected assuming an early-type spectrum is MR  243 mag This is much brighter than
the average magnitude of MR  2285 mag measured for the lower redshift BL Lac host
galaxies in Urry et al 2000 This strongly suggests that there has been signicant lu-
minosity evolution between the two samples even taking into account the presence of the
high upper limits in this sample The average magnitude remains high even if a much
bluer spectrum is used for K corrections 237 mag for a Hubble-type Sab spectrum and
2351 mag for a 1 Gyr-old burst population
32 Host Galaxy Morphologies
We were able to resolve complex morphologies in two cases Both 0820225 and
1422580 clearly have bulge-dominated host galaxies The eective radii derived from al-
most all of the de Vaucouleurs ts are very large although the sizable errors on these radii
encompass more sensible smaller values Nonetheless the derived radii of 0820225 and
1533535 are unphysically large These large scale sizes may indicate that some of the
host galaxies in this sample may have substantial disk components as well as bulges The
bulge  disk host galaxy model is preferred with high signicance for 0820225 and with
marginal signicance for 1422580 and 1533535
Two of the unresolved sources 0235164 and 1308326 show a signicant amount of
extended light which is t well by an exponential disk component This light can also be
accounted for as resulting from an imperfectly subtracted sky at the limit of the errors in
the sky subtraction and in the case of 0235164 at the limit of the potential variation
in the PSF As such the two are considered non-detections However many of the host
galaxies show the same excess of extended light above the best-t de Vaucouleurs prole It
is possible that these non-detections are actually disky hosts on large scales These sources
would require longer integration times to condently resolve the host galaxies
33 Close Environments and Evidence of Interactions
Most of the BL Lacs in this sample appear to have close companions nearby irregular
structure or both 1533535 is the only source that has no such observable features It
is impossible to judge in the case of 0235164 because of the known intervening system
 11 
Discounting this BL Lac ve out of the remaining eight have apparent companions within
a projected distance of 50 kpc and four of the eight show signs of recent interactions either
companions within 10 kpc or irregular structure
This sample diers from the broader BL Lac sample of Urry et al 2000 which ex-
hibited close companions within 50 kpc in 47 of cases rather than the 625 as observed
here Very few of the broader sample showed signs of recent interactions compared to 50
of this sample
34 Notes on Individual Objects
0138097 The host galaxy of this BL Lac appeared to be marginally resolved using the
composite stellar PSF With two of the alternate stellar PSFs however it produced ts which
were not suciently better than the PSF-only t Thus it is considered unresolved The
diculty in resolving this host galaxy is compounded by the presence of a bright companion
object 144 105 kpc to the southwest of the nucleus and more structure within 5
0235164 The eld of this object is complex with bright structure extending to  3
 30 kpc from the nucleus This structure has been well-studied in the past eg Stickel et
al 1988 Yanni York  Gallagher 1989 Abraham et al 1993 Falomo 1996 and is known
to be an intervening system with redshift z  0524 These STIS data resolve the complex
structure in signicantly more detail than previous observations but we leave its analysis to
a later work
Fortunately the extended structure is concentrated to the south of the nucleus leaving
most of northern half clear for our host galaxy analysis A host galaxy appeared resolved
using the composite stellar PSF however when an alternate stellar PSF was used and the
background was over-subtracted to its uncertainty limit it was not preferred over the PSF-
only t with sucient condence and so is considered unresolved
0820225 The host galaxy of this source is the best resolved of the sample thanks
to the relatively faint nucleus Although the host has a strong bulge component a model
including both bulge and disk components provides a signicantly better t than the bulge-
only model if eective radius of the bulge is restricted to  20 kpc A compact companion
galaxy is also resolved at 07 55 kpc to the west of the nucleus
1144379 This host galaxy is resolved although not suciently well to distinguish
between a bulge- or disk-dominated morphology A very faint arc-like wisp is resolved at
225 18 kpc to the northwest of the nucleus
 12 
1249174 This host galaxy is denitely resolved however there was insucient infor-
mation to constrain its morphology A bright elongated structure is resolved extending from
08 to 18 5 to 13 kpc to the northwest of the nucleus while two compact objects are
visible at  10 from the BL Lac
1308326 The host galaxy of this source is well tted by an exponential disk prole
However it cannot be condently distinguished from the PSF if the background is over-
subtracted to its uncertainty limit and so it is considered unresolved Two bright compact
companion objects are within 6 48 kpc of the BL Lac while a number of fainter objects
are within half that distance
1422580 This host galaxy is well-resolved and a de Vaucouleurs prole provides a
signicantly better t than an exponential disk prole A host galaxy model including both
bulge and disk components provides a marginally better t The host galaxy appears smooth
and is clearly elongated with an axial ratio of 08 Several compact companion objects are
in the near vicinity of the BL Lac some faint ones within  15 13 kpc
1533535 Another well-resolved smooth-looking host galaxy although in this case the
morphology could not be constrained This may be due to the presence of a disk component
as the best-t de Vaucouleurs eective radius is unphysically large A de Vaucouleurs  ex-
ponential prole gives a marginally better t than the de Vaucouleurs-only model
2240260 The host galaxy of this source is unresolved A few compact objects lie to
the northeast  6 45 kpc from the BL Lac
4 Host Galaxy Evolution
To study the evolution of BL Lac host galaxies we combine the STIS observations
described above hereafter referred to as the high-z sample with the lower-redshift BL Lacs
observed in the WFPC2 snapshot survey those with z  06 hereafter the low-z sample
The results of the host galaxy analysis for these 63 low-z BL Lacs are listed in Table 4 and
the details of the analysis described in Scarpa et al 2000
The STIS F2850LP lter samples the rest-frame U to V bands at redshifts z  06
and so is particularly sensitive to star formation This fact has enabled us to detect BL Lac
host galaxies at greater distances than previously achieved However the star formation his-
tories of the high-z BL Lacs are unknown and thus the lter conversions and K corrections
are highly uncertain Any measurement of luminosity evolution in absolute magnitude space
would be subject to large errors However from NICMOS imaging of 10 low redshift BL Lacs
 13 
Scarpa et al 2000a we know that these host galaxies have colours consistent with old stel-
lar populations At the same time conversion from F702W to F2850LP magnitudes at
lower redshifts is far less sensitive to star formation history than conversion from F2850LP
to F702W at higher redshifts To minimise correction uncertainties we perform the analysis
of host galaxy luminosity evolution using the measured F2850LP apparent magnitudes of
the high-redshift sample corrected only for galactic extinction and the derived F2850LP
apparent magnitudes of the low-redshift sources converted from the measured F702W ap-
parent magnitudes The lter conversions used for the low-z sample are not xed but rather
varied within the tting process described in 41
The host galaxy brightnesses of the combined sample are then compared to models
of galaxy luminosity evolution These models are derived using the GISSEL evolutionary
synthesis models of Bruzual  Charlot 1993 with a Salpeter IMF Salpeter 1955 with
the Padova 2000 library of isochrones Girardi et al 2000 and the BaSeL standard stellar
library Lejeune Cuisinier  Buser 1997
Figure 5 shows the STIS F2850LP Hubble diagram for the host galaxies with the low-z
sample lter conversions performed assuming a solar metallicity burst population calibrated
to match the typical early-type colour of B  V  096 Fukugita Shimasaku  Ichikawa
1995 Also shown is the line for a non-evolving population with the same early-type spec-
trum dashed line and a non-evolving late-type spectrum solar metallicity age  8 Gyrs
star formation rate decay exponent   3 matching the Hubble type Sab colours of
B  V  057 Fukugita Shimasaku  Ichikawa 1995 dotted line The high redshift host
galaxies appear to be more luminous than predicted by the non-evolving models However
the large error bars and the presence of non-detections in both the high-z and low-z samples
necessitate rigorous testing
41 2 Fitting with Censored Data
The presence of host galaxy non-detections in some of the higher redshift objects means
that the apparent luminosity evolution may just be a selection eect Great care must be
taken in dealing with the non-detections and for this we employ survival analysis techniques
The technique developed to apply survival analysis to the tting of evolution models
is derived from the EM algorithm Dempster Laird  Rubin 1977 This algorithm uses
maximum likelihood to estimate the regression coecients of a 2-dimensional data set and
assumes that the censored data points have a normal distribution about the regression line
This regression line is determined iteratively with the estimates for the weighting of the
 14 
censored data points updated at each iteration The assumption of a normal distribution
makes the EM method less general than other non-parametric methods but given that the
host galaxy luminosities have a roughly-normal distribution at low redshifts this assumption
seems reasonable
As we are tting the apparent magnitudes rather than the absolute magnitudes we cant
perform a simple regression analysis Instead of iterating over regression line estimates we
iterate over evolution models If we assume that each galaxy consists of a single co-evolving
population then each model is dened by two parameters magnitude zero point and either
population age or formation redshift zf orm for the non-evolving and passively evolving
models respectively
Each iteration in population age or formation redshift implies a set of lter corrections
for the low-z sample Although there are only small dierences in the lter correction between
dierent galaxy models at low redshift we wish to calculate 2 given the measured F702W
magnitudes not the inferred F2850LP magnitudes for each evolution model With this
in mind we apply a new self-consistent spectral correction for each new population age
or formation redshift rather than assume the same correction for all iterations For the
moment we assume solar metallicity in all models
411 Single-Population Passive and Non-Evolving Models
The passively evolving stellar population yielding the best t to the F2850LP apparent
magnitudes of our sample has a formation redshift of zf orm  18 with a reduced 2 of 137
The 1 uncertainties are 07  03 and the 3 uncertainties are 10  05 A better t
by a model with high formation redshift can be ruled out with high certainty  zf orm  30
yields a reduced 2 of 198 while zf orm  5 gives a reduced 2 of 235 An F-test 72 data
points and 2 degrees of freedom indicate a worse t than the zf orm  18 model with 95
and 99 signicance respectively
The data are also reasonably well t by an extremely young non-evolving population
The best t is for a population of age 002 Gyr with reduced 2  151  a worse t than
the passive model although without statistical signicance A population as young as 1 Gyr
provides a poor t to the data with reduced 2  213 worse than the best passive model
at the 975 signicance level and worse than the 002 Gyr model at the 95 signicance
level A population of age 25 Gyrs gives a reduced 2 of 238 worse than the passive model
at the 99 level Similar results are obtained for models of non-evolving late-type galaxy
spectra with the same B  V colours as the burst models
 15 
The young populations needed to t the data do not agree with the colours observed
in BL Lac host galaxies at low redshift From Scarpa et al 2000a we know that these
galaxies have R  H  23  03 consistent with an old stellar population At the blue-most
limit these colours imply age  5 Gyrs for a burst population Fitting the normalization of
a non-evolving model with age  5 Gyrs results in a reduced 2 of 305 An F-test indicates
that the passive evolution model gives a better t than the 5 Gyr non-evolving model at the
999 signicance level
Figure 6 shows the Hubble diagrams with the best-t passive and non-evolving mod-
els top and middle In each case the low-z host galaxies are converted from F702W to
F2850LP magnitudes assuming the corrections implied by the evolution model plotted with
a solid line Visual inspection of the Hubble diagrams shows that the non-evolving model
predicts galaxies about one magnitude too faint at z  06 Even much younger non-evolving
models 1 Gyrs middle dashed line fail to reproduce the high redshift colours although
an unphysically young model 002 Gyrs middle dotted line does t Passive evolution
models with high formation redshifts similarly underestimate the brightness of the z  06
host galaxies as can be seen by the zf orm  5 model top dashed line
412 Dual-Population Evolution Model
While the above results indicate that the luminosity evolution is better t by a model
that includes a rapidly evolving stellar population it may not be the entire population
that is evolving If an old stellar population is already in place then a fresh burst of star
formation involving only a fraction of the galaxys mass may also reproduce the observed
evolution We t the data with a model that comprised a passively evolving stellar population
superimposed with a second population This second population remains at constant low
age down to a given redshift after which it also evolves passively to simulate a normally
evolving galaxy with some degree of ongoing star formation which dies out at some point
The model now includes ve parameters magnitude oset formation redshift of the primary
population zf orm the point at which the secondary population begins to evolve passively
z percentage mass of the secondary population relative to the primary m and the initial
age of the secondary population age
A wide range of parameters provided ts of similar quality to the best-t one-component
model For a primary population with a high formation redshift zf orm  4 a secondary
population of at least 1 of the mass of the primary depending on z and age produces
reasonable ts For a small secondary component of 1 to 3 z can be as low as  05 while
still agreeing with the red colours observed in low-redshift BL Lac host galaxies The best
 16 
t was found for m of 2 z  06 age  1 Gyr and zf orm  5 with reduced 2  129
The bottom panel of gure 6 shows the best-t dual-population evolution model solid
line The dashed line in this plot shows the evolution of the zf orm  5 base population
Although we cant distinguish between single- and dual-population models we can say
with high condence that the observed luminosity evolution is signicantly better represented
by models which include star formation activity in the range 05  z  25 which diminishes
rapidly or ceases altogether below z  05 than it is by models in which the galaxies are
undergoing steady star formation to low redshift or by models in which all star formation
activity had ceased by z  25
42 Eects of Metallicity and Dust
Given our knowledge of the red colours of low redshift BL Lac host galaxies these
data show conclusively that higher redshift BL Lac hosts are both signicantly bluer and
signicantly brighter than their low redshift counterparts This change is well modelled as
evolution of the stellar population however evolution in metallicity or the presence of dust
may also play a part
421 Evolution in Metallicity
The evolution results given so far are for populations with constant solar metallicities
If the galaxies at higher redshift have much lower metallicities the data can be tted with
older stellar populations We simulate non-solar metallicities using the models of Westera et
al 2002
Taking the host galaxies with z  06 to have extremely low metallicity  002 solar 
and those with z  06 to have solar metallicity the best-t passively evolving population
has zf orm  23 08
07 1errors with reduced 2  128 better at 97 condence than a
zf orm  5 model reduced 2  207 The same metallicity evolution allows non-evolving
populations to t better A population with age  1 Gyr gives reduced 2  199 worse
than the best-t passive model with only 95 condence instead of 975 for a constant
solar metallicity However this population still does not satisfy the low-redshift R  H
colour constraint
Of course a sudden transition from 002 solar to 1 solar metallicity at z  06 is not
realistic however this scenario provides a limit on the extent to which metallicity evolution
 17 
can aect the results
422 Eects of Dust Reddening on the Fits
The presence of large amounts of dust in the host galaxies could potentially result in
extreme reddening  enough to give a young population the R  H colours observed in low
redshift BL Lacs However there is a limit to how much dust can be added as the preferential
extinction caused by dust at shorter wavelengths makes the high-redshift population fainter
worsening the t
We applied models of dust extinction from Ferrara et al 1999 to our spectral evolution
models to determine whether a dust-reddened non-evolving population could produce a
reasonable t to the data with the constraint that the low-redshift z  04 host galaxies
have R  H  20 the bluest possible based on the NICMOS observations after dust
reddening The extinction model which achieved this most eciently was one based on the
Milky Way extinction curve assuming an elliptical galaxy geometry with a Jae density
prole and a central V-band optical depth of V 0  2 With this model a non-evolving
1 Gyr-old population has R  H  2 at low redshift and ts our Hubble diagram with
reduced 2  221 This is worse than the best-t passive model at the 98 level by the
F-test To substantially improve this t worse only at the 95 level a 06 Gyr population
is needed which with this dust model has R  H  17  certainly far too blue for the
low-redshift host galaxies
Thus no non-evolving dust model can make a non-evolving stellar population t the
data The level of dust reddening needed even for these relatively poor ts V 0  2 is
at the upper limit of dust optical depths estimated in ellipticals by Wise  Silva 1996 or
face-on spirals by Kuchinski et al 1998 and is substantially higher that the limit predicted
for ellipticals by Goudfrooij  de Jong 1995 of V 0  07 who nd more typical values
of V 0  02  03
423 Evolution in Dust Content
It is possible to reproduce the observed luminosity evolution for a non- or weakly-
evolving population if dust content is allowed to increase rapidly between z  08 and  04
Large changes at lower redshifts fail to t the weak evolution seen at low-redshift and
extending the dust evolution to higher redshifts means that there is too much attenuation
to reproduce the bright host galaxies at z  06
 18 
Assuming that the galaxies are relatively dust-free at z  08 and that optical depth
in dust increases linearly to z  04 the minimum nal optical depth required to produce a
reasonable t to the data and to satisfy the low-z R  H  2 constraint is V 0  8 This
allows a non-evolving model as young as 08 Gyrs to t the data with reduced 2  154
within 1 of the best-t passive evolution model
Of course V 0  8 is extremely high  over an order of magnitude higher than the
typical values determined for local ellipticals and several times higher than those determined
for star-forming galaxies eg Calzetti 2001 If we assume a local optical depth of V 0  2
the upper limit predicted for ellipticals then the best-t non-evolving evolution model gives
reduced 2  201  still worse than the best passive model at the 95 level
Approximately same level of dust evolution is required to make a passively evolving
population with high formation redshift t the data A population with zf orm  5 requires
a local optical depth of V 0  10 for reduced 2  152 while the same population with
V 0  2 at z  0 gives reduced 2  209  worse than the zf orm  18 model at 97
condence
A concurrent evolution in metallicity will allow these models to t the data with a smaller
increase in dust content Using the metallicity evolution described above the minimum
local optical depth needed for a 2 Gyr-old non-evolving or a zf orm  5 passively evolving
population to t the data within 1 of the best passive model is V 0  5 reduced 2 
15 This is still an extreme increase in dust content If V 0  2 locally then these models
are worse than the best passive model at the 95 condence level
Figure 7 shows the Hubble diagram with both the non-evolving and passive evolution
models dust and metallicity evolution included
43 Absolute Luminosity Evolution
The lack of extended emission line light or a big blue bump has made it possible to use
the extremely sensitive F2850LP lter in this study However to compare our evolution
results directly to other studies it is necessary to determine this evolution in absolute near-
infrared magnitudes This result depends strongly on the K corrections used To nd the full
range of possible magnitude-redshift gradients we perform regression analysis on absolute
K-band magnitudes using the range of K corrections implied by the full range of possible
evolutionary models from the above analysis
We use the EM algorithm to perform regression analysis while accounting for the cen-
 19 
sored data points via the IRAF task EMMETHOD This task by itself does not take error
bars into account As the uncertainties in host galaxy magnitudes increase with redshift
they are an important consideration To account for them we use a Monte Carlo approach
One hundred simulated data sets were generated randomizing each detected data point over
a composite normal distribution with the widths of the upper and lower halves of the dis-
tribution dened by the upper and lower error values for that data point The regression
coecients and their uncertainties were determined for each of these 100 simulated data set
with EM method and the nal coecients taken to be the mean values The uncertainty
values were taken to be the mean of the individual uncertainties in the regression coe-
cients added in quadrature with the standard deviation of the coecients across the 100
simulations
The steepest slope occurs when K corrections are derived from the evolutionary model
with the oldest possible population at high redshift at the 3 level assuming no dust or
metallicity evolution  the passive evolution model with zf orm  28 The shallowest
slope is in the case of the youngest possible high-z population also at the 3 level  a
passive model with zf orm  13 Unsurprisingly the best-t passive evolution model with
zf orm  18 gives a gradient about halfway between these The results of the regression
analysis using these three sets of K corrections are shown in Table 5
A similar range of gradients are obtained if we assume a secondary burst component
added to an older population with a lower limit of 059 magz for a passive old population
plus a 01 Gyr burst involving 3 of the galaxys mass which itself passively evolves below
z  05 For a constant-age old population or a population with high formation redshift
we obtain  17 magz To obtain high redshift K-band magnitudes consistent with no
K-band luminosity evolution the stellar populations at z  06 must have ages less than
02 Gyrs Such star formation histories can only be made to t the observed Hubble diagram
and satisfy the low-redshift colour constraints with extreme levels of dust evolution from
V 0  0 to V 0  5 between z  08 and 04
Using the best t to the Hubble diagram to derive K corrections and adding in quadra-
ture the error in the regression analysis to the probable range of slopes from dierent K
corrections we determine the overall K-band luminosity evolution of BL Lac host galax-
ies to be 10  045 magz Figure 8 shows absolute K-band magnitude versus redshift K
corrected assuming a passively evolving population with zf orm  18 Also plotted are the
best-t linear regression lines representing the magnitude-redshift gradients derived assuming
the three dierent passive evolution models

5 Discussion
We detect luminosity evolution in BL Lac host galaxies consistent with the primary
stellar population evolving strongly from 15  z  25 or with a smaller burst of star
formation evolving from z  05 and inconsistent with a non-evolving population or a
population evolving passively from high redshift
Interestingly this formation epoch for
the primary population corresponds roughly to the epoch of maximum quasar activity eg
Maloney  Petrosian 1999 Shaver et al 1999 This is consistent with a scenario in which
black hole feeding and growth  ie the epoch of maximum AGN activity  coincides with
the formation of the surrounding bulge Kormendy  Gebhardt 2001
Radio galaxies Djorgovski Spinrad  Marr 1985 Spinrad 1986 Spinrad  Djorgovski
1987 Lilly  Longair 1982 Lilly Longair  Allington-Smith 1985 Aragon-Salamanca et
al 1993 McLure  Dunlop 2000 and the hosts of radio-loud quasars Lehnert et al 1999
Kukula et al 2001 Hutchings 2001 exhibit similar evolution probably dimming by of order
1 magnitude in K between z  1 and 0 Although this evolution is not as well constrained
it is consistent with that seen in our sample This is in agreement with the unied model
of AGN in which radio galaxies radio quasars and blazars are expected to have the same
host galaxy properties In contrast BCGs Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 other quiescent
early-types Lilly et al 1995 Stanford et al 1998 Bell et al 2004 and radio-quiet quasar
hosts Kukula et al 2001 Rix et al 2001 Ridgway et al 2001 exhibit at or even negative
luminosity evolution with local galaxies appearing as bright or brighter than those at z  1
Thus the hosting of a powerful radio jet seems to be linked to a galaxys luminosity evolution
The luminosity evolution of BL Lac host galaxies is unambiguous not aected by the
biases inherent in other radio-loud classes see 1 We can therefore ascribe the evolution
observed in BL Lac hosts to a real change in galaxy luminosities which in turn grants us
more condence that the evolution observed in other radio-loud hosts is real
Furthermore BL Lacs allow us signicantly more condence that the observed evolution
is a luminosity evolution in individual host galaxies There is mounting evidence to suggest
that BL Lac objects are long-lived possibly with lifespans on the same timescales as galaxy
evolution The most compelling is the at possibly negative number density evolution of
many BL Lacs Morris et al 1991 Giommi Menna  Padovani 1999 Bade et al 1998
Perlman et al 1996 There are as many if not more BL Lac objects now than during the
epoch of peak quasar activity The low accretion rates in BL Lacs less than 1 Eddington
ODowd Urry  Scarpa 2002 Wang Staubert  Ho 2002 also suggest that BL Lacs may
burn stably for extended periods If the jets of BL Lacs obtain most of their power from the
rotational energy of the black hole eg Blandford  Zjanek 1977 Meier 2002 they are
expected to have lifespans of the order of gigayears Cavaliere  Malquori 1999 Long-lived
 21 
emission is also supported by their dynamically evolved state at low redshift eg Urry et
al 2000 compared to the high frequency of interaction remnants and close companions at
higher redshifts see 33 Thus with BL Lacs we may be observing luminosity evolution
intrinsic to the host galaxies themselves rather than evolution in the processes which select
galaxies as hosts of radio-loud AGN
Our results are consistent with and conrm the results of the ground-based study of
Heidt et al 2004 who nd evidence of luminosity evolution in BL Lac host galaxies
although do not constrain this evolution Of the sources which overlap the two samples 
0820225 1249174 1422580 and 2240260  Heidt et al detect the host of 0820225
Our host galaxy magnitudes for this source agree within error although our eective radii
do not We believed that this stems from the uncertainty and width of the ground-based
PSF of order that of the host itself in some cases
51 Possible Causes of Luminosity Evolution
Both quiescent early-type galaxies and radio-quiet AGN host galaxies are gaining lu-
minous mass up to the present in line with the predictions of hierarchical clustering models
Kaumann  Haehnelt 2000 therefore the luminosity of these galaxies does not change
with time This does not appear to be the case with the host galaxies of radio-loud AGN
whose dimming over cosmic time is apparently not oset by the accretion of signicantly
amounts of new material A number of eects may contribute to this
Evolution linked to emission processes Low redshift radio-loud AGN used in evolution
studies are dominated by sources with low accretion onto their SMBHs such as the FR I
and low-power FR II radio galaxies in the 3C sample in which luminosity evolution has
been best studied These are also the proposed parent population of BL Lacs Urry 
Padovani 1995 If a large fraction of these AGN are long-lived jet-dominated sources then
we select against active recent merger histories when we observe them locally Continued
merger events following an AGNs formation epoch will refuel the nucleus after depletion of
the initial supply of gas and possibly disrupt stable jet-dominated emission Cavaliere 
Padovani 1989 as well as add luminous mass to the galaxy osetting the dimming due to
an aging primary stellar population
Evolution Linked to Black Hole Properties While the production of a radio jet is
likely to be linked to the properties of the central SMBH it is uncertain exactly which black
hole properties are important in determining radio loudness There is some evidence that
high black hole mass plays a part Franceschini Vercellone  Fabian 1998 Lacy et al 2001
 22 
Nagar et al 2002 Jarvis  McLure 2002 ODowd Urry  Scarpa 2002 Dunlop et al
2003 although this may just be a selection eect Woo  Urry 2002 Oshlack Webster
 Whiting 2002 Ho 2002 Black hole spin seems the more likely candidate as the critical
determinant Meier 2002 ODowd et al 2004 On the other hand high host galaxy mass
is expected to dampen radio emission Bicknell 1995 Galaxies that have extreme SMBH
properties relative to their mass should favor the production of radio jets Such SMBHs
may be expected to preferentially occur in those galaxies whose formation was completed by
higher redshifts
In the case of SMBH mass hierarchical models Kaumann  Haehnelt 2000 predict
that earlier-formed galaxies will have higher SMBH-to-host galaxy mass ratios due to the
larger amounts of cold gas available for accretion at earlier epochs A correlation has even
been observed between the fraction of a galaxys mass in the black hole and the age of its
stellar population Merrield et al 2000
In the case of spin a black hole of a given mass that is formed from a small number of
major merger events is likely to have a higher spin than one of the same mass formed from
many less massive mergers as the angular momenta of these lesser interactions will tend to
cancel out unless they are correlated Cavaliere  Padovani 1989 Locally this means black
holes of given mass which formed during the epoch of major mergers at z 1  2 will have
higher spin than whose whose formation proceeded to the present
According to the scenarios outlined above when we select radio sources at low redshift
we are dominated by low-accretion AGN with extreme SMBH properties that are prefer-
entially produced at higher redshifts and that should have had relatively quiescent merger
histories since the epoch of formation of their central engines We have more credible evi-
dence that radio-loud AGN do exhibit just such merger histories supporting the idea that
the properties of radio-loud AGN SMBHs are typically dened at high redshift
52 The Merger History of Radio Hosts
In 33 it was found that many of the BL Lacs in the high-z sample have either close
companions 625 or signs of recent interactions 50 Fewer of the broader sample of
Urry et al 2000 had close companions 47 and only a handful 10 showed signs of
interactions This supports the idea that the high-z BL Lacs are closer to their formation
epoch and that the observed luminosity evolution is linked to the merger history of these
host galaxies
It is impossible to perform a such a comparison over a similar redshift range for other
 23 
radio-loud AGN as ux limits induce a power-redshift correlation Locally however FR I
radio galaxies which are thought to be the primary parent population of BL Lac objects
do show fewer signs of recent interactions than the more powerful FR IIs Heckman et al
1986 Smith  Heckman 1989 with the latter hosted by bluer galaxies and showing a much
higher incidence of distorted morphologies
These observations along with the scenarios outlined in 51 point to a scheme in
which radio-loud AGN are formed in major mergers typically at high redshift while those
observed locally have evolved from a signicantly earlier formation epoch relatively free of
further interactions
Given this picture it is expected that cluster environment will play a critical role in
governing when and where radio-loud AGN form and survive Formation will be dictated by
a balance between a high density environment clusters for merger frequency and low cluster
velocity dispersion high redshift clusters or local eld to permit full mergers Makino 
Ebisuzaki 1996 Survival as jet-dominated sources to low redshift will favour lower density
environments as we require fewer ongoing merger events BL Lacs do prefer relatively poor
cluster environments at low redshift z  04 of Abel richness class 0 to 1 Falomo
Pesce  Treves 1993 Pesce Falomo  Treves 1994 Fried Stickel  Kuhr 1993 Wurtz et
al 1997 Smith ODea  Baum 1995 At higher redshifts their environments are not
well known although at z  06 at least some are found in rich clusters Fried Stickel
 Kuhr 1993 Wurtz et al 1997 This is consistent with the picture in which BL Lacs
are preferentially produced in cluster environments at high redshift when cluster velocity
dispersions were lower but survive only in the sparcer regions of these clusters Reports
on the environmental evolution of other classes of radio-loud AGN are conicting as are the
environmental dierences between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN
6 Conclusions
Nine BL Lac objects with z  06 were imaged with HST using the STIS CCD and
the F2850LP lter The host galaxies of ve of these were resolved with high condence
For all but 0820225 these are the rst detections of host galaxies in these sources and
include the two highest redshift BL Lac host galaxies detected to date These galaxies are
brightwith an average absolute magnitude of MR  243 mag assuming an early-type
spectrum and 237 mag assuming a late-type spectrum
The morphologies of two of the galaxies were well resolved Both 1422580 and 0820225
are better t by a de Vaucouleurs prole than by an exponential disk prole indicating bulge
 24 
dominated hosts as is typical for radio-loud AGN However the host galaxy of 0820225
was signicantly better t by a composite model including both bulge and disk components
than by a bulge component alone Many including some of those technically considered
non-detections show evidence of having extended disky components A large fraction of
the sample show evidence of close companions and distorted morphologies  far more than
are observed at lower redshift
Combining the derived host galaxy magnitudes with the low redshift host galaxies from
Urry et al 2000 we measure luminosity evolution in a sample of 72 HST-imaged BL Lac
host galaxies spanning the range 0  z  1 We nd that the Hubble diagram is well t by
a model of a stellar population evolving passively from z  18 07
03 Alternatively an older
population with a small fraction 3 undergoing active star formation to z  05 also
ts the data well A single population undergoing passive evolution from a high formation
redshift zf orm  5 can be ruled out with high condence By constraining the colours of the
low redshift host galaxies based on NICMOS observations models including no luminosity
evolution can also be ruled out with high condence Non-evolving and high-zf orm passive
evolution models are still ruled out when reasonable models of dust and metallicity evolution
are included
By K-correcting the host galaxy magnitudes based on the range of acceptable ts to
the Hubble diagram we determined an average K-band luminosity evolution of 10  045
magnitudes per unit redshift
The fact that ux selection of BL Lacs is dominated by beaming angle rather than
intrinsic brightness together with the low levels of extended emission from ionized gas and
scattered nucleur light in these sources mean that they are relatively free of the biases af-
fecting quasar studies This increases our condence that the observed luminosity evolution
is real and in turn in the luminosity evolution observed in other classes of radio-loud AGN
We also have reason to believe that the observed evolution is intrinsic to the galaxies them-
selves as evidence suggests that BL Lacs may have lifespans comparable to the timescale
for galaxy evolution
The luminosity evolution of BL Lac host galaxies is steeper than that observed in radio-
quiet host galaxies brightest cluster galaxies and quiescent early-type galaxies and is con-
sistent with that observed in other radio-loud hosts The absence of luminosity evolution in
radio-quiet and quiescent galaxies suggests that dimming due to an aging population is oset
by the accretion of new material as is predicted by hierarchical clustering models This ap-
pears not to be the case in the host galaxies of radio-loud sources which evolve strongly from
some redshift greater than z  05 but also must have experienced signicant star formation
activity in the range 05  z  25 This is further supported by the fact that BL Lacs with
 25 
z  06 are much more frequently in interacting systems and have more close companions
than those at low redshift which appear dynamically evolved These observations lead to
the following conclusions
First it seems that the physical conditions that allow a galaxy to generate a radio jet
are preferentially produced in a particular cosmic epoch albeit a broad one 05  z  25
This may be linked to the amount of gas available for fueling which is also believed to dene
the quasar epoch However to explain the radio-loudradio-quiet dichotomy it must also
be linked to the production of the right SMBH conditions
Second radio-loud AGN hosts at low redshift accrete less new material after the epoch
in which they seemingly form their SMBHs than do other early-type galaxies A number of
eects may result in the selection of inactive recent merger histories when we select radio-
loud AGN at low redshift however all point to a scenario in which many radio-loud AGN
observed at low redshift have survived from a much earlier formation epoch
The evolution observed in the stellar populations of radio-loud AGN suggests the black
holes which power these radio sources are born in gas-rich interactions at z  05 At low
redshift where samples are dominated by low-accretion sources these observations suggest
that we are observing the last embers of the radio quasar epoch  old AGN with massive
rapidly-rotating black holes which have experienced little merger activity since the formation
of their central engines

Fig 1 Central regions of STIS F2850LP images right with contour plots left
Fig 2 Two-dimensional and three-dimensional images of the composite stellar PSF con-
structed from archival STIS F2850LP images of stars
Fig 3 Azimuthally averaged proles of STIS images The upper left and right panels show
the best-t de Vaucouleur  PSF models and exponential disk  PSF models respectively
Middle panels show zoomed-in proles inset with 1 2  3 2 contours projected on mhostre
plane for cases where the host galaxy was condently detected Lower left panels show the
best-t dual-component models and lower right panels show the best-t PSF-only models
For 1308326 only the best PSF  exponential disk upper and lower left and PSF-only right
proles are shown while for 2240260 the best PSF-only prole is shown
Fig 4 BL Lac images with best-t models subtracted  top unsubtracted image mid-
dle PSF subracted normalized according to best-t de Vaucouleurs model bottom best
PSF  de Vaucouleurs model subtracted For 1308326 and 2240260 the unsubtracted
image top and best-t PSF subtraction assuming no host galaxy bottom are shown The
arrow next to the object name indicates north and east In the case of 0235164 we chose
a gray scale to bring out the detail in the surrounding structure and so the marginal host
galaxy is dicult to make out
Fig 5 Hubble diagram for BL Lac host galaxies in F2850LP magnitudes corrected for
galactic extinction The large points are the high-z sample STIS targets from this study
The small points are the low-z sample WFPC2 snapshot targets with z  06 from Urry et
al 2000 Also shown are the expected tracks of a non-evolving stellar population with an
early-type spectrum B  V  096 dashed line and a late-type spectrum B  V  057
dotted line
Fig 6 Hubble diagrams of high-z large points and low-z small points BL Lac host
galaxies Top shows the best-t passively evolving model with zf orm  18 solid line and
the zf orm  5 passive model dashed line Middle shows the best-t non-evolving model
which also ts the low-z colour constraint of R  H  2 with age  5 Gyrs solid line
as well as the age  1 Gyrs dashed line and age  002 Gyrs dotted line non-evolving
models This latter extremely young population is needed for a non-evolving population
to t the data Bottom shows a dual population solid line in which 98 of the mass
is evolving passively from zf orm  5 and 2 is undergoing active star formation with a
constant age of 1 Gyr down to z  06 after which it evolves passively

Fig 7 Hubble diagrams of high-z large points and low-z small points BL Lac host
galaxies with evolutionary models including dust and metallicity evolution Top left shows
a 08 Gyr non-evolving population with dust increasing linearly to an extreme optical depth
of V 0  8 between z  08 to 04 solid line giving a reasonable t to the data The
dashed line shows dust increasing to V 0  2 and the dotted line shows the model with
no dust both yielding poor ts Top right shows a zf orm  5 passive population with dust
increasing from V 0  0 to 10 by low redshift producing a reasonable t while an increase
to V 0  2 dashed line or a model with no dust dotted line produce poor ts Bottom
left shows the non-evolving population with metallicity increasing from 002 solar to 1 solar
at z  06 The solid line produces a reasonable t with dust also increasing to V 0  5 by
low redshifts An increase to V 0  2 dashed line produces a marginal t The dotted line
shows the model with no change in dust or metallicity Bottom right is the same as bottom
left but with a zf orm  5 passively evolving population which requires the same dust and
metallicity evolution to t the data
Fig 8 Absolute K-band magnitude versus redshift for high-z large dots and low-z small
dots BL Lac host galaxies These are K corrected assuming a redshift-dependent spectrum
determined using the evolution model which provided the best t to the Hubble diagram
passive evolution with zf orm  18 see 43 Also plotted are the best-t regression lines
derived using survival analysis to account for the upper limits The solid line shows the best
t for zf orm  18 K corrections while the other lines represent the 3 upper and lower limits
to the slope determined assuming zf orm  28 K corrections dashed line and zf orm  13
K corrections dotted line
