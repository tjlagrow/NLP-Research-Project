Abstract
We study the evolution of spectral early-type galaxies in clusters groups and the eld up to redshift 09 using the ESO Distant
Cluster SUrvey EDisCS dataset We measure structural parameters circularized half-luminosity radii Re surface brightness Ie and
velocity dispersions  for 154 cluster and 68 eld galaxies On average we achieve precisions of 10 in Re 01 dex in log Ie
and 10 in  We sample  20 of cluster and  10 of eld spectral early-type galaxies down to an I band magnitude in a
1 arcsec radius aperture of I1  22 We study the evolution of the zero point of the fundamental plane FP and conrm results
in the literature but now also for the low cluster velocity dispersion regime Taken at face value the mass-to-light ratio varies as
 log MLB  054  001z  161  001 log1  z in clusters independent of their velocity dispersion The evolution is
stronger  log MLB  076  001z  227  003 log1  z for eld galaxies A somewhat milder evolution is derived if a
correction for incompleteness is applied A rotation in the FP with redshift is detected with low statistical signicance The  and 
FP coecients decrease with redshift or equivalently the FP residuals correlate with galaxy mass and become progressively negative
at low masses The eect is visible at z  07 for cluster galaxies and at lower redshifts z  05 for eld galaxies We investigate
the size evolution of our galaxy sample In agreement with previous results we nd that the half-luminosity radius for a galaxy
with a dynamical or stellar mass of 2  1011 M
varies as 1  z1003 for both cluster and eld galaxies At the same time stellar
velocity dispersions grow with redshift as 1  z059010 at constant dynamical mass and as 1  z034014 at constant stellar mass The
measured size evolution reduces to Re  1  z0502 and   1  z041008 at xed dynamical masses and Re  1  z06804 and
  1  z019010 at xed stellar masses when the progenitor bias PB galaxies that locally are of spectroscopic early-type but are
not very old disappear progressively from the EDisCS high-redshift sample often these galaxies happen to be large in size is taken
into account Taken together the variations in size and velocity dispersion imply that the luminosity evolution with redshift derived
from the zero point of the FP is somewhat milder than that derived without taking these variations into account When considering
dynamical masses the eects of size and velocity dispersion variations almost cancel out For stellar masses the luminosity evolution
is reduced to LB  1  z10 for cluster galaxies and LB  1  z167 for eld galaxies Using simple stellar population models to
translate the observed luminosity evolution into a formation age we nd that massive  1011 M
 cluster galaxies are old with a
formation redshift z f  15 and lower mass galaxies are 3-4 Gyr younger in agreement with previous EDisCS results from color and
line index analyses This conrms the picture of a progressive build-up of the red sequence in clusters with time Field galaxies follow
the same trend but are  1Gyr younger at a given redshift and mass Taking into account the size and velocity dispersion evolution
quoted above pushes all formation ages upwards by 1 to 4 Gyr

1 Introduction
Despite their apparent simplicity the physical processes in-
volved in the formation of early-type galaxies ES0 remain
unclear The tightness of their scaling relations such as the
color-magnitude relation and their slow evolution with red-
shift are indicative of a very early and coordinated formation of
their stars eg van Dokkum et al 2000 Blakeslee et al 2003
Menanteau et al 2004 However in the CDM paradigm
these galaxies are expected to form through mergers of smaller
subsystems over a wide redshift range managing to obey these
constraints Kaumann 1996 De Lucia et al 2006
A particularly interesting relation is that of the fundamen-
tal plane hereafter FP In the parameter space of central ve-
locity dispersion  galaxy eective radius Re and eec-
tive surface brightness S Be  25 log Ie elliptical galax-
ies occupy a plane known as the FP Dressler et al 1987
Djorgovski  Davis 1987 which exhibits very little scatter
01 dex The FP is usually expressed in the form
log Re   log   S Be  ZP
where the zero point hereafter ZP is computed from the mean
values log Re log  and S Be of the sample
ZP  log Re  log   S Be
Based on the assumption of homology the existence of a FP
implies that the ratio of the total mass to luminosity ML scales
with  and Re Since the galaxy ML depends on both the star
formation history of the galaxies and the cosmology the study of
the FP is a valuable tool for studying the evolution of the stellar
population in early-type galaxies
Several
studies of
intermediate z
03 and high-
redshift z 085 clusters of galaxies have used the ZP
shift of the plane to estimate the average formation redshifts
of stars in early-type galaxies eg Bender et al 1998
van Dokkum et al 1998a Jrgensen et al 1999 Kelson et al
2000 van Dokkum  Stanford
2003 Wuyts et al 2004
Jrgensen et al 2006 In general they have all found values
compatible with a redshift formation greater than 3 In the
eld early studies found slow evolution compatible with that
in clusters eg van Dokkum et al 2001 Treu et al 2001
Kochanek et al 2000 However evidence of more rapid evo-
lution in the eld has been found by other authors Treu et al
2002 Gebhardt et al 2003 Treu et al 2005a Taking into
account the so-called progenitor bias for which lower redshift
early-type samples contain galaxies that have stopped their
star formation only recently and that will not be recognised
as early-types at higher redshifts forces a revision to slightly
lower formation redshifts van Dokkum  Franx 2001 z  2
The current view is that both the evolution of early-
type galaxies with redshift and the dependence of this evo-
lution on environment
is dierent for galaxies of dier-
ent mass These dierences manifest themselves as an evo-
increasing redshift from
lution in the FP coecient  at
12 in the B band at
redshift 00 to 08 at z08-

2004 van der Marelvan Dokkum 2007b MacArthur et al
2008 If interpreted as a M-ML ratio relation this rotation
of the FP indicates that there is a greater evolution in the lu-
minosity of low-mass galaxies with redshift This interpreta-
tion was however questioned by van der Marelvan Dokkum
2007b Dynamical models provide little evidence of a dier-
ence in ML evolution between low- and high-mass galaxies
and the steepening of the FP may be aected by issues other
than ML evolution such as an increasing importance of in-
ternal galaxy rotation at lower luminosities not captured by
the simple aperture-corrected velocity dispersion used in Eq

well known change with redshift in the fraction of S0 galaxies
contributing to the early-type population Dressler et al 1997
Desai et al 2007 Just et al 2010 This so-called rotation of the
FP or change in the tilt of the FP was originally found in eld
samples but Jrgensen et al 2006 claimed that is also exists
for cluster galaxies at z089
Most studies of evolution with redshift in cluster early-type
galaxies have concentrated on single clusters It remains unclear
whether early-type galaxies in clusters at the same redshift share
the same FP or whether the FP coecients vary systematically
as a function of the global properties of the host cluster eg
richness optical and X-ray luminosity velocity dispersions con-
centration and subclustering DOnofrio et al 2008 demon-
strated that the universality of the FP has yet to be proven and
that to avoid causing any biases by comparing the FP relation of
clusters at dierent redshifts a larger number of clusters should
be studied
Furthermore
2007 Toft et al
the ZP evolution of
the galaxies At
  1011M spheroid-like galaxies at z15
the FP with red-
shift has been interpreted as an evolution in the ML ra-
this may not be entirely true if there is a
tio However
structural evolution in the size of
the most massive
value observations seem to show that
spective of their star-formation activity Perez-Gonzalez et al
2008 were much smaller a factor of 4 than their lo-
cal counterparts Daddi et al 2005 Trujillo et al 2006 2007

2008 Saracco Longhetti  Andreon 2009 Damjanov et al
2009 Ferreras et al 2009 van Dokkum et al 2010 argue that
the growth in size with decreasing redshift is due to the pro-
gressive build-up of the outer R  5 kpc stellar component of
galaxies while the inner core is already in place at redshift  2
We note also that these conclusions have been questioned by
Mancini et al 2010 who nd evidence for galaxies as large
as local ones at redshifts higher than 14 Complementing our
discussion above about the evolution of the zero point of the
FP if galaxy size were to vary with redshift we should expect
an accompanying partial revision of the importance of the eect
when taking into account the progenitor bias Valentinuzzi et al
2010a Finally if a variation in galaxy size with redshift were
to occur we should expect an accompanying increase in the
central velocity dispersion with redshift Cenarro  Trujillo
2009 van Dokkum Kriek  Franx 2009 Both the evolution in
size and velocity dispersion are predicted by theoretical models
that take into account internal feedback pung mechanisms

and therefore needs to be taken into account when deriving con-
straints on the formation epoch of early-type galaxies
In this paper we present the evolution of the FP in a sam-
ple of 154 spectral early-type galaxies in 28 clusters or groups
and 62 in the eld using spectra and images from the ESO
Distant Cluster Survey of galaxies White et al 2005 EDisCS
The clusters have redshifts between 04 and 09 and velocity
dispersions between 166 and 1080 kms Halliday et al 2004
Clowe et al 2006 Milvang-Jensen et al 2008 Our clusters
have generally lower velocity dispersions than those typi-
cally studied at similar redshifts and represent an intermediate-
redshift sample for which a majority of the clusters may be
progenitors of typical low-redshift clusters see Poggianti et al

The paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents the data
set In particular Sect 21 describes the measurements of the
galaxy velocity dispersions Section 22 describes the measure-
ment of the structural parameters their errors and the photo-
metric calibration Section 23 characterizes the statistical prop-
erties of the sample Section 3 presents the FP of EDisCS galax-
ies We start in Sect 31 with the FP for 25 clusters and dis-
cuss the evolution of the FP zero point as a function of red-
shift and cluster velocity dispersion Section 32 considers the
dierences between the FP of galaxies in clusters and the eld
and the dependence on galaxy mass Section 33 discusses the
related problem of the rotation of the FP In Sect 4 we con-
sider the size evolution of galaxies and how this aects the stel-
lar population time-dependence implied by the evolution of the
FP In Sect 5 we draw our conclusions Appendix A explains
in detail how we compute circularized half-luminosity radii
Throughout the paper we assume that M  03   07
and H0  70kmsMpc
2 Data analysis
The sample of galaxies analyzed in this paper consists of
spectroscopic early-type objects We considered the ux-
calibrated spectra reduced in Halliday et al
2004 and
Milvang-Jensen et al 2008 of galaxies with early spectral type
1 or 2 This indicates the total absence type 1 or the presence
of only weak with equivalent width smaller than 5  OII lines
Sanchez-Blazquez et al 2009 We derive galaxy velocity dis-
persions from these spectra Sect 21 We match this dataset
with HST and VLT photometry Sect 22 The HST images
Desai et al 2007 provide visual classication and structural
parameters for 70 of our galaxies For the remaining 30 we
use VLT photometry where no visual classication is available
Simard et al 2009 Approximately 70 of the galaxies with
HST photometry have early-type morphology Sect 23
21 Velocitydispersions
Velocity dispersions were measured in all galaxy spectra us-
ing the IDL routine pPXF Cappellari  Emsellem 2004 This
routine is based on a maximum penalized likelihood technique
that employs an optimal template and also performs well when
applied to spectra of low signal-to-noise ratio Cappellari et al
2009 The algorithm works in pixel space estimating the best t
to a galaxy spectrum by combining stellar templates that are con-
volved with the appropriate mean galaxy velocity and velocity
dispersion The results depend critically on how well the spectra
are matched by the template To compile an optimal template we
use 35 synthetic spectra from the library of single stellar popula-
tion models of Vazdekis et at 2010 which uses the new stellar
library MILES Sanchez-Blazquez et al 2006 These spectra
have been degraded to the wavelength-dependent resolution of
the EDisCS spectra determined from the widths of the lines in
the arc lamp spectra slit by slit and matching well the widths of
the sky lines on the science spectra
The library contains spectra spanning an age range from 013
to 17 Gyr and metallicities from ZH  068 to ZH  02
Operating in pixel space the code allows the masking of re-
gions of the galaxy spectra during the measurements We use
this to mask regions aected by skyline residuals Although the
code allows the measurement of the higher Gauss-Hermite order
moments Bender et al 1994 we only t the velocity and 
which stabilises the ts in our spectra of low signal-to-noise ra-
tio Errors were calculated by means of Monte Carlo simulations
in which each point was perturbed with the typical observed er-
ror following a Gaussian distribution Because the template mis-
match aects the measurement of the velocity and  determined
with pPXF a new optical template was used in each simulation
The errors were assumed to be the standard deviation in mea-
surements inferred from 20 simulations Owing to limitations
caused by the instrumental resolution only velocity dispersions
larger than 100 kms are reliable and unbiased Therefore galax-
ies with smaller  as well as velocity dispersions with uncer-
tainties larger than 20 the approximate intrinsic scatter of the
local FP see Introduction will not be considered further
We note that the velocity dispersions measured here are 
10 lower than those given in Sanchez-Blazquez et al 2009
The dierence is caused by the fact that the instrumental resolu-
tion in that paper was assumed to be constant with wavelength
at the value of 6  In reality this is just the best resolution pos-
sible with our setup that extends up to 8  The change is im-
portant here but does not aect any of the results presented in
Sanchez-Blazquez et al 2009
We measured velocity dispersions for 192 cluster and 78
eld galaxies Figure 1 shows the histograms of the statistical
and systematic errors The statistical errors are on average 10
and are a function of magnitude
The systematic errors are more dicult to estimate as they
depend on the template mismatch continuum variations and l-
tering schemes They have been extensively studied in the past
Cappellari  Emsellem 2004 and can be as large as 5-10 To
check the size of systematic errors we derived the galaxy veloc-
ity dispersions using the FCQ method of Bender et al 1994
which is less prone to template mismatching systematics and
operates in Fourier space We focused on the G band region at
z  05 the Mgb region at lower redshifts or the largest avail-
able continuous range redder than the 4000  break similar to
the approach of Ziegler et al 2005 The two methods agree
well with 68 of the values diering by less than the combined
1- error and 96 by less than 3- but smaller errors are de-
rived using the pixel tting approach partially because most of
each spectrum can be used This allow us to conclude that our
residual systematic errors are always smaller than the statistical
Finally an aperture correction following Jrgensen et al
log cor  log mes  004  logAp34kpc
where Ap represents the average aperture of our observations
115 arcsec scaled with the distances of the objects was ap-
plied to the measured velocity dispersions mes to place them
on the Coma cluster standard aperture system of 34 kpc Figure

Figure 3 presents the velocity dispersions as a function of
redshift and their distribution On average the galaxy velocity
dispersion is  200 kms with a mildly increasing trend with

ness value see Sect 23 in general changes the mean by no
more than its error
22 Photometry
The photometric part of the FP ie the half-luminosity radius Re
and average eective surface brightness hS Bei  25 log L
where L is the total luminosity was derived by tting either
HST ACS images Desai et al 2007 or I-band VLT images
White et al 2005 using the GIM2D software Simard et al

the methods and tests performed to assess the accuracy of the de-
rived structural parameters using exhaustive Monte Carlo sim-

Colors code the spectral type black 1 red2 The dotted lines
show the histogram for the entire sample irrespective of spectral
ulations To summarize a two-component two-dimensional t
was performed adopting an R14 bulge plus an exponential disk
convolved to the PSF of the images From the parameters of
the t we measured the circularized Re and eective surface
brightness from curves of growth constructed from the best t
models using the procedure described in Appendix A
Historically eective radii were derived from ts to curves
of growths constructed from photoelectric photometry using cir-
cular apertures of increazing sizes Burstein et al 1987 Our
procedure reproduces this approach and is identical to that fol-
lowed by Gebhardt et al 2003 to study the evolution of the
FP of eld galaxies with redshift We prefer it to less sophis-
ticated approaches such as the straight R14 t often used in
the literature as it provides far superior ts to the images As
Gebhardt et al 2003 do we note that in the past a variety of
methods have been adopted to measure the structural parameters
that enter in the FP curve of growth isophotal photometry or 2-
dimensional tting pure R14 Sersic or bulgedisk BD func-
tions The derived eective radii and surface brightness how-
ever when combined in Eq 1 of the FP deliver the same ZP
to a high degree of accuracy Saglia et al 1993 This has been
proven for a large set of local clusters including the Coma clus-
ter Saglia et al 1997b de Jong et al 2004 and remains valid
for the present data set see below This justies the compar-
isons with FP samples from the literature presented below
We later use eective radii to probe the size evolution of
galaxies Without doubt the scale length along the major axis
of a pure disk galaxy is the correct measurement of its size
and our circularized Re progressively underestimates the eec-
tive semi-major axis length as the inclination increases see Fig
RP Saglia et al The fundamental plane of EDisCS galaxies
4 However for a pure bulge the inverse is true and our Re then
averages out projection eects producing the equivalent circu-
larized size of each spheroid
On the other hand the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of
the images considered here is too low to allow us to perform an
accurate and unbiased determination of the sizes of the bulge and
the disk components separately for our galaxies Since the per-
centage of disk-dominated highly inclined objects in the galaxy
sample considered here is low as it is in the low redshift compar-
ison we conclude that our choice is reasonable In particular the
mean axial ratios of our sample and the low redshift comparison
are identical as discussed in Valentinuzzi et al 2010b
We now consider the quantitative question of the extent
to which our procedure for computing structural parameters is
equivalent to other approaches discussed in the literature
In analogy with procedures followed for local galaxies
Saglia et al 1997a where systematic errors are gauged by
comparing dierent photometric ts we assess the robustness
of the structural parameters to the chosen R14 bulge plus expo-
nential disk surface brightness model by considering a second
two-dimensional tting approach to the HST images We t a
single-component Sersic prole with 05  nS er  45 to the
HST ACS imaging in the F814W band available for 10 of the
EDisCS clusters Again the circularized half-luminosity radius
ReS er is computed from curves of growth constructed from the
best t model as described in Appendix A
Figure 4 summarizes the results of our BD and Sersic ts
The galaxies of our HST sample have on average a atten-
ing 1  beae of 037 033 without spirals with some disk-
dominated nearly edge-on spiral galaxies reaching 1  beae 
08 As a consequence our circularized eective radii are on av-
erage 39 33  without spirals smaller than the eective semi-
major lengths ae On average our objects are bulge-dominated

Figures 5 6 and 7 top and middle panels assess the robust-
ness of the derived structural parameters derived for the galaxies

literature as a proxy for Re sometimes xing the Sersic index

Sersic radii are on average very similar to our adopted Re as well
as the resulting eective surface brightness When combined
into the quantity orthogonal to the FP log Re  027hS Bei they
show minimal systematic dierences and scatter As discussed
in Appendix A only at high attening ie for almost edge-on
disk-dominated galaxies do the harmonic quantities show the
expected stronger deviations

1997b de Jong et al 2004
For the remaining clusters with only ground-based im-
ages we derive the structural parameters as described above
Simard et al 2009 ie by tting an R14 bulge plus an ex-
ponential disk 2D model to the I-band VLT deep images that
were obtained in excellent seeing conditions Circularized half-
luminosity radii are derived from curves of growth constructed
from the best ts as described in Appendix A In general simu-
lations show that the structural parameters derived from the ts
to VLT images are of reasonably good precision when nearly-
isolated galaxies ie those for which the segmentation area has
little contamination by nearby objects are considered Statistical
errors smaller than 027 mag in total magnitudes and smaller
than 036 dex in log Re are derived in addition to systematic er-
rors smaller than 015 mag and 02 dex respectively if bright
objects Imag 225 are examined Simard et al 2009 The
galaxies in our sample are typically at least one magnitude
brighter than this limit

and there is a small median shift No trend with redshift is seen
These values agree with or are of higher precision than those
derived from simulations see above Very similar results are
obtained for eld objects Therefore the VLT dataset can be
merged with the HST-based one to study the evolution of the
FP Sect 3
The systematic and random errors increase dramatically if
objects with sizable companions VLT SExtractor ag 3 are
considered In these cases the VLT segmentation areas tted
by GIM2D are heavily contaminated by the companions As a
consequence ReVLT  and VLT total magnitudes are systemat-
ically larger and brighter respectively than those derived from
HST ts There are 38 cluster and 10 eld galaxies with early
spectral type and measured velocity dispersion that have only
VLT imaging and a SExtractor ag equal to 3 Given the already
sizeable systematics in Re detected for the isolated objects we
refrain from attempting an iterative t and just exclude the af-
fected galaxies from the FP analysis
In Sect 4 we use the half-luminosity radii discussed above
to constrain the size evolution of our galaxies The high-
precision  10 systematic HST half-luminosity radii are cer-
tainly good enough and our results are based on this dataset only
A number of caveats have to be kept in mind when consider-
ing the VLT radii According to the Monte Carlo simulations
discussed by Simard et al 2009 Fig1 the VLT radii of the

largest galaxies of the sample larger than 18 arcsec might un-
derestimate the true radii by up to 40 But only 25 of our
sample has Re  18 Sizes below 01 arcsec are probably un-
reliable because of a lack of resolution but only 3 of cluster
galaxies and 5 of eld galaxies fall into this category Finally
if galaxies have strong color gradients our half-luminosity radii
derived from I band images ie approximately rest-frame V
band at redshift 05 and rest-frame B band at redshift 08 might
be aected dierentially with redshift However we do not de-
tect any signicant trend with redshift in the sizes derived from
our VLT B and V band images relative to the ones used here
from the I band images Despite all these systematic dierences
between HST and VLT Re radii on average 20 Sect 4 shows
that the size evolution derived from VLT Re radii is very similar
As a last step eective surface brightnesses were calibrated
as follows Corrections to rest-frame Johnson B band were ap-
plied based on the spectroscopic redshift z and an interpolation
of the best-t spectral energy distribution according to our pho-
tometric redshift procedure Rudnick et al 2009 Pello et al
2009 Moreover the Tolman correction 1  z4 was taken into
account Finally to be able to compare our results with those
of Wuyts et al 2004 and related papers we transformed eec-
tive surface brightness to surface brightness at Re using the con-

Weighting each galaxy with the inverse of its selection value to
correct for incompleteness see Sect 23 pushes the sample av-

respectively As for the velocity dispersions the eect is how-
ever on the order of the error in the averages We note that the
situation changes when we consider the size evolution of mass-
selected samples see Sect 4 We study cluster galaxies with
dynamical masses higher than 15  1010M

Figure 11 describes the nal sample We measured velocity dis-
persions for 113 cluster and 41 eld spectral early-type galaxies
with HST photometry and 41 cluster and 27 eld galaxies with
only VLT good photometry A large fraction of galaxies with
HST photometry also have early-type morphology 67 of the
objects in clusters and 78 in the eld have been classied as
either Es or S0 Moreover 77 of galaxies in clusters and 68
in the eld do not exhibit OII emission being of spectral type
Figure 11 Statistics of the sample of galaxies with measured
velocity dispersions and photometric parameters
To quantify the selection function of our sample we assign
a selection probability PS to each galaxy This is computed in
two steps First the -completeness probability P of the ve-
locity dispersion measurements is determined This is shown in
Fig 12 For each given spectral type we compute the ratio of the
number of galaxies with a measured velocity dispersion and re-
liable photometric structural photometry see above to the num-
ber of galaxies with a spectrum in a given magnitude bin In a
way similar to Milvang-Jensen et al 2008 we use the I band
magnitude in a 1 arcsec radius aperture I1 We compute these
curves separately for cluster and eld galaxies and for galax-
ies with redshifts either lower than or equal to or higher than
06 Finally we assign the probability PI1 z S T FC to each
galaxy by linearly interpolating the appropriate curve for its red-
shift z spectral type S T  and eld or cluster environment FC
as a function of magnitude The -completeness is high at bright
magnitudes and declines toward fainter objects In this regime
the  completeness is also slightly higher for higher redshift
galaxies where the exposure times are longer The dierences
between cluster and eld galaxies are not as pronounced
As a second step following Milvang-Jensen et al 2008 we
consider the total number of spectroscopically targeted galax-
drawn from a photometric magnitude-limited sample
far deeper than that considered here see Milvang-Jensen et al
2008 in a given magnitude bin separately for each of the 19
elds we observed In the given eld we then consider the
number of galaxies for which we were able to derive a se-
cure redshift NR with a success rate of essentially 100 see

Figure 13 shows the resulting probabilities as a function of

selection probability is almost at as a function of mass for

 This is above the stellar mass completeness
limit of our parent stellar catalogue In this mass range the selec-
tion probability has no dependence on the galaxy colors We be-
come progressively more incomplete at lower masses where we
sample just 10 of the population The eect is less pronounced
at higher redshifts In the eld the average completeness is lower

Figure 14 shows the FP of the 14 EDisCS clusters with HST pho-
tometry while Fig 15 provides the FP of the additional 12 clus-
ters with VLT-only photometry In each cluster good FP param-
eters are available for only a small number of galaxies  9 the
exceptions being cl12325-1144 cl10544-1146 cl10547-1245
and cl12168-1201 Therefore at this stage we do not attempt to

the velocity dispersion and surface brightness slopes xed to the
local values 0  12 0  08325  033 Wuyts et al
2004 In Sect 33 we argue that this is a good approximation up

we compute the zero point as

 log Rekpcw
where the sum comprises all N galaxies in a cluster with mea-
sured velocity dispersion early spectroscopic type 1 or 2 and
for clusters with only VLT photometry SExtractor ag 0 or 2
irrespective of morphology At this stage we weight each point
with w  112d2 where d is the error on  and do not
apply selection weighting to be consistent with the procedures
adopted in the literature and minimize scatter We note that this
could generate systematic dierences given that the considered
surveys have dierent selection functions We explore the inu-
ence of our selection function on the results below The error in
the zero point is ZP  rmsZP N
Following Wuyts et al 2004 we use the Coma cluster as a
reference point for the whole sample with ZP  065 All past
studies measuring the peculiar motions of the local universe of
early-type galaxies Lynden-Bell et al 1988 Colless et al 2001
Hudson et al 2004 and references therein agree with the con-
clusion that Coma the richest and in the FP context the most
well-studied local cluster is at rest with respect to the cosmic mi-
crowave background and therefore the best suited as a reference
We convert the variation in the FP zero point into a variation in
the mean mass-to-light ratio of galaxies in the B band with re-
spect to Coma using the relation  log MLB  ZP 065083
where 0830  25 see Eqs 7 and 8 We note that at this
stage we still implicitly assume as in the past that no evolu-
tion in size or velocity dispersion is taking place Figure 16 left

CL1354 and CL1138 are not considered with an rms of 006 or
an error in the mean of 002 see also Sect 32
We add to the EDisCS sample 15 clusters from the lit-
erature van Dokkum  van der Marel 2007 plus A370 from
Bender et al 1998 They span the redshift range z  0109 
128 and sample the high cluster velocity dispersion clus 
800kms regime only Moreover as a common zero-redshift
comparison we add the Coma cluster A linear weighted t to
the whole sample gives  log MLB  054001z Applying
selection weighting reduces the slope to 047 A t restricted
to the literature sample alone gives 049  002 Wuyts et al
2004 derive 047 whereas van Dokkum  van der Marel
2007 nd 0555  0042 In view of the size evolution discus-
sion of Sect 4 where dependencies of log1  z are considered
we also t the slope  of the form  log MLB   log1 z The
results are summarized in Table 5
The residuals of the EDisCS cluster sample have an rms
of 008 dex The literature sample which does not probe clus-
ters with small velocity dispersions see below has an rms of
006 dex the clusters at low redshift z  02 having system-
atically positive residuals The combined sample has an rms
scatter of 007 Taking into account the measurement errors
this implies an intrinsic scatter of 006 dex or 15 in ML
The best-t line closely matches the prediction of simple stellar
population models Maraston 2005 with high formation red-
shift 2  z f  25 and solar metallicities Here and below
we make use of Maraston 2005 models to translate mass-to-
light or luminosity variations into formation ages or redshifts
Similar conclusions would be obtained using other models eg
Bruzual  Charlot 2003 see for example Jae et al 2010
However we bear in mind that systematic errors still aect the
SPP approach see Maraston et al 2009 Conroy  Gunn 2010
for the diculties in reproducing the colors of real galaxies
Trimming the sample to high-precision data only for exam-
ple considering only velocity dispersions determined to a preci-
sion higher than 10 does not change the overall picture We
discuss the eects of cutting the sample according to mass spec-
troscopic type or morphology in Sect 32 where we consider
the sample on a galaxy by galaxy basis since any selection dras-
tically reduces the number of clusters with at least 4 galaxies
Figure 16 right panel shows the residuals  log MLB 
054z as a function of the cluster velocity dispersion No con-
vincing correlation is seen the Pearson coecient is 021 the
Spearman coecient 039 with a probability of 25 that a
correlation exists conrming that cluster massive early-type
galaxies follow passive evolution up to high redshifts not only
in massive clusters as has been established see discussion
in the Introduction but also in lower mass structures down
to the group size There is a hint that the scatter could in-
crease in the low velocity dispersion clusters while the com-
bined EDisCSLiterature sample of high velocity dispersion
clusters clus  800 kms exhibit an rms of the residuals
 log MLB  054z of 006 dex the lower clus EDisCS clus-
ters exhibit an rms of 008 dex We note that the scatter in ML
measured in each cluster is larger up to 03 dex and intrinsic
ie not caused by measurement errors

We now consider the sample on a galaxy by galaxy basis As
in Eq 5 in Fig 17 we show the evolution with redshift of
 log MLB  12 log   083 log Ie  log Re  065083 for
the EDisCS cluster left and eld right galaxies For the 74
galaxies with both HST and VLT photometry we derive a mean
dierence  log MLBVLT  HS T   002 with an rms of
006 or an error in the mean of 002 similar to that quoted for
clusters in Sect 31 In general there is scatter in the galaxy
data that falls even below the SPP model line for a formation
redshift z f  12 with twice-solar metallicity or to positive val-
ues that are impossible to explain with simple stellar population
models Many of these deviant points are galaxies with late-type
morphology Their measured velocity dispersion might not be
capturing their dynamical state dominated by rotation
First we turn our attention to galaxies belonging to clusters
Averaging the points in redshift bins 01 wide shows that cluster
galaxies closely follow the mean linear t derived for clusters
as a whole This corresponds to a solar metallicity SPP model
with formation redshift z f  2 or formation lookback time of
10 Gyr see Sect 44 for a detailed discussion The average
values do not change within the errors if a cut either in mass

 or morphology T  0 is applied Table

derived by cutting the sample in a progressively more selec-
tive way In general PS selection weighting produces shallower
slopes Shallower slopes are also obtained when only massive
galaxies or spectral types ST1 are considered The steepest
slope   056 is obtained by considering only galaxies
with HST early-type morphologies no restrictions on spectral
type or mass and no selection weighting The shallowest slope
  032 is obtained considering only galaxies more massive

with ellipticity less than 1  beae  06 changes the slopes only
minimally from   053 for 113 objects to   056 for
88 objects
In contrast galaxies in the eld have values of  log MLB
more negative than the corresponding cluster bins starting from
z  045 For our sample a solar metallicity SSP model with for-
mation redshift z f  12 is an accurate representation of the data
This corresponds to a formation age of 84 Gyr or a mean age dif-
ference of 16 Gyr between cluster and eld galaxies see Sect
44 for a detailed discussion The slopes  listed in Table 5 for
eld galaxies are always steeper than the ones derived for cluster
galaxies The shallowest   067 is obtained when consid-
ering only galaxies more massive than 1011M
with ST2 Here
we approach the result of van Dokkum  van der Marel 2007
who detect only a very small age dierence between cluster and
eld galaxies of these masses and morphologies Still our shal-
lowest slope for eld galaxies is steeper than the steepest slope
for cluster galaxies
We compute dynamical masses as in Eq 4 As discussed in
the Introduction the validity of this equation can be questioned
in many respects The value of the appropriate structural con-
stant need not to be the same for every galaxy If ordered mo-
tions dominate the dynamics of a galaxy as must be the case
for disk galaxies the use of velocity dispersion is inappropri-
ate Moreover we also assume that the structure proportional-

ity constant does not vary with redshift which might not be
true Nevertheless on average Eq 4 delivers values that compare
reasonably with stellar masses We compute the total stellar
masses from ground-based rest-frame absolute photometry de-
rived from SED tting Rudnick et al 2009 adopting the cal-
ibrations of Bell  de Jong 2001 with a diet Salpeter IMF
with constant fractions of stars of mass less than 06M
B-V colors and renormalized using the corrections for an el-
liptical galaxy given in de Jong  Bell 2007 The method to
calculate the rest-frame luminosities and colors is described in
Rudnick et al 2003 and the rest-frame lters have been taken
from Bessel
1990 Although the photometric redshifts and
rest-frame SEDs have been computed from the matched aperture
photometry of White et al 2005 the rest-frame luminosities
have been adjusted to total values as described in Rudnick et al
2009
In general the dynamical masses are somewhat lower than
the stellar ones MdynM
  091 for cluster galaxies 075 for
eld galaxies with an intrinsic scatter of a factor of two on
the order of the typical combined precision achieved for dynam-
ical and stellar masses If we consider only galaxies with HST
morphology T  0 the ratio MdynM
drops to 074 for clus-
ter and 056 for eld galaxies Moreover a possible decreasing
trend with redshift of the ratio MdynM
is seen at the 2  
level which is not unexpected given the size and velocity disper-
sion evolution discussed in Sect 42 To conclude the tendency
to have MdynM
  1 may indicate that the structural constant
used in Eq 4 is too low However we note that the structural
constant is the one that dynamical studies at low redshifts pre-
fer Cappellari et al 2006 Thomas et al 2010 Alternatively
our adopted IMF contains too high a fraction of low mass stars
Baldry et al 2008 Finally we refer to Thomas et al 2010 for
a discussion of the role of dark matter in the estimation of Mdyn
In the following we consider relations as a function of both
dynamical and stellar masses to assess the robustness of each
result

selection eects to play a role as discussed in van der Wel et al
2005 We do not detect any additional dependence on cluster
velocity dispersion

As discussed by di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 a mass depen-
dence of the  log ML residuals implies a rotation of the FP as a
function of redshift Here we investigate the eect by assuming
that the zero point variation  log MLB  166  log1  z
for cluster and  log MLB  227  log1  z for eld galax-
ies is caused entirely by pure luminosity evolution Accordingly
we correct the surface brightnesses of cluster galaxies by apply-
ing the oset  log Ie  166  log1  z083 and of eld
galaxies by applying  log Ie  227  log1  z083 This
agrees with the observed evolution of the average eective sur-
face brightness see dotted line in Fig 10 except for the highest
redshift bins We then t the parameters  and  of Eq 1 us-
ing the maximum likelihood algorithm of Saglia et al 2001
which uses multi-gaussian functions to describe the distribution
of data points taking into account the full error covariance ma-
trix and selection eects for a Bayesian approach to the mod-
eling of systematic eects see Treu et al 2001 To ensure uni-
formity with the procedures adopted in the literature the results
are derived with and without taking into account selection ef-
fects but the dierences between the two approaches are al-
ways smaller than the large statistical errors We t three redshift
ranges for cluster galaxies and two for eld galaxies The results
are shown in Table 6 The errors are computed as the 68 per-
centiles of the results of Monte Carlo simulations of each tted
sample as in Saglia et al 2001 The low redshift bins up to
z07 infer  coecients that are compatible with local values
  12 and  coecients   02303 slightly smaller than
the local value   033 In contrast the highest redshift bins
produce shallower log  slopes Given the relatively low num-
ber of galaxies per bin especially in the low velocity dispersion
regime the statistical signicance is just  1 but the trend

are considered
conrms the claims of the literature see Sect 1 In particular
both values of  and  decrease at high redshift as observed by
di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 a consequence of the atten-
ing with redshift of the power-law relation between luminosity
and mass see Sect 4
by a variation in the luminosity As discussed in the Introduction
there is growing evidence that early-type galaxies evolve not
only in terms of luminosity but also in size and velocity dis-
persion Here we examine the consequences of these ndings

41 Settingthestage
Up to this point we have analyzed and interpreted the ZP varia-
tions of the FP based on the assumption that it is caused mainly
In general if sizes were shrinking with increasing redshift
we would expect the surface brightness to increase Therefore
if the velocity dispersions do not increase a lot the net eect
will be to reduce the net amount of brightening with redshift
caused by stellar population evolution In detail setting ZP

We note that the ZP variations have been determined by assum-
ing constant 0 and 0 coecients which is probably not true at
the high redshift end of our sample see Sect 33
If the variations are computed at constant dynamical mass
then  log    log Re2 as in the pungscenario of
Fan et al 2008 see below Eq 7 becomes
 log Lpu 
100  2  0
 log Re 
In this case the contribution of the size evolution to the lumi-
nosity evolution at constant mass derived from the FP is zero
100  2  0
where z is the correction for progenitor bias estimated by
van Dokkum  Franx 2001 to be   009 Their result can
be applied to our work directly since our redshift dependence of
the FP ZP matches closely that considered there
As discussed in the Introduction the size and  evolution
of galaxies is usually interpreted as a result of the merging his-
tory of galaxies The merger models of Hopkins et al 2009
predict me  05 and me  01 for galaxies with constant
stellar mass M

means that  log Re  02 log  As an alternative explana-
tion Fan et al 2008 proposed the pung scenario where
galaxies grow in size conserving their mass as a result of quasar
activity In this case one has pu  R12
 We note however that
this mechanism should already have come to an end at redshift
08 Moreover the strong velocity dispersion evolution predicted

RP Saglia et al The fundamental plane of EDisCS galaxies
by the pung scenario at redshifts higher than 1 was ruled out
by Cenarro  Trujillo 2009

Following van der Wel et al
2008 we investigated the size
evolution of EDisCS galaxies by considering the Mass  Re re-
lation for objects with masses higher that 3  1010M
 In Fig
19 we divided our sample into 8 redshift bins centered on red-
shifts from 025 to 095 of bin size z  01 and t the re-
lation Re  RcMMcb We considered both dynamical Mdyn
left and stellar M
 right masses and we weighted each galaxy
with 1PS  Within the errors b does not vary much and is com-
patible with the values b  056 found locally In Fig 19 we
therefore keep its value xed and determine Rc at the mass
Mc  2  1011M
 We tted the function Rcz  Rc0  1  z
and summarize the values of the parameters resulting from the
ts in Table 7 As becomes clear below this does not necessarily
describe the evolution in size of a galaxy of xed mass but rather
at any given redshift the mean value of the size of the evolving
population of galaxies with this given mass
Given the larger uncertainties in the Re values derived from
VLT photometry we rst tted the HST dataset alone entries 1
and 2 of Table 7 Within the errors both Rc0 and the slope are
very similar to the values reported by van der Wel et al 2008
Rc006  48 kpc   098  011 for both dynamical and
stellar mass ts Our results do not change within the errors if
we separately t galaxies belonging to clusters or to the eld If
we add the galaxies with VLT photometry only entries 3 and 4
of Table 7 we derive larger Rc and steeper slopes
Figure 20 shows Rc as a function of redshift when we apply
a correction for progenitor bias as in Valentinuzzi et al 2010a
The EDisCS galaxies considered here are a sample of spectro-
scopically selected passive objects In contrast a morphologi-
cally selected local sample of early-type galaxies contains ob-
jects with relatively young ages that when evolved to EDisCS
redshifts would not be recognized as being spectroscopically
passive Valentinuzzi et al 2010a analyze the WINGS sam-
ple of local galaxies and determine their ages by means of a
spectral analysis They select objects that were already passive
ie have an age  15 Gyr at the cosmic time of the red-
shifts z  0 025 05 075 and 1 and compute the median half-
luminosity radii of massive galaxies The resulting Re vary as
Re  41  01  08  02z kpc when selecting galax-
ies with dynamical masses 1011  MdynM
  3  1011 and
as 43  01  09  02z when selecting galaxies with stel-
  3  1011 Therefore we multi-
lar masses 1011  M
ply the Rcz derived at Mdyn  1011M
4108z  and those
4309z  With these corrections the resid-
ual evolution is small and even compatible with no evolution
up to redshift z  07 with dynamical masses and 05 with
stellar masses Similar results are derived if we also consider
the galaxies with VLT photometry with the caveats discussed
above Our correction for progenitor bias is of course somewhat
model-dependent since objects might cross the boundaries be-
tween populations For example there might be z  06 pas-
sive galaxies that produce z  0 descendants with some younger
stars after accreting gas or gas-rich objects

In Figs 21 and 22 we show the analogous plots and ts
for the velocity dispersion Table 7 lists the relative results We
nd that  scales as  M023
dyn  The trend weakens at low masses
and high redshifts especially when stellar masses are consid-
ered The t at constant dynamical mass is just a consistency
check which should infer a slope of the redshift dependence of
opposite sign to and half the value of the one measured for Rc
  068 and this is the case In contrast a weaker redshift
evolution   039 is derived if stellar masses are considered
in agreement with Cenarro  Trujillo 2009 This is expected
since as discussed above c at xed M
should certainly be
smaller than c at xed Mdyn given that MdynM

Table 9 lists the changes in the slope  
Following the procedure of Valentinuzzi et al 2010a de-
scribed above we construct the local sample of WINGS galaxies
with velocity dispersions trimmed to have only massive spectro-
scopically passive galaxies at the redshifts z  0 025 05 075
and 1 and compute the median  of massive galaxies The re-
sulting  vary as   197  2  6  4z kms when selecting
galaxies with dynamical masses 1011  MdynM
  3  1011
and is constant at 210  15 kms when selecting galaxies with
  3  1011 Therefore we cor-
stellar masses 1011  M
rect the measured c for the progenitor bias by multiplying the
values derived at Mdyn  1011M
1976z  and no correction is
applied at constant stellar mass The residual redshift evolution
after the correction and tting the point at zero redshift is small
of the luminosity evolution  log L   log1  z see Eq 7
derived from the measured variation in the FP ZP caused by
the size and velocity dispersion evolution coding the dierent
cases listed in Table 7 For example case 19 Mdyn uses the
value of  derived for the redshift evolution of Rc constructed
using the Re  Mdyn relation with HST data without both selec-
tion weighting and progenitor bias correction case 1 of Table
7 and the value of  derived from the redshift evolution of 
inferred in turn from the   Mdyn relation without both selec-
tion weighting and progenitor bias correction case 9 of Table 7
getting   039 This implies that the luminosity evolution
inferred from the ZP evolution of the EDisCS clusters without
selection weighting L  1  z161 see Table 5 would reduce
to L  1  z122
To summarize none of the values of  listed in Table 9 dif-
fer statistically from zero However without taking into account
the progenitor bias rows two to ve of Table 9 the values of
 and  are much larger than inferred by the merger scenario of
Hopkins et al 2009 and when used in Eq 10 reduce the pre-
dicted luminosity evolution with redshift drastically In contrast
by taking into account the progenitor bias rows six to nine of
Table 9 the correction  to the redshift slope of the luminos-
ity evolution inferred from the FP is far smaller

To close the loop in Fig 23 we directly considered the rela-
tion between total luminosity LB and dynamical mass as a func-
tion of redshift In general the power law L  LCMMC075

ing we derived LC as a function of redshift as shown in Fig 24

corrections  for size and velocity dispersion evolution must
be small as one nds when the progenitor bias is taken into ac-

44 Ages
As a nal step we translated the observed evolution in the FP
zero points into an age estimate We examined three cases that

and   0 2   0 and   0 where the small size and ve-
locity dispersion correction compensates the progenitor bias of
van Dokkum  Franx 2001 c  log L  z where the size
and velocity dispersion correction is zero and we take into ac-
count the progenitor bias of van Dokkum  Franx 2001 We
convert the mean  log MLB for cluster and eld galaxies mea-
sured in the mass bins of Fig 18 into an age by consider-
ing the various options for size evolution discussed above We
use the solar-metallicity motivated by the analysis of the aver-
aged line indices discussed below Salpeter IMF SSP models
of Maraston 2005 at the appropriate mean redshift of the bin
RP Saglia et al The fundamental plane of EDisCS galaxies
Ages older than the age of the universe at that redshift are set to
the age of the universe Figure 25 shows the results Table 8 gives
the average values for Mdyn  1011M
and Mdyn  1011M
Cluster galaxies more massive than 1011M
are 6 to 8 Gyr
old with formation redshifts higher than 15 while galaxies of
lower masses are some 3-4 Gyr younger This parallels the nd-
ings of Sanchez-Blazquez et al 2009 where the analysis of
spectral indices of EDisCs cluster galaxies with velocity dis-
persion larger than 175 kms assigns them formation redshifts
 14 Galaxies with lower velocity dispersions have instead
younger ages compatible with continuous low levels of star
formation Alternatively the low-mass spectroscopic early-type
cluster sample is building up progressively with the acquisition
of new and young objects as discussed in De Lucia et al 2004
2007 and Rudnick et al 2009 The result also agrees with the
analysis of the scatter in the color-magnitude relation of EDisC
clusters of Jae et al 2010
Field galaxies are slightly younger than cluster galaxies at
the same redshift and mass Taking into account the size and ve-
locity dispersion evolution considered above in the case 612
pushes all formation ages upwards by 1 to 4 Gyr Taking into
account the progenitor bias of van Dokkum  Franx 2001 re-
duces the ages by 1 to 2 Gyr Table 8 lists mean ages for the
HST sample of galaxies with morphologies T  0 The dier-
ences between low and high mass galaxies are smaller
We next correlated the FP ages of Fig 25 with those de-
rived from the analysis of the spectral indices As performed in
Sanchez-Blazquez et al 2009 we averaged the spectra of the
galaxies appearing in each mass bin shown in Fig 18 measured
the Fe4383 HdA and CN2 indices and recovered the ages and
metallicities of SSP models that reproduce their values best The
derived metallicity averaged over the sample is solar which jus-
ties the choice above We also estimated luminosity-weighted
and mass-weighted ages directly by tting the spectra with a li-
brary of model spectra Within the large errors there is overall
agreement with the ages derived from the indices The optimal
match is achieved when considering the minimal evolution ages
As a nal check we derived the rest-frame U-B and B-V col-
ors corresponding to a SSP of solar metallicity and age derived
as above and compared them to the measured averaged colors
The agreement was fair but either the colors predicted using the
FP ages are too red or the spectral ages appear to be too high
The discrepancy is exacerbated when size evolution is taken into
account This could simply reect the known diculties for stel-
lar population synthesis models in reproducing the colors of real
galaxies Maraston et al 2009
5 Conclusions
We have examined the FP of EDisCS spectroscopic early-type
galaxies in both the cluster and the eld Combining structural
parameters from HST and VLT images and velocity dispersions
from VLT spectra we have compiled a catalogue of 154 cluster
and 68 eld objects in the redshift range 02-09 For the rst
time we have explored the FP of galaxy clusters of medium-
to-low velocity dispersion in the redshift range 04-09 At face-
value on average the evolution of the zero point follows the
predictions of simple stellar population models with high  2
formation redshift for all clusters independent of their veloc-
ity dispersion with a slight increase from 15 to 18 in the
scatter in mass-to-light ratios for clusters with low clus  600
kms velocity dispersions The FP zero point of eld galaxies
follows similar tracks up to redshift  05 but implies brighter
luminosities or lower formation redshifts at higher redshifts
We have determined dynamical and stellar masses for our
is  09 with a scatter of a factor 2
galaxies The ratio MdynM
and a tendency to decrease with redshift We investigated the FP
residuals as a function of galaxy mass At high redshifts z  07
for cluster galaxies slightly below for eld galaxies galaxies
with mass lower than  1011M
have lower mass-to-light ra-
tios than a passive evolution of the ZP predicts This implies that
there is a rotation in the FP we conrm that for cluster galaxies
the velocity dispersion coecient  is compatible with the local
value up to a redshift z  07 and decreases to   07  04
at higher redshifts but this detection is of low statistical signi-
We have investigated the size and velocity dispersion evo-
lution of our sample At a given mass galaxy sizes decrease
and velocity dispersions increase at increasing redshift We t-
ted the relations Re  1  z1003 and   1  z05901
and   1  z034014 at a constant dynamical or stellar mass
of 2  1011M
 respectively for both cluster and eld galaxies
However after taking into account the progenitor bias aect-
ing our sample large galaxies that joined the local early-type
class only recently will progressively disappear in higher red-
shift samples the eective size and velocity dispersion evo-
lution reduced substantially to Re  1  z0502 and  
1  z041008 for dynamical masses and Re  1  z06804 and
  1  z019010 for stellar masses
We computed the luminosity evolution predicted by the ZP
variation with redshift of the FP when the size and velocity dis-
persion evolution are taken into account The corrections com-
puted at constant dynamical masses with a progenitor bias cor-
rection almost cancel out at constant stellar mass they reduce
the slope of the 1  z dependence of luminosity by 06 units
case 511 of Table 7 Fitting directly the luminosity-mass rela-
tion we derived a luminosity evolution that agrees with the one
derived from the FP analysis and does not allow for large size
and velocity dispersion corrections such as those derived with-
out taking into account the progenitor bias where a reduction
of the slope of the 1  z dependence of luminosity by 08 is
derived at constant M
Using simple stellar population models we translated the
variations in the FP ZP into formation ages as a function of
redshift and galaxy mass Massive M  1011M
 cluster
galaxies are old with formation redshifts z f  15 In con-
trast lower mass galaxies are just 2 to 3 Gyr old This agrees
with the EDisCS results presented in De Lucia et al
2007 Poggianti et al 2006 Sanchez-Blazquez et al 2009
and Rudnick et al 2009 who argue from dierent points of
view that the lower luminosity lower mass population of early-
type galaxies comes in place only at later stages in clusters Field
galaxies at all masses are somewhat younger by  1 Gyr than
the cluster ones with similar masses and redshifts In general the
FP ages agree reasonably well with those derived from spectral
indices
case 19 of Table 7 
To conclude our analysis of the FP size and velocity dis-
persion evolution of EDisCS galaxies points towards a picture
where a large fraction of the population became passive only
fairly recently The high redshift passive galaxies are a biased
subset of all the present passive galaxies At any probed red-
shift from 0 to 1 passive galaxies are an inhomogeneous popu-
lation in terms of their formation paths and as redshift increases
a subset of the population leaves the sample with less massive
galaxies dropping out of the sample more rapidly with redshift
than the more massive ones and with a somewhat accelerated
pace in the eld Only when these eects are taken into account
may coherent estimates of the luminosity evolution of early-type

Appendix A Circularized half-luminosity radii
GIM2D delivers bulge ae and disk ah scale lengths along the
major axis bulge apparent attening baB and disk inclina-
tion angles i corresponding to an apparent attening baD 
1 cos i and bulge-to-total ratios BT  When tting Sersic pro-
les GIM2D delivers the n Sersic index the major axis aS er
and the attening baS er We compute the circularized half-
luminosity radius Re of the resulting galaxy model as follows
We determine the ux inside a circular aperture of radius R
the so-called curve of growth of a model of apparent at-
tening ba and surface density distribution constant on ellipses

the sample of EDisCS galaxies with HST photometry and veloc-
ity dispersions computed according to Eqs A2 and A4 com-
pared to the simple mean Rave  05ae  be top and harmonic
mean Rhar  ae  be bottom as a function of the ellipticity

for the bulge plus disk models and

for the Sersic ts numerically In general the resulting Re agree
within 1 with the half-luminosity radii derived by measuring
the curves of growth directly from ACS HST like images gen-
erated by GIM2D with the t parameters and no PSF convolu-
tion but the image-based method overestimates Re by up to 10
 when it is smaller than 4 pixels 02 arcsec
Figure A1 illustrates that a more accurate approximation of
the circularized radius ReS er of Sersic proles more accurate
than 2 is obtained by taking the simple mean Rave  aebe2
of the major and minor axis scale lengths ae and be instead of the
harmonic mean Rhar  ae  be This is surprising only at a rst
sight since Rhar goes to zero as the attening increases while
Rave does not Therefore Rave is bound to more closely approx-
imate the half-luminosity radius derived from circular curves
of growth at high ellipticities On the other hand the eective
surface brightness within the ellipse of semi-major and minor
axis ae and be is constant whatever the attening while this is
not true for the surface brightness within the circle of radius

stant we have log ReS erRhar  02hS Bei  hS Bhar
