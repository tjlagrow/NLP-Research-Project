ABSTRACT
The formation and evolution of the EA also named ka and ak
types by Dressler et al 1999 galaxies found in signicant numbers in the cores
of intermediate redshift clusters has been extensively discussed by many authors
In this paper we model the spectral dynamical and morphological evolution
of a prime candidate for producing this spectral signature a dusty starburst
associated with a major galaxy merger We show that as this system evolves
dynamically its spectral type changes from and ea type exhibiting strong
H absorption and modest OII emission  the identifying features of local
dusty starburst galaxies to a ka type and then nally to a passive k type
This result shows that galaxies with an ea spectral type can be precursors
to the ka systems and that dynamical evolution greatly controls the spectral
evolution in these merger cases Our simulations also show that a merger with
very high infrared luminosity LIR  1011 L is more likely to show an ea
spectrum which implies that spectral types can be correlated with infrared
uxes in dusty starburst galaxies Based on these results we discuss the origin
of the evolution of kaak galaxies in distant clusters and the role merging is
likely to have

Introduction
The origin of the so-called EA galaxies with no detectable emission and strong
Balmer absorption lines is generally considered to be one of the most longstanding and
remarkable problems of galaxy evolution in distant z  02 clusters Dressler  Gunn
1983 proposed that this peculiar spectroscopic property was due to the presence of a
substantial population of A-type stars having been formed as part of a recent starburst
which was abruptly truncated Since Couch  Sharples 1987 suggested a possible
evolutionary link between these EA galaxies and the general population of blue galaxies
found in distant clusters Butcher  Oemler 1978 several attempts have been made to
determine what physical processes are closely associated with the abrupt truncation of star
formation that is inferred from their spectral characteristics eg Abraham et al 1996
Barger et al 1996 Balogh et al 1997 Couch et al 1998 Poggianti et al 1999 Although
the formation of EA galaxies has been often discussed in terms of physical processes
specic to the cluster environment Zabludo et al 1996 found that a large fraction of
nearby EA galaxies lie in the eld rather than in clusters and therefore suggested that
cluster environmental eects such as interaction with the cluster gravitational potential or
intracluster medium are not responsible for EA formation
Recent detailed morphological and spectroscopic studies by the Hubble Space
T elescope HST  and large groundbased telescopes have shed new light on the origin of
EA galaxies For example a signicant fraction of the distant cluster galaxies with EA
spectra  renamed by Dressler et al 1999 as ak or ka types  are observed to
be disk systems which implies that abrupt or even gradual truncation of star formation
after the starburst has occurred without a dramatic transformation in their morphology
Couch et al 1998 Dressler et al 1999 Furthermore Poggianti et al 1999 argued on
the basis of the observed fractions and luminosity functions of the dierent spectral types
 4 
that the progenitors of akka galaxies were the ea class objects  those with modest
OII emission and strong Balmer line absorption EWH  4A the same two features
that characterize the spectra of nearby dusty starburst galaxies Liu  Kennicutt 1995
These observational results strongly suggest that it is very important for theoretical studies
to address the following three problems 1 What are the physical processes responsible for
the formation of EA galaxies 2 What are the evolutionary links between the dierent
spectral types in particular the ea eb ec ak ka and k class objects identied by
Dressler et al 1999 3 How is the observed morphological evolution eg the smaller
fraction of S0 populations in higher redshift clusters Dressler et al 1997 related to spectral
evolution of galaxies in clusters Clearly both the morphological and spectral properties of
distant cluster galaxies have to be investigated jointly in a fully self-consistent manner if
these questions are to be answered However previous theoretical studies have investigated
quite separately the morphological transformation processes using numerical methods
Byrd  Valtonen 1990 Moore et al 1994 and the possible spectral evolutionary links
using simple one-zone models Barbaro  Poggianti 1997 Poggianti et al 1999 Shioya 
Bekki 2000 Thus it is still highly uncertain when and how EA galaxies form and evolve
both spectrally and morphologically
The purpose of this Letter is to investigate the morphological photometric and
spectroscopic properties of galaxies in an explicitly self-consistent manner and thereby
provide some plausible and realistic answers to the above three problems We adopt
an observationally suggested scenario that some EA galaxies are formed by strong
interactions and merging eg Zabludo et al 1996 and demonstrate when and how a
dusty starburst triggered by a major galaxy merger develops an EA spectrum in the course
of its dynamical evolution Here we use our newly developed model Bekki  Shioya 2000
hereafter referred to as BS by which we can self-consistently investigate the time evolution
of spectral types eg ka ak ea etc infrared uxes eg LIR for 81000 m
 5 
and dynamical properties eg radial density prole in a galaxy with dusty starbursts
Based on our new spectrodynamical simulations BS we particularly demonstrate that a
merger exhibits a kaak spectrum following its strong starburst phase and furthermore
that the dynamical evolution of a galaxy can greatly control its spectral evolution
2 The model
Since our numerical methods and techniques for modeling chemodynamical and
photometric evolution of dusty starbursts associated with major galaxy mergers have
already described in detail by BS we give only a brief review here We construct models of
galaxy mergers between gas-rich disks with equal mass by using the model of Fall-Efstathiou
1980 The total mass and the size of a progenitor exponential disk are Md and Rd
respectively From now on all the mass and length are measured in units of Md and Rd
respectively unless otherwise specied Velocity and time are measured in units of v 
GMdRd12 and tdyn  R3
dGMd12 respectively where G is the gravitational constant
and assumed to be 10 in the present study If we adopt Md  60  1010 M and Rd
 175 kpc as a ducial value then v  121  102 kms and tdyn  141  108 yr
respectively The disk-to-dark halo mass ratio is set equal to 40 The total mass of gas is
30  1010 M The orbital conguration of the present major merger between the above
two disks is exactly the same as that in BS To calculate spectral energy distributions
SEDs of the merger and luminosities of gaseous emission lines eg OII and H
we use the spectral library GISSEL96 Bruzual  Charlot 1993 and the formula of
LHerg s1  476  1013NLys1 where NLy is ionizing photon production rate and
the table of relative luminosity to H luminosity in PEGASE Fioc  Rocca-Volmerange
1997 We investigated both a model without dust referred to as DF for dust free and a
model with dust DS or dusty starburst

3 Results
Figure 1 describes the time evolution of EWOII and EWH of the merger-induced
starburst over the period 06  T  28 Gyr for the DF and the DS models At the point
where the star formation rate rapidly increases T  13 Gyr EWOII is also seen to
rapidly increase 100  EWOII  370A in the DF model In contrast the DS model
does not show such a dramatic increase during the starburst phase owing to the very heavy
dust extinction The DS model shows EWOII does not exceed 40A and the dierence
in EWOII between the two models is rather large ranging from a factor of  3 at
T  11 Gyr to a factor of 35 at T  13 Gyr After the starburst T  13 Gyr EWOII
rapidly decreases with time for the two models
Owing to the heavy dust extinction EWH does not show a large negative value
during the starburst and is reasonably well within the observed values  10 A Liu 
Kennicutt 1995 of dusty starburst galaxies for the DS model The most important point
in EWH evolution is that only the DS model shows an absorption line signature ie
positive values during the starburst and poststarburst epochs Dust eects are critically
important for the EWH evolution in dusty galaxies
Figure 2 demonstrates that as a natural result of the above EWOII and EWH
evolution the spectral type of the DS model evolves from eb T  06 Gyr to ea 13
to ka 17 and nally to k 28 This result conrms that a dusty starburst associated
with a major merger can become a ka galaxy  04 Gyr after its burst of star formation
 7 
One of the remarkable dierences in the spectral evolution on the EWOII-EWH plane
between the two models is that only the DS model shows the ea spectral signature to
persist for any length of time  03 Gyr during the period of active star formation This
result suggests that formation of ea galaxies is closely associated with dust extinction
thus conrming the earlier suggestion by Poggianti et al 1999 and Shioya  Bekki 2000
Furthermore as is shown in Figure 3 our modeling approach allows us to clearly observe
the dierent morphological phases of the merger and to track the changes in spectral type
in tandem through each For the eb spectral phase two tidally interacting disks are
clearly observed whereas for the ea spectral phase only a morphologically peculiar galaxy
with clear signs of merging a tidal dwarf and a very diuse plume-like structure can be
seen For the kak phases the merger becomes almost dynamically relaxed and thus does
not show any clear relic of the past merging events These results imply that the observed
fraction of mergers among akka ie EA galaxies eg Zabludo et al 1996 can
actually be underestimated
Figure 4 clearly shows an interesting physical correlation between the evolution in the
infrared luminosity LIR and that seen in H emission To be more specic as the LIR
becomes higher H emission becomes also stronger during the evolution in the DS model
The present model furthermore shows the larger dierence in H luminosity between the
two models DF and DS when the LIR becomes higher eg a factor of 100 dierence
for T  13 Gyr Considering the results given in Figure 2 these results suggest that
1 a dusty starburst merger with an ea spectrum can exhibit very high LIR  1011
L but 2 this might not necessarily be accompanied by a high luminosity in H The
rst of these suggestions is consistent with recent observations of infrared luminous ea
galaxies by Poggianti  Wu 2000 The second means that even H observations can
considerably underestimate by a factor of  100 the real star formation rate of a dusty
starburst galaxy and therefore infrared observations are much better for inferring the true
 8 
star formation rate Thus our spectrodynamical model has not only succeeded in providing
an evolutionary link between galaxies with dierent spectral types eg ea and ka but
has also suggested physical correlations between spectral types morphological properties
and infrared uxes

4 Discussion and conclusion
Our numerical results prompt the following question can major galaxy merging
account for the observation that the fraction of kaak galaxies in distant clusters
10-20 at z  04 eg Dressler et al 1999 is an order of magnitude higher than the
fraction observed in low redshift clusters From their own observations of the cluster
MS1054-03 at z  083 together with data taken from studies at lower redshift van
Dokkum et al 1999 showed that the fraction of interactingmerging galaxies evolved
very rapidly with redshift as 1  z62 over the interval 0  z  083 By using this
observed relation and assuming i that it refers to major mergers and ii that all these
mergers evolve spectrally to become kaak galaxies the expected fraction of kaak
galaxies fk is found to be 75  38  fk  148 at z  04 The expected value
is similar to the observed one 10-20 which is consistent with major merging being the
physical mechanism which drives the rapid evolution of the kaak population We here
stress that since the merger rate at high redshift is estimated only for the single z  083
cluster the expected merger rate at intermediate redshift is not so reliable However
 9 
this conclusion is strongly countered by the observation that a signicant fraction of the
kaak types are disk systems eg See Figure 10 in Dressler et al 1999  an unlikely
candidate for the type of system likely to be produced in a major merger Indeed only a
minor merger would seem capable of keeping the disk component intact Thus considering
the observed redshift evolution of merger rates that of akka populations and the
dependence of the morphological transformation processes on the mass ratio of the two
merging disks it would seem that major merging can explain the origin of only a small
fraction of the kaak population
We have found that dusty starburst galaxies with ea spectra are plausible precursors
to akka galaxies This raises a further question what fraction of the kaak
galaxies observed in distant clusters were previously starburst galaxies with ea spectra
Although a comparison of the fraction of ea galaxies with that of kaak types gives a
rough estimate of the fraction of kaak galaxies which have evolved from ea galaxies
Couch  Sharples 1987 Barger et al 1996 Poggianti et al 1999 the dusty nature of
starburst galaxies makes this estimation considerably inaccurate For example based
on the detection of some ka galaxies by 14 GHz VLA radio observations Smail et al
1999 suggested that even ka galaxies classied by EWOII and EWH can be dusty
starburst galaxies Hence more accurate observational estimation of star formation rate is
necessary for answering the above question
Couch et al 2000 have investigated the incidence of H emission  considered to
be much less aected by dust than OII emission  in members of the cluster AC114 at
z  032 and found that the star formation rate in the  5 of galaxies so found to be
strongly and uniformly suppressed less than 4 M yr1 right throughout the cluster
r  225 h1
50 Mpc Balogh  Morris 2000 also investigated H emission from galaxies
in Abell 2390 at z  023 and also found the star formation rate inferred from H to be
 10 
rather low These observational studies strongly suggest that unless the dust extinction
is sucient to totally obscure the H emission which would require 4 magnitudes of
extinction Couch et al 2000 the fraction of ongoing dusty starbursts must be very
small as would also be the fraction of galaxies which evolve from ea into kaaks
However considering the observational evidence that the star formation rate inferred from
H emission is a factor of 520 times smaller than that from far-infrared uxes for strongly
star-bursting dusty galaxies eg Poggianti  Wu 2000 more systematic infrared and
radio observations will be important for estimating the true fraction of ongoing starburst
galaxies in distant clusters It will only be the combination of systematic H infrared
and radio observations that will unambiguously measure the star formation rate in dusty
star-forming galaxies and this answer the question as to the origin of kaak galaxies
