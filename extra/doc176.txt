If the dark matter sector in the Universe is composed by metastable particles galaxies and galaxy
clusters are expected to undergo signicant secular evolution from high to low redshift We show
that the decay of dark matter with a lifetime compatible with cosmological constraints can be
at the origin of the observed evolution of the Tully-Fisher relation of disk galaxies and alleviate
the problem of the size evolution of elliptical galaxies while being consistent with the current
observational constraints on the gas fraction of clusters of galaxies
Introduction
In the standard  cold dark matter
CDM model the dynamics of the Universe in the
present epoch is dominated by dark matter DM and
dark energy The DM which plays a crucial role in the
growth of structure does not have appreciable interac-
tions with radiation and cannot be in the form of or-
dinary baryonic matter as deduced from considerations
of big-bang nucleosynthesis together with observations
of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background
The CDM model further assumes that the DM par-
ticles are stable and that any interactions have a neg-
ligible eect on the cosmological evolution This model
is extremely successful at reproducing the matter dis-
tribution on Mpc scales and above However on the
smallest scales where galaxies are formed the simula-
tions of structure growth seem to disagree with the ob-
servations of real galaxies 2 Numerical simulations of
dark halo formation in the CDM cosmology result in
highly cusped density distributions and abundance of
substructure 3
In contrast the number of satellite
dwarf spheroidal galaxies identied in the local group
is lower than the number of subhalos found in simula-
tions 4 and there is evidence that the halo of the Milky
Way is not cusped at all 5 Also the recent ndings
that all dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Milky Way rang-
ing in luminosity by more than 4 orders of magnitude
have DM halos with a common mass  107M do not
follow from the standard CDM scenario 6 At larger
scales recent high-redshift surveys indicate a structural
and kinematical evolution of galaxies which has not ob-
vious explanation in the standard CDM structure for-
mation scenario In particular there is growing evidence
that the Tully-Fisher TF 7 relation for disc galax-
ies relating their stellar mass M and rotation speed
evolves with redshift z in the sense that higher-z galax-
ies have higher rotation speeds than local galaxies of sim-
ilar M 8 9 in addition elliptical galaxies of given M
are found to be more compact at higher z 10
ture observations and the predictions from simula-
tions 11
In particular baryonic processes might af-
fect signicantly disc galaxies which at high redshift are
characterized by high star formation rate 8 Elliptical
galaxies are found to be quiescent at z  2 but sev-
eral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the size
evolution of elliptical galaxies in the context of standard
CDM 12 However given the dominant role played by
DM in the growth of structure a compelling possibility
is that the DM particles are not as cold stable or in-
ert as it is assumed in the CDM scenario Warmer or
strongly self-interacting DM particles produce more con-
stant density cores with a higher minimum mass for DM
haloes 13 although the absence of low mass haloes at
large redshift would aect the reionization history 14
However since the formation of structure at larger galac-
tic scales coincides with the CDM scenario the issues
with the fast evolution of early-type galaxies would re-
Forfeiting the stability assumption
if the particles
composing the DM sector decay with a lifetime of a few
tens of Gyr consistent with observations as discussed
below the formation of structure would proceed until
recently z  1 as in the CDM model successfully
reproducing the matter distribution on Mpc scales and
above 15 Interestingly the depletion of a fraction of
the DM due to subsequent decays aects the evolution
of structure at galactic and subgalactic scales 1518
Cen 16 discussed the possibility that decaying dark mat-
ter DDM could solve the problem of the central cusp in
DM halos and the overabundance of dwarf galaxies but
he also indicated some astrophysical implications of this
scenario on the scale of galaxies and clusters of galax-
ies that could be tested observationally In this paper
we explore whether the recent observations of the evolu-
tion of disc and elliptical galaxies from z  2 and the
available data on the gas fraction of clusters from z  1
can be t within a DDM scenario consistent with recent
cosmological constraints
Astrophysical processes
undoubtedly important
could alleviate the tension between sub-galactic struc-
Viable DM candidates with lifetimes on cosmological
scales frequently appear in particle physics models be-
yond the standard model In fact much like CP is not a
symmetry of nature there is no fundamental reason that
requires the discrete symmetries usually associated with
the stability of DM such as R-parity in supersymmetric
extensions of the standard model to hold For instance
in supersymmetric models where a gravitino is the light-
est supersymmetric particle a subset of R-parity violat-
ing couplings allows a fast enough decay of the next-to-
lightest-supersymmetric particle to avoid conicts with
big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions without inducing
the decay of the proton at an unacceptable rate 19 Like
in the R-symmetric case the required relic density can
result from thermal processes and in some scenarios
its decay products could be observed in cosmic-ray de-
tectors 20 Also DDM has been recently linked to the
origin of neutrino masses 21
Model Let us consider DM particles that decay into
relativistic particles with a characteristic lifetime   We
will assume that the decay products are electromagnet-
ically noninteracting so that only the cosmological evo-
lution is modied with respect to the standard CDM
model through the coupling between the matter and
the radiation sectors In particular observations of the
anisotropies in the CMB put a stringent lower bound
on   since DDM aects the evolution of the cosmologi-
cal perturbations at late times enhancing the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe eect 22 Using rst year WMAP obser-
vations the authors in 23 conclude that a particle mak-
ing the whole of the DM should have a lifetime   52
Gyr 954 CL A recent study combining the lat-
est WMAP data together with type-Ia supernovae large
scale structure and weak lensing observations strength-
ens the limit to   100 Gyr 24 However some
of these datasets have been analyzed with the assump-
tion that the CDM model is correct which could bias
comparisons between models with a markedly dierent
cosmological evolution 25 Moreover the ts to the
CMB datasets assume that the primordial uctuations
are purely adiabatic while a sizable admixture of isocur-
vature perturbations is allowed by observations 26 In
that case the power at low multipoles could be reduced
further weakening the constraints from the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe eect In view of these facts we will con-
sider two benchmark models a DDM model with   52
Gyr and a more conservative scenario with   100 Gyr

In this framework we want to study the secular evo-
lution of galaxies and galaxy clusters due to the decay
of DM In the absence of other evolutionary eects from
high to low redshift galaxies should expand and their
rotation speed should diminish and the gas mass frac-
tion in clusters should increase as a consequence of the
variation of mass in DM Interestingly the recent obser-
vations of the evolution of the TF relation for disc galax-
ies and the ndings that elliptical galaxies of a given M
are found to be more compact at higher z appear qual-
itatively in agreement with this expected trend On the
other hand there is no evidence for an evolution with z
of the gas fraction fgas of clusters though as we show
below current data cannot exclude a variation of fgas of
the order of 20 at z  1
Given that we consider particle lifetimes  longer than
the age of the Universe we can safely assume that struc-
ture formation at high z is unaected by the decay Once
a DM halo has decoupled from the Hubble ow and viri-
alized at some time ti its structure and dynamics will be
aected by the DDM density evolving as

Quantitatively Cen 16 considered the case in which one-
half of the DM particles decay into relativistic particles
from the time of halo formation to the present the de-
pletion of such a high fraction of DM corresponds to too
short a lifetime   19 Gyr Here we reconsider the as-
trophysical consequences of DDM by assuming lifetimes
consistent with recently determined cosmological con-
straints comparing the predictions of the DDM model
with state-of-the-art observations of galaxies and galaxy
clusters
Results On the scale of galaxies the decay of DM
has the eect of an adiabatic expansion of the DM halo
because  is much larger than the galactic dynamical
time 16 To explore quantitatively the consequences of
this process on the structure and kinematics of galax-
ies we have performed N-body simulations of the evolu-
tion of the collisionless systems representing the galactic
DM distribution taking into account the nite lifetime
of the DM particles We adapted the parallel N-body
code FVFPS 27 so that the mass of each DM particle
in the N-body simulation varies in time according to the
exponential decay law given the collisionless nature of
the simulated system this is an eective way to model
the decrease of the number of DM particles due to the
decay We assume that at some initial redshift zi the DM
halo is in equilibrium with isotropic velocity distribution
found in the case   100 Gyr Our   52 Gyr model
at z  0 is a Milky Way like DM halo with total mass
 12  1012M and vcmax  216 km s1 Assuming that
most of the galactic stellar mass is in place at z  22
our results suggest that in the absence of other evolu-
tionary eects a z  22 disk galaxy with stellar mass
similar to that of the Milky Way should have  22
larger vcmax than the Milky Way the variation in vcmax
might be smaller if the baryonic mass contributes signif-
icantly within the radius at which vc peaks As DDM
implies secular evolution for all galaxies it predicts that
the M-vcmax relation of galaxies must evolve with z As-
suming that the maximum circular velocity of the halo
can be taken as a proxy of the maximum line-of-sight
rotation speed of observed disk galaxies the DDM sce-
nario predicts a higher normalization of the TF relation
of  22 in rotation speed at z  22 than at z  0 if
  52 Gyr Remarkably the observationally estimated
oset between the z  22 and the z  0 TF relation is
23  6 8
As outlined above another secular evolution eect pre-
dicted by the DDM model is that galaxies should become
more extended from high to low z It is then tempting to
try to explain in this framework the recent nding that
early-type galaxies of similar M appear to have smaller
half-light radius Re at high z than at z  0 with an
increase in size of at least a factor of  2  3 from z  2
to the present 10 To make predictions on the evolution
of Re in a DDM model we ran a few simulations similar
to those described above but in which we allow for the
presence of a stellar component embedded in the DDM
halo We found that Re increases roughly proportionally
to r50 so we can safely use the results of our DDM-only
simulations Even our DDM with   52 Gyr predicts an
increase in size of  24 and thus cannot explain the ob-
served dramatic increase in size As in standard CDM
cosmology also in DDM cosmology other eects must be
invoked in order to explain these observations Neverthe-
less it is interesting that the problem of the size evolution
of early-type galaxies is alleviated in DDM especially
given the possibility that the sizes of high-z galaxy could
be underestimated in current observations 29
The decay of DM has a straightforward implication
for the evolution of the gas fraction fgas in clusters of
galaxies in a cluster of xed gas mass we expect the gas
fraction to evolve in time as fgas  1  k expt 1
with k constant In Fig 2 we compare this prediction
for   52 Gyr with the gas mass fraction measurements
from 30 which represent the largest sample available
with the smallest relative statistical error median value
of about 13 and limited intrinsic scatter the weighted
mean scatter around the best-t CDM model is 7
Considering that all the dependence on the cosmology
can be written as fgas  dLz15 30 31 we plot the val-
ues originally estimated in a CDM universe corrected
by the factor d15

the estimate of the depletion parameter b depends on
many aspects of the hydrodynamical simulations investi-
gated For example i grid-based shock-capturing nu-
merical codes tend to estimate a value b larger by up to
10 percent than what is measured in smoothed particle
hydrodynamics ii radiative processes such as cooling
and star formation with feedback provided from galactic
winds redistribute the baryons within the virial radius
in particular in the cluster core through the conversion
of gas into stars and the replacement of the condensing
gas with gas from the outer regions with a net eect
that reduces the gas mass fraction and increases slightly
the total baryon fraction with respect to the runs where
such processes were not considered iii the evolution
with cosmic time of b is expected to be very mild and
less than 5 percent at z  1 with respect to the local
value To mitigate at least partially these uncertainties
observers prefer to select only hot massive and relaxed
galaxy clusters that are expected to be dominated en-
ergetically by gravitational collapse and should be well
represented from simulations with no radiative processes
included as done in the present study by following the
prescription in 30 see also discussion on the estimate
of b in 31
Conclusion We have shown that the current obser-
vational constraints on the secular evolution of galaxies
and galaxy clusters are consistent with a DDM cosmol-
ogy with a lifetime larger than   52 Gyr which is the
shortest DM decaying timescale that can be reconciled
with CMB observations This nding is remarkable be-
cause the cosmological constraints on  are completely
independent of the set of observations of galaxies and
galaxy clusters at dierent redshifts used for compari-
son so DM decaying with the shortest timescale allowed
by cosmology could in principle give a redshift evolution
of galaxies and galaxy clusters so strong to be excluded
by current observations Our results imply that a DDM
scenario with DM lifetime   52 Gyr is not disfavored
with respect to the standard stable DM scenario on the
basis of astrophysical as well cosmological arguments
We nd it suggestive that DDM could explain natu-
rally the observed redshift-evolution of the TF relation
of disc galaxies though this cannot be considered per
se evidence that DM decays In fact in our exploration
we isolated the eect of DM decay by neglecting other
processes such as baryonic physics and galaxy interac-
tions that though poorly constrained are expected
to inuence the dynamical evolution of disc galaxies
The gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters can provide
a robust test of DDM models once both the statistical
errors and the intrinsic scatter can be constrained well
below the expected change of the order of 15 in the
redshift range 0  12 In addition precise observations
of ultrafaint dwarfs with a wide-eld spectrograph such
as Gaia or SIM Lite 33 will shed light on the DM distri-
bution at subgalactic scales where the DDM could also
