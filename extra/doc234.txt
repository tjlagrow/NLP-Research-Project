Abstract The dependence of star formation rate on galaxian environ-
ment is a key issue in the understanding of galaxy formation and evolu-
tion However the study of this subject is complex and observationally
challenging This paper reviews some of the current results drawing
mostly from recent large redshift surveys such the LCRS the MORPH
collaboration and the CNOC1 and CNOC2 redshift surveys
Introduction
Tremendous strides have been made in the last few years in understanding the
average star formation history of the universe from the present to as far back
as 90 of the age of the universe eg Steidel et al 1999 Sawicki et al 1997
However the overall picture remains crude and is still subject to many uncer-
tainties and systematics Most of the advances have been based on converting
the UV luminosity density in dierent epochs into an average star formation rate
SFR This requires averaging over volume and extrapolating over luminosity
The universe contains signicant large scale structures even at epochs as early
as z  3 Giavalisco et al 1998 as galaxies formed initially in the most mas-
sive dark matter halos Voids laments and rich clusters mark very dierent
environments in which galaxies reside To come to a full physical understand-
ing of galaxy formation and galaxy evolution we need to have a more detailed
picture such as the history of star formation in dierent environments This is
an observationally challenging task as currently we have barely begun to study
these issues in the relatively nearby universe
There are two major observational questions that we ultimately would like
to answer First how does the SFR depend on the environment Second how
does this dependence evolve with time Currently we have some idea of the
answers to the rst question and little or no information on the second Simple
physical arguments provide some expectations on the inuence of environments
on SFR however these are not always clear cut Processes that lower gas
content of a galaxy are expected to decrease SFR these include eg ram-
pressure stripping and evaporation in rich environments tidal stripping from
close encounters of galaxies and the decrease of the accretion rate of new gas
into a galaxy in rich environments On the other hand similar processes can
also serve to increase the SFR eg ram-pressure and tidal shocks and mergers
and harassment of galaxies in close encounters
H K C Yee
To obtain denitive and quantitative conclusions well-controlled large sam-
ples in the thousands of galaxies with redshift multi-color photometry and
spectroscopic information are required Perhaps large robust photometric red-
shift samples can provide some needed advancement also Examples of com-
pleted redshift surveys that meet these goals include the LCRS eg Shectman
et al 1996 for z  01 the CNOC1 cluster redshift survey Yee et al 1996 with
2600 redshifts in elds of galaxy clusters at 017  z  055 and the CNOC2
eld galaxy redshift survey Yee et al 2000 with 6000 redshifts at 01  z  06
In this review which is not intended to be complete I will look at three
issues The rst is the star formationenvironment dependence in the local
universe We will then survey the current knowledge of dierential cluster-eld
evolution mostly by looking at galaxy populations in rich galaxy clusters at
moderate redshifts Finally some conjectures and remarks are made regarding
the evolution of SFR and its environmental dependence
2 The Local Universe
In the local universe the SFR-environment relationship in the sense that SFR
is apparently smaller on average in denser environments is well known if not
well understood Indirect evidence supporting this correlation comes from the
combination of the morphology-density relation of galaxies eg Dressler 1981
and the correlation between H or OII equivalent widths and morphological
types eg Kennicutt 1983 However the question that may be more impor-
tant to our understanding of SFR and environment is the more complex issue
of whether similar galaxies in dierent environments have similar SFRs The
complexity arises not only from having to take galaxy morphology which is
observationally dicult to quantify into consideration but also that apparent
morphological classication is inherently intertwined with star formation rate
The latter issue has not been seriously considered in any of the investigations
discussed below It is parenthetically noted that the best course for correcting
for morphological distribution will likely require excellent IR band images where
episodic star formation will not skew the morphological classication as much
21 Results from the LCRS
The 26000 redshift LCRS Shectman et al 1996 provides a local z  01
galaxy sample suciently large to examine the SFR in dierent environments
However the lack of color data in the LCRS is a drawback Hashimoto et
al 1998 studied the dependence of SFR on environment using OII strengths in
the LCRS They quantied the environment using a local galaxy density param-
eter and attempted to account for the morphological dependence by classifying
galaxies with a concentration parameter They further divided their galaxies
into cluster and eld They found that in general galaxies considered in
clusters have lower SFR and that within the two respective global environ-
ments galaxies in higher density regions have a lower emission line fraction even
when both results are corrected for the concentration parameter distribution
Allam et al 1999 used the same data set but dened the environment as
compact and loose groups and eld They found a somewhat inconclusive result
that while the fraction of strong star bursts are higher in the eld by a factor
APS Conf Ser Style
of 2 over that in compact clustersgroups the distributions of the equivalent
width of OII are similar in all three environments This they concluded may
indicate that galaxy morphology accounts for most of the dierences in SFR
3 Dierential Cluster-Field Evolution
Galaxy clusters oered one of the rst direct observations of galaxy evolution
Butcher  Oemler 1984 in that more distant clusters evidently have higher
blue galaxy fractions Most of what we now know regarding dierential evolution
of galaxies in dierent environments stems from comparing the eld and rela-
tively rich clusters at dierent redshifts given that measuring galaxy environ-
ment is even more dicult in the more distant universe Dierential cluster-eld
evolution is an important piece in the puzzle of the dependence of SFR on envi-
ronment Such information is not only pertinent in our understanding of galaxy
formation and evolution but is also vital in cosmology eg in the determination
of m using Oorts method eg Carlberg Yee  Ellingson 1997
31 The Butcher-Oemler Eect
The Butcher-Oemler B-O eect was veried by the spectroscopic work of
Dressler et al
1992 and references therein They also found a signicant
percentage of a new spectroscopic class of galaxies in these intermediate redshift
clusters  EA or the more recent and appropriate name KA which can be
interpreted as post-starburst galaxies Zabludo et al 1996 searched for KA
galaxies in the LCRS sample They concluded that at low redshift unlike the
result obtained by Dressler et al for the higher-z B-O clusters the fractions of
KA galaxies are similar in the eld and clusters and at the less than 1 level
High-resolution imaging from HST of the B-O clusters appears to show
a preponderance of spiral galaxies
leading to the conclusion by Dressler et
al 1997 that the blue galaxies found in the B-O clusters likely turn into the
population of S0 galaxies that dominate the centers of low-z clusters However
the process by which this occurs is not certain
32 Recent Large Spectroscopic Surveys CNOC1 and MORPH
The CNOC1 redshift survey Yee et al 1996 a large spectroscopic survey of
EMSS clusters with a redshift range of 017 to 055 provides one of the best and
largest data sets to investigate the dierential evolution of eld and clusters of
galaxies The survey contains 2600 redshifts of which 1300 are cluster galaxies
The survey is also unique in that it covers galaxies out to cluster-centric radii of
well over 2 h1 Mpc The eld galaxy component has been augmented signi-
cantly by the recent completion of the CNOC2 eld galaxy redshift survey Yee
et al 2000 which contains about 6000 redshifts These two sets of data provide
self-consistent comparisons of the stellar populations in the two environments
The CNOC1 data set has been investigated using two complementary ap-
proaches One is the classical method of measuring line strengths and indices
The results are presented in a series of papers by Abraham et al 1998 Morris
et al 1999 and Balogh et al 1999 The CNOC data allow one to make
comparisons of the cluster and eld populations at the same redshift The main
H K C Yee
conclusion from these investigations is that there is no signicant excess star
formation or burst activity over that of eld galaxies at similar redshifts de-
spite the presence of the B-O eect It is shown that the OII equivalent width
W0OII which is used as an indicator of SFR smoothly increases with cluster-
centric radius to the value found in the eld There is no excess of either the
average W0OII or the number of galaxies with large W0OII at radii as
large as 25 h1 Mpc Balogh et al 1999 also found that the fractions of KA
galaxies dened by W0H  5A and W0OII  5A in clusters and eld at
z  03 are similar at about 1 to 2 and show only a small but statistically
insignicant change from that measured in the local universe from the LCRS
by Zabludo et al 1996 The CNOC1 results suggest that as eld galaxies fall
into a rich cluster their star formation is truncated in gradual processes and
they then evolve passively to become members of the red galaxy population
The CNOC1 results however are apparently discrepant with those ob-
tained by the MORPH collaboration Dressler et al 1999 Poggianti et al 1999
The MORPH collaboration found a much higher fraction of KA and starburst
Aem galaxies in clusters compared to the eld For example with a deni-
tion of W0H  3A for KA galaxies they found fractions of 21 and 6 for
clusters and eld respectively The discrepancy with CNOC1 results remains
very large after adjusting for the dierent denitions Balogh et al 1999 pro-
vide an extensive discussion for possible explanations for the dierences which
include galaxy and cluster sample selections and measurement methods
33 Principle Component Analysis of the CNOC1 Sample
A new approach in studying the populations and star formation in galaxies is
using the technique of Principle Component Analysis PCA eg Connolly et
al 1995 which allows one to derive the relative fraction of the stellar popula-
tions in galaxies without making discrete individual measurements such as line
indices Preliminary results from the CNOC1 survey are reported in Ellingson
et al 1999 Using the PCA method we can deproject the stellar popula-
tions of cluster galaxies into three components cluster-like eld-like and
post-star-formation psf From the combined data of 15 clusters Ellingson
et al found that the cluster-like component shows a strong positive gradient
towards the center while the eld-like component shows a strong negative gra-
dient Furthermore the components match onto the eld values at about 25r200
where r200 is the radius at which the interior average mass density of the cluster
is 200c or about 3 h1 Mpc
The PCA decomposition also shows that the eld-like and psf components
have a larger spatial extent than that of the cluster-like component Separating
the CNOC1 sample into a z  03 median z of 042 and z  03 median
z of 023 sample it is found that the higher z sample has a larger eld-like
fraction outside of the central 025 r200 This is simply a restatement of the B-O
eect but now using the eld galaxies at the redshifts of the clusters as ducials
Ellingson et al also computed the average luminosity proles of the cluster-like
and eld-like components for clusters in the two redshift bins The interesting
result is that the red ie cluster-like component essentially has an identical
prole in the two epochs while the blue ie eld-like component for the
higher-z subsample shows a drop relative to the lower-z clusters while retaining
APS Conf Ser Style
a similar prole shape This suggests that the B-O eect can be explained most
simply by a change in the eld galaxy infall rate over the redshift range rather
than a change in the physical processes of converting blue eld galaxies into red
galaxies over these time scales although such explanations are not ruled out
4 Groups Pairs and Poor Environments
The dependence of galaxy evolution as a function of environment other than in
rich cluster is an observationally challenging subject of study and currently we
basically know very little in this area The primary obstacle is the diculty in
dening the environment of a galaxy even at moderate redshifts eg producing
a well-understood sample of galaxy groups of dierent richness
Allington-Smith et al 1993 used radio galaxies as markers for galaxy
groups and clusters of varying richness They compared the blue-galaxy fraction
fB of 14 groups of varying richness at z  03 with a larger sample of groups
at z  005 from the CfA redshift survey For the CfA groups it was found that
fB increases from less than  005 for the rich groups to  03 over a richness
range of about 20 For the higher z groups they concluded that although fB
increases in general the color-environment relationship seen in the CfA sample
no longer exists However it appears that their conclusion was dependent on
only two poor but apparently red groups in their high-z sample One can just
as easily conclude that based on their Figure 19 the fB-richness relation for
their high-z sample is entirely consistent with that of their low-z sample their
Figure 16 shifted blueward by the same amount for all environments
The CNOC2 Field Redshift Survey Yee et al 2000 is currently the largest
redshift sample at the intermediate redshift range of  035 An initial report on
the evolution of the LF of the galaxy sample as a whole has been given in Lin
et al 1999 More detailed analyses of the evolution of galaxies are underway
and it is expected to oer some rudimentary clues on the evolution of galaxies
in dierent environments Very preliminary indications are that the relative
evolution of galaxies in dierent environments may not be drastically dierent
at least for the more luminous galaxies This is supported by an analysis of close
spectroscopic pairs Patton et al 2000 in preparation Carlberg et al 2000a
in which the derived merger rate show very little evolution up to redshift of
1 as opposed to a number of earlier studies Furthermore there appears to
be little or no evolution in the clustering length of luminous galaxies over this
redshift range leading Carlberg et al 2000b to conclude that the evolution of
M  galaxies seen over the intermediate redshift range is not driven by a change
in environment Also a very preliminary analysis of the SFR as indicated by
the spectral energy distribution of the CNOC2 sample as a function of local
galaxy space density as measured by the richness parameter Bgc see Yee 
Lopez-Cruz 1999 shows that the changes over redshift are similar over a span
of a factor of 10 in richness
5 Summary Remarks
The interplay between galaxian environment and star formation is clearly a
key issue in the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution
It is also
H K C Yee
a dicult and complex problem and requires extensive observational resources
to make denitive progress There are clear indications of the eect of the
environment when we compare extreme cases of the cores of rich clusters and
the eld However the environmental eect on the rate of galaxy evolution
may be subtle in that over a less extreme range denitive dierences in relative
evolution have not been observed conclusively Some of the most intriguing and
useful work in this area may come from the direct observations of the eects of
a changing environment on star formation and galaxy evolution as found in the
infalling galaxies at the outskirts of rich clusters A thorough investigation of the
phenomenon covering a large span of cluster-centric radius and over a range of
redshift may provide a crucial piece of the puzzle More detailed investigations
into the star formation properties of galaxies in clusters such as those carried out
by Moss  Whittle 2000 in these proceedings using H narrow-band imaging
has the possibility of providing physical details on how the star formation process
is aected when a galaxy falls into a cluster
