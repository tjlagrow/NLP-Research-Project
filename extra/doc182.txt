We have studied the pitch angles of spiral arms for 31 distant galaxies at z  07 from three Hubble
Deep Fields HDF-N HDF-S HUDF Using the pitch angle  rotation velocity relation calibrated from
nearby galaxies we have estimated the rotation velocities of galaxies from the deep elds These estimates
have a low accuracy 50 kms but they allow low-mass and giant galaxies to be distinguished The
TullyFisher relation constructed using our velocity estimates shows satisfactory agreement with the
actually observed relations for distant galaxies and provides evidence for the luminosity evolution of
spiral galaxies
1 Introduction
The pitch angle of spiral arms is a major parameter
of the classical morphological classication of galaxies
Hubble 1936 The pitch angle is the angle between
the tangents to the spiral arm and to the circumfer-
ence centered at the galaxy nucleus drawn through a
given point Galaxies with tightly wound spirals and
open arms have small and large pitch angles respec-
tively Typically the pitch angle lies within the range
 0  30 Kennicutt 1981 Ma 2001
In 1981 Kennicutt published a paper in which the
relation between the pitch angle of a spiral galaxy
and its maximum rotation velocity was studied It
followed from this paper that galaxies with tightly
wound arms smaller pitch angles rotated on aver-
age faster than those with more open arms larger
pitch angles with this dependence being linear In
recent years investigating the pitch angle of spiral
arms has become increasingly popular because sev-
eral unexplained empirical relationships of this quan-
tity to the parameters of the galaxy rotation curve
and to the mass of the central black hole have been
found see eg Seigar et al 2008 Shields et al 2010
The goal of this paper is to develop the results from
Kennicutt 1981 and to try to apply the pitch angle
 rotation velocity relation to determine the rotation
velocities of distant spiral galaxies from the Hubble
Deep Fields HUDF HDF-N and HDF-S Since many
of these galaxies are very faint and have small angular
sizes measuring their rotation velocities by spectro-
scopic methods requires instrumentation that will not
be available in the near future However knowledge
of these velocities is needed to study the evolution
of galaxies at high z In addition there are virtually
no data on the pitch angles of spiral arms for distant
spiral galaxies at present
All numerical values in the paper are given for the
cosmological model with the Hubble constant 70 km

2 Measurements
21 Determining the orientation of galaxy disks
An important preliminary stage of our work to study
the shape of spiral arms is to estimate the orientation
of galaxy disks in space This orientation is speci-
ed by two parameters the inclination i of the disk
plane to the plane of the sky and the position angle
P A of the major axis Knowing these parameters is
needed for two reasons First because of the galaxy
inclination to the plane of the sky the apparent spi-
ral structure is distorted and therefore the galaxy
image should be deprojected to the face-on orien-
tation Second the galaxy rotation velocity derived
from spectroscopic measurements should also be cor-
rected for the inclination
In this paper we decided to use the relatively new
method of spiral-arm monotony SAM Poltorak and
Fridman 2007 Fridman and Poltorak 2010 This
method is based on the assumption that every spiral
SS Savchenko VP Reshetnikov Pitch angles
arm is a monotonic function ie following along the
spiral from the galaxy center to the periphery the
radius must increase monotonically  dr
d  0 where
r is the distance from a point in the spiral arm to
the galaxy center and  is the azimuthal angle In
this case the spiral projected onto the plane of the
sky can be represented by a nonmonotonic function
Thus the domain of i and P A for which the depro-
jected spiral is monotonic will be the domain of pos-
sible inclinations and position angles
An example of using the SAM method to estimate
the orientation of four nearby galaxies is shown in
Fig 1 We see from the gure that the domains of
possible values are relatively small which allows both
inclination and position angle of the galaxy major
axis to be estimated with a good accuracy
22 The pitch angle
Once the galaxy images have been corrected for the
inclination we can turn to the determination of
spiral-arm pitch angles As the published data show
the pitch angles for the same objects often dier
markedly Therefore for reliability we decided to im-
plement two dierent completely independent meth-
ods and to compare their results
The rst method below called the interactive one
is based directly on the search for the angle between
the tangents to the spiral arm and to the circumfer-
ence centered at the galaxy nucleus If the spiral arm
is represented in polar coordinates r  r the co-
ordinate origin at the galaxy center then the pitch
angle for a logarithmic spiral can be determined from
the formula see eg Binney and Tremaine 1987

cid19 
The main steps in determining the pitch angle are
1 determining the coordinates of the galaxy cen-
ter 2 nding the polar coordinates of several 10
points on the arm 3 applying pairwise Eq 1 to the
derived coordinates to obtain the set of pitch angles
corresponding to dierent arm segments 4 averag-
ing the pitch angles to obtain the nal result
To reduce the random errors this procedure was
repeated several times for each arm If the galaxy
had several as a rule two large-scale arms suitable
for measurements then their pitch angles were also
estimated in the same way As the nal pitch angle
for a given galaxy we took the value averaged over
the measured arms
The second method is based on a Fourier analysis
of the distribution of points in the spiral arms of a
galaxy Considere and Athanassoula 1982 If the dis-
tribution of points in the galaxy arms is represented
as the sum of delta functions of their polar coordi-

gives the coecients in the expansion of this distribu-
tion in terms of logarithmic spirals The pitch angle
can be found from the formula

pmaxcid19 
where m is the number of spiral arms in the galaxy
and pmax is the value of the parameter p at which the
function Ap m has a maximum

31 The galaxy sample
To study the spiral pattern of nearby galaxies
we used the galaxy sample described by Kennicutt
1981 The sample includes 113 spiral galaxies of var-
ious types with a clearly distinguishable spiral struc-
ture Since the arms of barred galaxies are described
more poorly by a logarithmic spiral most of the sam-
ple galaxies are without bars or have small bars
The galaxy images in the ts format were retrieved
from the NED1 which contains references to observa-
tions with dierent instruments and in dierent spec-
tral ranges The pitch angle depends on the lter for
our purposes we used only the B-band images be-
cause the spiral structure is seen best in blue bands
No photometric calibration of the galaxy images was
required and therefore we used the data obtained
with dierent instruments from several possible op-
tions we chose the best one from the viewpoint of
visual image reduction where possible a higher res-
olution and a better view of the spiral structure

position angles
The maximum rotation velocities of the sample
galaxies Vmax found from the width of the HI 21
cm line prole were retrieved from the HyperLEDA2
The HyperLEDA rotation velocity have already been
corrected for the inclination found from the appar-
ent attening of galaxies and therefore we initially
eliminated this correction and subsequently applied it
again using the galaxy inclination estimated by the
SAM method see below
32 Measuring the pitch angle
For all galaxies from the sample by Kennicutt 1981
we estimated their orientation parameters the in-
clination and position angle of the major axis by
the SAM method The agreement of our inclina-
tions with those in HyperLEDA is on average good
hiM CP  iLEDAi  2  13 However for sev-
eral galaxies the apparent isophote attening method
gives obviously incorrect values due to various kinds
2 Lyon-Meudon Extragalactic Database
of peculiarities in the shapes of the outer isophotes of
galaxies
The SAM method has a limitation at low inclina-
tions ie when the galaxies are seen almost face-on
the error in the i and P A estimates increases greatly
with decreasing inclination For this reason we failed
to estimate the orientation parameters for 16 galaxies
and they were excluded from our sample in which
thus 97 objects remained
Once the images have been deprojected we deter-
mined the spiral-arm pitch angle for each galaxy by
the two methods At this step we excluded several
more galaxies with an excessively irregular and asym-
metric structure from our sample We failed to nd
the maximum rotation velocities for four galaxies In
addition we decided to restrict ourselves to the galax-
ies with inclinations in the range 30  i  60 be-
cause both pitch angles and maximum rotation ve-
locities can be reliably estimated for such galaxies
and their pitch angle  rotation velocity relation see
below is seen much better As a result 46 galaxies
remained in our sample of nearby galaxies with pitch

angles measured by the two methods and with known
rotation velocities 43 and 3 of which have two-armed
and three-armed spiral patterns respectively
Figure 2 compares our pitch-angle measurements
with the results from Kennicutt 1981 for both meth-
ods The straight lines indicate linear ts to the data
They suggest the existence of certain systematics in
the pitch-angle measurements probably attributable
to the dierence between the methods used The
mean dierences between the measurements for the
same galaxies are small   02  37 the dif-
ference between the pitch angle measured by the
rst interactive method and the angle measured by
Kennicutt and   00  35 the same for the
second method
Comparison of the two pitch-angle determination
methods described above shows good mutual agree-
ment between the results the dierence between the
angles estimated by the Fourier and interactive meth-
ods is   02  30 Both methods yield sim-
ilar results although formally the accuracy of the
method based on a Fourier analysis is higher
Figure 3 shows the logarithmic spirals constructed
from the spiral-pattern parameters we determined
and given with the galaxy inclinations and position
angle they were superimposed on the observed im-
ages of NGC 2997 and NGC 4254
33 The pitch angle  rotation velocity relation
for nearby galaxies
Figure 4 shows the pitch angle  rotation velocity
relations constructed by the two methods As we
see from the gure both approaches give signicant
correlations However the relation constructed from
the measurements using the Fourier transform has a
higher statistical signicance the linear correlation
coecient for it is 0725 versus 0600 for the relation
constructed by the interactive method In our sub-
sequent discussion we will use the pitch angles found
by a Fourier analysis Note also that the galaxies with
a three-armed pattern in Fig 4 are near the average
relation for galaxies with a two-armed pattern
The nal empirical relation found from 46 nearby
galaxies the solid straight line in Fig 4b is
  0049  0008  Vmaxkms
 2285  176
Curiously our Galaxy may satisfy this relation It
follows from Eq 5 that   12 for the Milky Way
with Vmax  220 kms This pitch angle is close to
the estimates of various authors see eg Tables 1
and 2 in Vallee 2005 However greatly diering pitch
angles of the Milky Way spiral pattern are also en-
countered in the literature see eg Levine et al

from the deep elds
41 The galaxy sample
To nd distant galaxies with a spiral structure we
used the original frames of the Hubble Deep Fields
HDF-N and HDF-S Ferguson et al 2000 as well as
the Ultra Deep Field HUDF Beckwith et al 2006
The main problem in compiling the sample was that
the angular sizes of many distant galaxies are too
small and therefore several objects with a distinct
spiral structure were not included in the sample to
avoid the errors due to image discreteness In addi-
tion a considerable number of deep-eld galaxies ap-
pear asymmetric and peculiar and no regular spiral
arms can be drawn for them
Our nal sample includes 31 galaxies 20 in HUDF
six in HDF-N and ve in HDF-S with a clearly dis-
tinguishable spiral pattern as a rule a two-armed
ones as in the case of nearby galaxies The mean red-
shift of these galaxies is hzi  069  030 Our list of
distant galaxies is presented in the table
42 Measurements
For all sample galaxies we downloaded their images
in the F606W lter because this is the only com-
mon lter for all three elds To estimate the orien-
tation of distant galaxies we used the SAM method
In the cases where this method yielded no denite
results we estimated the inclination and orientation
from the outer isophotes of the galaxies Such ob-
jects were discarded among the nearby galaxies but
were retained among the distant galaxies because of
the small size of their sample Their inclinations are
marked by the asterisk in the table
The results of our measurements of the inclination
i and spiral-pattern pitch angle  are summarized
in the table If a galaxy has only one arm suitable for
measurements the results are presented only for it
The galaxy redshifts the fourth column of the table
were taken from Wolf et al 2004 the COMBO-17
project for HUDF from Wirth et al 2004 for HDF-
N and from Sawicki and Mallen-Ornelas 2003 for

5 Comparison of the local and distant
galaxies
Figure 5 presents the histograms showing the pitch-
angle distributions for the local-sample galaxies and
for the galaxies from the deep elds We see good
agreement in the distribution of angles a maximum
near 14 and a gradual decline on both sides of the
maximum Thus one might expect the distributions
of rotation velocities for galaxies at dierent z to be
similar
Using the maximum rotation velocities of distant
galaxies estimated from the empirical relation 5
the table we constructed their TullyFisher TF
relation Fig 6 The solid line in the gure indicates
the relation for nearby galaxies in the same color band
Sakai et al 2000 As we see from the gure the dis-
tant galaxies are located on this plane with approxi-
mately the same slope as that for the nearby galaxies
but their distribution appears shifted towards higher
luminosities The value of this shift depends on the
galaxy redshift the galaxies at z  066 on average
follow the local relation while those at z  066 are
shifted upward Fig 6
The most probable cause of the systematic shift in
the positions of distant galaxies is the evolution of
their luminosity As was shown in numerous works
devoted to studying the evolution of the TF relation

et al 2003 As we see from the gure allowance for
the luminosity evolution slightly improved the agree-
ment between the relations for distant and nearby
galaxies
Consider two subsamples approximately equal in
size  galaxies with z  066 15 objects and z  066
16 galaxies The mean characteristics of the rst
subsample are hzi  044004 the standard error of
the mean is given hMF 606W i  2091  036 only
the k-correction was applied and hVmaxi  187  20
kms the characteristics of the second subsample are
hzi  093  005 hMF 606W i  2187  022 and
hVmaxi  167  16 kms
Using the local TF relation from Sakai et al 2000
we can estimate the expected absolute magnitude for
a galaxy with Vmax  18720 kms to be MF 606W 
207  10 and for a galaxy with Vmax  167  16
kms to be MF 606W  203  09 The mean ob-
served magnitude for galaxies with hzi  044 is
brighter than the expected one by M  0m21m1
and for the more distant subsample by M  1m6
0m9 According to the model by Bicker et al 2003
the corresponding values of the luminosity evolu-
tion for Sb-Sc galaxies are 0m30m5 and 0m60m9
Given the approximate nature of our method for esti-
mating the rotation velocities and the small size of the
galaxy sample it may be concluded that the shift of

6 Conclusions
We determined the spiral-arm pitch angles for 46
nearby galaxies with 30  i  60 by two dier-
ent methods the interactive one and using a Fourier
analysis of images The inclination of the galaxy
plane to the line of sight was found by the relatively
new method of spiral-arm monotony Poltorak and
Fridman 2007 Fridman and Poltorak 2010
We conrmed the conclusion by Kennicutt 1981
about the existence of a signicant correlation be-
tween the rotation velocity of a galaxy and the pitch
angle of its spiral arms This correlation is best traced
for intermediate galaxy disk inclinations when both
pitch angles and rotation velocities can be found with
a good accuracy
We measured the pitch angles for 31 spiral galax-
ies from several Hubble Deep Fields at mean redshift
hzi  07 Using the local empirical pitch angle  rota-
tion velocity relation we estimated the maximum ro-
tation velocities of distant galaxies the table These
We constructed the TF relation between the ab-
solute magnitudes and maximum rotation velocities
of distant galaxies estimated from the pitch angles of
the spiral pattern Despite the large scatter of data
we can tentatively conclude that the distant galaxies
follow the local TF relation with approximately the
same slope and in addition show evidence of lumi-
nosity evolution These results agree with the direct
measurements of the TF relation for distant galaxies
by spectroscopic methods
The morphological estimates of the rotation ve-
locities for distant galaxies can be useful in study-
ing the evolution of spiral galaxies especially in the
cases where no data on the rotation of a galaxy can
be obtained by spectroscopic methods because of its
faintness or its visibility conditions the galaxy is seen
almost face-on
