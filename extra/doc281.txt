ABSTRACT
We explore the properties of 24 eld earlytype galaxies in the redshift range 020  z  075
down to MB  1930 in a sample extracted from the FORS Deep Field and the William Her-
schel Deep Field Target galaxies were selected on the basis of a combination of luminosity
spectrophotometric type morphology and photometric redshift or broadband colours High
signaltonoise intermediateresolution spectroscopy has been acquired at the Very Large
Telescope complemented by deep high-resolution imaging with the Advanced Camera for
Surveys onboard the HST and additional groundbased multiband photometry All galaxy
spectra were observed under subarcsecond conditions and allow to derive accurate kinemat-
ics and stellar population properties of the galaxies To clarify the low level of star formation
detected in some galaxies we identify the amount of active galactic nuclei AGN activity in
our sample using archive data of Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray surveys Non of the galax-
ies in our sample were identied as secure AGN source based on their X-ray emission The
rest-frame B and K-band scaling relations of the Faber-Jackson relation and the Fundamental
Plane display a moderate evolution for the eld earlytype galaxies Lenticular S0 galaxies
feature on average a stronger luminosity evolution and bluer rest-frame colours which can be
explained that they comprise more diverse stellar populations compared to elliptical galaxies
The evolution of the FP can be interpreted as an average change in the dynamical effective
mass-to-light ratio of our galaxies as h log MLBzi  074  008 The ML evolu-
tion of these eld galaxies suggests a continuous mass assembly of eld early-type galaxies
during the last 5 Gyr that gets support by recent studies of eld galaxies up to z  1 Indepen-
dent evidence for recent star formation activity is provided by spectroscopic O II emission
H and photometric restframe broadband colors diagnostics Based on the H absorption
feature we detect a weak residual star formation for galaxies that accounts for 510 in
the total stellar mass of these galaxies The co-evolution in the luminosity and mass of our
galaxies favours a downsizing formation process We nd some evidence that our galaxies
experienced a period of star formation quenching possible triggered by AGN activity that is
in good agreement with recent results on both observational and theoretical side

1 INTRODUCTION
Earlytype galaxies the family consisting of elliptical and lentic-
ular galaxies hereafter ES0 galaxies represent one of the most
important diagnostics within the cosmological picture of galaxy
formation and evolution ES0 galaxies and bulges comprise most
of the baryonic stellar mass 50 or more of all stellar spectral
types in the present-day universe eg Bell et al 2003 and re-
side in the most massive dark matter haloes with halo masses up
to Mh  4  1013h1M at z  0 hence these systems are the
key ingredients for understanding the star formation and the mass
assembly history of the galaxy population as a whole and for the

structure formation starting from the early primordial stages of the
universe
Early hierarchical structure formation models based on Cold
Dark Matter particles predict different evolutionary paths and
assembly timescales for the densest environments of clusters
of galaxies and the lowest densities of isolated galaxies eg
Kauffmann 1996 Baugh et al 1998 Somerville  Primack 1999
Cole et al 2000 From typical age variations of 43 in the overall
stellar content between cluster and eld galaxies a late mass as-
sembly for massive ES0 galaxies of smaller subunits is expected
with the involved physical processes mainly star formation rates
gas cooling and heating poorly understood As a consequence the
simplied baryonic recipes are interpreted and implemented dif-
ferently in the simulations Benson et al 2002 In this paradigm
eld earlytype galaxies are assembled through merging and ac-
cretion events of smaller clumps and fragments on longer time
scales up to the recent past Diaferio et al 2001 De Lucia et al
2004 The environment is therefore suggested to play an impor-
tant role to constrain the formation and evolution of ES0 galax-
ies and their internal properties These predictions have signi-
cant imprints for the abundance and mass distribution of an ex-
isting or even fully established population of old massive sys-
tems at 1  z  2 Glazebrook et al 2004 Bundy et al 2006
Cimatti et al 2006 Borch et al 2006 Conselice et al 2007 and
also for recent claims of the detection of their possible progenitors
at high redshifts of z  2 Chapman et al 2004 Kriek et al 2006
Cimatti et al 2006 McGrath et al 2007
Over the past few years theoretical semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation have been improved dramatically By includ-
ing a secondary star burst mode to the previous quiescent star
formation history ie allowing a fraction of gas to be directly
transformed into stars in merging galaxies Kauffmann  Haehnelt
2000 Somerville et al 2001 an increasing amount of super-
nova feedback andor an additional effect of Active Galactic
Nuclei AGN feedback Granato et al 2004 Croton et al 2006
Bower et al 2006 De Lucia et al 2006 or virial shocks of in-
falling gas in a spherical halo Birnboim et al 2007 to suppress the
remaining star formation activity a much better agreement with the
observations has been achieved The suppression of star formation
in massive halos using primarily AGN feedback has a strong im-
pact at the top of the luminosity function LF that results in a far
less overproduction of massive galaxies at z  0 than earlier sim-
ulations while still providing a good description of the rest of the
observed LF up to z  15 Bower et al 2006 However there is
still a non-negligible excess of local luminous galaxies detectable
in the local simulated LF which models adjust by including ad-
ditional internal dust obscuration or a relative inefciency of the
stellar mass of merging galaxies that results in a population of free-
oating intergalactic stars Monaco et al 2006
Previous studies have quantied to detect the deviations from
passive evolutionary tracks as predicted by semi-analytic models in
the evolution of the Fundamental Plane FP Djorgovski  Davis
1987 Dressler et al 1987 This relationship is constructed among
the basic parameters of ES0 galaxies
their size the half-
light effective radius Re in kpc stellar kinetic energy cen-
tral velocity dispersion  in km s1 and luminosity average
surface brightness within Re hei in units of mag arcsec2
and provides a powerful tool to measure the the evolution of
the mass-to-light ML ratio as a function of redshift with-
out being subject to uncertainties in the photometric model es-
timates such as initial mass function or age andor metallic-
ity degeneracy Using this observational technique cluster early
type galaxies formed the majority of their stars at redshifts z 
2 and their stellar populations follow a slow passive evolution
since then eg van Dokkum  Franx 1996 Bender et al 1998
van Dokkum  Stanford 2003 Fritz et al 2005 Jrgensen et al
2006 However the cosmic formation epoch and evolutionary his-
tory of isolated eld galaxies remains unclear Indeed galaxy for-
mation models based on a hierarchical structure growth envision for
a given galaxy mass a dependence on environment Diaferio et al
2001 At a given redshift this environmental effect results in ex-
plicit age variations between ES0 galaxies in clusters and in
lowdensity regions where cluster ellipticals show an average
luminosityweighted age of 96 Gyr whereas eld ES0s being
by 4 Gyr younger and displaying a broader age spread than their
counterparts in clusters Cole et al 2000 In addition brighter and
hence more massive eld galaxies MB  201 should feature
on average 2 Gyr younger ages than fainter ones and comprise
more metal rich 005  FeH  01 dex populations than their
cluster representatives Thomas et al 2005 but no differences in
their element abundance ratios Fe
So far for the eld galaxy population inconsistent results
have been derived Some studies suggest an evolution simi-
lar to earlytype galaxies in clusters van Dokkum et al 2001a
Treu et al 2001 van de Ven et al 2003 van Dokkum  Ellis
2003 Ziegler et al 2005 but others prefer a faster mass assem-
bly over a shorter time period since z  1 Treu et al 2002
Gebhardt et al 2003 Recently Treu et al 2005 performed a
comprehensive investigation of early-type eld galaxies within the
GOODS-N eld and detected evidence for a mass dependent evo-
lution Similar results were derived by van der Wel et al 2005
and di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 from an analysis of eld ES0
galaxies in the CDFS However although these samples were
drawn from the same eld they rather found incomparable galaxy
sizes and velocity dispersions for individual objects see  6 for
more details Moreover the different target selection procedures
among the studies eg magnitude colour morphology might in-
duce some inconsistency in the nal sample for example selecting
galaxies with the reddest colours would favour the more massive
systems where variations are less pronounced or using low signal-
to-noise SN spectra limits the detection post-starburst galaxies
or the contamination by bulge-dominated spiral galaxies Further-
more difculties may arise from the small number statistics of
some works and the impact of cosmic variance remains yet to be
unknown and hard to distinguish from the used sample selection
eg van der Wel et al 2005 di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 but
see  6 There is clear evidence that the interpretations of mea-
surements are highly sensitive to selection effects and high-quality
spectroscopic data is stringent necessary to allow a careful analysis
of the properties of galaxies at high redshift
In the present work we aim to analyse in detail the assembly
history and the stellar populations of a carefully selected sample
of 24 early-type eld spheroidal galaxies down to MB  1930
in two deep sky surveys the FORS Deep Field and the William
Herschel Deep Field by using a combination of high signal-to-
noise VLT spectroscopy together with deep ground-based multi
band imaging and high-resolution space-based photometry Al-
though our study is restricted to small number statistics our data
is based on high-quality spectra providing both precise kinematic
and stellar population properties In a future work we are aiming
to disentangle both difculties of high redshift investigations re-
lated to small number statistics and cosmic variance A Fritz et al
2009a in preparation
The structure of this paper is as follows In section 2 the sam-
Field EarlyType Galaxies in the FDF and WHDF
Spectrophotometric types and estimated redshifts were se-
lected from the FDF photometric redshifts catalogue of more than
3800 objects Bender et al 2001 Only candidates with an early
ES0 model Spectral Energy Distribution SED were consid-
ered and the photometric redshifts were restricted to zphot  06
Based on the photometric redshifts the elliptical candidates were
spread out on different CCD positions among the spirals which
were observed for a similar project studying the TullyFisher re-
lation of latetype galaxies for each MOS setup in the observed
spectral wavelength range such that either the Mgb-feature pass-
band 0  5170 A or the G-band 0  4300 A was included
For a reliable stargalaxy separation targets with insignicant pho-
tometric redshift and large uncertainty ie zphot  dzphot  0
were discarded Field candidates were selected from a deep FORS2
I-band reference image consisting of 10 seeing averaged I-band
images between 047050 arcsec FWHM with a nal integration
time of 3000 sec and a Point-Spread-Function PSF of 049 arcsec
FWHM In case of the FORS1 observations the target selection
was based on a FORS1 I-band reference image with a PSF of
052 arcsec FWHM In the WHDF eld objects were drawn from a
deep over ve individual exposures averaged I-band reference im-
age with a total integration time of 1500 sec and a PSF of 06 arcsec
FWHM To avoid misclassications detections of the Source Ex-
tractor package SExtractor Bertin  Arnouts 1996 that exhibited
a star classication parameter star  09 and a  b  25 pixel
were most likely bonade stellar objects and were therefore re-
jected
Apart from photometric redshifts the target selection for the
WHDF eld early-type galaxies was performed with the same
constraints as for the FDF eld elliptical galaxies Redshifts of
eld early-type candidates were estimated using a combination of
colour-colour diagrams and apparent magnitudes Figure 1 illus-
trates the target selection of the WHDF eld elliptical candidates
in the B  RR  I colour-colour diagram The total WHDF
spectroscopic data and the actually observed WHDF eld ellip-
ticals are compared to evolutionary tracks for ES0 with differ-
ent formation redshifts of zf  2 solid line and zf  4 dot-
ted line as predicted by the passive evolution models for a sim-
ple single burst stellar population of Bruzual  Charlot 1 Note
that the BC96 models have been computed for a slightly differ-
ent cosmology with H0  60 km s1 Mpc1 and q0  01 In the
B RR I colour-colour diagram elliptical and spiral galax-
ies Bohm  Ziegler 2007 are well separated up to z  05 indi-
cated by the arrows and follow the predictions of the evolutionary
models quite well To avoid a selection of high redshift elliptical
galaxies with z  1 the apparent R magnitude was used as an
additional constraint Although the BC96 models represent more a
generalisation of the various stellar populations of early-type galax-
ies together with the cut in magnitude they provide a good sepa-
ration between high redshift interlopers and lower redshift galaxies
which we were interested in More complex model star formation
histories cf Gavazzi et al 2002 are beyond the scope of this pa-
per To allow a better estimate of the star formation histories of the
galaxies in our sample we will utilise absorption line indices and
other spectral diagnostics in a future work A Fritz et al 2009b in

2 SPECTROSCOPY
21 Sample Selection
Target objects were selected based upon deep U BgRI and BRI
multi-band imaging surveys of the FORS Deep Field FDF
Heidt et al 2003 and William Herschel Deep Field WHDF
Metcalfe et al 2001 respectively The 50 completeness limits
of the FDF and WHDF are B  277 and B  279 respec-
tively Early-type candidates were selected according to their i to-
tal apparent magnitude R  220m ii spectrophotometric type
iii elongated structureless appearance and iv photometric red-
shift only available for the FDF The constraint in the apparent
brightness ensured a sufcient signal-to-noise of SN 15 in the
absorption lines mandatory for a robust determination of velocity
dispersions and line-strengths measurements For this reason faint
early-type candidates with apparent magnitudes R  205m were
included in more than one MOS setup and the individual spectra
combined after data reduction

range in the colour-colour diagram of 2  B  R  29 and
07  R  I  11 have been selected as bonade eld ellipti-
cals and successfully veried One object ID 14 initially selected
as an early-type candidate with R  I  079 B  R  178
and R  1904m z  01060 is an intermediate-type Sc spiral
galaxy and was therefore discarded It turned out that this galaxy is
a spiral galaxy with a clearly visible disc on the ACS images which
were not available at the time of the target selection
22 Observations
Spectroscopic observations of the sample of eld early-type galax-
ies were performed simultaneously with those of the late-type
galaxies which were subject to the investigation of the evolu-
tion of the TullyFisher relation in the FDF Ziegler et al 2002
Bohm et al 2004 and in the WHDF Bohm  Ziegler 2007 As
the target selections and instrument congurations were very simi-
lar the two individual data sets are discussed in combination
Multi-object spectroscopy MOS was conducted at the Very
Large Telescope VLT using the FOcal Reducer and low dis-
persion Spectrograph 2 FORS2 Appenzeller et al 1998 instru-
ment in September and October 2000 July and October 2002 and
FORS1 in December 1999 and October 2001 During these ob-
servations a total of 220 galaxy spectra have been acquired un-
der mostly excellent seeing conditions Using the grism 600R with
the order separation lter GG43581 and slit width of 10 arcsec
resulted in spectral resolutions of R  1200 for the FDF ob-
servations For the WHDF run the volume phased holographic
grism 600RI was chosen which is even more efcient at red-
der wavelengths 8000 A than the grism 600R and has a reso-
lution of R  1000 Both versions of FORS instruments offer 19
slitlets in the MOS conguration 9 with slit lengths of 22 arcsec
8 with slit lengths of 20 arcsec whereas the uppermost and low-
ermost slits have lengths of  11 arcsec The total integration time
for each setup was 25 hours Seeing conditions ranged between
043 arcsec and 092 arcsec FWHM with a median of 076 arcsec
In order to limit the corrections of atmospheric absorption the air-
mass was constraint to A  20 FORS was operated at standard
resolution setup ie CCD read out in one-port mode In low gain
mode using port A FORS1 offers a gain of 351 eADU and a
read-out-noise RON of RON721 e resulting in a spatial scale
of 02 arcsecpixel for the FDF spectra After the FORS2 detec-
tor system upgrade which was available for science use in March
2002 the standard setup offers a gain of 070 eADU and RON
of 27 e The spatial sampling in the nal WHDF spectra was
025 arcsecpixel More details on the observations can be found in

ment angles of   15 between apparent major axis and slit ori-
entation cf Bohm  Ziegler 2007 Each setup was splitted into
three single exposures of 3000 sec with a total integration time of
25 hours and typically comprised 23 early-type candidates Two
additional objects one in setup 4 and one in setup 1 fell by coin-
cidence into a slit of a target galaxy One object ID 810b turned
out to be a eld S0 galaxy at z  02118 The other object is a
background spiral galaxy at z  05569 and thus was discarded
Therefore the total sample of WHDF elliptical galaxies comprises
eleven eld early-type galaxies
23 Spectroscopic Analysis
231 Data Reduction
Image reduction followed the standard procedure of overscan sub-
traction atelding sky background subtraction and wavelength
calibration as described in Fritz et al 2005 and Fritz 2006 Be-
cause spectra particularly near to the edges of the MOS frame ex-
hibited spatial distortions images of each individual slitlet were
extracted from the full frame after bias subtraction allowing the
typical two-dimensional image reduction of long-slit spectroscopy
The night sky background was subtracted by iteratively tting each
CCD column separately using a polynomial t of rst or zero or-
der During the wavelength calibration for the dispersion relation
typical rms values of 004 A at a dispersion of 162 Apixel were
achieved After the wavelength calibration spectra of the respective

region is affected by the telluric line at   6367 A and was masked out
during the t The upper lower abscissa displays the spectrum in observed
rest-frame wavelength units the inset shows the derived quantities
exposures were summed up and the spectral rows corresponding to
the full-width at half maximum FWHM of an object were aver-
aged along the dispersion direction using a Horne-based algorithm
Horne 1986 We also compared this method to a different slit ex-
traction technique using equal-weight extractions which yielded to
the same velocity dispersion measurements within their uncertain-
ties Fritz 2006 In those cases where a galaxy was observed in two
different MOS setups the wavelength ranges covered did not match
each other exactly leading to varying nal count rates at different
wavelengths
232 Velocity Dispersions
Internal velocity dispersions  and radial velocities vrad of the
galaxies were computed using an updated version of the Fourier
Correlation Quotient FCQ method Bender 1990 as described
in Fritz et al 2005 and Ziegler et al 2005 A brief summary fol-
lows The algorithm is based on the deconvolution of the peak of
the template-galaxy correlation function with the peak of the au-
tocorrelation function of a template star In comparison to other
procedures Sargent et al 1977 Tonry  Davis 1979 the main
advantages of the FCQ method are the possibility to a posteri-
ori chose the most appropriate function to approximate the Line-
Of-Sight-Velocity-Distribution LOSVD a very high robustness
against template mismatch and a high insensitivity due to metallic-
ity differences in the spectra For sufcient high SN spectra of 10
per pixel even velocity dispersions of 05  i with i being the
instrumental resolution can be determined with a high degree of
accuracy For each galaxy  and vrad were measured around the
spectral wavelength range of the G4300-band hereafter G-band
the Mgb and the H feature in Fourier space by convolving a tem-
plate spectrum with a Gaussian to match the width of absorption
lines in the observed galaxy spectrum of interest Spectral regions
that suffered from strong night sky emission lines sky subtraction
residuals defects or the A- or B-band absorption caused from the
terrestrial atmosphere were carefully masked out during the tting
process In 10 out of 24 cases at least two different wavelength
regimes could be analysed For all early-type galaxy candidates
the signal-to-noise in the spectra was sufcient to yield very sta-

and WHDF The median redshift of the total eld earlytype galaxy sample
is hzi  040 and is indicated with an arrow Earlytype galaxies within
the FDF that were spectroscopically conrmed to be members of a cluster
at z  034 are also shown Note that these cluster galaxies are not entering
our eld sample
ble stellar velocity dispersion measurements see Appendix  A for
a discussion Deviations in  from template to template are small
and ranged from 2 to 20 km s1 Since only one good template
star SAO 162947 was available that was observed under the same
FORS instrumental congurations as the galaxies three more K gi-
ant stars SAO 32042 SAO 80333  SAO 98087 were used which
had been observed with MOSCA at the 35m-telescope at the Calar
Alto observatory Fritz 2006 A Fritz et al 2009c in preparation
These templates have sufciently resolved spectra with instrumen-
tal resolution of   55 km s1 around Mgb and   69 km s1
around the G-band
To determine the instrumental resolution of the galaxy spectra
the widths of 1214 unblended and not-saturated HgArNe emis-
sion lines of the respective wavelength calibration frames were
measured at wavelengths corresponding to Mgb and the G-band
separately In case of the FDF observations the HgCd lamp has
been used additionally to the He Ar and Ne lamps to warrant bet-
ter efciency in the blue wavelength range which is particularly
neccessary for the higher redshift spiral galaxies Typical instru-
mental resolutions for the observed spectra fall in the range of
i  85  100 km s1 To ensure a reliable error treatment for the
velocity dispersions and radial velocity measurements and to de-
rived the signal-to-noise of each galaxy spectra Monte-Carlo simu-
lations for different stellar templates over a range of input  and
SN ratios were performed Fritz 2006 For SN  8 per A
the velocity dispersions are systematically underestimated on aver-
age by 4 but for SN8 per A the effect becomes negligible To
check the reliablility and accuracy of our velocity dispersion mea-
surements serveral independent tests have been performed These
verications are presented in  A of the Appendix
An example of the velocity dispersion measurement for a
eld elliptical galaxy in the WHDF with typical SN spectrum at
z  02599 is given in Figure 2 Several template star spectra were
smoothed to the same resolution as the galaxy spectrum to derive
 The velocity dispersion for this galaxy is f  128  8 km s1
derived within the extracted spectral region around the Mgb fea-
ture with a signal-to-noise level of SN  57 A1 see Figure 2
In this case the nal f was averaged over three individual mea-
surements 1  127  8 km s1 2  134  8 km s1 and

sions ap were aperture corrected as   115004ap similar
to Jrgensen et al 1995 but adopting a slope of -006 to yield cen-
tral velocity dispersions within a circular aperture of radius Re8
For each galaxy its aperture during the observations was individu-
ally computed using the slit width the number of extracted rows

conrmed eld earlytype galaxies detected within the FDF and
WHDF Earlytype galaxies in the FDF that were spectroscopically
identied to be members of a cluster at z  033 see next para-
graph are indicated as well The VLT spectra of these cluster ES0
candidates are of similar high quality to the spectra obtained for
the eld galaxies The 13 eld ES0 galaxies in the FDF encom-
pass a range in redshifts of 022  zFDF  065 with a mean of
zFDF  042  011 hzFDFi  041 and the 11 eld galaxies
in the WHDF cover a redshift space of 021  zWHDF  074
with a mean of zWHDF  036  016 hzWHDFi  040 The
total eld sample of 24 ES0 galaxies exhibits a mean redshift of
z  039  014 and a median of hzi  040
It turned out that the southwestern corner of the FDF most
probably covers the outskirts of a galaxy cluster at z  0335 
0002 Ziegler et al 2005 Based on the radial velocity measure-
ments for the elliptical galaxy candidates in the FDF the lower limit
for the velocity dispersion of the cluster is c  430 km s1 which
is most likely only a lower limit as the cluster centre is not located
on the FDF but only its outskirts Allowing for a spread in redshift
space of z  004 which corresponds to  6 times the typical
velocity dispersion of a rich galaxy cluster c  103 km s1 it
is found that a total of 13 spiral galaxies and 15 early-type galaxies
based on their spectroscopic redshifts are likely to be members of
this cluster This is also visible through a small break in redshift
space at z  03 for the 341 galaxies at 01  z  5 144 with
z  11 of the total spectroscopic catalog Noll et al 2004
The spatial distribution of all early-type eld galaxies in the
FDF is shown in Figure 4 Potential cluster members are addition-
ally denoted by squares Adding the possible spiral cluster candi-
dates it is suggestive that the cluster has an elongated shape If the
center indeed is positioned to the southwestern corner of the FDF
the distribution of the galaxies will be a striking example of the
morphologydensity relation Dressler 1980 with the earlytype
galaxies mainly populating the dense inner region and the late
type galaxies located at larger clustercentric radii Unfortunately at
a redshift of z  033 the Mg 5170 absorption line is strongly af-
fected due to the terrestrial absorption of the B band which makes
an accurate measurement of the internal galaxy velocity dispersions
impossible For this reason early-type galaxies which are possible
members of a cluster at z  033 will be discarded from the further
analysis Nevertheless these ES0 cluster galaxies will be used as
a reference for comparison reasons at a later stage see  5 The co-
ordinates redshifts and rest-frame B  I colours of the cluster
galaxies are presented in Table 4
Figure 5 illustrates the spatial distribution of the early-type
eld galaxies in the WHDF Apart from three galaxies which are
located in the northern part of the image all eld ellipticals are
homogenously distributed over the entire eld To test for possi-
ble group candidates radial velocity measurements of the three
galaxies close in projection resulted in a dispersion in radial ve-
locities of vrad  450 km s1and a group velocity dispersion
of grp  19063
71 km s1at z  02125 Looking at the individ-
ual ACS galaxy images these objects are not visually associated to

234 Spectroscopic Star Formation Signatures
To estimate the amount of recent star formation present in our eld
galaxies we measure the spectral diagnostic features of O II 3727
and HA4101 in the observed wavelength range of the spectra
For the indices O II 3727 and HA4101 we adopt the pass-
band denitions by Balogh et al 1997 and Worthey  Ottaviani
1997 respectively Uncertainties in the line index measurements
account for poisson noise as well as possible noise variations in the
spectra In the subsequent analysis we always refer to rest-frame
equivalent widths in units of A The spectroscopic measurements
of our galaxies will further be discussed in  52 where the im-
plications of the recent activity signatures on the stellar population
properties will be assessed
3 PHOTOMETRY
31 HSTACS Observations
Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys ACS Wide Field Chan-
nel WFC Hubble Space Telescope HST observations of the
FORS and William Herschel Deep Fields were carried out dur-
ing cycles 11 and 12 To cover the  7  7 arcmin2 sky areas
of the FDF and WHDF four WFC pointings were aligned as a
2  2 mosaic A single ACS WFC chip offers a eldofview
of  202  202 arcsec2 and a pixel scale of 0049 arcsec Each
pointing was split into two exposures and has a total exposure time
of 2360 s FDF and 2450 s WHDF through the F814W I l-
ter Table 6 gives an overview of the HSTACS observations of the
FDF and WHDF The column Ttot represents the total exposure
time for each object and Mlim lists the 50 completeness limit for
3 detections of extended sources within the two deep elds Data
reduction was performed using the standard CALACS 2 pipeline
and the unprocessed images including bias and dark subtraction
atelding distortion and astrometric correction were used for
an additional cosmic ray rejection ltering by combining the two
exposures of each visit to produce the nal mosaic
32 Surface Photometry
Structural parameters of half-light effective Re radii effective
surface brightnesses hei within Re and total magnitudes and
shapes of the galaxies were derived with the GALFIT package
Peng et al 2002 For the convolution of the surface brightness
2 httpwwwstscieduhstacsanalysis
model proles an average PSF was constructed using  20 unsatu-
rated stars with I814  23 which were normalized to the same cen-
tral ux and afterwards medianaveraged Two-dimensional sur-
face brightness proles of the galaxies were analysed with four dif-
ferent tting functions by a pure classical de Vaucouleurs r14 a
pure Sersic 1968 with variable Sersic exponent n 1  n  4
and each of those proles in combination with an exponential
disc component The best t to the observed light distribution of
a galaxy was assessed by comparing the residual images and re-
duced 2 values Note that by denition a prole consisting of a
Sersic plus disc component results in lower 2 numbers than using
a single r14 model alone Therefore preference was given to those
model proles with yielded to the lowest residual structures in the
residual images In 40 of the cases this was a pure classical de
Vaucouleurs prole in 60 of the cases this was a Sersic plus disc
component Figure 6 presents examples of the results of the sur-
face brightness modelling for our eld galaxies For each galaxy
the original image the best 2D model t and the residuals from an
r14 or r1n exponential disc component are shown For internal
consistency the surface brightness distribution of the eld galax-
ies were also modelled with the GIM2D package by Simard et al
2002 and the algorithm by Saglia et al 1997 A detailed dis-
cussion on differences between these techniques can be found in
Fritz et al 2005 and Ziegler et al 2005 Total magnitudes de-
rived with all three methods agree well within the errors as well as
with those values measured on the ground-based I-band images of
the FDF and WHDF with the SExtractor package Observed mag-
nitudes of the galaxies were calibrated on to the Vega system using
the the synthetic transformation by Sirianni et al 2005
TMAG  25logDNs1c0c1TCOLc2TCOL2 1
where the rst term is the observed magnitude expressed as total
count rate per electrons and seconds in the source system TMAG
and TCOL being the observed magnitude in the target system and
the c0 c1 and c2 the transformation coefcients We adopt our
R  I aperture colors and for the coefcients c0  25478
c1  0042 and c2  0012 For the FDF and WHDF a galac-
tic absorption of EB  V   0018m and EB  V   0025m
was derived respectively Aperture colours were measured on the
ground-based U BgRI and BRI band photometry within a 2 di-
ameter aperture
33 Morphologies
Galaxy morphologies were classied using a combination between
a visual inspection by one of us AF the results of the surface
brightness prole analysis ie interpreting the residuals from the
r14 luminosity prole tting and an independent analysis using
GIM2D see Fritz et al 2005 for a description The information
of all three independent approaches was combined to yield the best
and most reliable decision on the nal morphologies of the galax-
ies Figure 7 and Figure 8 display HSTACS thumbnail images in
the F814W lter of the FDF and WHDF eld early-type galaxies

worthy remarks of special features for the individual galaxies The
rst column of each table shows the galaxy ID the second indi-
cates the galaxy morphology and the last column gives additional
information about special features to the respective galaxy In to-
tal the sample is divided into 13 eld ellipticals E and ES0 and
nine eld lenticulars S0 to Sa bulges The two classes comprise
the sub-types of 6 E 1 ES0 3 S0 and 2 Sa bulges in the FDF

34 Spectrophotometric Properties
k-corrections were calculated by convolving respective lter trans-
mission curves with the redshifted Spectral Energy Distribution
SED of an early-type galaxy template from Kinney et al 1996
as described in Fritz et al 2005 and Fritz 2006 No separation
between elliptical and S0 types was done because both exhibit sim-
ilar optical and UV spectral shapes Balmer discontinuities 4000
A and absorption features for   5000 A which are indistin-
guishable from their broadband optical and near-infrared colours
For internal consistency synthetic spectral SED templates of an
12 Gyr elliptical galaxy which were generated through evolution-
ary synthesis modelling by Moller et al 2001 were also utilised
Typical deviations in the k-corrections between the SEDs of the
two template libraries are small kB  01m Depending on the
redshift of the object the most suitable lter was chosen to trans-
form to rest-frame Johnson B-band The Bfors lter was selected
for galaxies in the FDF with z  025 gfors for 025  z  055
and Rfors for 055  z  07 For eld objects in the WHDF
with z  025 a transformation to B rest-frame was conducted
based on the B passband and for 055  z  075 the RC lter
was utilised Therefore the k-correction was much less sensitive
to spectral type than using a global lter transformation that is re-
stricted to a specic lter eg of Bobs  Brest For reasons of
consistency the rest-frame magnitudes were checked by transform-
ing the observed F814W-magnitudes into rest-frame Johnson-B
Deviations between magnitudes were small differences were less
than their errors Total errors on the absolute B-band magnitudes
for the galaxies were computed as the quadratic sum of individual
errors in the respective ground-based photometry lter either B R

the FDF and WHDF the photometric errors in the ground-based

tivity in our early-type galaxy sample we checked the archive for
possible X-ray counterparts of our eld galaxies In the selection

was that the eld had to be devoid of strong radio and X-ray sources
to avoid potentially present galaxy clusters at medium redshifts
The Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories have not observed
the sky region covered by the FDF therefore we cannot look for
the presence of possible active galactic nuclei AGNs in these eld
galaxies
For the WHDF two Chandra surveys are available PI T
Shanks PID 02900499 A deep high resolution ACIS-I imag-
ing survey 7213 ksec of the central eld and a shallow survey
10 elds with exposure times of 10 ksec each with the ACIS-
S around narrow line galaxies that have previously been detected
by ROSAT The ACIS-I covers the spectral range between 02 to
10 keV and has a spatial resolution of 0492 or better with
PSF variations less than 02 across the total 169169 eld-
of-view Weisskopf et al 2002 Through a cross-correlation with
our optical photometry we identied 28 objects as X-ray point-
sources above a 2 source detection limit 95 condence level
The detected counts for each source were converted into uxes
assuming a power law of the photon spectral ux distribution
of dNdE  E with an intrinsic photon index of   2
and column density of the galactic absorption of nH  10 
1021 cm2 A photon index of   2 is typical for X-ray emis-
sion that has its origin from star formation The on-axis sensi-
tivity limits of the unabsorbed ux in the soft 05  20 keV
and hard 20  80 keV bands are 7516 ergs cm2 s1 and
1915 ergs cm2 s1 respectively These uxes correspond to a
detection limit in X-ray luminosities emitted in the soft band of
LX 05  20 kev  19  1042 ergs s1 and in the hard band of
LX 2080 kev  471042 ergs s1 The Chandra exposures
are deep enough to both fully resolve the X-ray background XRB
at about 1515 ergs cm2 s1 in the 20  70 keV energy band
and detecting all the hard X-ray sources within the WHDF
Very recently a shallow XMM-Newton survey PI M
Guainazzi PID 0407030101 targeted a similar sky region 2791
ksec However these observations cover only the southern part
of the WHDF and are at a signicantly coarser angular resolu-
tion of 15than the Chandra detections Using the same pho-
ton spectral ux distribution conguration as above the sensitiv-
ity limits of the unabsorbed ux in the 05  20 keV energy
band are 9315 ergs cm2 s1 and in the 20  80 keV range
2614 ergs cm2 s1 The soft and the hard uxes correspond to
detection limits of LX 05  20 kev  23  1043 ergs s1 and
LX 2080 kev  651043 ergs s1 Figure 10 shows the dis-
tribution of Chandra and XMM-Newton detections in the WHDF

z  00473 and ID 635 at z  00709 no maximum rotation ve-
locity Vmax could be derived for both objects four eld early-type
galaxies might have associated X-ray counterparts These objects
in the WHDF with possible Chandra andor XMM counterparts are
listed in Table 9 There is only one rather likely candidate for a
galaxy with a central AGN ID 437 as this object shows also weak
O II emission In case of the other candidates either bright ID 173
or bright and extended ID 92 or 158 XMM sources close to the
galaxies are found that might be associated to the optical counter-
parts Non of the early-type galaxies in our sample is surrounded
by a diffuse halo-gas thus no object appears to be an extended X-
ray source hence the inuence of AGN activity for our galaxies is
small or even negligible We will discuss the possible impact of X-
ray detections together with our results in section 71 In Appendix
 B we assess in more detail contributions due to low-luminosity
AGN LLAGN andor emission from soft diffuse X-ray plasma or
or low-mass X-ray binaries LMXBs in case of our galaxies
4 SCALING RELATIONS OF FIELD EARLYTYPE
GALAXIES AT Z04
41 The Local Reference
To derive the kinematic andor the spectrophotometric evolution
of early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift it is crucial to
carefully select a sample of early-type galaxies at low redshift
which can be utilised as a reference for the purpose of compar-
ison The Coma cluster at z  0024 is one of the best stud-
ied local rich clusters of galaxies and represents with a look
back time of only 03 Gyr corresponding to 2 of the age
of the Universe the present-day Universe A number of previous
works in the literature on both cluster and eld early-type galax-
ies eg van Dokkum  Franx 1996 Treu et al 2001 2002 2005
van de Ven et al 2003 Jrgensen et al 2006 used this cluster for
the purpose of comparison of the Fundamental Plane at z  01
and it therefore provides a reliable and widely accepted local refer-
ence when addressing evolutionary questions
In order to minimise systematic uncertainties arising from l-
ter transformations distance determinations and selection effects
we utilise the well dened Coma sample in the Johnson B-band
by Saglia Bender  Dressler 1993 hereafter SBD93 which com-
prises 39 early-type cluster galaxies splitted into 25 E and 14
S0s This data compilation is a subset of the original 7 Samu-
rai sample Faber et al 1989 which contains 59 ES0 galaxies
in the Virgo and Coma cluster but for the latter no morphologi-
cal information is available For deriving the evolution of the ML
with redshift we use the FP coefcients as published by Faber et al
1989
42 The FaberJackson Relation
Early-type galaxies follow a scaling relation between their lumi-
nosity and internal velocity dispersion also known as the Faber
Jackson relation Faber  Jackson 1976 The relationship can be
used to constrain the formation and evolution of ES0 galaxies but
it requires accurate velocity dispersion measurements as small un-
certainties in the kinematics transfer into large errors in the magni-
tudes hence the measured luminosity evolution
Figure 11 shows the FaberJackson relation FJR in the B-
band for the eld early-type galaxies in the FDF and WHDF com-
pared to the local Coma sample by SBD93 For this scaling re-
lation galaxy magnitudes were measured with SExtractor on the
deep ground-based images with 060 arcsec FWHM in the I-
band hence the whole eld sample can be considered As the me-
dian uncertainty in our velocity dispersion measurements is only
15 km s1and our magnitude limit reaches MB  1930 about
one magnitude fainter than previous studies we can put reliable
implications on the evolution of our distant eld galaxies using the
FJR A linear 2-t to the restricted Coma reference sample yields
MB  122 log   831
which is indicated as a dashed line in Figure 11 Assuming that
the local slope holds valid for our distant galaxies ie there is not
evolution in the slope of the FJR we analyse the mean residuals
from the local FJR shown as the solid line in Figure 11 Because
of the on average younger light-averaged ages of the stellar pop-
ulations in the distant galaxies for a given velocity dispersion the
eld galaxies are on average brighter by MB  065  016

tion of hMK i  059 mag for the distant galaxies with respect to the
local reference is found indicated by the solid line An unconstrained 2-t
to the distant sample is shown by the dot-dashed line
galaxies is r  072m The two objects that are slightly off-
set from the rest of the distant eld galaxies show both signs of
star formation one of them being also the galaxy with the high-
est redshift in our sample cf  52 The measured evolution is
in very good agreement with a slow passive evolution of the stel-
lar populations as suggested by single-burst simple stellar popu-
lations models with a high formation redshift of the bulk of the
stars Bruzual  Charlot 2003 For formation redshift of zf  2
these evolution models predict an average increase in the Johnson
B-band of 061  006 mag at z  04 Similar as for local stud-
ies our distant galaxies show weak evidence for a larger scatter
at fainter luminosities MB  2040 that might be indications
for an evolution of slope in the FJR We interpret this effect as a
stronger evolution of the lower-mass galaxies However apart form
the mass dependence an additional small contribution to the offset
of lower-luminosity galaxies might be the result of a weak depen-
dence of the velocity dispersion on luminosity of the early-type
galaxies that was previously found within a large sample of early-
type galaxies drawn from Data Release 4 of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey SDSS Desroches et al 2007 This luminosity dependence
becomes detectable in all FP projections and is most pronounced
for faint galaxies in the SDSS around Mr  212 which corre-
sponds to about MB  202 At MB  203 our eld distant
galaxies show a diversity half of the sample indicates a strong lu-
minosity evolution whereas the other half a mild evolutionary trend
An un-constrained linear 2-t to our eld galaxy sample yields
MBz  04  493 log   699
However our sample is too small and the dependence on luminosity
too weak to test possible luminosity effects on the slope of the FJR
at z  04 in greater detail
To verify our results and to test the underlying stellar popu-
lations in even more detail we converted the extinction-corrected
B  R restframe colors of the eld galaxies in our sample
into ML ratios in the K-band following a similar approach as in
Bell  de Jong 2001 Absolute K-band magnitudes were derived
by using the synthetic stellar population models by Moller et al
2001 The FJR in the K-band for the eld ES0 galaxies in the
FDF and WHDF is presented in Figure 12 The early-type galaxies
are compared to the local relationship of cluster early-type galax-
ies as found by Pahre 1999 For a given velocity dispersion the
luminosities of the distant eld galaxies excluding ID 111 at z 
07418 are on average brighter by MK  068  021 mag
median hMKi  059 mag than their local representatives
The moderate luminosity evolution found for the eld ES0 is in
excellent agreement to the ndings derived using the B-band mag-
nitudes Less-massive galaxies display a larger offset with respect
to the local relationship conrming the faster evolution of less-
massive galaxies in the B-band Furthermore lower-luminosity
mass galaxies show a faster evolution in luminosity than higher-
luminosity mass galaxies This point will be addressed in greater
detail in  5
43 The Kormendy Relation
To study the change of surface brightness evolution for the FP sam-
ple at a xed size the magnitudesize relation was constructed
The Kormendy relation KR represents the projection of the Fun-
damental Plane along the velocity dispersion onto the photometric
plane As only the structural parameters are used samples have
larger scatter in the KR than in the FP but results should comple-
ment and endorse ndings obtained with the FP
The KR of the eld galaxies is presented in Figure 13 For
a given size the surface brightnesses of the distant eld galaxies
excluding the Sa ID 508 are on average brighter by e B 
A Fritz A Bohm and B L Ziegler

and WHDF compared to the Coma galaxies of SBD93 in rest-frame B-
band The dashed line shows the 2-t to the local KR by SBD93 The
average evolution of the distant eld galaxies with its scatter with respect to
the local galaxies is shown by the solid and dotted lines respectively
040  039 mag arcsec2 median heiB  051 mag
arcsec2 One object ID 508 that does not follow the KR is a
spiral galaxy has a high surface brightness and also shows pos-
sible signs of rotational support in its two-dimensional spectrum
cf  44 We conrm the power of the KR to separate passive
quiescent galaxies from galaxies with blue colors as found by
Ferreras et al 2005 In consistency with passive evolution mod-
els the fading of the stellar populations implies that the galaxies
will evolve to brighter surface brightnesses with increasing redshift
hence moving away from the local KR of present day early-type
galaxies
There are no indications of an evolution in the sizes of our
eld galaxies see Figure 13 We emphasise that it is hard to sep-
arate an evolution in the size of the galaxies from an evolution
in the surface brightness as the photometric parameters of half-
light radius and surface brightness are correlated and enter the FP
and its projections in combination as F Pphot   e  log Re
with   0328 eg Saglia et al 1997 Fritz et al 2005 The
measurements and results derived for the KR depend critically on
the selection procedures applied to the sample galaxies For exam-
ple two studies targeting the same sky region obtained inconsis-
tent results di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 claims an evolution in
the size of galaxies in the CDFS whereas van der Wel et al 2005
does not support this nding Most likely this effect is due to dif-
ferences or constraints set in the selection process where the for-
mer primarily selected fainter objects whereas the latter observed
a more homogenous population of early-type galaxies In case of
the low-mass galaxies a differential evolution can be produced by
a combined effect of large spectroscopic apertures and substantial
rotational support in the target objects In particular the combi-
nation of the large slit-apertures with low SN galaxy spectra by
di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 can cause miss-classications of
spirals with unresolved possible rotational support as detectable in
the emission lines This effect points to a bias in the selection proce-
dure A further discussion on possible selection effects is presented
in  6
44 The Fundamental Plane
Early-type galaxies in the nearby Universe follow a tight funda-
mental relationship which is dened by their basic observables as
log Re   log    log Ie  
where Re is the effective half-light radius given in kpc  de-
notes the internal velocity dispersion in km s1and Ie is the surface
brightness in mag arcsec2 related to hei as log Ie  04hei 
For the FP coefcients we performed a principal component anal-
ysis and derived for the slopes and the intercept   125  
082 and   90 which are in good agreement with the FP
coefcients by SBD93 Jrgensen et al 1996 From the sample
of eld galaxies of Faber et al 1989 we measured that the inter-
cept of the FP is offset by    004 from the relation as given in
equation 4
Figure 14 shows the FP for the 21 early-type eld galaxies in
the FDF and WHDF in the rest-frame Johnson B-band compared
to the 39 early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster by SBD93 The
local reference is indicated with small squares whereas the distant
eld galaxies are shown as the large circles and stars Filled sym-
bols denote ellipticals open symbols S0 galaxies and Sa bulges
The 21 FDF and WHDF earlytype eld galaxies are morpholog-
ically classied into 9 E and 12 S0 Five ellipticals and six S0s
originate from the FDF and four Es and six S0s are located in the
WHDF Two galaxies are not visible on the ACS images and for
one elliptical galaxy in the FDF no structural parameters could be
derived The distant eld galaxies cover a redshift range of 021 
zField E  074 with a median of hzField Ei  040 Two outliers
in the FP ID 6336 log Re  046 and ID 508 log Re  120
reveal on the ACS images a signicant disc component and early
spiral morphology Galaxy ID 6336 has an extraordinary strong
HF absorption which points to a young luminosity-weighted aver-
age model age under assumption of a single stellar population On
the ACS images ID 508 shows a peculiar structure which might
indicate that this object is an ongoing merger Both galaxies were
classied as Sa bulges hence these early-type spirals offer at least
a low level of star formation which increases their total luminosity
and displaces their position beyond the tight plane as established
by earlytype galaxies
Rejecting the two outliers for the total sample of 19 early-type
eld galaxies in the FDF and WHDF an average luminosity evolu-
tion of MB  053  013m with a median of hMBi 
039 is found Similar results are measured for 17 cluster ellipti-
cals at hzi  04 Ziegler et al 2005 Fritz et al 2006 with similar
look-back times 5 Gyr which show an average brightening of
their stellar populations of MB  044  018m compared to
their local counterparts Overall the distribution along the FP and
the measured luminosity evolution is similar for cluster and eld
galaxies at hzi  04 and within the cluster sample no differences
between ellipticals and S0 galaxies were found However the sam-
ple of distant cluster galaxies lacks galaxies with small sizes and
has a magnitude limit of MB  2050 whereas the eld galaxy
sample comprises no ellipticals with large sizes ie cD galaxies
and is more than one magnitude fainter MB  1930 A com-
parison of the sizes and luminosities of these two data sets is there-
fore not adequate and would cause misleading results Table 10

galaxies

ative bootstrap resampling of the data points 100 times Fritz et al
2005 Limiting the S0 galaxies to redshifts z  07 and rejecting
the two Sa bulges the same results are derived see Table 10 In
addition the eld ellipticals obey a tight FP with a small 1 scatter
of 0121 whereas the S0 types have a larger dispersion of 0219
omitting the two Sa bulges This gives further evidence that the
lenticular galaxies have a larger range of different stellar popula-

minosity at MB  21404 no strong variations in the amount
of evolution between the subsamples are detected However the
comparisons rely on the assumed cutoffs in  and MB because out-
liers such as early Sa spiral galaxies can strongly inuence the de-
rived luminosity evolution In the next section possible differences
between the stellar populations of elliptical and lenticular galaxies
will be addressed
45 Galaxy Types Ellipticals versus Lenticulars
Looking at differences between the morphological types of eld
early-type galaxies the S0 galaxies display a stronger evolution
than the elliptical galaxies Assuming that the slope of the local
A Fritz A Bohm and B L Ziegler
galaxies was also found for cluster early-type galaxies at z  02
Fritz et al 2005 which are in agreement with a low formation
redshift 1  zform  2 As the slope of the ML  M rela-
tion for these distant cluster galaxies is steeper than those for the
Coma cluster galaxies this can be interpreted as a dependence of
the evolution on galaxy mass and hence a downsizing effect in the
evolution of these galaxies
The evolution of the FP for the early-type FDF and WHDF
eld galaxies in the rest-frame Johnson B-band is illustrated in Fig-
ure 14 Early-type galaxies were binned in redshift space to inves-
tigate their location within and along the edge-on FP as a function
of redshift and to test the effects of possible outliers Ellipticals are
represented as lled S0s and Sa bulges as open symbols For each
morphological type the number of galaxies within a redshift bin is
indicated in the brackets Small squares denote the Coma galaxies
and the straight line is a principal component t to the local sam-
ple Ziegler et al 2005 Figure 14 clearly shows the evolution of
the FP for the distant galaxies with respect to the local Coma FP
The offsets of the distant eld galaxies increase with redshift but
the scatter appears to be mainly amplied for lenticular galaxies
The two galaxies with a positive evolution in the last two pan-
els are the Sa bulges ID 6336 and ID 508 and show a clear disc
on the ACS images These objects can mimic on average a weaker
evolution in luminosity for the whole galaxy population cf Ta-
ble 10 Regardless of the Sa bulges the S0s exhibit a larger scatter
at higher redshift 026  z  075 than the ellipticals which sug-
gests that the stellar populations of E and S0 types are different and
that lenticulars are a more heterogeneous group An explanation
could be that these S0 galaxies resemble poststarburst galaxies as
no strong emission lines were detected in their spectra This state-
ment will be further addressed in  52
5 STELLAR POPULATION AGES
51 Constraints on the Formation Epoch of Early-Type
Galaxies
The observed evolution of the ML ratio as derived from the FP de-
pends on the age of the stellar population of the galaxies In general
the luminosity of a young stellar population becomes rapidly fainter
when the massive and bright stars which have a short lifetime dis-
appear For an old population comprising mainly low mass stars
the dimming of the luminosity proceeds on a more gradual evolu-
tionary path As a consequence of this a stellar population formed
at lower redshift will evolve faster than one generated at high red-
shift In the following the observed evolution of the ML ratio will
be compared to simple stellar population models of a single burst
formed at redshift zform The models have been generated follow-
ing the description of the analytic models by van Dokkum  Franx
2001b
The luminosity evolution of a single-age stellar population can
be described by a power law as
t  tform 
where tform is the stellar formation time which corresponds to a
formation redshift of zform eg Tinsley 1980 The coefcient 
depends on the IMF the metallicity and the chosen passband in
which the luminosity is measured In the stellar population models
by Bruzual  Charlot 2003 a normal IMF with Salpeter 1955
slope solar metallicity and B  096 for the restframe B-band
was adopted Model predictions are shown in Figures 15 to 16 for
the eld elliptical and S0 galaxies in the restframe B-band Note
that the predicted evolution of the models is independent of H0 as
the age dependence of the ML ratio is a power law Two different
model tracks for a single stellar population with formation redshift
zform  1 lower line and zform  2 upper line are indicated as
the dotted lines in Figures 15 to 16
To assess the evolution of the stellar populations in the early
type galaxies the evolution of the FP zero-point  for the distant
galaxies can be directly converted into an evolution of the average
ML ratio as
hlogMLi  
hi
where the average evolution of logML was derived via the av-
erage zero-point offset of the distant FP hi from the local Coma
FP Treu et al 2001
In a recent study of 27 eld earlytype galaxies between
06  z  115 a massdependent evolution was found
van der Wel et al 2005 This sample of highredshift galaxies
showed that the evolution of lowmass eld galaxies with a charac-
teristic mass of M  21011M is faster than their more massive
counterparts Similar results have been drawn from eld earlytype
galaxies at z  1 from the GOODS-N sky region Treu et al 2005
and from the K20 survey di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 The 21
eld earlytype galaxies in our sample are located at a lower red-
shift range of 02  z  075 But it is very interesting if already
at a lookback time of 5 Gyr a possible evidence for a mass
dependent evolution or at least a trend with galaxy mass can be
detected For this reason the average evolution of the ML ratio
of the eld elliptical and S0 galaxies in the FDF and WHDF was
derived
Figure 15 displays the average evolution of the ML ratios for
the eld galaxies in the restframe B-band compared to the early
type cluster galaxies taken from van Dokkum  Stanford 2003
For a compilation of massive earlytype galaxies with M  2 
1011M in rich clusters of galaxies taken from the literature these
authors deduced an average formation redshift of zform  3 which
is indicated as the solid line All calculated model tracks are forced
to go through the average ML ratio of the eld galaxies at z 
002 by Faber et al 1989 shown as the small dot in Figures 15
and 16 The eld FDF and WHDF sample was splitted according
to the characteristic mass at M  2  1011M which gives 13
lowermass and 8 highermass galaxies The average evolution of
the highermass eld galaxies is h lnMLBi  031  006
at a redshift of hzi  044 Lowermass galaxies indicate on av-
erage a stronger evolution of h lnMLBi  054  007 at
hzi  038 The slight deviation in the redshift is solely due to the
not uniform number of galaxies in each subsample Massive eld
galaxies are in compliance with a slow evolution as derived for the
massive cluster galaxies and a high formation redshift for the bulk
of the stars of zform  3 In contrast lessmassive eld galaxies in
the FDF and WHDF with M  2  1011M evolve faster and fol-
low an evolutionary track between 1  zform  2 which is similar
to the lessmassive cluster galaxies from van Dokkum  Stanford
2003 which is indicated as the open square in Figure 15 This re-
sult gives evidence that already at a lookback time of 5 Gyr dif-
ferences in the measured ML evolution for the FDF and WHDF
eld galaxies can be revealed
To translate the evolution in the ML ratios into a specic
formation redshift zform for the eld galaxies the evolution of the
ML ratios for the individual eld earlytype galaxies are investi-
gated Figure 16 illustrates the offset from the local FP in the rest

ML ratio of the eld galaxies at z  002 by Faber et al 1989
indicated as the small black dot The evolution of cluster galaxies
with masses M  2  1011M can be best approximated as-
suming a formation redshift of zform  3 which is denoted as the
solid line in Figure 16 For our eld early-type galaxies we mea-
sure an evolution of  lnMLB  171  018 z Although
the scatter in the offsets from the local FP is large a clear trend for
a faster evolution of eld S0 galaxies is found On the other hand
eld elliptical galaxies appear to form two separate groups with
respect to ML ratios To assess the formation redshift zform we
split our eld galaxy sample into a low- and high-mass sample at
M  2  1011M An unrestricted linear 2-t to the low-mass
early-type eld galaxies with M  2  1011M gives
 lnMLB  125  056 z  008  041
This would correspond to a formation redshift of zform  19 
05 The error on zform denotes the observed 1 scatter in the
 lnMLBz relation For the higher-mass galaxies with M

For the massive early-type eld galaxies the evolution of the ML
predicts a mean star formation epoch for the bulk of their stellar
populations of zform  35  13 In comparison to the lower-mass
counterparts a higher formation redshift is signicant on the 2
level based on the uncertainty of the high-mass galaxies The lack
of eld galaxies with masses of M  2  1011M introduces a
larger uncertainty on the zform value By comparing the derived
formation epoch of the highmass cluster galaxies with numbers
for cluster galaxies in the literature a good agreement is found
Based on a compilation of clusters out to redshift of z  127
van Dokkum  Stanford 2003 deduce zform  2609
04 This
study gives an upper limit for the formation redshift of massive
cluster galaxies of zform  35 1 The result obtained for
the massive eld galaxies here is within this upper limit which
suggests that these eld galaxies have old passively evolving
stellar populations similar to their massive counterparts in clusters
Besides the scatter of the individual galaxies lower-mass eld
galaxies have a stronger evolution in their ML ratio The mean
stellar population ages of the less-massive eld galaxies are
younger with lower formation redshift of 1  zform  2 This
suggests a massdependent luminosity evolution with a stronger
evolution for lowermass galaxies with M  2  1011M
The rest-frame optical colours offer a powerful tool to inves-
tigate the origin of the scatter in  lnMLB Figure 17 displays
the ML ratios as a function of the rest-frame B  I colour for
our early-type eld galaxies As expected from stellar population
model predictions galaxies with lower ML ratios should have
bluer colors than galaxies with higher ML Indeed lower-mass
galaxies with low ML ratios are on average bluer than higher-
mass galaxies with high ML ratios Galaxies with low ML

shift is displayed for our early-type eld galaxies As a comparison
we also indicate the median B  I colour derived for early-type

Figures 16 and 18 strong similarities can be found The strong cor-
relation between ML and galaxy colour and a similar evolution in
ML and in colour indicates that the observed evolution and scatter
in ML are intrinsic to the galaxies and due to differences in their
stellar populations Note that in this Figure also galaxies for which
no ML ratios could be derived are shown If the sample is equally
split according to the characteristic mass separation as introduced

resent the two Sa bulges ID 6336 and ID 508 that are clearly offset
from the rest of the sample The difference between eld elliptical
and S0 galaxies found in the FP can be explained by a difference
in their formation epochs Ellipticals especially massive ones were
generated at earlier times and follow rather moderate quiescent evo-
lutionary tracks On the contrary lenticular and Sa bulges show
more diverse stellar populations which are younger and have been
formed at recent times with formation redshifts 1  zform  2
52 Independent Diagnostics of Star Formation
In Figure 17 we have shown that the mass-to-light ratio correlates
well with the rest-frame B  I color As independent diagnostic
tools for star formation we also compare the equivalent widths of
O II and HA to stellar population models
Using the O II and HA star formation indicators see  234
allows us to probe different time scales of star formation episodes
in our sample galaxies Assuming a passive evolution for systems
with old stellar populations average age of 1 Gyr with no emis-
sion lines in their spectra the equivalent widths of Balmer absorp-
tion lines decrease continuously over time Within the rst  108
yr of the generation of new stars in these galaxies the equivalent
width of H increases rapidly up to its maximum value around
10 A Afterwards the Balmer line decreases steadily until the stel-
lar population reaches an age of 2 Gyr This can be interpreted that
substantial star formation events 30 M yr1 occurred in the
rst  108 yr of the systems with subsequent weak star formation
thereafter In case of the O IIemission line it offers an diagnostic
that is sensitive to ongoing or very recent star formation episodes

HA measurements to the HA determinations of eld galaxies up

tion in the Gemini Deep Deep Survey GDDS by Le Borgne et al

with HA  4 A as being galaxies with strong H absorption Two
sets of different stellar population models by Bruzual  Charlot

eld galaxies in the WHDF and FDF exhibit lower HA absorp-
tion features Non of our systems exhibit very strong HA equiva-
lent width in particular all galaxies gave HA  260  023 A
Therefore they are most likely not systems with strong H absorp-
tion They follow the evolution track of the composite stellar evo-
lution model consisting of an initial burst of SF at zf1  2 and a
secondary SF burst at zf2  12 A single stellar population model
consisting of a main star burst forming 90 of the total stellar con-
tent at zf  5 is consistent with three galaxies All these galaxies
show both stronger HA absorption and additional O II 3727 emis-
sion in their spectra and have experienced a very recent episode of
star formation see next section 521 for further details
521 Recent Star Formation
Six galaxies in our sample feature O II 3727 emission lines in
their spectra Two of these are spiral bulges ID 158 and ID 508
three are of intermediate type S0Sa ID 946 and ES0 ID 111 and
ID 173 and one is an elliptical galaxy ID 437 For these objects
the main questions of interest are the star formation rate SFR the
mass fraction involved in the star formation and the duration of the
star formation episode
In oder to convert the O II 3727 equivalent width to star for-
mation rates we assume that the equivalent width measured within
the aperture is a representative diagnostic for the global value of the
galaxy The observed luminosity LO IIobs of the O II emission
line can be derived as
LO IIobs  14031029 LB
EWO II ergs s1 12
with LBLB  1004 MBMB  and MB  548
Kennicutt 1992 Balogh et al 1997 The observed measured
LO IIobs is related to the intrinsic LO IIint luminosity as
LO IIint  311  1020 LO II1495
Equation 13 takes into account the intrinsic reddening To derive
the total SFR in units of solar masses per year we use the relation
established by Kewley et al 2004
SFR  658  1042 LO IIint M yr1
Since we do not know the oxygen abundances of our galaxies we
have chosen to adopt the average calibration by Kewley et al
Using our observed O II equivalent widths we derive for
the six emission-line galaxies a median SFR of 62 M yr1 For
the four ES0 galaxies we nd a median SFR of 37 M yr1
whereas the SFR for two Sa bulges is 155 M yr1 Instead trans-
forming our observed O II equivalent widths to rest-frame and
assuming the relationship reported by Balogh et al 1997 with a
global extinction correction of EH1 mag we nd for the whole
sample a median SFR of 25 M yr1 The SFRs for the ES0 and
Sa galaxies are 25 and 91 M yr1 respectively If we correct
the absolute B-band magnitude of our galaxies using the luminos-
ity difference of the distant galaxies and the low-redshift reference
sample as derived from the FP we get a mean mass of these galax-
ies of 148  1011 M median 198  1011 M Assuming an
1 Gyr burst of star formation with the mean SFR found for the O II
line would have involved between 3 to 10 median about 5

volved mass in the SF burst should appear to be strongly dependent
on the galaxy mass However our sample statistics of galaxies with
recent SF are too small and the galaxies are spread among different
redshifts to give further constraints
To further constrain the duration and the mass fraction in-
volved in the star formation episode we compared our measure-
ments to sets of toy models that consist a mix of two stellar popu-
lations Bruzual  Charlot 2003 Line emission are either caused
by a small mass fraction 3 involved in the star formation burst
suggesting zform  11 or if a larger mass fraction 10 is
adopted the episode should have been started earlier zform  17
In general line emission is evidence for star formation activ-
ity or an AGN which increases the average luminosity of the galaxy
and thereby causing the system to be offset from the local FP re-
lation In contrast to what is expected the galaxies with detected
ongoing SF in our sample indicate no offset along the edge-on pro-
jection of the FP but a tight relation Based on our measurements
we estimate that the stellar mass fraction involved in the SF episode
must be in order of 25 to result in a visible effect within the FP
The emission-line galaxies in our sample indicate no signs of in-
teractions or merging events that could trigger the star formation
episodes in these objects We therefore nd no evidence for a con-
nection between star formation activity and interaction signatures
or mergers

Over the past few years several groups have measured the
ML evolution of eld earlytype galaxies at different red-
shifts either using direct mass measurements

Gebhardt et al 2003 van der Wel et al 2005 Treu et al 2005 or
modelling the stellar kinematic structure and mass prole from the
separation of multiple gravitationally lensed images of background
galaxies van de Ven et al 2003 Rusin  Kochanek 2005 In the
following we will compare these previous results in the literature
with our ndings and comment on possible inconsistencies that ex-
ist between the datasets Table 11 gives a compilation of the ML
evolution as reported by various groups based on different datasets
For comparison we also list the methods and selection criteria of
each of the studies where T corresponds to a selection based on
morphologies In the methods we present the two most popular
techniques in measuring the internal kinematics of ES0 galaxies
either using the stellar velocity dispersion  or using separation
of gravitational lensed images via an isothermal model lensing
isothermal or more complex algorithms lensing complex Be-
sides the magnitude limited samples there are two studies that anal-
ysed the same sample of lensing galaxies van de Ven et al 2003
Rusin  Kochanek 2005 The predictions based on lensing prop-
erties of early-type galaxies agree with one another to within their
quoted uncertainties Most of these studies report that early-type
lens galaxies appear to have nearly isothermal mass density proles
eg van de Ven et al 2003 Rusin  Kochanek 2005 took a dif-
ferent approach and described the mass distribution using statisti-
cal model assumptions where the galaxy populations are described
by a range of star formation redshifts allowing for a scatter cre-
ated by deviations from homology or spread in formation epochs
Both methods of lensing and direct mass measurements agree quite
well within their uncertainties although lensing appears to predict
a slightly slower ML evolution of the galaxies From comparison
with other results we found that differences in the tting technique
can change the amount of evolution in ln MLBz for each data
sample by up to 26
Using direct kinematic measurements two groups have drawn
samples of eld galaxies from the CDFS to study their evolution at
06  z  1 van der Wel et al 2005 di Serego Alighieri et al
2005 However these different teams found rather inconsistent
galaxy sizes and velocity dispersions for both individual and same
objects Discrepancies arise most
likely because these studies
used different tting algorithms for both galaxy parameters sizes
and kinematics di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 argue that their
smaller sizes are due to a selection effect of compact galaxies
These objects are rather faint and have low velocity dispersions
13 of the galaxies have   100 km s1 and thus could be either
biased to early-type spirals or low-luminosity early-type galaxies
containing faint discs that are unresolved This argument gets sup-
port by their small measured Sersic indices In addition the large
spectroscopic apertures used in their work may cause to under-
estimate a substantial rotational support in the case of faint low-
luminosity galaxies The most likely explanation between the dif-
ferences of di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 and van der Wel et al
2005 might be the selection of the target objects and the different
analysis tools where the former primarily selected fainter galax-
ies whereas the latter included also higher-luminosity hence more-
massive galaxies
Additional selection effects may arise from small number
statistics noise introduced by cosmic variance or the use of shallow
imaging data which results in a contamination by bulge-dominated
spiral galaxies Further low-SN spectra cannot disentangle galax-
ies with post-starburst spectra ie H-strong galaxies from spec-
tra of normal passive galaxies Unfortunately our current analysis
is limited with respect to the sample size However effects due to
imperfections of data quality can completely be ruled out in case

the lowest average masses of galaxies Therefore the lower-mass
range where effects of differences in the evolution should be more
pronounced can be investigated in greater detail In the nearby fu-
ture we will address both important restrictions of number statis-
tics and cosmic variance that impact high redshift studies A Fritz

7 DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
71 AGNs
Some previous studies have investigated the possible inuence
of the nuclear activity on the evolution of early-type galaxies
Woo et al 2004 2005 nd no differences in the evolution of the
FP for BL Lac objects and radio galaxies with a central AGN
from normal early-type galaxies up to z  05 However their
sample consists of high-luminosity galaxies hence it is biased
towards high-mass galaxies in particular M  3  1011M
van der Wel et al 2005 detected in an FP analysis of eld early-
type galaxies up to z  1 that 4 out of 11 galaxies at z  08
36 and one out of 16 for z  09 show AGN activity Although
their galaxies with AGN are twice as massive than galaxies without
AGN they show similar ML evolution and no blue rest-frame
B  I colours The authors suggest that the difference between
AGN and non-AGN galaxies may become more apparent at higher
redshift z  08 A similarly low number of AGN galaxies was
detected within the sample of Treu et al 2005 who identied out
of 26 ES0 X-ray counterparts nine AGN based on X-ray lumi-
nosity XAGN 16 LLAGN see section 35 and Appendix  B
for these group denitions but only two out of 13 O II -emitting
ES0 galaxies as secure AGN The total early-type galaxy sample
of Treu et al 2005 has a quite low contribution of AGN activity
16 and none of the spectra shows signs of signicant SFR with
an upper limit of 30 M yr1
We nd three candidates in our eld galaxy sample 13
that show weak evidence for hosting an AGN see section 35 Our
observations suggest a very mild evolution in the absolute numbers
of AGN hosts up to z  07 This is consistent with the results
of the stellar mass function of AEGIS eld galaxies Bundy et al
2008 where the abundance of X-ray selected AGN host galax-
ies L 1042 ergs s1 decreases roughly by a factor of two from
z  12 to z  05 but remains relatively at across the stellar
mass range of 1035  logMM  1170 However possible
contributions due to LLAGN andor emission from soft extended
X-ray halos or LMXBs could have inuence on the activity of our
individual galaxies as well For our eld galaxies we measure an av-
erage contribution of LMXBs to the X-ray emission in the K-band
of LXLMXB186 The X-ray luminosities in our distant
galaxies show a weak excess in the soft diffuse X-ray plasma emis-
sion depending on the established local LX  LB relationship
between 73 to 2615 compared to the local refer-
ence The increased luminosities are most likely originating from
a net effect of star formation andor LLAGN A more detailed dis-
cussion of these ndings and their implications can be found in the
Appendix  B
Blue central cores in galaxies are not a stringent indicator for
a central AGN power source For example within the eld early-
type galaxy sample of Treu et al 2005 only 8 show signs of
central blue rest-frame colours with B  V   02 and only
two of these objects 1 appear also to host an AGN based on
their high X-ray luminosity 1042 ergs s1 This suggests that
the colour information of the galaxies is not a very powerful tech-
nique to distinguish active from non-active galaxies As there is no
multi-band HST photometry for our sky elds available we thus
cannot investigate the colour gradients in our ES0 galaxies
72 Signatures of Star Formation Quenching
To establish and explore the evolutionary link between ES0
galaxies at high redshift and their local descendants we assume
that ES0 galaxies comprising passive red and dead non-
A Fritz A Bohm and B L Ziegler
starforming old stellar populations at high redshift will only be
subject to a pure passive evolution in luminosity through z 
0 Our approach is justied by the colour evolution of galaxies
populating the red sequence following a pure passive evolution
Bell et al 2004 Faber et al 2007 In the next step we adopt the
luminosity dimming as derived from the evolution of the FP see
 5 as  lnMLB   171  018 z and correct for progeni-
tor bias This latter effect also compensates for a possible morpho-
logical transformation of galaxies which end up as being classied
as passive local ES0 galaxies Massive eld ES0 galaxies show
a smaller offset from the ML-relation whereas less massive ones
evolve faster which is supported by younger stellar populations see
section 51 Independent of the luminosity of our galaxies we ap-
ply this relationship to all galaxies in our sample and then inves-
tigate a possible dependence of the evolution on luminosity and
the physical mechanisms that drive our measured mass dependent
evolution The luminosity of the distant ES0 galaxies is then de-
creased by a rate of  log LB  074 z to obtain their absolute
rest-frame B-band magnitude at z  0 as
MBz  0  MBz  078  25  z  MBz  195 z15
This luminosity is the resulting characteristic brightness at z  0 to
which the galaxies would fade assuming a pure passive evolution
The rate of luminosity evolution in equation 15 is consistent with
the predictions of stellar population synthesis models that formed
the bulk of the stars in ES0 galaxies at z  15 Bell et al 2004
In Figure 21 we compare the evolution of the rest-frame lumi-
nosity MBz  0 corrected for expected passive evolution and
stellar mass as a function of redshift for various eld early-type
galaxy samples Several implications can be drawn from this dia-
gram First there is a clear trend of MBz  0 becoming more
luminous with increasing redshift for the eld ES0 galaxies in the
FDF and WHDF large squares Our results are in good agree-
ment with the ndings for eld ES0 galaxies up to z  1 by
Treu et al 2005 shown as small triangles together with their as-
sociated errors 1 scatter These measurements have also been
corrected with equation 15 but using the evolution as derived from
their FP
Moreover the brightening detected for our galaxies indicates
that the most massive ES0 galaxies are the rst to build up the
red sequence whereas less massive ones join at more recent epochs
z  1 The observed trend of both the evolutionary corrected
luminosity and total stellar mass is consistent with that of a charac-
teristic redshift evolution of the so-called quenching mass MQ 
1z45 Bundy et al 2006 The quenching mass limit MQz is
a diagnostic that traces the total baryonic stellar mass scale and a
direct by product of the mechanism that drives downsizing It is de-
ned as the fraction of star forming galaxies usually 13 of the total
fraction which contributes to the total star forming mass budget
Above this mass threshold MQz star formation in stellar sys-
tems is suppressed and the majority of galaxies have already been
transformed into passive quiescent galaxies The global trend of
a downward evolution of the transitional mass with increasing age
of the Universe where MQz decreases by a factor of 5 from
z  1 is well reproduced by measurements based on the COMBO-
17 and DEEP2 redshift surveys Borch et al 2006 Bundy et al
2006 Hopkins et al 2007 This transitional crossover mass is
computed in different redshift bins for 50 late-type spirals and
peculiars morphologies dashed line in Figure 21 50 galaxies
with blue U  B colour dot-dashed line and 50 galaxies with
O II -inferred SFRs above 02 M yr1 dotted line These trends
can also be fairly well described by the solid line in Figure 21
Figure 21 Evolution of the quenching mass MQ and rest-frame luminos-
ity corrected for passive evolution for different redshift bins Field ES0
galaxies in the FDF and WHDF are denoted by large squares eld ES0s

colour dot-dashed and 50 with high O II SFR dotted The solid line
indicates the passively evolved average LF for ES0 galaxies by Cimatti et
al 2006 at which about 60 of the ES0 galaxies are already in place
There is a weak decrease of MQz towards lower redshifts which sug-
gests that star formation is efciently suppressed in more massive galaxies
which indicates the average evolution of the passively evolved LF
for early-type galaxies from the COMBO-17 DEEP2 and SXDS
with redshift Cimatti et al 2006 at which the bulk 60 of
the ES0 galaxies are already in place While our observed eld
galaxies are in good agreement with the model predictions us-
ing blue U  B color criterion in particular for fainter hence
lower mass individual eld galaxies MBz  0  205
M  1011M models with high SFR as measured from the
O II emission strength are not consistent with the observations
There is a weak increase of the quenching mass MQz with red-
shift which is already apparent at lower redshifts z  07 which
continuous up to higher redshifts z  12 This trend suggests
that star formation is more effectively suppressed in more lumi-
nous massive systems Strong suppression of star formation could
be triggered from AGN feedback of weak low luminosity radio-
mode AGN that have red optical colours and are situated in very
massive dark matter haloes Croton et al 2006 Salim et al 2007
Figure 21 suggests further that the evolution is a strong func-
tion of luminosity and mass and the evolution depends on the evo-
lution corrected luminosity and stellar mass range of each spe-
cic galaxy sample under consideration Evidence for this trend is
also accumulated by studies of the redshift evolution of the LF
which argue that the number density of massive ES0 galaxies
M  1011M remains constant out to z  1 Bell et al 2004
Cimatti et al 2006 For less massive galaxies M  1011M
the LF becomes progressively underpopulated with increasing red-
shift which could point to the fact that the progenitors of the mas-
sive local ES0 galaxies are still experiencing a period of active star
formation These galaxies would be too blue to fulll the require-
ments in the LF selection at higher redshift and could gradually
build up the red sequence of massive ES0 galaxies by a succes-
sive quenching of the star formation at the less massive end of the
LF M  1011M In this picture a fraction of blue spiral

Field EarlyType Galaxies in the FDF and WHDF
8 CONCLUSIONS
Using a combination of high signal-to-noise intermediate-
resolution VLT spectroscopy deep U BgRI groundbased pho-
tometry and high-resolution ACS imaging we have investigated
the properties and evolution of 24 eld early-type ES0 galax-
ies covering redshifts 020  z  075 down to a magnitude
limit of MB  1930 The targets were selected from the south-
ern FDF and northern WHDF based on morphology luminosity
spectrophotometric type and photometric redshift or broad-band
colours Scaling relationships of the Faber-Jackson relation FJR
and Kormendy relation as well as the Fundamental Plane FP have
been constructed to assess the evolution of the stellar populations
for the galaxies in our sample The formation epoch for the bulk of
the stars in these systems was constrained by comparing the evo-
lution of the ML ratios to different stellar population models To
reveal the origin of the star formation in some of our galaxies we
have exploited the Chandra and XMM-Newton data archives The
main results of this work can be summarised as follows
 The mass-to-light ratio of the eld early-type galaxies evolves
on average as  lnMLB  171  018 z which is faster
than for cluster early-type galaxies This is consistent with eld
ES0 galaxies comprising on average younger stellar populations
than those of their cluster counterparts
 The evolution as derived from the scaling relations of
the FJR
the FP and hence the effective mass-to-light ratio
shows a strong dependence on the mass Less-massive systems
with M  2  1011M display a faster ML evolution
of  lnMLB  125  030 z whereas more-massive
galaxies with M  2  1011M evolve much slower as
 lnMLB  089  019 z This implies that for the most
massive eld galaxies M  2  1011M the majority of their
stellar populations have been formed early at zform  35 
13 For less-massive galaxies the evolution in the ML ratios
can be translated into a lower formation redshift of their stars
of zform  19  05 which is at variance with the predic-
tions of single-burst stellar population models A fraction of 5
10 in the total stellar mass of lower-mass galaxies M 
2  1011M must have been formed at more recent epochs
At z  04 an accelerated evolution for less-massive galaxies
h lnMLB i  054  007 than for more-massive ones
h lnMLB i  031  006 is signicant on the 2 level
 The morphological sub-classes of early-type galaxies ellip-
tical and lenticular S0 galaxies appear not to represent a ho-
mogenous group but follow different evolutionary tracks Lentic-
ular galaxies feature on average a stronger luminosity evolution
h lnMLB i  024  010 bluer rest-frame colours and
more diverse stellar populations and hence evolve faster than el-
liptical galaxies h lnMLBi  009  007 However the
differences between elliptical and lenticular galaxies are only mod-
erate signicant and difcult to disentangle from their individual
scatter Note that for deriving the scatter we took into account ran-
dom errors as well as systematic uncertainties see  45 Inter-
estingly the scatter appears to be mainly amplied for lenticular
galaxies
 Evidence for secondary star formation activity in some of our
galaxies is provided by the detection of O II emission or strong H
Balmer absorption as well as bluer rest-frame B  I colour di-
agnostics The H absorption line strengths in our galaxies implies
that the residual low level star formation of the galaxies accounts
for 5 to 10 in the total stellar mass budget of these systems
 We have found three possible candidates that could harbour an
central AGN source However the trigger of the star formation in
our galaxies is most likely either stellar origin or the result of AGN
feedback from weak low luminosity radio-mode AGN with red
optical colours Croton et al 2006 Salim et al 2007
 Over the past 6 Gyr there is the trend of a slow decreasing
quenching mass which characterises a crossover in stellar mass
above star formation in galaxies gets suppressed This suggest that
our systems experience a gradual suppression in their star forma-
tion processes Our results favour a scenario where star formation
is not immediately suppressed for less-massive halos and hence
works on longer time scales in lower-mass galaxies
The evolution of the ML ratio of our eld early-type galax-
ies favours a downsizing formation scenario similar to the detected
decrease in luminosity of rapidly star forming eld galaxies since
z 1 Cowie et al 1996 Gavazzi et al 1996 In this top-down
picture massive galaxies are dominated by quiescent red old stel-
lar populations and evolve passively on longer timescales Less-
massive systems however exhibit more extended star formation
histories with mass hosting star formation processes decreasing as
times evolves Both the mass assembly and star formation are ac-
celerated in massive stellar systems that are preferably located in
high density environments In contrast in less-massive smaller
systems
these physical processes work on longer timescales
Moreover our results suggest a continuous mass assembly of eld
early-type galaxies during the last 5 Gyr This is supported by re-
cent studies of eld galaxies up to z  1 van der Wel et al 2005
Treu et al 2005 Bundy et al 2006 Hopkins et al 2007
An accelerated evolution in the ML ratios of the less-
massive galaxies with respect to more-massive ones was also found
for cluster early-type galaxies Fritz et al 2005 The lack of a sig-
nicant age difference between eld and cluster early-type galax-
ies as expected from hierarchical formation models Diaferio et al
2001 De Lucia et al 2004 and the dependence of the evolution
on galaxy mass suggests that environmental effects play a rather
minor role in the formation of early-type galaxies More important
to the evolutionary history of a stellar system are its internal prop-
erties such as chemical composition or element abundance ratios
In a next step we will combine our precise FP measurements
with an analysis of the absorption line strengths in our eld early-
type galaxies This will provide strong constraints on the evolution
of stellar populations and the chemical enrichment history of heavy
elements in these systems

APPENDIX A VERIFICATIONS OF  MEASUREMENTS
A1 Different Absorption Passbands
To test the accuracy and the possible internal systematic effects of
velocity dispersion measurements using different absorption fea-
tures galaxies where multiple  determinations could be obtained
are compared In case of ve eld early-type galaxies in the WHDF
 was derived based on the Mgb and the G-band feature Figure A1
shows the formal relative uncertainty 1 as a function of ve-
locity dispersion upper panel and as a function of the SN lower
panel per A for the earlytype galaxies in the WHDF where both
measurements are available The lower panel is divided according
to the SN of the feature of interest SN values from the Mgb
lines are denoted as circles whereas the SN based on the Gband
is indicated as triangles 1 was computed as the relative dif-
ference in velocity dispersion values of the Mgb with the G-band
line normalised to the reference velocity dispersions 1 Both fea-
tures were free from any contamination due to sky lines and did
not suffer from any residual sky background artefacts The relative
uncertainties cover the range 003  1  006 with a me-
dian of h1i  005 The  determinations are in extremely
good agreement and show similar absolute errors between 8 to 18
km s1 Even for the lowest SN ratios the formal uncertainty of
5 is less than the typical individual error in the  measurement
This limit is also the smallest formal uncertainty that can be reached
with the instrumental resolution and the template stars No trend of
increasing systematic errors on the  values with low SN can be
found Results from the Monte-Carlo simulations showed that the

A1 effects of systematic uncertainties become negligible
effects of systematic errors on  become important at SN  8 per
A cf  232 As this limit is below the average SN in the spec-
tra of our lowluminosity galaxies the formal uncertainty therefore
becomes negligible even for the lowest derived velocity dispersions
in the galaxy samples A comparison of the absolute velocity dis-
persions for the WHDF ellipticals is presented in Figure A2 in the
next section
A2 Repeat Observations
For a total of ve eld galaxies in the WHDF sample which are
included in two or more different MOS masks it is possible to con-
rm the internal reliability of the spectral reduction and analysis
A total of nine repeat observations was acquired for the WHDF el-
lipticals Two galaxies were observed thrice ID 92 and ID 111 and
ID 173 four times The velocity dispersions have been measured for
both individual setups and the agreement between these two deter-
minations is very good with a median offset in  at the 4 level
Figure A2 compares the velocity dispersion measurements for the
ve WHDF eld galaxy spectra which were observed with two or
up to four different mask setups One galaxy with four repeat ob-
servations is denoted with two additional large circles In general
velocity dispersions of the secondary measurements are based on
lower SN spectra and therefore show larger errors The nal mea-
surement with the smallest error yielded 173  204  16 km s1
SN  37 which represents also the smaller deviation with re-
spect to the reference line For the WHDF eld ellipticals the rel-
ative difference between reference and secondary measurements is
1  0041  0015 with 23  SN  57 In order to in-
crease the signaltonoise in the nal spectra these repeat obser-
be to classify our galaxies schematically based on their measured
X-ray luminosity Using the X-ray ux measurements for our ob-
jects we can give constraints on the various sources that contribute
to the X-ray emission of our galaxies The two main groups of in-
terests are systems with nuclear activity based on the X-ray lumi-
nosity XAGN and galaxies with low-luminosity nuclear activity
LLAGN andor ongoing star formation
For the old quiescent stellar populations in early-type galax-
ies pointlike X-ray sources are very likely to be entirely resem-
bled by LMXBs The contribution due to LMXBs is direct pro-
portional to the stellar mass of a galaxy In general these bi-
nary systems  30  140 sources per galaxy account for a
smaller but non-negligible fraction 25 of the total galaxy
X-ray luminosity OSullivan et al 2001 Kim  Fabbiano 2004
Using the relationship between total B-band and X-ray luminos-
ity by Kim  Fabbiano 2004 as LXLMXB090  050 
1030 LBLB in units of ergs s1 we measure an average
contribution of LMXBs of 177 The evolution corrected
absolute B-band luminosities of our galaxies fall in the range
995  log LBLB  1130 with a median of 1047 As a
comparison introducing our K-band measurements of 1068 
log LK LK  1179 average 1122 and a similar relation
as above but for the K-band luminosity of LXLMXB020 
008  1030 LK LK ergs s1 we detect an LMXB source
contribution of 186
Local early-type galaxies show a correlation of their soft X-
ray luminosity with their stellar LB eg OSullivan et al 2001
Excluding dwarf galaxies brightest clustergroup galaxies and
galaxies with AGN hosts OSullivan et al 2001 found for 184
nearby ES0 galaxies logLX217  011log LB  1798 
112 Because of the evolved stellar populations in the local ES0
galaxies any detected excess with respect to this empirical re-
lation would imply a measure of star formation processes or
LLAGNs in our distant galaxies Applying the above relationship
to our sample we derive an excess in diffuse plasma fraction of
2615 compared to the local value Using instead the re-
lation by OSullivan et al 2003 LX 05  20 keV  4 
1041 LB101127 the fraction of soft X-ray plasma decreases to
73 Both measurements give evidence for a weak excess in
the X-ray luminosities in our distant galaxies 1040  LX  1042
compared to the local reference The increased luminosities are
most likely the result of a combination of star formation andor
LLAGN However a possible contribution from LMXBs and soft
diffuse X-ray plasma emission to the X-ray luminosities cannot be
ruled out completely To clearly distinguish between the various
contributions a detailed analysis of the X-ray spectra is necessary
which goes beyond the scope of the present work

ferent slitlet congurations prove that our kinematic measurements

can be neglected
APPENDIX B X-RAY POPULATIONS
Early-type galaxies in the nearby universe with luminosities typ-
ically LX  1042 ergs s1 most likely harbour an AGN source
in their centre OSullivan et al 2001 Below this ux limit at
LX  1042 ergs s1 the main contributions to the total X-ray lu-
minosity of a galaxy could be a variety of sources such as from
low-luminosity AGN LLAGN high-mass and low-mass X-ray
stellar binaries LMXBs and emission uxes from the diffuse
soft X-ray plasma that surrounds the galaxy Te  1 keV
LMXBs are associated with evolved old stellar populations A
stars and a common feature in local bulge systems in the eld and
globular clusters As both E and S0 galaxies comprise homoge-
nous stellar populations their X-ray binaries XRB populations
should also be uniformly distributed among the galaxy popula-
tions In the past it was proposed that LMXBs might even dom-
inate the global X-ray emission of early-type galaxies Fabbiano
1989 However this issue is hard to quantify as LMXBs cannot be
identied as individual point sources On the other hand for fainter
X-ray systems observations argue that LMXBs account for a signif-
icant high fraction from 20 up to 50 of the X-ray emission of
the host galaxy Sarazin et al 2000 Kim  Fabbiano 2003 which
becomes a non-negligible factor when estimating the dynamical
masses of their stellar host systems
In oder to identify in our sample of galaxies with possible
associated X-ray counterparts see  35 those systems with nu-
clear activity or ongoing star formation an effective way would
