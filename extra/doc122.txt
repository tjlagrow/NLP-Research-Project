ABSTRACT
Using data from the IMACS Cluster Building Survey and from nearby galaxy surveys we examine
the evolution of the rate of star formation in eld galaxies from z  060 to the present Fitting the
luminosity function to a standard Schechter form we nd a rapid evolution of M 
B consistent with
B is evolving at the rate of 038Gyr1
that found in other deep surveys at the present epoch M 
several times faster than the predictions of simple models for the evolution of old coeval galaxies
The evolution of the distribution of specic star formation rates SSFR is also too rapid to explain
by such models We demonstrate that starbursts cannot even in principle explain the evolution of
the SSFR distribution However the rapid evolution of both M 
B and the SSFR distribution can be
explained if some fraction of galaxies have star formation rates characterized by both short rise and
fall times and by an epoch of peak star formation more recent than the majority of galaxies Although
galaxies of every stellar mass up to 14  1011M show a range of epochs of peak star formation the
fraction of younger galaxies falls from about 40 at a mass of 4  1010M to zero at a mass of
14  1011M The incidence of younger galaxies appears to be insensitive to the density of the local
environment but does depend on group membership relatively isolated galaxies are much more likely
to be young than are group members

1 INTRODUCTION
The last 10 years have seen an explosion in the num-
ber of studies of the evolution of star formation in the
universe Observations of tens of thousands of high
redshift objects have been obtained with redshifts de-
termined by either spectroscopic or photometric means
and star formation rates determined from optical spec-
troscopy optical UV and infrared photometry as well
as Xray and radio emission Much of the focus has been
on the evolution of the star formation rate density Lilly
et al 1996 Madau et al 1996 see Cucciati et al 2012 for
a recent summary The evolution of the star formation
rate density is a fundamental cosmological datum de-
scribing the star formation properties of universe as a
whole but it contains limited information about the be-
havior of individual galaxies whose collective histories
are responsible for it However there have also been a
large number of studies of the distribution of the star
formation rates of individual galaxies and their depen-
dence on galaxy properties environment and epoch eg

Although there is considerable disagreement about the
shape of the star formation rate SFR distribution at
a given galaxy mass and epoch the work of the last
decade has produced broad agreement about some as-
pects of the star formation history of galaxies since at
least z  10 At every epoch the specic star forma-
tion rate SSF R  SF RMstars decreases with galactic
mass implying that star formation has a more extended
history in low than in high mass galaxies At every mass
the SFR and SSFR decline with cosmic epoch at a rate
which is approximately the same for all masses suggest-
ing that the two dependancies are roughly separable ie
SF RMgal tuni  f Mgal  f tuni
Much of the emphasis in recent papers has been on
the history of mass production how the mass of stars
grows with time in particular kinds of galaxies and en-
vironments leading to galaxies of the forms and masses
we see today eg Feulner et al 2005b Bell et al 2007
Walcher et al 2008 However to understand what is
responsible for the mass production we need to under-
stand the processes which drive the evolution of the star
formation rates of individual galaxies One does not need
to go to cosmological depths to discover that on aver-
age massive galaxies formed the bulk of their stars more
rapidly than less massive ones the correlation of spectral
type with star formation history and the rough correla-
tion of spectral type with galactic mass have been known
for decades A recent determination using Sloan data
has been done by Jimenez et al 2005 This shift with
time of star formation from more to less massive galax-
ies is quite often and quite confusingly called down-
sizing However this term is better applied as Cowie
et al 1996 originally intended to the purported delay
in the formation epoch of less massive galaxies or more
precisely to the delay in the epoch at which star forma-
tion peaked These two are quite dierent phenomena
which Neistein et al 2006 distinguish as archaeological
downsizing for the mass dependence of star formation
timescales and downsizing in time for the mass depen-
dence of the epoch of maximum star formation
Identifying a delay in galaxy formation whether mass
dependent or not does require observations at high red-
In addition to Cowie et al  claims to see such
an eect have been made by Feulner et al 2005 and
by Noeske et al 2007b
In all 3 studies the claimed
discovery rests on the existence of galaxies with specc
star formation rates too high to be sustained for the age
of the universe at the epoch of observation However
very high star formation rates and very high values of
SSFR can be produced for short periods by starbursts
and there have been multiple claims that it is starbursts
rather than delayed galaxy formation which are responsi-
ble for the observed phenomenon In this paper we shall
reexamine these issues using a sample of eld galaxies
from the IMACS Cluster Building Survey ICBS- Oemler
et al 2012 herafter Paper I The ICBS is a spectroscopic
survey of regions surrounding rich intermediateredshift
clusters performed using the IMACS wideeld spectro-
graph on the Baade Telescope Although targeted to
clusters the 30 eld of IMACS guaranteed that a large
fraction of the objects observed would be foreground and
background galaxies unrelated to the target clusters
and constituting an unbiased sample of the general eld
population We shall show that starbursts cannot be re-
sponsible for the observed evolution in SSFR and that
the epoch of peak star formation of a substantial fraction
of massive galaxies was delayed by at least several billion
years after that of the oldest galaxies
The organization of this paper is as follows
In sec-
tion 2 we describe the data sets we have used which in-
clude IMACS spectroscopy direct imaging and in two
of the four elds Spitzer 24 m photometry We also
use nearby surveys to construct local galaxy samples to
provide zero points for the redshift evolution seen in the
ICBS In Section 3 we study the evolution of the galaxy
populations including luminosity functions and the evo-
lution of the specic star formation rate In Section 4
we discuss the results but delay until a following pa-

the history of star formation in galaxies Throughout

2 DATA AND MODELS
21 Data Sets
We use a number of data sets in the following analy-
sis This is intended to be a study of the evolution of
the general eld by which we mean the totality of the
galaxy content of the universe unbiased by group or clus-
ter membership Our primary distant sample is drawn
from the ICBS qv Paper I The ICBS survey elds
were selected because the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey
technique RCS- Gladders  Yee 2000 which we used
indicated the presence of a very rich cluster at a suit-
able redshift 030  z  060 therefore these elds do
not represent an unbiased sample of the universe We
correct this by removing galaxies in a redshift interval
about each of the one or two clusters in each eld whose
presence we judge contributed to the RCS detection We
do not remove the contents of any other groups or clus-
ters suciently poor or suciently dierent in redshift
so that they did not contribute to the RCS signal The
results should be a reasonable even if not perfect ap-
proximation to a fair general eld sample This selection
is described in more detail in Paper I
The ICBS covers 4 elds each about 30 in diameter
near the celestial equator In all elds we have deep mul-
ticolor imaging in either the SDSS or Johnson system
and very deep imaging in the Gunn r band In two of
the elds we have Spitzer 24 m photometry of virtually
the entire eld to the confusionlimited depth The en-
tire spectroscopic sample contains 6008 galaxies of which
4578 comprise our eld sample About 80 of these are
in the redshift range 025  z  075 We have medium
resolution  5A spectra of most of the sample but for
1140 objects 946 eld galaxies we only have low dis-
persion prism LDP spectra which yield lower accuracy
redshifts z  001 and no optical line strengths
Star formation rates are based on in order of decreas-
ing preference 1 optical emission lines plus 24 m
ux 2 24 m ux 3 H ux 4 H ux and 5
O II ux New calibrations of all these SFR measures
are provided in Paper I although errors in SFR rates
increase for the lesspreferred measures all are on the
same systematic scale Stellar masses are calculated from
galaxy luminosities and colors using relations of color vs
masstolight ratio derived from stellar population mod-
els assuming a Salpeter IMF by a method similar but
not identical to that of Bell  de Jong 2001 More de-
tails can be found in Paper I All masses referred to in
this paper are stellar rather than dynamical masses
We construct two ICBS eld samples The 4-Field
sample is drawn from all 4 ICBS elds to a depth of
r  225 and excludes galaxies with only LDP spectra
We will use this sample whenever the analysis concerns
the environment of the galaxies for which the LDP red-
shifts are insuciently precise Otherwise we will use
the IR-ALL sample which is drawn from the two elds
RCS0221 and SDSS0845 that have Spitzer 24 m pho-
tometry This sample includes LDP objects and goes to
a depth of r  230 In all elds only about one half
of all galaxies above the survey limits were observed- the
selection of objects being driven by slit mask design- and
a small fraction of those observed did not yield a reliable
redshift Therefore each galaxy has associated with it a
weighting which reects the incompleteness of the cata-
log at the magnitude and location of the galaxy Details
of the ICBS data can be found in Paper I
We shall also make occasional use of the AEGIS sample
Davis et al 2007 We have converted their SFRs and
masses to a Salpeter IMF by multiplying by a factor of 2
For objects with detections at 24 m  the AEGIS group
have derived SFRs from Spitzer photometry using the
calibration of Le Floch et al 2005 we have converted
these values to that appropriate for our own calibration
of SF R  f F24 qv Paper I To convert SFRs based
on optical lines to our system we have remeasured a
sample of the DEEP2 spectra on which AEGIS is based

a only galaxies of mass M  4  1010M
and have derived a conversion between the AEGIS values
and our own
For comparisons with the properties of the present
epoch eld we have constructed 2 local samples The
NGP sample include SDSS objects with redshifts 0035 
z  0045 in the region of the North Galactic Cap within
11h    13h and 15    45 SFRs are de-
termined from H  and masses are calculated from the
observed SDSS colors using the calibrations in Paper I
This volume has an appreciably lower density than the
cosmic mean and is decient in highmass galaxies We
shall use this sample only for analyses concerning the
group membership of galaxies For all other analyses
we use the PM2GC catalog Calvi Poggianti  Vul-
cani 2011 which covers the volume 003  z  011
10h    14h45m 028    028 This sample
is drawn from a very narrow strip making the deter-
mination of group membership very uncertain Again
SFRs were determined using H  and masses derived
from the reported colors All of the galaxy samples used
in this paper are summarized in Table 1 The redshift
ranges are those of the subset of the data actually used
in this analysis and the number of galaxies is the num-
ber within the given redshift range Additionally the
PM2GC sample has been limited to galaxies with masses
Mgal  4  1010M
Because star formation rates and masses of all samples
both local and distant have been determined using the
same mix of methods described in Paper I there should
not be any systematic error in derived galaxy proper-
ties between the various redshift samples One potential
source of systematic error remains Since as we shall see
mean star formation rates increase rapidly with redshift
an incorrect slope of the calibrations of star formation
rates vs optical andor infrared indicators would result
in an incorrect absolute rate of evolution of star forma-
tion rate All of our star formation measures are tied to
the calibration of SFR vs24 m ux plus optical emis-
sion lines of Calzetti et al 2010 Since this calibration
is tied to the very reliable extinction-corrected hydrogen
recombination line measurements of star formation rates
we think it unlikely to be much in error
22 Galaxy Evolution Models
We shall compare our results with two sets of simple
models for the history of star formation in galaxies Both
sets assume solar metallicity and a Salpeter initial mass
function IMF The rst set have simple exponential
decay star formation histories
SF R  ettf orm
Although the instantaneous turnon of star formation
in these models is decidedly nonphysical they have been
the most popular models for star formation in galaxies
since at least Tinsley 1972 We take the formation
epoch tf orm  09Gyr and take values of  ranging
from 1 to 10 Gyr as well as    ie a constant
star formation rate The galaxy properties for these evo-
lutionary histories were calculated using the Burzual 
Charlot 2003 stellar models

Our second set of models assumes star formation his-
tories of the form introduced by Gavazzi et al 2002
SF R  tet22 2
These are usually called these delayed exponential mod-
els For these we calculate galaxy models using a dif-
ferent set of stellar models These models use the ob-
served stellar libraries of Jacoby et al 1984 in the op-
tical  3400 to 7400 A and they were extended to
the ultraviolet and infrared with the theoretical libraries
of Kurucz 1993 private communication They include
emission lines formed in HII regions that were calculated
using the photoionisation code cloudy Ferland 1996
The nebular component was calculated assuming case B
recombination electron temperature of 104 K and elec-
tron density of 102 cm3 The source of ionizing photons
was assumed to have a radius of 15 pc and a mass of 104
M The eect of using two dierent sets of stellar mod-
els is negligible compared to the dierences due to star
formation histories
The behavior of the two sets of models is presented
in Figure 1 Although the star formation histories of
the two sets of models are very dierent the mass and
specic star formation rate histories of the two sets are
quite similar sharing common characteristics which will
in fact be shared by any models with wellbehaved eg
no starbursts star formation histories These include
the facts that at any epoch galaxies with high SSFRs
must have rapidly evolving masses and slowly evolving
SSFRs while galaxies with low SSFRs must have slowly
evolving masses and may have rapidly evolving SSFRs
It is also characteristic of these but not necessarily of
every well-behaved model that the SSFRs within each
set of models diverge with time and never cross This
will be important in our later analysis
3 EVOLUTION OF GALAXY POPULATIONS
31 The Luminosity Function
We determine the Johnson B band luminosity func-
tion for our data sample using a maximum-likelihood
tting of a Schechter function as described in Sandage
et al 1979 A preliminary t to the data in redshift in-
tervals of 01 between z  013 and z  073 yields values
for  between -090 and -135 with no obvious trend with
redshift suggesting that using a xed value   110
should be suitable for the entire redshift range Analysis
of other highredshift galaxy samples have yielded val-
ues of  ranging from -103 from the zCOSMOS survey
Zucca et al 2009 to -130 from the DEEPCOMBO-17
surveys Faber et al 2007 again with no obvious red-
shift dependance In Table 2 we present the results of
ts to our data with xed   110
In Figure 2 we compare the results from Table 2
with other published values at redshifts in the range
002  z  090 as a function both of redshift and of
cosmic epoch
Included are those from the CfA Red-
shift Survey Marzke Huchra  Geller 1994 Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Blanton et al 2003 2df survey
Norberg et al 2002 DEEP and COMBO17 surveys
Faber et al 2007 VIMOS survey Ilbert et al 2005
and ZCosmos survey Zucca et al 2009 Although there
is a modest scatter between dierent determinations pos-
sibly due to cosmic variance the overall trend is quite
clear M 
B has evolved signicantly during the last half
of the age of the universe and is evolving most rapidly
at the present epoch
The composite data are well t by the relation
B  1953  6077z  68601z2  25740z3
Which is shown by the dashed line in Figure 2a The
dashed line in Figure 2b represents an evolution rate of
B equal to 038Gyr This is quite rapid representing
a decrease in characteristic luminosity of about a factor of
2 every 2 Gigayears We can compare this evolution rate

with the expectation from the simple models described
in the previous section We take the NGP data set for
each galaxy determine the appropriate value of  from
its SSFR and from the corresponding model calculate
Bdt We evolve all galaxies back in time for a xed
time interval t a Schechter function to the luminosity
function at the earlier time and determine dM 
Bdt The
rst three rows of Table 3 compares the observed values
of dM 
Bdt for xed   110 and variable values
of  with the values predicted by the exponential and
delayed exponential models The predicted evolutionary
rates are signicantly smaller than the observed rate
We have obtained these results for only two quite sim-
ple models for galactic evolution but one can argue that
for any well-behaved model eg no bursts no special
epoch of observation there is a limit to the evolution
rate of M 
B which depends only of the IMF and the
epoch of galaxy formation If the optical luminosity of a
galaxy is dominated by old stars then with t0  13Gyr
and a Salpeter IMF the evolutionary rate is predicted to
be dM 
Bdt  010Gyr One can obtain a higher rate
only if the luminosity is dominated by young stars and
the star formation rate is falling rapidly However if the
SFR is falling fast then for well-behaved models it was
much higher in the past so that the total mass of older
stars must be large compared to the mass of young stars
the luminosity will not be dominated by the young stars
and the rapid evolution of the SFR will have minimal
eect on the evolution of the luminosity One can escape
this trap only by signicantly reducing the age of the
galaxies which will reduce the total accumulated num-
ber and luminosity of the older stars
In the last two
lines of Table 3 we present the predicted evolutionary
rates for the delayed exponential models for two cases
in which the start of galaxy formation is delayed for 2
Gyrs and 5 Gyrs It appears that a decrease of several
Gyr in the age of the typical galaxy could explain the
observed rapid luminosity evolution

32 Evolution of the Specic Star Formation Rate
We now turn to the behavior of the specic star for-
mation rates of galaxies There is
in the literature
some divergence about the shape of the SSFR distri-
bution at a given mass and epoch Following Brinch-
mann et al 2004 who claim that the SFR vs mass dis-
tribution of nearby galaxies has a quite narrow distri-
bution Bauer et al 2005 Noeske et al 2007a Peng
et al 2010 and Rodighiero 2011 claim to see a similar
main sequence in the distributions of highredshift ob-
jects The Brinchmann distribution as seen in their Fig-
ure 17 does have a narrow core among low mass galaxies
but even there the 2 tails of the distribution extend out
by  a factor of 102 and among more massive galaxies
with Mgal  1010M even the tight core disappears see
also Fig 15 of Salim et al 2007 The true breadth of the
SSFR distribution can also be seen in the lower redshift
bins of Figure 1 of Feulner et al 2005a Given the wide
range in SFR and SSFR at a given value of Mass and
given that all samples are necessarily incomplete at some
level of SFR the use of a mean value of either quantity
seems of limited value Instead we will use the normal-
ized cumulative distribution of SSFR counting from the
high end If we include all objects in doing the normal-
ization not just those with detected star formation this
distribution should be valid down to the value of SSFR
at which the sample begins to be incomplete
Figure 3a presents the cumulative distribution of SSFR
for galaxies more massive than 4  1010M in 5 redshift
intervals covering 00  z  10 The lowest redshift
group is drawn from the PM2GC sample and the higher
redshift groups are drawn from the IR-ALL and AEGIS
samples As has been noted many times before the dis-
tribution of SSFR moves steadily to higher values with
increasing redshift The models summarized in Figure 1
all predict an increase of SSFR with lookback time but
with a rate of change which decreases with SSFR They
also predict a rather hard upper limit to the observed
SSFR at any epoch unless the SFR is increasing rapidly
as in a burst These are expected to be quite general
conclusions for reasons very similar to those given in
the previous section for the evolution of MB The total
stellar mass of a galaxy is
Mtot  Z t0
SF Rtf dt
The quantity f is the fraction of the mass that remains
in stars rather than returning to the ISM during stellar
evolution The value of f is about 07 for a Salpeter
IMF and somewhat smaller for some other IMFs Then

For the same parameters dlogSSF Rdt will today
t  t0 be about 005Gyr Higher evolutionary rates
are only possible for values of SF Rt0  hSF Ri ie for
galaxies with declining rates of star formation and with
SSF Rt0  hSSF Ri
Figure 3b presents the fraction of galaxies in the sam-
ples in Figure 3a with values of specic star formation
higher than the limiting value expected for constant star
formation rate and a Salpeter IMF This fraction in-
creases from about 2 for local galaxy samples to 21
by z  09 Furthermore Fig 3a shows that the shape

of the distributions of SSFR changes very little at least
out to a redshift of 06 contrary to the expectation that
the highest SSFR galaxies should evolve less rapidly than
those with lower SSFRs
33 Are Starbursts Responsible for the Rapid Evolution
of Star Formation
Observations of both the luminosity function and the
specic star formation rate at earlier epochs show that
these quantities have evolved faster than expectation
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this
high evolution rate The most common suggestion has
been starbursts Beginning with Dressler  Gunn 1983
and Couch and Sharples 1987 starbursts have often
been invoked to drive galaxy evolution particularly in
clusters see also Bekki 1999 Poggianti et al 1999 Miller
et al 2006 Oemler et al 2009 but also in eld galaxies
Le Fevre et al 2000 Bridge et al 2007 Bell et al 2005
Bauer et al 2005 Dressler et al 2009
The main dissent has come from the AEGIS team
Noeske et al 2007a and at higher redshift
Rodighiero et al 2011 which have argued that because
the SFR vs mass relation is narrow and well-dened at
all redshifts only a small number of galaxies could be
undergoing a large burst of star formation at any time
Given the breadth of the SFR vs mass distribution this
test is not particularly sensitive to smaller bursts Nev-
ertheless one can make a very general argument that
although a starburst can substantially change the instan-
taneous star formation rate in a galaxy starbursts can-
not have a signicant eect on the distribution of specic
star formation rates of a population of galaxies In Fig-
ure 4 we present the results from several simulations of
the eect of adding starbursts to a galaxy population
We make the extreme assumption that 100 of galaxies
have starbursts either with an amplitude of 3 times the
average SFR and a duty cycle of 15 or an amplitude of
7 times the average SFR and a duty cycle of 110 Nei-
ther produce a signicant enhancement of the high end of
the SSFR distributions The reason is simple starbursts
cannot by denition change the time averaged SFR
Periods of enhanced SFR must be balanced by periods
of depressed SFR For any reasonably shaped SSFR dis-
tribution the latter eect osets almost completely the
former
This is a suciently important point that it is worth
repeating another way One can contrive any history
of star formation that one wants driven by starbursts
or any other conceivable process However the specic
star formation history is not so easily changed since it
is a ratio which depends in its denominator on the entire
past history of star formation Unless one is observing
a special epoch before which starbursts did not occur
adding bursts of star formation to a galaxys history will
also add mass and therefore will not by itself change the
timeaveraged specic star formation rate Stated yet
another way the SSFR measures the characteristic in-
verse timescale for star formation not the star formation
This is not to say however that starbursts if common
cannot eect the SSFR values of individual galaxies The
red curves in Fig 4 present for the two starburst sce-
narios the fraction of objects at a given value of SSFR
that are observed to be in a starburst Starbursts do not
have a large net eect of the SSFR distribution because
the starburst cycle moves objects to lower as well as to
higher values However those with the highest values at
any time are those currently in a starburst phase Al-
though they do not emphasize the fact Bell et al 2005
nd a factor of two higher merger rate among galaxies
with the highest values of SSFR and Bridge 2005 nd
that at 02  z  13 galaxies with detected 24 m ux
are a factor of 5 more more likely to have close compan-
ions than those without 24 m ux In a forthcoming
paper Oemler et al  in preparation we shall show that
a large fraction of ICBS galaxies with very high values
of SSFR are undergoing starbursts driven by galaxy in-
teractions
34 Are Some Galaxies Young
We have shown that starbursts are an unlikely expla-
nation for the too-rapid evolution of galaxy luminosi-
ties and star formation rates We have argued above
that lowering the mean age of galaxies can explain
the fast evolution of M 
B and Cowie et al 1996 and
Noeske et al 2007b have argued that the same change
Figure 4 The black lines with the scale at the left of the graph
show the eect of starbursts on the distribution of SSFR in a galaxy
population Solid line- Local SSFR dashed line- population with
time averaged SFR of the Local population but galaxies have 31
starbursts with a duty cycle of 15 dotted line- population with 71
starbursts and 110 duty cycle The red lines with the righthand
scale show the fraction of objects in the two starburst scenarios
which are observed in the starburst phase as a function of SSFR
can explain the rapid evolution of the SSFR Feulner
et al 2005b have raised the same possibility In this sec-
tion we will examine this possibility using the ICBS and
local data samples Figure 5a presents the cumulative
distribution of SSFR for galaxies in the Local data set
and the 040  z  060 redshift range in the IR-ALL
data set down to a limiting mass Mgal  4  1010M to
which both data sets are essentially complete We wish
to compare the evolution shown in Fig 5a to the predic-
tion of the exponential and delayed exponential models
as presented in Fig 1 both for an early time and for
reduced ages of formation
The fraction of objects with values of SSFR too high
to explain by earlyformation models is one indicator of
young galaxies but it is an insensitive test since even
quite young galaxies can have low values of SSFR if
the SFRs fall from their peak values suciently rapidly
Furthermore this criterion depends on an absolutely cor-
rect calibration of starformation rates both observed
and predicted by models Instead we will use the evolu-
tion rate of the SSFR distribution as our main tool It
is a characteristic of all of the models in Fig 1 that the
curves of SSFRt diverge with time and never cross
Therefore given a set of galaxies at one epoch ordered
by SSFR evolution with time will change the values of
SSFR but will not change the rank order of the galaxies
Thus the galaxies in the Local sample in Fig 5a at any
given value of f  should have evolved from the galaxies in
the IR-ALL sample at the same value of f  Furthermore
if either set of models correctly describes the behavior of
real galaxies the value of SSF Rto at that value of
f will correspond to a unique  model from which we
can predict the value of SSF Rt at the epoch of the
earlier observations There are two possible exceptions
to these statements Firstly they ignore the growth of
mass with time which will cause some galaxies which are

exponential solid and delayed exponential dashed galaxy evo-
lution models with indicated values of tau and indicated delays of
the start of star formation in Gyr
above the mass limit at the present epoch to be below
the mass limit and excluded from the samples at higher
redshifts However we have simulated the eect of this
on real data samples and nd that it has a negligible
eect on the SSFR distribution Secondly they ignore
the eect of mergers which violate the assumption that
a xed population of objects evolves from one epoch to
another We will return to this issue shortly
We dene ZSSF Rt0  dlogSSF Rdt with
units of Gyr1 and measure its value using the two data
sets in Fig 5a at multiple values of f shown by red cir-
cles In Figure 5b we compare the measured values of Z
at these points with the predictions of the exponential
and delayed exponential models from Fig 1 both for the
early formation epochs heavy solid and dashed lines
and for various delays in the formation epoch lighter
solid and dashed lines Included are typical 1 errors
calculated assuming random subsets drawn from an over-
all distribution of SSFR values with a shape like that
of the observed galaxy samples The results are incon-
sistent with a single epoch of formation for all galaxies
with either set of star formation histories However at
lower values of SSFR beyond the 25th percentile count-
ing from high to low the results lie close to the delayed
exponential earlyformation models At higher values
of SSFR the data move steadily away from the heavy
line suggesting more and more recent epochs of forma-
tion Thus a reasonable conclusion is that most mas-
sive galaxies Mgal  4  1010M are coeval and old
but that about one quarter those with values of SSFR
greater than about 1011 are younger with an epoch
of formation which moves to later times with increasing
To examine the eect of mergers on this result we
perform a Monte Carlo simulation using data from the
IR-ALL sample in the redshift range 020  z  040
We take a merger rate versus redshift and galaxy mass
as described in Xu et al 2012 Equation 9 We assume
that after the merger the mass is the sum of the mass
of the two merging galaxies and that after the merger is
complete and any starburst has decayed the total star
formation rate is the sum of the premerger SFRs of the
components Although this is undoubtedly an oversim-
plication a more elaborate treatment is not justied by
our limited knowledge of the phenomenon With these
assumptions the principal eect is a slight steepening of
the SSFR distribution due to the averaging of the ex-
tremes of low and high SSFR values as pairs of galaxies
combine The eect on Z is shown by the open circles
in Fig 5b Except at very low values of SSFR in which
we are least interested its amplitude is very modest and-
given our ignorance of the details of the process- we shall
ignore it in the remaining analysis
At this point we need to elaborate on what we mean by
delayed formation The behavior of real galaxies which
neither set of models can reproduce is the existence of
galaxies with both high and rapidly falling SSFRs Ex-
ponential models peak at t  tf orm those with high
values of SSFR at later times are those whose SSFR de-
clines slowly Delayed exponential models with arbitrar-
ily high values of  can peak at arbitrarily late times but
like the exponential models those with high values of
SSFR at late times are those with slowly varying SSFR
It is obvious that any models other than contrived cases
seen at special epochs which peak early must have either
low values of SSFR or low values of dSSF Rdt at late
times Only galaxies whose star formation histories peak
at an age of the universe signicantly greater than the
timescales on which star formation rises and falls before
and after the peak can reproduce the behavior seen in
our data These we call young or delayed formation
galaxies It must be emphasized that by delayed forma-
tion we are only talking about a delayed onset of the
bulk of star formation There is no way with existing
data that one can rule out a tail of star formation in all
galaxies extending to quite early times Thus observa-
tions suggesting that there is some old stellar population
in most if not all nearby galaxies Grebel  Gallagher
2004 Orban et al 2008  does not contradict our picture
Cowie et al 1996 and Noeske et al 2007 observe
downsizing not only are some galaxies young but their
age decreases with decreasing mass To examine this
eect we divide our samples by mass Figure 6 re-
peats the analysis in Fig 5 but dividing galaxies into 3
mass ranges 4  1010M  7  1010M 7  1010M 
14  1011M and Mgal  14  1011M There is a
clear divide at approximately Mgal  14  1011M
Galaxies above this limit follow the old delayed ex-
ponential locus but at least some galaxies below this
limit need a range of younger ages Galaxies in the
mass range 7  1010M  14  1011M diverge from
the old locus below the 30th percentile galaxies in the
4  1010M  7  1010M mass range depart from the
old locus below the 40th percentile a very large fraction
of young galaxies indeed Note however that at every
mass less than Mgal  141011M there is a large range
of age with a majority of old coeval galaxies Although
mean age is a function of mass such an averaging hides
a more complicated story

The expected errors in this case are more signicant
than those shown in Figure 5b Evaluating the over-
all signicance of the departure of for example the red
and blue curves from these typical errors is not straight-
forward because the curves are derived from cumulative
distributions and the errors of adjacent points are there-
fore at least partially correlated Instead we perform
Monte Carlo simulations on pairs of distributions drawn
from the same parent population and of the size of our
samples and ask how often the two resulting Z curves
depart from each other at every value of f  by as much
as the pairs of Z curves in Fig 6b We nd that for
example the chance that the red and blue curves were
drawn from the same population is only 2  105 so the
observed dierences are very signicant
of med where med is the median value of  for galax-
ies in the same redshift interval into three parts and
examine the evolution of SSFR for each third The
nearby sample is the PM2GC sample and the distant
sample consists of galaxies in the 4Fields sample with
04  z  06 Because as we have shown the evo-
lution of SSFR depends on galaxy mass and because
the distribution of mass is dependent on local density
Vulcani et al 2012a we weight galaxies in each density
interval by mass to produce weighted distributions with
mass which are the same in all intervals Although the
behavior of galaxies in the lowest third of the density
distribution diers a bit from the others all 3 groups
seem to display the same wide range in formation epochs
and thus provide no evidence that the age distribution
of galaxy populations depends on local density
Figure 7 Same analysis as in Fig 6 but with galaxies from
the PM2GC local sample and the 4-Fields 04  z  06 sample
divided into intervals of local density Blue- lowest third values of
med Green- middle third values of med Red- highest third
values of med
Figure 8 Same analysis as in Fig 6 but with galaxies from the
NGP local sample and the 4Fields 04  z  06 sample divided
between isolated galaxies blue all group members green and
members of groups with 4 or more members red
One might expect that galaxy formation and evolu-
tion would proceed more rapidly in highdensity regions
of the universe than in lowdensity regions eg Cen
2011 Therefore in Figure 7 we test for dependance
of galaxy evolution on local density which we calculate
from the distance to the third nearest neighbor with
mass Mgal  4  1010M We divide the distribution
Figure 8 presents the behavior of the same redshift
intervals analyzed in Figures 6 and 7 now divided by
group membership We have constructed a group cata-
log for the redshift interval 02  z  06 from the 4
Fields sample using the standard Huchra  Geller 1982
friendsoffriends method Galaxies are linked if sepa-
rated by a projected distance on the sky D  Dlim and
a velocity dierence v  vlim
In order to minimize
redshift dependences we use a sample with a xed lim-
iting value M  M   20 We take vlim  350kms1
and Dlim  520C 12kpc where C is the completeness
of the spectroscopic sample as a function of r magni-
tude and eld position With these selection parame-
ters about half of the galaxies are assigned to groups
and half are isolated For a local comparison we have
constructed a group catalog from the NGP sample us-
ing the same selection criteria the PM2GC sample is of
a very narrow strip making the identication of groups
problematic Although the mass distribution varies less
with group membership than with local density Vulcani
et al 2012b we still weight galaxies in the two groups to
produce similar mass distributions In contrast to Figure
7 we see here a clear dierence in behavior with environ-
ment only isolated galaxies appear to be young galaxies
with at least one massive neighbor follow the evolution
expected for an early formation epoch
4 DISCUSSION
The analysis of the previous section indicates the un-
expectedly rapid evolution of star formation cannot be
explained by starbursts but can be understood as a con-
sequence of the delayed formation of some fraction of less
massive galaxies However this analysis has not pro-
vided much quantitative detail on the age distribution
of galaxies Given the innite variety of possible forms
of star formation histories the limited information- dis-
tributions of SSFRs- we have used is insucient to do
so Noeske et al 2007b present one possible scenario-
exponentially declining Bruzual  Charlot models like
those presented in Fig1 with a delay in formation red-
shift of the form 1  zf orm  M 
gal but it is hardly
unique It is also clearly not correct since Fig 6 shows
that at every mass many galaxies appear to be old and
only the fraction of younger objects changes with mass
and Figure 8 suggests that only isolated galaxies may be
younger A more complete description of galaxy forma-
tion is not possible within the limitations of the data we
have considered
There is however more information available The
entire 2dimensional distribution of SSFR-Mass values
of galaxies over the redshift range 00  z  10 plus
the integrated star formation history of galaxies back
the redshifts of order 3 which has been studied by many
workers see Cucciati et al 2012 for references provides
additional constraints In addition if one makes the com-
mon assumption that the dierent structures of bulges
and disks reect dierent timescales for star formation in
these subsystems the distribution of bulgetodisk ratios
of galaxies provide an additional constraint In Paper IV
we will make a start at such a complete analysis using
the distribution of SSFR vs mass and redshift as well
as the history of the specic star formation density with
redshift to constrain the evolution of galaxies with log
normal star formation histories We will therefore defer
all further discussion of this topic to the following paper
One item which we will not address in Paper IV is the
environmental dependance of galaxy ages Figures 7 and
8 seem to be telling dierent stories galaxy age depends
on group membership but not on local galaxy density
These results are not however as inconsistent as they
appear Although the two measures of environment are
correlated the correlation is very broad almost half of
the isolated galaxies fall into the highest two thirds of
relative density and 20 percent of the grouped galaxies
fall into the lowest third of relative density In general
our measure of local density samples a signicantly larger
volume than does our groupisolated criterion This sug-
gests that it is the very local environment which aects
galaxy age a not implausible conclusion Together the
dependance on galaxy mass and group environment sug-
gest that galaxy age might be dependent on only a single
physical parameter total mass within a volume of size
about 05Mpc
The more sophisticated theoretical expectations are
less than clear The models of Cen 2011 produce
more rapid downsizing in denser regions but Cen does
not distinguish between archaeological downsizing and
downsizing in time to use the terminology of Neistein
state that downsizing in
et al 2006 Neistein et al
time the mass-dependent delay in galaxy formation dis-
covered by Cowie et al 1995 cannot be explained with-
out invoking poorly understood hydrodynamic processes
an opinion shared by Fontanot et al 2009 so the con-
cordance of theory and observations is not yet estab-
lished
