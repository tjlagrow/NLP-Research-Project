Abstract We present observations of galaxy environmental dependencies using data
from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey From a combined analysis of the luminosity
function Butcher-Oemler eect and trends in H line strengths we nd support for a
model where galaxy properties are mainly set by initial conditions at the time of their
formation
1 Introduction
Local redshift surveys undertaken to map the three-dimensional distribution of
galaxies and therefore address topics in cosmology are also useful to derive a
sample of local galaxies and analyze their properties such as luminosity functions
and star formation rates Although the current generation of surveys is too local
to be useful for galaxy evolution studies but see descriptions of the DEEP2
and VIMOS surveys in the present volume the 2dF and SDSS are adequate to
obtain an in-depth description of the local world of galaxies
2 The galaxy luminosity function
This is sometimes regarded as a 0th order statistics the simplest characterization
of galaxy populations It is essential to reproduce its shape as a rst step towards
a consistent model of galaxy formation A review of this topic is presented in
Driver  De Propris 2003 Here we compare luminosity functions for the eld
clusters and as a function of local density from the 2dF galaxy redshift survey
since these luminosity functions are derived from the same catalogue of redshifts
and photometry they should share most of the selection biases and therefore
should be fairly comparable to gain a picture of environmental eects on galaxy
luminosities
Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the behaviour of the two relevant param-
eters of the luminosity function as a function of density 8 which is the density
for each galaxy measured within an 8 Mpc sphere We see that
 M  becomes brighter in higher density regions
  becomes steeper in these regions
De Propris et al
 This is essentially due to evolution in the M  and  of early-type galaxies
ie spectroscopically quiescent objects
 There is little or no evolution among late-type galaxies

regimes considered by Croton et al 2003 for early-type galaxies squares and late-
type galaxies triangles
This is reminiscent of the simple model for galaxy evolution presented in
De Propris et al 2003 where galaxies were simply assumed to move from
star-forming to quiescent with little luminosity or density evolution Although
Local redshift surveys and galaxy evolution
this is a very simplistic scenario it appears to reproduce the observations to a
good degree If this is correct i mergers are not necessary to form galaxies
suppression of star formation suces and ii even the blue luminosity of most
massive galaxies is dominated by the underlying old population
3 The Butcher-Oemler eect
A traditional measure of star formation and its variation in clusters is the blue
fraction as dened by Butcher  Oemler 1984 Our sample of clusters lies at
z  011 and is therefore unsuitable to study how the blue fraction evolves but
it allows us to explore how the blue fraction depends on cluster properties and
therefore identify the mechanisms responsible as well as control the selection
eects present in cluster samples at higher redshift
Figure 2 shows that the blue fraction does not strongly depend on cluster
properties such as richness velocity dispersion and Bautz-Morgan type With
proper accounting for errors the blue fraction may not be signicantly dierent
from cluster to cluster The only dependencies are with luminosity the blue
fraction is higher for lower luminosity limits which argues that the blue galaxies
are intrinsically faint and with radius
The above implies that the original claims for a trend in blue fraction with
redshift may have resulted from a selection eect and an underestimate of the
actual errors and that the cause for the suppression of star formation responsible
for the trend in the luminosity function and the H relations shown below may
not be associated with the eects of the cluster environment eg ram stripping
tides harassment
We have explored the Butcher-Oemler eect as a function of the more general
mean density and show that there is a clear relation between lower density and
higher blue fraction of which the clusters represent an extreme Clusters are
simply a continuation of eld trends Figure 3
However as shown in Figure 4 this is not due to star formation being sup-
pressed but simply to a changing fraction of red and blue galaxies consistent
with our simple model for instantaneous suppression of star formation with con-
servation of numbers and luminosity
4 Galaxy ecology The H-environment relation
Balogh et al 2003 have carried this analysis a step further in their study of
trends in H emission with local density from a combined 2dF and SDSS sample
Consistent with the previous ndings they show that
 The population of galaxies is bimodal one population shows star formation
and the other is quiescent
 The star formation rate is largely independent of density the numbers of
star forming and quiescent galaxies vary smoothly and continuously with
density

Fig 2 Dependence of the blue fraction in clusters on redshift luminosity and cluster
properties The top panel on the right shows the dierence between the blue fraction
measured to M   25 lled circles 35 open squares and 45 triangles with
respect to the blue fraction measured to M   15 which is the one used in all other
panels We omit error bars for clarity but show them in the top left panel
 The fraction of star forming galaxies is sensitive primarily to density over
large scales
These results argue that the local environment does not inuence galaxy star
formation rates and therefore that galaxy properties are set at high redshift via
processes involving relatively short timescales This obviously accounts for the
lack of any correlation between the blue fraction and cluster properties
5 A predestination model of galaxy evolution
We present here a speculative scenario for galaxy formation and evolution which
attempts to account for the observations described above

De Propris et al
In our model the properties of galaxies are set by their initial conditions
Galaxies that form in the highest density regions evolve faster and burn all
their gas quickly therefore becoming ellipticals Blue galaxies are a residual
population of star-forming objects which are therefore more prevalent in lower
density regions The fact that the U Cortese et al 2003 and B band luminosity
functions for star-forming galaxies are identical in all environments De Propris
et al 2003 is a necessary consequence of this mechanism
Star formation may be triggered at high redshift in small groups which
evolve into the dense regions of today The likely trigger is close interactions
which have been shown to induce star formation Barton et al 2003 or mergers
between gas-rich galaxies It is unlikely that these mergers have been important
in forming galaxies to z  2 as also shown by the results of the K20 survey
described elsewhere in these proceedings
The above scenario is remarkably similar to the original scenario of galaxy
formation in Gaussian random peaks presented by Bardeen et al 1986 where
the main galaxy properties are set by the initial conditions at the time of their
formation The slow evolution detected in nearly all high redshift surveys with
the possible exception of the Combo-17 results presented elsewhere in this vol-
ume is a strong pointer to this scenario
