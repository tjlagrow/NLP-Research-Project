ABSTRACT
The nature of some GRB host galaxies has been investigated by means of chemical
evolution models of galaxies of dierent morphological type following the evolution of
the abundances of H He C N O -elements Ni Fe Zn and including also the
evolution of dust By comparing predictions with abundance data we were able to
constrain nature and age of GRB hosts We also computed a theoretical cosmic dust
rate including stellar dust production accretion and destruction under the hypothe-
ses of pure luminosity evolution and strong number density evolution of galaxies We
suggest that one of the three GRB hosts is a massive proto-spheroid catched during its
formation while for the other two the situation is more uncertain although one could
perhaps be a spheroid and the other a spiral galaxy We estimated the chemical ages
of the host galaxies which vary from 15 to 320 Myr Concerning the cosmic eective
dust production rate in an unitary volume of the Universe our results show that in the
case of pure luminosity evolution there is a rst peak between redshift z8 and 9 and
another at z  5 whereas in the case of strong number density evolution it increases
slightly from z10 to z  2 and then it decreases down to z0 Finally we found tha
the total cosmic dust mass density at the present time is dust  35  105in the
case of pure luminosity evolution and dust  7  105 in the case of number density
evolution

INTRODUCTION
Most LGRBs are associated with massive stellar explosions
and consequently they are linked to ongoing star formation
Savaglio et al 2009 studying a sample of GRB host galax-
ies HGs concluded that there is no clear evidence that
HGs are peculiar galaxies and that they are instead simi-
lar to normal star-forming galaxies both in the local and in
the early universe For this reason understanding the nature
of HGs provides constraints on the GRBs progenitors the
collapsar model Woosley 1993 Woosley  Heger 2006 pre-
dicts a low metallicity environment typical of dwarf galax-
ies because of the reduced angular momentum loss and mass
loss via strong winds at the surface of the star while in
 E-mailgriecooatsinafit
other progenitor models there is no such an assumption eg
Ouyed et al 2005 Fryer  Heger 2005
Many attempts have been made to characterize the
hosts of GRBs eg Fruchter et al 19992006 Castro
Ceron et al 2006 2010 Le Floch et al 2006 Modjaz
et al 2008 Levesque et al 2010 Perley et al 2013 and
Boissier et al 2013 In particular Berger et al 2003 and
Le Floch et al 2006 using mid-IR and radio observations
showed that some GRB host galaxies are characterized by
a large amount of star formation obscured by dust and in
general they have attempted to understand the properties of
GRB hosts but only few of them have used powerful chem-
ical evolution indicators as we are going to do in this work
Moreover the importance of dust is also conrmed by the
large fraction of GRBs occurring in dusty environments eg
V Grieco et al
Perley et al 2009 2013 Greiner et al 2011 Hatsukade et
al 2012
Dust is present in almost every astrophysical environ-
ment aecting the comprehension of their physical proper-
ties such as their star formation rate and abundance ratios
Dust grains are made up of metals primarily C O Mg Si
Fe Ni S Ca which enriched the interstellar medium ISM
during particular stellar evolutionary phases eg asymp-
totic giant branch AGB stars and core collapse supernovae
Interesting dust evolution studies in galaxies have been
performed by Dwek 1998 Dwek et al 2007 2011 Calura
et al 2008 and Schurer et al 2009 In those papers
models of galactic chemical evolution including dust were
presented The basic idea of identifying GRB host galaxies
by means of chemical evolution models is based on the fact
that galaxies of dierent morphological type should show
dierent abundance patterns Such dierent patterns derive
from their dierent star formation histories SFHs Calura
et al 2009 presented a rst approach were the SFHs of the
HGs of GRBs were derived by comparison between observed
abundances and model results to do that they adopted the
Calura et al 2008 models including dust evolution In the
following years Fan et al 2010 also deduced the nature
of some hosts of GRBs using chemical models but the dust
was not considered Both those papers concluded that the
hosts of the studied GRBs were probably irregular galax-
ies Clearly the presence of dust can aect the abundances
derived from the gas in galaxies and therefore it is very im-
portant to include the possibility of dust condensation in
chemical evolution models
In this paper by adopting the dust evolution as in
Calura et al 2008 we aim at constraining the nature and
SFH of some HGs by means of detailed chemical evolution
models taking into account the variation in the abundance
patterns Moreover we aim at computing the dust evolution
in each type of galaxy including processes of stellar dust pro-
duction accretion of dust onto preexisting grains and dust
destruction As a byproduct we are going to compute the
cosmic eective dust production rate in an unitary volume of
the Universe by taking into account the contributions from
all galaxies
Section 2 describes the chemical evolution models used
in this work and the nucleosynthesis prescriptions in sec-
tion 3 the prescriptions for the supernova rates and the dust
production accretion and destruction rates in galaxies are
presented In section 4 we briey show the observational
data In section 5 the results for dust production accretion
and destruction in galaxies of dierent morphological type
as well the results deriving from the comparison between our
theoretical predictions and observational abundance data of
GRB 081008120327A and 120815 host galaxies are shown
The denition and computation of the cosmic eective dust
production rates in dierent frameworks of galaxy forma-
tion are presented in Section 6 together with the calculation
of the present time cosmic dust density Finally in section
7 some conclusions are drawn
2 THE CHEMICAL EVOLUTION MODELS
We follow the evolution of the abundances of several chem-
ical species and of the dust content of spirals elliptical and
irregular galaxies using detailed self-consistent chemical evo-
lution models able to reproduce the majority of the prop-
erties of the dierent types of galaxies In all models the
instantaneous recycling approximation is relaxed and the
stellar lifetimes are taken into account The models all as-
sume that galaxies form by gas accretion which accumulates
a nal mass called infall mass Mtot
The model takes into account the feedback from SNe
and stellar winds giving rise to a galactic outow when the
gas thermal energy exceeds the binding energy of gas
In our models the SFR is a simple Schmidts 1963 law
t  Gt
where the quantity  is the star formation eciency SFE
namely the inverse of the typical time-scale for star forma-
tion expressed in Gyr1 and it has been varied as a func-
tion of the galaxy morphological type see Section 5 Gt
is the gas mass fraction expressed as Gt  MgastMtot
the ratio between the gas mass and the infall mass Divid-
ing by the infall mass it is only for a normalization purpose
and all the other variables are also normalized in the same
way Because of this t  MgastMtot All the models
used in this paper consider only one gas phase The chemical
evolution equation for a given chemical element i takes the
following form
Git  tXit  Rit  Giinf t  Giwt
where Git  MgastXitMtot  GtXit is the frac-
tional mass of the element i at the time t in the ISM  and
Xit represents the mass fraction of element i in the gas
ie the abundance by mass The rst item on the right hand
side of the equation tXit represents the mass change
of the element i caused by the formation of new stars Rit
corresponds to the material returned through stellar winds
or SN explosions in the ISM The last two terms take into
account the infall of primordial gas Giinf t and the outow
Giwt respectively
In particular the accretion rate of an element i follows
the equation
Giinf t 
A Xiinf et
where Xiinf represents the abundance of the element i in
the infalling gas that we assume to be primordial A is the
normalization constant constrained to reproduce the present
time total mass gas plus stars ie tot and  is the accretion
timescale expressed in Gyr and dened as the characteristic
time at which half of the total mass of the system has been
assembled
The rate of gas lost via galactic winds for each specic
element i is assumed to be proportional to the amount of
gas present at the time t through the free parameter i
Giwt  it
21 Nucleosynthesis prescriptions
We compute in detail the contributions by low mass stars
Type Ia and Type II SNe to the chemical enrichment of the
ISM The main physical quantities related to these processes
are the stellar yields representing the amount of both newly
formed and pre-existing elements ejected into the ISM by
GRB host galaxies
star of mass m contains all the information about stellar
nucleosynthesis for elements either produced or destroyed
inside stars or both Talbot and Arnett 1973 The second
term represents the contribution from binary systems that
become Type Ia supernovae A is the unknown fraction of bi-
nary stars giving rise to SNIa and is xed by reproducing the
observed present time SNIa rate tm2 indicates the lifetime
of the secondary star of the binary system and consequently
the explosion timescale is taken into account The quantity
  M2MB is the ratio between the secondary component
of the binary system ie the less massive one and the total
mass of the system MB  MBm  MBM and f  is the dis-
tribution function of this ratio The third and fourth terms
represent the contribution to dust from single stars in the
mass range MBm  8 and 8  MBM where there are binary
systems producing SNIa single AGB stars and core-collapse
  Gidusttaccr  Gidusttaccr
is the rate at which an ele-
ment i is removed from the ISM gas phase by accretion onto
preexisting dust particles in molecular cloud while accr is
the timescale for the accretion process that will be described
in section 33
  Gidusttdestr rapresents the amount of the element i
returned to the ISM gas phase owing to the dust destroyed
by SNe on the timescale of destruction destr see 34
  Gidusttw takes into account possible ejection of dust
into the inter galactic medium IGM by means of galactic
winds triggered by SNe explosions The wind starts when the
thermal energy of gas equates the binding energy of gas In
our calculations we assume a dierential wind in which the
metals are preferentially lost see Bradamante et al 1998
 the quantities i represent the dust condensation ecien-
cies as dened by Dwek 1998 and are relative to the low
and intermediate mass stars which eject dust through stellar
winds SW the Type II SNe II and the Type Ia SNe Ia
For the model of the ellipticals we assume that after the on-
set of the galactic wind the star formation is quenched and
the galaxy starts evolving passively whereas for spirals and
irregulars the star formation continues even after the wind
31 Supernovae rates
The evolution of dust is strongly dependent on the SN rates
SNRs In our computation we assume as contributors to
the total dust amount of a galaxy both core collapse CC
and Type Ia supernovae CCSNe are divided in Type II and
Ibc SNe in particular Type II SNe originate from single
stars with mass larger than Mw  8M while SNe Ibc come
from Wolf-Rayet WR stars namely stars which have lost
most of their H and He envelope and with masses larger
than MW R  25  40M whose value depends on the ini-
tial stellar metallicity It has been suggested that they could
be both single WR stars and massive stars in binary systems
in the mass range 148-45M Yoon et al 2010 Grieco et
al 2012 Owing to the larger mass of the progenitors CC-
SNe explode on short timescales from few million to several
tenths of million years
Type Ia SNe are believed to originate from low and in-
termediate mass stars in particular from C-O white dwarfs
in binary systems In particular to describe Type Ia su-
pernova progenitors we assume the single degenerate SD
scenario by Whelan  Iben 1973 In this scenario a C-O

stars of all masses at their death
The yields used in this paper are as follows

masses 08M 6 m 6 8M we make use of the yields pro-
vided by van den Hoek  Groenewegen 1997 as a function
of metallicity
ii For massive stars ie with masses larger than 8M
and Type Ia SNe we adopt the empirical yields suggested by
Francois et al 2004 which are substantially based on the
Woosley  Weaver 1995 and Iwamoto et al 1999 yields
respectively and are tuned to best t the abundances in the
Solar Neighborhood
3 DUST MODEL
According to Dwek 1998 Calura et al 2008 and Pipino
et al 2011 the equation describing the evolution of the
element i in the dust is similar to the equation 2 Let us
dene Xidustt as the abundance by mass of the element i
at the time t locked up in the dust the quantity Gdusti 
Xdusti Gt represents the normalized mass of the element i
at the time t in the dust By means of the following equation
it is possible to understand how a specic chemical element
evolves in the dust
Gidustt  tXidustt  Ridustt   Gidusttaccr
  Gidusttdestr   Gidusttw
 Ridustt describes the enrichment rate of the element i
where each term of the equation corresponds to a contribu-
tion coming from a dierent progenitor

The rst term on the right takes into account the enrichment
due to stars in the ML  MBm mass range where ML 
08M is the minimum mass contributing at a given time
t to chemical enrichment and MBm is the minimum total
binary mass allowed for binary systems giving rise to Type
Ia SN 3M while the mass MBM  16M represents the
maximum total mass for a binary system to give rise to a SN
Ia 8  8M see Matteucci  Greggio 1986 The initial
mass function IMF used is the Salpeter 1955 one
m  m1135
The quantity Qmit  m where m is the lifetime of a
V Grieco et al
white dwarf accretes mass from a non-degenerate compan-
ion until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass 14M and
explodes via C-deagration leaving no remnant Type Ia SNe
end their lives on timescales ranging from  003 Gyr up to
an Hubble time or more and consequently the SNIa rate is
related to the past star formation history SFH of a galaxy
whereas the CCSNe reect the birth rate of massive stars
ie the galactic star formation rate SFR For this reason
dierent types of galaxies have dierent SNRs
The total SNR used in our models is the sum of the
three individual rates that may be approximated as

The SN Ibc rate is composed by a rst term evaluat-
ing the single progenitor channel and a second integral that
takes into account the contribution from WRs in binary sys-
tem The factor F represents the fraction of massive binary
stars producing Type Ibc SNe This parameter is chosen
to be equal to 015 see Calura  Matteucci 2006 This
value is motivated by the facts that half of the massive stars
are possibly in binary systems and the fraction of massive
stars in close binary system is  30 ie similar to the
close binary frequency predicted for low mass systems Jef-
fries  Maxted 2005 Therefore the estimated value for
this parameter is F  05  03  015
32 Dust production
There are still many uncertainties in the yield of dust from
SNe and AGB stars The general denition of dust grains
divide the elements that suer depletion into dust ie re-
fractory elements into silicate dust composed by O Mg
Si S Ca Fe and Ni and into carbon dust composed only
Following Dwek 1998 the dust sources considered in
our work are
 Low and Intermediate mass stars LIMS in these stars
dust is produced during the AGB phase We assume that
dust formation depends mainly on the composition of the
stellar envelopes If XO and XC represent the O and C
mass fractions in the stellar envelopes respectively we
assume that stars with XOXC  1 are producers of silicate
dust ie dust particles composed by O Mg Si S Ca
Ni Fe On the other hand C rich stars characterized by
XOXC  1 are producers of carbonaceous solids
carbon dust Draine 1990 Being Miej m and Midustm
the total ejected mass and the dust mass formed by the
stars as functions of the initial mass m for the element i
respectively we assume that for stars with XOXC  1
MCdustm  SW
C  MCej m  075MOej m
with SW
C  1 and
Midustm  0
for all the other elements For stars with XOXC  1

Midustm  SW
i Miej m
with SW
i  1 for Mg Si S Ca Ni Fe and
MOdustm  16Pi SW
i Miej mi
with i being the mass of the i element in atomic
mass units
 Supernovae SNe SNe are potentially the most impor-
tant source of interstellar dust Core collapse supernovae see
section 31 and in particular Type II supernovae SNe II are
considered to be one of the main grain production sources
in the Universe eg Nozawa et al 2003 Assuming that all
the refractory elements precipitate with a mean eciency of
50 a typical 25M SN can produce about 05M of dust
Woosley  Weaver 1995 Nomoto et al 2006 The rst
evidence for dust condensation was observed in SN 1987A
Danziger et al 1989 Lucy et al 1989 formation of dust
was then observed in several CCSNe ie SN 2003gd Meikle
et al 2007 2004et Kotak et al 2009 2004dj Szalai et
al 2011 2007od Andrews et al 2010 and Type Ibc SN
2006jc Nozawa et al 2008 Mattila et al 2008 Tominaga
et al 2008 and Sakon et al 2009 with an estimated mass
of recently formed dust between 105
From a theoretical point of view the amount of dust formed
after a CCSN explosion was evaluated by the models of
Kozasa et al 1989 Todini  Ferrara 2001 and Nozawa et
al 2003 in the range 01  1M This prediction was con-
rmed by numerical models of Bianchi  Schneider 2007
Kozasa et al 2009 and Silvia et al 2010 The discrep-
ancy between observations and theories is still unclear and
also the study of SN remnants could not solve the question of
the amount of dust produced by SNe Using far-infrared and
sub-millimeter data many groups estimated the amount of
dust in Cas A Dunne et al 2003 Krause et al 2004 Rho
et al 2008 Their results varied between 002 and 2M
while the values for Kepler SNR showed dierencies from
01  3 M Morgan et al 2003 down to 5  104M Blair
et al 2007 Recently Matsuura et al 2011 report far-IR
and sub-mm observations of SN1987A in the Large Magel-
lanic Cloud The observations revealed the presence of cold
dust grains with a temperature of Td  1723 K The inten-
sity and spectral energy distribution of the emission suggests
a dust mass of 04  07 M
It has been supposed that not only CCSNe but also SNeIa
 103M
can be possible producers of dust grains especially Fe grains
Tielens 1998
Following Calura et al 2008 we assume the same prescrip-
tions for both SNe types

There are still many uncertainties on the amount of dust
produced by Type Ia SNe However Gomez et al 2012
on the basis of Herschel PACS and SPIRE photometry at
70  500m have reported the existence of dust in two Type
Ia SN remnants Kepler and Tycho In particular they de-
tected a warm dust component in Keplers remnant with
temperature Td  824
103M
similarly for the Tychos remnant they detected warm dust
at Td  905
6 K and mass Md  3108

 103M
33 Dust accretion
Dust grains can grow by accretion of metals present in the
ISM onto preexisting grain cores within dense molecular
clouds Dwek 1998 Inoue 2003 There are more obser-
vations indicating the existence of large micrometre-sized
dust grains in dense molecular clouds and suggesting a need
for signicant dust growth in the early Universe Pagani et
al 2010 Michalowski et al 2010 Moreover dust growth
appears to dominate over dust destruction also in the lo-
cal present-day Universe Hirashita 1999 Inoue 2003 Hi-
rashita  Kuo 2011 other evidence for dust accretion comes
from the observed infrared emission of cold molecular clouds
Flagey et al 2006
Following Dwek 1998 we consider that the key param-
eter in dust accretion is the dust accretion timescale that for
a given element i can be expressed as an increasing function
of the dust mass
accr  0i1  fi
Gdusti
For the timescale 0i typical values span from  5107
yr of the order of the lifetime of a typical molecular cloud
up to  2  108 yr In this paper we assume that the
timescale 0i is constant for all elements with a value of
5  107 yr

same solar abundances namely those of Asplund et al 2009
34 Dust destruction
The main mechanism for dust destruction is by sputtering
in the high interstellar shocks driven by SNe McKee 1989
Jones et al 1994 Following Dwek et al 2007 the dust-
destruction timescale is independent of the dust mass and
equal to
destri 
 mISM  RSN
where gas is the gas mass density  mISM  is the ef-
fective ISM mass that is completely cleared of dust by each
SN event and RSN is the sum of core collapse and type Ia
SN rates Dwek et al 2007 consider the grain destruc-
tion eciency corresponding to the range of uncertainty
in the lifetime of the interstellar dust grains as an un-
known and adopt  mISM  as a free parameter of the
model Regarding the Milky Way like galaxies for values of
n0  01  10cm3 corresponding to the average density of
the Galactic ISM they get  mISM   1100 - 1300 M
for an equal mix of silicate and graphite grains
4 THE HOST SAMPLE
In order to constrain the SF history of the HGs we have
chosen from the literature the following HGs with detailed
observed abundance data GRB 081008 DElia et al 2011
120327A DElia et al 2014 and 120815 Kruhler et al
2013 In Table 1 are shown the observational data for each
HGs studied in our analysis Concerning the OFe and
AlFe abundances of GRB 081008 rst column these val-
ues are considered as lower limits because of the lines sat-
uration see DElia et al 2011 for more details The same
problem is in the C O and Al abundances in fact in the
DElia et al 2014 paper the authors warn the reader ex-
plaining that despite the highly saturated CII 1334 OI
1039 OI 1302 and AlII 1670 transitions have not been
excluded from the analysis because they are the only lines
describing CII OI and AlII

5 MODEL RESULTS
We run several models for galaxies of dierent morphological
type In particular in Table 2 are summarized the param-
eter sets of each specic model with the dust prescription
as described in Section 3 the two ellipticals models E00
E01 describe the evolution of massive spheroids the model
S00 represents a typical spiral galaxy Milky Way-like and
model C00 a typical irregular model In the rst column
is the infall mass of the system Mtot ie the nal total
assembled mass if nothing is lost in the second column is
the eciency of star formation SFE which characterizes
the dierent galaxy types and nally in the third column
the dust yields i i  C S Si M g Ca F e N i for Type
Ia and core collapse SNe see section 32 are shown Note
that for elliptical galaxies we show two models with dierent
infall mass and star formation eciency SFE One of the
most common assumptions used in this work is the increase
of the SFE with the galactic mass among dierent morpho-
logical galaxy types This assumption was rst suggested
by Matteucci 1994 to explain the increase of the MgFe
ratio with galactic mass in ellipticals downsizing in star for-
mation in fact dierent SFEs produce dierent SFRs as
shown in Figure 1 and dierent abundances and abundance
ratios In Figure 1 are shown the SFRs of model E00 S00
and C00 as functions of the galactic time Note that in model
E00 the star formation stops after the onset of the galactic
wind at tW  05 Gyr These three galaxy models will rep-
resent typical galaxies for each morphological since now on
although for ellipticals we adopt also model E01 as repre-
sentative of a very massive spheroid We recall here that
the models presented are very similar to those described in
Calura et al 2008 In that paper as a sanity check for the
models it was shown that the spiral model when applied
to the solar region could reproduce the observed depletion
pattern in the local interstellar cloud Kimura et al 2003
So we adress the interested reader to the Calura et al2008
paper for an extensive discussion on this point Our present
model for a spiral represents an average spiral galaxy but if
applied to the solar neighbourhood it predicts exactly the
same values of Figure 3 of Calura et al 2008 By the way
the more recent dust to metal ratio derived by De Cia et al
2013 for the solar vicinity is also in good agreement with
our results
51 The dust rates in galaxies
As the dust content in the Universe is the result of dier-
ent and competitive processes we study the individual con-
tribution of accretion destruction and production in each
morphological type of galaxy using the model E00 with
Mtot  1011M and SFE10 Gyr1 for an elliptical the
model S00 with Mtot  5  1010M and SFE1 Gyr1 for a
spiral and nally the model C00 with Mtot  5  109M and
SFE01 Gyr1 for an irregular galaxy We focus on the
eects that dierent star formation histories have on the
evolution of the chemical abundances in the ISM and how
these abundances are aected by dust in galaxies of dierent
morphological type as well as on the dierent competitive
rates involving the dust In particular understanding how
the dust rates evolve in time is important in the computation
of the global amount of dust and the cosmic rate inferred
from our models The main assumption concerning the dust
rate is on the dust yields describing the fractions of each
element followed in our chemical evolution code which is
condensed into dust and restored into the ISM by low and
intermediate mass stars Type Ia and II SNe The prescrip-
tion used to infer the dust production rate are summarized
in Table 2 The rate of dust production in units of Myr1
is shown in 2 and describes the amount of dust produced
during the whole galactic evolution for the elliptical  spiral
and irregular galaxy model In Figures 3 and 4 are shown
the rates of accretion and destruction respectively in unit
of Myr1 as functions of time for the same models shown
in Figure 2 and with the same color set
As one can see from Figures 2 3 and 4 the rate of
dust production in ellipticals is maximum at the beginning
of their evolution but also the destruction rate is maximum
since they both depend on the SFR which is assumed to be
very high in the rst phases of the evolution of these objects
see Fig 1 The dust accretion rate instead is quite high in
spirals when the SFR reaches a maximum whereas accretion
is active in ellipticals only during the starburst and it stops
after the occurrence of a wind which devoids the galaxy of
gas and dust On the other hand the rate of destruction
of dust in ellipticals continue even after the star formation
has stopped since it depends on SN explosions and Type Ia
SNe are active until the present time even in absence of star
formation These dierent behaviours are responsible for the
shape of the cosmic eective dust production rate that will
be described in the next Section
52 Abundance ratios
In order to understand the dierent behaviour of the chemi-
cal evolution models developed here we compare our model
results with the abundances measured in the hosts of the
three GRBs considered Our main goal was to derive the
history of star formation and therefore the nature of the
hosts comparing the predictions of XFe vsFeH for sev-
eral chemical elements C N O Mg S Si Ni and Zn
Among these species N and Zn are not aected by dust
while all the others together with iron contribute to the
total amount of dust
In Figure 5 we show the results for the host of GRB
081008 at z  1968 studied by DElia et al 2011 In order
to assess the importance of dust in this kind of analysis in
Figure 5 only are shown the predictions for  -elements
Zn and Ni relative to Fe both in the models with dust left
column and without dust right column It is worth noting
that while the ratio SiFe does not change in the two cases

due to the fact that both elements are depleted in dust for
other ratios such as ZnFe the situation is dierent For
example the curve relative to the irregular galaxy is much
lower in the case without dust depletion The reason for that
resides in the fact that Zn is not refractory whereas Fe is
In particular in the irregular model the amount of Fe in
dust is large due to the less ecient dust destruction pro-
cess relative to the other galaxy types This is because the
destruction rate depends on the SFR which is quite low in
irregularsTherefore this implies that at any given metallic-
ity the ZnFe ratio increases relative to the case with no
dust depletion On the other hand in the spiral and ellipti-
cal models the ZnFe is not much altered since they are
characterised by a dust destruction rate which is at least
comparable to the accretion rate In the case without dust
the models are allabove the data and this trend suggests
that the subtraction of Fe by dust is necessary to explain
the data Looking at all the abundance ratios together in
Figure 5 we cannot derive a rm conclusion on the nature
of the host of this GRB in fact while the NiFe ratio is
inconsistent with all curves the SiFe and ZnFe seem to
indicate a spiral galaxy
In Figure 6 are shown the predictions and the data for
the host of GRB 120327A at z  281 studied by DElia et
al 2014 In this case we show only the models with dust
for several elements Concerning N and Zn it is possible to
see an inversion in the models the irregular galaxy model
C00 predicts larger N and Zn abundances with respect to
the Fe than the other two models To understand the reason
of this behaviour we need to remember that N and Zn are
not aected by dust while Fe is strongly depleted Indeed
the higher is the star formation eciency of a galaxy the
higher is the dust grain destruction Therefore the model
with lower SFE green solid line predicts higher abundances
in these two particular cases The trends of SiSZnFe vs
FeH seem to suggest that the host galaxy is a system
with high mass and SFR namely either a spiral or a proto-
spheroid Concerning the NFe ratio it should be said that
the N yields are still uncertain and in particular the sec-
ondaryprimary nature of this element In particular here
N is considered secondary from massive stars while there
are suggestions that N could be produced in a primary fash-
ion in massive stars but only at very low metallicity see
Chiappini et al 2006 If this is true it could change the
shapes of the models
Finally in Figure 7 we report the results for the host of
GRB 120815at z  236 observed by Kruhler et al 2013
the elements analyzed here are Si S Ni and Zn and all seem
to indicate again a massive spheroid with strong SF In fact
to best t the abundances in this host we adopted model
E01 with SFE20Gyr1 which is the maximum value we
explored It is interesting to note the high value of ZnFe
which means that a higher quantity of dust is present along
the line of sight of this GRB
In our analysis although many uncertainties are still
present in the adopted stellar yields and in the observa-
tional data and no rm conclusions on the GRB hosts can
be drawn two of the three GRB host galaxies taken into ac-
count seem to favor either a spiral or a spheroidal host while
the third GRB GRB120815 seems to be more condently
hosted by a proto-spheroid This result if conrmed in the
future by more data would be in contrast with the claim
that most of the HGs are small star-forming and metal-
poor galaxies see eg Christensen et al 2004 Fruchter
et al 2006 and Levesque et al 2010 Probably the appar-
ent discrepancy is due to the galaxy sample used to infer
the HGs properties composed mainly of low redshift ob-
jects z  2 In particular recent works based on high
redshift surveys seem to suggest a more complex view eg
Kruhler et al 2011 Hunt et al 2011 Savaglio et al 2012
Elliott et al 2013 Perley et al 2013 where the major-
ity of the HGs seem to suer strong star formation This
result is not unexpected recalling that GRBs are associ-
ated with the death of massive and short-lived stars that
trace the star formation inside the host The explanation
lies in the evolutionchanging of the star forming tracers as
a function of redshift in the local universe the star forma-
tion is mainly traced by small blue galaxies while at early
epochs it is dominated by massive spheroids and elliptical
galaxies Further evidence in favor of this hypothesis comes
from the study of the so called dark GRBs These GRBs
are found at high redshift and they have in general a high
metallicity This is a very interesting fact suggesting that
these GRBs arise from active star formation in high redshift

massive spheroids Since ellipticals show in general old stars
that means that we are catching ellipticals in formation The
characteristics behavior of Fe ratios in spheroids shows
a long plateau where they are overabundant relative to Fe
and the Sun
This is due to the time-delay model which explains the
behaviour of abundance ratios on the basis of the produc-
tion of dierent elements in dierent stars with dierent
timescales In particular -elements are mainly produced
in CCSNe restoring them on short timescales whereas Fe
is produced mainly in Type Ia SNe and restored on a large
range of timescales going from 30 Myr to a Hubble time
Matteucci 2001 2012 This implies that if the SFR is very
ecient the CCSNe can produce a substantial amount of Fe
by themselves and when Type Ia SNe start restoring the bulk
of Fe the abundance of this element in the ISM is already
high This produces high Fe ratios at high metallicity
The contrary occurs when the SFR is quite low the enrich-
ment of Fe from core-collapse SNe is very modest and when
Type Ia SNe start to restore the bulk of Fe the abundance
of this element in the ISM is still quite low This produces
low Fe ratios at low metallicity Therefore the diagrams
XFe vs FeH can be in principle very useful tools to
infer the nature and the ages of unidentied objects
53 Age determination
In the chemical evolution models the abundance ratios be-
tween two elements formed on dierent timescales can be
used as cosmic clocks and provide us with information on
the roles of LIMS and SNe in the enrichment process Mat-
teucci 2001 As already mentioned the study of abundance
ratios such as Fe is quite useful since the -elements
are produced on short timescales by Type II SNe whereas
the Fe-peak elements and nitrogen are produced on long
timescales by Type Ia SNe and low and intermediate-mass
stars respectively we use the abundance ratios of elements
formed on dierent timescales to set important constraints
on the age and the nature GRB HGs
We dene the age of the galaxy Agal as the time passed
between the galaxy formation epoch and the GRB observa-
tion time this gives us a quantitative measure of the time
required for the galaxy to evolve and reach at the time of
observation of the GRB the chemical abundances observed
during the afterglow episode Practically it is possible to in-
fer it from the simultaneous comparison between the Fe
vs FeH and the same ratio as a function of the galactic
time or redshift in a CDM cosmological framework Ap-
plying the method to the three GRBs analyzed in this paper
we nd an age of 50 Myr for the galaxy hosting the GRB
120327A 032 Gyr for the GRB081008 host and 15Myr for
the GRB120815 host These young ages indicate that we nd
GRBs to be young galaxies namely galaxies in which the
star formation is very active probably suering their rst
major star formation episode but they are not necessary
typical of the main population of galaxies that could have
started forming stars already much before
6 THE COSMIC EFFECTIVE DUST
PRODUCTION RATE
The cosmic rate is dened in an unitary comoving volume of
the Universe This denition is necessary to study the rate at
high redshift where the morphology of the observed galaxies
is not known The cosmic rate refers in fact to a mixture
of galaxies which can be dierent at every redshift In par-
ticular in order to evaluate the amount of dust observed at
high redshift we have to take into account the cosmic dust
cycle dust is produced in stars and it is then blown o in
a slow wind or a massive star explosion The dust is then
recycled in the clouds of gas between stars and some of it is
consumed when the next generation of stars begins to form
in units of
Myr1Mpc3 by adopting the same method applied to the
computation of cosmic star formation rate as described in
the paper of Grieco et al 2012a In that paper the cosmic
SFR CSFR has been computed by taking into account the
SF histories of galaxies of dierent morphological type as
those shown in Fig 1
compute the
cosmic dust
In particular the CSFR was dened as
CSF R  Xk
kt  n
k Myr1M pc3
where the SFRs have been then convolved with the number
density for each type of galaxy The quantity n
k is the galaxy
number density expressed in units of Mpc3 and k identies
a particular galaxy type In the Grieco et al 2012a paper
the main assumption was that the galaxy number density is
constant in time and equal to the present time one for each
galaxy type
Here we dene in the same way the cosmic dust rate
 Gktprod   Gktaccr   Gktdestr  n
CDR  Xk
where  Gktprod is the total production rate of all the el-
ements considered in the dust model O Mg Si S Ca Ni
Fe and  Gktaccr and  Gktdestr are the total accretion
and destruction rates respectively
In order to study dierent scenarios for the evolution of
galaxy number density here we assume
k  nk0  1  zk
as suggested by Vincoletto et al 2012 In particular we
explore two competitive scenarios
i the pure luminosity evolution PLE corrisponding to
the case proposed in the Grieco et al 2012a the CDR is
obtained by assuming that all galaxies started forming stars
at the same time and that there is no evolution in the galaxy
number density from early epoch to the present time As a
consequence k  0 and n
ii Thedensity evolution scenario DE where the  pa-
rameter evolves with redshift as shown in Table 3 where
the value of nk0 the same in both cases and the values of
k for each galaxy type are reported This particular combi-
nation of values is selected in order to obtain a CSFR which
reproduces the trend of a hierarchical galaxy formation sce-
nario eg Menci et al 2004 In this picture the majority
of ellipticals formed in a large redshift range and by mergers

of spirals with only a small percentage of them forming by
means of a strong starburst at high redshift Clearly the CS-
FRs for the two scenarios are extreme cases which predict
completely dierent galaxy formation patterns see Fig 6 of
Grieco et al 2012a where both cases are shown Because
of this we checked that the integrals of the CSFRs in the
two cases give a similar stellar density at the present time
In Figure 8 we show the predicted cosmic eective
dust production rate as a function of redshift black solid
line which includes production accretion and destruction
for each galaxy type This cosmic eective dust production
rate expressed in Myr1M pc3 here has been computed
by means of eq 14 under the assumption of no number den-
sity evolution of galaxies We remind that with no number
density evolution we predict a very high star formation rate
at high redshift due to the starbursts occurring during the
early phases of the proto-spheroid formation see Grieco et
al 2012a In the same plot are also shown separately the
cosmic stellar dust production dust accretion and dust de-
struction rates as functions of time Fixing the redshift of
galaxy formation at zf  10 the predicted total cosmic ef-
fective dust production rate black curve shows a a peak at
very high redshift followed by a decrease and then another
higher peak at z  5
This behaviour is due to the predominance of proto-
spheroids at high redshift where the early high SN produc-
tion induces rst an increase in the dust rate but then a
decrease due to the high destruction rate related to the SNe
themselves The peak at z  5 is then due to the predomi-
nance of the star formation rate in the spirals because since
then in this scenario the ellipticals evolve passively The
cosmic eective dust production rate then decreases strongly
for z  5 down to redshift z  45 and stays constant af-
terwards until z  0 It is interesting to note that accretion
and destruction rates almost compensate each others during
the whole cosmic time In Figure 9 we show instead the cos-
mic dust rates as functions of redshift in the case of strong
number density evolution It is interesting to note that the
cosmic eective dust production rate increases slightly from
high redshift down to z  2 and then decreases down to
z  0 In general the evolution of the eective dust produc-
tion rate is smoother than in the PLE case Clearly the two
dierent galaxy evolution scenarios produce dierent results
concerning the cosmic dust evolution
Finally integrating in time the cosmic eective dust
production rate shown in Figures 8 and 9 we can obtain
the cumulative cosmic dust mass density in the Universe as
a function of redshift dustMM pc3 In a CDM cos-
mological frame with the critical density being crit 
 136  1011 MM pc3 for a Hubble constant of
70kms1M pc1 we can compute dust and its evolution
as a function of redshift as shown in Figure 10 for the two
scenarios The present time values of dust from Figure 10
are dustP LE  dust
 35  105 for the PLE scenario
and dustDE  dust
 70  105 for the DE scenario
Fukugita 2011 estimated a present time cosmic dust
density produced by stars in the Universe of dust 
96  106 whereas the value estimated from observations is
 9  106 Other estimates Loeb  Haiman 1997 Corasan-
iti 2007 Inoue  Kamaya 2004 Fukugita 2011 Menard 
Fukugita 2012  all suggest a value between 105 and 106
Our values are higher than these estimates and the rea-

son could be that our stellar dust production is probably
overestimated in particular the assumed yield of dust from
SNeIa could be overestimated since there is no clear obser-
vational evidence for dust production in these SNe However
we checked the eect of suppressing Type Ia SNe as dust
producers and the eect on dust is negligible On the other
hand it is reasonable that the observational estimate of the
cosmic dust density is a lower limit Finally the fact that
dust is larger by a factor of two in the DE scenario is prob-
ably due to the fact that spiral galaxies dominate at vari-
ance with the PLE scenario where the number of spheroids
is comparable to spirals In the PLE scenario the ellipti-
cal galaxies evolve very quickly and their star formation is
quenched by galactic winds whereas in the DE scenario el-
lipticals form by mergers of spirals where star formation con-
tinues until the present time and the dust production evolves
more smoothly Therefore in the DE case more dust is ex-
pected Moreover a slightly higher cosmic density of stars is
predicted for the DE scenario We nd   0005 for the
PLE case and   0006 for the DE case In Fukugita 
Peebles 2004 this quantity is estimated to be   0003
7 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we present a method based on chemical evo-
lution models to identify the hosts of GRBs Our idea comes
from the following considerations if GRBs are produced by
the collapse of massive stars they are presumably originat-
ing in galaxies where the bulk of massive star formation is
taking place From an observational point of view almost in
all the cases where the galaxy hosting the GRBs is observed
the burst position suggests that GRBs originate in regions
where star formation is taking place Bloom et al 2002 In
this context the determination of the nature of GRB host
galaxies and measurements of their star formation rate not
only provide evidence in favour of or against the collapsar
model but also provide insight on the nature and origin of
star formation in the early Universe
We have presented a comparison between predicted
and observed abundances and abundance ratios in some
galaxies hosting GRBs GRB081008 GRB120327A and
GRB120815 To do that we have adopted detailed chem-
ical evolutionary codes for galaxies of dierent morpholog-
ical type including dust evolution The second aim of this
study was to understand the eect of dust on the observed
abundance patterns and to make predictions on the cosmic
dust content as a function of the cosmic epoch
Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows
 We have studied the evolution of the abundances of C N
O Mg Si S Ni and Zn in galaxies of dierent galaxies ellip-
ticals spirals irregulars Our results suggest that one of the
galaxies hosting GRB120815 is probably a massive proto-
spheroid catched during the active star formation phase
whereas for the other two galaxies hosting GRB120327A
and GRB081008 no rm conclusion can be drawn although
some of the data seem to suggest spiral or proto-spheroid
systems with high mass and star formation rate In order to
derive better conclusions we would need more precise stellar
and dust yields In particular for some chemical elements
the stellar yields are still quite uncertain see Romano et al
2010 The result of GRB120815 is particularly important
since it is the rst time that abundances measured in hosts of
GRBs indicate early type galaxies Our result if conrmed
by more precise data suggest that GRBs can be hosted in
any type of galaxy suering active star formation Obviously
local spheroids which do not show any active star formation
cannot host GRBs We have also estimated the ages of the
GRB hosts from chemical evolution and found that they are
all young with ages ranging from 15 to 320 Myr
 We have shown that it is very important to include dust
in the chemical evolution of galaxies although many uncer-
tainties are still present in the recipes for the formation and
destruction of dust Here we have considered core-collapse
SNe AGB stars and Type Ia SNe We stress that the dust
is produced very early in the evolution of galaxies since CC-
SNe have lifetimes from few million to several tenths of mil-
lion years and the massive AGB stars 7-8 M have life-
times of the order of 25-40 Myr Valiante et al 2009 also
showed the importance of taking into account AGB stars
to explain the dust in high redshift QSOs Another possible
source of dust is the condensation of dust grains in quasar
winds Elvis et al 2002 which has also been supported by
observations Markwick-Kemper et al 2007 We did not in-
clude this source here since Pipino et al 2011 have shown
that it contributes negligibly to the total dust production in
a massive elliptical which is the typical QSO host
 We have computed the cosmic eective dust production
rate namely the rate of net dust production in an uni-
tary volume of the Universe by adopting the results of our
models and assuming either no number density evolution or
strong number density evolution of galaxies as suggested
by the hierarchical clustering scenario for galaxy formation
They represent two extreme cases The cosmic star forma-
tion rate in these two scenarios see Grieco et al 2012a is
dierent but the present time cosmic stellar density which
is the integral of the CSFR is roughly the same To com-
pute the cosmic eective dust production rate we took into
account the rates of production from stars destruction and
accretion of dust in galaxies of dierent morphological type
We assumed as a redshift of galaxy formation zf  10 Our
results show that in the pure luminosity evolution frame-
work there are two peaks one very close to the galaxy for-
mation redshift and another stronger one at z  5 Then the
dust rate decreases down to z0 On the other hand in the
number density evolution framework the dust rate increases
slightly from the beginning to z  2 and then decreases
down to z0
 Finally we have estimated the cosmic dust density in the
Universe at the present time dust  dustcrit in both
scenarios and the results are  35  105 in the case of
pure luminosity evolution and  7  105 in the case of num-
ber density evolution of galaxies Previous estimates Loeb
 Haiman 1997 Corasaniti 2007 Inoue  Kamaya 2004
Fukugita 2011 Menard  Fukugita 2012 had suggested
dust  106  105 Our values are larger than previous
estimates and the reasons for this can be found in an over-
estimate of the dust production in our galaxy models due
either to too large dust yields from stars SNeII Ia and
AGB or to the poor knowledge of the other processes in-
voving dust such as destruction and accretion On the other
hand we cannot exclude that the amount of observed dust
is underestimated Therefore these particular results should
be taken with caution
To conclude it is worth noticing that in our analysis
two of the three GRB host galaxies taken into account are
well tted by a massive proto-spheroid model This result
seems to be in contrast with the claim that most of the HGs
GRB host galaxies
are small star-forming and metal-poor galaxies Probably
the apparent discrepancy is due to the galaxies sample used
to infer the HGs properties composed mainly of low redshift
objects z  2 The explanation for this dierence lies in the
evolutionchange of the star forming galaxies as a function of
redshift in the local Universe the star formation is mainly
traced by small blue galaxies while at early epochs it is
dominated by massive proto-spheroids
