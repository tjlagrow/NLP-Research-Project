In a recent multiwavelength study of galaxies at z  2 by Daddi
Abstract
et al 2007ab it is shown that galaxies with a Mid-IR excess most likely harbor
a Compton-thick AGN thus bringing to  13 the fraction of z  2 galaxies
hosting an AGN This nding opens a number of intriguing issues concerning the
concomitant growth of galaxies and supermassive black holes AGN feedback
and downsizing at the cosmic epoch of most intense star formation and nuclear
activity
Introduction
The current supermassive black hole SMBH and galaxy co-evolution paradigma
rests on three main arguments namely
 Virtually all massive spheroids host a SMBH
 The SMBH to stellar spheroid mass ratio MSMBHMspheroid is  103 within
a factor of two known as the Magorrian ratio Magorrian et al 1998 Ferrarese
et al 2006
 We may need AGN Feedback to expell residual gas in spheroids switch-o
star formation and start making the passively evolving galaxies at z  2 eg
Granato et al 2001 Bower et al 2006
This paper presents recent evidence on SMBHgalaxy coevolution at z  2
ie at the peak of both galaxy growth and AGN activity as derived from a recent
in depth study of a sample of BzK-selected KVega  22 starforming galaxies in
the GOODS Fields in the range 14  z  25 Daddi et al 2007ab At these
redshifts these galaxies account for  23 of the total stellar mass and for a
major fraction of the total star formation rate
2 Starforming and Mid-IR Excess Galaxies at 14z25
Star formation rates SFR in high redshift galaxies can be estimated in a num-
ber of ways eg using the rest-frame UV or the observed 24 m 70 m and
sub-mm uxes or Radio and soft X-Ray data Daddi et al 2007a have shown
that for their sample of  1000 z  2 galaxies all these SFR indicators agree
with each other within the errors with one notable exception the SFR estimated

from SpitzerMIPS 24 m data This exception is illustrated by constructing
the ratio
SF RUVuncorrected  SF R24m
SF RUVdust  corrected
where SF RUVuncorrected is the SFR from the rest frame 1500 A ux before
applying the extinction correction SF RUVdust  corrected is the SFR as de-
rived from the rest frame 1500 A ux after applying the extinction correction
estimated from the UV slope and SF R24m is the SFR as derived from the
SpitzerMIPS 24 m data ie from the rest-frame  8 m ux plus a model
SED eg Chary  Elbaz 2001 Thus this is meant to represent the ratio
of the un-extincted SFR plus the extincted SFR over the SFR corrected for
extinction Fig 1 shows this ratio as a function of redshift for the sample
galaxies
If both SFR estimates were unbiased one would expect the distribution of
this ratio to be like a Gaussian peaking at RSFR  1 and be symmetric the
result of random errors in either estimates Fig 1 shows that the distribution
does indeed peak at RSFR  1 but the distribution is skewed towards large
values of RSFR A Gaussian tting the RSFR  1 part of the distribution is
also shown in Fig 1 allowing to quantify in  25 of the total the fraction of
high RSFR galaxies in excess of the Gaussian distribution Thus Daddi et al
isolate a population Mid-IR Excess galaxies ie those for which the rest-frame
8 m ux overestimates the SFR or equivalently the dust 24 m emission is in
excess of what is expected from the extinction as estimated from the UV slope

3 Compton-Thick AGNs are Widespread at z  2
In principle the excess SFR estimated from the 24 m ux may signal some
inadequacy of the semi-empirical relation used to translate the rest frame  8 m
ux into a SFR Alternatively the Mid-IR excess may signal that dust is being
heated also by an energy source other than star formation ie nuclear activity
To explore this latter option Daddi et al 2007b have appealed to Chandra
X-ray data publicly available over the CDFSGOODS eld proceeding to stack
the X-ray images separately for the normal RSFR  3 and the Mid-IR excess
RSFR  3 galaxies not including those galaxies which are individually detected
in X-Rays The result is shown in Fig 2 Clearly in the stacked images the
normal galaxies are well detected in the soft band but just barely in the hard
band The Mid-IR excess galaxies instead show strong emission also in the
hard band which is indeed interpreted as evidence for them hosting an X-ray
emitting AGN From the t of their X-ray spactrum to those of model AGN
spectra with dierent column densities of absorming material one infers that
the AGN X-ray ux is heavily absorbed in the soft bands as illustrated in Fig
3 with log NH245 indicating that the majority of such AGNs are Compton-
thick The model X-ray spectra by Gilli Comastri  Hasinger 2007 used for
the t are shown in Fig 4 left panel
Thus Daddi et al
infer that at z  2 some 25 of KVega  22 galaxies
host a Compton-thick AGN and over  35 hosts an AGN when including
also those galaxies that are individually detected in X-rays about one half in
number compared to the Mid-IR excess galaxies to the same KVega  22 limit
Daddi et al 2007b Clearly nuclear activity was vastly more widespread at

4 The concomitant growth of the stellar mass and the BH mass
The 14  z  25 redshift range or the cosmic time from  25 to  45 Gyr
since the Big Bang marks the epoch of most intense star formation and nuclear
activity Hence it must be the epoch when co-evolution of galaxies and SMBHs
should be most prominent and as such most easily recognizable
This is quantitatively explored in Daddi et al 2007b First by estimating
the average SFR over the whole sample of K  22 galaxies at 14  z  25
for which one derives  SF R  70 Myr1 The SMBH mass-growth rate
can be estimated from the unabsorbed X-Ray luminosity and a canonical  01
eciency for the accreted mass-energy conversion Over the whole K  22
sample ie including all galaxies the average unobscured X-ray luminosity is
1011  1012L hence  MSMBHdt  0025  025 Myr1 and therefore
 dMSMBHdt 
 SF R 
 035  35  103
so tantalizingly bracketing the Magorrian ratio  103 Indeed are we see-
ing the Magorrian ratio being established in this sample of z  2
galaxies

5 AGN Feedback
A necessary condition for AGN feedback is having an AGN With 35 of all
K  22 galaxies hosting an AGN it looks that this condition is quite well satised
at z  2 Feedback arises because energy momentum is transfered from the
AGN to the ISM of the host galaxy heating it and eventually expelling it from
the galaxy This energy transfer may be mediated by relativistic jets or by
hard AGN radiation We dont know whether relativistic jets are buried inside
these galaxies but we have direct evidence from the X-rays that hard radiation
is certainly at work
In fact the second condition energy transfer from the
AGN to the ISM is also satised being Compton-thick a major fraction of the
X-ray luminosity of the AGNs in the Mid-IR excess galaxies is clearly dumped
to the ISM The unobscured hard X-Ray luminosity at  6 keV in the rest-
frame of these Compton-thick AGNs is typically  1043 ergs a power which is
being absorbeddeposited in the ISM Formally this power would be sucient
to eject all the gas from a galaxy in just a few million years However most
of the energy deposited in the ISM must be degraded locally perhaps even in
the immediate vicinity of the AGN Indeed the mere Mid-IR excess testies
that the hard X-ray photons Compton-heat electrons in the ISM which share
their energy with gas and dust and eventually dust radiates most of this energy
away in the Mid- and Far-IR From the point of view of feedback this is a pure
loss Nonetheless if even a relatively small fraction of the absorbed hard X-ray
luminosity say a few percent goes to increasingly Compton-heat the gas then
SF could be quickly switched o gas expelled from the galaxy and the galaxy
itself turned into an early-type passively evolving galaxy
These considerations prompt a second tantalizing question with these
Compton-thick AGNs are we seeing the AGN Feedback in action
6 Downsizing
Fig 4 right panel shows the fraction of Mid-IR excess galaxies those with
RSFR  3 as a function of their stellar mass This fraction increases with mass
reaching  50 at M  1011 M Thus Compton-thick AGN activity and the
likely feedback are even more widespread among the most massive star-forming
galaxies
It is therefore likely that AGN feedback will more promptly succed
in quenching star formation in the most massive galaxies whereas it may take
longer to activate a powerful Compton-thick AGN in progressively lower-mass
galaxies with star formation persisting in them for a longer time
It is now observationally well established that the most massive galaxies
are the rst to turn passive starting at z2 while less massive galaxies turn
passive at lower and lower redshifts the lower their mass eg Kodama et al
2004 Thomas et al 2005 Cimatti Daddi  Renzini 2006 a manifestation of
Galaxy Downsizing Thus we meet here the third tantalizing question promoted
by this analysis of z  2 galaxies Are we seeing Galaxy Downsizing in
progress
7 Conclusions
The systematic study of Daddi et al 2007ab of a complete sample of 14 
z  25 galaxies has revealed a widespread Compton-thick AGN activity among
these galaxies and has prompted three intriguing questions namely
 Are we seeing the Magorrian ratio being established in z  2 galaxies
 Among these galaxies are we seeing the AGN Feedback in action
 Are we seeing Galaxy Downsizing in prograss
We cannot yet give a secure positive answer to these questions as much remains
to be explored on the structure and internal workings of these galaxies However
with cosmic SFR and AGN activity both peaking at z  2 if not at this redshift
ie in the boom years whenwhere would we better witness galaxy-SMBH
co-evolution
