Passive spiral galaxies - unusual galaxies with spiral mor-
phologies but without any sign of on-going star formation -
have recently been shown to exist preferentially in cluster in-
falling regions This discovery directly connects passive spi-
ral galaxies to cluster galaxy evolution studies such as the
Butcher-Oemler effect or the morphology-density relation
Thus detailed study of passive spiral galaxies could poten-
tially yield new insight on the underlying physical mecha-
nisms governing cluster galaxy evolution
However in previous work passive spiral galaxies were
selected from low-resolution optical images with 15 arc-
sec seeing Passive spirals could therefore be mis-identied
as S0 galaxies or as dusty-starburst galaxies which are not
passive at all To address this issue we performed deep
high-resolution near-infrared imaging of 32 passive spiral
galaxies with UKIRT
We selected our target galaxies from 73 passive spiral
galaxies presented by Goto et al 2003 None of the 73
galaxies have any emission in OII or H 1 in equiva-
lent width though all have a disc-like morphology Of the
73 passive spiral galaxies the 32 targets accessible during
our run in September 2003 were observed in the K band us-
ing the UKIRT Fast Track Imager UFTI Data were taken
during periods of good atmospheric transparency and with
excellent seeing of  05 arcsec In Figure 1 we show K-
band images of 16 of
the 32 passive spiral galaxies
Although selected in poorer conditions the deep and high
resolution imaging capability of UKIRT clearly shows the
discs and spiral arm structures Thus passive spiral galax-
ies are not S0s but truly are spiral galaxies
We used the restframe optical-infrared r-K colour distri-
bution for the observed passive spiral galaxies to investigate
whether they are dusty starburst galaxies or truly passive
galaxies Since the K band is less affected by dust extinction
than the r band dusty starburst galaxies are known to have
redder colours in r-K by 1 mag Smail et al 1999 Fig-
ure 2 plots g-i colour against r-K colour Optical photometry
g r and i is from the SDSS The black circles are for pas-
sive spiral galaxies observed with UKIRT The red squares
are for early-type galaxies in the control sample For a ref-
erence we plot the distribution of all galaxies in the volume
limited sample with K magnitudes measured with the Two
Micron All Sky Survey 2MASS Jarrett et al 2000 as the
contour
Interestingly compared with all galaxies the contour
passive spiral galaxies circles are not redder in r-K colour
Indeed the r-K colours of the passive spiral galaxies are
indistinguishable from the early-type galaxies squares
These results support the truly passive nature of these
galaxies since dusty starburst galaxies should have r-K
colours redder by 1 magnitude than normal galaxies
Thus our results support the truly passive and spiral
nature of these galaxies
It is very likely that passive spi-
ral galaxies are indeed transition objects currently undergo-
ing cluster galaxy evolution Further studies of passive spi-
ral galaxies will reveal the physical mechanisms governing
cluster galaxy evolution
