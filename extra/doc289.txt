ABSTRACT
We investigate the redshift evolution of the molecular gas mass fraction fmol 
 where Mmol is molecular gas mass and M is stellar mass of galaxies in
MMmol
the redshift range of 0  z  2 as a function of the stellar mass by combining CO
literature data We observe a stellar-mass dependence of the fmol evolution where
massive galaxies have largely depleted their molecular gas at z  1 whereas the fmol
value of less massive galaxies drastically decreases from z  1 We compare the ob-
served M fmol relation with theoretical predictions from cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations and semi-analytical models for galaxy formation Although the theoreti-
cal studies approximately reproduce the observed mass dependence of fmol evolution
they tend to underestimate the fmol values particularly of less massive  1010 M
and massive galaxies  1011 M when compared with the observational values Our
result suggests the importance of the feedback models which suppress the star for-
mation while simultaneously preserving the molecular gas in order to reproduce the
observed M  fmol relation

INTRODUCTION
Current galaxy-formation models are constructed so as to
reproduce the observed stellar mass function SMF of
galaxies The statistical properties of the stellar compo-
nents of galaxies have been investigated by means of large
surveys in the optical and near-infrared wavelengths eg
Cole et al 2001 Kochanek et al 2001 It is known that
the galaxy formation models based on the canonical cold
dark matter hypothesis the so-called CDM hypothesis
overpredict the number densities of less massive and mas-
sive galaxies when compared with the observed SMFs of
galaxies eg Benson et al 2003 To resolve this discrep-
ancy several feedback processes have been proposed to blow-
out andor heat up the cold-gas component which is the
raw material for star formation eg Silk  Mamon 2012
Somerville  Dave 2014 For low-mass galaxies the feed-
back processes of the blowing-out of the cold gas by su-
pernovae SNe eg Larson 1974 Dekel  Silk 1986 pho-
toionisation by cosmic ultraviolet background radiation eg
Ikeuchi 1986 Efstathiou 1992 Navarro  Steinmetz 1997
 E-mailkanamatsuinaoacjp babajnelsijp
Gnedin 2000 Okamoto et al 2008 and preheating of the
intergalactic medium IGM by gravitational pancaking
eg Mo et al 2005 Lu et al 2015 have been considered
while for high-mass galaxies active galactic nucleus AGN
feedback eg Croton et al 2006 and gravitational heating
eg Rees  Ostriker 1977 Khochfar  Ostriker 2008 have
been considered
Galaxy formation is a complex process which involves
both stars and gas and therefore galaxy formation models
are required to reproduce the observed properties of not only
stellar but also the cold-gas components of galaxies The
observed mass-metallicity relation of galaxies implies that a
galaxy is not a closed-box system but evolves with the con-
tinual cycling of baryons between galaxies and the IGM eg
Tremonti et al 2004 Such a picture of galaxy evolution
is supported by recent cosmological hydrodynamic simula-
tions Dave et al 2011ab In such a galaxy-IGM ecosys-
tem context galaxies are described as a slowly evolving
system ie quasi-equilibrium model Bouche et al 2010
Dave et al 2012 where the galaxies acquire gas from cos-
mic large-scale lamentary structures eg Keres et al 2005
Dekel et al 2009 which activate star formation lose gas by
strong and ubiquitous outows which regulate star forma-

tion and again acquire the gas returned from the halo ie
wind recycling Oppenheimer et al 2010 Therefore inves-
tigations of the evolution of the gas component in galaxies
are essential to understand galaxy formation
Observations of cold-gas components in higher-redshift
galaxies are currently underway The cold-gas components
atomic hydrogen gas HI and molecular hydrogen gas
H2 are traced by the 21-cm hyperne structure line
and the 3-mm line from the carbon monoxide CO ro-
tational transition respectively Although most HI emis-
sion studies1 in high redshift have been limited to the
z  01  02 regime due to instrumental frequency coverage
and sensitivity Catinella et al 2008 Freudling et al 2011
Fernandez et al 2013 Rhee et al 2013 emissions from CO
have been detected farther out to z  6 these emissions
have been used to measure the H2 mass in the high-z uni-
verse Carilli  Walter 2013 and references therein Re-
cent CO surveys of both local and high-z galaxies have re-
vealed molecular gas fractions as a function of stellar mass
Saintonge et al 2011a Tacconi et al 2013 In addition to
these direct measurements of cold gas newer advances in
the observational studies of cold-gas components are also
expected from other indirect methods based on the star-
formation-ratemolecular-gas relation eg Popping et al
2012 dust continuum Magdis et al 2012a Santini et al
2014 Scoville et al 2014 2015 and the spectral features
in the optical band Morokuma-Matsui et al 2015 These
recent developments as well as observations made with
the newest generation of radio and sub-mm instruments
such as ALMA Atacama Large Millimetersubmillimeter

that direct comparison with observations is now pos-

have been studied with semi-analytical models SAMs
eg Kaumann et al 1999 Somerville  Primack 1999
Cole et al 2000 Nagashima et al 2005 recent large-scale

tion eg Schaye et al 2010 2015 Okamoto et al 2014
Thompson et al 2014 Vogelsberger et al 2014 In addi-
tion some of these theoretical studies have implemented
the equilibrium or non-equilibrium formation of H2 as
well as star formation from such H2 gas
in cosmologi-
cal simulations Gnedin et al 2009 Christensen et al 2012
Thompson et al 2014 Tomassetti et al 2015 and SAMs
Lagos et al 2011b Fu et al 2012 Popping et al 2014
Somerville et al 2015
However these theoretical models still require many
sub-grid parameters for star formation and feedback mod-
els due to limited spatialmass resolutions and a lack of the
full understanding of related physical processes for more
details see a recent review by Somerville  Dave 2014 As
described above there are fewer studies on the evolution
of the cold-gas component of galaxies than those on stel-
lar components Recent developments in both observational
and theoretical studies on the galactic cold-gas components
provide us a unique opportunity to compare theoretical and
observational results and to obtain the constraints for theo-
retical models
In this study we investigate as to whether the current
galaxy formation models reproduce the observed properties
of the cold-gas components of galaxies by comparing the ob-
served and theoretically predicted evolutions of the molecu-
lar gas mass fraction with respect to the total baryonic mass
as a function of stellar mass The outline of the paper is as
follows We rst investigate the redshift evolution inferred
from the observational data in section 2 In section 3 the
observed redshift evolution is compared with the model pre-
dictions Further we discuss feedback models implemented
in galaxy formation models in section 4 Finally we sum-
marise the study and comment on possible future prospects
in this direction in section 5
2 OBSERVED EVOLUTION OF MOLECULAR
GAS FRACTION
In this section we investigate the observed molecular gas
fraction as a function of stellar mass The molecular gas
mass fraction is dened as
Mmol  M
where M and Mmol denote the stellar mass and molecular
gas mass of a galaxy respectively We combine the literature
data of M and Mmol and calculate the molecular gas mass
fraction fmol of various galaxies The literature data of Mmol
include both direct and indirect estimations In the following
sections we rst describe the literature data used in our
study sections 21 and 22 and we subsequently investigate
the redshift evolution of fmol as a function of stellar mass

over 1071  10109 M and 07  41 M yr1 respectively
and they are the so-called main sequence of star-forming
galaxies3 Leroy et al derived stellar mass using Spitzers

ning a wide range in morphological type and luminosity
using the NRAO Kitt Peak 12-m telescope They combined
the literature data of CO and provided a CO catalogue of
225 out of the 322 galaxies of their complete sample with
stellar mass of 1085

of SFR with Meg Noeske et al 2007 The galaxies on this
sequence are called main sequence galaxies
nearby dwarf galaxies at 001  z  003 with the stellar
mass and SFR ranges of 1085
 1010 M and 01  40 M
yr1 respectively They limited to the samples with metal-
licity of 12log OH  85 for CO to be similar to or lower
than the Milky Way value They assumed a 12COJ  21
to 12COJ  1  0 intensity ratio of unity to estimate L
The stellar masses and SFRs of their sample galaxies were
provided by the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics-John
Hopkins University MPA-JHU group The stellar masses
of the galaxies were derived by tting the SDSS ugriz pho-
tometry to models spanning a wide range of star formation
histories
 Saintonge et al 2011a Saintonge et al conducted a
CO survey of local galaxies with stellar masses of 1  30 
1010 M and SFRs of 007  40 M yr1 with the 30-m
telescope at the IRAM facility CO Legacy Data base for
the GASS survey COLD GASS and their targets were se-
lected such that the resulting stellar mass distribution was
roughly at In their study the stellar mass and SFR of
galaxies were estimated by tting the GALEX NUV and
FUV and SDSS photometries with the Bruzual  Charlot
2003 population synthesis code Saintonge et al 2011b
Their sample consists of the star forming galaxies and pas-
sive galaxies
 Bauermeister et al 2013 Bauermeister et al targeted
31 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses in the range of
4  30  1010 M and SFRs in the range of 3  90 M yr1
at z  00505 and detected CO emissions from 24 galaxies
using the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave
Astronomy CARMA facility Evolution of molecular Gas
in Normal Galaxies EGNoG The sample galaxies in the
ranges of z  005  032 from which CO emission was de-
tected were drawn from SDSS DR7 Abazajian et al 2009
The stellar mass and SFR of their sample galaxies were pro-
vided by the MPA-JHU group This estimate was found to
be comparable with the one obtained from stellar absorp-
tion features Kaumann et al 2003 Further SFRs were
derived by tting the uxes of no less than ve emission lines
Brinchmann et al 2004 In this study we only use the data
of the normal star-forming galaxies of their sample
 Morokuma-Matsui et al 2015 Morokuma-Matsui et
al conducted CO observations of 12 galaxies with stellar
masses of 4  20  1011 M and SFRs of 85  48 M yr1
in the z  01  02 regime using the 45-m telescope at the
Nobeyama Radio Observatory and they detected CO emis-
sion from 8 galaxies Similar to the case of Bothwell et al
4 K Morokuma-Matsui and J Baba
2014 and Bauermeister et al 2013 the stellar masses
and SFRs of their samples were also obtained from the MPA-
JHU group and drawn from SDSS DR10 Ahn et al 2014
They showed that their samples correspond to star-forming
galaxies at the redshift
 Geach et al 2011 Geach et al observed seven galax-
ies selected based on the basis of the 24-m emission galaxies
with masses of 4  11  1011 M and SFRs of 28  62 M
yr1 at z  04 using the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interfer-
ometer PdBI and detected CO emission from ve galaxies
The stellar masses of their samples were estimated by tting
BV RIJK photometry Moran et al 2007 to model spec-
tral energy distributions SEDs using the KCORRECT soft-
ware package v42 Blanton  Roweis 2007 The SFRs of
their samples were derived from the far-infrared luminosity
Kennicutt 1998a estimated from the 77-m-line luminos-
ity Geach et al 2009
 Daddi et al 2010 Their sample galaxies comprised
the star-forming galaxies with a stellar mass range of 3 
11  1010 M and SFR range of 62  400 M yr1 in the
14  z  25 regime classied by using the BzK colour
criterion Daddi et al 2004 with Spitzer imaging detection

ies with IRAM PdBI and estimated L
CO by assuming a

Dannerbauer et al 2009 The stellar mass was estimated
via an empirical method with BzK photometry which was
calibrated with the mass estimates from multicolor pho-
tometry and SED tting Daddi et al 2004 The SFRs of
their samples were the averages of three SFRs estimated
from dust-corrected UV 24-m emission and 14-GHz ra-
dio uxes Daddi et al 2010
 Tacconi et al 2013 Tacconi et al conducted the
largest CO survey of z  1  2 galaxies with stellar mass of

the IRAM PdBI and detected CO emissions from 52 galax-
ies IRAM Plateau de Bure HIgh-z Blue Sequence Survey
PHIBSS The stellar mass was estimated from SED tting
The SFR estimate was based on the sum of the observed UV-
and IR-luminosities for the z  12 samples Wuyts et al
2011 and the extinction-corrected H luminosities for the
z  22 samples Kennicutt 1998a Forster Schreiber et al
2009 Mancini et al 2011 Wuyts et al 2011 Their sample
follows the main sequence of star-forming galaxies at the red-
shift They observed the luminosities of the 12COJ  3 2
lines of galaxies and converted these data sets into the
luminosity of 12COJ  1  0 lines using a 12COJ 
1  012COJ  3  2 ratio of 2
All the studies except for Leroy et al 2008 assumed the
Chabrier initial mass function IMF Chabrier 2003 for es-
timating the stellar mass and SFR of galaxies Leroy et al
2008 used Kroupa IMF Kroupa 2001 We did not cor-
rect for this IMF dierence since the dierence in the
stellar mass and SFR estimations based on Chabrier and
Kroupa IMFs is small compared to the other uncertain-

22 Estimation of molecular gas mass from SFR
We also use the molecular gas mass estimated indirectly
from optical studies since the CO measurement is limited
to galaxies with a relatively narrow range of stellar mass
 1010
 1011 M particularly at high redshift
Popping et al 2012 estimated the fmol values of the
COSMOS Cosmological Evolution Survey Scoville et al
2007 galaxies using the molecular gas mass values inferred
from the Kennicutt-Schmidt K-S law and the pressure-
based H2 formation model Blitz  Rosolowsky 2004 2006
They presented the tting formulae of the M  fmol rela-
tions for star-forming galaxies and all galaxies brighter than
IAB  24 mag For the star-forming galaxies the tting
formula is given by
exp log M  AB  1

and that for the whole galaxies brighter than 24 mag in IAB
exp log M  CD  1
fmolP12 
C  633cid161 
0016cid170115
 D  1711  z157
Here we mention that Popping et al 2012 showed
that their IAB  24 mag sample is complete 100  for the
range of 1092 M  M  10117 M at 05  z  075 with
respect to the SMF derived in the same eld Ilbert et al
2010 However it is almost evenly  50 for all stellar
mass ranges at z  125 In addition if we assume the t-
ting functions of Popping et al 2012 as accurate the fmol
values of galaxies with stellar masses  1011 M becomes
larger at lower redshifts but the statistics with regards to
higher-z massive galaxies in the tting is poor Thus it is
required to closely consider these observational limitations
when we compare observations with theoretical studies
23 Stellar-mass-dependent evolution of molecular
gas mass fraction of galaxies
In this section we investigate the stellar mass dependence of
fmol evolution using the observational data Figure 1 shows
the redshift evolution of the fraction fmol as a function of
stellar mass Although the stellar mass range of galaxies
with CO measurements is narrow at high redshift z  01
we can observe the stellar-mass dependence where the mas-
sive galaxies have smaller fmol values than their less mas-
sive counterparts at z  0  2 In all redshift ranges the
observed M  fmolCO relations are well reproduced by the
M fmolP12SF relations in which the molecular gas mass is
estimated from the indirect method Popping et al 2012
have already reported that the MfmolP12SF relation suc-
ceeds in reproducing the observed MfmolCO relations of
local galaxies Saintonge et al 2011a and z  1  2 sam-
ples Tacconi et al 2010 Here we found that their M
fmolP12SF relation also reproduces the observed MfmolCO
relations of galaxies at z  01  1

equations for fmolP12SF and fmolP12 are 0025 for a 03 for b 125 for c and 22 for d The relationship between the symbols
and references is summarised in Table 1 The stellar-mass-dependent fmol evolution where massive galaxies tend to reduce fmol in earlier
epochs compared to their less massive counterparts can be clearly observed see section 23 for more details
There is a clear stellar-mass dependence in the fmol evo-
lution of star-forming galaxies where less massive galaxies
tend to show a decrease in fmol over time as reported in
Popping et al 2012 2015 Here we remark that recent
dust-based studies have also suggested that the stellar-mass
dependence of the cold gas mass fraction fgas  Mgas
MgasM
where Mgas denotes the total cold gas mass including the
atomic and molecular gas shows a similar stellar-mass de-
pendent evolution Santini et al 2014 Therefore studies
based on two independent methods CO or dust both sug-
gest the stellar-mass dependent evolution of the cold gas
fraction of galaxies
We examine the stellar-mass dependent evolution of
fmol quantitatively We must consider the stellar mass
growth when discussing the fmol evolution If we adopt the
stellar mass growth of star-forming galaxies as reported in
Leitner 2012 the redshift evolution of the M fmolP12SF
relation suggests that galaxies with stellar masses of 1010
M 10105 M and 1011 M at z  0 exhibit decreases by
factors of 8 from 80  to 10  6 37  to 70  and 4
26  to 61  in their molecular gas mass fraction from
z  1 to z  0 respectively4 Similarly if we use the stellar
mass growth of galaxies based on the abundance matching
method ie not biased with respect to star-forming galax-
ies Conroy  Wechsler 2009 the M  fmolP12 evolution
suggests that the galaxies with stellar masses of 1010 10105
and 1011 M at z  0 exhibit molecular gas-fraction de-
creases by factors of 14 from 96  to 68  8 14  to
42  and 1 49  to 36  from z  1 to z  0 respec-
tively Therefore the fmol evolution of less massive galaxies
in the range of z  0 2 is more drastic than that of massive
galaxies and the massive galaxies appear to have depleted
4 Here we use the M  fmolP12SF relation because Leitner
2012 estimated the growth rate of stellar mass by assuming that
present-day star-forming galaxies were on the main sequence of
the star-forming galaxies
relatively large fractions of their molecular gas by z  15

3 COMPARISON WITH THEORETICAL
STUDIES
In this section we compare the observed M  fmol relation
with predictions of theoretical studies constructed to repro-
duce the observed SMF The theoretical studies we used in
this study are briey summarised in section 31 We demon-
strate a discrepancy in the M  fmol relation between the
observations and theoretical predictions in section 32
31 Galaxy formation models in the literatures
Recent galaxy formation models take into account star for-
mation from molecular gas as suggested by observations
eg Bigiel et al 2008 Leroy et al 2008 These theoretical
models need to consider both star formation and molecule
formation Since star formation is an unknown process and
the current cosmological numerical simulations of galaxy for-
mation cannot resolve the spatial scale of molecular clouds
the galaxy formation models treat star formation as a sub-
grid model see below
For H2 formation most hydrodynamic simulations and
SAMs adopt simplied methods such as pressure-based
and metallicity-based models although some cosmolog-
ical hydrodynamic simulations solve the non-equilibrium
chemical reactions of hydrogen Gnedin et al 2009 The
fmol evolution farther out to z  3 has been also investi-
gated Magdis et al 2012b Saintonge et al 2013 Magdis et al
2012b detected a COJ  3  2 emission from an infrared lu-
minous Lyman break galaxy at z  32 with a stellar mass of
2  1011M The estimated fmol is 36  suggesting that massive
galaxies have at evolution of fmol at least in 1  z  3

tion The simulations with the smallest box size were run
to z  2 and those with the larger box sizes were run to
z  0 Although Duy et al 2012 examined both cases of
with and without AGN feedback we adopted the former case
since Duy et al already reported that the latter results in
a large discrepancy between the simulation and observation

theoretical studies
Figure 2 compares the observed and predicted M  fH2
relations from theoretical studies Here we adopt fH2P12
black dot-dash lines in Fig 2 as an observational refer-
ence for comparison with theoretical studies since the the-
oretical studies are not limited to star-forming galaxies It
should be noted that the theoretical studies did not apply
any magnitude limits which were applied to the observa-
tions This uncertainty is discussed below The predicted

Lagos et al 2011ba Fu et al 2010 2012 Popping et al
2014 are overlaid on the observed relation shown in Fig
The theoretical studies qualitatively reproduce the
trends of the stellar-mass-dependent evolution of fH2 where
the less massive galaxies have higher fH2 values than their
massive counterparts however there is a non-negligible
gap between fH2 from observations and theoretical stud-
ies Popping et al 2015 The fH2 predictions from the the-
oretical studies appear to be consistent with the fH2P12
values in the stellar mass range of  1010
 1011 M in
Fig 2a which is consistent with the results of a recent
study Lagos et al 2015 However the predicted fH2 val-
ues by the SAMs of less massive  1010 M are under-
estimated with respect to the observed values except for
Obreschkow et al 2009 The discrepancy between the ob-
servations and theoretical predictions is still observed even
if we only consider nearby galaxies Figs 2a b in the stel-
lar mass range of 1092M  M  1011 M wherein the
observational completeness is 100  see section 22
Obreschkow et al 2009 predicted higher fH2 values
than the observation values for less massive galaxies even
though they used the same code L-GALAXIES as Fu et al
2012 However Obreschkow et al 2009 implemented H2
formation as a post-process whereas Fu et al 2012 calcu-
lated H2 formation in a self-consistent manner This dier-
ence may explain the discrepancy between the two mod-
els but Obreschkow et al 2009 claimed that their galax-
ies with a stellar mass of  4  109 M were typically
found in a halo with less than 100 particles whose merg-
ing history could be followed over only a few time steps
De Lucia  Blaizot 2007
There is a dierence in the mass dependence of fH2 
even though the SIMs and SAMs predict similar red-
shift evolution of the SMF of galaxies see Fig 4 of
Somerville  Dave 2014 At all the redshift ranges 0 
z  2 the SIMs predict more at M  fH2 relations
than those of the observations upper panels of Fig 2
whereas the SAMs predict kinks at the characteristic masses
of 1010  1011 M lower panels of Fig 2 The dierence in
the prescriptions of H2 formation is not likely the reason for
this dierence between the SAMs and SIMs since there is no
clear dierence among the SAMs depending on whether or
not H2 formation is implemented as a post-process lower
panels of Fig 2 or depending on the models pressure-
or metallicity-based Fu et al 2012 Thus the dierence in
modelling star formation and feedback may cause this dif-
ference We discuss this gap between the SIMs and SAMs in
section 42
In the following paragraphs we discuss possible causes
for the fH2 discrepancy between the observations and the-
oretical studies from an observational point of view The
observational studies essentially tend to be biased towards
bright objects such as gas-rich objects andor optically
bright objects if the targets are selected based on large opti-
cal surveys It has been claimed that the models reproduce
the observational results relatively well if they take into ac-
count the sample selection criteria and observational sensi-
tivities Kaumann et al 2012 Popping et al 2014 These
studies showed that the predicted fH2 value approaches the
observed value if these observational conditions are consid-
ered but there still seem to be discrepancies between obser-
vations and model predictions see Fig 11 in Popping et al
2014 In addition a gap between a semi-empirical model as
a proxy for observations and theoretical predictions was also
reported Popping et al 2015 This semi-empirical model
couples a halo abundance matching model with a pressure-
based H2 formation model and is not aected by the ob-
servational limitations However we must pay attention to
this observational limitation when comparing the observa-
tions and theoretical studies especially for the less massive
and higher-z galaxy samples which are expected to be more
biased to bright gas-rich objects compared to massive and
low-z galaxy samples
formulated CO as a function of
In addition to the observational bias the uncertainty
in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor CO also contributes
an additional error in the fH2 estimate Narayanan et al
2012b
the gas-
phase metallicity and luminosity-weighted CO intensity
Narayanan et al 2012a showed that the observed fmol
value with Narayanans CO exhibits better agreement with
the predicted values obtained with cosmological simulations
Even though the dispersion is reduced certain systematic
stellar-mass-dependent residuals still remain see Fig 3 in
Narayanan et al 2012a Therefore the observational causes
alone may not be able to explain the discrepancy

IMPLICATIONS FOR FEEDBACK MODELS
As described in section 32 there is a gap between the ob-
served M  fH2 relations and theoretically predicted rela-
tions Although some fraction of this gap can be attributed
to observational uncertainties such as the selection bias and
variable CO the gap still remains This suggests that the
gap might originate in the uncertainties of the theoretical
models In this section we focus on the uncertainties of the
feedback processes in the theoretical models6 The free pa-
rameters for the feedback processes are xed to reproduce
the observed SMF even though the SMF is not a direct out-
come of the feedbacks alone but a consequence of the sev-
eral processes involved in galaxy evolution This is because
there is no denitive observational constraint for each feed-
back process There might also be room for improvement in
the H2 and star formation models in terms of the molecule
fraction and the K-S law but they are set to meet the direct
observational constraints for these processes
To investigate the stellar mass and redshift dependence
of each feedback process considered in theoretical studies we
construct an equilibrium model EM based on the study by
Dave et al 2012 In the following subsections we briey
describe the EM section 41 and subsequently we examine
the implications of the feedback processes through compar-
isons between the EMs and observations section 42

The EM model is based on the idea that the simulated galax-
ies evolve in a quasi-equilibrium state Bouche et al 2010

Min  M  Mout
where Min
Mout and M denote the mass inow rate mass
outow rate and SFR respectively This model assumes
that the stochastic variations in Min arising due to factors
such as mergers are prone to return galaxies to equilibrium

411 Stellar mass and gas fraction
In this section we briey introduce the formulation of stel-
lar mass and gas fraction in the EM according to Dave et al
2012 Integrating the equation M  Min  Mout we ob-
tain the stellar mass MMh z as a function of the redshift
z and halo mass Mh The outow rate is given as
Mout   M
where the mass loading factor  is described as  
Mh1012 M13 Dave et al 2011ab The inow rate
into a galaxy Min is expressed as
Min  Mgrav  Mprev  Mrecyc
where Mgrav
Mprev and Mrecyc denote the baryonic inow
rate into a galaxys halo rate at which material ends up
in the gaseous halo of the galaxy and return infall rate
respectively These are expressed as

412 Preventive feedback parameters
Each preventive feedback parameter8  depends on the halo
mass Mh and redshift z The EM considers four feedback
processes as follows
 PHOTO photoionising heating hereafter PHOTO An
ultraviolet background radiation heats the halo gas of galax-
ies It eectively works in less massive systems since less
6 Recent studies on galaxy formation based on the semi-analytic
approach have suggested that the fH2 gap between the observa-
tions and theoretical predictions decreases if the timescales for
re-accretion of the ejected gas have a mass- and time-dependence
Henriques et al 2013 2015 Mitchell et al 2014 White et al
2015 Even though the physical origin for this treatment is not
clear some feedback processes may be attributed to changing the
re-accretion timescale
7 Dave et al 2012 used Z  05  01zM1010 M025
but we use Z  03  01zM1010 M025 to prevent the
results from being diverged This dierence is because some of
the equations which are not fully based on physics or ab initio
simulations were not presented in Dave et al 2012 such as
Mqz for equation 19 and Mwindz for equation 20 hence
we must formulate them by ourselves
8 In Daves model all feedbacks are modeled in preventive man-
ner but some are represented as ejective feedback

We use the M  fgas relation because Daves EMs do not
consider H2 formation To clarify the contribution from each
feedback process ve conditions are considered 1 all feed-
back processes are considered 2 PHOTO is not considered
3 GRAV is not considered 4 QUENCH is not considered
and 5 WIND is not considered
From Fig 4 we can conrm the stellar-mass depen-
dence and observe the degree of inuence of each feedback
process as expected from Fig 3 For less massive galax-
ies but  1092 M according to observational complete-
ness the theoretically predicted fgas value approaches the
observation value at z  0 Fig 4a but it is consider-
ably lower than the observation value even if we exclude the
PHOTO and WIND feedback processes On the other hand
the QUENCH and GRAV feedback processes work well for
massive galaxies The stellar-mass dependence of fgas in the
high-mass range but  1011 M according to observational
completeness appears to be dierent in that there is a knee
around M  10105 M in the EM as opposed to a mono-
tonic decrease in observations however it is not conclusive
because these are consistent within the typical dispersion of
the observed relation
From Fig 2 we observe that theoretical studies tend to
predict lower gas fractions than observations particularly in
less massive and massive galaxies Our result suggests that
Redshift evolution of M  fmol relation in 0  z  2
the feedback models implemented in the theoretical stud-
ies are clearly required However the physical ingredients
in these models are still insucient to correctly reproduce
the available observations One requirement is to consider
a feedback model that quenches star formation but retains
the cold-gas component in galaxies
The EM predicts a stellar-mass dependence of fgas sim-
ilar to that of fH2 predicted by the SAMs rather than the
SIMs there is a kink at the characteristic stellar mass The
M  fgas relations predicted by the EMs without GRAV or
QHENCH become at similar to the predictions of the SIMs
The observations indicate that the M fgas or M fH2 re-
lations are similar to the predictions of the EM and SAMs at
higher redshifts while these relations are similar to the SIMs
at lower redshifts The virial shock heating is expected to be
included in the SIMs naturally but AGN feedback is imple-
mented as an ad-hoc model If the observed fgas evolution
in the high-mass range of Popping et al 2012 is correct
our comparison suggests a more drastic redshift evolution of
AGN feedback than the SIMs ie a stronger AGN feedback
for a high redshift and a weaker one for a low redshift How-
ever the details regarding the modelling of AGN feedback
are beyond the scope of this paper
Some recent studies have emphasised the relevance of
the feedback processes which suppress star formation while
simultaneously preserving the cold gas Makiya et al 2014
Morokuma-Matsui et al 2015 Our results showed that the
EMs and the SAMs tend to underestimate fgas or fH2 in less
massive and massive galaxies There is a larger gap between
the observations and theoretical predictions for less mas-
sive galaxies in Fig 4a M  fgas relation than in Fig 2a
M  fH2 relation This larger gap in fgas in less massive
galaxies suggests a lot of ejection of cold gas by SN feedback
modeled in the theoretical studies The gap may be reduced
if we consider the suppression of H2 formation instead of the
ejection of total cold gas
Makiya et al 2014 implemented a star formation law
with a feedback depending on galaxy-scale mean dust opac-
ity and metallicity in SAM and succeeded in reproducing the
faint-end slopes of galaxy luminosity functions at z  0 with
a reasonable strength of the SN feedback In their model star
formation in less massive galaxies is suppressed because such
galaxies tend to have lower metallicity lower surface density
and thus lower H2 fraction For massive galaxies morpho-
logical quenching is one of the important processes which
can quench star formation even in the presence of a gas com-
ponent Martig et al 2009 showed that star formation is
suppressed once the central spheroidal component becomes
suciently massive to stabilise the galactic disc against lo-
cal gravitational instability Some observational studies sug-
gested that morphological quenching is in action in the early-
type galaxies Martig et al 2013 Morokuma-Matsui et al
els also reproduce the observed properties of the cold-gas
component of galaxies we compare the observed and the-
oretically predicted evolution of the molecular gas fraction
with respect to the total baryonic mass as a function of stel-
lar mass ie the M fmol or M fH2 relations Our main
ndings are as follows
i The evolution of the observed M fmol relation shows
a stellar-mass dependent evolution massive galaxies have
largely depleted their molecular gas at z  1 whereas less
massive galaxies tend to convert molecular gas into stars in
the regime of 0  z  1
ii The current cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
and semi-analytical models for galaxy formation succeed in
qualitatively reproducing the M  fH2 relation evolution
in the regime of 0  z  2 where less massive galaxies are
always more gas-rich than massive galaxies
iii There is a non-negligible gap between the observed
and theoretically predicted M  fH2 relations The pre-
dicted fmol value is more than two times smaller than the
observed value at most particularly in less massive  1010
M and massive galaxies  1011 M Accordingly for
this gap the use of feedback models could be required which
quench star formation but retain the cold-gas component
iv The observed redshift evolution of the cold gas mass
fraction in massive galaxies suggests a more drastic evolution
of AGN feedback than the one implemented in the hydrody-
namic simulations ie a stronger AGN feedback in higher
redshift z  1 and a weaker one in lower redshift z  1
v The SMF of galaxies alone is not sucient for con-
straining the galaxy formation models and the M  fmol
relation forms one of the important observational constraints
on feedback processes implemented in galaxy-formation
models
It is to be noted that we adopted the indirect estimates of
fmol using the optical survey data Popping et al 2012 for
comparison with the galaxy formation models in this study
To form a denitive conclusion regarding the fmol evolution
of galaxies particularly less massive and massive galaxies
it is necessary to directly measure the cold gas mass of galax-
ies over wide ranges of stellar mass and redshift The mass
function of the stellar component is of course a basic ob-
served constraint which must be satised for the models
The cold-gas component is also an important component in
the baryonic cycle of galaxies A combination of the obser-
vational constraints on stellar and cold gas components will
aid in sketching a complete scenario of galaxy formation and
evolution Observations with forthcoming facilities such as
the ALMA the NOEMA and the SKA will allow us to
explore the statistical properties and evolution of cold-gas
components in galaxies such as HI and H2 mass functions
as well as the M  fmol relation

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Galaxy formation models are constructed so as to repro-
duce the observed SMF of galaxies by blowing out andor
heating up the cold-gas component to quench further star
formation particularly in less massive and massive systems
