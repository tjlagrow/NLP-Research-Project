The SKA will be a unique instrument with which to study the evolution of the gas content of
galaxies A proposed deep  8 Msec pencil-beam survey is simulated using recently updated
specications for SKA sensitivity and survey speed Almost 107 galaxies could be detected in the
redshifted 21cm line most at redshifts in excess of two This will enable condent statements
to be made about the evolution of the cosmic HI density and the HI mass function to z  3
corresponding to a lookback time of 11 Gyr However galaxies or groups of galaxies with masses
the same as the most HI-massive galaxies at z  0 will be detectable at redshifts of 6 if they exist
The ideal instrument for studying HI evolution would have an instantaneous sensitivity at least a
factor of two higher than current specications in the critical frequency range 200-500 MHz or
AT  2  104 m2 K1 The capabilities of the SKA will be highly complementary to ALMA
which will be able to study the evolution of the molecular gas component over the same redshift

Gas Evolution
1 Introduction
Lister Staveley-Smith
Understanding the evolution of galaxies is one of the goals of modern cosmology and one
of the ve key science goals of the SKA 1 A key ingredient in galaxy evolution is the gas
supplied through various accretion merger and feedback processes that occur during the assembly
of galaxies This gas which is mainly hydrogen passes through a neutral atomic phase and later
condenses into massive molecular clouds and stars During the atomic phase it can readily be
traced with the 21cm hyperne spin-ip transition and the Gunn-Peterson effect
At high redshifts z  16 neutral hydrogen is currently traced by ground-based observations
of Gunn-Peterson absorption lines against bright background QSOs Such observations demon-
strate that the bulk of the neutral hydrogen is in the Damped Ly-a systems with column densities
exceeding 2  1020 cm2 However interpretation of these observations tends hampered by insuf-
cient lines of sight and serious uncertainties associated with dust obscuration gravitational lensing
and intrinsic source size These uncertainties lead to contradictory results from measurements asso-
ciated with bright QSOs faint QSOs and Gamma Ray Bursts 2 3 4 However with the SKA
galaxies will be detected at similar redshifts in 21cm line emission which will lead to a clearer
understanding of the distribution of gas in the Universe and the manner in which the gas content
of galaxies evolves with time
In order to measure the gas content of galaxies at the highest redshift a deep pencil beam
survey with the SKA is proposed Currently proposed SKA specications 5 are adopted and
used to generate articial galaxy catalogues which are used to simulate the accuracy with which
one simple parameter can be recovered namely the cosmic HI density  the comoving volume
density of neutral hydrogen
2 An SKA Deep Field
An early goal in the design and development of the SKA has been the requirement to detect and
image galaxies beyond a redshift of unity in the redshifted 21cm line of neutral hydrogen and in the
radio continuum 6 However the astronomy community has since developed an impressive list of
complementary science goals for the SKA including the study of the early intergalactic medium
dark energy and cosmology pulsars and tests of gravitational theory planet formation and cosmic
magnetism 1 The resultant range of requirements eg frequencies baselines eld-of-view
has inevitably added to the cost of the SKA and created complexities in developing a design A
recent SKA project study 5 has recommended the adoption of a preliminary set of specications
for the SKA and its various phases For the purpose of the discussion of a putative SKA deep
eld these specications are adopted in this paper Where multiple specications exist due to
technology uncertainty the specications relating to the simplest technology has been chosen The
SKA specications although realistic are nevertheless still indicative and are likely to change as
the SKA design evolves For reference a summary of the adopted values in the frequency range
of interest is listed in Table 1
A critical requirement for the study of galaxy evolution is the ability to detect galaxies at the
highest redshift Since the bandwidth is dened by the Doppler width of the galaxies this ability is
only dependent on the instantaneous sensitivity AT  and the integration time t  Unlike for many

1Assumes that 75 of the SKA aperture will reside on baseline lengths short enough not to signicantly resolve distant galaxies
2Assumes wideband feed technology which gives a slightly better sensitivity AT  but a dramatically worse eld of view
Table 1 The adopted set of SKA specications used in the simulations and the number of galaxies de-
tectable in the simulations in a deep-eld HI survey z is the redshift range AT is the telescope gain W
the eld of view t is the integration time N is the number of galaxy detections expected The specications
follow the current SKA project ofce recommendations 5 but are subject to modication There are a
number of other assumptions made in simulating the numbers of galaxies detected in this survey the most
important ones being that the comoving HI mass function and velocity function is described by HIPASS 7
that the galaxy detection threshold is 5-s  and that the minimum resolution used for the detection algorithm
is 01 MHz
other science goals survey or mapping speed is much less important as long as the eld-of-view
is able to deliver suitably large statistical samples High mapping speed on its own is insufcient
to ensure that the highest redshift galaxies can be detected
For this paper the sole question of the evolution of the cosmic HI density is addressed This
only requires the detection not imaging of galaxies Therefore somewhere between 50 base-
lines less than 5 km and 75 baselines less than 180 km of the full SKA collecting area is
available before galaxies become resolved and more difcult to detect Here it is assumed that
75 is available corresponding to a sensitivity of AT  7500 m2 K1 in the critical redshift range
18  61 Values for other frequencies are listed in Table 1 Low redshift galaxies remain heavily
resolved Nevertheless at the higher redshifts of interest in this paper where the great majority
of the galaxies will be detected the assumption remains reasonable Available integration time is
more difcult to judge but given the wide range of science possibilities opened up with a deep eld
observation it seems likely that a substantial integration time may be feasible It is assumed that 8
Msec which corresponds to 180  12 hrs will be available over the rst few years of operation of
the SKA
3 Results
A simulated catalogue was created using the above telescope specications and a non-evolving
HIPASS HI mass function 7 The redshift distribution is shown in Figure 1 The small eld-of-
view at frequencies from 500 to 1420 MHz results in a relatively small number of objects detected
at low redshifts For example only 21000 galaxies are detected at redshifts beneath 042 which is
a factor of 10 less than expected from the proposed ASKAP deep survey 8 and Figure 1 despite
the latter being conducted with a telescope of less than 1 of the SKA collecting area However
a shallow SKA survey over a large area of sky is a better way of detecting larger numbers of low-
redshift galaxies At higher redshifts much larger numbers of galaxies are detected mainly due to

bins from 0 to 7 in a deep SKA pencil beam survey of integration time 8 Msec open green histogram

Each redshift bin is of width D z  008 and the total numbers of galaxies in different redshift intervals is
listed in the previous table The histogram is truncated due to the large numbers of galaxies near z  2
the much larger cosmic volume surveyed M  galaxies are seen to redshifts of about 34 beyond
which the number of detected galaxies drops off dramatically
For each redshift interval the HI density integral R MHf MHdMH is calculated for the de-
tected galaxies and shown in Figure 2 The detected density remains within a factor of a few of
the input density at redshift up to  2 but drops to 10 at a redshift of  35 as the bulk of the
mass-bearing galaxies are too faint to detect Nevertheless using an assumption that the shape of
the mass function is constant it is possible to recover the input mass density even at redshift 5
Figure 2 before shot noise errors become large In practice the shape of the mass function will
change with redshift in an unknown manner so it will be hard to reliably recover the cosmic HI
mass density much beyond a redshift of 3 from emission measurements alone
4 Discussion
This simulation has demonstrated the large numbers of high-redshift galaxies that can be de-
tected by the SKA in a signicant but feasible HI survey of galaxies and has demonstrated the
high accuracy with which the cosmic HI density can be measured Whilst galaxy numbers are
low at redshifts below 18 this is largely due to the small eld of view available to single pixel
technology Adoption of wideeld detection technology has the potential to greatly increase num-

using the simulated galaxy catalogue of the previous gure The upper black points show the recovered
density after correction for galaxies below the detection threshold the lower red points show the measured
density of directly detected galaxies only
bers Although the subsequent reduction of errors associated with shot noise and cosmic variance
is important for many science goals greater gains in the eld of galaxy evolution study are likely
to be made with better instantaneous sensitivity at lower frequencies This will increase the ability
to detect changes in the HI mass function and reduce the density extrapolation required to account
for low-mass galaxies at redshifts approaching 3 An appropriate goal of AT  2  104 m2 K1 is
therefore suggested for frequencies below 500 MHz
