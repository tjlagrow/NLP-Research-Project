Abstract We live in a universe lled with galaxies with an amazing variety of sizes and shapes
One of the biggest challenges for astronomers working in this eld is to understand how all these
types relate to each other in the background of an expanding universe Modern astronomical
surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have revolutionised this eld of astronomy by pro-
viding vast numbers of galaxies to study The sheer size of the these databases made traditional
visual classication of the types galaxies impossible and in 2007 inspired the Galaxy Zoo project
wwwgalaxyzooorg starting the largest ever scientic collaboration by asking members of the
public to help classify galaxies by type and shape Galaxy Zoo has since shown itself in a series of
now more than 30 scientic papers to be a fantastic database for the study of galaxy evolution
In this Invited Discourse I spoke a little about the historical background of our understanding
of what galaxies are of galaxy classication about our modern view of galaxies in the era of
large surveys I nish with showcasing some of the contributions galaxy classications from the
Galaxy Zoo project are making to our understanding of galaxy evolution
1 What are Galaxies
To say our understanding of the zoo of galaxies that are found in our Universe has
changed a lot over the last century or two is a bit of an understatement In 1845 the
state of the art picture of an external galaxy was an image of M51 or the Whirlpool
galaxy drawn by William Parsons Third Earl of Rosse 1800-1867 looking through
what at the time was the largest telescope in the world - the Leviathon of Parsontown
at his castle in Ireland Left panel Figure 1 for a discussion of the history of picture see
Steinicke 2012 At the time no-one fully understood that this was an external galaxy
made of billions of stars Although one of the motivations Parson is said to have had
to build the telescope was to resolve structure in distant nebula to see if they could be
island universe rather similar in structure to our own galactic home Today we have
images of millions of galaxies from large surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey eg
the last imaging release in Data Release Eight Aihara et al 2011 and extraordinarily
high resolution images of hundreds of galaxies including the Whirlpool from the Hubble
Space Telescope Fig 1 right as well as information on galaxies extending back more
than half of the age of our Universe
It took a long time for astronomers to understand that stars in the universe are orga-
nized in collections we now call galaxies I cant help thinking that it was a major leap in
understanding for astronomers to connect the uneven distribution of stars in the night
sky with the three-dimensional structure of the galaxy that we live in The rst published
example of this idea is the map shown in Figure 2 published by William Herschel in 1785
Herschel 1785 and based on star counts made by himself and his sister Caroline This
diagram demonstrates an understanding of the Galaxy as a collection of stars and while
there is a a lot wrong with it for example the Sun is at the centre and the whole thing

was much too small at  7000 light years across its an extraordinary piece of work as
the rst example of such a map based on actual astronomical data
By 1900 astronomers understood quite a lot more about the basic structure of our
galaxy The map made by Cornelius Easton in 1900 Fig 3 was the rst to show our
galaxy as having spiral structures Trimble 1995 Easton used pictures of other spiral
galaxies he saw in the sky to suggest the Milky Way might have this structure although
he still incorrectly placed the Sun in the centre of the Galaxy and its still too small

The variety of dierent galaxies observed in the sky naturally caused people to wonder
what they were The scientic arguments surrounding this question at the start of the
20th century are best represented perhaps by the public debate held in 1920 between
Heber Curtis and Harlow Shapley Many other authors have described this debate in
much more detail that I intend to for example Trimble 1995 and as is well known
both astronomers had it partly right While Curtis held the opinion that the spiral
nebula represented external galaxies his measure of the size of our Milky Way was much
too small only 10 kpc across and he still placed the Sun at its centre Shapley believed
the Milky Way was much larger and the Sun oset and in this was right but because
of the vast size of our Galaxy seemed unable to conceive that the Universe could be large
enough to contain millions of other similar galaxies
The modern view of the structure of our Galaxy is presented in Figure 4 as an artists
impression based on counting stars in data from the Spitzer Space Telescope observations
Benjamin 2008 Our Galaxy is a classic example of what we call a spiral galaxy with
most of its stars in a large at and very thin disc like structure which shows spiral arms
and a rounder region in the centre we call the bulge Our Galaxy also shows evidence
for an elongated bar of stars across its central parts a structure which is seen in many
but not all spiral galaxies The Milky Way demonstrates just one of the two main kinds
of big galaxies that are found in our Universe Particularly in high density regions of the
Universe for example in the core of the nearby Virgo cluster of galaxies many galaxies
are large smooth and spheroidal or elliptical on the sky in shape and we call these
types elliptical galaxies
2 Classication of Galaxies
A common scientic approach to understanding a large collection of objects better is
to classify it then make categories Much of the early eort in the eld of extragalactic
astronomy went into classifying the types of galaxies seen in the sky
Probably the most famous of the early galaxy classiers was Edwin Hubble 1889-
1953 He was not the only person at the time to develop a classication scheme but
his scheme has been the most long lasting It has been suggested that this was because
he made such broad categories that most galaxies can t into one of them Buta 2011
In a defence of the scheme against criticisms made by J H Reynolds Reynolds 1927
Hubble claimed to have looked at more than a thousand images of galaxies with only a
small fraction not tting the scheme and uncertainty in placement in less than ten per
cent Hubble 1927
In this same paper Hubble described the scheme which he rst published in diagram
Karen L Masters
Figure 5 Hubbles original tuning fork as he presented in in Hubble 1936 with gri images
of galaxies from the SDSS similar to those used in the Galaxy Zoo project added to further
illustrate each galaxy type
form in The Realm of the Nebula in 1936 as shown in the centre of Figure 5 Hub-
ble writes The classication under discussion arranges the extra-galactic nebulae in a
sequence of expanding forms There are two sections in the sequence comprising the
elliptical nebulae and the spirals respectively which merge into one another Ellipticals
were ordered in how elliptical they appeared from E0 being roundest to E7 most el-
liptical and spirals were ordered with reference to conspicuous structural features
notably 1 the size of the central bulge 2 the extent to which the arms wound and 3
how distinct the spiral arms were Hubble additionally notes that the barred spirals
made up a distinct type of spiral ordered in the same fashion but comprising a small
fraction of the numbers of normal spirals at least in the photographic plates he used
In between the spirals and ellipticals was the then hypothetical S0 or lenticular type
which shows a disc but no spiral arms The small number of galaxies Hubble found not
tting this scheme were called irregular
With only minor modications and extensions see eg Buta 2011 for an extensive
discussion the Hubble classication scheme as presented is still widely used in modern
extragalactic astronomy We dont just keep using it because its simple and it works well
but also because we have discovered that the actual physical properties of galaxies tend to
vary in predictable ways along the sequence eg as shown in Roberts  Haynes 1994
Its a common misconception that Hubble labelled galaxies at the left of the diagram
early and those on the right late in an attempt to imply an evolutionary sequence
In fact Hubble himself writes that no such conclusion should be drawn saying that
A Zoo of Galaxies
temporal connotations are made at ones peril and that he set up the classication
without prejudice to theories of galaxy evolution Hubble 1927 but rather he used
the labels by analogy to what was then a commonly used classication scheme for stars
These terminology are still commonly used by astronomers today to discuss relative
positions of galaxies on the diagram with early-type galaxies used to mean elliptical
and lenticular types and late-types for spiral galaxies Even among spirals early and
late will be used interchangeably with the Sa Sb Sc notation to describe relative location
along the spiral sequence
3 Physical Properties of Galaxies
A galaxy is a massive collection of stars gas and interstellar dust To rst order the
optical colour of a galaxy tells about the types of stars which live in the galaxy ignoring
the complications of dust which can redden some types of galaxies quite signicantly eg
Masters et al 2003 2010aWhen stars form they form in a variety of masses The most
massive stars are extremely bright and hot and so they look bluewhite in the same way
very hot metal glows bluewhite They also live for very short times astronomically
by which we mean just a few 100 million years and when they are visible in a galaxy
the galaxy will look blue because they totally outshine everything else
If star formation ceases after a short time time all the massive hot blue stars will die
and all that is left in the galaxy will be the less massive cooler red stars which can have
lifetimes of tens of billions of years So a galaxy which hasnt made new stars for while
more than a few 100 million years will look red as only red stars still shine in that
galaxy
Back to the Hubble diagram  the ellipticals on average are more massive ie have
more stars redder and tend to be found in clusters while the spirals tend to be less
massive bluer and not in clusters and increasingly so as you move along the Hubble
Sequence away from the ellipticals This tells us that the spiral galaxies are still forming
stars while the ellipticals have stopped and more generally the Hubble sequence reveals
a sequence of increasing star formation and potential for future star formation from
left to right Roberts  Haynes 1994 as well as decreasing average total galaxy stellar
Hubble claimed almost all galaxies he looked at tted his sequence however we have
observations of a lot more galaxies now Thanks to improvements in detector technology
and computers able to automatically process the data very large surveys of the sky
revealing millions of galaxies have become possible including many much fainter than
those available to Hubble and revealing extra categories of dwarf irregular ad low surface
brightness galaxies
4 How Many Galaxies are There
In his 1927 defence of the classication scheme Hubble claimed to have examined up-
ward of a thousand galaxies in its construction However for true physical understanding
of a galaxy more than just an image is required  we also need an estimate of its distance
in order to reveal its size and mass Hubble is most famous for a discovery which revolu-
tionised extragalactic astronomy in its ability to provide a relatively quick and easy way
to make these distance estimates In 1929 Edwin Hubble used a sample of just 24 nearby
galaxies to make this discovery He used the Doppler shift of spectral lines to measure
recessional velocities and used distances to these galaxies estimated based on the bright-
ness of certain types of stars in them By plotting these results against each other he
Karen L Masters
demonstrated that the further away a galaxy is the faster it appears to be moving away
from us a nding now called Hubbles Law Hubble 1929 He got the proportionality
constant drastically wrong nding what we now call Hubbles constant to be 46550
kmsMpc while around 70 kmsMpc is the current accepted value eg as we mea-
sured in Masters et al 2006 but the main nding persisted and in proceeding decades
has generated an industry of using recessional velocities of galaxies or redshifts since
they are revealed by a reddening of known spectral lines via the Doppler shift to map
the universe Even to this day it remains challenging to estimate redshift independent
distances to galaxies but the spectral measurements to indicate redshifts have become
relatively routine In the rst 57 years after Hubbles original ndings the number of
galaxies mapped had increased by a factor of 50 In 1986 the state of the art in this eld
was the rst slice of the CfA Redshift survey de Lapparent Geller  Huchra 1986
Using a sample of 1100 galaxies with redshifts this survey demonstrated that galaxies in
our universe are not uniformly distributed but rather clump in large scale structure
Only 22 years after this survey the state-of-the art was a sample 1000 times larger than
this  the nal release of the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample Strauss et al 2002 Abazajian
et al 2009 consisting of almost 1 million galaxy redshifts Ongoing surveys eg the
Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of SDSS-III Dawson et al 2012 are working
on increasing this even more
5 The Zoo of Galaxies in the Era of Large Surveys
Modern large surveys of hundreds of thousands of galaxies with detailed images and
spectra like the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample have inspired a new eld in extragalactic
astronomy  the use of statistical analyses to reveal demographics of the population of
galaxies Perhaps the most famous example of this in the eld of extragalactic astron-
omy is the use of the colour-magnitude diagram as a basic observation of galaxies eg
Strateva et al 2001 Bell et al 2003 Kaumann et al 2003 Baldry et al 2004 Balogh
et al 2004 The galaxy population show a striking bimodality in this diagram with
galaxies mostly found in two regions which have become known as the red sequence
and the blue cloud with a sparsely populated green valley in between eg a fraction
of the galaxies of the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample are shown on this diagram in Fig 6
This diagram demonstrates a general trend among galaxies that bigger or intrinsically
brighter galaxies tend to be optically redder ie having an older stellar population
This trend is most striking in the red sequence but also apparent in the blue cloud
Hubble Space Telescope surveys have demonstrated that this colour magnitude diagram
is in place since at least z  1 Bell et al 2004 They also show that at earlier times
in Universe more galaxies were found in the blue cloud  demonstrating that on average
galaxies move from blue to red as cosmic time progresses Much of extragalactic astron-
omy in recent decades has focused on developing an understanding of the mechanisms
which shape the locations galaxies are found in diagram and the physical processes which
move them around on it
The bimodality in colour mirrors the two galaxy types discussed above with the blue
cloud hosting mostly spiral galaxies and the red sequence mostly elliptical and lenticular
galaxies What had been missing in making this statement though was morphology or
type for more than a few thousand objects eg Fukugita et al 2007 classied 2000 of
the SDSS galaxies It seemed impossible to do that for the sample sizes being generated
by astronomers in the early part of the 21st century although the MOSES project tried
 visually inspecting 50000 galaxies to search for blue ellipticals Schawinski et al 2007
Without reliable information on galaxy morphology however its not possible to have

Strauss et al 2002 This plots the g  r colour versus the r-band absolute magnitude of
almost 300000 randomly selected galaxies in the Data Release 6 version Adelman-McCarthy
et al 2008
the full picture of galaxy evolution The colour of a galaxy is driven by the stellar and
gas and dust content of the galaxy while the shape or morphology of a galaxy reects
its dynamical history which could be very dierent and have a dierent timescale
Therefore one of the central motivations for the original Galaxy Zoo project was to
construct a large sample of early and late type galaxy classications from SDSS that
were independent of colour
6 Galaxy Zoo
Galaxy Zoo in its original form was launched on July 11 2007 and introduced in a
BBC online article that same day The original site simply asked volunteers to classify
galaxies as either spiral or elliptical  the most basic morphological split among galaxies
Something in Galaxy Zoo resonated extraordinarily with the general public The original
projection estimated that if a few thousand members of the public got involved the 1
million galaxies might be classied in a couple of years However within twelve hours of
the launch the Galaxy Zoo site was receiving 20000 classication per hour After forty
hours the classication rate had increased to 60000 per hour After ten days the public
had submitted  8 million classications By April 2008 when the Galaxy Zoo team
submitted their rst paper Lintott et al 2008 over 100000 volunteers had classied
each of the  900 000 SDSS galaxy images an average of 38 times
The popularity of Galaxy Zoo and the number of classications received enabled sci-
ence which simply would not have been possible without its contribution Not only does
Galaxy Zoo give a classication for each galaxy but also by collecting  40 independent
classications of each galaxy Galaxy Zoo produces an estimate of how likely that classi-

cation is to be be true a classication likelihood All of the data from this rst phase
of Galaxy Zoo were published in Lintott et al 2011 and are available to download via
the SDSS servers For an in-depth history and analysis of the Galaxy Zoo project see
Fortson et al 2012
61 Red Spirals
One of the biggest contributions of Galaxy Zoo has been in nding large samples of
rare classes of extragalactic object in the SDSS sample An example of this are the
red spirals  relatively rare spiral galaxies which are found on the red sequence rst
discussed in Bamford et al 2009 Skibba et al 2009 Due to the reddening eects of dust
a signicant number of edge-on spirals are found in the red sequence and spiral galaxies
with large central bulges can also be intrinsically very red due to old stars in the bulge
Masters et al 2010a however Galaxy Zoo revealed a signiant fraction of even late-
type spirals found on the red sequence Masters et al 2010b These are galaxies which
have small bulges but intrinsically red discs yet still show clear spiral arms The provide
a direct probe of evolution aecting star formation but not morphology revealing that
processes exist which can turn spiral galaxies red without disturbing their morphology
Even though these are relatively rare objects in the galaxy population studies have
suggested they form a signiant part of the route for most of the evolution from the blue
cloud to the red sequence both with increasing density in the local universe Bamford
et al 2009 and with redshift Bundy et al 2010 In Masters et al 2010b we revealed
that while these objects are most common in intermediate density regions as also shown
in Bamford et al 2009 and Skibba et al 2009 they are found even at very low densities
We demonstrated that compared to blue cloud spirals red spirals become more common
as spiral galaxies become more massive that they are not signicantly more dusty as
revealed by Balmer decrements but are signicantly more likely to host LINER Low
Ionization Nuclear Emission Region like emission and obvious bars The Galaxy Zoo red
spirals are not completely passive but at xed stellar mass show signicantly less star
formation and an older stellar population than their blue cousins
The red spirals have provided part of the evidence prompting a move from the view
of major mergers as the main route of galaxy evolution eg as presented in Steinmetz
 Navarro 2002 to more gentle and slower secular processes playing a signicant role
for most galaxies In order to make a spiral galaxy red by stopping star formation
something has happened to these galaxies to exhaust or remove their supply of atomic
hydrogen gas the raw material for star formation Its been discussed for many years
that in our galaxy the amount of gas in the disc will be used up by the current rate of
star formation in much less than a Hubble time Larson Tinsley  Caldwell 1980 and
evidence exists that this gas is being replenished by the infall and cooling of hot gas from
the halo for a review see Putman et al 2012 If this gas supply is shut o either by
being removed or heated by processes like strangulation or harassment Larson Tinsley
 Caldwell 1980 Balogh Navarro  Morris 2000 Bekki et al 2002 star formation will
cease and the disc redden on a timescale of  1 Gyr In fact recent work modelling the
star formation histories of the Galaxy Zoo red spirals compared to blue spirals and red
ellipticals supports this picture showing that the average star formation history of red
spirals only diers from blue spirals in the last 1 Gyr Tojeiro et al 2012
One of the most striking observations about the red spirals was that such a large
fraction of them were very strongly barred 75 Masters et al 2010b In much of the
study of galaxy evolution the division between barred and unbarred spirals has been

Figure 7 Full classication tree from Galaxy Zoo 2 First published in Masters et al 2011
ignored It has often been argued that these types of galaxies are intrinsically the same
just caught with or without a bar eg as recently discussed by van den Bergh 2011
even though most theoretical considerations now suggest bars must be very long lived
Around 30-60 of massive spirals host bars with the exact value depending on how
strict you are with the denition of what a bar is which can vary from a linear feature
stretching across most of the galaxy as in the classic example NGC 1300 to mild oval
distortions in the central regions
62 Galaxy Zoo 2 and Barred Spirals
At the time we noticed the large bar fraction in red spirals data from the second phase
of Galaxy Zoo was starting to become available Galaxies can show all sorts of interesting
structures beyond the simple split between spiral and elliptical and these features reveal
more clues to the formation histories of the galaxies Galaxy Zoo was so popular and
the results so reliable agreeing with experts just as well as experts are able to agree
with each other as discussed in Lintott et al 2008 that a new version was developed
asking for signicantly more detail for the brightest quarter of the original sample If a
galaxy was identied as being a disk or showing features this version asked questions
about the number of spiral arms size of the bulge and most importantly for us the
presence of a bar The full classication scheme for Galaxy Zoo 2 GZ2 is shown in
Figure 7 reproduced from Masters et al 2011 This version of the site launched in
February 2009 and ran for fourteen months collecting in that time 60 million individual
classications of the images
The rst science result from GZ2 were a study of the bar fraction of disc galaxies as a
function of colour This work Masters et al 2011 demonstrated that the types of bars
revealed by GZ2 were signicantly more common in redder more massive disc galaxies
 with the extreme of this being the red spirals among with 75 showed bars This work
also revealed a split in bar fraction between disc galaxies with large and small bulges
 which have been shown to be very similar to the classical strong bars identied in early
visual catalogues - see Masters et al 2012 for a discussion
Karen L Masters
as revealed by ts to the light prole from SDSS such that bulge dominated spirals
showed more bars These types of trends of bar fraction with galaxy colour have also
been seen in the local universe by Nair  Abraham 2010 and Giordarno et al 2010
and at higher redshift by Sheth et al 2008 The GZ2 results also hinted at an upturn
of the bar fraction in the bluest and lowest mass disc galaxies as observed more clearly
by Barazza et al 2009 and Aguerri et al 2009 in disc galaxy samples dominated by
these kinds of galaxies
The striking thing about our theoretical understanding of bars in disc galaxies is that
forming a bar in a disc galaxy is extremely easy The question is not why some galaxies
make them but why some do not or have not yet
While a bar is forming it enables the exchange of angular momentum in a disc galaxy
 basically moving material around This has the eect of growing central concentrations
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 sparking central star formation eg as observed by Sheth
et al 2005 Ellison et al 2011 and possibly helping to feed central active galactic nuclei
although this is more controversial eg Ho et al 1997 or Oh et al 2012 Cardamone
et al in prep Theoretical considerations indicate that the gas content of a galaxy is
important in this process eg Athanassoula 2003 Combes 2008 By virtue of being able
to dissipate energy gas is an important sink of angular momentum and any galaxy with
a signicant gas fraction in simulations struggles to develop a large bar eg Villa-Vargas
et al 2010 while in a simulation of a gas poor disc bars can be very stable and long
The eective forces produced by the bar instability act to drive gas inwards from co-
rotation the point at which stars in the disk rotate with the same speed as the pattern
speed of the bar to the central regions This gas looses its angular momentum which is
transfered to the stars in the bar Interestingly the forces outside the ends of the bar
may also act to inhibit inow of gas from the outer regions of the disc so that gas inow
of external gas onto a disc galaxy is inhibited in the presence of a strong bar Combes
2008 It is possible that this process could play a role in the global reddening of disc
galaxies and while the concentration of gas in the centres of galaxies caused by the bar
will spark central star formation it evacuates gas from the rest of the disc preventing
star formation there and potentially helps to use up the total gas content of the galaxy
quicker
63 Bars and Atomic Gas Content
The discovery that the type of strong or obvious bars easily identied in GZ2 classica-
tions are more common in more massive redder disc galaxies already implies that bars
are more often found in gas poor disc galaxies since optical colour is a good proxy for
current star formation rate which correlates well with gas content However we wanted
to investigate more directly the role of gas content on the likelihood of a galaxy hosting
The Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Arecibo L-band Feed Array survey ALFALFA
Giovanelli et al 2005 provide the ideal data to do this matched well to the available
GZ2 bar sample ALFALFA has mapped all of the high Galactic latitude sky visible
from the Arecibo Radio Telescope which is located in Puerto Rico in the 21cm line
emitted by neutral hydrogen atoms HI This is giving an amazing census of the atomic
hydrogen gas content of all galaxies in this part of the sky which overlaps much of the
SDSS Legacy Imaging area in which Galaxy Zoo galaxies are selected In Masters et
al 2012 we constructed a sample of 2090 disc galaxies with bar identications from
GZ2 and neutral hydrogen detections from the 40 of ALFALFA available at the time
Haynes et al 2011 Our main result was that we conrmed observationally that bars are
A Zoo of Galaxies
more likely to be found in galaxies with less gas In fact we showed that this is also true
in galaxies which have less gas than is typical for their stellar mass and optical colour
and perhaps more interestingly that disc galaxies with both gas and bars are optically
redder than similar disc galaxies with gas and no bar  perhaps the rst direct evidence
that the bar could be helping to globally redden its host galaxy
This is a work in progress with many more interesting results coming out on the
GZ2 bars For example in Hoyle et al 2011 we demonstrated that redder disc galaxies
not only host more bars but that these bars are also longer and therefore stronger In
Skibba et al 2012 we provided the rst clear evidence for an environmental eect on bar
formation nding more bars in galaxies clustered on certain scales even when corrected
for galaxy mass and colour Casteels et al 2012 shows that in close pairs bar formation
is suppressed and Cardamone et al in prep will show that once corrected for galaxy
mass we observe no correlation between active galactic nuclei and bars identied in GZ2
All of this is providing vital clues to reveal the role of bars on the global evolution of disc
galaxies
7 Whats Next for the Zoo
The popularity of Galaxy Zoo was both immediate and long lasting and raised ques-
tions very early on with the science team about why so many people would choose to
spend so much time classifying galaxies online A survey was launched to study the mo-
tivations of the citizen scientists participating in Galaxy Zoo which was published by
Raddick et al 2010 For a scientist involved in research using the Galaxy Zoo classi-
cations the most striking things about this survey was that so many people identied
a desire to help with scientic research as their main motivation This means that the
scientic results coming out of Galaxy Zoo are essential to the ongoing success of the
project in attracting and retaining volunteer classiers Fortunately Galaxy Zoo was de-
signed with specic and immediate science questions to answer The rst publications
from Galaxy Zoo came out within a year of launch Lintott et al 2008 Land et al 2008
and the total number of peer reviewed papers based on Galaxy Zoo data is now more
than 30 with a growing number of results from scientists not involved in the Galaxy Zoo
project and using the publicly released GZ1 data The classications from GZ2 are also
in the process of being prepared for public release A selection of papers from the Galaxy
Zoo team are listed in Table 1
Galaxy Zoo was a pioneer in what has becoming a new methodology of involving
citizen scientists in research The Zooniverse was launched in December 2009 on the
back of the success of Galaxy Zoo and provides a framework for collecting a variety of
similar projects This umbrella now includes several other astronomically themed projects
eg Milky Way Project Moon Zoo Supernova Zoo Solar Stormwatch but also projects
in other areas of science such as Old Weather extracting climate data from handwritten
ship logbooks WhaleFM comparing whale song Cell Slider identifying cancer cells
in images and even non science projects eg Ancient Lives which attempts to piece
together scraps of papyrus All of these and more can be accessed via the main Zooniverse
website
The Zooniverse team are also working on tools to improve the educational use of
these sites They provide a way to involve school children in real hands on science but
working out how to include this in lesson plans has proved dicult Recently launched

Quantifying Morphological Indicators of Galaxy Interaction
was Galaxy Zoo Navigator which allows a group to collect their classications together
and use online tools to explore how these depend on other galaxy properties from SDSS
data This increases the learning potential from Galaxy Zoo The Zooniverse also hosts
a website called Zooteach for teachers and educators to share lesson plans and ideas
for the use of Zooniverse projects in the classroom
Galaxy Zoo itself remains one of the most successful and popular of the Zooniverse sites
Following GZ2 Galaxy Zoo Hubble ran April 2010-September 2012 collecting classi-
cations on galaxies observed by the Hubble Space Telescope eg as part of COSMOS
GOODS EDS and other large surveys Shortly after this Invited Discourse Galaxy
Zoo relaunched in its fourth version now including images of galaxies from the HST
CANDELS survey as well as new images of galaxies from the SDSS-III imaging area
Ill nish by just saying thank you to all of the more than 200000 volunteers who
have helped make galaxy classications via the Galaxy Zoo website by using the special
galaxy font they helped make Fig 8 To anyone who has not yet tried out Galaxy
Zoo Id like to encourage you to come and play in our Xing X Zong Dong Yuan
Galaxy Zoo in Chinese

Id like to thank the organisers of the 28th GA of the IAU for inviting me to give this
This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 200000
volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project Their contributions are individually acknowledged

I acknowledge funding from the Peter and Patricia Gruber Foundation as the 2008
Peter and Patricia Gruber Foundation IAU Fellow and from a 2010 Leverhulme Trust
Early Career Fellowship as well as support from the Royal Astronomical Society to
attend the 28th GA of the IAU
Thanks to Dongai for helping with my Chinese introductory remarks to the Invited
Discourse
