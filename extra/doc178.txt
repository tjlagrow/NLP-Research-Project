ABSTRACT
Morphological and spectroscopic studies of high redshift clusters indicate that a signicant fraction of present-
day early-type galaxies was transformed from star forming galaxies at z  1 On the other hand the slow luminos-
ity evolution of early-type galaxies and the low scatter in their color-magnitude relation indicate a high formation
redshift of their stars In this paper we construct models which reconcile these apparently contradictory lines
of evidence and we quantify the effects of morphological evolution on the observed photometric properties of
early-type galaxies in distant clusters We show that in the case of strong morphological evolution the apparent
luminosity and color evolution of early-type galaxies are similar to that of a single age stellar population formed
at z   irrespective of the true star formation history of the galaxies Furthermore the scatter in age and hence
the scatter in color and luminosity is approximately constant with redshift These results are consequences of
the progenitor bias the progenitors of the youngest low redshift early-type galaxies drop out of the sample at
high redshift We construct models which reproduce the observed evolution of the number fraction of early-type
galaxies in rich clusters and their color and luminosity evolution simultaneously Our modelling indicates that
 50  of early-type galaxies were transformed from other galaxy types at z  1 and their progenitor galaxies
may have had roughly constant star formation rates prior to morphological transformation The effect of the pro-
genitor bias on the evolution of the mean M L ratio and color can be estimated The progenitor bias is a linear
function of the scatter in the color-magnitude relation produced by age variations and is maximal if the observed
scatter is entirely due to age differences After correcting the observed evolution of the mean M LB ratio for the
maximum progenitor bias we nd that the mean luminosity weighted formation redshift of stars in early-type

1 INTRODUCTION
Early-type galaxies elliptical and S0 galaxies constitute
 80  of the galaxy population in the central regions of nearby
rich clusters Dressler 1980 and studies of nearby and distant
clusters have provided strong constraints on their evolution and
formation
The cluster observations have been used to constrain the stel-
lar ages of early-type galaxies On one hand there is very good
evidence that early-type galaxies form a very homogeneous
slowly evolving population the scatter in their colors is small
both at low redshift eg Bower Lucey  Ellis 1992 and at
high redshift Ellis et al 1997 Stanford Eisenhardt  Dick-
inson 1998 the scatter in their mass-to-light ratios is equally
small eg Lucey et al 1991 Pahre Djorgovski  de Carvalho
1998 Kelson et al 2000 and the evolution of their mass-to-
light ratios is slow van Dokkum  Franx 1996 Kelson et al
1997 Bender et al 1998 van Dokkum et al 1998a These re-
sults indicate a very high redshift of formation for the stars in
early-type galaxies As an example van Dokkum et al 1998a
found from the evolution of the Fundamental Plane relation to
z  083 that the stars in massive early-type galaxies must have
formed at z  28 for m  03   0 and a Salpeter 1955

IMF Furthermore the low scatter in colors and M L ratios im-
plies that the scatter in ages at any redshift is very small eg
Ellis et al 1997 Stanford et al 1998
On the other hand evidence is accumulating that many early-
type galaxies in clusters were relatively recently transformed
from star forming galaxies Dressler et al 1997 report a high
fraction of spiral galaxies in clusters at 03  z  05 These
galaxies are nearly absent in nearby rich clusters Dressler
1980 and hence must have transformed into early-type galax-
ies between z  05 and z  0 Other studies eg Couch et
al 1998 van Dokkum et al 2000 have conrmed this trend
and extended it to z  08 Dressler et al 1997 found that
the increased fraction of spiral galaxies at high redshift was
accompanied by a low fraction of S0 galaxies and concluded
that the z  04 spiral galaxies transformed into S0 galaxies
Other studies have found evidence for merging and interactions
in high redshift clusters Lavery  Henry 1988 Lavery Pierce
 McClure 1992 Dressler et al 1994 Couch et al 1998 van
Dokkum et al 1999 These transformations may provide a
way to form young elliptical galaxies in the clusters at late
times The morphological evidence for recent and rapid evolu-
tion in the cluster galaxy population is supported by photomet-
Early-Type Galaxies in Clusters
galaxy can be described by three parameters the time when
star formation starts the time when star formation stops and
the variation of star formation between the start and end The
star formation is allowed to increase or decrease with time It
is assumed that the galaxy is classied as an early-type galaxy
some time after the cessation of starformation We assume that
the galaxies do not stop their star formation at the same time
but rather have a distribution of cessation times
ric and spectroscopic studies which have found a signicant
increase of the number fractions of star forming and post star
burst galaxies from z  0 to z  1 eg Butcher  Oemler 1978
1984 Dressler  Gunn 1983 Couch  Sharples 1987 Post-
man Lubin  Oke 1998 Poggianti et al 1999 van Dokkum et
al 2000 Hence the evidence appears secure that many early-
type galaxies in clusters were transformed from star forming
galaxies at fairly recent times
The purpose of this paper is to produce models which can
bring these apparently different lines of evidence regarding the
ages into agreement Specically we analyse the effects of
late morphological transformations as found by Dressler et al
and others on the observed evolution of colors and luminosi-
ties with redshift We show that the effect of progenitor bias
Franx  van Dokkum 1996 van Dokkum et al 2000 can be
very signicant if early-type galaxies were transformed from
other galaxy types at late times the youngest progenitors of
present-day early-type galaxies drop out of the sample of early-
type galaxies at high redshift Hence the samples of galaxies
at low and high redshift are not the same and in particular
the high redshift samples might be biased towards the oldest
progenitors of present-day early-type galaxies The purpose of
this paper is to quantify the effects of progenitor bias and to
estimate the corrections which are required for models which
ignore morphological evolution To that end we construct rela-
tively simple models for the history of star formation and mor-
phological type of cluster early-type galaxies We show that
the observed slow luminosity evolution and low scatter in the
color-magnitude relation and the Fundamental Plane are natu-
ral consequences of recent and ongoing assembly of early-type
galaxies We correct the observed evolution for the progenitor
bias and derive the corrected mean age of the stars in early-type
galaxies
Our models are extensions of the earlier work by van
Dokkum et al 1998b Bower et al 1998 and Shioya  Bekki
1998 These authors considered complex star formation his-
tories of cluster galaxies but did not investigate the effects of
morphological transformations on the observed properties of
early-type galaxies at high redshift The progenitor bias is im-
plicitly included in the very detailed semi-analytical models by
for example Kauffman  Charlot 1998 and Baugh Cole 
Frenk 1996 In these complex models it is difcult to iso-
late and quantify specic effects such as the progenitor bias
The main contribution of our work is that we use simple ana-
lytic models with only three free parameters which allows us
to provide explicit estimates for the effects of morphological
evolution on the observed colors and luminosities of early-type
galaxies
2 MODELING
We construct simple models for the evolution of early-type
galaxies which parameterize both their star formation history
and morphological evolution Our models allow the full his-
tory to be quantied by three parameters They are not based
on a full physical description of the formation and evolution of
galaxies as derived by eg Kauffmann White  Guiderdoni
1993 and Baugh et al 1996
21 Basic Description
We assume that early-type galaxies have similar histories of
star formation and morphology The history of each individual
This description is fairly generic for many detailed theories
of galaxy formation We do not dene the processes driving
the morphological transformation and the cessation of star for-
mation Various processes have been invoked including gas
stripping of spiral galaxies eg Gunn  Gott 1972 Tytler 
Vidal 1978 Abadi Moore  Bower 1999 Kodama  Smail
2000 tidal interactions eg Fried 1988 Moore et al 1996
and mergers eg Lavery et al 1992 van Dokkum et al 1999
It does not matter in our analysis what process causes the cessa-
tion of star formation and we allow for bursts of star formation
to accompany this event
The transition phase between star forming galaxy and early-
type galaxy is assumed to last for a signicant time
diately after the cessation of star formation galaxies are likely
to show tidal features in case of an interaction or merger or
weak spiral arms The morphologies of EA or post star burst
galaxies seem to be consistent with this scenario They gener-
ally are classied as early-type spirals or tidally distorted sys-
tems Poggianti et al 1999 Fabricant et al 2000 van Dokkum
et al 2000 It is not well known how long it takes before these
structures fade or disperse we assume that early-type galaxies
are rst classied as such  15 Gyr after star formation in their
progenitors ceased
In the current Section we do not specify whether the models
apply to elliptical galaxies S0 galaxies or both Observation-
ally the early-type galaxy fraction is more robust than the rel-
ative numbers of elliptical galaxies and S0 galaxies eg Fab-
ricant Franx  van Dokkum 2000 van Dokkum et al 2000
If different histories apply to the two classes of galaxies two
separate models will be needed for each sub-class We explore
such models in Section 5
The generic effects of late morphological transitions are il-
lustrated in Fig 1 In panel a the evolution of the mass-to-
light ratio is shown for a population of galaxies with a small
range in age without any late morphological transitions As can
be seen galaxies with young stellar populations evolve more
rapidly than galaxies with old stellar populations and hence
the spread in M L ratios increases with redshift panel b The
mean evolution is faster than that of a single age population
formed at z   which is indicated by the dashed line in b
This type of modelling has been used extensively to constrain
the ages of early-type galaxies in clusters if there are no mor-
phological transitions the evolution of the mean color or lumi-
nosity constrains the mean age of early-type galaxies and the
scatter constrains the spread in ages eg Bower Lucey  El-
lis 1992 Ellis et al 1997 van Dokkum et al 1998ab Bower
et al 1998 Stanford et al 1998 Ferreras  Silk 2000
In panel c a model is shown in which galaxies are trans-
formed into early-type galaxies at a constant rate The broken
lines indicate galaxies before they are recognized as early-type
galaxies
It can easily be seen that the sample of early-type
galaxies at high redshift is a small subsample of all galaxies
which are classied as early-type galaxies at z  0 The two
samples are therefore not directly comparable and erroneous
van Dokkum  Franx
Fig 1 Illustration of the evolution of early-type galaxies in traditional models ab and in models with morphological evolution cd Lines
in a and c show the evolution of individual galaxies with a range of ages The dashed sections of the curves in c indicate that the galaxies
are not yet recognized as early-type galaxies Panels b and d show the evolution of the mean M L ratio in these two models The scatter is
indicated by the width of the hatched regions The dashed line shows the evolution of a single age stellar population formed at z   In models
with morphological evolution the mean M L ratio evolves slowly and the scatter is roughly constant because more and more young galaxies drop
out of the sample at high redshift
results are derived if morphological evolution is ignored As
a result the evolution in the mean M L ratio of the early-type
galaxies is very slow panel d The slope of the M L  z relation
is comparable to the slope for a single stellar population which
formed at z   indicated by the dashed line even though the
mean formation redshift of the stars in all early-type galaxies at
z  0 is low at hzi  2 Even more remarkable is the fact that
the scatter in M L ratios is virtually constant These effects are
caused by the fact that the youngest galaxies continuously drop
out of the sample going to higher redshifts In the subsections
below we specify a broader range of models and explore the
consequences
22 Model Parameters and Methodology
The full models are quantied by three parameters tstart the
time when star formation starts stop the time scale which char-
acterizes the distribution of times when star formation stops
and f which describes the star formation rate between the start
and end of star formation The last two parameters are dened
in the following way
The parameter stop determines the probability distribution
of tstop the time when star formation stops for an individual
galaxy
Ptstop  expcid18-
stopcid19 
We show later that this expression can provide a satisfactory t
to the data If stop  t0 with t0 the present age of the Universe
star formation in the progenitors terminated at very high red-
shift At the other extreme stop   corresponds to a constant
transformation rate For each individual galaxy the morpholog-
ical transformation to early-type galaxy occurs at tstop  01t0
ie  15 Gyr after truncation of star formation
The parameter f characterizes the variation of the star for-
mation rate The star formation history of the galaxies can in-
clude bursts and increasing or decreasing continuous formation
rates as a function of time After star formation ceases the lu-
minosity and color evolution of such a complex population is
well approximated by a single age population of stars with the
same luminosity weighted mean age eg van Dokkum et al
1998b
Hence for each galaxy we approximate the evolution of the
complex population by that of a single age population formed
at t  t with
t  ftstop  1 -
ftstart
Early-Type Galaxies in Clusters
For f  1 the stellar population is dominated by a burst at the
end of the star formation history and for f  0 the population
is dominated by a burst at the start of the star formation history
If the star formation rate is approximately constant from t  tstart
to t  tstop then f  05
We tested the accuracy of our approach by calculating the
luminosity and color evolution of galaxies with complex star
formation histories eg an exponentially declining star forma-
tion rate followed by a star burst and comparing the results
to predictions from single burst models with the same values of
f After transformation to early-type galaxy ie  15 Gyr af-
ter star formation has ceased our approximation of luminosity
and color evolution is accurate to a few percent Three possible
star formation histories of early-type galaxies are shown in Fig
2 The model with f  07 has a star burst at the end of its
star formation history and may be appropriate for spiral galax-
ies falling into clusters or mergers Although these histories
are quite complex  15 Gyr after star formation has ceased
their evolution is similar to that of single age stellar populations
formed at t  ftstop  1 -
ftstart
Fig 2 Illustration of our parameterization Galaxies start forming
stars at tstart and star formation terminates at tstop Galaxies do not stop
their star formation at the same time but have a distribution of ces-
sation times parameterized by the transformation timescale stop The
star formation history between tstart and tstop can be quite complex and
may include star bursts It is parameterized by the parameter f which
describes whether star formation is more weighted towards tstart or tstop
Our parameterization allows straightforward computation of
luminosities and colors of galaxies because the luminosity evo-
lution of a single age stellar population can be approximated by
a power law eg Tinsley 1980 Worthey 1994 Therefore to
good approximation
t
The coefcient  depends on the passband the IMF and the
metallicity In this paper we will limit the discussion to rest
frame B band luminosities and rest frame U - B colors Our
results can easily be expressed in other rest frame bands The
Worthey 1994 models give B  091 and U  107 for solar
metallicity and a Salpeter 1955 IMF The color evolution can
be approximated by
 t -
tU - B 
Expressed in magnitudes color and luminosity evolution are
related through
U - B  U - B
 018B
in these models The evolution of the mean color and scatter in
the color will therefore be similar to the scaled evolution of the
mean M L ratio and its scatter
In the following we use Monte-Carlo simulations to calcu-
late model predictions for given values of stop f and tstart
This approach has the advantage that the mean and scatter in
colors and luminosities at a given time can be computed using
the same methods as for the observations In the simulations
all galaxies start out as star forming objects at t  tstart Each
galaxy is assigned a value for tstop the time when star formation
ceases The distribution of tstop is given by Eq 1 with boundary
condition 0  tstop  09t0 with t0 the present age of the Uni-
verse At each timestep t objects which satisfy the condition
tstop  01t0  t are selected as early-type galaxies Using Eq
3 and 4 these galaxies are assigned a luminosity and a color
The central value and the spread of the color and luminosity
distribution at time t are calculated with the biweight statistic
Beers Flynn  Gebhardt 1990 This statistic was also used
by Stanford et al 1998 and van Dokkum et al 1998b 2000
to calculate the scatter in the high redshift color-magnitude re-
lation We note that the evolution of the mean M L ratio and
colors of early-type galaxies can also be evaluated analytically
In Appendix A we give approximate expressions which can be
used for most applications
23 Examples of Models with Progenitor Bias
We calculate the predicted evolution of the M L ratio and its
scatter for several models To demonstrate the effects of pro-
genitor bias we consider two classes of models one with mild
morphological evolution stop  02t0 and one with strong mor-
phological evolution stop  05t0 Figure 3 shows the results
In models with stop  02t0 morphological evolution is not
very important to z  1 and  80  of present-day early-type
galaxies were already in place at that redshift In models with
stop  05t0 on the other hand only  50  of early-type galax-
ies were in place at z  1 In all panels of Fig 3 broken lines
show the class of models with mild morphological evolution
and solid lines show models with strong morphological evolu-
231 Effect of Varying the Star Formation History
Panels a b and c show the effect of changing the star
formation history while keeping the time of onset of star forma-
tion xed at tstart  0 The results for the evolution of the mean
M L ratio are shown in panel a Quite remarkably nearly all
van Dokkum  Franx
Fig 3 Predicted evolution of the mean M L ratio and its scatter in various models with progenitor bias In all panels solid lines show models
with strong morphological evolution to z  1 stop  05t0 and broken lines show models with mild morphological evolution stop  02t0 Panels
abc demonstrate the effect of varying the star formation history parameterized by f The evolution of the mean M L ratio panel a is remarkably
similar in all models whereas the scatter panel b and the progenitor bias panel c are very sensitive to the star formation history Panels def
show the effect of varying the time of onset of star formation tstart Varying tstart has a large effect on the evolution of the mean M L ratio as well
as on the scatter and the progenitor bias The models indicate that the observed transformation rate and the observed scatter sufce to predict the
progenitor bias
model predictions lie very close to the line for old populations
which formed at the start of the Universe zform   We nd
little dependence on the tranformation time scale stop or on f
which characterizes the star formation history This result illus-
trates the dramatic effects of the progenitor bias as the mean
stellar age of the galaxies at z  0 can be as low as half the age
of the Universe for f  1 and yet the apparent evolution fol-
lows the relation for very old populations formed at innite red-
shift The reason for this behaviour is that the formation models
are almost scale free In models with a constant transformation
rate at any time the youngest half of the galaxies have been
added to the sample in the last half of the age of the Universe at
that time As a result the mean stellar age of the galaxies is an
almost constant fraction of the age of the Universe independent
of the star formation histories of individual galaxies and the
mean mass-to-light ratios and colors will evolve as if the stars
formed at very high redshift In the Appendix we demonstrate
this effect analytically The absolute colors and mass-to-light
ratios at z  0 will be different for these models but these are
notoriously difcult to interpret uniquely eg Worthey 1994
Faber et al 1999
Fortunately the scatter in M L ratios and colors is much more
sensitive to the transformation timescale and star formation his-
tories We show the scatter in M L ratios in panel b For a
given morphological transformation rate the variation in the av-
erage scatter is large because it is a strong function of the star
formation history of galaxies As we will see later this implies
that observations of the scatter put important constraints on the
models For galaxies with later star formation f increases
and the scatter increases almost linearly with f For the limit-
ing case of a constant transformation rate stop   we nd
that the scatter is well approximated by ln M LB  03 f see
Appendix The scatter is not strongly dependent on redshift be-
cause of the scale-free nature of the models In such scale-free
models the relative age differences between early-type galax-
ies at any epoch is fairly constant The scatter is proportional
to the age differences between galaxies relative to the mean age
eg van Dokkum et al 1998b As galaxies are continuously
added to the sample the range in ages increases at the same rate
as the mean age hence the spread in ages relative to the mean
age remains constant In the Appendix this effect is demon-
strated analytically Only in models with mild morphological
evolution to z  1 indicated by the broken lines in Fig 3 we
nd an increase of the scatter with redshift In these models the
scatter is very low at z  0 and at z  05 reaches values similar
to those in models with strong morphological evolution
The progenitor bias of the models is shown in panel c We
dene the progenitor bias at given redshift as the difference be-
tween the M L ratio of early-type galaxies and the M L ratio of
all progenitors of present-day early-type galaxies This is the
error in the observed M L ratio that is caused by the late ad-
dition of early-type galaxies to the sample As the gure shows
the bias increases with increasing tranformation time scale stop
and increasing f Both parameters also cause the scatter to in-
crease For models with strong morphological evolution the
progenitor bias can be approximated by
biasln M LB  13  scatterln M LB  z
This approximation is accurate to  10  for stop  05t0 This
result suggests that the progenitor bias can be estimated on the
basis of the observed transformation rate and the observed scat-
ter The star formation history is the individual galaxies as
parametrized by f is not needed to estimate the effect This is
a very useful result as it is difcult to constrain the value of f
directly from the observed colors and luminosities
232 Effect of Varying the Time of Onset of Star Formation
Panels d e and f show the effect of changing the time
of onset of star formation tstart while keeping the star formation
history constant at f  05 ie approximately constant star
formation from tstart to tstop The evolution of the mean M L ra-
tio for the various models is shown in panel f The evolution
is very sensitive to the time of onset of star formation there is
an almost linear relation between the time when star formation
commences and the rate of M L evolution The reason for this
behaviour is that the mean age of the stellar population in all
galaxies is lower for higher values of tstart As will be shown
in Sect 3 the observed evolution of the mean M L ratio places
strong constraints on the time when star formation commenced
in early-type galaxies
The scatter and the progenitor bias are shown in panels e
and f They both depend on the value of tstart such that the
scatter is higher and the progenitor bias stronger for later onset
of star formation As a result of this dual dependence the rela-
tion between the progenitor bias and the observed scatter Eq
7 is not very sensitive to the value of tstart once again indicat-
ing that the observed rate of morphological evolution and the
observed scatter sufce to estimate the progenitor bias
3 APPLICATION TO OBSERVATIONS
The models described in the previous Section can be applied
to observations of early-type galaxies in clusters at 0  z  1
Parameters to t are the evolution of i the early-type galaxy
fraction ii the mean M LB ratio as determined from the Fun-
damental Plane iii the scatter in M LB and iv the scatter
in the color-magnitude relation Free parameters are the mor-
phological transformation rate parameterized by stop and the
star formation histories of galaxies prior to the transformations
parameterized by f and tstart
31 Data
The evolution of the early-type galaxy fraction in clusters is
shown in Fig 4a taken from van Dokkum et al 2000 Data
points are from Dressler 1980 Andreon Davoust  Heim
1997 Dressler et al 1997 Lubin et al 1998 Fabricant
et al 2000 and van Dokkum et al 2000 The early-type
fraction decreases by a factor  2 from z  0 to z  1 The
scatter around the downward trend is signicant and it will be
interesting in the future to explore systematic differences in the
Early-Type Galaxies in Clusters
evolution depending on cluster type In this Section we do not
distinguish elliptical galaxies and S0 galaxies within the class
of early-type galaxies In Sect 5 we explore models in which
both classes are modeled separately
The evolution of the early-type galaxy fraction is possibly in-
uenced by the inclusion of low mass galaxies undergoing star
bursts Since the samples are magnitude selected the presence
of such galaxies at high redshift would decrease the fraction of
early-type galaxies and would be unrelated to the evolution of
massive galaxies For the cluster MS 1054- 03 at z  083 we
have a large data set of conrmed members with accurate col-
ors van Dokkum et al 2000 and we tested the importance of
this effect by determining the early-type galaxy fraction among
red galaxies alone If we limit the analysis to red galaxies with
U - Bz  03 the early-type fraction changes from 45  to
52  This result indicates that the brightening of low mass
galaxies has a minor effect on the fraction of early-type galax-
ies Other effects may have the opposite effect As an example
biases introduced by the selection of the clusters themselves
probably cause us to underestimate the evolution of the early-
type galaxy fraction see eg Kauffmann 1995
The evolution of the rest frame M LB ratio with redshift is
shown in Fig 4b and is taken from van Dokkum et al 1998a
Data are from Jrgensen et al 1996 van Dokkum  Franx
1996 Kelson et al 1997 and van Dokkum et al 1998a
The M L ratio evolution is derived from the evolution of the
zeropoint of the Fundamental Plane relation see van Dokkum
 Franx 1996 The evolution is well determined because the
Fundamental Plane has very small scatter
The scatter in lnM LB is shown in Fig 4c The data point
at z  0 is from Jrgensen et al 1996 Data points at higher
redshift are from Kelson et al 2000 z  033 Kelson et al
1997 z  058 and van Dokkum et al 1998a z  083
The highest redshift points have considerable uncertainty be-
cause they are derived from small samples
The scatter in the U - B color-magnitude relation is taken
from van Dokkum et al 2000 and shown in Fig 4d Data
are from Stanford et al 1998 Bower Lucey  Ellis 1992
Ellis et al 1997 van Dokkum et al 1998b and van Dokkum
et al 2000 The observations were brought to a common rest
frame band by using U - B  14B - V  and U - B 
06U - V  as derived from the Worthey 1994 models The
scatter is roughly constant with redshift at U - B  003
magnitudes
32 Constraints on Model Parameters
321 Transformation Time Scale
The observed evolution of the early-type galaxy fraction di-
rectly constrains the transformation time scale stop This is
demonstrated in Fig 3a which shows the redshift dependence
of the transformed galaxy fraction for different values of the
transformation time scale
We varied the transformation time scale between stop  0 and
stop   If stop  0 all morphological transformations occur at
very high redshift and if stop   the transformation rate is con-
stant The observed evolution of the early-type galaxy fraction
shown in Fig 4a gives a best tting value of stop  05t0
Values between 03t0 and 17t0 are consistent with the data at
the 90  condence level
The clusters in Fig 4a form a very heterogeneous sam-
ple and a potential worry is that the evolution is severely af-
fected by selection biases As a test of the robustness of the

sue in Sect 5
322 Star Formation Histories
We next explore models with the best t transformation time
stop  05t0 and we vary the time of onset of star formation tstart
and the parameter describing the star formation history f
As demonstrated in the previous Section the rate of evolution
of the mean M L ratio has an approximately linear dependence
on the value of tstart The observed evolution shown in Fig 4b
is very slow The dashed line indicates a simple single burst
model with zform   This model provides a good t to the
data as was previously shown by van Dokkum et al 1998a
We nd a best tting value of tstart  003t0 Values between
tstart  0 and tstart  02t0 are consistent with the data at the 90 
condence level The implication is that star formation com-
menced at high redshift z  25 in early-type galaxies The
line in Fig 4b shows the best tting model with tstart  0
As was demonstrated in Sect 2 the star formation history
between tstart and tstop is constrained by the observed scatter in
M L ratio and color This strong dependence of the scatter on
the star formation history was discussed earlier by van Dokkum
et al 1998b and Bower et al 1998 in the context of tradi-
tional models which do not include morphological evolution
If all scatter in the color-magnitude relation and the Fundamen-
tal Plane is produced by age variations the best tting model
has f  052 ie an approximately constant star formation
rate with values to f  062 consistent with the data at the
90  condence level The lines in Fig 4c and d show the
model with f  05 For values of f lower than 05 the scat-
ter is underpredicted and additional scatter due to eg merg-
ing metallicity variations or dust is allowed As an example
the broken lines show a model with stop  05t0 tstart  0 and
f  025 The preferred values of f  05 correspond to grad-
ual star formation histories similar to those depicted in the up-
per two panels of Fig 2
33 The Progenitor Bias
Our best tting model has stop  05t0 t0  0 and f  05
The progenitor bias expressed as the difference between the
observed M L ratio of early-type galaxies and the M L ratio
Early-Type Galaxies in Clusters
of all progenitors of early-type galaxies in nearby clusters is
shown in Fig 4e The progenitor bias is maximal if f  05
in which case the scatter in the CM relation and the FP is en-
tirely produced by age variations In this extreme model the
progenitor bias is approximately 02  z in ln M LB or 004  z
in U - B color
We stress that these values are upper limits because the scat-
ter can be caused by other effects than age As shown in the
previous Section the progenitor bias scales linearly with the
scatter introduced by age variations For example if f  025
the scatter due to age is only half the observed scatter In this
case the progenitor bias is only 01  z in ln M LB indicated by
the broken line in Fig 4e
It is interesting to compare these results to the simple scaling
with the observed scatter that was derived in Sect 231 Us-
ing the observed scatter of  015 in ln M LB Eq 231 gives
a progenitor bias of  02z identical to the value we derived
from the full tting of the models to the observations This
remarkable agreement demonstrates quantitatively that the ob-
served transformation rate and the observed scatter sufce to
predict the progenitor bias In particular knowledge of the de-
tailed star formation histories of the galaxies tstart and f in our
models is not required
34 Dependence on Cosmology
We used m  03 and   0 to calculate the model predic-
tions and the data points shown in Fig 4 The models depend
on the cosmological model because of the conversion from time
to redshift The observed evolution of the mean M L ratio also
depends on the cosmology because effective radii of galaxies
are measured in arcseconds As demonstrated in Bender et al
1998 and van Dokkum et al 1998a the dependencies can be
quite strong and the observed evolution of ln M LB provides an
upper limit on m assuming the slope of the IMF is not sig-
nicantly steeper than the Salpeter 1955 value Note that the
models and data shown in Fig 4 are not dependent on the Hub-
ble constant because the luminosity evolution of stellar popu-
lations can be approximated by a power law and all data points
are relative to nearby clusters
Our results are very similar for a Universe with a cosmolog-
ical constant m  03 and   07 The predicted evolution
of the early-type galaxy fraction remains virtually unaffected
and the best tting value for the transformation time scale re-
mains stop  05t0 The observed evolution of the mean M LB
ratio is more rapid in this cosmology and is no longer well tted
by models with extremely high formation redshift of the stellar
population see also van Dokkum et al 1998a Models with
tstart  0 predict too slow evolution and good ts are obtained
for tstart  015t0 Because the stellar populations of early-type
galaxies are younger for tstart  0 the predicted scatter in M L
ratios and colors is higher for a given value of f As a result
the observed scatter is best tted for f  04 in this cosmology
as compared to f  05 for a Universe without cosmological
constant
4 CORRECTING FOR PROGENITOR BIAS
The evolution of the M L ratio can be corrected for progen-
itor bias Our best tting model indicates that the observed
evolution of the M L ratio underestimates the true evolution
by  02  z in lnhM LBi and  004  z in hU - Bi
van Dokkum et al 1998b found lnhM LBi  - 09  01z
for m  03 and   0 or lnhM LBi  - 11  01z for
m  03 and   07 The evolution after applying the max-
imum correction for progenitor bias is lnhM LBi  - 11z or
lnhM LBi  - 13z for positive cosmological constant We
conclude that the progenitor bias has a small  20  but non-
negligible effect on the observed evolution of the mean M L
ratio from z  0 to z  1 The corrections are upper limits be-
cause it is assumed that the scatter in luminosities and colors is
entirely due to age variations among the galaxies
The observed evolution of the mean color and M L ratio of
early-type galaxies indicates a very high redshift of formation
for their stars eg van Dokkum  Franx 1996 Schade Barri-
entos  Lopez-Cruz 1997 Stanford et al 1998 van Dokkum
et al 1998a Kodama et al 1998 Because the true evolution
of early-type galaxies is underestimated as a result of the pro-
genitor bias the ages of their stars are overestimated
We constrain the formation epoch of the stars in early-type
galaxies from the corrected evolution of the mean M L ratio
First we assume that the scatter in the color-magnitude rela-
tion and the Fundamental Plane is entirely caused by age vari-
ations Using lnhLBi  11z in Eq 3 we nd that the mean
luminosity weighted formation time of the stars in early-type
galaxies hti  016t0 or hzi  3009
- 05 when expressed in red-
shift For m  03 and   07 lnhLBi  13z and we nd
hzi  2003
- 02 As a check on our procedure we also computed
the mean formation epoch directly from the Monte-Carlo sim-
ulation which gave the best t to the observations The age
derived from the simulation is identical to the age derived from
the corrected evolution of the M L ratio
If the scatter in the color-magnitude relation and the Funda-
mental Plane is not entirely caused by age variations the mean
age of the stars is higher Both the mean age and the scatter
have an approximately linear dependence on f Eq 2 and A9
Therefore for a given morphological transformation rate the
mean age of the stars is to good approximation a linear func-
tion of the scatter at z  0 From the Monte-Carlo simulations
with stop  05t0 we nd
hti t0  2  lnM LB
 10  U- B
for m  03 and   07 If the contribution of age varia-
tions to the scatter is negligible the correction for progenitor
bias is negligible as well and we nd hzi  65 for m  03
and   0 and hzi  26 for m  03 and   07 cf van
Dokkum et al 1998a Unfortunately it is observationally dif-
cult to disentangle the contributions of age and metallicity to
the observed scatter eg Trager et al 2000
5 SEPARATING ELLIPTICAL AND S0 GALAXIES
In the previous Sections we have treated early-type galaxies
as one class However Dressler et al 1997 separated the evo-
lution of elliptical and S0 galaxies and found that the ratio of
the fractions of S0 and elliptical galaxies evolves rapidly from
z  0 to z  055
Figure 5 shows the evolution of the number fractions of S0
galaxies and elliptical galaxies separately for the Dressler et al
1997 clusters solid symbols The dotted lines are linear ts
to the data As can be seen the S0 fraction increases by a factor
of  5 towards lower redshift whereas the elliptical fraction
drops by  30  from redshift z  055 to z  0 Dressler et al
1997 interpret the rapid evolution of the S0 fraction as evi-
dence for transformation of spiral galaxies to S0 galaxies since
van Dokkum  Franx
z  055 As pointed out by Fabricant et al 2000 the decrease
in the elliptical galaxy fraction over time requires substantial
accretion onto clusters since z  055
We model this evolution in the following way we assume
that the fraction of ellipticals is constant with time and that S0
galaxies are formed from the spiral galaxies that are present in
the clusters at z  055 We ignore the fact that infalling spiral
galaxies are also transformed into S0 galaxies The evolution
of the S0 galaxies is approximated reasonably well by a model
with a constant transformation rate Fig 5 The overpredic-
tion of the fraction of S0 galaxies at high redshift implies that
we underestimate the differences between the elliptical and S0
galaxies
tremely high redshift in this model whereas the S0 galaxies are
continuously transformed from star forming galaxies
This result is in conict with studies of luminous early-type
cluster galaxies at low and intermediate redshift which indi-
cate very little difference in luminosity weighted age between
luminous elliptical and S0 galaxies in the cores of rich clusters
eg Jrgensen Franx  Kjrgaard 1996 Ellis et al 1997
van Dokkum et al 1998a Jones Smail  Couch 2000 Kel-
son et al 2000 Other studies have reported S0 galaxies with
younger stellar populations but these tend to have low lumi-
nosities eg Caldwell et al 1993 van Dokkum et al 1998b
Kuntschner  Davies 1998
Fig 6 Predicted evolution of the mean M LB ratio for a model with
different evolutionary histories for elliptical galaxies and S0 galax-
ies It is assumed that all elliptical galaxies formed at extremely high
redshift whereas S0 galaxies are continuously transformed from star
forming galaxies This model predicts a difference of  lnM LB 
024 between luminous elliptical galaxies and S0 galaxies at all red-
shifts
Fig 5 Evolution of the number fraction of elliptical galaxies and
S0 galaxies separately from Dressler et al 1997 solid symbols
The S0 fraction decreases with redshift whereas the elliptical fraction
increases The dotted lines are linear ts to the data The solid lines
show the evolution in our hybrid model
In our rst models we assume that the star formation rate
for the spiral galaxies is constant in time  f  05 and that
star formation starts at tstart  0 for all galaxies Figure 6 shows
the evolution of the mean M L ratio in this model for elliptical
galaxies dotted line S0 galaxies dashed line and elliptical
and S0 galaxies combined solid line The model reproduces
the observed evolution of the M L ratio of the combined sam-
ple of elliptical galaxies and S0 galaxies However elliptical
galaxies in this model have systematically higher M L ratios
and redder colors than S0 galaxies at all redshifts The dif-
ference is  024 in ln M LB or  005 in U - B color This
difference corresponds to a difference of  20  in luminosity
weighted age eg Worthey et al 1994 This large difference
arises because all elliptical galaxies formed their stars at ex-
There are several ways in which this conict can be solved
First we can adapt the starformation histories The model as-
sumes that star formation in elliptical and S0 galaxies com-
menced at z   and that their star formation rate was approx-
imately constant from tstart to tstop If star formation in elliptical
galaxies commenced at a later time the systematic difference
between elliptical and S0 galaxies is reduced If tstart  02t0 for
elliptical galaxies ie star formation commenced at z  25
the systematic difference in M L ratio between elliptical and S0
galaxies at z  0 is very small However it increases to  03
in lnM LB at z  08 This corresponds to a systematic differ-
ence in U - B color of 006 which is inconsistent with the low
scatter in the CM relation of early type galaxies at z  083 van
Dokkum et al 2000
An alternative explanation for the small observed difference
between luminous elliptical and S0 galaxies is that most of their
stars were formed at very high redshift In our models this cor-
responds to low values of f the parameter describing the star
formation history The systematic difference in M L ratio scales
linearly with f and for values of f  02 the systematic age
difference between elliptical and S0 galaxies is  5  at all
redshifts This explanation can be tested with the help of direct
measurements of the star formation rates of the spiral galaxies
in intermediate redshift clusters
A third possibility is that the effects of metallicity cancel the
effects of age eg Worthey Trager  Faber 1996 Shioya 
Early-Type Galaxies in Clusters
Bekki 1998 Trager et al 2000 The spiral galaxies would be
enriched in metals compared to the elliptical galaxies of the
same luminosity and hence their colors would be redder and
their M L ratios higher than that of elliptical galaxies with the
same age This solution requires exact ne tuning between age
and metallicity to keep the scatter small It can be tested by di-
rect observations of absorption line strengths of elliptical and
S0 galaxies in nearby and distant clusters The rst studies
do not appear to indicate signicant differences between mas-
sive elliptical and S0 galaxies eg Kuntschner  Davies 1998
Jones et al 2000 Kelson et al 2001
Finally the separation of ellipticals and S0s is very difcult
and it is not clear whether a clear distinction can be made be-
tween elliptical galaxies and S0 galaxies with L luminosities
eg Jrgensen  Franx 1994 Rix  White 1990 The latter
study demonstrated that many elliptical galaxies contain signif-
icant disks and would be classied as S0 galaxies when seen
edge-on Jorgensen and Franx argued that the Coma elliptical
and S0 galaxies can be approximated well by a population of
galaxies which has a homogeneous distribution in the ratio of
bulge light to total light In this case no clearcut distinction
would exist between S0 galaxies and elliptical galaxies and the
evolutionary histories would not be so different between the
galaxies This might also explain the fact that the classica-
tions between different authors agree well when the total frac-
tion of elliptical and S0 galaxies is considered but not when
the classes are separated eg Andreon 1998 Fabricant et al
2000 Quantitative classications would be able to resolve this
issue especially if detailed attention is given to the classica-
tion uncertainties due to projection effects
6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have quantied the effects of morphological
evolution on the observed properties of early-type galaxies in
clusters at 0  z  1 A manifestation of morphological evo-
lution is the progenitor bias at high redshift the progenitors
of the youngest present-day early-type galaxies drop out of the
sample In general the observed evolution of the mean lumi-
nosity and color of early-type galaxies is slower than the true
evolution of all progenitors of early-type galaxies and the scat-
ter in luminosity and color is smaller If morphological evolu-
tion is strong the observed mean evolution is similar to that of
a single age stellar population formed at z   and the scatter
is approximately constant with redshift These results can be
derived analytically cf Appendix A
In traditional models it is difcult to explain the low number
fractions of early-type galaxies in distant clusters and the homo-
geneity and slow evolution of their stellar populations simulta-
neously We have shown that the observed constant scatter in
the CM relation and the FP and the slow evolution of the mean
M L ratio are natural consequences of morphological evolution
Observations of early-type galaxies in clusters at 0  z  1 are
well tted by our models and we can constrain the morphologi-
cal transformation rate and the star formation histories of galax-
ies prior to transformation from the ts The observed evolution
of the early-type galaxy fraction constrains the transformation
rate the evolution of the mean M L ratio constrains the time of
onset of star formation and the scatter in the color-magnitude
relation and the Fundamental Plane constrain the star forma-
tion histories of galaxies prior to transformation The best ts
are obtained if approximately 50  of present-day early-type
galaxies were transformed from other morphological types at
z  1 star formation commenced at early times z  25 and
star formation was approximately constant prior to transforma-
tion Such gradual star formation histories are consistent with
the low numbers of star burst galaxies seen in intermediate red-
shift clusters eg Abraham et al 1996 Balogh et al 1998
Ellingson et al 2000 although some star bursts could be con-
cealed by dust Poggianti et al 1999
The observed color and luminosity evolution of early-type
galaxies can be corrected for the effects of progenitor bias We
have shown that for a given morphological transformation rate
the progenitor bias is proportional to the scatter in M L ratio
or color The correction is maximal if the scatter in the CM
relation and the FP at z  0 is entirely due to age variations be-
tween galaxies This maximum correction to the evolution of
rest frame lnhM LBi is approximately - 02  z and the cor-
rection to the evolution of rest frame hU - Bi is approximately
- 004  z These corrections can easily be computed for other
rest frame bands using stellar population synthesis models As
an example the Worthey 1994 and Bruzual  Charlot 2000
models give U - V   17U - B for solar metallicity and
Salpeter 1955 IMF Therefore the correction to hU - V i is
 - 007  z The corrections are upper limits because varia-
tions in dust content and metallicity probably contribute to the
scatter On the other hand as pointed out by eg Trager et al
2000 variations in metallicity and age may conspire to pro-
duce a low scatter If this is conrmed the corrections may be
larger than the values given here
Because the mean luminosity and color evolution are under-
estimated the mean age of the stars in early-type galaxies that is
derived from them is overestimated in traditional models We
nd that the mean luminosity weighted formation redshift of
early-type galaxies can be as low as hzi  3009
- 05 for m  03
and   0 or hzi  2003
- 02 for m  03 and   07 if the
scatter in the CM relation and the FP is entirely caused by age
variations This result is important because previous studies
which ignored the effects of progenitor bias found much earlier
formation epochs of the stars in early-type galaxies eg El-
lis et al 1997 Stanford et al 1998 van Dokkum et al 1998a
The redshift range 2  3 is of interest because it is observation-
ally accessible In particular our results are consistent with the
idea that some Ly-break galaxies are the star forming building
blocks of present-day early-type galaxies in clusters Baugh et
al 1998
In our main analysis we treated the evolution of early-type
galaxies as one class but we also explored a model which sep-
arates the two classes In our model only the S0 galaxies evolve
morphologically from spiral galaxies as advocated by Dressler
et al 1997 The model predicts that colors and M L ratios of
luminous S0 galaxies in nearby clusters are systematically off-
set from those of elliptical galaxies in the sense that elliptical
galaxies are redder and have higher M L ratios This result is in
conict with studies of bright early-type galaxies in the cores
of rich clusters which generally nd very little difference be-
tween elliptical and S0 galaxies eg Bower et al 1992 Ellis
et al 1997 There are several ways to resolve this conict
star formation may have started later in the elliptical galaxies
or most of the star formation in elliptical and S0 galaxies must
have occurred at very early times long before morphological
transformation to early-type galaxy Alternatively there might
be a conspiracy between age and metallicity eg Trager et al
2000 such that S0 galaxies have systematically higher metal-
licities than elliptical galaxies of the same luminosity This
van Dokkum  Franx
can be tested by absorption line measurements current mea-
surements do not indicate such an effect for cluster galaxies
Finally the separation between elliptical and S0 galaxies may
not be very sharp Rix  White 1990 showed that many S0
galaxies will be classied as elliptical galaxies when not viewed
edge-on Jrgensen and Franx 1994 showed that the ellipti-
cal and S0 galaxies in Coma can be modeled by a population
of galaxies with a homogeneous distribution of bulge-to-total
light ratio Hence the galaxies which are classied as elliptical
galaxies may also have evolved since z  1
It is interesting to compare our results to predictions of
semi-analytical galaxy formation models in CDM cosmologies
White  Frenk 1991 Cole 1991 Because the morphologies
of galaxies change quite rapidly in these models eg Baugh
Cole  Frenk 1996 Kauffmann 1996 progenitor bias is an
important ingredient In particular the models provide reason-
able ts to the observed scatter in the CM relation Kauffmann
 Charlot 1998 Cole et al 2000 and the evolution of the
mean M L ratio of massive galaxies Diaferio et al 2000 even
though galaxies in these simulations have quite complex star
formation histories However in these complex models it is dif-
cult to isolate and study specic effects such as the progenitor
bias The main contribution of our work is that we use very sim-
ple models with only three free parameters We show that the
effects of progenitor bias can be constrained directly from the
observations and it is straightforward to reproduce our results
The main uncertainty in the present paper is the rate of mor-
phological evolution More high resolution large eld stud-
ies of distant clusters are needed to constrain the evolution of
the early-type galaxy fraction better Detailed simulations are
needed to determine the effects of infall on the observed prop-
erties and morphological mix of cluster galaxies eg Elling-
son et al 2000 Furthermore studies of the evolution of the
mass function of rich clusters to z  1 are necessary to determine
whether high redshift clusters are representative progenitors of
present-day rich clusters As pointed out by eg Kauffmann
1995 signicant evolution in the mass function of rich clus-
ters may result in a progenitor bias at the cluster level
