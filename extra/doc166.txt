In a previous paper Hartwick 2015 H15 a model to describe the chemical evolution of
local dwarf galaxies was presented Accreting gas undergoes multiple starbursts resulting in
metallicity distributions which resemble those in both dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal
galaxies The model also predicts a stellar mass-metallicity hereafter MZ relation The
purpose of this note is to consider some implications of this MZ relation by comparing with
the observations of star-forming galaxies
As discussed in H15 the logarithmic slope of the MZ relation depends on the assumed
form of the metallicity kernel Two kernels were considered Here we use the Gaussian kernel
which was introduced in the appendix to H15 It is the most physically motivated and the
predicted slope is in better agreement with the more extensive observations discussed here
and with the results of Andrews  Martini 2013 Furthermore in order to maintain the
constraint on the relation which holds between the mean metallicity and the variance of the
metallicity distributions established by Leaman 2012 the mean in the Gaussian kernel is
assumed to be zero The convolution integrals then become
In  CrsZ p
zn1ez22bdz
where the dispersion b is expressed in terms of the eective yield pef f ie 2b  p2
ef f and
Log pef f is the metallicity at the peak of the metallicity distribution The true nuclear yield
is given by p and is assumed to be constant Crs is a constant for a given redshift or epoch
and is equal to MnzI2zp where log z  log zpef f   12  log OH Mn is
the stellar mass at z for a particular redshift and is determined from the observations The
values of log MnM used here in order of increasing redshift are 835 920 and 106
The data that we will be discussing refers to the mean gas phase metallicity zMg which
following the procedure in H15 is given as
zMg  I2  I3pI1  I2p
while the stellar mass is given by
Ms  I2p
 2 
It is the relation between log zMg and log Ms which is now compared to the observations
This relation is shown in Fig 1 for dierent values of the constant Crs Quenching of the
starbursting phase at the metal rich end occurs because stars and the gas cannot be more
metal rich than the true nuclear yield which in this case is assumed to be log pH 
log OH  075 Given the nature of our model it is appropriate to compare the results
to the observations of star-forming galaxies
Zahid et al 2014 have shown from the observations of star-forming galaxies that at
a given cosmic epoch the logarithmic slope of the MZ relation approaches  05 as the
metallicity decreases The logarithmic slope of our model equals 05 at lower metallicities
The two red arcs in Fig 1 show the ts of their model to their observations of star-forming
galaxies at redshifts of 008 and 155 left to right The constant Crs has been adjusted to
smoothly extend these relations to lower metallicities with the H15 model The combined
eect of the epoch dependence of Crs and the quenching of our model at the metal rich end
implies that downsizing Cowie et al 1996 must occur Note that reasonable ts to the
metallicity distributions in H15 were made assuming that Crs is a constant This suggests
that the time scale for the main star forming phase is short compared to the cosmic time
The downsizing factor Crs is the same for galaxies of all metallicities at a given epoch
This constraint may provide clues to the mechanism which drives the accretion eg gas rich
mergers or colliding gas streams
Also shown in Fig 1 as blue points are the observations of Onodera et al 2016 of star-
forming galaxies at redshift  33 The line through the data is the model with the constant
Crs shifted by logMM  14 from the line at redshift 155 The green points in Fig
1 are the observations of Lee et al 2006 for a sample of dwarf irregular galaxies within 5
Mpc Here they are considered post-star-forming galaxies in the same sense as the dwarf
irregular galaxies discussed in H15 Stellar ages are required in order to determine whether
such observations belong on this plot The prediction is that their major star-forming phase
occured between redshifts 008 and 155 corresponding to look back times between 15 and
96 Gyr Similarly the most massive galaxies  1012M are predicted to have undergone
their main star-forming phase at redshift  33 corresponding to a look back time of  12
In summary with the addition of one parameter Crs the H15 model can account for
the observations of the star-forming galaxies if the observations of the galaxies are identied
with the star bursting behaviour of the model This consistency with the model holds only
if galaxy downsizing is assumed to occur
