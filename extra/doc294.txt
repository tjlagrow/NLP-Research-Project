Abstract
We study the evolution of the size - stellar mass relation for a large spectroscopic sample of galaxies
in the GOODs North eld up to z  35 The sizes of the galaxies are measured from Ks-band
images corresponding to rest-frame opticalNIR from the Subaru 8m telescope We reproduce earlier
results based on photometric redshifts that the sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolve with redshift
Specically we compare sizes of UV-bright galaxies at a range of redshifts Lyman break galaxies
LBGs selected through the U-drop technique z  25  35 BMBX galaxies at z  15  25 and
GALEX LBGs at low redshift z  06  15 The median sizes of these UV-bright galaxies evolve as
1  z111013 between z  05  35 The UV-bright galaxies are signicantly larger than quiescent
galaxies at the same mass and redshift by 045  009 dex We also verify the correlation between color
and stellar mass density of galaxies to high redshifts The sizes of sub-mm galaxies in the same eld
are measured and compared with BMBX galaxies We nd that median half-light radii of SMGs is
290  045 kpc and there is little dierence in their size distribution to the UV-bright star forming
galaxies

1 INTRODUCTION
Recent studies provide evidence that sizes of galaxies
at high redshifts were smaller in comparison with galax-
ies of similar mass in the local universe eg Daddi et al
2005 Trujillo et al 2006ab Zirm et al 2007 Toft et al
2007 van Dokkum et al 2008a Franx et al 2008
Williams et al 2010 Toft et al 2009 Damjanov et al
2009 Cimatti et al 2008 Longhetti et al 2007 These
studies pose several questions about the evolution of
properties of galaxies and the build up of galaxy stel-
lar mass with time Several physical processes are pro-
posed to explain the growth of galaxies with time such as
galaxy major or minor mergers eg Khochfar  Silk
2006 2009 Bell et al 2006 Naab et al 2009 gas accre-
tion in outer regions and star formation eg Dekel et al
2009 Elmegreen et al 2008 However each of these
mechanisms will aect dierently the growth of mass
and size of galaxies For example major dry mergers
could produce descendants with larger than observed
stellar masses for early-type galaxies Therefore some
authors eg van Dokkum et al 2010 Bezanson et al
2009 Naab et al 2009 Hopkins et al 2009 suggest mi-
nor mergers and envelope growth by satellite accretion
to be a more likely mechanism for building up quiescent
galaxies In general plausible models have to reproduce
galaxy sizes and stellar mass densities seen today and
bring the high redshift galaxies to the local stellar mass-
size relation Therefore exploring the observed evolution
of galaxy sizes is essential to constrain these galaxy for-
mation and evolution models
However most of the size studies at high redshift were

based on photometric redshifts Although techniques
to construct galaxy spectral energy distributions SEDs
from multiwavelength observations and photometric red-
shift measurements are improved over the past few years
photometric redshifts still have worse uncertainties for
star forming galaxies due to the lack of a strong 4000A
break The large uncertainties and possible systematic
biases due to the reliance on photometric redshifts can
seriously aect the masses and star-formation rate mea-
surements and thus the nal results Spectroscopic ob-
servations of high-redshift galaxies and making complete
magnitude limited samples require large amounts of ob-
serving time Nevertheless the advent of 8-10m class
telescopes with multi object spectroscopy has brought
about much larger high-z spectroscopic samples than
were previously available
Spectroscopic redshifts are relatively easier to obtain
for star forming galaxies compare to quiescent galax-
ies due to emission lines Previous results on the size
evolution of this population with photometric redshifts
are interesting since some of the usual mechanisms as-
sumed for size growth eg gas-poor dry mergers do
not apply to gas-rich starburst galaxies since substan-
tial amounts of gas is required for these galaxies to un-
dergo signicant star formation Therefore studies of
the structure of star forming galaxies with secure red-
shifts can provide strong constraints on size evolution
models
The actively star forming galaxies at high redshift con-
sists of two main populations relatively unobscured UV-
bright galaxies and dusty red starbursts the most ex-
treme of which are detected as sub-millimetre galaxies
SMGs The UV-bright galaxies are selected to have
strong rest-frame UV In the past few years many sim-
ple photometric techniques eg U -dropout were de-
signed to select these galaxies at dierent redshift ranges
eg Steidel et al 2003 Adelberger et al 2004
Mosleh et al
The SMGs are among the most massive luminous
and vigorously star forming galaxies at high redshift
that are heavily obscured by dust eg Hughes et al
1998 Smail et al 2002 Chapman et al 2003 2005 The
physical process driving these highly luminous galaxies
star-formation AGN or combination of these two is still
uncertain The evolution of SMGs and their relation to
the local galaxies are also not yet understood
for in-
stance whether or not SMGs are the progenitors of local
elliptical galaxies eg Blain et al 2004 Swinbank et al
2006 Tacconi et al 2008 Their position on the size-
mass plane may therefore provide clues about their rela-
tion to other galaxy populations
To verify previous results based on photometric
redshifts here we study the mass and size evolution of
a large sample of UV-bright and submillimetre galaxies
in GOODS-North with secure spectroscopic redshifts
The structure of this paper is as follows In section 2
we review the data In section 3  4 we describe size
and mass determinations of galaxies Our sub-samples
selection are described in section 5 Finally in section 6
we present our results and investigate the size evolution
and stellar mass-size relation for our samples We
summarize and discuss our results in section 7 The
cosmological parameters adopted throughout this pa-
per are m  03   07 and H0  70 km s1 M pc1
2 DESCRIPTION OF DATA
The sample of galaxies used here is based on the
most complete spectroscopic catalog of galaxies in
the GOODS Great Observatories Origin Deep Sur-
vey Giavalisco et al 2004 North eld by Barger et al
2008 This catalog gives a compilation of all spec-
troscopic observations carried out in this eld eg
Cowie et al 2004 Reddy et al 2006 Wirth et al 2004
Cohen 2001 Cohen et al 2000 where each galaxy
sample was selected in a dierent way
In addition
Barger et al 2008 performed spectroscopic observa-
tions for certain subsamples The catalog includes 2907
sources including stars and is restricted to sources with
KsAB  245 or F 850LPAB  26 There are 2362
sources with z  16 and 327 sources between z  16
and 35 Most redshifts for galaxies with z  16 come
from Reddy et al 2006
This catalog Barger et al 2008 comprises optical
photometric data in the F435W F606W F775W and
F850LP passbands taken from HST Advanced Cam-
era for Surveys ACS Giavalisco et al 2004 and the
U-band magnitude is taken from Capak et al 2004
The near-infrared Ks-band magnitude measured from
WIRCam images from CFHT Details of near-IR obser-
vations data reduction and generating catalog are de-
scribed more in Barger et al 2008 X-ray soft 05 
2KeV   hard 2  8KeV  luminosities are also pro-
vided for many sources in the catalog In Barger et al
2008 sources with X-ray luminosities above 1042 ergs
s1 in either soft or hard band dened as AGNs For a
fraction of sources  36 near-ultraviolet NUV and
far-ultraviolet FUV magnitudes from the UV imaging
survey performed by GALEX mission were also provided
Note that sources indicated as stars in the catalog are ex-
cluded from our analysis
3 SIZES
31 Size measurements
Size determination in the observed near-infrared rest-
frame optical at high z is more robust in tracing the
distribution of stellar mass than the observed opti-
cal rest-frame UV at high z since the sizes at rest-
frame UV can be strongly aected by dust and star-
formation Therefore we use Ks-band images from
Subaru MOIRCS Deep Survey MODS in the GOODS
North eld Kajisawa et al 2006 Ouchi et al 2007
The imaging observations are performed for J and Ks
bands over  112 arcmin2 area of the GOODS-N eld
with a pixel scale of 012 arcsec We used the images re-
duced by Bouwens et al 2008 The resulting FWHM
of the Ks images is  05 The deepest data cover  28
arcmin2 reaching a 5  of 254 AB mag in Ks band while
the other regions are  13 mag shallower More de-
tails of the images and data reduction can be found in
Bouwens et al 2008
Sizes of galaxies were estimated by using the GAL-
FIT code Peng et al 2002 in a similar procedure used
by Trujillo et al 2007 and Williams et al 2010 For
each galaxy a square postage stamp of 120 pixels 144
around each galaxy was made and we use a mask to ex-
clude neighbouring galaxies from the t A range of
Sersic 1968 prole models convolved with the point-
spread function PSF of the image are tted to the Ks
images of galaxies The convolved models for each object
were compared with the galaxy surface brightness dis-
tribution and the best t model determined using min-
imized 2 of the t The PSF used by GALFIT was
taken from the median of the unsaturated stars over the
entire MOIRCS Ks images We perform a test to check
the PSF of the image by measuring sizes of a number of
stars in the eld listed in the Barger et al 2008 catalog
The derived sizes of all the stars are found to be  002
pixel eectively zero Therefore the PSF is a good ap-
proximation of a point source We note that within our
Ks band images there is a shallower region with seeing
of 068 We followed a similar procedure with an ap-
propriate PSF which is made from the median of stars
in this region to measure sizes of galaxies in this region
separately We also veried that the derived sizes of the
shallower region are reliable by its appropriate PSF
We determine the circularized eective radius re 
aep1   from the half-light radius along the semima-
jor axis ae and ellipticity  as output by GALFIT This
removes the eects of ellipticity We allowed the Sersic
index n which measures the shape of the surface bright-
ness prole of galaxy to vary between 05 and 5 and
the eective radius between 001 and 60 pixels 00012
and 72 Initial guesses for the eective radius re el-
lipticity and position angle were taken from the SExtrac-
tor catalog and magnitude was taken from the original
Barger et al 2008 catalog and we set the Sersic index
to 2 initially
Our results show that the median Sersic index mea-
sured for all galaxies is 20 where 50 of measurements
lies between 40 and 10 For galaxies with stellar masses
between 1010-1011M the median Sersic index is 24
where 50 lies between 46 and 12
Due to possibility of color gradients it is best to use the
same rest-frame band for measuring sizes of galaxies at

on our simulations Right panel  The same comparison but for the relative dierence between output and input Sersic index The error
bars illustrate the 68 scatter The random uncertainties of recovered sizes and Sersic index increase with magnitude
all redshifts However only deep K imaging is available
so there is a possibility of systematic eects with redshift
Franx et al 2008 show that such systematic eects are
small and will not signicantly aect the results As
an approximation we corrected sizes to the rest-frame g
band using star forming galaxies from studies of CDF-
South Franx et al 2008 We derive the best linear t
to the median of the ratio of sizes in K band and rest-
frame g band as a function of redshift and apply this
t rekbandregband  015z  064 to galaxies with
z  2 in our sample
32 Simulations
To gauge the accuracy of the measured sizes and re-
liability of our results we perform a realistic simula-
tion About 8500 Sersic proles were generated with
uniformly-distributed random parameters in the ranges
of 19  KAB  25 01  re  2 05  n  5 and
0    08 The mock galaxies were then convolved with
the PSF of the image Finally we added these galaxies
to 144 blank-sky postage stamps randomly taken from
our Ks band image The structural parameters of the
model galaxies were then measured in a manner identi-
cal to that used for the actual images
The results of these simulations are shown in Figure 1
and 2 Left panel of Figure 1 shows that the scatter in
the recovered sizes increase with magnitude The ran-
dom uncertainties increase signicantly after KAB  23
However the systematic errors are very small  5
even at the faintest magnitudes Moreover the simu-
lation shows that the systematic errors on recovery of
Sersic index are also very small and random uncertain-
ties increase above K 23 right panel of Figure 1 From
this result we limit the sample studied in this paper to
galaxies with K  23 mag We note that this limit is
for the deeper region in our K band images Running
a separate simulation for the shallower region we nd
that the derived sizes of galaxies with K  227 mag are
reliable Hence we restricted the sample in this region
to this slightly brighter magnitude limit
We have also explored how the recovery of size depends
on the size itself As shown in Figure 2 the uncertainties
in retrieving sizes depend on both magnitude and size
Systematic osets at all magnitudes appear to be neg-
ligible except for re  18 arcsec which corresponds to
144 kpc at z  1 at the faintest magnitudes however
galaxies this large and faint have not been seen at any
redshift
The random uncertainties increase with size in all mag-
nitude bins For objects with KAB  20 mag top panel
the random uncertainties in size recovery are  5
However for galaxies with 21  KAB  22 the increas-
ing of random uncertainties with sizes is signicant The
increase in random uncertainties at larger sizes could be
due to decreasing of surface brightness However since
we are mainly concerned about the overall sample prop-
erties the lack of systematic errors is more important
4 STELLAR MASS ESTIMATES
The stellar masses of galaxies were measured with the
Fitting and Assessment of Synthetic TemplatesFAST
code Kriek et al 2009b All uxes from Barger et al
2008 including four optical bands from ACS the Ks
infrared and U band were used to nd the best-t galaxy
template SED to the broadband photometry using a
2 minimization procedure Bruzual  Charlot 2003
stellar population evolution models with exponentially
declining star formation histories with  ranging from
10710 yr were used to t the SEDs We use the
Salpeter 1955 initial mass function IMF and solar
metallicity and the extinction AV was allowed to vary
between 0 and 3 Redshift of galaxies were xed to
their spectroscopic redshift provided by Barger et al
2008 catalog Masses were then shifted by 02 dex
for consistency with the z  0 SDSS masses which were
calculated using a Kroupa 2001 IMF

aSamples of star-forming galaxies studied in this paper
lection criteria are based on the observed UnGR colors
of galaxies Reddy et al 2006 provided spectroscopic
observations for candidates brighter than RAB  255
photometrically selected from Steidel et al 2003 2004
For this paper 41 BMBX galaxies to KAB  23 are
selected from their sample with spectroscopic redshift
z  14
Galaxies analogous to the LBGs at 06  z 
14 hereafter GALEXLBGs are selected with the
GALEXHST F U V  N U V AB versus
N U V 
F 435W AB color-color diagram Following the selec-
tion criteria used in Barger et al 2008 and requiring
z  06 we include 105 GALEXLBGs with KAB  23
In addition to the UV-bright galaxies in GOODS-N
eld we also study sizes of the Sub-millimetre galax-
ies SMGs as a population of star forming galaxies at
high redshifts The subsample of SMGs for our stud-
ies is drawn from Chapman et al 2005 and Pope et al
2006 The catalog of SMGs provided by Pope et al
2006 contains 35 candidates from GOODS-N eld with
21 secure optical counterparts Of these only 8 galaxies
in our observed images have spectroscopic redshifts We
further include 6 SMGs from the Chapman et al 2005
HDF-North study Therefore our nal SMG sample
studied here contains 14 sources spanning 05  z  3
Besides these two populations star forming galaxies
at z  14 can also be identied using BzK technique
Daddi et al 2004 This technique is designed to cull
galaxies from K-selected samples Star forming BzK
galaxies sBzK  tend to be more massive and have higher
reddening than UV-selected galaxies With this method
70 sBzK galaxies at z  14 and KAB  23 are selected
using the criteria z  K  B  z  02 We further
use this sample to compare properties of star forming
galaxy populations at high redshifts The sBzK selec-
tion criteria can identies  90 of our BMBX galax-
ies The large overlap is not surprising since both our
UV-selected and sBzK samples consist of mostly mas-
sive galaxies due to the K magnitude limit Table 1

6 RESULTS
61 Size Evolution
In Figure 3 we show the size distributions for UV-
bright galaxies between 10  logMM  11 The
blue histogram shows the measured half-light radii of
GALEXLBGs at z  1 while the distribution of sizes
measured for BMBX galaxies z  2 are shown as a
green histogram It can be seen from this plot that UV-
bright galaxies at z  2 are smaller compared to similar
galaxies at z  1 Specically the median half light
radii of BMBX galaxies in this mass range is 268  019
kpc signicantly smaller than the median eective radii

sizes of galaxies in our simulations as a function of size for mock
galaxies for galaxies with KAB  20 mag top panel 20  KAB 
21 middle panel and 21  KAB  22 lower panel The rela-
tive errors between the input and measured sizes of galaxies as a
function of sizes depends on the magnitude
The ability to identify and study distant galaxies has
improved dramatically during the last two decades Var-
ious selection criteria have been designed to select high
redshift galaxies through their observed colors In this
paper we use such criteria to select samples of UV-bright
galaxies in redshift ranges of 06  z  14 14  z  25
and 27  z  35
Our sample of Lyman break galaxies 27  z  35 is
taken from Reddy et al 2006 Their LBGs candidates
were originally preselected by the C D and MD
criteria which use regions of Un  G versus G  R
color space Steidel et al 2003 Limiting our sample to
KAB  23 we were only able to include 5 LBGs in our
analysis
At z  2 BMBX galaxies also are
from Reddy et al
The BMBX criteria
Adelberger et al 2004 Steidel et al 2004 were de-
signed to nd actively star forming galaxies at redshifts
14  z  25 with similar SEDs to the LBGs The se-

Evolution of the mass-size relation to z  35 in the GOODS North eld
they are discussed further in section 64 Galaxies which
have X-ray luminosities  1042 ergs s1 ie potential
AGN hosts are marked with open circles These galaxies
have sizes similar to the others Since AGN is point
like one would expect galaxies with AGN emission to
have smaller half-light radii Their normal rest frame
optical sizes are thus perhaps not strongly inuenced
Nonetheless due to possible eects on the size and mass
estimates X-ray detected galaxies should be considered
low-condence points
62 Stellar Mass-Size Relation
We now investigate how mass-size distribution of the
UV-bright galaxies compares to other galaxy popula-
tions We further check if the relation between stellar
mass and size of these galaxies exists to high redshift
The stellar mass-size distributions of our samples are
shown in Figure 5 We have divided our sample into three
redshift bins 05  z  15 15  z  25 25  z  35
UV-bright galaxies are color coded the same as Figure 4
Solid and dotted lines in each panel show the mass-size
relation from Shen et al 2003 for star forming galaxies
and early-type galaxies at z  0 respectively The gray
symbols are the K -selected sample of galaxies in CDF-
South with stellar masses  1098M Franx et al 2008
Comparing our results with the galaxies from CDF-S al-
lows us to see where our galaxies lie relative to a purely
mass-selected sample Brown solid lines in the middle
of each panel show the median eective radii in narrow
mass bins for all galaxies in CDF-S As can be seen at
z  1 and z  2 UV-bright galaxies have larger eective
radii compared to all galaxies at a given stellar mass
For galaxies between 1010-1011M the median sizes dif-
fer by a factor of 189  023 and 112  009 at z  1
and 2 respectively As the spectroscopic sample contains
only 4 UV-bright galaxies in this mass range at z  3
the dierence with CDF-S is not well constrained at this
redshift 127  036
We further investigate how the size mass distribution
of GOODS-N UV-bright galaxies compares to that of
UV-bright galaxies in CDF-S This would help to verify
if the previously reported size-mass relation for a large
photometric sample Franx et al 2008 is consistent with
our spectroscopic sample We dene analogues of the
z  1 2 and 3 LBGs in CDF-S by their optical colors
and magnitudes Specically we selected the analogues
of the z  1 GALEXLBGs by requiring B  V   06
and R  238 This selection is based on the locus of
the GOODS-N GALEXLBGs in this color-magnitude
plane The analogues of BMBX galaxies in CDF-S are
similarly selected with R  251 and B  V   08 and
zphot  15  25 We note that the R band magnitude in
both surveys is estimated by the average values of V and
I band magnitudes We veried that the spectroscopic
samples are eectively selected by these criteria In order
to identify analogues UV-bright objects in CDF-S at z 
25  35 we nd the location of LBGs in GOODS-N
on the color-color B  V  versus V  I diagram and
apply the following criteria to the CDF-S galaxies 1
05  B  V   12 for V  I  035 2 B  V  
3  V  I  05 and B  V   12 for 035  V  I 
05 We note that these selection criteria do not impose a
U-drop out criteria but do select galaxies with similar
brightness and UV slope as the usual LBG methods
Fig 3 Size distribution of UV-bright galaxies with stellar
mass 10  logMM  11 at z  1 blue histogram and
z  2 green histogram The half light radii of UV-bright galax-
ies GALEXLBGs at z  1 are larger than BMBX galaxies at
z  2
of GALEXLBGs 442  052 kpc This means that
sizes of UV-bright galaxies evolve by a median factor of
060  008 between z  2 to z  1 It is harder to mea-
sure the evolution for z  3 to z  2 as we have 4 LBGs
within mass range of 10  logMM  11 at z  3
in our sample The median half-light radius of these 4
massive galaxies is 222  061 kpc 082  023 smaller
than z  2 BMBX galaxies We perform a power-law

The size-redshift relation for star-forming galaxies with
spectroscopic redshifts in the GOODS North eld is
shown in Figure 4 Galaxies are split into the four dier-
ent stellar mass bins shown in the gure In each panel
the gray small symbols are normal star forming galax-
ies with spectroscopic redshifts selected to have specic
star-formation rates log sSF R  10 Color symbols
represent our samples of UV-bright galaxies and sub-
millimetre galaxies SMGs LBGs 27  z  35
are shown as dark-green triangles and BMBX galax-
ies 14  z  27 are plotted as green squares
GALEXLBGs at relatively lower redshifts 06  z 
14 are plotted in dierent panels as blue stars The
black symbols at z  0 are star forming galaxies from
Guo et al 2009 from SDSS
As Figure 4 shows sizes of UV-bright galaxies at a
xed stellar mass increase towards lower redshifts There
is also a trend that the size evolution maybe stronger
for the most massive galaxies For example UV-bright
galaxies with stellar masses 9  logMM  10
evolve by a median factor of approximately 115  025
from z  2 to z  08 However galaxies with masses
10  logMM  105 grow by a median factor
of approximately 182  025 At higher stellar mass
bin 105  logMM  11 this evolution is even
stronger a factor of 205  126 over the same redshift
range However selection eects may inuence this trend
especially in the low-mass bin and more complete sam-
ples are needed
SMGs are also shown as pink diamonds in Figure 4

Fig 4 Evolution of sizes of galaxies as a function of redshift Each panel shows the size evolution for a narrow stellar mass bin The
gray symbols are star forming galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in GOODS-N eld Blue stars are GALEXLBGs z  1 while the
green squares and green triangles represent BMBX galaxies z  2 and LBGs z  3respectively Submm galaxies are also shown as
pink diamonds Galaxies with X-ray luminosities more than 1042 ergs s1 are marked by open circles Black symbols at z  0 are SDSS
star forming galaxies from Guo et al 2009 As this plot illustrates the half light radii of UV-bright galaxies evolve with redshift and this
evolution is faster for high mass galaxies
The comparison of size-mass distributions for UV-
bright galaxies from both elds is shown in Figure 6 In
each panel the color symbols are the median log eective
radii of UV-bright galaxies in narrow mass bins with the
blue and green symbols representing UV-bright galaxies
in GOODS-N and the brown symbols are the ones in
CDF-S Error bars show the one  dispersion UV-bright
samples from both elds follow consistent size-mass re-
lation further conrming that UV-bright galaxies are
on average larger than overall galaxies at a xed stellar
mass We note that at high redshift z  25  35 the
comparison is weak because of the limited number LBGs
in GOODS-N
The UV-bright galaxies show a weak stellar mass size
relation at z  1 and z  2 in Figure 5 To quan-
tify this relation we tted a power law function of the
form re  M  to the individual UV-bright galaxies in
each redshift bin The tting results are plotted as color
dashed-dotted lines in Figure 6 At z  1 the size of
GALEXLBGs in GOODS-N scales with stellar mass
as re  M 019005 and the BMBX galaxies at z  2
have re  M 030006 The uncertainties were estimated

ing populations at high redshift have the same size-mass

Mosleh et al
BMBX galaxies in GOODS-N shown by green squares
and their analogues in CDF-S as brown circles As can
be seen in this Figure the blue star forming galaxies have
lower surface density than red galaxies at both z  1 and
z  2 though the correlation between color and surface
density is more tight at z  1 than z  2 In general
using sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts con-
rms that the color of galaxies are tightly correlates with
surface density and this relation holds out to high red-
shifts
64 Sizes of Submm Galaxies
Since GOODS-N includes 14 SMGs with redshifts we
compare their mass and sizes to the UV-selected galaxies
at z  2 As Figure 4 illustrates the optical rest-frame
sizes of the SMGs pink diamonds and UV-selected
galaxies of similar mass are comparable The median half
light radii of all SMGs is 290  045 kpc which is in good
agreement with the median optical rest-frame sizes of the
BMBX galaxies over the whole mass range 268  025
kpc The median eective radii of SMGs with stellar
masses of 1010  1011 is 265  056 which is similar to
the BMBX of at the same mass range 268 019 The
errors are computed using bootstrap resampling
We further compare the size distributions of sub-mm
galaxies and BMBX galaxies in Figure 9
top panel the histograms show the size distribution of
BMBX galaxies and SMGs In the bottom panel the
normalized cumulative distribution functions are shown
for both samples As this plot shows the size distribu-
tions of SMGs are comparable with z  2 UV-bright
galaxies and the SMGs follow the same size distribu-
tion as BMBX galaxies in the optical rest-frame with
SMGs being slightly larger According to a KS test
the probability that two distributions being the same is
72 percent suggesting no signicant dierence between
the rest-frame optical sizes of the SMGs and UV-bright
galaxies
7 DISCUSSION
71 The growth of star-forming galaxies
We study the size evolution of galaxies with spectro-
scopic redshifts between z  05  35 Our results are
summarized in Figure 10 As this plot illustrates at
each epoch the median sizes of UV-bright galaxies color
squares with stellar masses 10  logMM  11 are
larger by a median factor of 045  009 than quiescent
galaxies in a similar mass range selected from CDF-S red
circles The red triangle is the median sizes of quiescent
galaxies studied in van Dokkum et al 2008b VD08
hearafter with a median stellar mass of 17  1011M
and median redshift of 23 Table 3 lists the median half
light radii for UV-bright and quiescent galaxies seen in
Figure 10 The growth of UV-bright galaxies with time is
also illustrated in this gure The dashed line shows that
UV-bright galaxies scaled up their sizes towards lower
redshifts as 1  z111013
Previous studies Franx et al 2008 Kaumann et al
2003 reported that there is a correlation between color
and stellar mass surface density of galaxies at both low
and high redshifts However the results based on photo-
metric redshifts can be uncertain especially for star form-
ing galaxies By means of our large sample of galaxies
Fig 7 Stellar mass size relation for star forming sBzK galaxies
gray circles The BMBX galaxies and SMGs are marked with
green and pink circles respectively The red squares are the median
for the mass-size relation of sBzK sample with one  dispersion
The green dashed-dotted line is the best t to the BMBX galax-
ies The sBzK galaxies have a similar size-mass relation to the
BMBX galaxies The solid line shows the mass-size relation for
star-forming galaxies at z  0 from Shen et al 2003
for BMBX galaxies The average oset of median half
light radii of sBzK galaxies to the BMBX mass-size re-
lation is 0037 dex The eective radii of sBzK galaxies
scale with stellar mass as re  M 031009 close to the
size-mass relation for UV-bright galaxies This similarity
could be due to the signicant overlap between the UV-
selected galaxies and sBzK galaxies eg Reddy et al
2005 We note that stellar masses can have signicant
uncertainties depending on the methods used to calculate
them We verify that by using the stellar mass estimates
from Reddy et al 2006 for UV-bright galaxies the size-
mass distribution of these galaxies covers the same region
in the size-mass plane see eg middle panel of Figure
5 Hence this shows that our results are robust against
using dierent estimates of stellar masses
63 Color - Surface Density
One of the surprising results of Franx et al 2008 was
the tight correlation between stellar mass surface density
Mr2
e and color of galaxies to z  3 They showed
that bluer galaxies have lower surface densities than red
quiescent ones They indicated that the color of galax-
ies correlates more fundamentally with the stellar mass
surface density than the mass
We show the tight relation between color and stellar
mass surface density for both star-forming and quiescent
galaxies with M  1010  1011 in Figure 8 In the left
panel the observed color V606 z850 is plotted versus the
stellar mass surface density for galaxies at redshift  1
The black and gray symbols are galaxies from GOODS-N
and CDF-S elds respectively The blue stars and brown
circles indicate the GALEX LBGs and their analogues
from CDFS respectively
In the right panel the rela-
tion between observed z850  K and surface density
for galaxies at higher redshift  2 is illustrated  with

aNotes The median sizes of samples are for galaxies with stellar
masses between 1010  1011M except for the quiescentVD08
van Dokkum et al 2008b and SMG galaxies The CDFS sample
is all galaxies at the same stellar mass range in CDF-S eld
Fig 9 Top panel Histograms show the distribution of sizes
of Submm galaxies solid line and BMBX galaxies dotted lines
The gray region indicates apparent eective radii below 01 1
kpc at z  2 which size measurements have large uncertainties
Lower panel Cumulative distribution function for SMGs pink
dimonds and BMBX galaxies green squares As the plot shows
the distributions of half-light radii of these two populations are
comparable with SMGs being slightly larger
with secure redshifts we have conrmed that the tight
correlation between color and stellar mass surface den-
sity of galaxies that holds out to high redshifts as the
stellar mass densities of blue star forming galaxies are
smaller than those of red quiescent ones This veries
that the galaxies with higher specic star formation rate
are larger than the ones with lower specic star formation
We have also explored the stellar mass-size distribution
for galaxies in our sample We have conrmed that there
is a relation between stellar mass and size for UV-bright
galaxies at 05  z  35 The relations are consistent
for both spectroscopic and photometric redshift samples
Our results verify that there is no signicant evolution
of the slope of the size-mass relation to redshift  35
The evolution of the relation from z  1 to z  0 is
not well established as it is not straight forward to se-
lect Lyman Break galaxies at z  0 Some authors nd
evolution eg Franx et al 2008 Williams et al 2010
in the stellar mass-size relation however Barden et al
2005 have reported that the stellar mass-size relation
Mosleh et al
z  05  2
The similarity between sizes of UV-bright galaxies and
star forming BzK galaxies is also shown in our study
The two populations are also compared by Overzier et al
2010 They showed that rest-frame optical sizes of
sBzK galaxies are somewhat larger than UV-selected
galaxies Since BzK galaxies are K-selected and thus
tend to represent massive galaxies it is not surprising
that they appear larger Hence the sizes must be cor-
rected for diering stellar masses for an accurate com-
parison to be made
Our results also show that the SMGs have a median
half light radii of 290  045 kpc comparable to the rest-
frame optical sizes of the BMBX galaxies The result
is in agreement with a recent study by Swinbank et al
2010 where they use deep HST I and H -band imag-
ing and show that the rest-frame optical sizes of the
SMGs and UV-bright galaxies in GOODS-N are compa-
rable The typical half-light radii of the SMGs in the H -
band rest-frame optical measured by Swinbank et al
2010 is 28  04 which is consistent with our mea-
surements Almaini et al 2005 also compared sizes of
submm galaxies with Lyman-break galaxies at rest-frame
optical and found no clear dierence between sizes of the
SMGs and LBGs
It is worth noting that SMGs have
larger median stellar masses compared to BMBX galax-
ies also mentioned in Swinbank et al 2010 This sug-
gests higher stellar mass densities for SMGs compared to
UV bright galaxies However the similarity in sizes be-
tween these two galaxy populations at high z does not
by itself allow conclusive connections to be drawn be-
tween the two populations The SMGs that are faint or
lacking emission lines could be missing from our spectro-
scopic sample and they may have dramatically dierent
mass or size properties Therefore selection eect could
bias these results Spectroscopic observation in near-
IR might help to solve this problem eg Kriek et al
2009a nd a median size of 28 kpc for a small sam-
ple of near-IR spectroscopically conrmed star forming
galaxies at z  23
Indeed our measured size evolu-
tion is consistent with their spectroscopic sample how-
ever near-IR spectroscopy over a large redshift range is
needed to denitively quantify the size evolution
73 caveats
With this large spectroscopic sample of high redshift
galaxies we have removed an important source of
uncertainty in the stellar mass size relation and veried
the results from larger samples based on photometric
redshifts However the spectroscopic catalog we used
in this study consists of many dierent spectroscopic
surveys which made it inhomogeneous Galaxies in
this catalog are mostly relatively unobscured star
forming galaxies with emission lines comparing these
to quiescent galaxies can still be a problem because
spectroscopy of high redshift red galaxies is dicult
Therefore using a larger and homogeneous sample of
high redshift galaxies with secure redshift will allow
greatly improved constraints on their evolution New
ground and space-based IR multi-object spectrographs
WFC3 grism MMIRS MOSFIRE will allow inves-
tigations of more complete samples of galaxies and
studies the correlation between galaxy properties at
higher redshifts Dust-obscured starbursts are also

MM  1011 in GOODS-N eld The red lled circles are qui-
escent galaxies from CDF-S study with similar mass range and
red triangle is quiescent sample from van Dokkum et al 2008b
with median stellar masses of 17  1011M The dashed line
shows the best tting size evolution to the UV-bright galaxies
re  1  z111013 The plot indicates that the UV-selected
galaxies are larger than quiescent galaxies and their sizes evolve
with redshift
for disk galaxies remains constant from z  1 to the
present Selection eects likely play a role Comparing
to the theoretical work the size evolution predicted by
Somerville et al 2008 is somewhat stronger than the
evolution we measured here
Star forming galaxies at high redshifts can be identi-
ed by means of dierent methods of sample selection
and can be assigned as dierent populations of galaxies
eg sub-mm or sBzK  and therefore studied separately
However many of these galaxy populations may over-
lap hence it worth checking out if they have comparable
properties We therefore compare sizes of UV-bright
galaxies to other types of star-forming galaxy popula-
tions at high redshift ie sBzK galaxies and SMGs We
show that these two populations have comparable sizes
to the UV-bright galaxies This suggests that in gen-
eral star forming galaxies have larger sizes than quies-
cent ones without regard to their type However sample
selection might alter the results We return to this pos-
sibility later in the section 73
72 Comparison to previous work
The strong growth of both star forming and qui-
escent galaxies has been shown by several authors
Trujillo et al 2006b Franx et al 2008 Williams et al
2010 Toft et al 2007 The size growth of star form-
ing galaxies studied here going as 1  z where

ies where the size evolves with   1 For exam-
ple Bouwens et al 2006 found   11  03 for a
sample of luminosity-selected dropout galaxies between
z  6 and z  25 while Dahlen et al 2007 nd

8 SUMMARY
We have performed the rst size evolution study of
UV-bright galaxies with secure redshifts in the GOODS-
North eld We derive half light radii of galaxies at a
wide range of redshifts up to z  35 Using sample of
galaxies with secure redshifts we have quantied the size
evolution of galaxies without the potential uncertainty of
photometric redshifts and conrm the previous studies
that galaxies of similar mass were generally smaller at
past and their sizes evolve with redshift Specically we
nd that
 UV-bright galaxies
z111013 conrming previous studies based on
photometric redshifts eg Trujillo et al 2006b
2007 Franx et al 2008 Williams et al 2010
strongly as
 UV-bright galaxies are signicantly larger than qui-
escent galaxies At the same mass the median dif-
ference is 045  009 dex
 The LBG BMBX and GALEXLBG samples
show smooth evolution with redshift
indicating
that these techniques indeed select similar UV-
bright galaxies at dierent redshifts
 The SMGs have half-light radii similar to UV-
bright galaxies of the same mass
