ABSTRACT
We explore the mass-assembly and chemical enrichment histories of star forming galax-
ies by applying a population synthesis method to a sample of 84828 galaxies from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 Our method decomposes the entire observed
spectrum in terms of a sum of simple stellar populations spanning a wide range of ages
and metallicities thus allowing the reconstruction of galaxy histories A comparative
study of galaxy evolution is presented where galaxies are grouped onto bins of neb-
ular abundances or mass We nd that galaxies whose warm interstellar medium is
poor in heavy elements are slow in forming stars Their stellar metallicities also rise
slowly with time reaching their current values Z  13Z in the last  100 Myr
of evolution Systems with metal rich nebulae on the other hand assembled most
of their mass and completed their chemical evolution long ago reaching Z  Z
already at lookback times of several Gyr These same trends which are ultimately
a consequence of galaxy downsizing appear when galaxies are grouped according to
their stellar mass The reconstruction of galaxy histories to this level of detail out of
integrated spectra oers promising prospects in the eld of galaxy evolution theories
Key words galaxies evolution - galaxies stellar content - galaxies statistics
INTRODUCTION
One of the major challenges of modern astrophysics is to
understand the physical processes involved in galaxy forma-
tion and evolution Signicant steps in this direction could
be made by tracing the build up of stellar mass and metal-
licity as a function of cosmic time
One way to address this issue is through cosmologi-
cally deep surveys which map how galaxy properties change
for samples at dierent redshifts z Among these proper-
ties the relation rst observed by Lequeux et al 1979 be-
tween heavy-element nebular abundance and galaxy mass
or its extension the luminosity-metallicity relation eg
Skillman et al 1989 Zaritsky et al 1994 are being exten-
sively used to probe the metal enrichment along cosmic
history Clear signs of evolution are being revealed by
studies of these relations at both intermediate Savaglio
et al 2005 Lamareille et al 2006 Mouhcine et al 2006 and
high z Shapley et al 2005 Maier et al 2006 Erb et al 2006
which generally nd signicant osets in these relations
when compared to their versions in the local Universe
Alternatively one may study galaxy evolution through
fossil methods which reconstruct the star formation his-
tory SFH of a galaxy from the properties of their stars
The most detailed studies of this sort are those based on
nearby galaxies including our own where color-magnitude
diagrams and even spectroscopy of individual stars are fea-
sible eg Smecker-Hane et al 1996 Hernandez et al 2000
Dolphin 2002 Rizzi et al 2003 Skillman et al 2003 Monaco
et al 2005 Koch et al 2005 Comparing such observations
with predictions of evolutionary synthesis models then al-
lows one to infer how stars were born as a function of time
as well as to constrain the chemical enrichment histories of
the galaxies eg Lanfranchi Matteucci  Cescutti 2006
Carigi Colin  Peimbert 2006 By mapping how stars be-
come richer in metals as a galaxy ages these studies provide
useful constraints for chemical evolution models
Beyond the local group and its neighborhood
sil methods must derive SFHs from integrated galaxy
spectra using either selected spectral
features Kau-
mann et al 2004 Brinchmann et al 2004 Gallazzi et al 2005
Nelan et al 2005 Thomas et al 2005 Bernardi et al 2006 or
the full spectrum Panter Heavens  Jimenez 2003 Heav-
ens et al 2004 Cid Fernandes et al 2005 Mathis Charlot 
Brinchmann 2006 Panter et al 2006 This approach works
Cid Fernandes et al
with much less information than is available from individ-
ual stars in galaxies so one cannot expect similar levels of
accuracy On the other hand integrated spectra of galax-
ies are now available by the hundreds of thousands from
modern spectroscopic surveys so the decrease in accuracy
is compensated by orders of magnitude increase in statistics
and by the broader range in galaxy types spanned by such
surveys It is therefore of great interest to explore methods
to retrieve information on galaxy evolution from integrated
spectroscopic data
In our ongoing series of papers entitled the Semi Em-
pirical Analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS Galax-
ies Cid Fernandes et al 2005 Mateus et al 2006a Stasinska
et al 2006 Mateus et al 2006b SEAGal IIV respectively
we have shown that a decomposition of galaxy spectra in
terms of instantaneous bursts of dierent ages t and
metallicities Z produces both excellent spectral ts and
astrophysically meaningful results So far however our de-
scription of SFHs has been extremely sketchy based on av-
erages over the t and Z distributions thus washing out
valuable time-dependent information
This paper shows that we can actually do much better
To illustrate this we have culled a sample of star-forming
SF galaxies from the SDSS Section 2 to which we apply
our synthesis method and derive mass-assembly and chemi-
cal enrichment histories Section 3 The evolution of stellar
mass and metallicity is then studied by grouping galaxies
with similar nebular abundances or mass Section 4 Details
of this analysis and cross-checks on the results reported here
are presented in a companion paper Asari et al  in prep
hereafter A07
We have recently completed detailed pixel-by-pixel spectral
ts of 573141 galaxies from the Main Galaxy Sample of the
SDSS Data Release 5 Adelman-McCarthy et al 2006 with
the synthesis code STARLIGHT described in SEAGal I and
II STARLIGHT decomposes an observed spectrum in terms
of a sum of simple stellar populations covering a grid of
25 ages from tj  1 Myr to 18 Gyr and 6 metallicities
Zj  00001 to 005 ie from 0005 to 25 Z Each of
these N  150 instantaneous bursts is represented by a
spectrum extracted from the evolutionary synthesis models

mass function Padova 1994 tracks and STELIB library Le

used in this plot and throughout our analysis The distri-
bution of points in this diagram resembles a ying seagull
with SF galaxies occupying the left wing and galaxies host-
ing an AGN on the right We dene SF galaxies as those

sample denitions involving dierent SN thresholds other

are presented in A07 Note that by selecting SF galaxies we
indirectly select spirals over elliptical galaxies

plund 2001 We believe this is the most reliable calibration
available in the literature since it is based on temperature-
based abundances in the metal-poor case and on the OII

regime using a large sample of giant HII regions
Zneb is both a physically motivated and mathematically
convenient coordinate to map galaxy positions along the left
wing in the BPT diagram From the tip of the SF-wing in Fig
1a to its bottom our SF sample spans the Zneb  0216
Z range In Fig 1b this interval is chopped onto 6 loga-
rithmic bins of width  log Zneb  013 dex except for the
rst one which is twice as wide to include more sources
Galaxies inside these same bins will be grouped together
in the analysis of star-formation and chemical enrichment
histories presented in the following
3 METHOD OF ANALYSIS
As thoroughly discussed in the literature on stellar popula-
tion synthesis the combination of noise in the data astro-
physical and mathematical degeneracies limits the amount
of information about galactic histories that can be extracted
from integrated spectra Clearly the 150 components of the
population vector used in our ts are a greatly over-detailed
description so some a posteriori compression of the results
to a lower dimension is needed Our previous papers SEA-
Gal IIV have taken this compression approach to its ex-
treme by reducing the whole t and Z distributions encoded
in the population vector to their rst moments
hlog tiM 
j log tj
hZiM 
j Zj
where j is the fraction of the total stellar mass M which
is in the jth population
Both hlog ti and hZi proved to be mathematically ro-
bust and astrophysically valuable summaries of the full pop-
ulation vector In SEAGal I II and A07 these averages are
shown to cleanly reveal important relations such as those
between hlog ti and M associated with the galaxy down-
sizing phenomenon hZi and M the mass-metallicity re-
lation and hZi and Zneb which reveals a connection be-
tween stellar and nebular chemical enrichment levels Given
this success it is natural to explore less drastic compressions
of the population vector

hosting AGN The dashed line shows the dividing line used by Kaumann et al 2003 b The SF sample chopped into six bins of
nebular abundance The number of galaxies in each bin is given in the right along with the corresponding mean Zneb values in solar
units Galaxies close to bin borders are not plotted for clarity
One way to compress the population vector but retain
the age-information is to marginalize over the Zj distribu-
tion and compute the total mass converted into stars as a
function of time
and to the time dependence of the returned mass Accord-
ingly only populations older than t enter the denition of
j t since younger ones had not formed yet ie j t  0
for tj  t
t  X
tj t
4 RESULTS
where c
j denotes the fraction of the total mass converted
onto stars M c
  that is associated with the jth base age
The superscript c stands for converted onto stars and is
introduced to distinguish c
 from j and M which
refer to the mass still locked inside stars ie discounting the
mass returned to the inter-stellar medium ISM by stellar
evolution c
t is thus a monotonic function which grows
from 0 to 1 as t runs from the time galaxy formation starts
to the present and maps what fraction of M c
 was assembled
up to a given lookback time1
j and M c
To track the evolution of the stellar metallicity we com-
pute the total mass in metals inside stars as a function of t
and divide it by the total mass inside stars at the same time
This yields the time-dependent mean stellar metallicity
Zt  X

tj t
The computation of j t takes into account that the total
mass inside stars changes with time both due to the SFH
1 Since our main goal is to compare the intrinsic evolution of
galaxies throughout this letter we consider ages in the context
of stellar-evolution alone ie as if all galaxies were observed at
z  0 such that t is both a stellar-age and a lookback time
The explicit time-dependence in equations 4 and 5 pro-
vides a description of the star formation and chemical histo-
ries of galaxies which goes well beyond that obtained with
the mere rst moments of the age and metallicity distribu-
tions Given the numerous degeneracies which aect popu-
lation synthesis of galaxy spectra one might be skeptical as
to how useful they actually are Simulations addressing this
issue will be presented elsewhere In what follows we report
what is obtained in practice
41 Galaxy evolution in Zneb-bins
Our strategy is to chop the SF-wing into bins in Zneb and
study the evolution of galaxies from the statistics of c
t
and Zt in each bin The fact that Zneb correlates strongly
with several physical and observational properties guaran-
tees that galaxies inside each Zneb bin are intrinsically sim-
ilar which in turn implies that statistics over such bins is
meaningful
Fig 2a shows the mean mass-assembly functions ob-
tained for each of the six Zneb bins illustrated in Fig 1b The
systematics is evident to the eye Galaxies with low Zneb
are slower in assembling their stars than those with high
Zneb This behavior reects the fact that although most of
the mass is assembled at early times t

curves just enough to smooth out discreteness eects associated
to the 25 ages in the base
at the tip of the SF-wing have larger star formation rates
SFR per unit mass in the recent past than those at the
bottom of the wing This trend can be quantied in terms
the ratio of the mean SFR in the last 60 Myr to that over
the galaxys history ie the so called Scalos b parameter eg
Brinchmann et al 2004 We nd b to decrease by a factor
of  20 from the lower to the higher Zneb bins SFRs are
discussed in A07 where it is also shown that our synthesis
based SFRs agree very well with those derived from the H
luminosity Alternatively one may quantify this behavior
by computing the time at which the mean c
t function
reaches 075 ie the time at which the mass involved in star-
formation reaches 34 of the total We nd that 75 increases
from  08 Gyr at Zneb  031 bin A in Fig 1b to 2 Gyr
at Zneb  077Z bin D and 8 Gyr for the highest Zneb
bin Given that Zneb correlates strongly with M Zaritsky
et al 2004 Tremonti et al 2004 Lee et al 2006 this behav-
ior is ultimately a signature of galaxy downsizing Cowie
et al 1996
The chemical evolution of stars in SF galaxies is shown
in Fig 2b Again the main message is clear Galaxies with
a metal poor ISM are low are slow in their stellar chemi-
cal enrichment In the lower Zneb bins Zt only reaches
the current stellar metallicity level  13Z as recently as
t  100 Myr Galaxies with larger Zneb on the other hand
have atter and systematically higher Zt curves These
massive systems have essentially completed their mass as-
sembly and chemical evolution long ago so that recent star-
forming activity has a negligible impact upon Zt

higher present Z values conrms that nebular and stel-
lar metallicities are related SEAGal I Gallazzi et al 2005
A07 We nevertheless warn the reader not to overinterpret
the quantitative relation between these two quantities given
that they are derived by completely dierent and hardly
comparable means In this paper we use OIIINII as an
indicator of Zneb equation 1 because of its evident relation
to the position of the points in the BPT diagram However
as emphasized by Stasinska 2006 strong line methods for
deriving nebular abundances have been calibrated using gi-
ant HII regions and their relevance for integrated spectra
of galaxies has still to be examined because of the role of
metallicity gradients and of the diuse ionized medium in
galaxies In addition there is so far no study comparing neb-
ular abundance calibrations with stellar abundances There-
fore our Zneb values are not necessarily on the same scale as
stellar abundances Insofar as this paper is concerned this
is not a problem since irrespective of absolute values it is
the existence of a Zneb-Z relation which is responsible for
the ordering of the dierent chemical evolution curves in Fig
42 Galaxy evolution in Mass-bins
While Fig 2 illustrates the strong link between the stellar
mass assembly and chemical evolution histories of galaxies
and the present ionized ISM metal content Zneb is not the
cause but the product of galaxy evolution so its use as
an independent variable although pedagogically useful is
questionable If one had to chose a single quantity as the
main driver of galaxy evolution this would surely be its mass
eg Tinsley 1968 Larson 1974 Pagel 1997
The fact that bins of increasing Zneb have increasingly
We have thus repeated the analysis above binning galax-
Uncovering the chemical enrichment and mass-assembly histories of star-forming galaxies
ies by M instead of Zneb Results are shown in Fig 3 for ve
1 dex-wide mass bins centered at log MM  75    115
Because of the attening of the M  Zneb relation at high
masses and the substantial scatter around the relation par-
ticularly at low M and Zneb binning in M or Zneb samples
somewhat dierent populations of galaxies On the whole
however this alternative grouping scheme leads to the same
general scenario outlined above with low M galaxies be-
ing slower in their mass and chemical build up than more
massive ones A caveat is that M is not a perfect tracer of
the depth of the potential well since it does not account for
the mass in gas nor dark matter In any case the signature
of galaxy downsizing is evident in Fig 3 massive galaxies
today formed most of their stars and metals long time ago
whereas low-mass galaxies are still forming stars and metals
actively
The signal of chemical evolution is present in all curves
in Figs 2b and 3b Curiously however this evolution does
not seem to start from very low Z for massive high Zneb
galaxies eg bins E and F We interpret this apparent lack
of old metal poor populations as due to a combination of
lack of age resolution at high t and an intrinsically fast evo-
lution ocurring at early times In low mass systems eg bin
A Zt starts is t  2 Gyr long rise period at t  23
Gyr such that tt is of order unity The same process
happening at t  10 Gyr would yield tt  02 and
consequently be much harder to resolve As shown above
above by t  10 Gyr massive galaxies had already assem-
bled most of their mass so their chemical evolution must
also have occurred early on This mixture of populations of
widely dierent metallicities but similar ages results in Z
values at t  10 Gyr which are dominated by the metal rich
stars already present at those times Such an early and rapid
formation period should lead to enhancement of elements
synthesized in type II SNe Worthey Faber  Gonzalez
1992 Thomas et al 2005 Though we cannot map elemen-
tal abundances with our method we do detect a signal of
increasing  enhancement towards the bottom of the BPT
diagram by means of systematically increasing residuals in
spectral bands due to  elements like Mg A07 indirectly
supporting the scenario outlined above
5 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Our analysis shows that the present ISM abundance is in-
timately connected to the past star-formation and chemical
enrichment history of a galaxy Whereas this is intuitively
obvious from a physical point of view it is not obvious at
all that one should be able to recover this behavior from
population synthesis analysis of integrated galaxy spectra
of SDSS-like quality We emphasize that unlike previous
studies such as that by Bica 1988 our ts impose no a
priori chemical evolution constraints whatsoever upon the
mixture of tjs and Zj s in the base Given the absence of
constraints and the fact that the ts are completely indepen-
dent of the emission line data used to compute Zneb the or-
ganization of galaxies with dierent Zneb onto the clear and
systematically distinct stellar chemical enrichment patterns
seen in Fig 2b is remarkable revealing that fossil methods
based on integrated spectra have reached a level of matu-
rity which would be unthinkable just a few years ago eg
Cid Fernandes et al 2001 By taking the spectral synthesis
output one step further than the trivial rst moments of the
t and Z distributions we have been able to uncover the
chemical evolution of galaxies with an unprecedented level
of detail for such a large and varied sample This signicant
achievement was only possible due to the fabulous statistics
of the SDSS combined with state-of-the-art evolutionary
synthesis models and reliable SFH recovery techniques The
sheer number of galaxies allows us to recover an unequivocal
chemical evolution signal which would be at best doubtful
for individual galaxies or even small samples Combined with
our estimates of the star-formation histories the empirically
derived chemical evolution patterns should provide valuable
constraints for galaxy evolution models
