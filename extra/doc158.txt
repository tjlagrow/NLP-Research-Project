Nearby Galaxies Templates for Galaxies
Across Cosmic Time
Abstract Studies of nearby galaxies including the Milky Way have provided
fundamental information on the evolution of structure in the Universe the ex-
istence and nature of dark matter the origin and evolution of galaxies and the
global features of star formation Yet despite decades of work many of the most
basic aspects of galaxies and their environments remain a mystery In this paper
we describe some outstanding problems in this area and the ways in which large
radio facilities will contribute to further progress
Introduction
The nearby Universe oers us the products of cosmic evolution  galaxies  the archetypes
for all objects elsewhere in the Universe The Milky Way MW and our closest neighbors
like the Magellanic Clouds provide the best data for understanding how a galaxys structure
inuences the ability of gas to form stars Local galaxies can be used to derive star formation
SF laws and to characterize the broad range of galaxy types from ellipticals to irregulars
from spirals to active galaxies Locally we can examine galaxy interactions and group and
cluster inuences We can study nearby starbursts HI supershells and nuclear activity in
detail A knowledge of local galaxy parameters and their origin is critical to understanding
objects at large redshifts where we will require well-characterized templates of galaxies of
all morphologies and Hubble types derived from studies of the nearby Universe
Some key questions that motivate the study of nearby galaxies include
 How did galaxies grow
 What connects galactic structure and star formation
 How do feedback processes aect galactic evolution
 What is the origin and importance of magnetic elds
 How are dark and baryonic matter related on the galactic scale
The image of the M81M82 group shown in Fig 1left illustrates the range of phenomena
accessible for study in the nearby Universe galaxy interactions spiral structure large-scale
star formation molecular clouds group and cluster dynamics and starbursts In the coming
decade study of nearby galaxies will remain a vital activity
2 How do galaxies grow
Cold dark matter plus dark energy CDM models predict that galaxies are formed when
baryons condense within dark matter halos which in turn are connected via thin laments
the cosmic web The evolution of galaxies is driven by interactions and mergers accretion
of fresh gas and feedback from stellar evolution At every stage there are major gaps in our
understanding
Gas accretion not only at early times but continuously to the present appears to be
indispensable given the chemistry and star formation history of todays galaxies In the local
Universe obvious gas accretion mechanisms include minor and major mergers of galaxies
galaxy interactions and ows from gas in galaxy halos or from the cosmic web Our best
hope of understanding the details of these processess is by observing them locally By
studying galaxy groups we can determine the rate and process of galaxy interactions and
can delineate the history and future of galaxy mergers eg the Magellanic Stream and the
M81M82 group HI trails In nearby galaxies and the MW high-velocity HI clouds may
be evidence of current cool gas accretion 17 Study of the cosmic web has its own set
of questions What is the metallicity of the web Is there enough material and can it be
transferred to galaxies eciently enough to satisfy the chemistry model requirements Does
the local cosmic web behave like high-z Ly-alpha absorbers 2 6
3 What connects star formation to galaxy structure
Today the brightest stars form in spiral arms of galaxies This simple observational result
demonstrates the tight connection between galactic dynamics which is largely determined
by dark matter and star formation We know that compression and cooling of atomic gas
leads to the formation of molecular clouds but there are many gaps in our understanding
of this process On large scales molecular clouds are embedded in the densest atomic gas
reservoirs On smaller scales however the simple correlation breaks down and the two gas
phases are displaced from each other 13 The location and mass of molecular clouds is thus
not simply related to the distribution of the atomic phase global as well as local eects are
important for the formation of molecular clouds see Fig 1right of CO in M 51
The mass function of individual dense cores in a molecular cloud has a striking similar-
ity to the initial mass function of stars implying that the core mass function is somehow
preserved throughout star formation in spite of the small fraction of gas that is converted
into stars low star formation eciency and the very complex processes that are involved
in the gravitational collapse of gas into a compact object 18 1 14 An integrated way
to express this property is the Kennicutt-Schmidt law The study of local and global star
formation processes is one of the major themes in the eld of nearby galaxy research Vol-
ume limited surveys of all galaxies within a distance of 10 Mpc are currently underway at
many wavelengths the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy LVL Survey ANGST VLA-ANGST
Little THINGS 11HUGS ATLAS3D etc in a program to build up a statistically mean-
ingful sample useful in deriving star formation laws and evolutionary pathways The results
of these surveys will provide the foundation for the interpretation of observations at higher
redshifts and for understanding the evolution of star formation as a function of cosmic time
4 Feedback processes in Galactic Evolution
Galaxy growth is not a one-way route The accretion of gas onto galaxies provides the
material for further star formation which ultimately produces massive stars supernovae and
black holes which in turn inject material and energy back into the surrounding ISM 19
Feedback processes are indispensable elements of cosmic and galaxy evolution models along
the Hubble sequence however feedback is one of the most poorly constrained parameters
Figure 1 Left The M81M82 group as observed in HI with the GBT and
the VLA superimposed on an optical image This field contains a range of
galaxy types including a starburst evidence for strong interactions and
a fairly normal star-forming spiral 5 Right CO1-0 emission from the
galaxy M51 showing the spiral pattern of molecular clouds 9
in galaxy models What governs the exchange of matter between a galactic disk and the
intergalactic medium
The most prominent examples of feedback are certainly the bright starburst and active
galaxies such as M82 and Cen A Depending on the gravitational potential of the host
however lower level star formation across galactic disks could be even as eective in return-
ing energy and metals to the IGM as nucleated starbursts This eect is amplied by the
sheer number of low mass galaxies Other gas removal mechanisms include tidal interac-
tions ram pressure stripping and galaxy harassment Those less obvious but possibly very
important facets of feedback can be studied only in the nearby Universe To understand
distant starbursts we need templates from the local Universe eg M82 for understanding
the underlying mechanisms that drive maintain and terminate starburst events
41 Feedback from Star Formation
Energy and metals produced as the byproduct of stellar evolution are circulated throughout
galaxies and into the intergalactic medium through phenomena such as jets winds super-
bubbles and galactic fountains The redistribution of matter and energy aects galactic and
stellar evolution and may even modify the dark matter halo 11 15 A starburst can be
strong enough to remove all gas thus stopping further SF processes On the other hand
density enhancements around SF regions may trigger further secondary SF A key ques-
tion is if star formation must be initiated by large galactic scale processes such as spiral
arms and bars or whether the turbulent ISM itself might trigger widespread low-level SF
Episodic star formation is observed in many galaxies often triggered by interactions But is
an interaction always required or does the cooling of heated-up gas from former SF events
determine the timescale for subsequent bursts and thus the episode timescales
Each SF event injects large amounts of energy into the surrounding medium Yet there are
regions characterized by very high levels of star formation in a relatively small volume How
long can this be maintained How are star-forming regions fed with gas without destroying
them Why are there large amounts of molecular gas adjacent to a region of extremely large
ionizing ux as occurs in starbursts And nally if starbursts can be maintained over a
long period how are they stopped Is it pure starvation of feeding material or are there
other mechanisms in place Is there the equivalent of the Eddington luminosity limit for
starbursts in nearby galaxies
42 Feedback from Galactic Nuclei
During the last decade an intriguing almost linear relationship was extablished between
the bulge mass of galaxies and the mass of their central black hole 12 This is surprising as
the bulge is  700 times more massive than the central black hole and should dominate the
system Feedback processes from the black hole however might aect star formation in its
surroundings and thus the bulge mass 16 This feedback can be studied in great detail only
in nearby galaxies Active nuclei can produce large scale jets that inuence interstellar and
intergalactic space to Mpc scales Jets may induce star formation or prevent star formation
7 11 In addition AGN are frequently observed in conjunction with nucleated starbursts
sites of the most vigorous star formation activities in the Universe The bi-conical winds
produced by strong nuclear starbursts have a wider opening angle than jets and are able
to remove larger quantities of gas and importantly carry freshly produced metals out of
a galaxy To understand the feedback from galactic nuclei and to study their inuence on
their environments in detail it is indispensable to study nearby objects such as Cen A M 82
NGC 253 Fornax A or M 87 at high angular resolution and with sucient sensitivity In
particular the MW central black hole Sgr A provides a unique window into the connection
between the massive central object and its immediate surroundings
5 Molecules and Chemistry in the Local Universe
One of the major themes of radio astronomy has been the study of the interstellar medium
ISM which breaks down into various phases at dierent temperatures densities and ion-
ization fractions The chemical processes in the ISM produce a rich set of organic molecules
exotic species and pre-biotic molecules that may be relevant to the origin of life on earth
For several decades molecules have been used as probes of intersteller processess trans-
forming our understanding of star formation and evolution and the physical conditions in
molecular clouds eg 8
The coming decade will see increased activity in this area as well as a move to use as-
tronomical observations to study chemistry itself Terrestrial laboratories are largely limited
to studing reactions in liquids or high-density gases A question such as how does non-
equilibrium chemistry proceed in a weakly ionized gas in the presence of magnetic elds
crosses traditional disciplinary boundries as it can be answered only by astronomical obser-
vations in conjunction with theoretical and laboratory studies
Radio astronomy is a unique tool for fundamental chemistry The lowest rotational
transitions of molecules are in the centimeter to sub-millimeter wavelength range The lines
are weak and often from extended sources so progress thusfar has been limited to study of
only a handful of molecular clouds almost entirely in the MW In coming years however
studies will be extended throughout the MW and to nearby galaxies as specic chemistry
questions are asked that require probes of specic physical conditions
6 The Origin and Importance of Magnetic Fields
Magnetic elds aect gas motions in galaxies and inuence perhaps control the collapse of
clouds into stars They couple energy from supernovae to the interstellar medium They
control the density and distribution of cosmic rays Yet the origin of the elds their evolu-
tion and many critical aspects of their interaction with gas remain controversial 21 10 3
How are magnetic elds generated in galaxies Is the eld related to structure and dynamics
of a galaxy How do the magnetic elds redistribute cosmic rays and halo gas Does
reconnection provide an important heat source for a galaxys disk and halo How does the
eld evolve as a dense core contracts to become a star
At the present time there are only a few galaxies that have good eld measurements
What is needed is a much larger sample so that we can understand how magnetic struc-
tures derive from other galaxy properties Zeeman splitting can provide the strength of the
magnetic eld in gas-rich regions of galaxies Rotation measures of background sources will
probe many sightlines and thus supply points in a grid on which to t on large scale magnetic
eld models Radio polarization sheds light on SN and SF dominated regions and events like
galactic outows
7 Dark Matter
About one-quarter of the mass of the Universe is in the form of Dark Matter DM likely
consisting of cold non-baryonic particles Outstanding questions include What is the rela-
tionship between the baryonic and dark matter components Are there naked dark-matter
structures in galactic halos Do nearby galaxies have the detailed structure implied by CDM
models and where are the missing satellite galaxies CDM predicts Are galactic warps cou-
pled to the dark matter What is the history of galaxy interactions in groups What is the
distribution of mass in the local group and what is the fate of the individual galaxies A
better characterization of the amount of DM on dierent size scales and how it is distributed
is a critical need
Astronomical observations can give considerable insight into the nature of DM through
precise astrometry we can determine the motion of nearby objects and deduce the local
gravitational potential Gas motions in the Milky Way and other galaxies are sensitive to
the potential on many size scales We can trace the movements of large objects like galaxies
in clusters Studies of the structure of nearby galaxies have already confronted DM models
with signicant constraints 4 This is an important and continuing activity
8 Fundamental Science Opportunities
 Extending Galactic Astronomy to a variety of galaxies
With increased collecting area and spatial resolution topics in Galactic astronomy
will be studied in other galaxies Subjects include the abundance and distribution of halo
gas and HVCs the details of star formation on the scale of individual pre-stellar cores the
relationship between atomic and molecular gas in SF regions the distribution of objects
like stars pulsars SNe and planetary nebulae and their inuence on the surrounding ISM
Currently this kind of science is restricted to the Milky Way with some data from our
closest neighbors like the Magellanic clouds and is thus coupled to a specic type of galaxy
with its very own evolutionary status and history To perform these studies in a variety of
galaxies  from dwarf irregulars to massive ellipticals from isolated to interacting galaxies
from starbursting to red and dead objects from face-on to edge-on galaxies from barred to
AGN environments  will change our knowledge fundamentally Some work on this has been
done already as shown in the gure of the M81M82 group and with some recent surveys
like THINGS 20 but in combination with multi-wavelength studies in the optical near-UV
and infrared the next generation of radio studies can characterize individual components of
star formation in galaxies of very dierent morphology size and evolutionary state Freed
from observational restrictions that have conned much of our studies to the immediate
Galactic neighborhood we will derive vastly more accurate statistics on every aspect of star
formation galactic structure and evolution
 The Chemistry of the Local Universe
With increased sensitivity radio astronomical observations will expand our understanding
of basic chemical processes as they proceed under conditions not achievable in terrestrial
laboratories to yield fundamental information on the nature of the chemical bond The use
of chemistry as an astrophysical probe and astronomy as a tool for chemistry will provide
unique opportunities for advancement of both elds
9 Radio Instrumentation and Nearby Galaxies
Radio observations are unique in providing information on galactic gas in its ionized neutral
atomic and molecular phases over a range of conditions and angular scales Radio observa-
tions are also unique in their ability to measure magnetic elds through Faraday rotation
the polarization of synchrotron emission and the Zeeman eect in spectral lines Only ra-
dio observations have the extremely high angular resolution necessary for the most precise
astrometry In addition some of the most interesting regions Infrared-dark clouds galactic
nuclei are deeply obscured at optical and infrared wavelengths and only radio observations
provide access to the physics within
 Radio capabilities provided in the next decade
EVLA1 and GBT2 observations of HI absorption against background sources may reveal
cosmic web laments in absorption along the line of sight and through Zeeman measure-
ments their magnetic eld GBT and EVLA studies of HI emission reveal the origin of
HVCs and their relation to Galactic structure in the Milky Way and nearby Galaxies
Measurement of HI in elds around individual galaxies and in galaxy groups with the GBT
and EVLA reveal signs of outows and interactions and their history The VLBA3 is being
used to derive Galactic structure to unprecedented accuracy revising the mass of the Milky
Way and maping the 3D velocity eld of the local group through observations of proper
motions of galaxies
EVLA GBT and ALMA can map the molecular clouds and cold dust in galaxies and
galactic nucleii and determine their physical properties and kinematics They can study
chemical processes under conditions in the ISM that can not be replicated on Earth The
GBT is the only instrument that can observe the important CO1-0 molecular line at essen-
tially every redshift Detailed studies of Sgr A with the EVLA and VLBA give information
that can be applied to other nuclei EVLA and GBT can measure magnetic elds in HI and
OH through the Zeeman eect
 Enhancements needed to achieve the science goals
The ultra-compact EVLA E array will provide sensitivity on angular scales needed to
make initial studies of the cosmic web in 21cm or radio continuum emission GBT focal plane
cameras in the HI line will allow deep mapping of wide areas and at 22 GHz will identify
extragalactic water masers for local group proper motion studies Focal plane cameras on the
GBT will provide wide-eld high-sensitivity mapping of molecular clouds in many molecular
lines at wavelengths as short as 3mm providing great synergy with ALMA EVLA E array
will improve sensitivity to molecular emission on arc-min scales Increased sensitivity of the
VLBA and HSA will allow precise astrometry on faint objects and more precise distances
to star-forming regions
