Abstract An introduction is given to projects investigating galaxy evo-
lution quantitatively by spectroscopic observations of very distant galax-
ies that have weak apparent brightnesses and small sizes as it is feasi-
ble with 10m-class telescopes like SALT Such methods encompass scal-
ing relations like the TullyFisher and Fundamental Plane relations that
can be utilized to determine the luminosity evolution and mass assem-
bly of galaxies The stellar populations can be analyzed with respect
to age metallicity and chemical enrichment by measureing absorption
line strengths Possible eects on galaxy evolution of the environment
in rich clusters of galaxies compared to the eld are also addressed For
each method recent applications are presented like the evolution of the
TFR determined with 77 eld spirals up to z  1 a study of the inter-
nal kinematics of distant cluster spirals and a comparison of the stellar
populations of ellipticals in the eld and in rich clusters at z  04
Introduction
In the local Universe we see a variety of galaxy types that can be distinguished
both by their morphology and their internal kinematics The two main families
are the spiral galaxies in which stars and gas rotate around the center in a
disk and the elliptical galaxies that are gravitationally stabilized by the random
motion of the stars within a triaxial body Some kind of intermediate class
are the lenticular or S0 galaxies with central bulges surrounded by disks
addition we observe irregular galaxies with many dierent structures
One of the main tasks of extragalactic research is to understand why the
galaxies appear in such dierent types
Is the structure of a galaxy already
xed at the time of its formation Or does it change during the time of its
evolution and is it subject to external inuence The vastly accepted paradigm
of galaxy formation is nowadays the theory of the hierarchical growth of all
structure in the Universe Large galaxies are built up via the merging of smaller
systems In such events the disk structure of the progenitors is transformed into
a spheroidal shape An important ingredient of the theory is the dominance of
cold dark matter and the main prediction is that the total mass of galaxies is
growing during the evolution
A rst step to quantify galaxy evolution is to study the luminosity of galax-
ies up to high redshifts with deep photometric observations Well-known deep
imaging are the Hubble Deep Fields Williams et al 1996 Casertano et al
Ziegler
2000 but their major drawback is their very small eld size Therefore the
Fors consortium1 made the eort to observe a comparable deep but larger eld
with the Fors instrument at the VLT Consuming some 72 hours pure integra-
tion time deep images were taken in the U BgRIz lters supplemented by J
and K near-infrared exposures with the NTT Heidt et al 2003 With the
aid of photometric redshifts number counts and luminosity functions can be
constructed up to redshifts z  5 in this Fors Deep Field FDF Gabasch et al
But a more robust test of the Cold Dark Matter theory would be the mea-
surement of the mass and size of distant galaxies because the brightness of
galaxies is subject to star formation processes A rather quiescent luminosity
evolution of the stellar population of a galaxy can get quickly wiped out by any
contemporary star burst even if it involves only a small fraction in mass From
pure photometry it is very dicult to judge whether any galaxy within a sample
is undergoing such an event
With 10m-class telescopes it is nowadays possible to take spectra with suf-
cient spectral and spatial resolution of faint galaxies down to  23R mag
reaching the necessary SN within reasonable exposure times Analyzing spec-
tral lines the characteristic velocity of the stars and gas within a galaxy can
be determined which is a measure for its total mass For elliptical galaxies
the width of absorption lines reects the internal velocity dispersion while for
spiral galaxies the Doppler shifts of emission lines trace the rotational speed
The characteristic size of distant galaxies can be determined in spatially highly
resolved images as they can be obtained either with the HST or groundbased
telescopes equipped with adaptive optics Important tools for the quantitative
investigation of galaxy evolution are scaling relations because entire samples of
galaxies can be compared with each other rather than just individual galaxies
Such scaling relations are for example the Fundamental Plane of ellipticals eg
Bender Burstein  Faber 1992 or the TullyFisher relation TFR of spirals
eg Pierce  Tully 1992 PT92
2 Evolution of the TullyFisher relation
As one example the TFR of galaxies up to z  1 corresponding to a lookback
time of  8 Gyr or half the age of the Universe2 is shown in Figure 1 Only
emissionline galaxies that exhibit a rotation curve RC which turns into a at
regime with constant velocity are suitable for display in such a TF diagram
The maximum rotational speed vmax in such a case is then a measure for the
total mass of the galaxy including its Dark Matter Distant galaxies impose
diculties on the analysis of RCs not only due to their faintness but because
their small sizes limit strongly the spatial extent of any emission line From a
sample of 113 spirals in the FDF we were able to determine vmax for 77 galaxies
with 01  z  1

Figure 1
pared to the local relation 3 from PT92 The distant sample is
subdivided into types Sa  Sb Sc and Sd  Im Panel b 13 galaxy
members of distant clusters overplotted on the FDF eld sample
Comparing the restframe B magnitudes for xed vmax between the distant
FDF sample and a local sample by PT92 we nd a substantial increase in the
luminosity for small galaxies but very similar brightnesses for large ones Ziegler
et al 2002 Bohm et al 2004 Such a mass-dependent evolution is not easily
explained by CDM theory since it involves the modeling of stellar populations
First simulations indicate that the eciency strength and duration of star for-
mation in a galaxy may depend on its total mass For a better understanding
spectroscopic observations of many more distant galaxies are needed too as it
will be possible with SALT This becomes even more obvious when we try to
subdivide the emissionline galaxies into dierent types as in Figure 1a Look-
ing into such subsamples will allow to investigate the impact of varying global
parameters like star formation rates or mass-to-light ratios
3 Environmental dependence of galaxy evolution
Looking at the distribution of dierent galaxy types it becomes obvious that the
average mean distance between galaxies must play a role in shaping a galaxys
structure This morphologydensity relation manifests itself most clearly in
the prevalence of earlytype galaxies in the center of rich clusters of galaxies
Dressler 1980 At the same time interactions between cluster galaxies and the
hot X-ray emitting intracluster gas or the cluster potential indicate phenomena
specic to clusters eg van Gorkom 2003 We also observe evolution in the
galaxy population of clusters ie
the mixture of the various types Distant
clusters at z  05 have for example a greatly reduced fraction of S0 galax-
ies that dominate the bright population locally while the number of ellipticals
stays nearly constant Dressler et al 1997 These ndings have provoked the
question whether eld spirals falling into a cluster could get transformed into S0
galaxies during the time due to clusterspecic processes Another environmental
dependence is given for the global star formation as it is observed to be largely
Ziegler
Figure 2
Examples of rotation curves of galaxies in distant clusters
Panels a and b represent RCs turning into a at part where vmax
can be measured by modeling the synthetic velocity eld solid line
Panels c and d display peculiar velocity curves
suppressed in cluster members eg Gomez et al 2003 Investigating galax-
ies in densities intermediate between the eld and cluster environments reveals
that at least two dierent interaction processes on dierent timescales must be
responsible for transforming galaxy structure and suppressing star formation
respectively eg Balogh et al 2002
Interactions can also aect a galaxys internal kinematics creating asymmet-
ric RCs for example or totally corrupted velocity elds eg Rubin Waterman
 Kenney 1999 In a Universe with hierarchically growing structure it is pre-
dicted that the galaxy merger rate and frequency of infalling galaxies increases
with redshift Observations should therefore investigate the internal kinematics
of galaxies in clusters up to z  1 as it is now possible with the big telescopes
like SALT Indeed spirals in clusters with 03  z  06 which we studied with
Fors display peculiar RCs Figure 2 Ziegler et al 2003 On the other hand
several cluster members have undistorted RCs with an outer at part These
galaxies can be compared to eld galaxies in a TF diagram allowing to inves-
tigate whether they might be under- or over-luminous for their measured vmax
Truncation of star formation in a cluster member leads to a dimming whereas
interaction-induced star bursts results in a brightening of the galaxy Our clus-
ter targets are distributed very similar to the distant FDF spirals so that their
stellar populations are momentarily not suspect to any changes Figure 1b But
it may well be that those galaxies with distorted RCs in our sample have star
formation rates which got aected by the same interaction process that pro-
duced the kinematic peculiarity Much larger samples of distant cluster galaxies
are needed to robustly investigate these issues
4 Evolution of the stellar populations
Another important tool next to scaling relations for the quantitative measure-
ment of galaxy evolution are diagnostic diagrams where absorption line strengths
are plotted versus each other and compared to a model grid A widely used ap-
plication is the LickIDS system in which Balmer lines in particular H are
taken as age sensitive indicators whereas the metallicity ZH is measured by
Galaxy evolution
Figure 3

cluster triangles ellipticals with hzi  04 compared to a sample of
Coma cluster galaxies small squares from K01 Overplotted are
TMB03-models enhanced in Mg MgFe  03 with ages 1 5 
15 Gyr solid lines top to bottom and ZH  03 0 03 07 dotted
lines left to right Panel b The same samples with models separated
by MgFe  0 03 05 top to bottom
combining Mg and Fe lines eg Faber et al 1985 More sophisticated stellar
population models can nowadays also distinguish between dierent enrichment
histories for various elements and are no longer xed to the solar abundance
eg Thomas Maraston  Bender 2003 TMB03 This opens the possibility
for another important test of CDM theory It is predicted that large elliptical
galaxies in high-density peaks corresponding to rich clusters are formed in a very
short time  1 Gyr with the bulk of their stars created in a vigorous star burst
whereas ellipticals in the eld get assembled all the time by major mergers of spi-
rals that already had an extended star formation history eg Kaumann 1996
The stellar populations of ellipticals in dierent environments should therefore
have dierent enrichment histories for the Mg or  elements and the Fe-peak
elements which can only be measured by spectroscopy This comes about be-
cause these element families are to rst order mainly produced by supernovae
of type II and type Ia respectively which have very dierent timescales SN IIs
are exploded massive stars which have a lifetime of only a few Myrs SN Ia are
the endproducts of a binary stellar system with an evolutionary time of  1 Gyr
If a cluster elliptical ended its star burst within a few Myrs then it should be
decient in Fe leading to MgFe ratios much larger than the solar mix or than in
eld ellipticals Since an accurate measurement of the absorption line strengths
needs a minimum SN of  30 spectroscopy of distant faint galaxies is only
feasible with the 10m-class telescopes like SALT
As an example two diagnostic diagrams are shown in Figure 3 for early
type galaxies in the Coma cluster Kuntschner et al 2001 together with eld
ellipticals from the FDF Ziegler et al 2004 and cluster ellipticals Ziegler 
Bender 1997 both samples having hzi  04 Since absorption lines of distant
galaxies can be corrupted if they are redshifted to a region with strong terrestrial
Ziegler
emission or absorption the number of galaxies is dierent for the two panels
and we do not use the classical combination of Fe lines but only the Fe5270
index for the assessment of Fe abundance The bulk of the data in Panel a can
be modeled with old ages with the distant galaxies being younger by  4 Gyr
on average than Coma compatible with the lookback time Three of the FDF
eld objects have luminosity-weighted ages of  2 Gyr and solar metallicity
which may indicate that these galaxies are the endproducts of a recent merger
between spirals None of the distant eld ellipticals reach the peak values in
metallicity of the cluster members The majority of the z  04 galaxies exhibit
a super-solar Mg overabundance relative to Fe like the local reference Panel b
