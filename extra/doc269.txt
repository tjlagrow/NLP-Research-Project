ABSTRACT
The problem of chemo-photometric evolution of late-type galaxies is dealt with relying on
prime physical arguments of energetic self-consistency between chemical enhancement of
galaxy mass through nuclear processing inside stars and luminosity evolution of the system
Our analysis makes use of the Buzzoni template galaxy models along the Hubble morpholog-
ical sequence The contribution of Type II and Ia SNe is also accounted for in our scenario
Chemical enhancement is assessed in terms of the so-called yield metallicity Z that is
the metal abundance of processed mass inside stars as constrained by the galaxy photometric
history For a Salpeter IMF Z  t023 being nearly insensitive to the galaxy star formation
history The ISM metallicity can be set in terms of Z and just modulated by the gas fraction
and the net fraction of returned stellar mass f  For the latter a safe upper limit can be placed
such as f  03 at any age
The comparison with the observed age-metallicity relation allows us to to set a rm upper
limit to the Galaxy birthrate such as b  05 and to the chemical enrichment ratio Y Z 
5 About four out of ve stars in the solar vicinity are found to match the expected Z gure
within a factor of two a feature that leads us to conclude that star formation in the Galaxy must
have proceeded all the time in a highly contaminated environment where returned stellar
mass is in fact the prevailing component to gas density
The possible implication of the Milky Way scenario for the more general picture of late-
type galaxy evolution is dicussed moving from three relevant relationships as suggested by
the observations Namely i the down-sizing mechanism appears to govern star formation in
the local Universe ii the delayed star formation among low-mass galaxies as implied by
the inverse b-Mgal dependence naturally leads to a more copious gas fraction when moving
from giant to dwarf galaxies iii although lower-mass galaxies tend more likely to take the
look of later-type spirals it is mass not morphology that drives galaxy chemical properties
Facing the relatively at trend of Z vs galaxy type the increasingly poorer gas metallicity as
traced by the OH abundance of HII regions along the Sa  Im Hubble sequence seems to
be mainly the result of the softening process that dilute enriched stellar mass within a larger
fraction of residual gas
The problem of the residual lifetime for spiral galaxies as active star-forming systems
has been investigated If returned mass is left as the main or unique gas supplier to the
ISM as implied by the Roberts timescale then star formation might continue only at a max-

1 INTRODUCTION
A fair estimate of galaxy metallicity has been widely recognized
as a basic issue when assessing the distinctive evolutionary prop-
erties of late-type galaxies LTGs including all disk-dominated
systems along the Hubble morphological sequence However since
both spiral and irregular galaxies consist of a composite stellar pop-
ulation the question cannot easily be settled as it depends on the
A Buzzoni
specic criterion we want to adopt to identify a value of Z or
equivalently of FeH ideally representative of the stellar system
as a whole
For example the youngest stars closely track the chemical
composition of gas clouds within a galaxy and we could therefore
refer to their value of Z as the galaxy actual metallicity Zo On
the other hand this value may not account for the composition of
earlier generations of stars that however still provide a sizable con-
tribution to galaxy total luminosity In this regard one would better
like to consider an effective metallicity estimate Zef f  by weight-
ing the composing stellar populations with their actual photometric
contribution or with the number of star members in each group
These arguments yet emerge in nuce from the seminal anal-
ysis of Schmidt 1963 but only Arimoto  Yoshii 1987 exten-
sively dealt with the problem of a fair estimate of the effective
metallicity in their LTG models using bolometric luminosity as
a weighting factor to account for the relative contribution of the
composing stellar populations With this criterion by considering
a collection of theoretical simple stellar populations SSPs with
a spread in the values of Z Buzzoni 1995 showed that the in-
tegrated spectral energy distribution SED for the aggregate still
resembled the spectrum of just one SSP with log Ze  hlog Zi
From her side Greggio 1997 further rened these arguments at
least in the early-type galaxy framework emphasizing the differ-
ence between average methods such as to lead to  F eH  vs
 F eH  A direct estimate of both Zo and Ze is provided by
Arimoto  Jablonka 1991 hereafter AJ91 in their LTG models
As expected the effective metallicity is found to be systematically
lower by a 20-30 with respect to the actual one
Apart from any operational denition however one has to
remark that the classical approach to galaxy chemical evolution
usually pursued in the literature mainly proceeds from a dynami-
cal point of view where chemical composition is tightly related to
the kinematical properties of the different stellar populations shar-
ing the galaxy morphological design Sandage  Fouts 1987 and
Koeppen  Arimoto 1990 are striking examples in this regard
of the empirical and theoretical focus to the problem respectively
After all just on these basis Baade 1944 led to his rst denition
of Pop I and II stars
However an even more direct physical argument ties metal
abundance to galaxy luminosity evolution For any gram of met-
als eventually produced in a galaxy in fact one gram of Hydro-
gen has been burnt at some time releasing a xed amount of en-
ergy As a consequencea straightforward relationship must be in
place between the actual amount of enriched mass in a galaxy
MYZ in the form of metals plus Helium in excess to the primor-
dial abundance and the past luminosity evolution The importance
of this constraint often overlooked even in the recent literature
has been rst raised by Wirth 1981 in the context of early-type
galaxy evolution and more explicitely assessed by Pagel 1997
This argument also found a more denite theoretical settlement
through the so-called Fuel consumption theorem as proposed by
Renzini  Buzzoni 1983 1986
Given the range of interesting implications for the study of
galaxy evolution we want here to further investigate the problem of
the energetic constraint to chemo-photometric evolution of galax-
ies with special attention to the more composite scenario of late-
type systems Our analysis will rely on the template galaxy models
developed in Buzzoni 2005 2002 To better catch the real inten-
tion of this paper we would like to warn the reader that our dis-
cussion will proceed as far as possible on analytical bases This
will forcedly require some educated simplications to the problem
after careful physical assessing however of the neglected compli-
cations with the aim of more neatly let to emerge the leading
relationships that govern galaxy evolution and in particular the
way these systems and the Universe as a whole constrained their
chemical composition at the different cosmic epochs
2 THEORETICAL FUNDAMENTALS
In order to better single out the relevant physical boundaries in-
volved in our problem we need to consider basically the two main
photometric contributions that constrain overall galaxy luminosity
evolution From one hand in fact we can recognize the smooth
photometric contribution by stars along their quiescent namely
hydrostatic evolutionary stages according to a given IMF On
the other hand one has also to consider the Supernova bursting
events that interleave galaxy evolution with short but extremely
relevant episodes of mass processing
Following Clayton 1983 H-burning cycles release 26731
MeV per 4He particle while a supplementary amount of 7274
MeV per 12C nucleus is produced by the 3 He-burning cycle
Overall the energy budget of the nuclear processes that lead to Car-
bon synthesis in stars reaches a total of
W  698 1018 erg g1
This specic energy output accounts for the quiescent luminosity
emission of a galaxy provided by the non-explosive evolutionary
stages of stars along the entire IMF mass range
A supplementary important source of energy and ISM metal
enrichment should however comprise also the SN explosive events
A quite different elemental pattern characterizes the ISM chemi-
cal enrichment in case of SNeIa meant to be the main synthesizers
of the Fe-Ni elemental group Chevalier 1976 Nomoto 1980 and
SNeII which stem on the contrary from the core collapse of high-
mass stars and mainly supply Oxygen and other heavier  elements
eg Matteucci  Greggio 1986 Trimble 1991 Nevertheless both
these events may actually be treated coherently in terms of specic
energy release as they take in charge the post-Carbon nuclear burn-
ing up to Iron synthesis and beyond Again following Clayton
1983 whatever the chemical path of nuclear reactions the atomic
binding energy difference implies to release 60605 MeV per 56Fe
nucleus or equivalently
WSN  103 1018 erg g1
Compared to quiescent nuclear reaction chains for xed
amount of released energy explosive nucleosynthesis is therefore
roughly a factor of seven more efcient in the whole Z enrichment
of the Universe selectively involving however only the heaviest
metal supply see eg Matteucci 2004 for a brief but timely focus
on this subject
21 Processed mass by quiescent luminosity evolution
Let us explore rst the general case of a system consisting of a com-
posite stellar population CSP as a result of a roughly continual
feeding of fresh stellar generations along the whole photometric
history The nature itself of the problem suggests to consider the
total bolometric luminosity of the CSP as a convolution integral of
several simple stellar populations SSPs continually distributed in
time according to a given star formation rate SFR namely
LCSP Z SSP   SFR d
In Buzzoni 2005 we have shown that SSP bolometric lu-
minosity SSP smoothly evolves with time according to a sim-
ple power law such as SSPt  t for a Salpeter IMF the
power index   077 is virtually independent from the SSP
chemical composition1 Our template galaxy models considered a
disk SFR with a characteristic birthrate b  SF RohSF Ri see
for instance Miller  Scalo 1979 depending on the morpholog-
ical type Kennicutt Tamblyn  Congdon 1994 The distinctive
gas  star conversion efciency implies for the star formartion
rate a power-law time dependence such as SFRt  t so that

Within this framework the total luminosity of a CSP at time t
becomes therefore
  t    d
LCSPt  C Z t
with a normalization constant C depending on the total mass of
the aggregate Providing that both   1 and   1 the integral
equation has the Euler Beta function as a straightforward analytical
solution More explicitely it can also be written as

ence epoch to one can simply write

If we integrate the CSP emitting power LCSP over the entire
galaxy life until time T  this eventually gets the global energy E

Interestingly enough eq 8 shows that the way metals enhance
with time in a CSP does not depend on the SFR details being
fully modulated on the contrary by the IMF slope which even-
tually constrains the CSP luminosity evolution through the power
index  Furthermore in the same equation note that a parameter

Reference stellar mass Mo and the corresponding CSP luminosity
LCSPto are of course strictly related depending on the SFR de-
tails Relying on the Buzzoni 2005 2002 theoretical framework
we computed in Table 1 the expected value of the ML ratio at
15 Gyr for different CSPs col 3 in the table along a range of
values of the SFR power index  col 1 and stellar birthrate b
col 2 These values are representative of the full range of scenar-
ios that characterize disk evolution for the different LTG models
From the values of ML one can easily derive the expected CSP
bolometric luminosity LCSPto as well as the value of Eo at the
reference age col 4 and 5 respectively of Table 1 Finally the
burning efciency factor F is also computed in column 6
As both the total stellar mass and luminosity respond in the
same way to the SFR one has that

L cid12cid12cid12cid12tocid18 t
that is time evolution of galaxy ML ratio is a nearly universal law
that only depends on the observing wavelength and for bolometric
and a Salpeter IMF scales aproximately as ML  t34
The SFR enters on the contrary by setting the absolute value
of ML at a given age for example when compared to a simple
star burst a smooth star formation will result on average in a larger
number of young bright stars of high mass at a given age This
means in general that ML decreases with decreasing  In this
regard a convenient t to the data of Table 1 provides

22 Supernova processing
The quiescent evolution of galaxy luminosity as described by
previous equations does not take into account the extra-energy re-
lease and the corresponding extra-metal production by the SN
events As well known supernovae display a composite genesis
From one hand in fact Type II SNe basically deal with the CO
core collapse of individual stars with conveniently high mass such
as to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit near the end of their photo-
metric evolution On the other hand a much more composite family
of objects shortly grouped into Type Ia SNe has to be reconducted
to binary-star evolution In this case the key mechanism deals with
A Buzzoni
the mass transfer between the system members where a primary
originally more massive star in its way to the nal white-dwarf
WD death acts as a fresh-matter supplier to boost evolution of
the secondary member The latter star will therefore be prompted
at some stage to feed back the WD with fresh fuel until triggering
under appropriate physical conditions the fatal detonation on the
WD surface
As well known the complexity of this scenario characterized
by a number of unknown or poorly constrained physical parame-
ters ie orbit parameters total mass of the system and mass ratio
of the members is the main source of uncertainty even in more ex-
plicit and sophisticated models of galaxy chemical evolution see
in particular Matteucci  Greggio 1986 for a brilliant assessment
of the problem All the more reason let us try here a simplied ap-
proach just to single out the few leading quantities that constrain
our relevant physical output
221 Type II SNe
Considering rst the core-collapse events originating by the explo-
sion of stars with Mup  8  1 M see eg Smartt et al 2009
one has that the expected total number of events per unit SSP total
mass can be written as
Figure 1 The expected fraction of enriched stellar mass provided by the
SN II events according to three different IMF power-law indices Salpeter
case is for s  235 and for a different value of the SN triggering mass
Mup The consensus case is marked by the big dot on the Salpeter curve
Vertical error bars derive from eq 14
As a consequence the appearence of SNII on the scene of galaxy
evolution just enters with a straight offset to metallicity3

where we assume a power-law IMF according to footnote 1 re-
marks For a Salpeter case ie s  235 and in force of the fact
that galaxy SFR does not change much on a time-scale comparable
with the lifetime of stars with M  Mup namely a few 107 yr at
most see eg eq 3 in Buzzoni 2002 we have
nSNIIt  0126 M 135

For Mup  8M this leads to a rate of 76 103 SNII events
per year for a SF R  1 M yr1 This gure perfectly matches
the empirical rate of 75  25 103 independently obtained by
Scannapieco  Bildsten 2005 on the basis of the observed SN
rate density within z 6 1 by Dahlen et al 2004 compared against
the cosmic SFR density as measured by Giavalisco et al 2004

From the theoretical side Greggio  Renzini 1983 have rst ar-
gued that the SNIa population originates from the mix of two stellar
components In fact the SN detonation may set on both on He-rich
WDs mainly coming from the evolution of relatively low-mass
stars about 2-3 M and on the surface of CO-rich WDs the nal
output of more massive stars about 5-8 M4 This difference to-
gether with the binary nature of the physical mechanism that drives
the explosion makes the total SNIa rate to depend at least on two
reference parameters From one hand simple evolutionary argu-
ments on the stellar lifetime sets a minimum characteristic delay
time SNI for the SN burst which may follow the star forma-
tion event and the rst SNII burst by a few 107 yrs for CO-rich
WDs Tornambe  Matteucci 1986 up to several 108 yrs for He-
rich WDs Greggio  Renzini 1983 On the other hand the broad
range of geometric and physical parameters of the binary system
may even further displace in time the SN event blurring the con-
tribution of the two feeding channels into a composite delay-time
distribution namely t that we eventually have to deal with
From the observing side Mannucci et al 2005 have rmly
demonstrated that SNIa rate among spiral galaxies tightly re-
lates to the corresponding rate of core-collapsed SNe the lat-
ter meant to closely trace the galaxy SFR This feature evidently
sets important contrains to the SNI distribution leading Greggio
2005 to conclude that in a SSP the distribution function of
3 Given the special nature of the explosive SN nuclesynthesis the reported
value should account for the emitted luminosity as obtained for
instance from the time integration of the SN lightcurve Milone  Milone
1988 eg plus the kinetic energy associated to the SN burst The latter
contribution is actually by far the prevailing one and it exceeds by about
two orders of magnitude the emitted luminosity itself Woosley  Janka
4 In any case the upper mass of SNI progenitors must be edged by the
on-set mass Mup of core-collapsed SNeII
Chemo-photometric evolution of spiral galaxies
the delay times decreases with time This means that the major-
ity of SNIa precursors are relatively short lived On this line
Maoz Sharon Gal-Yam 2010 argued that over 50-85 of the
whole SNIa population in a SSP are expected to explode within the
rst Gyr from the starburst On the other hand the residual pres-
ence of Type Ia SNe even among quiescent early-type galaxies
that is in lack of any evident star formation activity calls for a few
very delayed events and therefore for a skewed long-term tail of
the delay-time distribution Dallaporta 1973 Mannucci et al 2005

oretical gures for the SSP case indicate that   t with

Scannapieco  Bildsten 2005 we adopt
for our discussion
the Mannucci et al 2005 empirical parameterization for the
observed SNIa rate see eq 2 therein One can therefore envisage
a prevailing term directly related to galaxy SFR and an extended
SN fraction to recall the Scannapieco  Bildsten 2005 original
notation that collects the most delayed events and can therefore
total stellar mass of a galaxy
be meant to scale at any time with R SFRtdt that is with the
For the rst component the direct SFR dependence is obtained
through the core-collapsed SN rate as from eq 12 assuming with

This rate is nicely conrmed within the errors also by

In case of a star-forming CSP with power-law SFR the mass-
specic event number that occurred up to age T can be written as
where the associated energy for a typical SNI event again
in unit of 1051 erg is of the same order than for SNeII
namely ESNI

Hillebrandt et al
However the lh term of eq 16 has to be regarded as a some-
what asymptotic value for the enriched mass fraction as it considers
virtually no delay in the SNIa appearence being both enriched and
total stellar mass perfectly tuned with SFR If we set SNeIa to come
on the galaxy stage just after the rst SNII metal glitch say for
SNI  50 Myr or so ie the reference lifetime for a 5 M star
then one has to scale previous equation by a factor 1 1 with
  tSNI After this correction we eventually obtain

M  0001915
where the error bars have been conservatively computed by loga-
rithmic error propagation
To this contribution one has further to add the long-term ex-
tended SN component whose number of events according to
Mannucci et al 2005 amounts to

quicker rate compared to the reference SFR for our model galaxies In force
of this argument we can therefore expect the bulk of SNIa to safely trace
the SFR all the time

23 Metals versus Helium the enrichment ratio
With the help of data in Table 1 through eq 6 and 8 it is im-
mediate to derive both disk luminosity ie LCSP and the amount
of chemically enriched mass MYZ along galaxy life
One may even rely on the expected enrichment
R  Y Z to single out
the fraction of Helium and
heavy elements eventually produced The R parameter can
be tuned up either empirically for example via the observa-
tion of Galactic and extragalactic HII clouds Lequeux et al
1979 Serrano  Peimbert 1981 Pagel et al 1992 Maciel 2001
Peimbert Peimbert  Luridiana 2002 Casagrande et al 2007
or theoretically from stellar evolution theory Maeder 1992
Marigo Chiosi  Kudritzki 2003 Some unsettled discrepancies
still exist in this regard with theory easing in general a more copius
production of metals within the stellar population thus implying a
systematically lower value of R compared to the the observational
evidence As rst pointed out by Mallik  Mallik 1985 this dis-
crepancy might be reconciled from the theoretical side by acting on
the IMF upper edge such as to decrease the expected contribution
of the high-mass stellar component Allover an admitted range be-
tween R  31 is accepted in the literature eg Tosi 1996 Maciel
2001 Fukugita  Kawasaki 2006 and will be considered here
We could therefore introduce the concept of galaxy yield
metallicity and Helium content dened respectively as
Z  M 
Y Z M SN
Y  Yp  R Z
1  R

where Y  Yp is the Helium abundance in excess to the primordial
content Yp
3 RELEVANT MODEL OUTPUT
The yield abundance of eq 24 can be regarded as the actual
mean composition of the bright stars in a CSP at a given epoch Re-
alistically Z Y give a measure of the maximum amount of ISM
contamination in the evidently extreme case of diluting the entire
stellar mass into a vanishing residual fraction of fresh primordial
gas Accordingly Z might also be regarded as the maximum value
allowed to Zo for newly born stars
Clearly the real process that leads to ISM chemical enrich-
ment follows from a much more composite scenario being the re-
sult of a continual and subtly entangled interplay between gas and
stars inside a galaxy Tinsley 1980 Actually this is the central
subject of the many important theoretical contributions to the study
of chemical evolution of galaxies that have been succeeding along
the last few decades see eg Matteucci 2003 for an exaustive in-
troduction to the subject
Nonetheless even facing such a sophisticated reference
framework our simplied approach to chemical enrichment may
still be worth of some attention as denition of yield metallicity
provides us with a straightforward and physically inherent tool to
assess the maximum metal abundance that can be reached inside
a galaxy at any time With the study of Z Y we therefore place
a rm constrain to galaxy chemical history in terms of the experi-
enced luminosity evolution A number of interesting considerations

By combining eq 8 and 22 with eq 24 we easily obtain in
explicit form the expected AMR for different evolutionary scenar-
ios With little arithmetic recalling the Eo and Mo denitions the
AMR can eventually be set in terms of the integrated properties of
the galaxy stellar population

providing to express the reference bolometric ML ratio6 at 15 Gyr
in solar unit as from Table 1 and time t9 in Gyr7
Quite interestingly note from eq 25 that time evolution of
Z is almost insensitive to the SFR details once considering the
ML vs b inverse dependence as suggested in eq 10 This is
a not so obvious property of the relation and derives from the
nearly constant burning efciency factor F of Table 1 that con-
trasts the amount of released energy from mass processing namely
the EoMo parameter with the maximum energy allowed per unit
mass ie W in eq 8 One sees from Table 1 that F varies by
less than 20 when moving from a bursting star formation event
to a roughly constant or even increasing SFR with time This makes
both MYZ and M to scale with b in a similar way For this reason
the same aproximate Z  t14 dependence has to be expected for
a wide range of evolutionary scenarios including the case of SSP
star bursts
The SN contribution is accounted for in eq 25 by the term
Z SN  M SN
1  R as from eq 22 where its explicit age de-
pendence according to the different evolutionary regimes is con-
strained by the A  b function as in eq 23 As shown in

contribution to Z yet within the rst Gyr of the galaxy life For this
reason we can therefore safely set the SN enrichment to

obtained by different stellar samples probing the young O-
B stars and the unevolved F-G subgiant population In par-
ticular six important contributions still provide the reference
framework for
this analysis namely the work by Twarog
1980 Carlberg et al 1985 Meusinger Stecklum  Reimann
1991 Edvardsson et al 1993 Rocha-Pinto et al 2000 and
the exhaustive Geneva-Kopenhagen catalog of stars in the so-
lar neighbourhood Nordstrom et al 2004 recently revised by
Holmberg Nordstrom  Andersen 2007
Just a glance to Fig 4 makes clear the wide spread of the-
oretical predictions that span nearly a factor of 3 namely 03-
05 dex in FeH range in the expected Galaxy metallicity at a
given epoch For example newly born stars at t  10 Gyr yet
exceed the solar value in the Matteucci  Francois 1989 model
being as rich as F eH  011 this is roughly twice the value
of the Portinari Chiosi  Bressan 1998 model which predicts
on the contrary F eH  013 Instead of any further specula-
tive attempt to elect the right solution among the many envisaged
scenarios see however Romano et al 2005 for an interesting dis-
cussion on this issue we could rather look at the different theoret-
ical outputs of Fig 4 as a plain evidence of the inherent uncertainty
of any deterministic approach to Galaxy chemical evolution
It may be useful however to try a comparison between mod-
els and observations in terms of the same tting parameters by
aproximating the different AMRs with a general power-law evolu-

a potentially fast process With R  3 for instance the solar metal-
licity is quickly reached yet within the rst few Gyrs of the galaxy

current FeH predictions for these galaxies to change by much less than

Chemo-photometric evolution of spiral galaxies
As expected eq 29 shows that when fresh gas vanishes ie G 
0 then Zgas tends to Z
According to eq 28 the total ie fresh  processed gas
fraction can eventually be written as
Gtot  G  f S  G 1  f   f
Whatever the specic model assumptions about the mass recycling
mechanisms it is clear from the equation that f ends up by driving
Gtot when the fresh-gas reservoir is going to be exhausted This
happens of course at the very late stages of galaxy evolution or
Relying on this denition eq 29 can also be conveniently ar-
ranged in an alternative form such as
cid18 Zgas
Z cid19 cid18 f
Gtot cid19
1  fcid19 cid18 1  Gtot
As by denition f 6 1 a further interesting property of
eq 29 is that ZgasZ 6 S We can take advantage of this sim-
ple constraint to set two important boundary conditions to galaxy
SFR First of all as S  t1 then it must be
log Zgas  log Z  1   log t  const
The lh side of the relation or its equivalent form in terms of
FeH simply contrasts the observed AMR in the solar neighbour-
hood with the expected yield metallicity evolution of eq 25
The corresponding analytical functions for the Milky Way case
can be found in Table 4 In particular by comparying the relevant
slopes  of the FeH vs log t relations one eventually concludes
that h AMR   yieldi  1   which implies for a current age
of 13 Gyr that
b  1    04  01
The latter constraint simply derives from the fact that evi-
dently ZgasZ 6 1  G as well Therefore at any epoch
the mass fraction of fresh gas in the galaxy could at most be
G 6 1 cid18 Zgas
Z cid19

Overall once compared with the representative SFR proper-
ties of the other spiral galaxies along the Hubble morphological
sequence Roberts  Haynes 1994 these gures are consistent
with an intermediate Sb type for the Milky Way eg van der Kruit
1986 In particular according to Buzzoni 2005 the allowed
range for the SFR leads to an integrated disk color about BV

313 The returned mass fraction
10 Note that fraction f t has to be intended as the net balance of the
global amount of processed mass returned to the ISM minus the fraction
of enriched mass engaged again in later star formation processes
The exact knowledge of the way processed stellar mass is returned
to the ISM and the disaggregated contribution of the different ele-
mental species is clearly the real core of any theoretical effort aim-

ing at tracing the physical details of galaxy chemical evolution In
our straight approach this concept is fully condensed into returned
mass function f t which is the ultimate key to quantitatively
assess eq 29 The function includes in principle a formidable
wealth of input physics dealing with chemical yields for individ-
ual stars of different mass the quiescent and explosive mass-loss
properties of stars the galaxy vs external environment interplay
etc Such a wide range of ingredients and their related uncertain-
ties gives actually reason of the remarkable differences among the
Milky Way models reviewed in previous section
A very plain but still instructive approach to the problem
of ISM pollution by returned stellar mass has been investigated
by Kennicutt Tamblyn  Congdon 1994 following the classi-
cal scheme of the instantaneous gas recycling extensively prac-
ticed in the past literature see eg Larson Tinsley  Caldwell
1980 Although old-fashioned and evidently inadequate for
any detailed assessment of specic elemental abundances eg
Arimoto  Yoshii 1986 this method may however still accomo-
date although with some important renements within our analy-
sis for setting a safe upper limit to f Following the classical treat-
ment see eg Tinsley 1980 we can consider a SSP of total mass
Mtot and an IMF stellar mass range between 01 and 120 M
With these constraints the fraction of mass returned to the ISM
within the lifetime of Turn Off stars of mass mT O quanties in
2  s
m2s120

mmmsdm
This estimate requires to know the mm function
the mass amount lost by stars of initial mass m during their
Post-MS evolution so that m  m  mn Following the
Kennicutt Tamblyn  Congdon 1994 arguments we could rely
on fully empirical facts and take the observed m relation as from
the Galactic open clusters For example according to Weidemann
2000 a nice t can be obtained for stars within the range
05 M  m  8 M such as
m  0916 m  044
For higher masses if we assume that a Chandrasekhar core of
14 M is left all the way by the SN events then
m  m  14
for m  8 M With these gures the results of our calculations
are shown in Fig 6 exploring the trend of FSSP with varying SSP
age or equivalently the stellar mass marking the MS Turn Off point
of the population Note that FSSP smoothly increases with SSP age
and for a Salpeter IMF it reaches a ceiling value about FSSP 
032 after one Hubble time11
On the other hand as far as a CSP with a more entangled star-
formation history is concerned we have to expect the total fraction
of returned mass FCSPt to be the result of a convolution with
the SFR such as
FCSPt Z t
FSSP   SFR d
This leads in general to a lower value for FCSPt compared
to the corresponding SSP case In addition for a proper assess-
ment of the gas budget in the galaxy one has also to consider that
part of the returned mass is in fact to be recycled again into fresh
stars its exact amount being indeed a crucial distinctive property
of any theoretical scheme aimed at tracing galaxy chemical evo-
lution Our conclusion is therefore that in any case it must be
f t 6 FCSPt 6 FSSPt  03
32 Mixing processes and metallicity spread
One common feature of all these models however is that f t and
the physical conditions that led to establish the galaxy AMR are
univocally dened at any epoch As a consequence by denition
11 One has also to be aware however of the extreme sensitivity of this up-
per limit to the IMF power index as evident from the curve grid in Fig 6
A relevant case in this regard is that of a diet Salpeter IMF as parameter-
ized for instance by Kennicutt 1983 or Kroupa Tout  Gilmore 1993 to
better account for the observed attening in the dwarf-star number counts at
sub-solar mass By means of eq 36 one could verify that this IMF closely
traces the standard Salpeter case being however capped at a slightly higher
value of FSSP  046
Chemo-photometric evolution of spiral galaxies
while a fraction of 65 lie within F eH 6 030 dex With the
same procedure for the 412 relevant stars in the Rocha-Pinto et al
2000 sample we obtain a fraction of 97 and 84 respectively
within the same F eH limits Similar gures namely 97 and
83 respectively apply also for the 13141 eligible stars in the
Geneva-Kopenhagen calatog Allover this means that over 45 of
all newly-born stars in the solar vicinity never departed by more
than 03 dex from Z at any epoch
Facing a so tight F eH  logZZgas star distribu-
tion12 one may actually wonder why stars in the Galaxy appear
so closely tuned with the yield metallicity everytime
In spite of any more or less sophisticated approach to this cru-
cial issue just a glance to Fig 7 makes evident that the observed
range for the ZgasZ ratio univocally implies at least in the so-
lar vicinity that star formation must have proceeded within ISM
conditions characterized all the way by a scanty gas abundance
G  05 see again Fig 7
Overall this feature seems to add further strength to well
recognized non-standard scenarios where the plain dependence
of SFR on gas density like in a classical Schmidt 1959 law
might more effectively be replaced by some positive feed-back
to other triggering mechanisms either related to disk dynami-
cal properties inefcient gas mixing or molecular cloud bunching

Oey 2000 Boissier et al 2003 Scalo  Elmegreen 2004 Nittler
2005 van Zee  Haynes 2006
A further interesting piece of information can be added to the
emerging scenario when probing the F eH distribution at dif-
ferent Galactocentric distance This can be done for instance by
relying on Carraro Ng  Portinari 1998 who collected homoge-
nous data for a set of 37 open clusters The evident advantage in
this case is that age and metallcity can be derived in a more direct
way based on the observed c-m diagram of the whole stellar mem-
bers of each cluster13 The Carraro Ng  Portinari 1998 results
are reported in the lower panel of Fig 8 marking the cluster dis-
tance from Galaxy center with a different dot size ie the closer
the cluster the bigger its marker
The local properties of disk metallicity are consistently traced
also by the open cluster population whith a clear additional evi-
dence however for less pronounced chemical enhancement pro-
cesses in the most peripheral stellar systems for which a systemat-
ically larger departure from Z is displayed in Fig 8
321 The G-dwarf problem
In its essence the tuned distribution of the F eH parame-
ter as in previous discussion has much to do with the classical
G-dwarf problem van den Bergh 1962 Pagel  Patchett 1975
Twarog 1980 that is an evident lack nowadays in the FeH
or log Z domain of the desired population of extremely metal-
decient unevolved stars reminiscent of the earliest evolutionary
phases of the disk formation in the Galaxy
12 Strictly speaking for its delayed supply to the ISM Iron may not be a
fair proxy of the whole metallicity among very metal-poor ie pristine
stars in the Galaxy see the following Sec 322 for a most explicit assess-
ment of this issue This assumption carries therefore some uncertanties for
stars within t  1 Gyr in the plots of Fig 8

remark
Figure 7 The output of eq 29 is displayed vs the mass fraction of fresh
primordial gas G The two shelves of curves assume the fraction f of
returned stellar mass as a free parameter The lower shelf dashed curves
is for f  001  009 by steps of f  002 while the upper shelf of
curves solid lines cover the f range from 01 to 03 by steps of f  01
The shaded area within 03 6 logZgasZ 6 0 single out the allowed
f-G combinations that may account for the observed metallicity spread of
stars in the solar neighborhood
no spread in FeH is envisaged by theory among coeval stars
throughout On the other hand observations of unevolved nearby
stars clearly point to some degree of metallicity dispersion perhaps
slightly amplied by observational uncertainties and the adopted
agemetallicity classication procedure Rocha-Pinto et al 2000
For example by relying on the Edvardsson et al 1993 survey we
derive F eH  023 dex from the distribution of the individual
stars around the mean AMR locus This is about twice the typi-
cal value originally found by Twarog 1980 and can be contrasted
with F eH  016 dex as obtained for the Rocha-Pinto et al
2000 stars or with F eH  018 dex displayed by the
Holmberg Nordstrom  Andersen 2007 extended star sample
Whether this spread is really the general case for spiral galaxies is
a still open and debated question eg Koeppen  Arimoto 1990
Wyse 2006 Prantzos 2008
Again the envisaged Z evolution can help we believe to set
some interesting constraints to this problem as well Following
eq 29 Fig 7 summarizes the expected response of the ZgasZ
ratio to just the two reference parameters that modulate galaxy
chemical evolution in our framework namely G and f When re-
garded into a broader context our plot displays expected relationa-
ship of the global mass fraction of fresh gas in the galaxy Alterna-
tively this macro view can be complemented by a micro view
being the G parameter intended as the local gas density of star-
forming regions such as G  gastot and featuring therefore
the specic mixing conditions that embed star formation One sees
from the gure that in principle a wide range a few dex may
be allowed to Zgas at every epochs as coeval stars could naturally
spread in the plot along an f  const locus in consequence of the
micro-environment conditions proper to the different star-forming
regions inside a galaxy
The Edvardsson et al 1993 Rocha-Pinto et al 2000 and
Holmberg Nordstrom  Andersen 2007 star samples offer once
more an important feedback in this regard as shown in Fig 8 For
the rst sample 161 stars are nominally younger than 13 Gyr the
assumed age of the Milky Way the overall statistics of their indi-
vidual F eH  F eHyield  F eH distribution indicates
that 88 of the stars are comprised within F eH 6 050 dex

According to our SFR parameterization for b  04 an ex-
pected fraction of  50 10615 109b  10 of G-dwarf stars
should have produced in the disk of our galaxy within the lapse
t  50 Myr of the rst type-II SN burst According to Fig 2
for these stars a metallicity as poor as F eH  110 should be
expected The lack nowadays of such a relevant population of vir-
tually zero-metal stars is actually the central issue that led theo-
rists in the late 80s to invoke a composite formation for the Galaxy
disk through a buffering dynamical mechanism that led rst to
the formation of an outer thin disk followed by an innerthick
structure Gilmore  Wyse 1986 Ferrini et al 1992
Translated into a linear metallicity scale the undersized pop-
ulation of stars with F eH  1 can be matched by a roughly
uniform star density along the Z range so that dNdZ

the expected yield-metallicity distribution accounting for the different star-
formation histories as for the disk stellar population of Buzzoni 2005 tem-
plate galaxies along the Hubble sequence solid curves as labelled on the
plot A roughly constant stellar distribution in the Z domain leads to an
implied birthrate of the order of b  06 as pertinent to Sbc galaxies see
Table 2 for a reference
const see in this regard Pagel 1989 and especially the work
of Beers Preston  Shectman 1985 1992 Sommer-Larsen 1991

The stellar metallicity distribution can easily be related with
the other distinctive properties of galaxy evolution in our frame-
work as
dNZ
dNt
dt  dZ
The rst term in the rh side of the equation is of course propor-
tional to the SFR  t while the second term is simply the
time derivative of the observed AMR  t1 By replacing the
relevant relations we have
 t1  Z1 
dNZ
dF eH
 10F eH1
if one better likes to put the relation in terms of FeH For a
roughly constant dNdZ distribution it must be 1      0
or   b According to Table 4 for a current age of 13 Gyr this
implies that G-dwarf distribution may be reproduced by a Galaxy
birthrate of
b  06  01
A graphical sketch of our conclusions is proposed in Fig 9
by comparing the G-dwarf stellar sample of the Galaxy disk by
Rocha-Pinto  Maciel 1996 and Nordstrom et al 2004 with the
expected metallicity distribution as obtained by applying eq 42
for a range of SFR representative of the spiral-galaxy sequence in
the Buzzoni 2005 template galaxy models Note that Milky Way
observations closely match the standard case of the SbSc morpho-
logical types see Table 2
To a better analysis however we have to remark the somewhat
marginal value of b when compared to our previous conclusions
as the tight relationship between Galaxy AMR and Z trend rather
called for a lower gure ie b  04 This apparent dichotomy
actually summarizes the full essence of the G-dwarf problem em-
phasizing from one hand the central role of the early stellar com-
ponent in constraining the Galaxy AMR but requiring on the other
hand for these stars to be born elsewhere ie in the halo or in
the thin disk
322 The -element versus Iron-peak enrichment
A further implication of the simple energetic arguments outlined
in Sec 2 is that metal enrichment should have proceeded selec-
tively in the very early stages of Galaxy evolution according to
the composite interplay between quiescent luminosity evolution
of stars and violent action of SNe In fact bright stars are to be
regarded as the elective suppliers of lighter pre-Carbon elements
while SNeII further add to the synthesis of the -element chain es-
pecially providing Oxygen and heavier metals Woosley  Weaver
1995 For their different physical conditions SNeIa are meant on
the contrary to be the prevailing donors of Fe and other Iron-peak
elements Nomoto Thielemann  Yokoi 1984 to the galaxy ISM
Given the delayed appearence of SNIa one has to expect
 elements and Oxygen in particular to cumulate earlier than
Iron-peak elements into ISM of the Milky Way This feature di-
rectly calls therefore for some O-Fe decoupling among the low-
metallicity stellar component of our galaxy A positive OF e
relative abundance is actually a widely recognized property when
comparing halo and disk stars and the effect is a supplementary
piece of evidence dealing with the G-dwarf problem previously dis-
cussed The study of the OF e vs F eH relationship in the
local framework prove therefore to set important constraints to the
different feeding channels that eventually led to Z enrichment in
the Galaxy
We can further explore this issue by relying on our model to
compare the expected OF e evolution with the observed trend
for the Galaxy stars The work of Pagel  Tautvaisiene 1995
and Scannapieco  Bildsten 2005 can be taken as useful ref-
erences to set the relevant quantities for F e and O yields in
Type Ia and II SNe Accordingly we assume a typical abun-
dance of OF eII  050 dex for the released mass by
SNeII and OF eI  151 dex for the SNIa case being
logOF e  133 dex the reference gure in number abun-
dance for the Sun Grevesse  Sauval 1998 In addition with
Scannapieco  Bildsten 2005 we take a ratio r  mII
F e  0062  074 for the released Iron yields according
to the SN type14
14 As Iron is the main output of any SNIa explosion
its yield
must obey an inherent argument of energetic self-consistency being

ures of Sec 222 we actually have that mIa

acording to the Jonsell et al 2005 diamonds and Edvardsson et al
1993 dots data samples respectively for the halo and disk stellar popu-
lations Our model output according to eq 46 is superposed solid lines
for a representative birthrate b  04 and for a range of SNIa delay time 
from  50 Myr to  1 Gyr as discussed in Sec 22
Equations 13 16 and 20 can still accomodate for our cal-
culations providing to replace the E51 1051WSN M energy-
release term with the relevant chemical yields Recalling our SFR
parameterization and the notation of Sec 22 the total mass re-
leased by Type II and Ia SNe for the element X can be expressed
mX  mXII  mXI Bt  b
where Bt  b is a function of age t and stellar birthrate b
and accounts for the SNIa delay time  Like for eq 23 pre-
viously discussed an analytical form can be devised also for this
function providing to express  in years such as
Bt  b

For the OF e relative abundance we have therefore
F ecid21  log
cid20 O
r 10OF eII  B 10OF eI
Note from eq 46 that B  0 for t   which implies that ISM
OF e abundance simply coincides with the SNII relative yields at
the very early evolutionary stages of the Galaxy Iron enrichement
is obviously favored by increasing B in the equation This naturally
happens when getting the Galaxy older that is by increasing  
andor by decreasing the SNIa delay time 
Our results are sketched in Fig 10 comparing with the obser-
vation of disk and halo stars respectively from Edvardsson et al
1993 and Jonsell et al 2005 In the gure a safe lower and
upper envelope to the observed OF e stellar distribution can
be placed for   50 Myr and 1 Gyr respectively This
range also consistently comprises the claimed glitch in the
OF e vs F eH trend ideally located about F eH  1
in close agreement with the standard model predictions see eg
Nomoto Thielemann  Yokoi 1984 their model W7
A Buzzoni
Clegg Tomkin  Lambert 1981 Our output therefore conrms
that most of the SNIa impact on the Galaxy metal enrichment
should have occurred very early within the rst Gyr of life al-
though just a glance to the data of Fig 10 indicates that some 108 yr
may have required for the SNIa process to fully deploy within the
Galaxy stellar environment This conclusion is supported indeed
by the empirical arguments of Maoz Sharon Gal-Yam 2010
and the theoretical ones by Greggio 2005 and Kobayashi et al
1998
4 CHEMO-PHOTOMETRIC PROPERTIES ALONG THE
HUBBLE MORPHOLOGICAL SEQUENCE
Our quite special lookout inside the Galaxy makes the study of our
system certainly favored but at the same time also subtly biased
compared to the analysis of external galaxies From one hand in
fact we can directly adress the problem of Galaxy metallicity
in terms of the aggregated information from individual stars in the
solar neighborhood on the other hand the criterion to dene the
star sample either by xed space volume or apparent magnitude
limit or even selected spectral type etc may play a crucial role
in driving our conclusions as the representative metallicity value
would eventually depend on the way we account for the contribu-
tion of individual stars This is a subtantial difference with respect
to the study of distant galaxies for which we usually cannot re-
solve individual stars at all In the latter case one should forcedly
rely on the integrated spectrophotometric properties of the system
as a whole to derive somewhat effective distinctive parameters
to constrain galaxy properties
41 Matching the Arimoto  Jablonka 1991 theoretical
framework
From the theoretical side our general view of disk chemical prop-
erties along the Hubble morphological sequence may usefully com-
plement the analysis of AJ91 certainly one of the few explicit at-
tempts in the recent literature to self-consistently tackle the prob-
lem of chemo-photometric evolution of late-type galaxies see in
addition also Arimoto  Yoshii 1986 1987 Koeppen  Arimoto
1990 to complete the theoretical picture A rst interesting com-
parison in this regard is proposed in Fig 11 where the gas metal-
licity logZgasZ for the 15 Gyr AJ91 disk models along the
Sa  Sd sequence is displayed together with the relevant values of
our yield metallicity logZZ
For its different IMF limits stars are produced between 005
and 60 M the AJ91 stellar populations are slightly darker that
is with a larger ML ratio for their larger fraction of dwarf stars
and with a less prominent contribution  20 of SNe to galaxy
metal enrichment These differences with respect to our theoretical
scheme become more important when moving along the Sa  Sd
sequence as stars of increasingly higher mass prevail as contribu-
tors to galaxy luminosity
In spite of the different input physics one has to remark how-
ever a notable agreement in the FeH predictions as shown in
Fig 11 The case of Sa models is illustrative in this sense as
the vanishing residual gas only 4 of the total disk mass in the
AJ91 model makes Zgas to closely approach Z as expected Once
accounting for the increasing fraction of residual gas along the
morphological galaxy sequence the prediction of eq 31 tightly
matches the AJ91 output Facing the relatively at trend of Z
vs galaxy type it is evident from the gure that the increasingly
Figure 11 The gas metallicity of 15 Gyr disk stellar populations accord-
ing to the Arimoto  Jablonka 1991 AJ91 models solid line with dia-
monds is displayed together with the expected predictions from eq 31
shaded area for a range of returned mass fraction f between 007 and 03
as labelled on the plot For tighter self-consistency in our comparison the
adopted gas fraction Gtot for our model sequence matches the correspond-
ing gures of AJ91 models while yield metallicity derives from eq 27 for
the relevant birthrate values of the Buzzoni 2005 template models along
the SaIm morphological sequence solid line with dots
poorer gas metallicity along the Sa  Im Hubble sequence is in
fact mainly the result of the diluting process that shares enriched
stellar mass with a larger fraction of residual gas
Interestingly enough in the quite delicate balancing mecha-
nism that governs the FeH trend vs Hubble type the exact de-
tails of stellar mass return processes do play a somewhat marginal
role This is evident for instance by comparing in Fig 11 the effect
of changing the return mass fraction f from its allowed maximum
f  03 down to a factor of four lower value f  007 Rather
the amount of fresh residual gas that survived past star formation
seems a much more central gure to modulate the enrichment pro-
cess and this directly calls for the distinctive birthrate b as the ulti-
mate parameter to constrain disk metallicity We will further return
in more detail on this important point in a moment see Sec 43
42 Chemical vs photometric metallicity estimates
Due to the coexisting contribution of gas and stars inside a spi-
ral galaxy any fair estimate of galaxy metallicity is a far more
entangled problem Quoting Roberts  Haynes 1994 intercom-
parison between abundances based on emission lines from HII re-
gions and on absorption lines and colors from a stellar population
is still uncertain Atomic processes guide emission-line analysis
while the absorption lines must be evaluated in terms of both the
composite stellar population and the metallicity
From the observational point of view the inherent difculty in
disentangling the genuine metallicity effects on the color properties
of late-type galaxies has greatly favored the alternative approach
relying on the study of HII regions as effective proxies of disk
metallicity see eg Peimbert Rayo  Torres-Peimbert 1978

Boselli et al 2001 In this framework one remarkable effort
toward a photometric approach to the metallicity problem is the
work of Perez Sanchez-Blazquez  Zurita 2009 providing
Lick-index measurements of stellar populations in barred spirals
An instructive summary of observational galaxy diagnostics
is proposed in Fig 12 where the performance of both chemical
HII regions and photometric Lick indices from the aggregated
stellar population methods is compared for a set of spirals along
the full Hubble sequence To the theoretical pattern of Fig 11 re-
poted as a guideline we superposed the metallicity estimates for the
galaxy set of Zaritsky Kennicutt  Huchra 1994 square mark-
ers and for the Perez Sanchez-Blazquez  Zurita 2009 S0a
sample triangles As usual the original gas metallicity in the
Zaritsky Kennicutt  Huchra 1994 galaxies is given in terms of
OH abundance so that two variants of the gure can be devised
depending whether we plainly assume Oxygen to trace global
metallicity so that OH  F eH as in lower panel of the g-
ure or perhaps more realistically whether decoupled -element
enrichment should be considered to rescale chemical abundance
upper panel as we have been discussing in previous section In
the latter case from different sources Clegg Tomkin  Lambert
1981 Bessell Sutherland  Ruan 1991 Edvardsson et al 1993
we set OH  06F eH
Compared with the theoretical predictions it is evident from
Fig 12 that any empirical effort to constrain metallicity in spiral
galaxies still suffers from very high uncertainty This is especially
evident for the HII measurements of Zaritsky Kennicutt  Huchra
1994 where point scatter is actually comparable to the claimed
internal error of individual measurements Apparently this does
not seem to be the case for the Perez Sanchez-Blazquez  Zurita
2009 Lick data although the important point-to-point spread casts
evident doubts on the nominal accuracy claimed for the individ-
ual FeH estimates Denitely we believe that a F eH 
05 dex might be regarded as a realistic gure for current empir-
ical either chemical or photometric estimates of metal abun-
dance in late-type galaxy disks
Once considering in more detail the overlapping range of mor-
phological types between the two galaxy samples in Fig 12 it is
interesting to note that photometric metallicity estimates appear
to be systematically lower than chemical estimates According to
our previous arguments this can be seen as an eloquent example
of biased sampling criteria in fact by probing gas metallicity
we retrieve the current status of galaxy chemical enrichment while
through spectrophotometric Lick indices we are probing the galaxy
stellar population averaging along the entire range of age of lu-
minous stars
43 Mass morphology  birthrate which drives galaxy
metallicity
Although morphological classication is the most immediate tool
for a quick-look characterization of galaxy properties it has been
long questioned whether morphology univocally seats on intrin-
sic physical properties of the galaxy system as a whole This is
especially true for late-type galaxies where the prominent spiral
pattern actually involves a relatively small fraction of the galax-
ian total mass As extensively discussed in the literature along the
latest decades Whitford 1962 Roberts  Haynes 1994 Kennicutt
1998 the combined analysis of the galaxy leading properties led
to a number of established correlations between primary physical

from Fig 11 While the Perez Sanchez-Blazquez  Zurita 2009 esti-
mates derive from Lick indices tracing the galaxy stellar population in case
of Zaritsky Kennicutt  Huchra 1994 the F eH derives from the Oxy-
gen abundance of galaxy HII regions by adopting logOH  883 for
the Sun Grevesse  Sauval 1998 Two cases are envisaged in this regard
assuming that Oxygen straightly traces Iron and the full metallicity as in
lower panel or more realistically that a scale conversion does exist such as
OH  06 F eH as suggested by the observation of disk stars in the
Milky Way Clegg Tomkin  Lambert 1981 Bessell Sutherland  Ruan
1991 Edvardsson et al 1993 A little random scatter has been added to
the morphological T class of the points in each panel for better reading
parameters the most popular one being by far the Tully  Fisher
1977 TF relation
On the other hand the obvious reference role of galaxy lumi-
nosity as in the TF relation can easily be replaced by galaxy stellar
mass especially once focussing on galaxy photometric properties
in the mid infrared range as convincingly demonstrated by Gavazzi
1993 All these different pieces of evidence led eventually to iden-
tify galaxy stellar mass as one of the leading parameters that
may intimately mark the life and fate of the spiral systems as a
whole Tully Mould  Aaronson 1982
In this framework the recent ultraviolet study by Marino et al
2010 may add further interesting arguments to this composite sce-
nario These authors collected GALEX observations of three spiral-
rich aggregates from the Lyon Groups of Galaxies LGG Garcia
1993 For their galaxy population these groups can be regarded
as close analogs of the Local Group displaying a quite clean
sample of relatively unperturbed objects seen at comparable dis-
tances and covering the whole Hubble morphological sequence
While GALEX data allow us to explicitely assess current SFR in
these galaxies the match with long-wavelength magnitudes pro-
vide on the contrary a more direct hint of the amount of stellar
mass through the appropriate ML conversion ratio
As a rst step of our analysis galaxy internal extinction has

Internal reddening appears to be quite high in the UV bands
with the galaxies loosing typically 2-3 mag at 1500 A a g-
ure which is consistent with the more exhaustive studies of
Rifatto Longo  Capaccioli 1995 and Gordon Calzetti  Witt
1997 Once accounted for reddening and distance UV abso-
lute luminosities directly translate into actual SFRo16 while ab-
solute B magnitude can eventually relate to galaxy stellar mass

acteristic birthrate can also be computed from our data as b

The results of our analysis are collected in Table 5 and sum-
marized in Fig 13 Just as a reference in each panel of the gure we
also reported the typical error gures of the data see the ellipses in
each plot in particular we estimate a 02 dex uncertainty on the
inferred value of log SFRo mainly as a consequence of the inher-
ent uncertainty on the value of  and a 02 dex uncertainty for
the derived galaxy mass accounting for the reddening uncertainty
and ML calibrationThis eventually leads to a  log b  03 dex
for our birthrate estimates
From both plots a nice correlation   086 is in place be-
tween star-formation properties and galaxy stellar mass Indeed
the agreement might even be better if one could compare consis-
tently with the disk stellar mass alone17

gal the deviation from the one-to-one slope implies a depen-
dence of the birthrate on the galaxy mass such as
b  M 044
as conrmed indeed by the point distribution in the lower panel
In its essence the inverse correlation of birthrate with galaxy mass
closely deals with the nowadays recognized effect of down-sizing
Cowie et al 1996 Gavazzi Pierini  Boselli 1996 the imposing
paradigm in theory of galaxy formation
The claimed link with galaxy morphology is another issue to
be considered of course In this case however a poorer correla-
tion   059 readily appears for the same data as far as the
SFRo distribution versus the RC3 classication type T is dealt
with This is partly in consequence of a less tuned relationship be-
tween galaxy mass and morphological type as shown in Fig 14
In addition to the Marino et al 2010 galaxies we also joined
to the gure the sample of standard spirals studied by Garnett
2002 complemented by the low-surface brightness galaxy sam-
ple of Kuzio de Naray McGaugh  de Blok 2004 and the dI
collection by Saviane et al 2008 For the different sets of data
we derived M 
gal with a similar procedure as for the Marino et al
2010 data namely based on the integrated B for Garnett 2002
and Kuzio de Naray McGaugh  de Blok 2004 and H luminos-
ity for Saviane et al 2008 respectively Again a global t to the
data can be adjusted tentatively in the form
T  101 cid0M

While the general trend is evident from the data   083
one could easily verify that any attempt to use eq49 for pre-
dicting galaxy morphology based on the mass alone is a nearly
17 While the UV emission mainly traces star formation activity in the
galaxy disk our stellar mass derives on the contrary from the integrated
B magnitudes thus including the bulge photometric contribution For this
reason especially for Sab spirals the value of log M 
gal may be overesti-
mating the disk mass up to a factor of  4 cf Table 3 of Buzzoni 2005
thus leading also to a correspondingly lower value of b

The upper panel of the gure shows the somewhat un-

tion of fresh gas must still be available at present time Actu-
ally one may even speculate that such a delayed mass process-
ing is in fact the natural explanation also of the low-metallicity
gures that characterize all the way the dwarf-galaxy population
in the Universe Arimoto  Tarrab 1990 Lee Grebel  Hodge
2003 This scenario seems to nd direct support once exploring
as in the upper panel of Fig 16 HII metallicity over the whole
range of galaxy mass for instance by extending again the Garnett
2002 sequence for standard spirals with the low-mass samples
of Kuzio de Naray McGaugh  de Blok 2004 and Saviane et al
2008 see also Table 6
On the other hand a far more instructive experiment can be
carried out with the help of eq 31 Facing a change of the refer-
ence value for the gas fraction Gtot the equation allows us to com-
pute the induced change in the value of Zgas by accounting for the
different ISM dilution factor Accordingly the observed gas metal-
licity could easily be rescaled to any other reference value of Gref
starting from the observed value of Gobs As far as the HII metallic-
ity is considered the expected offset to the observed OH abun-
dance can therefore be written as
OH  logcid18 1  Gref
Gtot cid19 
Gref cid19  logcid18 1  Gtot

quest in the extragalactic debate about the role of primordial gene-
sis and the environment nurture to modulate galaxy morphology

can eventually rescale galaxy metallicity to the same reference

effect of processed mass on the ISM

As discussed in Sec 21 the rate at which the mass is chemically
enriched inside a galaxy follows a sort of universal law calcula-
tions show in fact that the burning efciency factor F see Table 1
is nearly insensitive to the galaxy star formation history At present
about 11  2 of the processed mass in galaxies has been con-
verted into heavy elements and according to eq 8 the process
may go ahead for a supplementary factor of 0111023  104

being Gtot and f evaluated at the current Hubble time After a
tR time the so-called Roberts time Roberts 1963 star forma-
tion can only proceed further in a galaxy at cost of exploiting its
own processed mass Since long the problem of a realistic esti-
mate of the Roberts timescale has been investigated Sandage 1986
Kennicutt Tamblyn  Congdon 1994 leading to the quite puz-
zling conclusion that tR may not substantially depart from one
Hubble time As a consequence present-day galaxies might be
all on the verge of exhausting their own gas resources To over-
come this somewhat embarassing conclusion it has been empha-
sized that after all even at time tR a galaxy is not completely gas
depleted still counting on a residual buffer Mgas  f M

cessed mass see eq 31 still rich in Hydrogen and able in princi-
ple to sustain galaxy SFR for the Gyrs to come Kennicutt 1998
We can take advantage of our original approach to galaxy
chemo-photometric evolution to attempt a more condent assess-
ment of the Roberts time also in its extended denition tRe
such as to account for the extra-time provided by processed-
mass recycling First of all according to its standard denition
the value of tR can easily be computed with our data along the
different galaxy mass by means of eq 50 Once getting the
value of Mgas from the tting equation it is immediate to derive

is in place with galaxy stellar mass where low-mass systems appear richer
in gas see Fig 15 and poorer in metals Once accounting for the differ-
ent gas fraction among the galaxies and rescale Oxygen abundance to the
same gas fraction Gtot  02 as in the indicative example displayed in
gal trend is recovered
the lower panel note that most of the OH vs M 
leaving a nearly at OH distribution along the entire galaxy mass range

ish even inside stars and a maximum metallicity Zmax has to be
reached by the system for 1  RZmax  1  Yp In terms of
the solar gures galaxy chemical evolution will eventually end up
Ymax Zmax  3 Y 10 Z
On the other hand much earlier than the full process comple-
tion other outstanding events could mark the chemical history of
a galaxy In particular if one recalls that S  tb and takes the
Hubble time tH as a reference then the expected evolution of the
fresh-gas content in the disk scales as

If we set G  0 and recall eq 30 then the timescale for the galaxy
to consume its primordial-gas reservoir is
19 Curiously enough the matter annihilation that accompanies nuclear
burning processes may also result in the long term in a not quite negli-
gible effect for the total mass budget of a galaxy Previous gures show
for instance that the Milky Way has already lost in luminosity about one
thousandth ie a factor of 011  00078 see footnote 2 of its total mass
This is roughly the equivalent mass of the whole globular-cluster system
currently surrounding our galaxy

again with Gtot and f referring to the boundary conditions of
present-day galaxies see Fig 17 Two important conclusions can
be drawn from the analysis of these results
i For any realistic assumption about the returned mass frac-
tion most of the galaxies more massive than  1011 M have
tR  tH As a consequence they may already have exceeded their
Roberts time being their current SFR mainly driven by processed
mass rather than by primordial gas According to the morphology
vs mass relationship see again Fig 14 this seems to be the case
for most of SaSb spirals in the present-day Universe
ii When explicitely included in the gas budget the processed-
mass contribution certainly adds supplementary chances to high-
mass spirals for continuing their star formation activity for a few
Gyrs However the relative life extension is critically constrained
by the balance of the two antagonic processes of mass return
f and mass consumption b In absolute terms eq 55 shows
that the extended Roberts time tRe is eventually driven by the
down-sizing mechanism which constrains the b vs mass rela-
tionship The conclusion is that only a marked reduction of the
present brithrate might allow spirals to sustain star formation far
beyond one Hubble time In any case only a negligible bonus
is awarded to low-mass systems namely to SdIm galaxies less
massive than  1011 M For them in fact we denitely have
tRe  tR  tH and just a couple of Gyrs at most still seem to be
left ahead
5 SUMMARY  CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we tried an alternative approach to the study of chemo-
photometric properties of late-type galaxies Following previous
theoretical efforts in this sense eg Pagel 1997 our analysis relies
on a basic criterion of energetic self consistency between chemical
enhancement of galaxy mass through nuclear processing and the
corresponding luminosity evolution of the system
This plain physical constraint provides us with a brand new
interpretative tool as nearly all the leading theoretical codes along
the last decades rather approached the problem of galaxy chemi-
cal evolution in terms of the sum of individual elemental contri-
butions see eg Tinsley 1980 This required in other words to
explicitely account for the chemical yields supplied by stars along
the different range of mass Clearly this analytical approach is
the unescapable way when we want to trace the specic enrich-
ment history of single chemical elements On the other hand as
far as the global metallicity of a stellar aggregate is concerned the
analytical process risks to carry along and magnify the combined
uncertainty from stellar evolution theory making the emerging pic-
ture to strongly depend on the model assumptions often through a
plethora of free tunable parameters
On the contrary in any synthetic approach galaxy chemi-
cal evolution derives from other primary physical constraints The
works of Schmidt 1963 and Pagel  Patchett 1975 are two out-
standing examples in this sense assessing the chemical history of
a stellar system as an implied consequence of its star-formation
law As a further variant on this line our reasoning takes the move
from the fact that a xed amount of energy must always be re-
leased when matter is chemically enhanced through nuclear pro-
cessing inside stars Theoretical nucleosynthesis predicts in fact
that 698 1018 ergs are produced see Sec 2 for each gram of Hy-
drogen to be converted to heavier elements through non-explosive
burning processes A further amount of 103 1018 ergs per gram
should then be added if we want to account for the explosive nu-
cleosynthesis dealing with the SN events Overall it is clear that
a tight relationship has therefore to be expected between chemical
enhancement of a galaxy and its past photometric history
The theoretical fundamentals which provide the reference
framework for our analysis have been discussed in Sec 2 In par-
ticular we rely on the Buzzoni 1989 1995 original code for
stellar population synthesis further elaborated to build up three-
zone galaxy templates along the Hubble morphological squence
Buzzoni 2002 2005 For its special relevance within the global
properties of late-type systems our study is mainly focussed on the
disk evolution which broadly marks the macroscopic look of spiral
and irregular galaxies The standard scenario of the present calcu-
lations considers a Salpeter IMF with stars formed within a mass
range between 01 and 120 M In addition metals and Helium
proceed from processed stellar mass assuming a xed enrichment
ratio R  3 as discussed in Sec 23
Following Buzzoni 2005 an important assumption of our
models is that stellar birthrate is a distinctive property of galaxy
morphology and mass the latter in force of the observed T -M 
relationship as shown in Fig 14 Consistently with the down-
sizing scenario for galaxy formation Cowie et al 1996 b is there-
fore seen to decrease in our models with increasing M 
gal Gavazzi
1993 As a consequence SFR scales with time according to a
power law and it is not directly coupled to the mean gas density
of the disk as imposed on the contrary by other classical schemes
Schmidt 1959
Chemical enhancement inside a galaxy is effectively assessed
by the burning efciency factor as displayed in eq 8 of Sec 21
Table 1 reports a notable property of F being it nearly insensitive
to the galaxy star formation history Along a full range of possible
evolutionary scenarios in fact we always end up at present time
with F  011  002 This means in other words that within
just small 20 individual differences galaxies performed very
similarly everywhere in the Universe as efcient engines for ener-
getic exploitation of the barionic matter through nuclear synthesis
Accordingly at any epoch we can univocally dene a reference g-
ure that we called yield metallicity Z see eq 24 in Sec 23
which traces the mean composition of the stellar mass
The role of SNe in the more general context of disk chemical
evolution has been assessed in some detail in Sec 22 A compar-
ison of the energetic budget involved in quiescent and explosive
nucleosynthesis indicates that SNe are extremely powerful mass
processors for xed amount of released energy in fact they burn
a factor of seven more mass than normal stars Following yet
classical arguments eg Matteucci  Greggio 1986 we know that
the component of high-mass stars M  5 M enables a very
quick chemical enrichment during early evolution of galaxies This
Chemo-photometric evolution of spiral galaxies
prompt chemical enhancement is the result of the explosion of
both core-collapsed objects in the form of type II SNe and ac-
creted WDs as a result of binary interactions like in type Ia SNe
Yield metallicity is therefore abruptly raised to log Z  3
on a timescale of a few 107 yrs a gure that further increases by
 015 dex within the rst Gyr of galaxy life see Fig 2 As by
denition the cumulative action of prompt SNeII and Ia must be
proportional to the galaxy stellar mass M 
gal the net effect of their
contribution is to set a steady offset that we quantied in Sec 32
in F eH  110 dex to galaxy yield metallicity
In this framework for a Salpeter IMF the implied yield
metallicity evolves as Z  t023 see eq 25 For the previ-
ous arguments this can be seen as a nearly universal law only
marginally dependent on the galaxy birthrate see for instance
Fig 3 An immediate consequence of this important property
is that IMF rather than SFR is the key player to set metallic-
ity at primeval epochs when t  0 and SNe were governing
chemical evolution eg Scannapieco Schneider  Ferrara 2003
In particular non-Salpeter stellar populations strongly biased to-
ward high-mass stars as in a atter IMF have to be invoked to t
with the peculiar presence of bright super-solar galaxies at high
redshift as sometimes observed eg Maiolino et al 2006 and
also envisaged by some updated theoretical schemes see for in-
stance the interesting explorations of Kroupa  Weidner 2003 and
Koppen Weidner  Kroupa 2007 Figure 1 is an illustrative ex-
ample of this mechanism when tracing the contribution of SNeII to
metal enhancement with varying the IMF power-law index
A major advantage of taking yield metallicity as a reference
marker in our analysis is that Z can easily be related to other key
physical processes that constrain galaxy chemical evolution in its
different facets The ISM metal enrichment is an evident example
in this sense Chemical composition of the gaseous phase inside
a galaxy is the resulting balance of two basic mechanisms From
one hand one should carefully consider the bulk of processed mass
returned by stars to the ISM through SN events and quiescent stellar
wind On the other hand this input has to be properly assessed in
the physical context of dynamical evolution of the disk such as
to trace the way processed mass is eventually diluted within the
fresh primordial gas
In tackling the problem Sec 31 we tried to maintain our
formal treatment as much as possible free from any ab initio
assumptions that might bias our conclusions The returned mass
ow is therefore dealt with in eq 28 in terms of the parameterized
fraction f t of net stellar mass returned to the ISM within the
time t see footnote 10 In our notation this component is always
traced separately from the primordial gas component Gt so that
the global gas amount in the disk comes throughout as a sum of the
two nominal contributions as in eq 30 In its formal elaboration
see eq 29 and 31 the ISM metallicity Zgas can eventually be
set in terms of yield metallicity and derives from just two leading
parameters namely G and f see Fig 7 For the latter a safe upper
limit has been placed such as f  03 at any age for a Salpeter
IMF according to a full discussion of the SSP case as in Sec 313
The case of the Milky Way must be the obvious and preem-
inent testbed for our theoretical framework In particular the ex-
pected evolution of the yield metallicity is compared in Fig 4
with the observed AMR as traced by different stellar samples in
the solar neighborhood By denition at every epoch Z caps the
value of the ISM metallicity and therefrom edges the composition
of newly formed stars As discussed in Sec 31 the study of the
F eH  logZgasZ difference is richful of important infor-
mation to constrain the Galaxy star formation history We have been
able for instance to set a rm upper limit to the Galaxy birthrate
such as b  05 see eq 33 while the current contribution of the
primordial gas cannot exceed roughly one-third of the local mass
density of the disk see eq 35 A further boundary condition can
also be posed to the chemical enrichment ratio that must be R  5
A similar comparison performed between analytical model
predictions from several reference codes in the literature and ob-
served AMR is summarized in Fig 5 The broad range of envis-
aged scenarios predicted by theory leads to a spread of up to 05 dex
in the value of stellar F eH at a given age We want to look at
this gure as a measure of the intrinsic limit of theory to master
the combined interplay among the many leading mechanisms that
modulate chemical evolution To a closer analysis however it has
to be recognized a clear tendency of models to predict a sharper
chemical evolution of Galaxy disk such as to exceed in most cases
the observed stellar metallicity at the present epoch Evidently the
shallower enrichment rate indicated by the observations points to
a still unsettled problem with the primeval steps of disk evolution
and more specically with the pre-enrichment processes related to
the well known G-dwarf problem It is interesting to see in this
regard that when the observed stellar F eH distribution is ex-
plicitely dealt with in our analysis as in Sec 321 the implied
birthrate b  06  01 tends to oversize the corresponding gure
derived from the AMR Such a more delayed star formation is in
fact a sign for primeval stars to have formed elsewhere alias in
the thin disk as claimed by the standard established scenario
An outstanding dyscrasia of any theoretical scheme for Galaxy
chemical evolution is that no spread in F eH can be admitted
among coeval stars populating the same region of the system be-
ing the AMR univocally settled by the boundary physical condi-
tions of the model This is evidently at odds with what we observe
at least in the solar neighborhood where an intrinsic F eH up
to 02 dex seems an unquestionable feature for the local stellar pop-
ulation see Fig 8 As an important consequence of the metal dis-
persion one may actually conclude that disregarding age about
four out of ve stars in the solar vicinity approach the expected
yield metallicity within a factor of two When interpreted in terms
of mixing properties between enriched and primordial gas such a
tuned distribution clearly demonstrates that star formation in the
Galaxy only proceeded all the time in a highly contaminated en-
vironment This claim can be better quantied by means of Fig 7
which conrms that the processed stellar mass returned to the ISM
must in fact be the prevailing component to gas density in star-
forming regions if we want F eH of fresh stars at any epoch to
closely match ie within F eH  03 dex the yield metallic-
ity as observed
This evidence severely tackles the classical scheme a la
Schmidt where star-formation strength is fully driven by just the
mean gas density On the contrary what it might be the real case
is that star formation process in spiral galaxies behaves like a wild
outbreak that stem from previously contaminated regions to pro-
gressively spread across the rest of galaxy body Nepveu 1988
1989 Barnes 2004
The possible implication of the Milky Way scenario to the
more general case of late-type galaxy evolution along the Hubble
morphological sequence has been the focus of Sec 4 As far as
closeby external galaxies in the local Universe are concerned ob-
servations still hamper any rm assessment of galaxy metal abun-
dance As a matter of fact see Fig 12 the galaxy-to-galaxy scat-
ter of F eH distribution seems to largely overcome the nominal
accuracy of any individual estimate a feature that makes evident
the intrinsic difculty in dening a fair representative metallicity
A Buzzoni
when such a composite stellar environment is dealt with as in the
late-type galaxy disks Arimoto  Jablonka 1991
On the other hand the combined study of the other leading
parameters can add important pieces of information that greatly
help constraining the problem In this regard our discussion along
Sec 43 basically grounds on three relevant relationships that
emerge from the observational properties of different galaxy sam-
ples In particular
i the down-sizing mechanism appears to govern star forma-
tion in the local Universe as well with a clear relationship between
current SFR and galaxy stellar mass see Fig 13
ii the delayed star formation among low-mass galaxies as
implied by the inverse b-M 
gal dependendence naturally leads to a
more copious gas fraction when moving from giant to dwarf galax-
ies as observed indeed see Fig 15
iii the physical relationship of star formation mechanisms
with galaxy stellar mass can also aproximately t into a straight
morphological scheme Fig 14 where galaxies with decreasing
mass more likely take the look of later-type spirals It has to remain
clear however that mass not morphology is the primary parameter
that govern late-type galaxy properties Boselli et al 2001
Once accounting for galaxy chemical properties by taking for
instance Oxygen abundance of HII regions as a tracer the blurring
trend with morphology leaves space to a much cleaner relationship
with galaxy stellar mass as in the upper panel of Fig 16 Facing
the fact that low-mass systems also appear richer in gas and poorer
in metals one might even speculate on a simple scenario where the
observed trend is in fact merely the result of the softening mecha-
nism that leads enriched stellar mass to mix into fresh unprocessed
gas in the ISM Actually when galaxy data are properly rescaled to
a xed reference value of Gtot through eq 51 one sees lower
panel of Fig 16 that most of the OH vs M 
gal trend is re-
covered leaving a nearly at OH distribution along the entire
galaxy mass range This result is consistent with our theoretical
predictions for a nearly constant yield metallicity along the entire
late-type galaxy sequence
A striking evidence when sampling the local Universe is that
spiral galaxies appear all dangerously close to shut down their
venture as stars-forming systems being on the verge of exhaust-
ing their own gas resources A so special case and our somewhat
suspicious temporal location as privileged observers did not es-
cape the analysis of many authors in the literature leading Roberts
1963 rst to wonder about the real residual life left to spiral
systems according to their current gas capabilities Relying on our
notation the so-called Roberts time tR easily derives in its orig-
inal denition namely as the timescale for the primordial gas to
vanish see eq 54 On the other hand and more interestingly
one would like to assess the even more general case when the
global gas consumption ie including returned stellar mass even-
tually sets or overcome the ultimate limit to galaxy star formation
Kennicutt Tamblyn  Congdon 1994
Equation 55 shows that as far a the down-sizing prescrip-
tions set the reference relationship between birthrate and galaxy
mass one has to conclude that spiral galaxies cannot escape an age
where no stars will form at all In fact if returned mass is left as
the only gas supplier to the ISM then the maximum birthrate that
a galaxy can sustain is of the order of bmax  f tH 1  f  
f 1  f  which must evidently be much less than  045 for a
Salpeter IMF As a result only massive Mgal  1011 M SaSb
spirals may have some chance to extend their active life for a while
namely for  03 tH as indicated by Fig 17 On the contrary no
way out seems to be envisaged for dwarf systems that will soon
cease their star formation activity unless to drastically reduce their
apparent birthrate below the bmax gure

due to Robert Kennicutt for his wise comments to the draft of this
paper and to Giovanni Carraro and Ivo Saviane for their warm hos-
pitality during my visit at the ESO premises in Santiago de Chile
where part of this work has been conceived Finally the anonymous
referee is especially acknowledged for a number of very construc-
tive suggestions which greatly helped better focus the key issues
of the paper
This work has made extensive use of different on-line extra-
galactic databases namely the NASAIPAC Extragalactic Database
NED operated by JPLCIT under contract with NASA the
Hyper-Linked Extragalactic Databases and Archives HyperLeda
based at the Lyon University and the VizieR catalog service of the
Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg Part of the data
retrieval has been eased by the DEXTER graphic interface hosted
at the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory GAVO in Hei-
delberg
