Abstract Using high resolution N -body simulations we study the for-
mation and evolution of clusters and groups in a CDM cosmological
model Groups of galaxies have been formed already before z  4 Merg-

the groups merge into large isolated halos
Introduction
Cosmological scenarios with cold dark matter alone cannot explain the struc-
ture formation both on small and very large scales Scenarios with a non-zero
cosmological constant  have been proved to be very successful in describing
most of the observational data at both low and high redshifts Moreover from
a recent analysis of 42 high-redshift supernovae Perlmutter etal 1999 found
direct evidence for   072 within a at cosmology
It is generally believed that the dark matter component of galaxies the dark
matter halos plays an important role in the formation of galaxies Properties
and evolution of the halos depend on the environment Avila-Reese et al 1999
Gottlober et al 1999ab which implies in turn that properties of galaxies
can be expected to depend on cosmological environment too Many of the dark
matter halos are much more extended than galaxies and contain several subhalos
Here we present results of a study of the formation and evolution of these large
halos which host groups and clusters of galaxies
2 Dark matter halos in the simulation
We simulate evolution of 2563 cold dark matter particles in a CDM model
M  1    03 8  10 H0  70 kmsMpc As a compromise we have
chosen a simulation box of 60h1Mpc in order to study the statistical properties

of halos in a cosmological environment and to have also a sucient mass reso-
lution particle mass of 11  109h1M The simulations were done using the
Adaptive Renement Tree ART code Kravtsov Klypin  Khokhlov 1997
The code used a 5123 homogeneous grid on the lowest level of resolution and
six levels of renement each successive renement level doubling the resolution
The sixth renement level corresponds to a formal dynamical range of 32000 in
high density regions Thus we can reach in a 60 h1 Mpc box the force resolution
of  2h1 kpc
Identication of halos in dense environments and reconstruction of their evo-
lution is a challenge In order to nd halos in the simulation we have developed
two algorithms which we called the hierarchical friends-of-friends HFOF and
the bound density maxima BDM algorithms Klypin et al 1999 These algo-
rithms work on a snapshot of the particle distribution They are able to identify
halos inside of halos ie stable gravitationally self-bound halos which move
inside of a larger region of virial overdensity Therefore we can nd dark matter
halos which correspond to galaxies inside of groups or clusters but also small
satellites bound to a larger galaxy like the LMC and the Milky Way or the M51
system The algorithm identies halos at dierent redshifts In a second step
we establish the ancestor-descendant relationships for all halos at all times
Gottlober et al 1999ab
The total mass of a halo depends on its assumed radius However for satel-
lite halos inside larger bound systems the notion of radius becomes somewhat
arbitrary The formal virial radius of a satellite halo is simply equal to the virial
radius of its host halo We have chosen to dene the outer tidal radius of the
satellite halos as the radius at which their density prole starts to atten We
try to avoid the problem of mass determination by assigning not only a mass to
a halo but nding also its maximum circular velocity pGMR vcirc This
is the quantity which is more meaningful observationally Numerically vcirc can
be measured more easily and more accurately then mass
In order to dene a complete halo sample that is not aected by the nu-
merical details of halo nding procedure we have constructed the dierential
velocity functions at z  0 for dierent mass thresholds and maximum radii
We found that the halo samples do not depend on the numerical parameters of
the halo nder for halos with vcirc
 100 kms Gottlober et al 1999a Here
we want to study samples of halos at redshifts z  4 with circular velocities
vcirc  100 kms and for comparison samples of more massive halos with cir-
cular velocities vcirc  120 kms Moreover we include only halos which consist
of at least 50 bound particles This reduces the possible detection of fake halos
in the simulation in particular the detection of very small fake satellite halos
At redshift z  0 we have detected 7786 halos with vcirc  100kms in our sim-
ulation which corresponds a number densities of 0036h3Mpc3 4787 of these
halos have circular velocities vcirc  120kms 0022h3Mpc3 These densities
roughly agree with the number density of galaxies with magnitudes Mr

  184 estimated by the luminosity function of the Las Campanas
redshift survey Lin et al 1996 which we have extended to -163
The time evolution of the total number of halos in the box is shown in Fig 1
At z  4 we found the same number of halos independent of the threshold of
the circular velocity This means that we have reached here the resolution limit
of the simulation In fact we had excluded low mass halos with less than 50
particles
3 Environment of Halos
To nd the cosmological environment of each of these halos at z  4 we run a
friend-of-friend analysis over the dark matter particles with a linking length of 02
times the mean interparticle distance By this procedure we nd clusters of dark
matter particles with an overdensity of about 200 At z  0 the virial overdensity
in the CDM model under consideration is about 330 which corresponds to a
linking length of about 017 With increasing z the virial overdensity decreases
and reaches 200 at z  1 Here we have used the same linking length for all z
Therefore the objects which we nd at z  1 are slightly larger than the objects
at virial overdensity We have increased the linking length at z  0 because we
found in the vicinity of galaxy clusters halos which had already interacted with
the cluster but were in the moment of detection just outside the region of virial
overdensity
In a second step we nd for each of the halos at all z the cluster of dark
matter particles to which the halo belongs We call the halo a cluster galaxy if the
the halo belongs to a particle cluster with a total mass larger than 1014h1M
We call it an isolated galaxy if only one halo belongs to the object at overdensity
200 which we found by the friends-of-friends algorithm This denition ensures
that the isolated galaxies really do not interact with other galaxies We found
a substantial number about 10  of doublets In some cases we found pairs of
halos with approximately the same mass but in most of the cases these doublets
consist of one big halo with a small bound satellite which is inside of or partly
overlaps with the larger halo On the one hand there could be more small
satellites which we do not detect due to the limited mass resolution so that the
doublet is in fact a small group On the other hand there could be really only

one small satellite so that the object better could be handled as an isolated
galaxy In order to avoid dicult decisions we have handled the galaxy pairs
separately having in mind that some of them could belong to isolated galaxies
whereas other are seeds of a small group The rest of halos are called group
galaxies
The 7786 halos with vcirc  100kms are distributed over 18 clusters 252
groups and 373 pairs 4892 halos are isolated
4 The Evolution of Halos
The total number of halos with vcirc  100 kms increases from 5290 at z  4
to the maximum value of 11847 at redshift z  15 and then decreased to 7786
at redshift z  0 see Fig 1 Assuming that each of these halos would contain
a galaxy we compute the evolution of the fraction of isolated galaxies and
galaxies in clusters groups and pairs
The rst object of virial mass  1014h1M forms between z  25 and
z  2 At z  2 this cluster of 13  1014h1M contains already 68 satellite
halos The most massive central halo of this cluster has a circular velocity of
760 kms The number of cluster galaxies increases up to z  0 where 868
galaxies have been detected in clusters
Figure 3
for dark matter halos with vcirc  100kms
The evolution of the number of clusters groups and pairs
At all analyzed time epochs in the simulation we found approximately 10 
of pairs We have detected 113 groups already at z  4 These groups contain
430 galaxies The number of group galaxies increases very rapidly and reaches
a maximum of 2607 at z  15 Afterwards it decreases up to 1280 at z  0
Finally also the number of isolated galaxies increases from z  4 4194 until
z  15 7854 and then decreases until z  0 4892
In Fig 2 we show the time evolution of the fraction of isolated galaxies
and galaxies in clusters groups and pairs for dark matter halos with vcirc 
100kms The sample of more massive halos vcirc  120kms shows essentially
the same behavior but the total number of halos is smaller
Now let us discuss the evolution of clusters and groups To this end we nd
similar to the chain of progenitors of each halo the progenitors of the clusters and
groups The rst cluster has been formed before z  2 Due to accretion and
merging of groups the number of clusters increases to 18 at z  0 Fig 3 At
z  4 we found 113 groups and 333 pairs in our simulation It is remarkable that
these numbers do not depend on the chosen threshold of the circular velocity
Both the number of groups and pairs increases up to z  15 where we have
465 363 groups and 666 567 pairs for vcirc  100kms vcirc  120kms
At z  0 252 152 groups and 373 258 pairs remain The total number of
groups and pairs reduces with increasing threshold of the circular velocity In
fact if we take into account only more massive objects some of the pairs would
be identied as isolated galaxies whereas some of the groups would be identied
as pairs or isolated galaxies However as we already mentioned the overall
fraction of galaxies in groups and pairs is rather insensitive to this threshold
From Fig 2 we see that the fraction of galaxies in groups decreases from
about 22 at z  07 to about 16 at z  0 At the same time the fraction of
isolated halos slightly increases The decreasing number of groups is mostly due
to the fact that groups merge into more massive objects However we also found
a small fraction of groups which merge into isolated halos In the simulation
we found 20 halos with masses larger than 1012h1M the progenitor of which
at z  1 was a group with 4 to seven members Such a merged group could
appear today as an isolated elliptical with a group-like X-ray halo Mulchaey

5 Conclusions
The general trend during evolution of clustering is the formation of small bound
systems of halos at z 
 15 After z  15 these systems tend to merge and to
increase mass by accretion so that large galaxy clusters grow in the simulation
The total number of small bound systems and the total number of galaxies in
these small systems rapidly decreases after z  15 The fraction of isolated
galaxies remains approximately constant after z  1 whereas the fraction of
galaxies in groups decreases Some of the groups merge after z  1 to form large
isolated galaxies
