Abstract We present the results from adaptive optics AO assisted imaging in the Ks band of an area of
15 arcmin2 for SWAN Survey of a Wide Area with NACO We derive the high resolution near-IR morphology
of  400 galaxies up to Ks  235 in the rst 21 SWAN elds around bright guide stars carefully taking into
account the survey selection eects and using an accurate treatment of the anisoplanatic AO PSF The detected
galaxies are sorted into two morphological classes according to their Sersic index The extracted morphological
properties and number counts of the galaxies are compared with the predictions of dierent galaxy formation and
evolution models both for the whole galaxy population and separately for late-type and early-type galaxies This
is one of the rst times such a comparison has been done in the near-IR as AO observations and accurate PSF
modeling are needed to obtain reliable morphological classication of faint eld galaxies at these wavelengths
For early-type galaxies we nd that a pure luminosity evolution model without evidence for relevant number and
size evolution better reproduces the observed properties of our Ks-selected sample than current semi-analytic
models based on the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation In particular we nd that the observed attening of
elliptical galaxy counts at Ks  20 is quantitatively in good agreement with the prediction of the pure luminosity
evolution model that was calculated prior to the observation For late-type galaxies while both models are able to
reproduce the number counts we nd some hints of a possible size growth These results demonstrate the unique
power of AO observations to derive high resolution details of faint galaxies morphology in the near-IR and drive

1 Introduction
One of the main objectives of modern astrophysics is un-
derstanding the process of galaxy formation and evolution
The best way to tackle this issue is studying the properties
of galaxies observed at the epoch of their formation and
early evolution such as their stellar population history of
mass assembly morphology metallicity and interplay with
the intergalactic medium However disentangling these
processes in nearby systems is already extremely dicult

and the challenge is even greater at higher redshift where
sources are compact in size  01  03 and larger
galaxies are rare eg Bouwens et al 2004 To resolve and
study the details of high-redshift galaxies using ground
based telescopes which can provide larger samples and
deeper observations than space-based observations it is
necessary to overcome the blurring eects of the atmo-
sphere through the use of adaptive optics AO systems
These can allow ground-based telescopes to operate at or
near the diraction limit in the near-infrared  007 in
K band for an 8 m telescope resulting in a high angular
resolution and a low background in each pixel
Besides the technical advantages aorded by AO near-
infrared surveys provide one of the best opportunities
to investigate the cosmic evolution of galaxies and their

mass assembly In particular K-band 22 m selected
samples are ideally suited for addressing the problems
of galaxy formation and evolution First since the rest
frame near-IR luminosity is a good tracer of the galaxy
stellar mass eg Brinchmann  Ellis 2000 Bell  de
Jong 2001 Mannucci et al 2005 K-band surveys allow
us to select galaxies according to their mass up to z  15
rest  09  10 m rather than suer strong biases to-
wards star-forming and peculiar galaxies like optical sur-
veys eg Drory et al 2004 Fontana et al 2004 Another
strong argument for selecting galaxies in the near infrared
is that due to the similarity of the spectral shapes of dif-
ferent galaxy types and stellar population ages in the rest
frame near-IR over a wide redshift range eg Mannucci
et al 2001 the selection of galaxies in the K band is not
aected by strong k-correction eects eg Cowie et al
1994 In contrast selection in the I band becomes very
type sensitive beyond z  1 and the situation is even
more extreme in the B band where the fading of early-
type galaxies is substantial even at modest redshifts Thus
near-IR samples do not depend as strongly on galaxy type
as optically selected ones which are more sensitive to re-
cent and ongoing star formation activity as they sample
the rest-frame UV light and are biased against old and
passive or weakly star-forming galaxies
Finally near-IR surveys are less aected by dust ex-
tinction than optical ones making it possible to select
highly extinguished star-forming galaxies The observa-
tion of the obscured dusty star formation rate is crucial for
measuring the global star formation history Calculations
based on the observed rest frame UV ux eg Madau
et al 1996 Connolly et al 1997 might be signicantly
underestimated if a large fraction of the overall star for-
mation at high redshift takes place in highly obscured star-
burst galaxies eg Steidel et al 1999 Blain et al 2002
Morphology is one of the most appropiate ways to
characterize the properties of galaxies and we will only
reach a complete understanding of galaxies by deriving
the mechanisms responsible for their morphologies In this
context the study of galaxy size and of the evolution of
other galaxy properties according to morphological type
have made use mainly of the classication derived from
deep optical HST imaging eg Simard et al 1999 Labbe
et al 2003 Trujillo  Aguerri 2004 Pannella et al 2006
due to the higher angular resolution achievable at opti-
cal wavelengths with HST However near-infrared mor-
phology is a better tracer of the underlying mass dis-
tribution as it is not biased towards recent star forma-
tion and is less aected by dust obscuration By using
adaptive optics it is now possible to push the analysis of
source properties surface density magnitude color mor-
phology etc as a function of source size in the near-
IR to an entirely new regime and study sources that
are both faint and compact Ample evidence already in-
dicates that such source populations do exist  eg a
large fraction of the HAB  21 sources detected by Yan
et al 1998 are still unresolved at the  035 resolu-
tion provided by HSTNICMOS in the near-IR The AO-
corrected diraction-limited near-IR PSF of an 8 m tele-
scope is a powerful tool to study this kind of object since
the angular resolution it yields is even higher than can be
obtained by HST at this wavelength
Although the advantages of near-IR AO observations
for studying how galaxies form and evolve in the early uni-
verse are clear until now there have been only a few at-
tempts using natural guide stars NGS see eg Larkin et
al 2000 Glassman Larkin  Lafreniere 2002 Steinbring
et al 2004 Minowa et al 2005 due to the very small
number of known extragalactic sources lying at distances
  30 from bright V  13 stars needed to correct
the wavefront for AO guiding and to the problems aris-
ing from the anisoplanaticism of the PSF in AO observa-
tions The prospects for AO cosmology will undoubtedly
improve with the widespread adoption of laser guide star
LGS systems since these impose less stringent require-
ments on the brightness of stars used for tip-tilt correction
eg Melbourne et al 2005 However to overcome the
present shortage of targets for AO cosmology it is neces-
sary to identify and characterize extragalactic sources in
the vicinity of bright guide stars see eg Larkin et al
1999 Davies et al 2001 Christopher  Smail 2006
We therefore undertook a campaign of seeing-limited
near-IR imaging of elds selected around stars bright
enough for AO guiding 103  R  124 blue B  R 
11 in order to maximize the amount of light on the wave-
front sensor lying at high galactic latitude b  15 deg
to minimize extinction and contamination by foreground
stars and with a declination suitable for observations
with the ESO Very Large Telescope at low air mass
44 deg    13 deg A total of 42 southern bright
star elds SBSFs were selected and observed at seeing-
limited resolution in Ks band with SOFI at the ESO New
Technology Telescope More details about the target selec-
tion and data can be found in Baker et al 2003 The
same elds have been followed up at optical wavelengths
Davies et al 2006 and are now targets for VIMOS in-
tegral eld optical spectroscopy at the ESO Very Large
Telescope VLT
In this paper we present the results of our Ks-band
AO imaging survey of the rst 21 elds in the framework
of SWAN Survey of a Wide Area with NACO which is
the AO-assisted result of these seeing-limited preliminar-
ies The survey will be introduced in the following section
and the observations will be briey described in section 3
The data reduction approach will be presented in section
4 while the detection criteria and technique will be dis-
cussed in section 5 The extraction of the morphological
parameters of the detected galaxies is analyzed in section
6 and the method used to distinguish between stars and
galaxies is described in section 7 In section 8 we take into
account the selection eects present in our data discuss
the completeness of the survey and show the corrected
number counts The number counts and size-magnitude
relation of the full sample of galaxies and for late and
early-type systems separately are compared with the pre-
dictions of two dierent galaxy evolution models in section

2 The Survey of a Wide Area with NACO
Having already characterized large samples of objects in
bright star elds as described in the previous section we
targeted them with NACO on the VLT in order to ex-
ploit the present generation of AO technology for galaxy
evolution studies NACO comprises the NAOS Shack-
Hartmann AO module Rousset et al 2003 mated with
CONICA near-infrared camera Lenzen et al 1998 Our
choice of NACO observing mode was dictated by our
desire to complement previous HSTNICMOS surveys
First we chose to image in Ks where NICMOS is less
sensitive than in J and H thus making SWAN preferen-
tially sensitive to red objects Second we chose to priori-
tize survey area over depth in order to optimize the study
of the galaxies over the last half of the Hubble time and
improve SWANs sensitivity to rare objects and its robust-
ness against cosmic variance the latter already enhanced
by the surveys peculiarity of patching together small elds
at dierent locations on the sky Use of NACOs 0054
pixel scale to maximize the eld of view and the Strehl
ratios of 3060 typically achieved in Ks result in im-
ages that are slightly undersampled As the AO PSF is
quickly changing both in time and position on the frame
in order to extract full information from our wide-eld ob-
servations we have developed a new approach to account
for the anisoplanatic PSF The method was presented in
Cresci et al 2005 hereafter Paper I along with some
examples of galaxy morphology tting using the derived
model PSF
Each NACO pointing provides a usable  075 arcmin2
of the full 555  555 detector area due to losses
from dithering and the central star see eg Fig 1
Nevertheless the anticipated survey area that will result
from assembling 42 such images will be  at  30 arcmin2
 some six times larger than the NICMOS survey of the
HDF and anking elds in J and H Dickinson 1999
Dickinson et al 2000 SWAN aims to combine the high
angular resolution of a space-based survey with the shal-
lower depth and wider area of a ground-based survey
thereby probing sources that are compact faint red and
rare more eectively than any other survey to date

ported in 7 The Strehl ratio estimated from a series of
short exposures through a narrow band lter taken before
andor after the science exposures in order to monitor the
on-axis PSF is given in column 8 This is calculated from
the ratio of the maximum pixel to the total ux and in-
cludes a correction for the oset of the PSFs centroid from
the center of a pixel this can be considerable typically
adding 510 to the Strehl ratio for the data here due to
the large 0054 size of the pixels The number of bright
point sources in each eld used to evaluate the isoplanatic
angle at 22 m tting the variation of their Strehl ratio

the resulting isoplanatic angle in column 10
3 Observations
The rst 21 SWAN elds were observed in Ks band with
the NACO AO system at the VLT using the visible Wave
Front Sensor WFS An example of a SWAN image is
given in Fig 1 Table 1 summarizes other observational
parameters and the AO system performance during the
observations The SBSF name is given in column 1 and
the coordinates of the guide star in the center of each eld
are given in 2 and 3 accurate to 02 Column 4 re-
ports the dates on which each eld was observed The
total integration time on each eld is given in 5 and the
4 Data reduction
The data obtained were reduced using PC-IRAF ver-
sion 2113 together with some scripts in IDL ver-
sion 60 The presence of a bright star in the center of a
eld less than 1 across made the data reduction more com-
plex than usual requiring extra steps to compensate An
initial estimate of the sky background was made from the
target frames after masking all bright objects in the elds
Each target frame then had the sky subtracted was at
elded had any residual constant background removed
and hot pixels corrected A mask that included dead pix-
els and bad regions was then applied to each frame In

Table 1 Observational parameters and AO performances for NACO observations of SWAN elds See the text for a
full description of the entries a CONICA was tted with a new detector in June 2004b The noise is that measured in the
resulting co-added image scaled to a 1 sec integration Its statistical properties closely follow a Gaussian distribution
with additional weak wings c 0 refers to the isoplanatic angle in Ks band as measured tting the variation of the
Strehl ratio of the point sources in the elds as described in the text
order to correct for over-subtraction from very extended
faint scattering andor emission around bright objects
a surface was t to each frame ignoring regions in the ob-
ject mask and subtracted The frames were then aligned
with sub-pixel accuracy using up to several conspicuous
isolated objects in the eld and averaged after rejecting
high and low pixels at each point according to an esti-
mated variance This initial combined frame was used to
generate a new object mask and the entire data reduc-
tion process was repeated yielding a new combined frame
with much less over-subtraction In a nal step the ob-
jects were once more masked out and a surface tted to
the background and this was subtracted to produce the
nal image
The sky is estimated by dithering ie slightly mov-
ing the telescope between dierent frames so that dierent
pixels sample dierent parts of the sky In SWAN the o-
sets were chosen semi-randomly within a 7 box due to
the limited NACO eld of view Therefore even if great
care is used to produce the sky frames the sky around
objects larger than  3 ie for the very bright guide
star and for galaxies with eective radius Re  1 may
be overestimated producing a self-subtraction of some
galaxy ux This eect can produce fainter magnitudes
and smaller dimensions for such bright and large objects
although these constitute less than 2 of the total sam-
ple in our elds However in section 9 we will see that
this eect introduces some systematic uncertainties in the
size-magnitude relation for large galaxies
5 Source detection
In each reduced SWAN eld sources were detected using
SExtractor Bertin  Arnouts 1996 with the appropri-
ate parameters optimized for compact sources set to pro-
vide a positive detection for objects brighter than 15 
per pixel over an area of more than 3 pixels To improve
the detection of faint sources we used a Gaussian lter
  15 pixels to smooth the image False detections
at the noisy borders of the mosaic and on the spikes and
the ghost of the bright guide star were removed For the
former a mask that indicated the fraction of the total
integration time spent on each pixel was used objects de-
tected in pixels below a specied threshold were rejected
For the latter appropriate object masks were created Our
algorithm deliberately does not push the detection to the
faintest possible limit as we are more interested in the
high resolution AO morphologies of the brighter sources
than in the deepest possible number counts For this rea-
son our counts see Section 8 are not signicantly con-
taminated by spurious detections due to noise The total
G Cresci et al Galaxy morphology and evolution from SWAN Adaptive Optics imaging
coverage above the detection thresholds of the 21 elds is
153 arcmin2 within which a total of 495 sources are de-
tected down to a magnitude of Ks  235 KAB  253
see section 8
6 Morphological tting
The morphological parameters of the detected galaxies
were derived using GALFIT Peng et al 2002 a widely
used software package that ts a two-dimensional image
of a galaxy andor a point source with one or more ana-
lytic functions that have been convolved with a model of
the PSF To t the galaxies in our SWAN elds we used
a single Sersic 1968 prole
IR  IRe  expbn  RRe1n  1
where Re is the eective radius that encloses half of the
light n is the Sersic index and bn is a constant that varies
with n chosen so that Re corresponds to the half-light
radius
GALFIT needs as an input a PSF to convolve the
Sersic prole model We used the o-axis AO PSF model
presented in Paper I which is optimized for wide-eld and
high Galactic latitude observations The o-axis PSF is
determined by convolving the on-axis PSF in each of the
elds with an elliptical Gaussian kernel elongated towards
the guide star The FWHM of the kernel depends on the
distance from the guide star and on the isoplanatic angle
of the eld We therefore derived the isoplanatic angle for
each eld tting the variation of the Strehl ratio of the
point sources across the eld as described in Paper I The
obtained isoplanatic angle along with the number of point
sources used in the t are reported in Table 1 The de-
rived isoplanatic angles for the 21 elds range from 49
to 218 In four of the elds no bright point source was
available except the guide star and therefore the average
isoplanatic angle for the other elds 127 was assumed
Initial guesses for GALFIT model parameters were ob-
tained from the SExtractor source catalogs Lacking an
estimate of the Sersic index n in the SExtractor catalogs
we used n  2 for all the galaxies in the rst iteration
Each galaxy was tted twice using as rst guesses for the
second iteration the output parameters of the rst itera-
tion Roughly 16 of the detected galaxies could not be
tted satisfactorily with a single component but required
simultaneous ts with very close companions or multiple-
component ts These can be divided in two categories
9 of the total are interacting galaxies or very close pairs
where the overlap of the isophotes from dierent objects
required a simultaneous t A further 7 of the total are
galaxies for which a single-component Sersic prole was
not sucient to t the light prole leaving signicant
residuals in the subtraction Half of these two-component
galaxies were re-t using a disk component and an ellip-
tical bulge while the other half were re-t by adding a
central point source to the Sersic component
As we have shown by the detailed simulations in Paper
I the morphological parameters of the galaxies detected

SWAN galaxies tted by GALFIT with 2
  2 as a func-
tion of their Sersic index n As expected while late-type
galaxies n  2 are observed at random inclinations with
respect to the plane of the sky and therefore at every
ba early-type galaxies n  2 are not observed with
ba  04
at the depths of our images can be derived with low un-
certainties up to Ks  205 while for fainter objects the
uncertainties grow as a function of the magnitude In ad-
dition we recall that it is possible to set a threshold
of n  2 on the Sersic index that can discriminate be-
tween late-type galaxies n  2 and early-type galaxies
n  2 The results of our simulation are conrmed eg by
Ravindranath et al 2004 who used GALFIT to t sin-
gle Sersic proles to a sample of nearby galaxies of known
morphology from the Frei et al 1996 sample after arti-
cially redshifting them to z  05 and z  10 They found
that n  2 is the appropriate threshold to separate disk-
dominated galaxies from bulge-dominated ones even in
the presence of morphological complexities such as dust
star-forming regions etc Ravindranath et al 2004
Of the 383 galaxies detected to Ks  235 see sec-
tion 7 for a discussion of the 112 stars 214 were classi-
ed as late-type and 169 as early-type The sources t-
ted with multiple components are classied according to
the Sersic component providing the higher ux contribu-
tion The galaxies are divided in these two subclasses for
the following analysis with an average contamination be-
tween the two subclasses of less than 10 up to Ks  21
Paper I In order to quantify the morphological t qual-
ity we used the 2
 calculated by GALFIT We classied
as well-t the 315 galaxies with 2
  2 167 late-type
and 148 early-type while the other ts were considered
less reliable and are not considered when computing the
size-magnitude relation of the galaxies in the SWAN elds
although they are included in the number counts As
G Cresci et al Galaxy morphology and evolution from SWAN Adaptive Optics imaging
an additional check of our lateearly-type separation we
show in Fig 2 the distribution of the axis ratios ba of the
galaxies with 2
  2 as a function of Sersic index n As
expected while the late-type galaxies are observed at ran-
dom inclinations with respect to the plane of the sky and
therefore at every ba early-type galaxies are not observed
with ba  04 eg Lambas et al 1992 This conrms
that our morphological classication of early and late type
galaxies based on the Sersic index n produces reliable re-
While the redshifts of these objects are presently un-
known the magnitude-redshift relation of Cowie et al
1996 and the K20 survey Cimatti et al 2002 indicate
that at K  20 the median redshift is z  08  1 At this
redshift our spatial resolution of 01 which also corre-
sponds to the smallest eective radius bin is equivalent to
only 500 pc for typical cosmologies hinting at the exciting
potential of this work
7 Star-galaxy separation
The separation of Galactic foreground stars from the eld
galaxies is a critical step for avoiding star contamina-
tion in our galaxy catalogue We classied as stars all 58
sources detected in the NACO images with SExtractor
stellarity index SSI  09 The SExtractor classication
should be treated with caution since it assumes a con-
stant PSF across each eld and elongated sources are
more likely classied as galaxies However all the objects
classied as stars by SExtractor lie on an upper envelope
in a Strehl versus radial distance plot ie they have the
highest Strehl ratio among the sources at the same dis-
tance from the guide star supporting their classication
as point sources It remains possible that some stars are
not classied as point sources by SExtractor due to the
limited isoplanatic AO patch and their resulting elongated
shape We therefore also classied as stars all the very
compact sources tted by GALFIT with Re  001 This
is supported by simulations in which we tted true du-
cial point sources in the SWAN elds rescaled to several
magnitudes with GALFIT Sersic proles and obtained
very compact eective radii Re  001 and high Sersic
indexes For very bright and elongated PSFs the tted
Re can still be as large as  02 due to the higher sig-
nal in the halos of the PSF that may not be perfectly
reproduced by the PSF model We therefore include in
the star catalogue all the sources with Ks  185 in or-
der to have suciently high SN that are classied as
stars by SExtractor in our SOFI seeing limited images of
the SWAN elds All the objects classied as stars in the
seeing-limited images proved to be compact in the AO-
corrected ones as well even if elongated with all having
Re  016 as tted by GALFIT using the appropriate
local PSFs for convolution
We have a total of 112 stars in the 21 SWAN elds an-
alyzed To assess the robustness of the stargalaxy classi-
cation the star counts were compared with the predictions
of the Bahcall et al 1980 galaxy model which provides
Fig 3 Number of stars in the SWAN elds as a function
of Galactic latitude b up to Ks  22 compared with the
predictions of the Galaxy model of Bahcall et al 1980
The observed and predicted stars number counts are in
very good agreement for all latitudes except the lowest
latitude bin b  20 where the Galactic model is less
accurate due to the high variability between adjacent lines
of sight
the star counts as a function of the elds Galactic longi-
tude and latitude As the model provides the number of
stars brighter than a certain limiting magnitude in the V
band we convert the V magnitude into a Ks magnitude
using an average color derived from the K-band counts at
the Galactic pole provided by Hutchings et al 2002 In
Fig 3 we show the number of stars in the SWAN elds
as a function of Galactic latitude b up to Ks  22 which
corresponds to the limit where we are 100 complete for
point sources see Fig 5 It can be seen that the ob-
served and predicted stellar number counts are in very
good agreement for all latitudes except the lowest latitude
bin b  20 where the Galactic model is less accurate
due to the high variability between adjacent lines of sight
However the total excess of selected stars with respect to
the model predictions is only 18 sources ie small com-
pared to the total catalogue of 383 galaxies Therefore
even if some compact galaxies in these elds were erro-
neously classied as stars they represent less than 5 of
the sample

Fig 4 The left panel shows the variation of the detection probability for a late-type galaxy in SWAN as a function
of the magnitude and the eective radius Re The probability is the average for all 21 observed elds and assumes a
distance from the guide star 1  0  2 The right panel shows the same for early-type galaxies

n  2 with lower concentration
3 The eective radius Re As before more compact
sources are more easily detected
4 The SWAN eld in which the source was observed
The integration time and therefore the signalnoise ra-
tio is dierent in dierent elds In addition the over-
all AO correction is dierent in each observation as
is indicated by the dierent on-axis Strehl ratios see
Table 1
5 The distance from the guide star 0 as the degree of
correction of the AO system depends strongly on this
parameter see eg Paper I
The last two parameters are due to the distinctive at-
tributes of our survey which makes use of several dierent
elds 4 and of AO 45
In order to derive the detection probability for each
combination of these ve parameters we ran several sim-
ulations adding a total of 65000 simulated galaxy proles
with known parameters  matched to the ones of the ob-
served galaxies  to the original SWAN elds at random
locations and tried to recover them running SExtractor
again We used extended sources to evaluate the complete-
ness correction as this produces results that are quite
dierent from those inferred using point sources alone
especially at this resolution SExtractor was used with
the same parameters used in the science source detection
We used the Sersic index n  1 for late-type galaxies
and n  4 for early-type galaxies For both types the
eective radius Re ranged from 01to 10 The galaxy
proles were convolved with real NACO PSFs extracted
from point sources in our data lying at dierent distances
from the guide star in order to simulate the eect of the
AO correction The simulated galaxies have magnitudes
ranging between Ks  19 where we are 100 complete
for every combination of the other four parameters to
Ks  235 We consider three dierent regimes for the
Fig 5 Comparison between the completeness for point
sources and for extended sources for the SWAN elds
The completeness for point sources triangles dashed
line was evaluated adding 100 true NACO point sources
0  15 for each magnitude to each eld and then
averaging over all elds The completeness for extended
sources circles solid line is the average over all the elds
for both late and early-type with Re  03 ie the mean
for all the detected sources in SWAN at the same distance
from the guide star used for the point sources The error-
bars show the variance for the 21 dierent elds
detection probability as a function of the distance from
the guide star 0  1 1  0  2 and 0  2
We used point sources at 0  09 15 and 28 respec-
tively for the three regimes as references for the PSF in
the simulated galaxies
G Cresci et al Galaxy morphology and evolution from SWAN Adaptive Optics imaging
Using this approach we can derive the detection prob-
ability for a galaxy of known magnitude Re Sersic index
and distance from the guide star in a particular eld By
way of example the histograms of the detection probabil-
ity averaged over all 21 elds as a function of magnitude
and of eective radius Re for late and early-type galaxies
with 1  0  2 are shown in Fig 4 It is clear from
comparing the panels how much more sensitive high res-
olution images are to more core-concentrated sources like
the elliptical galaxies
The detection probability can be used to correct the
number counts using the observed galaxy population as a
starting point From our simulations we derived the de-
tection probability Pdetect for each detected galaxy in the
survey using the measured Re magnitude and Sersic in-
dex from GALFIT tting see section 6 along with the
position of the galaxy in the eld Each galaxy is then
regarded in the completeness-corrected number counts as
1Pdetect sources at its magnitude so that for example
a galaxy with Pdetect  080 counts as 125 galaxies once
the correction is applied
In Fig 5 we show the average completeness over all
the elds for both point sources and extended objects as a
function of magnitude The completeness for point sources
was derived by adding 100 times to each eld a true
NACO point source with rescaled ux The point source
was at a distance 0  15 from the guide star The com-
pleteness for extended objects is the average between that
of late-type and of early-type galaxies over all the elds
using the same NACO point source PSF to convolve the
simulated galaxy proles The eective radius was xed at
the average for the detected SWAN sources Re  03
Obviously the correction derived using only point sources
is much smaller than the one derived as described above
with the number of sources in the range 205  Ks  22
where no correction would be applied in the point-source
case being particularly underestimated
The corrected number counts obtained using the de-
tection probabilities of the observed SWAN sources as
weights are shown in Fig 6 At brighter magnitudes
Ks  16 an excess is present in our number counts
with respect to others in the literature This is due to a
selection bias as some of the elds were chosen to have an
excess of bright galaxies see Baker et al 2003 At fainter
magnitudes the points at Ks  23 are no longer reliable
as the completeness correction adds more than 90 of the
sources We derive a slope d log N dM  026  001 in
the range 16  Ks  22 Our corrected number counts are
in good agreement with those found by other authors in
the literature see Fig 6 This result together with what
was found in Paper I shows once more that we are able
to account for the biases introduced by the variable AO
PSF and that the data can therefore be reliably used for
further analysis

9 Comparison with galaxy evolution models
Most theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolu-
tion can be roughly divided into two broad categories
the so-called backwards approach and the ab initio
approach In the former approach Tinsley 1980 Yoshii 
G Cresci et al Galaxy morphology and evolution from SWAN Adaptive Optics imaging
Takahara 1988 Fukugita et al 1990 Rocca-Volmerange 
Guiderdoni 1990 Yoshii  Peterson 1995 Pozzetti et al
1996 1998 Jimenez  Kashlinsky 1999 Totani  Yoshii
2000 Totani et al 2001 the evolution is probed back-
wards into the past to predict observables such as galaxy
counts and redshift distributions The local properties of
galaxies like multi-band colors and chemical properties
are used to construct a reasonable model of the star for-
mation history and luminosity evolution of galaxies based
on the stellar population synthesis method The formation
epoch and merging history of galaxies however cannot
be predicted in this framework as they are introduced as
phenomenological parameters that can be inferred from
comparison with observational data
In the latter approach Kaumann et al 1993 Cole
et al 1994 2000 Somerville  Primack 1999 Nagashima
et al 2005 on the other hand the formation epoch and
merging history of galaxies are predicted by the standard
theory of structure formation in the CDM universe In
these models the local and high redshift properties of the
galaxies such as the luminosity function mass and size dis-
tribution are outputs of the model that can be compared
with observations However although the formation and
evolution of dark matter halos are considered to be rather
well understood our knowledge about baryonic processes
such as star formation supernova feedback and galaxy
merging is still very poor and a number of phenomeno-
logical parameters must be taken into account making
the comparison of the modeled and observed data more
complex Here we compare the galaxy counts in SWAN
and the size-magnitude relation of the detected galaxies
with representative results of these two radically dierent
approaches
91 The galaxy evolution models
The rst model used is a backwards pure luminosity evo-
lution PLE model developed by Totani  Yoshii 2000
and Totani et al 2001 based on the present-day proper-
ties of galaxies and their observed luminosity function It
evolves a systems luminosity and spectral energy distribu-
tion evolution backward in time using a standard galaxy
evolution model in which star formation is tuned to repro-
duce galaxies present-day colors and chemical properties
Arimoto  Yoshii 1987 Arimoto et al 1992 The model
includes the eects of both internal dust obscuration and
intergalactic H I absorption and it does not incorporate
galaxy mergers therefore the galaxy sizes and comoving
number density do not evolve The number density of
galaxies is normalized at z  0 using the local B-band
luminosity function of galaxies while the relation of the
present B luminosity and eective radius Re is determined
from power-law ts to the empirical relation observed for
local galaxies of dierent types Bender et al 1992 Impey
et al 1996 Galaxies are in fact classied into six mor-
phological types three of them Sab Sbc and Scd are
assigned to spiral galaxies while an Sdm model is used
for irregular galaxies Following Totani et al 2001 we
divided the ES0 galaxies into distinct population of gi-
ant ellipticals gE MB  17 and dwarf ellipticals dE
MB  17 It is known that these are two distinct popu-
lations showing dierent luminosity proles the r14 law
for giants and exponential for dwarfs see Barazza et al
2005 dierent luminosity-size relations luminosity func-
tions and dierent physical processes that govern the evo-
lution of each type see eg Ferguson  Binggeli 1994
and references therein Ilbert et al 2006 for evidence of
two dierent populations up to z  12
In the Ks band the critical separation magnitude
MB  17 corresponds to MKs  21 for the typical
color of elliptical galaxies Since the contribution of early-
type galaxies is more signicant in the near-infrared than
in the optical it is important to take into account such
distinct populations of elliptical galaxies in predicting the
Ks counts
In addition we compare the derived properties of the
SWAN galaxies with the predictions of the ab initio
Numerical Galaxy Catalog NuGC of Nagashima et al
2005 which is based on a semi-analytic SA model
of galaxy formation combined with high-resolution N -
body simulations in a CDM cosmological framework
The model includes several essential ingredients for galaxy
formation such as the merging histories of dark halos
directly derived from N -body simulations radiative gas
cooling star formation supernova feedback mergers of
galaxies population synthesis and extinction by internal
dust and intervening H I clouds The high resolution used
for the simulations with a minimum mass for dark halos
of 3  109 M is sucient to resolve their eective Jeans
It was shown by Nagashima et al 2005 that this
model is in reasonable agreement with several observa-
tional results like the luminosity functions in B and K
bands the H I mass function the size-magnitude relations
for local spirals and elliptical galaxies the Tully-Fisher
and Faber-Jackson relations at z  0 faint galaxy number
counts in BV Riz  bands and the cosmic star formation
history at high redshift In addition the model is able to
reproduce the distribution of R  KAB colors with red-
shift observed in GOODS Somerville et al 2004 includ-
ing extremely red R  KsAB  5 galaxies that other
semi-analytic treatments have trouble accounting for In
summary the model is able to reproduce several observa-
tional results for local and high-redshift galaxies not just
those that were used to tune the model parameters
92 Addressing cosmic variance
The uncertainties in galaxy number counts include contri-
butions from Poisson errors and from the so-called cosmic
variance due to the fact that galaxies are strongly clus-
tered and thus distributed in overdensities and large voids
on the sky Therefore we have to take into account the
corresponding eects on the relative normalizations of the
G Cresci et al Galaxy morphology and evolution from SWAN Adaptive Optics imaging

for those sources with 2
  2 in the GALFIT t right panel  with the PLE model solid line and the hierarchical
model dashed line predictions In the number counts the points at Ks  15 shows an excess due to a selection bias
as some elds were selected to contain more bright galaxies Counts from other surveys in the literature for Ks  16
were therefore plotted for comparison to the model in this range see Fig 6 for the references of the data points
The error bars on the number counts are the Poisson error while in the size-magnitude relation they represent the
standard error on the mean
predicted and observed counts in order to make a fair com-
parison According to Daddi et al 2000 the RMS uc-
tuations tot of numbers counts around their mean mean
value taking into account both the Poisson error and the
cosmic variance are given by
tot  X  1  X AC
where X are the total number counts A is the clustering
amplitude A  16  103 for the Daddi et al 2000
K-selected sample and C is a factor that depends on the
eld area and can be approximated by C  58 area04
for an area expressed in arcmin2 In our case as we ob-
serve galaxies in N  21 dierent elds of the same area
thus reducing the clustering uncertainty equation 2 can
be written as
tot  Xtot cid181 
ACcid19
where N is the number of elds Xtot is the total number
of sources detected in all the elds and C corresponds
to the area of a single eld Therefore we derive that the
relative uncertainty on the number counts is given by
for the SWAN elds while the contribution from Poisson
statistics would only be of the order of 5
We expect that the predictions of any successful model
should t the observed SWAN counts within a discrepancy
of this order of magnitude In good agreement with these
expectations we nd that a correction of 4 produces
the best match with the total number counts in the PLE
model while a correction of 1 provides the best match
to the hierarchical model The model predictions discussed
in the following sections have been renormalized accord-
ingly ie PLE and hierarchical model normalizations are
multiplied by 104 and 101 respectively
93 Comparison of the SWAN data with the model
predictions
The predictions of the PLE model for the galaxy counts
and galaxy size as a function of the Ks magnitude were
compared with the number counts and eective radii
Re observed in the SWAN images We are assuming for
the PLE model H0  70 km s1Mpc1 m  027
  73 and a formation redshift zF  5 for all galaxy
types Totani et al 2001 The comparison between the
PLE model and the total completeness corrected number
counts is shown in Fig 7a As explained in section 8 the
points at Ks  15 show an excess due to a selection bias as
some elds were selected to contain more bright galaxies
Counts from other surveys in the literature for Ks  16
were therefore plotted for comparison to the model in this
range and good agreement is found between the SWAN
galaxy counts and the PLE predictions
Figure 7b shows the average eective radius hlogRei
of the galaxies with the most reliable morphological t-
ting ie those t by GALFIT with 2
  2 The average
must take into account the selection eects due to the dif-
ferent detection probabilities of the galaxies We therefore
weighted each galaxy using its detection probability as de-

are not reliable points as explained in the legend of Fig 7
rived in section 8 The error bars show the standard error
on the mean The observed data points are compared with
the predictions of the PLE model which manifests a slight
overprediction of the galaxies Re This eect is mainly due
to the late-type galaxy population see Fig 10 for which
there might be hint of an increase in size and will be dis-
cussed in section 94 Our results conrm the nding of
Totani et al 2001 and Minowa et al 2005 who found
in the Subaru Deep Field and Subaru Super Deep Field
that a PLE model with no number or size evolution gives
the best t to their K-selected samples number counts
and isophotal area distribution
The NuGC hierarchical model is also compared with
the total galaxy counts and Re distribution for SWAN
in Fig 7 Within the observational uncertainties of the
shape of the observed luminosity functions Nagashima
et al 2005 adopted two dierent models characterized
by two dierent supernova feedback regimes their strong
supernova feedback SSFB model and weak supernova
feedback WSFB models Comparisons with the total
faint number counts and isophotal area distribution for
K-band selected galaxies in the Subaru Deep Field and
with redshift distributions for faint galaxies showed that
the SSFB model is in better agreement with the prop-
erties of the K-selected sample Nagashima et al 2002
Nagashima et al 2005 although the predicted counts
were overestimated for K  23 We therefore compare the
properties of the SWAN galaxies with the SSFB model
predictions only in the following A CDM cosmology is
used for the hierarchical model with m  03   07
and H0  70 km s1 Mpc1 As found by Nagashima et
al 2005 the model is in good agreement with the total
number counts data and matches the Re distribution in
SWAN as well as the PLE model
94 Morphological type dependent comparison
In addition to the total number counts and size-magnitude
relation our high-resolution AO morphological classica-
tion of the SWAN galaxies allows us to assess the predic-
tions of the models for the counts and sizes of the late
type and early type galaxies separately This is one of the
rst times such a comparison has been done in the near-
IR as both AO observations and accurate PSF modeling
are needed to obtain reliable morphological classication
of faint eld galaxies at these wavelengths We are there-
fore able to compare our observational data with untested
predictions of the two models
In Fig 8a the PLE model predictions for the number
counts of all galaxies with exponential proles spirals
irregulars and dwarf ellipticals are compared with the
observations for galaxies with Sersic index n  2 according
to GALFIT We nd good agreement between model and
data for the number counts as before A very similar result
is found using the hierarchical model prediction for late-
type galaxies
Fig 8b shows the predictions of both models for early-
type galaxies compared with the observations for n  2
galaxies in SWAN In the SWAN data the elliptical counts
are much atter than the late-type counts showing a
plateau for Ks  20 A much atter slope in the early-type
galaxies number counts with respect to the late-types was
found also by Teplitz et al 1998 using HST NICMOS
observations in the H band and in deep optical observa-
tions eg Abraham et al 1996 The adopted PLE model
is able to convincingly reproduce the plateau observed in
the counts for Ks  20 a similar behavior is predicted by
other PLE models see eg Pozzetti et al 1996 This
plateau is produced in the model by a combination of two
eects First the luminosity function of the gE population
G Cresci et al Galaxy morphology and evolution from SWAN Adaptive Optics imaging
through a major merger ie a merger with mass ratio
f  m1m2  03 in which it is assumed that all the cold
gas turns into stars and hot gas and all the stars populate
the bulge of a new galaxy Although it may be possible
to increase the number of bright ellipticals by changing
the model parameter that regulates the mass ratio distin-
guishing major from minor mergers it seems harder to
decrease the models number of Ks  20 ellipticals to the
level observed in SWAN Nagashima private communica-
tion In this case no separation is possible between the
gE and dE populations as all the major mergers produce
galaxies with a de Vaucouleurs prole
We note that misclassication of galaxies between the
two categories of early and late-type is not expected to
strongly aect these conclusions We expect only  10
of late-type to be misclassied as early-type and  10 of
early-type to be misclassied as late-type at Ks  21 see
Paper I Since at faint magnitudes the number counts
of spirals are  10 times higher than those of ellipticals
it is more likely that we are overestimating the number
of faint ellipticals in our sample Correcting for this bias
would make the discrepancy with the hierarchical model
even larger
We conclude that the PLE model better reproduces
the observed number counts of the SWAN galaxies In
Fig 9 the contributions of the dierent galaxy types
to the total observed number counts according to the
PLE model are shown The separation between the two
populations of dE and gE galaxies proves to be a key
element in reproducing the number counts separated by
morphological type on the basis of their light proles
In fact the number counts for exponential-like proles
would have been underestimated for Ks  20 and the
r14 proles number counts overestimated had the dE
galaxies been included in the early-type morphological
bin along with the gE galaxies This result conrms the
suggestions of Totani et al 2001 that such a separation
better reproduced the observed number counts in the
Subaru Deep Field for K  20 than a model with a single
elliptical population
In Fig 10 the observed size-magnitude distribution
discriminating between late-type and early-type galax-
ies is compared with the model predictions At bright
magnitudes the observed galaxies are smaller than the
model predictions for both early-type and late-type sam-
ples This discrepancy is likely due to an uncorrected sys-
tematic eect large Re  1 bright galaxies can be self-
subtracted in the reduction process as explained in sec-
tion 4 This phenomenon will reduce the apparent sizes of
sources although their integrated magnitudes and thus
their contributions to the number counts will be only
minimally aected
At faint magnitudes the models are able to repro-
duce the observed distributions for early-type galaxies
However the PLE model better reproduces the observed
distribution at fainter magnitudes where the hierarchical
model predicts more compact objects than are observed
Fig 9 Comparison of the total SWAN number counts
with the PLE model predictions The contributions of dif-
ferent galaxy types are shown as dierent thin lines while
the prediction for the total population of galaxies is shown
as a solid line The large open circles are not reliable as
explained in the caption of Fig 7
is bell-like see eg Totani et al 2001 and the number
of faint gEs decreases rapidly with decreasing luminosity
Second in the PLE model beyond z  15 giant ellipti-
cals are very faint due to heavy extinction in the model
  10 as described in Totani  Yoshii 2000 As a
result for Ks  20 corresponding to an L galaxy at
z  15 going to fainter magnitudes does not correspond
to an increase of the sampled volume Instead beyond
Ks  20 the model predicts we should begin to miss the
dusty high-redshift progenitors of todays ellipticals con-
sistent with the plateau observed in the SWAN data A
scenario in which massive z  15 ellipticals are highly
obscured by dust during their starburst phase and there-
fore produce the plateau observed in our K-band number
counts is consistent with the detection of very luminous
highly obscured submillimeter galaxies at high redshift
Blain et al 2002 and references therein In addition
galaxies with unusually red IR colors that have been mea-
sured in deep in near-IR observations can be explained
as primordial elliptical galaxies that are reddened by dust
and still in the starburst phase of their formation at z  3
eg Totani et al 2001
In contrast to the success of the PLE model the hier-
archical considerably underpredicts at bright magnitudes
Ks  20 and overpredicts at fainter magnitudes the ob-
served number counts In particular the observed plateau
in the early-type counts which was very well reproduced
in the PLE model is not expected at all in the hierar-
chical model predictions This disagreement implies that
the processes that produce an elliptical galaxy in at least
this particular hierarchical model are not adequate to de-
scribe reality In the model an elliptical galaxy is formed

predictions The error bars are the standard error on the mean no error bar is drawn for a bin with one galaxy
In contrast an oset may exist between both models
and the data for late-type galaxies which appear  30
smaller than predicted at faint magnitudes This oset is
what would be expected for modest growth in the sizes of
late-type galaxies In both of the models considered here
the sizes of disks for a given mass are almost independent
of the formation redshift This property is built into
any PLE model but even the hierarchical model by
Nagashima et al 2005 assumes that there is almost no
evolution in the stellar mass-size relation for disk galaxies
as suggested by the observations of Barden et al 2005
up to z  1 If our observed oset is really due to increses
in size in the late-type population the result would be
qualitatively consistent eg with the predictions of Mo
et al 1998 who estimated that disk galaxies forming
at z  1 are 50 smaller than disks forming at z  0
However the inclusion of galaxies with many dierent
redshifts masses and ML ratios in the faint bins of
Fig 10b prevents any robust quantitative conclusion
Our nding that pure luminosity evolution of galaxies
is favored for a Ks-selected sample up to Ks  22 with-
out evidence of relevant number evolution even when sep-
arating between late and early-type galaxies is consistent
with other results For example Truijllo et al 2005 used
deep near-infrared images from the FIRES survey com-
bined with GEMS and SDSS data to conrm that the ob-
served size-magnitude relation evolution out to z  17 for
late-type objects matches very well the expected evolution
for Milky-Way type objects from infall models while for
spheroid-like objects the evolution of the luminosity-size
relation was found to be consistent with pure luminosity
evolution of a fading galaxy population McIntosh et al
2005 studied a large sample of early-type galaxies from
the GEMS survey nding that the luminosity-size and
stellar mass-size relations evolve in a manner that is con-
sistent with the passive aging of ancient stellar population
Papovich et al 2005 suggest that passive evolution can
account for the observed luminosity-size relation at z  1
with merging becoming important at higher redshifts
10 Conclusions
In this paper we have presented new results from a high
resolution adaptive optics assisted morphological study of
21 elds from SWAN the Survey of a Wide Area with
NACO The PSF model derived in Paper I was used in
combination with GALFIT to classify the SWAN galaxies
into the two classes of early and late type and to de-
rive eective radii Re of 383 galaxies A detailed study of
the detection probability as a function of the magnitude
Sersic index eective radius eld and distance from the
guide star was performed in order to take careful account
of the selection eects aecting our sample The results
were used to compute the completeness-corrected num-
ber counts and to derive the average Re as a function of
magnitude
The number counts and size-magnitude relation for the
total galaxy population and for early and late-type sep-
arately were compared with both a modied version of
the pure luminosity evolution model of Totani  Yoshii
2000 and with the a priori hierarchical model developed
by Nagashima et al 2005 We have shown in section 9
that while the hierarchical model can convincingly repro-
duce the counts of late-type galaxies it is not consistent
with the observed number counts of elliptical galaxies se-
lected in the Ks band On the other hand the PLE model
can reasonably reproduce both the late and early type
count distributions for the SWAN galaxies We have com-
pared the size-magnitude distribution of the galaxies with
G Cresci et al Galaxy morphology and evolution from SWAN Adaptive Optics imaging
the predictions of the models nding that there might be
some hint of increased size for the late-type galaxy popula-
tion Both models are consistent with the observed distri-
bution for early-type galaxies although the PLE model
seems to better reproduce the observed distribution at
fainter magnitudes Our work therefore favors pure lumi-
nosity evolution of early-type galaxies for a Ks-selected
sample up to Ks  22 In contrast our results show that a
representative example of currently available models based
on the hierarchical galaxy formation theory is not able
to reproduce the observed properties of faint Ks-selected
early-type galaxies in the near-IR
These results illustrate the importance of obtaining re-
liable morphological classications for better constraining
the details of galaxy formation and evolution models and
demonstrate the unique power of AO observations to ex-
tend such work to faint galaxies in the near-IR
