ABSTRACT
We examine the relation between surface brightness velocity dispersion and sizethe fundamental
planefor quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts in the COSMOS eld The COSMOS sample
consists of  150 massive quiescent galaxies with an average velocity dispersion   250 km s1 and
redshifts between 02  z  08 More than half of the galaxies in the sample are compact The
COSMOS galaxies exhibit a tight relation  01 dex scatter between surface brightness velocity
dispersion and size At a xed combination of velocity dispersion and size the COSMOS galaxies are
brighter than galaxies in the local universe These surface brightness osets are correlated with the
rest-frame g  z color and Dn4000 index bluer galaxies and those with smaller Dn4000 indices have
larger osets Stellar population synthesis models indicate that the massive COSMOS galaxies are
younger and therefore brighter than similarly massive quiescent galaxies in the local universe Passive
evolution alone brings the massive compact quiescent COSMOS galaxies onto the local fundamental
plane at z  0 Therefore evolution in size or velocity dispersion for massive compact quiescent
galaxies since z  1 is constrained by the small scatter observed in the fundamental plane We
conclude that massive compact quiescent galaxies at z  1 are not a special class of objects but rather
the tail of the mass and size distribution of the normal quiescent galaxy population

1 INTRODUCTION
Observations of the structural properties of galax-
ies across cosmic time are critical for understanding
how galaxies form and evolve Most massive galax-
ies observed in the universe are not actively forming
stars ie
they are quiescent Quiescent galaxies ex-
ist at z  4 Fontana et al 2009 and begin to dom-
inate the massive galaxy population at z  2  3
Ilbert et al 2013 Muzzin et al 2013 The massive qui-
escent galaxies observed at z  2 have eective radii
that are on average smaller than the local massive quies-
cent galaxy population Daddi et al 2005 Trujillo et al
2007 Zirm et al 2007 Toft et al 2007 Buitrago et al
2008 van Dokkum et al 2008 Damjanov et al 2011
van der Wel et al 2014
It is not clear whether the
observed average size growth of quiescent galaxies since
z  2 is due to the growth of individual galaxies eg
Cimatti et al 2008 Taylor et al 2010 or to the addition
of larger galaxies to the quiescent galaxy population at
later times eg Valentinuzzi et al 2010 Cassata et al
2011 2013 Carollo et al 2013
Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to ex-
plain the origin and evolution of massive compact quies-
cent MCQ galaxies Compact galaxies may form at z 
2 from gas-rich major mergers Khochfar  Silk 2006
andor instabilities in clumpy disks Elmegreen et al
2008 Dekel  Burkert 2014 At late times they may
also form from tidal
interactions Bekki et al 2001
Chilingarian et al 2009 They can grow in size through
minor mergers and accretion van der Wel et al 2009
Naab et al 2009 Shih  Stockton 2011 Newman et al
2012 andor
feedback driven adiabatic expansion
Fan et al 2008 2010 These growth mechanisms are
evoked to account for both the larger average size of qui-
escent galaxies today as compared to z  2 and the pu-
tative dearth of MCQ galaxies in the local universe
The number density of MCQ galaxies in the local uni-
verse probed by Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS is ap-
parently 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than at z  12
Trujillo et al 2009 Taylor et al 2010 These estimates
are consistent with an evolutionary scenario where MCQ
galaxies form at high redshift and the number density
rapidly declines as they grow in size since z  1 eg
van Dokkum et al 2010 Newman et al 2012 How-
ever number density estimates of MCQ galaxies in dense
regions in the local universe Valentinuzzi et al 2010
Poggianti et al 2013 and some studies at intermedi-
ate redshifts Carollo et al 2013 Damjanov et al 2014
Damjanov et al 2015 submitted hereafter Paper I nd
no rapid decline
Instead these studies show that the
number density of MCQ galaxies remains roughly con-
stant since z  1 Thus MCQ galaxies may not sig-
nicantly grow in size since z  1 or they may be pro-
duced at a rate that compensates for their growth The
relation between structural and kinematic properties of
MCQ galaxies may provide important clues for under-
standing their origin and evolution Here we examine
the fundamental plane ie the relation between surface
brightness central velocity dispersion and eective ra-
dius for a sample of MCQ galaxies at 02  z  08
Galaxies
equilibrium show a relation
in virial
between luminosity
size and velocity dispersion
Djorgovski  Davis 1987 and Dressler et al 1987
rst demonstrated that quiescent galaxies in the lo-
cal universe exhibit a tight correlation between surface
brightness eective radius and velocity dispersionthe
fundamental plane FP The scatter in the FP is small
 005 dex Bernardi et al 2003 Saulder et al 2013
and the FP appears to extend across all early-type galax-
ies in the local universe Misgeld  Hilker 2011
The physical basis of the FP is the virial equilibrium
of stellar systems dynamically supported by random mo-
tions The observed properties of surface brightness ef-
fective radius and velocity dispersion serve as proxies for
the virial mass density virial radius and virial velocity
respectively As such the FP is tilted relative to the ex-
pected virial relation eg Bernardi et al 2003 and the
FP evolves with redshift Treu et al 2005 Holden et al
2010 Saglia et al 2010 Fernandez Lorenzo et al 2011
van de Sande et al 2014 Some of the evolution ob-
served in the FP may possibly be attributed to evo-
lution in the ratio between stellar and dynamical
mass Beiori et al 2014 Peralta de Arriba et al 2014
though this is not the dominant eect
We examine the fundamental plane for massive com-
pact quiescent galaxies at z  1
In Section 2 we de-
scribe the data and methods and Section 3 contains the
results We discuss the results in Section 4 and we con-
clude in Section 5 We adopt the standard cosmology
H0 m   70 km s1 Mpc1 03 07 AB mag-
nitudes and a Chabrier 2003 IMF
2 DATA AND METHODS
21 Data Selection
We examine galaxies in the 16 deg2 COSMOS
eld Scoville et al 2007 All galaxies that we se-
lect in the COSMOS eld have HST ACS imaging
Koekemoer et al 2007 UV to IR multi-band pho-
tometry Ilbert et al 2013 and references therein and
SDSSBOSS spectroscopy to the SDSS and BOSS sur-
vey magnitude limits of r  1777 and i  199 re-
spectively Ahn et al 2014 We cross reference objects
that have structural parameters given in the morphology
catalog of Sargent et al 20071 multi-band photometry
from the catalog of Ilbert et al 20132 and SDSSBOSS
spectroscopy by position matching objects within a 05
arcsecond radius We select galaxies in the intermediate
redshift range 02  z  08 classied as quiescent by
Ilbert et al 2013 based on a rest-frame color-color se-
lection N U V  r versus r  J These selection criteria
yield a sample of 161 galaxies
We require robust measurements of velocity disper-
sions in order to derive the FP From the cross-matched
sample of 161 galaxies we select galaxies with velocity
dispersions  70 km s1 and velocity dispersion errors
 100 km s1 From examination of the spectra we
nd that two galaxies in the sample have strong emis-
sion lines Both galaxies exhibit emission line ratios con-
sistent with active galactic nuclei Baldwin et al 1981
Kaumann et al 2003 Kewley et al 2006 We remove
these two galaxies from the sample The nal sample
from which we derive the FP consists of 148 galaxies
We refer to this sample as the COSMOS sample

In Section 23 we investigate sample selection bias The
most restrictive selection is imposed by the SDSSBOSS
spectroscopic target selection To assess the eects of
this selection we compare the COSMOS sample of 148
galaxies with a sample of quiescent galaxies in the COS-
MOS eld with measured spectroscopic redshifts com-
piled from publicly available data Davies et al 2015
We restrict the comparison sample to galaxies with HST
size measurements stellar masses  1010M and red-
shifts in the range of 02  z  08 This larger sample
consists of 2970 galaxies
22 Measured Properties
The SDSS team derives redshifts and velocity disper-
sions according to Bolton et al 2012 Redshifts are de-
termined from tting template spectra at a range of trial
redshifts The central velocity dispersion is determined
by comparing the observed spectra with model spectra
which are redshifted to the galaxy redshift and convolved
to the instrument resolution Each model spectra is suc-
cessively broadened to larger velocity dispersions in steps
of 25 km s1 The best-t velocity dispersion is deter-
mined by tting for the velocity dispersion at the mini-
mum chi-squared based on the measured chi-squared val-
ues at each 25 km s1 broadening step
We correct the velocity dispersion measured in the 2
BOSS and 3 SDSS apertures to the measured ef-
fective radius using the Jorgensen et al 1995 see their
Equation 2 correction The median correction applied
to the sample is 004 dex The typical error in the ve-
locity dispersion for the COSMOS sample is  30 km
s1 Figure 1A and 1B show the redshift and corrected
velocity dispersion distribution respectively
To constrain the stellar population age we measure
the Dn4000 index directly from the SDSS spectra The
Dn4000 index is an age sensitive spectral feature dened
as the ratio of ux in two spectral windows adjacent to
the 4000A break for denition see Balogh et al 1999
The eective radii of galaxies in the COSMOS sample
are measured from HST ACS imaging by Sargent et al
2007 The  01 HST resolution corresponds to a
physical length of  07 kpc at z  075 Sargent et al
2007 t each surface brightness prole with a single
Sersic 1968 prole model using GIM2D Simard et al
2002 The formal uncertainty on size is typically  0005
dex Because these errors are small we ignore the un-
certainty in size We correct the measured semi-major
half-light radius to the circularized averaged half-light
eective radius given by
Re  a50r b
where a50 is the semi-major half-light radius and b
the semi minor-to-major axis ratio van der Wel et al
2014 nd that galaxy sizes depend on the wavelength
of observation In order to compare with the local g-band
FP we correct the galaxy sizes to the rest-frame g-band
eective wavelength   4686A Stoughton et al 2002
using the correction given by van der Wel et al 2014
see their Equation 2 The circularized and color cor-
rected radius is typically  004 dex smaller on average
than the measured semi-major eective radius This cor-
rection does not change any of the major conclusions of
Fig 1 A Redshift B velocity dispersion C circularized half-light radius and D surface brightness distribution of the 148 galaxies
in the COSMOS sample
this work In Figure 1C we show the corrected eective
radius distribution for the COSMOS sample
We determine the surface brightness in the SDSS
rest-frame g r i zbands by synthesizing photometry in
these bands from the measured multi-band UV to IR
SED We determine k-corrected and reddening corrected
magnitudes by tting stellar population synthesis mod-
els of Bruzual  Charlot 2003 to the observed spectral
energy distribution using the LePHARE3 code written
by Arnout S  Ilbert O for details see Arnouts et al
1999 Ilbert et al 2006
The surface brightness in mag arcsec2 is
e  m  5 logre  25 log2  10 log1  z
where m is the reddening and k-corrected magnitude re
is the radius measured in arcseconds and the nal term is
the cosmological surface brightness dimming correction
We convert the surface brightness to Ie measured in L
pc2 using
logcid18
L pc2cid19  04cid18M  21572 
mag arcsec2cid19 
where M  5124 is the gband solar absolute magni-
tude The stellar mass in LePHARE represents the scale
factor between the best-t SED and the observed lumi-
nosity the error estimate accounts for observational and
some systematic uncertainties associated with the SED
tting procedure The typical observational uncertainty
on stellar masses is  01 dex though the systematic er-
rors may be larger eg Conroy  Gunn 2010 We adopt
01 dex as the error estimate on surface brightness In
Figure 1D we show the surface brightness distribution
of the COSMOS sample The results are independent
of the photometric band For ease of comparison with
previous results the analysis and results are based on
the rest-frame gband surface brightness We give the
measured and derived sample properties in Table 1
For the local benchmark we compare with the orthog-
onal t FP derived by Hyde  Bernardi 2009 HB09

hereafter using  50 000 galaxies in the SDSS We an-
ticipate that some of the evolution in the FP is due to
passive evolution of galaxies eg Treu et al 2005 so we
rewrite the HB09 FP in terms of surface brightness

Here e and Re are measured in km s1 and kpc respec-
tively We convert the FP parameters from HB09 into
surface brightness units of L pc2 The best-t param-
eters for the local gband FP are A  184 B  131
and C  096
There is no single denition for compact galaxies We
identify galaxies as compact using the Barro et al 2013

the galaxies in Table 1 are compact
23 Sample Bias
Figure 2A shows the surface brightness distribution
as a function of size for the COSMOS sample blue
stars relative to a similarly selected comparison sample
black points see Section 21 for details of sample selec-
tion The COSMOS sample is biased towards the largest
galaxies and at a xed size the selected sample populates
the high surface brightness envelope of the full sample
distribution Figures 2B and 2C show the absolute g-
band magnitude and size as a function of redshift re-
spectively The brightest and largest objects are selected
across the redshift range The COSMOS sample is sub-
ject to the SDSSBOSS target selection and the limits of
SDSSBOSS spectroscopy the SDSSBOSS target selec-
tion criteria lead to a selection bias towards high surface
brightness galaxies Furthermore as expected Figure
2B shows that increasingly brighter galaxies are selected
with increasing redshift Because of the SDSSBOSS tar-
get selection the galaxies in the COSMOS sample are
drawn from the massive high surface brightness tail of

persion of the data and do not account for observational
uncertainties
32 Quiescent Evolution
Here we demonstrate that the surface brightness osets
of COSMOS galaxies relative to the local galaxy popu-
lation Figure 3 can be explained by simple quiescent
evolution We dene the surface brightness osets as the
dierence between the observed galaxy surface bright-
ness of the COSMOS sample and the surface brightness
calculated from the best-t local FP

sion eective radius and surface brightness for the 148
galaxies in the COSMOS sample The red points indicate

ies in the sample typically have higher surface brightness

sets Both the rest-frame g  z color and the Dn4000

which have spectral resolution comparable to the SDSS
We model a galaxy with constant star formation rate of
 400 M yr1 for 1 Gyr at solar metallicity The star
formation rate is set to match the median stellar mass
of the COSMOS sample For a constant metallicity and
constant and continuous star formation history evolu-
tion of the g  z color Dn4000 index and the relative
evolution of the luminosity only depend on the duration
of star formation We tried star formation histories that
spanned 05 - 2 Gyr in duration with similar results The
only free parameter in the model is the formation red-
We constrain the formation redshift of the model
galaxy by tting the median rest-frame g  z color and
Dn4000 index distribution of the COSMOS sample Fig-
ures 4A and 4B show the rest-frame g  z color and
Dn4000 index as a function of redshift respectively In
each panel the black points and red stars are the respec-
tive properties of individual galaxies in the COSMOS
sample The orange points are the median of the respec-
tive properties in 10 equally populated bins of redshift
and the errors are bootstrapped The dashed blue curves
show the FSPS model The rest-frame g  z color and
Dn4000 index distributions of the COSMOS sample are
broadly consistent with a passively evolving galaxy which
began star formation at z  17 and ceased star forma-
tion at z  13 This redshift interval corresponds to 1

tion of redshift The black points and red stars are FP

local fundamental plane relation from HB09 The red points are
compact galaxies
contributes to these trends see Section 23 Thus mere
quiescent evolution contributes to the observed oset be-
tween the COSMOS sample and the local FP
The luminosity of a quiescent galaxy decreases as it
passively evolves To quantify this eect we model
a passively evolving galaxy using the Flexible Stellar
Population Synthesis FSPS model Conroy et al 2009
Conroy  Gunn 2010 FSPS generates both synthetic
photometry and spectra as a function of time for an in-
put star formation and metallicity history We model
The bootstrapped errors on the median are propagated
through to the t parameters We refer to this rela-
tion as the luminosity evolution correction The dashed
blue curve is the gband luminosity of the FSPS model
galaxy normalized to the median gband luminosity of
the COSMOS sample Lg  10109L The FP osets
plotted in Figure 4C are relative to the local relation
The consistency between the change in luminosity of a
passively evolving galaxy and the FP osets means that
passive luminosity evolution alone accounts for the oset
between the FP we derive from the COSMOS data and
the local FP from HB09 dashed and solid line in Figure
3 respectively
To demonstrate that passive evolution alone is su-
cient to explain the oset of the COSMOS sample from
the local FP we apply the luminosity evolution correc-
tion given by Equation 7 to the data We emphasize that
this evolution correction is consistent with the luminos-
ity evolution of a passively evolving galaxy which ceased
star-formation at z  13 see Figure 4C Figure 5 shows
the FP for the COSMOS sample brought to z  0 by ac-
counting for the quiescent luminosity evolution shown in
Figure 4 The scatter of the data in Figure 5 is  015
dex Based on the observational uncertainties in velocity
dispersion  007 dex and luminosity  01 dex the
intrinsic scatter is  01 dex The luminosity corrected
data are consistent with the local FP Passive evolution
of galaxies in the COSMOS sample is sucient to place
them on the local FP by z  0
4 DISCUSSION
We examine the FP for a sample of galaxies spanning
the redshift range of 02  z  08 Due to the strong
selection bias towards high surface brightness objects
MCQ galaxies comprise a large fraction of the COSMOS
sample we examine Passive evolution alone brings the
COSMOS sample onto the local FP by z  0 The phys-
ical basis of the fundamental plane is the virial equilib-
rium of quiescent galaxies Thus we conclude that MCQ
galaxies are virialized systems
Several studies examining the FP at intermediate and
high redshifts have recognized the importance of evo-
lution of stellar populations Treu et al 2005 report
that osets from the fundamental plane for galaxies in
the redshift range of 02  z  12 are anti-correlated
with stellar mass lower mass galaxies have larger osets
They attribute these trends to downsizing Lower mass
galaxies are younger and therefore have smaller mass-
to-light ML ratios To account for evolution of stel-
lar populations and varying ML ratios Bezanson et al
2013 derive the mass FP substituting stellar mass
surface density for surface brightness
In contrast to
the observed osets in the FP they nd very small o-
set between the mass FP at z  2 and the local rela-
tion van de Sande et al 2014 quantify the evolution
of the zero-point of the FP out to z  2 They nd that
logMLg  049  003z
We conclude that the FP osets are due to the evo-
In particular we nd
lution of stellar populations
that passive evolution alone can bring galaxies in the
COSMOS sample onto the local FP relation Thus
logIeg  logMLg Based on comparisons of
our data with stellar population synthesis models we de-
termine that logIeg  069  012z see Equation
7 The evolution we measure is consistent 15 with
evolution reported by van de Sande et al 2014 also see
references therein We note however that both studies
are biased towards bluer objects and therefore the re-
ported evolution may not be representative of the quies-
cent galaxy population In general our results are qual-
itatively consistent with previous studies examining the
evolution of the FP The novel aspect of this work is
that it demonstrates that MCQ galaxies follow the same
evolutionary trends as the general quiescent galaxy pop-
ulation
Due to the SDSSBOSS target selection COSMOS
galaxies examined in this study are outliers in the re-
lation between stellar mass and size However the stel-
lar population and kinematics of MCQ galaxies in the
COSMOS sample are consistent with the local quiescent
galaxy population Thus we conclude that MCQ galax-
ies at 02  z  08 represent the extreme of the mass and
size distribution of normal quiescent galaxies see Figure
2 and are not a unique class of objects Saulder et al
2015 reach similar conclusions based on a larger sample
culled from the literature
Recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations sug-
gest that compact galaxies at z  2 do not form
from unique physical mechanisms but rather are sub-
ject to the same formation processes as other galaxies
Wellons et al 2014 Thus both the origin and evolu-
tion of MCQ galaxies appear to be consistent with the
conclusion that compact galaxies are the tail of the nor-
mal galaxy distribution
If MCQ galaxies at z  1 passively evolve with lit-
tle or no size growth their descendants should be iden-
tiable among the local galaxy population However
the number density evolution of compact galaxies since
z  1 remains unsettled
Several studies based on
the SDSS claim that the number density of compact
galaxies drops dramatically in the local universe eg
Shen et al 2003 Trujillo et al 2009 Taylor et al 2010
Cassata et al 2013 This has lead to the suggestion
that they grow signicantly since z  1  2 If this is the
case the small scatter in the FP at z  1 means that
any growth mechanism ostensibly moves galaxies along
not o the FP Additionally if galaxies do grow in size
the results of this study provide empirical constraints for
theoretical analysis of galaxy growth see for example
Hopkins et al 2010 However it is possible that com-
pact galaxies today are preferentially found in environ-
ments that are incompletely sampled by the SDSS see
Taylor et al 2010 Thus their number densities may be
systematically underestimated in the local universe
In contrast to studies reporting a rapid decline in the
number density of compact galaxies at z  1 several
studies nd that the number density remains roughly
constant eg Valentinuzzi et al 2010 Poggianti et al
2013 Carollo et al 2013 Damjanov et al 2014 The
results of our companion paper Paper I are consistent
with this conclusion In this case either galaxies do not
grow in size or compact galaxies are produced at a rate
that compensates for their growth
Carollo et al 2013 conclude that evolution in the
mass-size relation is dominated by newly formed quies-
cent galaxies ie progenitor bias They argue that a sce-
nario where individual galaxies grow and new compact
galaxies form at z  1 is inconsistent with the fact that
Figure 5 shows that once we apply the evolutionary
correction to luminosity given by Equation 7 the FP we
derive from the COSMOS sample is consistent with the
local relation However we have applied only an average
correction for evolution which does not account for stellar
population variations amongst galaxies at any particular
redshift and the scatter in Figure 4 highlights the fact
that quiescent galaxies are a heterogenous population
The selection bias of our sample complicates the analy-
sis of any residual osets between our evolved sample and
the local FP Figure 5 A complete spectroscopic sam-
ple combined with sophisticated modeling of individual
galaxies will allow for more robust and detailed kinematic
studies
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We examine the relation between surface brightness
velocity dispersion and sizethe fundamental planefor
a sample of massive compact quiescent galaxies in the
COSMOS eld spanning the redshift range of 02  z 
08 Based on analysis of this COSMOS sample we show
 Massive compact galaxies at z  1 populate a tight
fundamental plane relation similar to the general
population of quiescent galaxies in the local uni-
verse This reects the fact that massive compact
galaxies are in virial equilibrium
 We compare the COSMOS sample to a model of
a passively evolving galaxy The average proper-
ties of the COSMOS sample are consistent with a
galaxy which started star formation at z  17 and
ceased star formation at z  13 Accounting for
passive evolution of the surface brightness brings
the COSMOS sample onto the z  0 fundamental
 The data suggest that massive compact quiescent
galaxies at z  1 are not a special class of objects
they are the high mass high surface brightness tail
of the normal quiescent galaxy population
In Paper I we show that the number density of com-
pact galaxies remains constant for z  1 This study
Paper II concludes that the compact galaxy popula-
tion is the tail of the normal galaxy population These
studies taken together demonstrate the potential of com-
bining abundance structural and kinematic analyses for

Fig 6 Rest-frame g  z color as a function of redshift for the
COSMOS sample blue stars and the comparison sample black
points The blue and orange points are the median rest-frame gz
color in equally populated bins of redshift and the blue and orange
lines are ts to the median color for the COSMOS sample and the
comparison sample respectively The error bars are bootstrapped
compact galaxies are systematically redder at lower red-
shifts suggesting that the population is aging over time
and that the normal quiescent galaxy population is bluer
than compact galaxies indicating that the regular pop-
ulation has more recently shutdown star formation as
compared to the compact population
Figure 6 compares the rest-frame g  z color of the
selected COSMOS sample dominated by MCQ galax-
ies with the comparison COSMOS sample see Section
21 for sample description The data are broadly con-
sistent with the interpretation of Carollo et al 2013
MCQ galaxies are redder at late times and redder than
the normal quiescent galaxy population However we
note that the scatter in the rest-frame g  z color and
Dn4000 index is large there are galaxies in the selected
COSMOS sample that have colors and Dn4000 indices
consistent with younger stellar populations A combina-
tion of progenitor bias and individual galaxy growth may
be the basis for the evolution of the mass-size relation
Moreover given the strong selection bias in the selected
COSMOS sample we probe only the extreme end of the
mass distribution Spectroscopically complete samples
at z  1 will provide important constraints for the role
of progenitor bias and individual galaxy growth in the
evolution of the mass-size relation
Comparison of the COSMOS sample with a model of
a passively evolving galaxy shows that on average the
data are consistent with a galaxy which formed stars
from z  17 to z  13 However we emphasize the
galaxies in the COSMOS sample span a broad range
of ages and star formation histories contributing to the
large scatter in the rest-frame g  z color and Dn4000
index Figure 4A and 4B respectively The best-t
z  17 formation redshift is the average formation red-
shift of the sample
