ABSTRACT
Using the semi-analytic models based on the Millennium simulation we trace back the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies
residing in progenitors of groups classied by the magnitude gap at redshift zero We determine the luminosity function of galaxies
within 025R200 05R200 and R200 for galaxy groupsclusters The bright end of the galaxy luminosity function of fossil groups shows
a signicant evolution with redshift with changes in M by  1-2 mag between z  05 and z  0 for the central 05R200 suggesting
that the formation of the most luminous galaxy in a fossil group has had a signicant impact on the M galaxies eg it is formed as
a result of multiple mergers of M galaxies within the last 5 Gyr In contrast the slope of the faint end  of the luminosity function
shows no considerable redshift evolution and the number of dwarf galaxies in the fossil groups exhibits no evolution unlike in non-
fossil groups where it grows by  25  42 towards low redshifts In agreement with previous studies we also show that fossil groups
accumulate most of their halo mass earlier than non-fossil groups Selecting the fossils at a redshift of 1 and tracing them to a redshift
0 we show that 80 of the fossil groups 1013 Mh1  M200  1014 Mh1 will lose their large magnitude gaps However about
40 of fossil clusters M200  1014 M h1 will retain their large gaps

discovered by Ponman et al
ber of studies have revealed that
these systems exhibit
interesting properties compared to similar normal groups
and clusters eg Vikhlinin et al 1999 Jones et al 2003

According to the rst
formal denition presented by
Jones et al 2003 a fossil group of galaxies is identied as an
extended X-ray source with LXbol 213 1042 h2
50 ergs1 that
includes a luminous elliptical galaxy with at least two magni-
tude dierence in the R-band from the second brightest galaxy
located within half the virial radius
Jones et al
2003 reported 8 to 20  of all galaxy
groups have the same X-ray luminosity as fossil groups The
redshift evolution of the fossil fraction has been studied by
Gozaliasl et al 2014 nding that fossil groups constitute 22 
6 and 137 of massive galaxy groups M200  10135Mh1
at z  06 and 06  z  12 respectively In the semi-analytic
halo catalogue based on the Millennium simulation 7202

2014 Mulchaey  Zabludo 1999 portrayed a fossil group
as a failed group in which the majority of the baryonic
materials were used in building up the giant elliptical galaxy
rather than in several massive L galaxies In contrast following
1989 number of studies have suggested that the
central elliptical galaxy in a fossil group forms because of
multiple mergers of massive galaxies in groups in a few tenths
of a Hubble time For this to be a viable formation scenario
we expect fossil groups to present a luminosity function LF
with a decit of L galaxies The key lies in the timescale for
the merging of dwarf galaxies and cooling group X-ray halo
Ponman  Bertram 1993 Ponman et al 1994 which is much
longer than the timescale for the merging of more luminous
galaxies The nal product of these mergers are present day
isolated ellipticals which are immersed in group size X-ray
halos and surrounded by substantially fainter galaxies eg
Ponman et al 1994 DOnghia et al 2005 DOnghia et al

dark matter mass at above z 1 having enough time to merge
L galaxies and increase the magnitude gap between the rst
and second brightest group galaxies Using the Millennium
simulations Dariush et al

accumulated a larger fraction of their nal halo mass at any red-
shift earlier than non-fossil groups of similar X-ray luminosity

their large magnitude gap due to the infall of luminous galaxies
suggesting that the fossil phase is an evolutionary stage of a
galaxy group Supporting this suggestion we show that some
fossil groups in our XMM-CFHTLS galaxy groups catalogue at
06  z  12 include few galaxies outside the 05R200 which
are brighter than the second brightest galaxy used for magnitude
gap calculation Gozaliasl et al 2014
the large magnitude gap in fossil groups is the result of an evo-
lutionary eect and the extreme merger ratio of galaxies within
these systems Moreover Miraghaei et al 2014 have reported
on the radio properties of the brightest group galaxies in fos-
sil groups in which they discover that such galaxies are under-
luminous in radio compared to non-fossil group galaxies of sim-
ilar stellar mass
Eigenthaler  Zeilinger 2013 determined at metallicity
gradients for six fossil galaxies in contrast to the steep slope
predicted by a monolithic collapse suggesting multiple merg-
ers of galaxies for the formation of fossil groups Recently fol-
lowing the fossil group origins project Aguerri et al 2011
Zarattini et al 2014 and Girardi et al 2014 carried out a
multi-wavelength study of a sample of 34 fossil group candi-
dates revealing that the brightest group galaxy BGG in a fossil
group forms from the mergercannibalism of the L galaxies and
We aim to use the semi-analytic model SAM of Guo et al
2011 hereafter G11 to study the composite LF of galaxies in
fossil and non-fossil groups down to an absolute magnitude of
15 mag We use a well-dened mass-selected sample of galaxy
groups and clusters at redshift zero and trace these halos and
their properties up to z  1 In order to nd any eect of galaxy
mergers on the composite LF of galaxies in fossil groups we
examine evolution of the luminosity of the bright end and the
faint end slope as a function of redshift within a redshift range of

catalogue
The SAM of galaxy formation used in G11 is implemented on
the stored output of a very large cosmological N-body simula-
tion the Millennium simulation Springel et al 2005 The Mil-
lennium simulation assumes a CDM cosmology with param-
eters m b  n 8 h  025 0045 075 1 09 073
based on a combined analysis of the 2dFGRS Colless et al
2001 and the rst-year WMAP data Spergel et al 2003 De-
spite the fact that these values not the most recent results eg
WMAP7 and Planck Colabration XVI 2013 they correctly re-
produce the group abundance and clustering of dark halos at low-
z The 8 value is higher in the Millennium simulation than in the
WMAP7 results This generally results in a discrepancy in the
size and the luminosity density of the structures Tavasoli et al
2013 While this might have an eect on the space density of
fossil groups the present study focuses on the evolution of the
composite luminosity function based on SAMs between z  1
and the present day Guo et al 2013 implement SAM on both
Millennium and Millennium II simulations in two cosmologies
based on WMAP1 and WMAP7 to investigate how the for-
mation evolution and clustering of galaxies vary in dierent
cosmologies The increased matter density and decreased linear
uctuation amplitude 8 in WMAP7 have compensating eects
so that the abundance and clustering of dark halos are predicted
to be very similar to those in WMAP1 for z 6 3 Therefore the
main ndings of our study should remain intact
The Millennium simulation traces 21603 particles with typ-
ical masses of 118  109 M from redshift 127 to the present
day A friends-of-friends FOF algorithm is used to identify
groups by linking particles with separation less than  02 the
mean inter-particle separation Davis et al 1985 Identication
of the sub-halos in each FOF group is done using the SUBFIND
algorithm Springel et al 2001 The G11 is an updated and
extended version of earlier galaxy formation models based on
the Millennium simulation Springel et al 2005 Croton et al
2006 De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 To estimate photometric prop-
erties of galaxies G11 uses a Chabrier IMF and stellar popula-
tion synthesis model from Bruzual  Charlot 2003
Following White  Frenk 1991 G11 denes a cooling ra-
dius as the radius within which the cooling time of the gas equals
the current age of the halo and compares it with the virial ra-
dius Rvir If the virial radius becomes smaller than the cool-
ing radius the gas is accreted on the central galaxy on a free-
fall timescale rapid infall regime Conversely if the virial ra-
dius becomes larger than the cooling radius cooling occurs in a
statistic cooling ow G11 utilizes a new prescription for satel-
lite galaxies when a galaxy passes outside Rvir it is no longer
subject to the tidal and ram-pressure forces The gas stripping
from satellites is gradual allowing the star formation to con-
tinue Thus in this model satellite galaxies can stay blue for
longer periods G11 also includes starbursts triggered by a ma-
jor merger associated with the mass ratio of the merging pro-
genitors in excess of 03 When a major merger occurs all of
the stellar masses of the merging galaxies are transformed to the
bulge while only a fraction of cold gas is turned into the bulge
stars in accordance to the implementation of Somerville et al
2001 This model also includes the satellite-satellite mergers
and the disruption of satellite galaxies in presence of strong tidal
forces which can reduce the number of satellite and dwarf galax-
ies which are generally overpredicted by the most SAMs in
massive halos G11 uses a new disc model that separately al-
lows the gas and stellar discs to grow continuously in mass and
angular momentum A velocity dependent model of supernovae
feedback model is adopted in G11 G11 model also implements
both radio and quasar modes of the active galactic nuclei AGN
feedback following Croton et al 2006 It also allowed the ra-
dio mode of AGN feedback to occur in satellite galaxies
22 Denitionoffossilgroupsandsampleselection
In order to dene our sample of galaxy groups eg fossil
groups we assume the coordinates of the BGGs as group cen-
tres and then measure the magnitude gap M12 between the
rst and second brightest galaxies within a half of the projected
radius enclosing 200 times the mean density R200 of each galaxy
group similar to the convention used in studies of fossil groups
Jones et al 2003 We dene three samples of galaxy groups
based on the magnitude gap measurements
i groups with M12  2 mag as fossil groups
ii groups with M12  05 mag as non-fossil or control
groups and
iii to understand whether M12 distinguishes between
galaxy groups we also select a sample of groups with any values
of M12 This helps us nd the robustness of M12 as an optical
criterion in identifying fossil groups
The constraint on the halo mass results in an initial sample
of 51366 galaxy groups at z 0 with 13 per cent fossil groups
and 25 per cent M12  05 mag control groups
For each sample of galaxy groups we dene three sub-
samples following the halo mass and the BGG luminosity
ranges
SI 130  logM200h1M  135 and 225  MrBGG 
SII 135  logM200h1M  140 and 23  MrBGG 
225 and
SIII 140  logM200h1M and 230  MrBGG 
2410
We select 1481 307 and 89 galaxy groups at z  0 of each
group type obeying the SI SII and SIII criteria respectively
The constraint on the luminosity of BGG enables us to select rel-
atively homogeneous sub-samples and also to detect a presence
of a large magnitude gap in the shape of composite LF of fossil
groups Otherwise the large gap in the bright end of the compos-
ite LF is lled by combining groups with dierent BGGs In Fig
1 lower panel we plot the absolute r-band magnitude of BGGs
MrBGG versus halo mass for all groups gray points and for all
group sub-samples at z  0 We select our sample of the fossil
control and random groups from the highlighted sub-samples

function of redshift for SI top panel SII middle panel and
SIII bottom panel sub-samples We nd that the mean magni-
tude gap of fossils decreases to a lower value with increasing
redshift so that at z05 we detect no dierences between all
three samples of groups In contrast to fossils the mean magni-
tude gap for the control sample grows with increasing redshift
between z  0 to z  05 We detect no redshift evolution for the
mean magnitude gap of random groups We detect no dierence
for the magnitude gap evolution between dierent subsamples
shown in Fig 2
302 Tracing the M12 forwards
2008 we examine
Similar to von Benda-Beckmann et al
whether the magnitude gap of groups evolves forwards in time
and select three dierent sub-samples of fossil control and ran-
dom groups at z  1 according to the mass ranges dened
in 22 We use a similar cut for the absolute magnitude of
BGGs Mr  22 mag for all halos We track these groups
forwards in time from z 1 to z 0 Fig 3 In agreement
with von Benda-Beckmann et al 2008 we nd that the ma-
jority  80 per cent of fossil groups with a halo mass less than
M200  1014 Mh1 ll their large magnitude gaps eg due to
the infall of luminous galaxies within 05R200 where we calcu-
late the magnitude gap However about 40 per cent of fossil
clusters with M200  1014Mh1 retain their large magnitude
gap In addition the mean gap value for the control groups in-
creases with decreasing redshift For random groups the mean
gap value remains at with redshift The mean gap value of all
group types in SI becomes similar below z 03 but for SII and
SIII the mean gap values become similar more recently z 0
In Fig 4 we show the magnitude gap distributions at z  0
for the traced groups since z  1 We also nd that  15 per
cent of control groups which tracing from z  1 become fossil
groups at z  0

Fig 4 Magnitude gap distribution of the remnant groups at z  0 for the
halos that are selected as fossil control and random groups at z  1 and
traced to z  0 The blue dashed green dotted and red solid histograms
show a gap distribution for traced fossil control and random groups
within SI top panel SII middle panel and SIII bottom panel It
appears that  40 of fossils with M200  1014 Mh1 survive their gap
after evolving between z  1 and z  0
Fig 1 upper panel we show the magnitude gap distribution for
all groups at z0 and for SI solid red histogram SII dashed
green histogram and SIII long-dashed blue histogram It ap-
pears that the fraction of fossil groups decreases with increasing
halo masses
In order to understand the time evolution of M12 parame-
ter we trace backwards all halos in our sub-samples from z 0
The vertical axis in Fig 5 represents a ratio of the mean
mass of selected halos at each redshift to their nal mass at z0
The error bars are the standard error on the mean A similar evo-
lution is detected for the halo mass build-up of fossil groups
within SI SII and SIII Fossils have assembled 50 per cent
of their current mean halo masses at z 1 while controls and
random groups accumulate 30 per cent and 40 per cent re-
spectively In agreement with early studies we nd that fossils
are early formed groups compared to control groups with similar
halo masses and BGG luminosities We also nd that low-mass
groups have assembled larger fraction of their masses at z  1
compared to the high-mass groups For example fossils within
SI SII and SIII are accumulated 57 46 and 41 per cent of
their nal halo mass at z  1 respectively Fig 5 also shows
that the mean halo mass of selected fossil control and random

retical model of galaxy formation and evolution A number of
studies have detected substantial dierences between the LF
of galaxies in the eld group and cluster environments that
can arise from diering of the galaxy formation because of
the dierences in the galaxy environments or that can be re-
lated to eects on the LF by dynamical physical processes
ie mergers eects of tidal and ram-pressure forces that oc-
cur during or after the collapse of galaxy groupsclusters eg
Miles et al 2006 Several earlier studies attempted to show
similarities between LFs in dierent environments suggest-
ing the LF as universal function eg Oemler 1974 Gaidos
1997 Colless 1989 De Propris et al 2003 In contrast a num-
ber of studies disagree with the universal shape of LF eg
Godwin  Peach 1977 Piranomonte et al 2001 Hansen et al
2005 Giodini et al 2012 The luminosity evolution of the
bright end and slope of the faint end of the galaxy LF in
the eld and clusters has been well understood Bowler et al
2014 Lilly et al 1995 Norberg et al 2002 Willmer et al 2006
Ellis et al 1996 Alshino et al 2010 However because of a
lack of data for fossil groups the nature of such evolution in
fossils has remained an open question
Using numerical simulation of the merging of a compact
group Barnes 1989 concluded that an elliptical galaxy can
be formed by merging galaxies in a few tenths of a Hub-
ble time Later Ponman  Bertram 1993 and Ponman et al
1994 studied HCG 62 and RX J13406  1018 nding that
compact groups of galaxies form as a result of the orbital decay
of galaxies into an extended dark matter halo Finally massive
galaxies in these systems merge with the central group galaxy as
a result of dynamical friction forming a system known as a fos-
sil group Such a fossil group includes a giant elliptical galaxy
with an extended hot gas halo that displays a large dierence in
magnitude relative to the second brightest satellite galaxy within
05R200
If fossil groups are indeed early-formed systems it is fea-
sible to address this by studying the redshift evolution of the
two particular components of galaxy LF bright and faint ends
with the help of SAMs To this end we select our galaxy group
samples at z0 according to the denition given in 22 Then
we trace backwards all halos and measure the composite LF of
galaxies in groupsclusters for each sub-sample in 22 dierent
redshift slices from z  0 to z  1 down to an absolute r-band
magnitude of -15 mag The composite LF is measured from a
combination of the LF of traced galaxy groups according to the
method introduced in detail by Colless 1989 The number of
galaxies within each luminosity or magnitude bin is measured
using the following equation 1
where Nc j is number of galaxies within the j-th bin of the com-
posite LF Ni j is the count in the j-th bin of the i-th groups LF
Ni0 is the normalisation of the i-th group LF assumed here the
number of galaxies brighter than Mr  19 within given radius
m j is the number of groups counterpart to the j-th bin and
Nc0  X
The error for each bin of the composite LF is calculated ac-
cording to the following relation

posite LF of galaxies in fossil groups selected within 1
4 R200 ra-
dius from BGG evolves substantially changing M by  2 mag
while LF of random groups shows no considerable evolution
with redshift The bright end of the composite LF of the control
groups shows no evolution between z 01 and z  1 However
it appears that at z  01 M of these groups is skewed to lower
magnitudes which is probably caused by the infall of luminous
galaxies within 1
4 R200
As shown in the middle panel of Fig 8 we nd evolution of
M for the composite LF of galaxies selected within 1
2 R200 for
dierent types of groups for SI are similar to that of the com-
posite LF within 1
4 R200 We notice that by increasing the group
radius to R200 M of fossils increases between z  1 and present
day by  1 mag see lower panel in Fig 8 As a result the M
of the composite luminosity function of galaxies in fossil groups
within R200 at z  005 is consistent with that M  2110
of our study of the composite luminosity function of four fossil
group candidates Khosroshahi et al 2014 No signicant red-
shift evolution of M is seen for the random groups and control
groups
Our conclusions derived for SI sub-sample also apply to
SII and SIII see Fig9 and Fig10 For both SII and SIII sub-
samples the M of composite LF of galaxies within 1
4 R200 and
2 R200 radii of fossil groups shows an evolution with redshift by
 1  15 mag which is dierent from M evolution of LF for
the random and control groups We notice a substantial change
in M of composite LF of fossil groups takes place around the
central region of these systems at z 04 in the last  5Gyr Fur-
thermore the slope of M  z relation of fossil groups decreases
with increasing halo mass
In this study we have selected our groups by considering the
r-band absolute magnitude of BGGs magnitude gap- and halo

fossil groups control groups with M12  05 and groups with
any M12 We select our sub-samples at z0 in the SAM of
Guo et al 2011 and trace the halos backwards in redshift up
to z 1 For 22 snapshots redshifts we calculate the mean lu-
minosity gap and an average ratio of the halo mass of groups
to their nal masses at z0 We also measure a composite LF
of galaxies within three radii 1
2 R200 and R200 We also
trace forwards in time the magnitude gap of groups from z1 to
present day Our main results are as follows
4 R200 1
I Similar to other studies we show that fossil groups in
the G11 model have accumulated their halo mass earlier than
non-fossil groups We also detect that at redshift one the low-
mass fossil systems SI had on average 15 per cent more mass
compared to massive fossil clusters SIII
II By tracing halos from z  0 to z  1 we show that the
large magnitude gaps of fossil groups for all halo mass ranges
have been formed between the present day and z 05 eg last
 5 Gyrs By forward tracing from z  1 to z  0 we nd that 80
per cent of fossil groups with M200 6 1014 Mh1 ll their large
gap possibly due to the infall of bright galaxies within 05R200 in
agreement with ndings of von Benda-Beckmann et al 2008
In addition we detect 40 per cent of fossil clusters with a halo
mass above 1014 Mh1 retain their large magnitude gaps since
III We calculate composite LFs of galaxies in traced galaxy
groups at 22 redshift slices and t a single Schechter function
The bright end characteristic absolute magnitude M of the
composite LF for fossils shows a signicant redshift evolution
by  15 mag between z 05 and present day This evolu-
tion for composite LFs of fossils within 14R200 and 12R200 is
comparable with the composite LFs calculated inside R200 In
contrast the M of the composite LFs for control and random
groups corresponding to dierent radii show no considerable
evolution with redshift
We observe that the slope of the faint end  of the compos-
ite LF within 14R200 and 12R200 for fossils with M200 6 10135
Mh1 evolves with redshift by  008 at z  02 This evolution
of  in fossil groups can be explained by a recent devouring of
dwarf galaxies by a central giant galaxy in fossils The  corre-
sponding to the composite LFs within R200 for both fossil and
non-fossil groups show no signicant evolution with redshift
We have investigated the evolution of  of composite LFs
and nd that the  of composite LFs of fossil groups within
14R200 and 12R200 steeply evolves towards larger values at red-
shifts below z 03 This evolution for the composite LF of fos-
sils within R200 is slow Similar to fossil groups the  of com-
posite LF of control and random groups signicantly increases
with redshift
IV We nd that the number of dwarf galaxies in fos-
sil groups has no evolution with redshift since z1 to present
daywhile a signicant evolution is observed for control and ran-
dom groups by  42 and 25 respectively The constant be-
havior of a number of dwarf galaxies in fossil groups indicates
that the changes in  in these systems are caused by the changes
in M and not in the number of galaxies
V In contrast to the fossil and to the control groups we
detect that the magnitude gap and the composite LF of random
groups show no considerable evolution with redshift indicating
the importance of the magnitude gap as an optical tool in the
study of galaxy groups
Our ndings on the time evolution of the Schechter param-
eters suggest that the central elliptical galaxies in local fos-
sil groups have been formed by multiple massive galaxy merg-
ers since z05 Because the timescale for the merging of faint

evolution of Ndwar f gal for SI and SIII are similar to that of SII

 of the composite LFs of random and control groups show
similar trends that increase with redshift in all panels For fos-
sil groups we detect a trend for  of the composite LF within

fossil groups within 1
2 R200 also evolve similar to that

present day indicating recent changes in the number of galaxies
in these systems

In order to nd out what caused the changes in  we inves-
tigate whether the number of dwarf galaxies Ndwar f gal here-
after in our sample of groups evolves with redshift We select
galaxies in the r-band magnitude range 18  Mr  16 In
Fig 15 we plot Ndwar f gal of fossil lled blue circles control
open green triangles and random open red squares groups
within R200 versus redshift for SII we nd similar trends for
the Ndwar f gal of groups in SI and SIII The Ndwar f gal of fossil
groups grows by  12 between z  1 and z  03 after which
Ndwar f gal remains constant with redshift We also notice a  5
drop in Ndwar f gal in fossil groups below z  01 This evolution
is consistent with the recent evolution of  in composite LFs of
fossils within r  05R200 at z  02 see the upper and middle
panels of Figs 11 and 12
The Ndwar f gal of random groups grows by  25 since
z  1 to present day We detect Ndwar f gal of control groups to
evolve similar to that of the fossils between z  1 to z  055
In contrast to fossil groups Ndwar f gal of control groups steeply
rises with redshift by  45 below z  055 The constant be-
havior of the number of dwarf galaxies in the fossil groups indi-
cates that changes in  are caused by changes in M see Figs 8
to 10 and not in the number of galaxies These ndings strongly
suggest that the BGG in fossil group forms because of the multi-
ple mergers with massive galaxies and that the large magnitude
gap of fossil groups is the eect of galaxy mergercannibalism
