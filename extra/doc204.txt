Abstract
A newly developed isochrone synthesis algorithm for the photometric evolution of
galaxies is described Two initial mass functions IMFs in particular the recent IMF
determined by Kroupa Tout and Gilmore three photometric transformations and a
1-Gyr-burst star formation rate SFR are used to compute the B  V and V  K color
index evolution Non-negligible dierences are observed among model results
In the framework of the galaxy count model by Coln Schramm and Peimbert a
simple merging scenario is considered to account for the excess of galaxies observed in
the blue band counts The excess is explained by the number and luminosity evolution
of a group of galaxies called interacting I It is assumed that the number of I galaxies
increases as 1  z due to mergers Moreover it is proposed that their characteristic
luminosity increases as 1  z3 due to starbursts driven by galaxy-galaxy collision and
decreases as 1  z due to the change in the size of the galaxies Not much number
evolution is needed to account for the excess for example a model with   40 predicts
that about 17  of the galaxies at z  04 are interacting Number evolution models
with a rather high value of  t better the data in particular the model with   40
predicts that about 13  of the galaxies have z  07 in the 210  mbJ  225 interval
this contrasts with the upper bound of 5  obtained with the sample of 78 galaxies
by Colless et al The excess of high redshift galaxies can not be simply explained
by changing reasonably the parameters of the luminosity function of I galaxies This
result could indicate that mergers are not the whole story Our best-t model produces
the following values for the parameters of the local luminosity function of galaxies
  120 M   207 and   166  103M pc3 h  05
1 INTRODUCTION
The excess number density of galaxies observed in the blue band eg Tyson 1988 Metcalfe
et al 1991 Lilly Cowie  Gardner 1991 over the expected from a non-evolving model has
generated great interest Several possible explanations have been suggested to account for
it from those that invoke a nonzero cosmological constant that provides a greater volume
to accommodate the excess number of galaxies Yoshii  Takahara 1988 Fukugita et al
1990 Yoshii 1993 to those that assume evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies
LFG via an increase in the number density of galaxies due to mergers Guiderdoni 
Rocca-Volmerange 1987 Broadhurst Ellis  Glazebrook 1992 Coln Schramm  Peimbert
1994 hereafter CSP or via an increase in the characteristic luminosity of the LFG due to
starbursts driven possibly by galaxy-galaxy collisions Carlberg  Charlot 1992 Moreover
faint redshift surveys by Broadhurst et al
1990 1993 place
galaxies quite near the median redshift is just  02 and  03 respectively In addition
no galaxies were found with z  07 brighter than bJ  225 in the sample by Colless et al
This result imposes a strong constraint on evolving models In these models a non-negligible
fraction of galaxies with z  07 is expected indeed larger than the one predicted by a
non-evolving model
1988 and Colless et al
With the advent of infrared arrays and infrared CCD detectors it is also possible to
count galaxies deeply in the K-band Cowie et al 1993 Soifer et al 1994 Surprisingly
a non-evolving model ts relatively well the K-counts This almost rules out models with
nonstandard cosmologies as the ones with a non-zero cosmological constant since in this
case they overestimate the number of galaxies Yet the observational restrictions admit one
more explanation namely a new population of blue galaxies at z  02 that faded or were
disrupted so as to become invisible at present Cowie Songaila  Hu 1991 Babul  Rees
Local low surface brightness galaxies have similar physical properties to those observed
in the faint blue excess population McGaugh 1994 McGaugh suggests that the excess is
made up of low surface brightness galaxies and his idea rests on a bivariate LFG that is a
LFG that in addition to type depends on surface brightness
The result that faint blue galaxies FBGs are weakly clustered Efstathiou et al 1991
has been sometimes taken as an evidence against the merger-driven explanation for the
observed excess of FBGs see for instance Babul  Rees 1992 McGaugh 1994 the low
value for the angular correlation function at 30 is explained by Efstathiou et al assuming
that most FBGs belong to a population that is weakly clustered and intrinsically faint at
the present epoch This result is challenged by a recent work by Cole et al 1994 where
no evidence is found for the evolution of the comoving correlation length with redshift to
B  22 however a more recent paper by Infante  Pritchet 1994 supports the earlier
results by Efstathiou et al
The hypothesis that the observed excess of FBGs is due to an increase in the number
density of galaxies that are strongly interacting the merger-driven excess is retaken here A
phenomenological model was developed in CSP to account for three dierent observational
restrictions namely 1 the B-counts 2 the K-counts and 3 a B-redshift distribution
It was due to the increase in the number density of a type of galaxies called interacting I
that the observations were tted
This kind of model like others of similar nature is supported by a recent work on
high-resolution imaging of faint blue galaxies Colless et al 1994 and by HST studies of
morphology of high redshift galaxies Griths et al 1994a b Colless et al nd from a
sample of 26 galaxies which belong to the redshift survey of Colless et al 1993 17 galaxies
that have an enhanced star formation rate indicated by OII equivalent widths greater than
20A About 30 of these galaxies have companions at projected distances closer than 10 h1
This model diers from the one by CSP in the following 1 a dierent algorithm for
the computation of the passive luminosity evolution correction is applied and 2 although
the total luminosity of the I galaxies LT
I  here is also not conserved it is not due to that we
do not take into account the change in size of the I galaxies as it occurs in CSP but due to
the starsbursts driven by galaxy-galaxy collisions This is what we call active luminosity
evolution The model in this paper also diers from the one by CSP in the assumed values
for the parameters of the luminosity functions of the dierent types of galaxies in particular
those values assumed for the characteristic luminosities of Sac and ESO galaxies Because
they are fainter in CSP they produce a better t for the redshift distribution than the one
we show in this paper
An outline of the paper follows in 2 we briey discuss our revised color evolution code
with an isochrone synthesis algorithm in 3 our merger-driven model is described and in 4
we present our conclusions
2 COLOR EVOLUTION OF GALAXIES
21 Model
Our photometric evolution of galaxies code is fully discussed in CSP therefore here just a brief
review will be given Unlike CSP where a standard procedure was used eg Bruzual 1983
here an isochrone synthesis algorithm is implemented The advantages of this algorithm
have been discussed elsewhere eg Charlot  Bruzual 1991 we just would like to mention
the usefulness of the algorithm in computing color evolution properties for short  108 yr
time-scales of the star formation rate
211 Ingredients
The ingredients necessary in any spectrophotometric evolution of galaxies code are four 1
a library of stellar evolutionary tracks 2 a library of stellar spectra 3 an initial mass
function IMF and 4 a star formation rate SFR Our compiled tracks are from Schaller
et al 1992 for solar metallicity These tracks are incomplete and therefore we had to
complete them Tracks from other authors were used and various useful simplications were
made in particular the lifetime of the asymptotic giant branch was left as a free parameter
This will be remedied as soon as the evolutionary models for the horizontal and asymptotic
giant branch from the group of Maeder and collaborators are incorporated As long as we
are only interested in galaxy color evolution there is no need for having a library of stellar
spectra we just need a photometric transformation from the HR theoretical diagram to the
observational one The compilation work by Schmidt-Kaler 1982 has been used now to
pass from one diagram to the other We still continue to use the work by Johnson 1966 to
get the rest of the color indexes
The IMF is normalized so that
mmdm  1
Although a value of 01 M is often used for mlow as we do we should keep in mind that
the contribution by substellar objects to the integrated infrared light of a galaxy might not
be negligible Of course this depends on the luminosity function of these objects of which
we know nothing From chemical evolution considerations Peimbert et al 1994 limit the
amount of substellar objects in the solar neighborhood to  002 Mpc3 The recent IMF
determination by Kroupa Tout and Gilmore 1993 KTG IMF for the solar vicinity is used
as a good guess for the IMF for a variety of types of galaxies Nevertheless the standard
Salpeter IMF S IMF with the exponent x  135 is used for comparison purposes A value
of 600 M is taken for mup
In view of the great uncertainties about stellar formation histories of galaxies an expo-
nential law for the SFR is usually taken to model the color evolution of the dierent types
of galaxies The maximum virtue of this scheme is that almost all present galaxy colors can
be reproduced by varying the time scale   of the SFR from an elliptical galaxy   05
to an irregular one    eg Charlot  Bruzual 1991 CSP These galaxy colors are
of course metallicity-dependent This eect is now being incorporated in the latest models
for spectral evolution of galaxies in particular for elliptical galaxies see Worthey 1994 and
references therein The evolutionary correction e-correction to the counts should not worry
us too much because as we know from CSP there are only three types of galaxies that play
an important role on the counts According to our count-scheme the luminosity of a galaxy
belonging to the interacting group of galaxies does not evolve ie it has no e-correction
We can be condent that the other two types ESO and Sa-c are being modeled relatively
well the rst with a burst of star formation that lasts 1 Gyr the second with a constant
212 Isochrone synthesis algorithm
The luminosity of a single stellar population SSP is given by
lt  Z mmax
1004MMmdm
where mmin is the lower limit of the IMF and mmax is the maximum mass in the isochrone
with age t The integrated luminosity for a composite stellar population with a history of
star formation given by t can be obtained with the convolution integral
Lt  Z t
t  tltdt
The isochrone at time t from a complete set of m evolutionary tracks is built as follows let
us assume that the tracks are divided into n stages from zero age main sequence ZAMS
to post-asymptotic giant branch P-AGB The indexes i and j number the stages and the
tracks respectively with i  1  n and j  1  m The mass of the star at the stage i is
given by
log mit  Aij logMj1  1  Aij logMj
log tji  log t
log tji  log tj1i
In equation 5 tji denotes the age of the star of ZAMS-mass Mj at the ith evolutionary
stage where
tj1i  t  tji
Mj  mit  Mj1
M1 and Mm denote the lower and upper limit of the IMF respectively This procedure
is performed for each stage value of i The HR diagram physical parameters log L and
log Tef f  associated to the star of mass mi are obtained by interpolating the tracks between
the stars of masses Mj and Mj1
To obtain the integrated properties of this SSP we proceed as Bruzual 1992 the number
of stars of mass mi nmi is found by integrating the IMF from m to m where m 
mi1mi and m  mimi1 The luminosity li is then computed by assigning Nij 
Aijnmi stars to the HR parameters of the star of mass Mj1 at the ith stage and Nij1 
1  Aijnmi to the star of mass Mj at the same ith stage We nally obtain lt by
summing over all is
22 Results
In doing photometric evolution of galaxies special care should be put on the photometric
transformation This is stressed in Figure 1 where the B-V and V-K evolution is plotted for
a 1-Gyr-burst SFR for three dierent calibrations The dotted line uses a compilation work
by Schmidt-Kaler 1982 and Johnson 1966 the solid line utilizes one from Schmidt-Kaler
1982 and Bessel and Brett 1988 and the dashed line comes from a compiled calibration
work by Bruzual and Charlot 1993 The greatest dierence among them amounts to  025
mag in V-K at around 17  107yr this dierence is due to the V-K values adopted for the
giant luminosity class at the low-temperature regime The peak at 17107yr is produced by
the supergiant red branch contribution Hereafter the calibration by Schmidt-Kaler 1982
and Bessel and Brett 1988 will be used In Figure 2 we have plotted the B-V and V-K color
evolution for a 1-Gyr-burst SFR in this case for two dierent IMFs the KTG IMF solid
line and the Salpeter one dotted line The V-K color is slightly bluer when computed
with the KTG IMF the greatest dierence at  108yr amounts to 01 mag A much smaller
dierence is observed for the case of B-V
3 A Merger Model for Galaxy Counts
This paragraph describes briey the 0  1 merger model for galaxy counts of CSP Galaxies
were divided into ve dierent types ESO dEdSO spheroidal dwarfs Sa-c spirals dI
dwarf irregulars and I interacting galaxies A Schechter analytical representation for the
galaxy luminosity function was used for all types It was shown that a gaussian representation
for the luminosity function LF of the brighter galaxies provided a poor t to the redshift
Figure 1 Evolution of the color indices B-V and V-K for a 1Gyr-burst SFR with three
dierent photometric calibrations Bruzal  Charlot dashed line Schmidth-Kaler and
Bessel  Brett solid line and Schmidth-Kaler and Johnson dotted line
Figure 2 As in Fig 1 we have plotted the evolution of the color indices B-V and V-K for
a 1-Gyr-burst SFR The two curves come from two dierent IMFs KTG IMF solid line
and Salpeter IMF dotted line The calibration from Smichdt-Kaler and Bessel  Brett has
been used
I increased with redshift as a power law ie 
distribution CSP models were based on a scenario where the amplitude of the LF of I
I  1  z The k-corrections
galaxies 
for the dierent classes of galaxies were obtained from the spectral energy distributions
SEDs by Coleman Wu  Weedman 1980 and Pence 1976 in particular the SED for
an average elliptical galaxy was taken to be the SED of the bulge of M31 The e-corrections
were evaluated from our standard approach to the photometric evolution of galaxies
31 The Interacting Galaxies
The I group does not form properly a morphological group of galaxies it is rather composed
of pairs of strongly interacting galaxies of dierent nature Moreover the observed physical
characteristics of the faint galaxies such as their blue colors enhanced star formation
indicated by OII equivalent widths greater than 20 A Colless et al 1994 etc give
us information about the nature of the galaxies that intervene in the interactions These
characteristics which are often associated to a system of interacting galaxies seem to indicate
that the type of galaxies that are participating in the mergers are gas-rich galaxies eg
Carlberg  Charlot 1992 This is a point worth noting since we will see below that the
increase of the characteristic luminosity of the I galaxies L
I to a rst approximation is due
to the starbursts driven by cloud-cloud collision It will be assumed that the I-galaxy LF
LFI follows a Schechter form
The evolution of LFI is due to three factors 1 a greater number density 2 a greater
gas content that results in a stronger starburst and 3 a smaller average size The points 2
and 3 go in opposite direction whereas the point 2 increases L
I the point 3 decreases
it It is interesting to note that in the absence of starbursts the eects on B-counts by points
1 and 3 cancels out This might be the case for the K-counts where most of the light
comes from a population of old stars
Our merger model scenario for the galaxy counts is then the following suppose that at
each time a photograph of the Universe is taken and that galaxies are divided into various
types Those that show signs of strong interaction are brought to the I group of galaxies
As we look back in time we see that the number density per comoving volume of I galaxies
increases while by hypothesis the number density of the other types of galaxies does not
change The increase in the total luminosity of I galaxies  L
I is due to the their greater
amount of gas as well as their increasing number density
I 
In this paper the above scenario for the modeling of the B- K-counts and the redshift
distribution is used and compared with observations We propose that the L
I of both the
B-band and the K-band evolves due to galaxy-galaxy collision and due to the change in
size yet a model for the K-counts where the contribution from starbursts is neglected is also
computed The galaxy-galaxy collision term the one which produces an active luminosity
evolution contributes with 1  z3 to L
proportional to the stellar formation  driven by the mergers b in a cloud-cloud collision
  2 where  is the gas density and c 0  1 On the other hand L
I is reduced by
1  z due to the change in size Models with dierent values of  are calculated
I and it comes from assuming that a L
A Schechter analytical representation is used for the LFI with relative freedom in choos-
ing its  and M  parameters due to the great uncertainty about its shape Its characteristic
luminosity the luminosity at the knee of the LF is assumed to be greater than the corre-
sponding value for elliptical and spiral galaxies The fraction of I galaxies that contributes
to the LFG is assumed greater than the amount of mergers observed at the present epoch
12  in order to improve our t to the B-counts
Ingredients
In Table 1 the values of the parameters of the luminosity functions of the dierent galaxy
classes are shown second third and fourth columns In the fth sixth an seventh columns
the timescale of the SFR the B  V and B  K color indices are shown respectively These
later are computed using the photometric evolution code described in 2 The last column
indicates the kind of SED used for each type of galaxy in particular the SED of the bulge
of M31 is used for ESO galaxies
The assumed values for  M  and the mix reect several facts First the values for the
parameters  and M  of the LF of spiral galaxies are similar to those derived by Loveday
et al 1992 for the eld LFG Second there is still much uncertainty about the value of
 for early-type galaxies the rather low value assumed in this paper as compared with
those obtained by several authors Efstathiou et al 1988 Loveday 1992 Zucca Pozzetti 
Zamorani 1994 ts better the K-counts Third there is not yet a eld LF for early-type
dwarf galaxies nor for late-type dwarfs though we use the  and M  values of the LF of
dEdSO galaxies and the M  value of the LF of dI galaxies obtained by Sandage Binggeli
 Tammann 1985 for the Virgo cluster needless to say that there is no reason to expect
that these assumptions are correct Fourth the parameters for the LFI are chosen in such
a way that 1 the characteristic luminosity is greater than the one for ESO galaxies 2
the slope at the faint end equals that of the total luminosity function and 3 the fraction
of I galaxies should be small At the end our mix takes into account the following facts
1 the uncertainty in the fraction of strongly interacting systems 2 there are more spiral
galaxies than elliptical galaxies in the surveys of Efstathiou et al and Loveday et al 3
there is a signicant percentage of dEdSO galaxies in clusters Ferguson  Sandage 1991
in the poorest cluster the Leo group about 46  are dEdSO galaxies and 4 recent
determinations of the LFG Eales 1993 Lonsdale  Chokshi 1993 are producing a steeper
slope at the faint end  13

The e-corrections are evaluated assuming an exponential decreasing SFR with a varying
timescale For dwarf galaxies spheroidal and irregulars it appears inappropriate to model
their light with a solar metallicity population Furthermore a choice for the SFR becomes
dicult dwarf irregular galaxies are better modeled by a series of star formation bursts
followed by periods of zero star formation eg Pilyugin 1993 The number and the strength
of the bursts and the duration of the quiescent periods are parameters that seem to depend
on the galaxy Fortunately these galaxies make a negligible contribution to the B- and
K-counts except for the fainter end eg CSP The I galaxies have no e-correction by
hypothesis
33 Results
The detection rate and selection eects according to Yoshii 1993 were evaluated but
they were not incorporated to our models The reason is the small eect they have on the
predicted B-counts In an isophotal magnitude scheme SL  29 B mag arcsec2 with an
imposed minimum diameter of Dmin  20 a detection rate of about 75 at B  26 is
expected in a 0 0  1 0 scenario This amounts to a dierence of just 010 dex at
B  26 see also Yoshii
In Figure 3 the number of galaxies versus blue magnitude is plotted for four models The
data are from Maddox et al 1990 Lilly et al 1991 and Metcalfe et al 1991 There
are two non-evolving NE models one with the parameter values from Table 1 NE and
the other one NE KGB with the parameter values from Koo Gronwall  Bruzual 1993
hereafter KGB The Table 2 from KGB was utilized to derive the Schechter parameters for
the I B  V  06 Sa-c 06  B  V  085 and ESO B  V  085 classes of
galaxies these are

The inclusion of the NE KGB model in Figure 3 is with the purpose of showing that a much
smaller dierence is obtained between a NE model and the observations if the parameters
of the LFs are moved in the correct direction The other two models plotted in this Figure
are merger-driven models for two values of  A signicant dierence is starting to observe
between each other at bj  25 Moreover the maximum dierence between the data and
our   40 model amounts just 02 dex at bJ  250

related to the amplitude of the LFG  by

solid line The values for the parameters   and M  are given in the text
parameters   and M  are not well dened Yet approximate values for   and M 
can be obtained by attempting to t our LFG to a Schechter function When this is done
see Figure 4 we get the following   120 M   207 and   166  103M pc3
It is encouraging to note that the value we get for  necessary to t the brighter part of
the B-counts is similar to those derived by several authors Efstathiou 1988 de Lapparent
Geller  Huchra 1989 Loveday et al 1992
In Figure 5 the number distribution in the K-band is plotted for the same models as
for the B-band except that here the NE KGB model is replaced by a merger-driven model
in which the L
I in the K-band does not increase due to the startbursts model denoted
by II   40 The data are from a compilation by Gardner Cowie  Wainscoat 1993
It is important to point out here the better agreement obtained by those models with a
rather high value of  A redshift distribution is plotted in Figure 6 for two intervals of
B magnitude The histograms are redshifts for 125 galaxies taken from Broadhurst et al
1988 in the 200  bJ  210 range and for 78 galaxies taken from Colless et al 1990
1993 in the 210  bJ  225 interval this later survey is complete to 45  Our merger-
driven models predict a excess of high redshift galaxies being it greater for models with a
lower value of  the model with   10 predicts that a 27  of the galaxies have z  07
in the 210  bJ  225 range clearly inconsistent with the 5  derived by Colless et al
This is interesting since it could be a manner to discriminate between models with number
luminosity from those with luminosity evolution The model with   40 predicts that
about 13  of galaxies have z  07 not too far away from the observed 5 
It appears dicult to reduce the number of high redshift galaxies by changing the param-

eters of the LF of interacting galaxies subject to the constraints that 1 a small percentage
 5 of galaxies are strongly interacting at the present time 2 the slope at the faint
end is that of the total luminosity function and 3 the characteristic luminosity of this
population L
I is greater than the one of ESO galaxies For the sake of the argument let
us assume we increase further the value of the parameter  One might think this would
give us a better t but the point is that the percentage of galaxies greater than 07 does not
decrease much by increasing the value of  for example for   10 it is just 12 compared
to the 13 for   4 This point can be explained as follows as the  value goes up the L
decreases as
I  M 
I 0  253  log1  z
so the number of high-z galaxies decreases improving the t but at the same time the
number of moderate z galaxies increases due to the 1  z law worsening the t At the
end the decreasing of the percentage of galaxies with z  07 is very small We took the
value of   4 as a resonable estimation of the amount of mergers at z  04 and as a not
too bad t to the z-distribution

4 CONCLUSIONS
Dierences of up to 025 mag in V-K are found when various photometric calibrations are
used On the other hand a smaller dierence 01 mag in V-K is found when we compare the
results that come from using two reasonable IMFs the so-called KTG IMF and the Salpeter
one This is certainly negligible as far as the B or K number distributions calculations are
concerned
By using the best parameters we have in the literature for the LFs of the dierent classes
of galaxies and for the mix of them we arrive to the conclusion that number and luminosity
evolution of the galaxy luminosity function are important ingredients in the explanation
of the excess observed in the B-counts Our merger-driven models require little evolution
both in number and luminosity for example at z  04 the total number of galaxies has
just increased by 14  and the percentage of I galaxies is just 17  model with   40
Moreover luminosity evolution is such that a model with   40 predicts that about 13  of
galaxies have z  07 in the 210  mbJ  225 range Models with more emphasis in number
evolution reproduce better the redshift distributions the   40 model as compared with
the   10 one as it should be expected Despite our relative success of our models the
excess of high redshift of galaxies predicted by them indicates us that number and luminosity
evolution may not be the whole story

Abstract
A newly developed isochrone synthesis algorithm for the photometric evolution of
galaxies is described Two initial mass functions IMFs in particular the recent IMF
determined by Kroupa Tout and Gilmore three photometric transformations and a
-Gyr-burst star formation rate SFR are used to compute the B cid0 V and V cid0 K color
index evolution Non-negligible dicid11erences are observed among model results
In the framework of the galaxy count model by Colcid19cid16n Schramm and Peimbert a
simple merging scenario is considered to account for the excess of galaxies observed in
the blue band counts The excess is explained by the number and luminosity evolution
of a group of galaxies called interacting I It is assumed that the number of I galaxies
increases as   z 
due to mergers Moreover it is proposed that their characteristic
cid17
luminosity increases as   z 
due to starbursts driven by galaxy-galaxy collision and
decreases as   z 
due to the change in the size of the galaxies Not much number
cid0cid17
evolution is needed to account for the excess for example a model with cid17   predicts
that about   of the galaxies at z   are interacting Number evolution models
with a rather high value of cid17 cid12t better the data in particular the model with cid17  
predicts that about   of the galaxies have z   in the   m
  interval
this contrasts with the upper bound of   obtained with the sample of  galaxies
by Colless et al The excess of high redshift galaxies can not be simply explained
by changing reasonably the parameters of the luminosity function of I galaxies This
result could indicate that mergers are not the whole story Our best-cid12t model produces
the following values for the parameters of the local luminosity function of galaxies

INTRODUCTION
The excess number density of galaxies observed in the blue band eg Tyson  Metcalfe
et al  Lilly Cowie  Gardner  over the expected from a non-evolving model has
generated great interest Several possible explanations have been suggested to account for
it from those that invoke a nonzero cosmological constant that provides a greater volume
to accommodate the excess number of galaxies Yoshii  Takahara  Fukugita et al
 Yoshii  to those that assume evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies
LFG via an increase in the number density of galaxies due to mergers Guiderdoni 
Rocca-Volmerange  Broadhurst Ellis  Glazebrook  Colcid19cid16n Schramm  Peimbert
 hereafter CSP or via an increase in the characteristic luminosity of the LFG due to
starbursts driven possibly by galaxy-galaxy collisions Carlberg  Charlot  Moreover
faint redshift surveys by Broadhurst et al
 and Colless et al
  place
galaxies quite near the median redshift is just cid24  and cid24  respectively In addition
no galaxies were found with z   brighter than b
  in the sample by Colless et al
This result imposes a strong constraint on evolving models In these models a non-negligible
fraction of galaxies with z   is expected indeed larger than the one predicted by a
non-evolving model
With the advent of infrared arrays and infrared CCD detectors it is also possible to
count galaxies deeply in the K -band Cowie et al  Soifer et al  Surprisingly
a non-evolving model cid12ts relatively well the K -counts This almost rules out models with
nonstandard cosmologies as the ones with a non-zero cosmological constant since in this
case they overestimate the number of galaxies Yet the observational restrictions admit one
more explanation namely a new population of blue galaxies at z   that faded or were
disrupted so as to become invisible at present Cowie Songaila  Hu  Babul  Rees
Local low surface brightness galaxies have similar physical properties to those observed
in the faint blue excess population McGaugh  McGaugh suggests that the excess is
made up of low surface brightness galaxies and his idea rests on a bivariate LFG that is a
LFG that in addition to type depends on surface brightness
The result that faint blue galaxies FBGs are weakly clustered Efstathiou et al 
has been sometimes taken as an evidence against the merger-driven explanation for the
observed excess of FBGs see for instance Babul  Rees  McGaugh  the low
value for the angular correlation function at 
is explained by Efstathiou et al assuming
that most FBGs belong to a population that is weakly clustered and intrinsically faint at
the present epoch This result is challenged by a recent work by Cole et al  where
no evidence is found for the evolution of the comoving correlation length with redshift to
B   however a more recent paper by Infante  Pritchet  supports the earlier
results by Efstathiou et al
The hypothesis that the observed excess of FBGs is due to an increase in the number
density of galaxies that are strongly interacting the merger-driven excess is retaken here A
phenomenological model was developed in CSP to account for three dicid11erent observational
restrictions namely  the B -counts  the K -counts and  a B -redshift distribution
It was due to the increase in the number density of a type of galaxies called interacting I
that the observations were cid12tted
This kind of model like others of similar nature is supported by a recent work on
high-resolution imaging of faint blue galaxies Colless et al  and by HST studies of
morphology of high redshift galaxies Gricid14ths et al a b Colless et al cid12nd from a
sample of  galaxies which belong to the redshift survey of Colless et al   galaxies
that have an enhanced star formation rate indicated by OII equivalent widths greater than
cid23
A About  of these galaxies have companions at pro jected distances closer than  h
cid0
This model dicid11ers from the one by CSP in the following  a dicid11erent algorithm for
the computation of the passive luminosity evolution correction is applied and  although
the total luminosity of the I galaxies L
 here is also not conserved it is not due to that we
do not take into account the change in size of the I galaxies as it occurs in CSP but due to
the starsbursts driven by galaxy-galaxy collisions This is what we call active luminosity
evolution The model in this paper also dicid11ers from the one by CSP in the assumed values
for the parameters of the luminosity functions of the dicid11erent types of galaxies in particular
those values assumed for the characteristic luminosities of Sac and ESO galaxies Because
they are fainter in CSP they produce a better cid12t for the redshift distribution than the one
we show in this paper
An outline of the paper follows in x we briecid13y discuss our revised color evolution code
with an isochrone synthesis algorithm in x our merger-driven model is described and in x
we present our conclusions
 COLOR EVOLUTION OF GALAXIES
 Model
Our photometric evolution of galaxies code is fully discussed in CSP therefore here just a brief
review will be given Unlike CSP where a standard procedure was used eg Bruzual 
here an isochrone synthesis algorithm is implemented The advantages of this algorithm
have been discussed elsewhere eg Charlot  Bruzual  we just would like to mention
the usefulness of the algorithm in computing color evolution properties for short cid24 
time-scales of the star formation rate
 Ingredients
The ingredients necessary in any spectrophotometric evolution of galaxies code are four 
a library of stellar evolutionary tracks  a library of stellar spectra  an initial mass
function IMF and  a star formation rate SFR Our compiled tracks are from Schaller
et al  for solar metallicity These tracks are incomplete and therefore we had to
complete them Tracks from other authors were used and various useful simplicid12cations were
made in particular the lifetime of the asymptotic giant branch was left as a free parameter
This will be remedied as soon as the evolutionary models for the horizontal and asymptotic
giant branch from the group of Maeder and collaborators are incorporated As long as we
are only interested in galaxy color evolution there is no need for having a library of stellar
spectra we just need a photometric transformation from the HR theoretical diagram to the
observational one The compilation work by Schmidt-Kaler  has been used now to
pass from one diagram to the other We still continue to use the work by Johnson  to
get the rest of the color indexes
The IMF is normalized so that
mcid30mdm  
Although a value of  M
is often used for m
 as we do we should keep in mind that
cid12
the contribution by substellar ob jects to the integrated infrared light of a galaxy might not
be negligible Of course this depends on the luminosity function of these ob jects of which
we know nothing From chemical evolution considerations Peimbert et al  limit the
amount of substellar ob jects in the solar neighborhood to   M
 The recent IMF
cid12
cid0
determination by Kroupa Tout and Gilmore  KTG IMF for the solar vicinity is used
as a good guess for the IMF for a variety of types of galaxies Nevertheless the standard
Salpeter IMF S IMF with the exponent x   is used for comparison purposes A value
of  M
is taken for m
cid12
In view of the great uncertainties about stellar formation histories of galaxies an expo-
nential law for the SFR is usually taken to model the color evolution of the dicid11erent types
of galaxies The maximum virtue of this scheme is that almost all present galaxy colors can
be reproduced by varying the time scale cid28  of the SFR from an elliptical galaxy cid28  
to an irregular one cid28   eg Charlot  Bruzual  CSP These galaxy colors are
of course metallicity-dependent This ecid11ect is now being incorporated in the latest models
for spectral evolution of galaxies in particular for elliptical galaxies see Worthey  and
references therein The evolutionary correction e-correction to the counts should not worry
us too much because as we know from CSP there are only three types of galaxies that play
an important role on the counts According to our count-scheme the luminosity of a galaxy
belonging to the interacting group of galaxies does not evolve ie it has no e-correction
We can be concid12dent that the other two types ESO and Sa-c are being modeled relatively
well the cid12rst with a burst of star formation that lasts  Gyr the second with a constant

The isochrone at time t from a complete set of m evolutionary tracks is built as follows let
us assume that the tracks are divided into n stages from zero age main sequence ZAMS

tracks respectively with i    n and j    m The mass of the star at the stage i is
given by

is performed for each stage value of i The HR diagram physical parameters log L and
 associated to the star of mass m

the stars of masses M

of stars of mass m

 Results
In doing photometric evolution of galaxies special care should be put on the photometric
transformation This is stressed in Figure  where the B-V and V-K evolution is plotted for
a -Gyr-burst SFR for three dicid11erent calibrations The dotted line uses a compilation work
by Schmidt-Kaler  and Johnson  the solid line utilizes one from Schmidt-Kaler
 and Bessel and Brett  and the dashed line comes from a compiled calibration
work by Bruzual and Charlot  The greatest dicid11erence among them amounts to cid24 
mag in V-K at around  cid2 
yr this dicid11erence is due to the V-K values adopted for the
giant luminosity class at the low-temperature regime The peak at  cid2 
yr is produced by
the supergiant red branch contribution Hereafter the calibration by Schmidt-Kaler 
and Bessel and Brett  will be used In Figure  we have plotted the B-V and V-K color
evolution for a -Gyr-burst SFR in this case for two dicid11erent IMFs the KTG IMF solid
line and the Salpeter one dotted line The V-K color is slightly bluer when computed
with the KTG IMF the greatest dicid11erence at cid24 
yr amounts to  mag A much smaller
dicid11erence is observed for the case of B-V
 A Merger Model for Galaxy Counts
This paragraph describes briecid13y the cid10
  merger model for galaxy counts of CSP Galaxies
were divided into cid12ve dicid11erent types ESO dEdSO spheroidal dwarfs Sa-c spirals dI
dwarf irregulars and I interacting galaxies A Schechter analytical representation for the
galaxy luminosity function was used for all types It was shown that a gaussian representation
for the luminosity function LF of the brighter galaxies provided a poor cid12t to the redshift
Figure  Evolution of the color indices B-V and V-K for a Gyr-burst SFR with three
dicid11erent photometric calibrations Bruzal  Charlot dashed line Schmidth-Kaler and
Bessel  Brett solid line and Schmidth-Kaler and Johnson dotted line
Figure  As in Fig  we have plotted the evolution of the color indices B-V and V-K for
a -Gyr-burst SFR The two curves come from two dicid11erent IMFs KTG IMF solid line
and Salpeter IMF dotted line The calibration from Smichdt-Kaler and Bessel  Brett has
been used
distribution CSP models were based on a scenario where the amplitude of the LF of I
galaxies cid30
 increased with redshift as a power law ie cid30
   z 
 The k-corrections
cid3
cid3
cid17
for the dicid11erent classes of galaxies were obtained from the spectral energy distributions
SEDs by Coleman Wu  Weedman  and Pence  in particular the SED for
an average elliptical galaxy was taken to be the SED of the bulge of M The e-corrections
were evaluated from our standard approach to the photometric evolution of galaxies
 The Interacting Galaxies
The I group does not form properly a morphological group of galaxies it is rather composed
of pairs of strongly interacting galaxies of dicid11erent nature Moreover the observed physical
characteristics of the faint galaxies such as their blue colors enhanced star formation
indicated by OII equivalent widths greater than 
A Colless et al  etc give
cid23
us information about the nature of the galaxies that intervene in the interactions These
characteristics which are often associated to a system of interacting galaxies seem to indicate
that the type of galaxies that are participating in the mergers are gas-rich galaxies eg
Carlberg  Charlot  This is a point worth noting since we will see below that the
increase of the characteristic luminosity of the I galaxies L
 to a cid12rst approximation is due
cid3
to the starbursts driven by cloud-cloud collision It will be assumed that the I-galaxy LF
LFI follows a Schechter form
The evolution of LFI is due to three factors  a greater number density  a greater
gas content that results in a stronger starburst and  a smaller average size The points 
and  go in opposite direction whereas the point  increases L
the point  decreases
cid3
it It is interesting to note that in the absence of starbursts the ecid11ects on B -counts by points
 and  cancels out This might be the case for the K -counts where most of the light
comes from a population of old stars
Our merger model scenario for the galaxy counts is then the following suppose that at
each time a photograph of the Universe is taken and that galaxies are divided into various
types Those that show signs of strong interaction are brought to the I group of galaxies
As we look back in time we see that the number density per comoving volume of I galaxies
increases while by hypothesis the number density of the other types of galaxies does not
change The increase in the total luminosity of I galaxies  L
cid30
 is due to the their greater
cid3
cid3
amount of gas as well as their increasing number density
In this paper the above scenario for the modeling of the B - K -counts and the redshift
distribution is used and compared with observations We propose that the L
of both the
cid3
B -band and the K -band evolves due to galaxy-galaxy collision and due to the change in
size yet a model for the K -counts where the contribution from starbursts is neglected is also
computed The galaxy-galaxy collision term the one which produces an active luminosity
evolution contributes with   z 
and it comes from assuming that a L
cid3
cid3
proportional to the stellar formation cid9 driven by the mergers b in a cloud-cloud collision
cid3
cid9  cid27
 where cid27 is the gas density and c cid10
  On the other hand L
is reduced by
  z 
due to the change in size Models with dicid11erent values of cid17 are calculated
cid0cid17
A Schechter analytical representation is used for the LFI with relative freedom in choos-
ing its cid11 and M
parameters due to the great uncertainty about its shape Its characteristic
cid3
luminosity the luminosity at the knee of the LF is assumed to be greater than the corre-
sponding value for elliptical and spiral galaxies The fraction of I galaxies that contributes
to the LFG is assumed greater than the amount of mergers observed at the present epoch
  in order to improve our cid12t to the B -counts
Ingredients
In Table  the values of the parameters of the luminosity functions of the dicid11erent galaxy
classes are shown second third and fourth columns In the cid12fth sixth an seventh columns
the timescale of the SFR the B cid0 V and B cid0 K color indices are shown respectively These
later are computed using the photometric evolution code described in x The last column
indicates the kind of SED used for each type of galaxy in particular the SED of the bulge
of M is used for ESO galaxies
cid3
The assumed values for cid11 M
 and the mix recid13ect several facts First the values for the
parameters cid11 and M
of the LF of spiral galaxies are similar to those derived by Loveday
cid3
et al  for the cid12eld LFG Second there is still much uncertainty about the value of
cid11 for early-type galaxies the rather low value assumed in this paper as compared with
those obtained by several authors Efstathiou et al  Loveday  Zucca Pozzetti 
Zamorani  cid12ts better the K -counts Third there is not yet a cid12eld LF for early-type
dwarf galaxies nor for late-type dwarfs though we use the cid11 and M
values of the LF of
cid3
dEdSO galaxies and the M
value of the LF of dI galaxies obtained by Sandage Binggeli
cid3
 Tammann  for the Virgo cluster needless to say that there is no reason to expect
that these assumptions are correct Fourth the parameters for the LFI are chosen in such
a way that  the characteristic luminosity is greater than the one for ESO galaxies 
the slope at the faint end equals that of the total luminosity function and  the fraction
of I galaxies should be small At the end our mix takes into account the following facts
 the uncertainty in the fraction of strongly interacting systems  there are more spiral
galaxies than elliptical galaxies in the surveys of Efstathiou et al and Loveday et al 
there is a signicid12cant percentage of dEdSO galaxies in clusters Ferguson  Sandage 
in the poorest cluster the Leo group about   are dEdSO galaxies and  recent
determinations of the LFG Eales  Lonsdale  Chokshi  are producing a steeper
slope at the faint end cid24 cid0

The e-corrections are evaluated assuming an exponential decreasing SFR with a varying
timescale For dwarf galaxies spheroidal and irregulars it appears inappropriate to model
their light with a solar metallicity population Furthermore a choice for the SFR becomes
dicid14cult dwarf irregular galaxies are better modeled by a series of star formation bursts
followed by periods of zero star formation eg Pilyugin  The number and the strength
of the bursts and the duration of the quiescent periods are parameters that seem to depend
on the galaxy Fortunately these galaxies make a negligible contribution to the B - and
K -counts except for the fainter end eg CSP The I galaxies have no e-correction by
hypothesis
 Results
The detection rate and selection ecid11ects according to Yoshii  were evaluated but
they were not incorporated to our models The reason is the small ecid11ect they have on the
predicted B -counts In an isophotal magnitude scheme S
  B mag arcsec
 with an
cid0
imposed minimum diameter of D
 a detection rate of about  at B   is
expected in a cid10
 cid3
    scenario This amounts to a dicid11erence of just  dex at
B   see also Yoshii
In Figure  the number of galaxies versus blue magnitude is plotted for four models The
data are from Maddox et al  Lilly et al  and Metcalfe et al  There
are two non-evolving NE models one with the parameter values from Table  NE and
the other one NE KGB with the parameter values from Koo Gronwall  Bruzual 
hereafter KGB The Table  from KGB was utilized to derive the Schechter parameters for

The inclusion of the NE KGB model in Figure  is with the purpose of showing that a much
smaller dicid11erence is obtained between a NE model and the observations if the parameters
of the LFs are moved in the correct direction The other two models plotted in this Figure
are merger-driven models for two values of cid17  A signicid12cant dicid11erence is starting to observe
between each other at b
  Moreover the maximum dicid11erence between the data and
our cid17   model amounts just  dex at b

Geller  Huchra  Loveday et al 
In Figure  the number distribution in the K -band is plotted for the same models as
for the B -band except that here the NE KGB model is replaced by a merger-driven model
in which the L
in the K -band does not increase due to the startbursts model denoted
cid3
by II cid17   The data are from a compilation by Gardner Cowie  Wainscoat 
It is important to point out here the better agreement obtained by those models with a
rather high value of cid17  A redshift distribution is plotted in Figure  for two intervals of
B magnitude The histograms are redshifts for  galaxies taken from Broadhurst et al
 in the  cid20 b
cid20  range and for  galaxies taken from Colless et al 
 in the  cid20 b
cid20  interval this later survey is complete to   Our merger-
driven models predict a excess of high redshift galaxies being it greater for models with a
lower value of cid17  the model with cid17   predicts that a   of the galaxies have z  
in the  cid20 b
cid20  range clearly inconsistent with the   derived by Colless et al
This is interesting since it could be a manner to discriminate between models with number
luminosity from those with luminosity evolution The model with cid17   predicts that
about   of galaxies have z   not too far away from the observed  
It appears dicid14cult to reduce the number of high redshift galaxies by changing the param-

eters of the LF of interacting galaxies sub ject to the constraints that  a small percentage
  of galaxies are strongly interacting at the present time  the slope at the faint
end is that of the total luminosity function and  the characteristic luminosity of this
population L
 is greater than the one of ESO galaxies For the sake of the argument let
cid3
us assume we increase further the value of the parameter cid17  One might think this would
give us a better cid12t but the point is that the percentage of galaxies greater than  does not
decrease much by increasing the value of cid17  for example for cid17   it is just  compared
to the  for cid17   This point can be explained as follows as the cid17 value goes up the L
cid3
decreases as
cid3
cid3
 cid0  cid0 cid17 log   z 
so the number of high-z galaxies decreases improving the cid12t but at the same time the
number of moderate z galaxies increases due to the   z 
law worsening the cid12t At the
cid17
end the decreasing of the percentage of galaxies with z   is very small We took the
value of cid17   as a resonable estimation of the amount of mergers at z   and as a not
too bad cid12t to the z-distribution

 CONCLUSIONS
Dicid11erences of up to  mag in V-K are found when various photometric calibrations are
used On the other hand a smaller dicid11erence  mag in V-K is found when we compare the
results that come from using two reasonable IMFs the so-called KTG IMF and the Salpeter
one This is certainly negligible as far as the B or K number distributions calculations are
concerned
By using the best parameters we have in the literature for the LFs of the dicid11erent classes
of galaxies and for the mix of them we arrive to the conclusion that number and luminosity
evolution of the galaxy luminosity function are important ingredients in the explanation
of the excess observed in the B -counts Our merger-driven models require little evolution
both in number and luminosity for example at z   the total number of galaxies has
just increased by   and the percentage of I galaxies is just   model with cid17  
Moreover luminosity evolution is such that a model with cid17   predicts that about   of
galaxies have z   in the   m
  range Models with more emphasis in number
evolution reproduce better the redshift distributions the cid17   model as compared with
the cid17   one as it should be expected Despite our relative success of our models the
excess of high redshift of galaxies predicted by them indicates us that number and luminosity
evolution may not be the whole story
