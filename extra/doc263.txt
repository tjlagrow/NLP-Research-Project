Abstract We determine the evolution from z  3  0 of the galaxy
and mass correlation functions and bias factor in a 50h1Mpc CDM hy-
drodynamic simulation with 10h1kpc resolution The mass correlation
function grows with time but the galaxy correlation function shows little
evolution and is well described by a power law At early times galaxies
are biased traces of mass with bias being higher on smaller scales By
z  0 galaxies trace the mass and the bias shows little scale dependence
The correlation function of galaxies g is a standard observational mea-
sure of structure in the Universe Understanding the relationship between this
observable and the correlation of the underlying mass distribution m is cru-
cial for relating observations of galaxy clustering to predictions of cosmological
models The relationship between g and m is usually characterized through
the bias parameter b  gm where  is the rms uctuation on some specied
scale Here we investigate the evolution of g m and b in a CDM simulation
We simulate a random 50h1Mpc cube in a CDM universe with m  04
  06 H0  65 n  095 and b  002h2 We use Parallel TreeSPH
to advance 1443 gas and 1443 dark matter particles from z  49 to z  0
Our spatial resolution is 10h1 kpc and our mass resolution per particle is
mSP H  85  108M and mdark  63  109M Using a 60-particle criterion
for our simulated galaxy completeness limit 1 implies that we are resolving most
galaxies with Mbaryonic  5  1010M We include star formation and thermal
feedback Galaxies are identied using Spline Kernel Interpolative DENMAX
At z  3 2 1 and 0 we identify 929 1781 4138 and 5264 galaxies respectively
Note that the majority of galaxies form between z  2 and z  1 in this model
We consider the 500 most massive galaxies at each redshift representing
a constant comoving galaxy density of n  0004h3Mpc3 comparable to that
of Lyman break galaxies and present-day L galaxies The galaxy correlation

function g at each redshift is shown as open circles in Figure 1 A power-law
t to these points is shown as the solid line and the best-t values for the
correlation length r0 and slope  are indicated in the upper right The mass
correlation function m is shown as the dashed line

g evolves little from z  3 to z  0 in agreement with previous studies2
r0 is roughly constant with a slight increase to lower redshifts  also evolves
only slightly with g becoming steeper at low redshift Conversely m increases
substantially with time The z  0 correlation function of this model is in good
agreement with observations
The dierence in evolution of g and m is reected in the evolution of
bR We consider 4 scales R  2 4 8 and 12h1Mpc The evolution of the
bias parameter on these scales is shown in Figure 2 At early times galaxies
are highly biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution in agreement with
previous studiessee eg
3 This implies that Lyman break galaxies do not
trace the underlying mass distribution at high z For R  8h1Mpc b increases
to smaller scales at high z The bias factor declines with time on all scales and
shows little scale dependence for z  1 By z  0 b  12 on all scales from
R  2  12h1Mpc reecting 8  08 chosen for our simulation
