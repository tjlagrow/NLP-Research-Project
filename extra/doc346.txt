Abstract We present the identication of a bright submillimeter galaxy
SMG in the eld of Abell 2218 The galaxy has a spectroscopic redshift of  4
and is currently the highest redshift SMG known It is detected at all wave-
lengths from optical to submm including the Spitzer IRAC bands We discuss
the properties of this galaxy which is undergoing intense star formation at a rate
 600 Myr1 We also compare the properties to those of radio-preselected
submm-bright galaxies The z  4 result extends the redshift distribution of
Introduction
Major progress in submillimeter cosmology has been seen since the commis-
sioning of SCUBA Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array Holland et
al 1999 which was mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope JCMT
Many studies have been undertaken studying submillimeter galaxies SMGs in
large blank eld surveys and surveys of strongly lensing galaxy clusters In the
cluster surveys the gravitational lensing moves the confusion limit to ux levels
fainter than the blank eld limit of 2 mJy It has taken several years to over-
come the many complications involved in the identication of the counterparts
The large beam of 15 in diameter makes unique identications dicult How-
ever resorting to multiwavelength follow-up ranging from radio to optical it is
possible to constrain the properties of the underlying galaxy including photo-
metric redshift and the presence of AGN For more details see Smail 2006
this volume
Recently Chapman et al
2003 2005 published a large spectroscopic
survey of radio-detected bright SMGs f850  4 mJy They presented redshifts
for about 70 SMGs from several blank eld surveys  an eort which has
been crucial for quantifying the properties of the bright SMGs see Smail 2006
The redshift distribution has a median redshift of 24 Even though using
radio observations to determine the position of the underlying galaxy is a very
ecient identication technique it is likely biased towards redshifts z  35
There are candidate counterparts towards higher redshifts eg Dunlop et al

2004 however their redshifts still need to be conrmed spectroscopically We
here present details and spectroscopy for a redshift 4 counterpart
2 SMM J1635966130  redshift 4
Deep SCUBA maps at both 850m and 450m have been obtained of the cluster
eld Abell 2218 Knudsen et al 2006 Nine sources were detected four of these
having 850-uxes around 10 mJy an optical image with the SCUBA contours
is shown in Fig 1 Three of these bright sources were identied as a multi-
ply imaged background galaxy at z  2516 SMMJ163596612 Kneib et al
2004a It is for the fourth of the bright sources SMMJ1635966130 that we
here propose the identication Knudsen Kneib  Egami 2006 in preparation
SMMJ1635966130 is detected both at 850m and 450m with uxes of 11
mJy and 20 mJy respectively The lensing magnication of the source is about
45 The low ux ratio f450f850  2 is strongly suggestive of this SMG being at
redshift z  35 It is not detected in the radio maps at 14 GHz and 82 GHz
from Garrett et al 2005 which supports that this is a high redshift source
z  25
In the optical and near-infrared images there is only one galaxy within a
search radius of 8 from the submm position which is at very high redshift It
is indicated in the optical HST ACS F850LP zimage Kneib et al 2004b in
Fig 2 The position is RADecJ2000  163555666612595 and it has a
magnitude of z
850lp  2390  004 mag and of R702w  254  012 mag though
is undetected in the deep WFPC2 F606W and F450W images from Smail et al
SCUBA contours

bright asymmetric emission
line with Ly  this implies

2001 We have obtained optical spectroscopy for this source using LRIS on
Keck In the spectrum which is shown in Fig 3 we identify one emission line
The line appears to be asymmetric and with a lower continuum level on the blue
side We propose that this is Ly which implies a redshift of z  4048  0003
SMMJ1635966130 is detected at both in the optical and at near-infrared
wavelengths including the Spitzer IRAC images of A2218 Egami et al 2005
where the uxes are f36  56  07 Jy and f45  45  05 Jy In Fig 4
we show the spectral energy distribution The star formation rate is about
600 Myr1 as estimated from the SCUBA detection There is no indication of
the presence of a strong AGN

3 Extending the redshift distribution
Even though the unlensed submm ux is slightly fainter compared to the sample
of Chapman et al 2003 2005 the properties of SMMJ1635966130 are similar
to those of the radio-selected identications of the Chapman et al
sample
There are no signs of a strong dominant AGN and so likely the dominant
heating mechanism is star formation Additionally Ly is seen in emission
Hence SMMJ1635966130 is likely similar to many sources in the Chapman et
al sample
The high redshift of SMMJ1635966130 extends the redshift distribution of
SMGs as established by Chapman et al 2003 2005 While the highest redshift
identication in the sample of Chapman et al
is 36 they present models for
the redshift distribution indicating that less than 10 of the SMGs would lie
beyond that For the current SMG samples of a total of a few hundred sources
one would expect a few tens of SMGs with z  4
