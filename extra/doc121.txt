ABSTRACT
We present Kband luminosity functions for galaxies in a heterogeneous
sample of 38 clusters at 01  z  1 Using infraredselected galaxy samples
which generally reach 2 magnitudes fainter than the characteristic galaxy
luminosity L we t Schechter functions to backgroundcorrected cluster galaxy
counts to determine K  as a function of redshift Because of the magnitude limit
of our data the faint-end slope  is xed at 09 in the tting process We nd
that K z departs from noevolution predictions at z  04 and is consistent
with the behavior of a simple passive luminosity evolution model in which
galaxies form all their stars in a single burst at zf  23 in an H0  65 km s1
Mpc1 M  03   070 universe This diers from the at or negative
infrared luminosity evolution which has been reported for high redshift eld
galaxy samples We nd that the observed evolution appears to be insensitive

to cluster X-ray luminosity or optical richness implying little variation in
the evolutionary history of galaxies over the range of environmental densities
spanned by our cluster sample These results support and extend previous
analyses based on the color evolution of high redshift cluster ES0 galaxies
indicating not only that their stellar populations formed at high redshift but
that the assembly of the galaxies themselves was largely complete by z  1 and
that subsequent evolution down to the present epoch was primarily passive

Introduction
The predominance of earlytype galaxies in clusters compared to the eld is a clear
sign that the evolution of galaxies depends on environment but the physical mechanisms
at work remain the subject of considerable debate In particular the question of when and
how the most massive galaxies formed and especially the origin of giant elliptical galaxies
is a topic of ongoing vigorous theoretical and observational research The traditional
picture of elliptical galaxy formation eg Eggen Lynden-Bell  Sandage 1962 postulates
a single burst of star formation at high redshift followed by passive evolution The existence
of a tight colormagnitude relation in nearby clusters eg Bower Lucey  Ellis 1992 De
Propris et al 1999 and the close correlation between galaxy mass and metallicity implied
by the Mg2   relation Bender Burstein  Faber 1993 is explained naturally by a single
early episode of star formation If more massive galaxies are more ecient at retaining
supernova ejecta they will have higher metallicities and therefore redder colors Arimoto
 Yoshii 1987 If the colormagnitude relation is driven primarily by metal abundance
then the scatter in galaxy colors around the mean locus provides constraints on the epoch
of galaxy formation Both Bower et al 1992 and De Propris et al 1999 conclude that
the intrinsic scatter in the U  V colors of Coma galaxies is consistent with high formation
redshifts andor extreme synchronization in the epoch of galaxy formation
The picture outlined above may be overly simplistic A population of blue galaxies
is commonly encountered in clusters at moderate redshift with almost no counterpart in
present day systems Butcher  Oemler 1984 High resolution imaging indicates that
these blue galaxies are mostly latetype spirals undergoing starbursts Dressler et al 1994
Couch et al 1998 and references therein and suggests that the cluster S0 population is
far less abundant at z  05 than today Dressler et al 1997 It has been proposed that
 3 
the blue galaxies are the progenitors of cluster S0 galaxies eg Couch  Sharples 1987
In agreement with this explanation of the Butcher-Oemler eect some S0s in the present
epoch appear to contain younger stellar populations Bothun  Gregg 1990 Kuntschner
 Davies 1998 However the colors of the combined E and S0 populations in the core of
clusters show little change other than that expected from passive spectral evolution out to
z  1 even among clusters of widely varying richness and X-ray luminosity eg Stanford
Eisenhardt  Dickinson 1998 hereinafter SED98
Further complications in the monolithic collapse scenario arise if as has recently
been found in the Coma cluster by Jrgensen 1999 the mean ages and abundances of
cluster early-types are anti-correlated A relation between age and abundance could allow
signicant variations in the ages of the stellar populations in cluster early-type galaxies
while keeping the scatter in eg the color-magnitude relations small A possible correlation
between age and metallicity has been emphasized previously by Worthey Trager  Faber
1996 wherein the oldest galaxies are the most metal-poor But recent work on the
Fundamental Plane has found support for a scenario in which age varies directly with
metallicity in elliptical galaxies ie the most luminous ellipticals are the oldest and most
metal rich in a wide range of environments from the eld to the Coma cluster Pahre De
Carvalho  Djorgovski 1998 suggesting that there still exists considerable controversy in
such studies
Hierarchical structure formation models present a very dierent view of galaxy
evolution in which galaxies assemble by a process of gradually merging smaller stellar
systems over a wide range of redshifts eg Cole et al 1994 Some key factors governing
the spectrophotometric evolution of elliptical galaxies in this scenario are the time at which
the bulk of the stellar populations are formed the era when the majority of mergers take
place and the amount of new star formation induced during each merging event in the
construction of a large galaxy If the formation of a large fraction of the stars in a giant
elliptical galaxy is distributed over a broad cosmic time interval then ellipticals at any
redshift should exhibit a wide range in their massweighted stellar ages If however most
stars in presentday cluster ellipticals were formed in smaller disk galaxies at large lookback
times z  1 and if little additional star formation takes place during subsequent mergers
then the endproduct ellipticals could appear to be old and approximately coeval even if
the bulk of the merging took place relatively late The hierarchical models of Kaumann
 Charlot 1998a reproduce the colormagnitude relation for ellipticals because more
massive galaxies are the product of systematically more massive progenitors which retain
more metals when forming their stars
Discriminating between the formation scenarios described above is dicult even by
 4 
studying galaxies in clusters at high redshift The evolution of the color magnitude relation
to z  1 has been discussed by many workers in the eld eg Aragon-Salamanca et al
1993 Lubin 1996 Ellis et al 1997 and SED98 Most results are consistent with the high
galaxy formation redshifts and subsequent passive evolution favored by monolithic collapse
But even the most comprehensive study spanning the largest redshift range SED98 could
not exclude the possibility that cluster ellipticals formed more recently from mergers of
smaller galaxies as long as the bulk of the stellar mass was created at much larger redshifts
and there was little recent star formation in the subsequent merging process Kaumann 
Charlot 1998a have also argued that by selecting galaxies exclusively from rich clusters
studies such as those of Ellis et al 1997 and SED98 introduce an increasingly strong
bias at higher redshifts toward galaxies that have formed at earlier epochs and therefore
that the conclusions cannot be extended to the general cluster galaxy population today
An additional concern is that SED98 and Ellis et al 1997 selected galaxies only from the
densest core regions of clusters imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope HST
An alternative and potentially more powerful means of testing models of galaxy
formation is to determine the mass function of galaxies over a large redshift range The
actual mass function is dicult to measure although recent kinematic studies of the
fundamental plane of cluster galaxies at high redshift eg Kelson et al 1997 van Dokkum
et al 1998 have made an important step in this direction The Kband luminosity function
LF may serve as a useful surrogate Traditional optical LFs have been used as a sensitive
probe of the bulk properties of galaxy populations both in the local universe eg Binggeli
Sandage  Tammann 1988 and at high redshift eg Lilly et al 1995b Ellis et al 1996
Cowie et al 1996 Although they are special environments galaxy clusters are convenient
to study because their luminosity functions can be measured without extensive spectroscopy
by using statistical eld galaxy subtraction Infrared luminosities are particularly well
suited for dening luminosity functions because they broadly reect the total stellar mass of
the galaxies and do not depend strongly on the details of their stellar populations Gavazzi
Pierini  Boselli 1996 This allows us to study luminosity evolution at wavelengths where
the masstolight ratio is comparatively insensitive to the star formation history cf Madau
Pozzetti  Dickinson 1998 In addition i the eects of extinction are much weaker at
infrared wavelengths than in the optical ii the infrared LF appears to be independent
of environment De Propris et al 1998 and iii kcorrections for infrared colors are only
weakly dependent on Hubble type and vary slowly with redshift eg Poggianti 1997
Luminosities derived from observed magnitudes depend on the assumed cosmology
In addition cosmology aects the evolution of galaxy luminosities and colors by setting
the relationship between lookback time and redshift Jointly constraining the cosmological
parameters galaxy formation redshifts and star formation histories is beyond the scope of
 5 
this paper Therefore when comparing our data to evolutionary models we will constrain
the discussion to a limited set of cosmologies We adopt the parameters M  03 and
  07 with H0  65 km s1 Mpc1 for consistency Perlmutter et al 1998 Riess et al
1998 as our default cosmology These high redshift supernovae results currently provide
the strongest evidence for non-zero  cosmologies In our analysis we also consider more
traditional M  03   00 and M  1   00 models
In this paper we derive Kband LFs for a large sample of clusters at 01  z  1 Since
we remove eld galaxy contamination statistically we are sensitive to all morphological
types and are not biased towards ES0 galaxies over the covered magnitude range unlike
SED98 where the spiral and irregular galaxies were excluded Our sample consists of the
clusters reported in SED98 plus an additional set described below We use the entire elds
surveyed by our ground-based Kband imaging rather than the smaller HST elds studied
by SED98 The sample of 38 clusters spans a large range in several cluster properties and so
may constitute a reasonably fair sample of cluster galaxy populations brighter than K   2
over roughly half the age of the universe
The structure of this paper is as follows In section 2 we describe our observations
and photometry Section 3 discusses stargalaxy separation statistical subtraction of eld
galaxies and the derivation of the cluster luminosity functions In section 4 we analyze the
results and consider their implications for cluster galaxy evolution
2 Observations Data Reduction and Photometry
The overall sample of clusters presented here is large and heterogeneous consisting of
38 clusters at 014  z  092 drawn from a variety of optical X-ray and radio selected
samples The redshift distribution of the whole sample is shown in Figure 1 As part of a
survey more fully described in SED98 JHKs images of the clusters were obtained using IR
array cameras on NOAO telescopes at Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo in 19931996 The lower
redshift clusters were observed at the 21 m telescope at KPNO using IRIM which has a
256256 HgCdTe array with 109 arcsec pixels and at the 15 m telescope at CTIO using
CIRIM which has a 256  256 HgCdTe array with 116 arcsec pixels and OSIRIS which
had a 256  256 HgCdTe array with 095 arcsec pixels The highest redshift clusters were
observed at the 4 m telescope at KPNO using IRIM where it has 06 arcsec pixels Two of
the clusters Abell 370 and 851 were observed in 1991 with SQIID which had 256  256
PtSi detectors with 130 arcsec pixels as reported in Stanford Eisenhardt  Dickinson 1995
hereinafter SED95 The sample of clusters is summarized in Table 1 along with details on
the observations such as the telescopeinstrument eld size and number of objects within
 6 
the eld for each cluster
Exposure times in all bandpasses were chosen to provide galaxy photometry with
SN  5 for galaxies with the spectral energy distributions of presentday ellipticals down
to 2 magnitudes fainter than L unevolved at the cluster redshift This permits us to
study galaxy properties over a similar range of luminosities for all clusters in our sample
regardless of their redshifts Table 1 lists the K magnitude limit used to dene the object
sample for each cluster Our images typically cover a eld size of 1 to 18 Mpc at the
cluster redshift the actual eld size is given in Table 1 for each cluster The IR images
were calibrated onto the CIT system wherein Vega has m  0 The typical rms of the
transformations is 003 The eective angular resolution of the images is generally limited
by the large pixel scale of the infrared arrays and is 17 arcsec for the z  06 clusters
and 12 arcsec for the more distant objects
Object detection was carried out on the K images using a modied version Adelberger
personal communication of FOCAS Valdes 1982 which was also used to obtain total
magnitudes The observing methods data reduction techniques and photometric methods
for our groundbased data set are described in more detail in SED95 All photometry has
been corrected for reddening using the interstellar extinction curve given in Mathis 1990
with values for EB  V  taken from Burstein  Heiles 1982
3 Analysis
In order to derive LFs for our clusters we need to remove contamination by stars in
our Galaxy and by background and foreground galaxies Finally we t Schechter 1976
functions to the summed LF of the clusters in discrete redshift bins We describe the
procedures employed in the next three subsections
31 Star-Galaxy Separation
The Kband images generally lack suciently high angular resolution to eectively
distinguish stars from galaxies on the basis of image concentration or sharpness Instead
we use color criteria and models Huang et al 1997 nd that a line corresponding to the
equation B  I  25 I  K  2 separates stars and galaxies eectively in a colorcolor
plane Our cluster data do not always span such a large wavelength range therefore we
devise a dierent criterion based on infrared colors which are available for all our objects
As described in SED98 we used HST images to determine morphologies for objects
 7 
detected in our Kband images of a subset of the clusters in the whole sample For this
subsample we plot J  K vs K in Figure 2 As is well known stars generally lie in the
region J  K  1 eg Leggett 1992 whereas the kcorrection for nearly all but the most
local galaxies makes their observed J  K  1 To test this we compare counts of stars
in the 100 arcmin2 IR eld survey of Elston Eisenhardt  Stanford 1999 hereinafter
EES selected by the color criterion of Huang et al 1997 with those selected using our
J  K criterion and with Galaxy star count models from Bahcall  Soneira 1980 1981
as modied for use in the infrared according to Mamon  Soneira 1982 Figure 3 plots
star counts in the four elds of EES as a function of K Star counts using our J  K
criterion and that of Huang et al 1997 agree with each other and with the models down
to about K  18 3 magnitudes brighter than the 5  level in the EES data where both
techniques overpredict the model star counts At K  18 however the eld galaxy counts
outnumber those of the stars in any of the EES elds by 101 and thus the details of the
stellar contamination correction are unimportant beyond this magnitude We have used
our J  K discriminator to eliminate stars more than 3 magnitudes brighter than the 5 
limit of each clusters K data and then switch to the Bahcall  Soneira model predictions
at fainter magnitudes In the end the stellar contamination amounts to only a few stars
per half-magnitude bin in each cluster
32 Galaxy Counts
We need to correct our cluster galaxy number counts for contamination by background
and foreground galaxies This is carried out statistically using eld galaxy counts from our
own observations Dickinson et al 1999 EES and the literature Our primary source is
the Kband photometry of EES which has been carried out in exactly the same manner as
for our clusters
In Figure 4 we plot K counts from the EES survey the Hubble Deep Field North
HDFN using the ground based IR imaging of Dickinson et al 1999 and a selection of
deep K counts from the literature Error bars are calculated following the recipes of Huang
et al 1997 to include an extra contribution due to galaxy clustering The agreement
between the various data sets is generally good within the variation expected from counting
statistics There is an excess in the HDFN at 17  K  19 comparison of the J  K
color distribution of these galaxies with objects of the same magnitude in EES shows no
dierence We suggest that this excess is due to a random enhancement in the numbers of
bright galaxies in the small HDFN volume
Next we obtain linear ts to the K  16 and K  18 counts For K  16 we derive a
 8 
slope of 0677 in excellent agreement with the 0689 of Huang et al 1997 For K  18 we
nd a slope of 0302 steeper than the 0261 of Huang et al but in satisfactory agreement
with other Kband counts eg Moustakas et al 1997 Finally we correct for eld galaxies
using the K  16 relation for objects at K  17 and the K  18 relation for fainter objects
normalized to the area observed in each cluster Errors for these galaxy counts used for
background subtraction are calculated according to the prescription of Huang et al After
subtracting stars and eld galaxies the remaining numbers of objects in each cluster which
are assumed to be member galaxies are given in Table 1 in the column Nmemb
33 Luminosity Functions
We divide our sample of clusters into 10 redshift bins with central z between 015
and 09 as listed in Table 2 Each bin includes typically four clusters but this number
varies from bin to bin For example there are only two clusters in each of the z  015
and 025 bins and so the errors on the tted K  are relatively large For each cluster we
determine the appropriate magnitude intervals based on the dierence between the cluster
redshift and the midpoint redshift of each bin including the small kcorrection so that the
intervals will align at the midpoint redshift For example the K  1625  1675 interval
for the midpoint z  0397 bin corresponds to K  1638  1689 for GHO 03031706 at
z  0418 We then count the objects in the appropriate 05 magnitude intervals removing
stars from the brighter intervals using J  K colors Finally faint stars and eld galaxies
are removed by interpolating model counts to these intervals using the methods specied in
31 and 32 Errors in the raw cluster counts and in the star count models are assumed
to be Poissonian whereas for contaminating galaxies we add an extra contribution due to
clustering as in 32 We assume errors propagate in quadrature
For each redshift bin we sum number counts for all clusters in order to reduce shot
noise and average over uncertainties in background subtraction We t the composite LF
in each bin with a Schechter function xing the faint end slope to have   09 This is
the value measured in the infrared LF of the Coma cluster for K  K   3 De Propris et
al 1998 and also for the eld Gardner et al 1997 We choose not to t  because our
photometry only reaches to 2 magnitudes below L The optical LFs for bright cluster
galaxies also have   1 although there is considerable variation in the slope fainter
than four magnitudes below L We derive values for K  and the associated errors using
the maximum likelihood technique of Sandage Tammann  Yahil 1979 Luminosity
functions for each of our redshift bins are shown in Figure 5 The derived values and their
1 uncertainties are given in Table 2
 9 
Finally we have divided the sample in two ways in an attempt to ascertain the eects of
cluster mass on K z First we separated by X-ray luminosity Table 1 at LX  4  1044
ergs1 s1 0335 keV This is close to the characteristic L
function measured at similar redshifts Rosati et al 1998 X-ray data were available for
27 clusters from our sample the remaining 11 were excluded from this analysis X-ray
luminosity correlates with total cluster mass which may be the main parameter of interest
for testing theoretical models of galaxy formation in clusters Schechter functions were t
separately to the low and highLX subsamples again binned by redshift with  xed at
09 The tted K  are given in Table 3 and the LFs are shown in Figure 6
X of the X-ray luminosity
We also divided the clusters on the basis of member surface density as a measure
of the cluster richness The statistical Nmemb were normalized by the eld size of the
K-band images to calculate the near-IR cluster galaxy density For this purpose clusters
were excluded for which our K-band images were relatively shallow compared to the other
data at similar redshift The excluded clusters are MS 125390456 Cl 2244-02 Abell
370 3C 313 Vidal 14 and 3C 34 The remaining 32 clusters were divided at a member
surface density of 85 Mpc2 into rich and poor groupings Again Schechter functions were
t separately to the rich and poor subsamples binned by redshift with  xed at 09 The
tted K  are given in Table 4 and the LFs are shown in Figure 7
4 Discussion
The behavior of the characteristic magnitude K  with redshift is shown in Figure 8
along with spectral synthesis models for noevolution ie pure kcorrection and passive
evolution constructed using GISSEL Bruzual  Charlot 1993 1997 hereinafter BC All
galaxy models used in this paper form stars in a 01 Gyr burst with a Salpeter IMF and
with solar metallicity The models plotted in Figure 8 were normalized to K   109  02
at the Coma cluster De Propris et al 1998 although this normalization was left free for
the statistical tests described below The noevolution NE predictions use model spectra
with ages of 10 Gyr for the M  1   0 cosmology 11 Gyr for M  03   0 and
12 Gyr for M  03   07 However in the near infrared the spectra of galaxies vary so
little that virtually any reasonable model spectrum yields very similar kcorrections
The observed K  vs z relation is inconsistent with an unevolving luminosity function
especially for the lowM cosmologies The measured K  values become systematically
brighter at higher redshifts relative to the NE models We have tested our data against the
three NE models including the Coma K  data point and allowing for free normalization
of the absolute magnitude scaling A simple leastsquares t gives the following values
 10 
for the reduced 2 for 10 degrees of freedom 30 for M  1   0 40 for M  03
  0 and 62 for M  03   07 The formal probabilities of these models being
consistent with the data are 88  104 16  105 and 15  109 respectively The
anticorrelation of absolute magnitude with redshift ie luminosity evolution was examined
by applying the Spearman rankorder test to the dierence between the data points and
the NE models This gives correlation coecients of 083 086 and 090 for the above
three cosmologies The probabilities that these anticorrelations would arise by chance from
an unevolving data set are 84  104 40  104 and 80  105 respectively
The passively evolving models were calculated for the M  03   0 and M  03
  07 cosmologies assuming H0  65 km s1 Mpc1 and with formation redshifts zf  2
and 3 These provide a better t to the data than do the NE models We do not attempt
to discriminate statistically between the dierent evolving models because the cosmological
parameters formation redshifts and star formation histories can be traded o against one
another to yield comparably good ts for dierent scenarios For passively evolving models
in the   07 cosmology zf  2 provides a slightly better t than does zf  3 while for
  0 the zf  3 model is favored Extending this analysis to clusters at z  1 should help
to distinguish between the dierent models
Barger et al 1998 presented Kband LFs for a sample of 10 clusters at 031  z  056
Assuming a xed   10 H0  50 km1 s1 Mpc1 and q0  05 they found M Krest
of 2541 2551 and 2529 for their redshift bins at z  031 040 and 056
respectively They claimed no signicant luminosity evolution from a comparison of these
values with the M Krest  251 determined by Mobasher et al 1993 for a local eld
sample However the expected departure from noevolution at z  056 the highest
redshift bin in Barger et al is 05 mag in the observed Kband which is only about
twice the errors in their derived M Krest If the Barger et al values are compared with
M Krest  248  5 log h50 which we have measured for the Coma cluster De Propris et
al 1998 they are consistent with the amount of passive evolution that we observe Another
recent study of the Kband LF in distant clusters Trentham  Mobasher 1998 appears to
nd no evolution though this is dicult to discern because no Schechter function ts were
made and their data covered small areas in only 5 clusters By tting infrared LFs using
a uniform data set that spans a very wide range of redshifts we have measured evolution
within a single cluster sample without requiring comparisons to measurements from other
published samples which were observed and analyzed in a dierent way
Our key result is the consistency between the observed evolution of the infrared
luminosities of cluster galaxies and their color evolution as manifested by the slope scatter
and intercept of the colormagnitude relation Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 SED95
 11 
SED98 Ellis et al 1997 Both are fully consistent with simple passive spectrophotometric
evolution of a galaxy population which has been largely stable throughout the redshift range
0  z  1 Kaumann  Charlot 1998a have shown that the apparently passive evolution
of the colormagnitude relation can be accommodated within a hierarchical model even if
the galaxies themselves still grow by mergers until late times Our new measurements show
that galaxies in high redshift clusters also follow the same intrinsic luminosity distribution
as do those today once passive evolution is taken into account strongly suggesting that
their bulk stellar masses have not increased substantially since z  1 It is interesting to
note that AragonSalamanca et al 1998 nd that the brightest cluster galaxies BCGs
exhibit a rather dierent behavior with infrared luminosities which are fainter at high
redshift once the expected evolution of their stellar populations is taken into account They
interpret this as evidence that BCGs have grown with time by accretion a behavior which
we would suggest is not shared by the bulk of the cluster population
Previous photometric studies of earlytype cluster galaxies at other wavelengths have
reached conclusions that are qualitatively similar to our own The rest frame Bband
surface brightnesses of cluster ellipticals at z  12 have been shown to be consistent
with high-z formation and passive evolution Dickinson 1995 1997 Pahre Djorgovski 
De Carvalho 1996 Schade Barrientos  Lopez-Cruz 1997 Barger et al 1998 albeit with
large uncertainties Moreover recent studies exploiting the full power of the Fundamental
Plane now probe nearly the same redshift range as do our LFs eg Kelson et al 1997 van
Dokkum et al 1998 These have shown that the restframe Bband masstolight ratio
ML of earlytype cluster galaxies evolved in a manner consistent with passive luminosity
evolution Early results derived from a small sample at z  083 indicate a limit on the
formation redshift for cluster ellipticals of zf  17 in an M  03   07 universe
van Dokkum et al 1998 If the evolution of both ML and of the luminosity function
can be consistently explained by passive stellar evolution then it would follow that the
mass function of cluster galaxies is approximately invariant over the range of redshifts and
luminosities which have been studied to date
The luminosity evolution that we observe in our cluster sample is strikingly dierent
from that which has been reported for eld galaxy samples particularly those selected in the
nearinfrared or limited to earlytype galaxies only Cowie et al 1996 present restframe
Kband luminosity functions derived from a eld galaxy sample spanning 0  z  16
and nd that L
K remains constant or declines at higher redshifts Similarly Kaumann
Charlot  White 1996 cite evidence for a strong negative luminosity evolution of
earlytype eld galaxies selected by color from the CanadaFrance Redshift Survey Lilly
et al 1995a Kaumann  Charlot 1998b have highlighted the decit of high redshift
galaxies at K  19 in the infraredselected surveys of Songaila et al 1994 and Cowie et
 12 
al 1996
This apparent decit of bright high redshift eld galaxies has been cited as evidence
supporting hierarchical models which would assemble the most massive galaxies at relatively
late epochs This interpretation is not necessarily inconsistent with our measurements
since eld and cluster galaxies may follow dierent evolutionary histories Indeed in the
semianalytic models of Kaumann  Charlot 1998a cluster ellipticals form earlier than
eld ellipticals and might therefore be expected to show dierent luminosity evolution
At some level if the assembly of galaxies is pushed back to higher redshifts in denser
environments then it is inevitable that their subsequent behavior will more closely resemble
passive evolution at late times and the distinction between passive and hierarchical
models will blur
There is conicting evidence on the question of the dependence of elliptical galaxy
evolution on environment Schade et al 1996 nd no dierence in the MB-log re relations
of distant eld and cluster ellipticals Bernardi et al 1998 nd nearly identical Mg2-
relations for eld and cluster ellipticals from large nearby galaxy samples and use this
to limit mean age dierences to be  1 Gyr arguing that the bulk of stars in galactic
spheroids was formed at high redshift independent of environmental density This is
also the conclusion reached by De Propris et al 1998 on the basis of the very similar
infrared luminosity functions of eld and cluster galaxies On the other hand Worthey
and collaborators eg Worthey 1997 and references therein have suggested that eld
ES0 galaxies span a large range of ages on the basis of Balmer line strengths in their
integrated spectra This is not necessarily inconsistent with our ndings since relatively
small bursts suce to account for the observations Conversely far-ultraviolet components
may signicantly aect the use of narrow band spectral indices as age indicators Davies
Sadler  Peletier 1993
Kaumann  Charlot 1998a suggest that studies of galaxies in rich clusters are
strongly biased as they select massive objects whose members are likely to have formed
at high redshift in any scenario for structure formation They argue that the evidence
for passive evolution comes from selecting samples which are most likely to be passively
evolving Our sample includes clusters which span two orders of magnitude in X-ray
luminosity with a wide range of optical richness and presumably also of mass As
described in 33 we have divided our cluster data into subsamples with high and low
X-ray luminosity and with rich and poor member density in order to test whether the
luminosity evolution depends on the mass andor optical richness of the cluster The
behavior of K  vs z for the two X-ray subsamples Figure 9 and for the rich vs poor
groupings Figure 10 appear to be similar in each case The only exception is in the highest
 13 
redshift bin in the rich vs poor comparisons where K  for the rich clusters is brighter than
that of the poor clusters at about the 2 level Overall these two methods both indicate
that the luminosity evolution of massive galaxies is similar across the range of cluster
environments spanned by our sample and that biases of the type suggested by Kaumann
 Charlot 1998a are likely to be weak at least for environments richer than groups
The LFs presented here sum the entire population of galaxies within a radius of 05
to 1 Mpc from the cluster centers For K  K   2 this is likely to be dominated by ES0
galaxies and early type spirals although the morphologydensity and morphologyradius
relationships appear to be weaker in clusters at high redshift Dressler et al 1997 It is
unclear how the changing morphological mix of galaxies in distant clusters might aect the
Kband luminosity functions but the presence of an increasingly numerous population of
blue starforming cluster galaxies at higher redshifts does not t well within any simple
model of pure passive evolution Since the infrared LF primarily measures the distribution
of stellar mass among galaxies the apparently passive luminosity evolution and active
ButcherOemler population might be reconciled if the starbursts involve only a small
fraction of the total mass in each galaxy Indeed population synthesis models show that
even relatively small amounts of star formation in terms of the total stellar mass fraction
can account for the colors of most blue galaxies in distant clusters Barger et al 1996
5 Conclusions
We have presented Kband luminosity functions for a heterogeneous sample of 38
galaxy clusters spread over 01  z  1 Schechter function ts to the eldcorrected galaxy
counts yield K  values brighter than would be expected for a nonevolving population
of earlytype galaxies at z  04 in low  cosmologies and consistent with pure passive
luminosity evolution This result supports and extends our previous results based on
analysis of the color evolution of earlytype cluster galaxies over the same redshift range
The positive luminosity evolution for cluster galaxies appears to dier from the at or
negative evolution which has been reported for infrared and colorselected eld galaxy
samples out to z  1 Cowie et al 1996 Kaumann Charlot  White 1996 Kaumann 
Charlot 1998b perhaps suggesting a dierent evolutionary history for massive galaxies in
dierent environments However we do not observe dierent evolution when we divide our
cluster sample by X-ray luminosity or by richness
These observations point to the importance of obtaining a census of galaxy properties
over a wide range of environments for understanding the mechanisms which drive galaxy
evolution Hierarchical models in which collisionless dark matter dominates galaxy dynamics
 14 
and evolution generally postulate that the formation of massive galaxies such as cluster
ellipticals takes place by accretion and mergers that continue to low redshift Our results
indicate that the stellar populations of massive galaxies K  K   2 in cluster cores form
at relatively high redshifts z  2 and suggest that the assembly of those galaxies is largely
complete by z  1
