ABSTRACT
Context In the recent years Stellar Mass Functions of both star forming and quiescent galaxies have been observed at dierent
redshifts in various elds In addition Star Formation Rate distributions eg in the form of far infrared luminosity functions were
also obtained Taken together they oer complementary pieces of information concerning the evolution of galaxies
Aims We attempt in this paper to check the consistency of the observed stellar mass functions SFR functions and the cosmic star
formation rate density with simple backward evolutionary models
MethodsStarting from observed Stellar Mass Functions for star-forming galaxies we use backwards models to predict the evolution
of a number of quantities such as the SFR function the cosmic SFR density and the Velocity Function The velocity being a parameter
attached to a galaxy during its history contrary to the stellar mass this approach allows us to quantify the number density evolution
of galaxies of a given velocity eg of the Milky Way siblings
Results Observations suggest that the Stellar Mass Function of star forming galaxies is constant between redshift 0 and 1 In order
to reproduce this result we must quench star formation in a number of star forming galaxies The Stellar Mass Function of these
quenched galaxies is consistent with available data concerning the increase in the population of quiescent galaxies in the same
redshift interval The Stellar Mass Function of quiescent galaxies is then mainly determined by the distribution of active galaxies that
must stop star formation with a modest mass redistribution during mergers The cosmic SFR density and the evolution of the SFR
functions are relatively well recovered although they provide some clue for a small evolution of the Stellar Mass Function of star
forming galaxies at the lowest redshifts We thus consider that we have obtained in a simple way a relatively consistent picture of the
evolution of galaxies at intermediate redshifts We note that if this picture is correct 50 of the Milky-Way sisters galaxies with the
same velocity as our Galaxy ie 220 kms have quenched their star formation since redshift 1 and an even larger fraction for larger
velocities We discuss the processes that might be responsible for this transformation

1 Introduction
In the last few years the analysis of many deep elds together
with improvements in techniques such as SED-tting have en-
abled many studies of the Stellar Mass Function SMF of galax-
ies at both low and high redshifts eg Bell et al 2003 2007
Borch et al 2006 Bundy et al 2005 2006 Arnouts et al 2007
Vergani et al 2008 Perez-Gonzalez et al 2008 Pozzetti et al
2009 Ilbert et al 2009 One of the somewhat surprising re-
sult is that it is generally found that the SMF of star forming
galaxies selected on the basis of color morphology or spec-
troscopy has not evolved much between redshift about unity and
the present time eg Bell et al 2007 Cowie et al 2008 Vergani
et al 2008 Pozzetti et al 2009 The analysis of the evolution of
the Luminosity Function had already suggested that the stellar
mass of blue galaxies is constant while the one of red galaxies
increases with time Faber et al 2007
Since star formation is undergoing in such galaxies the stel-
lar mass in each of them is bound to increase This maintained
status quo of the SMF thus indicates that a number of mas-
sive star forming galaxies must evolve towards early type or
at least quiescent galaxies through quenching of their star for-
mation as noted in Bell et al 2007 and Arnouts et al 2007
while they are replaced by lower mass galaxies gaining mass
with time see also Pozzetti et al 2009 This type of scenario
was also advanced in Brown et al 2007 to explain the doubling
of the stellar mass in red galaxies over the past 8 Gyrs Such a
quenching is also constrained by the evolution of the co-moving
Star Formation Rate SFR density ie the SFR averaged over
representative volumes of the universe dropping by a factor 6 to
10 between redshift 1 and 0 see the compilations of Wilkins et
al 2008 and Hopkins and Beacom 2006
It is reasonable to think that even at intermediate redshifts
dened broadly as 0  z  1 star formation takes place in
normal star forming galaxies such as the precursors to present
day disk-galaxies and the Milky Way Smooth SFR histories are
known to be realistic and capture enough of the physics of such
galaxies see eg models in Boissier  Prantzos 1999 2000
This is especially suggested by the facts that we see star forma-
tion at intermediate redshift in rotating disks that should have
formed through smooth accretion eg Shapiro et al 2008 and
that most of the galaxies forming the bulk of the infra-red emis-
sion at redshift unity look like undisturbed disk galaxies eg
Bell 2005 Melbourne et al 2005 Lotz et al 2008 The tight-
ness of the SFR-Stellar Mass relationship also suggests that the
evolution is mostly driven by smooth evolution and not starbursts
Noeske 2009 Noeske et al2007 The kinematics and morphol-
ogy are more disturbed at high redshift than in the local universe
but this fact is still consistent with minor merger and gas accre-
tion eg Ziegler et al 2009 although this is still debated eg
Neichel et al 2008 Finally it has also been shown that models
of the chemical and spectro-photometric evolution of the Milky

Way and nearby disk galaxies when rolled backwards t in a
very reasonable way the properties of redshift  07 star forming
galaxies Buat et al 2008
In this paper we propose to combine such models with the
information from the SMF in order to compute the evolution of
the Velocity Function with the advantage that the velocity tags
a galaxy while the stellar mass evolves with redshift when star
formation takes place eg Noeske 2009 mentions the intrinsic
diculty in comparing galaxies of a given stellar mass at dier-
ent redshifts This allows us to check the global consistency of
the SMF the SFR of individual galaxies the cosmic SFR den-
sity and simple models of galactic evolution It is then possible
to derive the fraction of galaxies that were similar to the Milky
Way the Milky Way siblings and that must have quenched
their star formation during the second half of the history of the
universe We acknowledge that this approach is simplistic but
we think it is worth performing it since it allows us to step back
and have a global look at all the important data of the problem
Stellar Mass Functions of quiescent and star forming galaxies
SFR functions cosmic SFR density in a simple educational
framework while many studies focus only on some of these as-
pects with however interesting exceptions as eg Hopkins et al
2009 or Bell et al 2007
In section 2 we present the backward models of the evolu-
tion of star forming galaxies that we use In section 3 we com-
pute the velocity function and its evolution assuming a constant
SMF as suggested by the observations In section 4 the conse-
quences of our simple assumptions are discussed In section 5 a
summary of our work is proposed
2 Backward evolutionary models
Following the backward approach of Silk  Bouwens 1999
we make the assumption that the properties of star forming
galaxies at high redshift can be inferred by rolling backward

models of the evolution of well studied present day disk galax-
ies This is motivated especially by Buat et al 2008 showing
that such backward models reproduce the average specic SFR -
Stellar Mass relationships observed in galaxies at redshift 0 and
In the present work we use the same basic models and
we remind below their main ingredients These models are
based on the grid proposed in Boissier  Prantzos 1999 and
Boissier  Prantzos 2000 for the Milky Way and nearby spi-
ral galaxies calibrated to reproduce many observed trends in
the local universe eg colour-magnitudes diagrams luminosity-
metallicity relationship gas fractions colour and metallic-
ity gradients A comparison of this grid with the prop-
erties of galaxies at redshifts lower than 1 was proposed
in Boissier  Prantzos 2001 Note that we changed the
Initial Mass Function IMF
Kroupa 2001 motivated by the fact that this IMF is closer to
the one used in general in studies of the SMF It is also provid-
ing a better t to the UV surface brightness proles of some of
the SINGS galaxies Munos Mateos et al in preparation The
change aects mostly the most massive stars thus the UV emis-
sion and metallicity output leaving the SFR gas stellar mass
evolution changed by less than about 20 This number is below
from Kroupa et al 1993
S Boissier et al Stellar Mass and Velocity Functions of Galaxies Backward evolution  the fate of Milky Way siblings
the typical uncertainty that we can expect in our models Indeed
the calibrations used to measure stellar masses or SFR on which
are based the models can easily be changed by a factor 15 to
2 for instance adopting dierent IMFs eg Bell et al 2007
The eciency of the star formation law a basic ingredient of the
model is also varying within a factor 2 between galaxies eg
Kennicutt et al 1998 As a result we do not expect such mod-
els to give results to a better accuracy than a factor 2
The grid of models was constructed adopting various circular
velocity V and various values of the spin parameter  mea-
suring the specic angular momentum of the galaxy With sim-
ple scaling relationships this allowed the reproduction of the
observed ranges of stellar masses and sizes of disk galaxies the
used scaling relationships imply that galaxies with larger veloc-
ities are more massive and galaxies with larger spin parameter
have larger spatial extent For each couple of values of the pa-
rameters  V the corresponding model provides one unique
history of the galaxy that includes the evolution of the SFR and
of the stellar mass resulting from the combination of a star for-
mation law see eg Kennicutt 1998 Boissier et al 2003 and
the accretion of cold gas at a rate choosen to reproduce the
observations in nearby galaxies For simplicity and following
Buat et al 2008 we adopt here the average value of the spin
parameter 005 and concentrate on the dependences on stel-
lar mass the mass of a galaxy depends on the circular velocity
as M  V3 A distribution of spin parameter would create a
small dispersion around the main trends shown in the paper as a
function of the stellar mass The fact that the mass is the main in-
trinsic parameter of the evolution of galaxies was already found
in local studies eg Gavazzi et al 1996 and conrmed in
the recent years at high redshift eg Noeske 2009 Thus in
this paper for a given velocity we have one star formation his-
tory that can be seen in Fig 6 of Buat et al 2008 For high
velocities the SFR presents a rapid rise followed by a exponen-
tially declining star formation rate For V  220 kms corre-
sponding to the case of our Milky Way the history is similar
with a modest decline in agreement with the observational con-
straints available in our Galaxy Going to even smaller velocity
towards less massive galaxies the SFR gently rises with time
Summarizing in simple words the stars are formed earlier in
galaxies with large velocities than in those with low velocities
We stress that these SFR Histories are not especially picked for
this work On the contrary they result from the assumptions that
one has to make to reproduce among others the distribution of
metallicity in the Solar Neighborhood G-dwarf stars Boissier
 Prantzos 1999 implying a long time-scale for the formation
of our Galaxy the colors and metallicity Boissier  Prantzos
2000 the star formation eciency and gas fractions Boissier
et al 2001 of nearby galaxies especially as a function of the
luminosity or the stellar mass Of course the evolution might be
more complicated than in these models and there is no unique
solution however the general trends of these star formation his-
tories are robusts in view of the constraints involved
Since Stellar Mass and SFR play a central role in our
analysis we show in Fig 1 the relation between these two
quantities in our models for various redshifts The redshifts
are chosen to correspond to the data of Ilbert et al 2009 and
Arnouts et al 2007 to which we compare our results later in the
paper Note that the dependence of the various quantities on the
circular velocity were initially computed only for a few points
These relations were interpolated on a ner grid and smoothed in
order to avoid oscillations or articial breaks due to the limited
number of computed points This allows us to present a smooth
curve in this plot and the others in the remaining of the paper
As mentioned earlier there are evidences that these simple
models capture enough of the properties of star forming galax-
ies up to redshift  07 Boissier  Prantzos 2001 Buat et al
2008 We present in Fig 2 in addition the relationship between
the stellar mass and SFR for a set of redshifts for which vari-
ous observations are available This simple comparison shows
that up to redshift 1 the model reproduces quite well the aver-
age trends found in observations with serious departures start-
ing only to be present at redshifts larger than 1 Especially
at redshift  2 for galaxies more massive than 1010 Mfor
which observations are available the models tend to underes-
timate the actual SFR for a given stellar mass This dierence
between observations and models was found by other authors
eg Dave 2008 Santini et al 2009 using semi-analytical or
hydrodynamical models Dave 2008 suggests that a solution
might be a modication of the IMF with redshift As noted
by Santini et al 2009 Khochfar  Silk 2009 propose that the
star formation eciency in high redshift galaxies is higher owing
to cold gas accretion Neither of these eects probably still to be
debated are included in our models and our strongest conclu-
sions will be limited to redshifts lower than about unity where
they are not needed
The various quantities presented in the paper assume a
Kroupa 2001 IMF and a H070 M03 07 cosmol-
3 Derivation of the velocity function
The SMF of star forming galaxies has little evolved between red-
shift 1 and redshift 0 In Fig 3 we present the observed SMF
of Bell et al 2003 at redshift 0 with two dierent denitions
of the star forming sample based on either color or concentra-
tion and those from Ilbert et al 2009 Arnouts et al 2007
and Borch et al 2006 in various redshift bins restricted to
z1 This gure conrms that the evolution of the SMF for
Star Forming galaxies if any is quite small lower than 02 dex
with respect to the dierence between the various studies that
can reach about 05 dex
Taking into account this dispersion and lack of clear evolu-
tion we believe it is educational to adopt the assumption that the
SMF is indeed constant with redshift by dening an Average
Mass Function AMF as the average value among the curves
shown in Fig 3 unweighted average of logM after con-
verting each work to the Kroupa et al 2001 IMF This AMF
is shown in the gure as the thick curve Note that many other
determinations of the SMF exist and we limited ourselves to
a few representative cases Especially Bell et al 2003 is often
used as a local reference and the SMF by Borch et al 2006
were measured following the same methods at higher redshifts
Ilbert et al 2009 and Arnouts et al 2007 propose two slightly
dierent approaches in identical redshift bins and procure a
good example of the dispersion that can be found in the data
due to eg cosmic variance or dierences in the adopted meth-
ods Note that Hopkins et al 2009 also choosed these two last
studies for their analysis for the same reasons Inspection of Fig
3 thus shows that the AMF at each stellar mass has a typical
uncertainty of 02 dex
As stellar mass is obviously evolving in star forming galax-
ies the fact that the SMF is roughly constant for 0  z  1 is
actually hiding a real evolution To get rid from this diculty
we compute a model Velocity Function where the velocity is ac-

short-dashed curves and Borch et al 2006 as long-dashed
curves between redshifts 0 and 1 The resulting Average Mass
Function AMF is shown as the bold solid curve
tually the parameter of the simple model presented in section 2
and thus does not evolve The Velocity Function is computed as
V 
 AMFM 
In this equation AMFM is the Average Mass Function dened
above and the factor dMdV is obtained for each redshift by
numerically deriving the velocity- stellar mass relationships of
the models shown in Fig 4 for each redshift there is a one-to-
one correspondence between the stellar mass and the velocity
By denition at redshift 0 the circular velocity can be iden-
tied with the observed rotational velocity We thus compare in
Fig 5 the Velocity Function obtained for redshift 0 with the ro-
tational velocity functions for spirals observationally derived by
Gonzalez et al 2000 They obtained their functions by combin-
ing various empirical luminosity functions and tully-sher re-
lationships available at that time Taking into account the scat-
ter they obtained for dierent inputs about 04 dex at V220
kms and the scatter around the AMF dierent studies and dif-
ferent redshifts cover a range of 05 dex  the agreement be-
tween our redshift 0 model Velocity Function and the ones in
Gonzalez et al 2000 is reasonable We also show the Velocity
Functions obtained if we replace the AMF by the redshift 0 ob-
served Stellar Mass Functions from Bell et al 2003 giving an
idea of the uncertainty the scatter in Fig 3 is larger than the
dierence obtained using the AMF or Bell et al functions

4 Cosmic evolutions
41 EvolutionofthevelocityandSFRfunctions
In the previous section we derived from the combination of ob-
servations a constant stellar mass function the AMF and the
stellar mass-velocity relationship of simple models the veloc-
ity function at various redshifts From this distribution at each
redshift many quantities and their distribution can be computed
using the models Fig 6 shows the evolution of the model veloc-
ity function in the top left panel The SFR function evolution
is shown in the top right panel and the bottom panels shows
the evolution of the contribution to the cosmic SFR density by
galaxies of various stellar mass left and SFR right These pan-
els illustrate that at higher redshift the cosmic SFR density is
dominated by galaxies of larger SFR in our models It is also
dominated by galaxies of larger stellar masses at larger redshift
although the eect is smaller The peak of the contribution to
the cosmic SFR density moves from logMM  106 red-
shift 175 to logMM  103 redshift 0 In the following
we study some interesting details of the evolution summarized
in this gure
These results and those in the remaining of the paper
have been obtained assuming that the Stellar Mass Function
of star forming galaxies is constant with time while their
Velocity Function changes Before studying in details the con-
sequences of our assumption we rst try to see wether the
opposite assumption is acceptable We thus assume that the
Velocity Function is constant we adopt the velocity function
found at redshift 0 above and shown in Fig 5 and compute
the evolution of the Stellar Mass Function then implied by the
model stellar mass-velocity relationship The results for red-
shift lower than 1 are shown in Fig 7 together with the area
occupied by the Star Forming Galaxies Stellar Mass functions

shift For logMM  105  11 the decrease with respect to
the redshift 0 value reaches 04 dex at redshift  1 This num-
ber is not very far from the dispersion found among the obser-
vational studies However this dispersion is largely due to sys-
tematic dierences between the various studies Whithin the in-
dividual studies of Ilbert et al 2009 Arnouts et al 2007 and
Borch et al 2006 Fig 7 shows that the evolution of the SMF
is smaller than  02 dex a much lower value than the change
we expect under the assumption of a constant Velocity Function
We thus conclude that the evolution of the star-forming galaxies
Velocity Function is clearly established
42 Build-upofthequiescentstellarmassfunction
The model velocity function for star-forming galaxies shown in
Fig 6 evolves with redshift with a larger number of star form-
ing galaxies at higher redshift for any given velocity It is another
way to say that at a given velocity a fraction of galaxies have
quenched their star formation between the redshift probed and
now We computed the velocity function with a z02 step in
redshift The dierence between functions at dierent steps is
the velocity function of galaxies that have quenched their star
formation rate in this redshift interval and is shown in the top
panel of Fig 8 normalised to be expressed as a ux Combining
it with the stellar Mass-Velocity relation at the beginning of
each redshift interval assuming the quenching is instantaneous
at the beginning of the bin since the stellar mass evolves little
in such small redshift interval we can compute the Quenched
stellar Mass Function in each interval bottom panel This func-
tion is normalized by the time elapsed within each redshift bin
so that it is actually a number density ux from star forming
galaxies to quiescent ones These numbers can be compared to
eg Pozzetti et al 2009 who found a red sequence growth rate
S Boissier et al Stellar Mass and Velocity Functions of Galaxies Backward evolution  the fate of Milky Way siblings
Fig 8 Velocity top and stellar Mass Functions bottom of
galaxies that Quenched their star formation within redshift
bins of z 02 as predicted in our model The functions are
normalised by the time elapsed within the corresponding red-
shift bins so that they correspond to number density uxes
of a few 104 gal Mpc3 Gyr1 dex1 for logMM  11 in
the redshift range 03 to 09 With the quenched ux estimated
above it is easy to compute the cumulated Quenched stellar
Mass Function between two redshifts This is done in Fig 9 be-
tween redshift 11 beyond this point the models start to be unre-
liable see section 2 and several redshifts for which we compare
the results of our model to the increase in the quiescent stel-
lar mass function of Ilbert et al 2009 and Arnouts et al 2007
Considering the uncertainties in the derivation of stellar mass
functions especially at high redshift see in the gure the dif-
ference between the two observational studies the agreement is
good above  3 1010 M ie the increase in the observed stellar
mass function of quiescent galaxies is well compatible with the
number of star forming galaxies that must quench their star for-
mation in order to obtain their about constant stellar mass func-
tion within a few tens of dex ie our uncertainties see also Bell
et al 2007 for a simple approach and Pozzetti et al 2009 Below
and around 1010 M the model predicts a much larger number of
quenched galaxies and a steeper slope than the dierential evo-
lution obtained in the observational studies This results directly
from the assumption that the SMF of star forming galaxies does
not evolve even at low stellar mass where it is not observed at
high redshift in this regime the model is a mere extrapolation
To obtain less quiescent galaxies with stellar masses in the range
109 - 1010 M we would need a change in the number of low-
mass star forming galaxies with redshift Only future observa-
tions bringing constraints on the low-mass end of the stellar mass
function of star forming galaxies at intermediate redshift will al-
low us to check if it is the case Pozzetti et al 2009 computed
the number evolution of quiescent galaxies in three stellar mass
ranges between redshifts  025 and 09 In Fig 10 we show
their data and compare them to the predictions of our model
solid curves integrating the cumulative quenched stellar mass
Fig 9 The cumulated quenched stellar mass function since
z11 in our simple model is compared to the increase of
the observed stellar mass function of quiescent galaxies in
Ilbert et al 2009 and Arnouts et al 2007 The comparison is
meaningful only out of the shaded area on the side indicated by
the arrow the limit corresponds to logM96 the lower stel-
lar mass used in Ilbert et al 2009 at redshift 11 that we use as
reference
function such as the ones shown in Fig 9 in the same stellar mass
bins We also show our computations of the same numbers us-
ing the observed stellar Mass Functions of Arnouts et al 2007
and Ilbert et al 2009 allowing to estimate the uncertainty on
these numbers by comparing the various studies When consid-
ering the top panels one has to take into consideration the fact
that a number of quiescent galaxies are formed beyond red-
shift 11 while the model only shows the one formed by quench-
ing after this epoch For this reason the two thin lines show the
sum of the newly quenched galaxies model and of the quies-
cent galaxies already existing at redshift 11 taking the data of
Ilbert et al 2009 or Arnouts et al 2007 We also show in the
bottom panels the relative number evolution with respect to z 
09 On the massive galaxies side the quenching forms a small
number of quiescent galaxies with respect to the number already
present at z09 massive galaxies are already in place at this
redshift The model predict a small increase of the number den-
sity in this stellar mass range consistent with the estimations of a
quasi constant number-density Moving to the intermediate stel-
lar mass bin 1010511 M we predict a larger increase in the
number of quenched galaxies consistent with the data We note
however a large dispersion the model tend to underpredict the
evolution with respect to Pozzetti et al 2009 but overpredict it
S Boissier et al Stellar Mass and Velocity Functions of Galaxies Backward evolution  the fate of Milky Way siblings
with respect to Ilbert et al 2009 or Arnouts et al 2007 In the
lower mass bin the model is roughly consistent with the vari-
ous studies when no normalisation is done top panel of g 10
In the bottom panel two of the observational works are found
below the model curve but this is mostly due to the z09 point
The gure suggests that most of the low-mass quiescent galaxies
are formed between redshifts 11 and 0 through quenching of the
star formation of star-forming galaxies
43 Ontheroleofmergers
Fig 9 shows that the star formation quenching inferred from the
model reproduces relatively well the observed increase on the
massive side of the SMF for quiescent galaxies even if uncer-
tainties due to poor statistics are large It overpredicts the qui-
escent SMF on the low mass-side even if at the lowest stellar
masses the models are extrapolations the slope seems larger
than the one observationaly found How would those results be
aected if in addition to the quenching itself the mass is re-
distributed through mergers  A complete answer would need
a full treatment of the Halo Occupation Distribution and is be-
yond the scope of this paper However we attempt to illustrate
what could happen in two simple cases shown in Fig 11 We thus
start from the modeled Stellar Mass Function of quenched galax-
ies between redshifts 11 and 03 within the mass range 108 to
1012 M We then assume two merging scenarios redistribut-
ing the mass in dierent ways - Case 1 Each quenched galaxy
merge with another one the mass of each merging galaxy be-
ing taken randomly from the initial distribution with lower mass
limit 108M mergers - random mass curve in Fig 11 resulting
in an average mass ratio of 014 for a nal 1011 M galaxy - Case
2 Each galaxy suers one major merger in the redshift interval
computed by assuming that each galaxy merge with a galaxy of
identical mass same mass curve Jogee et al 2009 estimated
that 68  of galaxies with stellar masses larger than 25 1010
M have undergone a merger of mass ratio larger than 110 over
lookback times of 3 to 7 Gyrs Including stellar masses as low
as 109 M they found that 84  of galaxies have undergone one
merger Thus Case 1 may not be very far from the truth Case 2
is highly biased in favor of major mergers given the results from
various studies For instance Jogee et al 2009 found that 16 
of galaxies have undergone a major merger over lookback times
3-7 Gyrs Based on galaxy pairs de Ravel et al 2009 found
that 22  of galaxies have undergone a major merger since z 
09 Lopez-Sanjuan et al2009 found that 8  of galaxies more
massive than 1010M have undergone a merger since z  1
Case 1 shows that a small number of minor mergers have al-
most no eect on the stellar mass function Making eg  ten
minor mergers an extreme case rather than 1 would have an
impact on the results however they would depend on the lower
mass limit adopted for the computation while the SMF is in-
creasingly uncertain towards low masses
Case 2 shows what happens if each galaxy goes through
one major merger In this case the shape of the quenched stel-
lar Mass Function is modestly changed at low and intermedi-
ate mass where the number of galaxy at a given stellar mass is
slightly reduced Only the high-mass end of the distribution is
signicantly changed In particular major mergers seems to be
the only way to build the more massive quiescent galaxies
As seen earlier the slope found in the intermediatelow mass
range of the diagram is quite steep in the model with respect to
the observations of Ilbert et al 2009 or Arnouts et al 2007
Fig 11 shows that simple merger models do not help to solve
the problem

One assumption that has been implicitly done is that mergers
do not enhance star formation If it was not the case a fraction of
star forming galaxies woud have larger SFR than deduced from
the models and the result of the fusion would have a larger stel-
lar mass than the one described in the basic approach of this sec-
tion However Robaina et al 2009 showed recently that the ad-
ditional SFR due to mergers is very modest and then even more
signicant for the additional stellar mass de Ravel et al 2009
found a net star formation enhancement in merging pairs of
only 25  This modest enhancement is also consistent with the
merger simulations of Di Matteo et al 2007 Note that in fact
we do not exclude at this level the possibility of mergers being
related to the quenching itself The merging of two star forming
galaxies of similar mass may result in the quenching of their star
formation for instance through AGN formation and feedback
eg Sanders et al 1988 Springel et al 2005 This case would
be exactly similar in our approach to two star-forming galaxies
quenching their star formation and having their masses added
together to form a new galaxy Case 2 above
In summary in this section we only discussed about the
shape of the mass distribution of quiescent galaxies and the pos-
sible impact of mergers on it Our conclusion is that the stellar
Mass Function of galaxies quenched at redshift lower than 11
originates from the shape of the SMF of star forming galaxies
Mergers only bring modest adjustment to the quenched stellar
Mass Function by re-distributing part of the mass They proba-
bly may play an important role at most at the high-mass end of
the Mass Function

44 CosmicSFRdensity
In the last decade many studies have put constraints on
the cosmic SFR density history A compilation can be
found in Hopkins  Beacom 2006 In a more recent work
Wilkins et al 2008 derived the cosmic SFR density history
from a compilation of measurements of the cosmic stellar den-
sity at various redshifts These two approaches give close results
in the redshift range in which we are interested the latter one
producing a smaller drop in the cosmic SFR density between
redshift 1 and 0 a factor of about 6 versus 10 We decided
to use as a reference the results of Wilkins et al 2008 for two
main reasons rst it is based on measurements of mass densities
more consistent with our starting points of stellar mass functions
than SFR measurements Second any evolution that we need to
impose in our model to reproduce this trend is likely to be a
lower limit on the actual evolution
In Fig 12 we reproduce the evolution provided by
Wilkins et al 2008 with their 1 and 3  dispersion determina-
tion as the solid curve and shaded areas We overplot the cos-
mic history of the SFR density obtained with the model ve-
locity function derived at various redshift as explained before
in combination with the velocity-SFR relation from the models
triangles Concentrating on the redshifts lower than 1 where
we are condent in the models we note that the points are
within the shaded area determining the compilation of data from
Wilkins et al 2008 even if the drop in SFR is not as large as
usually considered factor of  3 rather than 6 since redshift 1
This is mostly due to the fact that our AMF produces a rela-
tively large cosmic SFR density at redshift 0 We also present in
the gure the cosmic SFR density if the observed Stellar Mass
Function of Bell et al 2003 derived at redshift zero is used
rather than the AMF dots Very similar results are found es-
pecially the fact that our redshift 0 point is relatively high This
indicates a small inconsistency between the SMF of local star
forming galaxies the SFR-Stellar mass relationship and the cos-
mic SFR density measurements the basic observables used to
compute the redshift 0 point
In this gure we also attempt to relax the assumption of
a constant stellar mass function and we use for each red-
shift shown the mass functions derived for this redshift by
Ilbert et al 2009 open circles and Arnouts et al 2007 open

tically shaded area z  11 the results from the models are
mere extrapolations showing the limits of our approach beyond
this redshift
squares in place of the AMF The general trend is similar to the
one obtained with the AMF but introducing deviations around it
These deviations correspond to the scatter in the observed stel-
lar mass functions The approach consisting in using the AMF
allows us to focus on general trends and lters out the peculiar-
ities of individual studies eg the eects of cosmic variance
The points at redshift larger than 1 can be considered as ex-
trapolations in which we have little condence since the mod-
els are less and less reliable when moving at larger redshifts
The points show that our basic assumptions overpredict the cos-
mic SFR density at redshift 175 by a few tens of dex Since
the models underpredict the individual SFR in galaxies towards
these redshifts but the cosmic SFR density is over-predicted this
means that our other assumption the consistency of the SMF
cannot be applied at these redshifts Indeed the points computed
with the SMF of Ilbert et al 2009 and Arnouts et al 2007 are
in better agreement with the Wilkins et al 2008 data
A good way to understand the cosmic SFR density evo-
lution is to look in Fig 13 at
the star forming galaxies
SFR functions at each redshift for which they were observa-
tionally derived in Bell et al 2007 Le Floch et al 2005
and Rodighiero et al 2009 The infra-red luminosity functions
from the two last papers were converted into SFR functions as-
suming logS FR  logLL  997 Buat et al 08 Note
that other references are available in the infrared but we show
Rodighiero et al 2009 and Le Floch et al 2005 for conve-
nience as they are given for the same redshift bins of interest
for us The latter study found a slightly smaller number of very

minosity functions observed by Le Floch et al 2005 and

logS FR  logLL  997 Buat et al 08
luminous galaxies than the former as did Magnelli et al 2009
For redshifts above 03 the modeled SFR functions are consis-
tent with the data especially for intermediate star formation rates
a few to a few tens M yr1 dominating the cosmic SFR density
see Fig 6 The shape of the function is not evolving much but
is shifted towards higher SFR when moving to larger redshifts
both in the observations and the models as normal disk galax-
ies had larger amount of gas and SFR in the past The models
distribution has a sharper drop at high SFR than the observa-
tions especially at high redshift what may indicate that we
are missing a small number of galaxies with enhanced activity
with respect to the models This is also the case when compar-
ing our models to Ilbert et al 2009 or Pozzetti et al 2009 We
do not reproduce the active fraction of galaxies observed by
these studies However because of the shape of the SFR func-
tion such galaxies cannot dominate the cosmic SFR density  al-
though they may contribute slightly to its evolution To estimate
this contribution we use the Le Floch et al 2005 data to com-
pute the fraction of the cosmic SFR density coming from galax-
ies with SFR higher than 10 Myr1 and that are not predicted
by the models ie computing the dierence between the model
and observed contributions to the cosmic SFR density above this
SFR with respect to the total one This fraction is equal to 13
19 23 31 and 38  at redshift 0375 05 07 09 and 11
This discrepancy was found in other simple models eg Daddi
S Boissier et al Stellar Mass and Velocity Functions of Galaxies Backward evolution  the fate of Milky Way siblings
et al 2007 Dave et al 2008 Part of the dierence could be
due to an enhancement of star formation during interactions that
are not included in our approach Actually the recent studies of
Robaina et al 2009 and Jogee et al 2009 suggest that major
interactions trigger extra star formation They contribute to less
than 10  to the cosmic SFR density but are responsible for
some of the galaxies with the largest SFR as revealed by their
infra-red luminosity This results is also recovered by the empir-
ical models of Hopkins et al 2009 Even so our approach is
still meaningful since these galaxies do not represent the bulk of
the contribution to the cosmic SFR density
We have seen above that the model is on the upper side of
the cosmic SFR density at low redshift thus predicting an evo-
lution with redshift on the weaker side of the one allowed by
the data It is interesting to note that the modeled SFR functions
at low redshift z 03 panels in Fig 13 also overestimate the
number of galaxies with intermediate SFR around a few Myr1
dominating the cosmic SFR density at this redshift by up to 06
dex almost a factor 4 This dierence explains the excess in the
cosmic SFR density obtained at low redshift in the models The
Stellar Mass-SFR relationship is relatively easy to construct and
dierent data sets provide very similar results for this amount
of star formation top left panel of Fig 2 the average values
are well within 02 dex of each other The only other way to
overestimate the cosmic SFR density and the SFR function in
our approach is to over-estimate the Stellar Mass Function The
AMF that we adopted is however very close to the one measured
by Bell et al 2003 at redshift 0 The most simple solution to
this conundrum would be to consider that the local stellar Mass
Function reported in Bell et al 2003 for star forming galaxies
overestimates the number of galaxies with intermediate stellar
mass a few 1010Myr1 by a factor 2 to 4 and thus that the
SMF in fact does evolve slightly at the lowest redshifts note
that reducing the SMF for all redshifts would lead us to underes-
timate the cosmic SFR density at redshift  05 thus we do need
an evolution We note that the total observed stellar mass func-
tion of Bell et al 2003 is in good agreement with many other
works and is very probably ne However there is an intrinsic
diculty in splitting galaxies in star forming and quiescent ones
see the dispersion at larger redshift between the various stud-
ies using various criteria for doing such a thing Local studies
are also very dierent in nature than higher redshift ones lo-
cal volume versus deep eld In summary a small evolution of
the SMF of star-forming galaxies at the lowest redshift could
improve the agreement with SFR functions and the drop in the
cosmic SFR density Such an evolution is not visible in current
data what may be due to the combined eect of dispersion and
of the intrinsic dierences in local studies versus high redshift
ones in terms of surveys and separation of the various types of
galaxies

Fig 14 shows the number evolution of star forming galaxies
of a given velocity This is dierent from number evolution of
galaxies of a given stellar mass what is more often shown
because the mass of a star forming galaxies evolves with time
eg Noeske 2009 In our approach the velocity is attached
to a galaxy We show it for massive galaxies V360 kms top
panel and for intermediate mass galaxies similar to the Milky
Way V220 kms bottom panel This gure shows clearly that
the number of galaxies with a given velocity has declined since
redshift 1 The V  220 kms galaxies have declined by a fac-
tor about 2 since redshift 1 Thus statistically half of the Milky

V220 kms bottom and more massive galaxies V360 kms
top with redshift Symbols are the same as in Fig 12
Way siblings at redshift 1 have disappeared since then  The frac-
tion of more massive galaxies having survived is even lower
Note that given the discussion above these numbers are prob-
ably lower limits if as suggested by the SFR function the SMF
does evolve and especially is lower by a factor 2-4 at redshift
zero the evolution given above should be multiplied by a simi-
lar quantity
Beyond redshift  1 once again our results are extrapola-
tions that should be treated with caution Especially the trend
obtained with a constant stellar Mass Function for star forming
galaxies and the one adopting observed functions start to dier
this is similar to what is found with the cosmic SFR density in
the previous section The number of galaxies with V  220kms
is found to decline with increasing redshifts when we use the
stellar Mass Functions from Ilbert et al 2009 and atten with
Arnouts et al 2007 indicating that we may reach another era
when the stellar Mass Function of star forming galaxies is not
constant with time as this population is building up
What are the processes and loci of the transformation of
half of the Milky Way sisters between redshift 1 and 0 
Many suggestions can be found in the literature For instance
Pozzetti et al 2009 propose that the transformation could be
driven by several processes aging of the stellar population
exhaustion of the gas reservoir gas stripping AGN feed-
back truncation of gas accretion via infall or satellites star-
vation or strangulation but they do not clearly identify it
Bolzonella et al 2009 nd some clues that the transformation
is accelerated in over-dense regions However the environment is
only roughly dened 5th neighbor They propose viable mech-
anism as merging processes triggering AGNs but see discus-
sion on mergers below and propose nally strangulation halo-
gas stripping due to gravitational interaction with eg groups
haloes On the other hand Cowie  Barger 2008 found an ef-
fect of environment traced by the projected nearest neighbor
only in massive galaxies above 1011 M while we denitively
S Boissier et al Stellar Mass and Velocity Functions of Galaxies Backward evolution  the fate of Milky Way siblings
need an eect below Martig et al 2009 proposed the process
of Morphological Quenching of the star formation occurring
when disks become dominated by a stellar spheroid stabilizing
the disk against star formation In this scenario the spheroid can
be built via major minor merger or disk instabilities Although
an interesting process this does not allow by itself to easily pre-
dict which fraction of disks are going to turn red and dead
Whatever process is responsible for quenching star for-
mation it cannot have happened only in clusters of galax-
ies that encompass a much smaller fraction of galaxies than
the one we need to quench point also noted in Bolzonella
et al 2009 Based on merger models Koda et al 2009 sug-
gest that 70  of galaxies with halo mass in the range 5
 1010 - 1012 M have not suered a merger with mass ra-
tio larger than 005 since redshift 1 This point is also con-
sistent with the results of Oesch et al 2009 indicating that
mergers cannot drive the morphological transformation at red-
shift less than unity Observationally Robaina et al 2009 and
Jogee et al 2009 found relatively low rates of major merg-
ers Thus major mergers cannot explain the number decrease of
Milky Way galaxies 50 or more massive galaxies
In conclusion this major event in the history of a downsiz-
ing universe consisting in the halt of star formation in previ-
ously star forming galaxies then becoming quiescent galaxies
must be a common phenomenom occurring on an intermediate
scale not specically related to clusters or major mergers May
be we should look at the scales of groups to nd the culprit see
also Tran et al 2009 and references within Several elements
reinforce us in adopting groups as prime suspects rstly the
fact that the number of galaxies in groups 55 in Eke et al
2004 is large enough to be consistent with the large fraction
of galaxies that must quench their star formation More-over
Star Formation is suppressed on the scales of groups accord-
ing to Lewis et al 2002 who found that the SFR depends on
local density regardless of the richness of groups or clusters
Kilborn et al 2009 recently studied HI in groups and conclude
that transformation is taking place in groups in which galaxies
loose gas through tidal stripping during galaxy-galaxy or galaxy-
group interaction Tanaka et al 2007 2009 also suggest that
galaxy-galaxy interactions in groups play a major role in the
built-up of the red sequence on the basis of a detailed spectro-
scopic analysis of galaxies endebbed in laments around two
clusters at redshift 055 and 124 Finally Gavazzi et al work
in preparation found that the red sequence is already formed in
groups as it is in clusters but not among isolated galaxies
5 Conclusions
This paper presents an original and educational approach to
work with Stellar Mass Function of star forming galaxies
The main point consists in combining observed Stellar Mass
Functions with simple backward evolutionary models assum-
ing a smooth evolution driven by star formation in a galactic
disk fuelled by cold accretion to obtain modeled velocity func-
tions at various redshifts The big advantage of the velocity is
that it is a model parameter attached to a galaxy contrary to stel-
lar mass which evolves with star formation In the framework of
such models for a given velocity the Star Formation History and
the Stellar Mass history are known Galaxies with large veloci-
ties are the precursor of todays massive star forming galaxies in
the absence of quenching with stars having formed at an early
epoch Galaxies with low velocities have been formed on aver-
age at later times These histories are not adhoc models for this
paper but have been shown to be consistent with a large num-
ber of properties of nearby star-forming galaxies Combining the
Velocity Functions and the models it is possible to compute the
model predictions for a large number of quantities and distribu-
tions at any redshift eg SFR functions and cosmic SFR den-
At the current time the empirical stellar mass functions are
still rather uncertain see the scatter between various studies
Assuming that to the rst order the stellar mass function is con-
stant for star forming galaxies at redshift lower than 1 in accor-
dance with the data we obtained several interesting results
1 A globally consistent picture is obtained in which a large
fraction of star forming galaxies quench their activity of star
formation between redshift 0 and 1 building up the red se-
quence The shape of the quiescent galaxies stellar mass
function is recovered above  3 1010 M Mergers can only
alter it slightly by redistributing the mass among galaxies
At most their main eect could be seen only on the massive
end of the stellar Mass Function
2 The evolution of the cosmic SFR density falls within the
compilation of Wilkins et al 2008 However our decrease
towards low redshifts is smaller than in the observations The
discrepency is especially due to our redshift 0 point This
may be related to a small inconsistency between the stellar
mass function SFR function and stellar mass-SFR relation-
ship of the local universe star forming galaxies
3 The fraction of galaxies having quenched their star formation
is high in rough agreement with measurements For exam-
ple we conclude that half of the Milky Way siblings galax-
ies with circular velocities of 220 kms have quenched their
star formation since redshift 1 and are then no more star-
forming disk such as the Galaxy This fraction is probably a
lower limit since the model cosmic SFR density presents it-
self a relatively weak evolution with respect to the observed
4 The process responsible for this change is not clearly identi-
ed today What is clear is that it is probably not related to
cluster physics or to major mergers which aect galaxies in
too small numbers Groups are our prime suspects because
they are numerous enough to have a signicant eect on the
cosmic evolutions and several studies indicate that transfor-
mations are indeed taking place in them
In the future we hope that wider deeper elds and improve-
ment in the analysis of stellar mass functions will allow us to use
the method exposed in this paper but on safer grounds This will
allow us to improve our models of galaxy evolution and to get
a more complete picture of the cosmic evolution of star-forming
galaxies and their transformation into quiescent ones
