Abstract
We use K -band 21 m imaging to investigate the angular size and morphology of 10 6C radio
galaxies at redshifts 1  z  14 Two appear to be undergoing mergers another contains two intensity
peaks aligned with the radio jets while the other seven appear consistent with being normal ellipticals
in the K-band
Intrinsic half-light radii are estimated from the areas of each radio galaxy image above a series of
thresholds The 6C galaxy radii are found to be signicantly smaller than those of the more radioluminous
3CR galaxies at similar redshifts This would indicate that the higher mean K-band luminosity of the
3CR galaxies results from a dierence in the size of the host galaxies and not solely from a dierence in
the power of the active nuclei
The size-luminosity relation of the z  11 6C galaxies indicates a 1018 mag enhancement of the
rest-frame R-band surface brightness relative to either local ellipticals of the same size or FRII radio
galaxies at z  02 The 3CR galaxies at z  11 show a comparable enhancement in surface brightness
The mean radius of the 6C galaxies suggests that they evolve into ellipticals of L  L luminosity and is
consistent with their low redshift counterparts being relatively small FRII galaxies a factor  25 lower
in radio luminosity or small FRI galaxies a factor of  1000 lower in radio luminosity Hence the 6C
radio galaxies may undergo at least as much optical and radio evolution as the 3CR galaxies
1 Introduction
Powerful radio galaxies at z  05 appear similar in morphology and prole to normal giant ellipticals
Lilly MacLean and Longair 1983 with luminosities in the range from L to  2 mag above L and
no obvious correlation between radio and optical luminosity Laing Riley and Longair 1983 Owen and
Laing 1989 Owen and White 1991 The relative uniformity of the optical properties of radio galaxies
combined with the ease of detection at higher redshifts means that they provide a useful probe of galaxy
evolution Lilly and Longair 1984 measured K-band 22m magnitudes for 3CR radio galaxies over
a very wide range of redshifts the 3CR catalog is a ux limited sample containing the radio galaxies
with apparent ux exceeding 10 Jy at 178 MHz The Kz relation of these galaxies which showed little
scatter out to z  2 indicated an evolutionary brightening with redshift consistent with a high formation
redshift z  5 followed by passive stellar evolution
The radio luminosities of the most powerful radio galaxies also evolve Laing Riley and Longair
1983 using a V Vmax test showed that their decrease in luminosity with time was comparable to the
evolution of quasars Padovani and Urry 1992 studied the radio evolution of the 3CR catalog in more
detail deriving a radio luminosity function and obtaining a best t for an exponential Lrad evolution
with timescale   017003
04 Gyr It must be noted that this exponential decrease
describes the evolution of the radio luminosity function rather than that of individual radio galaxies The
galaxies might for example undergo short bursts of radio emission separated by much longer periods of
radio quiescence with subsequent bursts decreasing with time in their peak radio intensity
ie   3306
002H 1
Higher redshift radio galaxies dier in appearence from normal ellipticals especially at shorter wave-
lengths Rigler et al 1992 studied 13 3CR galaxies at 08  z  13 and found that they could be
decomposed into active and passive components The active components were elongated blue ap-
proximately f   0 and aligned with the radio axis Best et al 1996 using WFPC2 imaging found
that in radio galaxies with a relatively small separation between the radio lobes the blue components
consisted of strings of several bright knots whereas in radio galaxies with radio lobes separated by more
than  200 kpc the blue components were much more compact This suggested an evolutionary sequence
in which the elongated optical components were formed as the outward passage of the radio jets triggers
large-scale star-formation and later fall back towards the galaxy centres However the aligned compo-
nents of at least some z  1 radio galaxies show some polarization Tadhunter et al 1992 Leyshon and
Eales 1997 suggesting that dust-reected light from the active nucleus is also important
The aligned components are less prominent at longer wavelengths typically contributing only  10
of the total ux at rest  1m ie the observed K-band but many of the z  1 3CR galaxies still show
some alignment between their radio axes and K-band isophotes Dunlop and Peacock 1993 Ridgway and
Stockton 1997 Most of the red light is produced by the passive components which are redder diuse
and symmetric apparently unaligned with the radio axis and appear to be underlying giant ellipticals
In the infra-red H-band 165m Rigler and Lilly 1994 found the prole of the z  118 radio
galaxy 3C65 to be well-tted with a pure bulge r
4  prole of eective radius re  177  018 arcsec
Best et al
1997 observing in the K-band and with the HST WFPC2 conrmed re  17 arcsec
for 3C65 and found all 21 of a sample of z  1 3CR galaxies to be well-tted by bulge models with
07  re  39 arcsec The size-luminosity relation of these galaxies was consistent with that of of local
ellipticals with the  1m of brightening expected from passive evolution Only two of the 21 galaxies
contained substantial  10 of total ux nuclear point-sources components although several showed
some evidence of an excess of surface brightness above a bulge-model prole at large radii r  35 kpc
like that in cD galaxies which might be evidence for a rich cluster environment
In this paper we investigate the K-band morphology and radii of 10 galaxies at similar redshifts but
with more moderate radio luminosities selected from the 6C survey which has a ux limit about six times
fainter than 3CR There are some unsolved problems concerning the dierences between the 3CR and 6C
galaxies Firstly 6C radio galaxies at 06  z  18 were found to be on average 07 mag less luminous
in the observed K-band than 3CR galaxies at the same redshifts Eales and Rawlings 1996 Eales et al
1997 but it was unclear whether this was due solely to a greater near-IR ux from the 3CR nuclei or
to a greater mass of stars in the 3CR galaxies We shall investigate whether the dierences in the radio
and optical luminosities of 3CR and 6C galaxies at z  1 are related to any dierences in the old stellar
component visible in the K-band Secondly as the 3CR and 6C galaxies at lower redshifts are similar
in mean K-band luminosity the Kz relations of the 3CR and 6C catalogs are dierent in slope with
the latter consistent with no evolution Hence if high redshift 6C galaxies evolve into the low redshift 6C
galaxies they undergo surprisingly little change in K-band luminosity but it is also possible that their
low redshift counterparts are galaxies of lower K and radio luminosity By determining a size-luminosity
relation for the 6C galaxies and comparing with both z  1 3CR galaxies and low-redshift radio galaxies
from Owen and Laing 1989 we may compare the surface brightness evolution of the two catalogs and
determine whether the 6C galaxies are truly non-evolving
We assume H0  50 km s1Mpc1 and q0  005 throughout Section 2 describes the observational
data Section 3 its analysis and photometry
In Section 4 we describe the estimation of the size and
morphological type of the galaxies and in Section 5 discuss the appearence of each individual 6C galaxy
In Section 6 we present the size-luminosity relation and compare with 3CR galaxies at similar redshifts
and local radio galaxies and in Section 7 discuss the implications for radio galaxy evolution Section 8
summarizes the main conclusions
2 Observational Data
The observational dataset of this paper consists of 10 images each centred on a 6C radio galaxy with
a known spectroscopic redshift in the 10  z  14 range zmean  111 This data was previously used
by Eales et al 1997 in a study of the K-band luminosity evolution of radio galaxies The 6C galaxies
considered here have 151 MHz uxes of 2244 Jy corresponding at these redshifts to L151MHz  10286
W Hz1 Allington-Smith 1982 and Eales 1985 give more information on the radio source properties
Eales et al 1997 and references therein detail the identication of the optical counterparts and Rawlings
et al 1997 describe the spectroscopic observations For comparison we include in our dataset an image
of a radio-loud QSO 5C68 which lies in the same redshift range as the other objects Table 1 lists the
radio galaxy co-ordinates and redshifts for all 11 images
These elds were observed over the period 1820 January 1995 using the Redeye camera on the
Canada-France Hawaii Telescope CFHT Redeye is a 256  256 HgCaTe mosaic with a pixelsize of 050
arcsec covering approximately 2  2 arcmin Each eld was imaged nine times with the camera being
oset by 8 arcsec between exposures in a 33 grid The total exposure times varied from 26 to 47 minutes
per eld The observations were made in the the K  band centred on a wavelength of 21m where there
is some reduction of sky background compared to that in the standard 22 m K-band Wainscoat and
Cowie 1992 All 11 images had good seeing estimated as F W HM  0912 arcsec
3 Data Analysis and Galaxy Detection
After initial image processing using the IRAF package see Eales et al 1997 the Starlink PISA
Position Intensity and Shape Analysis package developed by M Irwin P Draper and N Eaton was
used to detect and catalog the objects on each eld Object were detected on the basis that they exceed
an intensity threshold of 15 above the background noise  being separately determined by PISA for
each of the frames in at least 6 connected pixels Fluxes were estimated using the total magnitudes
option within PISA which counts photons above the sky background level in elliptical apertures about
the centroid of each detection with the aperture size and shape being tted by a curve-of-growth analysis
to the intensity prole of each object
Observations of K-band standard stars provided a photometric zero-point for the Redeye data of
K  2128 for 1 count sec1 However due to the oset between the K and K  passbands this zero point
will be exact only for objects with the same K   K as the standard stars Radio galaxies with elliptical-
like colours will at 1  z  14 be redder than the calibration stars by an estimated K   K  013
mag see Eales et al 1997 so to correct for this we add K  013 mag to the magnitudes adopting
a zero-point of K  2115 for 1 count sec1
PISA also produces a list of 8 areas for each detected object The rst area is simply the number of
pixels where the intensity equals or exceeds the chosen detection threshold while sizes 28 are the areas
above higher thresholds of Ithr  2j2 counts where Ithr is the threshold and j an integer from 2 to 8
For these images Ithr  50 counts so the 8th threshold would be  1074 counts and  75 mag above
the detection threshold
We are only concerned here with the radio galaxies on each image the properties eg clustering of
the other galaxies detected will be discussed in a separate paper Figures 1 and 2 show greyscale images
and contour plots of 15  15 arcsec areas centred on each radio galaxy Table 1 lists the K-band total
magnitudes of the radio galaxies as measured from this data with errors estimated from the best-tting
models described in Section 4 below These are consistent with the magnitudes of Eales et al 1997
Table 1 also lists the detection thresholds of the 11 images in terms of K mag arcsec2 Two of the
radio galaxies were detected by PISA as double objects on these images 6C01136 with components of
apparent separations 17 arcsec and 6C125636 with components of separation 25 arcsec These pairs are
still connected at the detection threshold so are only split when PISA is run with the deblend option In
this analysis we have used PISA without deblending so these radiogalaxies are classed as single objects
and the derived magnitudes and areas will be those of both components together
4 Estimating Galaxy Sizes and Proles
41 Method
Most of the radio galaxies appear extended on these images To estimate their intrinsic angular sizes
and distinguish between disk and bulge proles we compare their areas above 8 thresholds as given by
PISA with those measured for simulated galaxy proles We consider three types of source prole
i A point source
ii An exponential disk with surface brightness   exprrexp We consider exponential scale-
lengths in the range 007  rexp  100 arcsec The half-light radius rhl  168rexp
iii A bulge elliptical galaxy prole with surface brightness   exp  767rre025 We consider
eective radii re in the range 007  re  300 arcsec For this prole rhl  re
Each model prole was generated on a 01 arcsec pixel grid and then rebinned into 05 arcsec pixels
The model proles were arranged in a grid pattern on a simulation image with each model prole
represented 12 times with slightly dierent positional osets relative to the 05 arcsec pixel grid The
seeing prole was estimated for each image by tting using a PISA routine a combined Gaussian-
exponential-Lorentzian to a few objects identied as stars of similar apparent magnitude to the radio
galaxies The simulation image was then convolved with the model stellar prole and normalized so that
the model proles had the same total intensity as measured for the radio galaxy Gaussian noise was
then added to the simulation image with  equal to the sky noise as measured on the real data
The simulation image was then analysed using PISA with the same detection threshold as used for
the radio galaxy data For each model prole this gave 12 sets of areas above the 8 thresholds with
some scatter between the 12 due to the modelled sky noise and the positional osets between the models
These 12 sets of areas were averaged to give a set of 8 PISA areas corresponding to each model prole
with error bars calculated from the scatter For each radio galaxy we then compared the observed set of
8 areas with those measured for each of the models using a 2 test with the simulation errors
Table 2 shows the results of this comparison for each object with 2 for the point-source models the
exponential scalelength rexp and 2 of the disk-prole model which best ts the observed set of 8 areas
ie which gives the smallest 2 and the eective radius re and 2 of the best-tting bulge model
For a 2 test with 7 degrees of freedom we would expect a perfect model to on average give
2  64 and would estimate 1 errors on rexp and re as the change in the model radius above or below
the best-tting model which increases 2 by 816 above its minimum value However in this analysis
the 8 areas given by PISA are not entirely independent a large noise uctuation could change a pixels
value by more than one threshold interval thus altering more than one of the areas To take this into
account we also 2-test the observed areas above thresholds against each of the 12 representations of
the best-tting model in our simulation image obtaining 12 values of 2 The scatter in these 12 values
of 2 gives the 1 errors listed in Table 2 produced by noise on the best-t models 2 The errors
on the best-t re and rexp can be estimated as the change in these radii which increases 2 above that
of the best-t model by these 1 noise errors However the the true errors on the size estimates may be
somewhat larger due to the approximate modelling of the point-spread function and to asymmetry and
substructure in the real radio galaxies
42 Results
Firstly the point-source models are generally a poor t giving a large 2 Using the estimated noise
errors on 2 we can quantify the rejection of a point-source prole as  2 for 6C101737 but  620
for the other 9 radio galaxies Even for the QSO a pure point-source is rejected by 67 For all objects
except 6C125636 and the QSO there is a disk model andor a bulge model with a 2 suciently low to
indicate consistency within 2 In some cases 2 is very similar for the best-t disk and bulge models
for other galaxies one model may be favoured by as much as several 
Figure 3 shows histograms of the area of each radiogalaxy above the 8 thresholds together with
the areas derived from the point-source model and the best-tting disk and bulge models To compare
the models and data more directly we also show radial intensity proles Figure 4 shows the mean
K-band intensity in r  05 arcsec annuli about the centroid of each radio galaxy together with the
point-source prole and the best-tting disk and bulge models
Table 2 lists the apparent surface brightness SB of each galaxy within the central 05 arcsec
This will correspond only approximately to the intrinsic properties of the galaxies but does show some
dierences between them The mean apparent central SB is 1907  013 K mag arcsec2 for the 10
6C radio galaxies but the QSO is signicantly higher in central SB and the galaxies 6C101737 and
6C112937 are particulaly low The morphologies of the individual galaxies are described below
5 Morphology of Individual Radio Galaxies
1 6C082239 appears symmetric with a prole well-tted by the bulge model which is strongly  4
favoured over a disk model This galaxy appears in the K-band to be a normal elliptical
2 6C094339 is small symmetric object consistent with either disk or bulge at the 1 level On the
basis of this data it could be another normal elliptical
3 6C101136 is small and asymmetric with a much fainter secondary nucleus 17 arcsec from the main
nucleus but clearly within the outer envelope suggesting that it is currently merging with a much smaller
galaxy It may also be interacting with two close companions which produce the peak in the prole at
r  4 arcsec Neither a disk or a bulge prole is strongly favoured
4 6C101737 is another small symmetric object apparently the smallest of these galaxies It is consistent
with either disk or bulge models at the 1 level and the only galaxy consistent at the  3 level with
being a point-source The low central SB is presumably due to the object being faint and unresolved
rather than being an intrinsically low SB galaxy There is no excess above the tted models at either
small or large radii so this object could simply be a small elliptical
5 6C112334 is round and symmetric with a prole consistent with both the disk and bulge models
There is another galaxy about 55 arcsec away but no obvious indication that the two are interacting
This could be a normal elliptical
6 6C112937 is extended and asymmetric with two intensity peaks of similar luminosity These lie well
within the same envelope so that PISA detects 6C112937 as a single galaxy even with the deblend
option The outer regions appear disturbed with some evidence of trails especially to the north This
is the only galaxy in this sample for which the prole signicantly  4 favours an exponential model
over a bulge model It also has a low central SB 049 mag less than the sample mean which as the
galaxy is clearly resolved would imply that the intrinsic central SB is lower than that of the other radio
galaxies A recent red-band WFPC2 image of this galaxy to be described in detail by Best et al in
preparation also showed that
i the two peaks seen on the K image centroids separated by 19 arcsec lie within elongated
structures with tails pointing inwards to the galaxy centre suggesting that they are hotspots associated
with the outward passage of the radio jets rather than the two components of a merger Close to the
centre the jets appear to be aligned with the 137 degree position angle of the two peaks of radio emission
Allington-Smith 1982 Eales et al 1997 although the two radio lobes lie much further out being
separated by 14 arcsec Further out from the centre the R-band jets curve slightly toward a WE axis
causing the K-band peaks to be slightly misaligned from the radio axis
ii The faint extension to the north is a small spiral galaxy of high R-band rest  3000A SB which
appears to be interacting with the larger radio galaxy Allington-Smith et al 1982 had previously found
6C112937 to be double on a ground-based R-band CCD image with the two components separated
north-south so presumably corresponding to the radio galaxy and this companion rather than the two
radio jet hotspots
iii No central point source is visible at rest  3000A
7 6C120435 appears symmetric slightly favouring  1 level a bulge over a disk prole There is
no excess above the tted bulge model at large radii This galaxy seems consistent with being a normal
elliptical
8 6C121736 is extended with a bulge prole favoured over an exponential disk by  2 The outer
regions look slightly asymmetric with some isophotal twist apparent on the contour plot The radial
prole is very close to the bulge model except for a small excess at r  5 arcsec due to a much smaller
companion galaxy This could for example be a normal elliptical just slightly perturbed by a near-miss
encounter resulting in a slight asymmetry
9 6C125636 is extended and double with a less luminous secondary nucleus 25 arcsec from the main
nucleus The outer regions are asymmetric and much more extended than in the other double galaxy
6C101136 with the second nucleus lying within what appears to be an inclined disk The galaxy
may also be interacing with its much smaller nearby companion there a is hint of a bridge between the
two The galaxy is not tted well by either a disk or bulge model having too much area at the lowest
thresholds However the radial prole looks closer to the bulge model at r  2 arcsec and the central SB
is typical of this sample in contrast to 6C112937 suggesting that the primary galaxy is an elliptical
This is consistent with the visual impression of an elliptical merging with a large lower SB disk galaxy
10 6C125736 is closer to a bulge prole than a disk although only by  1 The prole is well-tted
by the bulge model except for an excess at r  4 arcsec due to a small companion galaxy This galaxy
could be another normal elliptical
11 The QSO 5C68 contains a very bright central nucleus giving a central SB higher than that of any
of the 10 radio galaxies and a very small rhl However the object is not a pure point source The
K-band image also shows the extended lower surface brightness host galaxy which appears disturbed
suggesting a recent merger or interaction The prole is close to the tted models at r  3 arcsec but
shows a signicant excess at r  4 arcsec where it is more extended and resembles the proles of the
radio galaxies Consequently neither the disk or bulge models are are a good t and a pure point-source
model is also rejected Two-component models and higher resolution data would be needed to investigate
two-component systems of this type by separately estimating a point-source contribution and an rhl for
the underlying galaxy see Best et al 1997
Despite the long wavelength of observation these galaxies show a signicant morphological diversity
as well as a wide range of half-light radius Two galaxies 6C101136 and 6C125636 appear to be
merging doubles The 6C112937 galaxy is especially unusual - it is interacting and has luminous
features associated with the radio emission visible on the K-band image We refer to this for now as a
radio jet object
Dunlop and Peacock 1993 and Ridgway and Stockton 1997 found that many z  1 3CR galaxies
do show an alignment between their K-band isophotes and radio axes although no alignment was seen for
Parkes radio galaxies an order of magnitude less radioluminous Our 6C sample is intermediate in radio
luminosity so might be expected to contain at least one galaxy with visible K-bandradio alignment
The 6C112937 galaxy appears to be the only galaxy of these 10 with resolved aligned features but
it may also be signicant that 6C094339 6C101735 and 6C120435 show a close alignment within
 10 degrees of their K-band position angles and radio axes Eales et al 1997
The 6C112937 galaxy is also the only object in this sample with a K-band prole which appears to
signicantly favour an exponential over a bulge model Further observations may be needed to determine
whether it is truly a disk galaxy or an elliptical with a prole distorted by the interaction and radio
hotspots but the low central SB compared to the other large double galaxy 6C125636 might favour
a later Hubble type
The other seven galaxies appear at least consistent with the elliptical morphology seen for most radio
galaxies so will be referred to for now as bulgegeneric galaxies We now consider the relation between
angular size luminosity and morphology for these and other radio galaxies
6 Size vs Absolute Magnitude Relation
We estimate the absolute magnitudes of the radio galaxies in the rest-frame Cousins R-band cent 
6560A by subtracting the distance modulus from each observed K magnitude Table 1 and adding a
modelled correction to convert from the observer-frame K-band to the rest-frame R-band
Roche et al 1997 describe a model for the evolution of ES0 galaxies in which star-formation begins
at a high redshift 165 Gyr ago and decreases rapidly with an exponential timescale SF R  05 Gyr
As almost all star-formation occurs at z  3 the evolution is passive at the redshifts we are concerned
with here The star-formation history is converted into an evolving spectral energy distribution using the
stellar evolution models of Charlot and Bruzual 1993 and assuming a Salpeter IMF Figure 5 shows
the Rrest  Kobs correction as a function of redshift derived from this models evolving spectral energy
distribution and also shows Rrest  Kobs from much a bluer model in which star-formation begins at the
same epoch but continues at a constant rate
At z  11 the constant SFR model predicts much bluer observer-frame colours than the ES0
model R  K  35 compared to R  K  55 but the Rrest  Kobs correction diers by only 021 mag
At z  1 many radio galaxies have R  K colours close to a passively evolving model which essentially
denes the red envelope of their colour-redshift distribution but some of the more radioluminous ie
3CR galaxies are as much as  2 mag bluer and would be closer to the constant SFR model Lilly and
Longair 1984 Dunlop and Peacock 1993 Assuming an ES0 model should therefore give a conservative
estimate of MR accurate for the redder galaxies but an underestimate by as much as 021 mag for any
objects which are as blue as the bluest 3CR galaxies
Table 3 gives our estimates of MR All of these 6C galaxies are more luminous than the zero-
redshift L MR  2257 for ellipticals with a mean MR for the radio galaxies excluding the QSO of
2425  018 To investigate the MR  rhl relation we adopt the disk model size estimate rhl  168rexp
for all objects with a smaller minimum 2 for the disk model 6C101136 6C101737 6C112937
6C125636 and the bulge model estimate rhl  re for the others Note that adopting instead the
bulge-model rhl for the four objects with a lower 2 for the disk-model would increase the errors on
their rhl estimates but would not signicantly change their best-t rhl If disk galaxy is observed at an
inclined angle its apparent area will be reduced To estimate the intrinsic size of inclined galaxies we
would obviously use rhl on the major axis rather than the smaller rhl derived from the apparent area
The observed area relative to that seen if the galaxy was seen face-on will be approximately 1  e where
e is the image ellipticity as measured by PISA We therefore correct the rhl estimates for inclination by
multiplying by 1  e05 Table 3 gives the ellipticities and corrected rhl estimates again with 1
errors both in arcsec and in kiloparsecs for the assumed cosmology The unweighted mean of the rhl
estimates for the radio galaxies excluding the QSO is 61  13 kpc
Figure 6 shows rhl against MR for these galaxies with symbols indicating morphological types
together with the 21 3CR galaxies from Best et al 1997 with the tted bulge-model radii converted
to kpc for our assumed cosmology These 3CR galaxies cover a wide redshift range of 047  z  127
with zmean  089 compared to our samples zmean  111 so were divided into two subsamples the 9
galaxies at z  093 with a mean redshift zmean  110 alomst identical to our 6C sample and the
12 at z  093 with zmean  073 The absolute magnitudes of the 3CR galaxies were estimated using
the K-band aperture magnitudes of Lilly and Longair 1984 extrapolated to total magnitudes assuming
bulge proles with re from Best et al 1997 and adopting the same ES0 model Rrest  Kobs correction
as used for the 6C galaxies
The 3CR galaxies are on average more luminous mean MR  2488  015 and much larger
mean rhl  179  15 kpc than the 6C galaxies The 3CR galaxies at 093  z  127 are more
luminous mean MR  2530  016 than those at 047  z  093 mean MR  2456  019 but not
signicantly dierent in size mean rhl  175  17 kpc compared to 182  24 kpc The 3CR galaxies
at 093  z  127 are on average 105  024 mag more luminous in the R-band and  046 dex larger
than our 6C galaxies at the same mean redshift note that this result will not depend signicantly on the
assumed q0 This magnitude dierence is greater than the 07 mag reported by Eales et al 1997 for a
z  06 sample probably as a result of our exclusion of the less evolved 3CR galaxies at 06  z  093
and our use of total rather than metric magnitudes giving a greater dierence in luminosity between
small and large galaxies
To compare these galaxies with those at lower redshift Figure 6 shows local rhl  MR relations
converted from the rhl  MB relations used by eg Roche et al 1997 to the R-band assuming the z  0
colour of B  R  144 for ellipticals as given by the model and B  R  10 for spirals
For ellipticals the Bingelli Sandage and Tarenghi 1984 relation becomes
for MR  2144 and
logrhlkpc  03MR  2001
logrhlkpc  01MR  1714
for MR  2144
For spirals the Freeman 1970 surface brightness becomes
logrhlkpc  02MR  342
Figure 6 also shows an observed sample of low redshift radio galaxies from Owen and Laing 1989
who estimated absolute magnitudes in the Cousins R band and bulge-model-tted radii for z  02
radio galaxies of a number of types We plot their Classical Double FRII Fanaro and Riley 1974
radio galaxies the type most appropriate for comparison with the higher redshift samples with sizes and
magnitudes converted to H0  50 km s1Mpc1 and their isophotal absolute magnitudes extrapolated
to total magnitudes assuming bulge proles with their tted eective and isophotal radii These 24 low
redshift zmean  011 radio galaxies are less luminous mean MR  2337  012 than those at higher
redshift and have a very wide range of sizes with a mean rhl of 125  23 kpc intermediate between the
6C and 3CR galaxies
The QSO is displaced far from the all other sources on this plot on account of its central point-
source As we cannot measure the true galaxy size with this data this object must be excluded from our
discussion of rhl  MR relations
The 6C galaxies are clearly shifted relative to the rhl MR relation of local ellipticals in the direction
of a higher intrinsic SB As noted by Best et al 1997 the 3CR objects also tend to be enhanced in SB
relative to local ellipticals Note that estimates of the intrinsic SB will be independent of the assumed q0
and H0 The rhl  MR relations of both the z  0 and z  1 radio galaxies do not appear to follow the
log rhl  02M  slope of constant SB typical of spirals  they are noticeably steeper and more
consistent with the log rhl  03M  slope of the giant ellipticals Hence to estimate the surface
brightness evolution R relative to local ES0 galaxies of the same size we t the function
logrhlkpc  03MR  R  2001
For the 7 6C galaxies we classed as bulgegeneric types 2 is minimized for R  179  022 mag with
a 2 of only 68 indicating that all 7 are consistent with this single rhl  MR relation One of double
objects 6C101136 lies on the same relation It appears to be undergoing just a minor merger of a
large elliptical with a much less massive dwarf galaxy and this might not greatly aect the total size or
luminosity However the other double object 6C125636 and the radio jet galaxy 6C112937 are of
lower mean SB corresponding to R  101017
017 mag respectively The image
of the 6C125636 galaxy was suggestive of an elliptical merging with a large low surface brightness disk
galaxy This would obviously decrease the mean SB of the combined object and give it a more disk-like
prole while accounting for the central SB remaining high In contrast the radio jet object 6C112937
has a intrinsically low central SB as well as a low mean SB
013 mag and R  105007
An error-weighted t to all 10 6C objects gives R  126  018 mag but with a high 2 of 6216
indicating that the galaxies are not all consistent with a single rhl  MR relation  there is a signicant
dierence between the two relatively low mean SB objects and the relation dened by the other 8
An unweighted t of the same relation to the 24 low redshift FRII galaxies gives R  012  019
mag consistent with unevolved ellipticals An unweighted t to the 21 3CR galaxies gives evolution of
R  080  015 mag rather less than for our sample However if we separately consider the lower
redshift 047  z  092 and higher redshift 092  z  127 3CR subsamples the former gives
R  051  018 and the latter R  120  018 There appears to be surface brightness evolution
of 069  025 mag between the respective mean redshifts of 073 and 110 with the higher redshift
subsample being much closer in size-luminosity relation to the 6C galaxies at zmean  111 We discuss
the implications in Section 7 below
7 Discussion
71 Surface Brightness Evolution
Using ground-based data we have carried out a preliminary investigation of the K-band angular size
and morphology of 6C radio galaxies at 1  z  14 Our rst result is that the 6C galaxies typically
have smaller K-band half-light radii than 3CR radio galaxies at similar redshifts This appears to exclude
the hypothesis that 3CR and 6C sources at z  1 have identical host galaxies and the higher K-band
luminosity of the 3CR sources eg Eales et al 1997 is due solely to their more powerful active nuclei
If this was the case the 3CR galaxies would have smaller half-light radii than their 6C counterparts due
to the greater dominance of the central point-sources The dierence in K luminosity appears to be due
primarily to the stellar components which in the 3CR galaxies are considerably larger and presumably
more massive
We estimate that the zmean  111 6C galaxies show a mean surface brightness enhancement of
126  018 mag in the rest-frame Cousins R-band relative to the rhl  MR relation of local ellipticals
This degree of evolution is consistent with the 120  018 mag we estimate for a subsample of more
radioluminous 3CR galaxies at the same mean redshift However the 6C galaxies which most resembled
normal ellipticals appeared to show greater SB evolution of 179  022 mag One possible explanation
for this higher estimate is that some radio galaxies contain central point sources which with the limited
resolution of our data are not distinguished from the underlying galaxy but do cause an underestimate
of rhl This would cause the SB evolution to be overestimated and if the eect on rhl is very large
might even account for the dierence in the mean rhl of the 3CR and 6C galaxies To estimate the likely
eect of point-source contamination we consider a bulge-prole model with re  18 arcsec  the mean
size of the Best et al 1997 3CR galaxies  to which is added a central point-source contributing from
0 to 100 of the total ux These models were convolved with seeing proles and normalized to have
K  174 with sky noise typical of the real Redeye data and then analysed in the same way as the real
radio galaxy images
Figure 7 shows the estimated bulge-model re as a function of the point-source contribution to the total
ux A point-source component of 10 reduces the tted re by  25 so could increase the estimated
R by 042 mag This would be sucient to account for much of the dierence in the estimated DeltaR
between the bulgegeneric 6C galaxies and the 3CR galaxies However to reduce the tted rhl from
18 arcsec to 055 arcsec the mean size of the 6C galaxies would require a much larger point-source
contribution of  30 It is extremely unlikely that such luminous point-sources are typical of the 6C
radio galaxies Although we are at present only able to exclude a strong central point-source in the case
of 6C112937 for which we have WFPC2 data only 221 of the 3CR galaxies of Best et al 1997 had
proles consistent with any point-source component of  10 in the observed K-band and if anything
the less radioluminous 6C galaxies would be expected to show less nuclear activity
Hence it seems that central point-sources would not make more than a small contribution to the
dierence in rhl between 6C and 3CR galaxies but they might still be present in the bulgegeneric
galaxies at the  10 level and be sucient to cause an overestimate of the surface brightness evolution
by up to  042 mag This would still leave at least  137 mag of genuine evolution This is still less
than the surface brightness enhancement of z  3 galaxies on the Hubble Deep Field eg Jones and
Disney 1997 Roche et al 1997b so there is no doubt that such a degree of SB evolution is possible for
large galaxies at z  1
In constrast the SB of FRII radio galaxies at zmean  011 showed only 012  019 mag of evolution
relative to the local elliptical rhl  MR relation so these objects are consistent with being unevolved
ellipticals or with the 012 mag of passive evolution predicted by our model at their mean redshift This
conrms that the assumed rhl  MR relation is appropriate for powerful radio galaxies at low redshifts
as well as for normal ellipticals and hence that the rhl  MR relation of FRII radio galaxies in particular
does shift with increasing redshift As would be expected a zmean  073 subsample of 3CR galaxies
showed intermediate evolution estimated as 051  018 mag
This progressive shift of the rhl  MR relation with increasing redshift is similar to that seen for
normal radioquiet ellipticals over a similar redshift range Schade et al 1997 found the rest-frame
blue-band surface brightness evolution of a mixture of eld and cluster ellipticals to be best-tted by
078z mag for q0  05 or  092z mag for a low q0 This is consistent with the passively evolving ES0
model described in Section 6 which predicts MB  091 mag at z  1 In the rest-frame Cousins
red-band the model predicts slightly less evolution of MR  071 mag with 063 mag at z  073
consistent with observations for the 3CR galaxies and 075 mag at z  111 a little less than observed
Hence there may be at least marginal indications that some z  1 radio galaxies in both the 3CR and 6C
catalogs undergo more optical evolution than expected from passive evolution This might be explained
as the more rapid fading of those components of the radio galaxy luminosity not produced by old stellar
populations eg young stars formed along the radio jets see Best et al 1996 and diuse scattered
light from the central AGN Note also that a steeper IMF could increase the rate of passive luminosity
evolution
72 Implications for Radio Galaxy Evolution
The simplest evolutionary scenario is that surface brightness changes but rhl does not Although
there is probably some increase with time in the mean size of galaxies angular sizes from WFPC2 data
suggest that for ellipticals this is a small eect out to z  1 eg Im et al 1996 Roche et al 1997
Assuming no evolution in rhl the estimated radii of the z  11 6C galaxies would on the basis of the
assumed local rhl  MR relation indicate their local counterparts to have a mean absolute magnitude
MR  226 ie about L and therefore suggest that many evolve into L  L ellipticals Most
of the z  02 FRII radio galaxies in the Owen and Laing 1989 sample are ellipticals of modest size
and L  L luminosity although quite high radio luminosities of L1400MHz  10263 WHz1
is tempting to identify these as the low redshift counterparts of our 6C galaxies Their typical radio
luminosity corresponds to L151MHz  10272 WHz1 for the average SED of luminous radio galaxies
  094 so this would require a factor of  25 decrease in radio luminosity since z  11 This is
consistent with the 6C radio luminosity function undergoing the same   33 Gyr rate of evolution as
estimated Padovani and Urry 1992 for that of 3CR galaxies but of course if our identication is correct
the evolution of the radio luminosity function must be due to the evolution of individual objects rather
than simply a change in the number of galaxies which become powerful radio sources
Owen and Laing 1989 and Owen and White 1991 found that the classical double FRII radio
galaxies at z  02 were typically  1016 higher in radio luminosity Lrad than FRI galaxies of similar
optical luminosity with the dividing line between the classes following a Lrad  L2
opt relation Ledlow
and Owen 1996 As previously reported by eg Longair and Seldner 1979 and Prestage and Peacock
1988 1989 the FRI radio galaxies tended to lie within clusters on average Abell class 0 while nearby
FRIIs were usually in eld environments However Yates Miller and Peacock 1989 and Hill and Lilly
1991 found that powerful radio galaxies at higher redshifts z  05 were as likely to lie in Abell class
0-1 clusters as in the eld suggesting a more rapid Lrad evolution for the sources in clusters
If any of these 6C galaxies lie in rich clusters their low redshift counterparts might instead be FRI
galaxies like the smaller of those in the Owen and White 1991 sample with much lower present-day
radio luminosities of L1400MHz  10247 WHz1 This corresponds to L151MHz  10256 WHz1 a
factor of  1000 down on the Lrad of our 6C galaxies Yee and Ellingson 1993 estimate that the optical
luminosity evolution of AGN in rich cluster environments Abell class  1 is as rapid as   10  02
Gyr out to z  06 but at higher redshifts must be similar to other AGN If this form of evolution is
paralleled by the evolution of Lrad it would predict a decrease in Lrad of a factor of  1000 since z  11
exactly the amount required
We estimate that the mean MR of 3CR and 6C galaxies at z  11 diers by 105  024 mag
The mean radius of the 3CR galaxies is much larger and with no size evolution would correspond to
low-redshift counterparts with MR  242 several L On this basis we suggest that the dierence in
3CR and 6C luminosity at rest  1m is due to a dierence in the stellar masses of the the host galaxies
As the radio luminosities dier by a factor  6 this suggests a correlation Lrad  M 2
stellar
A possible scenario explaining these observations is that
i At z  1 the maximum radio luminosity is strongly correlated with the stellar mass of the host
galaxy approximately as Lrad  M 2 This relation could physically be related to the higher pressure
of surrounding gas and perhaps the more massive central black hole in a more massive galaxy see eg
Eales 1992 Rawlings and Saunders 1991 At z  1 many of the 3CR and 6C galaxies may be observed
while close to this upper limit with the 3CR galaxies typically being  25 times more massive and hence
 6 times more radioluminous
ii High redshift radio galaxies exist in a mixture of eld and cluster environments The peak Lrad
attained during subsequent bursts of radio emission decreases more rapidly for radio galaxies in a rich
cluster environment Yee and Ellingson 1993 By z  0 the cumulative eect of this environmental
dependence amounts to a factor of  1016 in Lrad between Abell class 0 environments and the eld
obscuring the Lrad  M 2 correlation seen at z  1 However as cluster environment also inuences the
evolution of the radio morphology a Lrad  M 2 correlation reappears when nearby radio galaxies are
separated into FRI and FRII types Ledlow and Owen 1996
At any rate the high surface brightness and relatively small size of the 6C galaxies seems to argue
that their evolution at both optical and radio wavelengths is no less rapid than that of the 3CR galaxies
Although the K  z relation of 6C galaxies may have appeared consistent with no evolution Eales et al
1997 their rhl  MR relation clearly is not Of course the results of this paper being based on a small
dataset of marginally adequate depth and resolution can only be regarded as a preliminary We intend
to investigate larger numbers of z  1 radio galaxies using NICMOS and ground-based adaptive optics
to better constrain half-light radius and morphology and to separate out bulge disk point-source and
radio jet components
8 Summary of Main Conclusions
i A sample of 6C radio galaxies at 1  z  14 observed in the K-band showed signicant
morpological diversity Two appeared to be undergoing mergers and another possessed two bright peaks
aligned with the radio jets and may be closer to an exponential than a bulge prole but the other seven
were more consistent with normal elliptical morphologies in the K-band
ii We estimated a mean half-light radius of 61  13 kpc for the 6C galaxies which is similar to
that of present-day L  L ellipticals and signicantly smaller than the 3CR galaxies studied by Best et
al 1997 The dierence between the measured sizes of 6C and 3CR galaxies cannot be accounted for
by point-source contamination unless at the  30 level which seems implausible on the basis of the
lack of point-sources in the 3CR galaxies Hence the dierence in rest  1m luminosity between 3CR
and 6C galaxies at z  11 must results from a dierence in the sizes of the host galaxies and not solely
from a dierence in the power of the central nuclei
iii The size-luminosity relation of the 6C galaxies at z  11 is oset from that of either local
ellipticals or FRII radiogalaxies at z  02 indicating 1018 magnitudes of surface brightness evolution
in the rest-frame R-band This is similar to the 120 mag of surface brightness evolution seen for 3CR
galaxies at the same redshift suggesting that the 6C galaxies are undergoing a similar amount of evolution
at optical wavelengths
iv The sizes of the 6C galaxies are consistent with their low-redshift counterparts being FRII radio
galaxies like those studied by Owen and Laing 1989 a factor of  25 lower in radio luminosity suggesting
radio luminosity evolution similar to the Padovani and Urry 1992 estimate for 3CR galaxies Any 6C
galaxies which lie in clusters may undergo a much greater reduction in radio luminosity to become FRI
objects
