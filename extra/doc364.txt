Abstract
We present some early results from our deep imaging survey of galaxy clusters intended to
detect and study intracluster light ICL From our observations to date we nd that ICL
is common in galaxy clusters and that substructure in the ICL also appears to be common
as well We also discuss some initial comparisons of our imaging results to high-resolution
numerical simulations of galaxy clusters and give avenues for future research
Introduction
The concept of intracluster starlight ICL or stars between the galaxies in galaxy
clusters is not a new one it was rst proposed over 50 years ago Zwicky 1951 However
progress in studying ICL has been slow due to its low surface brightness which is less
than 1 of the brightness of the night sky see Vlchez-Gmez 1999 Feldmeier 2000 for
reviews This is unfortunate because ICL is a powerful probe of the evolution of galaxies
in clusters Dressler 1984 and of cluster evolution overall
In the last six years however the study of ICL has increased dramatically Numerous
individual intracluster stars have been detected in nearby and distant galaxy clusters Arn-

Gal-Yam et al 2003 At the same time deep imaging of clusters with CCD detectors have
also detected the intracluster light Uson Boughn  Kuhn 1991 Vchez-Gomez Pell

Trentham  Mobasher 1998 Gregg  West 1998 Calcaneo-Roldn et al 2000 in clusters
have shown that at there is signicant substructure in the ICL and that the production of
ICL is ongoing
Encouraged by these results we have undertaken a deep imaging survey of galaxy clus-
ters intended to quantify the properties of ICL as a function of environment and overall
galaxy cluster properties From our deep imaging with careful attention to systematic errors
eg Morrison Boroson  Harding 1994 Morrison et al 1997 we are able to measure
the ICL to faint surface brightnesses many magnitudes below that of the night sky vICL
 2628 In tandem with the observations we are constructing numerical simulations of
galaxy clusters in a cosmological context similar to those of Dubinski 1998
Here we present the results of our deep imaging survey to date We note that there are
J J Feldmeier et al
several other searches for ICL underway that have complementary goals see Gonzalez et al
this volume Krick et al this volume
The Survey
For our initial survey we focus on observing Abell clusters Abell Corwin 
Olowin 1989 at large distance classes 56 corresponding to z  0102 This is to
ensure that the entire cluster is contained in our eld-of-view for good sky subtraction but
the clusters are not so distant that cosmological 1  z4 surface brightness dimming is a
major effect We are also observing a few nearby clusters from the MKWAWM Morgan
Kayser White 1975 Albert White  Morgan 1977 as a comparison sample Our goal
is to gather a representative sample of clusters with different richness Bautz-Morgan and
Rood-Sastry types We have observed ten clusters so far ACO 84 98 545 801 1234 1413
1553 1914 2443 and MKW 7 and plan to observe 45 more before completing this initial
survey
We observe using the KPNO 21m and image through the Washington M lter which
is similar to V but contains fewer night sky emission lines We use the ultra-deep surface
photometry techniques of Morrison Boroson  Harding 1994 for our observations and
data reduction We spend half of our telescope time constructing our dark sky ats which
are at to 03 on all scales in the worst case and the other half observing the clusters
We then carefully mask out all objects in our frames using a combination of the DAOPHOT
Stetson 1987 SExtractor Bertin  Arnouts 1996 and our own software After detecting
the ICL we construct an error model for each cluster that includes all sources of error both
random and systematic Our data has a signal-to-noise of ve including systematic errors
see Feldmeier et al 2002 for an example of the error model at a surface brightness of 265
mag arcsec- 2 The signal-to-noise ratio approaches unity at v 283 mag arsec- 2
The results of the rst two clusters have been published in Feldmeier et al 2002 work
is ongoing on the other clusters A mosaic of the rst ve clusters is shown in Figure 11
Once this initial survey is complete we plan to observe nearby clusters using the CWRU
Burrell Schmidt which is currently being optimized for ultra-deep surface photometry
Results
From the clusters we have observed so far it seems that diffuse intracluster light
and intracluster tidal debris is common in galaxy clusters Fig 12 shows an example of a
tidal plume superimposed over the brightest cluster galaxy in the cluster MKW 7 Similar
tidal features can be seen in Abell 1914 see the boxed regions in Figure 11 and in several
other clusters Although our sample is still small it seems that the clusters that are cD-
dominated Abell 1413 MKW 7 have smoother more regular ICL than those in clusters
that do not have a cD galaxy ACO 1234 1553  1914 In these non cD clusters the ICL
follows an irregular distribution and is not well correlated with galaxy density
Tidal features of the kind we have detected can be seen in high-resolution cluster N-body
simulations eg Moore et al 1996 Dubinski 1998 Dubinski Murali  Ouyed 2001 see
also Willman this volume but thus far we have seen few long tidal debris arcs Plume-
like intracluster debris structures seem to be more common in the clusters we have surveyed
thus far However it is clear from the simulations that the vast majority of tidal debris
seen in cluster simulations has a surface brightness much lower than our limit of v 265

Fig 11 Images of ve clusters observed in this survey From left to right and top
to bottom they are Abell 1413 MKW 7 Abell 1914 Abell 1234 and Abell 1553
The last three clusters show only the central section of the image these clusters
show a wealth of ICL substructure Many of the brighter galaxies at the center
of each cluster lie within a low surface brightness common envelope and there are
clearly dened tidal features most noticeably in Abell 1914 denoted by the boxes
This in contrast to the rst two clusters which had less substructure Feldmeier
et al 2002
Fig 12 Our residual image for MKW 7 after the best-tting elliptical model of
the cD  ICL has been subtracted The black ellipse shows where the measured
surface brightness has a signal-to-noise greater than ve A large tidal plume is
apparent leading from the center of the image to the right south and up west
of the galaxys nucleus The magnitude of this plume is approximately equal to a
small galaxy Mv  - 17
mag arsec- 2 for the initial observations The structures that we have observed are likely to
be the brightest features in each cluster
Another interesting facet of our observations is the nature of cD galaxy envelopes which
are characterized by an excess of diffuse light compared to an R14 law at large radius
The origin of cD envelopes remains unclear are they formed in the initial stages of cluster
collapse Merritt 1983 1984 or later as galaxies continue to fall in the cluster and become
tidally stripped The accepted view of cD envelopes Schombert 1992 is that cDs in rich
galaxy clusters have large extended cD envelopes while brightest cluster galaxies in poorer
clusters do not In our observations of Abell 1413 and MKW 7 we have found the opposite
behavior MKW 7 a poor cluster has a strong cD envelope while Abell 1413 has a weaker
cD envelope than previously measured Since other researchers have also found cDs in
rich clusters with pure R14 laws eg Gonzalez 2000 this may signify that the earlier
photographic surface photometry of cDs may need to be re-examined
Future Work
Our initial survey will be completed by the end of 2003 we then plan to begin
observations on the Burrell Schmidt The wide eld of view of the Schmidt  15 degrees
will allow us to observe more nearby galaxy clusters where much more is known about their
properties We also plan to run additional large-scale galaxy cluster simulations over a range
of cosmologies and initial conditions so that we can make detailed comparisons between our
imaging survey and theoretical results
A nal goal is to create quantitative metrics for the ICL that can be used on simulations
and observations In Figure 13 we show one potential metric the amount of stellar luminos-
ity as a function of surface brightness applied to the cluster simulation of Dubinski 1998
at two different redshifts In this relation dynamically evolved clusters have a shallower
slope to their surface brightness distribution function than dynamically younger clusters
From comparison of multiple simulations the intrinsic scatter in this slope at xed redshift
is low  4 More testing is needed but the results seem promising
J J Feldmeier et al
Fig 13 A surface brightness histogram of all starlight from a N-body simula-
tion by Dubinski 1998 As can be clearly seen as the cluster evolves more
starlight is accreted causing an offset between the two histograms and starlight
is stripped from the high-surface brightness galaxies and re-distributed into lower
surface brightness ICL features This stripping causes the surface brightness his-
togram slope to become more shallow over time This relation which is in principle
observable may allow us to place limits on the dynamical age of galaxy clusters
