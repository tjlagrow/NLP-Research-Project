ABSTRACT
We use deep Herschel Space Observatory observations of a 90 complete sample of
32 intermediate-redshift 2Jy radio galaxies 005  z  07 to estimate the dust
masses of their host galaxies and thereby investigate the triggering mechanisms for
their quasar-like AGN The dust masses derived for the radio galaxies 72  105 
Md  26  108 M are intermediate between those of quiescent elliptical galaxies on
the one hand and ultra luminous infrared galaxies ULIRGs on the other Consistent
with simple models for the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host
galaxies these results suggest that most radio galaxies represent the late time re-
triggering of AGN activity via mergers between the host giant elliptical galaxies and
companion galaxies with relatively low gas masses However a minority of the radio
galaxies in our sample 20 have high ULIRG-like dust masses along with evidence
for prodigious star formation activity The latter objects are more likely to have been
triggered in major gas-rich mergers that represent a rapid growth phase for both their
host galaxies and their supermassive black holes

INTRODUCTION
Radio-loud AGN are particularly important for understand-
ing the links between galaxy evolution and nuclear activ-
ity because in contrast to samples of radio-quiet AGN in
the local Universe eg Seyfert galaxies they are invariably
associated with early-type host galaxies allowing relatively
clean searches to be made for the signs of the triggering
events They also drive powerful relativistic jets that are ca-
pable of projecting the power of the AGN into the gaseous
haloes of the host galaxies and clusters of galaxies directly
aecting the cooling of the hot IGMICM gas  one of the
most important forms of AGN-induced feedback Best et al
2006 McNamara  Nulsen 2007
Recently we have undertaken a major programme of
optical Ramos Almeida et al 2011 2012 and mid- to far-
IR Dicken et al 2008 2009 2012 observations of the

2Jy sample of southern radio galaxies 005  z  07
Tadhunter et al 1998 aimed at directly investigating the
triggering mechanisms for radio-loud AGN Our deep Gem-
ini optical imaging observations show tidal features tails
shells fans bridges at relatively high surface brightness
levels in a majority of objects 85 consistent with the
idea that radio-loud AGN represent a eeting active phase
in the evolution of the subset of giant elliptical galaxies that
have recently undergone galaxy interactions and mergers
Ramos Almeida et al 2012 However the radio-loud AGN
phase does not correspond to a single stage of the merger se-
quence nor to a single type of galaxy merger or interaction
Ramos Almeida et al 2011 2012 Such apparent diversity
is also consistent with the fact that only a minority 635
of our sample show evidence for recent star formation activ-
ity based on the direct detection of young stellar populations
at optical wavelengths Tadhunter et al 2002 2011 far-IR

Our previous work suggests that only a small frac-
tion 620 of morphologically disturbed elliptical galax-
ies are capable of hosting a powerful radio-loud AGN
Ramos Almeida et al 2012 Therefore simply undergo-
ing a galaxy interaction of any type is not by itself su-
cient to trigger a powerful radio-loud AGN in a giant el-
liptical galaxy One of the most important additional fac-
tors is likely to be gas content it is probable that power-
ful FRII-like radio activity is triggered by accretion of the
coolwarm phases of the ISM rather than the hot phase
eg Hardcastle Evans  Croston 2007 Therefore we ex-
pect the ability to host a powerful radio-loud AGN to be re-
lated at some level to the total reservoir of cool ISM which
in the case of the elliptical galaxy hosts of radio-loud AGN
is likely to have had an external origin
Simple arguments allow us to predict the total gas reser-
voir required to trigger quasar-like activity and sustain it
over the quasar lifetime tqso yr If we dene a quasar to
have a bolometric luminosity of LBOL  1038 W a mass
M  02 M yr1 onto the central supermas-
inow rate of
sive black hole is required to produce the quasar activity
assuming an eciency of 10 Therefore over the lifetime of
the quasar the supermassive black hole will accrete a mass
Mac  02tqso M amounting to Mac  2  106 M for a
typical quasar lifetime of tqso  107 yr Martini 2004 How-
ever on the basis of the black hole mass vs host bulge mass
correlations we know that only a small fraction of the gas
accreted by the bulge reaches the supermassive black hole
for every solar mass accreted by a supermassive black hole
500 solar masses of stars must be formed in the bulge of
the host galaxy Marconi  Hunt 2003 In this case the
total gas reservoir that is expected to be associated with
a particular quasar triggering event Mtot is much larger
Mtot  100tqso M or Mtot  109 M for tqso  107 yr
Although this argument is over-simplied in the sense that
some of gas may already have been used up in star formation
or ejected by feedback processes by the time the quasar is
observed it provides an order-of-magnitude estimate of the
total gas reservoir required
In this letter we use deep Herschel observations of a
sample of nearby powerful radio galaxies with quasar-like
nuclei to address the issue of whether the total cool ISM
reservoirs are as massive as expected based on this simple
model for the co-evolution of galaxy bulges and their central
supermassive black holes We also use the results to investi-
gate the nature of the triggering merger events A cosmology
with H0  71 km s1 Mpc1 m  027 and   073 is
assumed throughout this paper
2 SAMPLE OBSERVATIONS AND DATA
REDUCTION
The full sample for this project as described in Dicken et al
2009 2012 comprises all 46 radio sources with redshifts
005  z  07 radio uxes S27GHz  20 Jy declinations
  10 degrees and radio spectral indices   07 as-
suming F    This southern 2Jy sample is now the best

and PKS0349-27 bottom The symbols are as follows Open

uxes lled squares SpitzerMIPS uxes The solid lines repre-
sent the SpitzerIRS spectra for the sources
observed of all samples of powerful radio galaxies in terms of
the depth and completeness of its multi-wavelength data1
All 46 objects in the southern 2Jy sample were ob-
served at 100 and 160m with the Herschel PACS instru-
ment as part of a programme of Must Do observations in
the last days of Herschel and the 16 objects with the bright-
est Spitzer 70m uxes were also observed with the Herschel
SPIRE instrument at 250 350 and 500m in order to char-
acterise the shapes of their longer-wavelength SEDs The
depths of the PACS observations allowed us to detect 100
and 87 of the sample at 100 and 160m respectively In ad-
dition for the purposes of quantifying the degree of any non-
thermal contamination of the Herschel photometry we made
sub-mm 870m observations with LABOCAAPEX of the
20 objects previous identied with Spitzer as having the pos-
sibility of non-thermal contamination Dicken et al 2008
Although our full sample comprises a mixture of weak-
line radio galaxies WLRG and strong-line radio galaxies
SLRG EWOIII  10 A in this paper we concentrate on
the 35 objects in our sample with strong emission lines in-
dicating the presence of quasar-like AGN in addition to the
powerful radio jets and lobes Discussion of the full sample
including details of the observations data reduction far-
IR photometry and SEDs will be presented in Dicken et al

The cool dust contents of powerful radio galaxies
2014 while basic information about the SLRG sample used
in this paper is presented separately in the Appendix in Ta-
ble A1
In Figure 1 top we show an example SED of one of the
brighter sources in our sample for which we have full ux
information across the Herschel PACS and SPIRE bands
while in Figure 1 bottom we show the SED of a more
typical fainter object that was only detected with PACS
Given that all the objects in our sample are radio-loud
AGN it is important to be cautious about the potential con-
tamination of the far-IR continuum by non-thermal emission
from the synchrotron-emitting radio jets lobes and cores
As discussed in Dicken et al 2008 such contamination
is most likely to be important in objects where the at-
spectrum cores and inner jets are unusually strong or the
steep-spectrum radio lobes are contained within the Her-
schel beam for the PACS and SPIRE observations By us-
ing simple power-law extrapolations of our high frequency
20 GHz radio and LABOCA 870m measurements we
nd that non-thermal contamination is signicant at far-
IR wavelengths in 635 17 of the objects in our SLRG
sample see Dicken et al 2014 for details For three of
these objects  all compact steep spectrum sources  it
has proved possible to accurately subtract the non-thermal
power-law and thereby derive uxes and luminosities for
the thermal dust emission However for the remaining three
sources PKS0035-02 PKS1136-13 and PKS1306-09 the
non-thermal contamination makes a larger contribution at
far-IR wavelengths and we cannot condently subtract this
component because of uncertainties about the extrapolation
of the SEDs Therefore we exclude the latter three objects
from our analysis2 making our sample of 2Jy SLRG 90
complete overall
3 DETERMING THE COOL DUST MASSES
The determination of dust masses from the far-IR data is
highly sensitive to the assumptions made in the analysis
for example the form of the long-wavelength dust emissivity
law as characterised by the  index for a modied black
body t F    B T  and the number of cool dust
components of dierent temperature assumed in the model
eg Clements Dunne  Eales 2010
In order to simplify our analysis and allow the direct
comparisons with the dust masses of ULIRGs and normal
non-active elliptical galaxies presented in Section 4 and Fig-
ure 2 we assumed a single temperature Td for the cool
dust in each object Furthermore we assumed that all ob-
jects in our sample have the same  index In this case the
dust mass is given by
160B160 Td1  z
where SK
the luminosity distance m
160 is the K-corrected ux density at 160m D is
160 is the dust opacity per unit
2 Note that the upper limiting dust masses derived for these ob-
jects by assuming that all their 160m radiation is dust emission
fall well within the range measured for the other objects in our
sample excluding these objects does not aect any of the com-
parisons with the other samples in section 4
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
mass at a wavelength of 160m and B 160 Td is the ux
density of a black body of temperature Td at 160m For
the purposes of this analysis we assume 160  106 m2
kg1 Draine 2003
We determined a typical  index for the objects in our
sample by comparing the 100160 and 160250 colours mea-
sured for the brighter objects observed with SPIRE with the
predicted colours for modied black bodies of dierent tem-
perature and beta index see Dicken et al 2014 From this
comparison we nd that   12 is most consistent with the
observations of the far-IR bright 2Jy objects in our sample
We then determined the temperatures of the cool dust
components for all the objects in our sample with both 100
and 160m uxes by comparing the 100160 ux ratios with
those predicted by modied black body curves of dierent
Td but the same  index   12 with uncertainties in
the temperatures estimated from the uncertainties in the
100160 ux ratios The cool dust temperatures fall in the
range 30  Td  70 K with a median dust temperature
Td  41 K Finally the dust masses were calculated from
the K-corrected 160m uxes and estimated temperatures
using equation 1 above Note that the uncertainties in the
dust masses take into account the uncertainties in both the
far-IR uxes and the dust temperatures but are inevitably
dominated by the uncertainties in the temperatures
Six of the SLRG in our sample were not detected at
160m In such cases we derived the dust masses using
the K-corrected 100m uxes assuming the median dust
temperature derived from the other 26 objects in the sam-
100  271 m2 kg1 Draine 2003 in equation 1
ple and m
The distribution dust masses for these six objects is simi-
lar to that of the sample as a whole Therefore the inclu-
sionexclusion of these objects does not alter our conclu-
Clearly our dust mass results are sensitive to the as-
sumed value of the  index which aects both the tem-
peratures derived from the 100160 ux ratios and the K-
correction of the far-IR uxes However we nd that chang-
ing the  index from 12 to 20  the value assumed in some
studies of dust masses in elliptical galaxies for example 
only increases the median dust mass by 80 Moreover
comparisons between the dust masses derived for various
overlapping samples of low redshift ULIRGs Klaas et al
2001 Farrah et al 2003 Clements et al 2010 and elliptical
galaxies Smith et al 2012 di Serego Aligieri et al 2013
Martini Dicken  Storchi-Bergmann 2013 suggest that the
eect of changing the  index number of dust components
and general modelling approach is at most a factor of 2  3
in the dust mass This will not signicantly aect the main
results of the comparisons with the samples of the quiescent
elliptical galaxies and ULIRGs presented in the next section
4 RESULTS
The main result of this study is that the SLRG in our
complete sample are moderately dust-rich Figure 2 shows
a histogram of the dust masses derived from our Herschel
data The dust masses cover the range 72  105  Md 
26  108 M with a median dust mass of 85  106 M
Assuming a typical gas-to-dust ratio of 140 Draine 2007
Parkin et al 2012 these translate into gas masses in the
C Tadhunter et al
range 10  108  Mg  37  1010 M with a median gas
mass of 12  109 M We note that this median gas mass
is remarkably close to that predicted on the basis of the
simple argument presented in the introduction Therefore
it appears that there is indeed sucient cool ISM in these
radio galaxies to sustain the quasar-like activity for the req-
uisite timescales and simultaneously grow the stellar mass
of the host galaxies maintaining the black holehost scaling
relationships
To put these results into context Figure 2 also shows
the distributions of dust masses derived for nearby ULIRGs
and elliptical galaxies The ULIRG dust masses were taken
from the results of the variable  index modied black body
ts to the far-IRsub-mm SEDs of the sample of 23 nearby
z  017 ULIRGs presented by Clements et al 2010
while the elliptical galaxy dust masses were taken from the
modied black body   2 results for the non-active el-
lipticals in Smith et al 2012 and di Serego Aligieri et al
2013 as well as from the template tting results of Martini
et al 2013 the nal sample of elliptical galaxies comprises
40 objects with distances in the range 15  D  66 Mpc
The median dust masses of the ULIRG and elliptical
galaxy samples plotted in Figure 2 are 8  107 M and
2  105 M respectively At the high dust mass end of the
distributions there is clearly an overlap between the dust
massses of the radio galaxies and those of the ULIRGs the
lower end of the radio galaxy dust mass distribution also
overlaps with the higher end of the elliptical dust mass dis-
tribution However on average the radio galaxies have dust
masses that are more than an order of magnitude higher than
those of typical elliptical galaxies but an order of magnitude
lower than those of typical ULIRGs
We emphasise that our comparison between the 2Jy ra-
dio galaxies and the elliptical galaxies is conservative be-
cause a we have included upper limiting dust masses for
the elliptical galaxies 53 of cases as if they were de-
tections b for objects in common between the samples we
have favoured the Smith et al 2012 single modied black
body ts  which give generally larger dust masses  over
the Martini et al 2013 template tting results and c
the elliptical galaxy dust mass estimates are dominated by
the results of the Smith et al 2013 and di Serego Alighieri
et al 2013   20 single modied black body ts which
tend to give higher dust masses than the   12 ts used
for the radio galaxies
In terms of the comparison with the ULIRGs the sin-
gle modied black body ts of Clements et al 2010 with
variable beta index as shown in Figure 2 are the most
comparable with the   12 results presented for the radio
galaxies However even if we compare the   20 results for
the 2Jy radio galaxies with the   20 results of Klaas et al
2001  which give the lowest dust masses of all the low-z
ULIRG studies  the radio galaxy dust masses remain a
factor 4 lower on average
We further note that the total cool ISM mass implied by
the median radio galaxy dust mass Mg  12  109 M is
signicantly lower than that of the Milky Way 48109 M
Draine 2011 and about a factor of two higher than that of
the Large Magellanic Cloud LMC 5108 M Westerlund
The other interesting feature of the radio galaxy dust
mass distribution is that a large proportion 78  of the

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The cool dust contents of powerful radio galaxies
The dust masses of the radio source host galaxies and the
total cool ISM masses that they imply provide important
clues to the nature of the events that triggered the power-
ful AGN and jet activity in these systems complementing
existing studies of the 2Jy sample host galaxy morphologies
Ramos Almeida et al 2011 2012 and levels of star forma-
tion activity Dicken et al 2012
The radio galaxies with the highest dust masses have
cool ISM contents morphologies and star formation prop-
erties that are similar to those of ULIRGs in the local Uni-
verse In such cases it is likely that the AGN have been
triggered in major gas-rich mergers in which a substantial
fraction of the stellar mass is being built up via merger-
induced star formation and in which the black holes are
undergoing a major growth phase However such starburst
radio galaxies are rare in the local radio galaxy popula-
tion Tadhunter et al 2011 Dicken et al 2012 More typ-
ical radio galaxies have much lower cool ISM masses and
most of them lack evidence for recent star formation activ-
ity Dicken et al 2012 even if they do show morphologi-
cal signs of recent galaxy interactions Ramos Almeida et al
2011 2012 In these more typical cases it is likely that we
are witnessing the late-time re-triggering of quasar activ-
ity via mergers between mature giant elliptical galaxies and
companion galaxies that have gas masses between those of
the LMC and M33 in the Local Group As we showed in
the introduction such mergers are capable of delivering suf-
ciently massive reservoirs of cool gas to the radio source
hosts to fuel quasar-like activity on the requisite timescales
Finally we note that while most of the nearby ellipti-
cal galaxies that lack powerful AGN activity have low dust
masses see Figure 2 a small but signicant fraction of such
objects have much larger dust masses An interesting exam-
ple in the local Universe is Centaurus A which is associated
with a relatively low-power FRI radio source and currently
lacks a powerful quasar AGN but nonetheless contains a
substantial reservoir of cool ISM in its well-known dust lane
Md  16  107 M Mg  27  109 M Parkin et al
2012 This raises the question of why Centaurus A and
gas-rich but quiescent elliptical galaxies in general do not
always appear as quasars Most likely the presence of a sub-
stantial gas reservoir is a necessary but not sucient con-
dition for triggering luminous quasar activity other factors
such as the detailed distribution and kinematics of the cool
ISM are also likely to be important In the particular case
of Centaurus A it is plausible that we are observing the sys-
tem in a late post-merger phase in which the ISM in the
dust lane has settled into a dynamicallly stable congura-
tion see also Tadhunter et al 2011 In this case the radial
gas ows into the nuclear regions are insucient to sustain
luminous quasar activity In contrast objects with quasar
nuclei may represent an earlier phase in the merger when
the gas is still settling into a stable conguration and the
rate of radial ow of the gas into the nucleus is much higher
Clearly high resolution CO observations that measure both
the distribution and kinematics of the cool ISM in nearby
radio galaxies with quasar-like nuclei will be crucial for mak-
ing further progress in this eld Such observations will also
provide an important check on the cool ISM masses that we
have estimated from the thermal dust emission
