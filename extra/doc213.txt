Abstract
We describe the evolution of galaxies in a chemically consistent way accounting for the
increasing initial metallicity of successive generations of stars The enrichment of various
types of model galaxies is compared with Damped Ly  DLA abundances over the
redshift range from z  0 through z  44 We discuss properties and composition of the
galaxy population giving rise to DLA absorption Beyond evolution of individual galaxies
a change is found in the composition of DLA galaxy samples from high to low redshift
Spectrophotometric properties are predicted for optical identications of DLA galaxies
Introduction Models and Input Physics
Over the last few years evidence for broad metallicity distributions in galaxies has been accu-
mulating as well as for the importance of subsolar abundances for late-type spirals dwarf and
LSB galaxies in the local Universe and even more so during early evolution Our chemically
consistent evolutionary synthesis approach attempts to account for the increasing metallicity of
successive stellar generations We keep track of the enrichment history of the ISM and follow
successive generations of stars by using stellar evolutionary tracks element yields lifetimes
spectra etc for a range of metallicities Z from 104 to 005 Galaxies of various spectral types
are described by appropriate star formation histories SFHs For Sa Sb and Sc spirals we
use SFRs that are linear functions of the evolving gas-to-total-mass ratios with characteristic
timescales for SF t  dened via R t
e G  increasing from 2 Gyr Sa to 10 Gyr
Sc For Sd spirals we use a const SFR Being very simplied 1  zone descriptions without
any dynamics included our models are meant to describe the evolution of global quantities like
integrated luminosities and colours and average ISM abundances

Our rst set of chemically consistent hereafter cc models were presented for the photo-
metric evolution by Einsel et al 1995 The cc models were then extended to cover the spectral
evolution of nearby galaxies in Moller et al 1997 In Lindner et al 1999 we present the chemical
evolution aspects of our unied cc chemical and spectrophotometric evolutionary models and
compare  for a standard cosmology  the redshift evolution of model ISM abundances with data
on DLAs In Moller et al in prep we will present cc spectro-cosmological evolution models
and compare to high-redshift galaxy observations Here we discuss our chemo-cosmological
evolution models in comparison with DLA abundances over the redshift range z  04 to z  4
draw conclusions as to the nature of the DLA galaxy population and its redshift evolution and
use the spectro-cosmological aspects of our cc models to predict optical and NIR properties of
DLA galaxies
We use 5 dierent databases of input physics for 5 metallicities Z  104 through Z  005
Model atmosphere spectra are from Lejeune et al 1997 1998 stellar evolutionary tracks and
lifetimes are from the Padova group remnant masses and stellar yields for elements H He C
N O Ne Mg Al Si S Cr Mn Fe Ni Zn  from van den Hoek  Groenewegen 1997 for
stars with m  8M and from Woosley  Weaver 1995 for stars  8M SNIa contributions
from carbon deagration white dwarf binaries are included as prescribed by Matteucci see
Lindner et al 1999 for details We start with the lowest metallicity form stars continuously
according to the SF laws above and follow the evolution of the stars in the HRD as well as
their gas and heavy element production with stellar tracks and yields for the lowest metallicity
Once the ISM abundance reaches a certain threshold stars formed thereafter are described with
a set of input physics for the next higher metallicity and so on
Basic parameters of this kind of evolutionary synthesis models are the SFH and the IMF For
any cosmological model characterised by the parameters Ho o o and an assumed redshift
of galaxy formation zform the ISM abundance evolution as a function of time directly transforms
into a redshift evolution For the spectro-cosmological evolution of apparant magnitudes and
colours cc cosmological and evolutionary corrections and attenuation by intergalactic hydrogen
are taken into account The SFHs are chosen as to provide agreement  for a Scalo IMF  of the
models after a Hubbble time with observed integrated average colours of nearby galaxies RC3
template spectra Kennicutt 1992 and characteristic HII region abundances as observed at
r  1Re Oey  Kennicutt 1993 Zaritsky et al 1994 Ferguson et al 1998 for the respective
galaxy types While 1 Re seems a reasonable radius at which to compare HII region abundances
with our global galaxy models Phillipps  Edmunds 1996 argue that this is also the most
probable radius for an arbitrary QSO line of sight to cut through an intervening disk when
producing damped Ly absorption
2 DLA Abundances and Absorber Properties
Results and Discussion
Abundances of elements in DLAs habe been measured from weak non-saturated low ionisation
lines which do not require ionisation corrections for quite a while However only since the
velocity structure of these lines can be fully resolved in HIRES spectra precise abundances
can be determined As summarised by Pettini this volume these high-quality data are now
becoming available for many elements in a large number of DLAs all over the redshift range
from z  4 down to z  0 Since DLA systems are not biased to high luminosity SFR or radio
power  they just happen to lie in front of a more distant QSO  chemical information about
normal gas-rich galaxies is available now over a look-back time of  90 of the Hubble time
much larger than the range accessible to spectrophotometric observations Only a weak trend
is seen in the redshift evolution of DLA abundances with a large intrinsic scatter in particular
towaards higher redshifts
From the high column densities logNHI  205 a at geometry from statistical analyses
and the extent perpendicular to the line of sight as seen for DLAs in the spectra of 2 QSOs close
to each other as projected on the sky as well as from kinematic signatures in the Ly prole
shapes Prochaska  Wolfe 1997 masses of 1010  1011 M are estimated for DLAs Their
cumulative comoving gas densities at z  2  3 roughly equal the local comoving densities of
stars  gas in spirals This lead to the paradigm that DLAs are the progenitors of present-
day spirals eg Wolfe 1995 Recently however an origin of DLA absorption in starbursting
dwarfs Vladilo 1998 or LSB galaxies Jimenez et al 1999 is also discussed as well as an
origin in subgalactic fragments bound to merge for the highest-z systems Haehnelt et al
1998 Attempts to optically identify DLA absorber have been remarkably unsuccessful and
yielded a confusing plenitude of morphologies at low-z Thus the question as to the galaxy
population giving rise to DLA absorption at various redshifts seems still open
We were surprised to see that without any adjustment or scaling our spiral models with
SFHs that successfully reproduce local galaxies in terms of spectrophotometric and chemical
properties and the spectral properties of high-z galaxies provide fairly good agreement with the
abundance evolution of DLAs over the entire redshift range For all elements with a reasonable
number of DLA abundance data and over the entire redshift range our Sa and Sd models
bracket the data from the high and low metallicity side respectively We conclude that from
the point of view of abundance evolution DLAs may well be the progenitors of
normal spiral galaxies Our models bridge the gap from high-z DLA to local HII region
abundances The weak redshift evolution of DLA abundances is a natural consequence of the
long SF timescales well established for disk galaxies the scatter in the data at any redshift is
fully accounted for by the range of SF timescales from early to late type spirals see Lindner et
al 1999 While clearly our assumption of a single value for the redshift of galaxy formation
is a poor approximation to a realistic extended period of galaxy formation its value does not
aect our conclusions as long as there are galaxies forming before z  4
The comparison of model enrichment with DLA data further suggests that while at high
redshift all kinds of spirals from Sa through Sd seem to give rise to DLA absorption this changes
towards low redshifts Our Sa  Sc models reach metallicities higher than any DLA observation
as their gas-to-total-mass ratios drop below  50  including HI beyond the optical disks We
conclude that DLA galaxy samples at low redshift should be biased against early type spirals 1
because of their low gas content and 2 because of their high dust content ensuing from their
high metallicity Indeed DLA systems are observed to show systematically lower NHI at low-z
than at high-z Lanzetta et al 1997 While a bias against high metallicity absorbers has been
discussed by several authors as a consequence of the ensuing dust absorption that removes
the QSO from magnitude limited samples eg Steidel et al 1997 our models indicate an
additional reason the rise in metallicity goes with a decrease in gas content and
reduces the probability for a QSO sightline to cut through a high enough column
density region for DLA absorption
The change with redshift that we nd in the DLA galaxy population has important conse-
quences for the spectrophotometric properties expected for the DLA absorbing galaxies Early
type spirals being intrinsically brighter locally by  2 mag on average in B than late type
spirals our cc spectro-cosmological models predict that their absence from low-z DLA samples
will make it as dicult to detect low-z DLA galaxies as it is for high-z DLA absorbers In all
three bands B R and K the intrinsically brighter Sas among the DLAs at z  2  3 have
about the same apparent magnitudes as the intrinsically fainter Sds that make up the low-z
DLA population We predict hBi  24  255 h Ri  24  245 hKi  214  22 both for late
type spirals at z  05 and for early type spirals at z  2  3
In Fig1 we present the B-band redshift evolution of our cc spectro-cosmological models to-
gether with a sample of Lyman break galaxies and a few optically identied DLA absorbers The
Lyman break galaxies as well as the optically identied DLA galaxies and candidates agree with
our early to intermediate type spiral models The two DLA candidates at z  044 and 063
indeed show a bright spiral morphology Boisse et al 1998 Note that while chemical abun-
dance determinations do not select bright galaxies the optical identications do Very deep
imaging and spectroscopy both with HST and from the ground should reveal the nature of the
