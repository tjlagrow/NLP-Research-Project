Abstract This series of papers is intended to evaluate astrocladistics in reconstructing phylogenies of galaxies The objective
of this second paper is to formalize the concept of galaxy formation and to identify the processes of diversication We show
that galaxy diversity can be expected to organize itself in a hierarchy In order to better understand the role of mergers we have
selected a sample of 43 galaxies from the GALICS database built from simulations with a hybrid model for galaxy formation
studies These simulated galaxies described by 119 characters and considered as representing still undened classes have
experienced dierent numbers of merger events during evolution Our cladistic analysis yields a robust tree that proves the
existence of a hierarchy Mergers like interactions not taken into account in the GALICS simulations are probably a strong
driver for galaxy diversication Our result shows that mergers participate in a branching type of evolution but do not seem to
play the role of an evolutionary clock

1 Introduction
When Hubble discovered the true nature of galaxies in 1922 Hubble 1922 galaxy diversity was limited to morphological dif-
ferences and four types were enough to describe these new objects Nowadays galaxies are known to be complex and diversity
is exposed through characteristics of numerous observable parameters Physics and chemistry of the basic constituents stars
gas and dust see Paper I and their interactions have been observed and modelled Vilchez Stasinska and Perez 2001 Sauvage
Stasinska and Schaerer 2002 Hensler Stasinska Harfst Kroupa and Theis 2003 The traditional ever revised Hubble clas-
sication Hubble 1926 Hubble 1936 de Vaucouleurs 1959 Sandage 1961 Roberts  Haynes 1994 van den Bergh 1998 is
no longer suited to encompass all this variety notably at high redshifts where galaxies do not look like those in our neighbour-
hood eg van den Bergh 1998 In addition numerical simulations somewhat enlighten the interplay between all constituents of
galaxies and some of their behaviour with time Hatton Devriendt Ninin Bouchet and Guiderdoni 2003 Bournaud  Combes
and Jog 2004 Menci Cavaliere Fontana Giallongo Poli and Vittorini 2004 However because of galaxy complexity they are
necessarily incomplete in particular concerning morphological aspects so that the inadequate classication makes a comparison
between simulated and true samples dicult
In 1936 Hubble imagined that galaxies should evolve Hubble 1936 In this way he explained the origin of spiral galaxies
as being relaxed ellipticals While galaxy evolution is now universally recognized historical scenarios as well as formation
and nature of the very rst objects are far from being established eg Bromm Ferrara Coppi and Larson 2003 Bromm and
Loeb 2003 Schneider Ferrara Natarajan and Omukai 2002 It is often understood that the formation of a galaxy deals only
with its rst appearing in the Universe as an entity and that afterwards it evolves with more major or less major modications
We believe that this denition of formation is not adapted to a diversity generated in the course of evolution This concept should
be formalized more clearly when dealing with phylogeny species evolution of galaxies see Sect 22
To address these two questions classication and formation  evolution Fraix-Burnet Choler and Douzery 2003 proposed
to use cladistics a methodology borrowed from evolutionary biology see also Fraix-Burnet 2004 In the present two companion
papers we detail the fundamentals of astrocladistics The rst paper Paper I concentrates on the applicability of cladistics to
objects like galaxies emphasizing also the practical course of the analysis Readers are referred to this paper for principles and
more details of cladistics The present second paper is devoted to a conceptualization of the formation and evolution of galaxies
as a whole that is required to understand the organization of their diversity We also analyse a sample of simulated galaxies in
order to study the specic role of mergers
In this paper as in Paper I we use the word class in a generic manner and avoid the word type because it is inevitably
linked to a Hubble morphological classication We also make the one object  one class assumption which means that an
individual galaxy of the simulation is supposed to be generic for a class This has the advantage of more generality because even
though with our sample of simulated galaxies we are able to identify the fate of a galaxy at dierent epochs this is not possible
with real objects Like in Paper I we do not yet specify any distinction between class and species for galaxies
In Sect 2 we present some general concepts of evolution and detail the formation and diversication processes for galaxies
The selection of the sample of simulated galaxies is described in Sect 3 and the analysis inputs are listed in Sect 4 Results are
presented in Sect 5 while a discussion can be found in Sect 6 The conclusions are given in Sect 7
2 Formation diversication and hierarchy
21 Descentwithmodication
The hierarchical organization of the diversity of living organisms is an empirical result found already at the time of Aristotle
and thoroughly established in the 18th century when the - now universal - Linne nomenclature came into use Knapp 2000
Paper I Darwin 1859 in his theory of evolution explained this tree-like structure by a descent with modication process
each organism transmits its characteristics to a descendant with or without modication Descent explains pattern similarity
while modication explains pattern dierences Because these modications can be numerous for such complex systems a given
species generally evolves into several new species This is called branching evolution and cladistics is designed to nd such
hierarchies Hennig 1965 Wiley Siegel-Causey Brooks and Funk 1991 see Paper I
In the biological world another component of evolution tends to alter the tree-like structure In some cases genes are directly
transmitted from one organism to another creating a hybrid organism with characteristic patterns of both original species This
is called reticulated evolution because on a tree it would appear as a junction between two dierent branches eg Woese 2000
Legendre 2000 When branching evolution is dominant reticulated evolution brings some noise in the cladistic analysis and
hybridization events can be identied The situation is more dicult when the reverse is true as seems to be the case for bacterial
evolution Doolittle 1999
It is important to point out that classication here does not concern individual objects but species Wiley et al 1991 A
chimpanzee does not evolve into a human but both species have a common ancestral species often simply called ancestor In
biology a given species slowly evolves through many generations of individuals Dierences are tiny at each generation but after
a while new individuals depart signicantly enough for a new species to be dened The notion of species is not unique and is not
dened only by interbreeding see Brower 2000 and some references therein For instance it can be dened from cladograms

that is from trees produced by a cladistic analysis in which case it is coined a clade As explained in Paper I objects thus
grouped share a common ancestor which has transmitted its evolved derived characteristics innovations of evolution
In astrophysics as will be seen in Sect 23 the evolutionary process is much more spectacular The term progenitor galaxies
often used means in reality progenitor class to a given class of galaxies This point very important for astrocladistics is also
discussed and illustrated in Paper I and formalized further in Sect22
22 Formationofgalaxies
It is often implicitly admitted that a galaxy forms at an early epoch of the Universe and evolves to the present time eg
Steidel 1999 In other words formation and evolution are disconnected However we are interested in understanding how
galaxies happen to be as we see them that is how they formed themselves into the way they are in our data As already mentioned
we are concerned with the class a given galaxy represents rather than with the individual by itself Hence any process aecting
some properties of a galaxy is a formation process In this sense formation is to be understood as formation of a given class of
galaxies Five processes that change galaxy characteristics can be identied
1 Even though the nature of the very rst objects is still under debate eg Bromm et al 2003 Bromm  Loeb 2003 Schneider
et al 2002 some basic constituents stars gas and dust see Paper I assembled themselves in a self-gravitational entity
called a galaxy This simple scheme renders possible the appearing of a new galaxy at any epoch of the Universe
2 Galaxies live in an environment made up of gas and a gravitational eld shaped by dark matter and other galaxies However
for a given period a galaxy can be isolated or located in a stable environment Yet as shown in Paper I its basic constituents
mainly stars gas and dust evolve hence the galaxy evolves For instance if a sucient number of supernovae explode
the global metallicity of the intragalactic gas is increased so that a new class of galaxies could be dened Even though this
secular evolution is less spectacular than the four other ones it is undoubtedly a formation process as well In Paper I it is
shown that secular evolution alone yields diversity organized in a hierarchy
3 Interactions between galaxies or between a galaxy and any gravitational perturbation are probably very frequent and gener-
ally very violent eg Menci et al 2004 Internal kinematics is necessarily aected triggering starbursts chemical reactions
in the gas and dust structural and morphological changes nuclear activity feeding of black holes and so on After an in-
teraction a galaxy is certainly dierent belonging to a new class so that interactions are a formation process and a strong
driver of diversity
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution II
4 Sometimes the consequence of an interaction is merging For instance in the case of the merging of two spiral galaxies with
comparable masses giving birth to an elliptical galaxy two galaxies obviously disappear and a new one very dierent is born
Such major merger events clearly constitute a formation process If the masses are very dierent we could consider that only
the small galaxy has disappeared eaten or accreted by the bigger one But still the latter is modied at least its mass has
increased but other characteristics are probably modied as well and could lead to the denition of a new class of galaxies
These minor mergers can be viewed as accretion like that of intracluster gas or whatever We consider the accretion-merging
formation process globally and discuss it in more detail in Sect 24
5 Ejection or sweeping of material from a galaxy is just the opposite phenomenon to accretion-merging less violent in general
however and is similarly a formation process
These ve formation processes assembling secular evolution interaction accretion-merging ejection-sweeping are depicted
in Fig 1 This makes it clear that galaxies are always formed from material coming from other galaxies or from the intergalactic
medium In all cases the building blocks have their own history they have evolved themselves Formation necessarily includes
evolution even in the extragalactic world Stellar astrophysicists are used to this kind of transmission to a new generation or to a
new class of objects There are several populations of stars the more recent containing more metals being made up of material
processed in stars of the previous population and ejected in the interstellar medium In the case of galaxies this mechanism is
reminiscent of the descent with modication of the Darwinian evolution basic constituents of galaxies are transmitted and
modied through the ve formation processes to a newly formed descendant
23 Diversicationofgalaxies
After a galaxy of a given class appears it is aected by one of the processes stipulated above then yields a descendant that
belongs to a new or the same class This is very dierent from species evolution in biology as already said in Sect 21 because
this happens only very gradually after a large number of generations However very rarely some individual living organisms
have to give birth to descendants of a dierent species For galaxies an individual can be so much transformed by processes
identied in Sect 22 that a new galaxy belonging to a dierent class is formed The diversication cycle is then at work see
Fig 1 The goal of a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution like astrocladistics is to classify galaxies according to their
history of formation processes An observed galaxy is the result of several formation events and the analysis should later be able
to establish whether the order in which of they have occurred matters or not
It is important not to be confused between number of classes diversication and number of galaxies Even if gravity tends
to diminish the total number of galaxies through mergers diversication ie number of dierent classes of objects increases
because galaxies are complex objects four perfectly identical galaxies merging by pairs will yield two objects certainly dierent
from each other and from the original ones Even if at the very last we end up with one object it will characterize a new class
making altogether four classes in this simple example Hence diversication still occurs even if the Universe should nish in a
Big Crunch but this does not seem to be the case Benoit et al 2003 Spergel et al 2003
One necessary condition for diversication to occur in a descent with modication scheme is that the number of generated
species be sucient This is probably not the case for stars But among the galaxy formation processes identied above assem-
bling is the rarest of all appearing only once for any full lineage of galaxies Its time scale can thus be set at the Hubble time tH
which is the age of the Universe currently estimated at 137 109 years eg Spergel et al 2003 Modications through secular
evolution are permanent but those implying class changes can probably be estimated to occur at the rate tH nse where nse  2
to 3 This means that if a galaxy and its descendants remain isolated during the age of the Universe they could globally belong
to 2 or 3 dierent classes Interactions are clearly the most frequent events in the lives of galaxies being always plunged into the
gravitational eld which is shaped by other galaxies and dark matter A quite conservative value for its occurrence rate would be
something like tH nin with nin  10 to 50 Accretion-merging is slightly less frequent and from the GALICS simulations see
Sect 3 we estimate the rate at tH nac with nac  5 to 10 Ejection-sweeping is a rather rare event that can be attributed the same
rate as secular evolution tH ne j where ne j  2 to 3
Hence even if the above guesses are very approximative the number of transformations caused by all the formation processes
is certainly sucient for quite a few classes to appear Astrocladistic analyses will reveal whether they are organized in a hierarchy
or not
We must stress that the hierarchical organization of galaxy diversity considered in astrocladistics has nothing to do with the
hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation that deals solely with their mass distribution eg Hatton et al 2003 and is depicted
by an inverse tree a lot of small galaxies merging into a fewer big ones
24 Branchingevolutionandmergers
Except for merging all the processes described above Fig 1 obviously produce branching evolution leading to a hierarchical
organization of the diversity a given class gives birth to at least a new one When two galaxies of two dierent classes merge
a kind of hybrid object is produced by mixing together their basic constituents This could a priori parallel reticulated evolution
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution II
Sect 21 It is thus possible that the historical information could be lost or impossible to extract from observations However
since interactions are probably the dominant process of galaxy diversication mergers are expected to bring only some noise in
the cladistic analysis In addition major mergers mass ratio lower than 13 are rarer than minor ones which somehow can be
compared to accretion Finally major mergers are remarkable because they yield an elliptical galaxy from two spirals in numerical
simulations eg Barnes 1992 Bournaud et al 2004 This is based on morphological considerations only In reality the velocity
dispersion is dramatically increased forming a bulge from the disks and starbursts certainly appear as well Considering all
properties of galaxies these events might not look so catastrophic compared to other events particularly to interactions
Moreover galaxies are not living organisms and their constituents do not behave like genes In biological hybridization a
gene of one species replaces a gene of the other species For galaxies it is always a mixture of basic constituents
The conclusion is that mergers do not seem to be able to destroy a hierarchical organization of galaxy diversity and might
quite possibly participate in it We propose in the next sections to test this point by performing an astrocladistic analysis on a
sample of simulated galaxies with dierent numbers of merger events in their entire history If a tree is found then it will be
possible to check whether the number of mergers could be a kind of cosmological clock for galaxy evolution whether mergers
are the main diversication driver among the formation processes taken into account in the simulations ie assembling secular
evolution and accretion-merging
3 Selecting the sample
GALICS Galaxies In Cosmological Simulations is a hybrid model for hierarchical galaxy formation studies combining the
outputs of large cosmological N-body simulations with simple semi-analytic recipes to describe the fate of the baryons within
dark matter haloes Hatton et al 2003 Paper I As hot gas cools and falls to the centre of these haloes it settles in a rotationally
supported disc Galaxies remain disc structures unless mergers or instabilities occur in which case simple recipes are used
to develop a bulge and a burst components Hence a galaxy is described by these three components each one having its own
parameters of geometry dynamics masses stars and gas metallicity and photometry from the ultraviolet to the far infrared
Assembling rst appearing in the simulation as a minimum local overdensity secular evolution and accretion-merging are taken
into account Interactions between galaxies and ejection-sweeping phenomena are not considered
Each galaxy is identied by a specic number at each timestep of the simulation Each galaxy is the product of one or more
galaxies of the previous step and one or more evolutionary processes that occurred since the previous step The entire genealogy
of each galaxy is thus known The sample was selected among galaxies at the present epoch redshift0 of the simulation For
any given galaxy we counted the total number of merging events that lead to its formation since the birth of the very rst of its
ancestors We arbitrarily selected a number of galaxies with 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 and 10 mergers 5 galaxies each and with 15 20 and
22 mergers 1 galaxy each for a total of 43 galaxies We also noted the number of major mergers implying two galaxies with a
mass ratio larger than 13 In order to visualize quickly some correlations on the nal tree we named the galaxies as XXcYAAN
where XX is the total number of mergers Y the number of major events and AA stands for central CE satellite SA or eld
CH galaxies N merely identies galaxies having the same XX and AA
They are described by 119 parameters which we assumed to be evolutive characters Table 1 There are the total bolometric
luminosity and the total bolometric IR infrared ux Then for each of the three components of galaxies disc bulge and
burst there are some size mass and kinematic data but principally photometric values from the ultraviolet to the far infrared
Like in Paper I all magnitudes are relative to the K band this last value giving the relative heights of the spectra or relative
brightnesses between galaxies We replaced the size of the bulge bulge rgal with the ratio between sizes of bulge and disc
bulge rgaldisc rgal The dynamical time tdyn is the time taken for material at the half-mass radius to reach the opposite side of
the galaxy disk component or its centre bulge and burst components whereas the instantaneous star formation rate is derived
from this dynamical time the mass of the cold gas and a prescribed star formation eciency all taken at the last time substep of
the simulation Hatton et al 2003
Total magnitudes for the galaxies merely computed by adding intensities of the three components were not included in the
analysis They are certainly less precise to describe evolution of galaxies and might introduce some redundancy that is some
articial overweighting of some characters However they can be projected onto the nal cladograms for interpretation purposes

41 Thematrix
Following results from Paper I spectral characters were included in the matrix as colour magnitudes with respect to the K band
for each component This band provides relative brightness between galaxies while colours indicate the evolutionary state for
physical and chemical constituents The original table is available on request
42 Codingofthematrix
The evolution of characters is described by 8 discrete states which are regular bins in colour magnitudes In case one magnitude
for a given character is undetermined value 99 in the initial matrix standing for null ux code 7 was attributed and the other
entries coded from 0 to 6 The coded matrix is presented in Table 2
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution II
43 Additionalconstraints
An ordered Wagner evolution was imposed on the characters so that they are supposed to evolve smoothly with time changes
between two adjacent states are more parsimonious than between distant ones This assumption is physically plausible and we
found that it signicantly improves the robustness of the nal tree
44 Outgroup
The choice of an outgroup is required to root the cladogram or to orientate the arrow of time However this is always a dicult
question particularly when the phylogenesis of the group under study is not understood This is obviously the case for galaxies
because astrocladistic galaxy classication is still in its infancy
Nonetheless the absence of any identied outgroup does not prevent a phylogenetic analysis to be made because it still
provides invaluable results on relationships and groupings of objects from an evolution point of view In this paper we will try to
consider 01c0CH2 01c0CH3 01c0CH4 as a priori possible outgroups less diversied objects for the group under study since
they result from only one non-major merger Indeed this argument looks like an a priori hypothesis stating that merger events
are a dominant driver of diversication In view of Sect 21 this is still to be demonstrated and the present analysis does not
support this point Sect 5 Our choice is thus dictated by display purposes only
45 Heuristicquestforthebesttrees
We used the PAUP4b10 package Swoord 2003 on Linux PC computers to perform all calculations shown in this paper The
maximum parsimony criterion was chosen Since we do not know anything about evolutionary relationships of the objects of our
sample bootstrap values Paper I were optimized by removing object after object until we reach a satisfactory tree ie a tree
displaying highly supported nodes
46 Assessmentofthephylogeneticsignalinthedata
The robustness of the nal result was decided from bootstrap values and conrmed by decay Bremer indices see Paper I for
details
5 Results
51 Thebestcladogram
As already mentioned in Paper I burst characters are probably not very pertinent for evolution since they concern a temporary
component of galaxies Comparison runs showed us that results without them are more robust The high variability of burst
characters is conrmed on their projections on the nal cladogram not shown in this paper The analysis presented afterwards
is thus performed with the 80 remaining characters
The best tree was found after excluding 11 objects They must be considered as objects perturbing the cladogram probably
because they do not share common evolution patterns with the other ones We stopped the optimization process when we reached
a point where excluding one or two more objects or some more characters was not improving the bootstrap value for any node
We consider the result as highly signicant The cladogram with 32 objects and 80 ordered characters is shown in Fig 2 The 11
excluded objects are not found to build a group no robust tree
The outgroup see Sect 44 was chosen to be 01c0CH4 for a better visualization of the cladogram than with 01c0CH2
whereas 01c0CH3 belongs to the excluded objects This already shows that basing evolution diversication only on merger
events is not a valid approach
The analysis of the entire initial matrix revealed a partly resolved tree but this was poorly supported Even if the result shown
is obtained for 32 objects only it is still remarkable to nd such a cladogram well supported by excellent bootstrap and decay
values for an arbitrarily chosen sample of galaxies see a discussion in Paper I This really tells us that branching evolution
is the dominant diversication mechanism and that mergers do not destroy the tree-like organization at least in the GALICS
simulations
There might be a trend toward a correlation between diversication and number of mergers Among the 9 galaxies with no
major merger labelled c0 7 are grouped in the upper part of the cladogram 06c0CE2 and more noticeably 02c0CH4 being
at the opposite end the most diversied objects from 01c0CH4 In addition three galaxies 05c0CH1 08c0CE4 10c0CE4
in the upper part have a number of mergers signicantly higher than the other ones Except for these three objects there is a
regular increase of the total number of mergers downward on the cladogram but after 20c5CE a regular decrease occurs Objects
with more major mergers are also grouped together roughly in the middle of the cladogram But there is no regular increase

with evolution We conclude that even if mergers are a driver of diversication they are not the principal one and cannot be
considered as a reliable evolution clock
The two galaxies with the highest number of mergers and major mergers 15c7CE and 20c5CE are clearly grouped together
bootstrap of 100 obviously sharing similar histories as compared to all the other ones There seems to be a loose trend for
the number of major mergers to increase with the total number of mergers the corresponding galaxies becoming more central
objects There is a noticeable exception 22c1CE with only 1 major event for 22 mergers in total and which belongs to the
excluded objects
52 Evolutionofcharacters
In the previous section it was noticed that organization on the cladogram is not entirely due to merger processes So what causes
the hierarchy We present in Fig 3 and Fig 4 projections of four characters in colour codes with respect to the K band see
Table 1 They help understand unique properties of groups of galaxies It is found that there is a group of galaxies at the bottom
identied as A in Fig 2 characterized by very high values of near infrared and UV ultraviolet colours with respect to the K
band for the bulge component In addition their disc has also a very high colour value in the near infrared Finally the cold gas
mass of the disc is decreasing regularly from the top toward the bottom of the cladogram as shown with a group B on Fig 2
having high masses
These properties alone explain the organization found for this sample The other characters generally behave somewhat more
erratically in this picture With this information it is possible to understand the events that create such character evolutions hence
galaxy diversity by relating the observable to the basic constituents stars gas and dust This is beyond the scope of this work
and is reserved for further and more complete studies of GALICS galaxies as well of course of real ones
6 Discussion
The cladogram presented in the previous section is a synthetic way to visualize a set of data and hypotheses Results should be
discussed in view of these inputs Concerning the choice of the objects as already noticed it is remarkable to nd a well resolved
tree with 32 galaxies while the total sample 43 has been arbitrarily selected among thousands of possible candidates This
means that the majority of our sample object classes have a common ancestor ancestral species Their very rst progenitors
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution II
born at dierent times and places in the Universe were made up with material of comparable histories and underwent similar
physical processes Thus the Universe was not very inhomogeneous but one should remember that this is a simulated Universe
To obtain a very robust tree 11 objects have been excluded Several explanations can be invoked These galaxies can be too
distant in the evolution too much diversied for any valuable relationships with the other to be discovered More characters
could be needed to establish the global phylogeny It is possible also that there are some true hybrid specimens that cannot easily
t in a cladogram with the others Clearly more galaxies should be studied and further work is necessary before understanding
these objects in view of phylogenetic classes still to be dened
Individual galaxies are representative of classes This is a one-galaxy one-class assumption which should be checked if two
galaxies are very similar in their coded characters they could dene a class Quantitative values have been divided into 8 bins
to build the coded matrix Nevertheless it is possible to reduce this number in order to avoid over-resolution and allow for
some initial groupings In our case this gave worse results without revealing galaxies with similar sets of coded characters As
presented in Paper I comparing two objects in evolution can be done in several ways Cladistic analysis is one way but it denes
classes a posteriori using cladograms and not a priori This is a step by step process and a long term goal of astrocladistics
For better objectivity of the methodology of classication see Paper I all available observables should be a priori included
The cladistic analysis reveals their pertinence and their behaviour regarding evolution The fundamental point is that the decision
of excluding some characters is to be made afterwards based on objective and transparent arguments provided by the analysis
itself associated statistical tools and interpretation of the cladogram In our case including burst characters clearly hampered the
convergence toward a robust tree Projections on the cladograms unambiguously show their high variability with time gures

The hierarchical organization is mainly explained by infrared properties Sect 52 This has naturally a strong impact on
our understanding of the physics of the galaxy evolution and diversity since infrared radiation mainly indicates temperature
of the dust This could also be partly caused by redundancy of this information in the matrix But how can we be sure not
to articially weight characters and thus inuence important evolution indicators A way around this diculty would be to
compare cladograms obtained with dierent weight hypotheses and check the overall astrophysical consistency of the resulting
interpretations We reserve such an analysis for further studies with larger samples within GALICS It is important to realize
that a cladogram is never denitive For instance future discoveries will bring new information in the initial matrix and the
cladogram will change accordingly see Paper I
The GALICS simulations do not take interactions and ejection-sweeping into account Our results show that diversication
occurs in a hierarchical way and mergers obviously play a role Because they do not seem to constitute an evolutionary clock
they are not the dominant process for galaxy evolution so that mergers accretion secular evolution and also assembling compete
for diversication
The astrophysical goals of this paper were twofold the formalization of formation and diversication processes and the role
of mergers in branching evolution The rst point can now be employed in astrocladistic analyses of real galaxies The second can
only be addressed by simulated samples as we did Future simulations including interactions between galaxies and kinematic
information will be invaluable for making precise estimations of the respective importance of the ve formation processes
identied in this paper by comparing phylogenetic analyses of both simulated and real samples
Can we apply astrocladistics to real galaxies Our works in Paper I and here demonstrate that there are absolutely no obstacles
characters used are real observables Indeed this has already been undertaken for samples of Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group
and of Virgo galaxies see Fraix-Burnet 2004 for an overview The more characters we have the more robust and the larger
the galaxy tree is This series of papers on simulated galaxies show that photometric characters are well suited For real galaxies
other parameters are available as well particularly on chemical composition and kinematics This last category of observables
is particularly important because it is a potential tracer of past interactions and mergers In addition the apparent morphology
of galaxies a subjective and qualitative character used in the Hubble classication is essentially caused by and included in
kinematic properties which are objective and quantitative descriptors
7 Conclusions
Astrocladistics relies on two basic requirements presented in Paper I and this paper galaxies and their evolution are dened and
described by their basic constituents stars gas and dust diversication is due to branching evolution The success of an analysis
is judged from objective statistical methods and from the astrophysical interpretation of the cladogram
The analysis of a sample of simulated galaxies shows that mergers do not destroy the hierarchical organization of diversity
This is because it is not such a dierent event from accretion except for its violence The basic constituents are mixed together
and not replaced Mergers thus cannot be paralleled by hybridization leading to reticulated evolution in biology In conclusion
the ve galaxy formation processes identied in this paper participate in a branching evolution
It is dicult to draw general conclusions on the phylogeny of galaxies from the analysis presented in this paper and it was
not its objective Interactions between galaxies are not taken into account in the GALICS simulation This formation process is
certainly the most frequent one and being in general very violent it is expected to be one of the main drivers of diversication
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution II
A lot more studies are possible with the GALICS database particularly to help understand how diversity occurs in such
simulations It is also an invaluable tool to learn more on astrocladistic methodology and interpretation of its results Finally it
helps in handling samples of real galaxies for which we have no historical information and possibly less available characters
In both papers of this series the results unambiguously validate the approach Ongoing positive results on Dwarfs Galaxies of
the Local Group and Virgo galaxies Fraix-Burnet 2004 show that this conclusion is not limited to simulated galaxies The
nal game is here beyond a necessary new taxonomic classication is the establishment of the tree of galaxies Many more
astrocladistic studies are required as well as gathering as many observational galaxy descriptors as possible
Current and future big surveys like Sloan Digital Sky Survey Vimos VLT Deep Survey Great Observatories Origins
Deep Survey  collecting photometric and spectroscopic data on huge samples of galaxies at all redshifts seem particularly
well suited for astrocladistics Such large data sources will be integrated within the international Virtual Observatory project
httpwwwivoanet that will provide large numbers of characters for large samples of diversied galaxies
It is also true that even if somewhat like in biology the environment plays a crucial role in galaxy evolution accretions
interactions and mergers galaxies set new conditions for cladists continuous data comprising error bars and upperlower limits
violent generation of species huge amount of objects for not that many characters instantaneous galaxy diversity that might
decrease because of gravity leading to fewer and fewer objects In addition the detailed evolutionary physical and chemical
processes are basically understood and objects of the past high redshift galaxies will be observed with future giant telescopes
at the same detail as present day galaxies
