ABSTRACT
We present a model-independent method of quantifying galaxy evolution in
high-resolution images which we apply to the Hubble Deep Field HDF Our
procedure is to k-correct all pixels belonging to the images of a complete set of
bright galaxies and then to replicate each galaxy image to higher redshift by
the product of its space density 1Vmax and the cosmological volume The set
of bright galaxies is itself selected from the HDF because presently the HDF
provides the highest quality UV images of a redshift-complete sample of galaxies
31 galaxies with I  219 z  05 and for which V Vmax is spread fairly
These galaxies are bright enough to permit accurate pixel-by-pixel k-corrections
into the restframe UV  2000 A We match the shot noise spatial sampling
and PSF smoothing of the HDF data resulting in entirely empirical and
parameter-free no-evolution deep elds of galaxies for direct comparison with
the HDF In addition the overcounting rate and the level of incompleteness can
be accurately quantied by this procedure We obtain the following results
Faint HDF galaxies I  24 are much smaller more numerous and less regular
than our no-evolution extrapolation for any interesting geometry A higher
proportion of HDF galaxies dropout in both U and B indicating that some
galaxies were brighter at higher redshifts than our cloned z  05 population

Introduction
Amongst the highest quality data available for exploring galaxy evolution are the long
exposures of the Hubble Deep Field Williams et al 1996 which register the faintest
and sharpest images of galaxies ever detected The counts of faint galaxies are found to
increase to the completeness limit I  28 roughly doubling in number per magnitude
d logNdm  02  03 Williams et al 1996 see Tables 9-10 in all bands This trend
is accompanied by a marked decline in angular size so that most faint galaxies are barely
resolved While much of this light must arise from the epoch when galaxies and stars
were rst forming the photometric limit of the HDF far exceeds the practical limit of
spectroscopy some 97 of the HDF galaxies do not have measured redshifts hence
for the foreseeable future interpretation of these images rests principally on photometric
information
A major impediment in analysing the HDF images is our ignorance of the ultraviolet
UV properties of ordinary galaxies since at high redshift it is the restframe UV light that
is detected in the optical bands Despite the rather modest UV performance of imaging
satellites it has become apparent that the appearance of even ordinary Hubble-sequence
galaxies is knotty and irregular in the UV governed by the spatial distribution of high
contrast star-forming regions OConnell  Markum 1996 Giavalisco et al 1996a Hence
it is unclear to what extent the large numbers of blue and irregular looking objects reported
in HST images Glazebrook et al 1995 Driver Windhorst  Griths 1995 Abraham et
al 1996b Colley et al 1997 simply result from redshifted UV light rather than evolution
There have been several eorts to obtain images of representative nearby galaxies
The FOCA balloon experiment at 2000 A has measured six UV images of local galaxies
Blecha et al 1990 the astro-1 astro-2 mission measured 27 45 UV images of objects
using the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope Stecher et al 1992 and Maoz et al 1997 have
recently compiled UV images of 110 galaxies using the FOC on HST 2300A Cognizant
of the importance of these UV images for assessing galaxy evolution researchers Bohlin et
al 1991 Giavalisco et al 1996a Maoz 1997 have already used these data to comment on
deep HST images While these studies have been very illustrative the samples are either
incomplete or register only the inner regions of galaxies so that a quantication of galaxy
evolution in deep HST images has hitherto not been attempted
Due to the inadequacies of UV instrumentation it is interesting to note that even the
gross eect of the Lyman-limit is more easily observed in the optical by virtue of the high
redshifts of some faint galaxies Steidel et al 1996a The restframe UV morphologies of
several tens of these high redshift galaxies are measured directly with HST particularly in
the Hubble Deep Field Steidel et al 1996b Giavalisco et al 1996b Lowenthal et al 1997

down to the Lyman limit These galaxies lie in the range z  20  35 and are reported
to have a generally compact appearance but many have faint plumes and some are up to
3 in length object C4-06 of Steidel et al 1996b The UV continuum ux places some
constraint on the luminosity density of star-forming galaxies at high-z Madau et al 1996
at least for galaxies blue enough to be dominated by the light of O-stars Comparison of the
implied high mass star-formation rate with local estimates from from H emission Gallego
et al 1995 provides an indirect means of estimating the evolution of the integrated
UV-luminosity density Madau et al 1996
In this paper we outline a simple and practical method for measuring evolution in deep
space images by constructing empirical no-evolution elds of galaxies as a benchmark
matched in image properties to the data in this case the HDF Our method has the distinct
advantages of being purely empirical and entirely free of parameterizations so that our
conclusions are liberated from the usual caveats We rst establish the k-correction for
each pixel belonging to a given galaxy image drawn from a complete sample of relatively
bright galaxies with redshifts selected from the HDF We then scale the numbers of these
k-corrected galaxy images out to high redshift in proportion to the product of the volume
and the space density of each galaxy the latter being set by its value of 1Vmax Finally
we correct the PSF add the appropriate noise and sampling of the HDF observations and
compare these no-evolution elds with the HDF at fainter magnitudes I  24 This
approach is feasible due to the relatively high quality F 300W images of the brighter galaxies
detected in the HDF I  22 as well as the many subsequent redshift measurements of
HDF galaxies with the Keck Telescope Cohen et al 1996 Lowenthal et al 1997 Together
these observations allow us to construct a statistically useful complete sample of 31 galaxies
with sucient UV-optical coverage for construction of an entirely empirical and parameter
free no-evolution deep eld for comparison with the HDF The universal geometry is the
only unknown dictating the volume and angle-redshift relations and bearing somewhat on
the degree of evolution derived in the I band
By following this procedure we make no recourse to the usual parameterizations of
morphological or colour classes galaxy luminosity functions and light proles Implicitly
such parameterizations have tended to assume one-parameter relationships particularly
between morphological type and spectral type reducing the inherent richness of the general
galaxy population and potentially introducing articial model dependencies In light of
this it is not very surprising that simulations of two-dimensional images look articial
appearing more hygienic than reality and hence of limited value in reliably quantifying
evolution Designating a morphological class has in itself proven to be problematic for
well-resolved galaxies Naim et al 1995 for example have found from a comparison of the
classication of six human experts that classication exhibits a variance of 2 morphological
 4 
types relative to one another Hence there is still no clear way to map an observed image
onto a given morphological type or to produce a realistic image given a morphological type
Finally we emphasize that our procedure is free of the many internal selection biases
which have long haunted low-redshift to high-redshift comparisons eg where deep CCD
data have lower surface brightness thresholds than photographic surveys used to construct
the local luminosity functions
We begin this paper by describing the manner in which we select our bright galaxy
sample in 2 In 3 we discuss our empirical procedure for deriving pixel-by-pixel spectral
energy distributions and number densities for each of these bright galaxies In 4 we assess
both the fairness of our sample and the viability of the method by making some simple
predictions chiey with regard to the Canada France Redshift Survey CFRS Lilly et al
1995 In 5 we describe the simulation procedure in detail and in 6 we describe our
analysis of the simulations and the HDF data using SExtractor In 7 we present our
results in 8 we discuss these results and in 9 we present a summary
We adopt H0  50 kmsMpc and express all magnitudes in this paper in the AB1
magnitude system dened in terms of a at spectrum in frequency Also to associate the
HDF bands with their more familiar optical counterparts we shall refer to the F 814W 
F 606W  F 450W  and F 300W bands as I814 V606 B450 and U300 respectively throughout
this paper
2 Bright Galaxy Sample
We select our sample of bright galaxies from the HDF First we measure the photometry
of all galaxies detected in the HDF by applying the SExtractor photometry package 12b5
Bertin  Arnouts 1996 to the publicly released version 2 images of the HDF In using
SExtractor we require objects to be at least 2  above the sky noise in the I814 image
over an area of at least 10 contiguous pixels after rst mildly smoothing the images by
a Gaussian of width 006-arcsec sigma the approximate width of the PSF We take the
deblending parameter DEBLEND MINCONT  to be 004 which we found to be a
good compromise between splitting too many faint objects apart and merging too many
dierent objects together For photometry we use isophotal magnitudes MAG BEST 
corrected with a Gaussian extrapolation to approximate the light beyond the isophotes for
all non-crowded almost all objects where we take our isophotes to be equal to 2  times

the sky noise  249 magarcsec2 Objects with half-light radii less than 015 arcsec are
excluded as stars 5 objects with I814AB  2233 Only objects on the three Wide Field
Camera chips lying within 4 arcsecs of the edges are included beyond which the image
quality is diminished
We match up our resulting photometric catalogues redshifts measured by various
groups Cohen et al 1996 Lowenthal et al 1997 to construct a strictly magnitude-limited
subset bright enough to be highly complete in redshift We settle for a conservative limit of
I814AB  2233 which contains 32 objects in total  only one of which is without a redshift
and for which we know of no attempt to measure a redshift nor any reason to suppose that
its measurement would prove dicult Consequently we shall assume that the 31 objects
with redshifts are representative and simply scale volume densities by 3231 As more
redshifts become available this analysis can be extended although clearly the limited area
of the HDF means that new elds are required in order to signicantly enlarge the bright
galaxy sample and to help average over the possible eects of clustering
2r2
The resultant bright sample is listed in Table 1 along with our determination of
its coordinates I814 magnitude absolute magnitude surface brightness taken to be
hl where mbJ is the rest-frame bJ apparent magnitude and rhl is the half-light
radius our eye-ball determination of the morphological type and the known redshift For
reference we also include our determination of the k-correction over the surface of each
galaxy at z  25 The calculation of k-corrections rest-frame absolute magnitudes and
rest-frame surface brightnesses are described below In addition the redshift distribution
of our bright subset is shown in Figure 1 for comparison with all of the redshifts measured
in the compilation by Cohen et al 1996 which includes the HDF and its anking elds
We display the images of the bright sample in Figures 2a and Figure 2b as a set of colour
images B450 V606 and I814 bands as they appear if k-corrected to the mean bright sample
redshift z  05 and also to z  25 using the pixel-by-pixel k-corrections described in the
next section
3 Representation of Each Sample Galaxy
31 The Light
We treat our bright galaxies as two-dimensional pixelated light-emitting surfaces for
the purpose of k-correction avoiding the unnecessary step of parameterizing their light
proles We do not attempt to alter the inclination of each galaxy in the simulations with
the attendant problems regarding extinction this would entail since by default our sample
 6 
already contains galaxies of all orientations
The question arises as to the best method of k-correction when the redshift extends
to wavelengths short enough that no UV information is available The spectrum of any
given pixel is only sampled by 4 broad passbands and no information exists shortward of
2000 A in the restframe of the typical bright galaxy for which z  05 allowing a reliable
k-correction to z  3 in the longest wavelength band I814 In order to extend this work
to higher redshift and in order to implement a smooth interpolation between the four
passbands we adopt empirical template spectra To indicate the robustness of the results to
the choice of templates we compare simulations for two independent sets of templates one
based on the small but large aperture UV sample of Coleman Wu  Weedman 1980 and
the other on the larger but small aperture sample of template spectra carefully compiled
and combined from the IUE archive by Kinney et al 1996 These data sets provide
useful UV spectra for a range of optically selected galaxies nicely spanning the observed
spectral range see Connolly et al 1996 so that a reasonable empirical interpolation and
extrapolation can be performed by matching these templates to the 4 passbands of the
HDF and improved by interpolating between these spectra to provide a smooth result
Additionally we include the average eects of the HI Lyman continuum and series forest
absorption at high redshift as parameterized by Madau 1995 for distant QSOs since
they signicantly aect the broad-band colours of high redshift galaxies
Formally we represent each element x in the two-dimensional template of a galaxy by
Fx  xfsx
where x is the surface brightness template at element x in the b band and where fsx
is the spectral energy distribution shape at the element x We take the surface brightness
template to equal that observed in the HDF in band b the band with the highest integrated
signal-to-noise either the I814 or the V606 band for the objects in our sample For clarity
we use the word element when referring to a pixel in the original bright galaxy image
because these pixels are transformed in area and ux by redshift and therefore distinct
from the pixel scale of the simulations which is set by the HDF
We take the SED shape fsx for each element x from two dierent compilations
of spectral templates the Coleman Wu  Weedman 1980 hereinafter CWW set
supplemented with the NGC4449 spectrum Bruzual  Ellis 1985 unpublished and the
Kinney et al 1996 K96 spectra CWW includes SEDs intended to be representative of the
dust-free E Sbc Scd Sdm and starburst NGC4449 galaxies and the K96 set includes
SEDs intended to represent ellipticals Sa Sb and SB1 starburst EB  V   03
galaxies We extend these observed SED templates below 1200 A and 1400 A respectively
by extrapolating the slope of the SED at these wavelengths down to the Lyman break at
 7 
912 A below which we set the observed ux to zero see Figure 3 We also interpolate
linearly between spectra to form a smoothly continuous set for better tting the observed 4
passband ux measurements
Integrating the SEDs over the transmission curve of the 4 passbands we then nd the
most-likely spectral template for each element x which we shall call sx such that the
sum of the squares of the dierences between the SED template uxes and the observed
uxes divided by the expected error in these uxes is a minimum The expected error is
taken to be the error in the value of the pixel uxes added in quadrature with the typical
cosmic variance in the model SED uxes 0m25 we nd Note that where the signal in
a pixel is less than twice the sky noise we have set the signal in that pixel equal to the
value given by Eq 1 adopting the surface brightness prole and the spectral energy
template which best matches the mean value determined in a 10 arcsec diameter aperture
We have not attempted to realign the HDF images in the dierent bands nor have we tried
to correct for the dierent shapes that the PSF has in the dierent bands since checks
indicate that these eects are small and induce changes on scales smaller than the HDF
pixel scale ie 004 arcsec This wavelength independence is due to the undersampling of
images by WFPC the eective HDF PSF being more set by the wavelength independent
sub-sampling grid pattern than by the wavelength dependent diraction of the telescope
Clearly we should take the spatial extent of each prototype image to be as large as
possible within the limits of the signal In practice we take this to be the radius at which
the mean pixel signal within an elliptical annulus is equal to the sky noise Inspection of
each image allows us to lter out the small number of obviously unrelated galaxies within
this extended aperture the pixels aected being replaced by their reected counterparts
To be sure of including the whole object we extend its 2D prole by 50 using the
radial gradient For this extended region we produce the noise by adding Poisson noise
from modeled signal in quadrature with the general background noise Except for the
very brightest cloned galaxies this extrapolation is not relevant since the vast majority
of replicated images generated from a given template galaxy are much fainter than the
original lying at higher redshift where these outer regions of the prole lie further into the
The question arises as to the utility of the HDF U300 images for generating the higher
redshift images in the redder bands since the sensitivity of the redder bands of the HDF
is greater than that of the U300 band As it turns out the signal in the HDF U300 images
is more than sucient for our purposes due to the strong 1  z4 cosmological surface
brightness dimming To see this consider the SN at a given  in a pixel through the
U300 lter at the observed redshift This translates into a lower SN at higher redshift in
 8 
1zobs or 75 log
the other bands given their relative sensitivities and exposure times Taking the worst
case that the spectrum of a given pixel is at in frequency though in practice the spectral
indices of some starburst systems are somewhat steeper than this the surface brightness
dims by a factor 75 log 1z
 or a decrease of the surface brightness by
13 23 and 33 magnitudespixel2 for the B450 V606 and I814 bands respectively However
the measured 1- U300 noise level for the HDF is 324 magpixel2 compared to the 322
340 and 326 magpixel2 levels in the B450 V606 I814 bands Clearly then since few pixels
are as blue or bluer than a at spectrum in our template galaxy sample the SN of any
pixel in a redder band at higher redshift will always be less than that of the observed U300
F 300W
While it is apparent that a number of objects in our input sample have extremely low
values of SN in the U300 band see the ellipticals in Figure 2a we emphasize that the SN
in U300 is always sucient to determine the appearance of these galaxies at higher redshifts
in the redder bands of the HDF given the relative band sensitivities and exposure times
used in these passbands Greater inequities between bands would limit the simulations to
depths less than the limiting magnitudes of these passbands
32 Space Density
We set the space density of each galaxy in our sample equal to 1Vmax determined
by the maximum redshift zmax to which each galaxy could have potentially been selected
given our chosen magnitude limit Vmax is given by
Vmax  SZ zmax
1  z2
Ez  q1  z3  1    1  z2  
where S is the solid angle of the surveyed area and where dLzmax is the well-known
luminosity distance at redshift zmax zmax is determined by
2233  I814AB  k814zmax  k814zobs  5 log
dLzmax
dLzobs
where zobs is the observed redshift and k814z is the k-correction in the I814 band at
redshift z We determine the k-correction for the galaxy from the total spectral energy
distribution which incorporates the contribution of all the elements in our two-dimensional
representation of each galaxy Note this procedure avoids the usual steps of constructing a
 9 
luminosity function parameterizing it and then assigning k-corrections We simply treat
each galaxy as a class of its own with a space density set by its own value of 1Vmax
allowing a fully unbinned individual treatment of each template galaxy
4 Consistency Checks and Sample Fairness
Astronomers have long used the V Vmax distribution Schmidt 1968 to assess the
completeness and uniformity of a sample where V is the volume up to and including the
redshift of the galaxy in question and Vmax is the volume in which this galaxy could have
been observed given the selection criteria For a uniform distribution of galaxies in a
volume one expects a uniform distribution of V Vmax between 0 and 1 in the absence
of evolution and clustering and for a sample with N galaxies the average value of this
quantity us given by
cid28 V
Vmaxcid29  05 
The distribution of V Vmax for our template sample is shown in Figure 4 for   01  09
  01 and   10 where the k-correction is formed from the SED averaged over the
whole object The average value for the V Vmax distribution is 048 051 and 053 for the
  01  09   01 and   1 geometries which is within the expected deviations
for the V Vmax statistic 050  005 and not inconsistent with the rate of evolution
detected in a larger redshift survey to a similar magnitude limit Lilly et al 1995 We
could have chosen to derive Vmax by redshifting each pixel of the object and performing the
photometry on the redshifted image for greater self consistency but this turns out to be
virtually irrelevant because the magnitudes we recover from the redshifted images placed at
zmax are on average displaced by only 007 magnitudes faintward of our magnitude limit
I814AB  2233 A slight faintward shift is expected for aperture magnitudes since the
lower surface brightnesses at zmax results in some small loss of the light on the wings To
illustrate this point we compare the recovered magnitudes at zmax with the magnitude
limit chosen for our bright sample in Figure 5
To provide a basic context for understanding the no-evolution simulations described
above we display the luminosity function obtained for this sample in Figure 6 for two
dierent representative cosmologies We compare this luminosity function with the bj-band
luminosity functions determined by Loveday et al 1992 and Zucca et al 1997 in the
APM and ESP surveys respectively correcting our sample to restframe bj directly using
our pixel-by-pixel best-t SEDs We see that our luminosity function is shifted to larger
luminosity andor space density than that of the local universe broadly consistent with the
ndings of Ellis et al 1996 and Lilly et al 1995 where the luminosity function of blue
 10 
objects is observed both to brighten and to steepen
We can also compare our sample with the redshift distribution Nz of the Canada-
France Redshift Survey CFRS a survey of similar depth by simulating as described in
detail below its survey parameters The CFRS sample covers 175  IAB  225 over 112
arcmin2 Scaling by these criteria and the 19 redshift incompleteness of the CFRS we can
construct a prediction for Nz using our method Figure 7 We make a small correction
inferable from Figure 5 of Lilly et al 1995 to convert from isophotal to total magnitudes
by a uniform 01 mag A noticeable dierence between our predicted Nz and that of the
CFRS is found in the amplitude of the distributions our redshift distribution being 28
higher consistent with the dierences in the respective luminosity functions Figure 6
Despite this the shape of our predicted Nz is very similar to that of the CFRS which
is not surprising given the wide spread of V Vmax for our sample Figure 4 This basic
agreement is quite satisfactory showing that our bright galaxy sample fairly samples the
range if not quite the average density of galaxies comprising the general eld population
5 HDF Simulations
According to the number density derived for each template galaxy 1Vmax and
assuming homogeneity we generate Monte-Carlo catalogues of the objects out to very large
redshift z  7 over the solid angle of the HDF each object being assigned a random
redshift position and position angle We then generate mock images on the basis of these
catalogues Each redshifted image must be scaled in size and resampled with more noise
and additional PSF smoothing to account for its higher redshift and generally smaller size
relative to its brighter counterpart Since the two-dimensional surface brightness proles
of the bright galaxies already contain noise we nd it useful to simultaneously generate
both a signal I and noise N image The noise image N keeps track of how much noise has
been implicitly added to each pixel in the signal image S by virtue of each galaxy template
implicitly containing noise Such an accounting allows the proper amount of noise to be
added to each pixel in the signal image after all the scaled galaxy templates have been laid
To generate an image at a chosen redshift we must calculate the change in size and
surface brightness of each element x in our two-dimensional galaxy templates For a galaxy
with redshift z we take the angular size of each element in our two-dimensional galaxy
template dz to be equal to
dz   dAzobs
dAz  dgal
 11 
where zobs is the redshift of the object as measured in the HDF dA is the angular distance
Peebles 1993 and dgal is the angular size of each element in our two-dimensional galaxy
template image at zobs ie the pixel size of galaxies in the HDF 004 arcsec We calculate
the surface brightness Xx z that each element x of our two-dimensional galaxy template
has at redshift z for a given passband X as
Xx z  x  kXx z  kbx zobs  25 logcid18 1  z
1  zobscid194
 X  bx
where kbx z and X  bx are the k-corrections and z  0 X  b colours calculated
based on the spectral energy distribution fsx of element x We have included the line
blanketing by the Lyman-alpha forest as given by Madau 1995 as well as Lyman-limit
absorption in our calculations of the k-corrections since these corrections become important
at z  20 in the U300 band and at z  35 in the B450 band
In calculating both the signal and the noise at each pixel on the images I and N
we break up each pixel into 25 smaller subpixels and calculate the contribution of each
redshifted element x to each of these smaller subpixels to account for the generally much
larger area covered by a data pixel than that of the redshifted image element for the
purpose of rebinning
Because the real PSF has smoothed each galaxy template to correctly calculate the
appearance of each prototype galaxy in our sample at higher redshifts we must add more
smoothing present in each object in the I image depending on the reduction in angular
size for the object in question For simplicity we simply smooth each object with a kernel
derived from a relatively isolated unsaturated star from the Hubble Deep Field reduced in
size so that its scale length is simply r1 cid16 dAzobs
dAz cid172
times that of the original scale length
The above expression is exact for the case of a perfectly Gaussian PSF and is also close to
exact in those cases where the angular size of the simulated galaxy laid down in the I image
is much smaller than the HDF Of course it is true that the real HDF PSF diers from a
Gaussian in that it has much more extended wings but for the most part the dierences
that this makes are small To verify this we compared the angular sizes recovered using the
present procedure and from assuming the PSF to be exactly Gaussian the s for which we
determined by tting to the same unsaturated star in the HDF and we found little if any
dependence on these dierences
For a pixel in which the contribution to the signal image I from an element in the
template image is Ixf  the noise contribution to the same pixel in the noise image N is
taken to be
N xvuut
 12 
added in quadrature where  S
N x is the SN ratio calculated for the element x for the
x template drawn from the HDF and account is made of both the background and
Poissonian noise associated with the measured pixel-by-pixel signal
Having generated the signal image we want to calculate the appropriate noise for each
pixel in our simulated HDF which we take to be
Nxdesired  q2  Ix2G
where  is the background noise level in the HDF Ix is the signal at pixel x and G is the
noise with standard deviation qN 2
Having already calculated the amount of noise which each pixel in the signal image had
by virtue of implicit noise in the templates ie the noise image N we can bring the noise in
each pixel up to the appropriate value Ndesired by adding pixel-by-pixel Gaussian-distributed
desired  N 2 smoothing this added noise with the noise
kernel specied in Table 4 of Williams et al 1996 so as to approximate the observed
correlation properties of the noise in the HDF While the outlined procedure will add
the appropriate amount of noise to pixels if noise is lacking in those pixels it is possible
that some pixels will already have more noise added to them than is present per pixel
in the HDF In particular this occurs when the redshift for an object is lower than that
of the prototype since of course we cannot improve on the SN of the prototype galaxy
image To articially prevent this possibility we simply replace every galaxy in our mock
catalogue whose redshift is lower than its observed redshift with another galaxy from our
bright sample placed at the same redshift whose observed redshift is lower than the mock
catalogue redshift Though this results in a bright galaxy population which is slightly
unrepresentative and in fact this is the cause of the slight disagreement observed in
the distribution of bright HDF galaxies and the simulations found later in the paper it
does not appreciably bias the measured properties of the cloned galaxies at the fainter
magnitudes of interest
The simulations cover a sky area four times that of the HDF in each of the four
broadbands U300 B450 V606 and I814 We perform these simulations self-consistently for
  01  09   01 and   1 by which we mean that the Vmax of the bright sample
uses the same geometry as the volume used in constructing the simulation In Figure 8 we
compare a no-evolution simulation assuming   10   01 and   09  01 with
an area of the same size selected from the HDF
A simple test of our procedure is to construct images of the 31 prototype galaxies at
their observed redshifts zobs Good agreement is found between these images and their
originals at zobs within the errors expected on the basis of our pixel-by-pixel SED ts To
 13 
illustrate this agreement more quantitatively we plot a comparison of the recovered values
for the half-light radius Petrosian radius Petrosian 1976 and apparent I814 magnitudes
in Figure 9
6 Object Detection
On both the simulations and the HDF itself we perform the object identication and
photometry using SExtractor version 12b5 Bertin  Arnouts 1996 After smoothing
the I814 images with a Gaussian of 006-arcsec radius the approximate PSF within
SExtractor we require that objects be at least 2 sigma above the noise over an area of at
least 10 contiguous pixels and we use a cleaning parameter of 10 We select our apparent
magnitudes to be equal to SExtractors MAG BEST estimate which for non-crowded
objects is equivalent to an isophotal magnitude extrapolated beyond the isophotes We
exclude objects with half-light radii less than 015 arcsec and I814AB  23 as stars fainter
than which the contamination is relatively small Then based upon the detected objects
we used SExtractor to determine the apparent magnitudes in the other bands with the I814
apertures
We set the deblending parameter DEBLEND MINCONT  which is important in
determining the extent to which SExtractor breaks up objects to be equal to 004 We
found some dependence of our results on the value chosen for this parameter particularly
the break-up rate but for the most part this dependence was small Our chosen value of the
deblending parameter is very close to that 005 used by Clements  Couch 1997 Couch
private communication With this choice of parameter we obtained the reasonable result
that no bright galaxy from our sample broke up into smaller pieces when placed at its zmax
in agreement with our qualitative impressions in looking at these images
We derive two dierent measures of the angular size for each object in our image a
Petrosian radius Petrosian 1976 and a half-light radius We take the Petrosian radius
to equal the smallest radius for which the surface brightness at that radius equals half
the average surface brightness interior to that radius The half-light radius is equal to
the radius of the aperture which contained half the light as determined by SExtractors
best estimate of the total light We performed some simulations to test our method for
recovering half-light radii and found that our recovered half-light radii are only slightly
scattered about sizes 10 smaller than the input half-light radii at I814AB  24 The
scatter in this relationship partially derives from the uncertainty in the overall photometry
performed by SExtractor

7 Results
71 Number Counts in the I814 band
It is natural to begin our comparison of the faint galaxy population in the HDF by
looking at the counts in I814 the longest wavelength band and hence least aected by
uncertainty in the k-correction Figure 10 compares the number counts recovered from
both our simulations and the observations a description of the plotted 1 estimates based
on the size of our bright sample is given in Appendix A For all geometries we nd that
our no-evolution predictions fall steadily short of the observations with increasing apparent
magnitude For   09  01 the shortfall is noticeably less pronounced due to the
relatively larger volume available At I814AB  26 for example the counts fall short by
a factor 19  04 for   09  01 compared to 54  10 for   1 and 27  08 for
  01
Of course the counts recovered at bright magnitudes I814AB  22 are in fair
agreement with the observations as one would expect given the denition of our sample up
to approximately the same bright limit I814AB  2233 It is reassuring to nd that there
little dependence of the number counts on the choice of spectral template whether it be
the CWW set or the K96 set Finally as discussed in Appendix B we note that the present
no-evolution faint counts I814AB  28 are compromised of a non-negligible number of the
input prototype galaxies  10
72 Number-Count Completeness Overcounting and Clustering
Given our knowledge of the positions redshifts magnitudes and types of galaxies
laid down in each simulated image it is simple to determine systematic uncertainties
such as incompleteness in the number counts by matching up the object catalogues from
the simulations created by SExtractor with our input Monte-Carlo catalogues Figure
11 shows that the incompleteness becomes signicant in the range I814AB  26 for both
our no-evolution simulations This incompleteness stems from the fact that at fainter
magnitudes we are sensitive to smaller and hence the higher surface brightness galaxies so
that large fraction of the population of galaxies at faint magnitudes subtend areas too large
for detection given their redshifted surface brightnesses
In a similar manner we can determine the rate of overcounting of in our simulated
elds As explained in Colley et al 1997 it is possible to overcount the number of faint
galaxies by misidentifying individual parts of a galaxy as distinct galaxies especially at
 15 
higher redshifts where the rest-frame ultraviolet light is accessed and HII regions have a
higher contrast cf the galaxy at z  0319 in Figure 2b For simplicity rather than
perform an angular correlation analysis like Colley et al 1997 we have chosen to measure
this number directly In Figure 12 we display the rate of overcounting for all the simulations
performed by comparison of the input random catalogue with those recovered Clearly in
our no-evolution simulations using the parameters chosen for the photometry overcounting
is never an important eect for any of the cosmologies examined
The clustering seen in the HDF redshift data at bright magnitudes Figure 1 is
responsible for the overdensity at bright magnitudes I814  2233 in the HDF relative to the
mean eld counts measured in wider eld surveys Compared to the CFRS for example
this amounts to a  28 overdensity Figure 7 At fainter magnitudes however the count
variance should be less aected by clustering given the greater projected volume and the
expectation of less well developed structure at earlier times We provide a quick test of the
plausibility of this hypothesis using other deep HST I814 data Figure 13 shows the count
variance between 6 pointings two sets of 3 HST pointings separated by 3 hours on the sky
from another program These data show that the count variance in I814 band decreases
steadily to the Poissonian limit I  25 over the area of WFPC2 consistent with isotropy
at faint magnitudes
73 Angular Sizes
We compare the distributions of half-light radii recovered from the HDF with those of
our no-evolution simulations in Figure 14 The hatched area represents the 1 uncertainty
range based on the nite size of our bright sample for the no-evolution model using the
CWW SED templates The solid curve indicates the angular size distribution recovered
from simulations using the K96 SED templates At bright magnitudes 21  I814AB  226
the angular sizes recovered from the simulations agree quite well with the observations as
expected given the fact that we dened our bright sample in terms of many of these same
galaxies
In contrast at fainter magnitudes the half-light radii from the no-evolution simulations
become signicantly larger than those from the observations
57 in the magnitude range 24  I814AB  26 and larger by 35 42 and 53
in the magnitude range 26  I814AB  275 for the   01  01   01 and
  1 geometries respectively where the median of the angular size distribution in each
magnitude bin is used for comparison As expected we see that galaxies in the   09
  01 geometry tend to possess smaller angular sizes than galaxies in the   01
larger by 43 44 and
 16 
geometry and especially galaxies in the   10 geometry because of the somewhat larger
angular-diameter distances
We repeat the above comparisons using the Petrosian radii instead of the half-light radii
Ideally Petrosian radii provide a more reliable surface brightness-independent estimator
of the angular size than half-light radii though one might question its meaningfulness
given the increasingly lumpy appearance and small sizes of faint galaxies In any case an
inspection of Figure 15 shows that the same general trends and conclusions hold here as for
the half-light radii
74 Colour Distributions
In Figure 16-17 we plot a comparison between the colour distributions recovered from
the observations and our no-evolution simulations in three dierent magnitude ranges for
two dierent colours B450  I814AB and V606  I814AB Good agreement is found at the
bright magnitudes 21  I814AB  226 as expected given that our bright sample is selected
up to this magnitude limit At fainter magnitudes however a clear excess of bluer galaxies
is observed relative to our no-evolution simulations In addition in the faintest magnitude
bin 26  I814AB  275 there also appears to be an excess of red galaxies relative to that
found in the no-evolution simulations This is somewhat unexpected because one would
expect the real universe for which our sample is representative at z  05 to have a younger
and therefore bluer appearance than that of our extrapolated sample This excess may
therefore reect the presence of dust and Lyman-series forest absorption at moderate to
high-redshift Conceivably an ad-hoc maximal dwarf-model might also account for this red
excess in terms of faded dwarfs at low redshift
75 Redshift Distributions
In Figure 18 we plot the redshift distributions of the galaxies recovered by SExtractor
by matching them up with our input catalogues It is apparent that in the absence of
evolution very few galaxies lie beyond a redshift z  2 even at the faintest magnitude
with little dependence on the choice of geometry A dramatic illustration of the relative
unobservability of high redshift galaxies for   01 is given in Figure 19 where we have
broken up the simulation of a 52 x 72 HDF exposure into 4 redshift slices
It is interesting to see how these distributions compare with the photometric redshift
estimates derived from ts to the 4 passbands of the HDF and from subsequent near-IR
 17 
imaging of this eld from the ground Surprisingly enough the redshift distribution
recovered from our no-evolution simulations agree remarkably well with the approximate
distribution of Lanzetta Yahil  Fernandez-Soto 1996 Given that similar coincidences
have been found for redshift surveys at somewhat brighter magnitude limits Broadhurst
et al 1988 Colless et al 1993 Cowie et al 1996 it is somewhat tempting to suppose
that this result might hold to yet fainter magnitudes Despite such hopes clearly this
relationship begins to break down in the B band at fainter magnitudes B  24 at least
as Cowie et al 1996 have shown and presumably a similar break down will occur in the
redder bands at fainter magnitudes
76 U300 and B450 Dropouts
In Figures 20 and 21 we plot several colour-colour diagrams and overplot the
U300-dropout and B450-dropout selection criteria given by Madau et al 1996 criteria
useful for selecting galaxies at redshifts 2  z  35 and 35  z  45 respectively We
count the number of recovered galaxies satisfying these criteria and provide a sumary
in Table 2 As expected from the recovered redshift distributions plotted in Figure
18 it is clear that the no-evolution simulations contain manifestly fewer dropouts than
the observations Clearly then the high-redshift universe contains a larger number of
objects which of greater luminosity in the ultraviolet than the galaxy population in our
redshift-complete sample
We have compared the numbers of dropouts in the HDF found by Madau et al 1996
with our values listed in Table 2 using the same colour-magnitude window Our dropout
rate is higher for the HDF a nding which might result from our use of SExtractor for
photometry rather than FOCAS as employed by Madau et al 1996 Given that these
programs likely dier with regard to the degree to which they successfully estimate the
magnitudes of detected objects our analyses probably probe slightly dierent depths
even though we choose for comparison the same nominal magnitude limit I814  2679
Imposing a magnitude limit 0m3 brighter we can reproduce their dropout rate Also as
stated by Madau et al 1996 their FOCAS magnitudes are in general estimated to be too
faint by about 0m5
 18 
77 Asymmetry
In the light of recent work attempting to quantify the morphology of faint galaxies
we compare the properties of the faint galaxies from the HDF against those from our
simulations with the A statistic proposed by Abraham et al 1996a1996b in order to
provide an approximate estimate of the extent to which evolution may aect the asymmetry
of galaxies where A is dened as the sum of the absolute value of the dierences between a
galaxy image and itself rotated 180 degrees about the center of the image The approximate
contribution of the noise to the apparent asymmetry is calculated and subtracted We plot
the distribution of this asymmetry parameter recovered both from our simulations and
from the HDF in Figure 22 for two dierent magnitude bins We nd a clear trend toward
larger values of this parameter with increasing magnitude At the simplest level this would
seem to imply that the faint galaxies are less smooth than the redshifted eld population
at z  05 used in our simulations
Some caution must be exercised in interpreting the A statistic since it appears to be
extremely sensitive to the manner in which one determines the center about which to rotate
for evaluating the statistic Abraham  Brinchmann private communication and can
exhibit a fair amount of scatter 01 depending upon whether one takes the centroid or
the maximum as the for the center Because of this the statistic or at least the present
implementation seems to become increasingly unreliable for the smallest galaxies and hence
we restrict our comparison to the bright magnitudes I814AB  26 where we are more
condent in the reliability of the statistic from our own internal tests
Note that along similar lines based upon pixel-by-pixel k-corrections of the Frei
Guhathakurta  Gunn 1996 sample and systematic applications of asymmetry A 
central-concentration C statistics Abraham et al 1996a1996b have argued that the
fainter galaxy population is quite unlike the local galaxy population broadly represented
by the Frei et al 1996 sample which is nevertheless somewhat ill-dened lacking a rm
magnitude limit or well-dened selection criteria
8 Discussion
Since the novelty of the HDF is principally its angular size information obtained
to unprecedentedly faint magnitudes it is not too surprising that our most interesting
nding relates to the sizes of the faint images The count excess is clearly composed of
galaxies with smaller projected areas than expected on the basis of relatively low-redshift
galaxies z  05 for any interesting geometry The evolution of angular-size has not been
 19 
completely clear in the literature to date Previously in the range 24  I  25 Roche
et al 1996 nd an apparent excess of galaxies with small angular sizes relative to their
no-evolution models which are designed to replicate the angular sizes of galaxies in the
local universe At brighter magnitudes I  22 the study by Im et al 1995 on the
prerefurbished HST data indicates that the angular sizes of this population is also smaller
than expected based upon more local brighter measures However there have also been
some studies based on this parallel data indicating no changes in size Mutz et al 1994
Casertano et al 1995
We also nd that the number density of dropouts discovered at faint magnitudes
exceeds that recovered from our no-evolution simulation a nding which clearly indicates
that the real high-redshift universe contains a larger density of galaxies with high UV
surface brightnesses Note however that despite this nding the estimated integrated
star-formation rates in these redshift ranges are similar Madau et al 1996 Clearly
then as argued in Steidel et al 1996 and Lowenthal et al 1997 cf Figure 7 more
star-formation took place on relatively small scales at high-redshift It remains unclear
whether this is the result of the intrinsically smaller baryonic aggregations or the increasing
prominence of starbursts at high redshifts
Our nding that overcounting rates do not seem to be very important see also the
companion paper Bouwens Broadhurst  Silk 1998 is somewhat contrary to the claims
of Colley et al 1997 even though we used a similar program SExtractor with similar
values of the deblending parameter as one catalogue Clements  Couch 1997 used in their
study Of course the galaxy population we have used for our study is more evolved than
expected in the real universe at higher redshifts so we might expect our value to be an
underestimate Note that in any case the small scale correlation claimed is a statistically
marginal result  15 Colley et al 1997
Less contentious are our ndings regarding the colours and the number counts In
agreement with most authors we nd clear evidence that the predictions without evolution
are redder than observed Lilly et al 1995 and that the number counts fall short of the
data at faint magnitudes Lilly 1993 Pozzetti et al 1996
As we have already argued it is possible to see the present work as a demonstration
that the trends found in comparing the local z  0 population with intermediate-redshift
galaxies z  05 extend to yet fainter magnitudes and presumably higher redshifts At
these intermediate magnitudes a larger number of faint blue irregular and presumably
small galaxies Ellis et al 1996 Lilly et al 1995 Brinchmann et al 1998 Guzman et al
1997 have been reported at z  05  08 relative to local expectations The present study
demonstrates that the these trends extend to yet fainter magnitudes in that there continues
 20 
to be both an increase in the number and apparent starburst activity of the faint galaxy
population as well as a decrease in mean galaxy size
Uncertainty estimates for the present study are somewhat internal and therefore
might underestimate a eld-averaged variance in our measurements Certainly at bright
magnitudes the HDF is  28 overdense with respect to the CFRS However since 90
of our bright galaxy sample ranges over a wide spread in distance some 1500 Mpch and
V Vmax is evenly spread over the interval 01 most bright galaxies should be considered
as independent Clearly we would prefer a larger more local sample of redshift-complete
bright galaxies for our simulations and other deep multicolour HDF imaging would be
useful in the rst two respects
9 Summary
We have developed a technique for generating a model-independent faint galaxy
population based on pixel-by-pixel k-corrected images of the bright galaxy population
for comparison with deep high-resolution images Our technique has the virtue of being
model-independent and completely empirical except for the usual choice of geometry We
have made use of the HDF for the purposes of dening a redshift-complete bright galaxy
sample from which to construct empirical simulations and also for evaluating the evolution
of the much fainter galaxies detected in the HDF We have made use of all four passbands
and have been able to make concrete statements about the evolution of the image properties
with estimated uncertainties based on the size of a volume-limited sample We nd that
relative to our simulations based on the bright galaxy sample the faint galaxies are smaller
more numerous bluer less regular and contain more dropouts for any interesting geometry
Of particular note is our nding with regard to angular sizes for which a variety of nebulous
and seemingly contradictory statements may be found in the literature
Our bright galaxy sample is small and it will be important to see if our conclusions
remain valid when a larger sample is available Nonetheless we believe this work is an
important foundation on which to build in particular as we look forward to independent
deep elds and the very signicant improvement in the quality of UV and optical imaging

A Determination of Random Errors
Here we quantify the empirical model uncertainties due to the nite size of our input
sample We look at this uncertainty in terms of an arbitrary quantity describing the surface
density of objects on the sky satisfying some observational criteria
luminosities and sizes ie PN
For any faint sample of objects satisfying a certain set of observable criteria SO it
is possible to express the probability distribution for the number of these objects as the
sum of the probability distributions for this variable over all possible galaxy morphologies
i1 fi We suppose that this faint sample of galaxies is derived
in a Monte-Carlo manner from our bright sample on the basis of no-evolution assumptions
so that it is possible to express this probability distribution for each galaxy type as the
product of the probability distribution for the number of times this object will appear in
our bright sample call it Bi and the probability distribution for the number of times such
a galaxy would be expected to appear in the faint sample in question SO call it Di In
this way the overall probability distribution for the number of galaxies observed in a given
faint sample SO can be expressed as
We shall suppose that each galaxy in our bright sample is suciently unique to be
represented by its own term in the above equation Furthermore since each of these galaxies
appeared in our bright sample once and only once we suppose that Bi is Poisson-distributed
with a mean of 1 which we approximate as a normal distribution about this mean For
lack of something better we shall take the probability distributions Bi for all other galaxy
types to be delta functions at 02
2 Note however that galaxy prototypes with relatively large values of Di ie with relatively larger
contributions at faint magnitudes than at bright magnitudes could result in large systematic errors in this
distribution
 22 
Now it is possible to estimate the uncertainty in the expectation value for the number
of galaxies in our faint sample based on the nite number of galaxies we have in our bright
sample Because our simulated area is in principle unlimited the uncertainty in the
expectation value of Di is vanishingly small and in practice we take this uncertainty to be
zero As such the above probability distribution is simply the sum of normal distributions
with various weights and therefore its 1-sigma uncertainty is simply equal to qPN
We have used this expression throughout our paper in the estimation of errors for each
observable calculated from our no-evolution simulations
B Breakdown of Faint Samples
At fainter magnitudes one expects a smaller number of the galaxy prototypes to make
up an increasing fraction of our faint galaxy sample as a result both of the dierential
k-corrections and of the relatively greater volume available to lower luminosity objects
at fainter magnitudes To quantify the importance of this trend we compute a weighted
measure of the eective number of galaxies which contribute to the counts in each magnitude
bin a quantity we take to equal
where ni is the number of galaxies of a given prototype per magnitude per square degree
recovered from our simulations and N is the number of prototypes considered ie 31
Basically the above expression equals the square of the number counts divided by the
estimated Poissonian error based on the size of the contributing sample at the magnitude
in question the derivation of which is given in Appendix A In the case that all the nis are
the same the expression reduces to N as required
We compute the above expression from our simulations and we plot the results in
Figure 23 At bright magnitudes the bright galaxy catalogues are still dominated by shot
noise so that the number of galaxies estimated from the above expression to contribute
at any magnitude is lower than the real number  31 which contribute At fainter
magnitudes the eective of number of galaxies decreases again for the reasons stated
above ie a relatively smaller dierential volume for the more luminous galaxies and the
k-correction For the sake of clarity we emphasize that at each magnitude every galaxy
prototype contributes some fraction to the number counts there

brightness to bring out the spatial detail at z  05 and to give a qualitative assessment of
the importance of the k-correction for various portions of the galaxies thereby illustrating
the strong contrast between ellipticals and HII regions at high redshift The ordering in this

measured redshifts being listed for identication For the sake of clarity these images are

the no-evolution case Note that for our faint galaxy simulations the calculation of the

the bright sample is evenly spread in the interval 0  V Vmax  1 given the errors for any
choice of geometry indicating we have a fair representation of galaxies

Fig 5 The recovered magnitudes of our sample galaxies after placing them at their
values of zmax corresponding to the magnitude limit of the data I814AB  2233 zmax is
determined using the integrated light whose mean SED was taken as an integral over all the
pixels This plot shows that the determination of zmax and hence the space density 1Vmax
derived in this way is very close to the value that would be determined using two-dimensional
k-corrections albeit slightly biased since the recovered magnitudes are only 6 fainter than
the magnitude limit That the recovered magnitudes are systematically on the faint side of
this limit is to be expected since a portion of the outer light proles are lost in the sky noise

Fig 6 Luminosity functions determined for the galaxies in our sample solid circles colour
transformed to the bj-band by using the integrated SED determined from the pixel-by-pixel

functions of the APM survey Loveday et al 1992 and the ESP bj-band luminosity function
of Zucca et al 1997 plotted as solid squares and triangles respectively All error bars
represent 1 Poissonian uncertainties Also shown is the transformed CFRS luminosity
function to the bj-band using their published V  I colours and the CWW SED templates
for interpolation Note the fairly good agreement of our luminosity function with the CFRS
and that both of our luminosity functions show evolution with respect to the APM and ESP

The comparison accounts for the relative areas of the two redshift samples and assumes
the 19 incompleteness in redshift of the CFRS as just a normalization correction The

the clustering seen in the redshift distribution see gure 1 Note that the shapes of the
distributions are very similar suggesting that our sample has a representative mix of galaxies

that the recovered values are very close to the true observations thereby validating our
technique of image generation

Fig 10 The upper panels show the comparison of the observed number counts histogram
with 1 Poisson errors in I814AB with those recovered from our no-evolution simulations
for the two choices of SED templates The hatched region represents the estimated 1  range
in the counts based on the nite size of our bright input sample using the CWW templates
while the solid curve represents the recovered counts using the K96 templates All cases are
shown for   01  09   01 and   1 geometries

Fig 11 The completeness of the counts in the I814 band determined from the simulations
for the no-evolution simulations based on the CWW SED templates solid line and the
no-evolution simulations based on the K96 SED templates for   01  09   01 and
  1 Because surface brightness has a rough inverse proportionality to angular size at a
given magnitude the completeness limit is directly related to the angular sizes of the faint
galaxy population in that galaxy populations with smaller angular sizes are more complete
at fainter magnitudes

Fig 12 The  of galaxies which are counted more than once mostly as a result of the
fact that in the UV they break up into distinct pieces The overcounting rate is relatively
low and similar for all geometries
 38 
Fig 13 The variance in the number counts in the I814 band from 6 independent faint
WFPC pointings from another program The variance tends steadily towards the Poissonian
limit This simple empirical demonstration suggests that our use of the small HDF region
as a fair representation of the universe is reasonable

14 Comparison of the distribution of half-light radii recovered from the HDF
histogram with those recovered from our no-evolution simulations for three dierent
geometries   01   09   01   1 and three dierent magnitude ranges The
hatched region represents the angular sizes recovered from the no-evolution simulations
generated using the CWW SED templates while the solid curve represents those sizes
recovered from simulations generated using the K96 SED templates Note the good
agreement between the recovered sizes for the no-evolution models and the data at bright
magnitudes as required
In contrast for the fainter magnitude bins I814AB  24 the
observed sizes are much smaller than for the simulations Low  and the addition of
low-luminosity galaxies see Bouwens Broadhurst  Silk 1998 help somewhat with this
discrepancy but the shortfall in number is still large

15 Analogous to Figure 14 except using the Petrosian radius The observed
distribution shows a sharper peak at small sizes but the basic conclusions are the same
Note that contrary to the half-light radii the Petrosian radius is not sensitive to changes in
the surface brightness or the choice of isophotes

Fig 16 Comparison of the colour distributions B450  I814AB for the observations
histogram with 1 Poissonian errors with the simulations using the CWW SED templates
hatched region representing the 1 uncertainties based upon the nite size of our bright
galaxy sample and using the K96 SED templates solid line for dierent geometries
  01   09   01   1 and dierent magnitude ranges Note the recovered
distribution of colours from our no-evolution simulations agrees roughly with the recovered
distribution of colours from the HDF in the bright magnitude bin as it should since our no-
evolution simulations are composed of precisely these same galaxies At fainter magnitudes
the breadth of the observed distribution is greater than the no-evolution simulations with
the mean shifted to bluer colours

17 Comparison of the colour distributions V606  I814AB for the observations
histogram with 1 uncertainties with the simulations using the CWW SED templates
hatched region representing the estimated 1  uncertainties based upon the nite size of the
bright galaxy sample and using the K96 SED templates solid line for dierent geometries
  01   09   01   1 and dierent magnitude ranges

Fig 18 Redshift distribution of those objects recovered by SExtractor from no-evolution
simulations with CWW SED templates hatched region indicating 1 uncertainties and
our no-evolution simulations with K96 SED templates solid line with I814AB  26 and
I814AB  28 for   01  09   01 and   1 geometries For comparison the upper
panel shows the redshift estimates by Lanzetta Yahil  Fernandez-Soto 1996 which are
lower than the estimates by Mobasher et al 1996 and higher than those of Sawicki Lin
 Yee 1997

  01 no-evolution simulation with pixel size signal-to-noise and PSF identical to that of
the HDF Note the decreased visibility of our bright galaxy sample at high redshift

Fig 20 Comparison of the U300  B450AB versus B450  I814AB diagrams for our no-
evolution simulations with the CWW SED templates lower panel and our no-evolution
simulations with the K96 SED templates top panel with the observations for B450AB 
2679 the same criterion used in Madau et al 1996 The area interior to the dashed line is
the region Madau et al 1996 suggests is occupied by high-redshift galaxies 2  z  35
whose Lyman limit crosses the U300 bandpass Note that galaxies near the top of the colour-
colour diagram ie with U300B450AB  46 are simply lower limits on the U300B450AB
colour These no-evolution simulations underpredict the number of dropouts in this region
 46 
Fig 21 Comparison of the B450  V606AB versus V606  I814AB diagrams for our no-
evolution simulations with the CWW SED templates lowest panel and our no-evolution
simulations with K96 SED templates top panel against the observations for galaxies with
V606AB  280 the same criterion used in Madau et al 1996 With a dashed line we
have overplotted the B-band dropout region suggested by Madau et al 1996 for nding
high redshift 35  z  45 galaxies whose Lyman-limit crosses the B bandpass Note that
galaxies near the top of the colour-colour diagram ie with B450V606AB  35 are simply
lower limits on the B450  V606AB colour As with the U300 dropouts these no-evolution
simulations underpredict the number of dropouts

22 Comparison of the distribution of asymmetries recovered from the HDF
histogram with 1 Poissonian errors and our simulations assuming no-evolution using
the CWW SED templates hatched region representing the 1  uncertainties estimated
from the nite size of our bright sample and using the K96 SED templates solid line
The asymmetry statistic pioneered by Abraham et al 1996a1996b is equal to zero for
completely symmetric objects and systematically increases for more asymmetric objects
Clearly the data appears to be systematically more asymmetric at fainter magnitudes than
the observations though this result may be partially biased by the general dierences in
angular-sizes of the populations in question
 48 
Fig 23 This gure sows the eective number of the galaxy prototypes which contribute
as a function of magnitude see Appendix B for a description At brighter magnitudes
the eective number should be close to the number of galaxy prototypes the shortfall
seen here can be attributed to shot noise At fainter magnitudes because of a relatively
smaller dierential volume for the more luminous galaxies and diering k-corrections the
bluer galaxy prototypes contribute more to the counts than others eectively reducing the
numbers of prototypes sampled at higher redshift
