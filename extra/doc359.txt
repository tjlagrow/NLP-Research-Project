Abstract We summarize here the rst results of a new spectroscopic
survey of galaxies in the Coma cluster with 205  MB  14 Dier-
ences between the last epoch of star formation SF activity in S0 and
elliptical galaxies are discussed Furthermore we show that about half of
all galaxies without present-day SF display signs of activity at z  1  2
Systematic trends of most recent SF epoch with galaxy luminosity are
presented
Introduction
In this contribution we report on the rst results of a new spectroscopic survey
of galaxies in the Coma cluster This survey was designed to have three main
characteristics
1 It extends over almost 7 mag in galaxy luminosity 205  MB  14 well
into the dwarf regime In fact this is by far the largest spectroscopic sample of
cluster dwarf galaxies to date
2 It covers two areas of 33  50 1  15 Mpc towards the center and the
southwest region of Coma The photometry B and R has been obtained with
the Japanese Mosaic CCD camera at the William Herschel Telescope WHT in
collaboration with M Doi M Iye NKashikawa Y Komiyama S Okamura
M Sekiguchi K Shimasaku M Yagi N Yasuda
3 It is essentially a magnitude limited sample without signicant color or mor-
phological bias therefore it includes galaxies of all Hubble types
We obtained multiber spectra with the WYFFOS bre spectrograph at the
WHT for about 300 galaxies members of Coma and 200 eld galaxies The spec-
tra cover the central 22 arcsec 13 kpc of the galaxies and have a mean SN

S0 galaxies lled circles as a function of the R-band magnitude
ranging from 16 for the brightest subset to 8 for the faintest subset Hence the
errorbars on the spectral line measurements are large for the faint galaxies and
for them only broad conclusions regarding ages and metallicities can be reached
Here we consider only the  250 galaxies without emission lines in their spectra
For them we have measured the absorption line indices in the Lick system The
stellar properties luminosity weighted ages and metallicities have been derived
from index-index diagrams comparing with spectrophometric models based
on the Padova isochrones httpastrosaueduwortheydialdial a padhtml

2 S0 versus elliptical galaxies
There are 19 ellipticals and 33 S0s in our sample with a secure morphological
classication from Dressler 1980 All but one of the ellipticals are consistent
with luminosity weighted ages  9 Gyr while 13 S0s have ages  5 Gyr Fig 1
left Thus a signicant fraction  40 of the S0s show evidence for some
recent SF This is consistent with the hypothesis that they evolved from star-
forming spirals that were accreted onto the cluster and had their SF truncated
at intermediate redshifts Dressler et al 1997 Fasano et al 2000 see also
van Dokkum and Treu in these proceedings This dierence in age spread
between Es and S0s is similar to the results of Kuntschner  Davies 1998 in
the Fornax cluster and Smail et al 2001 in A2218 In contrast other works
eg Jones Smail  Couch 2000 Ellis et al 1997 have not found a statistically
signicant dierence between the ages of the stars in S0s and Es It is obviously
important to understand whether S0s with recent SF are a common phenomenon
in clusters or not In this respect it is interesting to look at the age distributions

of galaxies as a function of magnitude1 In Fig 1 right the population of S0s
with recent SF is noticeable below the dotted line only 4 of the young S0s
are brighter than MB  19 In fact considering galaxies brighter and fainter
than MB  19 bright and faint Es have similar age distributions while the
fraction of S0s with recent SF is higher at fainter luminosities Therefore a
possible reason for the discrepant results found so far recent SF in cluster S0s
yes or no could be the luminosity range explored by the dierent studies Given
the luminosity function of spirals at z  05 and the expected fading if their SF
1We note that S0s and Es follow a broadly similar metallicity-luminosity relation top in the
right panel of Fig 1 although the relation for the S0s is slightly steeper and more scattered
than that of the Es
Poggianti et al
is halted the great majority of the spirals evolved into S0s should be typically
fainter than MB  20  192
3 The infall history of the Coma cluster
In the following we will consider the complete spectroscopic sample with no
emission lines including galaxies of all magnitudes and Hubble types This
sample represents the total cluster population of galaxies without current SF
There is a broad range of ages from younger than 3 Gyr to older than 9 Gyr
among galaxies of any magnitude However there are systematic trends of age
with galaxy magnitude Dividing all galaxies into four magnitude bins  50 
of galaxies in any bin are old ie with no sign of SF during the last 9 Gyr
at z  1  2 As shown in Fig 2 the proportion of luminous galaxies that
are passive at z0 and that experienced a SF activity at intermediate redshift
035  z  1 is 30 to 50  and it is higher than the fraction of dwarf galaxies
that were active at that epoch This is consistent with the observations of
currentrecent SF in a large number of galaxies in intermediate-z clusters eg
Dressler et al 1999 At low redshift instead SF involved a higher fraction of
faint than bright galaxies These results can be used to trace the infall history of
galaxies onto Coma and the consequent star formation history of its present-day
galaxies The luminositymass dependence of the most recent SF epoch points
to a down-sizing eect and can be compared with the accretion history of
clusters predicted by cosmological models
