Abstract
The state-of-the-art of chemical evolution models for Irregular and Blue Compact
galaxies is reviewed The resulting scenarios for the initial mass function the regime of
star formation and the eciency of gas outows are described The IMF appears to be
roughly the same everywhere the SF has possibly followed a bursting regime in BCGs
and a more continuous regime in Irregulars but with signicant exceptions galactic winds
must occur in some of these galaxies with eciencies inversely proportional to the galaxy
potential well
Introduction
Irregular Irr and Blue Compact BCG galaxies have always had signicant importance for
cosmological studies One of the major reasons for this is that they host the HII regions
from which the relation between helium and oxygen YO is derived and consequently
the primordial helium abundance Yp They thus provide a fundamental test for theories of
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Moreover these galaxies are usually poorly evolved systems and
can thus be considered as fairly similar to primordial galaxies What brings them more into
fashion nowadays is however the circumstance that they have been recently suggested as major
contributors to the excess of faint blue objects in deep galaxy counts
To study properly all the above cosmological issues it would be necessary to know not only
the current or recent evolutionary conditions of these galaxies but also or mostly their con-
ditions at the earlier epochs which correspond to high redshifts In the case of the Magellanic
Clouds and the few other closest irregulars in the Local Group this is feasible with sucient
accuracy thanks to the fact that their old stars are observable and examinable in detail For
the great majority of Irrs and BCGs however the older stars are too faint to be individually
resolvable and the available observational data refer only to young objects For these galaxies
one of the few ways to infer their past evolutionary conditions is from chemical evolution mod-
els By selecting those models which are able to reproduce the observed features one can in
fact derive the most plausible scenarios for previous epochs although with the usual caveat 31
that such scenarios may not be unique since dierent models can provide predictions for the
recent times in similar agreement with the available constraints but fairly dierent predictions
for the earlier unconstrained phases 33
2 Outline of chemical evolution models
The major task and diculty for chemical evolution models of Irrs and BCGs is to reproduce
their low observed chemical abundances despite the relatively high observed star formation
rates SFR
The theoretical parameters involved in the computation of these models are essentially
three the law of star formation SF the initial mass function IMF and the gas ows in and
out of the system Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis are the other important ingredients
in chemical evolution models In the following I concentrate only on the galactic parameters
without discussing the uncertainties on stellar evolution theories despite the fact that the latter
deserve a careful treatment as well
A priori the galactic parameters are free as a consequence of our ignorance on the actual
physical mechanisms regulating the formation of stars and the evolution of the interstellar
medium However the comparison with appropriate observational constraints of the model
predictions based on dierent assumptions on the parameters leads to a signicant reduction
of their ranges of acceptable values
The observational constraints usually available for most Irrs and BGCs are the gas and total
masses Mg and Mt respectively and the chemical abundances of the elements measurable from
the emission lines of HII regions namely He N O and in a few cases C and Fe
Eective constraints on the SF in a galaxy come from its observed MgMt and absolute
element abundances For instance if a model assumes an excessively high or long SF activity
in a given galaxy this provides an excessively high number of formed stars which in turn lead
to an excessively high gas consumption and metal production Such model thus predicts too
many metals and too little gas with respect to the observed values and this is the sign that
the SF activity must be lower than adopted
The most signicant tests on the IMF are the abundance ratios of elements produced and
ejected by stars of dierent mass Fortunately the few elements measurable in these galaxies are
indeed produced in dierent stellar sites For instance N is produced mostly by intermediate
mass stars O only by massive stars and Fe partly 13 by SNeII and mostly 23 by
SNeIa Lets assume that for a given galaxy one adopts a too at IMF there will be too many
massive stars with respect to lower mass ones and consequently overproduction of oxygen
and underproduction of iron and even less nitrogen The predicted NO ratio will then be
signicantly lower and the predicted OFe higher than observed a circumstance indicating
that the IMF appropriate for that galaxy should be steeper than the adopted one
Irrs and BCGs can experience both infall and outows of gas depending on their potential
well generally low and on the intergalactic medium where they are imbedded However from
the point of view of their chemical evolution outows have turned out to be more important
than inows at variance with what happens in big spiral galaxies The occurrence of galactic
winds in some Irrs and BCGs was rst suggested by 22 and then conrmed by several other
modellers see Table 1 as a sort of deus ex machina able to overcome the problem that the

the left panel The average observational error bar is shown in the bottom right corner of each
models overpredicted the metal abundances of these systems for whatever combination of the
other free parameters The advantage of the winds is that they can remove the elements in
excess without signicantly altering the other quantities This obviously does not imply that
galactic winds actually occur but the comparison of the observed quantities with the predictions
of models with various wind assumptions can at least tell how the outows should be
3 Description of specic models
Some years ago we 23 and 21 computed a series of numerical models with the combined
goals of reproducing the observed features of a large sample of Irrs and BCGs and of testing
the range of acceptable values for the theoretical parameters These models assumed a bursting
mode of SF ie short episodes of intense activity separated by long quiescent phases adopted
several IMFs with varying slope andor upper and lower mass cutos and allowed for two
types of gas outows triggered by SNeII explosions dierential winds ie able to remove from
the galaxy only the elements synthesized and ejected by the SNeII or well mixed winds ie
able to remove from the galaxy a fraction of all the elements present in the interstellar medium
around the SNe
Figure 1 shows the predictions of Marconi et als 1994 21 models for the He vs O
and the NO vs O abundance ratios compared with the corresponding values derived from
observational data Models adopting no galactic wind at all are represented by the short-
dashed line even with only two bursts of SF oxygen is so overproduced that the line falls well
outside the observational ranges of both distributions and out of the graph in the left panel
and there is no way to bring it within the empirical range of values by varying SF andor IMF
This is why in 1985 we 23 introduced winds in our models If a well mixed outow ejecting
all the elements in the same proportions is assumed solid line in Figure 1 the predicted
oxygen abundances are lower and consistent with the data but He and N are reduced as well
It can be seen from the two panels that for nitrogen this leads to a satisfactory agreement
with the data but helium turns out to be always underabundant and below the observational
range whatever the assumptions on the other free parameters If instead a dierential wind
is assumed ejecting O but not He and N that are not produced by SNeII we can properly
reduce the O abundance without aecting too much either He or N and predict abundances
consistent with the corresponding data By varying the wind eciency as well as the number
andor the intensity of SF episodes the models can span the whole observational ranges of
both distributions
By running a large number of model cases 23 and 21 reached the following conclusions
a each galaxy has a SF and wind history dierent from the others b for most Irrs and BCGs
the number of SF bursts does not exceed 710 but some can have sustained 1 or 2 bursts at
most eg IZw18 c the SF bursts have short duration  108yr whereas the inter-burst
phases last several Gyrs d the IMF is generally universal and around Salpeters slope Similar
results have been recently obtained by Bradamante et al 1998 2 with an updated version
of the same code and are described in this volume
It is worth emphasizing that all the computed models predict a YO within each indi-
vidual galaxy far from being linear Qualitatively there is rst a shallow YO slope when
all the O produced in a burst is ejected together with the amount of He produced by massive
stars but when the lower mass stars which are He but not O producers start to die and to
contribute to the enrichment He goes up very quickly while O remains stable Quantitatively
this trend is aected by the adopted eciency of the winds and of the SF but is the natural
result of the dierent lifetimes of the element producers in the context of discontinuous star
formation and is therefore typical of all dwarfs Nonetheless since the observational data on He
and O refer to many galaxies with dierent evolutions what can be safely derived is only the
average YO of the whole galaxy sample In this situation I believe that a linear t to the
observed values remains the best statistical approach to infer the average empirical YO
In 1993 Pilyugin 27 reached very similar conclusions on the evolutionary conditions of
these galaxies with completely independent models He assumed strongly discontinuous SF
allowed for the existence of galactic winds and considered also the eect of the HII region
self-enrichment This phenomenon is due to the fact that when the SNe of a SF burst start
to explode they pollute only the gas of their own HII region and not all the surrounding
medium thus the HII region abundance increases while that of the interstellar medium remains
unaltered Only after a while when the HII region mixes with the external gas and enriches
it its abundance is diluted and decreases while that of the interstellar medium goes up As a
result of this phenomenon Pilyugin predicts that the evolution of element abundances in HII
regions has a saw-tooth shape that appears also in the behaviour of the element abundance
ratios
By comparing his model predictions with the observed distributions of He vs O and NO
vs O Pilyugin 27 found that taken alone the phenomenon of HII region self-enrichment is
sucient to reproduce N and O but not He whose predicted values as a function of N and O
turned out always much lower than observed Only by introducing dierential galactic winds
was he nally able to reproduce the observed distributions of all the three elements He also
concluded that Salpeters IMF is appropriate for Irrs and BCGs
Carigi et al
1995 3 computed somewhat dierent models for a sample of Irrs and
BCGs since they assumed that the SF in these systems is continuous and follows a law similar
to that normally attributed to the solar neighbourhood They also adopted dierential galactic
winds and tested various IMFs As major constraints for their models they considered three
observational quantities the YO relation the CO ratio and the Z-C-OO ratio where
Z is the total metallicity Carbon is a useful element to model since it is produced mainly
by intermediate mass stars but also by massive stars Before the advent of the Hubble Space
Telescope no reliable measures of C in extragalactic HII regions were available and Carigi et
al were the rst who could use such data Carigi et al found that the only models able to
simultaneously reproduce all these constraints are those assuming an age of the galaxies of at
least 10 Gyr a high eciency of the winds and a steep slope of the IMF at the low mass end
In particular they suggested that 23 of the SN ejecta should be lost forever through the wind
and that the slope of the IMF for M  05M is 225 ie similar to the extrapolation of
Salpeters but quite steeper than that attributed to solar neighbourhood stars eg 17

Table 1 provides a chronological overview of the conclusions that can be found in the liter-
ature for the IMF SF mode and galactic winds in irregulars of various types All these results
are derived from the comparison of chemical evolution models predictions with the observed
galactic features
Table 1 shows that most of the results derived by dierent authors are in agreement with each
other It is interesting to notice however that what is found from studies of the two Magellanic
Clouds MC is somewhat dierent from what is found for dwarf Irrs and BCGs For instance
the episodes of SF activity in the MC are several Gyr long whereas those attributed to BCGs
are at least one order of magnitude shorter Galactic winds appear absolutely necessary in
dwarfs whereas there is no obvious need in the MC Is this dierence real or articial and due
for instance to the fact that the MC are known in more details  And if real is it due to the
fact that BCGs behave dierently from Magellanic Irrs and large samples are dominated by
BCGs or to the fact that the LMC is much more massive and large than average Irrs 
With these questions in mind the results from Table 1 can be summarized as follows
 The IMF is in general the same everywhere with slope around Salpeters which means
atter than that in the solar neighbourhood for high mass stars and steeper for very low
mass stars
 Dierential galactic winds are necessary but with varying eciencies inversely propor-
tional to the galactic mass so that in massive galaxies like the LMC they may be absent
 The SF is probably discontinuous but the signicance of the discontinuity remains to be
assessed specially in bigger galaxies like the LMC
To have a better insight of the issues related to the galactic winds and to the SF mode it
is worthwhile to examine these aspects in some further detail

4 Galactic winds
From the chemical evolution models described in the previous section it appears that galactic
winds are necessary to explain the evolution of most but not all irregulars These were model
results with no previous support on either observational or theoretical ground In the last few
years however there has been an increasing evidence in favour of the wind occurrence both
from observations and from theory First of all the high velocity laments observed in H
UV and X-rays in several galaxies eg NGC1569 NGC1705 NGC4449 IZw18 36 24 4
have all been interpreted in terms of gas escaping from the parent galaxy Moreover winds are
theoretically predicted by hydrodynamical studies of the SN ejecta in the interstellar medium
typical of Irrs and BCGs eg 6 20 5
DErcole and Brighenti 5 are currently performing a detailed study of the hydrodynamics
of the SN ejecta in NGC1569 They have adopted the literature values for Mg11 108 M
and Mt33108 M 16 and for the recent SFR05 Myr1 11 This SF implies that
approximately 30000 SNe have exploded during 30 Myr ejecting  106 M of their own gas
They have then numerically followed the fate of these 106 M of gas in the interaction with the
interstellar and intergalactic media Figure 2 shows the results of their computations for the
distribution with galactocentric distance of the gas density The various grey levels correspond
to the gas density in logarithmic scale in the sense that the darker the denser and white
indicates empty regions The model predictions are illustrated at four dierent epochs after
the beginning of the SF activity 10 Myr in the top left panel 30 Myr ie 20 Myr after the
previous plot in the top right panel 70 Myr in the bottom left panel and 100 Myr in the
bottom right panel
A few million years after the onset of the SF activity the SNe start to explode so that at 10
Myr top left panel the whitening of the blowing bubble is already distinguishable toward the
galactic center while the remaining gas of the galaxy still maintains the original distribution
At 30 Myr ie at the end of the SF episode the superbubble has already been able to go
through the galaxy and to expand in the surrounding medium thus creating top right panel
the typical lamentary distribution observed in NGC1569 and other Irrs At 70 Myr the energy
input has stopped since 40 Myr and part of the escaped gas is already falling back into the
galaxy as visible from the dark condensations at the sides of the superbubble in the bottom left
panel At 100 Myr the situation has eventually settled down with some gas having denitely
left the galaxy and the rest having fallen back From these models the estimated amount of
gas returning into the galaxy is 105 M ie only 10 of that blown out by the SNe the
remaining 90 is lost forever Notice that what is lost is only gas from the SN ejecta not from
the interstellar medium thus supporting the dierential wind case suggested by many chemical
evolution models The total amount of matter escaping from NGC1569 is only 1100 of its
108M gas mass
NGC1569 is a Magellanic irregular with average mass and size but outstanding SF which
implies an unusual energy release in a modest potential well It can therefore be considered as
an extreme case of high wind eciency However these hydrodynamical results show that even
in more normal Irrs winds of possibly lower strength may easily occur
5 Star Formation Regime
It was clear right after the rst studies of BCGs that their blue colours low metallicities and
high gas contents were conceivable only if these galaxies are undergoing intermittent and
unusually intense bursts of SF Searle et al 1973 30 separated by long quiescent phases
The discovery of an underlying old population in most Irrs and BCGs eg
14 has shown
that these galaxies have not started to form stars only recently and has therefore reinforced
the intermittent SF hypothesis The same discovery however has also introduced some doubts
over this scenario because some of these late type galaxies seem to have formed stars rather
continuously The overall scenario that one can currently draw from the literature on chemical
evolution models and stellar populations studies is that irregulars of dierent type may have
dierent SF regimes Very schematically the situation could be the following
 BCGs undergo bursting SF eg 30 15
 dwarf Irrs undergo gasping SF eg 32 with long but moderate activity separated by
short quiescent phases
 giant Irrs appear to have continuous SF eg 14 because the quiescent phases tend to
be too short to be appreciable
Figure 3 Star formation rate per unit area The top panels sketch the possible scenarios for
BCGs left and Magellanic Irrs right The bottom panels show the time distribution of the
SF rate as estimated in NGC1569 left 11 and LMC right 18 28 26
The above scheme can be visualized in the two panels of Figure 3 where the SF rates as a
function of time in BCGs top left and Magellanic Irrs top right is sketched To allow for a
more meaningful comparison the rate of SF is normalized per unit area
This scenario is appealing in what it supports at least qualitatively the hypothesis originally
proposed by Gerola et al 1980 8 with the theory of stochastic self-propagating SF in which
the bigger the galaxy the more continuous the SF In their theory in fact when a cell starts
forming stars it perturbs its neighbour cells in such a way that these start soon to form stars
as well Since a larger galaxy size implies a higher number of adjacent cells the corresponding
overall SF inevitably appears more continuous because there are higher probabilities that at
any time at least one cell will be active
Unfortunately the above scenario is denitely too simplistic when quantitatively compared
with the available data on well studied galaxies The bottom panels of Fig3 shows for instance
an average of the SF rates derived by various authors for the LMC 18 28 26 and NGC1569
15 11
The LMC is one of the largest and most massive irregulars and has most probably expe-
rienced a SF activity which is not continuous with two major episodes separated by a long
period of very low SF rate The actual rate in the two episodes and their separation may be
uncertain see also Pagel this volume but all authors favour the indicated scheme
NGC1569 is also a Magellanic irregular but its small size and mass eg 16 classify it as
a dwarf Irr It shows the strongest SF burst ever seen in a normal galaxy with an estimated
rate of at least 4 Myr1kpc2 11 one to four orders of magnitude higher than that derived
for Local Group dwarf Irrs This high activity makes NGC1569 one of the few local dwarfs
satisfying the requirements of Babul  Fergusons 1 model for nearby analogs of the faint
blue galaxies observed at redshift around 051 The question marks in the plot indicate that
some previous star formation activity should have occurred in NGC1569 as suggested eg by
35 from the possible presence of Asymptotic Giant Branch stars but it must have been very
modest It is obvious in fact from simple gas consumption arguments that the recent high
activity cannot have taken place also in previous epochs otherwise NGC1569 would have run
out of gas long ago whereas 13 of its mass is still in gaseous form It is probable however that
much more modest episodes of SF have occurred in the past to justify its current metallicity
and stellar content
We thus face the situation that the prototype of giant irregulars has not the continuous SF
suggested by our hypothetical scenario and one of the best studied dwarf Irrs is not gasping
at all but has had what we would have rather taken as the paradigma of a BCG burst of SF 
6 Summarizing the situation 
From the above description of the results obtained from chemical evolution models of irreg-
ulars and BCGs I would conclude that we are now in the challenging condition of having a
qualitative scenario which works acceptably well for the overall sample of late type galaxies
but is unsatisfactorily inconsistent with detailed information on important individual systems
Fortunately in these last years we are seeing an incredible improvement in the quality of the ac-
quired data and on the technical tools available to interpret them I thus think that to improve
our understanding of galaxy evolution rather than to keep modelling large generic samples
of galaxies we should concentrate on single representative cases for which all the necessary
information can be obtained In this framework the suggested ow-chart of future evolution
models would be the following for each examined galaxy
1 get as much information as possible on the evolutionary parameters from observations
for instance recent IMF and SF by interpreting spectral and photometric data by means of
population synthesis models eg
gas ows from optical UV andor x-ray data eg 244 etc
10 and synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams eg
2 compute the hydrodynamics of the interstellar medium and SN ejecta in the conditions
of the examined galaxy
3 model the chemical evolution of the galaxy by including all the above data as input
In this way the chemical evolution models of each galaxy will be much better constrained
Once a statistically signicant sample of dwarfs will be treated in this way we will be able to
draw a really self-consistent scenario for the evolution of these systems and to safely infer their
average properties at high redshift
