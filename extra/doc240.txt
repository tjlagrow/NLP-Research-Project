INTRODUCTION
Early-type galaxies ETGs can be used to address several key questions of modern
cosmology and astrophysics  1 the cosmic history of galaxy mass assembly 2
the evolution of large scale structure 3 the evolution of galaxy clusters 4 the link
between supermassive black holes and host galaxies 5 the role of feedback in galaxy
formation 6 the physical origin of the Hubble morphological classes 7 the dark
energy equation of state using the evolution of the relative stellar ages
Although ETGs at z  0 are rather simple and homogeneous systems in terms of
morphology colors stellar population content and scaling relations 85 their formation
and evolution is still a debated question In the modern scenario of L CDM cosmology it
is expected that galaxies assembled their mass gradually through hierarchical merging
with most of the stellar mass in ETGs assembled at 0  z  1 with a mass-dependent
evolution which connes the assembly of the most massive ETGs at relatively low
redshifts 32 Two main approaches are possible to constrain the evolution of ETGs
 observing directly how their properties change as a function of redshift or deriving
indirectly the evolutionary properties of fossil ETGs at z  0 backward in cosmic
THE EVOLUTION AT 0  z  1
Recent results based on imaging andor spectroscopic surveys of ETGs at 0  z  1 are
converging on a scenario where the evolution of the distribution functions is strongly
luminosity- and mass-dependent
The luminosity and stellar mass functions show a very weak evolution from z  08 to
z  0 for luminous massive galaxies but they evolve much faster for lower mass systems
45 4 37 113 17 11 93 14 82 47 40 20 12 83 15 84 3 24 In particular while the
number density of luminous massive ETGs with MBz0  205 M  1011 M is
nearly constant since z  08 ie when the Universe had 50 of its present age less
luminous ETGs display a decit which grows with redshift This can be explained with a
gradual population of the ETG red sequence 4 by the progressive suppression of star
formation in galaxies less massive than  1011M At each redshift there is a critical
mass above which the majority of ETGs appear to be in place 20 15 Clearly this
scenario does not exclude some residual evolution in the assembly of massive ETGs but
the fractional contribution of this evolution is relatively small For instance a study of the
colors of a sample of ETGs at 05  z  1 showed that luminous 23  MV  205
and less luminous galaxies formed respectively 10-15 and 30-60 of their mass
since z  1 59 The above studies rely on the estimate of the so called photometric
stellar masses However it is reassuring that stellar and dynamical masses of ETGs at
0  z  1 show a rather good agreement 50 16 86 34 36
The evolution of ETGs at 0  z  1 ts well in the general downsizing scenario
25 51 where galaxy evolution depends on the mass with the most massive systems
reaching the completion of star formation and assembly rst while less massive ones
have a more prolonged star formation extended to later cosmic times
Several other additional evidences support the downsizing scenario
 The typical mass-to-light ratio of luminous ETGs is signicantly larger than that
of the fainter ones implying short star-formation timescales andor high formation
redshifts for the massive population eg 45 116 see also 16
 The evolution of the Fundamental Plane indicates that the bulk of stellar populations
formed at z f  2 and z f  1 for high- and low-mass ETGs respectively The fraction of
stellar mass formed at recent times ranges from 1 for M  10115M to 20-40
below M  1011M with no major difference between the evolution of massive eld
and cluster ETGs 108 34 115 116
 The differential evolution of the color-magnitude relation of eld ETGs 103
 Low mass galaxies show larger SSFR ie SFRM  than higher mass galaxies at
all redshifts and the SSFR for massive galaxies increases by  10 at z  2 42 58
number density of massive galaxies with strong Hd absorption since z  1 68 118
 The evolution of spectral features in galaxy spectra and the rapid decrease of the
Complementary studies of ETGs at 0  z  1 based on gravitational lensing and stellar
dynamics show a remarkable homogeneity of the internal structures and mass density
proles and together with the stellar population constraints support the scenario with
most of the massive systems being already in place at z  1 90 64
Constraints from ETGs at z  0
Several studies derived indirectly the evolution by reconstructing the past history of
fossil ETGs at z  0 based on spectral analysis Lick indices a Fe and SED tting
see 85 for a review It is remarkable that the majority of the results obtained with this
approach are now in broad agreement with those obtained for ETGs at 0  z  1 and
support the downsizing scenario eg 104 49 50 89 57 For instance the analysis
of a large sample of ETGs selected from the SDSS showed that the objects with larger
masses have older stellar populations and the most massive ones formed more than 90
of their current stellar mass at redshift z  25 57
However not all the results on ETG evolution at 0  z  1 fully agree with each
other eg 94 Part of the discrepancies can be due to the biases which may affect
the selection of ETG samples eg 110 andor the use of stacked data which may
include heterogeneous objects Typical examples are represented by the contamination
of red sequence ETGs by dust-reddened galaxies andor by systems with low residual
star formation activity which may strongly affect the colors and the spectra It is well
known that a few percent of young stars can change dramatically the colors and spectra
of ETGs even if the bulk of the mass is made by old stars eg 107
The inuence of the environment
Several studies investigated the dependence of the ETG evolution on the environment
In general the scaling relations of ETGs persist in low density environments but show a
larger scatter than in dense regions and clusters and ETGs in clusters are 1-2 Gyr older
than in the eld eg 6 104 50 23 This is interpreted as the consequence of a more
complex and prolonged star formation and assembly history of eld ETGs However
the environment seems to have a weaker inuence on evolution than ETG mass 50 15
THE EVOLUTION AT 1  z  3
The results outlined in the previous sections indicate that the critical redshift range where
the strongest evolution and assembly of massive ETGs took place is at 1  z  3 see
also 1 At these redshifts ETGs are usually identied in pure ux-limited samples
eg K20 GDDS GMASS or using color selections such as the passive-BzK pBzK
14  z  25 27 or the Distant Red Galaxy DRG criterion z  2 48 However
the information available at these redshifts is much more fragmentary than at z  1 This
is mostly due to the difculty to identify spectroscopically large samples of ETGs as they
become rapidly very faint and the most prominent spectral features are redshifted to the
near-infrared where spectroscopy is usually prohibitive with the current telescopes
The ETGs identied spectroscopically so far up to z  25 are characterized by very
red colors R  K  5  6 passively evolving old stellar populations with ages of 1-
4 Gyr e-folding timescales t 0103 Gyr where SFRt cid181
exptt  very low
dust extinction stellar masses M  1011M and strong clustering with r0  810 Mpc
38 99 19 54 75 28 91 69 63 65 72 21 26 44 63 41 Preliminary estimates
indicate that the number density of massive ETG photometric pBzK candidates at
14  z  25 is 20 of that at z  0 63 However due to the strong clustering and
the consequent high cosmic variance more wide-eld surveys are needed to constrain
stringently the luminosity and mass functions of ETGs at z  1
Another property which characterizes ETGs at z  1 is their compact structure 28
with sizes Re  1 kpc much smaller than in present-day ETGs  Several studies have
conrmed this property and showed that Re is typically smaller by a factor of 2-3
than at z  0 implying that the stellar mass surface and volume internal densities are
up to 10 and 30 times larger respectively 109 121 70 105 112 21 13 117
The rest-frame B-band Kormendy relation shows a large offset 2-3 mag in effective
surface brightness with respect to the local relation This is difcult to explain with
simple passive luminosity evolution models and requires that these superdense ETGs
should somehow increase their size in order to match the local Kormendy relation at
z  0 eg 70 21 92 Surprisingly the majority of ETGs at slightly lower redshifts
07  z  12 does not show such compact sizes It is unclear how to explain these size
properties in the context of ETG evolution and subtle observational biases eg surface
brightness dimming and SN ratio effects should not be completely excluded yet
The comparison between eld and cluster ETGs at z  1 55 87 shows that cluster
ETGs at z 12 formed the bulk of their stars 05 Gyr earlier than ETGs in the eld
at the same redshift whereas eld ETGs terminated to form their stellar content on a
longer time scale Such a difference is particularly evident at masses M  1011M
whereas it becomes negligible for the most massive ones However cluster and eld
ETGs at z 12 follow comparable sizemass relation and have analogous surface stellar
mass densities and lie on the same Kormendy relation A proposed interpretation is that
while the formation epoch of ETGs depends mostly on their mass the environment does
regulate the timescales of their star formation histories implying that the last episode of
star formation must have happened more recently in the eld than in the cluster 87
ETGs at z  1 have been found also in high density regions up to z  15 16 66 76
These overdensities might represent protoclusters observed before virialization
The existence of a substantial population of old massive passively evolving ETGs up
to z  25 was not expected in the galaxy formation models available in 2004 19 54
This raised the critical question on how it was possible to assemble such systems when
the Universe was so young A promising mechanism is the AGN feedback which in
addition to that of SNe would allow the rapid suppression quenching of the star
formation during the formation of massive ETGs at high redshifts eg 56 77 98 31
EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES AT z  3 
Following the claim of an old galaxy at z65 78 ETG-like candidates at z  3
have been searched in deep near- and mid-infrared surveys However at these redshifts
the current studies have to rely only on photometric redshifts and SED tting analysis
because spectroscopy is unfeasible Due to the degeneracies in the SED tting analysis
most of the ETG candidates at z  3 can be either heavily dust-enshrouded starbursts or
oldpassive galaxies 39 88 119 71
However a small fraction does not show degeneracies and is formally consistent
with being massive galaxies M  1011 M at z  4  5 with low dust extinction
and the oldest ages allowed for these redshifts ie up to 1 Gyr If conrmed by
future studies eg JWST ELTs this population of massive evolved galaxies would
contribute signicantly to the total stellar mass density at z  4  5 88 71
HOW DID MASSIVE EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES FORM 
The properties of ETGs illustrated in previous sections indicate that the massive systems
formed at z  2 with very short timescales Examples of precursor candidates have been
found amongst starburst galaxies selected at z  2 with a variety of techniques sBzK
27 submmmm 18 DRG 48 optically-selected systems with high luminosity 97
IRAC Extremely Red Objects IEROs 114 HyperEROs 106 and ULIRGs at z  1 3
selected with Spitzer Space Telescope 7
Deep integral-eld near-IR spectroscopy sometimes assisted by Adaptive Optics is
being used by observing redshifted Ha emission as a kinematic tracer and to perform
detailed studies of these precursor candidates eg 100 46 120 67 The most detailed
studies of massive star-forming galaxies at z  2 show sometimes the existence of mas-
sive rotating disks with high velocity dispersion These systems may become unstable
and lead to the rapid formation of massive spheroids Although the samples of z  2
galaxies observed with this approach are still rather small the analysis of the kinematic
criteria kinemetry suggests that 50 have kinematics consistent with a single ro-
tating disk while the remaining systems are more likely undergoing major mergers
The emerging scenario indicates that in addition to merging also secular evolution and
smooth accretion of gas play a role in building up disks and massive spheroids at high
redshifts even without major mergers 52 96 53
TOWARDS AN OVERALL PICTURE 
If all the current observational constraints are taken into account a possible picture for
the formation and evolution of massive ETGs could be outlined as follows Fig 1
1 A large fraction of massive star-forming galaxies selected in the opticalnear-IR
are gasrich disky systems characterized by a quiet evolution with long-lived star
formation eg 051 Gyr 29 30 supported in some cases by smooth accretion
of cold gas streams 60 33 These massive systems may later evolve into spheroids
through disk instabilities andor merging processes 52 53
2 The submillimeter galaxy SMG 8 100 phase corresponds to the cases of rapid
highly dissipative gas-rich major mergers 80 61 characterized by short-lived 01
Gyr starbursts 101 102 It is intriguing to notice that SMGs are the only star-forming
systems at z  2 having the same small sizes and high gas mass surface density of ETGs
at 1  z  2 101 102 If the compact superdense ETGs at 1  z  2 are the descendants
of SMGs the duty cycle timescale of the SMG phase can be estimated as the ratio of the
comoving number densities of the SMGs  105 Mpc3 95 18 and ETGs  104
Mpc3 and the amount of cosmic time available from z  25 to z  15 15 Gyr ie
015 Gyr This is broadly consistent with the e-folding timescale derived independently
from the SED tting and from the SMG molecular gas 101 102 AGN feedback would
then be required to quench the star formation eg 31 43 2 This could also explain
the origin of the relation between super-massive black hole and galaxy masses Although
the involved physical processes are different this scenario is somehow reminiscent of
the oldfashioned monolithic collapse
3 The compact superdense ETGs at 1  z  2 evolve by increasing gradually their
sizes A possible mechanism is major dissipationless dry merging 81 35 111 5
61 62 22 9 However it is unclear how the dry merging scenario can be reconciled
with the properties of the small-scale clustering of low-z ETGs 73 74 and with the
weak evolution of the highmass end of their stellar mass function at 0  z  07 Other
FIGURE 1 The variety of possible evolutionary paths for the formation of massive spheroidal galaxies
processes which may increase the sizes at z  1 are the smooth envelope accretion 79
and multiple frequent minor mergers 10
4 The majority of most massive ETGs reaches the assembly completion around
z 07-08 while lower mass ETGs continue to assemble down to lower redshifts
downsizing
Future studies of galaxies at 1  z  3 will allow a better understanding of the global
processes which lead to formation and evolution of ETGs
