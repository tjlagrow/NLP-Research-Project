Abstract Galaxies have clearly evolved since the universe was 1 Gyr old but
methods to trace and quantify this evolution are still in their infancy In this paper
I demonstrate that with the careful use of a physical morphology it is possible
to determine quantitatively how the process of galaxy evolution is occurring out
to z  4 Using a system of parameters that traces star formation and galaxy
interactions I show how distinct galaxy populations at high-z can be identied in
deep high-resolution optical and NIR images These tools are also used to measure
a potential merger fraction of galaxies from 0  z  4 If these methods are reliable
as is suggested by a local galaxy calibration the merger fraction of galaxies scales
 1z2105 peaks near z  2 and declines thereafter I also discuss how this
system is likely part of the ultimate physical classication of galaxies
1 Introduction
Although it is largely misunderstood and often misused galaxy morphology
is becoming a powerful tool for learning how galaxies form and evolve The
Hubble Space Telescope now allows us to study high-resolution deep elds of
distant galaxies yet nding a way to utilize this information is not obvious
or simple
The dominate paradigm for understanding galaxies is still largely based on
the Hubble Sequence 14 and its various revised forms Hubble classications
are useful for describing the gross properties of nearby galaxies that are for
the most part in quiescent star formation and dynamical states Even in
this situation Hubble types correlate with physical properties such as color
and star formation rates only in the mean 21 This is due to the fact that
Hubble types do not consider recent star formation in its classication nor
do interacting or merging properties factor into a Hubble type Because the
merger rate of galaxies in the local universe is  3 20 and since recent star
formation for nearby galaxies is also low 18 the Hubble sequence is eective
in the mean for identifying nearby galaxy populations
The subjective Hubble morphological system is frankly inadequate at high
redshift eg 16 Too many galaxies at high-z fall in the catch-all irregular
or peculiar class It is not yet understood if these unusual looking galaxies
are true irregulars forming stars stochastically or if they are starbursts trig-
gered by some process perhaps galaxy mergers In this paper I will present
preliminary work showing how high-z galaxies seen in deep optical and NIR
images can be classied by understanding and quantifying star formation and

merging properties based on their structures I also demonstrate how these
tools can be used to perhaps trace the merger fraction of galaxies out to
z  4
2 Fundamental Parameters and Nearby Galaxy
Calibration
A truly physical morphology must correlate the way a galaxy looks either
through its structure or spectrum with internal physical properties The
physical morphological system being developed by Conselice et al 5678
and Bershady et al 2 thus far can distinguish the fundamental proper-
ties of star formation and galaxy interactionsmergers Figure 1a shows the
color-asymmetry diagram CAD a diagnostic tool used to calibrate these
properties using nearby galaxies including the Frei sample 12 supplemented
by WIYN 35m images of starburst galaxies The galaxies at A  035 are
all consistent with merging systems based on their broad HI line proles 8
The starbursts with A  035 NGC 3310 and NGC 7678 have well dened
spiral patterns and whose starburst trigger was likely a bar instability or in
the case of NGC 3310 a minor merger in the distant past 8 The CAD is
therefore useful to quantify and trace the presence of not only interacting
galaxies but ones undergoing mergers
Fig 1 a Nearby galaxy color-asymmetry diagram from Conselice et al 78 La-
beled galaxies are those consistent with an interaction or merger with all galaxies
with A 035 having dynamical evidence for mergers 8 b Color-asymmetry dia-
gram for galaxies in the HDF with A computed in the rest-frame B band
The CAD is also useful for tracing star formation in galaxies although
high-frequency structure ltering techniques will likely turn out to be more

useful The CAD ducial sequence the dotted line in Figure 1a is likely a
star formation sequence As the star formation rate in a galaxy increases
it becomes bluer and more asymmetric due to the increase of localized star-
forming regions It is important to note that even galaxies whose morphologies
are dominated by star formation such as the irregular NGC 4449 do not
have asymmetries that mimic the very high asymmetry produced by merging
78 Although this calibration is limited by the small samples used the fact
remains that the only galaxies with A  035 are mergers This is consistent
with other studies that demonstrate galaxies with the highest asymmetries
are merging systems 23
3 The Evolution of Galaxy Populations to z  4
Do galaxies form by the merging of other galaxies How important is rapid
collapse in the galaxy formation process 19 The consensus is that merging
is the dominate process as shown in both semi-analytic and N-body modeling
within Cold Dark Matter dominated cosmologies 15224 Finding a direct
method of proving this beyond circumstantial evidence such as evolving lu-
minosity functions at high-z 16 remains a key observational challenge
We can investigate this by the use of CADs measured at high-z Several
caveats must be stated before explaining the results of using quantitative fea-
tures such as asymmetry at high-z An advantage for astronomers studying
galaxy evolution is the ability to study distant and hence young galaxies
Thus we can directly compare properties of young and old galaxies to deter-
mine evolution This is easier said then done however due to cosmological
eects and biases When measuring the same parameters at high and low-z
zeroth-order features such as magnitudes and colors can be measured with
some certainly by correcting for cosmological k-corrections and dimming
Higher order features even simple measurements such as radii are much
harder to measure reliably To robustly determine these features at high-z
requires simulating low-z galaxies at high-z to determine how parameters
change when images are degraded in resolution and have higher noise lev-
els This is especially important for measuring morphological or structural
features Conselice et al 7 show that within certain limits achievable with
deep HST images the asymmetry parameter measured on HDF galaxies with
mB  25 should reproduce the same values measured if the galaxies were
nearby
For the low-z HDF range 01  z  05 Figure 1b there are some
galaxies with asymmetries consistent with mergers There is also evidence
for a possible correlation between asymmetry and color as seen in the nearby
galaxy sample There are no symmetric red galaxies in this redshift range
This is largely the result of a bias introduced by the small HDF eld of
view and the fact that the HDF was chosen to avoid any bright galaxies
that in the nearby universe are typically red At the moderate redshift range
Christopher J Conselice
05  z  15 there are some red and symmetric galaxies Figure 1b and
there is an increase in the presence of systems consistent with merging At
the highest redshift range 15  z  25 we see an even higher fraction of
interactions and no galaxies consistent with red ellipticals
4 Merger Fractions
A fundamental aspect for understanding galaxy evolution is to constrain the
history of galaxy merging in the universe Galaxy pair studies indicate that a
high fraction of distant galaxies are likely interacting eg 2017 Dynamical
pair fractions also reveal that the merger fraction of galaxies increases to at
least z  1 with a rate  1z32 17 Dynamical pair studies are limited
by several factors the least of which is the inability to acquire spectroscopy
for large numbers of faint galaxies Perhaps a more important problem is the
fact that these galaxies are not necessarily merging systems but might be
grazing interactions or even galaxies in orbits with several Gyr merger time
scales Despite this dynamical pairs likely do measure some aspect of galaxy
merging
Fig 2 Observed merger fraction evolution with redshift The dashed line shows
the relationship f  003 1z21 tted out to z  2
Using the asymmetry parameters on high-z galaxies it is possible to
demonstrate how morphologically the merger fraction at each redshift evolves
by directly measuring the fraction of galaxies with structures consistent with
merging as a function of redshift Doing this for galaxies in the HDF-N we
obtain Figure 2 which shows the fraction of galaxies with rest-frame B-band
asymmetries consistent with mergers as a function of z using the criteria
A  035 MB  18 Also plotted on this gure is the merger fractions found
Morphological Evolution of Galaxies
from dynamical pair studies by Patton et al 20 and Le Fevre et al 17 If
we assume galaxies at these redshifts with A  035 are mergers then the
merger fraction increases as f  0031z2105 10 The merger fraction
also potentially begins to decline at redshifts higher than z  2 10
If the asymmetry parameter can indeed trace mergers out to these red-
shifts this preliminary observation is scientically exciting and suggests that
galaxy mergers are dominating the evolution of galaxies As is well known
the star formation rate of galaxies peaks at about this redshift 1811 as does
the presence of active galaxies 3 Are these eects and the mass assembly
of galaxies driven by mergers This morphological system suggests they are
demonstrating the power of galaxy classication when used and calibrated
properly
