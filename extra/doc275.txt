Abstract We show that the multiphase chemical evolution model reproduces the
correlations obtained along the spiral sequence dwarf galaxies included However the
apparent spatial chemical uniformity observed in some irregular galaxies cannot be
reproduced with it An evolutionary model has been developed and tested to explain
at gradients Preliminary results obtained with a new code including supernova winds
and radial ows suggest that radial ows are probably responsible for this uniformity
1 The multiphase model summary and generic results
The multiphase model has already been used for the solar neighborhood Ferrini
et al 1992 for both the Galactic bulge and disc Ferrini et al 1994 Molla 
Ferrini 1995 and for some nearby spiral galaxies Molla Ferrini  Daz 1996
hereinafter MFD96 The model starts with a sphere of primordial gas whose
total mass Mtot is calculated using rotation curves This mass collapses onto an
equatorial plane on a timescale 0 The sphere is divided into concentric cylin-
drical regions each of which having a halo and a disc zone The star formation
rate in the disc is considered a two step process First the diuse gas forms
molecular clouds at a rate which depends on the eciency  Then stars form
from cloud-cloud collisions with eciency h or by the interactions of massive
stars with molecular gas clouds with eciency a
When applied to dierent spiral galaxies MFD96 the characteristic values
of 0 and eciencies h and  change depending on the total mass of the galaxy
the Arm Class and the Hubble type respectively Radial distributions of oxygen
abundance atomic and molecular gas surface densities and star formation rates
which are used as constraints for the models are reproduced with larger 0 values
for less massive galaxies and eciencies  and smaller h values for later type
galaxies Thus star formation histories dier from galaxy to galaxy and from
region to region in a given galaxy Generic trends are consistent with observed
correlations for large spirals Vila-Costas  Edmunds 1992 Zaristky Kennicutt

2 The model for the low-mass end of the spiral sequence
Recently obtained data on low-mass and dwarf galaxies show that these trends
are maintained low-mass irregular galaxies and large spirals fall on the same

Wishing to see if the multiphase model reproduce these correlations we sim-
ulated dwarf galaxies as unevolved systems low in luminosity and irregular in
their optical appearance a star formation rate which does not follow the spiral
wave but with recent bursts low metallicities blue colors and high gas fractions
We chose smaller values of  and h than those used for NGC 598 and NGC 300
the latest type galaxies modeled by MFD96 For low-mass galaxies 0 is larger
due to the smaller total mass
Fig 1 The maximum rotation velocity Vmax vs MB Open symbols are the data taken
from HOF96 and from BR97 Filled circles are the multiphase model results
Using these models we investigated the behavior along the whole spiral se-
quence Dynamical masses have larger values for outer disc regions The ratio
MdarkMlum is higher for low-mass galaxies than for large spirals and it increases
with radius These eects are reected by the multiphase model in leading to
longer 0 when the total mass is lower this timescale is assumed to be increasing
with radius The correlation observed between the maximum rotation velocity
Vmax and the total magnitude MB is reproduced by the multiphase models
Figure 1 The model results represent a range of galaxy types from the earlier
type galaxy NGC 224 T  3 to the intermediate type galaxies NGC 628 and
NGC 6946 T  5 6 the later type galaxies NGC 598 and NGC 300 T  6 7
and nally the magellanic irregular galaxy NGC 1313 T  8
Other correlations refer to gas quantities and total magnitudes or luminosi-
ties The relation between the gas fraction fB and MB is shown in Figure 2a
While being less massive galaxies with lower luminosities have lower absolute
gas mass but have the largest gas mass fraction Spiral galaxies with lower lumi-
nosities are also those with later morphological types It results in a correlation
between fB and the Hubble type T

ZKH94 RMC95 RB95 and GSSSD97 Lines correspond to our models for each type
of galaxies
There are two other known facts 1 early type galaxies have higher abun-
dances in their discs than later type ones 2 radial gradients are steeper in
late-type galaxies than in early-type ones Both results are reproduced by mod-
els in Figure 3 Fig 3a shows the characteristic OH abundances open symbols
versus T in Fig 3b radial gradients are plotted against T A trend of steeper
radial gradients with less evolved and later type galaxies is obvious
Therefore most of the characteristics of low-mass irregular and normal large
spirals are reproduced by the multiphase model based on rather simple physical
assumptions For example the total mass of a galaxy denes the rate of collapse
and disc formation The star formation rate depends on the gas mass fraction
in the disc and also on the arm class or morphological type The more massive
galaxies evolve more rapidly and reach higher abundances quickly The less mas-
sive galaxies take longer to form the disc and some of them are just now reaching
their peak star formation in their centers this leads to a steep radial gradient of
abundances due to the production of oxygen in this region It is also possible to
have two galaxies with similar total masses but dierent types of spiral density
wave allowing dierent star formation histories This could explain the large
dispersion of the data in most of the correlations

3 The abundance uniformity in dwarf galaxies
However radial gradients disappear when spiral structures no longer exists Ed-
munds  Roy 1993 While in normal galaxies radial gradients steepen for later
type galaxies the low mass irregular galaxies show a large uniformity of abun-
dances over their discs This is dicult to understand especially because a burst
of star formation is generally occuring in their centers Skillman Dohm-Palmer
 Kobulnicky 1998 and references therein
For example the galaxy NGC 1313 considered as a galaxy in transition
between a magellanic type and a normal spiral such as the Sc galaxies NGC 598
M 33 or NGC 300 and similar to both in total mass shows a at radial gradient
of oxygen abundance Walsh  Roy 1997 By choosing eciencies smaller than
those chosen for NGC 598 and NGC 300 and a similar collapse timescale the
multiphase model see Molla  Roy 1999 for details produces a steep radial
gradient contrary to what is observed If we assume a constant R to take
into account that it is an irregular galaxy without a strong spiral wave system
a at radial gradient is obtained but the theoretical star formation radial prole
 R is much atter than observed The only way to reproduce the observed
 R is to have a burst of star formation in the center of the galaxy But then
OH is higher than observed and the radial gradient steepens
This is a well known problem and some solutions have been suggested see
Kobulnicky  Skillman 1996 to explain why the heavy elements may not be
observed in regions with young massive stars The global star formation con-
spiracy is not valid with a maximum for  R in the center We have developed
a new version of the multiphase chemical evolution model which allows mass
loss by supernova SN explosion winds and the possibility of mass exchanges
between regions As a rst test we simulated selective mass loss the oxygen
goes to a hot phase and remains there for a time the hidden ejecta hypothe-

sis or it is expelled into the halo at large galactocentric distances to fall back
later onto other disc regions following Charlton  Salpeter 1996 Preliminary
results indicate that this scenario does not work the star formation increases in
the center without increasing OH but only for early epochs Morever the
 R prole has the same shape than before and the gas density ends up lower
than observed
Until now the multiphase model has not included the eect of radial ows
induced by central bars Barred galaxies have atter radial abundance gradients
than normal spirals see Roy 1996 and there is a direct relation between the
bar strength and the the radial gradient amplitude When a bar appears ra-
dial ows of gas are produced by the non-axisymmetric gravitational potential
These ows mix the interstellar medium and atten the radial gradient over a
timescale of 1 Gyr Friedli Benz  Kennicutt 1994 Edmunds  Greenhow
1995 Therefore irregular and magellanic type galaxies may have or have had
a bar For NGC 1313 this possibility is appropriate to explain the at gradient
and the star formation with a maximum in the center the gradient can become
at assuming a radial ow of gas with a mean eective velocity of  20 kms
lasting a few Gyr 2-3 Gyr and having started about 5 Gyr ago when the
galaxy was 8 Gyr old We are now exploring this scenario with a new model
which allows the exchange of matter between radial zones
