Abstract
The Thermally-Pulsating Asymptotic Giant Branch TP-AGB phase of stellar
evolution has received attention only recently in galaxy evolution but is now an im-
portant player in our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve Because it is a
short but very luminous phase bright in the near-IR where dust eects are small the
TP-AGB phase is a powerful tracer of intermediate-age stars in galaxies up to high red-
shift The spectral signature of TP-AGB stars as dened by population synthesis models
has been detected by the SpitzerSpaceTelescopein high-redshift galaxies whose spec-
tra show an amazing similarity to spectra of local stellar populations Even accounting
for the high uncertainty aecting the theoretical modelling of this phase stellar popu-
lation models including the TP-AGB have leveraged a better determination of galaxy
ages and hence stellar masses fundamental quantities for studying galaxy formation
and evolution They have also improved the results of semi-analytic models which can
better reproduce colours and the K-band luminosity function of high-z galaxies
1 Background Stellar Population Models and Galaxy Evolution
Stellar population models are the tool to perform galaxy evolution studies as they pre-
dict the integrated spectrophotometric properties of arbitrary populations of stars as a
function of parameters such as age chemical composition star formation history ini-
tial mass function stellar mass etc Their usage is twofold they allow the derivation
of galaxy properties from data on observed galaxies and they are the ingredients for
calculating the predicted spectra of synthetic galaxies from galaxy formation models
see eg Baugh 2006 I will review results on both aspects focusing on the role played
by the Asymptotic Giant Branch AGB phase of stellar evolution  the protagonist of
this meeting  on our understanding of galaxy evolution
11 Model Basics
Stellar population models are calculated assuming 1 stellar evolution models which
provide the energetics at given stellar mass 2 stellar spectra for distributing the en-
ergetics at the various wavelengths and 3 a numerical algorithm to calculate the in-
tegrated spectral energy distribution SED This approach  which is based on stellar
evolution  is referred to as Evolutionary Population Synthesis EPS the foundations
of which are due to the pioneering work by Tinsley 1972 and Renzini 1981
Figure 1 illustrates the concept of EPS models and their development over the last
three decades The left-hand plot shows the theoretical HR diagram for a coeval popu-
lation of stars with dierent initial masses up to the tip of the Red Giant Branch RGB

ical HR diagram for a coeval population with blue and red lines indicating stars on
the Main Sequence MS and post-Main Sequence The inserts show a galaxy cluster
at redshift 06 and the spectrum of a MS star The integrated spectrum is calculated
by summing up the contribution by all mass bins following dierent techniques see
text Right The evolution of EPS models with respect to the inclusion of stellar
evolutionary phases The TP-AGB has been added last to population synthesis
The spectrum of the population is obtained by integrating the luminosity contribution
from stars of dierent masses convolved with the assumed initial mass function IMF
The integral can be performed using mass as the evolutionary variable as in the so-
called isochrone synthesis Bruzual  Charlot 1993 An alternative approach is based
on Renzinis fuel consumption theorem Renzini 1981 as in the models by Buzzoni
1989 and Maraston 1998 2005 hereafter M98 M05 and also by Marigo  Girardi
2007 for constraining the contribution of the TP-AGB in their stellar models In the
Maraston models the integration variable adopted in post-MS is the fuel ie the prod-
uct of luminosity and lifetime Fig 1 left This approach turned out to be particularly
useful for inserting a prescription for the TP-AGB in EPS models The right-hand
panel provides a historical overview over the evolution of these models which could
be viewed as the evolution in the number of major stellar phases that could be in-
cluded in the synthesis While at the end of the 1970s models could cover just the
base of the RGB Gunn et al 1981 during the 1990s the availability of large grids
of isochrones from the Padova group Bertelli et al 1994 allowed the inclusion of all
stellar phases up to the end of the Early-Asymptotic Giant Branch E-AGB Worthey
1994 Bruzual  Charlot 1993 Vazdekis et al 1996 2010 Fioc  Rocca-Volmerange
1997 Leitherer et al 1999 Schiavon 2007 or shortly after as in the models by Bruzual
 Charlot 2003 hereafter BC03
The TP-AGB was included in the Maraston models in a semi-empirical fashion
as described in the next Section Marigo et al 2008 extend the Padova isochrones
with their models for the TP-AGB after calibrating them with data as in the Maraston

models Mouhcine  Lancon 2003 present an implementation of TP-AGB based on
their own stellar models The reader is referred to the review by Lancon this volume
for further details on models and comparison to star clusters
12 TP-AGB in Integrated Models a Semi-empirical Approach
The theoretical modelling of the TP-AGB presents several well-known but challenging
aspects stemming from the pulsational regime the double-shell burning and especially
the strong mass loss aecting this phase Also complicated is the spectral modelling
especially during the carbon-rich phase These issues have traditionally hampered the
calculation of isochrones that could easily be implemented in population synthesis In
Figure 2 Modelling the TP-AGB with the fuel consumption theorem
order to overcome this situation and test the eect these luminous stars have on the
integrated properties of galaxies M98 attempted a semi-empirical approach The theo-
retical energetics in the TP-AGB phase for stellar models of several initial masses were
calibrated with the observed bolometric contribution by the TP-AGB in Magellanic
Cloud MC globular clusters GCs from Frogel et al 1990 Key to this calibration
is the fuel consumption theorem FCT Renzini 1981 see Eq in Figure 3 which ex-
presses the bolometric luminosity of a post-MS phase J in terms of the fuel ie equiv-
alent masses of H andor Helium at disposal for coreshell burning to a star of mass
equal to the turno mass MTO at the given population age Note that because the fuel is
calibrated with observations it automatically includes the otherwise unknown eect
from mass-loss The left-hand plot of Figure 2 shows the calibration of the bolometric
contribution of the AGB phase to the total as a function of the age of the population
Maraston
split into E-AGB and TP-AGB This calibration shows a peak contribution by the TP-
AGB phase in populations with ages  05  1 Gyr by up to 40 of the bolometric
contribution It is important to stress that stochastic uctuations in the number of bright
AGB stars per cluster which are due to the shortness of the TP-AGB phase  106yr
were minimised by averaging the TP-AGB contributions in GCs of similar age see
M98 for details Vertical error bars show the size of such stochastic uctuations Hor-
izontal error bars represent the uncertainty in GC ages which stem from the fact that
tracks with and without overshooting t the same turno with ages that dier by a few
hundred million years Girardi et al 1995 Ferraro et al 1995 2004 Note also that the
MC GCs are the most useful calibrators in this context as their metallicities and ages
 unlike more distant star clusters or galaxies  can be derived independently of stellar
population models

Eect of TP-AGB on the synthetic SED of population models
M05  following the availability of empirical spectra of C-rich and O-rich TP-
AGB stars from Lancon  Wood 2000  extended the modelling of M98 by calculat-
ing the full SED of population models of various ages and metallicities with the aim
of studying high-redshift galaxies Figure 3 left shows the eect of the TP-AGB on
the integrated SED The addition of luminous red stars increases the ux in the near-IR
compared to a model including only the E-AGB and the spectral absorptions typical of
TP-AGB stars become apparent The right-hand plot compares model SEDs from dif-
ferent authors not including the TP-AGB or adopting dierent prescriptions see M05
for details and references This plot helps understanding discrepant results that are ob-
tained on galaxies when dierent models together with data extending to the near-IR
rest-frame are used to derive galaxy properties

121 Caveats
There are a number of caveats intrinsic to the semi-empirical modelling namely the
onset age the energetics stochastic uctuations and metallicity eects
First the age at which the TP-AGB is held to be relevant is calibrated with the
ages of MC GCs which depend on the tracks adopted to derive them and also on the
tting method In the Maraston models the relevant age range is between 03 and 2
Gyr Fig 2 which stems from turno ages derived via classical non overshooting
tracks Recent work has conrmed this scale Mucciarelli et al 2006 Tracks with
overshooting make the peak age older by some hundred million years Girardi et al
1995 Marigo et al 2008 However there is not yet universal agreement on the actual
size of overshooting Moreover MC age tting that includes post-MS stars and not only
the turno pushes the ages of some MC GCs to even older values Kerber et al 2007
This older age scale was used by Pessev et al 2008 and Conroy  Gunn 2010 to
argue that the Maraston models are mis-calibrated but this  more than a conclusion 
is a tautology as the calibration depends on the adopted age scale
Stochastic uctuations in the number of bright AGB stars aect the observed
colours and magnitudes see Lancon this volume M98 used a representative aver-
age cluster for each age bin Fig 2 details in M98 so that there is probably little doubt
that the bolometric contribution of the TP-AGB can be up to 40  whereas the max-
imum age and the shape of the phase transition depends on the adopted age scale and
on the age binning
A further caveat regards the metallicity dependence of the energetics and stellar
spectra The Maraston models assume the theoretical scaling proposed by Renzini  Voli
1981 according to which a metal-rich population burns more TP-AGB fuel in form
of oxygen-rich stars than in carbon stars This trend of spectral type with metallicity
is conrmed by modern models eg Marigo et al 1996 though the quantitative scal-
ing may be dierent On the other hand the same empirical spectra are used which
involves the assumption that the main spectral features of the two types do not depend
on the initial chemical composition Lyubenova et al 2010 cast some doubt on this
assumption as they nd that the CO absorption measured in two MC GCs with ages
around 1 Gyr is lower than predicted by the M05 models while the integrated colours
of the same objects perfectly agree Their suggestion is that  due to the lower metal-
licity of the Magellanic Clouds with respect to our Galaxy and the stars observed by
Lancon  Wood  the spectral absorptions cannot be adequately modelled More data
will be interesting as the result is based on only two objects with the lowest SN
2 Why Real Galaxies Care about AGB Stars
The AGB phase is bright and well-populated in intermediate-age stellar populations
for a short period of time This makes it a powerful age indicator and generally a
useful tool to break the agemetallicity degeneracy which plagues the analysis of galaxy
spectra The high-redshift Universe is the best target for several reasons galaxies are
younger and the age spread between dierent stellar generations is smaller than in local
objects both facts helping to enhance the signal of the AGB phase in the spectra The
M05 models were motivated by the launch of NASAs SpitzerSpaceTelescope which
could sample the galaxy rest-frame near-IR spectrum  which hosts the signature of red
stars cf Fig 3  up to high redshift Maraston 2005 A large number of papers have

Figure 4 illustrates the eect of the TP-AGB on the tting of observed galaxy spectro-
photometry for galaxies at various redshifts and for local MC GCs
The right-hand plot shows the SED t for galaxy data at redshift  1 with M05
and BC03 models blue and red lines respectively The SED t is performed using
just the three bands i z J which sample the rest-frame spectrum up to  8000 
Longer wavelength data are added onto the best-t model without using them to further
constrain the t The M05 models with their prescriptions for the TP-AGB phase t
the rest-frame near-IR much better the other model lacking near-IR rest-frame ux
Note that the galaxy light-averaged ages obtained with the two models are dierent
namely the M05 models give younger ages Finally note that if one ts all six bands
simultaneously good solutions would be found for the BC03 models as well which
probably would yield older ageshigher metallicitieshigher dust content in essence
all model ingredients that help to give a higher ux in the near-IR One cannot avoid
noting however that the TP-AGB solution ts the whole spectrophotometry well The
left-hand panel shows a similar SED t for a galaxy stack at z  2 Note the strong
near-IR uxes of these galaxies that are best tted with models including a strong TP-

AGB The gure also includes a comparison with the models by Charlot  Bruzual in
preparation which adopt the Marigo et al 2008 isochrones Finally note the SED ts
of MC GCs from M05 The similarity between the spectra of small local objects and
distant massive galaxies with similar ages is suggestive of an overall similarity in the
stellar evolution of AGB stars born locally and in the distant Universe

Labels indicate age 
and stellar mass on the right Note that these galaxies were pre-selected to be mostly
passive and were found to be lacking dust re-emission hence the t with reddening
is a formal but probably not very realistic solution From Maraston et al 2006
We now illustrate why details of the TP-AGB modelling are critical for the deriva-
tion of galaxy properties Figure 5 shows the SED t of galaxies at redshift  2 for
the M05 red and the BC03 blue models In the left-hand panel reddening was not
included in the t Galaxy ages derived with the M05 models are lower because the
TP-AGB makes the galaxy red at a younger age whereas the BC03 models require
older ages with a pronounced RGB for matching the high near-IR uxes even if the
t is not equally good The older ages explain the higher masses The addition of red-
dening dilutes but does not remove the dierences Maraston et al 2006 found that
masses derived with M05 are on average  30 to 50  lower than those derived with
BC03 a gure that has been conrmed in several subsequent works It is important to
note that these galaxies have been found to have a negligible amount of dust Hence the
solutions with reddening are statistically good but perhaps not very realistic Similar
results can be found in the literature leading to the following conclusions models with
TP-AGB give lower ages lower stellar masses and lower dust content
Maraston
One may be tempted to conclude that a TP-AGB prescription as in M05 provides
good ts to galaxies over a wide redshift range This conclusion has been challenged
by Kriek et al 2010 who  based on their SED t of colour-dened post-starburst
galaxies with photometric redshifts over a broad redshift range 1 to 25  conclude
that M05 and Marigo et al 2008 overestimate the TP-AGB contribution while the
BC03 models work better It is not easy to reconcile this result with others - for exam-
ple Raichoor et al 2011 just conclude the opposite namely that M05 and Charlot 
Bruzual 2007 private communication t better than BC03 see also the next Section
Finally worth mentioning in the high-redshift context is the result by Kelson  Holden
2010 who  extending the M05 models longward to the K-band  nd that the con-
tribution of AGB stars to dust re-emission is signicant and aects the determination
of galaxy star-formation rates from 24 m data lowering the high values sometimes
derived for high-z galaxies with obvious impact on our understanding of galaxy evolu-
22 Local Galaxies in Integrated Light
Several types of galaxies in the local Universe are known to host signicant numbers
of AGB stars and this conference has an entire session devoted to resolved stellar
populations in nearby systems Here I will focus on results for the local Universe that
are obtained in integrated light For galaxies with star formation  or more generally
with stellar populations with ages around 1 Gyr  the modelling of the TP-AGB should
be relevant
For spiral galaxies MacArthur et al 2010 nd that the star formation histories
derived from optical spectroscopy with the BC03 models give predicted near-IR colours
that are too blue compared with the observed ones The correct colours matching the
observations are obtained with the M05 models because of their brighter TP-AGB
Eminian et al 2008 analyse the near-IR colours of a sample of  6000 galaxies from
SDSS and nd that galaxies with higher star formation rates have bluer optical colours
and redder near-IR colours which are better explained with models including the TP-
AGB phase such as M05 and CB07 rather than the BC03 ones Both conclusions are at
odds with the results by Kriek et al 2010 mentioned above From the spectroscopic
side Riel et al 2007 2008 obtained the near-IR spectra of SeyfertAGN-host galax-
ies and show that the spectral bumps in the near-IR can only be explained with the M05
models because they include empirical carbon- and oxygen-rich TP-AGB stars The
amount of TP-AGB fuel in the M05 model does not appear to be excessive Similarly
Miner et al 2011 measure C2 and other spectral features in the near-IR spectra of the
dwarf elliptical M 32 and the post-starburst galaxy NGC 5102 nding that ages ob-
tained with the M05 models are consistent with ages derived from the optical spectra
in the literature Moreover they nd that decreasing the TP-AGB fuel as suggested by
Kriek et al 2010 breaks this agreement J Miner private communication TP-AGB
stars even aect galaxy dynamics Rothberg  Fischer 2010 show that the measure-
ment of dynamical masses for merger remnants from CO absorptions is aected by the
choice of stellar population models and nd encouraging results using the M05 models
In years to come we shall see the full development of near-IR spectroscopy which will
greatly improve our knowledge on these issues

3 Why Semi-analytic Galaxies Care about AGB Stars
Recent works have shown that the TP-AGB prescriptions in stellar population models
adopted in galaxy formation models inuence the meaning of the comparison with ob-
servations In Tonini et al 2009 2010 we calculate semi-analitic models SAM with
dierent input stellar population models and compare them to data for high-z galax-
ies Figure 6 shows that the observed-frame theoretical colour-magnitude diagram of
semi-analytic galaxies at redshift 2 small red and cyan points is only able to match the
observations large black points when the input stellar population model includes the
TP-AGB phase left-hand panel This suggests that much of the well-known mismatch
between high-z data and traditional semi-analytic models SAMs right-hand panel
may be due to a light decit at given mass rather than to a mass decit
Figure 6
Observed-frame colour-magnitude diagram corresponding to rest-
frame K vs VK of redshift 2 galaxies from semi-analytic models small red and
cyan points from Tonini et al 2010 compared to observations large black circles
Henriques et al 2011 use several SAMs equipped with models with and with-
out the TP-AGB phase to understand the discrepancy with the observed near-IR high-z
galaxy luminosity function Figure 7 shows that SAM models with the M05 models
match the rest-frame near-IR luminosity function at high-redshift where the discrep-
ancy was pointed out Finally Fontanot  Monaco 2010 conclude that the observed
colours of Extremely Red Objects can be better matched by SAM models including a
bright TP-AGB
4 Concluding Remarks
The recent inclusion of the TP-AGB in stellar population models has had a signi-
cant impact on our understanding of real galaxies as well as of synthetic galaxies from
galaxy formation models Galaxies do care about AGB stars While the exact ener-
getics for the TP-AGB may still be debatable there is no doubt that several spectral
features as well as the spectral continuum in the near-IR can be better explained with
models including a substantial contribution up to 40 of the bolometric contribution

process in a cosmological sense depends on our understanding of stellar evolution
