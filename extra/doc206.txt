Abstract We present a study of HI-rich galaxies in the local universe
selected from blind emission-line surveys These galaxies represent the
emission-line counterparts of local damped Lyman- systems We nd
that the HI cross-section of galaxies is drawn from a large range of galaxy
masses below MH I  66 of the area comes from galaxies in the range 85
 Log MH I  97 Both because of the low mass galaxy contribution
and because of the range of galaxy types and luminosities at any given HI
mass the galaxies contributing to the HI cross-section are not exclusively
L spirals as is often expected The optical and near infrared counter-
parts of these galaxies cover a range of types from spirals to irregulars
luminosities from L to 001 L and surface brightnesses The range
of optical and near infrared properties as well as the kinematics for this
population are consistent with the properties for the low-z damped Ly-
absorbers We also show that the number of HI-rich galaxies in the lo-
cal universe does not preclude evolution of the low-z damped absorber
population but it is consistent with no evolution
INTRODUCTION
The damped Lyman- absorption-line systems DLAs absorbers with NH I 
2  1020 cm2 are often assumed to be the disks of large spiral galaxies or their
progenitors There are not many of these systems known at low-z only 9 DLAs
are know with z  05 Rao  Turnshek 2000 Bowen et al 2001 Steidel et al
1994 Lanzetta et al 1997 and Le Brun et al 1997 and only 2 of those are
at z  01 where detailed observations are possible Absorption line studies do
not provide adequate statistical samples because their pencil beams survey only
small volumes of space
Low-z DLAs have provided a few surprises In particular many of the opti-
cal counterparts are dwarf or low surface brightness galaxies rather than bright
spirals The optical characteristics as well as the metallicities of DLAs have
lead to speculation that the absorption line population is biased against detect-
ing the expected population of bright spiral galaxies However an unbiased low
redshift sample has never been constructed for study which may account for
some of the surprising characteristics We make use of blind 21 cm surveys to
construct a low redshift sample unbiased by a galaxys optical properties and
use it to determine what we expect to nd in the absorber population
What constraints does the number density of HI-rich galaxies in the local
universe place on the low redshift evolution of DLAs 34 Are the kinematic
properties of these z0 absorbers consistent with those of the high-z population
35 What are the optical properties of these z0 galaxies and are they
consistent with the properties found for nearby absorbers 36
2 THE DATA
For this study we use the Arecibo Dual-Beam Survey ADBS Rosenberg 
Schneider 2000 a 21 cm survey that covered  430 deg2 in the Arecibo main
beam The velocity coverage of the survey was 654 to 7977 km s1 with an
average rms sensitivity of 35 mJy The ADBS identied 265 galaxies only a
third of which had previously identied optical counterpartsThe problem with
comparing emission and absorption line studies are the dierences in spatial
resolution 025-1 for absorption and  40 for VLA D-array studies
All of the ADBS sources were followed-up at Arecibo or the VLA We
use the 99 VLA D-array maps to investigate HI size of HI-rich galaxies The
covering area of is determined in an isophote at a column density of 2 1020
cm2 Because of the low resolution of these data we have used isophotal
ts rather than pixel-by-pixel measurements However the galaxies that were
mapped were selected to be the lowest mass sources in order to constrain the low
mass end of the HI mass function To ll in the sizes of high HI mass sources
we use information available in the literature Martin 1998 These data include
a compilation of galaxy sizes at given column densities We restrict the use of
these galaxies to the source for which there is a VLA Westerbork or ATCA
measurement at Log NH I  203 or for which the ratio of the standard deviation
to the HI size at Log NH I  203 is less than 5
In addition to comparing the gaseous properties of the samples we compare
the stellar properties of HI-rich galaxies to those of the low redshift DLAs that
have been found To examine the stellar properties of the galaxies we use the 2
Micron All-Sky Survey 2MASS Jarrett et al 2000 2MASS used 2 identical
13m telescopes in Tucson and Chile which provide simultaneous J H and Ks
observations The observing time per point is only 78 seconds so this survey is
not ideal for nding faint and low surface brightness galaxies but it provides a
near infrared measurement for the brighter galaxies in our sample
3 RESULTS
31 The HI Mass Function
To probe the distribution of properties of HI-rich galaxies in the local universe
we must determine the number density the HI mass function of these galaxies
Knowing the number density of HI-rich galaxies locally we can compare their
properties to those of DLAs
Figure 1
The HI mass function as derived for sources in the ADBS
Rosenberg  Schneider 2001 The mass function was computed 2
ways the open squares show the results from the 1Vtot method the
lled circles show the result from the step-wise maximum likelihood
method The solid line is a Schechter function t to these data with a
low-mass end slope of   -15 The dashed line is a Schechter function
with   -12 as found by Zwaan et al for their sample 1997 and as
we found for the shape of the HI mass function in the Virgo Cluster
The derivation of the HI mass function depends on a careful assessment
of the HI sensitivity function for the survey A complete description of the HI
mass function derivation for the ADBS can be found in Rosenberg  Schneider
2001 Figure 1 shows the ADBS HI mass function We have t a Schechter
function to the results and nd the faint-end slope of   -15 the knee of the
curve is at LogM M  988 and the normalization is   00058 Mpc3
Our result indicate that the population of small HI-rich galaxies is larger than
the number of faint galaxies found in optical luminosity function studies
32 Galaxy Sizes at 21 cm
Figure 2 shows the relationship between de-projected HI area and HI mass
Giovanelli  Haynes 1983 found that the relationship between HI mass and
optical size could be used as a measure of HI deciency in galaxies because it
was generally consistent among undisturbed galaxies The correlation between
HI mass and HI size tighter than for optical size indicates a narrow range of
average HI column densities The outlying galaxies in Figure 2 show indications
of being disturbed by interactions For this study we scale the area by 064 the
average projection factor for the sample
The low resolution of the data and the use of global galaxy relations to derive
galaxy size relationships ignores the small scale properties of these galaxies If
the surface lling factor of high column density HI NH I  2  1020 cm2 is
small we have overestimated the size of the damped region for each of these
galaxies It is useful to note however that there can also be regions of damped
emission beyond our measured HI isophote which will contribute to a larger HI
covering area

1020 cm2 and HI mass for HI-rich galaxies The lled circles are the
points from the ADBS the open triangles are from HI maps published
in the literature and compiled by Martin 1998
Detailed studies of the HI covering fraction have been done in very few
galaxies to date and have shown disparities in the covering fractions derived for
dierent galaxies Braun  Walterbos 1992 nd that the HI volume lling
fraction in the Galaxy is  16 while it is  38 in M31 However the sur-
face lling fraction the important value here approaches 1 where the emission
brightness temperature exceeds 5 K equivalent to a column density of 2 1020
cm2 for an asymptotic temperature T  125 K and a velocity width of 215
km s1 These numbers imply that the correction for the covering fraction in
these galaxies should be relatively small
33 Galaxy Covering Fraction
The relationship between HI mass and HI size discussed in the previous section
can be used the relationship to calculate the number of damped systems per unit
redshift as a function of HI mass This function is the multiplication of the HI
mass function and the HI mass versus HI size relationship and is given by
dN MH I dz  MH I M pc3  AMH I M pc2  cH0
where MH I  is the number density of galaxies in the mass bin as given by
the HI mass function and AMH I  is the average covering area in the mass bin
We use H0  75 km s1Mpc3 throughout but note that dNdz is independent
Figure 3 shows the resulting dNdz versus HI mass function This gure
shows that 66 of the area comes from galaxies in the range 85  Log MH I 
97 The highest mass galaxies Log MH I  1026 contribute 13 of the area
Figure 3
The value of dNdz as a function of mass for galaxies
identied in the ADBS 66 of the area comes from galaxies in the
range 85  Log MH I  97
while the lowest mass galaxies Log MH I 85 contribute 21 The cross-
section of galaxies is not dominated by the highest HI-mass galaxies but is
instead a contribution from a range of galaxy masses below MH I
34 Limits on the DLA Population in the Local Universe
Whether the DLA population evolves at low-z remains dicult to answer be-
cause of the poor statistics The work of Rao  Turnshek 2000 used HI 21
cm Arecibo data from Rao et al 1995 on 30 bright spiral galaxies to calculate
dNdz for damped systems in the local universe Although the errors are large
the data indicate that there has been strong evolution between z20 and z05
However the survey of large bright spiral galaxies may not be representative of
the HI-rich galaxy population Figure 4 shows the same plot with the Rao et
al 1995 bright spirals open circle and the ADBS dNdz value lled circle
Note that both z  0 points suer from measuring the gas in a large beam
although the resolution is signicantly better for the ADBS survey data
Figure 4 shows dNdz of the DLA population as a function of redshift The
triangles are from Wolfe et al WLFC95 1995 the squares are from Rao 
Turnshek RT00 2000 the open circle is the z  0 points from the Rao et
al bright spiral galaxies RTB95 1995 and the lled circle is the z  0 point
determined from the ADBS data in this work The ADBS data is consistent with
the q0  0 no evolution model shown by the solid line in this gure The dashed
line shows the   15 t from Rao  Turnshek 2000 The large error bars on
these data and the uncertainty in the HI covering fraction means that evolution
of the DLA population at low-z can not be ruled out However the known
population of HI-rich galaxies is consistent with no evolution of the absorbers

35 Line Width Distribution
Prochaska and Wolfe have analyzed the kinematics of 35 DLAs and used them
to constrain models of the origin of these sytems Prochaska  Wolfe 1997
Prochaska  Wolfe 1998 Wolfe  Prochaska 2000 They assume that the
galaxy population is homogenous and therefore require massive spiral galaxies to
account for the largest observed linewidth sources in their sample Additionally
they nd that a population of spherical systems kinematically similar to dwarf
galaxiesprotogalaxies can be ruled out as the origin of the kinematics at greater
than 999 condence
Figure 5 shows the percentage of the DLA sample open histogram and of
the ADBS sample shaded histogram with a given line width The error bars
reect the Poisson statistics in each bin There are a total of 26 galaxies in the
DLA sample and 265 in the ADBS The ADBS data show that the population
which dominates the HI cross-section is kinematically consistent with the DLAs
There is a decit of small line width sources in the ADBS data relative to the
DLA data There are several possible explanations of this decit 1 the absorp-
tion line studies are biased towards lower line widths because with their higher
spatial resolution they tend to sample a smaller portion of the rotation curve
2 the DLA data has not been corrected for completeness so linewidth eects
such as the lower contrast between continuum and absorption-line for higher ve-
locity width sources may preferentially remove large line-width sources from the
sample 3 the most massive spiral systems may obscure the background AGN
and therefore be missed in absorption as has been discussed by other authors

large linewdiths seen in the DLA sample
36 Optical and Near Infrared Properties of Absorber Population
Because L galaxies dominate the light in the universe and MH I galaxies dom-
inate the HI mass it was generally expected that the optical counterparts to the
DLAs would be HI-rich L galaxies - bright spirals Instead many of the low-z
DLAs are low luminosity andor low surface brightness Part of the explination
for the stellar properties of the DLAs is that there is a large dispersion in the
HI-mass optical luminosity correlation Additionally Figure 4 shows that there
is a large range of masses below M that contribute to the HI cross-section
Figure 6 shows the relationship between HI mass and near infrared luminos-
ity for 3 HI-selected galaxy samples the ADBS lled circles the Arecibo Slice
survey Spitzak  Schneider 1998 triangles and the AHISS survey Zwaan et
al 1997 stars The open triangles show the Arecibo Slice galaxies for which
there were I-band data but no J-band detection in 2MASS so a color-corrected
I-band luminosity was substituted While there is a correlation between the the
HI mass and the J-band luminosity there is a spread of several orders of mag-
nitude This gure illustrates why we detect a large number of low luminosity
systems in absorption line studies The DLAs are mostly drawn from an HI-rich
population which spans the range of luminosities from a few tenths L to  104
L Note that many of the HI-survey sources are not in this gure because they
were too low luminosity or too low surface brightness to be detected by 2MASS
Figure 7 shows Digitized Sky Survey images for a random sample just
chosen such that there would be 2 at each dex of ADBS galaxies with masses
between LogMH I M   88 and 97 Note the large range of morphologies
luminosities and surface brightnesses for this sample In fact there is very little
correlation between these properties and the HI-mass of the galaxy This gure
Figure 6
The relationship between J-band luminosity and HI mass
for HI-selected galaxies Note that there are many galaxies in the
3 blind HI surveys represented that are missing because they were
too faint or too low surface brightness to be detected with 2MASS
The lled circles are galaxies from the ADBS Rosenberg  Schneider
2000 the stars are from the AHISS survey Zwaan et al 1997 and
the triangles are from the Arecibo Slice survey Spitzak  Schneider
1998 where the open triangles are I-band measurements to which a
color correction has been applied
illustrates that the HI cross-section should not be expected to be dominated by
L spirals Many of the counterparts to DLAs should be low surface brightness
andor irregular galaxies so care must be taken when correlating the nearest
bright spiral with a DLA at high redshift
4 CONCLUSIONS
The number density of HI-rich galaxies at low-z does not require evolution of the
DLA population as indicated by Rao  Turnshek 2000 However the large
errorbars on the values of dNdz at any given redshift and the uncertainties
in the HI covering fraction make it impossible to rule out evolution of this
population
The optical and kinematic properties of HI-selected galaxies are consistent
with those of DLAs The surprising nature of the DLA population is at least in
part the result of an improper comparison sample rather than a detection bias
There may still be some subtle biases in the DLA selection but until more data
are available for comparing these samples it will remain uncertain
The galaxies which dominate the HI cross-section span a large range of
properties They cover a large range in HI mass as well as optical luminosity
surface brightness and morphology As has been found for the low redshift
DLAs this is not a homogeneous population of bright spirals as might have
been anticipated but is instead a very diverse galaxy population
