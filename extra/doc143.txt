We show that the galaxy correlation function does not evolve in proportion with the
correlation function of the underlying mass distribution Earliest galaxies cluster
very strongly and the amplitude of the galaxy correlation function decreases from
this large value This continues till the average peaks have collapsed after which
the galaxy correlation function does not evolve very strongly
1 The Halo Grail
We begin by addressing the simpler problem of halo correlation In later sec-
tions we will test the model presented here using N-Body simulations Lastly
we will comment on applying the results for halo clustering to galaxy clustering
and discuss some of its implications
Consider the distribution of halos of mass M before typical halos of this
mass have collapsed To quantify this we rst dene a bias parameter M  
cM  where M  is the linearly extrapolated rms dispersion in density
at mass scale M and c  168 is the linearly extrapolated density contrast
at which halos are expected to virialise We can write the linear correlation
function of these halos for   1 and Mr
M0
 1 as 1
H M r  expcid202 M r
M 0cid21  1
Here M r is the correlation function of the density eld smoothed at mass
scale M  evaluated at scale r and H is the correlation function of halos It
follows from this expression that the halo correlation function is much larger
than the mass correlation function in the range of scales where 2 Mr
 1
M0
The evolution of H for these scales is controlled by the decreasing function
 Therefore at early times the amplitude of correlation function of halos
is a decreasing function of time Eqn1 gives only the linearly extrapolated
correlation function for halos However the qualitative behaviour being ex-
ponentially strong should survive the non-linear evolution
At later epochs when M   1 eqn1 is no longer valid By this time
most halos of mass M have collapsed
In hierarchical models these halos
merge and give rise to more massive halos As gravity brings halos closer the
halo correlation function increases However the rate of growth of correlation
function will be slow as anti-biased halos continue to collapse for some time
2 Simulations
The ideas outlined above are applicable to all models we tested these using
simulations of the SCDM model We used a 1283 PM simulation with box size
of 90h1Mpc We normalised the power spectrum to reproduce the present
day cluster abundance 8  06 Halos were identied with the friends of
friends FOF algorithm with a threshold linking length of 02 grid lengths
In principle we should use halos with mass in a narrow range to study
the evolution of halo correlation function However two reasons force us to
use a dierent strategy
1 The FOF algorithm is known to link together
dynamically distinct halos This leads to an incorrect estimate of the halo mass
and the number of close pairs of halos 2 Finite mass resolution in numerical
simulations leads to the over merging problem 2 and this makes it dicult to
estimate the number of halos that survive inside bigger halos Both of these
lead to an underestimate of the halo correlation function Therefore we do
not consider halos as being one unit each We assign a weight proportional
to the mass to each halo Operationally this is equivalent to computing the
correlation function of particles contained in these halos This strategy is also
appropriate for studying galaxy correlation function as galaxies are known to
survive inside clusters of galaxies Although we ignore the large range in masses
of galaxies by using this particular method we include a realistic contribution
of very massive halos
We describe the clustering properties using the averaged two point corre-
lation function  dened as
r 
Z x2xdx
where  is the two point correlation function
To quantify the dierences in evolution of halo distribution and mass dis-
tribution we have plotted the averaged correlation function for these in g1
The left panel shows the growth of the mass correlation function and the right
panel shows the evolution of the halo correlation function Minimum halo mass
for this simulation is 2  1012M This gure shows that the clustering in
mass increases monotonically In contrast the amplitude of the halo corre-
lation function is high at early times and decreases rapidly up to z  1 It
starts increasing again after z  05 which corresponds closely to M   1
Figure 1 The left panel shows the evolution of clustering in the total mass distribution 
increases monotonically Symbols are  z  3 cid13 z  2  z  1  z  05 
z  025 and  z  0 The halo correlation function shown in right panel decreases
from its initial high value at z  3 slows down after z  1 and starts increasing after z  05
The halo correlation function varies very little between z  1 and z  0 The
value of M  that corresponds to the minimum amplitude of halo correlation
function depends on the local index of the power spectrum 3 and is smaller for
negative indices
3 Discussion
In order to apply the results given above to clustering of galaxies we must
incorporate eects of the mass function of galaxies The amplitude of halo
correlation function starts increasing earlier for low mass halos As there are
many more low mass halos than high mass ones the epoch at which the ampli-
tude of galaxy correlation function starts increasing will depend on the mass
of the smallest galaxies that can be seen at high redshifts a Simulations that
combine semi-analytic models of galaxy formation with gravitational clustering
can be used to compute galaxy correlation function and for the models where
this has been done the galaxy correlation function follows the same pattern
as the halo correlation function4 Irrespective of the detailed evolution we can
aIdentifying the same population of galaxies at dierent redshifts is also a problem
conclude that at high redshifts galaxies cluster much more strongly than the
underlying mass distribution Thus the observed clustering of galaxies at high
redshifts 5 is not a strong constraint for most models of structure formation6
Some other implications of strong clustering at high redshifts are 1 The
evolution of galaxy clustering is not a good indicator of cosmological param-
eters 2 The shape of the galaxy correlation function is dierent from the
shape of the mass correlation function Therefore galaxy correlation function
is not a very good indicator of the initial power spectrum 3 Sources respon-
sible for reheating and reionisation of the IGM will have a very non-uniform
distribution This will lead to a patchy structure at early epochs The scale of
patchiness which may be observable7 can be used to constrain galaxy forma-
tion scenarios 4 Formation of many ionising sources in a small region will
increase the temperature of the IGM and inhibit collapse of low mass halos
in these regions8 Therefore the mass function of galaxies near and away from
these ionising centres will be dierent 5 If quasars form preferentially in
high mass halos then they should show stronger clustering than galaxies Re-
cent estimates of quasar correlation function show that it is stronger than the
galaxy correlation function910 A comparison of the two and their evolution
can be a useful indicator of the prevalence of AGN activity in galaxies
