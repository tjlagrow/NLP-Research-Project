Abstract In the past two decades secular evolution has emerged as an important new paradigm
for the formation and evolution of the Hubble sequence of galaxies A new dynamical mechanism
was identied through which density waves in galaxies in the forms of nonlinear and global spiral
and bar modes induce important collective dissipation eects previously unknown in traditional
studies These eects lead to the evolution of the basic state of the galactic disk consistent
with the gradual transformation of a typical galaxys morphological type from a late to an
early Hubble type In this paper we review the theoretical framework and highlight our recent
result which showed that there are signicant qualitative and quantitative dierences between
the secular evolution rates predicted by the new theory compared with those predicted by the
classical approach of Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs These dierences are the outward manifestation
of the dominant role played by collisionless shocks in disk galaxies hosting quasi-stationary
extremely non-linear density-wave modes
1 Introduction
The possibility that galaxy morphologies can transform signicantly over their life-
time not only through violent episodes such as merger or satellite accretion but also
through slow but steady internal secular dynamical processes is a notion that is gaining
acceptance in the recent decades In the past the work on secular evolution has been
focused on gas accretion in barred galaxies and the growth of pseudo bulges Kormendy
 Kennicutt 2004 and the references therein This is partly due to the long-held notion
that gas is the only mass component capable of dissipation and the stellar component
is adiabatic and generally does not lose or gain energy and angular momentum as they
orbit around the center of a galaxy
The rst indication that there is the possibility for signicant stellar mass redistribution
in galaxies originates from the seminal work of Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs 1972 hereafter
LBK who showed that a trailing spiral density wave possesses a gravitational torque that
over time can transport angular momentum outward LBK were interested in the angular
momentum transport phenomenon because they were seeking a generating mechanism for
the spiral density waves thought to be short-lived wave trains constantly being amplied
out of noise and subsequently absorbed at the inner Lindblad resonance Since the density
wave is considered to possess negative energy and angular momentum inside corotation
relative to the basic state ie the axisymmetric disk an outward angular momentum
transport would encourage the spontaneous growth of the wave trains LBK at that
Zhang and Buta
time was not interested in the secular morphological evolution of the basic state of the
disks In fact in the same paper they showed that for WKBJ tightly wrapped waves
the long-term energy and angular momentum exchange between the wave and the basic
state is zero away from the wave-particle resonances This is possible in the presence of
the outward angular momentum transport by gravitational torque couple because they
showed that there is a second type of torque couple the so-called advective torque couple
due to lorry transport that opposes the gravitational torque couple and the sum of
the two types of torque couples is a constant independent of the galactic radii The total
torque couple which is equal to the rate of total radial angular momentum ux is thus
a constant during the outward angular momentum transport and there is no interaction
of the wave and basic state except at the wave-particle resonances ie they thought the
wave picks up angular momentum from the basic state at the inner Lindblad resonance
and dumps it at the outer Lindblad resonance and en route of this radial transport the
total angular momentum ux remains constant
Zhang 199619981999 showed that the classical theory of LBK ignored an impor-
tant collective dissipation process present in the gravitational N-body disks possessing
self-organized or spontaneously-formed density wave modes This process is mediated
by collisionless shocks at the density wave crest which breaks the adiabaticity or the
conservation of the Jacobi integral condition  a condition which is shown to be valid
only for a passive orbit under an applied spiral or bar potential and is now shown not
to be obeyed by orbits undergoing collective dissipation The overall manifestation of
the collective dissipation process is an azimuthal phase shift between the potential and
the density distribution of the density wave pattern and for a self-sustained mode this
phase shift is positive inside corotation and negative outside The presence of the phase
shift means that for every annulus of the galaxy there is a secular torque applied by the
density wave on the disk matter in the annulus and the associated energy and angular
momentum exchange between the wave and the basic state of the disk As a result the
disk matter inside corotation both stars and gas loses energy and angular momentum
to the wave and spirals inward and the disk matter outside corotation gains energy
and angular momentum from the wave and spirals outward This energy and angular
momentum exchange between the wave and the basic state of the disk thus becomes
the ultimate driving mechanism for the secular evolution of the mass distribution of the
basic state of galaxy disks The energy and angular momentum received by the wave
from the basic state incidentally serve as a damping mechanism for the spontaneously
growing unstable mode allowing it to achieve quasi-steady state at suciently nonlinear
amplitude
In Zhang 1998 a set of analytical expressions for the secular mass accretionexcretion
rate was derived and was conrmed quantitatively in the N-body simulations presented
in the same paper However due to the 2D nature of these simulations where the bulge
and halo were assumed to be spherical and inert the simulated wave has an average
density contrast of 20 and potential contrast of 5 both much lower than the average
observed density wave contrast in physical galaxies so the simulated disk did not evolve
a lot Zhang 1999 despite the fact that these low evolution rates conform exactly to the
analytical formulas prediction for the corresponding wave amplitude Zhang 1998
Zhang  Buta 2007 and Buta  Zhang 2009 used near-frared images of observed
galaxies to derive the radial distribution of the azimuthal potential-density phase shifts
and to use the positive-to-negative zero crossings of the phase shift curve to determine the
corotation radii CRs for galaxies possessing spontaneously-formed density wave modes
This approach works because the alternating positive and negative humps of phase shift
distribution lead to the correct sense of energy and angular momentum exchange between
Secular Evolution
the wave mode and the disk matter to encourage the spontaneous emergence of the mode
In Zhang  Buta 2007 and Buta  Zhang 2009 we have found good correspondence
between the predicted CRs using the potential-density phase shift approach with the
resonance features present in galaxy images and also with results from other reliable CR
determination methods within the range of validity of these methods Beside CR determi-
nation an initial test case for mass ow rate calculation for galaxy NGC 1530 was also
carried out in Zhang  Buta 2007 using the same volume-torque-integrationpotential-
density phase shift approach and there we found that since this galaxy has exceptionally
large surface density and density-wave arm-to-interarm contrast mass ow rate more
than 100 solar mass per year were obtained across much of the galactic radii for this
galaxy This level of mass ow rate is more than sucient to transform the Hubble type
of a late type galaxy to an early type within a Hubble time Other galaxies we have
tested have signicantly lower mass ow rates but still are sucient to lead to signicant
mass redistribution over a Hubble time
Recently we have applied the potential-density phase shiftvolume-torque method to
a larger sample of galaxies in order to estimate their mass ow rates In related earlier
works Gnedin et al 1995 and Foyle et al 2010 have applied LBK type gravitational
torque integral to the calculation of angular momentum redistribution rate in a number
of galaxies In our own studies we found that such earlier work using the gravitational
torque couple alone had signicantly under-estimated the implied total mass ow rates
in these galaxies As it turns out the advective torque couple which opposes the grav-
itational torque couple in the LBK classical theory becomes to have the same sense of
angular momentum transport direction for spontaneous-formed density wave modes at
the nonlinear regime Furthermore at the extremely non-linear wave amplitudes usually
found for observed galaxies the contribution of advective torques due to the collisionless
shocks far exceeds the contribution from gravitational torques and becomes the dom-
inant driver for the secular evolution of galaxy mass redistribution The sum of both
types of surface torque couples turns out to be equal to the integral of the volume-
type torque we used in this work which is rst proved in Zhang 1998 1999 The past
calculations of gas mass accretion near the central region of galaxies eg Haan et al
2009 are likely to have signicantly underestimated the gas mass ow rate for the same
reason
Our current work also has other important implications for the fundamental questions
of galactic dynamics For example on the modal versus transient nature of the density
wave patterns in galaxies see eg Sellwood 2010 and the references therein The bell-
shaped total angular momentum ux or torque coupling integral which is equivalent to
the two-humped phase shift or volume torque distribution that we have found to be
overwhelmingly present in observed galaxies has no explanation in the classical LBK
theory of transient waves which predicts constant total angular momentum ux for a
wave train between the inner and outer Lindblad resonances LBK Binney  Tremaine
2008 but is a natural consequence of the spontaneously-formed intrinsic modes of disk
galaxies as rst demonstrated in Zhang 1998 Also the result of CR determination for
the majority of the more than 150 galaxies analyzed in Buta  Zhang 2009 using the
potential-density phase shift method also supports the modal view since for transient
waves one should not be able to use the Poisson equation alone to predict a partially-
kinematic quantity such as the corotation radius For the successful application of the
potential-density phase shift method the Poisson equation and the equations of motion
must have achieved a good degree of mutual consistency to allow a quasi-steady state to
form a condition naturally met by self-sustained modes and in general not expected to
hold for transient waves

2 THEORETICAL BASIS FOR APPLYING THE
POTENTIAL-DENSITY PHASE SHIFT APPROACH TO THE
MASS FLOW RATE CALCULATION
The detailed discussion on the new dynamical mechanism responsible for the sec-
ular mass redistribution in galaxies both stellar and gaseous is described in Zhang
199619981999 We now briey summarize the derivations relevant to the calculation of
the mass ow rate in galaxies
The inward radial mass accretion rate at a galactic radius R can be written as
2R0R
where 0R is the mean surface density of the basic state of the disk at radius R and
dRdt is the mean orbital delay rate of an average star
We also know that the mean orbital decay rate of a single star is related to its angular
momentum loss rate dL  dt through
 VcM
where Vc is the mean circular velocity at radius R and M the mass of the relevant star
Now we have also
where dL
at radius R
dt is the angular momentum loss rate of the basic state disk matter per unit area
Zhang 1996 we have nally
2 Z 2
Vc Z 2
where the subscript 1 denotes the perturbation quantities
In the above derivation we have used a volume-type of torque T1R
T1R  RZ 2
which was rst introduced in the context of the self-torquing of the disk matter by its
associated spontaneously-formed density wave modes in Zhang 19961998 The volume
torque is equal to the time rate of angular momentum exchange between the density
wave and the disk matter in a unit-width annulus located at galactic radius R for wave
modes in approximate quasi-steady state In the past two other types of torque-coupling
integrals have also been used Lynden-Bell  Kalnajs 1972 Binney  Tremaine 2008
These are the gravitational torque couple CgR
CgR 
4G Z 
 Z 2
and the advective torque couple CaR
Secular Evolution
CaR  R2Z 2
0VRVd
where VR and V are the radial and azimuthal velocity perturbation relative to the
circular velocity respectively
In the classical theory the volume torque integral T1R can be shown to be equal to
dCgR in the linear regime Zhang 1998 original derivation due to S Tremaine private
communication However for spontaneously-formed density wave modes when the wave
amplitude is signicantly nonlinear and the importance of collisionless shocks at the
density wave crest begins to dominate it can be shown that one of the crucial conditions
in the proof of the T1R  dCgdR relation that of the validity of the dierential form
of the Poisson equation is no longer valid Zhang 1998 At the quasi-steady state QSS
of the wave mode it can be shown that in fact T1R  dCa  CgdR  dCdR Zhang
1999 An intuitive derivation of this equality can be given as follows dCa  CgdR 
dCdR is the wave angular momentum ux gradient in the Eulerian picture and T1R
is the rate of angular momentum loss for the disk matter in a unit-width annulus located
at R in the Lagrangian picture At the quasi-steady state of the wave mode these two
need to balance each other so the wave amplitude does not continue to grow ie all the
negative angular momentum deposited by the wave goes to the basic state of the disk
matter and none goes to the wave itself so that the wave amplitude does not continue
to grow as required by the condition for the quasi-steady state of the wave mode
The past calculations of the secular angular momentum redistribution rate ie Gnedin
et al 1995 Foyle et al 2010 considered only the contribution from gravitational torque
couple and ignored the contribution of the advective torque couple which cannot be di-
rectly estimated using the observation data except through our round-about way of
estimating the total torque using the volume-type of torque integral T1R In the fol-
lowing we will show that the advective contribution to the total torque in fact is several
times larger than the contribution of the gravitational torques in the extreme nonlinear
regime usually encountered in observed galaxies and is of the same sense of angular mo-
mentum transport as the gravitational torque couple  another characteristic unique to
the nonlinear modal case Furthermore the two-humped shape of the volume torque dis-
tribution with zero crossing at CR which is equivalent to the two-humped distribution
of the phase shift is consistent with the bell-shaped torque couplings previously found
in both N-body simulations Zhang 1998 and in observed galaxies Gnedin et al 1995
for the gravitational torque coupling contribution only This characteristic distribution
is another important piece of evidence that the density waves present in disk galaxies are
in fact spontaneous unstable modes in the underlying basic state of the disks
In Figure 1 left we show the result of N-body calculated gravitational and advective
torque couplings obtained in Zhang 19961998 which shows obviously the bell-shaped
curves for both type of couples and with the peak near the CR of the dominant spiral
mode at r30 In Figure 1 right we show the gradient of the gravitational and total
torque couples and compare them with T1R It is clear that T1R 6 dCgdR and
rather is closer to dCdR though the equality is not yet exact because this particular
simulated N-body mode never achieved true steady state The second hump in the left
plot is due to a spurious edge mode In physical galaxies as our examples below will
show the dierence between T1R and dCgdR becomes even more pronounced than in
these N-body simulations because of the higher degree of nonlinearity of the wave modes
in physical galaxies

In Zhang  Buta 2007 we have used the SINGS image to perform a bar-spiral
separation using the methods described by Buta et al 2005 the results of which are
shown with our four CR circles superposed in the top two panels of Figure 3 The lower
two frames of Figure 3 present the original image without bar-spiral separation zoomed-
in by a linear factor of 2 and 4 respectively compared to the top two frames Here we
see clearly that the innermost corotation circle CR1 encloses the strong secondary bar
Between the next two CRs CR2 and CR3 there appear to be faint spiral structures

In Figure 4 we plot the calculated gravitational torque couple for NGC 4321 using the
SINGS 36 m image This torque calculation result is very similar in shape to the one
calculated for the same galaxy by Gnedin et al 1995 though the scale factor is more
than a factor of 10 smaller than obtained in their paper We have tried to switch to use an
R-band image as in Gnedin et al and rescaled the galaxy parameters to be in agreement
with what they used still the resulting scale is smaller by a factor of 5 from that in the
Zhang and Buta
Gnedin et al 1995 This same amount of scaling dierence is recently found by Foyle
et al 2010 as well when they try to reproduce the Gnedin et al result Therefore it
is possible that the Gnedin et al calculation suered an internal error somewhere since
our result and the Foyle et al result were obtained entirely independently and using data
from dierent passbands
Figure 4 Calculated gravitational torque coupling versus radius for galaxy NGC 4321
In Figure 5 we show the calculated mass ow rates and radial gradient of gravitational
torque coupling integral CgR as compared to the volume torque integral T1R There
is about a factor of 4 dierence between the volume torque integral and the gradient
of the gravitational torque integral indicating that the remainder which is contributed
by the advective torque coupling is in the same sense but much greater in value than
the gravitational torque coupling integral Note that this dierence between the volume
torque integral and the gradient of the surface gravitational torque couple is only ex-
pected in the new theory in the traditional theory of LBK these two are supposed to
be equal to each other Furthermore if the LBK theory is used literally one should not
expect any mass ow rate at all expect at isolated resonance locations since the total
angular momentum ux is expected to be constant The existence of a mass ux across
the entire galactic disk is also contrary to the LBKs original expectations

We have also used the potential-density phase shift method on the interacting galaxy
NGC 5194 M51 Figure 6 By focusing on the area that just excludes the small com-
panion NGC 5195 which is likely to lie outside of the M51 galactic plane and thus have
minor inuence on the internal dynamics of M51 at the epoch of observation a conjec-
ture which is conrmed by our analysis the phase shift analysis gives two major CR
radii PN crossings on the phase shift plot represented by red circles on the overlay im-
age followed by two negative-to-positive NP crossing radii represented by the green
circles on the image the latter are believed to be where the inner mode decouples from
the outer mode These radii match very well the galaxy morphological features ie the
inner CR circle lies near the end of the bar and the rst NP crossing circle is where
the two modes are seen to decouple For the outer mode the CR circle seems to just
bisect the regions where the star-formation clumps are either concentrated on the inner

edge of the arm or on the outer edge of the arm  a strong indication that this second
CR is located right near where the pattern speed of the wave and the angular speed of
the stars match each other This supports the hypothesis that the spiral patterns in this
galaxy are intrinsic modes rather than tidal transients and that tidal perturbation serves
to enhance the prominence of the intrinsic mode but does not alter its modal shape

In Figure 7 we plot the calculated mass ow rates and the comparison of the gradient
of gravitational torque couple CgR and volume torque T1R for NGC 5194 Once again
we see that for this galaxy as for NGC 4321 the advective torque couple is in the same
sense as the gravitational torque couple and dominates the value of the total torque
coupling Similar results were found for other galaxies we have analyzed so far as well

4 Conclusions
The correct treatment of gravitational many-body systems containing self-organized
global patterns such as density wave modes in disk galaxies requires a re-examination of
classical dynamical approaches and assumptions Our experience so far has shown that
entirely new qualitative and quantitative results can emerge from the collective interac-
tions of the many particles in a complex dynamical system Formerly sacred laws such as
the dierential form of the Poisson equation can break down at the crest of collisionless
shocks and new meta-laws such as the equality of the volume torque integral with the
derivative of the sum of gravitational and advective surface torque coupling integrals
appear as emergent laws Such emergent behavior is the low-energy Newtonian dynamical
analogy of high energy physics spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry a well known
pathway for forming new meta laws when traversing the hierarchy of organizations
