I review the general progress made in the study of galaxy evolution concentrating
on the impact of systematic ground-based spectroscopic surveys of faint galaxies and
high resolution imaging with Hubble Space Telescope The picture emerging is one
where massive regular galaxies have changed little since redshift z  whereas there
has been a marked decline in the abundance of less massive star forming dwarf galaxies
Reconciling these trends with the conventional hierarchical growth of structure on
galactic scales and determining the fate of the star forming dwarfs remains a ma jor
unsolved problem in contemporary cosmology
Introduction
Considerable progress has been made in recent years in constraining the recent
evolution of normal galaxies through detailed studies of stellar populations of
nearby systems and comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic surveys of
cid12eld and cluster galaxies viewed at large look-back times An outstanding re-
striction in the analysis of high redshift data has been the comparing apples
and oranges problem Given the diverse nature of the galaxy population at
any redshift how can similar types be determined unambiguously over a range
in look-back time and the evolution of a subset of the population be reliably
determined Let me start by discussing two recent examples of observational
progress in the high redshift area which as a Devils advocate I will expose
to illustrate some weaknesses we seek to eliminate
In the cid12rst example let us consider the work of Dressler  Gunn  and
Aragcid19on-Salamanca et al  on the respective D
spectral discontinuities
and V cid0 K colours for the reddest galaxies in a number of z  clusters By
comparing the mean properties of such galaxies with the spectral energy dis-
tributions of early-type galaxies observed locally both teams claim there has
been only modest evolution in luminous early-type cluster members since z 
Whilst it might seem reasonable to suppose that the reddest galaxies in each
high z cluster are early-type systems without morphological imaging one cannot
exclude the possibility that some of the bluer galaxies are also early-type The
simple conclusion derived by Dressler Aragcid19on-Salamanca and co-workers only
truly applies if the early-type population behaves uniformly so that observa-
tions of a few examples selected by colour or spectral class are representative
of the entire population As there is no a priori reason to suppose the local
uniformity in the colour-spectral class-morphology plane extends to high red-
shift the absence of any one of these observables could seriously undermine any
evolutionary tests
In the second example we consider spectroscopic surveys of cid12eld galaxies
Broadhurst et al  Colless et al  Cowie et al  Glazebrook et
al a which have collectively reinforced the view that the excess galaxies
cid12rst noted in the deep photographic and CCD galaxy counts are caused by an
increase in the absolute normalisation of the cid12eld galaxy luminosity function
LF with redshift Some subset of the galaxy population is either disappearing
or fading with time How can examples of this population be located so that
their evolution can be tracked independently and studied Notwithstanding
the large investment in redshift surveys as LFs are statistical by nature some
marker is required to identify the evolving subset
In this lecture I review the progress in these and related areas that is now pos-
sible via the recovery of the originally-anticipated imaging capabilities of Hub-
ble Space Telescope Morphological classicid12cations are now feasible for remote
galaxies at cosmologically interesting redshifts The morphology of a galaxy is
of course only some form of visual label with as yet no agreed physical basis
However I suggest it does provide a good marker for resolving evolutionary
impasses such as those discussed above Conventional photometric and spec-
troscopic indicators of galaxy class are unstable to sudden changes in the star
formation rate and thus it is dicid14cult to use these criteria to reliably connect
similar classes across ranges in look-back time
Is a faint blue emission line
source the predecessor of a local red quiescent galaxy or new class of ob ject
Although morphologies have disadvantages too they may also evolve and are
dicid14cult to measure at faint limits the additional dimension is a tremendous
bonus in understanding the origin of the Hubble sequence
 Early Formation of Massive Ellipticals
The repair of HST permits the direct identicid12cation of elliptical and S galaxies
at signicid12cant cosmic depths Figure  shows a comparison of two images of
the distant cluster  z taken with similar exposure times and
cid12lters using the m William Herschel telescope in  arcsec seeing Smail et
al  and WFPC- as part of the Morphs collaboration of Butcher Couch
Dressler Ellis Oemler Sharples  Smail The improvement in the ability to
classify faint galaxies is evident
Figure   z as viewed by WFPC- left panel courtesy of the
Morphs and the m WHT in  arcsec seeing right panel from Smail et
al 
To illustrate the possibilities further Figure  shows a selection of early-
type members in  drawn from the comprehensive spectroscopic work of
Dressler  Gunn  the separation between Ss and ellipticals is apparent
Although inevitably there are some cases where precise classicid12cations remain
uncertain the data ocid11ers a number of important possibilities which the Morphs
team is exploring
A particularly interesting although preliminary result concerns the photo-
metric homogeneity of the giant elliptical population at these large look-back
times Bower et al  demonstrated using precision U BV photometry of
ellipticals in the Coma and Virgo clusters that the intrinsic scatter around the
U cid0 V colour-luminosity relation is barely detectable cid14 U cid0 V 
 As
the U -band light is a strong constraint on past star-formation rates SFR ei-
ther ellipticals across both clusters shared the same synchronous decline in SFR
a divine intervention hypothesis or the homogeneity indicates the systems
are sucid14ciently old for individual variations in the time of formation to be neg-
ligible Depending on the degree of synchronicity Bower et al claimed ages of
between  and  Gyr This simple test is remarkably powerful because the
constraint depends only on the rate at which the rest-frame U -band luminosity
declines with time which in turn is governed by main sequence lifetimes which
are well-understood at least on a relative scale
Figure  A montage of spectroscopical ly-concid12rmed early-type members of 
z from the Morphs WFPC- programme including one spiral center
left each box is  arcsec on a side The classicid12cation of early-types and even
the distinction between Es and Ss becomes a practical proposition
At z  by good fortune the V cid0 I colours from HST map neatly onto
rest-frame U cid0 V enabling the same test to be carried out for morphologically-
concid12rmed elliptical members at a signicid12cant look-back time The test has been
carried out for several of the clusters in the appropriate redshift range in the
Morphs sample and the scatter is somewhat larger cid14 U cid0 v
 the precise
upper limit being determined by the increased photometric uncertainties for
such faint sources Even so this places a tight constraint on the ages of stars
in giant galaxies which is then added to the considerable look-back time
A preliminary version of this test was described by Ellis  on the basis
of ground-based data alone Quite apart from the morphological concid12rmation
provided by the improved angular resolution of HST the WFPC- photometry
is actually better than that of the m Herschel primarily because the sky
background is signicid12cantly fainter It is a misconception that HST is a small
aperture telescope For background-limited imaging the reduced background
in the near-infrared renders HST equivalent to a m telescope independent of
its superlative angular resolution
Depending on the cosmological model cid14 U cid0 V 
 at z when
added to the look-back time implies a present-day age of  Gyr Cluster
ellipticals thus join globular clusters in presenting a problem for certain cosmo-
logical models Indeed there is evidence that regular red ellipticals are seen in
abundance in HST images of clusters beyond z  Dickinson  although
spectroscopic work is needed in these cid12elds to be sure of the implications
These tests make strong statements about the ages of galaxies without di-
rectly observing their epoch of formation A good indication of the likely impact
of - m class telescopes in this area follows from the remarkable absorption
line spectrum of the distant radio galaxy C z obtained with the Keck
m by Stockton et al  The high signalnoise in this spectrum details the
Balmer lines and Ca II doublet sucid14ciently clearly to establish an age of -
Gyr at z An exhaustive survey of this kind for luminous z- ellip-
ticals without radio emission is possible with the new generation of telescopes
and would provide tighter constraints on their likely ages than results discussed
here based on broad-band colours alone
The conclusion emerging thus far is that the stars that make up massive
cluster ellipticals formed in a narrow time interval prior to z  It is of
course conceivable that there was some subsequent merging of sub-units to
create these galaxies but the associated star formation cannot have been signif-
icant at recent times as this would concid13ict with Bower et als U cid0 V scatter
Kaucid11man  addresses this point directly and cid12nds the likely merger rate
in hierarchical CDM models can be reconciled with Bower et als data if most
of the merging occurred between  z  However the small scatter now
observed in more distant clusters must presumably push any merging to yet
higher redshifts
A cid12nal caveat is that the results quoted above might only apply to the rather
atypical giant ellipticals in dense cluster regions Certainly there is growing
evidence that lower luminosity ellipticals and those in lower density environs
have sucid11ered more recent star formation Rose et al  However as we
will see in x there is no evidence for signicid12cant evolution in the numbers or
luminosities of distant cid12eld ellipticals either
 Slow Evolution of Massive Disk Galaxies
Bergeron  Boisscid19e  and more recently Steidel  Dickinson  have
demonstrated the value of using the galaxies responsible for the metallic ab-
sorption line systems in the spectra of distant QSOs as probes of cid12eld galaxy
evolution to z  Steidel  Dickinsons comprehensive survey of  Mg II
absorbing galaxies with z  indicates that the typical absorber is a massive
disk galaxy whose rest-frame B and K luminosities exceeds L
drawn from
cid3
a luminosity function LF which is remarkably similar to the bright end of that
observed locally although their normalisation is somewhat higher see x The
colours of the absorbers likewise span the range seen locally after allowing for
redshift ecid11ects Overall the survey is consistent with little or no evolution for
the absorbing population
Although these results have received much attention the sample remains
small particularly in each colour class The absence of strong luminosity evo-
lution from z to  can only be claimed with concid12dence for the entire popu-
lation Additionally one might worry that by selecting galaxies in absorption
only some subset of the population that has settled down is found with the
consequence that a no evolution result is guaranteed The QSO surveys have
certainly found some galaxies which do not give rise to absorption lines so-
called interlopers but many of these are blue star-forming dwarfs Steidel et
al  That the absorbers and interlopers are non-overlapping photometric
samples is perhaps the most interesting result
The Mg II surveys discussed above demand high resolution QSO absorp-
tion line spectroscopy deep imaging in the vicinity of the QSO and subsequent
spectroscopy of candidate galaxies Without the cid12nal stage to concid12rm a galaxy
has precisely the same redshift as that of the Mg II absorption line no cid12rm
association can be made At higher redshift this becomes harder both because
the galaxies are fainter and because there is a dearth of suitable features for
estimating redshifts with optical spectrographs for z 
For the purposes of deriving an absorber LF Aragcid19on-Salamanca et al 
showed that a statistical association will sucid14ce and may be obtained from imag-
ing alone provided i the cid12eld counts are known in the chosen imaging passband
to the limits explored and ii the only excess galaxies close to the QSO sightline
represent the absorbing population The latter is a moot point given the possi-
ble physical association of galaxies with QSOs but this point could be checked
by imaging a control sample of QSOs selected without the appropriate absorp-
tion lines Aragcid19on-Salamanca et al examined the nature of sources producing
clustered CIV absorption lines via deep K -band imaging of  QSOs whose
absorbers have  z  Their K -band LF is similar to that observed locally
implying no dramatic luminosity changes to quite high redshifts However there
is considerable uncertainty in matching the absolute LF normalisations since the
excess expected from their choice of clustered CIV lines is dicid14cult to estimate
Steidel  Dickinson have used similar arguments to extend their original Mg II
sample beyond z  and cid12nd equivalent results
A related development is the search for galaxies producing damped Lyman
alpha absorption These absorbers have a high HI column density and a fre-
quency suggesting they occur in the disks of high redshift galaxies Wolfe et al
 Can these sources be imaged and if so what is their luminosity and
colour As the near-IR k-correction remains modest to quite high z  deep K
band images might detect starlight from these disks particularly if they are
luminous systems like their counterpart metallic absorbers at lower redshift
Their detection would also provide some useful constraints on the amount of
dust in the high z Universe A small impact parameter from the QSO sight
line is expected if they originate in galaxy disks of high HI column density and
so exquisite conditions are important if the galaxy is to be seen next to or
underneath the very bright QSO
Figure  The subtraction of the K  QSO Q from a deep UKIRT
image reveals a promising absorber candidate with K which may be re-
sponsible for the damped Lycid11 absorption line at z
 Aragcid19on-Salamanca
et al 
Figure  shows a deep K image taken from the damped Lycid11 identicid12ca-
tion programme of Aragcid19on-Salamanca et al  For  suitable QSOs with
- several faint candidates have been identicid12ed close to the QSO but
none implies luminosities much brighter than L
 HST imaging of such candi-
cid3
dates will be particularly useful in clarifying the scale lengths of the star forming
component and in constraining the possibility of dust extinction via imaging at
shorter rest-wavelengths When NICMOS becomes available on HST routine
surveys for such galaxies can be contemplated and reliable LFs constructed to
quite high z 
Suggestive though these results are the high redshift absorber programmes
need to overcome several problems Firstly only for the z  Mg II samples
do we have the vital spectroscopic concid12rmation Spectroscopic work is dicid14-
cult and does not benecid12t from multi-ob ject techniques that have accelerated
other studies However with high-throughput infrared spectrographs it may
ultimately be possible to secure the redshifts of the distant Mg II CIV and Lycid11
absorbers It seems this will only be feasible if the absorbers are star-forming
systems with strong emission lines Another problem is that we may only be
seeing a subset of the population at any redshift via these techniques Part
of the galaxy population does not participate in the absorption progress and
determining that interloper fraction becomes harder as we proceed to higher
redshifts We appear to have been rather lucky in this respect with the MgII
absorbers but this may not be the case for the Lycid11 systems Lanzetta et al
 Redshift Surveys and the Dwarf-dominated
Universe
The absence of any signicid12cant changes in the bright end of the normal galaxy
LF discussed in x- is dicid14cult to reconcile with the puzzling excess in the cid12eld
galaxy number counts Ellis  Elementary considerations suggest the large
surface density seen in the deepest work Metcalfe et al  implies a dwarf-
dominated Universe Cowie  Lilly  How can this result be consistent with
the observed LF today which apparently does not contain a huge population of
dwarfs Either we are seriously undercounting our local Universe Phillipps
 Driver  or there were many more dwarf galaxies in the recent past
The clue to separating these two possibilities lies in securing redshifts for large
numbers of faint galaxies If the local LF has been underestimated we expect
to uncover large numbers of nearby dwarfs
It might seem something of an embarrassment to admit that the local LF
remains so uncertain However the evidence for a serious error is only circum-
stantial Efstathiou et al  analysed  galaxies in  Schmidt-sized cid12elds
 and found the Schechter  form appropriate They determined
uncorrected Schechter parameters  M

 The more extensive panoramic sparse-sampled
APM-Stromlo southern survey of  galaxies Loveday et al  found sim-
ilar parameters - -  However both surveys constrain the
faint end slope only to M
- An upturn at fainter luminosities such as
that claimed for the Virgo cluster Binggeli et al  cannot be formally ruled
Importantly a local population of feeble sources would have an Euclidean
count slope dominating the faint counts and diminishing any evolution that
would otherwise be inferred Kron  Furthermore surveys limited at
relatively bright apparent magnitudes adopt high surface brightness detection
thresholds and may be poorly-suited for cid12nding intrinsically faint galaxies Mc-
Gaugh  Clearly the most reliable constraints on the faint end of the local
LF comes from spectroscopy at those faint limits where the contribution can be
directly measured Glazebrook et al a
A related uncertainty which has plagued the sub ject concerns the question of
the absolute normalisation of the LF Although the Efstathiou et al and APM-
Stromlo surveys have consistent values of cid8
 the number counts steepen beyond
cid3
their apparent magnitude limits  b
 more than can be accounted
for by non-evolving models suggesting southern volumes with b
 may be
unrepresentative cf Maddox et al 
Combining benchmark b
 redshift surveys and deep equivalents within
narrow faint apparent magnitude slices is not ideal Broadhurst et al Colless et
al  Glazebrook et al were only able to compare the faint redshift distribution
N z  with empirical predictions based on the bright survey At no redshift was
there a sucid14cient range in luminosity to examine the form of the LF directly
Moreover the number of pencil beams was small  each raising the worry
that clustering may acid11ect the conclusions
My colleagues and I have therefore compiled a new Autocid12b survey using
the robotic cid12bre positioner built for the Anglo-Australian Telescope  Parry and
Sharples  spanning a wide apparent magnitude range in many directions
and enabling a direct reconstruction of the LF at various redshifts It includes
 redshifts from earlier magnitude-limited surveys and  new redshifts
within  b
 see Table  Further details of this new survey are con-
tained in Heyl  and preliminary results have been presented in Colless
 the full analysis will appear in Ellis et al 
In estimating absolute magnitudes of faint galaxies account must be taken
of the k-correction which depends on the galaxys unknown spectral energy
distribution SED At a given redshift k
z  changes by  magnitude across
the Hubble sequence cf King  Ellis  Heyl  devised a classicid12er
based on cross-correlation of the faint spectra against the wide aperture local
spectral catalogue of Kennicutt  Knowing the Kennicutt class which best
matches the faint galaxy the k-correction is determined with reference to King
 Ellis compilation Realistic simulations suggest the correct spectral class
is returned to within cid6 class for  of the cases  classes span the entire
sequence

The large number of faint pencil beams in the Autocid12b survey leads to new
constraints on the local LF as well as on its form at high z   galaxies in
the survey have  z  but few are less luminous than M
- most
 galaxies lie beyond z  The paucity of low luminosity galaxies
severely limits the size of any possible upturn in the local LF to M
As the photometric data used to select these galaxies penetrates to surface
brightness limits below cid22
 arcsec
 it becomes hard to argue that the cid13at
cid0
LF derived in earlier work arises from selection biases The redshift distribution
 eliminates the possibility that the faint source counts are signicid12cantly
contaminated by a population of low luminosity galaxies under-represented in
the original b
 surveys Glazebrook et al a and gives further support
to the higher cid8
normalisation discussed in x
cid3
So where does the excess count come from Figure  shows a highly sug-
gestive steepening of the faint end slope of the LF with increasing redshift
Formally a change in shape with z is signicid12cant at the  level However as
in x there is no obvious brightening in the bright end of the LF to z  As
before it seems the LF is composed of two components  a luminous part evolv-
ing very slowly if at all over z - plus a rapidly-evolving sub-L
component

whose fate remains unclear

The evolutionary trends for this class are sucid14cient to explain those seen in the
overal l population presented in Fig 
What distinguishes the galaxies that lie in these two components The miss-
ing clue appears to be related to the star-formation rate as originally suggested
by Broadhurst et al  Figure  shows how the galaxies with the strongest
O II emission dominate the evolutionary trends The luminosity density con-
tributed by this class of star-forming galaxies has dropped by a factor  since
z  Signicid12cantly at the present epoch such systems all lie at the faint end
of the LF whereas at modest redshifts they occupy a wide range of luminosities
 Faint Galaxy Morphologies from HST
The repair of HST is adding a new dimension to the study of faint cid12eld galaxies
Early Cycle  images Gricid14ths et al  demonstrated the ability to recognise
resolved morphological features in I  galaxies the bulk of which lie at 
z  Lilly  A new set of questions can be addressed with such data
 What is the morphological mixture of the high z cid12eld population  Are
the faint blue galaxies a distinct morphological population
Ultimately a large sample of HST morphologies with redshifts is required
However meanwhile a considerable amount can be determined from images
alone The largest collection is currently provided by the Medium Deep Sur-
vey PI R Gricid14ths In this key pro ject WFPC- is used in parallel mode
according to primary pointings decid12ned by other observers Redshifts for the
galaxies surveyed have to be secured later An increasing amount of HST imag-
ing is being done in the reverse mode ie primary WFPC- imaging of larger
cid12elds with existing multi-slit spectroscopy First results of these programmes are
also emerging Schade et al  Cowie et al  Broadhurst priv comm
The most signicid12cant claim to date has been made by the Medium Deep
Survey Over  I  galaxies were classicid12ed on a simple ES Spiral
IrrPec scheme by Glazebrook et al b and the number-magnitude counts
determined as a function of type Counts for an enlarged sample of  galaxies
are shown in Figure  The results illustrate that the spiral and early-type
classes show little evidence for evolution Signicid12cantly both classes cid12t the
predictions only if the absolute normalisation is cid2  higher than that derived
from the th magnitude surveys cf x On the other hand the irregular and
peculiar galaxies show a count slope much steeper than expected consistent with
signicid12cant evolution Although the overlap with the spectral samples remains
small the limited data suggests that the O II-strong sources which decline
dramatically in number since z  are the morphologically unusual examples in
the HST samples A morphologically-distinct population of star forming sources
appears to be responsible for the well-established excess population of faint blue
galaxies
Figure  Morphological counts of  galaxies with I  from the HST
Medium Deep Survey The sample is enlarged from that presented by Glazebrook
et al b Counts of regular Hubble types are consistent with no evolution
solid and dotted lines depending on cid8
 but those of irregularpeculiars show a
cid3
steeper slope suggesting rapid evolution
But can we really recognise galaxy morphologies readily at these faint limits
Is there not a danger that a faint galaxy whose signal to noise is poor in some
respect or other is too readily cast into the peculiarirregular category To
quantify this possibility Figure  shows a set of regular Hubble sequence galaxies
observed a in the B -band at z  and b as simulated in the I -band viewed
by HST at z k-corrections are allowed for via the positioning of these two
passbands and corrections have been applied to allow for the reduced HST night
sky background and various other instrumental ecid11ects

the B band courtesy of M Pierce
Figure b As a simulated for WFPC- in the I band for the same sample
viewed at z taking into account various instrumental and background ecid11ects
see text for details
Such simulations suggest the trends seen in the MDS are reasonably robust
although certain cid13occulent late type spirals could conceivably be misinterpreted
as interactingpeculiar systems Extending these trends one might worry that
star forming galaxies might ultimately break up into disparate H II regions
of small apparent size cf the train-wrecks in Dickinsons image of C at
z and Dressler et als  nascent galaxies supposedly at z 
 Conclusions
Several dicid11erent lines of enquiry converge on the identicid12cation of two very dif-
ferent galaxy populations Massive regular galaxies roughly decid12ned as sym-
metrical spirals and ellipticals more luminous than  L
 appear to have
cid3
changed little since z - and the bulk of the star formation in the earlier
types occurred very early indeed z - In contrast even the modest red-
shift z  Universe was dwarf dominated and this dwarf population has
rapidly declined in recent times These systems are less well-formed and show
intense star formation possibly of a bursting type
I see two unsolved problems In hierarchical theories of galaxy formation
such as those that form the basis of simulations by Kaucid11man et al  and
Cole et al  dwarfs and globular clusters form early in great abundance
around dark matter halos with low circular velocities Merging reduces the
number of dwarfs with time but steep faint end slopes to the local LFs are still
expected today unless feedback and other processes are very ecid11ective The end
point of these simulations is closer to the observed Universe at z  Figure 
rather than z A further dicid14culty is the older ages for the massive galaxies
which is at cid12rst sight counter to the expectations of hierarchical growth
The clue to solving this problem as recognised by Babul  Rees 
lies in preventing a ma jor component of the dwarf population from forming
stars until late times Babul  Ferguson  show how star formation might
be inhibited by the ionising UV background until recent epochs A feature
of this picture would be the sudden collapse of such systems over a narrow
redshift interval when the associated gas neutralises Efstathiou  In this
respect the irregular morphologies of the HST images and the wide range in
luminosity and redshift at which the evolving population is seen Fig  is
puzzling Although it is claimed the small physical sizes of the MDS sources
Im et al  is consistent with this picture not enough work has been done
to separate the evolving and quiescent components or in understanding obvious
biases which may render large sources as compact ones Figure 
The second unsolved problem concerns the fate of these star-forming dwarfs
Figures - demonstrate this problem observationally very clearly Excess ob-
jects in the high z LF could fade to lower luminosities but given the wide
redshift range over which the OII-strong sources are seen the decay would
appear to be too rapid for conventional stellar mass functions As most of the
present-day low luminosity systems are gas-rich McGaugh  no conclusive
observational evidence for fading has yet been presented
Alternatively the dwarfs could disappear via minor merging into larger
galaxies Broadhurst et al  showed qualitatively how self-similar merging
is consistent with both the optical and infrared photometric and redshift data
The picture is largely under attack from theorists who ob ject to the high merg-
ing rates required and the likely ecid11ect this will have on the morphologies of
the merger products Observationally it is exceedingly dicid14cult to test the idea
further Although the angular correlation function wcid18 shows no convincing
statistical excess of pairs on small scales a signicid12cant percentage - of
the MDS sample appear to be interacting systems supporting earlier investiga-
tions Zepf  Koo  Given the rapid timescale involved even if only a
fraction of these are genuinely merging the phenomenon must be signicid12cant
None of the proposed solutions to either unsolved problem is particularly
attractive On the positive side the disparity between the two populations of
galaxies revealed by a number of independent observations is a sound result
which will hopefully lead to the understanding of a ma jor new physical process
in galaxy formation On the negative side I do worry about the absurdity
of switching on a dominant optical component of the Universe in the most
recent few Gyr only to allow it to fade rapidly into obscurity This seems
specicid12cally contrived to cid12t the puzzling observations However when you have
eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the
truth Conan-Doyle
