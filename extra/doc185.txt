Abstract
If we are to develop a comprehensive and predictive theory of galaxy formation and evolution it 
is essential that we obtain an accurate assessment of how and when galaxies assemble their stel-
lar populations and how this assembly varies with environment There is strong observational 
support for the hierarchical assembly of galaxies but by definition the dwarf galaxies we see to-
day are not the same as the dwarf galaxies and proto-galaxies that were disrupted during the as-
sembly Our only insight into those disrupted building blocks comes from sifting through the re-
solved field populations of the surviving giant galaxies to reconstruct the star formation history 
chemical evolution and kinematics of their various structures  To obtain the detailed distribution 
of stellar ages and metallicities over the entire life of a galaxy one needs multi-band photometry 
reaching solar-luminosity main sequence stars  The Hubble Space Telescope can obtain such 
data in the outskirts of Local Group galaxies  To perform these essential studies for a fair sample 
of the Local Universe will require observational capabilities that allow us to extend the study of 
resolved stellar populations to much larger galaxy samples that span the full range of galaxy 
morphologies while also enabling the study of the more crowded regions of relatively nearby 
galaxies  With such capabilities in hand we will reveal the detailed history of star formation and 
chemical evolution in the universe
Introduction
The study of galaxy evolution is pursued on two distinct fronts the high-redshift universe and 
the local galactic neighborhood  In the high-z universe we are directly observing the evolution 
of galaxies with time in an enormous sample of galaxies but the properties of interest morphol-
ogy kinematics age metallicity are not directly accessible instead crude and degenerate diag-
nostics can be used in a composite sense on the scale of a resolution element  In the local vol-
ume we can use methods that accurately measure these properties in resolved stellar popula-
tions but we can only do so in a small sample of galaxies as they presently exist  High-redshift 
and galactic neighborhood studies are clearly complementary but together they do not yet ade-
quately explore the required parameter space  Progress in high-z work will require pushing back 
to the time of first light and the birth of galaxies while progress in the local volume requires we 
accurately measure star formation histories beyond the Local Group  
The most robust method for measuring the star formation history of a stellar population comes 
from analysis of a color-magnitude diagram CMD that includes both the bright giant stars and 
the faint dwarf stars  Today the Hubble Space Telscope HST can obtain the detailed star for-
mation history in populations within a Mpc but unfortunately our immediate neighborhood is 
too rural for such work see van den Bergh 2000  The Local Group is a cosmological backwa-
ter with only two giant spiral galaxies the Milky Way and Andromeda and a few dozen dwarf 
galaxies mostly in orbit around the two giants  Some of the major morphological classes are 
not represented at all eg giant elliptical and lenticular galaxies and even the classes that are 
represented are not present in statistically meaningful numbers  For example the intermediate-
mass spiral M33 is the most common type of spiral in the universe Marinoni et al 1999 but 
M33 is the only representative of such a system in the Local Group  Beyond the Milky Way sys-

tem  we have obtained a handful of HST pencil beams through some Local Group galaxies but 
we simply have not characterized the assembly history in a representative sample of galaxies nor 
done so over a representative range of substructures of the known galaxy classes  The result is 
that our understanding of the star formation history in galaxies is highly skewed toward the few 
accessible examples in the case of spirals or based upon indirect and degenerate diagnostics in 
the case of ellipticals which are currently too distant for direct methods  Even so the small 
steps we have taken so far have changed the way we view the assembly of galaxies and obtain-
ing a fair sample of stellar populations in galaxies is assured to yield substantial breakthroughs  
We shall use the recent exploration of Andromeda M31 as an example  Out to a distance of 
25 kpc in the M31 halo the metallicity exceeds that in our own halo by an order of magnitude 
Mould  Kristian 1986 Durrell et al 1994 2001  These studies obtained the metallicity dis-
tribution from the colors of red giant branch RGB and asymptotic giant branch AGB stars  In 
principle the luminosity distributions of the RGB and AGB stars also provide insight into the 
age of a population in broad age bins of young  3 Gyr intermediate age 3 - 8 Gyr and old 
8 - 13 Gyr stars  In practice obtaining these luminosity distributions is difficult to accomplish 
in sparse field populations due to the combination of photometric scatter broad metallicity 
range uncertainties in apparent distance modulus poor statistics for the brightest giants and 
contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies  As a consequence the M31 halo 
was assumed to be ancient  10 Gyr old  That picture changed when HST was able to image 
faint main sequence stars in M31 albeit outside of the crowded interior  The M31 halo was 
found to host significant numbers of intermediate-age stars presumably from a significant 
merger event Brown et al 2003 Fig 1  A followup program probed the giant tidal stream and 
outer disk of M31 with main sequence photometry  The metallicity and age distributions in the 
stream were found to be very similar to those in the halo suggesting that the halo was polluted 
with the debris from this disrupted satellite Brown et al 2006  This hypothesis was further 
borne out by N-body simulations Fardal et al 2007 and kinematic surveys Gilbert et al 2007  
The population in the outer disk of M31 appears to be similar to that in the local Galactic thick 
disk and does not include as many young stars as some disk formation models predict Brown et 
al 2006  Recently an extended metal-poor halo was found in M31 Guhathakurta et al 2005 
Irwin et al 2005 Kalirai et al 2006 spanning 20 degrees on the sky There was speculation that 
this outer halo was the true halo perhaps being both metal-poor and ancient but deep pho-
tometric programs found intermediate-age stars in the extended halo as well Brown et al 2008  
While semi-analytical models of galaxy formation have been used to simulate merger histories 
for the giant galaxies eg Bullock  Johnson 2005 they have not made firm predictions on the 
distributions of age and metallicity in the disrupted satellites  These star formation history inves-
tigations and others like them are starting to provide the data required to constrain the popula-
tions in these hierarchical assembly histories eg Font et al 2008  Ironically we know more 
about the age distribution in the M31 halo than we do in the Milky Way halo due to reddening 
and distance uncertainties in the latter  There is some indication the Galaxy has had an unusually 
quiescent merger history and that M31 is more representative of giant spiral galaxies eg 
Hammer et al 2007 but there is no way to know the variety of star formation histories in galax-
ies without a significant sample to explore

The reconstruction of star formation histories in a wide range of galaxy types will reveal not only 
their star formation histories but the types of galaxies that were hierarchically assembled to
construct the giant galaxies we see today  Despite the enormous successes of the cold dark mat-
terCDM paradigm CDM predicts that giant galaxies such as the Milky Way and M31 should 
be surrounded by many more dwarf galaxies than are actually observed eg Moore et al 1999  
The discovery of tidally disrupted satellites around the Milky Way eg Sgr dwarf Ibata et al 
1994 and M31 eg the giant stellar stream Ibata et al 2001 rekindled searches for faint or 
disrupted satellites in the Local Group that would possibly account for these missing satellites  
Large surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have discovered many new members of the 
Milky Way eg Willman et al 2005 Zucker et al 2006 and M31 eg Zucker et al 2007 Ma-
jewski et al 2007 systems  However even if the ongoing discovery of new satellite galaxies 
reduces the magnitude of the missing satellite problem these powerful surveys will never find 
the satellites that were already dispersed  By definition the surviving satellites are not the same 
objects as the dwarf galaxies and proto-galaxies that were disrupted during hierarchical assem-
bly  This fact is highlighted by chemical differences between nearby dwarf spheroidal dSph 
galaxies and the Galactic halo which suggest the halo is not comprised of populations like those 
of present-day dSphs Shetrone et al 2003 Insight into these objects must come from analysis 
of the field populations in the giant galaxies of today  Indeed the population in the inner halo of 
M31 has been tied to a specific merger event that has not yet completed as described above
Methodology
The best tool for the reconstruction of star formation histories in nearby galaxies is photometry 
reaching dwarf stars on the main sequence  The color and luminosity of the main sequence turn-
off and subgiant branch are very sensitive to both metallicity and age while the color of the RGB 
is much more sensitive to metallicity than age  Spectroscopy of the bright giants can provide 
additional metallicity constraints total metallicity alpha enhancement etc and kinematic in-
formation  With a CMD that includes both the bright giant stars and faint dwarf stars one can 
disentangle the effects of age and metallicity to obtain the detailed distribution of these parame-
ters in a stellar population Fig 2  A CMD that achieves a signal-to-noise ratio SNR of 5 at a 
point 05 mag below the oldest main sequence turnoff in a population allows the reconstruction 
of the star formation history with age bins of 1 Gyr over the entire lifetime of a galaxy and me-
tallicity bins of 02 dex over the full range of abundances  A solar analog absolute MV5 mag 
is a familiar and approximate reference point for the depth that must be reached  The fitting of 
such CMDs was originally restricted to Galactic star clusters eg Sandage 1953 but over time 
the fitting of CMDs has expanded to cover composite populations first in Galactic satellites but 
eventually throughout the Local Group eg Tosi et al 1991 Gallart et al 1999 Holtzman et al 
1999 Harris  Zaritsky 2001 Dolphin 2002 Brown et al 2006 Cole et al 2007
For background-limited observations with a diffraction-limited telescope the distance at which 
one can obtain photometry of faint stars is linearly proportional to the aperture diameter assum-
ing all other parameters are held fixed bandpass exposure time SNR instrument performance 
etc  This is true in both sparse and crowding-limited regions  In M31 HST can obtain

Fig 2 - Top panels Four hypothetical populations of stars  In each population the stars are 
equally distributed among 20 isochrones distinct in age and metallicity  Bottom panels Model 
CMDs for these hypothetical populations with the observational errors of observations obtained 
in the M31 halo using HST Brown et al 2006  Because the main sequence turnoff subgiant 
branch and red giant branch all respond differently to changes in age and metallicity a CMD 
that includes both the faint dwarfs and bright giants in a population breaks the age-metallicity 
degeneracy that would be present in observations of stars in a single evolutionary stage
photometry of faint main sequence stars in regions where the surface brightness is roughly 26 V 
mag arcsec-2 or fainter  This brightness falls at 10 kpc on the minor axis and 25 kpc on the 
major axis the interior is currently unavailable to such probes  Although the field cannot be too 
crowded it cannot be too sparse either because an accurate star formation history in a complex 
population requires a CMD of 10000 stars for age bins of 1 Gyr metallicity bins of 02 dex 
and sensitivity to sub-populations at the 20 level  To do analogous work in a galaxy 10 
times further away than M31 we need a telescope with an aperture that is 10 times larger than 
HST  The stars are 100 times fainter but we have 100 times the collecting area so we get the 
same signal  The sky background is 100 times brighter per unit area on the sky due to the larger 
collecting area but the area of each resolution element is 100 times smaller so the sky signal 
within a resolution element stays the same  Thus the SNR is the same for a given observing

Concentric circles indicate where space obser-
vatories can obtain SNR5 photometry of a

tories indicated are HST red circle ATLAST 
8m green circle and ATLAST 16m blue cir-
time  Surface brightness is conserved - a given patch of stars is in an area 100 times smaller but 
the stars are 100 times fainter and we are putting 100 times more resolution elements there  If 
the larger telescope has the same field of view as the smaller telescope the larger telescope will 
have the advantage of sampling more physical real estate in the more distant galaxy  Further-
more we are comparing here the performance of differently sized observatories at their distant 
limits but the larger telescope provides enormous advantages in nearby galaxies that are within 
reach of both The larger telescope can not only probe more crowded regions instead of the faint 
outskirts currently accessible to HST but can also survey much more efficiently because the ex-
posure time to obtain background-limited photometry of stars at a fixed distance is inversely 
proportional to the fourth power of aperture size  
Future Capabilities Needed
With an observatory similar to HST having an aperture in the 8 to 16 meter range we can finally 
explore the full range of galaxy types and the variety of their structures because the reach of 
such a telescope extends well beyond our rural Local Group into the more cosmopolitan Coma 
Sculptor Cloud Fig 3  The Advanced Technology Large Aperture Space Telescope ATLAST 
would be such a telescope and it is currently the subject of a NASA-funded study led by M 
Postman  An 8 meter aperture is needed to reach at least one giant elliptical while a 16 meter 
aperture is needed to reach a significant sample of both giant ellipticals and giant spirals Fig 4    
In the current era there is a synergy between HST and large ground telescopes like Keck  HST 
imaging can provide accurate photometry of faint dwarf stars at V30 mag in Local Group gal-
axies while Keck spectroscopy can provide radial velocities for bright giant stars at V22 mag 
in the same populations providing important kinematical context eg see Fig 1   The James 
Webb Space Telscope JWST  will extend our reach for this work to galaxies 50 more distant 
than those available to HST  In the era of a 16m ATLAST and a 30m ground telescope eg 
Brown et al                                                                                                   The History of Star Formation in Galaxies
TMT this synergy will move outward to much more distant galaxies with ATLAST obtaining 
photometry of V35 mag dwarf stars in the Coma Sculptor Cloud and TMT obtaining kinematics 
of bright giants in the same populations  These faint dwarf stars are effectively impossible with 
TMT requiring Gigaseconds of integration even for an isolated star  A space platform is required 
for this type of work because one needs stable high-precision photometry for thousands of stars 
in large crowded large fields with faint sky backgrounds and this photometry must be accurate 
for stars spanning a large dynamic range LSun to 10000 times brighter
