Abstract We investigate the cosmological evolution of large- and small-scale magnetic elds in
galaxies at high redshifts Results from simulations of hierarchical structure formation cosmology
provide a tool to develop an evolutionary model of regular magnetic elds coupled to galaxy
formation and evolution Turbulence in protogalactic halos generated by thermal virialization
can drive an ecient turbulent dynamo The mean-eld dynamo theory is used to derive the
timescales of amplication and ordering of regular magnetic elds in disk and dwarf galaxies
For future observations with the SKA we predict an anticorrelation at xed redshift between
galaxy size and the ratio between ordering scale and galaxy size Undisturbed dwarf galaxies
should host fully coherent elds at z  1 spiral galaxies at z  05

1 Introduction importance of magnetic evolution in galaxies
The observed polarized synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation showed the presence
of regular large-scale magnetic elds with spiral patterns in the disks of nearby spiral
galaxies Beck 2005 which were successfully reproduced by mean-eld dynamo theory
Beck et al 1996 Shukurov 2005 It is therefore natural to apply dynamo theory also in
predicting the generation of magnetic elds in young galaxies at high redshifts
We now have sucient evidence that strong magnetic elds were present in the early
Universe z  3 Bernet et al 2008 Seymour et al 2008 and that synchrotron emission
from distant galaxies should be detected with future radio telescopes such as the Square
Kilometre Array SKA The SKA will allow us to observe an enormous number of distant
galaxies at similar resolution to that achievable for nearby galaxies today van der Hulst et
al 2004 The formation and evolution of regular large-scale magnetic elds is intimately
related to the formation and evolution of disks in galaxies in terms of geometrical and
physical parameters A more robust understanding of the history of magnetism in young
galaxies may help to solve fundamental cosmological questions about the formation and
evolution of galaxies Gaensler et al 2004
2 Three-phase model for the evolution of magnetic elds in galaxies
We have used the dynamo theory to derive the timescales of amplication and ordering
of magnetic elds in disk and quasi-spherical galaxies Arshakian et al 2008 This has
provided a useful tool in developing a simple evolutionary model of regular magnetic
elds coupled with models describing the formation and evolution of galaxies In the hi-
erarchical structure formation scenario we identied three main phases of magnetic-eld
Arshakian et al
evolution in galaxies In the epoch of dark matter halo formation seed magnetic elds of
 1018 G strength could have been generated in protogalaxies by the Biermann battery
or Weibel instability rst phase Turbulence in the protogalactic halo generated by
thermal virialization could have driven the turbulent small-scale dynamo and amplify
the seed eld to the equipartition level of  20 G within a few 108 yr second phase
In the epoch of disk formation the turbulent eld served as a seed for the mean-eld
large-scale dynamo in the disk third phase
We dened three characteristic timescales for the evolution of galactic magnetic elds
one for the amplication of the seed eld a second for the amplication of the large-
scale regular eld and a third for the eld ordering on the galactic scale Arshakian et
al 2008 Galaxies similar to the Milky Way formed their disk at z  10 Regular elds
of equipartition several G strength and a few kpc coherence length were generated
within 2 Gyr until z  3 but eld ordering up to the coherence scale of the galaxy
size took another 6 Gyr until z  05 Giant galaxies had already formed their disk at
z  10 allowing more ecient dynamo generation of equipartition regular elds with
a coherence length of about 1 kpc until z  4 However the age of the Universe is too
young for fully coherent elds to have already developed in giant galaxies larger than
about 15 kpc Dwarf galaxies formed even earlier and should have hosted fully coherent
elds at z  1 Major mergers excited starbursts with enhanced turbulence which in turn
amplied the turbulent eld whereas the regular eld was disrupted and required several
Gyr to recover Measurement of regular elds can serve as a clock for measuring the time
since the last starburst event Starbursts due to major mergers enhance the turbulent
eld strength by a factor of a few and drive a fast wind outow which magnetizes the
intergalactic medium Observations of the radio emission from distant starburst galaxies
can provide an estimate of the total magnetic-eld strength in the IGM
This evolutionary scenario can be tested by measurements of polarized synchrotron
emission and Faraday rotation with the SKA We predict  i an anticorrelation at xed
redshift between galaxy size and the ratio between ordering scale and galaxy size ii
undisturbed dwarf galaxies should host fully coherent large-scale elds at z  1 spiral
galaxies at z  05 iii weak regular elds small Faraday rotation in spiral galaxies at
z  3 but possibly associated with strong anisotropic elds strong polarized emission
would be signatures of major mergers
