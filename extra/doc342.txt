Abstract Nearby D 100 Mpc luminous blue starburst galaxies fre-
quently show morphological evidence for recent involvement in mild col-
lisions or minor mergers where the disk survives As a consequence
UV-bright starbursts are preferentially seen in near face-on galaxies and
the postburst systems may become star-forming late-type galaxies If this
starburst evolutionary channel is important at moderate redshifts then
descendants of the faint blue galaxies could be the very common Sm-Sd
eld galaxies
1 Objectives
Starburst galaxies provide unique opportunities to study rapid phases of galac-
tic evolution The Wisconsin starburst project focuses on nearby ultraviolet-
bright starbursts selected from the spectrophotometric sample of Gallagher et
al 1989 They resemble intermediate redshift z  05-1 compact narrow
emission line galaxies CNELGs eg Guzeman et al 1998 in terms of their
small sizes blue luminosities and OII emission line equivalent widths eg
MB  18 and EWOII  25 A with U  B  02
Our strategy is based on the analysis of multi-band imaging and area spec-
troscopy obtained with the WIYN 35-m telescope 1 and high angular resolution
WFPC2 and FOC HST images
Images provide global morphologies colors
and the small scale structures of star-forming sites Spectra from the WIYN
Densepak multi-ber array are used to measure global velocity elds in the ion-
ized gas eg Homeier  Gallagher 1999 HG99
Interactions and Starbursts
Interactions are well-established starburst triggers Because of the huge range of
possible interaction parameters we expect and observe considerable variance in
the responses of galaxies to interactions Our emphasis is on weak interactions

such as minor mergers or mild collisions in which at least one member of the
colliding pair survives with its initial structure relatively intact
The signatures of recent galaxy interactions are well-known and in the opti-
cal include luminous tails of tidal debris or ripples in post-interaction systems
These features often have low surface brightnesses andor small angular sizes
imaging with telescopes like WIYN that combine excellent surface brightness
sensitivity with good angular resolution 07 arcsec seeing is valuable for de-
termining the structures of these types of systems The signposts of interactions
evolve on galaxy orbital time scales of 108 yr with infall of tidal debris possi-
bly continuing for 109 yr after this evidence of a collision will be dicult to
detect
Starbursts are found from their prominent populations of high mass stars
which are the products of upward spikes in star formation rates This is obvious
when the starburst is optically visible and gives rise to high surface brightnesses
blue optical colors and strong emission lines Starbursts also produce supergiant
HII complexes massive and compact super star clusters and the peculiar kpc-
scale clumps of OB stars whose existence was emphasized more than 20 years
ago by J Heidmann and collaborators as symptoms of hyperactive star forma-
tion While the evolutionary time scales of individual star-forming complexes
within starbursts are not well known data from M82 suggest this occurs in less
than 108 yr Satyapal et al 1997 Gallagher  Smith 1999 The internal struc-
ture of a starburst evolves more quickly than structural perturbations induced
by the dynamical inuence of a colliding galaxy
3 Four Examples of Luminous Blue Starbursts
The optical structures of four luminous starbursts within 100 Mpc provide some
examples of star formation produced in a variety of collisions
Markarian 8 is a strongly interacting system Figure 1
It apparently
consists of two small disk galaxies Our WFPC2 images show one of these to
be strongly disturbed while the other remains an organized coplanar system
Gallagher et al 2000 Both objects have high inclinations but the system
still has blue colors and strong OII emission
Haro 1 a nearly face-on galaxy can be seen in Figure 2 to be experiencing
a weak interaction with a dwarf companion Even though only mild optical
distortions are present in Haro 1 it is in a late phase of an intense starburst
the integrated spectrum shows strong Balmer absorptions
NGC 3310 is one of the nearest examples of a luminous UV-bright star-
burst and has been extensively studied in the optical and IR and mapped in
HI The starburst probably was caused by a minor merger Mulder et al 1995
Conselice et al 2000 Large scale organization of star formation in NGC 3310
is located in a nearly symmetric two-arm spiral pattern and around a mildly
distorted circum-nuclear ring as shown in the color map in Figure 2 Evidently
a strong starburst was initiated with little collisional disruption to the surviving
gas-rich disk galaxy seen at low inclination
NGC 7673 an archetypical clumpy irregular has a highly disturbed inner
structure dominated by four huge star-forming complexes Figure 2 WFPC2
optical and UV imaging resolve the clumps into clusters of compact star clusters
Blue Starbursts

from a WIYN R-band image left and high resolution image of the center from
similar to conditions in M82 OConnell et al 1995 The clumps are located
within a faint relatively symmetric outer disk that also contains a faint stellar
arc or ripple HG99 This starburst is a remnant of a past interaction with
NGC 7678 Nordgren et al 1997 or a minor merger
HG99 measured the H velocity eld of NGC 7673 with WIYN using the
Densepak array They found that the inner part of the galaxy is almost exactly
face-on and dynamically cold The wings of the line are broadened most likely
by gas outows from the disk and the integrated H line prole closely resembles
those observed in CNELGs by Guzman et al 1996 However in this case we
know that we are not seeing a spheroidal system in formation but rather a
nearly face-on disk
4 Summary of Observed Properties
Our data demonstrate the production of intense starbursts in weak interactions
in which at least one of the original disks survives One channel for the produc-
tion of compact luminous galaxies therefore modies rather than destroys stellar
disks and some post-starburst systems will be small disk galaxies
Disk geometries introduce a prejudice for optically- or UV- bright starbursts
to be seen at low inclinations where disk obscuration is minimized M82 is a
nearby example from our perspective it is an IR-starburst but the brilliant UV
reection nebula seen above the disk in FOCAS images imply that when seen at
low inclination M82 is a UV-bright starburst This is a statistical trend some
galaxies such as Markarian 8 or chain galaxies at moderate redshifts are blue
and inclined A bias to select blue starbursts in low inclination disks will also
lead to narrow velocity line widths in integrated optical spectra these are not
necessarily signatures of low mass dwarf galaxies
Our data do not show a simple relationship between the stage of an inter-
action and starburst properties intense starbursts occur in both the ongoing
Markarian 8 and very late NGC 7673 interactions This complicates our ability
to distinguish collisionally induced starbursts since the clear signatures of an

problem is especially severe when dealing with faint blue galaxies at moderate
redshifts where information is often sparse Ellis 1997
5 Discussion
A simple model assumes that luminous blue starbursts take place in gas-rich late-
type disk galaxies that remain as disks after the event Many nearby starbursts
are rich in HI and have the fuel to support post-burst star-formation These
types of post-burst objects would be less easily distinguished than extreme cases
where star formation is truncated after a burst giving rise to distinctive E 
A spectra The ingredients of our simple recipe for luminous starbursts follows
Blue Starbursts
1 Store gas in a dynamically cold low density disk Such disks are excellent
storage places to keep gas as they have low intrinsic rates of evolution and
populations of such thin cold disk galaxies exist at the current epoch Matthews
et al 2000
2 Perturb the disk with an interaction a merger with a galaxy having
10 or less of the total mass or even a near miss from a comparable or larger
neighbor should suce What we require is that gas be driven to the central
few kpc of the disk where it can support intense star formation Gas transport
can be produced directly by the perturber or indirectly through production of
3 Orient galaxy to be nearly face-on and observe a blue UV-bright star-
burst with narrow emission lines Otherwise observe an edge-on system to see
an M82-type moderately-luminous IR-starburst
4 Wait a few Gyr until done The result may be a late-type system with
a moderately thick stellar disk a product of collisional disk heating during the
interaction Reshetnikov  Combes 1997 The interaction also could produce
an o-center bar yielding a Magellanic irregular This channel for making Mag-
ellanic systems is observationally suggested by the preference for such galaxies
to have companions Odewahn 1994 and theoretical models that produce char-
acteristic o-center bars during collisions Levine  Sparke 1998
