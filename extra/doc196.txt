Abstract
vironment with red galaxies dominating galaxy clusters and blue galaxies dom-
inating the general eld However not all eld galaxies are young studies
of the colors line strengths and ML ratios of massive early-type galaxies at
0  z  13 show that the most massive galaxies do not seem to care about
their surroundings and have very similar ages irrespective of their environment
There is good evidence that the growth of these galaxies does continue longer
in the eld than in clusters via nearly dissipationless mergers of already old
galaxies These results are consistent with predictions of recent galaxy formation
models which incorporate AGN feedback to suppress star formation in the most
massive halos Systematic studies of the relation of galaxies with their environ-
ment beyond z  1 are dicult and still somewhat contradictory Intriguingly
both the DEEP-2 and VVDS surveys nd that the color-density relation disap-
pears at z  13 unfortunately just at the point where both surveys become
highly incomplete On the other hand clustering studies at z  25 have shown
that red galaxies cluster more strongly than blue galaxies implying that the
color-density relation was already in place at that redshift
Introduction
It has been known for many decades that the properties of galaxies correlate
strongly with their environment Early studies demonstrated that galaxies in
rich clusters are usually red and often have early-type morphologies whereas
most galaxies in the general eld are blue spiral galaxies Dressler 1980 showed
that the morphology of galaxies is a smoothly varying function of local projected
density setting the stage for many studies over the following decades which
quantied this morphology-density relation better and tried to identify the cause
or causes Weinmann et al 2006 present what could perhaps be described as
the 21st century version of the morphology-density relation by quantifying the
dependence of galaxy color star formation rate and morphology on halo mass
using a large sample drawn from the SDSS
A key question is why there are red galaxies at all Models suggest that
gas should continuously accrete onto halos shock heat to the virial temperature
and subsequently cool leading to sustained star formation in a disk and blue
colors associated with newly formed stars eg Fall  Efstathiou 1980 The
existence of large numbers of apparently ancient galaxies in particular in rich
clusters is not easily explained in this context As observations and models have
become more and more sophisticated this 20 year old problem has not gone
away but instead is the topic of extensive debate
van Dokkum  Quadri
A partial solution implemented in semi-analytical models of the 1990s
is to postulate that gas cooling is disrupted due to ram pressure stripping
harrassment or other processes if a galaxy is subsumed in a more massive
halo and becomes a satellite eg Kaumann et al 1999 This nurture
solution naturally produces red galaxies in clusters with the exception of the
central galaxy and blue eld galaxies More recently other mechanisms were
added In current models star formation is halted when galaxies exceed a critical
mass scale nature even if they are the central galaxy in their halo This
suppression can be due to AGN feedback eg Croton et al 2006 andor may
occur naturally as a result of virial shocks Birnboim Dekel  Neistein 2007
The observational challenge is to assess the importance of these various proposed
nurture and nature mechanisms as a function of mass environment and cosmic
Figure 1
The origin of old red galaxies can be phrased in nurture versus
nature terms Here nurture is a catch-all phrase for the processes which
lead to the cessation of star formation in a galaxy which becomes a satellite in
a more massive halo Nature refers to the various processes that have been
proposed to suppress star formation in galaxies when they exceed a critical
halo mass such as AGN feedback and shock heating
2 The Stellar Age of Massive Galaxies
A long-standing prediction of hierarchical models is that massive galaxies in
low mass halos have very dierent formation histories than massive galaxies in
high mass halos Cluster galaxies form early and their evolution is eectively
frozen shortly after they become part of a dynamically relaxed massive halo
their velocities are too high to permit mergers and various processes rob them
of their ability to form new stars By contrast massive galaxies in the eld are
expected to grow substantially at late times through mergers and possibly star
formation eg Kaumann 1996 de Lucia et al 2006
We rst turn to the star formation epoch of massive galaxies The Kau-
mann 1996 models which did not include AGN feedback predicted that the

 van der Marel 2007 The age dierence between eld and cluster galaxies
implied by their luminosity evolution is small at  4 
stars in eld early-type galaxies1 should be younger than those in cluster early-
type galaxies by  4 Gyr Models that include AGN feedback eg de Lucia et
al 2006 predict a much smaller age dierence of order  07 Gyr
Observational studies of early-type galaxies have provided conicting evi-
dence on the age dierence between massive eld- and cluster early-type galax-
ies Studies of the local Mg2   relation and Fundamental Plane FP nd
very small age dierences between eld and cluster galaxies eg Bernardi et al
2006 However Thomas et al 2005 and Clemens et al 2006 nd age dier-
ences of 15  2 Gyr from tting absorption line strengths of nearby galaxies with
complex models that include age metallicity -enhancement and in the case
of Clemens et al carbon enhancement as free parameters Studies at higher
redshift are also ambiguous Treu et al 2005 van der Wel et al 2005 and
Rusin  Kochanek 2005 nd very small age dierences from measurements of
ML ratios but di Serego Alighieri et al 2006 nd age dierences of 35  4
Gyr from very similar data
In order to resolve these conicting results and to provide a robust mea-
surement of the stellar age of massive galaxies we have recently compiled FP
measurements of cluster- and eld galaxies at 0  z  13 from the litera-
ture and placed them on a consistent photometric and dynamical system van
Dokkum  van der Marel 2007 The results are shown in Fig 2 the ML
ratios of massive eld and cluster galaxies evolve in very similar fashion with

not hold at higher redshift

little or no systematic oset Their age dierence is 04  02 Gyr inconsistent
with nurture-only models and in good agreement with the de Lucia et al 2006
AGN feedback model
3 Dry Mergers
The ability of current semi-analytical models to reproduce the stellar ages and
colors of massive elliptical galaxies at 0  z  1 is a major achievement but it
is somewhat tangential to one of their central tenets the prediction that these
objects were assembled relatively recently through mergers In clusters mergers
should be rare as the relative velocities of galaxies are too high However in
the general eld mergers should continue to the present day Specically the
de Lucia et al 2006 model predicts that massive ellipticals typically assem-
ble 50  of their nal mass at z  08 and 20  at z  04 It is fairly clear
both observationally and theoretically that these recent mergers must have been
mostly dry The star formation induced by gas-rich mergers would dramati-
cally change the colors and ML ratios of massive elliptical galaxies inconsistent
with observations Similarly semi-analytical models predict that the most re-
cent mergers of massive galaxies were mostly gas-poor eg Khochfar  Burkert
2003 Kang van den Bosch  Pasquali 2007
Observationally there is good evidence that dry mergers frequently occur in
z  1 clusters before they are fully virialized van Dokkum et al 1999 Tran et
al 2005 Mei et al 2006 However the importance of dry merging in the general
eld is still somewhat of an open question Summing up current thinking 1
there is no doubt that dry mergers occur 2 they likely aected a large fraction
of the elliptical galaxy population but 3 they may have had only a limited
eect on the evolution of the luminosity function of red galaxies
Starting with 1 the recognition of dry mergers goes back to the Hubble
atlas and Arps catalog see eg Arp 169  172  although back then mergers
were not classied by their aridity Combes et al 1995 studied the stellar
dynamics of E-E pairs and illustrated some of the features that occur in mergers
of hot stellar systems An example of a dry merger at z  01 is shown in Fig
3 the ground-based image shows the tidal features the ACS image shows the
early-type morphologies of the interacting pair and the spectrum demonstrates
that the red colors stem from old stars not from a dust-enshrouded star burst
The diculty in assessing 2 ie how many elliptical galaxies experienced
dry mergers is that they progress very rapidly and leave little evidence Tidal
tails disperse quickly due to the high velocity dispersions of the progenitors
and the blue high surface brightness star forming regions that often grace gas-
rich mergers are absent Detecting tidal features requires very deep imaging
over large areas When those depths are reached red smooth tidal features
turn out to be very common
in a sample of 86 bulge-dominated red galaxies
in the NDWF and MUSYC surveys 71  show evidence for tidal interactions
van Dokkum 2005 see also Schweizer  Seitzer 1992
In one-third of the
tidally distorted galaxies the merger is still in progress and the properties of
the merging galaxies could be measured The median luminosity ratio of these
tidally interacting pairs is about 1  3 and the median color dierence is only
002 in B  R Taken together these results indicate that the majority of
Galaxy Evolution and Environment
Figure 3
Example of a dry merger in the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey
from van Dokkum 2005 The deep ground-based data were used to identify
the merging pair by its tidal features which have a surface brightness of
R  27 The spectrum shows that the galaxy light is dominated by old stars
note the LINER features and the ACS image shows that in this case the
merging galaxies have early-type morphologies
elliptical galaxies experienced a merger in its past that the progenitors were
already mostly red and dead and that these were not minor accretion events
Determining 3 the dry merger rate is perhaps the most important ques-
tion but it also is the most uncertain From the 19 merging pairs in van Dokkum
2005 it was estimated that dry mergers lead to a mass-accretion rate for galax-
ies on the red sequence of 009  004 Gyr1 that is a doubling in mass every
8 Gyr The uncertainty on this number is large and mainly driven by the
timescale that needs to be assumed in the calculation Bell et al 2006 also use
morphological criteria to identify dry mergers in the HSTACS GEMS eld
and estimate that early-type galaxies have undergone between 05 and 2 major
dry mergers since z  07 Red pair statistics will provide additional constraints
on the dry merger rate The rst study was done by Masjedi et al 2006a who
determined that the merger rate of Luminous Red Galaxies LRGs in SDSS
is very low However this rst analysis only considered mergers of LRGs with
each other and as these objects have L  4L they are typically the central
galaxies of groups Including less luminous neighbors Masjedi et al 2006b de-
rive an accretion rate of  0025 Gyr1 in better agreement with van Dokkum
2005 Bell et al 2006 and theoretical models We note that accretion rates
of 25  10  per Gyr do not imply a large eect on the luminosity function

of red galaxies Therefore recent claims that the high-mass end of the mass
function of red galaxies shows only modest evolution with redshift Brown et al
2007 Scarlata et al 2007 may be entirely consistent with the quoted studies
4 The Color-Density Relation at z  1
The color-density relation might be expected to break down at some early epoch
Studies that access the star formation epoch of cluster galaxies may nd that
red galaxies are rare in dense environments and see a rather at or possibly
even inverted color-density relation The technical challenges are formidable
as large volumes need to be probed with good redshift information and a careful
handling of systematics
Figure 4
The evolution of the contribution of red galaxies to the total
galaxy population for two dierent density bins from Cooper et al 2007
The red galaxy fraction decreases strongly with redshift in high density re-
gions suggesting that the color-density relation disappears by z  13
Two groups have recently presented measurements of the color-density re-
lation out to z  13 based on very large spectroscopic surveys Cucciati et al
2006 use an I-selected sample of 6582 galaxies from the VIMOS-VLT Deep
Survey VVDS to determine the evolution of the color-density relation They
nd that the red fraction increases with density at redshifts up to z  09 but
then turns over so that it is independent of density at z  13 Similarly Cooper
et al nd that the red galaxy fraction is about the same in low- and high-density
regions at z  13 from a sample of 19464 Rselected galaxies obtained in the
context of the Keck DEEP2 survey see Fig 4 This turnover redshift seems
rather low in particular in light of the existence of clusters with well-dened
red sequences at z  13 Both studies applied careful corrections for selection

Figure 5
The relation between correlation length and color for galaxies
at 2  z  35 in the MUSYC survey Quadri et al 2007 There is a clear
correlation implying that the color-density relation was already in place at
this epoch
eects a necessity as both surveys are highly incomplete at z  1 and the fact
that they are in agreement with each other obviously bolsters the condence in
their ndings Further renement of these intriguing results may have to await
surveys which probe the redshift range 1  z  2 with the same robustness as
DEEP2 and VVDS have surveyed the Universe out to z  1
5 Evidence for a Color-Density Relation at z  25
It is not yet possible to study the color-density relation at z  2 with the
same tools as has been done at 0  z  13 Nevertheless some progress has
been made by employing dierent techniques Steidel et al 2005 compared
the masses and ages of galaxies in an overdensity at z  23 to those of other
galaxies at the same redshift with the aid of Spitzer photometry Galaxies in the
overdensity have masses and ages which are a factor of  2 larger than those of
identically-selected galaxies outside the structure implying that galaxies already
know of their large-scale environment at this early epoch Continuing on this
theme Kodama et al 2007 recently identied a red sequence in overdensities
centered on four radio galaxies at 2  z  3
Another approach is to determine the relative clustering strength of red
and blue galaxies Daddi et al 2003 found that red galaxies selected by their
J  K color Franx et al 2003 in HDF-South cluster more strongly than blue
galaxies A similarly high clustering length was derived by Grazian et al 2006
in the CDF-South These initial results were conrmed by Quadri et al 2007
who for the rst time probed suciently large areas to study the clustering
of the dark matter halos of red galaxies As shown in Fig 5 there is a clear
relation between color and correlation length at z  25 suggesting that the
color-density relation was already in place at this redshift

6 Summary
Although environment clearly plays an important role in galaxy formation and
evolution the similarity of massive galaxies in clusters and in the general eld
demonstrates that other processes are also at work There is good evidence that
galaxies in clusters and in the eld experienced signicant dry merging but
the merger rates need to be determined better Studies beyond z  1 oer a
somewhat confused picture with the color-density relation seemingly absent at
z  13 and seemingly in place at z  25 Ongoing near-IR and Spitzer imaging
surveys should greatly enhance the statistics and allow direct comparisons of
high redshift galaxies in a wide range of environments
