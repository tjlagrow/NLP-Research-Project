Abstract
Studies of the molecular interstellar medium that fuels star formation and
supermassive black hole growth in galaxies at cosmological distances have undergone
tremendous progress over the past few years Based on the detection of molecular gas
in 120 galaxies at z1 to 64 we have obtained detailed insight on how the amount
and physical properties of this material in a galaxy are connected to its current star
formation rate over a range of galaxy populations Studies of the gas dynamics and
morphology at high spatial resolution allow us to distinguish between gas-rich merg-
ers in dierent stages along the merger sequence and disk galaxies Observations
of the most massive gas-rich starburst galaxies out to z5 provide insight into the role
of cosmic environment for the early growth of present-day massive spheroidal galax-
ies Large-area submillimeter surveys have revealed a rare population of extremely
far-infrared-luminous gas-rich high-redshift objects which is dominated by strongly
lensed massive starburst galaxies These discoveries have greatly improved our un-
derstanding of the role of molecular gas in the evolution of massive galaxies through
cosmic time
Introduction
Great progress has been made in studies of galaxy evolution out to high redshift over the
past years but there are a number of fundamental questions that remain to be answered
One of the most important remaining issues is to understand whether star formation
and the subsequent buildup of stellar mass in galaxies at early cosmic times occurs
dominantly through major mergers eg Springel et al 2005 or through a combination
of minor mergers and steady so-called cold-mode accretion eg Dekel et al 2009
This issue is closely connected to the question how galaxies obtain the dominantly
molecular gas that fuels star formation and what their gas mass fractions are Gas
mass fractions in relation to star formation rates determine the evolutionary state of a
galaxy eg Daddi et al 2010a Tacconi et al 2010 Next to these more general issues
it is important to better understand the physical properties chemical composition and
dynamics of the star-forming gas in high-z galaxies which set the initial conditions for
star formation eg Riechers et al 2006a 2008a Wei et al 2007
All of these fundamental issues are directly tied to studies of molecular gas in high
redshift galaxies Despite the great progress that has been made in this eld over the
past 15 years our understanding was ultimately limited by the technical capabilities
of past observatories in the centimeter to submillimeter wavelength range where the
most common molecular gas diagnostics can be observed at high redshift New ob-
servatories such as the Atacama Large subMillimeter Array ALMA that currently

nears completion will be key to ultimately solve many of the remaining mysteries in
this eld This article summarizes some of the most recent pre-ALMA progress in the
eld of molecular gas observations out to high redshift and how the gas properties en-
tangle with the driving mechanism of star formation in massive high redshift galaxies

To date molecular gas most commonly CO has been detected in 120 galaxies
at z1 see reviews by Solomon  Vanden Bout 2005 Omont 2007 Fig 1 back to
only 870 million years after the Big Bang corresponding to z642 eg Walter et al
2003 2004 Bertoldi et al 2003 Riechers et al 2009 The bulk of these galaxies are
massive hosting molecular gas reservoirs of Mgas1010 M commonly with high gas
fractions of at least tens of per cent The sensitivity of past observatories has only
allowed us to probe less massive andor less gas-rich systems with the aid of strong
gravitational lensing eg Baker et al 2004 Coppin et al 2007 Riechers et al 2010a
2011a Swinbank et al 2010 2011
Approximately 20 of the detected systems are massive gas-rich opticallynear-
infrared selected star forming galaxies SFGs eg Daddi et al 2010a Tacconi et
al 2010 and 30 each are far-infrared-luminous star-bursting quasars QSOs eg
Wang et al 2010 Riechers 2011b and submillimeter galaxies SMGs eg Greve et al
2005 Tacconi et al 2008 Fig 1 The rest of CO-detected high-redshift galaxies are
limited samples of galaxies selected through a variety of techniques such as Extremely
Red Objects EROs Star-Forming Radio-selected Galaxies SFRGs 24 m-selected
galaxies gravitationally lensed Lyman-break galaxies LBGs and radio galaxies RGs
see Riechers 2011a for a recent summary
Besides CO the high-density gas tracers HCN HCO HNC CN and H2O were
detected towards a small subsample of these galaxies eg Solomon et al 2003 Riech-
ers et al 2006b 2007 2010b 2011b Guelin et al 2007 Omont et al 2011
3 Luminosity Relations and the Star Formation Law
The CO luminosity L
CO is commonly considered to be a measure for the total molecular
gas mass Mgas in galaxies and the far-infrared FIR luminosity LFIR is considered to
be a measure for the star formation rate SFR eg Solomon  Vanden Bout 2005
Thus the relation between L
CO or Mgas and LFIR or SFR may be considered a spatially

integrated version of the Schmidt-Kennicutt star formation law between gas surface
density and star formation rate surface density eg Kennicutt 1998
CO but not at high L

dashed line At high L
CO there is tentative evidence for an o-

set of quasars toward higher LFIR This may indicate that AGN heating contributes
signicantly to LFIR at low L
Even in galaxies with luminous active galactic nuclei AGN LFIR is commonly
used as a proxy for the star formation rate in the host galaxy In principle both the
AGN and star formation can heat the dust that gives rise to the continuum ux observed
in the FIR but the characteristic dust temperatures of AGN heating are typically by a
factor of a few higher than those of dust heated by young stars Thus the warm dust
in AGN-starburst systems observed in the rest-frame FIR is commonly thought to be
dominated by heating within the host galaxy in particular in the most intense dust-
enshrouded starbursts If however LFIR were to be dominated by the AGN one would
expect an elevated LFIR for such galaxies in the L
COLFIR relation In Figure 2 right
panel a comparison of the L
COLFIR relation for nearby and high-z quasars to nearby
galaxies ultra-luminous infrared galaxies ULIRGs and SMGs without dominant
AGN is shown Riechers 2011b For galaxies with low L
CO there is an indication for
an excess in LFIR for quasars relative to other systems however there is no evidence
for such a trend at high L
CO This may suggest that in systems with relatively low gas
and dust content AGN contribute signicantly to LFIR but not in systems with high gas
and dust content Thus for massive high-redshift galaxies LFIR appears to be a good
proxy for the SFR even in quasars Riechers 2011b
CO Riechers 2011b
Beyond the issue of dust heating the question occurs if star formation progresses
In disk-like spiral galaxies like the Milky
the same way in all types of galaxies
Way star formation takes place in molecular clouds with compact dense cores con-
ned by self gravity eg Solomon et al 1987
In mergers such as the Antennae
DominikARiechers
NGC 403839 Fig 3 the gas and star formation appear to peak on the galaxy nu-
clei but also on relatively large scales in the dense overlap region between the merging
galaxies leading to the formation of so-called super star clusters eg Wilson et al
2003 Such constellations are also commonly found in the highest-resolution CO stud-
ies of high-redshift FIR-luminous massive galaxies Fig 3 eg Riechers et al 2008a
2008b In the nuclei of ULIRGs the most extreme nearby starbursts star formation
appears to occur in a dense intercloud medium bound by the potential of the galaxy
rather than in virialized clouds eg Downes  Solomon 1998 The dierences be-
tween starburst and disk galaxies are reected in the star formation law When compar-
ing the MgasLIR relation for three largest CO-detected samples at high z ie quasars
SMGs and SFGs to low redshift galaxies two interesting trends occur First SFGs
extend the relation found for nearby spiral galaxies to higher Mgas Second quasars
and SMGs extend the trend found for the most intense nearby starbursts and ULIRGs
to higher Mgas Both trends agree with the same slope but are oset by 11dex in LIR
Daddi et al 2010b interpret this as evidence for two sequences in this relation for disk
galaxies and starbursts which emerge from the dierent dynamical timescales of star
formation in these systems Fig 2 left see also Genzel et al 2010 Recent theoret-
ical studies have attempted to understand the dierent trends based on the underlying
conversion factor CO from L
CO to Mgas and nd that the two sequences could only
be unied to a single relation when assuming a broad continuum of conversion factors

4 Gas Dynamics A Merger Sequence of High Redshift Galaxies
The advent of the Expanded Very Large Array EVLA1 has recently enabled studies of
the full gas content distribution and dynamics of dierent populations of high-redshift
galaxies through observations of COJ10 emission eg Riechers et al 2010a
1The Expanded Very Large Array was recently re-named to the Jansky VLA
GaseousEvolutionofMassiveGalaxiesatHighRedshift
2011c 2011d 2011e Ivison et al 2011
In contrast to previous studies at shorter
wavelengths in higher rotational lines of CO observations of CO J10 trace the full
amount and extent of the molecular gas and can be more directly compared to obser-
vations in the nearby universe which are most commonly undertaken in CO J10
One particular aspect of these studies is that they provide deeper insight into the
mechanisms that are driving the conversion of gas into stellar mass in the most intensely
star-forming galaxies at early cosmic times such as SMGs It has been argued in the
past that most SMGs are major mergers of two gas-rich galaxies eg Tacconi et al
2008 Engel et al 2010 Detailed studies of COJ10 emission with the EVLA
conrm this picture and show a range in merger properties and stages eg Riechers et
al 2011c 2011d Fig 4 Indeed it becomes possible to place SMGs along a merger
sequence of high redshift galaxies ranging from systems with two disk-like gas-rich
galaxies that are separated by tens of kiloparsec in projection and several hundreds
km s1 in velocity over actively merging systems with a single morphologically and
dynamically complex gas distribution to systems that have almost reached coalescence
These early investigations demonstrate that studies of larger samples at higher spatial
resolution with the fully upgraded EVLA in the future will allow us to distinguish be-
tween dierent galaxy populations based on the physical properties of their interstellar
media This will yield a more complete understanding of the processes that trigger star
formation and black hole activity in the early universe and their relative importance for
the buildup of stellar mass in galaxies as seen at present day

SMGs show complex gas morphologies that can extend over 10 kpc scales and
commonly consist of multiple components The gas distribution and kinematics of
the majority of SMGs are as expected for major gas-rich mergers The observed
diversity in these properties is consistent with dierent merger stages as shown here
for three examples Left The two gas-rich galaxies in this SMG are separated by
tens of kpc and 700 km s1 representing an early merger stage Middle This SMG
still shows two separated components but at similar velocity representing a more
advanced merger stage Right This SMG shows a single complex extended gas
structure with multiple velocity components representing a fairly late merger stage
5 Cosmic Environments of Massive Starbursts at Very High Redshift
Recent studies have led to the discovery of the long sought-after high-redshift tail of
SMGs at z4 eg Capak et al 2008 Daddi et al 2009 SMGs at the highest redshifts
DominikARiechers
are of particular interest as they trace some of the most massive and active systems at
early cosmic times In cosmological simulations such systems are expected to grow
in the rare most overdense regions in the early universe eg Springel et al 2005
Thus very high-z SMGs may trace the most distant proto-cluster regions in the uni-
verse which have the potential to grow into the most massive cosmic structures seen
at present day Indeed following the discovery of a SMG at an unprecedented redshift
of z5298 observational evidence has recently been found for this mode of structure
formation in the early universe Capak et al 2011 Riechers et al 2010c Fig 5 Deep
imaging and spectroscopy of its cosmic environment as part of the Cosmic Evolution
Survey COSMOS reveals a high overdensity of Lyman-break galaxies at similar red-
shifts within a co-moving volume of 2 Mpc radius around the SMG The structure of
the central proto-cluster encompasses a halo mass of 41011 M which would be
consistent with what is expected for the early formation of a present-day galaxy cluster
Clearly future discovery and studies of SMGs at comparable and higher redshifts are
desirable to determine the fraction of the rst massive starbursts that are associated with
such galaxy overdensities as necessary to study the eects of environment on galaxy
formation within a more general cosmological context

overdensity in the early universe showing that the highest-redshift SMGs may be an
ideal tracer of the most massive cosmic structures at early cosmic times
6 Herschel The Lensing Revolution
One of the most intriguing recent discoveries made by the Herschel Space Observatory
is the identication of a rare population of extremely luminous high-redshift starburst
galaxies at submillimeter wavelengths S 500m100 mJy eg Negrello et al 2010
This population far exceeds the expected number counts of SMGs at the bright end and
is dominated by gravitationally lensed SMGs This discovery is interesting because it
allows for a very ecient selection of gravitational lenses based on a ux density mea-
surement alone after rejection of low-redshift contaminants Also the natural mag-
nication in size and ux density provided by gravitational lensing have enabled new
GaseousEvolutionofMassiveGalaxiesatHighRedshift
techniques to better understand the SMG population itself First the high expected CO
emission line uxes paired with recent spectral bandwidth upgrades of radiomillimeter
observatories have yielded a signicant number of blind CO detections in these and
similar sources without any prior constraints on their redshifts eg Riechers 2011b
Frayer et al 2011 Cox et al 2011 Harris et al 2012 Lupu et al 2012 Second high-
resolution CO imaging studies in combination with detailed lens modeling allow us to
probe down to structure sizes that would remain inaccessible with current-generation
instruments without the aid of gravitational lensing eg Fig 6 Riechers et al 2011a
Swinbank et al 2011 see also Riechers et al 2008a Only ALMA will match the
sensitivity and resolution of these studies in unlensed galaxies and will even allow us
to probe down to individual molecular cloud scales in lensed systems

the bright end of a new population of lensed SMGs discovered with Herschel
7 Summary and Outlook
Studies of the molecular interstellar medium in galaxies at cosmological distances have
shown great progress in the past few years These advances were possible due to a
combination of improved selection techniques to identify gas-rich galaxies in the early
universe and major improvements in instrumentation which have enabled studies of
less extreme galaxy populations than previously possible and have liberated high red-
shift molecular line studies from the prerequisite of a precise spectroscopic redshift ob-
tained through other measures which were a major selection bias in the past The most
recent studies thus nally probe beyond the tip of the iceberg of the most far-infrared-
luminous galaxies with optical spectroscopic redshifts that were the focus of molecular
line studies at high z in the past These observations also oer a sneak peek into the
detailed investigations of the physical properties of galaxies at early cosmic times that
will become possible with ALMA once it commences full science operations
