Abstract The Gemini Deep Deep Survey GDDS produced several signicant results relating to
the evolution of galaxies All of these results are consistent with the downsizing concept of galaxy
formation and evolution ie that the active periods of star formation moved progressively from very
massive galaxies at high redshift to much lower mass galaxies at the present epoch Spectra of massive red
galaxies at z  17 demonstrates that they contain old stellar populations and hence must have formed
their stars in the rst  3Gyr of cosmic history indicators of star formation activity show that the star
formation rate in the most massive galaxies was much higher at z  2 than today that the activity in
intermediate mass galaxies peaked near z  15 while since z  1 the activity is primarily conned to
lower mass galaxies The GDDS also uncovered a relatively high percentage of post-starburst galaxies
at z  1 a result that is anticipated given all the activity seen at higher redshifts Measurements of the
strengths of metal lines of a subsample of the GDDS and CFRS galaxies at z  07 reveal that at a
given mass they had lower metallicities than at present The evolution in the mass-metallicity relation is
consistent with a model in which star formation lasts longest in less massive galaxies again an expected
result in the downsizing scenario
Introduction
The formation and evolution of galaxies has been one of the primary topics in cosmology ever since their diverse
appearance was rst observed Naive interpretations of the Hubble sequence of galaxies and of the hierarchical
nature of dark matter halos in CDM models naturally lead to scenarios in which smaller galaxies predominantly
spirals form rst and then merge to form the massive spheroidal systems The variation of the star formation
rate density as a function of redshift Lilly et al 1996 Madau et al1996 shows that almost half of the stellar
mass in galaxies was formed between 1  z  2 so that it is obviously vital to study this epoch to understand
galaxy evolution The GDDS survey Abraham et al 2004 through preselection criteria applied to a deep
infrared survey of galaxies was specically designed for this purpose
The photometric and spectroscopic results that emerged from the GDDS galaxy sample reveal a very con-
sistent picture one in which star formation activity was initially concentrated in very massive galaxies at very
high redshift resulting in old red and dead galaxies at redshifts z  2 and the activity has progressively
moved to lower and lower mass systems Here we summarize some of the highlights that lead to this conclusion
2 Parameters of the GDDS Survey
The chief observational hurdle to overcome was a the extreme faintness of the passively evolving galaxy
population b the relatively featureless spectra since all strong features were redshifted out of the detector
passband c the very bright night sky emission Before techniques like Nod and Shue see below were
implemented it was extremely dicult to obtain suciently good spectra for redshift determination in the
range 14  z  2 and so this became known as the redshift desert Given the observational challenges
transforming the redshift desert into the redshift dessert requires extremely long exposures
The basic goals and parameters of the GDDS survey can be summarized as follows
- Construct the largest mass-limited sample of galaxies in the 1  z  2 range with no bias toward emission
line systems In fact bias the sample toward early-type red and dead galaxies using VRIzJHK colours The
sample was drawn from the Las Campanas IR imaging survey McCarthy et al 1999 Chen et al 2002 and
the GDDS subsample covered 121 square arcminutes in 4 dierent sightlines
- Go deep enough KV ega  206 to pick up M galaxies out to z18 This requires up to 30 hour
integrations with GMOS the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph Hook et al 2003 Crampton  Murowinski
2004 and implementation of a Nod  Shue mode Cuillandre 1994 Glazebrook  Bland-Hawthorn 2001
and the appendix to Abraham et al 2004 to enable sky subtraction to 01 accuracy The resulting relatively
high signal-to-noise spectra that were free of artifacts resulting from poor subtraction of the strong night sky
emission lines enabled redshift determination for a high perecentage of the original galaxy sample even from
spectra of galaxies containing primarily old stars with no or weak emission features Spectroscopic redshifts
were derived for 221 galaxies 163 of which are in the redshift interval 08  z  2
- Construct the mass function of galaxies and connect this to the star-formation history of the Universe
ideally using only self-consistent data internal to the survey Connect mass-assembly to the Hubble sequence
The GDDS catalogue and the spectra are described in detail in Abraham et al 2004 and are all publicly
available at httpwwwociwedulcirsgddshtml Abraham et al also describe the sampling strategy and how
a weighting scheme was devised to deal with the complications arising from the preselection criteria
3 Masses and Spectra of Galaxies in the Redshift Desert
As outlined in Glazebrook et al 2004 masses for galaxies in the GDDS sample were derived from their spectral
energy distributions which in turn were determined from V IzK colours As gures 1 and 3 of Glazebrook et
al show high mass galaxies were abundant up to redshifts z  2 and the decline in mass density falls much
more slowly with redshift than predicted by standard semi-analytic models eg Cole et al 2000 Almost
half of the mass density at 13  z  2 is contained within galaxies with I  K  4 and the spectra show that
these are galaxies containing populations of old stars rather than being reddened by interstellar absorption
Furthermore HST ACS imaging of a representative subsample of these galaxies shows that more than 90
have early-type morphology Abraham et al 2005 A representative spectrum and direct image of one of these
galaxies is shown in the middle panel of Figure 1 The most massive galaxies are generally spectroscopically
and morphologically early type systems However there are also lots of massive star-forming galaxies at z  14
that presumably become all the post-starburst galaxies that are observed at z  1 see below
31 Formation redshifts and ages of galaxies with very evolved stellar populations
A preliminary analysis by McCarthy et al 2004 of the spectra of galaxies at redshifts from 13 to 22 whose
integrated light is dominated by evolved stars shows that they must have formed at very high redshifts Con-
servative best-t and minimum ages were derived from both the spectra and the broad band colors Minimum
formation redshifts  35 are inferred for several of the galaxies and best-t formation redshifts z  5 for 20
of the objects These early-forming galaxies are major contributors to the stellar mass density at 1  z  2
and are likely progenitors of a signicant fraction of present day massive elliptical galaxies McCarthy et al
argue that the mostly likely progenitors of these systems are higher redshift analogs of the massive starburst
galaxies seen in the sub-mm with SCUBA and similar instruments and cannot be descendants of the z  3
Lyman break galaxies
Another interesting point is that the spectra are best t by models with solar or even higher metallicity
indicating that very signicant metal enrichment occurred very early The interstellar medium of star-forming
galaxies in this same redshift range is also apparently chemically evolved A composite spectrum derived from
a subsample of 13 GDDS galaxies at 13  z  2 by Savaglio et al 2004 shows surprisingly strong interstellar
lines much stronger than observed in local starbursts Tremonti 2003 An example of the spectra of one of
these active starburst galaxies at z  15 is shown in the top panel of Figure 1 Thus both the interstellar
medium and the stars in these relatively high redshift galaxies have already been enriched to approximately
solar values Rapid enrichment in these massive galaxies must occur very early in the history of the Universe
32 Post-Starburst Activity at z  1
Prominent among the GDDS spectra are several dramatic examples of post-starburst galaxies ie spectra with
very strong Balmer absorption lines but weak or absent emission features see the bottom panel of Figure 1
By comparing the GDDS data with that from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Le Borgne et al 2005 were able to
quantify the dramatic decline in the abundance of post-starburst galaxies from z  12 to the present Spectral
synthesis models of the GDDS post-starburst galaxies show that they must be the products of massive bursts
of star formation 1  2 Gyr prior to the epoch of observation The models show that these must have been
rapid mass-building events rather than a continual series of small events The bright star-forming galaxies in
the GDDS sample at z  15 are probably examples of this activity The most likely local counterparts of these
post-starburst galaxies at z  1 are massive ellipticals in the eld or in small groups
33 Star Formation Rates at 08  z  2
Another ubiquitous feature of the GDDS spectra is the presence of relatively strong emission lines much stronger
than in lower redshift samples eg CFRS OII emission lines indicative of star formation activity are of
course strong in the galaxies with late-type morphologies but in the GDDS sample they are also frequently
visible even in spectra that appear to arise mostly from evolved populations In addition higher ionization
emission lines eg Ne III Ne V are evident in several of the most active galaxies for details see Abraham
et al 2004 Juneau et al 2005 measured the strengths of the OII emission lines in all the GDDS spectra
Figure 1 GMOS spectra and HST ACS images representative of the GDDS sample Upper panel A spectrum
of a strongly star-forming galaxy with late-type morphology The at spectrum in the rest-frame UV is a
signature of active star formation while the strength of the interstellar absorption features reveals that the
metallicity must already be high in this galaxy at z  16 Middle panel A spectrum of an old red and dead
galaxy at z  15 with corresponding early-type morphology Bottom panel A spectrum and an image of a
post-starburst galaxy at z  1 Note the very strong Balmer series
Figure 2 Left The star formation rate density SFRD as a function of redshift At the bottom of the panel
the points show that the SFRD for GDDS high mass galaxies peaks at redshifts near z  2 and declines to
present day values by z  1 The SFRD for lower mass galaxies peaks at progressively lower redshifts Right
The characteristic timescale of the growth of stellar mass in galaxies as a function of redshift By comparing
the time required for the galaxies to assemble their mass at the observed star formation rate with the age of the
universe gray curve it is obvious that the stellar mass in high mass galaxies built up rapidly before z  18
and then these galaxies transitioned to a quiescent mode Lower mass galaxies do this at lower redshift See
Juneau et al 2005 for details
of galaxies with 05  z  16 and used these along with measurements of the rest-frame UV continuum
derived from photometry for galaxies with 12  z  2 to derive star formation rates for the GDDS sample
As expected given the appearance of the spectra the rates are much higher on average than at z  0 The
availability of the mass estimates for the GDDS galaxies allowed Juneau et al
to add another dimension
however Figure 2 adapted from Juneau et al demonstrates that the star formation rate history is a strong
function of the stellar mass in a galaxy For the most massive galaxies the star formation rate was six times
higher at z  2 than at z  0 and it declined rapidly between 1  z  2 The star formation activity in the
lower mass galaxies peaked at lower redshifts so that for systems with 90  logMMsun  102 the star
formation activity peaks closer to z  1 and then declines rapidly to z  0 Through a comparison of the star
formation rate density to the stellar mass density Juneau et al were able to demonstrate that star formation
in the most massive galaxies transitioned from a very active burst mode to a quiescent mode near z  18
whereas this transition occured later at lower redshifts for less massive galaxies Thus measurements of the
star formation rate point to the same picture as was derived from analysis of the ages of the populations from
their spectra the most massive galaxies formed early In fact the most massive galaxies formed their stars in
the rst 3 Gyr of cosmic history
All of the key results from the GDDS spectra and colours that are described in this section strongly support
the downsizing concept for galaxy evolution rapid star formation occurred very early at high redshift in the
most massive systems and then subsided in these while the activity proceeded to lower and lower mass systems
with decreasing redshift
4 Redshift Evolution of the Galaxy Mass-Metallicity Relationship
Savaglio et al 2005 were able to measure metallicities for 56 galaxies with 04  z  10 for which masses could
also be estimated from the GDDS and CFRS surveys Careful attention was paid to minimizing systematic
and possible aperture eects as well as the eects of extinction A nice mass-metallicity relationship emerged
for these galaxies at a mean redshift z  07 a relationship that is considerably tighter than the luminosity-
metallicity relationship Furthermore the relation is displaced from that derived from the SDSS galaxies at
z  01 Tremonti et al 2004 in the expected direction present-day galaxies of a given mass have a higher
metallicity Evidence from z  23 galaxies compiled by Shapley et al 2004 indicates that this trend continues
to higher redshifts Savaglio et al show that all these observations can be tted by a simple redshift-dependent
mass-metallicity relationship Both masses and metallicities evolve more slowly in lower mass galaxies compared
to their higher mass counterparts The variation can be explained by a simple closed-box model in which
the e-folding time for star formation is longer for less massive galaxies Thus the picture that emerges from
considerations of the mass-metallicity relation also supports the downsizing scenario An aside is that the
mass-metallicity relationship predicts that low metallicity galaxies such as the DLA systems all have masses
M  1088Msun Hammer elsewhere in these proceedings and see Liang et al 2005 also reported detecting
redshift evolution in the mass-metallicity relationship of galaxies at similar redshifts to those discussed by
Savaglio et al
5 Summary
The GDDS survey targeted 1  z  2 galaxies emphasizing those red and dead systems containing old
evolved stellar populations As expected the results demonstrate that UV-selected surveys are not complete and
miss important segments of the galaxy population The GDDS spectra have sucient signal-to-noise for these
optically extremely faint galaxies that it is possible to distinguish the evolved populations from galaxies that
are red because they are dusty In addition HST ACS imaging conrms that almost all the spectroscopically
red and dead systems have morphologies characteristic of early-type galaxies
The abundance of massive galaxies declines at z  1 but the decline is slower than that predicted by
most models and there is still a signicant population of very high mass galaxies at z  2 The GDDS
observations indicate that half the stellar mass in these galaxies was formed in very active bursts of star
formation at 2  z  5 High redshift sub-mm SCUBA sources Chapman et al 2005 are the most
plausible counterparts of these active systems At much lower redshifts z  1 there is a signicant population
of post-starburst galaxies that appear to be the descendants of the active star-forming galaxies at 14  z  2
Measures of star formation activity in GDDS galaxies at various redshifts as a function of the stellar mass
complement these other results demonstrating that the peak of the star formation activity began in the highest
mass galaxies at high redshifts and then progressively moved to lower mass galaxies at lower redshifts This
scenario called downsizing by Cowie et al 1994 is thus supported by several results emerging from the
GDDS survey The redshift-evolution of a mass-metallicity relation that was detected in the GDDS and CFRS
galaxies is also consistent with downsizing in that star formation appears to proceed more slowly for a longer
period of time in less massive galaxies Interestingly a naive closed-box model in which the e-folding time for
star formation is longer in less massive galaxies ts the observations quite well Savaglio et al 2005
In summary observations of galaxies in the redshift desert give strong support for the downsizing scenario of
galaxy evolution Physical processes must make the formation of stars much more ecient in high mass systems
at earlier times than suggested by most theoretical models and then turn it o quickly
