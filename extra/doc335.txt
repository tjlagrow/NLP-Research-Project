Abstract We have extended our chemical and cosmo-
logical galaxy evolution model to calculate the abundance
evolution for altogether 16 dierent elements in spiral
galaxies in a chemically consistent way which is a con-
siderable step towards a more realistic galaxy modeling
All observed element abundances in DLA systems have
been compiled The comparison with our model calcula-
tions yields the following results
Together with the fact that our models well repro-
duce observed average HII region abundances in all spi-
ral types the conformity between observed and calculated
abundances over the redshift range from z  45 through
z  04 indicates that DLA galaxies may well evolve
into the full range of presentday spiral galaxies from Sa
through Sd
Comparison of our chemically consistent models with
models using only solar metallicity input physics shows
that dierences in the redshift evolution are small for
some elements but large for others For those elements
with large dierences the chemically consistent models
provide signicant better agreement with observed DLA
abundances
For typical spiral galaxies the star formation histories
of our models clearly bridge the gap between high red-
shift DLA systems and the nearby spiral galaxy popula-
tion The slow redshift evolution of DLA abundances is
understood in terms of the long star formation timescales
in galactic and proto-galactic disks The large scatter of
observed abundances in DLAs of similar redshift is rather
explained by the range of SFRs among early and late type
spirals
Towards lower redshift z  15 our models indicate
that early type spirals drop out of the DLA samples as
their gas content falls below  50  Implications for op-
tical identication are discussed

1 Introduction
Abundances of various heavy elements in Damped Ly
DLA absorbers are being determined since many years
now rst mainly in the redshift range z  2    3 where
the DLA lines are accessible from the ground Abundances
have been determined from curve of growth analysis eg of
the low ionisation lines of ZnII CrII FeII SiII and many
others which are found associated with the DLA line The
HST key project Quasar Absorption Lines Bahcall et al
1996 1993 extended the possible range of DLA detections
towards lower redshifts In particular three observational
facts still keep challenging our understanding of the nature
of DLA systems
 The number of low redshift DLA systems detected is
much smaller than expected
 The redshift evolution of heavy element abundances in
DLA systems is very weak in particular if compared
to the strong redshift evolution of the narrow high ion-
isation CIV QSO absorption systems
 The scatter of abundances observed among various
DLA systems at any given redshift is very large
In 1995 we presented a rst comparison of our chem-
ical and cosmological galaxy evolution models for spiral
galaxies of various types with DLA abundances Fritze
- v Alvensleben  Fricke 1995b see also Fritze - v Al-
vensleben 1995a At that time however observational
abundance determinations were not very precise yet giv-
ing lower and upper limits only in many cases and we felt
somewhat uncomfortable using stellar yields calculated for
solar metallicity stars to compare with high redshift DLAs
which typically have low metallicities

Meanwhile the situation has improved considerably
KECK HIRES HST GHRS and WHT spectra give com-
pletely resolved absorption line proles for a large number
U Lindner et al Chemically consistent evolution of DLA galaxies
of lines in many DLAs In these cases the apparent opti-
cal depth method which does not require any assumption
about the functional form of the velocity distribution in
the absorbing gas allows for precise abundance determi-
nations eg Pettini et al 1994 Prochaska  Wolfe 1996
Lu et al 1996 This method works well even for kinemat-
ically complex multi-component proles It also allows to
correct for saturated lines in which case still however
only lower limits for the respective element abundances
can be obtained
On the theoretical side stellar yields for a set of dier-
ent metallicities from Z  0 to Z have become available
Woosley  Weaver 1995 van den Hoek  Groenewegen
1997 Marigo et al 1998 Portinari et al 1998 which we
now use in our modeling We have developed a method to
model the chemical evolution of ISM abundances in galax-
ies in a chemically consistent way very much in parallel
to the chemically consistent treatment of the photomet-
ric Einsel et al 1995 Fritze - v Alvensleben et al 1996
Moller et al 1997 and spectral Moller et al 1998 evolu-
tion For a galaxy which always is a composite system in
terms of stellar metallicities and ages we follow the chemi-
cal evolution of successive generations of stars using yields
and stellar lifetimes appropriate for their respective initial
metallicities
We use a set of star formation histories SFHs ap-
propriate for spiral galaxies of various types that provide
a successful description not only of the detailed spectral
properties of the respective nearby template galaxies in
the optical their average colors from U through K their
emission line properties but also of their redshift evolution
back to z  1 as far as accessible via type-dependent red-
shift surveys cf Moller et al 1996 and 1998 We show
that with these SFHs the chemically consistent chemical
and cosmological evolution models give good agreement of
the model abundances at z  0 with observed HII region
abundances of nearby galaxies We thus expect our mod-
els to also be able to describe the redshift evolution of the
ISM abundances in spiral or proto-spiral galaxies and thus
to provide a tool to bridge the gap between DLA absorbers
at high redshift and the local galaxy population
We present our models their basic parameters and
the input physics we use in section 2 All available DLA
abundance data are compiled and described in section 3
where we also discuss their various degrees of reliability
In section 4 we present a detailed comparison of the red-
shift evolution of various element abundances Fe Si Zn
Cr Ni S Al Mn as given by our models for various spi-
ral types with all the available data for DLAs Results
are discussed as to our understanding of the weak red-
shift evolution of observed DLA abundances the scatter
they show at any given redshift the question as to the
nature of the absorber galaxyprotogalaxy population as
well as to the importance of the chemically consistent ap-
proach In section 5 we use the comparison between mod-
els and observations to discuss the properties of the DLA
absorbing galaxy population and their redshift evolution
derive some implications and present predictions for op-
tical identications of DLA galaxies We summarize our
main results in section 6
2 Chemically consistent galaxy evolution models
Our galaxy evolution model has been described in de-
tail earlier by Fritze  von Alvensleben 1989 Kruger et
al 1991 Fritze  von Alvensleben  Gerhard 1994 and
Lindner et al 1996 In the following brief outline we con-
centrate on the chemical evolution especially on our new
concept of chemical consistency which is a considerable
step towards a more realistic galaxy modeling Chemically
consistent models account for the increasing initial stellar
metallicities of successive generations of stars and use sev-
eral sets of stellar evolutionary tracks stellar lifetimes and
yields color calibrations and spectra appropriate for the
dierent metallicity subpopulations present in any type of
galaxy While single burst stellar populations like star
clusters are well described by one common age and
metallicity for all stars the stars in any system with an
extended or more complex star formation history SFH
have a dispersion not only in age but also in initial metal-
licity
Our chemically consistent models describe the rst
stars forming in a proto galaxy using the lowest metal-
licity stellar tracks lifetimes yields etc and consistently
use input data bases for higher metallicity as the ISM
abundance increases Our models however do not include
any dynamical aspects we have to assume that the gas is
always well mixed cf section 22
Chemically consistent models can now be developed
because suciently complete and homogeneous sets of
physical input data are becoming available for a range
of metallicities
including metallicity dependent stellar
yields With our new model approach and extensive in-
put data bases we calculate in detail the time and redshift
evolution of abundances for a large number of dierent
elements including SNI contributions from carbon dea-
gration white dwarf binaries
Chemically consistent models similar in principle to
the ones presented here were used by Timmes et al 1995
using the same Woosley  Weaver 1995 yields for mas-
sive stars but older yields Renzini  Voli 1981 for stars
with m  8 M Recent chemically consistent models by
Portinari et al 1998 use the Padova set of stellar input
physics Both approaches aim at describing the Galactic
enrichment history by comparing to observed stellar abun-
dance patterns

model ML values after a Hubble time into good agree-
ment with observed ML values for the respective galaxy
types The inuence on our results from the use of this
Scalo IMF as compared to a single Salpeter slope x  135
is discussed in Section 235
For galaxies of various spectral types we use dier-
ent parametrisations of their star formation rates SFR
following Sandages 1986 semi-empirical determinations
SFRs t in spiral galaxies are assumed to be linear func-
tions of the gas content gt  GtMtot 109 M with
characteristic time scales t ranging from about 2 to 10
Gyr for Sa Sb and Sc respectively and a constant rate

Since dynamical eects are not included in our mod-
els we cannot account for the internal structure or gradi-
ents in spiral galaxies or DLA absorbers Our closed box
models do not allow for galactic winds which clearly are
important for dwarf galaxies but presumably not for spi-
ral galaxies or their massive DLA progenitors cf A Wolfe
1995 Wolfe  Prochaska 1997 and references therein
For these SFRs our chemically consistent spectropho-
tometric models cf Moller et al 1996 Fritze  v Al-
vensleben et al 1996 give detailed agreement not only
with average broad band colors observed for the respec-
tive galaxy types from U through K but also with detailed
emission and absorption features of the template spectra
from Kennicutts 1992 atlas They also give agreement
with the observed redshift evolution of galaxy colors for
the respective types at least up to z  1 ie over roughly
a third of the Hubble time and with observations of opti-
cally identied QSO absorbers Lindner et al 1996
Although our simple 1-zone models are not able to ac-
count for any abundance gradients along proto-galactic
disks the range of observed average HII region abun-
dances 023  OH  017 for nearby spiral types Sa
through Sd as given by Zaritsky et al 1994 and Oey 
Kennicutt 1993 is well covered by our Sa through Sd
models at z  0 cf Fig 6 in section 235 Of particular
interest for the comparison with DLA abundances which
 most probably  probe the outer regions of the absorb-
ing galaxies are the HII region abundances measured by
Ferguson et al 1998 For three late type spirals with
large HI-to-optical sizes they nd OH  10  15 solar
at 15  2 optical radii For their galaxies this corresponds
to o-center distances between 12 and 42 kpc where the HI
column density still is several 1020 cm2 Impact param-
eter found for optically identied DLA absorber galaxies
typically are in the range 10  20 kpc
22 Input physics
Besides the two basic parameters of our models IMF and
SFR stellar yields pim for elements i stellar rem-
nant masses mrem and stellar lifetimes mm are re-
quired as input physics for our models These data are
needed to calculate the total mass Et ejected by stars

tion of the gas mass in our closed box models

Our models only aim at describing average gas phase
abundances without accounting for the multiphase nature
of the ISM they assume perfect and instantaneous mixing
of the material rejected by the stars For a simple 1-zone
model the abundance Xi for each element i is calculated
from equation 3c

We follow the formalism outlined by Matteucci 
Greggio 1986 and Matteucci  Tornambe 1987 to split
up the IMF in the mass range between 3 and 16 M into
some fraction A of binary stars that give rise to SNIa in

a fraction 1  A of single stars The term

and all the material is assumed to ow onto the primary

gives rise to a carbon deagration SNIa event The pa-

contributes to SNIa at time t f  2 is an assumed
distribution function for binary relative masses As pro-
posed by Matteucci  Greggio the parameter A is xed
by the requirement that for a Milky Way model Sbc the
resulting SNIa rate at  12 Gyr is equal to the observed
one Cappellaro et al 1997 This gives us A  01 which
we use for all galaxy types The enrichment contribution

221 Cosmological model
To compare the results from our galaxy evolution calcu-
lations with the observed element abundances in DLA
systems redshift dependent values are needed To con-
vert any evolution in time to a redshift evolution we
adopt a FriedmannLematre model with vanishing cos-
mological constant 0  0 and cosmological parameters
H0  50 km s1 Mpc1 and 0  1 As redshift of galaxy
formation we chose zform  5 These parameters are in con-
formity with our spectrophotometric models cf Moller et
al 1996 Fritze  v Alvensleben et al 1996 and are used
throughout the paper The relation between redshift and
time is then calculated directly obtained via equation 4

222 Supernova yields
Supernova explosions of type II SN II ie stars heavier
than about ten solar masses are the most productive sup-
pliers of heavy elements to the interstellar medium ISM
SN type I explosions also supply a considerable contribu-
tion to the ISM metallicity see Nomoto et al 1997 in
case of some elements ie Fe Ni Cr and Mn cf last row
of Table 5 whereas single stars of intermediate and small
mass m  10 M supply considerable contributions only
to the abundances of elements C N and O cf Table 6
Woosley  Weaver 1995 have calculated nucleosyn-
thetic yields of about 144 isotopes from altogether 32 ele-
ments H He Li Be B C N O F Ne Na Mg Al Si
P S Cl Ar K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn

with 12 13 15 18 20 22 25 30 35 and 40 solar masses
They considered ve dierent initial metallicities Z  Z
Z  01 Z Z  001 Z Z  104 Z and Z  0 and
three models with dierent explosion energies labeled A
B and C for very massive stars For our models we use
their SNII yields for 16 of the most abundant elements H
He C N O Mg Al Si S Ar Ca Cr Mn Fe Ni and
Zn Ejecta given in solar mass units M are listed in
Table 5 for all ve initial metallicities summed over all
isotopes for each element In the last column of this table
we see that dierences  between the total ejection of all
elements Etot and the sum of ejecta from our 16 selected
elements is negligible between 03  and 41 
Ejected masses of all isotopes of one element are added
because we are only interested in total element abun-
dances Woosley  Weaver 1995 did not take into consid-
eration any radioactive decay of isotopes after their pro-
U Lindner et al Chemically consistent evolution of DLA galaxies
duction in the SN II explosion In Table 1 we list those ra-
dioactive decays of isotopes which considerably contribute
to the abundances of Fe Cr and Mn All contributions of
other isotopes are negligible for our purpose
Table 1 Radioactive decays relevant for our yields
56Ni  56Fe
52Fe  52Cr
53Fe  53Cr
53Mn  53Cr
55Co  55Mn
55Fe  55Mn
Rows containing results from model B and C are
marked with  and  attached to the stellar mass in the
rst column of Table 5 We see that for larger explosion en-
ergy the ejected mass of heavy elements increases 0000
in Table 5 indicate that respective values are smaller than
10  104
For an overview of the inuence of dierent initial
metallicity we list in Table 5 as an example the SN II yields
for a typical ie 25 M star model A Ejecta for Z
 0 are clearly smaller than for other metallicities On the
whole Z0 yields dier drastically from those for Z  0
but these exceptional data do not aect our results be-
cause after the rst few timesteps our program switches
to higher metallicity input data However yields for other
metallicities likewise do not show any general trend nei-
ther with respect to initial stellar mass for xed metallicity
nor with respect to initial metallicity for xed stellar mass
and this applies to all elements considered In case of iron
and carbon this is illustrated in Fig 1 and Fig 2
In Fig 1 we present stellar iron yields for the ve
initial metallicities calculated by Woosley  Weaver 1995
Yields are given as a fraction of the total stellar mass
mstar and stellar masses are given in solar units Msun
Lines do split at m  30 and 35M indicating dierent
explosion models In case of solar metallicity Z  Z
the separate lines for model A B and C are indicated for
stellar mass larger than 25 M We see that generally more
mass is ejected for larger explosion energies However no
distinct trend neither with increasing stellar mass nor with
increasing metallicity can be found
We use element yields from SNIa calculated from
Nomotos deagration model W7 Nomoto et al 1997
which are presented in the last row of Table 5 These
SNIa yields are available for solar metallicity only How-
ever no important metallicity dependence is expected for
SNIa yields

data are listed in Table 6 for stellar masses ranging from
09 M to 8 M Negative values indicate consumption
instead of ejection of mass and 0000 indicate values
smaller than 10  103 Yields of the same element but for
dierent metallicities are arranged in neighboring columns
of the table to make comparison easy In case of elements
C N and O dierences are quite signicant but no trend
can be found
In Fig 2 we present stellar carbon yields in units of
stellar mass mstar for ve initial metallicities calculated
by Woosley  Weaver 1995 For stellar masses less than
8 M the plot contains the results calculated by van den
Hoek  Groenewegen 1997 Their initial metallicities
dier from those used by Woosley  Weaver and we com-
bine those metallicities which are next to each other as
listed in Table 2

223 Yields from intermediate and low mass stars
Intermediate mass stars 09 M  m  8 M contribute
little to the total metal enrichment of the ISM they are
however important for elements C N and O Stars of
mass less than 09 M do not contribute any metals to
the ISM We use up-to-date stellar yields for three dierent
initial metallicities Z  Z Z  02 Z and Z  005 Z
As for iron in Fig 1 carbon lines do split at m 
25 and 30 M indicating dierent explosion models and
clearly more carbon is ejected for larger explosion energy
Likewise no distinct trend with increasing stellar mass or
increasing metallicity is visible These ndings are typical
not only in case of iron and carbon but for almost all
elements under investigation

224 Stellar remnants and lifetimes
Neither Woosley  Weaver 1995 nor van den Hoek 
Groenewegen 1997 report any stellar lifetimes mm
Hence we adopt them from the stellar evolutionary tracks
calculated by the Geneva group who gives lifetimes for
two dierent initial metallicities Z  Z and Z  005 Z
listed in Table 7 For stellar masses less than 09 M
there is no dierence for lifetimes between the dierent
metallicities and lifetimes are equal to or larger than the
Hubble time anyway Hence only data for m  09 M
are of interest To coordinate with yields for dierent ini-
tial metallicities we use 1 in case of Z  Z and 2 for all
other metallicities
Masses of stellar remnants have been calculated by
Woosley  Weaver 1995 for massive stars and by van
den Hoek  Groenewegen 1997 for intermediate mass
stars Their results are reported in Table 8 and Table 
respectively
23 Discussion of models
Now the inuence of dierent initial metallicities and ex-
plosion energies described in the previous section 22 on
the results of our chemical evolution models will briey be
discussed
231 Chemically consistent models
During the evolution of any galaxy the ISM is continu-
ously enriched with metals Hence it is reasonable to as-
sume that stars which are formed in early phases are very
U Lindner et al Chemically consistent evolution of DLA galaxies
poor in metals and consequently we need to use input
data yields remnants and lifetimes of very low metal-
licity in the beginning of the galaxy evolution With in-
creasing time the metal content of the ISM is growing and
after each time step the actual metallicity is determined
to select the appropriate input data In earlier evolution
models only solar metallicity data have been available
Chemically consistent models take into account increas-
ing metal enrichment of the ISM from which successive
generations of stars are born and hence are more realistic
than models using solar data A comparison of chemically
consistent calculations only with results from models using
solar metallicity exclusively for Sa Sb Sc and Sd galax-
ies is shown in Fig 3 We see that chemically consistent
models in general produce less metals than calculations
with solar input data because metallicity dependent stel-
lar yields are smaller than their solar counterparts In the
following we will omit curves of Sb and Sc galaxies because
they lie between those of Sa and Sd galaxies
The average ISM metallicity of our Sb model after a
Hubble time is seen to be about 23 Z in good agreement
with recent ISM abundance determinations cf Cardelli
 Meyer 1997 Soa et al 1997 and references therein
H II region abundances eg Vilchez  Esteban 1996 for
the solar neighborhood and with Bstar abundances eg
Kilian et al 1994 KilianMontenbruch et al 1994
232 The inuence of stellar yields
As discussed in section 222 Woosley  Weavers yields
show no clear trends neither with stellar mass at xed
metallicity Z nor with Z at xed stellar mass In particular
yields for Z  0 dier drastically from those with Z 6 0
We decided to use Woosley  Weavers data because
they give yields for ve dierent metallicities which is im-
portant for our concept of chemical consistent models It
should be mentioned that there are yield data from other
authors
Thielemann et al 1996 published SN II yields for so-
lar initial metallicity which to some extent dier from
those of Woosley  Weaver For a detailed investigation
of the eects of these dierences we refer the reader to
D Thomas et al 1998 Portinari et al 1998 take mass
loss by stellar winds into account and give stellar yields
for a few elements for ve initial metallicities
The impact of yield uncertainties on our results is hard
to quantify Even signicant changes for a star of given
mass and metallicity however do hardly aect the global
evolution due to the smoothing power of the IMF
From a comparison of the stellar yields given by vari-
ous authors we conclude that while yield dierences may
have strong impact on abundance ratios of certain ele-
ments  which we do not attempt to interpret  they will
not strongly aect the abundance evolution and hence our
conclusions

Yield uncertainties may slightly change our enrichment
calculations for some elements eg for Fe or for typical
wind elements C N O which however we do not discuss
since there are very few precise DLA data but certainly
not to the extent as to aect our conclusions which are
based on a series of elements for many of which stellar
yields are not controversial
cating that the enrichment history for all elements is
roughly the same But there are important dierences in
detail Absolute element abundance values are very dier-
ent bearing in mind the log scale Furthermore the gradi-
ents of the curves dier signicantly in some parts reect-
ing the dierent production histories of various elements

A comparison of results from chemically consistent evo-
lution models for Sa and Sd galaxies using dierent ex-
plosion energies for SN II yields calculated by Woosley 
Weaver 1995 is shown in Fig 4 We see that the curves
representing the time evolution of the metal content of the
ISM are roughly similar for the three SN II models named
A B and C by Woosley  Weaver but they are shifted to
larger abundance in case of larger explosion energy Curves
for model B always lie between those of model A and C
and will be omitted in the following studies
234 Evolution of selected element abundances
As another improvement of our chemical evolution mod-
els we can calculate abundances XH cf equation 5 in
section 3 of a great variety of elements because appropri-
ate input data are now available as was pointed out in
section 22 In Fig 5 we present abundances XH for
elements X  C N O Mg Al Si S Ar Ca Cr Mn Fe
Ni and Zn in Sa galaxies

237 Connection with DLA galaxies
It should be mentioned that for our 1-zone models it would
not matter if at the highest redshifts the proto galaxies
were not really assembled yet in one coherent structure
but rather consisted of a set of subgalactic fragments that
imprint their relative velocity dierences on the structure
of the DLA line prole In this case our model could be
interpreted as describing the global SF and enrichment
history of all the bits and pieces that are bound to later
assemble into one presentday galaxy
3 Observed abundances in DLA systems
We have compiled from the literature all available data
on element abundances in DLA systems for comparison
with results from our chemically consistent galaxy evolu-
tion models Publications on abundance observations in
DLA systems span more than one decade in time and the
data experienced considerable improvement in quality and
quantity in recent years The total resulting compilation
of element abundances is very inhomogeneous We conne
our comparison to abundances of Al Ni S Fe Si Mn Cr
and Zn because for those eight elements enough observa-
tions are available For all other elements included in our
models the number of published abundance measurements
in DLA systems is too small for a reasonable comparison
For our nal compilation we take the following criteria
into account
 Many DLA systems characterized by the redshift zabs
of the absorption lines and the background QSO are
reported by more than one author In these cases the
most reliable data will be used
 Dierent methods to determine column densities from
observed absorption lines are in use curve of growth
analysis prole tting methods eg VPFIT etc
apparent optical depth method Savage  Sembach
 The quality of data depends on instrumental capabil-
ities Resolution and signal to noise ratio of the spec-
trographs have been improved considerably in recent
years using 4m class telescopes and the 10m Keck Tele-
 All methods mentioned above used to derive column
densities from observed absorption lines need oscilla-
tor strength f Dierent f values are published in the
literature and have been used by dierent observers In
column reff  of Table 3 cf also footnote b we list the
references for oscillator strengths used for the DLA ob-
servations In our nal compilation we prepare a homo-
geneous database by referring all observed abundances
to the oscillator strengths given by Morton 1991 since
those are most widely used
 Dierent solar element abundances are used by dier-
ent authors to calculate abundances in the usual form

galaxies using Salpeter and Scalo IMF with upper mass
limit m up  85 and 40 solar masses respectively Metal-
licities of HII regions in nearby spiral galaxies are taken
from Zaritsky et al 1994 and Oey  Kennicutt 1993
236 Comparison with H II region abundances of nearby
spirals
Our simple onezone models are assumed to give aver-
age ISM abundances We therefore chose to compare them
to observed nearby spiral H II region abundances as mea-
sured or extrapolated from observed gradients at  Re
This is what Oey  Kennicutt 1993 call characteristic
abundances The range they give for Sa  Sb galaxies is
 09 Z  16 Z cf their Table 4 For Sbc through
Sd spiral galaxies Zaritsky et al 1994 this characteristic
abundance range extends downwards with average char-
acteristic abundances at 1 Re for Sd galaxies of about
05 Z
The compilation of Ferguson et al 1998 conrms the
radial gradients in galaxies out to large radii In some cases
they even nd stronger gradients than those derived from
the inner regions Starting from observed spiral ISM abun-
dances and abundance gradients and using a geometrical
model Phillipps  Edmunds 1996 nd that the average
abundance encountered along an arbitrary line of sight
through a present day spiral galaxy should be of the order
3 Z
It should be noted that oxygen abundances in H II re-
gions may already be locally enhanced with respect to
average ISM abundances as soon as the rst supernovae
explode among the stars that ionize the gas We therefore
decided to transform the observed H II region abundances
OH to a global metallicity Z for the comparison with
our model results in Fig 6

abundances in DLA systems for those eight elements

tions Al Ni S Fe Si Mn Cr and Zn According to the
method used for abundance determination and the esti-

we divide our sample into two classes of reliability reliable
and less reliable
In Table 3 we list 29 papers each reports at least
one abundance for any of our eight elements The quan-

with respective elements The number of reliable data for
any element is given by the second number separated by a

dances for three DLA systems one of these is reliable and
two are less reliable measurements Obviously the main
share of data comes from about ve papers published dur-
ing the past ve years their running number is printed

4 Results and discussion
41 Comparison of model calculations with DLA
observations
In Fig 7 a  h we present abundances in DLA systems
for eight elements Fe Si Zn Cr Ni S Al and Mn The
data are compiled from the 29 papers listed in Table 3
Reliable and less reliable data are marked with lled and
open circles respectively For several abundances the au-
thors report only upper or lower limits which are indicated
by open triangles pointing downwards or upwards respec-
tively Those data of course are classied as less reliable
In Fig 7a to 7d some pairs of data points repre-
senting abundances measured for the same DLA system
by two dierent authors are connected by heavy vertical
lines They show how abundance measurements by dier-
ent authors still can dier and give us a means to estimate
the observational errors In Fig 7a the DLA system at
z  07 has two reliable values diering by about 02 dex
in FeH and it lies just beneath the Sd curve The second
set of independent measurements in Fig 7a belongs to
the DLA system with zabs 215 The lower value is indi-
cated as a lower limit which is in agreement with the larger
reliable value Generally reliable measurements of dierent
authors agree to within  03 dex Errors reported by a
few authors for some mostly reliable data are indicated
as weak vertical lines in Fig 7 and likewise are about 03
The model curves in Fig 7 represent the redshift evo-
lution of Sa and Sd type galaxies as calculated from our
chemically consistent chemical evolution models heavy
lines and models using exclusively input physics of solar
abundance weak lines In the legend they are indicated
as chemcons and solar respectively Sb and Sc
galaxies are omitted to avoid overcrowding of the gures
Their curves always lie between those of Sa and Sd as
demonstrated in Fig 3 Furthermore for the chemically
consistent calculations we also present the redshift evo-
lution of element abundances using Woosley  Weavers
SN II yields from their model C which has larger explo-
sion energies cf section 22 indicated as model C in
Fig 7 Model B curves are omitted because they always
fall between our heavy lines which use yields from model
A and the curves for model C cf Fig 4 section 23
42 General implications for the models
For all eight elements under consideration almost all data
points lie between our chemically consistent model curves
for Sa and Sd galaxies We nd particularly good agree-
ment between models and observations for the elements
Zn and Ni where many observations are available and for
Al Mn and S with a smaller number of reliably obser-
vations Having in mind the fact that Sb and Sc models
lie within the region outlined by the Sa and Sd curves
cf Fig 3 in section 23 we can establish nearly per-
fect conformity between element abundances observed in
DLA systems and our model calculations for spiral galax-
ies spanning the whole redshift range from 0 to 45 And
since our models for z  0 agree well with observed average
ISM abundances of nearby spiral galaxies it is clear that
DLA galaxies may well evolve into the full range
of presentday spiral galaxies although we cannot
exclude the possibility that a few DLA systems might be
LSB galaxies or starbursting dwarfs
421 Implications for chemically consistent models
Dierences for chemical consistent vs pure solar metal-
licity models on the one hand and dierent SN II explo-
sion energies model A vs model C by Woosley  Weaver
1995 on the other hand are small compared to dierences
due to the variation of the star formation rate character-
izing our spectral galaxy types Sa    Sd Consequently
none of the models can be excluded or is clearly favored
by comparison with the DLA data They all are in con-
formity with the observations The range of  15    2
dex of element abundance in DLA systems at any
given redshift is naturally explained by the range
of star formation rates among early to late type
spirals as outlined in section 21
422 Scatter in observational data
Additionally some observational scatter is expected in
DLA element abundances The column densities observed
in DLAs could depend upon the unknown impact pa-
rameter if abundance gradients already exist in proto-
galactic disks at high redshift on inclination eects and
on local inhomogeneities along the line of sight cf the dif-
ferent abundances determined for the cold and warm disk
component of our Galaxy Savage  Sembach 1996
423 Observed abundances exceeding our Sa model
In case of Fe Si Cr Zn and S four reliable abundance
measurements clearly exceed the values calculated for our
Sa model The corresponding DLAs are listed in Table 4
and the elements with abundance in excess of our Sa model
prediction are marked with X O indicates conformity
of observations with models and for  no observations

It is seen that in two of the four cases QSO 02160803
and 0528-2505 only the typical SNII elements Si and
S show abundances higher than those of our Sa model
whereas the iron group elements Fe Zn and Cr which have
important SNI contributions are not enhanced For these

with important SNI contributions like Fe have abundances
higher than those of our Sa model For these we conclude
that the enhancement probably is not due to a temporarily
enhanced SFR or star burst but rather to a characteristic
timescale of star formation shorter than the t  2 Gyr
adopted for our Sa model Our models cannot tell if these
two DLA systems are the progenitors of S0 galaxies or
of a bulge component which both are believed to form
the bulk of their stars on a short timescale Alternatively
the high abundances might result from a very early star
formation enhancement a formation of these systems at
z  5 or a local overabundance where the line of sight is
passing through the disk
424 Chemically consistent versus purely solar models
In the case of Zn Ni and Al we nd a signicant dierence
between chemically consistent models and the compari-
son models using solar metallicity stellar yields only In
Fig 7c and 7e ie for Zn and Ni a considerable number
of observations lie below the Sd curve dashed line of the
solar metallicity model weak line but within the region
outlined by our chemically consistent models heavy line
In the case of Al  Fig 7g almost all data points lie be-
tween the chemically consistent evolution models heavy
line but most of the observed abundances drop below the
Sd curve of the solar metallicity model
To conclude For some elements the chemically
consistent models do not dier very much from the
solar metallicity ones for other elements they do
yield signicantly lower abundances and in these
cases the chemically consistent calculations do t
the observations much better than the solar metal-
licity models
43 Discussion of model parameters IMF and SFR
In Fig 8 we present observed Fe abundances FeH in
DLA galaxies together with model calculations using dif-
ferent IMFs Scalo vs Salpeter and for Sd galaxies dif-
ferent star formation rates SFR Resulting curves using
a Salpeter IMF are plotted with weak lines whereas those
for the Scalo IMF are displayed by heavy lines as before

SFR 1 35  102 and SFR 2 15  102 for Sd in case of

are larger than those resulting from models using a Scalo
IMF cf Fig 6 in section 235 Some large FeH values
observed in DLA systems can now be reached with the
Salpeter IMF but then in turn some low abundance data
fall outside the region outlined by our models This draw-
back can be compensated by lowering the star formation
rate of Sd galaxies Because the SFR of Sd galaxies is con-
stant this can be done without changing the photometric
properties of the galaxies
It should be mentioned that while the SFHs of nearby
galaxies seem to be very homogeneous for early type spi-
rals the scatter around the average SFH used in our mod-
els signicantly increases towards later types This can
be seen eg in the very small range of H equivalent
widths or colors among Sa galaxies as opposed to the much
larger scatter both in H equivalent widths and colors seen
among local Sd galaxies cf Kennicutt  Kent 1983 Buta
et al 1994
Very small SFRs are characteristic for low surface
brightness galaxies LSBs and hence we conclude that
a few observed DLA systems with particularly low abun-
dances could be either late type spirals with a lower than
average SFR or else LSB galaxies As discussed in the
previous subsection an extremely low element abundance

DLAs and our chemically consistent evolution models for
Sa and Sd galaxies
measured in DLA systems could also be due to a large
unknown impact parameter
5 Implications for DLA systems
51 DLAs at low redshift abundances versus gas content
In Fig 9 we present a reduced version of Fig 7a to show
that the upper envelope to the observed DLA abundances
heavy line clearly increases from z  45 towards z  2
but declines or remains constant from z  2 to z  0
This behavior is seen for all eight elements investigated
in Fig 7 For z  45 through z  2 abundance data for
all these elements completely cover the range between our
models for Sa through Sd galaxies For z  2 the situ-
ation changes The lower the redshift of DLA absorbers
the closer do their observed abundances fall to our early
type spiral models It looks as if at z  2 Sa disks would
no longer have large enough cross sections at the high HI
column densities required for damped Ly absorption to
appear in DLA samples Virtually all of the z  1 abun-
dance data fall close to our models for Sc or Sd galaxies
In our simple 1zone galaxy models we do not have any
information about gas densities but only about the total
gas content
Interestingly this global gas content for our Sa model
drops from more than 50  of the total mass at z  2
to  40  at z  15 while that of our Sd model still is
more than 60  at z  0 So neglecting any density struc-
ture of the HI disk which is not included in our modelling
the comparison between observed abundance data and the
enrichment evolution of our models suggests that as the
global gas content falls below 50  galaxies drop out of
the DLA absorber sample From their eorts to optically
identify DLA systems Steidel et al 1995 suspect that
there is a selection eect against luminous spiral galaxies
like our Galaxy for moderate redshift DLA systems see
also Steidel et al1997 It would be interesting to check
our prediction for low-z DLA galaxy types with HST
52 Implications for optical identications
The comparison of our spiral models with observed DLA
abundances suggests that the bulk of the DLAs are the
high redshift progenitors of presentday spiral galaxies
from Sa through Sd This has implications for the pos-
sibilities of optical detections
Spiral galaxies at z  0 have luminosities in the range
from MB  177 for Sd galaxies to MB  197 for
Sa galaxies when using the mean values for these types
in the Virgo cluster as given by Sandage et al 1985
In any case typical spirals are signicantly fainter than
L Moreover we argued in section 51 that the brighter
early type spirals seem to drop out of the DLA sample
towards low redshift due to their gas content becoming too
scarce This leads us to expect that low redshift DLA
samples should be dominated by the particularly
faint gasrich latetype spiral or even irregular or
LSB galaxies Hence we do expect early type spirals to
be among the DLA absorbers only for redshift larger than
z  15
With evolutionary and cosmological corrections calcu-
lated from our chemically consistent spectrophotometric
evolutionary synthesis code Moller et al 1998 we nd
that the typical luminosity of Sa galaxies increases up to
MB  21     217 in the range z  2    3 Taking into
account bolometric distance moduli for z  2 and 3 and
using cosmological parameters H0  50 km s1 Mpc1
and 0  1 this yields apparent magnitudes of about
mB  245    25 which are close to the detection limit
Later galaxy types are fainter eg an average Sd galaxy
at z  25 has MB  18 and mB  285 at z  15 it
has MB  176 and mB  275 and at z  05 an aver-
age Sd galaxy has MB  171 and mB  255 In terms
of R-magnitudes we expect the average early type spiral
Sa to have R  258 at z  2 and R  26 at z  25
This explains why deep surveys did not detect DLAs at
z  3 down to R  255 cf Steidel et al 1998 In the
Kband our models predict K  214 for Sa and K  26
for Sd galaxies at z  2 This also makes us understand
that on deep K images of ten QSOs with DLA systems in
the redshift range 15  z  25 investigated by Aragon
Salamanca et al 1996 only two candidates with K  20
ie from the bright end of the spiral galaxy luminosity
U Lindner et al Chemically consistent evolution of DLA galaxies
function have been detected Since our chemical evolu-
tion models suggest that the brighter early type galaxies
should drop out of the DLA sample due to too scarce gas
content towards low redshift we expect optical identica-
tions of low redshift DLA systems not to be easier an
average late-type spiral at z  05 is expected to have
B  255 R  25 and K  215 The galaxies identied
by Steidel et al1994 and 1995 in the elds of 3C 286
Q1328307 PKS 1229-021 and PKS 0454039 as can-
didates for DLA absorbers at zabs  06922 zabs  03950
and 07568 and zabs  08596 respectively indeed have
typical luminosities between MB  19 and 195 of late
type spiral galaxies We conclude that many DLA candi-
dates are out of reach for present day imaging capabilities
and hence for optical identication
53 Possible implications for abundance ratios
If our result that DLA absorbers might well be associated
with the progenitors of normal presentday spiral galaxies
of all types from Sa through Sd were conrmed by high res-
olution imaging observations a direct byproduct of our
models could be the ISM abundance ratios of various ele-
ments and their evolution with redshift To the extent that
observed Milky Way disk star abundance ratios directly
reect the ISM abundance ratios at birth of those stars
we would then expect a disklike rather than a halolike
abundance pattern for DLA systems cf the controversy
on halo vs disklike DLA abundance patterns between
Lu et al 1996 and Kulkarni et al 1997 Due to uncer-
tainties in the stellar input yields a rather small number
of observed DLA abundance ratios available at present
and a decient knowledge of how to correct for the ef-
fect of selective dust condensation however we estimate
it premature to base any conclusion on such a comparison
at present
6 Conclusions
We have compiled from the literature all available data
on element abundances in DLA systems measured over
the last decade referred them all to one set of oscillator
strength and solar reference values and subdivided them
into reliable and less reliable data
We extended our chemical galaxy evolution model to
calculate abundances for altogether 16 dierent elements
in spiral galaxies in a chemically consistent way ie ac-
counting for the steadily increasing initial metallicities of
successive generations of stars by using input data bases
stellar yields evolutionary tracks lifetimes and remnant
masses for 5 dierent metallicities from Z  0    Z 
Z Dynamical eects however are not included in our
simple 1zone models
A detailed comparison of model results with observa-
tions for eight dierent element abundances yields the fol-
lowing main results
 The conformity between observed element abundances
in DLA systems and those calculated from our models
for spiral galaxies spanning the whole redshift range
0  z  45 indicates that DLA galaxies may well
evolve into the full range of presentday spiral galaxies
 Without any adjustments and only using SFHs that
proved successful for the spectrophotometric descrip-
tion of spiral galaxies from zero to high redshift our
models successfully bridge the gap between abun-
dances observed in high redshift DLA absorbers and
the H II regions of presentday normal spiral galaxies
Sa through Sd
 The slow redshift evolution of DLA abundances com-
pared to halo CIV systems is a consequence of the
relatively long timescales for star formation in disk
galaxies
 The large scatter observed in element abundances in
DLAs of similar redshift is naturally explained by the
range of star formation rates at any redshift between
early and late type spiral galaxies
 The few observations exceeding the abundances cal-
culated for our Sa model can be explained either by
a temporarily enhanced SFR or a small starburst in
early type spirals if only SNII products are enhanced
or by a shorter characteristic timescale for star forma-
tion very early star formation enhancement or a local
overabundance along the line of sight if both SNI and
SNII products are enhanced
 Comparison of our chemically consistent models with
models using only solar metallicity input physics shows
that dierences in the redshift evolution are small for
some elements but large for others For the elements
Zn Ni and Al with large dierences the chemically con-
sistent models provide a signicantly better agreement
with observed DLA abundances
 Using a Salpeter IMF instead of Scalo yields larger
element abundances throughout and many data points
fall below the curve of the Sd model This could be
compensated by using a lower SFR and means that
more DLAs could be LSB galaxies
Our comparison of element abundances observed in
DLA systems with those resulting from our chemically
consistent galaxy evolution models has important impli-
cations for the nature of low redshift DLAs and the pos-
sibility of optical identication of DLAs over the whole
redshift range
 The upper envelope to observed DLA abundances in-
creases from z  45 to z  2 and decreases to smaller
redshifts whereas our Sa model abundances increase
steadily This leads to the conclusion that Sa galaxies
at low redshift may not have gas at sucient HI col-
umn densities over large enough cross sections to cause
damped Ly absorption whereas Sd galaxies appear
as DLA systems down to z  0 This can explain why
U Lindner et al Chemically consistent evolution of DLA galaxies
much less DLA systems have been found at low red-
shift in the HST key project QSO Absorption Lines
Bahcall et al 1993 than expected from their high
redshift frequency
 The comparison between our models and observations
suggests that DLA systems could be the progenitors
of Sa to Sd type galaxies with intrinsically faint late
type spirals dominating at low redshift Estimates from
our chemically consistent spectrophotometric evolu-
tion models  including evolutionary and cosmological
corrections  predict comparable luminosities for the
brighter early type spiral DLA galaxies at z  2    3
and for the intrinsically fainter late type spirals ex-
pected to dominate DLA samples at z  05 B  255
R 25 and K  215
