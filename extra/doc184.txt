ABSTRACT
We investigate the evolution of the star formation rate in cluster galaxies We complement
data from the CNOC1 cluster survey 015  z  06 with measurements from galaxy
clusters in the 2dF galaxy redshift survey 005  z  01 and measurements from recently
published work on higher redshift clusters up to almost z  1 We focus our attention on
galaxies in the cluster core ie galaxies with r  07h1
70 Mpc Averaging over clusters in
redshift bins we nd that the fraction of galaxies with strong OII emission is  20 in
cluster cores and the fraction evolves little with redshift In contrast eld galaxies from the
survey show a very strong increase over the same redshift range It thus appears that the
environment in the cores of rich clusters is hostile to star formation at all the redshifts studied
We compare this result with the evolution of the colours of galaxies in cluster cores rst
reported by Butcher  Oemler 1984 Using the same galaxies for our analysis of the OII
emission we conrm that the fraction of blue galaxies which are dened as galaxies 02 mag
bluer in the rest frame B  V than the red sequence of each cluster increases strongly with
redshift Since the colours of galaxies retain a memory of their recent star formation history
while emission from the OII line does not we suggest that these two results can best be
reconciled if the rate at which the clusters are being assembled is higher in the past and the
galaxies from which it is being assembled are typically bluer

1 INTRODUCTION
More than 20 years ago Butcher  Oemler 1978 rst reported a
puzzling evolution in the colours of cluster galaxies the Butcher-
Oemler effect Their results were surprising because they showed
that galaxies in clusters could not have all formed at early times
of the universe and subsequently evolved passively which was a
popular theory at the time Eggen Lynden-bell  Sandage 1962
The initial results have been conrmed in many subsequent stud-
ies eg Butcher  Oemler 1984 BO84 Couch  Newell 1984
Kodama  Bower 2001 Ellingson et al 2001 Margonnier et al
2001 Despite the vintage of these results there is still uncertainty
over their interpretation The result remains surprising since the
cluster environment would seem hostile to star formation Clus-
ter galaxies undergo efcient ram pressure Gunn  Gott 1972

encounters with other galaxies Moore et al 1996 1999 Cur-
rently the most popular explanation is that the blue galaxies are a
galaxy population that has arrived only recently in the cluster Even
though their star formation may be suppressed their previous star
formation history will still be reected in their blue colours Kauff-
man 1996 Ellingson et al 2001 for a recent review see Bower
 Balogh 2004 This scenario also ts well with observations of a
signicant population of post-starburst galaxies in clusters at z  1
Dressler  Gunn 1992 Postman Lubin  Oke 1998 Dressler et
al 1999 Poggianti et al 1999
On the other hand the previous discussion does not address
why the population of blue cluster galaxies evolves so strongly with
redshift Although the rate of infall into clusters does evolve with
redshift Bower 1991 Kauffmann 1996 Diaferio et al 2001 on its
own this effect seems insufcient to account for the rapid evolution
The additional component may come from the rapid change in the
star formation rates of eld galaxies over the same redshift range
Ellingson et al 2001 It is then a matter of some debate whether
the population of blue galaxies is a population of galaxies actually
in the cluster itself or whether they represent a population of in-
falling galaxies that have not yet reached the high density region in
the cluster core
Nakata et al
Furthermore colours do not tell the complete story In order
to investigate the nature of the Butcher-Oemler effect more di-
rectly we have set out to measure the star formation rate of galax-
ies in the cluster core H is the preferred estimator of star for-
mation in the optical but a large homogeneous survey covering a
wide range of redshifts has not yet been completed see Balogh 
Morris 2000 Couch et al 2001 Balogh et al 2002 Finn Zaritsky
 McCarthy 2004 Kodama et al 2004 for some recent results on
distant clusters The best available alternative is to use the large
and homogeneous sample of clusters that form the CNOC1 survey
eg Yee Ellingson  Carlberg 1996 Although this survey lacks
the wavelength coverage to measure the strength of H we can
investigate the evolution of star formation activity using the OII
3727 emission line This dataset allows us to investigate the evo-
lution of the equivalent width of the OII line EWOII over the
redshift range 015  z  06 For a datum at lower redshift we
compare these measurements with the local 2dF data Colless et
al 2001 2003 At higher redshifts we compare the trends seen in
the CNOC1 data with publicly available catalogues of four clusters

There has been a recent realization that the galaxy population
is strongly bimodal Kauffman et al 2003 with distinct active
star forming population and a passive population with low levels
of star formation Within the active population the star formation
rate seems to vary little with environment Balogh et al 2004b
Baldry et al 2004 and that it is therefore more useful to charac-
terise the galaxy population from the ratio of the active and pas-
sive populations We follow this procedure here focusing on the
fraction of strongly star forming galaxies EWOII  10 A as a
function of redshift
This paper is structured as follows In Section 2 we briey
describe data used for our analysis In Section 3 we investigate the
evolution of the fraction of strong star-forming galaxies at z  1
We will show that there seems to be little evolution in the star for-
mation activity within the clusters Therefore in Section 4 we com-
pare our results with the evolution of the blue galaxy fraction in the
CNOC1 clusters We consider the wider implication of these results
in Section 5 and summarise our results in Section 6 Throughout
this paper we assume a cosmology with 0  03 0  07

The CNOC1 catalogue eg Yee et al 1996 is a spectroscopic
sample of 16 X-ray bright clusters at intermediate redshift 015 
z  06 selected from the EMSS catalogue Gioia  Luppino
1994 Our aim is to study star formation in high mass systems
thus we exclude E0906 for which a velocity dispersion could not
be computed because of an apparent double component structure
Carlberg et al 1996
We calculate the K-corrected absolute B-magnitude in the
rest frame using the K-corrections given in Fukugita Shimasaku
 Ichikawa 1995 They are based on Coleman Wu  Weedmans
1980 and Kennicutts 1992 spectral atlas The completeness of
catalogued objects is adopted from Balogh et al 1999 We apply
a magnitude dependent weight Wm to correct for galaxies which
are omitted from the spectroscopic catalogue Figure 1 shows the
luminosity function LF of CNOC1 galaxies in the rest-frame B

line shows the LF of 2dF galaxies Note that these LFs include eld galax-
ies as well as cluster galaxies
band The dotted and the solid lines indicate the raw counts and the
counts corrected for spectroscopic incompleteness respectively
We include not only cluster galaxies but also eld ones to check the
completeness of the catalogue The gure compares the CNOC1
LF with that of galaxies from the 2dF-galaxy redshift survey 2dF-
GRS sample see below It is clear from Figure 1 that incom-
pleteness in the input catalogues is signicant below MB  195
solid line Therefore we set a limiting magnitude of our analysis
as MB  195 which corresponds to  M   1
Cluster membership is based on the radial velocity difference
from the brightest cluster galaxy using the method described in
Balogh et al 1999 We estimate the projected radial dependence
of the cluster velocity dispersion r from the average measured
dispersion 1 using the mass model of Carlberg Yee  Elling-
son 1997 Galaxies with normalized velocities less than 3r are
considered cluster members We also extract eld galaxies from the
same CNOC1 area We treat galaxies with normalized velocities
greater than 6r as eld galaxies We use only galaxies within
07h1
70 Mpc radius which is a characteristic value of the cut-off ra-
dius adopted by BO84 This facilitates direct comparison with the
Butcher-Oemler effect Table 1 summarises the sample we used

We use data from the 2dF galaxy redshift survey Colless et al
2001 2003 to set a low redshift datum We take a volume limited
sample of the data in the redshift range 005  z  01 and only
galaxies brighter than MB  195 in order to match the limiting
magnitude of the CNOC1 sample Figure 1 The 2dF EWOII
measurement is smoothed with a gaussian kernel of width 2 A to
match the mean error on CNOC1 EWOII measurements

3 THE EVOLUTION OF EWOII OF CLUSTER
GALAXIES
As we discussed in the introduction OII emission is a workable
tracer of star formation in a statistical sense eg Hopkins et al
2003 nevertheless we will avoid explicit conversion of EWOII
into star formation rates For our purposes it is sufcient to com-
pare the line emission properties of highlow redshift and clus-
tereld galaxies directly This results in a comparison of well de-
ned observational quantities
Figure 3 shows the distribution of EWOII in 2dF CNOC1
and high-z galaxies There is a strong spike around EWOII 
0 A for cluster galaxies at all redshifts This is expected since star
formation is known to be strongly suppressed in galaxy clusters In
contrast the eld galaxies have a much wider distribution
Figure 2 The LF of high-z galaxies in the rest frame B band The solid
and the dashed line indicate the LF of galaxies at 06  z  08 and
08  z  10 respectively which is catalogued at Postman et al 2001
The lled circles shows the LF of galaxies in MS 1054 The catalogue of
the MS 1054 does not include eld galaxies while the LFs of Postmans
catalogue include galaxies in both eld and cluster environments
2PIGGZ cluster and group catalogue Eke et al 2004 We only use
those clusters whose velocity dispersion is larger than 500 kms
and also require that the number of member galaxies is larger than
30 in order to exclude poor systems with over estimated velocity
dispersion Note that even if we adopt more strict conditions for
selecting cluster systems from the 2dF catalogue the results we
show do not change signicantly There are 366 galaxies within
07h1
70 Mpc radius from the center of clustering systems we adopt
and there are 12426 eld galaxies
23 Higher redshift data sets
To investigate the effect of evolution at higher redshift we added
two publicly available catalogues Cl 13243011 z  076
Cl 16044304 z  090 and Cl 16044321 z  092 are
from Postman et al 2001 and MS 1054-03 from van Dokkum
et al 2000 In addition to the cluster galaxies the Postman data

Redshift is increasing from left to right with 005  z  01 2dF
015  z  06 CNOC1 and 06  z  1 high-z galaxies The cluster
galaxy sample is shown in the top panels and the eld sample in the bottom
panels respectively
As we have discussed the H equivalent width distribution
Balogh et al 2004b Kauffmann et al 2004 is strongly bimodal
The bimodality corresponds to a blue star-forming population and
a red population of galaxies no longer forming stars The distri-
bution of EWOII is less clearly bimodal due to the less direct
and less sensitive relation between OII emission and star for-
mation Nevertheless the distribution can still be usefully decom-
posed into two populations by separating the distribution at a par-
ticular EWOII value We have chosen to make this separation at
EWOII  10 A The particular choice of 10 A is not crucial but
roughly separates the galaxies with strong star formation from the
passive population By examining the objects scattered to negative
OII values we can estimate the level of contamination With the
10 A cut less than 1 of galaxies with intrinsically low star forma-
tion rate scatter into the EWOII  10 A population
In order to investigate the redshift evolution of star formation
activity we determine the fraction of starforming galaxies as those
with EWOII  10 A hereafter f10 As Balogh et al 2004b
discusses the evolution of this fraction provides a better indicator
of the galaxy population than the median star formation rate We
have conrmed that similar trends are seen in the median but they
are more difcult to interpret due to the highly skewed distribution
of EWOII
The evolution of f10 is shown in Figure 4a The triangles
circles and squares indicate the 2dF CNOC1 and high-z data sets
respectively The lled symbols correspond to the cluster samples
while the open symbols correspond to the eld galaxy samples
The limiting magnitudes of the z  08 data sets do not reach
MB  195 see 23 The fractions measured for these systems
are shown by the crosses in the diagram In order to compare these
clusters with the other data points we must make a correction for
the additional contribution to f10 from galaxies below the magni-
tude limit We estimate this by determining the dependence of f10
on limiting magnitude for CNOC1 galaxies at 03  z  06 as
described below Figure 5
As we should expect from previous work on the cosmic vol-
ume averaged star formation rate Lilly et al 1996 Madau et al
1996 Madau Pozzetti  Dickinson 1998 Hopkins 2004 eld
galaxies show a strong increase in the active galaxy fraction with
redshift In order to quantify the evolution in f10 we perform least-
squares ts using the equation f10  1  a1  zb For eld
galaxies we nd a  072  004 and b  289  074
In contrast the fraction of active galaxies is always low in the
cluster galaxies and there is little discernible increase with redshift
as far as z  08 In order to perform least-squares ts we combine

fraction of each cluster which is binned at the panel a The vertical dotted
line in the gure separates the data sets for where we have had to apply a
correction to allow for the brighter limiting magnitude The crosses illus-
trate the fraction before the correction was made While the eld galaxies
show a rapid evolution in f10 the fraction in clusters changes little out to

the distant clusters at z  06 Cl 1324 MS 1054 Cl 16044302
and Cl 16044321 from the different surveys into a single bin
We nd that a  087  002 and b  028  014 for cluster
galaxies Thus the parameter b which indicates an evolutionary
strength of cluster galaxies is inconsistent with that of eld galax-
ies with  3 level This result is in agreement with the weak
evolution in the cluster core emission population derived from a
principle component analysis reported for the CNOC1 alone clus-
ters by Ellingson et al 2001 but extends the trend to both lower
and higher redshift We will contrast this result with the evolution
of the blue fraction in clusters reported by BO84 in the following
section
Figure 4b shows the fraction of star forming galaxies of each
individual cluster The variation in f10 is large at all redshifts due
to the small numbers of galaxies in each individual cluster It is
possible to nd individual clusters with f10 as low as 0 or as high
as 06 From the limited data that is currently available the scat-
ter appears similar at both low and high redshift The apparent in-
consistency between MS1054 which has a very low f10 and the
CL1604 clusters which have signicantly higher values appears
entirely consistent with the variations seen in lower redshift clus-
ters It is important to realise however that the highest redshift

03  z  06 respectively The dashed and dotted lines show the 2dF and
high-z galaxies respectively
sample is limited to only 4 clusters and thus has limited sampling
of the range of f10 in clusters at this redshift
The fraction of emissionline or blue galaxies within a given
projected radius is an overestimate of the blue fraction within the
corresponding physical radius because of the strong colour gradi-
ent in clusters We can estimate the effect of projection from the
simulations of Diaferio et al 2001 their Figure 13 This work
shows that within a projected radius of  07h1
70 Mpc the frac-
tion of interlopers dened as galaxies with physical distances be-
yond R200 depends strongly on galaxy colour  60 per cent for
blue galaxies and only  10 per cent for red galaxies Making a
correction for these interlopers reduces our blue or starforming
fractions in clusters from  20 per cent to  10 per cent More-
over if the fraction of blue interlopers increases with increasing
redshift as expected due to the colour evolution in the eld this
will make the observed trend of f10 with redshift in clusters even
weaker Thus accounting for projection effects only strengthens our
conclusions
In order to investigate the dependence on limiting magnitude
in the data-sets we have used we determined f10 for different lu-
minosity bins The result is shown in Figure 5 The solid and dot-
dashed lines indicate the CNOC1 galaxies at 015  z  03 and
03  z  06 respectively and the dashed lines show 2dF galax-
ies We also show a result of high-z galaxies with the dotted lines
Because of the low numbers of galaxies and variable magnitude
limits we only plot two points for high-z galaxies
It is clear that the fainter galaxies in the eld are more likely
to be star forming and possess larger EWOII than brighter ones
Kauffmann et al 2003 Baldry et al 2004 Balogh et al 2004a
On the other hand the trend is much weaker for galaxies in cluster
cores over the magnitude range probed by this data The plot also
conrms the trends seen in Figure 4 the fraction of star forming
galaxies is always greater in the eld than in the cluster and that
the redshift evolution is seen for eld galaxies but not for cluster
galaxies
4 COMPARISON WITH BLUE GALAXY FRACTIONS
In the previous section we nd that the EWOII of galaxies in
clusters shows little evolution at z  1 At face value this re-
sult seems to be inconsistent with the Butcher-Oemler effect the

redshift The lled circles show the average blue fraction in each redshift
bin The small open circle indicates the fraction for each cluster The solid
line are extrapolations to higher redshifts of the observed evolution of fb
obtained by BO84 The dashed and dotted line indicate the fb derived by
Ellingson et al 2001 and Margonnier et al 2001 respectively
increase in the fraction of blue galaxies in cluster cores with red-
shift Butcher  Oemler 1978 BO84 Couch  Newell 1984 The
difference cannot be due to the cluster sample used by Kodama
 Bower 2001 and Ellingson et al 2001 both found a signif-
icant Butcher-Oemler effect using the CNOC1 clusters However
among the sample used by Kodama  Bower 2001 only bright
galaxies are spectroscopically conrmed requiring them to apply
a foregroundbackground subtraction using a general eld data for
faint galaxies This enabled them to reach MV  205 log h50
consistent with the original denition of the limiting magnitude of
Butcher-Oemler effect Ellingson et al 2001 investigate blue frac-
tions of CNOC1 galaxies using spectroscopically conrmed mem-
bers however the radius constraint they adopted is a dynamically
determined value R200 the radius within which the average clus-
ter density is 200 times the critical density eg Carlberg et al
1996 1997 The R200 of CNOC1 clusters is 107-224 h1
70 Mpc
which is wider than our radius constraints 07h1
70 Mpc In order
to eliminate the possibility that the increasing trend may be due
to galaxies in the outer cluster region we directly compare with
measurements of the evolution in EWOII by recomputing the
blue fraction only from the spectroscopically conrmed galaxies
and adopting the same limiting magnitude and radial cut-off
We use the g  r colour in Thuan-Gunn system Thuan 
Gunn 1976 which is available in the CNOC1 catalogue to discrim-
inate between blue and red galaxies On the g  r versus r diagram
we t the colour-magnitude relation for the early-type galaxies us-
ing a biweight t Beers Flynn  Gebhardt 1990 Blue galaxies
are dened as galaxies 02 mag bluer in the rest frame B  V than
the red-sequence of each cluster We calculate the difference in gr
colour in the observed bands corresponding to B  V   02
in the rest frame BO84 Kodama  Bower 2001 This corresponds
to g  r of 020-044 mag depending on the cluster redshift
As discussed above we x the radial cut off at 07h1
70 Mpc this is
typical of the R30 cut off used by BO84 Note that our magnitude
limit is MB  195 which is brighter than the limit of BO84
MV  193
Nakata et al
Figure 6 shows the calculated blue fraction as a function of
redshift The lled circles show the average blue fraction from the
CNOC1 data The small open circles show the blue fraction of each
individual cluster The solid line in Figure 6 is a linear extrapola-
tion to higher redshifts of the observed evolution of fb obtained by
BO84 while the dashed line and the dotted line indicate the best-t
lines from Ellingson et al 2001 and Margonnier et al 2001 re-
spectively In contrast to the results we obtained from our analysis
of EWOII we see that the blue galaxy fraction of CNOC1 clus-
ters has an increasing trend with redshift Although the uncertainty
is large the slope of this relation is consistent with BO84 Kodama
 Bower 2001 and Ellingson et al 2001 Note that even if we
make the colour boundary redder by 01 mag B V   01
the increasing trend of the fb does not change signicantly As the
magnitude limits are different between our analysis and BO84 it
is not surprising that our results fall slightly below the trend pro-
posed by BO84 This reects the trend for a larger fraction of fainter
galaxies to have blue colours Kodama  Bower 2001 Kauffmann
et al 2003 See also Figure 5 Our fb values are also slightly lower
than those of Ellingson et al 2001 a difference that arises from
the different radial constraints we have applied we use only galax-
70 Mpc while their sample in-
ies at the cluster core r  07h1
clude galaxies out to R200 The extremely rapid change in fb over
the redshift range out to z  02 reported by Margonnier et al
2001 is not consistent with our study
5 DISCUSSION
We set out to investigate the evolution of the OII line in cluster
galaxies We found that the fraction of cluster galaxies with strong
OII emission was always small and evolved little with redshift
Viewed in isolation this result is not surprising the very dense en-
vironment in cluster cores is hostile to star formation The com-
monly discussed environmental processes of ram-pressure Gunn
 Gott 1972 Abadi et al 1999 Fujita  Nagashima 1999 Quilis
et al 2000 harassment Moore et al 1996 1999 and strangulation
Larson et al 1980 Balogh et al 2000 Drake et al 2000 Diaferio
et al 2001 Okamoto  Nagashima 2003 are all effective in this
region Our results are showing us that this environment has always
been hostile even out to z  1 The very dense environment of the
cluster core becomes increasingly rare as we look back to higher
redshift but star formation is always highly suppressed there
What is puzzling is to compare this result to the evolution in
the colours of cluster galaxies A long history of studies have re-
ported an increase in the fraction of blue galaxies in cluster cores
at higher redshifts BO84 Kodama  Bower 2001 Ellingson et
al 2001 Margonnier et al 2001 With the CNOC1 data set we
are able to compare the two measurements of galaxy star formation
activity directly Within the large uncertainties the colours of the
galaxies conrm the increase in blue fraction suggested by BO84
First we consider two biases in the measurements that could
affect this result 1 Aperture effects are of course a worry in
assessing these results However Appendix A of Wilman et al
2004 makes a detailed study of the likely effect on OII emis-
sion by examining the radial dependence of the colours of galax-
ies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey hereafter SDSS York et al
2000 Stoughton et al 2002 Abazajian et al 2003 He concludes
that there is currently no evidence that the fraction of OII emit-
ting galaxies determined from relatively small apertures eg by the
2dF and SDSS ber spectrographs is substantially different from
that determined through larger apertures 2 If the measurement
error on the OII emission was large a weak trend in the frac-
tion of OII emitters could be masked by objects with intrinsically
low star formation rates being scattered into the EWOII  10 A
region However the estimated errors in the CNOC1 equivalent
widths are only 2 A on average and thus the error is too small to
account for the tail seen in Figure 3 as we have shown in 3
If we reject both of these measurement biases how can we
reconcile these apparently contradictory results The key may lie
in the way the two measures of the galaxy activity are related to
the star formation history While the OII emission measures the
radiation from short-lived hot stars the g  r colour contains a
memory of the star formation rate over the previous few Gyr eg
van Dokkum et al 2000 Thus one possible explanation for the
result is that while most galaxies in these central cluster regions
currently have little star formation at all redshifts more galaxies in
the higher redshift clusters have experienced signicant star forma-
tion within the last few Gyr and have evolved from a bluer starting
point In Figure 7 we directly compare the EWOII with the off-
set of the galaxy from the dividing colour between blue and red
galaxy which is dened at 4 g  r At higher redshift there
is a greater spread in colour for the range of EWOII due both
to the K-correction and the greater star formation rates of eld
galaxies while the range in EWOII is roughly similar Thus the
star forming population in the lower redshift bin lie closer to the
colour threshold than to the EWOII threshold while the converse
is true in the high redshift panel This provides some support for
the differential evolution of EWOII and colour that we have dis-
cussed
If this is a satisfactory explanation for the different evolution
of f10 and fb can we understand what drives it Two possibili-
ties stand out 1 the more rapid assembly of clusters at higher
redshift Bower 1991 Kauffmann 1996 or 2 the star formation
rates in the galaxies that are being accreted by the local clusters
are lower than in their high redshift counter parts In the rst case
the mass assembly history of clusters differs between low and high
redshift because clusters are much rarer objects at z  05 than at
the present-day and because the cosmic time available to build the
cluster is less at higher redshift In the second case the reduction in
the star forming fraction of the infalling galaxies is clearly shown
by our data on the eld galaxies As a result the galaxies which are
accreted by the local clusters are much less likely to have signif-
icant star formation in the rst place It is likely that both effects
contribute and hard to disentangle them
An alternative possibility is that the OII emission is pow-
ered by AGN activity rather than by star formation In this case
the fractions would reect very different physical processes whose
evolution might very well differ The scenario naturally explains
the existence of red galaxies with detectable OII seen in the rst
panel of Figure 7 Martini et al 2004 show from X-ray obser-
vations that clusters may contain a signicant population of AGN
Often these galaxies cannot be recognised as AGN from their opti-
cal spectra alone yet they are clearly luminous point sources in the
X-ray data Their results suggest that the active systems are over
represented in clusters compared to the eld It is thus possible that
an underlying trend in the star formation rates of cluster galaxies is
masked by a opposing trend in the fraction undergoing AGN activ-
ity It should be noted however that the average AGN fraction is
signicantly less that 5 in their data
In future it will also be possible to carry out this programme
using other indicators of star formation and to investigate other
galaxy environments Wilman et al 2004 have used OII to in-
vestigate the evolution of galaxies in groups Interestingly they nd
OII Emission from Cluster Galaxies
Figure 7 EWOII versus g  r diagrams of the CNOC1 cluster galaxies The vertical axis shows the differential colour dened as the observed colour
minus the dividing colour between blue and red galaxy see text for detail at the same MB magnitude The sequence of panels shows clusters at increasing
redshift At higher redshift the blue galaxy population becomes increasingly offset from the red colour sequence We also show the fraction of galaxies in
each of the four regions
that the fraction of star forming galaxies in the group environment
increases signicantly over the redshift range z  0 to 05 sug-
gesting that group galaxy properties are much more closely tied to
galaxies in the eld than galaxies in cluster cores While the OII
line is conveniently placed in the optical spectral window it suffers
the disadvantage of being sensitive to dust and metallicity as well
as the star formation rate The H line gives a cleaner measure of
the star formation rate For example Finn et al 2004 report mea-
surements of H emission from a poor cluster Cl J00230423B
at z  0845 Although their measure of activity is not directly
comparable to the one we use here they nd a much higher inci-
dence of star formation activity than any of our clusters or that of
our H measurements in the rich cluster Cl00241652 Kodama
et al 2004 At present however the sample of clusters with well
sampled H determinations is too small to make an accurate test
of the rate of evolution Furthermore it is harder to measure over
a wide range of redshifts because it is redshifted out of the optical
window Nevertheless new multi-object spectrographs working in
the near infrared such as MOIRICs will allow us to probe the star
formation rates in distant clusters with much greater accuracy us-
ing H emission Alternatively it will be possible to use the Spitzer
satellite to measure the star formation rates in clusters on the basis
of their far infra-red dust emission Duc et al 2002 Stanford et al
in prep The prospects look extremely good for extending the work
we have described here
6 CONCLUSIONS
By compiling a homogeneous sample of the clusters with extensive
spectroscopic measurements of the OII emission line we have
presented an analysis of the evolution of the fraction of strongly
star forming galaxies in cluster cores as a function of redshift Our
sample is based on the CNOC1 cluster survey Yee et al 1996 but
extends this data set to lower and higher redshift using the 2dF-GRS
Colless et al 2003 and spectroscopic surveys of higher redshift
clusters by Postman et al 2001 and van Dokkum et al 2000
Our results show little evolution in the fraction of galaxies
with EWOII  10 A We constrain the rate of evolution to be
f10z  02 This result suggests that the cluster environ-
ment has always been hostile to star formation at least for z  1
Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hostility of
the cluster environment at low redshift Our results show that the
same mechanisms also operate effectively in this special environ-
ment at higher redshift despite the higher rates of galaxy infall
that are expected Kaufman 1996 and the higher fraction of star
forming galaxies in the eld population It is important to note
however that there is extensive scatter between individual clusters
at all redshifts thus individual clusters may pass through episodes
with higher rates of eld galaxy accretion
The slow evolution of f10 we report initially seems at odds
with the strongly increasing fraction of blue galaxies in clusters re-
ported in previous papers eg BO84 however we conrm that the
fraction of blue galaxies increases strongly with redshift using the
same galaxies for our analysis of the OII emission We consider
how the results can be reconciled Since the OII emission line is
an instantaneous measure of the star formation rate while galaxy
colour reects the average star formation rate over the previous few
Gyr the two observations may be compatible if the rate at which
clusters are assembled is sufciently high at high redshift and the
galaxies from which the system is assembled are initially much
bluer Another possibility is that the OII emission line galaxies
that we see in the low redshift systems may be powered by AGN
activity rather than by AGN activity A larger compilation of deep
X-ray data is required to exclude this possibility
The results we present are limited by the small numbers of
clusters which have been extensively surveyed at high redshift and
by the limitations of the OII emission line as a star formation
