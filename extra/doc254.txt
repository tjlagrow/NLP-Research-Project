Abstract
the study of how and where the chemical elements formed and how they were distributed in the
stars and gas in galaxies The main ingredients to build models of galactic chemical evolution
will be described They include initial conditions star formation history stellar nucleosynthesis
and gas ows in and out of galaxies Then some simple analytical models and their solutions
will be discussed together with the main criticisms associated to them The yield per stellar
generation will be dened and the hypothesis of instantaneous recycling approximation will be
critically discussed Detailed numerical models of chemical evolution of galaxies of dierent
morphological type able to follow the time evolution of the abundances of single elements will
be discussed and their predictions will be compared to observational data The comparisons will
include stellar abundances as well as interstellar medium ones measured in galaxies I will show
how from these comparisons one can derive important constraints on stellar nucleosynthesis
and galaxy formation mechanisms Most of the concepts described in this lecture can be found
in the monograph by Matteucci 2012
1 Introduction
We call chemical evolution of galaxies the study of how the chemical elements formed in stars
and were distributed in galaxies During the Big Bang only the light elements H D He Li
were synthesized while stars have been responsible for the formation and distribution of all
the elements from carbon to uranium and beyond Some light elements such as Li Be and
B are formed during the spallation process which is the interaction between the cosmic rays
and CNO atoms present in the interstellar medium ISM Therefore stars produce chemical
elements in their interiors by means of nuclear reactions of fusion and then restore these elements
into the ISM when they die The fusion reactions occur up to 56F e which is the element with
the maximum binding energy per nucleon For elements heavier than 56F e the nuclear fusion
is therefore inhibited and the nuclear ssion is favored The stars are born live and die and
they can die in a quiescent fashion like white dwarfs or violently as supernovae SNe The
supernovae can be of various types core-collapse SNe namely the explosion of single massive
stars M  10M Type II Ib Ic  and Type Ia SNe namely the explosion of a white dwarf
occurring after accreting material from a companion in a binary system In this lecture I will
rst describe the ingredients necessary to build galactic chemical evolution models Such models
can be analytical or numerical and they aim at following the evolution in time and space of the
abundances of the chemical elements in the ISM Then I will focuse on some highlights in
the galactic chemical evolution and on the comparison models-observations In doing so I will
show how chemical evolution models can constrain stellar nucleosynthesis and galaxy formation
timescales
2 Basic ingredients for galactic chemical evolution
The basic ingredients necessary to build a chemical evolution model are
 Initial conditions
The initial conditions consist in deciding whether to assume an open or a closed model in
other words to decide if the gas out of which the stars form is present since the beginning
or if it is accreted during the galactic lifetime moreover one should assume whether the
initial gas has a primordial only light elements from the Big Bang or enriched chemical
composition
 Stellar birthrate function SFRxIMF
The stellar birthrate function is the history of star formation in a galaxy and it can be
expressed as the product of the star formation rate SFR per the initial mass function
IMF namely
Bm t  t  m
where the function t represents the SFR and it is generally assumed to be only a function
of time whereas m is the IMF which is assumed to be only a function of mass The SFR
represents how many solar masses go into stars per unit time while the IMF is the initial
stellar mass function describing the distribution of stars at birth as a function of the stellar
mass Clearly these hypotheses are semplications and we do not know whether the SFR
is independent of mass and the IMF independent of time
21 Parametrization of the SFR
The most common parametrization is the Schmidt 1959 law where the SFR is proportional
to some power k of the gas density Kennicutt 1998 suggested k  14015 as deduced by
data relative to star forming galaxies Other important parameters such as gas temperature
viscosity and magnetic eld are usually ignored
The Kennicutt SFR can be written as
t  k
where k
the SFR per unit mass of gas
gas is the gas surface mass density and  is the eciency of star formation namely

22 Parametrization of the IMF
The IMF namely the number of stars born in the mass interval m-mdm is generally
expressed as a power law It is possible to measure the IMF only in the solar vicinity since
one needs to count the stars as functions of their magnitudes and it is still not possible to
do it in external galaxies Therefore the only observational information we have is relative
to the solar region of our Galaxy
 Stellar nucleosynthesis
The stellar yields are dened as the masses of chemical elements produced by stars of
dierent masses These yields can represent both the newly formed elements or the elements
already present in the star at its formation and restored into the ISM without being
reprocessed
In particular we can dene the yield of a newly formed element pim as
the integral over the stellar lifetime of the mass loss rate multiplied by Xi-Xoi where
Xoi is the original abundance of the element i To obtain the total stellar yield it should
be added to this term the mass ejected without processing namely Xoi x mass lost where
with mass lost we intend the total mass ejected by a star into the ISM during its lifetime
Each stellar mass can produce and eject dierent chemical elements and the yields are
therefore a function of the stellar mass but also of the original stellar metal content that
we will indicate with Z These yields are computed by means of detailed nucleosynthesis
calculations taking into account all the main nuclear reactions in stars Here we summarize
briey the element production in stars
i low and intermediate mass stars 08-8 M
produce He N C and heavy s-process elements They die as C-O white dwarfs when
single and can die as Type Ia SNe when binaries
ii Stars with M  08M do not
contribute to galactic chemical enrichment and have lifetimes longer than the Hubble time
iii Massive stars M  8  10M they produce mainly alpha-elements O Ne Mg S
Si Ca some Fe light s-process elements and perhaps r-process elements  and explode
as core-collapse SNe However r-process elements originating in neutron binary mergers
seems to represent the most promising channel for r-process element production these days
see Matteucci et al 2014 and references therein
 Gas ows infall outow radial ows
In order to build a realistic galaxy one has to assume the presence of gas ows both in and
out The gas inows are considered either as gas accretion or radial gas ows and they are
inuencing the chemical evolution of galaxies in the case of accretion  usually assumed at
a constant rate or exponentially decreasing in time the main eect is to dilute the metal
content In the case of outows or galactic winds also the eect is to decrease the metal
concentration by decreasing the gas which is available for star formation Galactic outows
are generally assumed to occur at a rate proportional to the star formation rate
3 The yield per stellar generation
The yield per stellar generation of a single chemical element can be dened as Tinsley 1980
yi  R 
1 mpimmdm
1  R
where pim is the mass of the newly produced element i ejected by a star of mass m and R is the
returned fraction The yield yi is therefore the mass fraction of the element i newly produced
by a generation of stars relative to the fraction of mass in remnants white dwarfs neutron stars
and black holes and never dying low mass stars M  01M
We dene returned fraction the fraction of mass ejected into the ISM by an entire stellar
generation namely
R  Z 
m  Mremmdm
The term fraction originates from the fact that both yi and R are divided by the normalization
condition of the IMF namely
mmdm  1
In order to dene yi and R we have made a very specic assumption the instantaneous
recycling approximation IRA which states that all stars more massive than 1M die
instantaneously while all stars less massive live forever This assumption allows us to solve
the chemical evolution equations analytically as we will see in the following but it is a very
poor approximation for chemical elements produced on long timescales such as C N and Fe On
the other hand for oxygen which is almost entirely produced by short lived core-collapse SNe
IRA is an acceptable approximation In Figure 1 we show yO and R computed for dierent
initial metallicities of the stars and dierent IMFs As one can see the dependence of these
quantities on Z is negligible whereas that on the IMF is strong In that Figure it does not appear
the Kroupa2001 universal IMF suggesting that the IMF in stellar clusters is an universal one
Kroupa 2001 IMF is a two-slope IMF with a slope for stars more massive than 05M very
similar to that of the Salpeter 1955 IMF still widely used in model for external galaxies
4 The Simple Model
The Simple Model of chemical evolution assumes that the system is evolving as a closed-box
without inows or outows the IMF is constant in time the chemical composition of the gas
is primordial and the mixing between the chemical products ejected by stars and the ISM is
instantaneous plus IRA
The initial gas mass is therefore Mgas0  Mtot  constant   MgasMtot
fractionary mass of gas the metallicity is Z  MZ Mgas is zero at the time t0 The basic
equations can be written as
 t  Z 
m  MRt  mmdm
which describes the evolution of gas and where the integral is the rate at which dying stars
restore both the enriched and unenriched material into the ISM at the time t
The equation for metals is
dZMgas
 Zt  Z 
m  MRZt  m  mpZmt  mmdm
where the rst term in the square brackets represents the mass of pristine metals which are
restored into the ISM without suering any nuclear processing whereas the second term contains
the newly formed and ejected metals Maeder 1992 When IRA is assumed the SFR can be
taken out of the integrals and the equation for metals be solved analytically Its solution is
Z  yZln
The metallicity yield per stellar generation yZ which appears in the above equation is known
as eective yield simply dened as the yield yZef f that would be deduced if the system were
assumed to be described by the Simple Model
Therefore the eective yield is
yZef f 
ln1
Clearly the true yield yZ will be always lower than the eective one in both cases of winds
and infall of primordial gas The only way to increase the eective yield is to assume an IMF
more weighted towards massive stars than the canonical IMFs
41 Primary and secondary elements
We dene primary element an element produced directly from H and He A typical primary
element is carbon or oxygen which originate from the 3- reactions We dene secondary element
an element produced starting from metals already present in the star at birth eg nitrogen
produced in the CNO cycle We recall that the solution of the chemical evolution equations for
a secondary element with abundance XS implies
yZ Z
where yS is the yield per stellar generation of the secondary element This means that
for a secondary element the simple closed-box model predicts that its abundance increases
proportionally to the metallicity squared namely
XS  Z 2
5 Analytical solutions for outow and inow
In the case of a model with outow but no inow occurring at a rate
W t  1  Rt
where  is a free parameter larger than or equal to zero the solution for the metallicity of the
system is
1  
ln1  1  
It is clear that in the case of   0 the solution is the same as that of the Simple Model
In the case of a model without outow but inow of primordial gas Zinf  0 occurring at
a rate
with  a positive constant dierent from zero and from 1 the solution is
At  1  Rt
1      111
Again if   0 the solution is the same as that of the Simple Model The case   1 is a
particular one called extreme infall and it has a dierent solution
where   1  1 For a more extensive discussion of these and other analytical solutions see

6 Numerical models
When the stellar lifetimes are correctly taken into account the chemical evolution equations
should be solved numerically This allows us to follow in detail the temporal evolution of the
abundances of single elements
A complete chemical evolution model in the presence of both galactic wind gas infall and
radial ows can be described by a number of equations equal to the number of chemical species
in particular if Mi is the mass of the gas in the form of any chemical element i we can write
the following set of integer-dierential equations which can be solved only numerically if IRA
is relaxed
t  mQmit  mmdm 
Mit  tXit  Z MBm
AB Z MBM
mZ 05
1  ABZ MBM
f Bt  m2Qmit  m2dBdm 
t  mQmit  mmdm 
t  mQmit  mmdm  XiAtAt
XitW t  XitIt
where Mi can be substituted by i namely the surface gas density of the element i In several
models of chemical evolution it is customarily to use normalized variables which should be
substituted to Mit or to it such as for example
Git 
tottG
MtottG
with it  Xitgast and tottG MtottG being the total surface mass density mass
at the present time tG The surface densities are more indicated for computing the chemical
evolution of galactic disks while for spheroids one can use the masses The quantity Xit 
gast  Mit
Mgast represents the abundance by mass of the element i and by denition the
summation over all the mass abundances of the elements present in the gas mixture is equal to
unity These equations include the products from Type Ia SNe third term on the right and the
products of stars ending their lives as white dwarfs and core-collapse SNe for a more extensive
description of the equations see Matteucci 2012
7 Some highlights
In this section we will illustrate some examples where predictions from chemical evolution models
are compared to observations
71 The chemical evolution of the Milky Way
We will start with the Milky Way which is the galaxy for which we possess the majority of
information A good model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way should reproduce several
FeH1 relations
constraints including the G-dwarf metallicity distribution the XFe vs
where X is a generic element from carbon up to the heaviest ones abundance and gas gradients
along the Galactic disk among others
In Figure 2 we show the predictions from Romano et al 2010 concerning several chemical
elements obtained by using dierent sets of stellar yields and compared to observation in stars
As one can see the agreement is good for some chemical species whereas for others the agreement
is still very poor The reason for that probably resides in the uncertainties still existing in the
theoretical stellar yields The shapes of the XFe vs
FeH relation can be successfully
interpreted as due to the time-delay model namely the fact that elements such as C N and
Fe are mainly produced by long living stars while others such as -elements O Mg Si Ca
are produced by short living stars In particular Fe is mainly produced by Type Ia SNe and
only a small fraction of it originates in core-collapse CC SNe Type I a SNe explode on longer
1 FeH logF eH  logF eH
timescales than core-collapse SNe and therefore ratios such as Fe  where  indicates -
elements which are mainly produced in CC SNe can be used as cosmic clocks The higher than
solar value of the Fe ratios for low FeH values is then due to the CC SNe which restore the
-elements on short timescales When Type Ia SNe originating from CO white dwarfs which
have longer lifetimes from 30 Myr up to a Hubble time start restoring the bulk of Fe then the
Fe ratios start decreasing By means of the time-delay model we can interpret any abundace

model predictions and observa-
tioons The two sets of models re-

sive stars and van den Hoek and

yields of Kobayashi et al 2006 for
massive stars Karakas 2010 for
low and intermediate masses and
for CNO elements the yields of the
Geneva group with mass loss and
rotation Figure from Romano et
al 2010
The model underlying the predictions of Figure 2 is an updated version of the two-infall
model by Chiappini et al 1997 this model assumes that the Milky Way formed by means of
two main gas accretion episodes one during which the halo and thick disk formed and another
during which the thin disk formed on much longer timescales
72 The Li-problem
In Figure 3 we show an illustration of the so-called Li-problem In particular we report the
abundance of 7Li ALi  12 logLiH versus FeH The data sources are indicated inside
the Figure The upper envelope of the data should represent the evolution of the abundance of
7Li in the ISM since the stars in the upper envelope should exhibit the Li abundance present
in the gas when they formed The stars below should instead have consumed the original Li
which is very fragile and tends to react with protons to form 4He when the temperature is
 28  106 K According to this interpretation of the diagram the younger stars with higher
FeH should reect the fact that the Li abundance has increased with galactic lifetime owing
to Li stellar production by stars Stars which can create preserve and eject Li into the ISM
are low and intermediate mass stars during the asymptotic giant branch AGB phase the CC
SNe cosmic rays and perhaps novae see Izzo et al 2015 for the possible detection of Li in
a nova The Li problem arises from the fact that both WMAP and Planck experiments have
derived a primordial 7Li abundance higher than the abundance found in the upper envelope of
the Galactic halo stars those with FeH -10 in Figure 3 This could mean that the oldest
Galactic stars have consumed their primordial Li and roughly by the same amount for stars in
the range -30  -10 in FeH the so-called Spite plateau The lines in Figure 3 represent the
predictions of a chemical evolution model the two-infall model including SNe novae cosmic
rays and AGB stars as Li producers and starting from the primordial Li abundance deduced
either by WMAP or by the value of the Spite plateau There is not yet a solution for the
Li-problem

73 The Ultra-Faint Dwarfs UFDs
In Figure 4 we show the model predictions and data for the UFD galaxy Hercules a small
with stellar mass of  107M satellite of the Milky Way The data refer to the CaFe ratios
measured in the stars of this galaxy and include also the data for Ca in the Milky Way and dwarf
spheroidal stars The data show that the Milky Way and Hercules evolved in a dierent way
since the CaFe ratios are lower at the same FeH in the UFD galaxy relative to the Milky
Way The models computed with an eciency of star formation one thousand times lower than
assumed for the Milky Way can well reproduce the trend The model for Hercules includes also
a strong galactic wind proportional to the SFR Because of the already mentioned time-delay
model the Fe delayed production coupled with a regime of slow star formation predict that the
CaFe ratios are lower at the same FeH since when the Type Ia SNe start to be important in
producing Fe the Ca and the other metals produced by CC SNe have not yet attained the same
abundances as in the Miilky Way which evolves with a much faster star formation Therefore
in order to interpret the abundance patterns in galaxies we should consider the history of star
formation since it aects strongly the shape of the XFe vs FeH relations In this way we
can reconstruct the history of stars formation in galaxies just by looking at their abundances
This approach is known as astroarchaeological approach From Figure 4 it apprears that the
dwarf spheroidals have a higher star formation eciency than the UFDs but a lower one than
the Milky Way From this Figure it is dicult to conclude that stars of the UFDs could have
been the building blocks of the Galactic halo but more data on UFDs are necessary before
drawing rm conclusions on this point
