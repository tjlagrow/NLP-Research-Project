Abstract
of high redshift far-infrared luminous galaxies selected through their observed-
frame submillimeter emission
Introduction
The rst high-redshift galaxies identied from their restframe far-infrared emis-
sion were detected in 1997 using the SCUBA submillimeter camera on the
JCMT There are now a few hundred such sources identied by SCUBA at
850m and at  1100m using MAMBO on the IRAM 30-m Bolocam on the
Caltech Submillimeter Observatory and recently with AzTEC on the JCMT
To begin with we need to decide what is a submillimeter galaxy Clearly
all extragalactic sources emit some radiation in the submillimeter waveband yet
sensibly we wouldnt dene them all as submillimeter galaxies So for simplic-
ity we take a submillimeter galaxy to be a system where the luminosity emitted
in the submillimeter waveband corresponding to the restframe far-infrared for
high-redshift galaxies is a very signicant fraction of the total luminosity
As a benchmark we note that a source with an observed 850-m ux of
 5 mJy corresponds to a UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy ULIRG with an
infrared luminosity of LI R  7  1012L if it has a canonical dust temperature
of Td  40 K and dust emissivity   15 and lies at z  16 the negative
K correction at 850m results in an almost constant apparent uxluminosity
relation over this redshift range Even if such a system had a restframe opti-
cal luminosity comparable to a present-day L galaxy the far-infrared emission
would still account for  90 of the bolometric emission Thus as we will see
the denition of a submillimeter galaxy essentially corresponds to those systems
which are detectable with current submillimeter and millimeter cameras
In the future the collecting area and resolution of ALMA will enable us to
detect large numbers of very much less luminous submillimeter sources  but
most of these will correspond to the far-infrared emission from normal galax-
ies rather than the far-infrared-dominated submillimeter galaxy population
discussed here Equally it can be seen that using this denition of a submil-
limeter galaxy means that understanding the energy source responsible for the
submillimeter emission is crucial for understanding their total energetics
Having made this denition our rst step in understanding what submil-
limeter galaxies are is to construct their number counts Even with the handful
of sources detected in the initial two maps it was clear that the number counts

The cumulative number counts of submillimeter sources detected
Figure 1
at 850m adapted from a recent compilation by Borys et al 2003 The
bright counts come from the HDF Supermap of Borys et al 2003 2004
and the faint counts are from the lens survey of Smail et al 2002 As the
counts are cumulative the data points are correlated and the error-bars are
simply Poisson and so they are likely to underestimate the uctuations in
number counts due to clustering The solid line is the two-power-law count
model of Borys et al 2003 and the dot-dashed line is the predicted number
counts based on an unevolving luminosity function for submillimeter galaxies
derived from IRAS  which falls two to three orders of magnitude short of the
observed surface density We also show as a thick dashed line an evolutionary
model which gave the best-t to the rst number counts of the submillimeter
population from Smail et al 1997 This invokes luminosity evolution of
the local IRAS population increasing as 1  z3 to z  26  close to the
behaviour now believed to best explain this population Chapman et al 2005
of these sources are far in excess of those predicted assuming no-evolution of the
local far-infrared luminosity function Fig 1 Smail et al 1997 Robust counts
can now be constructed from a combination of wideshallow eg Borys et al
2003 or the recently-nished SHADES survey Mortier et al 2005 Coppin et al
2006 Ivison et al 2006 and deepnarrow surveys eg Hughes et al 1998 Blain
et al 1999a Cowie et al 2002 Knudsen et al 2006 with the deepest of the
latter exploiting the amplication by gravitational lensing from massive galaxy
clusters to probe beyond the confusion limit the 850-m confusion limit of the
JCMT is  2 mJy As Fig 1 demonstrates the number densities at a few mJy
are some three orders of magnitude above the no-evolution predictions Such
an excess suggests very strong redshift evolution in this population Blain et al
1999b As Chapman et al 2003a 2005 see 2 demonstrate the majority of
these sources lie at high-redshifts and hence based on their apparent submillime-
ter uxes they are ULIRGs a population which contributes a negligible fraction
 1 of the total luminosity density at the present-day Takeuchi et al 2005
Yet the strong evolution in the submillimeter number counts shows that simi-
larly far-infrared-bright galaxies must be a much more important component of
the galaxy population at high redshifts
The submillimeter counts from current surveys cover only a narrow range
in ux a mere two decades from  20 mJy down to  02 mJy Fig 1 These
cumulative counts hint at a change in the slope somewhere in the range  2
Submillimeter Galaxies
5 mJy with a shallower slope at fainter uxes This roughly corresponds to
the confusion limit of blank-eld maps and raises the concern that this feature
arises from problems matching the blank eld and lens survey results We note
that similar problems do not occur in surveys of Extremely Red Objects using
identically-constructed lens models Smith et al 2002 McCarthy 2004 and so
this feature is probably real The change in slope in the integrated submillimeter
counts indicates an even sharper break exists in the dierential counts  with
a very strong attening of the counts below  3 mJy This behaviour suggests
a potential dierence in the nature of the submillimeter galaxy population at
the sub-mJy and mJy levels Indeed the form of the cumulative counts is even
consistent with a peak in the dierential counts at uxes around 25 mJy which
might have bearing on the suggestion that there is a dearth of high-redshift
sources with submillimeter uxes of a few mJy Pope et al 2005
One reason for believing the break is real is that there must be a attening
in the slope of the counts at faint uxes if their integrated ux density is to
remain consistent with the total ux in the submillimeter background measured
by COBE The deepest counts adopting the shallow slope in Fig 1 suggest that
up to 80 of the background may already be resolved by  05 mJy Smail et al
2002 leaving little opportunity for increasing the number counts at this depth
More importantly this result demonstrates that the bulk of the submillimeter
background arises from galaxies where the far-infrared emission is likely to be
either bolometrically dominant or at the least very important  justifying the
denition of a submillimeter galaxy as an unique and important population
2 Redshifts for Submillimeter Galaxies
Having determined the surface density of submillimeter galaxies and their con-
tribution to the background at this wavelength the next questions which arise
are i what are their redshifts ii what are their dynamical and stellar masses
iii what are their power sources
It was clear from the earliest identication of submillimeter sources that
determining the correct counterparts in the opticalnear-infrared was going to
be the rate-limiting step in making progress on the question of their redshift
distribution Barger et al 1999 The rst and so-far most successful approach
has been to identify counterparts in the radio waveband Ivison et al 1998 Smail
et al 2000 This relies on the observationally well determined far-infraredradio
correlation for star-forming galaxies Helou et al 1985 which implies that almost
all bright  5 mJy at 850-m submillimeter galaxies at z  34 will show radio
counterparts brighter than a few Jy at 14 GHz Chapman et al 2001 There
are two drawbacks with this technique i sensitivities of a few Jy are dicult
to achieve with the VLA  with typical 4- limits more usually being a few 10s
Jy eg Ivison et al 2002 and ii that some fraction of submillimeter sources
could lie at very high redshifts z  3 and will be missed in the radio due to
the dierence in the K corrections in the radio and submillimeter Fig 2
Both of these problems are shared to various degrees with the other main
technique used to identify the counterparts to submillimeter sources using ex-
treme or unusual colors in the optical near-infrared or mid-infrared Smail et
al 1999 2002 Webb et al 2003 Pope et al 2006 For this reason the identi-
cation rates for any individual technique is rarely better than  7080 with

millimeter galaxies from Chapman et al 2005 showing a sharply peaked
distribution with a median redshift of z  22  05 and a tail out to z  36
The solid curve shows an evolutionary model from Blain et al 2002 which
describes our best estimate of the redshift distribution of the full  5 mJy sub-
millimeter galaxy population There are two dierences between this and the
measured distribution which reect the sample selection Firstly the dashed
curve illustrates the likely selection boundary for our radio ux limit of 30Jy
using a family of spectral energy distributions SEDs tuned to reproduce
the distribution of submillimeter to radio ux limits Chapman et al 2003b
2005 The horizontal shaded region between this and the submillimeter sam-
ple curve represents those  30 of submillimeter sources which are below
our radio detection limit these lie predominantly at z  25 The sample also
suers some spectroscopic incompleteness vertical shading at z  15 due
to the dearth of strong features in the bandpass of the spectrograph
signicant overlap between the identied sources leaving open the possibility of
a tail of high redshift sources Aretxaga et al 2003 However we also have to
recognise the low-signicance of the typical sources in submillimeter catalogs 3
4 which may mean that some fraction most of the unidentied sources are
simply spurious thus reducing the number of potentially high redshift sources
Greve et al 2004
The physical basis for the radio-identication route is the most robust of
any of the approaches relying on the direct link between the activity powering
the submillimeter and radio emission it therefore unequivocally provides the po-
sition of the submillimeter source In contrast it is dicult without additional
observations to prove that the photometric identications techniques are doing
anything more than nding galaxies which are associated with the submillimeter
source  but are not coincident with it This distinction is important when we
try to investigate their physical properties in detail
Chapman et al 2003a 2005 present the results of the rst large-scale
redshift survey of submillimeter galaxies This survey uses radio counterparts
to localise the submillimeter source with subsequent optical spectroscopy using
the LRIS spectrograph on Keck Radio counterparts are detectable for  70
of submillimeter sources at the depth of this survey  5 mJy Ivison et al
2002 with the subsequent spectroscopy being roughly  75 complete due
Submillimeter Galaxies
to the high frequency of strong emission lines in the restframe UV spectra of
submillimeter galaxies The median redshift for the 73 galaxies in the nal
sample is z  22 with a distribution which is well-described by the expected
selection function Fig 2 On the basis of this we expect that the underlying
submillimeter population has a median of z  23 Chapman et al 2005
With precise redshifts for these submillimeter sources we can use their mea-
sured 850-m and 14-GHz uxes along with the far-infraredradio correlation
to derive their characteristic dust temperatures and bolometric luminosities We
have conrmed the reliability of these estimates using 350 m observations of a
subset of the sources with SHARC-2 on the CSO Kovacs et al 2006 The
typical submillimeter galaxy in the Chapman et al 2005 sample has a infrared
luminosity of LI R  8  1012L and a temperature of Td  38 K The ux limit
of the radio data means we start to miss the cooler sources at z  25 and can
detect only the hottest sources Td  45 K at z  3 Hence of the  30 of
the  5 mJy submillimeter population which lack radio counterparts brighter
than  30Jy we expect that roughly half lie within our sample volume but
are slightly colder than our typical galaxy and the other half are comparable
sources at somewhat higher redshifts  meaning  10 of bright submillimeter
galaxies are likely to be at z  3 A recent analysis of submillimeter sources in
the GOODS-N using photometric identications conrms this  indicating that
the radio-identied submillimeter sample is representative of the bulk of the
population Pope et al this volume but see also Knudsen et al this volume
In part this may explain the modest overlap between submillimeter galaxies and
Lyman-break galaxies at z  3 Chapman et al 2000
3 The Astrophysics of Submillimeter Galaxies
Masses The critical advantage of the submillimeter sample from Chapman
et al 2005 is the availability of precise and unambiguous redshifts for these
galaxies To gauge the dynamical properties of submillimeter galaxies we use
observations of the H emission line  which is bright and relatively unaected
by the obscuration in these dusty galaxies The complication is that at the red-
shifts of the submillimeter galaxies the H emission line is redshifted in to the
near-infrared H- or K-bands The combination of limited wavelength coverage
of typical spectrographs and high backgrounds then make blind searches for H
emission from submillimeter galaxies observationally challenging eg Simpson
et al 2004 Nevertheless with precise UV redshifts for a large sample of bright
submillimeter galaxies it is possible to eciently target their H emission us-
ing both long-slit observations Swinbank et al 2004 as well as more powerful
integral-eld studies Swinbank et al 2005 2006 These observations give both
estimates of the line width from individual sources and the relative velocities
between components frequently seen in these merging systems These provide
rough estimates of the masses within the central  10 kpc of a typical submil-
limeter galaxy of  2  1011M Swinbank et al 2004 2006 These are some
of the most massive galaxies present at z  23
These mass estimates are conrmed by observations of the dynamics of
the cold gas within the systems  through its CO emission in the millimeter
waveband Greve et al 2005 Tacconi et al 2006 The relatively narrow-band
widths of correlators on millimeter interferometers means that this test can

The combined restframe X-ray spectra for three samples of sub-
millimeter galaxies using data from the 2-Ms Chandra observations of the
CDF-N from Alexander et al 2005b The galaxies have been grouped ac-
cording to their X-ray colors used to infer their likely absorbtion NHI 
1023 151023 and  5  1023 and then coadded  yielding spectra with
cumulative integration times of 12 Ms each The spectra show the Fe K
emission line and have continuum slopes which are well-described by models
of absorbed AGN overplotted lines giving us condence that the estimates
of the HI columns are reliable These can then be used to correct the observed
X-ray luminosities of the AGN to determine their intrinsic luminosities
only be applied where we have very precise redshifts The CO observations
also constrain the gas mass of the systems  showing that roughly 25 of the
dynamical mass in this region is contributed by the cold gas
To determine what the total mass of baryons is within these galaxies we
need to add the contribution from stars to that measured from the gas We
can do this by using the near- or mid-infrared observations to estimate the
restframe V - or K-band luminosities and then adopt ML appropriate to their
stellar populations to convert these to masses Smail et al 2004 used IJ K
photometry to derive a median reddening-corrected V -band luminosity of 2 
1011L assuming a reddening of AV  25 consistent with the restframe optical
colors from a large sample of submillimeter galaxies Adopting an MLV  015
typical of a  100s Myr-old starburst then gives a stellar mass of M  3 
1010M  similar to the cold gas masses  but with a considerable uncertainty
These estimates are very sensitive to the adopted reddening and the age of the
stellar population For that reason it is preferable to use the restframe near-
infrared luminosity of the galaxies accessible through mid-infrared observations
with IRAC on-board Spitzer Borys et al 2005 presented such an analysis
for a smaller sample of submillimeter galaxies in the GOODS-N  obtaining
signicantly higher masses  2  1011M This implies that the majority of the
mass in the central regions of submillimeter galaxies is in baryons as is the case
for the similar regions of massive local elliptical galaxies Conrmation of this
result using more detailed modelling of a larger mid-infrared sample is urgently
needed Unfortunately the complex mix of obscuration and contributions from
stellar and non-thermal emission make this a challenging problem
Submillimeter Galaxies
Power source The typical bolometric luminosity of a submillimeter galaxy
from the Chapman et al 2005 sample 8  1012L corresponds to an immense
star formation rate of 01100 M stars  2103 M yr1 adopting a Salpeter
initial mass function The restframe far-infrared luminosity is dominated by
the most massive stars and hence it is fairer to set a rm lower limit to the star
formation rate of  300 M yr1 counting only those stars more massive than
 5 M However this is only a true if the bulk of the far-infrared emission
is powered by star formation Similarly the conversion in the previous section
of the restframe opticalnear-infrared luminosities to yield stellar masses also
implicitly assume that the bulk of the continuum emission in these bands comes
from stars Borys et al 2005 demonstrate that this is a reasonable assumption
for the restframe near-infrared emission in  75 of submillimeter sources
There is clear evidence though that many submillimeter galaxies host ac-
tive galactic nuclei AGN from either their UV or restframe optical spectra
Chapman et al 2005 Swinbank et al 2004 Is it possible that these AGN are
signicant contributors to the immense bolometric luminosities reducing the
need for extreme star formation rates in these galaxies
The most reliable tracer of the intrinsic luminosity of the AGNs in these
galaxies is their hard X-ray emission In particular for the spectroscopically-
identied submillimeter galaxies in the CDF-N we can exploit the unparalleled
depth of the 2-Ms Chandra X-ray observations Alexander et al 2003 to con-
strain their X-ray luminosities Alexander et al 2005a present the X-ray prop-
erties of these submillimeter galaxies showing that their rate of detection in the
X-ray waveband 70 have counterparts is signicantly higher than any other
known z  2 galaxy population indicating a close link between the far-infrared
activity and AGN fueling and hence supermassive black hole SMBH growth
in these systems Building upon this result Alexander et al 2005b construct
restframe X-ray spectra for subsamples of the submillimeter galaxies classied on
the basis of their X-ray colors Fig 3 which demonstrate that the X-ray emis-
sion from these galaxies is well-described by moderately absorbed power-law
spectra logNHI  2224 Correcting the observed X-ray luminosities for this
absorbtion indicates intrinsic luminosities of LX058 keV  6  1043 erg s1
Assuming a standard bolometric correction for QSOs Elvis et al 1994 this
corresponds to a bolometric luminosity of the AGN of 3  1011L or just  4
of the total luminosity of these galaxies Thus the X-ray observations conrm
that the bulk of the far-infrared emission from submillimeter galaxies arises from
star formation at rates of 100s to 1000s M yr1
4 Conclusions
Submillimeter galaxies with uxes of a few mJy appear to be uniquely associated
with the most active phase of galaxy formation in the history of the Universe
A spectroscopic survey of an unambiguously located sample of submillimeter
sources shows that their median redshift is z  23 While these galaxies fre-
quently have an active nucleus or two Alexander et al 2003 a detailed X-ray
analysis indicates that these AGN likely contribute  10 of the bolometric
emission  the remainder is powered by star formation The precise redshifts
for this sample have also allowed us to use other tools to study their dynamics

dominated with signicant stellar and gas masses
