ABSTRACT
We present deep wide-eld Ks-band observations of six Hyperluminous Infrared Galax-
ies HLIRGs spanning a redshift range 044  z  155 The sample resides in a wide
variety of environments from the eld to Abell 2 clusters with a mean galaxy-HLIRG
clustering amplitude of hBghi  190  45Mpc177 The range in environments and the
mean clustering level are both greater than those seen in local IR-luminous galaxies
from which we infer that the range of galaxy evolution processes driving IR-luminous
galaxy evolution at z  05 is greater than locally and includes mergers between gas-
rich spiral galaxies in the eld but also includes encounters in clusters and hierarchical
buildup The similarity in the range of environments and mean clustering amplitude
between our sample and QSOs over a similar redshift range is consistent with the in-
terpretation where evolutionary connections between IR-luminous galaxies and QSOs
are stronger at z  05 than locally and that at these redshifts the processes that
drive QSO evolution are similar to those that drive IR-luminous galaxy evolution
From comparison of the HLIRG and QSO host galaxies we further postulate that a
larger fraction of IR-luminous galaxies pass through an optical QSO stage at z  05
than locally

INTRODUCTION
Since the discovery by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite
IRAS in 1983 of a large population of galaxies with sig-
nicant infrared IR emission substantial eort has been
expended on understanding the nature of the most luminous
end of this IR galaxy population These sources termed
Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies ULIRGs if their IR lu-
minosity exceeds 1012L and HLIRGs if their IR lumi-
nosity exceeds 1013L are found over a very wide range
in redshift with most lying at z  01 Soifer et al 1984
Saunders et al 2000 but with a signicant number lying in
the range 01  z  04 and a few lying at higher red-
shifts Although the consensus is now that ULIRGs and
HLIRGs are powered by some combination of violent star
formation and black hole accretion surrounded by large

masses of gas and dust the triggers for this activity and
how these galaxies evolve are not known Locally ULIRGs
are thought to be mergers between two or more gas-rich
spiral galaxies taking place almost exclusively in poor en-
vironments and that a small number of these ULIRGs
evolve into optically selected QSOs Soifer et al 1984

1999 Farrah et al 2001 Bushouse et al 2002 Tacconi et al
2002 Farrah et al 2003 At higher redshifts however the
picture is less clear It has been suggested that a greater va-
riety of galaxy formation processes may play a role amongst
ULIRGs and HLIRGs at high redshift Farrah et al 2002b
a change which may manifest itself in their environments
The Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxies HLIRGs which
generally lie at z  03 have been studied extensively
since their discovery motivated by their extreme lumi-
nosities which make them amongst the most luminous
objects in the Universe The rst HLIRG to be found

These objects appeared to presage a new class of infrared
galaxy
Later observations of larger samples of HLIRGs uncov-
ered a more detailed picture Hubble Space Telescope HST
imaging Farrah et al 2002a revealed that a wide range of
morphologies are present in the HLIRG population from
merging systems to QSOs in apparently relaxed systems X-
ray IR and sub-millimetre observations showed that in all
cases HLIRGs are powered by a mixture of dust-enshrouded
black hole accretion and violent star formation with inferred
star formation rates of  500Myr1 Rowan-Robinson
2000 Verma et al 2002 Farrah et al 2002b Wilman et al
2003 suggesting that HLIRGs are comprised of both merg-
ers between gas-rich spiral galaxies and young galaxies go-
ing through their maximal star formation epochs whilst har-
bouring an AGN
Despite this progress the role of HLIRGs in the broader
picture of galaxy and AGN evolution remains unclear It
is not known whether HLIRGs as a class are a simple ex-
trapolation of the local Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies
ULIRGs Lir  1012L making them mostly mergers be-
tween gas-rich spirals or whether a wider range of galaxy
formation processes play a role in HLIRG evolution Also
the links between HLIRGs and QSOs at comparable red-
shifts are not well understood Locally it is thought that
some fraction of ULIRGs evolve into optically selected QSOs
Sanders et al 1988 Farrah et al 2001 Tacconi et al 2002
but it is not known whether this is also true in the distant
Universe
Many of these unknowns result from two major ob-
stacles in studying HLIRG evolution Firstly HLIRGs con-
tain very large masses of gas and dust making observations
of the galaxies themselves at all wavelengths except per-
haps the far-infrared and sub-millimetre prone to obscu-
ration bias Secondly the presence of a luminous starburst
and AGN in all HLIRGs means that observations will be
aected by the orientation of the HLIRG relative to us
These problems can however be partly overcome by exam-
ining the environments of HLIRGs Since the determina-
tion of environments is independent of orientation and dust
content they are a useful tool in studying AGN evolution
and have been used extensively in studying both normal
and active galaxies Longair  Seldner 1979 Yee  Green

help clarify the relations between HLIRGs and other AGN
classes
In this paper we investigate the environments of six
HLIRGs using deep wide eld Ks-band imaging Observa-
tions are described in 2 and analysis is described in 3 Re-
sults are presented in 4 with discussion in 5 Finally our
conclusions are summarized in 6 Unless otherwise stated
we assume   07 0  03 and H0  70 km s1 Mpc1
2 OBSERVATIONS
We selected for observation six HLIRGs from the sample pre-
sented by Rowan-Robinson 2000 The sample their red-
shifts and other basic data are presented in Table 1 Five
of these objects were selected to lie approximately in the
redshift range 06  z  16 where the greatest evolu-
tion in the IR galaxy population is thought to occur eg
Rowan-Robinson et al 1997 Additionally we observed
one further HLIRG P091044109 which lies at z  044
and is already known to lie in a rich cluster to act as a con-
trol for our observation and analysis methods though we do
not include this source in the discussion None of our targets
show any evidence for signicant gravitational lensing
Observations were made on 25-26th December 2001 us-
ing the INGRID wide eld near-infrared imager and a Ks-
band lter on the 42m William Hershel Telescope WHT
INGRID is a 1024  1024 pixel array with a scale of 0238
pix1 corresponding to a eld-of-view of  172 At the red-
shifts of our sample this corresponds to a physical eld-of-
view of  136Mpc The targets were centred approximately
in the INGRID eld-of-view with exposure times selected
to reach a minimum depth of M 
Ks 2 at the redshift of each
object Observing conditions were generally good with little
cloud cover and seeing of  08 however the atmospheric
stability was variable resulting in non-photometric nights
The environments of hyperluminous infrared galaxies at 044  z  155
The total exposure time for each object was divided into
several nine point box dither patterns with a 167 oset
between each position to allow the subtraction of cosmic
rays hot pixels and the infrared sky background As the
INGRID eld of view is too small to reliably estimate eld
galaxy counts from the edges of the HLIRG elds separate
control elds were also observed with similar galactic lat-
itudes and exposure times as the sample For photometric
calibration we observed a selection of infrared standard stars
throughout each night at several dierent airmasses
3 DATA REDUCTION
Following debiasing and atelding the data were reduced
using our own custom-written IRAF pipeline based in part
on the Quicklook INGRID data reduction pipeline from the
Isaac Newton Group ING As the exposure time at each
position in the dither pattern was only 30 seconds partic-
ular care was taken in accounting for bright sources when
subtracting sky noise Source masks were created for the
individual frames in each dither pattern by rst creating
an approximate estimate of the sky by median combining
the nine frames in each dither pattern without applying the
dither osets This dummy sky frame was then subtracted
from each frame in the dither pattern to reveal the brightest
sources which were then masked out when creating the real
sky frame The nine frames in each dither pattern were com-
bined using the IRAF task IMCOMBINE with dither osets
calculated by centroiding two or more bright sources com-
mon to each frame After each dither pattern was combined
into a single image sky subtraction was performed using
the real sky frames and pixel masks described earlier It
was found that this sky subtraction method worked well in
dealing with variations in the infrared sky between dierent
dither patterns over the long exposure time for each object
The combined images from each dither pattern were then
stacked together to produce a nal image I
I  Picid0Ii2
i cid1
Pi 2
where Ii and i are the individual images from each dither
pattern and their standard deviations respectively The
standard deviations were derived from the noise uctuations
in each image Noisy edges where the total exposure times
were shorter due to the dither pattern were clipped o
The resulting eld of view at 13  13 was still sucient to
quantify the environments of the sample The nal images
were of excellent quality and at to better than 1 across
the width of the frame and were in all cases of much higher
quality than the images from the Quicklook reduction Our
reduction pipeline INREP is available for general use via
the Isaac Newton Group ING web pages 1
Sources were extracted and catalogued using the SEx-
tractor package Bertin  Arnouts 1996 For source extrac-
tion we adopted the conservative criterion that a source con-
stitutes at least four contiguous pixels with a signicance of
detection of at least 3 above the background The default
SExtractor extraction lter was used to detect faint extended
1 httpingiacesAstronomyIngrid
objects with 32 de-blending thresholds a cleaning eciency
of 1 and a contrast parameter of 0005 The background es-
timation was mesh based with a mesh size of 64 and a lter
size of 3 As many of the sources in the frames were faint
and slightly extended the magnitudes were calculated using
corrected isophotal ISOCOR magnitudes within SExtrac-
tor The calibration zeropoint magnitudes for each object
frame and control frame were calculated using the observa-
tions of the infrared standard stars The errors on the nal
magnitudes arising from the standard star calibrations are
m  005 with a further error of m  005 from the
source extraction To correct our measured magnitudes to
the rest-frame Ks-band we computed k-corrections assum-
ing a standard power law with   2
4 ANALYSIS
To evaluate the environmental richness of each object in
our sample we use two independent clustering measures the
Bgg galaxy-galaxy correlation statistic Longair  Seldner
1979 which for our sample we refer to as the Bgh
galaxy-HLIRG correlation statistic and the N05 statistic
Hill  Lilly 1991 The Bgh statistic is the amplitude of
the spatial cross-correlation function and relies on knowing
the volume density of galaxies around the HLIRG which it-
self requires knowledge of the luminosity function LF The
N05 statistic is a simple more direct counting statistic and
involves counting all the sources within 05Mpc of the target
that lie within a certain magnitude range Although the Bgh
statistic is physically more meaningful than the N05 statis-
tic the near-infrared luminosity function is not known with
great precision at high redshifts Therefore we have adopted
the Bgh statistic as our primary measure of environmental
richness but we also use the N05 statistic as an independent
To compute the Bgh statistic we follow the prescription
of Longair  Seldner 1979 As this statistic is not trivial to
evaluate we provide a detailed outline of the procedure here
The spatial cross-correlation function r can be described
as a simple power law
r  Bghr
and is derived from the galaxy-HLIRG angular cross-
correlation function w
w  Agh1
by deprojecting from the celestial sphere The amplitude of
the angular cross-correlation function Agh is essentially the
richness measure of the number of galaxies about a point on
the sky and is converted to Bgh the richness measure of the
number of galaxies about a point in space by translating the
angular cross-correlation function w to the spatial cross-
correlation function r
To perform this conversion the Agh statistic is evalu-

where NT is the total number of galaxies within a radius
 around the target corresponding to 05 Mpc at the tar-
get redshift and NB is the number of galaxies within the

For the parameters used in the LF we use the most recent
determination of the high redshift near-IR LFs as given by
Pozzetti et al 2003 who have determined the evolution of
the near-IR LF in the J- and Ks-bands in redshift bins of
z  h020 065i and z  h075 130i using a spectroscopic
survey of a magnitude limited sample of galaxies with Ks 
20 In terms of absolute magnitudes the luminosity function
can be expressed as
M   Cf M 1 expf M 
where the constant C  04 ln10 and
f M   1004M M  
As some of the galaxies in our sample lie outside of the
redshift bins given by Pozzetti et al 2003 we must make
assumptions as to the nature of the LF at these magnitudes
In the redshift range 02  z  065 we have assumed  
125 M   2564 and   611  104Mpc3 In the
redshift range 075  z  155 we have assumed   098
M   2554 and   998  104Mpc3 We note that
Pozzetti et al 2003 nd only mild evolution in the Ks-band
luminosity function over the redshift range 0  z  13
hence our use of their luminosity function at z  155 is
unlikely to be a major source of error

prescription given by Yee  Lopez-Cruz 1999

which is based only upon non-Poissonian counting statis-
tics Other systematic errors are discussed in 52
To compute the N05 statistic we follow the procedure
described by Hill  Lilly 1991 This statistic is computed
by counting all sources within a 05 Mpc radius of the tar-
get with a magnitude in the interval hm m  3i where m
is the magnitude of the target Subtracted from this number
is the expected number of background eld galaxies in the
same magnitude interval calculated from the control elds
The resulting number is the N05 statistic This measure-
ment does not require integration of a luminosity function
although if the luminosities of HLIRGs and cluster galaxies
evolve very dierently with redshift then the N05 statistic
will give inaccurate results There is no evidence why this
should be a major eect however so we do not take it into ac-
count From Table 1 the limiting magnitude for each object
is fainter than mHLIRG  3 except for two cases the image
for F101191429 reaches mHLIRG  218 and the image for
F142183845 reaches mHLIRG  294 In both these cases
however the limiting depth is suciently near mHLIRG  3
that the N05 statistic is still usable
5 RESULTS
51 Clustering statistics
Images of the elds around each HLIRG are presented in
Figure 1 In Figure 2 we plot the galaxy counts in a 05Mpc
region around each HLIRG and the counts for the asso-
ciated control eld The Bgh and N05 statistics for each
object and their errors are given in Table 2 We also quote
the approximate Abell classes of our sample in this table
based on the conversions given by Hill  Lilly 1991 in
our cosmology We note however that these conversions are
arbitrary and hence we base our quoted Abell classes on
both the Bgh and N05 statistics
A wide variety of environments can be seen amongst

1993 For the remaining objects three reside in poor en-
vironments and two F100264949 and F101191429 re-
side in clusters of Abell class 1 and 0 respectively though
we note that the detection of clustering for F101191429
is marginal at  25 Excluding P091044109 the error
weighted mean clustering amplitude for the remaining 5 ob-
jects is hBghi  190  45Mpc177
We can compare the values of N05 and Bgh to each
other as these quantities have been used by many previous
authors and a well dened relation has been found between
them Hill  Lilly 1991 derive Bgh  30N05 In Figure 3
we plot this relation together with Bgh vs N05 for the
objects in our sample and the conversions between Bgh
and Abell class given by Hill  Lilly 1991 We also plot
the best t linear relation between Bgh and N05 for our
data The best t is well matched to the relation derived
by Hill  Lilly 1991 and the objects in the sample follow
this relation closely hence we conclude that our computed
values of N05 and Bgh are reasonable
52 Error budget
The errors quoted in Table 2 for the Bgh and N05 statistics
are only the counting errors and do not include three fur-
ther potentially important sources of error In this section
we discuss these three error sources in turn
The rst of these is the luminosity function assumed
in calculating the Bgh statistic Due to the uncertainties in
the high redshift Ks-band LF used in this paper this is an
important issue to address Yee  Lopez-Cruz 1999 have
examined the sensitivity of Bgh to the form of the LF and
nd that an error in the assumed value of M  of up to
0m5 will still yield essentially the same results Similarly
an error in  of up to 03 will only aect Bgh by at most
 20 Although the K band LF is not well constrained at
the redshifts of our targets we do not expect that the true
LF diers from our assumed LF by such gross margins and
therefore we conclude that uncertainties in our computed
Bgh statistics due to the assumed LF are at most 10
The second of these error sources is the method used to
compare the data to the luminosity function in calculating
the Bgh statistic This can be done in two ways The data
can be k-corrected to the rest-frame Ks-band and compared
to the Ks-band luminosity function given by Pozzetti et al
2003 or the data can be compared directly to the J band
luminosity function presented by Pozzetti et al 2003 with-
out applying a k-correction as observed frame Ks-band ap-
proximately samples rest-frame J band at the redshifts of
our sample Both methods have advantages and disadvan-
tages the rest-frame Ks-band is a less contaminated tracer
of evolved stellar mass than the J band but suers from the
extra uncertainties introduced by applying k-corrections Al-
though we chose to k-correct our data to the rest-frame Ks-
band we also examined the eect of comparing our data di-
rectly to the rest-frame J-band luminosity function without
applying k-corrections We computed Bgh and Bgh with-
out applying k-corrections and using the J-band luminos-
ity function from Pozzetti et al 2003 and found that the
Bgh values were within 1 of the values computed using
k-corrections and the Ks-band luminosity function for all
Figure 3 Bgh vs N05 for our sample Filled hexagons are the
Abell calibrations taken from Hill  Lilly 1991 stars are our

Hill  Lilly 1991 The dashed line is a least squares t of our
data which gives Bgh  2907N05  1495
the objects except F101191429 which was within 15
Furthermore each object still resided within the same type
of environment as before with P091044109 F100264949
and F101191429 residing in clusters with the same signi-
cance of detection of clustering and the other 3 objects lying
in the eld The values of Bgh and Bgh were however in all
cases slightly higher using the J-band luminosity function
and no k-corrections with F100264949 and F101191429
predicted to just lie in Abell 2 clusters We conclude that
using the Ks-band luminosity function with k-corrections
or just the J-band luminosity function will not signicantly
change our results and that our choice of using the Ks-
band luminosity function with k-corrections was the most
conservative
The third of these error sources is the choice of cosmol-
ogy Whilst both Bgh and N05 are relatively insensitive to
the choice of  and 0 the sensitivity to H0 is marked par-
ticularly in the range 65  H0  80 This is illustrated in
Figure 4 where we have plotted Bgh as a function of H0 for
F100264949 By varying H0 over a relatively small range
the eect on Bgh is dramatic changing from Bgh  350 for
H0  65 to Bgh  800 for H0  75 Most current measure-
ments of H0 produce values in the range 70 to 75 albeit
with a signicant error Freedman et al 2001 and refer-
ences therein Our adopted value of H0  70 and therefore
our derived clustering amplitudes are therefore conserva-
In summary we conclude that whilst there are fur-
ther signicant sources of error than the Poisson errors
on the derived clustering statistics none of these sources of
error should signicantly change our results Furthermore
we have in all cases adopted the most conservative method
possible in computing the clustering amplitudes making it

highly unlikely that any of our objects that we infer to lie
in clusters actually reside in the eld
6 DISCUSSION
61 The hyperluminous phenomenon at low and
high redshift
Our sample of ve objects excluding P09104 although
small exhibit a wide variety of environments from poor
environments to Abell  1 clusters This strongly suggests
that there is a wide variety of environments amongst ob-
jects with high levels of IR emission at z  1 generally
although a larger sample would be required to conrm
this This variety of environments is not seen amongst local
ULIRGs which are generally not found in rich environments
Sanders  Mirabel 1996 The mean environmental rich-
ness of our sample at hBghi  190  45Mpc177 is higher at
just over 3 signicance than the galaxy-galaxy correlation
statistic both locally Loveday et al 1995 Guzzo et al 1997
and at moderate redshifts Hudon  Lilly 1996 though we
note that the latter study measured values of Bgg up to red-
shifts of only z  05 We infer that in going from z  0
to z  1 the environments of IR-luminous galaxies become
more diverse and that the mean environment becomes richer
than that of normal galaxies both locally and at moderate
redshifts This is supportive of the idea that a wider va-
riety of galaxy formation processes are important amongst
the IR-luminous galaxy population at high redshift than lo-
cally such as hierarchical buildup or encounters in clusters
Indeed one object in our sample IRAS F100264949 may
be an example of such a galaxy This source harbours both a
starburst and an AGN Farrah et al 2002b and lies in a rich
cluster From HST imaging this source also possesses mul-
tiple very close companions Farrah et al 2002a It is thus
an excellent candidate for being a cD galaxy in the process
of formation in a cluster at z  112 and may be the higher

62 Comparison to Quasar environments
Since environments are independent of orientation we can
compare the environments of our sample to those of other
classes of active galaxies at comparable redshifts to ex-
amine possible relationships between HLIRGs and other
AGN classes The environments of AGN over a wide red-
shift range have been studied by many authors in eorts to
disentangle the myriad AGN taxonomy Radio Loud QSOs
RLQs and Radio Galaxies RGs are found in a diverse
range of environments from the eld to Abell Class 2 and
greater at both low and high redshift Longair  Seldner

all RLQs and RGs appear to prefer moderately rich envi-
ronments on average of around Abell Class 0 Determining
whether or not there is evolution in the environments of
RLQs or RGs with redshift is dicult due to gravitational

lensing and selection biases but from recent results it ap-
pears that there is no signicant dierence in RLQ and RG
environments at z  10 Wold et al 2000 For Radio Quiet
Quasars RQQs a broadly comparable picture has now
emerged RQQs are found in a similarly diverse range of en-
vironments to RLQs from the eld to Abell class 2 or richer
over a wide redshift range Yee  Green 1987 Dunlop et al
1993 Fisher et al 1996 Deltorn et al 1997 Tanaka et al
2000 McLure  Dunlop 2001 Indeed the most recent re-
sults based on deep optical imaging show that the envi-
ronments of RQQs and RLQs at moderate redshifts are
statistically indistinguishable Wold et al 2001 At z  1
there is as yet no clear consensus but the environments of
RLQs and RQQs at these redshifts do not appear to be
signicantly dierent Hintzen Romanishin  Valdes 1991

In the local Universe it was initially suggested that
ULIRGs as a class are precursors to optically selected QSOs
although later results show that this is probably true for
only a small subset of the ULIRG population Sanders et al
1988 Farrah et al 2001 Tacconi et al 2002 This is reected
in their environments as locally ULIRGs and QSOs reside
in dierent environments with ULIRGs generally lying in
the eld and QSOs lying in moderately rich environments
on average with a diverse range We can compare the range
of environments in our sample of HLIRGs to those of QSOs
at comparable redshifts to see if this is also true at high red-
shift The diverse range of environments seen in our sample
of HLIRGs is qualitatively similar to the range seen in RLQs
and RQQs and our mean value for Bgh is comparable to the
mean galaxy-quasar correlation statistic Bgq for RLQs and
RQQs at similar redshifts Wold et al 2000 2001 This is
illustrated in Figure 5 where we plot clustering amplitudes
vs redshifts for our HLIRGs together with a representative
sample of clustering amplitudes for QSOs from the litera-

ture Yee  Ellingson 1993 Hall  Green 1998 Wold et al
2000 2001 converted to our cosmology The error bars on
the QSOs have been intentionally omitted for clarity but
are comparable in size to the error bars on the HLIRGs
We note that the clustering measures were derived using
dierent data with our clustering amplitudes derived from
Ks-band data and the clustering amplitudes from the other
samples derived from multiband optical data however it is
unlikely that this will introduce any systematic biases be-
tween the datasets Therefore we extrapolate from this that
evolutionary links between IR-luminous galaxies and opti-
cally selected QSOs may become stronger with increasing
redshift Furthermore we postulate that at approximately
z  05 the range of galaxy evolution processes driving
IR-luminous galaxy evolution caused by the greater diver-
sity in environments is similar to the range driving QSO
evolution We note that one object in our sample LBQS
12200939 is a QSO from the Large Bright Quasar Survey
Hewett Foltz  Chaee 1995 that was only later discov-
ered to be hyperluminous in the IR the selection criteria
for this object therefore make it unsuitable for determin-
ing evolutionary connections between HLIRGs and QSOs
Even with LBQS 12200939 removed however the sample
still contains the same diverse range of environments and
the mean clustering amplitude is still comparable to that of
QSOs at similar redshifts
We can take this one step further via a comparison
of HLIRG and optically selected QSO host galaxies QSOs
at all redshifts are thought to lie in luminous  L host
galaxies with elliptical hosts becoming more prevalent for
both RLQs and RQQs with increasing optical nuclear lumi-
nosity McLure et al 1999 Percival et al 2001 Dunlop et al
2003 Conversely although local ULIRGs are thought to
evolve into ellipticals with a few also passing though a QSO
phase are thought to be mergers between optically sub-
L galaxies with the majority of ULIRGs themselves also
being sub-L Colina et al 2001 For the HLIRGs in our
sample this is not the case One object F142183845 is
a QSO with a host magnitude that suggests similarly to
the other QSOs in the sample the host is a very lumi-
nous massive system Farrah et al 2002a For the two non-
QSOs in our sample the picture is less clear with one object
F002351024 being 05 magnitudes dimmer than m
K  but
the other F100264949 over a magnitude brighter than
K We note however that the I-band magnitudes of those
HLIRGs without a QSO presented by Farrah et al 2002a
are with the exception of F002351024 much brighter than
I  Whilst more data is evidently needed it appears rea-
sonable to assume that IR-luminous galaxies may become
more similar to QSO hosts with increasing redshift Whilst
this reinforces the idea that evolutionary links between IR-
luminous galaxies and QSOs become stronger with increas-
ing lookback time it also suggests that at z  05 a greater
number of IR-luminous galaxies evolve directly into optically
selected QSOs than locally
7 CONCLUSIONS
We have presented deep wide-eld K-band imaging of the
elds of six Hyperluminous Infared Galaxies and quantied
their environments using the Bgh galaxy-HLIRG correlation

amplitude and the N05 clustering statistic We conclude the
following
1 The HLIRGs in our sample reside in a diverse range of
environments from the eld to Abell 2 clusters The mean
clustering level of the sample at hBghi  190  45 and the
range of environments are both signicantly greater than
those of the most luminous IR galaxies locally We infer
that at high redshift the galaxy evolution processes driv-
ing the evolution of IR-luminous galaxies are more diverse
than at low redshift and include mergers between gas-rich
spirals in the eld but also include encounters in clusters
and hierarchical buildup
2 The mean clustering amplitude of the sample and the
range in environments are comparable to those of QSOs
over a similar redshift range We postulate from this that
at z  05 the range of galaxy evolution processes driving
IR-luminous galaxy evolution is similar to the range that
drives QSO evolution When combined with the similarities
between HLIRG host galaxies and QSO host galaxies at the
same redshifts this further suggests that a greater fraction of
IR-luminous galaxies evolve directly into optically selected
QSOs at high redshift than do locally
