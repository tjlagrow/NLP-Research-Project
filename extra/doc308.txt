ABSTRACT
We have investigated the redshift evolution of the colourcluster-centric-radius relation
and the morphologycluster-centric-radius relation in three redshift bins 002 6 z 6
014 014  z 6 020 and 020  z 6 030 using a homogeneous sample of 736 galaxy
clusters selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Both the relations are well-dened
in all the redshift bins the fraction of bluelate-type galaxies increases toward outside
of clusters Bluelate-type galaxy fractions are found to decrease with decreasing red-
shift at any cluster-centric radius The trend is consistent with the Butcher-Oemler
eect and the morphological Butcher-Oemler eect In addition we nd that colour
spectral evolution is almost completed by z  02 whereas morphological evolution
continues to the present day The colour-radius relation is smooth in all the redshift
bins while the morphologyradius relation has a break only in the highest redshift
bin It is also found that fractions of blue-late type galaxies decreases mostly between
the highest and the intermediate redshift bins while fractions of red-late type galaxies
continuously decreases with decreasing redshift through all the redshift bins These
results are consistent with the interpretation that the timescale of the colour spectral
evolution is shorter than that of the morphological evolution It is suggested that red-
late type galaxies in the middle of the transformation are observed as passive spiral
galaxies

INTRODUCTION
It is a remarkable feature of galaxy population that there ex-
ists a correlation between galaxy type-mix and environment
The correlation between morphology and environment has
been studied by many authors Dressler 1980 Postman 
Geller 1984 Whitmore et al 1993 Whitmore 1995 Dressler
et al 1997 Hashimoto  Oemler 1999 Fasano et al 2000
Tran et al 2001 Domnguez et al 2001 2002 Helsdon 
Ponman 2003 Treu et al 2003 Goto et al 2003e There
is also a correlation between colours spectra and environ-
ment It is known that the fractions of blue galaxies increases
toward outer parts of clusters eg Butcher  Oemler 1984

Various physical mechanisms have been proposed to
explain the correlations Possible mechanisms include ram-

Although these processes are all plausible however there
exists little evidence demonstrating that any one of these
processes is actually responsible for driving galaxy evolution
Tomotsugu Goto et al
Since most of these processes act over an extended period of
time observations at a certain redshift cannot easily provide
the detailed information that is needed to elucidate subtle
and complicated cluster-related processes It is worth not-
ing that EA ka or post-starburst galaxies which often
thought to be cluster-related are found to have their origin
in mergerinteraction with accompanying galaxies Goto et
al 2003cd and thus EA galaxies are not likely to be a
product of the morphological transition in cluster regions
To shed light on the underlying physical mechanisms
it is important to trace the redshift evolution of correlations
among morphology colour and environment Studies on the
evolution of morphologydensity relation were attempted by
Dressler et al 1997 and Fasano et al 2000 who reported
the signicant decrease in S0E ratio toward increasing red-
shift up to z  04 However such studies were hampered
by the inherent diculty due to small and inhomogeneous
cluster samples eg Andreon 1998 They compared many
nearby poor clusters observed with ground-based telescopes
with the 10 rich clusters at high redshift observed with the
Hubble Space Telescopes On the colour evolution of clus-
ter galaxies it has been known that the fractions of blue
galaxies in a cluster increases toward higher redshift the

goniner et al 2001 Goto et al 2003a To extract more
information it is important to investigate the mutual rela-
tionship between the correlations among colour morphol-
ogy and environments
With the advent of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS
Stoughton et al 2002 we now have a chance to step for-
ward One of the largest cluster catalogs with a well de-
ned selection function is compiled from the SDSS Goto
et al 2002ab In addition to the availability of the ve
optical colours in the SDSS u g r i and z Fukugita et
al 1996 this catalog has an advantage in that both high
and low redshift clusters are detected using the same clus-
ter nding algorithm Goto et al 2002a In this study we
adopt the cluster-centric-radius as a parameter of environ-
ment and investigate the evolution of colourradius relation
and morphologyradius relation
The paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we de-
scribe the SDSS data we used In Section 3 we explain au-
tomated morphological classications and the method to es-
timate type fraction In Section 4 we present the results
and discuss the physical implications The cosmological pa-
rameters adopted throughout this paper are H075 km s1
Mpc1 and mk030700
2 THE SDSS DATA
The data used in this study are essentially the same data as
used in Goto et al 2003a The galaxy catalog is taken from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Early Data Release SDSS
EDR Stoughton et al 2002 which covers 394 deg2 of
the sky see Fukugita et al 1996 Gunn et al 1998 Lupton
et al 199920012002 York et al 2000 Eisenstein et al 2001
Hogg et al 2001 Blanton et al 2003 Richards et al 2002
Stoughton et al 2002 Strauss et al 2002 Smith et al 2002
Pier et al 2003 for more detail of the SDSS data The clus-
ter catalog is presented in Goto et al 2002a In this study
we limit our sample clusters to those with richness between
20 and 80 using the cluster richness measured as a num-
ber of galaxies between Mr  240 and 1944 within
07 Mpc from a cluster centre after forebackground sub-
traction see Goto et al 2002b These richness cuts nicely
select rich clusters that allows us to study radial prole and
at the same time to reject richest clusters minimizing a possi-
ble richness related bias The resulting number of clusters in
our sample is still large N  736 We separate these clus-
ters in three redshift bins 002 6 z 6 014 014  z 6 020
and 020  z 6 030 corresponding lookback time of 09 19
and 27 Gyr Each redshift bin has 82 188 and 466 clusters
respectively
3 ANALYSIS
In order to measure bluelate-type fractions we have to sub-
tract forebackground galaxy counts statistically since our
galaxy catalog is based on the imaging data The adopted
procedure is the same to the one used in Goto et al 2003a
except the use of global galaxy number counts Instead of lo-
cal galaxy number counts we use the entire 394 deg2 of the
imaging data to calculate an average galaxy number counts
in the magnitude range between Mr  240 and 207
The use of global forebackground estimation is essential
to probe slight over-densities in cluster perimeter regions
Among the entire region cluster regions are only 24 in an-
gular area We re-scale this average galaxy number counts
to meet an angular area of each radial bin then subtract
forebackground galaxy counts statistically
Since a physical size of a cluster diers cluster by clus-
ter it is important to normalize the cluster radius when
measuring bluelate type fractions Since it is dicult to
measure a virial radius using the imaging data we measure
a pseudo-virial radius in a following way to normalize the
cluster-centric radius see Goto et al 2003a for details
Rvir  07  Richness3213M pc
Equation 1 returns us with a normalized cluster radius of
Rvir  07 Mpc for clusters with Richness  32 cf 07
Mpc  a virial radius of a system with   350 km s1
We note that Rvir is a pseudo-virial radius and that caution
is needed when comparing with a virial radius from a more
realistic measurement such as velocity dispersion or X-ray
radial prole Using a position of the brightest cluster galaxy
given in Goto et al 2002a as a cluster centre we sum the
number of bluelate and all galaxies within radial bins sep-
arated at RccRvir  02 04 07 and 10 Rcc is a distance
from a cluster centre and then subtract forebackground
statistically to measure bluelate-type fractions
To classify galaxies into bluelate-type and others we
use exactly the same method as in Goto et al 2003a which
we briey summarize below We use galaxies between Mr 
240 and 207 This absolute magnitude range assures the
proper measurement of ur and g r colours for the faintest
galaxies at the highest redshift bin Fractions of blue galaxies
are dened in two dierent ways fb and fur22 The rst
method fb uses restframe g  r colour If a galaxy is bluer
by more than 02 in g r than the colour of the red-sequence
of elliptical galaxies at the redshift of the cluster we dene
the galaxy as blue This denition is a similar denition as

Figure 1 Evolution of the morphologycolourradius relation The fractions of bluelate-type galaxies are plotted against cluster-centric-
radius normalized using cluster richness The solid dashed and dotted lines represent clusters with 002 6 z 6 014 014  z 6 020
and 020  z 6 030
was used in original Butcher  Oemler 1984 and recently
in Margoniner et al 2001 The fraction of blue galaxy fb
is dened as the ratio of a number of blue galaxies to that
of all galaxies after the global forebackground subtraction
The second method fur22 denes a blue galaxy as a
galaxy with u  r  22 Strateva et al 2001 Again the
fraction of blue galaxy fur22 is dened as the ratio of
a number of blue galaxies to that of all galaxies after the
global forebackground subtraction
To separate galaxies into earlylate-type morphologi-
cally we use two dierent purely morphological parameters
as are used in Goto et al 2003a The rst one fCin uses
a concentration parameter Cin dened as the ratio of Pet-
rosian 50 ux radius to Petrosian 90 ux radius We
regard a galaxy with Cin  04 as late-type Shimasaku et
al 2001 Note that fCin can be aected by the seeing size
Goto et al 2003a estimated that an increasing seeing size
might increase late-type fractions by 5 between z  03
and z  002 The other morphological classication fexp
uses galaxy radial prole tting When an exponential pro-
le ts better than de Vaucouleurs prole to a galaxy the
galaxy is classied into late-type The fraction of late-type
galaxy fCin or fexp is dened as the ratio of a number
of late-type galaxies to that of all galaxies after the global
forebackground subtraction
The errors on bluelate-type fractions are computed
based on equation 2 of Goto et al 2003a The errors
are as small as the dot size in Figure 1 Note that these
errors do not consider errors in classifying galaxies into sub-
categories
4 RESULTS  DISCUSSION
We present the evolution of the colourradius relation and
the morphologyradius relation based on the SDSS data in
Figure 1 where bluelate type fractions are plotted against
the normalized cluster-centric-radius for the three redshift
bins We use four annulus bins for radial direction each
separated at RccRvir  02 04 07 and 10 and three
redshift bins 002 6 z 6 014 014  z 6 020 and
020  z 6 030 The fb fur22 fCin and fexp are plot-
ted in the lower left upper left upper right and lower right
panels respectively ie the two left panels probe colour
evolution of cluster galaxies and the two right panels are for
morphological evolution The following observational results
can be recognized from Figure 1
In all the panels the fractions of bluelate type galax-
ies decrease with decreasing redshift at almost all cluster-
centric-radius The decrease is consistent with the Butcher
Oemler eect left panels and the morphological Butcher
Oemler eect right panels
The amount of decrease in fractions might be smaller
for colour evolution left panels eg less than 20 decrease
between the highest and the lowest redshift bins than for
morphological evolution right panels greater than 30 de-
crease between the highest and the lowest redshift bins If
the trend is real it might imply that some red late-type
galaxies changed their morphology into early-type between
z  03 and z  002
Furthermore at the intermediate redshift 014  z 6
020 the fractions of blue galaxies in the two left pan-
els are almost as low as those at the lowest redshift bin
002 6 z 6 014 On the other hand morphological late-
type fractions shown in the two right panels are 10 larger
than those at the lowest redshift bin The trend might sug-
Tomotsugu Goto et al
Figure 2 The fractions of four types of galaxies are plotted against cluster-centric-radius normalized using cluster richness The criterion
to separate redblue is u  r  22 and that for earlylate is Cin  04 The solid dashed and dotted lines represent clusters with
002 6 z 6 014 014  z 6 020 and 020  z 6 030
gest that the colour spectral evolution is already completed
at the intermediate redshift bin while the morphological
evolution continues to the lowest redshift bin ie timescale
of the colour spectral evolution may be shorter than the
timescale of the morphological evolution
The radial prole are smooth for the fractions of blue
galaxies at any redshift bin However for late-type fractions
in the two right panels the radial proles seem to have a
break at RccRvir  03 at the highest redshift bin Then
the proles become smoother with decreasing redshift A
similar trend is found by Treu et al see their Fig 17 in
comparing the morphologydensity relation of their cluster
Cl002416 with that of the nearby cluster sample in Dressler
1980 The result indicates that the delayed morphological
evolution occurs around RccRvir  0308 where many
spectrally evolved but morphologically unevolved galaxies
possibly exist The interpretation is consistent with Goto et
al 2003b who found passive spiral galaxies in the infalling
region perimeter of clusters Note that Goto et al 2003b
used galaxies with spectroscopy whereas this work statis-
tically determines galaxy fractions from the imaging data
see also Couch et al 1998 Poggianti et al 1999 for passive
spirals
The dierence in timescale of the spectral evolution and
the morphological evolution is further claried in Figure 2
where we plot fractions of four dierent types of galaxies
as a function of cluster-centric-radius Here we classied
galaxies into the following four dierent subsamples blue-
late u  r  22 Cin  04 blue-early u  r  22
Cin  04 red-late u  r  22 Cin  04 and red-
early u  r  22 Cin  04 In the lower right and upper
left panels we plot the redshift evolution of blue-late and
red-early types of galaxies as a function of cluster-centric-
radius As expected red-early type shows gradual increase
with decreasing redshift and blue-late type shows gradual
decrease with decreasing redshift However a contrasting
result is found when we compare red-late fractions upper
right with blue-late fractions lower right The fractions of
red-late type are not very much dependent on the cluster-
centric-radius In addition red-late fractions show much evo-
lution between the lowest and the intermediate redshift bins
whereas blue-late fractions show large evolution only be-
tween the highest and intermediate redshift bins Assuming
that blue galaxies evolve into red and that late type evolves
into early type these results suggest that colour evolution
blue to red mainly occurs between the highest and inter-
mediate redshift and that morphological evolution late to
early continues toward the lowest redshift even after colour
evolution was completed In other words it might indicate
that morphological evolution needs longer timescale to be
completed 2 Gyr than the colour evolution does 1
Gyr These estimates will provide a good benchmark to
compare with semi-analytic simulations eg Okamoto 
Nagashima 2001 Diaferio et al 2001 Benson et al 2001
Springel et al 2001 Okamoto  Nagashima 2003 Finally
we would like to mention that red-late type galaxies may be
the same galaxy population as passive spiral galaxies found
in Goto et al 2003b
