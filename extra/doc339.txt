ABSTRACT
We use the spatial information of our previously published VLTFORS2 absorption line spectroscopy
to measure mean stellar velocity and velocity dispersion proles of 25 eld early-type galaxies at a
median redshift z  097 full range 06  z  12 This provides the rst detailed study of early-type
galaxy rotation at these redshifts From surface brightness proles from HST imaging we calculate
two-integral oblate axisymmetric Jeans equation models for the observed kinematics Fits to the data
yield for each galaxy the degree of rotational support and the mass-to-light ratio MLJeans S0 and
Sa galaxies are generally rotationally supported whereas elliptical galaxies rotate less rapidly or not
at all Down to MB  195 corrected for luminosity evolution we nd no evidence for evolution
in the fraction of rotating early-type ES0 galaxies between z  1 63  11 and the present
61 5 We interpret this as evidence for little or no change in the eld S0 fraction with redshift
We compare MLJeans with MLvir inferred from the virial theorem and globally averaged quantities
and assuming homologous evolution There is good agreement for nonrotating mostly E galaxies
However for rotationally supported galaxies mostly S0 MLJeans is on average  40 higher than
MLvir We discuss possible explanations and the implications for the evolution of ML between
z  1 and the present and its dependence on mass

1 INTRODUCTION
Detailed studies of nearby early-type galaxies pro-
vide insight into their stellar populations dark mat-
ter content and kinematic and spatial structure
particular resolved kinematic data reveal the under-
lying gravitational potential eg van der Marel 1991
Cappellari et al 2006 the presence of super-massive
black holes eg Richstone et al 1990 Verolme et al
2002 and dark halos eg Kronawitter et al 2000 and
the relative contributions of pressure and rotation to
its orbital energy eg Binney 1978 Davies et al 1983
Emsellem et al 2007

are much larger than for local galaxies and consequently
the level of detail is far lower Still the spatially resolved
information that is obtained by going beyond studies of
global quantities alone combined with the addition of
cosmic time to the equation has already revealed sev-
eral interesting results
Moran et al 2007 used rotation curves to address
the question whether E and S0 galaxies are coeval or
not They found that the relative number of rotation-
ally supported early-type galaxies at z  05 is lower
than today especially in clusters Combined with ex-
tensive studies of visually classied samples of galaxies
out to z  1 Dressler et al 1997 Postman et al 2005
Smith et al 2005 this is the best evidence to date for
relatively recent S0 formation presumably through the
transformation of in-falling star-forming Sa-like galax-
ies into quiescent cluster S0 galaxies eg Gunn  Gott
1972 Larson et al 1980
This classical picture does not address the high fraction
of S0 galaxies at low densities Approximately 60 of all
early-type galaxies in the eld are S0 galaxies Moreover
recently it was shown that the total fraction of early-type
galaxies does not signicantly change between z  08
and the present either in clusters Holden et al 2007 or
in the eld van der Wel et al 2007 if only galaxies with
masses M  05M  are considered This calls into ques-
tion the claim that S0 galaxies evolve dierently from E
galaxies although we note that this has so far not been
explicitly addressed Because of these reasons it is im-
portant to not lose sight of alternative scenarios for the
formation of S0 galaxies Merging that does not com-
pletely destroy the disk is another proposed mechanism
eg Bekki 1997 This is more similar to the favored
formation mechanism for E galaxies and would therefore
Spatially Resolved Kinematics at z  1
imply that E and S0 are in fact one class of objects with
a large range in bulge-to-disk ratios This ratio may be
related to the mass ratio and the dissipation of the merg-
ers eg Naab et al 2006a In this scenario E and S0
galaxies are expected to be roughly coeval
Another interesting observation in these contexts is
that van der Marel  van Dokkum 2007a found some
evidence that the relative number of rotationally sup-
ported cluster elliptical galaxies decreases slightly be-
This points to-
tween z  05 and the present
ward a scenario in which elliptical galaxies gradu-
ally lose angular momentum through interactions and
mergers eg Naab et al 2006b
not necessarily inconsistent with the conclusions from
Moran et al 2007 The latter authors used rotation
to trace the number of S0 galaxies whereas the sample
of van der Marel  van Dokkum 2007a contained al-
most no S0 galaxies by construction Therefore these
studies probed dierent aspects of the early-type ES0
galaxy population
Besides constraining rotation resolved kinematic data
also allow for a measurement of ML The evolution of
ML with redshift is typically studied using estimates
based on the virial theorem or the fundamental plane
eg van Dokkum  van der Marel 2007 This uses
only globally averaged quantities luminosity radius in-
tegrated velocity dispersion combined with assump-
tions about the dynamical structure of the galaxies and
the homology of their evolution Spatially resolved kine-
matics have the advantage that they allow the ML to be
inferred through detailed dynamical modeling which re-
moves some of the assumptions inherent in these studies
Systematic eects may aect not only the measured av-
erage evolution of ML but also the evolution of the tilt
of the fundamental plane ie the dependence of ML
evolution on galaxy mass eg van der Wel et al 2005
Treu et al 2005 Van der Marel  van Dokkum 2007b
addressed this for a sample of clusters elliptical galaxies
at z  05 They found that bright nonrotating galaxies
are consistent with homologous evolution but that the
situation may be more complicated for less luminous ro-
tating galaxies However the small size of their sample
and the limited number of S0 galaxies left room for dif-
ferent interpretations of this result
In this paper we study the resolved kinematics of
a sample of eld early-type galaxies at z  1 using
spatially resolved spectra from the Very Large Tele-
scope VLT and imaging from the Hubble Space Tele-
scope HST  This dataset was presented earlier by
van der Wel et al 2005 Our analysis methodology is
largely similar to that of van der Marel  van Dokkum
2007a 2007b However our sample is dierent from
theirs in three important areas First we focus on eld
galaxies instead of cluster galaxies Second our sample
includes signicant numbers of S0 and Sa galaxies in-
stead of just E galaxies And third we work at z  1
instead of z  05 thus providing a much extended base-
line for studying evolution
In particular we quantify
the evolution of the relative number of rotationally sup-
ported eld early-type galaxies from z  1 to the present
and we examine the dierence between the ML inferred
from spatially resolved and unresolved kinematic data
We have organized the paper as follows In 2 we in-
troduce the data In 3 we briey describe the dynam-
In 4 we present our results regarding

rotational support In 5 we present our results regard-
ing the ML

2 DATA
21 Spectroscopy
Very deep VLTFORS2 spectroscopy of a sample of
magnitude-limited morphologically selected eld early-
type galaxies at redshifts 06  z  12 in the Chan-
dra Deep Field-South CDF-S and the foreground of the
z  124 cluster RDCS 12529-2927 CL1252 were pre-
sented by van der Wel et al 2005 That paper provides
a full description of the data reduction including the
technique used to measure the global velocity dispersion
of each galaxy from its absorption features In this pa-
per we examine a subsample of 25 early-type galaxies 10
E 9 S0 and 6 Sa galaxies that have such high-quality
spectra that variations of mean velocity v and velocity
dispersion  along the slit can be measured The median
redshift of this subsample is z  097 Since this is a
magnitude-limited subsample it is not biased against ro-
tating or nonrotating galaxies and it is representative for
the entire population of ES0 galaxies at this redshift
For high-redshift galaxies  is usually determined from
an extracted spectrum that is averaged over multiple pix-
els in the spatial direction in order to optimize for signal-
to-noise ratio SN  Here instead we measure v and
 for each individual row of pixels 025long for which
the SN is suciently high for a robust measurement
We use the same wavelength range and template stars as
used by van der Wel et al 2005 such that dierences
between the results from averaged and resolved spectra
are solely due to dierences in the observed spectra them-
selves The mean velocity proles typically measured for
57 pixel rows are shown in Figure 1 It is readily appar-
ent that many galaxies show signs of signicant rotation
Measuring  requires better SN  therefore  can usu-
ally only be measured for 35 pixel rows The SN is
typically 15 A
for the outermost pixel rows for which
we measure  the central pixel rows obviously have the
highest SN  For two galaxies CDFS-18 and CDFS-23
we have SN  8 A
only for the outermost pixel rows
which is not ideal for velocity dispersion measurements
However for consistency we retained these rows in our
analysis because the large resulting error bars are explic-
itly accounted for in our modeling described in 3
Figure 2 we show the  proles In both Figures 1 and 2
we over-plot the best-tting models that we describe in

maximum value for k that is physically possible is adopted instead

given in van der Wel et al 2005 where more information regard-
ing the photometric and kinematic properties can be found
Van der Wel et al 2005 used the F850LP images to
t de Vaucouleurs proles to the objects in their sam-
ple in order to determine their eective radii Re and
surface brightnesses e  For the present analysis we
use the ACS data to measure the full surface brightness
prole for each galaxy We follow the same procedure de-
scribed by van der Marel  van Dokkum 2007a First
the images are deconvolved with the point-spread func-
tion PSF for which we use stars in the eld using
the Lucy-Robertson algorithm Subsequently we tted
elliptical isophotes to the two-dimensional images with
the IRAF task ELLIPSE This yields one-dimensional
proles of major-axis surface brightness position angle
and ellipticity For galaxies at redshifts z  085 we
use the ACS F850LP images and for galaxies at red-
shifts z  085 we use the ACS F775W images With
these choices the observed wavelength corresponds as
closely as possible to the rest-frame B band The ob-
served surface brightness proles are transformed into
the rest-frame B band using the method presented in
van Dokkum  van der Marel 2007 This facilitates
the comparison with local galaxy samples
3 MODELS
For a full description of the modeling procedure we re-
fer to van der Marel  van Dokkum 2007a In short
the rest-frame B-band photometry described in 22 is
tted with the projection of a parameterized oblate ax-
isymmetric constant axial-ratio luminosity distribution
The results of the modeling are fairly insensitive to vari-
Fig 2 Proles of velocity dispersion  for the same 25 eld
early-type galaxies at redshifts 06  z  12 as in Fig 1 The
points indicate the measured dispersion at each spatial pixel in
the spectroscopic slits The solid curves show the predictions of
the best-tting models For comparison dotted curves are the
corresponding predictions when seeing convolution and pixelslit
binning are not taken into account The visual morphology the
redshift and the rest-frame B-band model ML in solar units are
given for each object
ations in the unknown inclination van der Marel  van
Dokkum 2007a 2007b In the discussion below we adopt
for each galaxy the inclination angle that is most likely
given the probability distribution of intrinsic axial ratios
derived from large galaxy catalogs of the local universe
Given the three-dimensional luminosity density the
Jeans equations are solved under the assumptions of a
constant ML and a two-integral distribution function
f  f E Lz where E is the energy and Lz the angular
momentum around the symmetry axis The models have
R  v2
z so their velocity distribution is isotropic in the
meridional plane The ratio of v2
R is determined
by the requirement of hydrostatic equilibrium The sec-
ond azimuthal velocity moment is split into mean and
random components according to the convenient param-
eterization

v  k cid16v2
Rcid1712
  v2
A value k  0 yields a galaxy that is nonrotating and
fully pressure supported A value k  1 yields an oblate
isotropic rotator ie a galaxy with sucient rotation to
fully explain its attening The value of k can be larger
than unity with a physical maximum that depends on
the shape of the galaxy and set by the requirement that
  v2 is everywhere positive In the following
  v2
we always choose the major axis position angle which is
indeterminate module 180 so that k is positive
The solutions of the Jeans equations are integrated
along the line of sight and then convolved in luminosity-
weighted sense with the seeing typically 06-08 and

van Dokkum  van der Marel 2007 Filled symbols are E galax-
ies open circles are S0 galaxies and open dotted circles without
error bars are Sa galaxies as determined by visual classication
The local comparison sample is shown as small symbols with the
dierent morphologies distinguished by the same symbols as used
for the distant sample V  which is comparable to k is used
to quantify the rotation rate for the local galaxy sample The dis-
tributions of the local and distant samples are similar
with the size of the pixels 025long in the slit 10 wide
through which the galaxies spectra were taken taking
the angle between the orientation of the slit and the
major axis into account The match of the predictions
to the kinematic data from 21 is optimized by nding
the best-tting value of the two available model param-
eters The mass-to-light ratio ML determines the total
amount of rms motion v2  2 whereas the parame-
ter k determines the amount of rotational support which
is related to v Solid curves in Figures 1 and 2 show
the best model ts For comparison dotted curves show
the model predictions if no account is taken of seeing and
pixelslit binning Clearly the latter makes a consider-
able dierence and it is therefore important that this is
properly modeled Best-t values of k are listed in the
individual panels of Figure 1
4 ROTATION AT Z  1
41 Evolution in Rotation Rate
As is readily apparent from Figure 1 many early-type
In Figure 3
galaxies at z  1 show signs of rotation
we show using large symbols the rotation parameter k as
a function of absolute B-band magnitude distinguishing
between galaxies with dierent visual morphologies The
absolute magnitudes are corrected for luminosity evolu-
tion using the results of van Dokkum  van der Marel
2007 Slightly dierent values would have been rea-
sonable as well see eg 52 but none of our results
Fig 4 Ellipticity vs rotation rate k for the distant sample
V  for the local sample The symbols that indicate dierent
visual classications are the same as in Fig 3 The ellipticity dis-
tribution like the rotation rate distribution is similar for the local
and distant samples
depend sensitively on this
Only ve out of the 25 galaxies show little or no ro-
tation These are all elliptical galaxies By contrast all
S0 and Sa galaxies show signicant rotation with many
consistent with being rotationally supported Figure 4
shows the rotation parameter k as a function of the ap-
parent ellipticity   1  ba using similar symbols as
in Figure 3 This shows that the nonrotating galaxies
tend to be rounder than most of the rotating galaxies
some of which clearly show disks
As noted by Moran et al 2007 a single-component
spheroidal model may not be representative for S0
galaxies
models can in principle be extended to include disks
Cinzano  van der Marel 1994 but we have not ex-
plored that here Therefore the inferred k may not al-
ways necessarily correspond to the physical property it
represents in the model Nonetheless as a t parameter
k still provides an eective measure of the relative impor-
tance of rotation in the galaxy In fact Figures 3 and 4
show that E and S0 galaxies can be distinguished fairly
successfully based on their kinematics as quantied by
the parameter k Additional use of luminosity and ax-
ial ratio information can further increase the accuracy of
such a kinematical classication scheme as advocated by
Moran et al 2007 The only galaxy that seems some-
what out of place in Figure 3 is the most rapidly rotating
elliptical galaxy However this is also the least luminous
galaxy in the sample and it may well have been visually
misclassied
The clean kinematic separation between dierent mor-
phological types at z  1 is surprising given the complex
situation for local early-type galaxies Emsellem et al
2007 Both E and S0 galaxies are often fast rotators
with overlapping kinematic properties Cappellari et al

the same value as for a large volume-limited sample of
galaxies at z  003 see van der Wel et al 2007 It is
also comparable with the estimated surface density in
co-moving units for a sample of distant eld galaxies
see van der Wel et al 2007 of which our distant sam-
ple is a sub-sample Maximum stellar velocities V and
velocity dispersions  are known for 55 Es and 43 S0s
Prugniel  Simien 1996 There are 37 galaxies in this
sample for which multiple independent measurements of
the rotation velocity V are available For 31 of these the
measurements are consistent within the errors The mea-
surements are inconsistent only for the remaining six see
Table A2 of Prugniel  Simien 1996 Because especially
galaxies with peculiar properties tend to be targeted mul-
tiple times the measurements for the remainder of the
sample may actually be even better Therefore the kine-
matic measurements for the local sample are generally
reliable and reproduceable
We quantify the rotation rate of the local sample using
the quantity V   V p1   This approxi-
mates the ratio of the actual rotation rate of the galaxy
to the ratio expected for an oblate isotropic rotator of
the given observed axial ratio Davies et al 1983 This
quantity is therefore similar to our model parameter k
The only dierence is that k is dened locally in the
meridional plane by equation 1 whereas V  is de-
ned in terms of the globally dened projected quantities
V   and  Van der Marel 1991 see his Fig 3a made
a direct comparison of k and V  for a sample of local
galaxies and found a good agreement to 10 For the
present paper we therefore compare V  for the local
sample directly to k for the distant sample
The local sample is shown in Figures 3 and 4 us-
ing small symbols As compared to the distant sample
there are some dierences in the types of galaxies that
show high rotation rates
In the distant sample these
are almost all attened visually classied S0 galaxies
By contrast in the local sample these include quite a
few roundish visually classied E galaxies It has been
known for some time eg Rix  White 1990 that local
galaxy catalogs are decient in such galaxies Of course
distant samples may be plagued by similar or worse
problems However our sample size is too small to make
denite statements about this issue
As noted earlier possible uncertainties in the relative
classications of E and S0 galaxies do not aect the as-
sessment of the rotation rate distribution of early-type
ES0 galaxies in general Figure 5 shows that the ro-
tation rate histograms are statistically indistinguishable
for the local and distant samples 63  11 12 out
of 19 of the ES0 galaxies in the distant sample have
high rotation rates k  06 and 59  5 58 out of
98 of those in the local sample have high rotation rates
V   06
The similarity between these two numbers is striking
however they may not be directly comparable as the
kinematic data for the local sample are not complete
nor representative for the morphological composition of
the population an E galaxy is twice as likely to have
kinematic data as an S0 galaxy see the values above
If we very crudely assume that all S0 galaxies rotate
and all E galaxies do not then the fraction of rotating
ES0 galaxies would be 69 However in reality the rel-
Fig 5 Histograms of early-type ES0 galaxy rotation rates
The parameter k is used for the distant sample solid line with
Poisson error bars and the quantity V  is used for the local
sample dashed line Only galaxies brighter than MB  195
are included corrected for luminosity evolution in the case of the
distant sample There is no signicant dierence between the two
samples in terms of relative numbers of slow-rotating and fast-
rotating galaxies
2007 The clean separation at higher redshifts is there-
fore quite likely partially articial Morphological clas-
sications are dicult at high redshift and recent work
has shown that the relative number of S0 galaxies at high
redshift is systematically underestimated as evidenced by
the lack of S0 galaxies with   03 B P Holden et al in
preparation In addition elongated rotating elliptical
galaxies can be misclassied as S0 galaxies Nonetheless
these concerns are not relevant for the main goal of this
paper the evolution of the rotation of early-type galaxies
as a single class of objects
To address the issue of evolution in the rotation rate
we compare the z  1 sample with a local sample ex-
tracted from the Lyon Extragalactic DataBase LEDA
Paturel et al 1997 which is distributed and made avail-
able as HyperLeda Paturel et al 20035 We restrict the
local sample to galaxies within  40 Mpc distance mod-
ulus m  M  33 In order to construct a eldgroup
ES0 sample we included only galaxies with fewer than
80 neighbors brighter than MB  195 within a cylin-
der with a 5 Mpc diameter at the distance of the galaxy
and with a dierence in radial velocity with respect to the
cosmic microwave background of less than 1000 km s1
This eectively selects a complete sample of 179 galax-
ies 70 Es 109 S0s outside overdense structures most
notably the Virgo Cluster The median projected sur-
face density is   04 Mpc2 which is derived from
the distance to the 7th nearest neighbor down to the
luminosity limit of the magnitude-limited sample with
the same radial velocity within 1000 km s1 This is

Spatially Resolved Kinematics at z  1
ative fractions of rotatingnonrotating E and S0 galaxies
are not very dierent 55 and 65 respectively see
the small data points in Fig 3 Based on these relative
numbers of rotating galaxies for E and S0 galaxies as
separate classes we estimate that the true relative frac-
tion of rotating early-type galaxies is 61 only slightly
higher than the measured value of 59
Concluding we nd no evidence for evolution in the
rotation rate of eld early-type galaxies between z 
1 and the present down to the luminosity limit of the
distant sample MB  195 The distant sample is
small as evidenced by the large error bars in Fig 5 but
we would have detected an increase or decrease by more
than 25 in the relative number of rotating galaxies if
there were such evolution
42 Comparison with Previous Results
The only previous measurement of the evolution of
the relative number of rotationally supported early-type
ES0 galaxies is that of Moran et al 2007 Those
authors found substantial evolution for cluster early-type
galaxies in the sense that fewer early-type galaxies are ro-
tationally supported at z  05 than locally which is in-
terpreted as evidence for a lower S0 fraction in the distant
clusters This result for cluster galaxies is not directly
comparable to ours However the eld early-type galaxy
sample from Moran et al 2007 contains only 4314
rotating galaxies which is less than the value for local
galaxies inferred from the LEDA sample described above
If this marginally signicant decrease between z  05
and the present is real more evolution between z  1
and the present can be expected but in our sample we
do not observe this Besides the low signicance this
comparison is furthermore hampered by dierences in
methodology Therefore it is interesting to compare our
results and methods with those from Moran et al 2007
in more detail
Both we and Moran et al 2007 measured spatially
resolved kinematical proles of galaxies but beyond that
our methods are very dierent Moran et al 2007 infer
global quantities the rotation v velocity dispersion 
and ellipticity and they do so directly from the data
Observational eects are not taken into account and the
internal dynamics of the galaxies are not modeled Our
method aims to model the internal dynamics to take
into account known dierences between galaxies eg in
their surface brightness prole and to account explicitly
for all known observational inuences on the measured
quantities The approach of Moran et al 2007 has
the advantage of being simple and model-independent
However ignoring the eects of seeing convolution and
pixelslit binning can bias the results Figure 1 shows
that these eects have a signicant impact on both the
measured rotation value at the outermost radius and the
maximum value of the rotation curve As a result the
relative number of rotating galaxies can be underesti-
To quantitatively illustrate the eect of seeing convo-
lution and pixelslit binning we apply one of the kine-
matic classiers of Moran et al 2007 namely v1 
to our datasets Here v is dened as half the velocity
range of a tted straight line from end to end of the
measured velocity prole approximating the maximum
rotation velocity From the LEDA sample we derive that
65  5 of the local population satises the criterion
from Moran et al 2007 virtually the same fraction as
galaxies with V   06 see 41 This demonstrates
that for the purpose of distinguishing rotating and non-
rotating galaxies the two methods are in principle com-
parable
In our z  1 sample only 7 out of 19 ES0 galax-
ies 37  11 have v1    85 km s1 consistent
with the results from Moran et al 2007 for z  05 eld
galaxies but substantially less than the number of galax-
ies with k  06 63  11 in our z  1 eld sample
However if we use the maximum model line-of-sight ve-
locity with observational eects taken into account ie
the dotted curves instead of the solid curves in Fig 1
then we nd a higher fraction with v1   85 km s1
63  11 the same as the fraction of galaxies with
k  06 This implies that omission of the eects of see-
ing convolution and pixelslit binning can lead to signif-
icant underestimates of the number of rotating galaxies
at high redshift This may well explain the relatively low
number of kinematically classied eld S0 galaxies found
by Moran et al 2007 at z  05 However we cannot
assess the question as to what extent the above-described
bias contributes to the evolution that Moran et al 2007
found for cluster galaxies
Interestingly
classications
statistically
kinematic
Moran et al
speaking
with visual morphological classications at both low
and high redshifts This argues either against a bias
in their results or that visual classications can suer
from a similar bias against rotatingS0 galaxies An
indication that high-z classications of S0 galaxies are
indeed hampered by systematic problems is that the
ellipticity distribution for the cluster early-type galaxy
population does not change signicantly with redshift
suggesting that high-z S0 galaxies are systematically
misclassied as E galaxies more so than the other way
around B P Holden et al in preparation Still to
what extent biases contribute to an apparent decline
in the S0 fraction with redshift will probably continue
to be a matter of debate for some time to come Also
the answer may well be dierent for cluster and eld
galaxies However it is certainly intriguing that our
detailed observations and modeling of eld galaxies at
z  1 show no evolution in the fraction of rotating
early-type galaxies
Note that our result does not necessarily imply that
there is no evolution in the early-type galaxy popula-
tion On the one hand rotationally supported early-
type galaxies may merge and produce pressure-supported
elliptical galaxies eg Naab et al 2006b This pro-
cess would produce an increase in the fraction of elon-
gatedrotating galaxies with redshift for which some
tentative evidence exists in clusters from the results of
van der Marel  van Dokkum 2007a On the other
hand rotating quiescent galaxies may be formed out
of Sa galaxies that cease to form stars contributing to
the increase in the stellar mass density of red galaxies
eg Bell et al 2004 Brown et al 2007 and the de-
crease of the cosmic average star formation rate eg
Le Floch et al 2005 Noeske et al 2007 As long as the
mechanisms that increase and decrease the relative num-
bers of rotating and nonrotating galaxies do not change
their ratio continued growth of both the E and the S0

population is possible up to the present day
Neither the results of our own study nor that of
Moran et al 2007 are directly comparable to those ob-
tained by van der Marel  van Dokkum 2007a using
the same technique as was in this paper This is be-
cause their study at z  05 dealt with a cluster sample
that was preselected to contain almost no S0 galaxies
Therefore it can shed little light on the evolution of the
S0 fraction with redshift
5 MASS-TO-LIGHT RATIOS
51 Comparison between Model and Virial ML
Estimates
According to the virial theorem the mass of a stellar
system can be written as
Re 2
eective
and e
where Re
the luminosity-weighted velocity dispersion measured
through an aperture of size Re The homology parame-
ter  generally depends on the detailed density structure
and velocity dispersion anisotropy of the galaxy Plausi-
ble models can span a wide range of  values However
Cappellari et al 2006 found that early-type galaxies in
the local universe all follow   50  01 with surpris-
ingly low scatter This calibration was obtained by calcu-
lating galaxy masses M from detailed dynamical models
for integral-eld kinematical data including higher-order
velocity moments The quantity e was measured by
integration over the spatially resolved two-dimensional
velocity eld The virial mass-to-light ratio MLvir can
be calculated upon division by the luminosity L The
latter can be measured through aperture photometry or
it can be estimated as L  2R2
eIe  where Ie is the
average intensity inside Re
Equation 2 is commonly used to estimate the mass of
distant galaxies In doing so one generally measures the
velocity dispersion c through a spectroscopic aperture
The velocity dispersion e is then estimated by apply-
ing a correction formula that is based on typical observa-
tions of local galaxies Jrgensen et al 1995 However
the ndings of Cappellari et al 2006 do not guarantee
that equation 2 with   5 is as accurate as it is in the
local universe for at least two dierent reasons First
galaxies may evolve so that the homology parameter 
could be a function of redshift Second the accuracy
and applicability of the corrections from c to e are
not guaranteed at high redshift The spectroscopic aper-
tures and the seeing in use there often exceed the galaxy
size Re Observations that adequately mimic this are
not available in the local universe Moreover even in
the local universe e c shows strong variations from
galaxy to galaxy Cappellari et al 2006 It is therefore
necessary to calibrate equation 2 and the appropriate
value of  at high redshift in the same way as was done
locally This is possible for our sample by comparing the
MLJeans from our dynamical models 3 with the val-
ues of MLvir Our data quality is obviously not compa-
rable to the two-dimensional velocity elds and higher-
order moments that are available locally Nonetheless
this calibration is unique and has not previously been
done at these redshifts
Fig 6 Jeans ML vs virial ML calculated using   5 in
eq 2 for the z  1 galaxy sample The symbols that indicate
dierent visual classications are the same as in Fig 3 E galaxies
follow the relation MLJeans  MLvir dotted line However
S0 galaxies on average have MLJeans systematically higher than
MLvir by  40 The solid line is the least-squares t for the
full sample which has MLJeans  ML102
and has MLJeans
systematically higher than MLvir by  20
In Figure 6 we compare MLvir and MLJeans for our
sample at z  1 We computed MLvir using   5 with
c and Re as measured by van der Wel et al 2005
The spectroscopic aperture was dened by the width
of the spectroscopic slit 1 and the height of the ex-
tracted spectrum usually 125 The ratio e c was
estimated using the formula of Cappellari et al 2006
which is consistent with those of Jrgensen et al 1995
As for local galaxies the slope of the best-tting linear
relation between MLvir and MLJeans is consistent with
unity However there is a systematic oset that appears
to depends on the galaxy type This is seen in the resid-
uals logMLJeansMLvir shown in Figure 7 For E
galaxies the residuals are consistent with zero There-
fore   5 is appropriate for E galaxies at high redshift
and as a class E galaxies are consistent with homologous
evolution For S0 and Sa galaxies on the other hand
MLJeans is on average almost 40 higher than MLvir
As shown in Figures 7a and 7b these galaxies tend to
be atter and more rapidly rotating than the E galax-
ies These results are consistent with the earlier ndings
of van der Marel  van Dokkum 2007b in clusters at
z  05 However the trends are much clearer in the
present sample because of its higher fraction of rapidly
rotating S0 and Sa galaxies
There are several possible explanations for the trends
observed in Figure 7 First S0 and Sa galaxies at z  1
may have   5 However this would imply that these
galaxies evolve nonhomologously while E galaxies do
not This seems to us unlikely as in that case it would
be an odd coincidence that   5 for all types of lo-
cal galaxies Second it is possible that our models have

middle panel  and eective radius right panel  The symbols that indicate dierent visual classications are the same as in Fig 3 The
residuals tend to be positive for galaxies of S0 or Sa type for galaxies with signicant ellipticity or rotation rate or for galaxies of small

overestimated the MLJeans for rapidly rotating galaxies
Such galaxies may have rapidly rotating disks that are
not well represented by our constant axial ratio oblate
models However Cinzano  van der Marel 1994 ad-
dressed this issue explicitly for the well-studied nearby
early-type disk galaxy NGC 2974 and found that a single-
component model overestimated the ML by only 12
This is not sucient to explain the trends seen in Fig-
ure 7 Third it is possible that the virial equation 2 for
MLvir underestimates the true mass of rapidly rotating
galaxies at high redshift Rotation contributes to the hy-
drostatic support of the galaxy so if it is ignored then
the ML will be underestimated While rotation does in-
crease e through the eect of line broadening this may
not fully capture the true hydrostatic importance of the
rotation component This may be especially important if
the seeing is of order of or larger than the scale at which
rotation is manifest Such problems are avoided for local
galaxies for which much higher quality data are available
This may explain the apparent dierences between the
ML of rotating galaxies at low and high redshifts For
our distant galaxies correction formulae for e c are
used that are not themselves calibrated at high redshift
52 Implications for the Evolution of ML
In the previous section we demonstrated that MLvir
may be too low for rapidly rotating galaxies at higher
redshifts but not for local early-type galaxies Since the
fundamental plane is in essence a correlation between
MLvir and other global galaxy parameters this will
bias the amount of ML evolution inferred from funda-
mental plane studies see van Dokkum  van der Marel
2007 and references therein Van der Wel 2005
found that the rate of luminosity evolution for the sam-
ple of eld galaxies that we also use in this paper is
 logML  076  007z Figures 6 and 7 sug-
gest that averaged over the rotating and nonrotating
galaxies in our sample MLvir may be too low by
 20
If so then the evolution in ML is reduced
to logML  069  007z This is steeper than
the evolution found for cluster galaxies but not by much
van Dokkum  van der Marel 2007
The dierence between MLJeans and MLvir depends
on the galaxy rotation rate Moreover rotating galax-
ies tend to have smaller Re than nonrotating galaxies
see Fig 7c Therefore our results also have conse-
quences for the measured evolution of the tilt of the fun-
damental plane and hence for the slope in the relation
between ML and either M or  as discussed previ-
ously by van der Marel  van Dokkum 2007b Evolution
in the tilt of the fundamental plane has been observed
by many authors van der Wel et al 2004 Treu et al
2005 van der Wel et al 2005 di Serego Alighieri et al
2005 Jrgensen et al 2005 However
it is a mat-
ter of debate to what extent sample selection eects
contribute to the observed evolution van der Wel et al
2005 Treu et al 2005 To illustrate the consequences of
the results presented in this paper we revisit the analysis
from van der Wel et al 2005 They showed that the
probability that the observed distribution of Mvir and
MLvir is drawn from a parent population with the same
distribution as the local galaxy population apart from
a constant amount of luminosity evolution inferred from
the most massive galaxies is as low as 014 We repeat
the analysis but now using the distribution of MJeans and
MLJeans and nd that this increases the probability to
30 In other words the evidence for mass-dependent
evolution of ML remains strong but it does become
weaker
These arguments illustrate that the often observed evo-
lution of the tilt of the fundamental plane is not necessar-
ily entirely due to mass-dependent evolution of the ML
ie downsizing In order to determine to what extent the
slope and the scatter of the relation between ML and
A van der Wel  RP van der Marel
M evolve still deeper observations are required to over-
come the biases caused by sample selection eects in the
surveys conducted over the past few years In addition
it may be necessary to use dynamical modeling as we do
in this paper to overcome the shortcomings of virial and
fundamental plane mass estimates
6 CONCLUSIONS
We use the spatial information of our previously pub-
lished VLTFORS2 absorption-line spectroscopy to mea-
sure mean stellar velocity and velocity dispersion pro-
les of 25 eld early-type galaxies in the redshift range
06  z  12 with median redshift z  097 The
kinematical proles can be reliably measured even in the
most distant galaxies Rotation is detected in the ma-
jority of the sample Surface brightness proles are de-
termined from HST imaging Two-integral solutions of
the Jeans equations for oblate axisymmetric constant
axial-ratio models are calculated to interpret the data
taking into account line-of-sight projection seeing con-
volution and pixelslit binning This yields for each
galaxy the degree of rotational support as quantied by
the parameter k and the mass-to-light ratio MLJeans
van der Marel  van Dokkum 2007a
The rapidly rotating k  06 and slow-rotating k 
06 galaxies in the distant sample tend to have dierent
global properties The rapidly rotating galaxies tend to
have later morphological types S0 or Sa and tend to
be less luminous and more elongated The slow-rotating
galaxies tend to have earlier morphological types E and
tend to be more luminous and rounder The systematic
variations with luminosity and axial ratio suggest that
the correlation with morphological type is real in agree-
ment with the ndings of Moran et al 2007 Local E
and S0 galaxies show a more complex and overlapping
set of kinematic properties eg Cappellari et al 2007
The contrasting clean separation of rotating and nonro-
tating galaxies according morphological type observed at
z  1 is most likely partially articial and must be re-
lated to the fact that roundface-on S0 galaxies are often
misclassied as E galaxies at high redshift even more so
than at low redshift
We have compiled a local comparison sample to study
evolution of the eld early-type ES0 galaxy rotation
rate The distribution of k in our z  1 sample is statis-
tically indistinguishable from the distribution of V 
a comparable measure of rotational support in the local
sample The relative fraction of rotating galaxies does
not change signicantly between z  1 63 11 and
If rotation is taken to be a
the present 61  5
reliable indicator of morphological type then this pro-
vides evidence for an unchanging fraction of S0 galaxies
in the early-type eld galaxy population with redshift
This conicts with the ndings of Moran et al 2007
who did not correct for the eects of seeing convolution
and pixelslit binning on the measured rotation curves
It is possible that this may have led to an underestimate
of the number of rapidly rotating eld galaxies at z  05
in their study
We have compared the mass-to-light ratio MLJeans
from our spatially resolved models to the values MLvir
inferred by applying the virial theorem to globally av-
eraged quantities For E galaxies which are generally
slow-rotating we nd good agreement using a homol-
ogy parameter   5 which is consistent with the
value calibrated locally So there is no evidence for non-
homologous evolution of E galaxies out to z  1 On the
other hand for elongated rotating galaxies which are
often S0s we nd that MLJeans is on average  40
higher than MLvir see Figs 6 and 7 For local galax-
ies this trend is not observed This may hint at non-
homologous evolution of this galaxy population  in-
creasing with redshift it may suggest that our dynam-
ical models produce biased results in these galaxies be-
cause of the neglect of cold disks or it may suggest that
the virial formula for ML produces biased results when
applied to poorly resolved rapidly rotating galaxies at
high redshift We cannot unambiguously identify the
true cause but to us the latter seems to be the most
straightforward explanation If so then studies of fun-
damental plane evolution overestimate both the amount
of evolution and the evolution in the tilt of the fundamen-
tal plane and the relation between M and ML which
is generally interpreted as evidence of down-sizing
