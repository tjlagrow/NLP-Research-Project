Summary Dynamical evolution of spiral galaxies is strongly dependent on non-
axisymmetric patterns that develop from gravitational instabilities either sponta-
neously or externally triggered Some evolutionary sequences are described through
which a galaxy could possibly concentrate mass and build bulges how external gas
accretion from cosmic laments could be funneled to the galaxy disks and inter-
mittently driven to the galaxy center to form nuclear starbursts and fuel an active
nucleus The frequency of both bars and lopsidedness can be used to constrain the
gas accretion rate
1 Evidence of gas ow central star formation and
pseudo-bulge formation
11 Molecular gas in barred galaxies
Sakamoto et al 1999 from a sample of 20 nearby galaxies were the rst to
notice that barred galaxies had a larger gas concentration in the central kilo-
parsec than unbarred galaxies conrming that bar instabilities were able to
drive gas inow towards the center Sheth et al 2005 from a sample of about
45 galaxies from BIMA-SONG conrm the larger CO concentration for barred
galaxies and nd that the nuclear molecular gas is 4 times more abundant in
early-types than late-types suggesting the gas inow are larger possibly due
to the existence of inner Lindblad resonances ILR expected when the mass
is concentrated due to bulges Jogee et al 2005 further note that barred
galaxies have a large circumnuclear surface densities in molecules and this
triggers the nuclear starbursts currently observed there The observation of
non-starbursting gas-rich barred galaxies allows to distinguish several phases
of evolution the rst phase reveals gas inow non circular motions since
the gas is partly in the bar and the gas is accumulating at the outer ILR
there is no starburst In the end-phase the gas has been driven down to the
inner ILR runs in nearly circular orbits and the galaxy experiences a nuclear

starburst of 3-11 Myr Molecular gas surface densities reach up to 500-3500
Mpc2 or 10-30 of dynamical mass in the center
12 Star formation in the center of spiral galaxies
Recent work on star formation in the central kpc of galaxies has shown
that galaxies with pseudo-bulges are more frequently the host of starbursts
Pseudo-bulges are components intermediate between spheroids and disks in
the sense of light distribution Sersic index n between 1 and 2 of attening
and kinematics more rotation than classical bulge Kormendy  Kennicutt
2004 Fisher 2006 has recently made a star-formation study on a sample of
50 galaxies observed by Spitzer Pseudo-bulges were identied on HST images
from the presence of disky structure in the center ie nuclear disks nuclear
bars and high ellipticity The star formation was traced from the PAH emis-
sion at 8 micron wavelength As shown in Fig 1 star formation inside 15 kpc
is clearly larger in pseudo-bulge galaxies and among them central starbursts
are preferentially in barred galaxies then in galaxies with oval perturbations
Nuclear star formation in the form of H nuclear rings are also preferentially
found in barred galaxies Knapen 2005 and this meeting

Gas ows and bars in galaxies
Peeples  Martini 2006 study the relation between bar strength in terms
of Qb and circumnuclear dust Dust is distributed preferentially in nuclear
rings for barred galaxies SBr galaxies are less strongly barred and have less
dust structure than SBs galaxies This can be understood as an evolutionary
process since rings are formed in a second phase in barred galaxies where
rst a spiral structure forms
13 Bar length and type b and dynamical friction
In a recent study of about 140 galaxies Erwin 2005 conrms that bars are
longer in early-types than in late-type galaxies both when normalized with
the optical radius R25 or with the exponential scale-length h see Figure 2
The size of bars does not depend on their strength
These observational results can be confronted to predictions from numer-
ical models The length of bars is tightly related to their pattern speed since
stellar orbits support the bar until its corotation only In the presence of a
large mass of dark matter inside the bar radius bars should slow down through
dynamical friction against the dark matter particles Debattista  Sellwood
2000 and bars should then be too long and slow compared to observations
This puts constraints on the dark matter distribution in spiral galaxies and
favors maximal disks But in some cases the transfer of angular momentum
to the dark halo can be minimized Valenzuela  Klypin 2003

F Combes
The length of bars is interesting under the point of view of secular evolu-
tion since it is predicted to vary along the successive evolution phases and
is then a tracer of the past history of the galaxy Bars begin their life with a
high pattern speed and a short length as in late-types and then slow down
and increase their length as in early-types This simple scenario is slightly
modied when bar destruction and reformation is taken into account with
gas accretion new bars are generally shorter They appear late-type just after
gas accretion Bournaud  Combes 2002 Tidal interactions on the contrary
can produce longer bars Holley-Bockelmann et al 2005 depending on mass
and distance of the satellites
In edge-on galaxies the length of bars can be traced by the size of the
peanut-shape The maximum height of the peanut occurs at the z-resonance
with the bar a function of its pattern speed When the bar slows down through
angular momentum transfer with the halo the radius of the resonance shifts
outwards Several peanut buckling can occur successively Martinez-Valpuesta
et al 2006
2 Bar destruction and reformation
Along the secular evolution bars are robust and long-lived features only in
pure stellar disks When gaseous disks are taken into account in numerical
simulations bars are observed to weaken and disappear eg Friedli et al
1994 Bournaud  Combes 2002 This was long attributed to the building of a
central mass concentration due to the gas inow towards the center Hasan et
al 1993 However when the central mass concentration is considered alone it
does not destroy the bar Shen  Sellwood 2004 The details of the evolution
are now much better understood gas is driven inwards by the bar torques
The gas angular momentum is taken up by the bar wave The latter has
a negative angular momentum being contained inside its corotation CR
Providing positive angular momentum to the wave is sucient to weaken or
destroy the bar since the total gas angular momentum from CR to center is
of the same order as the bar wave momentum Bournaud et al 2005a
Since it is not the central mass concentration which destroys the bar it is
relatively easy to reform a bar after a bar episode is completed Substantial
gas accretion is required to replenish the disk and to make it cold and again
unstable to bar formation Block et al 2002 Several bar episodes can then
occur in a given galaxy with a time scales of a few Gyr each provided that
the galaxy mass is doubled in 10 Gyr typically which is compatible with
cosmological accretion rates
It is interesting to note that the angular momentum transfer mediated
by the bar redistributes the mass in galaxies and produces exponential light
proles as observed in spiral galaxies Recently several exponential compo-
nents have been identied in galaxy disks separated by breaks in the density
Gas ows and bars in galaxies
proles Pohlen 2002 These could be the consequence of the past activity of
several bars along the secular evolution
Secular evolution with continuous gas accretion can also trigger starbursts
and mimick galaxy interactions Gas is accreted from CR onto the central
regions only intermittently when the bar is at its maximum strength Gaseous
nuclear disks are then formed in a short time-scale and starbursts may be
triggered Repeating starbursts have been observed in some barred galaxies
cf Allard et al 2006 In the mean time external gas continuously accreted
accumulates in the outer parts and can inow to replenish the disk only
when the bar has been weakened Just after gas accretion which is in general
asymmetric galaxies look peculiar lopsidedness and warping structures can
not only be due to galaxy-galaxy interactions but also to asymmetric mass
accretion
3 Gas accretion and m  1 perturbations
The quantication of observed bar frequency from the near-infrared images
of the OSU sample Eskridge et al 2002 has been used to put constraints
on the gas accretion rate Block et al 2002 The same can be done for the
lopsided perturbations or Fourier m  1 This asymmetrical perturbation is
very frequently observed in galaxies even in the absence of any companion
Half of the HI proles in sample of 1700 galaxies have been found asymmetric
Richter  Sancisi 1994 and these perturbations are even more frequent in
late-type galaxies Matthews et al 1998 Stellar disks also participate in those
asymmetries Zaritsky  Rix 1997 About 20 of galaxies have the normal-
ized m  1 Fourier coecient in near-infrared surface density A1 larger than
02 and in about 23 of galaxies an external mechanism is required to explain
these asymmetries that are above the expected amplitude of spontaneous in-
ternal perturbations
The inuence of companions however does not appear to be the solu-
tion most lopsided galaxies are isolated Wilcots  Prescott 2004 and when
companions are seen the A1 parameter is not correlated with the tidal in-
dex computed from the mass ratio between the observed neighbours and the
target and inversely proportional to the cube of their distance In any case
interactions cannot explain that A1 is higher in late-type galaxies Bournaud
et al 2005b External gas accretion which is likely to be asymmetric at a
given epoch is able to explain the asymmetries observed Fig 3 illustrates
the mechanism with a comparison between an observed asymmetric case and
a numerical simulation Gas accretion can explain the long life-time of the
perturbation and consequently the high frequency of lopsidedness observed
while a minor merger for instance will produce asymmetries on a much shorter
time-scale

asymmetrical gas accretion left producing a strong lopsidedness from Bournaud
et al 2005b The gas accretion rate is of 6 M yr1 and for a galactic mass of
1011 M yr1 correspond to doubling the mass of the galaxy in about one Hubble
