ABSTRACT
We analyse u  r colour distributions for several samples of galaxies in groups drawn from
the Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey For all luminosity ranges and envi-
ronments considered the colour distributions are well described by the sum of two Gaussian
functions We nd that the fraction of galaxies in the red sequence is an increasing function
of group virial mass We also study the evolution of the galaxy colour distributions at low
redshift z  018 in the eld and in groups for galaxies brighter than Mr  5 logh  20
nding signicant evidence of recent evolution in the population of galaxies in groups The
fraction of red galaxies monotonically increases with decreasing redshift this effect implies a
much stronger evolution of galaxies in groups than in the eld

1 INTRODUCTION
The galaxy population in the local universe consists broadly
of two classes of objects early and late types distinguishable
by their morphology broadband colour and star formation rate
eg Strateva et al 2001 Brinchmann et al 2004 Balogh et al
2004b Kauffmann et al 2004 The properties of early-type galax-
ies are almost independent of the environment Dressler et al 1997
Bernardi et al 2003 and there is evidence that the properties of
late-types are insensitive to the environment too Biviano et al
1990 Zandivarez et al 2006 There is also conclusive evidence
that this bi-modality exists at least out to z  1 and that the
fractions of early and late types are different compared to z  0
Bell et al 2004 Tanaka et al 2005 More recently Driver et al
2006 and Allen et al 2006 conclude that galaxy bi-modality re-
ects the two-component nature of galaxies bulge-disc rather than
two distinct galaxy populations
There are several physical processes related to environment
that can be responsible of the observed bi-modality by transform-
ing galaxies from late to early types and by truncating their SFRs
Some of them are typical of cluster environment such as ram pres-
sure Gunn  Gott 1972 galaxy harassment Moore et al 1996
and interactions with the cluster potential Byrd  Valtonen 1990
Some other processes such as galaxy mergers and interactions
should be more common in groups of galaxies where the relative
velocities of the galaxies are lower Another process that increases

the fraction of red galaxies in groups or clusters is strangulation
Balogh et al 2000 that consists in the removal of the hot gas
reservoir of in-falling galaxies so their star formation halts after
their cold gas is consumed
In the last years with the advent of large galaxy red-
shift surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS
York et al 2000 and the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Sur-
vey Colless et al 2001 several authors have studied the re-
lation between different galaxy properties and the environment
eg Lewis et al 2002 Domnguez et al 2002 Gomez et al 2003
Goto et al 2004 Tanaka et al 2004 Balogh et al 2004ab In par-
ticular Balogh et al 2004b found that at xed luminosity the
fraction of red galaxies is a strong function of projected galaxy den-
sity Baldry et al 2004 and Balogh et al 2004b have proposed a
scenario where mergers are driving the bi-modality with a red pop-
ulation resulting from merger processes and a blue population that
form stars at a rate determined by their internal physical properties
In this scenario to preserve the Gaussian nature of the colour dis-
tributions the environmentally triggered transformations from blue
to red colours should occur in a short timescale or at high redshift
Most studies have parametrised environment with the pro-
jected density of galaxies brighter than a given luminosity thresh-
old measured typically using the area containing the 5-10th nearest
neighbour As pointed out by Weinmann et al 2006 the phys-
ical meaning of this projected density depends on the environ-
ment while it measures local density in clusters in low density
regions a more global density estimate is derived by this mea-
surement There are few studies that have investigated how galaxy

properties correlate with halo mass using large group catalogues
Martnez et al 2002 found that the fraction of early type galax-
ies increases continuously from the lowest to the highest mass
groups in the Merchan  Zandivarez 2002 catalogue constructed
from the 100K release of 2dFGRS Yang et al 2005b conrmed
this result using an independent group catalogue based in the -
nal release of 2dFGRS However Tanaka et al 2004 found no
dependence of SFR and morphology on group velocity disper-
sion  when analysing galaxies in groups identied in the rst
data release of SDSS Consistently with this Balogh et al 2004b
found no trend of the fraction of red galaxies with  in clusters
Some of the most recent works on the subject agree that galaxy
properties and halo mass are indeed correlated Weinmann et al
2006 analyse the dependence of colour star formation and mor-
phology on halo mass in a group catalogue constructed from the
second data release of SDSS using the algorithm by Yang et al
2005a By splitting galaxies into early intermediate and late-
types according to their colour and specic star formation rate
they nd that at xed luminosity the fraction of early type galaxies
is a smooth increasing function of halo mass Martnez  Muriel
2006 have shown that colour is the galaxy property that correlates
best with group mass using the group catalogue by Zandivarez et al
2006 constructed from the fourth data release of SDSS DR4
Adelman-McCarthy et al 2006
For a better understanding of the impact of group environ-
ment on galaxy evolution it is important to trace their redshift
evolution In clusters of galaxies a strong evolution in the frac-
tion of blue galaxies was originally detected by Butcher  Oemler
1978 and later by other authors
eg Butcher  Oemler
1984 Rakos  Schombert 1995 Margoniner  de Carvalho 2000
Margoniner et al 2001 De Propris et al 2003 Evolution of
the fraction of galaxies of different morphological
has also been found in clusters
eg Dressler et al 1997
Andreon Davoust  Heim 1997 Couch et al 1998 Fasano et al
2000 Evolution in groups was reported by Allington-Smith et al
1993 They compared a sample of groups photometrically se-
lected in the vicinity of bright radio galaxies at low z  025
and intermediate 025  z  05 redshift and report evolution
of the blue galaxy fraction analogous to that observed in clusters
However eld contamination is a signicant limitation of photo-
metric data and it is not clear how the radio selection might bias
the sample of groups Robust evidence of the evolution of galaxies
in groups was found by Wilman et al 2005 by comparing an in-
termediate redshift sample at 03  z  055 from the CNOC2
survey Carlberg et al 2001 with local groups 005  z  01
in the 2PIGG catalogue Eke et al 2004 The authors found that
the fraction of passive galaxies is a strong function of environment
and luminosity and declines strongly with redshift Their results
provide indications of the effect of different mechanisms acting in
high and intermediate density regions
Making use of the large amount of galaxy data made publicly
available by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey team in their Fourth Data
Release we study in this paper how the bi-modality in the u  r
colour distribution of galaxies varies from eld galaxies to group
galaxies of different masses and seek for possible evolution in the
nearby universe z  018 This paper is organised as follows in
section 2 we describe the sample of galaxies in groups we use in
section 3 we analyse the dependence on group virial mass of the
u  r colour distribution for several luminosity dened subsamples
of galaxies its evolution at low redshift is analysed in section 4 We
summarise our results and discuss their implications in section 5
2 THE SAMPLES
The samples of galaxies used in this paper are included in the Main
Galaxy Sample MGS Strauss et al 2002 of DR4 The sample
of galaxies in groups was constructed by Zandivarez et al 2006
They identied groups of galaxies in the MGS of DR4 using the
same technique as Merchan  Zandivarez 2005 The technique
consists in a standard friend-of-friend algorithm for group identi-
cation together with a procedure to avoid the articial merging of
smaller systems in high density regions and an iterative method
to compute reliable group centre positions The resulting group
sample includes 14004 galaxy groups with at least 4 members in
the area spectroscopically surveyed by DR4 accounting for a total
of 85728 galaxies Our sample of eld galaxies consists of those
MGS DR4 galaxies that were not identied as belonging to groups
by Zandivarez et al 2006 Thus our eld sample includes some
galaxies that belong to small groups that were undetected given the
characteristics of the group nding procedure
Galaxy magnitudes were corrected for Galactic extinc-
tion following Schlegel et al 1998 absolute magnitudes were
computed assuming 0  03   07 and H0 
100 h km s1 Mpc1 and Kcorrected using the method of
Blanton et al 2003 KCORRECT version 41 All magnitudes are
in the AB system For the purpose of this work we use both Pet-
rosian and Model magnitudes Since the MGS is dened using Pet-
rosian magnitudes we use them to dene volume-limited subsam-
ples of galaxies For analysing u  r colours of galaxies we use
Model magnitudes instead since aperture photometry may include
non-negligible Poisson and background subtraction uncertainties in
the uband
3 DEPENDENCE OF THE COLOUR DISTRIBUTION ON
GROUP MASS
The colour distribution of galaxies at a given luminosity is well de-
scribed by the sum of two Gaussian distributions eg Balogh et al
2004b Baldry et al 2004 representing the blue and the red se-
quences According to Balogh et al 2004b at xed luminosity
the mean colours of both populations are nearly independent of the
galaxy surface density In contrast the fraction of galaxies in the
red population strongly correlates with surface density but not with
cluster velocity dispersion This seems to be difcult to reconcile
with the results by Martnez et al 2002 Yang et al 2005b and
Weinmann et al 2006 In order to study in detail the evidence for
differences in galaxy evolution in the group group environment and
shed light on the processes governing this evolution in this section
we explore the colour bi-modality of galaxies in groups of different
virial masses and compare it to the corresponding colour distribu-
tion of eld galaxies
For studying the ur colour distribution of galaxies in groups
and in the eld we restrict our samples to z  0055 This
choice guarantees a volume limited sample of galaxies down to
Mr  5 logh  190 We then divide the galaxies into 5 lu-
minosity bins
 L1  195  Mr  5 logh  190
 L2  200  Mr  5 logh  195
 L3  205  Mr  5 logh  200
 L4  215  Mr  5 logh  205 and
 L5  Mr  5 logh  215
In order to characterise the dependence of the distributions on

rameters in equation 1
The colour distribution for each subsample and its correspond-
ing best-tting two-Gaussian function are shown in Figure 1 We
conrm previous ndings that a two-Gaussian model is a good
parametrisation of the observed colour distribution in all cases
Clearly the colour distribution depends on both luminosity and en-

that represents the blue population while right column displays the corre-
sponding values for the red population In both columns top panels show

tom panels the colours cb and cr Open circles and dotted lines correspond

triangles and long dashed lines to L3 galaxies open squares and dot-long
dashed lines to L4 galaxies and lled squares and continuous lines to L5
galaxies Notice the lack of blue population galaxies in the highest luminos-
ity bin
vironment It is noticeable that the peak of the red galaxy popu-
lation becomes more prominent in groups of increasing mass and
for brighter galaxies Another feature that varies among the differ-
ent subsamples is the amplitude and position of the blue peak It
differs signicantly between eld and groups This peak weakens
with mass and reddens from fainter to brighter galaxies and from
low to high group mass
In Figure 2 we show the best-tting parameters corresponding
to these distributions as a function of group virial mass Notice that
we do not show the parameters corresponding to the blue sequence
for L5 galaxies since this sequence is absent in groups of masses
M2 and M3 as can be seen in Figure 1 The parameters trends
become clearer in this gure As a function of group mass and for
all luminosities considered here we nd that
 the amplitude of the blue sequence Ab decreases the width
b is broadly consistent with no variation and the mean colour cb
reddens
 on the other hand the amplitude of the red sequence Ar
strongly increases r decreases and the mean colour cr reddens
except for L5 galaxies in which case it is consistent with no varia-
tion with mass
In Figure 3 we show the fraction of galaxies in the red sequence
as a function of group virial mass for L14 galaxies As pointed

mass Open circles and dotted lines correspond to L1 galaxies open trian-
gles and short dashed lines to L2 galaxies lled triangles and long dashed
lines to L3 galaxies and open squares and dot-long dashed lines to L4
galaxies
out above the colour distribution of L5 galaxies is consistent with
no blue sequence for the higher mass bins Clearly the fraction of
red galaxies is a growing function of group mass for the remaining
luminosities Over the whole range of masses considered here the
fraction of galaxies in the red sequence grows by 22 for L1 13
for L2 13 for L3 and 4 for L4 galaxies
2002 Weinmann et al
Our ndings are in qualitative agreement with the re-
sults by Martnez et al
2006 and
Martnez  Muriel 2006 On the other hand they disagree with
the results by Balogh et al 2004b and Tanaka et al 2004 al-
though these authors consider velocity dispersion instead of mass
However unlike Weinmann et al 2006 we do nd a dependence
of the mean colour of both sequences with mass This could be
due to the fact that we use u  r colour instead of g  r and u-
band ux is a much better indicator of star formation than gband
ux Also different ways of splitting galaxies into early and late
types could make the difference between Weinmann et al 2006
results and ours The observed dependence of the mean colour of
each sequence on group mass agrees with Balogh et al 2004b re-
sults who nd similar changes with local density particularly for
the blue sequence
We have repeated our analysis by xing the Gaussian widths
given their lack of strong variation with mass The results are es-
sentially the same indicating the robustness of our conclusions
4 EVOLUTION OF THE COLOUR DISTRIBUTION
In this section we explore the presence of evolution of galaxy
colours at low redshift and its dependence on environment We re-
strict our samples to those luminosities that allow the construction
of volume-limited subsamples of galaxies with a number of objects
large enough that allow splitting into at least 3 bins in redshift that
in turn contain enough objects for a good statistics We restrict
our analysis to the low redshift evolution of the colour of galaxies
brighter than Mr  5 logh  20 that is L3 L4 and L5 galax-
ies For each of these subsamples we have computed the colour
distributions within different redshift limits z  009 for L3 galax-
ies z  012 for L4 and z  018 for the L5 subsample That is
we investigate the evolution of L345 galaxies in the last 14 19
and 26h1 Gyr respectively In order to have robust statistics we
only use two mass subsamples the low mass subsample compris-
ing galaxies in groups with virial masses Mvir  10135 h1 M
and a high mass subsample including those galaxies in groups with
Mvir  10135 h1 M These two mass bins correspond approx-
imately to dividing the sample at the peak of the group virial mass
distribution
We nd in all cases that the two-Gaussian model is a good
description of the colour distribution We show the best-tting pa-
rameters as a function of redshift for galaxies in the eld in groups
and in the high mass subsample in Figures 4 and 5 Along with the
trends found for luminosity and group mass in the previous sub-
section there appear here some interesting trends as a function of
redshift Regarding the blue sequence Figure 4 the most signi-
cant change is that in massive groups the amplitude increases with
redshift The trends for b are noisy and in most cases consistent
with no evolution with the exception of L5 galaxies for which the
sequence gets broader with increasing redshift The mean colour
cb evolves with z for L3 and L4 galaxies being bluer in the past
The evolution with redshift is much stronger for the red sequence
Figure 5 The amplitude of the red sequence is a decreasing func-
tion of redshift much more prominent in galaxy groups than in the
eld In all cases the red sequence gets broader with redshift and
its mean colour gets slightly bluer
The colour distribution of galaxies in groups signicantly dif-
fers from that corresponding to eld galaxies for all redshifts con-
sidered It should be taken into account that an important frac-
tion of red galaxies in eld samples are actually galaxies be-
longing to small groups that might have not been identied by
Zandivarez et al 2006 because some of the other group members
are fainter than the limiting apparent magnitude of the SDSS spec-
troscopic survey Therefore the actual differences between eld
and group should be even more signicant for the higher redshift
bins We have tested the stability of our results by restricting the
groups to a subsample with at least 6 members The analysis of this
subsample gives essentially the same results than that of the total
group sample indicating the lack of low number statistic biases as
well as possible dependences on the number of members
In Figure 6 we show the fraction of galaxies in the red se-
quence as a function of redshift It is clear that in groups these
fractions increase with cosmic time even when we are consider-
ing a small redshift range We also notice the remarkable different
behaviour of eld and massive group galaxies While the former
show almost no changes group galaxies exhibit a very signicant
decrease of the red population towards higher redshifts This result
is in agreement with Wilman et al 2005 comparison of nearby
groups from the 2PIGG catalogue at z  01 with groups at
03  z  055 from the CNOC2 survey It is worth emphasising
that in this work we have found statistically signicant evolution
in the recent  26h1Gyr past made possible by the improved
statistics of the larger number of galaxies in DR4

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have used one of the largest sample of groups available iden-
tied in the SDSS DR4 by Zandivarez et al 2006 to study the
colour distribution of galaxies in groups its dependence on lumi-
nosity and group mass and its evolution at low z  018 redshift
We have found that for all subsamples of galaxies in groups
analysed the u  r model colour distribution is well tted by the
sum of two Gaussian distributions that can be used to divide the
galaxies into a blue and a red population The colour distributions
strongly depend on galaxy luminosity and on parent group virial
mass We have also found that the fraction of galaxies in the red
sequence is a function of group mass
For galaxies brighter than Mr  5 logh  20 we have
studied the evolution of the colour distribution at low z  018
redshift nding signicant evidence of an increase on the fraction
of red galaxies with cosmic time in groups in the last  26h1
Gyr This effect is stronger for groups more massive than M 
10135h1M in stark contrast to the lack of evolution observed
in eld galaxies over the same period Our results are consistent
with the idea that the global evolution of galaxies for example the
observed decline of the SFR since z  1 eg Cowie et al 1996
takes place primarily in high density dynamically evolved regions
such as groups and clusters
We have presented evidence that the processes that transform
galaxies from late to early types have been more effective in groups
of increasing mass than in the eld and that they have been ef-
ciently acting on galaxies in the last  26h1 Gyr These nd-
ings could be used to constrain semi-analytic of galaxy formation
providing important clues to the mechanisms driving the observed
colour evolution As derived from our work the u  r colour dis-
tribution is well described by the sum of two Gaussian functions
for the range of galaxy luminosities and host group mass analysed
within the redshift range explored To preserve this form processes
that transform galaxies should occur in short timescales as dis-
cussed by Balogh et al 2004b see also Baldry et al 2004 In
these studies the authors propose that the main process driving this
evolution is merging Groups are probably the best environment
for mergers given the high density and the relatively low galaxy
velocity dispersion The results by Zandivarez et al 2006 give
additional support to this idea by showing that the characteristic
luminosity of galaxies in groups is an increasing function of halo
mass and that this behaviour is due to changes in the characteristic
luminosity of galaxies in the red sequence
We conclude that there has been a signicant difference in
galaxy colour evolution in groups in the last  3Gyr The observed
evolution is stronger in the more massive galaxy groups where the
relative fraction the most luminous galaxies Mr  5 logh 
215 in the red sequence increases from  60 to 90 com-
pared to a roughly constant fraction of 40 in the eld
