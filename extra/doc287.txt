ABSTRACT
Interacting galaxies favor the formation of star clusters but are also suspected to aect
their evolution through an intense and rapidly varying tidal eld Treating this complex
behaviour remains out-of-reach of semi-analytical studies By computing the tidal
eld from galactic models and including it into star-by-star N -body simulations of star
clusters we monitor the structure and mass evolution of a population of clusters in
a galaxy major merger taking the Antennae galaxies NGC 403839 as a prototype
On the long timescale  109 yr the merger only indirectly aects the evolution of
clusters by modifying their orbits in or around the galaxies the mass-loss of clusters
in the merger remnant is faster while clusters ejected in the tidal debris survive much
longer compared to in an isolated galaxy The tidal perturbations of the galactic
collisions themselves are too short lived and not strong enough to signicantly inuence
the structure and dissolution of realistically densemassive star clusters

INTRODUCTION
pioneer work
1972 many studies
Toomre  Toomre
focussed on
the role of mergers on galaxy evolution among many
others see Elmegreen et al 1993 Bournaud et al 2008
Lotz et al 2008 Hydrodynamical simulations explored
the process of star formation Kravtsov  Gnedin 2005
with the goal of
interpreting the observational data of
Ultra- Luminous Infra-Red Galaxies and formation of
star clusters often detected shortly after a major merger
Ashman  Zepf 1992 Brodie  Strader 2006
Numerical simulations conrmed indeed that galaxy-galaxy
interactions could signicantly increase the star cluster
formation rate eg Di Matteo et al 2007 Karl et al 2010
Teyssier et al 2010 However at the stage of the conversion
of gas into stellar material a star-by-star exploration in
a full galactic context but also the subsequent dynamical
evolution remain technically out-of-reach
However the fate of these clusters after their for-
mation remains uncertain This is because an evapo-
ratingdissolving cluster in a galaxy beyond the local
group leaves no clear observational signature for us to
nd Numerical studies are challenged because they must
account for a wide range of scales
from the internal

dynamics of clusters ie binary stars and close encounters
to the scale of galactic interactions This issue has been
circumvented by simplifying either one or the other side of
the problem On the one hand an idealized galaxy with
an analytical description of the tides has been intensively
used to improve our understanding of the dynamical
evolution of non-isolated clusters eg Vesperini  Heggie
1997 Baumgardt  Makino 2003 Penarrubia et al 2009
Kupper et al
Webb et al 2013 On the other a semi-analytical descrip-
tion of star clusters in a cosmological context allowed to
probe the eect of complex tides on stellar populations eg
Prieto  Gnedin 2008 Kruijssen et al 2011
2010 Berentzen  Athanassoula
Recently Renaud Gieles  Boily
2011 hereafter
RGB11 merged the two approaches by integrating any tidal
eect into N -body simulations of star clusters allowing for
the exploration of the evolution of star clusters within com-
plex time-dependent galactic potentials like those of merg-
ers The goal of this Lettre is to apply this method to a
large number of clusters in rapidly-varying tidal elds and
to derive the dierences in their evolution and dissolution
rate between isolated galaxies and mergers Our approach
focusses rst on a few cases to better understand the phys-
ical phenomenon of dissolution itself and then on an entire
population of stars clusters This work does not intent to
reproduce realistic clusters but rather to shed light on the
physical eect of complex time-evolving tides leaving aside
Renaud  Gieles
for the time being other aspects like mass segregation and
stellar evolution
2 METHODOLOGY
21 Numerical method
The evolution of our cluster models is computed with the
NBODY6tt widely based on NBODY6 Aarseth 2003
Nitadori  Aarseth 2012 and presented in RGB11 and
briey summarised here First a simulation of a galaxy is
performed each particle represents a possible star cluster
This step can be done using any type of gravitational code
eg tree-code One particle is followed along its orbit and
the associated tidal tensors are extracted see Renaud et al
2008 providing a complete space and time description of
the tides for this cluster candidate Next in a second sim-
ulation NBODY6tt creates a star-by-star N -body model of
a star cluster reads the tensors interpolates them in time
computes the tidal forces at the positions of the N stars
of the cluster and adds them to the internal gravitational
force due to the N  1 other stars A signicant fraction of
the computation is speed-up thanks to the use of Graphics
Processing Units GPUs Details and tests can be found in
RGB11 In this Lettre we repeat this exercise by considering
various orbits of clusters ie various tidal elds in a merger
and in an isolated galaxy To focus on the tidal eect and on
the dissolution of the cluster population we do not include
any prescription on the formation of our clusters In total
724 N -body simulations have been run on the GPU cluster
Curie hosted at the Tres Grand Centre de Calcul TGCC
22 Galaxies orbits and clusters
tensors using
computed the
tree-code
along several orbits in a purely gravitational model of
NGC 4038 The method and simulation details are given
in Renaud et al 2008 This galaxy has been modeled both
in isolation and with its equal-mass companion NGC 4039
the pair reproducing the morphology and kinematics of the
Antennae galaxies This allows a direct comparison between
the isolated galaxy and the major merger
As the galactic collisions proceed the tidal history gets
punctuated by events corresponding to the impact of the
two galaxies These events however are independent of the
intrinsic evolution of the clusters itself paced by two-body
relaxation Henon 1961 Gieles et al 2010 To avoid any
articial synchronisation between the galaxy and the clus-
ter we start the integration of the cluster models at dierent
times with respect to the collisions ie at dierent positions
along the orbits This way our sample comprises an entire
population of young intermediate and old clusters How-
ever all the simulations are stopped 5 Gyr after the rst
galactic pericenter passage for longer timelapses cosmolog-
ical aspects stepping in the galaxy evolution should be taken
into account which is out of the scope of the present study
With 32 orbits and ve birth epochs along them we can
monitor histories representative of all cases observed in a
merger clusters conned to the galaxy nucleus or ejected
1 httpirfuceafrPisporentrenaudnbody6ttphp
in the close vicinity of the central region in tidal bridges or
tails falling back and orbiting the remnant or being deni-
tively ejected in the intergalactic medium and this at dier-
ent stages of their evolution Half of the 32 orbits have been
selected to be conned to the galactic disc before the inter-
action occurs while the others reach positions in the stellar
halo above and below the plane of the disc on very inclined
orbits The maximum apocenter corresponds to the radius
of the stellar disc 20 kpc such that our survey represents
a full range of orbital energies see Section 32
For simplicity in each cluster all stars have been given
the same mass 1 M to avoid mass segregation and stel-
lar evolution eects and to focus on the tides The initial
positions and velocities of the stars were based on a viri-
alised Plummer 1911 model On each orbit and for each
birth epoch we set up clusters with dierent masses and
densities obtained either by changing the initial number N0
of stars per cluster from 4000 to 32000 for a virial radius
rv  1 pc or by changing rv down to 05 pc for a given
N0 The half-mass densities vary from 103 to 104 M pc3
which makes our models comparable in mass and density to
Westerlund 1 NGC 3603 or even the Arches for the dens-
est ones Portegies Zwart et al 2010 However because of
early evolution the densities get lower down to two orders
of magnitude in the extreme case at the time of the galactic
interaction
3 RESULTS
By looking at the mass evolution curves of all individual
clusters in our survey we found shows that every case is
unique However it is possible to extract families of clusters
sharing a similar tidal history
31 Individual cases
First in Fig 1 we show two orbits from our survey in order
to analyse typical situations that may occur at galactic scale
and their implications for the clusters Only the simulations
with a birth epoch of  15 Gyr before the rst pericentre
passage are shown here for the sake of clarity but the other
runs give comparable results
On the top row case panels abc1 the orbital eccen-
tricity is rapidly increased from  005 to  030 by the
galactic collision However the trajectory remains closed and
fairly regular The resulting mass evolution shows the typ-
ical staircase decline the mass-loss becoming more rapid
at small galactocentric radii because of strong gravitational
tides and a signicant centrifugal force The amplitude of
this periodically accelerated mass-loss increases with low-
mass clusters This is also found for eccentric orbits eg
Baumgardt  Makino 2003 RGB11 Despite these short-
period  108 yr changes induced by the merger the sec-
ular evolution of this cluster does not strongly dier from
that it has in an isolated disc dashed lines on Fig 1 In
that sense the merger does not aect the mass-loss rate
of clusters on this particular orbit In Section 32 we show
that this is not a representative example in fact because the
mass-loss rate of clusters that remain bound to the merger
remnant increases on average
On the contrary the orbit of our second example panels

galactic simulation
abc2 is much more altered by the galactic collision At the
rst galactic pericentre passage t  0 the orbit follows the
creation and expansion of a galactic tidal tail and does not
fall back into the nucleus Being in a shallow potential the
clusters on this trajectory experience a very weak tidal eld
and thus a slow mass-loss the mass-loss rate for t  03 Gyr
is comparable to that of an isolated cluster ie most escape
happens because of close encounters in the core rather than
a relaxation driven evaporation over the tidal boundary
whereas in the isolated disc the orbit remains bound and the
clusters dissolve in a few 109 yr In this case the merger
protects the clusters by sending them to a zone of weaker
32 Cluster population
To generalise these results we now consider all our clusters
but tell apart two sub-populations the clusters always stay-
ing within 20 kpc from the center of the galaxy ie about
the radius of the isolated disc and the others ejected to
the tidal debris About 30 of the orbits fall in this sec-
ond category which corresponds to the stellar mass fraction
lost by the progenitor galaxies of the Antennae during the
interaction This demonstrates that our sample of orbits is
statistically representative For the isolated disc this dis-

apart the clusters ejected to large galactocentric radii by the
galaxy-galaxy collision solid thick line from those remaining
close to the center solid thin line The dashed lines represent
all the clusters in the isolated disc and the dotted lines denotes
the mass-loss without tides As in Fig 1 the colour indicates the
initial mass of the cluster
tinction is not made since all the clusters remain bound to
their host galaxy
321 Mass-loss
Fig 2 shows the average mass for the two groups and for
two birth epochs The staircase behaviour is smoothed
out because all the orbits in our sample which might ex-
hibit it are not synchronised As expected from the exam-
ple of the previous Section the ejected clusters thick solid
line live much longer as the tidal eld they experience is
weaker than in the merger remnant and the isolated galaxy
The knees in their mass evolution marking a change of tidal
regime occur at rst pericentre passage when the tidal tails
are created However at that time the non-ejected clus-
ters only experience the eect of the cumulated potentials
of the two galaxies before they separate and fall-back onto
each other which is too short-lived to signicantly aect
the mass-loss see Section 33 However at the nal coales-
cence t  03 Gyr the curve of the mass evolution yields
a sharp knee Contrarily to the particular case presented in
the top row of Fig 1 on average the mass of the non-ejected
clusters decreases much more rapidly in the merger than in
the isolated disc Clusters in the central region of a merger
remnant are very likely to dissolve faster within a few Gyr
for the masses considered here than in an isolated galaxy
partly because of an increased average orbital eccentricity
from 009  003 before the rst collision to 039  012 after
the merger
Finally Fig 3 compares the evolution of the mass of
the entire population of a galaxy independently of the clus-
ter density mass or birth epoch but still telling apart the
ejected clusters tidal debris from those staying in the rem-
nant The pre-merger history t  0 is not shown here
because it encompasses the articial creation of clusters
at arbitrary times and thus is not physically relevant for

of tidal histories since the rst galactic collision The mass is
normalized to its value at the rst pericenter passage The number
in parenthesis is the characteristic timescale  of the exponential
decay of the mass M  et 
our comparisons In all cases the average mass decays as
M  et up to a very late stage of the evolution The
dissolution rate 1 of the population in the tidal debris is
comparable yet a bit higher to that of the tide-free clusters
and  4 times lower than in the merger remnant The iso-
lated galaxy exhibits an intermediate dissolution rate twice
lower than that of the merger remnant From the results
in Fig 3 we thus conclude that the average mass-loss rate
increases for clusters that remain bound to the merger rem-
nant For some clusters the mass-loss stays comparable eg
the example in the top panel of Fig 1 but it increases for
a majority of clusters
322 Structural evolution
In this Section we focus on the structural changes along
the evolution of our models Gieles et al 2011 explained
that after a relaxation-driven expansion phase clusters in a
constant tidal eld experience a contraction phase In Fig 4
we show that clusters in time-varying elds also experience a
comparable two-phase evolution The transition from expan-
sion to contraction occurs half-way the lifetime of the clus-
ter as predicted by Gieles et al 2011 for steady tides This
demonstrates that the variations of the tidal eld  108 yr
ie rapid compared to the lifetime of the cluster  109 yr
do not modify qualitatively the behaviour from what is ex-
pected in constant tides
As noted above the clusters remaining in the central
region of the merger thin solid lines experience stronger
tides than in the isolated galaxy dashed lines which makes
their contraction more important The clusters ejected into
the tidal debris thick solid lines follow a quasi tide-free
evolution and thus miss the tidally-driven contraction phase
In Fig 5 we plot the evolution of the half-mass radius of
one cluster set on the orbit shown in Fig 1 bottom panels
At the time of the rst collision the expansion phase of this
cluster is over and the contraction has just begun However
Figure 4 Evolution of the half-mass radius of our clusters The
curves are stopped when the corresponding average normalized
mass is less than 015 making the half-mass radius very Poisson-
noisy Colors and linestyles are as in Fig 2
Figure 5 Evolution of the half-mass radius of a cluster sent in
the tidal debris one cluster of the group shown by the blue solid
thick line in Fig 4 The new tidal regime starting at t  0 allows
for a resumption of the expansion phase and leads to an extended
cluster
the sudden change of tidal regime due to the ejection to the
tidal tails stops the contraction and allows for a much longer
expansion
33 Role of collisions
In the previous Section we showed the indirect changes im-
plied by the merger on its population through orbital mix-
ing ie a long-term eect However the tides are expected
to have their maximum inuence at the time of the galac-
tic pericenter passages when the gravitational potentials of
the still undisturbed galaxies most overlap At the collision
t  0 the velocity dierence between the two galaxies
is  200 km s1 therefore a signicant fraction of their
masses overlaps for a comparable or shorter timelapse than
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
The role of galaxy mergers on the evolution of star clusters
the crossing times of our clusters  10 100 Myr Further-
more it should be noted that the geometry of the mergers
does not necessarily account for a global strengthening of
the tides one galaxy can locally compensates for the tides
of the other by attening the gravitational potential2 In
short during the collision the tidal eld could be locally
weaker than expected but above all the combination of the
eects of the two galaxies is short-lived compared to the
crossing time of their clusters
In our survey the more fragile clusters loose only 
2 of their current mass during the rst galactic colli-
sion For instance the clusters like that of Fig 5 have an
initial half-mass density of 1000 M pc3 which becomes
 10 M pc3 at the time of the collision Even on such
low density objects the direct eect of the collision is very
mild It is visible in the mass-loss curves see the blue curves
in Fig 1a1 and Fig 3 around t  0 but is negligible with
respect to the classical rapid mass-loss observed when the
cluster reaches the pericenter of its orbit ie the steep part
of the staircase shape mentioned above Although the
orbital changes occurring in the merger remnant makes a
similar analysis much more dicult at the second collision
t  03 Gyr we expect qualitatively this behaviour to re-
peat itself In ne the galactic collisions themselves have no
direct impact on the mass-loss of clusters
4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
We have studied the tidal eect of a galaxy major merger
on its population of star clusters Our main ndings are
 the mass-loss rate of the clusters that remain bound to
the merger remnant is higher than before the nal coales-
cence phase The clusters populating the tidal debris survive
much longer similarly to tide-free cases
 the two-phases evolution of expansion and contraction
of a cluster also exists in complex time-varying tidal elds
The structural evolution does not strongly deviate from that
of a constant tides case
 at the time of the galactic collisions the tides are too
weak although they reach their maximum intensity and
too short-lived  1078 yr to have a signicant inu-
ence on the clusters However by modifying the orbit of
the clusters they indirectly aect their mass-loss over long
timescales
By focussing on tidal eects we have not considered
stellar evolution which inuences the evolution of the mass
and the structure of clusters Stellar evolution causes clus-
ters to expand faster in the rst few 100 Myr making clus-
ters less dense and possibly more vulnerable to tidal forces
However because in this study we have considered clusters
with dierent physical ages some of which already reached
the tidal density before the merger we do not expect that
our overall conclusions will be aected by the inclusion of
stellar evolution
2 In the idealised case of two point-mass galaxies the eective
potential has a saddle point where the tidal forces balance the
gravitation of the cluster For more complex galaxies this situa-
tion may occur over larger volumes depending on the shape of
the potential and the geometry of the encounter
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Furthermore we have not taken the formation of the
clusters into account High resolution hydrodynamical sim-
ulations of the same galaxy model Teyssier et al 2010 re-
veal that the star formation activity increases by a factor up
to  20 shortly after the pericentre passages when the tur-
bulent interstellar medium is properly resolved However
galaxy-scale simulations still treat star formation through
subgrid recipes and most of them lack the resolution to
properly describe the initial state of clusters For theses rea-
sons our approach decouples the dissolution of the clusters
from their formation considering separately the artifacts
from both sides Hence our results do not represent the
age or mass functions of clusters but their mass-loss rate
Studying the formation sites of the objects presented here
 1034 M clusters in a fully consistent galactic context
by resolving star forming cores and the stellar feedback down
to  1 pc is our next step Renaud et al in prep
