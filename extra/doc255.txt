Abstract
We investigate the star formation history and chemical evolution of Low Surface Brightness
LSB spiral galaxies by means of their observed spectro-photometric and chemical properties We
present preliminary results for Johnson-Cousins UBVRI magnitudes and stellar OH abundance
ratios using a galactic chemical evolution model incorporating a detailed metallicity dependent set
of stellar input data covering all relevant stages of stellar evolution Comparison of our model results
with observations conrms the idea that LSB galaxies are relatively unevolved systems However
we argue that recent and ongoing massive star formation plays an important role in determining the
colours of many LSB spirals We briey discuss these results in the context of the spectral evolution
of spiral galaxies in general
1 Observations
Low Surface Brightness spiral galaxies LSBs are generally late-type galaxies with blue central surface bright-
nesses fainter than 23 mag arcsec2 They usually display ill-dened spiral arms in the optical and contain
only a few bright Hii regions Comparison of the chemical and optical properties of LSBs and HSB spirals
reveals that LSBs are on average less luminous bluer metal-decient and more extended than HSBs 1 4
Furthermore LSBs have lower Hi surface densities and smaller dynamical masses within their optical radii than
their HSB counterparts 2 In this paper we investigate the spectro-photometric and chemical properties of
LSBs by means of a detailed galactic evolution model
2 Model assumptions
We concentrate on the stellar contribution to the total galaxy luminosity in a given passband other contributions
are neglected For a given star formation history SFR we compute the chemical enrichment of a model galaxy
by successive generations of evolving stars To derive the stellar luminosity in a given passband at a given age
we use an up-to-date metallicity dependent set of theoretical stellar isochrones as well as a library of spectro-
photometric data The spectro-photometric properties of the model galaxy are calculated by integrating the
stellar luminosities at a given galactic age weighted with the SFR at the time these stars were born 6
3 Results
We show in Fig 1 model results for an exponentially decaying SFR exptsfr with sfr  5 Gyr appro-
priate for the Galactic disk We followed the chemical and spectro-photometric evolution of the model galaxy
during the last 14 Gyr A power-law IMF slope 235 and initial stellar mass limits of 01 and 60 M have
been assumed

4 Discussion and conclusion
We nd that the colours and abundances of HSBs can be reasonably well explained by the decaying SFR
model ending at a current gas-to-total mass-ratio of  01 deviation from individual HSBs is partly due
to the eects of dust-extinction However colours and OH abundances predicted by the same models are
inconsistent with observational data of LSBs within the B-magnitude range appropriate for LSBs These models
clearly demonstrate that LSBs must have experienced their dominant episode of star formation much later in
their evolution than HSBs Furthermore LSBs show OH abundances considerably smaller than expected
for values of  015 which are suggested by the observations This may indicate that 1 LSBs experience
predominantly star formation out of metal-decient material not participating in the chemical enrichment of
the disk andor 2 LSBs have much larger ratios  than observed Since detailed observations appear to rule
out the second possibility 2 we conclude that metal-decient gas infall is important in LSBs In this case
recent and ongoing star formation in LSBs is required to maintain  as low as 015
