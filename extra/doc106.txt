1 INTRODUCTION
In the last decade our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution grew dramatically thanks to the
coming out of a theoretical framework for structure formation within the cosmological context the ination-
inspired cold dark matter scenario CDM and to the great observational progress in particular the imagery
and spectroscopy of high redshift galaxies Nevertheless the fundamental questions of galaxy formation and
evolution still await answers The symbiosis of theory and observations is crucial in this eld in order to connect
what we see at dierent redshifts with the evolution of a given population of galaxies
Most of the galaxies observed in the local universe are disk galaxies An important question is how the
structural dynamical and luminosity properties of this population of galaxies evolved and how much they
contributed in the past to global quantities such as the star formation SF rate and luminosity per unit of
volume Were the galaxy disks smaller and their surface brightness SB higher than at present Which is the
SF history of disk galaxies Were these galaxies brighter and bluer in the past Did the luminosity-velocity
Tully-Fisher relation change in the past A powerful theoretical tool for studying these questions related to
the evolution of local and global properties of disk galaxies is the combination of inductive backward galaxy
evolutionary models with initial and boundary conditions calculated from the hierarchical formation scenario
Avila-Reese Firmani  Hernandez 1998 Avila-Reese  Firmani 2000 Firmani  Avila-Reese 2000 In this
paper we present some of the evolution predictions of these seminumerical models and we discuss them in
light of the available observational data
2 DISK GALAXY EVOLUTIONARY MODELS IN THE HIERARCHICAL SCENARIO
Disk galaxies are dynamically fragile objects This is why at a rst approximation we obviate the disk
major mergers in their evolution and considering that disks grow inside-out gently with a gas accretion rate
proportional to the hierarchical mass aggregation rate A major advantage of our seminumerical models is that
we follow locally the overall evolution of individual disks in centrifugal equilibrium including star formation
SF and feedback in the disk ISM and luminosity evolution At each epoch the growing disk is characterized

by a local infall rate of fresh gas a gas and stellar surface density prole a local SF rate a color prole and
a rotation curve including the dark matter component The disks form with the baryon mass fraction within
the growing dark halos The angular momentum of each collapsing mass shell is calculated using the spin
parameter  obtained in numerical and analytical works The local SF is induced by a gravitational instability
Toomre criterion and it is self-regulated by an energy balance in the ISM along the vertical disk direction
The eciency of SF in this model is almost independent of the mass luminosity
The main physical factors which inuence most of the local and global properties of our model galaxies
and their correlations are the mass mass aggregation history MAH and spin parameter  These
factors and their statistical distribution are related to the cosmological initial conditions For a quick review of
the main disk galaxy properties and correlations predicted at z  0 for a typical CDM model see Avila-Reese
et al 2000 the results in detail are presented in the papers mentioned above
3 EVOLUTIONARY PREDICTIONS
31 Star formation rate and luminosity evolution
The SF rate in our hierarchical models is driven by both the gas accretion rate determined by the
MAH and the disk surface density determined by 
In Fig 1a and 1b we show the average
hierarchical mass aggregation rate of halos of dierent masses and the corresponding SF rates histories for
  005 respectively less massive galaxies assemble faster than the massive ones The correlation between
MAH and SF history is evident In Fig 1b we also show the SF histories for 5 1011M models with two
extreme MAHs early active and extended MAHs upper and lower dashed lines and   005 The
inuence of  on the SF history is clearly seen in Fig 1c where we plotted 5 1011M models with   003
upper short- dashed line and   01 lower short-dashed line and the average MAH in both cases The
upper and lower dot-dashed lines correspond to extreme models with an early active MAH and   003 and
with an extended MAH and   01 respectively
A strong prediction of our disk galaxy models due mainly to the hierarchical MAHs is the shape of the SF
rate history with a gentle maximum at z  15  25 for most of the cases and a relatively quick fall towards
the present by factors  2  4 on the average From an observational study for large disk galaxies rB  4h1
Lilly et al 1998 have found the SF rate to decrease likely a factor 25  35 between z  07 and z  0
h05 For our corresponding models since z  07 the SF rate decreased a factor  2 on average However
for models with small  ie very high SB galaxies this factor is  3 It is possible that galaxy samples at
dierent redshifts suer from a signicant SB selection eect since disk galaxies as our and other model results
show change the SB distribution with z Bouwens  Silk 2000 Therefore the factor Lilly et al 1998 nd
could be biased towards HSB galaxies in agreement with our galaxy models
Deep eld studies show that the global cosmic SF history per unit of volume from z  0 to 07 increased
by a factor  6 and by more than a factor of 10 up to the maximum which is attained at z  15  20 eg
Madau Pozzetti  Dickinson 1998 and the references therein If our models actually describe the evolution
of normal disk galaxies which dominate the global SF rate today then the increment of a factor  10 detected
at  15  2 could not have been produced only by disk galaxies Other galaxy populations had to contribute
to the global SF rate in the past eg Babul  Fergurson 1996
Since the Bband luminosity LB is a tracer of young and intermediate stellar populations its evolution
should be similar to the SF history We nd indeed that LB increases towards the past and more quickly for
the less massive galaxies At z  1 LB is  15 times larger than at z  0 for a L galaxy The integral colors
of the galaxy models become bluer towards the past on average from z  0 to z  1 B  V  decreases by
025  03 mag Less massive galaxies undergo more color evolution this is because they attain the peak in SF
rate before than massive galaxies
32 Size and surface brightness evolution
Disk size and SB evolution are natural in the hierarchical formation scenario In the right panel of Fig 1
we show the evolution of the Bband scale radius rB for average models of 3 dierent masses using the at
CDM  h07 cosmology The size evolution is slightly more pronounced for more massive galaxies In
Fig 1 Leftt The average mass aggregation rate histories for 3 masses a and the corresponding SFHs where
  005 was used b The dashed lines are the SFHs of models with an active early upper and extended
lower MAH In panel c the dotted lines are for models with   01 upper and 003 lower see text for
more details Right Evolution of the Bband scale radius for 3 masses with the average MAH and   005
The dashed line corresponds to an observational estimate for large disk galaxies by Lilly et al 1998
this gure we also plot a rough observational estimate by Lilly et al 1998 According to theses authors for
large disk galaxies rB has grown not more than  25 since z  1
Size evolution implies SB evolution Lilly et al 1998 dashed line after correcting for some selection
eects found that the average SB of their large disk galaxies sample has grown  05 mag at z  07 with
respect to z  0 Similar results were obtained by eg Forbes et al 1996 Vogt et al 1997 Roche et
al 1998 The last authors conclude that the deep eld observations of disk galaxies can be better explained
by luminosity and size evolution models For our hierarchical models we nd slightly more pronounced SB
evolution than the observations In a more recent observational work Simard et al 1999 have found that
galaxies from z  01 to z  09 seem to increase their average SB by  13 mag However these authors
concluded that if the selection eect due to comparing low luminosity galaxies in nearby redshift bins to high
luminosity galaxies in distant bins is allowed for then no discernible evolution remains in the SB of bright disk
galaxies Using the same data of Simard et al Bouwens  Silk 2000 have derived an increase in the SB of
 15 mag This dierence is because the last authors have introduced corrections for SB selection bias that
they nd to be important due to the strong evolution in the SB distribution of disk galaxies Certainly the
disk size and SB evolution are important tests for the hierarchical formation scenario
33 Dynamics evolution of the H and Bband Tully-Fisher relations
The linking of the resolved photometric and spectroscopic data to dynamical data is crucial for the under-
standing of the evolution and physics of a given population of galaxies In our hierarchical models the mass
of the galaxy grows faster than the maximum rotation velocity Vm this is because the dense inner parts of the
dark halo are not signicantly aected by the secondary mass infall The dark halos and therefore the disks
obey a tight relation between mass and maximum circular velocity see eg Avila-Reese et al 19981999 For
our CDM cosmology we nd that the disk stellar mass-maximum rotation velocity relation Md  AV n
z  0 has a slope n  34 This relation is proportional to the Hband Tully-Fisher relation TFR The slope
AVILA-REESE AND FIRMANI
n remains almost constant with z The coecient A decreases with z ie as we said above while the mass
signicantly decreases towards the past Vm decreases only a little We nd that at z  1 A is  16 times
smaller than at z  0 or that is the same the zero-point of the Hband TFR is  05 mag higher
In the Bband the TFR evolves in an opposite way although the disk mass LH luminosity decreases
with z LB increases as we have seen in 31 This is because SF is more active in the past The slope of
the Bband TFR slightly decreases with z less massive galaxies evolve more quickly than massive ones in
particular LB increases more with z for the former than for the latter Assuming the slope constant with z
for our CDM model we obtain that the zero-point of the Bband TFR at z  1 is  07 mag lower than at
z  0 taking into account HSB and LSB galaxies ie A is  2 times larger
From the observational point of view several eorts were made in order to acquire internal kinematic Vogt
et al 1997 and more references therein and galaxy-galaxy lensing Hudson et al 1998 data for disk galaxies at
high redshifts From these works it is still dicult to draw conclusions regarding the evolution of the Bband
TFR Since the interpretation of the results is sensitive to the cosmological model assumed just in order to
evaluate the data from several of these works we used the critical model q  05 with h05 The results
of Vogt et al 1997 show that the zero-point of the Bband TFR from z  0 to the average redshift of the
sample hzi  054 has changed by MB  033 mag for the Hudson et al 1998 Simard  Pritchet 1998
and Rix et al 1997 samples hzi  06 035 and 025 and MB  10 15 and 15 mag respectively
As one sees these works seem to be at odds with one another The samples used in the last two papers
are dominated by small actively star-forming galaxies while in the two rst papers normal spiral galaxies
dominate Thus we may compare our model results with those of Vogt et al and Hudson et al papers For the
SCDM cosmology with 8  067 and h05 MB  04 mag at z  06 in fact the theoretical evolution
of the TFR is similar for both the SCDM and CDM models This strongly disagrees with observations in a
q h05 cosmology For low density or at with cosmological constant models with h 05 the observational
data are in better agreement with the models In particular in the at CDM cosmology  h07 the
data of Vogt et al give only a slightly larger value for MB than our models ie the observed zero-point at
hzi  054 is slightly less bright than our hierarchical models predict
In conclusion we nd that the hierarchical formation scenario for CDM-like models oers
robust initial and boundary conditions for disk galaxy evolution However the evolution of disk
sizes and the zero-point of the Bband TFR seems to be too exagerated with respect to some observational
data We stress that analytical approaches should take into account that the zero-point of the structural and
Bband TFRs evolve in a dierent way
