Evolution of galaxies in clusters
Bianca Poggianti
1 Introduction
The goal of this lecture is to give an overview of the state-of-the-art in the eld of galaxy
evolution in clusters and to point out the main observational milestones that a model of galaxy
formation and evolution should attempt to reproduce and explain trying to underline where the
current models succeed and where they most struggle
Understanding the role of environmental conditions in determing how galaxies are and evolve
is especially important in the context of a hierarchical cosmological scenario As structures grow
galaxies can join more and more massive structures and experience different environmental condi-
tions during their history Separating galaxy evolution into eld and cluster evolution hardly
makes sense in this scenario since a cluster galaxy today may have been a group or eld galaxy
during the earlier phases of its evolution
The physical mechanisms that are usually considered when trying to assess the inuence of
the environment on galaxy evolution can be grouped in four main families
1 Mergers and strong galaxy-galaxy interactions Toomre  Toomre 1972 Hernquist  Barnes
1991 see Mihos 2004 for a review They are most efcient when the relative velocities
between the galaxies are low thus are expected to be especially efcient in galaxy groups
2 Tidal forces due to the cumulative effect of many weaker encounters also known as harass-
ment Richstone 1976 Moore et al 1998 They are expected to be especially important
in clusters and particularly on smaller  lower mass galaxies
3 Gas stripping - Interactions between the galaxy and the inter-galactic medium IGM Gunn
 Gott 1972 Quilis et al 2000 The interstellar medium of a galaxy can be stripped via
various mechanisms including viscous stripping thermal evaporation and  the most famous
member of this family  ram pressure stripping Ram pressure can be efcient when the IGM
gas density is high and the relative velocity between the galaxy and the IGM is high These
conditions are expected to be met especially in the very central regions of cluster cores
4 Strangulation also known as starvation or suffocation Larson Tinsley  Caldwell 1980
Bower  Balogh 2004 Assuming galaxies possess an envelope of hot gas that can cool and
feed the disk with fuel for star formation the removal of such reservoir of gas is destined to
inhibit further activity once the disk gas is exhausted In semi-analytic models for example
the gas halo is assumed to be removed when a galaxy enters as satellite in a more massive
dark matter halo
Note that while stripping gas from the disk induces a truncation of the star formation activity
107 yrs strangulation is expected to affect a galaxy star formation history
on a short timescale 
on a long timescale  1 Gyr provoking a slowly declining activity which consumes the disk gas
after the supply of cooling gas has been removed
Some of these processes have en empirical motivation eg ram pressure stripping and mergers
can be observed at work while others have a more theoretical ground eg strangulation and
harassment

The former two of these families of processes affect the galaxy structure thus morphology in a
direct way the merger of two spirals can produce an elliptical galaxy and repeated tidal encounters
can change a latetype into an early-type galaxy The latter two families instead act on the gas
content of galaxies hence their star formation activity and can modify their morphologies in an
indirect way once star formation is halted in a disk this can fade signicantly the bulge-to-disk
relative importance can change and the galaxy appearance and morphology can appear signicantly

21 Galaxy morphologies and star formation activity
At the time of this School highquality data of distant clusters have been obtained with the
Advanced Camera for Surveys by several groups and results should appear soon Postman et al
2005 Desai et al in prep Here I summarize the published results which are all based on Wide
Field and Planetary Camera 2 data
Figure 1 From Dressler et al 1997 Left Morphology-density relation for 55 clusters at low redshift
Dressler 1980 Right Morphology-density relation for 4 regular clusters at z
45 Dressler et al 1997
The HST images have revealed the presence of large numbers of spiral galaxies in all distant
clusters observed in proportions that are much higher than in nearby clusters of similar richness
Dressler et al 1994 Couch et al 1994 Dressler et al 1997 This is reected also in the evolution
of the Morphology-Density MD relation The MD relation is the observed correlation between

0 the fraction of S0 galaxies at z
the frequency of the various Hubble types and the local galaxy density normally dened as the
projected number density of galaxies within an area including its closest neighbours In clusters
in the local Universe the existence of this relation has been known for a long time ellipticals
are frequent in high density regions while the fraction of spirals is high in low density regions
5 an MD relation is already present but it is
Oemler 1974 Dressler et al 1980 At z
quantitatively different from the relation at z
5 is much
lower at all densities than in clusters at z
0 Fig 1 Dressler et al 1997 The fraction of S0s in
clusters appears to increase towards lower redshifts while the proportion of spirals correspondingly
decreases Fig 2 Dressler et al 1997 Fasano et al 2000 Interestingly ellipticals are already as
abundant at z
0 These ndings strongly suggest that a signicat fraction of the S0
galaxies in clusters today have evolved from spirals at relatively recent epochs Adopting a more
conservative distinction between early-type EsS0s and late-type spirals galaxies a similar
evolution is found with the early-type fraction decreasing at higher redshifts van Dokkum et al
2000 Lubin et al 2002 First results at z
1 what changes in the MD relation is only the occurrence of early-type galaxies in the very
highest density regions Smith et al 2004
3 seem to indicate that between z
5 as at z
Figure 2 From Fasano et al 2000 Evolution of the morphological mix in clusters The fraction of
ellipticals S0 and spiral galaxies is shown for clusters between z
55 and z
Interestingly an MD relation originally found in the cluster cores has been shown to be
present across a wide range of environments in all types of clusters rich and poor concentrated
and irregular with low and high LX Dressler 1980 Balogh et al 2002a in groups Postman 
Geller 1984 and at large cluster radii Treu et al 2003 though the relation seems to vary from

rich to less rich clusters Dressler 1980 Balogh et al 2002
Comparing HST morphologies and spectroscopy it has been shown that galaxies with active
star formation in distant clusters are for the great majority spirals Dressler et al 1999 but that
the viceversa is not always true several of the cluster spirals in fact do not display any emission
line in their spectra and both their spectra and their colors indicate a lack of current star formation
activity Poggianti et al 1999 Couch et al 2001 Goto et al 2003 These passive spirals might
be an intermediate stage when starforming spirals are being transformed into passive S0 galaxies
Historically the rst evidence for a higher incidence of star-forming galaxies in distant clusters
compared to nearby clusters came from photometric studies that identied large numbers of blue
galaxies Butcher  Oemler 1978 1984 Ellingson et al 2001 Kodama  Bower 2001 Those
galaxies in distant clusters that are red and already lie on the color-magnitude sequence have instead
very old stellar populations formed at z  2
3 that have evolved passively after that Ellis et al
1997 Kodama et al 1998 Barger et al 1998 van Dokkum et al 199920002001 They are only
a subset of the galaxies that lie on the red sequence today van Dokkum  Franx 2001 but they are
easily recognizable as signposts of high density regions out to very high redshifts eg Stanford et
al 2002 Blakeslee et al 2003 De Lucia et al 2004 As we will see in Sec 22 the fraction of
galaxies involved in the evolution from blue to red doesnt depend only on redshift but strongly
also on galaxy mass
Compared to colors spectroscopy is a more direct way to identify galaxies with ongoing star
formation For distant galaxies the Ha
line is redshifted at optical wavelengths that are severely af-
fected by sky or is observed in the near-IR thus the feature most commonly used is the OIIl 3727
In the MORPHS sample of 10 clusters at z

5 the fraction of emissionline galaxies
1 Dressler et al 1999 Poggianti et al
3 this fraction is about 25
1999 In the CNOC cluster sample at an average redshift z
Balogh et al 1999 This incidence is much higher than it is observed in similarly rich clusters
0 Dressler Thompson  Shectman 1988 Signicant numbers of emission-line galaxies
have been reported in virtually all spectroscopic surveys of distant clusters eg Couch  Sharples
1987 Fisher et al 1998 Postman et al 1998 2001
The increasing importance of the OII emission with redshift can also be assessed from cluster
composite spectra that are obtained summing up the light from all galaxies in a given cluster to
produce a sort of cluster integrated spectrum Fig 3 Dressler et al 2004 As expected the
strength of OII in these composite spectra displays a large clustertocluster variation at any
redshift but there is a tendency for the z
5 clusters to have on average a stronger composite
EWOII than the clusters at z
If numerous observations indicate that emissionline galaxies were more prominent in clusters
in the past than today and if these results are unsurprising given the evolution with z of the star
formation activity in the general eld quantifying this evolution in clusters has proved to be
very hard The fact that the emissionline incidence varies strongly from a cluster to another at all
redshifts and the relatively small samples of clusters studied in detail at different redshifts have
so far hindered our progress in measuring how the fraction of emissionline galaxies evolves with
redshift as a function of the cluster properties
Discriminating between cosmic evolution and clustertocluster variance is a problem also for

Ha clusterwide studies Using narrowband imaging or multiplex multislit capabilities a handful
of clusters have been studied to date at z
2 Couch et al 2001 Balogh et al 2002b Finn et al
2004 and submitted Kodama et al 2004 Umeda et al 2004 These studies have conrmed that
the fraction of emissionline Ha detected in this case galaxies is lower in clusters than in the
eld at similar redshifts and have shown that the bright end of the Ha
luminosity function does
not seem to depend strongly on environment As shown in Fig 4 the number of clusters studied is
still insufcient to pin down the star formation rate SFR per unit of cluster mass as a function of
redshift AND of global cluster properties such as the cluster velocity dispersion
A word of caution is compulsory when using emissionlines and assuming they provide an
unbiased view of the evolution of the star formation activity in cluster galaxies There are several
indications that dust extinction is in fact important and strongly distorts our view of the star form-
ation activity in at least some cluster galaxies Evidence for dust arises from optical spectroscopy
itself which nds many dusty starbursting or starforming galaxies with relatively weak emission
lines both in distant clusters and in the eld at similar redshifts Poggianti et al 1999 Shioya et
al 2000 Poggianti et al 2001a Bekki et al 2001 The radiocontinuum detection of galaxies
with no optical emission lines Smail et al 1999 Miller  Owen 2002 and mid-IR estimates of
the star formation rate Duc et al 2002 Biviano et al 2004 Coia et al 2005ab indicate that even
the majority or all of the star formation activity of some cluster galaxies can be obscured at optical
wavelengths Whether taking into account dust obscuration changes signicantly the evolutionary
picture inferred from emission lines is still a critical open question that Spitzer is likely to answer
Precious informations about the star formation histories of cluster galaxies can also be obtained
from absorptionline spectra In distant clusters the presence of galaxies with strong Balmer lines

in absorption in their spectra and no emission lines testies that these are post-starburstpost-
starforming galaxies observed soon after their star formation activity was interrupted and observed
within 1-15 Gyr from the halting Dressler  Gunn 1983 Couch  Sharples 1987 see Poggianti
2004 for a review These galaxies have been found to be proportionally more numerous in distant
clusters than in the eld at comparable redshifts Dressler et al 1999 Poggianti et al 1999 Tran
et al 2003 2004 Their spectral characteristics and their different frequency as a function of the
environment are a strong indication for a truncation of the star formation activity related to the
dense environment
Alltogether the ndings described in this section suggest that many galaxies have stopped
forming stars in clusters quite recently as a consequence of environmental conditions switching
off their star formation activity and that largely in parallel many galaxies have morphologically
evolved from late to early type galaxies
22 Dependence of the star formation history on galaxy mass - Mass assembly
How does the evolution depend on the galaxy mass Does the environmental dependence of
galaxy properties change with galaxy mass
It has always been known that fainter lower mass galaxies on average are bluer than higher
mass galaxies and on average have more active star formation The references to old and new
papers showing this could easily ll this review
Recently the interest in this well established observational result has grown and its implic-
ations have been more and more appreciated In all environments lower mass galaxies have on
average a more protracted star formation history This implies that on average going to lower
redshifts the maximum luminositymass of galaxies with signicant star formation activity pro-
gressively decreases This downsizing effect observed in and outside of clusters indicates an

Bianca Poggianti
anti-hierachical history for the star formation in galaxies which parallels a similar effect ob-
served for AGNs Cristiani et al 2004 Shankar et al 2004
In clusters innumerable results have shown the existence of a downsizing effect Smail et al
1998 Gavazzi et al 2002 De Propris et al 2003 Tran et al 2003 De Lucia et al 2004 Kodama
et al 2004 Poggianti et al 2004 to name a few A direct observation of this effect at high redshift
is shown in Fig 5 and illustrates the consequence of downsizing on the characteristics of the color-
magnitude red sequence in clusters A deciency of faint red galaxies is observed compared to
Coma in all four clusters studied despite of the variety of cluster properties The red luminous
galaxies are already in place on the red sequence at z
8 while a signicant fraction of the faint
galaxies must have stopped forming stars and consequently moved on to the red sequence at lower
redshifts A downsizing effect is also observed analyzing the post-starburst populations in clusters
the maximum mass of post-starburst galaxies evolves with z being higher in distant clusters Tran
et al 2003 Poggianti et al 2004 The fraction of S0 galaxies with recent star formation in the
Coma cluster is higher at fainter luminosities Poggianti et al 2001b which is consistent with
them being the descendants of typical star-forming spirals at intermediate redshift see Sec 21
These results and many others have shown that the star formation history of a galaxy in
clusters and in the eld depends on average strongly on the galaxy mass see also Kauffmann et
al 2003 2004 Balogh et al 2004b Another important aspect is whether the mass distribution of
galaxies varies with redshift The stellar mass function traced by the K-band luminosity function
has been shown to evolve very little at the bright end in clusters between z
0 Kodama
 Bower 2003 nd an evolution which is consistent with passive evolution and inconsistent with
semi-analytic models that predict instead an increase in the characteristic mass of a factor  3 over
found in a
the same redshift range Fig 6 This result is in agreement with the evolution of K
cluster at z
2 by Toft et al 2004 who also nd a strong evolution of the faint end of the
K-band luminosity function the fraction of low mass galaxies appears much lower in this cluster
2 than in clusters at z
1 and z
3 Local universe
In the previous sections we have dealt with the evolution of galaxy morphologies star form-
ation activity and masses In this section I want to mention a couple of results established obser-
vationally at low redshifts regarding galaxy properties and trends whose evolution with redshift is
still unknown the StarFormation-Density SFD relation and the gas and star formation distribu-
tions within galaxies
It has been known for a long time that in the nearby Universe also the average star formation
activity correlates with the local density in higher density regions the mean star formation rate per
galaxy is lower This is not surprising given the existence of the MD relation the highest density
regions have proportionally more early-type galaxies devoid of current star formation
Interestingly the correlation between mean SF and local density extends to very low local
densities comparable to those found at the virial radius of clusters and such a correlation exists
also outside of clusters Lewis et al 2002 Gomez et al 2003 see also Gray et al 2004 showing for
the rst time an interesting relation between the star formatin activity and the dark matter density
eld measured by weak gravitational lensing Again this seems to parallel the fact that an MD

of low-luminosity passive red galaxies compared to Coma and other nearby clusters
from the red sequence Right The magnitude distribution of red sequence galaxies at z
relation is probably existing in all environments  though it is not the same in all environments as
discussed in Sec 21
A variation in the mean SFgalaxy with density can be due either to a difference in the fraction
of star-forming galaxies or in the star formation rates of the star-forming galaxies or a combin-
ation of both In a recent paper Balogh et al 2004a have shown that the distribution of Ha
equivalent widths EW in star-forming galaxies does not depend strongly on the local density
while the fraction of star-forming galaxies is a steep function of the local density in all environ-
ments Again a dependence on the global environment is observed in the sense that at a given
local density the fraction of emission-line galaxies is slightly lower in environments with high

5 Mpc but see Kauffmann et al 2004 for an opposite result Based on
density on large scales 
this the authors conclude that if some physical mechanism switches off the star formation when
a galaxy enters a denser environment it must do so on a short timescale in order to preserve the
shape of the EWHa  distribution
The fact that a relation between star formation and density is observed also outside of clusters
has often been interpreted as a sign that the environment starts affecting the star formation activity
of galaxies provoking a decline in star formation in galaxies that if isolated would continue form-
ing stars at relatively low densities when a galaxy becomes part of a group and strangulation has
traditionally been invoked as the culprit On the other hand this appears in conict with the fast
timescale required for example by the Ha and color studies mentioned above Balogh et al 2004a
2004b
Personally I believe that the existence of such a correlation is more probably the result of
a correlation between initial conditions galaxy mass andor local environment very early on at
the time the rst stars formed in galaxies and type of galaxy formed The exact shape of the
correlation instead is probably inuenced by transformations happening in galaxies when they
enter a different environment
31 Gas content and gasSF distribution within galaxies
In order to understand what happens to galaxies in clusters two crucial pieces of information
are 1 the gas content of cluster galaxies and 2 the spatial distribution of the gas and of the star
formation activity within each galaxy
It has been several years since it became evident that many spirals in clusters are decient in
HI gas compared to similar galaxies in the eld Giovanelli  Haynes 1985 Cayatte et al 1990
see van Gorkom 2004 for a review Most but not all of the HI decient spirals are found at small
035  10
Evolution of galaxies in clusters

distances from the cluster centre In the central regions of clusters the sizes of the HI disks are
smaller than the optical disks and a spatial displacement between the HI and the optical occurs
in several cases Bravo-Alfaro et al 2000 The fraction of HIdecient spirals increases going
towards the cluster centre and a correlation is observed between deciency and orbital parameters
more decient galaxies tend to be on radial orbits Solanes et al 2001
All of these ndings strongly suggest that ram pressure stripping or at least gas stripping in
general plays an important role On the other hand the work from Solanes et al
2001 has
unexpectedly shown that the HI deciency is observed out to 2 Abell radii This result has raised
the question whether the origin of the HI deciency in the cluster outskirts can be consistent with
the ram pressure scenario and whether can be simply due to effects such as large distance errors
or rebounding at large clustercentric distances of galaxies that have gone through the cluster center

radial proles for galaxies grouped in different
classes according to their Ha distribution The rst two panels show proles that can be considered normal
reproduced also in other panels Truncated anemic enhanced classes are shown in all the other panels
Recent works have yielded a census of the spatial distribution of the star formation as ob-
served in Ha
emission within cluster galaxies These works have shown that the majority of the
cluster galaxies have peculiar Ha morphologies compared to eld galaxies Moss  Whittle 1993
2000 Koopmann  Kenney 2004 Vogt et al 2004 More than half of the spirals in the Virgo
cluster for example have Ha
radial proles truncated from a certain radius on while others have
suppressed throughout the disk and in some cases enhanced Fig 7 Koopmann  Kenney
2004 On a sample of 18 nearby clusters similar classes of objects are observed spirals with
truncated Ha emission and HI gas on the leading edge of the disk spirals stripped of their HI with
their star formation conned to the inner regions and quenched spirals in which the star formation

is suppressed throughout the disk Vogt et al 2004 From these works gas stripping appears a
very important factor in determining both the gas content and the star formation activity of cluster
spirals though tidal effects are also found to be signicant Moss  Whittle 2000 Koopmann 
Kenney 2004 Spirals in clusters thus appear to be heavily affected by the environment and to
be observed in different stages of their likely transformation from infalling star-forming spirals to
cluster S0s
It is apparently hard to reconcile the peculiar Ha morphologies of spirals in nearby clusters
with the fact that the distribution of Ha
equivalent widths EWs for blue galaxies in the 2dF and
Sloan does not seem to vary signicantly in clusters groups and eld Fig 9 in Balogh et al 2004
This apparent contradiction still awaits an explanation
4 Observations versus galaxy formation and evolution models
By now mostly thanks to the scientic debate of the latest years it is widespread wisdom that
we are investigating a three-dimensional space whose axis are redshift environment and galaxy
mass In fact the evolutionary histories and in particular the star formation activity of galaxies
have similar increasing trends as a function of higher redshift lower galaxy mass and lower
densitymass of the environment While observationally we are beginning to ll this 3-parameter
space the great theoretical challenge is to help comprehend from a physical point of view why this
is the history of our Universe
Given the topic of this School and meeting I think it is appropriate to summarize what are
the most important observational ndings for simulations and models to address Theory can be
fundamental to
1 explain the origin of the Morphology-Density relation explain the cause of its evolution with
redshift and the reason of its variation with environment
2 reproduce the star formation history of galaxies as a function of the environment in partic-
ular the SF increase with lookback time the existence of post-starburst galaxies in clusters
the origin and predict the evolution of the SF-Density relation
3 reproduce and explain the origin of the downsizing effect and the history of mass assembly
Hierarchical simulations show a correlation between colormorphology and density which is
in qualitative agreement with observations Kauffmann et al 1999 Benson et al 2001 and in
prep Diaferio et al 2001 Springel et al 2001 and with the Butcher-Oemler effect Bower 1991
Kauffmann et al 1995a 1995b
Lets take as example the morphology-density relation a morphological segregation is a pre-
diction of CDM simulations of large scale structure and semi-analytic models because the local
density of galaxies and DM is related to the epoch of initial collapse the most massive structures
at any epoch are the earliest that collapsed Even models that only include mergers and neglect
any other environmental process obtain a trend in qualitative agreement with the MD relation a
morphological segregation is built-in at a very fundamental level in hierarchical theories of galaxy
formation

However all models fail to reproduce the S0 population which it is worth reminding repres-
ents 40 of the galaxy populations of rich clusters at low z recognizing that additional processes
seem to be required Diaferio et al 2001 Springel et al 2001 Okamoto  Nagashima 2001 2003
Benson et al in prep
Another good example are the early-type galaxies Observations point to a very heterogeneous
evolution for those galaxies that today are passive red early-type galaxies in clusters but not in
the sense naively expected from models the massive ones for which mergers should be more
important according to models observationally appear truly old and homogeneous It is by now
established by an overwhelming number of observations that the more massive galaxies are the
older they are thus that the age of galaxies have an anti-hierarchical behaviour with mass At
this meeting we have heard several lectures and talks reminding us of this observational evidence
and of galaxy formation and evolution models reproducing this anti-hierarchical evolution with
opportune assumptions see eg Daneses and Cristianis contributions to these proceedings Chiosi
 Carraro 2002 As we have seen in Sec 22 the mass assembly of galaxies in clusters is another
eld where until now there is a mismatch between models and observations But the comparison
between galaxy models within a CDM scenario and observations of galaxies in clusters is still
largely unprobed territory and a fruitful interplay can be expected in the coming years as promised
by the progress shown at this meeting
