ABSTRACT
We investigate the evolution of the faint-end slope of the luminosity function  using semi-
analytical modeling of galaxy formation
In agreement with observations we nd that the slope
can be tted well by z  a  bz with a  113 and b  01 The main driver for the evolution
in  is the evolution in the underlying dark matter mass function Sub-L galaxies reside in dark
matter halos that occupy a dierent part of the mass function At high redshifts this part of the mass
function is steeper than at low redshifts and hence  is steeper Supernova feedback in general causes
the same relative attening with respect to the dark matter mass function The faint-end slope at
low redshifts is dominated by eld galaxies and at high redshifts by cluster galaxies The evolution of
z in each of these environments is dierent with eld galaxies having a slope b  014 and cluster
galaxies b  005 The transition from cluster-dominated to eld-dominated faint-end slope occurs
roughly at a redshift z  2 and suggests that a single linear t to the overall evolution of z might
not be appropriate Furthermore this result indicates that tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies in clus-
ters cannot play a signicant role in explaining the evolution of z at z  z In addition we nd
that dierent star-formation eciencies a in the Schmidt-Kennicutt-law and supernovae-feedback
eciencies  generally do not strongly inuence the evolution of z

1 INTRODUCTION
The galaxy luminosity function LF is one of the
cornerstones in our understanding of galaxy formation
and evolution Since the introduction of a tting func-
tion for its shape by Schechter 1976 the origin of the
form of the LF function has been a powerful constraint
on model building eg Benson et al 2003 Samui et al
2007 While recent work has focused somewhat on the
luminous end its evolution with redshift Brown et al
2007 and the role of dry mergers Khochfar  Burkert
2003 Naab et al 2006 the faint-end provides addi-
tional important clues on galaxy formation Systematic
studies of the faint-end slope in the local universe re-
veal dierences between high and low density environ-
ments Trentham 1998 as well as for galaxy samples
split by morphologies eg Marzke et al 1994 The
underlying physical processes that shape the faint-end
of the LF are generally associated with feedback from
supernovae that is eective in heating gas and driving
winds in shallow gravitational potentials Dekel  Silk
1986 Although the implementation of supernova feed-
back in galaxy formation models has been extensively in-
vestigated eg Benson et al 2003 for the local galaxy
LF its impact on the redshift evolution on the faint-
end has not been as well studied The recent wealth
of LF measured to very faint magnitudes in the rest-
frame B-band eg Blanton et al 2003 Wolf et al 2003
Marchesini et al 2007 Ryan et al 2007 and the rest-
frame FUV eg Yan  Windhorst 2004a Wyder et al
2005 Bouwens et al 2006 allows us to test models with
high accuracy
The purpose of this letter is to investigate the under-
lying driving mechanism for the redshift evolution of the
faint-end slope Furthermore we investigate the impact
of supernova feedback on the rate of star-formation by
varying the relevant eciency parameters
2 MODEL
In the following we briey outline our basic mod-
elling approach and refer the reader for more details to
Khochfar  Burkert 2005 Khochfar  Silk 2006 and
reference therein We generate merger trees for dark mat-
ter halos using a Monte-Carlo approach based on the ex-
tended Press-Schechter formalism Somerville  Kolatt
1999 As we aim to model the faint-end of the LF
to high redshifts we need to make sure that the mass
resolution in our simulations is sucient We generate
merger trees from dark matter mass functions between
z  0 and z  6 and nd that resolving each individual
merger tree down to a mass resolution of Mmin  5 109
M and Mmin  108 M at z  3 and z  4 re-
spectively gives robust results Once a tree reaches
Mmin we start moving the tree forward in time includ-
ing physical processes associated with the baryons within
each dark matter halo that include gas cooling star-
formation supernova feedback reionization and merg-
ing of galaxies on a dynamical friction time-scale As
the focus of this letter is on the faint-end of the lumi-
nosity function we will omit including prescriptions for
AGN-feedback eg Bower et al 2006 or environmental
eects Khochfar  Ostriker 2007 that mainly inuence
the bright-end of the luminosity function
The largest impact on the slope at the faint-end
comes from star-formation and associated supernova
feedback Dekel  Silk 1986 Faint galaxies generally
occupy small dark matter halos with shallow potential
wells that allow eective reheating of cold gas in the
ISM by feedback from supernovae We model star-
formation in galaxies using a parametrisation of the
global Schmidt-Kennicutt-law Kennicutt 1998 accord-
ing to which M  aMcoldtdyn where a is a free
parameter that is indicative of the eciency of star-
formation Mcold is the mass in cold gas in the galac-
tic disk and tdyn is the dynamical time-scale of the
galaxy Following the arguments by Dekel  Silk 1986
we model the amount of cold gas reheated by feedback
from supernovae with MSN  4 MSN ESN 3V 2
with  as a free parameter that controls the feedback
eciency SN the number of supernovae per solar mass
of stars formed ESN  1051 erg is the energy released
by each supernova and Vmax is the maximum circular
velocity of the dark matter halo in which the galaxy re-
For each individual galaxy in our simulation we store
the star-formation history and generate its Bband and
FUV rest-frame luminosity function at various redshifts
using the stellar population models of Bruzual  Charlot
2003 The faint-end of the luminosity function is then
tted by a simple power law with slope  as dened in
Schechter 1976 We t the faint-end LF at each redshift
with a power law spanning a range of four magnitudes
at z  3 and at least two magnitudes at z  3 start-
ing at the lowest magnitude Lmin that is unaected by
the mass resolution of the simulation We choose this
approach over tting the whole LF with a Schechter-t
because we are missing physical eects see below in
our model that are responsible for shaping the bright-
end and the knee of the LF In addition we increase
the number of magnitude bins and make sure that the
tted values for  are unaected by the bin-size Fig1
shows the luminosity function at magnitudes larger than
the corresponding minimum magnitude for Lmin In this
study we simulate a volume of 106 Mpc3 which allows
us to calculate  robustly up to a redshift z  6
Throughout this paper we use the following set of cos-
mological parameters based on the three year Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe data Spergel et al 2007

3 RESULTS
There is signicant evidence that the faint-end slope of
the galaxy luminosity function shows a measurable de-
pendence on redshift which can be tted by a linear law
of the form z  a  bz with a between 112 and
117 and b between 012 and 011 for recent obser-
vations see Sawicki  Thompson 2006 Marchesini et al
2007 Ryan et al 2007 Within the hierarchical struc-
ture formation paradigm one naturally expects such be-
haviour considering that the slope of the dark matter
mass function below MDM is DM  2 and that the
objects that form in these halos continue to grow by
continued star-formation and mergers with each other
Khochfar  Burkert 2001 hence attening the slope
Fig 1 shows the predicted model luminosity function
at various redshifts in the rest-frame B and U V  The
simulated and observed luminosity functions are in fair
agreement at the faint-end The luminous end however
shows deviations at low redshift which are due to missing
feedback sources in massive galaxies such as AGN or to
environmental eects In Fig 2 we show the predicted
evolution of z for our best-t local model The free
parameters a and  in this model are chosen to give the

2006 For consistency with the majority of observations
we calculate the faint-end slope for the rest-frame FUV
at z  4 and at lower redshifts for the rest-frame B-band
We indeed nd an evolution in  with redshift that is in
fair agreement with the observed evolution
The immediate question that arises is what inuences
and is the main driver for the evolution in  Generally
supernova feedback is considered the dominant mecha-
nism in shaping the faint-end of the luminosity function
Dekel  Silk 1986 Benson et al 2003 The shaded re-
gion in Fig 2 shows the range of linear ts to z that
we nd by varying the star-formation eciency between
a  00201 and the supernovae feedback eciency be-
tween   02  06 We infer only a very modest change
in z for reasonable choices of feedback eciencies and
therefore conclude that another process must be respon-
sible for the observed evolution in z
evolution with redshift
The mass function of dark matter halos is known
Press  Schechter 1974 The galaxies contributing to
the luminosity function around L are mostly central
galaxies in their dark matter halos ie the most lumi-
nous galaxy within the halo eg Khochfar  Ostriker
2007 It is therefore not unreasonable to assume a con-
nection between the evolution of z and that of the
dark matter mass function When considering the lumi-
nosity of central galaxies residing in dark matter halos
of the same mass at dierent redshifts we nd that at
early times central galaxies are up to three magnitudes
brighter than their counterparts in low redshift halos
This is even the case for halos hosting sub-L galaxies
Similar results have been reported by Kobayashi et al
2007 who showed that dwarf galaxies at early times
are not aected by supernova feedback in their simula-

results from the simulation and the solid line is the best t to the
simulation data Errorbars indicate 1- errors The dashed lines
show the t to the compiled data in Ryan et al 2007 The shaded

discussed in the text Stars are the compilation from Ryan et al

tions because cooling times are very short in these halos
and the energy injected by the supernovae is rapidly dis-
sipated away The slope in the region of dark matter ha-
los that host sub-L galaxies is steeper at high redshift
and consequently so is  The same is true for other
choices of a and  thereby explaining why we do not
nd any strong dependence of z on these parameters
It should be noted however that modelling these param-
eters with a strong redshift dependency will be able to
enhance or weaken the evolution of 
We continue analyzing the evolution in z by dis-
tinguishing between cluster and eld galaxies and their
relaxation to the overall luminosity function at the faint-
end In Fig 3 we present z for progenitor galaxies
of present-day cluster and eld galaxies from our simu-
lations Here we dene cluster environments by present-
day dark matter halos above 1014 M and eld envi-
ronments by halos with masses below 1012 M In eld
environments  is steeper and evolves more strongly than
in cluster environments At early times the rst galaxies
to appear are most likely in high uctuations which
will result in present-day galaxy clusters Consequently
the faint-end luminosity function at high redshifts will
be dominated by present-day cluster members and the
faint-end-slope of the overall galaxy population at high
redshifts is atter than that for the eld luminosity func-
tion alone at the same redshift When considering the
relative weight of eld galaxies to the overall galaxy
population at the faint-end one can estimate the red-
shift at which the transition from cluster-driven to eld-
driven evolution in  occurs We nd that this transition
roughly occurs at z  2 with a slight dependency on the
denition of environment
4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Fig 3 The slope  at dierent redshifts as predicted by the
best t local model Filled circles show results for typcal eld
environments and lled stars show the results for cluster environ-
ments as dened by their present day dark halo mass The solid
and dashed line are the ts to the modeled evolution in the eld
and cluster respectively Here we dene cluster environments by
present-day dark matter halos above 1014 M and eld environ-
ments by halos with masses below 1012 M
In this Letter we presented predictions for the redshift
evolution of the faint-end slope of the luminosity func-
tion within the CDM-scenario In general we nd the
same trend as in the recent observations ie a steepening
faint-end slope  with redshift which can be well-tted
by a simple linear t z  a  bz where the observa-
tions nd a  117 and b  011 Ryan et al 2007
Our simulations predict a  113 and b  01 in good
agreement with the observations considering the large
uncertainties especially at high redshifts
Our simulations conrm previous results that the at-
tening of the faint-end slope  with respect to the slope
in the dark matter mass function can be well explained
by supernova feedback However we additionally show
that  is steeper at higher redshifts mainly due to the
dark matter mass function being steeper for the range of
halo masses that host sub-L galaxies suggesting that
the evolution of  traces closely that of the underlying
dark matter mass function
The contribution of the progenitor population of
present-day eld and cluster galaxies plays a signicant
role in shaping the evolution of   For eld galaxies
the evolution of z is stronger with b  014 and
a  116 than for cluster galaxies In our simulations
we nd that at redshifts z  2 the faint-end is domi-
nated by galaxies ending up in present-day clusters This
transition redshift is dependent on the value of 8 which
normalizes the power spectrum and regulates the redshift
at which structures of a given mass typically form Ad-
ditionally the slope of the uctuation spectrum at small
scales will inuence z Precise high redshift measure-
ments of the contributions of these two populations to
the faint-end of the luminosity function in future surveys
with eg the HST WFC3 will help to pin down z One
potential problem for future surveys will be a possible
bias towards cluster galaxies as they might experience
induced star-formation Marcillac et al 2007 increas-
ing their surface brightness and making them more eas-
ily detectable This eect will shift z to higher redshifts
and needs to be taken into account carefully Obser-
vational selection eects will aect the observed faint-
end LF-slope in Fig 2 Some observational selection
eects ie catalogue incompleteness and natural confu-
sion Windhorst et al 2007 can make the observed faint-
end slope atter than the true one while others eg
SB-dimming could make the observed slope somewhat
steeper than the true one depending on the exact in-
trinsic object size distribution A number of groups cor-
rect for incompleteness either through MC-simulations
eg Yan  Windhorst 2004b or through cloning tech-
niques eg Bouwens et al 2006 and nd similar faint-
end slopes when following dierent procedures When
judging the data however one must keep these observa-
tional biases in mind Ultimately these issues can only
be resolved with deeper JWST data to AB31-32 mag
Tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies in clusters as seen in
high resolution simulations Tormen et al 1998 can in
principle change the slope  Our results however sug-
gest that at a transition redshift of z  2 the evolution
of  changes from being dominated by cluster galaxies
to being dominated by eld galaxies It is therefore not
likely that a large amount of the evolution in  at z  z
is driven by tidal disruption of faint galaxies An addi-
tional implication from the transition at z is that the
evolution of z is better t by a linear function with a
break at z
The attening of the slope  with respect to the un-
derlying dark matter slope suggests the interesting pos-
sibility of estimating the time-scale over which super-
novae operate Assuming that the rst Pop II stars were
formed sometime before reionization Yan  Windhorst
2004b and that supernovae type Ia originate roughly
 1  2 Gyr after the bulk of the rst Pop II star-
formation one would expect an increase in energy in-
jection into the interstellar medium at a redshift corre-
sponding to this time lag This additional energy input
will hinder star-formation and contribute to a further in-
crease in the mass-to-light ratio of galaxies and hence
to an even stronger attening of the slope  It will be
crucial to have robust measurements of  over a wide
range of redshifts to probe the onset of the rst signi-
cant feedback contribution from type Ia supernovae Fur-
thermore probing the faint-end slope at redshifts z  6
before the signicant onset of type II supernovae will al-
low us to measure the underlying dark matter slope very
accurately
Our approach has certain shortcomings The model
presented here did not include any time delay prescrip-
tions for the various SN types but instead assumed
instantaneous feedback More detailed modeling of the
time delays and its inuence on the faint-end slope
will be presented elsewhere in preparation Our
treatment of supernovae feedback is very simplistic and
more detailed hydrodynamical simulations including
a multi-phase medium will show if this general trend
which we report can be recovered First generations
of such simulations indeed show that SN type II
that are generated in dense star clusters explode into
bubbles of hot gas and are therefore less ecient at
feedback into the
ISM Mac Low  Ferrara 1999
compared to SN type Ia which go o at random places
in the galaxy and can have more eect on the early ISM
