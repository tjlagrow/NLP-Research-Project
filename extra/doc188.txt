ABSTRACT
Does galaxy evolution proceed through the green valley via multiple pathways or as
a single population Motivated by recent results highlighting radically dierent evo-
lutionary pathways between early- and late-type galaxies we present results from a
simple Bayesian approach to this problem wherein we model the star formation history
SFH of a galaxy with two parameters t   and compare the predicted and observed
optical and near-ultraviolet colours We use a novel method to investigate the morpho-
logical dierences between the most probable SFHs for both disc-like and smooth-like
populations of galaxies by using a sample of 126 316 galaxies 001  z  025 with
probabilistic estimates of morphology from Galaxy Zoo We nd a clear dierence be-
tween the quenching timescales preferred by smooth- and disc-like galaxies with three
possible routes through the green valley dominated by smooth- rapid timescales
attributed to major mergers intermediate- intermediate timescales attributed to
minor mergers and galaxy interactions and disc-like slow timescales attributed to
secular evolution galaxies We hypothesise that morphological changes occur in sys-
tems which have undergone quenching with an exponential timescale   15 Gyr in
order for the evolution of galaxies in the green valley to match the ratio of smooth
to disc galaxies observed in the red sequence These rapid timescales are instrumental
in the formation of the red sequence at earlier times however we nd that galaxies
currently passing through the green valley typically do so at intermediate timescalescid63
1 INTRODUCTION
Previous large scale surveys of galaxies have revealed a bi-
modality in the colour-magnitude diagram CMD with two
distinct populations one at relatively low mass with blue
optical colours and another at relatively high mass with red
optical colours Baldry et al 2004 2006 Willmer et al 2006
Ball Loveday  Brunner 2008 Brammer et al 2009 These
populations were dubbed the blue cloud and red sequence

tion of more than 250000 users in the Galaxy Zoo project Their

ously been detected
The sparsely populated colour space between these two
populations the so-called green valley provides clues to
the nature and duration of galaxies transitions from blue

to red This transition must occur on rapid timescales oth-
erwise there would be an accumulation of galaxies resid-
ing in the green valley rather than an accumulation in the
red sequence as is observed Arnouts et al 2007 Martin
et al 2007 Green valley galaxies have therefore long been
thought of as the crossroads of galaxy evolution a transi-
tion population between the two main galactic stages of the
star forming blue cloud and the dead red sequence Bell et
al 2004 Wyder et al 2007 Schiminovich et al 2007 Martin
et al 2007 Faber et al 2007 Mendez et al 2011 Goncalves
et al 2012 Schawinski et al 2014 Pan et al 2014
The intermediate colours of these green valley galaxies
have been interpreted as evidence for recent quenching sup-
pression of star formation Salim et al 2007 Star forming
galaxies are observed to lie on a well dened mass-SFR re-
lation however quenching a galaxy causes it to depart from
this relation Noeske et al 2007 Peng et al 2010 see Fig-
By studying the galaxies which have just left this mass-
SFR relation we can probe the quenching mechanisms by
which this occurs There have been many previous theories
for the initial triggers of these quenching mechanisms in-
cluding negative feedback from AGN Di Matteo Springel

lution Masters et al 2010 2011 Mendez et al 2011 By
investigating the amount of quenching that has occurred in
the blue cloud green valley and red sequence and by com-
paring the amount across these three populations we can
apply some constraints to these theories
We have been motivated by a recent result suggesting
two contrasting evolutionary pathways through the green
valley by dierent morphological types Schawinski et al
2014 hereafter S14 specically that late-type galaxies
quench very slowly and form a nearly static disc popula-
tion in the green valley whereas early-type galaxies quench
very rapidly transitioning through the green valley and onto
the red sequence in  1 Gyr Wong et al 2012 That study
used a toy model to examine quenching across the green val-
ley Here we implement a novel method utilising Bayesian
statistics for a comprehensive overview of Bayesian statis-
tics see either MacKay 2003 or Sivia 1996 in order to nd
the most likely model description of the star formation his-
tories of galaxies in the three populations This method also
enables a direct comparison with our current understanding
of galaxy evolution from stellar population synthesis SPS
see section 3 models
Through this approach we aim to determine the follow-
i What previous star formation history SFH causes a
galaxy to reside in the green valley at the current epoch
ii Is the green valley a transitional or static population
iii If the green valley is a transitional population how
many routes through it are there
iv Are there morphology-dependent dierences between
these routes through the green valley
This paper proceeds as follows Section 2 contains a de-
scription of the sample data which is used in the Bayesian
analysis of an exponentially declining star formation his-
tory model all described in Section 3 Section 4 contains
the results produced by this analysis with Section 5 pro-
viding a detailed discussion of the results obtained We also
summarise our ndings in Section 6 The zero points of all
ugriz magnitudes are in the AB system and where necessary
we adopt the WMAP Seven-Year Cosmological parameters

21 Multi-wavelength data
The galaxy sample is compiled from publicly available
optical data from the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey SDSS
York et al 2000 Data Release 8 Aihara et al 2011
Near-ultraviolet NUV photometry was obtained from the
Galaxy Evolution Explorer GALEX Martin et al 2005
and was matched with a search radius of 1cid48cid48 in right ascen-
sion and declination
Observed optical and ultraviolet uxes are corrected for
galactic extinction Oh et al 2011 by applying the Cardelli
et al 1989 law giving an typical correction of u  r 
005 We also adopt k-corrections to z  00 and obtain
absolute magnitudes from the NYU-VAGC Blanton et al
2005 Padmanabhan et al 2008 Blanton  Roweis 2007
giving a typical u  r correction of  015 mag The change
in the u  r colour due to both corrections therefore ranges
from u r  02 at low redshift increasing up to u r 
10 at z  025 which is consistent with the expected k-
corrections shown in Figure 15 of Blanton  Roweis 2007
These corrections were calculated by Bamford et al 2009
for the entire Galaxy Zoo sample These corrections are a
crucial aspect of this work since a u  r  10 can cause
a galaxy to cross the denition between blue cloud green
valley and red sequence
We obtained star formation rates and stellar masses
from the MPA-JHU catalog Kaumann et al 2003 Brinch-
mann et al 2004 average values AVG corrected for aper-
ture and extinction which are in turn calculated from the
SDSS spectra and photometry
We further select a sub-sample with detailed morpho-
logical classications as described below to give a volume
limited sample in the redshift range 001  z  025
22 Galaxy Zoo 2 Morphological classications
In this investigation we use visual classications of galaxy
morphologies from the Galaxy Zoo 21 citizen science project
Willett et al 2013 which obtains multiple independent
classications for each galaxy image the full question tree
for each image is shown in Figure 1 of Willett et al 2013
The Galaxy Zoo 2 GZ2 project consists of 304 022
images from the SDSS DR8 a subset of those classied in
Galaxy Zoo 1 GZ1 all classied by at least 17 independent

Mu  205 are still included in the GZ2 subsample out to the
highest redshift of z  025
users with the mean number of classications standing at
 42 The GZ2 sample is more robust than the GZ1 sample
and provides more detailed morphological classications in-
cluding features such as bars the number of spiral arms and
the ellipticity of smooth galaxies It is for these reasons we
use the GZ2 sample as opposed to the GZ1 allowing for fur-
ther investigation of specic galaxy classes in the future see
Section 54 The only selection that was made on the sam-
ple was to remove objects considered to be stars artefacts or
merging pairs by the users ie with pstarartef act cid62 08 or
pmerger cid62 0420 see Willett et al 2013 Table 3 and discus-
sion for details of this fractional limit Further to this we
required NUV photometry from the GALEX survey within
which  42 of the GZ2 sample were observed giving a
total sample size of 126 316 galaxies The completeness of
this subsample of GZ2 matched to GALEX is shown in Fig-
ure 2 with the u-band absolute magnitude against redshift
for this sample compared with the SDSS data set Typical
Milky Way L galaxies with Mu  205 are still included
in the GZ2 subsample out to the highest redshift of z  025
however dwarf and lower mass galaxies are only detected at
the lowest redshifts
The rst task of GZ2 asks users to choose whether a
galaxy is mostly smooth is featured andor has a disc or

sample left and the SDSS sample from Baldry et al 2004 with
the denition between the blue cloud and the red sequence from
Baldry et al 2004 with the dashed line as dened in Equation 1
The solid lines show 1 either side of this denition any galaxy
within the boundary of these two solid lines is considered a green
valley galaxy The lack of red sequence galaxies due to the neces-
sity for NUV GALEX colours skews the apparent location of the
green valley therefore a literature denition of the green valley is
used to ensure comparisons can be made with other works
is a starartefact Unlike other tasks further down in the
decision tree every user who classies a galaxy image will
complete this task others such as whether the galaxy has
a bar is dependent on a user having rst classied it as a
featured galaxy Therefore we have the most statistically
robust classications at this level
The classications from users produces a vote fraction
for each galaxy the debiased fractions calculated by Willett
et al 2013 were used in this investigation for example if
80 of 100 people thought a galaxy was disc shaped whereas
20 out of 100 people thought the same galaxy was smooth
in shape ie elliptical that galaxy would have vote frac-
tions ps  02 and pd  08 In this example this galaxy
would be included in the clean disc sample pd cid62 08 ac-
cording to Willett et al 2013 and would be considered
a late-type galaxy All previous Galaxy Zoo projects have
incorporated extensive analysis of volunteer classications
to measure classication accuracy and bias and compute
user weightings for a detailed description of debiasing and
consistency-based user weightings see either Section 3 of
Lintott et al 2008 or Section 3 of Willett et al 2013
The classications are highly accurate and provide a
continuous scale of morphological features as shown in Fig-
ure 1 rather than a simple binary classication separating
elliptical and disc galaxies These classications allow each
galaxy to be considered as a probabilistic object with both
bulge and disc components For the rst time we incorpo-
rate this advantage of the GZ classications into a large
statistical analysis of how elliptical and disc galaxies dier
in their SFHs
23 Dening the Green Valley
To dene which of the sample of 126 316 galaxies were in
the green valley we looked to previous denitions in the
literature dening the separation between the red sequence
and blue cloud to ensure comparisons can be made with
other works Baldry et al 2004 used a large sample of
local galaxies from the SDSS to trace this bimodality by
tting double Gaussians to the colour magnitude diagram
without cuts in morphology Their relation is dened in their
Equation 11 as
cid18 Mr  2007

urMr  206  0244 tanh
cid48
and is shown in Figure 3 by the dashed line in comparison
to both the GZ2 subsample left and the SDSS data from
Baldry et al 2004 This ensures that the denition of the
green valley used is derived from a complete sample rather
than from our sample that is dominated by blue galaxies due
to the necessity for NUV photometry Any galaxy within
1 of this relationship shown by the solid lines in Fig-
ure 3 is therefore considered a green valley galaxy The
decomposition of the sample into red sequence green val-
ley and blue cloud galaxies is shown in Table 1 along with
further subsections by galaxy type This table also lists the
denitions we adopt henceforth for early-type ps cid62 08
late-type pd cid62 08 smooth-like ps  05 and disc-like
pd  05 galaxies
3 MODELS
In the following section the quenched SFH models are de-
scribed in Section 31 and the probabilistic tting method
to the data is described in Section 32
31 Quenching Models

be simply modelled as an exponentially declining star for-
mation rate SFR across cosmic time 0 cid54 t Gyr cid54 138

where tq is the onset time of quenching  is the timescale
over which the quenching occurs and isf r is an initial con-
stant star formation rate dependent on tq A smaller  value
corresponds to a rapid quench whereas a larger  value cor-
responds to a slower quench
We assume that all galaxies formed at a time t  0 Gyr
with an initial burst of star formation The mass of this ini-
tial burst is controlled by the value of the isf r which is set
as the average specic SFR sSFR at the time of quenching
tq Peng et al 2010 dened a relation their equation 1
between the average sSFR and redshift cosmic time t by
tting to measurements of the mean sSFR of blue star form-
ing galaxies from SDSS zCOSMOS and literature values at
increasing redshifts Elbaz et al 2007 Daddi et al 2007

Beyond z  2 the characteristic SFR attens and is roughly
constant back to z  6 The cause for this change is not
well understood but can be seen across similar observational
data Peng et al 2010 Gonzalez et al 2010 Bethermin et
al 2012 Motivated by these observations the relation de-
ned in Peng et al 2010 is taken up to a cosmic time of
t  3 Gyr z  23 and prior to this a constant average SFR
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
The Star Formation History of the Green Valley
will result in a lower value than the relation dened in Peng
et al 2010 at all cosmic times each galaxy only resides
on the main sequence at the point of quenching However
galaxies cannot remain on the main sequence from early
to late times throughout their entire lifetimes given the un-
physical stellar masses and SFRs this would result in at the
current epoch in the local Universe Bethermin et al 2012
Heinis et al 2014 If we were to include prescriptions for no
quenching starbursts mergers AGN etc into our models
we would improve on our reproduction of the average SFR
across cosmic time however we chose to initially focus on
the simplest model possible
Once this evolutionary SFR is obtained it is convolved
with the Bruzual  Charlot 2003 population synthesis
models to generate a model SED at each time step The
observed features of galaxy spectra can be modelled using
simple stellar population techniques which sum the contribu-
tions of individual coeval equal-metallicity stars The accu-
racy of these predictions depends on the completeness of the
input stellar physics Comprehensive knowledge is therefore
required of i stellar evolutionary tracks and ii the ini-
tial mass function IMF to synthesise a stellar population
accurately
These stellar population synthesis SPS models are an
extremely well explored and often debated area of astro-
physics Maraston 2005 Eminian et al 2008 Conroy Gunn
 White 2009 Falkenberg et al 2009 Chen et al 2010
Kriek et al 2010 Miller Rose  Cecil 2011 Melbourne
et al 2012 In this investigation we chose to utilise the
Bruzual  Charlot 2003 GALEXEV SPS models to al-
low a direct comparison with S14 along with a Chabrier
Chabrier et al 2003 IMF across a large wavelength range
00091   m  160 with solar metallically m62 in
the Bruzual  Charlot 2003 models hereafter BC03
Fluxes from stars younger than 3 Myr in the SPS model
are suppressed to mimic the large optical depth of protostars
embedded in dusty formation cloud as in S14 then lter
transmission curves are applied to the uxes to obtain AB
magnitudes and therefore colours For a particular galaxy
at an observed redshift z we dene the observed time tobs
for that galaxy using the standard cosmological conversion
between redshift and time We utilise the SFH models at
this observed time for each individual galaxy to compare
the predicted model and observed colours directly
Figure 4 shows these predicted optical and NUV colours
at a time of tobs  128 Gyr the average observed time of the
Galaxy Zoo 2 sample z  0076 provided by the exponen-
tial SFH model These predicted colours will be referred to
as dcptq  tobs where coptNUV and p  predicted
The SFR at a time of tobs  128 Gyr is also shown in
Figure 4 to compare how this correlates with the predicted
colours The u r predicted colour shows an immediate cor-
relation with the SFR however the N U V  u colour is more
sensitive to the value of  and so is ideal for tracing any
recent star formation in a population  At small  rapid
quenching timescales the N U V  u colour is insensitive to
tq whereas at large  slow quenching timescales the colour
is very sensitive to tq Together the two colours are ideal for
tracing the eects of tq and  in a population
We stress here that this model is not a fully hydro-
dynamical simulation it is a simple model built in order
to test the understanding of the evolution of galaxy popula-

tions These models are therefore not expected to accurately
determine the SFH of every galaxy in the GZ2 sample in
particular galaxies which have not undergone any quench-
ing In this case the models described above can only at-
tribute a constant star formation rate to these unquenched
galaxies In reality there are many possible forms of SFH

gated in previous literature starbursts Canalizo  Stockton

32 Probabilistic Fitting
In order to achieve robust conclusions we conduct a Bayesian
analysis Sivia 1996 MacKay 2003 of our SFH models
in comparison to the observed GZ2 sample data This ap-
proach requires consideration of all possible combinations of
  tq   Assuming that all galaxies formed at t  0 Gyr
with an initial burst of star formation we can assume that
the age of each galaxy in the GZ2 sample is equivalent to
an observed time tobs
see Section 22 We then use this
age to calculate the predicted model colours at this cos-
mic time for a given combination of  dcpk tobs
k  for both
optical and NUV c  opt N U V  colours We can now di-
rectly compare our model colours with the observed GZ2

2003 Foreman-Mackey et al 2013 Goodman  Weare 2010
provides a robust comparison of the likelihoods between 
values here we choose emcee2 a Python implementation of
an ane invariant ensemble sampler by Foreman-Mackey et
al 2013
This method allows for a more ecient exploration of
the parameter space by avoiding those areas with low like-
lihood A large number of walkers are started at an initial
position where the likelihood is calculated from there they
individually jump to a new area of parameter space If the
likelihood in this new area is greater less than the origi-
nal position then the walkers accept reject this change in
position Any new position then inuences the direction of
the jumps of other walkers This is repeated for the dened
number of steps after an initial burn-in phase emcee re-
turns the positions of these walkers which are analogous to
the regions of high probability in the model parameter space
The model outlined above has been coded using the Python
programming language into a package named starpy which

has been made freely available to download3 An example
output from this Python package for a single galaxy from the
GZ2 sample in the red sequence is shown in Figure 5 The
contours show the positions of the walkers in the Markov
Chain which are analogous to the areas of high probability
We wish to consider the model parameters for the pop-
ulations of galaxies across the colour magnitude diagram
for both smooth and disc galaxies therefore we run the
starpy package on each galaxy in the GZ2 sample This was
extremely time consuming for each combination of  values
which emcee proposes a new SFH must be built prior to
convolving it with the BC03 SPS models at the observed
age and then predicted colours calculated from the resul-
tant SED For a single galaxy this takes up to 2 hours on
a typical desktop machine for long Markov Chains A look-
up table was therefore generated at 50 tobs for 100 tquench
and 100  values this was then interpolated over for a given
observed galaxys age and proposed  values at each step in
the Markov Chain This ensures that a single galaxy takes
approximately 2 minutes to run on a typical desktop ma-
chine This interpolation was found to incorporate an error
of 004 into the median  values found the 50th percentile
position of the walkers see Appendix section B for further
information
Using this lookup table each of the 126 316 total galax-
ies in the GZ2 sample was run through starpy on multiple
cores of a computer cluster to obtain the Markov Chain
positions analogous to P kdk for each galaxy k see
Figure 5 In each case the Markov Chain consisted of 100
walkers which took 400 steps in the burn-in phase and 400
steps thereafter at which point the MCMC acceptance frac-
tion was checked to be within the range 025  facc  05
which was true in all cases Due to the Bayesian nature of
this method a statistical test on the results is not possible
the output is probabilistic in nature across the entirety of
the parameter space
These individual galaxy positions are then combined
to visualise the areas of high probability in the model pa-
rameter space across a given population eg the green val-
ley We do this by rst discarding positions with a cor-
responding probability of P kdk  02 in order to ex-
clude galaxies which are not well t by the quenching model
for example blue cloud galaxies which are still star forming
will be poorly t by a quenching model see Section 31

and blue galaxies respectively had all of their walker posi-
tions discarded These are not signicant enough fractions
to aect the results see Appendix section C for more in-
formation The Markov Chain positions are then binned
and weighted by their corresponding logarithmic posterior
probability logP kdk provided by the emcee package
to further emphasise the features and dierences between
each population in the visualisation The GZ2 data also
provides uniquely powerful continuous measurements of a
galaxys morphology therefore we utilise the user vote frac-
tions to obtain separate model parameter distributions for
both smooth and disc galaxies This is obtained by also
weighting by the morphology vote fraction when the binned
positions are summed We stress that this portion of the

methodology is a non-Bayesian visualisation of the combined
individual galaxy results for each population
For example the galaxy shown in Figure 5 would con-
tribute almost evenly to both the smooth and disc parame-
ters due to the GZ2 vote fractions Since galaxies with simi-
lar vote fractions contain both a bulge and disc component
this method is eective in incorporating intermediate galax-
ies which are thought to be crucial to the morphological
changes between early- and late-type galaxies It was the
consideration of these intermediate galaxies which was ex-
cluded from the investigation by S14
4 RESULTS
41 Initial Results
Figure 6 shows the SFR versus the stellar mass for the ob-
served GZ2 sample which has been split into blue cloud
green valley and red sequence populations as well as into
the clean disc and smooth galaxy samples with GZ2 vote
fractions of pd cid62 08 and ps cid62 08 respectively The green
valley galaxies are indeed a population which have either
left or begun to leave the star forming sequence or have
some residual star formation still occurring
The left panel in Figure 7 shows a handful of quenching
models and how they reproduce the observed relationship
between the SFR and the mass of a galaxy including how
at the time of quenching they reside on the star forming se-
quence shown by the solid black line for a galaxy of mass
M  101027Mcid12 The right panel shows how these SFRs
translate into the optical-NUV colour-colour plane to re-
produce observed colours of green valley and red sequence
galaxies Some of the SFHs produce colours redder than the
apparent peak of the red sequence in the GZ2 subsample
however this is not the true peak of the red sequence due
to the necessity for NUV colours from GALEX see Section
The majority of the red galaxies in the sample there-
fore lie towards the blue end of the red sequence and have
a small amount of residual star formation in order to be de-
tected in the NUV resulting in a specic subset of the red
sequence studied in this investigation Only 47 of the red
sequence galaxies present in the entire Galaxy Zoo 2 sam-
ple are matched with GALEX to produce our nal sample
of 126 316 galaxies as opposed to 72 of the blue cloud
and 53 of the green valley galaxies This limitation should
be taken into account when considering the results in the
following sections
The SFH models were
implemented with the
starpy package to produce Figures 8 9  10 for the
red sequence green valley and blue cloud populations of
smooth and disc galaxies respectively The percentages
shown in Figures 8 9  10 are calculated as the fractions
of the combined posterior probability distribution located
in each region of parameter space for a given population
Since the sample contains such a large number of galax-
ies we interpret these fractions as broadly equivalent to
the percentage of galaxies in a given population undergo-
ing quenching within the stated timescale range Although
this is not quantitatively exact it is nevertheless a useful
framework for interpreting the results of combining the in-
dividual posterior probability distributions of each galaxy

Based on positions in these diagrams the green valley does appear to be a transitional population between the blue cloud and the red
sequence Detailed analysis of star formation histories can elucidate the nature of the dierent populations pathways through the green
valley The clean smooth and disc samples are described in Section 22

The Star Formation History of the Green Valley
Figure 8 Contour plots showing the combined positions in the Markov Chain for all red galaxies in this study weighted by the
logarithmic probability of each position see Section 32 and also by the morphological vote fractions from GZ2 to give the areas
of high probability in the model parameter space for both bulge left and disc right dominated systems The histograms show the
projection into one dimension for each parameter The dashed lines show the separation between rapid  Gyr  10 intermediate
10   Gyr  20 and slow  Gyr  20 quenching timescales with the fraction of the combined posterior probability distribution
in each region shown see Section 32
Also shown in Figure 11 are the median walker posi-
tions the 50th percentile of the Bayesian probability distri-
bution of each individual galaxy split into red green and
blue populations also with a hard cut in the vote fraction of
pd  05 and ps  05 to show the disc and smooth popula-
tions respectively These positions were calculated without
discarding any walker positions due to low probability and
without weighting by vote fractions therefore this may be
more intuitive to understand than Figures 8 9  10
Although the quenching timescales are continuous in
nature in this Section we refer to rapid intermediate and
slow quenching timescales which correspond to ranges of
 Gyr  10 10   Gyr  20 and  Gyr  20
respectively for ease of discussion
42 The Red Sample
The left panel of Figure 8 reveals that smooth galaxies with
red optical colours show a preference 495 see Figure 8
for rapid quenching timescales across all cosmic time re-
sulting in a very low current SFR For these smooth red
galaxies we see at early times only a preference for slow
and intermediate timescales in the left panel of Figure 8
Perhaps this is the inuence of intermediate galaxies with
ps  pd  05 hence why similar high probability areas
exist for both the smooth-like and disc-like galaxies in the
left and right panels of Figure 8 This is especially apparent
considering there are far more of these intermediate galaxies
than those that are denitively early- or late-types see Ta-
ble 1 These galaxies are those whose morphology cannot
be easily distinguished either because they are at a large
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
distance or because they are an S0 galaxy whose morphol-
ogy can be interpreted by dierent users in dierent ways
Willett et al 2013 nd that S0 galaxies expertly classied
by Nair  Abraham 2010 are more commonly classied as
ellipticals by GZ2 users but have a signicant tail to high
disc vote fractions giving a possible explanation as to the
origin of this area of probability
The right panel of Figure 8 reveals that red disc galaxies
show similar preferences for rapid 313 and slow 441
quenching timescales The preference for very slow  
30 Gyr quenching timescales which are not seen in either
the green valley or blue cloud see Figures 9 and 10 suggests
that these galaxies have only just reached the red sequence
after a very slow evolution across the colour-magnitude di-
agram Considering their limited number and our require-
ment for NUV emission it is likely that these galaxies are
currently on the edge of the red sequence having recently
and nally moved out of the green valley Table 1 shows
that 39 of our sample are red sequence clean disc galax-
ies ie red late-type spirals This is within uncertainties in
agreement with the ndings of Masters et al 2010 who
nd  6 of late-type spirals are red when dened by a cut
in the g  r optical colour rather than with u  r as imple-
mented in this investigation and are at the blue end of the
red sequence
Despite the dominance of slow quenching timescales
the red disc galaxies also show some preference for rapid
quenching timescales 313 similar to the red smooth
galaxies but with a lower probability Perhaps these rapid
quenching timescales can also be attributed to a morphologi-
cal change suggesting that the quenching has occurred more
Smethurst et al 2014
rapidly than the morphological change to a bulge dominated
system
Comparing the resultant SFRs for both the smooth- and
disc-like galaxies in Figure 8 by noticing where the areas of
high probability lie with respect to the bottom panel of Fig-
ure 4 which shows the predicted SFR at an observation time
of t  128 Gyr the average observed time of the GZ2 pop-
ulation reveals that red disc galaxies with a preference for
slow quenching still have some residual star formation oc-
curring SFR  0105Mcid12yr1 whereas the smooth galaxies
with a dominant preference for rapid quenching have a re-
sultant SFR  00075Mcid12yr1 This is approximately 14
times less than the residual SFR still occurring in the red
sequence disc galaxies Within error this is in agreement
with the ndings of Tojeiro et al 2013 who by using the
VErsatile SPectral Analyses spectral tting code VESPA
Tojeiro et al 2007 found that red late-type spirals show 17
times more recent star formation than red elliptical galaxies
These results for the red galaxies investigated here with
NUV emission have many implications for green valley
galaxies as all of these systems must have passed through
the green valley on their way to the red sequence
43 Green Valley Galaxies
In Figure 9 we can make similar comparisons for the green
valley galaxies to those discussed previously for the subset
of red galaxies studied For the red galaxies an argument
can be made for two possible tracks across the green valley
shown by the bimodal nature of both distributions in  with
a common area in the intermediate timescales region where
the rapid and slow timescales peaked distributions inter-
sect However in the green valley this intermediate quench-
ing timescale region becomes more signicant in agreement
with the conclusions of Goncalves et al 2012 particularly
for the smooth-like galaxies see the left panel of Figure 9
The smooth galaxy parameters favour these intermedi-
ate quenching timescales 406 with some preference for
slow quenching at early times z  1 The preference for
rapid quenching of smooth galaxies has dropped by over a
half compared to the red galaxies however this will be in-
uenced by the observability of galaxies undergoing such
a rapid quench which will spend signicantly less time in
the transitional population of the green valley Those galax-
ies with such a rapid decline in star formation will pass so
quickly through the green valley they will be detected at
a lower number than those galaxies which have stalled in
the green valley with intermediate quenching timescales ac-
counting for the observed number of intermediate galaxies
which are present in the green valley and the dominance
of rapid timescales detected for red galaxies for both mor-
phologies
The disc galaxies of the green valley now overwhelm-
ingly prefer slow quenching timescales 474 with a similar
amount of intermediate quenching compared to the smooth
galaxy parameters 376 see Figure 9 There is still some
preference for galaxies with a star formation history which
results in a high current SFR suggesting there are also some
late-type galaxies that have just progressed from the blue
cloud into the green valley
If we compare Figure 9 to Figure 8 we can see quenching
has occurred at later more recent cosmic times in the green
valley at least for red galaxies for both morphological types
Therefore both morphologies are tracing the evolution of
the red sequence conrming that the green valley is indeed a
transitional population between blue cloud and red sequence
regardless of morphology Currently as we observe the green
valley its main constituents are very slowly evolving disc-like
galaxies along with intermediate- and smooth-like galaxies
which pass across it with intermediate timescales within 
10  15 Gyr
Given enough time t  4  5 Gyr the disc galaxies
will eventually fully pass through the green valley and make
it out to the red sequence the right panel of Figure 7 shows
galaxies with   10 Gyr do not approach the red sequence
within 3 Gyr post quench This is most likely the origin of
the red spirals
If we consider then that the green valley is a transitional
population then we can expect that the ratio of smoothdisc
galaxies that is currently observed in the green valley will
evolve into the ratio observed for the red galaxies with NUV
emission investigated Table 1 shows the ratio of smooth 
disc galaxies in the observed red sequence of the GZ2 sam-
ple is 62  38 whereas in the green valley it is 45  55 Mak-
ing the very simple assumptions that this ratio does not
change with redshift and that quenching is the only mecha-
nism which causes a morphological transformation we can
infer that 312 of the disc-dominated galaxies currently re-
siding in the green valley would have to undergo a morpho-
logical change to a bulge-dominated galaxy We nd that
the fraction of the probability for green valley disc galax-
ies occupying the parameter space   15 Gyr is 294
and therefore suggest that quenching mechanisms with these
timescales are capable of destroying the disc-dominated na-
ture of galaxies This is most likely an overestimate of the
mechanisms with timescales that can cause a morphological
change because of the observability of those galaxies which
undergo such a rapid quench Martin et al 2007 showed
that after considering the time spent in the green valley the
fraction of galaxies undergoing a rapid quench quadruples
All of this evidence suggests that there are not just two
routes for galaxies through the green valley as concluded by
S14 but a continuum of quenching timescales which we can
divide into three general regimes rapid   10 Gyr in-
termediate 10    20 Gyr and slow   20 Gyr
The intermediate quenching timescales reside in the space
between the extremes sampled by the UVoptical diagrams
of S14 the inclusion of the intermediate galaxies in this in-
vestigation unlike in S14 and the more precise Bayesian
analysis quanties this range of  and specically ties the
intermediate timescales to all variations of galaxy morphol-
44 Blue Cloud Galaxies
Since the blue cloud is considered to be primarily made of
star forming galaxies we expect starpy to have some dif-
culty in determining the most likely quenching model to
describe them as conrmed by Figure 10 The attempt to
characterise a star forming galaxy with a quenched SFH
model leads starpy to attribute the extremely blue colours
of the majority of these galaxies to fast quenching at recent
times ie very little change in the SFR see the right panel

The Star Formation History of the Green Valley

dimension for each parameter The dashed lines show the separation between rapid  Gyr  10 intermediate 10   Gyr  20
and slow  Gyr  20 quenching timescales with the fraction of the combined posterior probability distribution in each region shown
see Section 32

probability of each position see Section 32 and also by the morphological vote fractions from GZ2 to give the areas of high probability
in the model parameter space for both bulge left and disc right dominated systems The histograms show the projection into one
dimension for each parameter The dashed lines show the separation between rapid  Gyr  10 intermediate 10   Gyr  20
and slow  Gyr  20 quenching timescales with the fraction of the combined posterior probability distribution in each region shown
see Section 32 Positions with probabilities less than 02 are discarded as poorly t models therefore we can conclude unsurprisingly
that blue cloud galaxies are not well described by a quenching star formation model

Figure 11 Contours showing the positions in the t   parameter space of the median walker position the 50th percentile as shown by
the intersection of the solid blue lines in Figure 5 for each galaxy for all top disc pd  05 middle and smooth ps  05 bottom
red sequence green valley and blue cloud galaxies in the left middle and right panels respectively The error bars on each panel shows
the average 68 condence on the median positions calculated from the 16th and 84th percentile as shown by the blue dashed lines in
Figure 5 These positions were calculated without discarding any walker positions due to low probability and without weighting by vote
fractions therefore this plot may be more intuitive than Figures 8 9  10 The dierences between the smooth and disc populations
and between the red green and blue populations remain clearly apparent
of Figure 10 in comparison with the bottom panel of Fig-
ure 4
This is particularly apparent for the blue disc popula-
tion Perhaps even galaxies which are currently quenching
slowly across the blue cloud cannot be well t by the quench-
ing models implemented as they still have high SFRs despite
some quenching although a galaxy has undergone quench-
ing star formation can still occur in a galaxy just at a slower
rate than at earlier times described by  
There is a very small preference among blue bulge dom-
inated galaxies for slow quenching which began prior to
z  05 These populations have been blue for a consid-
erable period of time slowly using up their gas for star
formation by the KennicuttSchmidt law Schmidt 1959
Kennicutt 1997 However the major preference is for rapid
quenching at recent times in the blue cloud this therefore
provides some support to the theories for blue ellipticals as
either merger-driven  76 like those identied as recently
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
The Star Formation History of the Green Valley
quenched ellipticals with properties consistent with a merger
origin by McIntosh et al 2014 or gas inow-driven reinvig-
orated star formation that is now slowly decreasing  24
such as the population of blue spheroidal galaxies studied
by Kaviraj et al 2013 However we remind the reader that
the quenching models used in this work do not provide an
adequate t to the blue cloud population
The blue cloud is therefore primarily composed of both
star forming galaxies with any morphology and smooth
galaxies which are undergoing a rapid quench presumably
after a previous event triggered star formation and turned
them blue
5 DISCUSSION
We have implemented a Bayesian statistical analysis of the
star formation histories SFHs of a large sample of galax-
ies morphologically classied by Galaxy Zoo We have found
dierences between the SFHs of smooth- and disc-like galax-
ies across the colour-magnitude diagram in the red sequence
green valley and blue cloud In this section we will speculate
on the question what are the possible mechanisms driving
these dierences
51 Rapid Quenching Mechanisms
Rapid quenching is much more prevalent in smooth galaxies
than disc galaxies and the red galaxies with NUV emission
in this study are also much more likely to be characterised
by a rapid quenching model than green valley galaxies ig-
noring blue cloud galaxies due to their apparent poor t by
the quenching models see Figure 10 In the green valley
there is also a distinct lack of preference for rapid quenching
timescales with   05 Gyr however we must bear in mind
the observability of a rapid quenching history declines with
decreasing   Rapid mechanisms may be more common in
the green valley than seen in Figure 9 however this observ-
ability should not depend on morphology so we can still con-
clude that rapid quenching mechanisms are detected more
for smooth rather than disc galaxies This suggests that this
rapid quenching mechanism causes a change in morphol-
ogy from a disc- to a smooth-like galaxy as it quickly tra-
verses the colour-magnitude diagram to the red sequence
supported by the number of disc galaxies that would need
to undergo a morphological change in order for the disc 
smooth ratio of galaxies in the green valley to match that
of the red galaxies see Section 43 From this indirect ev-
idence we suggest that this rapid quenching mechanism is
due to major mergers
Inspection of the galaxies contributing to this area of
probability reveals that this does not arise due to currently
merging pairs missed by GZ users which were therefore not
excluded from the sample see Section 22 but by typi-
cal smooth galaxies with red optical and NUV colours that
the model attributes to rapid quenching at early times Al-
though a prescription for modelling a merger in the SFH is
not included in this work we can still detect the after eects
see Section 54 for future work planned with starpy
One simulation of interest by Springel Di Matteo 
Hernquist 2005 showed that feedback from black hole ac-
tivity is a necessary component of destructive major merg-
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
ers to produce such rapid quenching timescales Powerful
quasar outows remove much of the gas from the inner re-
gions of the galaxy terminating star formation on extremely
short timescales Bell et al 2006 using data from the
COMBO-17 redshift survey 04  z  08 estimate a
merger timescale from being classied as a close galaxy pair
to recognisably disturbed as  04 Gyr Springel Di Matteo
 Hernquist 2005 consequently nd using hydrodynami-
cal simulations that after  1 Gyr the merger remnant has
reddened to u  r  20 This is in agreement with our
simple quenching models which show Figure 7 that within
 1 Gyr the models with a SFH with   04 Gyr have
reached the red sequence with u  r cid38 22 This could ex-
plain the preference for red disc galaxies with rapid quench-
ing timescales 313 as they may have undergone a ma-
jor merger recently but are still undergoing a morphological
change from disc to disturbed to an eventual smooth galaxy
see also van der Wel et al 2009
We reiterate that this rapid quenching mechanism oc-
curs much more rarely in green valley galaxies of both mor-
phologies than for the subset of red sequence galaxies stud-
ied however does not fully characterise all the galaxies in
either the red sequence or green valley Dry major merg-
ers therefore do not fully account for the formation of any
galaxy type at any redshift supporting the observational
conclusions made by Bell et al 2007 Bundy et al 2007
Kaviraj 2014a and simulations by Genel et al 2008
52 Intermediate Quenching Mechanisms
Intermediate quenching timescales are found to be equally
prevalent across populations for both smooth and disc galax-
ies across cosmic time particularly in the green valley Inter-
mediate timescales are the prevalent mechanism for quench-
ing smooth green valley galaxies unlike the rapid quenching
prevalent for red galaxies We suggest that this intermediate
quenching route must therefore be possible with routes that
both preserve and transform morphology It is this result of
another route through the green valley that is in contradic-
tion with the ndings of S14
If we once again consider the simulations of Springel
Di Matteo  Hernquist 2005 this time without any feed-
back from black holes they suggest that if even a small
fraction of gas is not consumed in the starburst following a
merger either because the mass ratio is not large enough
or from the lack of strong black hole activity the remnant
can sustain star formation for periods of several Gyrs The
remnants from these simulations take  55 Gyr to reach
red optical colours of u  r  21 We can see from Figure 7
that the models with intermediate quenching timescales of
10 cid46  Gyr cid46 20 take approximately 25  55 Gyr to
reach these red colours
speculate
intermediate
quenching
timescales are caused by gas rich major mergers major
mergers without black hole feedback and from minor
mergers the latter of which is the dominant mechanism
This is supported by the ndings of Lotz et al 2008
who nd that the detectability timescales for equal mass
gas rich mergers with large initial separations range from
 1119 Gyr and of Lotz et al 2011 who nd in further
simulations that as the baryonic gas fraction in a merger
with mass ratios of 11-14 increases so does the timescale
Smethurst et al 2014
of the merger from  02 Gyr with little gas as above
for major mergers causing rapid quenching timescales
up to  15 Gyr with large gas fractions Here we are
assuming that the morphologically detectable timescale
of a merger is roughly the same order as the quenching
timescale However we must consider the existence of a
substantial population of blue ellipticals Schawinski et
al 2009 which are thought to be post-merger systems
with no detectable morphological signatures of a merger
but with the merger-induced starburst still detectable in
the photometry This photometry is an indicator for the
SFH and therefore should present with longer timescales
for the photometric eects of a merger than found in
the simulations by Lotz et al 2008 and Lotz et al
2011 Observing this link between the timescale for the
morphological observability of a merger and the timescales
for the star formation induced by a merger is problematic
as evidenced by the lack of literature on the subject
Lotz et al 2008 also show that the remnants of these
simulated equal mass gas rich disc mergers wet disc merg-
ers are observable for cid38 1 Gyr post merger and state that
they appear disc-like and dusty in the simulations which
is consistent with an early-type spiral morphology Such
galaxies are often observed to have spiral features with a
dominant bulge suggesting that such galaxies may divide
the votes of the GZ2 users producing vote fractions of
ps  pd  05 We believe this is why the intermediate
quenching timescales are equally dominant for both smooth
and disc galaxies across each population in Figures 8 and 9
Other simulations eg such as Robertson et al 2006
and Barnes 2002 support the conclusion that both gas
rich major mergers and minor mergers can produce disc-
like remnants Observationally Darg et al 2010 showed
an increase in the spiral to elliptical ratio for merging galax-
ies 0005  z  01 by a factor of two compared to the
general population They attribute this to the much longer
timescales during which mergers of spirals are observable
compared to mergers with elliptical galaxies conrming our
hypothesis that the quenching timescales   15 Gyr pre-
ferred by disc galaxies may be undergoing mergers which will
eventually lead to a morphological change Similarly Cas-
teels et al 2013 observe that galaxies 001  z  009
which are interacting often retain their spiral structures and
that a spiral galaxy which has been classied as having loose
winding arms by the GZ2 users are often entering the early
stages of mergers and interactions
406 of the probability for smooth galaxies in the green
valley arises due to intermediate quenching timescales see
Figure 9 this is in agreement with work done by Kaviraj
2014ab who by studying SDSS photometry z  007
state that approximately half of the star formation in galax-
ies is driven by minor mergers at 05  z  07 therefore ex-
hausting available gas for star formation and consequently
causing a gradual decline in the star formation rate This
supports earlier work by Kaviraj et al 2011 who using
multi wavelength photometry of galaxies in COSMOS Scov-
ille et al 2007 found that 70 of early-type galaxies appear
morphologically disturbed suggesting either a minor or ma-
jor merger in their history This is in agreement with the to-
tal percentage of probability with   20 Gyr 739 and
593 for the smooth red and green galaxies in Figures 8
and 9 respectively Note that the star formation model used
here is a basic one and has no prescription for reignition of
star formation post-quench which can also cause morpholog-
ical disturbance of a galaxy like those detected by Kaviraj
et al 2011
Darg et al 2010 show in their Figure 6 that that be-
yond a merger ratio of 1  10 up to  1  100 green is
the dominant average galaxy colour of the visually identi-
ed merging pair in GZ These mergers are also dominated
by spiral-spiral mergers as opposed to elliptical-elliptical and
elliptical-spiral This supports our hypothesis that these in-
termediate timescales dominating in the green valley are
caused in part by minor mergers This is contradictory to
the ndings of Mendez et al 2011 who nd the merger
fraction in the green valley is much lower than in the blue
cloud however they use an analytical light decomposition
indicator GiniM20 see Lotz et al 2008 to identify their
mergers which tend to detect major mergers more easily
than minor mergers We have discussed the lower likelihood
of a green valley galaxy to undergo a rapid quench which
we have attributed to major mergers see Section 51 de-
spite the caveat of the observability and believe that this
may have been the phenomenon that Mendez et al 2011
detected
The resultant intermediate quenching timescales occur
due to one interaction mechanism unlike the rapid quench-
ing which occurs due to a major merger combined with
AGN feedback and decreases the SFR over a short period
of time Therefore any external event which can cause ei-
ther a burst of star formation depleting the gas available
or directly strip a galaxy of its gas for example galaxy ha-
rassment interactions ram pressure stripping strangulation
and interactions internal to clusters would cause quench-
ing on an intermediate timescale Such mechanisms would
be the dominant cause of quenching in dense environments
considering that the majority of galaxies reside in groups
or clusters Coil et al 2008 nd that green valley galax-
ies are just as clustered as red sequence galaxies it is not
surprising that the majority of our galaxies are considered
intermediate in morphology see Table 1 and therefore are
undergoing or have undergone such an interaction
53 Slow Quenching Timescales
Although intermediate and rapid quenching timescales are
the dominant mechanisms across the colour-magnitude di-
agram together they cannot completely account for the
quenching of disc galaxies S14 concluded that slow quench-
ing timescales were the most dominant mechanism for disc
galaxies However we show that i intermediate quenching
timescales are equally important in the green valley and ii
rapid quenching timescales are equally important for red
galaxies with NUV emission There is also a signicantly
lower preference for smooth galaxies to undergo such slow
quenching timescales suggesting that the evolution or in-
deed creation of typical smooth galaxies is dominated by
processes external to the galaxy This is excepting galaxies
in the blue cloud where a small amount of slow evolution
of blue ellipticals is occurring presumably after a reinvig-
oration of star formation which is slowly depleting the gas
available according to the KennicuttSchmidt law
Bamford et al 2009 using GZ1 vote fractions of galax-
ies in the SDSS found a signicant fraction of high stellar

The Star Formation History of the Green Valley
mass red spiral galaxies in the eld As these galaxies are
isolated from the eects of interactions from other galaxies
the slow quenching mechanisms present in their preferred
star formation histories are most likely due to secular pro-
cesses ie mechanisms internal to the galaxy in the absence
of sudden accretion or merger events Kormendy  Kenni-
cutt 2004 Sheth et al 2012 Bar formation in a disc galaxy
is such a mechanism whereby gas is funnelled to the centre
of the galaxy by the bar over long timescales where it is used
for star formation Masters et al 2012 Saintonge et al 2012
Cheung et al 2013 consequently forming a pseudo-bulge
Kormendy et al 2010 Simmons et al 2013
If we believe that these slow quenching timescales are
due to secular evolution processes this is to be expected
since these processes do not change the disc dominated na-
ture of a galaxy
54 Future Work
Due to the exibility of our model we believe that the
starpy module will have a signicant number of future
applications including the investigation of various dierent
SFHs eg constant SFR and starbursts Considering the
number of magnitude bands available across the SDSS fur-
ther analysis will also be possible with a larger set of optical
and NUV colours providing further constraints and to en-
sure a more complete sample containing a larger fraction
of typical red sequence galaxies if the need for NUV pho-
tometry was replaced with another band It would also be
of interest to consider galaxies at higher redshift eg out
to z  1 with Hubble Space Telescope photometry and the
GZHubble project see Melvin et al 2014 for rst results
and consider dierent redshift bins in order to study the
build up of the red sequence with cosmic time
With further use of the robust detailed GZ2 classica-
tions we believe that starpy will be able to distinguish
any statistical dierence in the star formation histories of
barred vs non-barred galaxies This will require a simple
swap of ps pd with pbar pnobar from the available GZ2
vote fractions We believe that this will aid in the discussion
of whether bars act to quench star formation by funnelling
gas into the galaxy centre or promote star formation by
causing an increase in gas density as it travels through the
disc both sides of which have been ercely argued Masters
et al 2011 2012 Sheth et al 2005 Ellison et al 2011
Further application of the starpy code could be to in-
vestigate the SFH parameters of
i Currently merginginteracting pairs in comparison to
those galaxies classied as merger remnants from their de-
gree of morphological disturbance
ii Slow rotators and fast rotators which are thought to
result from dry major mergers on the red sequence Em-
sellem et al 2011 and gas rich wet major mergers Em-
sellem et al 2007 respectively
iii Field and cluster galaxies using the projected neigh-
bour density  from Baldry et al 2006

6 CONCLUSION
We have used morphological classications from the Galaxy
Zoo 2 project to determine the morphology-dependent star
formation histories of galaxies via a Bayesian analysis of
an exponentially declining star formation quenching model
We determined the most likely parameters for the quenching
onset time tq and quenching timescale  in this model for
galaxies across the blue cloud green valley and red sequence
to trace galactic evolution across the colour-magnitude di-
agram We nd that the green valley is indeed a transi-
tional population for all morphological types in agreement
with Schawinski et al 2014 however this transition pro-
ceeds slowly for the majority of disc-like galaxies and occurs
rapidly for the majority of smooth-like galaxies in the red
sequence However in addition to Schawinski et al 2014
our Bayesian approach has revealed a more nuanced result
specically that the prevailing mechanism across all mor-
phologies and populations is quenching with intermediate
timescales Our main ndings are as follows
i The subset of red sequence galaxies with NUV emis-
sion studied in this investigation are found to have similar
preferences for quenching timescales compared to the green
valley galaxies but occurs at earlier quenching times re-
gardless of morphology see Figures 8 and 9 Therefore the
quenching mechanisms currently occurring in the green val-
ley were also active in creating the blue end of of the red
sequence at earlier times conrming that the green valley is
indeed a transitional population regardless of morphology
ii We conrm that the typical red galaxy with NUV
emission studied in this investigation is elliptical in mor-
phology and conclude that it has undergone a rapid to in-
termediate quench at some point in cosmic time resulting
in a very low current SFR see Section 42
iii The green valley as it is currently observed is dom-
inated by very slowly evolving disc-like galaxies along with
intermediate- and smooth-like galaxies which pass across it
with intermediate timescales within  10  15 Gyr see
Section 43
iv There are many dierent timescales responsible for
quenching causing a galaxy to progress through the green
valley which are dependant on galaxy type with the
smooth- and disc-like galaxies each having dierent dom-
inant star formation histories across the colour-magnitude
diagram These timescales can be roughly split into three
main regimes rapid   10 Gyr intermediate 10 
 Gyr  20 and slow   20 Gyr quenching
v Blue cloud galaxies are not well t by a quenching
model of star formation due to the continuous high star
formation rates occurring see Figure 10
vi Rapid quenching timescales are detected with a lower
probability for green valley galaxies than the subset of red
sequence galaxies studied We speculate that this quench-
ing mechanism is caused by major mergers with black hole
feedback which are able to expel the remaining gas not ini-
tially exhausted in the merger-induced starburst and which
can cause a change in morphology from disc- to bulge-
dominated The colour-change timescales from previous sim-
ulations of such events agree with our derived timescales
see Section 51 These rapid timescales are instrumental in
forming red galaxies however galaxies at the current epoch
Smethurst et al 2014
passing through the green valley do so at more intermediate
timescales see Figure 9
California Institute of Technology under NASA contract
NAS5-98034
vii Intermediate quenching timescales 10   Gyr 
20 are found with constant probability across red and green
galaxies for both smooth- and disc-like morphologies the
timescales for which agree with observed and simulated mi-
nor merger timescales see Section 52 We hypothesise such
timescales can be caused by a number of external processes
including gas rich major mergers mergers without black hole
feedback galaxy harassment interactions and ram pressure
stripping The timescales and observed morphologies from
previous studies agree with our ndings including that this
is the dominant mechanisms for intermediate galaxies such
as early-type spiral galaxies with spiral features but a dom-
inant bulge which split the GZ2 vote fractions see Sec-
tion 52
viii Slow quenching timescales are the most dominant
mechanism in the disc galaxy populations across the colour-
magnitude diagram Disc galaxies are often found in the
eld therefore we hypothesise that such slow quenching
timescales are caused by secular evolution and processes in-
ternal to the galaxy see Section 44 We also detect a small
amount of slow quenching timescales for blue elliptical galax-
ies which we attribute to a reinvigoration of star formation
the peak of which has passed and has started to decline by
slowly depleting the gas available see Section 44
ix Due to the exibility of this model we believe that
the starpy module compiled for this investigation will have
a signicant number of future applications including the
dierent star formation histories of barred vs non-barred
galaxies merging vs merger remnants fast vs slow rotat-
ing elliptical galaxies and cluster vs eld galaxies see Sec-

APPENDIX A TESTING STARPY
In order to test that starpy can nd the correct quenching
model for a given observed colour 25 synthesised galaxies
were created with known SFHs ie known values of  from
which optical and NUV colours were generated These were
Smethurst et al 2014
Figure A1 Results from starpy for an array of synthesised galaxies with known ie true tq and  values marked by the red lines
using the complete function to calculate the predicted colour of a proposed set of  values in each MCMC iteration assuming an error
on the calculated known colours of ur  0124 and N U V u  0215 the average errors on the GZ sample colours In each case
starpy succeeds in locating the true parameter values within the degeneracies of the star formation history model These degeneracies
can clearly be seen in Figure 4
input into starpy to ensure that the known values of 
were reproduced within error for each of the 25 synthesised
galaxies Figure A1 shows the results for each of these 25
synthesised galaxies with the known values of  shown by
the red lines In some cases this red line does not coincide
with the peak of the distribution shown in the histograms
for one parameter however in all cases the intersection of
the red lines is within the sample contours
We nd peaks in the histograms across all areas of the
parameter space in both dimensions of t   this ensures
that the results presented in Figures 8 9  10 arise due to
a superposition of extended probability distributions as op-
posed to a bimodal distribution of probability distributions
across all galaxies

colour of a proposed set of  values in each MCMC iteration The median walker position the 50th percentile of the Bayesian probability
distribution is shown by the solid blue line with the dashed lines encompassing 681 of the samples the 16th and 84th percentile
positions The time taken to run for a single galaxy using this method is approximately 2 hours Right panel Results from starpy for

APPENDIX B USING LOOK UP TABLES
Considering the size of the sample in this investigation
of 126 316 galaxies total a three dimensional look up ta-
ble in observed time quenching time and quenching rate
was generated using the star formation history function in
starpy to speed up the run time Figure B1 shows an ex-
ample of how using the look up table in place of the full
function does not aect the results to a signicant level
Table B quotes the median walker positions the 50th per-
centile of the Bayesian probability distribution along with
their 1 ranges for both methods in comparison to the true
values specied to test starpy The uncertainties incorpo-
rated into the quoted values by using the look up table are
therefore minimal with a maximum   0043
APPENDIX C DISCARDING POORLY FIT
GALAXIES
We discard walker positions returned by starpy with a cor-
responding probability of P kdk  02 in order to exclude
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
galaxies which are not well t by the quenching model for
example blue cloud galaxies which are still star forming will
be poorly t by a quenching model see Section 31 This
raises the issue of whether we exclude a signicant fraction
of our galaxy sample and whether those galaxies reside in
a specic location of the colour-magnitude The fraction of
galaxies which had all or more than half of their walker po-
sitions discarded due to low probability are shown in Table
This is not a signicant fraction of either population
therefore this shows that the starpy module is eective in
tting the majority of galaxies and that this method of dis-
carding walker positions ensures that poorly t galaxies are
removed from the analysis of the results Figure C1 shows
that these galaxies with discarded walker positions are also
scattered across the optical-NUV colour-colour diagram and
therefore starpy is also eective in tting galaxies across
this entire plane

galaxies from the analysis which were poorly t by this quenching model

QUENCHING GALAXIES
The numbers of galaxies found undergoing a rapid quench
will be underestimated compared to the true value due to
their observability ie their time spent in the green valley
is extremely short so detecting a galaxy there is dicult

model parameter space of star formation histories and the
results are shown below in Figure D1
