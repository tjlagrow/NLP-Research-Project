ABSTRACT
We investigate the evolution of dark and luminous matter in the central regions of
early-type galaxies ETGs up to z  08 We use a spectroscopically selected sam-
ple of 154 cluster and eld galaxies from the EDisCS survey covering a wide range
in redshifts z  0408 stellar masses log MM  105115 dex and velocity
dispersions   100300 kms We obtain central dark matter DM fractions
by determining the dynamical masses from Jeans modelling of galaxy aperture veloc-
ity dispersions and the M from galaxy colours and compare the results with local
samples We discuss how the correlations of central DM with galaxy size ie the eec-
tive radius Re M and  evolve as a function of redshift nding clear indications
that local galaxies are on average more DM dominated than their counterparts at
larger redshift This DM fraction evolution with z can be only partially interpreted
as a consequence of the sizeredshift evolution We discuss our results within galaxy
formation scenarios and conclude that the growth in size and DM content which we
measure within the last 7 Gyr is incompatible with passive evolution while it is well
reproduced in the multiple minor merger scenario We also discuss the impact of the
IMF on our DM inferences and argue that this can be non-universal with the look-
back time In particular we nd the Salpeter IMF can be better accommodated by
low redshift systems while producing stellar masses at highz which are unphysically
larger than the estimated dynamical masses particularly for lower- systems

INTRODUCTION
Dark matter DM is a ubiquitous component of the uni-
verse It dominates the mass density of virialized objects and
has left its imprint at cosmological scales during the cosmic
history eg Komatsu et al 2011 In the last decade the
large wealth of data from large sky surveys such as eg
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS Abazajian et al 2003
Adelman-McCarthy et al 2008 Abazajian et al 2009 have
established that the DM budget is up to  85 of the to-

tal mass density of the universe Numerical simulations of
DM only structure formation within the consensus cos-
mology framework ie the CDM model have provided
accurate predictions on the DM density distribution in
galaxies and clusters Navarro et al 1996 hereafter NFW
Bullock et al 2001 Maccio et al 2008 More realistic mod-
els which have tried to evaluate the eect of baryons on
the DM distribution have been characterized either through
some approximate recipes such as the adiabatic contraction
eg Gnedin et al 2004 which seems compatible with ob-
servations eg Gnedin et al 2007 Napolitano et al 2010
or to the simultaneous evolutions of the two components
Tortora C et al
Wu et al 2014 making predictions on the expected DM
fractions in the central galaxy regions Hilz et al 2013
Within this context the study of the mass density dis-
tribution and the dark-to-baryonic mass ratio of early-type
galaxies ETGs ellipticals and lenticulars is a crucial prob-
lem that has to be addressed in a systematic way as these
systems contain most of the cosmic stellar mass of the uni-
verse and represent the nal stage of galaxy evolution and
contain the fossil record of the stellar and DM assembly

Most of the current understanding of these systems is
based on local galaxy samples These have shown that the
overall DM content depends crucially on the galaxy mass
scale which is possibly the eect of the overall star for-

galaxy regions
Generally speaking it has been shown that the central
DM fraction typically within one eective radius Re here-
after is larger in more massive and largesized galaxies eg

2011 Tortora et al 2012 even though there are also oppo-
site claims from other studies eg Grillo et al 2009 Grillo
2010 Grillo  Gobat 2010 Although these trends are qual-
itatively unchanged independently of the adopted galaxy
model or initial mass function IMF eg Cardone et al
2009 Cardone  Tortora 2010 Cardone et al 2011 they
can still be strongly aected by the assumptions on the
stellar ML
ie a non-homologous constant prole as
veried for the trend of the DM fraction as a func-
tion of mass eg Trujillo et al 2004 T09 Tortora et al
2012 The inventory of the evidences accumulated so far
is complicated if one takes into account the eect of a
non universal IMF Treu et al 2010 Thomas et al 2011

which remains the largest source of uncertainty since a sys-
tematic variation of the IMF with mass from a bottom-
lighter IMF for low mass systems to a bottom-heavier IMF in
massive galaxies would wipe out the apparent DM fraction
trend with mass eg Thomas et al 2011 Tortora et al
A robust assessment of all these correlations is crucial
to have a clearer insight into the assembly of the two main
galaxy components stars and DM and thus into the forma-
tion mechanisms across time Unfortunately with the cur-
rently available individual datasets which generally cover
small windows in redshift space it is not possible to extend
the investigation of the scaling relations found at lowerz to
earlier epochs but see for instance Auger et al 2009 2010
Tortora et al 2010b Sonnenfeld et al 2013 for gravitational
lenses Only by accumulating data from dierent samples
a more systematic study of the DM fraction evolution with
redshift is becoming possible
This has been done eg using weak andor strong
lensing analyses eg Heymans et al 2006 Lagattuta et al
2010 to nd that at higher redshift results point to an evolu-
tion of the total virial-to-stellar ratio that is larger at higher
redshift For the central DM content results are still in-
conclusive as both lower DM fractions Faure et al 2011
within the Einstein radius or larger ones Ru et al 2011
within Re2 have been found However the latter studies
are based on limited galaxy samples with dierent model
choices eg on adopted scales at which the DM fractions
are derived thus their conclusions are prone to uncertain-
ties which are dicult to keep under control
Instead homogeneous approaches on well
studied
highz samples are still missing Only recently using mas-
sive galaxies from SDSS-IIIBOSS combined with a sam-
ple from SDSS-II Beiori et al 2014 have addressed the
question providing evidences that high-z ETGs are less DM
dominated than their local counterparts However further
independent analysis are needed to constrain not only the
overall evolution of central DM but also how it correlates
with mass or galaxy size and how these correlations change
as a function of redshift
The EDisCS sample White et al 2005 Saglia et al
2010 includes ETGs in a wide range of redshifts  0408
for which accurate photometry structural parameters and
central velocity dispersions are available This provides us a
rare opportunity to investigate the evolution of the central
DM content comparing these results with inferences in local
galaxy samples
The paper is organized as follows Data samples and
the analysis performed are introduced in Sect 2 The
evolution of the relations between size and velocity dis-
persion with stellar mass are discussed in Sect 3 while
Sect 4 is devoted to the analysis of central DM content
its evolution with redshift systematics and the interpre-
tation within the formation scenarios Conclusions and fu-
ture prospects are discussed in Sect 5 We adopt a cos-
mological model with m  h  03 07 075 where

2 SAMPLES AND DATA ANALYSIS
The aim of this paper is to present a uniform dynamical anal-
ysis for galaxies distributed on a wide redshift window As
higher-redshift galaxies we will use the sample from EDisCS
survey Saglia et al 2010 with covers a redshift window
from z  04 to z  08 As z  0 comparison samples we
use the data from SPIDER project La Barbera et al 2010
ATLAS3D Cappellari et al 2011 and from Tortora et al
2009 In the following we will provide further details about
data samples adopted
21 EDisCS sample data
The EDisCS survey White et al 2005 Saglia et al 2010
provides photometric and spectroscopic data for ETGs in
eld and rich clusters with 04  z  08 and stellar mass
completeness limit at log MM  104 We limit the anal-
ysis to objects with spectroscopic measurements as these
provide us accurate redshifts and internal kinematics The
nal sample which we will use for this analysis has been fur-
ther selected to have weak OII lines in order to remove
late-type galaxies and contains 41 eld galaxies and 113 in
clusters
For these systems circularized HST I-band eective
radii Re and Sersic tting indices n are available
The average slit width of the spectral observations
from which velocity dispersion have been derived has been
converted to an equivalent circular aperture of radius 
1025 x where x is the slit width in arcsec The ratio
between spectral aperture and the eective radius RapRe
amounts to  15 with a tail to higher ratios
As reference stellar masses we have taken the ones from
Saglia et al 2010 using rest-frame absolute photometry
derived from SED tting Rudnick et al 2009 adopting the
calibrations of Bell  de Jong 2001 with a diet Salpeter
IMF and B  V colors These masses are re-normalized to
a Chabrier IMF subtracting  01 dex accordingly to re-
sults in Tortora et al 2009 Our masses are in very good
agreement with those in Vulcani et al 2011
22 High z sample dynamics of EDisCS galaxies
the analysis
in Tortora et al
Following
2009 and
Tortora et al 2012 we model the velocity dispersion of
each individual galaxy using the spherical isotropic Jeans
equations and hence estimate the total dynamical mass
Mdyn which hereafter we will refer to as Mtot within
r  1 Re
In the Jeans equations the stellar density is provided
by the Sersic t of the photometric data and the total DM
 stars mass is assumed to have the form of a Singular
Isothermal Sphere SIS from which M r  2
SISr where
SIS is the model 3D velocity dispersion
The isothermal prole has been found to provide
a robust description of the mass distribution in mas-
sive ETGs
eg Kochanek 1991 Bolton et al 2006
Koopmans et al 2006 Gavazzi et al 2007 Bolton et al
2008 Auger et al 2009 Auger et al 2010 Chae et al 2014
Oguri et al 2014 and in particular the massive dark ha-
los dominating the outer regions of galaxies Benson et al
2000 Marinoni  Hudson 2002 Napolitano et al 2005
Gavazzi et al 2007 van den Bosch et al 2007 This con-
spiracy
Koopmans et al 2006 Gavazzi et al 2007 Auger et al
2010 seems to be motivated also by theoretical arguments
as the stellar body and dark halos can produce an overall
isothermal prole after having gone through the processes
of gas contraction and star formation Koopmans et al
2006 Remus et al 2013 For further details on the sys-
tematics introduced by the particular model choice one
can refer to Tortora et al 2009 and Tortora et al 2012

We use three local data-sets of ETGs to compare with
highz results For these samples we have performed the
same dynamical analysis and use similar assumptions for the
stellar and total density proles as the ones for the highz
sample discussed in Sect 22 Here below some details of
the local data-sets
 SPIDER This is the widest local data sample analyzed
in this paper consisting of  4300 giant ETGs in the red-
shift range of z  00501 La Barbera et al 2010 The
data-set includes opticalnear-infrared photometry from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS and the UKIRT In-
frared Deep Sky Survey-Large Area Survey high-quality
measurements of galactic structural parameters eective
radius Re and Sersic index n and SDSS central-aperture
velocity dispersions Ap The sample galaxies are dened as
bulge dominated systems with passive spectra while late-
type systems are removed through the SDSS classication
parameters based on the spectral type and the fraction of
light which is better described by a de Vaucouleurs 1948
prole see T12 for further details The sample is 95
complete at the stellar mass M  3  1010 M which cor-
responds to Ap  160 kms The SPS-based stellar mass-to-
light ratios  were derived by tting Bruzual  Charlot
2003 models to the multi-band photometry assuming a
Chabrier IMF see Swindle et al 2011 and Tortora et al
2012 for further details A de-projected Sersic law in the
K-band is used to describe the density prole of the stellar
component Then both the light prole and total masses are
calculated at g-band Re which rest-frame is approximately

be discussed too

the n  LB correlation in Prugniel  Simien 1997 Vmax
is dened as the quadratic sum of the maximum rotation
on the major and minor axes and is taken into account in
the dynamical modelling Selecting galaxies with at least
two measured colours brighter than MB  16 and further
limiting the sample to ellipticals and lenticulars we are left
with  360 See Tortora et al 2009 for further details on
the sample selection and analysis B-band as g-band ap-
proximates very well the rest-frame of I-band measurements
in EDisCS galaxies
 ATLAS3D This sample is originally constituted of
260 ETGs from the ATLAS3D survey Cappellari et al
2013ba About 15 of the sample have signicant gradi-
ents of the stellar mass-to-light ratio as inferred by their
young stellar populations H equivalent width greater than
23 A We exclude these systems and retain a sample of 224
galaxies The relevant data for each galaxy include the ef-
fective radius Re obtained by renormalizing their Re from

The Chabrier 2001 IMF yields stellar masses that are

ther details
These three local samples allow us to evaluate the im-
pact on the results of a the prescription for light distri-
bution proles b the apertures used to measure velocity

3 SIZE-MASS AND FABER-JACKSON
EVOLUTION
A simple monolithic-like scenario where the bulk of the stars
is formed in a single dissipative event followed by a pas-
sive evolution is not longer supported by the observations
while it is becoming increasingly evident the occurrence of a
strong mass and size evolution in ETGs Trujillo et al 2006
Trujillo et al 2011
For the analysis we want to perform we are interested at
comparing some relevant correlations found in local galaxies
as the ones between the galaxy size ie Re and the stellar
mass M and the one between the velocity dispersion and
M see eg Tortora et al 2009 La Barbera et al 2010
Cappellari et al 2013b with the same for highz galaxies
Saglia et al 2010
In Fig 1 we show the ReM relation for each galaxy of
the four samples colorized according to their central veloc-
ity dispersion This gure provides insights on the covariance
among the stellar and dynamical parameters relevant in our
analysis we will adopt a similar approach in the next Section
when we will discuss the central DM content Both low- and
high-z galaxies follow the typical positive ReM relation It
is also evident that a similar positive correlation exists be-
tween e and M independently of the redshift as higher-e
galaxies are more concentrated at the higher stellar masses
and lower-e are found toward lower stellar masses both for
high-z and the low-z samples This is made clearer in Fig 2
where we show the median results of the EDisCS sample
compared face-to-face to the three local samples The cor-
relations for each data sample are quantied with a loglog
t and the best-t parameters are reported in Table 1
Consistently with the local observations and indepen-
dently of dierences in the bands adopted for the Res the
EDisCS sample presents the same size-mass trend with
more massive galaxies being lerger top panels in Fig 2
and Table 1 All the correlations are signicant at more
than 99 Moreover at xed mass the highz galaxies in
the EDisCS sample show a systematic oset toward smaller
radii with respect to the same quantities for the local sam-
ples ie they are more compact at all masses The same is
found for the Sersic indices not shown which are smaller
than the local values Instead the slope of the size-mass for
the EDisCS sample is identical to the ones of most of the
samples analyzed and a bit shallower than SPIDER sample1
The high-z galaxies are on average  2  4 times smaller
than local SPIDER galaxies while only  2 smaller than
the other local samples T09 and ATLAS3D If K-band
Res are used for SPIDER galaxies then the dierence with
respect to the high-z sample becomes more similar to that
found for the other local samples
We have also split the highz sample in two further bins
to see whether there is the signature of a further evolution
with z within the EDiSC sample itself The two subsamples
are selected to have redshifts 6 06 and  06 and have
median redshifts of 052 and 075 respectively We nd that
the trends are almost unchanged see Table 1 and that there
is possibly a further evolution in the intrinsic size toward
more compact Re at higherz Saglia et al 2010
Going to the correlations between velocity dispersion
and stellar mass this is also seen in the EDisCS sample
bottom panels in Fig 2 and Table 1 At xed stellar mass
no signicant evidence of evolution is found with respect to
the local samples except a marginal oset at M  1011 M
which shows smaller e than the ones in EDisCS In this case
the spitting of the EDisCS in two z bins does not show any
further evolution signatures see Fig 2 and Table 1
This mild evolution in velocity dispersion is consistent
with predictions from galaxy mergers Hopkins et al 2009
Cenarro  Trujillo 2009 but not with the pung up sce-
nario in Fan et al 2008 which would produce a stronger
change with redshift
The results shown in Figs 1 and 2 do not take into
account the progenitor bias for which low-z ETG samples
contain galaxies that have stopped their star formation only
recently and that would not be recognized as ETGs at higher
redshifts In particular a morphologically selected local sam-
ple of ETGs as the ones we have analyzed contains sys-
tems with relatively young ages that when evolved back to
match the high-z sample would not be recognized as being
passive objects van Dokkum  Franx 2001 Saglia et al
2010 Valentinuzzi et al 2010ab For the SPIDER sam-
ple luminosity-weighted ages are available Swindle et al
2011 These ages are derived from the spectral tting code
STARLIGHT Cid Fernandes et al 2005 which nds the
best combination of SSPs with free age metallicity and
alpha-enhancement which reproduce the measured spectra
Thus we only take those SPIDER objects which have an
age  15 Gyr at the average redshift of the EDisCS sam-
ple ie older than 75 Gyr On the contrary for the T09
data sample ages estimated tting exponential SFs with
characteristic timescale   to optical colours are available
Tortora et al 2009 Napolitano et al 2010 For these rea-
sons we have only taken those systems that after a time
 corresponding to the epoch when the SF is reduced to
37 of the initial value are older than the look-back time
at the average redshift of the sample The results are fairly
unchanged if we use the epoch when the SF is  14 of the
initial value ie at the epoch 2  Ages for ATLAS3D are
1 The shallower size-mass relations found in T09 and ATLAS3D
with respect to SPIDER sample are explained by the fact that
tting a high-n galaxy with a de Vaucouleurs prole gives a sys-
tematically smaller Re value hence attening the size-mass rela-

not available for this reason the impact of progenitor bias
will not be discussed for this dataset
The outcomes for such old systems are shown in Fig 2
as red and green lines for SPIDER and T09 data samples
respectively The impact on the results is very weak eg
Belli et al 2014 and it is possibly more relevant in the
eM correlation We notice that in the two datasamples
the impact of the progenitor bias pushes the Re in the two
opposite directions since the correlation between Re with
galaxy age is still controversial In fact contrasting results
are found by observational analysis which nd that at xed
mass younger systems are larger Shankar  Bernardi
2009 Napolitano et al 2010 Valentinuzzi et al 2010a or
are as sized as older galaxies Graves et al 2009 The
outcomes from semi-analytic galaxy formation models are
also still unclear as there are results showing that younger
galaxies are larger Khochfar  Silk 2006 or also smaller
Shankar et al 2010 than the oldest systems
Despite these uncertainties in the following we will dis-
cuss the results with and without the progenitor bias for

4 DARK MATTER EVOLUTION
In this section we investigate the galaxy central DM con-
tent as a function of z To quantify that we will use ei-
ther the de-projected DM fraction at Re fDM  1 
MReMtotRe or the deprojected total-to-stellar mass
ratio at Re MtotReMRe This latter will be useful to
avoid unphysical negative fDM values in particular when
computing the best-t relations among galaxy parameters
From the previous section we have seen that there is
almost no evolution in the relation eM and this might
suggest that so would be for the MtotrMr if the e
is a fair proxy of the total mass On the other hand we
have observed a strong evolution of the Re with the stellar
mass which shows that the scale where most of the mass
in stars is conned was more compact in the earlier epochs
with respect to present time even in case the progenitor
bias is taken into account Thus in the second part of the
present section we will discuss the role of this size evolution
on our DM inferences
41 DM content and correlations
In Fig 3 we start by re-proposing the ReM and eM
correlations see Fig 1 now colorised according to the

tion of Re M and e in Fig 4 and the best-tted relations

411 Results
As for the ReM and eM correlations in local galax-
ies the DM trends are nearly independent of the sample
adopted In agreement with the local samples the high-z
galaxies from EDisCS preserve almost all the DM trends
against stellar mass central velocity dispersion and eec-
tive radius see Figs 3 and 4 with almost all correlations
being signicant at more than 99 However a clear o-
set in the correlations is evident In Fig 3 we nd that at
xed M EDisCS galaxies present similar e but smaller
Re and MtotM with respect to local galaxy samples This
is made even clearer in Fig 4 where the MtotM median re-
lations are shown Here the EDisCS galaxies are more DM
dominated at larger Re and e ie they follow a positive
correlation along a trend which runs almost parallel to the
local sample but shifted toward lower MtotM see Table
2 In particular we note that at any xed Re the EDisCS
sample presents MtotM of  015  025 dex smaller than
the ones at lowz These dierences are all signicant at
more than 3 as evident from the linear regressions in Ta-
ble 2 If Re was the only responsible of the MtotM  z
variation one would expect statistically no variation of the
MtotM  Re with z
In the same Fig 4 we also observe that the change
in MtotM is stronger at any xed M and e being the
average oset between the high and low redshift samples
of MtotM  03  035 dex and  05  06 dex respec-
tively for the two quantities Particularly interesting is the
MtotM  M correlation which changes the slope from
the low to the highz trend although consistent within
the errors with null value see Table 2 This latter to-
gether with the presence of a marginal evolution also of the
MtotM  Re in the top panel show that the MtotM
evolution with z cannot be driven by the Re only although
previous analyses have shown that the main driver of most
of the scaling relations involving the central DM fraction
in ETGs is the eective radius eg Napolitano et al 2010
Auger et al 2010 Tortora et al 2010b 2012 and there are
accumulating evidences that Re scales with the redshift
Trujillo et al 2006 Saglia et al 2010 Trujillo et al 2011
see also the top panels of Fig 2 Despite the fact that the
Rez relation might be a key factor for interpreting the
MtotM  z trend there have to be mechanisms related to
the global stellar and dark mass assembly which also shape
the MtotM trend with z We will discuss the possible the
evolution scenarios later in 42 here we note that tak-
ing the current MtotM results at face values it is evident
from Figs 3 and 4 the evolution of this quantity which has
increased with time across the last  7 Gyr Indeed this ob-
served evolution in MtotM is also found if we split EDisCS
sample in two redshift bins see Fig 4 and Table 2
In Fig 5 we summarise the average results for the
Chabrier IMF and the bottom-heavier Salpeter IMF this
time represented as the DM fraction fDM as a function of
redshift on the right axes the corresponding MtotM are
also shown It is now explicitly evident the increasing trend
of the fDM at lower z which is the consequence of the o-
set of the MtotM between the low- and high-z samples
as discussed before In the same gure we plot the regions
of unphysical fDM as a shadowed area Here the lower
MtotM of the highz sample green points in Fig 3 im-
plies a much higher fraction of unphysical negative fDM 57
out 154 galaxies ie 37 assuming a Chabrier IMF which
becomes even more dramatic if a Salpeter IMF is assumed
115 out of 154 ie 75 A fraction of these galaxies with
negative fDM would be compatible with observational scat-
ter in M and Mtot eg Appendix A in Napolitano et al
2010 However it is dicult to explain all the negative fDM
as a consequence of this observational scatter rather this
may suggests that the bottom-heavy Salpeter IMF is dis-
favoured with respect to a Chabrier IMF
Hence the inferred fDM from a Salpeter IMF or
bottom-heavier IMFs in general are disfavoured with re-
spect to a Chabrier IMF mainly at high redshift z  06
In order to reduce this tension one can relax the assump-
tion of IMF universality and re-compute the eect on the
median fDMs as a function of z by assuming a Salpeter and
Chabrier IMFs in local and EDisCS samples respectively
this very crude assumption would cancel out the variation
of fDM with redshift as shown by the green line in Fig 5

Tortora et al 2013 Weidner et al 2013 Tortora et al
2014 We have evaluated also this eect by correcting
the DM fractions for all the samples using the same local
relation between IMF  Chabrier and e
Tortora et al 2013 In this case some fDM trend with
redshift is still observed see orange line in Fig 5 but the
number of high-z galaxies with negative DM mainly with
small e is still too large to accommodate these systems
without a variation of IMF across the cosmic time
The net conclusion of this analysis is that according to
the fDM variation with z the IMF which would be compati-
ble with physical fDM values can range from bottom-heavy
to bottom-light at lowz but it does not have the same
leverage at higherz eg z 06 where the IMF has to
be mainly bottom-light eg Chabrier-like and compatible
with a Salpeter IMF in very high-e systems only producing
negative DM fractions just in a tiny handful of systems
A detailed investigation of the IMF variation with e
as a function of z is beyond the scope of this paper There-
fore in the following we will discuss the results based on a
constant IMF across the lookback time
412 Systematics
We have seen that the IMF is a major source of uncertainty
in the fDM trend with z However there are other sources
of systematics that may provide alternative explanations for
the negative fDM values of the EDisCS sample within 1 Re
and eventually modify our trends with redshift Besides sys-
tematics in the stellar mass estimates the negative fDM val-
ues can be due to measurement errors on galaxy parameters
andor a failure of the mass model adopted for the Mdyn
eg Tortora et al 2012 A brief discussion of all possible
systematics is given here below
i We measure Res using I-band photometry which means
that Res are approximately rest-frame V and B bands

ples assuming a Chabrier IMF are as in Figs 2 and 4 Red and
blue symbols are for lower-z and higher-z EDisCS galaxies Solid
line connect these datapoints Dashed line connects the results
for a Salpeter IMF The gray region set the locus of unphysical
ie negative DM fractions Solid green line is for toy-model as-
suming a Chabrier Salpeter IMF at high low redshift Solid

from Tortora et al 2013
respectively at z  04 and z  08 Res are found
to be larger at smaller wavelengths Sparks  Jorgensen
1993 La Barbera  de Carvalho 2009 Roche et al 2010
Vulcani et al 2014 In particular using a sample of galaxies
with z  03 Vulcani et al 2014 estimate an increase from
g to u and from r to g band of  15 of and similar results
are found in La Barbera  de Carvalho 2009 following the
method in Sparks  Jorgensen 1993 For this reason our
Res which are measured in the rest-frame V-band at the
smallest EDisCS redshifts are conservative lower limits and
would be larger if calculated in the same rest-frame as the
highest redshift ETGs Thus stronger evolution of Re and
fDM with redshift is expected if this eect would be taken
properly into account We have shown the impact of wave-
band in Fig 4 for the SPIDER MtotM where the proles
are calculated at K-band Re which are smaller than our
reference values This reduces the dierence with EDisCS
galaxies with respect to the results from g-band light prole
and g-band Re not shown in the Figure for brevity which
would give MtotM larger than our reference estimates
ii In addition to uncertainties in stellar mass estimates
the choice of the mass prole that we have made ie
the SIS model can be inappropriate for low-e or M
galaxies and cause an excess of negative MtotM values
mainly at high-z eg Sonnenfeld et al 2013 In particular
MtotM and the slope of total mass density are tightly
correlated with shallower density proles corresponding
to larger MtotM Humphrey  Buote 2010 Remus et al
2013 Dutton  Treu 2014 To quantify the impact of a free
total mass density slope  we have adopted a power-law
mass density   r with slope steeper and shallower than
isothermal We use the two extreme values   25 and
15 which bracket most of the results in the literature We
nd that the average MtotM gets smaller larger of 012
fDM vs z
005 dex for   25  15 in a realistic case with a
varying slope with mass smaller changes  012 dex will
be found eg Dutton  Treu 2014 If  is constant with
time then these corrections have to be applied to both lo-
cal and EDisCS samples and our results are left naturally
unaected On the other hand if we assume for local ETGs
that the slope is varying with mass as it is eectively found
then the only way to totally remove any MtotM evolu-
tion is that EDisCS galaxies have total mass density slopes
very shallow   -15 and consequently larger MtotM
which is not expected since at high redshifts where gas
and in situ star formation dominate the galaxies the ETGs
from cosmological simulations have a total density slope very
steep   3 and mergings tend to drive the galaxy to
a nearly isothermal prole Remus et al 2013 Thus al-
though a varying slope with redshift has to be further inves-
tigated our tests showed that the conclusions of the present
paper are left nearly unchanged
iii If rotation velocities would be included in the analysis
Mdyn would get higher reducing the fraction of negative
iv As discussed in Sect 3 galaxies which are star form-
ing at the cosmic epoch of the EDisCS galaxies have to be
removed Thus progenitor bias has to be applied and we
plot the results in Fig 4 As for the trends of Re and e as a
function of M the MtotM results are only little aected
In particular the inclusion of the progenitor bias make
the MtotM larger smaller for SPIDER T09 samples
See Napolitano et al 2010 for further details about the
fDMage correlation see also Tortora et al 2010b We no-
tice that after the progenitor bias is applied the median
MtotM only slightly changes since the largest fraction of
galaxies the oldest is left unchanged
v We have checked the eect of the ellipticity in the mass
inferences and restricted the analysis to EDisCS objects with
axis-ratio q  06 60 of the full sample see yellow lines
in Fig 4 in order to limit to the roundest galaxies The
overall results are practically unchanged
vi The results are also almost unchanged if we only take
those objects with morphological type of pure ellipticals ie
T 6 4 Both tests on the ellipticity point v and mor-
phology above give support to the negligible impact of or-
dered motion on our Mdyn estimates
vii Finally we nd that MtotM in eld galaxies are
slightly smaller than those in cluster galaxies consis-
tently with the stronger evolution found in the literature
Saglia et al 2010 but due to the scatter in the sample
and uncertainties this dierence is not statistically relevant
pointing to a central DM content which is almost indepen-
dent on the environment the galaxy lives in accordingly to
similar analysis in local environments Tortora et al 2012
42 Passive evolution vs accretion by merging
We complement the analysis performed in the previous sec-
tion by discussing our results within the two dominant evolu-
tion scenarios ie passive evolution from monolithic collapse
and galaxy mergers from hierarchical model
Tortora C et al
421 Passive evolution
We start from discussing a pseudo-passive evolution assum-
ing no merging and compute the ageing of stellar popula-
tions in our sample The EDisCS galaxies as spectroscop-
ically selected passive objects have low residual SF and
can be fairly approximated by a single burst SSP or at
most a short-duration SF We consider stellar population
synthesis SPS models from Bruzual  Charlot 2003 and
adopt an exponential SF with timescale of   500 Myr
Tortora et al 2009 and dierent formation redshifts zf 
15 25 3 On average for passive evolution the EDisCS
stellar mass become smaller by 001  002 dex due to mass
loss This very mild evolution is not enough to produce the
local ReM relations and similarly the local DM correla-
tions Longer SF history with   1 Gyr would increase the
M increasing the discrepancies with the local observed lo-
cal samples
422 Hierarchical scenario
Alternatively galaxy mergers seem the natural mechanisms
that can account for both size and mass accretion Simula-
tions of dissipationless major mergers of elliptical galaxies
in Boylan-Kolchin et al 2005 have predicted the change in
central DM in the merger remnant They demonstrate that
the DM fraction within a certain physical radius decreases
a bit after the merger But the DM fraction within the nal
Re is greater than the DM fraction within the initial Re be-
cause MtotRe changes after the merger more than MRe
see also below for more quantitative details
The eect of merging on the central fDM has been in-
vestigated in details with N-body simulations by Hilz et al
2013 Here three ducial models with mass-ratio of 11
51 and 101 are analysed to nd that at dierent nal
stellar masses the equal-mass mergers produce a smaller
size increase of multiple minor mergers In particular the
variation of Re with respect to the initial radius ReR0
in terms of the variation of M with respect to the initial
stellar mass MM0 is found to be ReR0  MM0091
for the equal-mass merger and  MM024 for the mi-
nor mergers These latter predictions on the Re and M ac-
cretion have been found to be consistent with observations
van Dokkum et al 2010
Taking these results into account we have constructed
some toy-models assuming that MDM  Mvirr around
Re with   2 for a standard NFW and   12 for
a contracted NFW hereafter ACNFW according with
Boylan-Kolchin et al 2005 Consistently with Hilz et al
2013 we have also taken the average evolution of Re
in terms of M evolution for the equal-mass merging ie
ReR0  MM0091 and minor merging ie ReR0 
MM024 with the further assumption that the variation
of the virial mass almost follow the one of the stellar mass
ie Mvir  M This intrinsically reects the hypothesis
that the systems concurring to mergings all have some con-
stant MvirM which is reasonable for most of the stellar
mass range covered by our sample
These simplied models have the advantage of dealing
with a limited number of parameters but still providing a
quantitative assessment of the impact of the evolution sce-
nario on the observed DM fractions In particular we need to

nor mergings See text for details The predictions for Re and
MtotM are plotted in Fig 6 Major NFW blue lines and dots

clarify whether the observed DM fraction evolution is com-
patible with a variation with z of Re and MtotM or rather
it is the IMF variation with z the only viable explanation of
the observed correlations
In Fig 6 we show the predicted evolved tracks for the
the median Re and MtotM of the EDisCS dataset corre-
sponding to a median log MM  11 We have considered
the evolution tracks related to dierent merging types ac-
cording to the list in Table 3 The major merging tracks
are shown as blue lines with dotssquares indicating the
events corresponding to x  M0 x  0 1 2  n mass
increments while the minor merging tracks are shown by
yellow lines where dotssquares indicate the x  M0 with
x  0 05 1  n Dots and squares are for NFW and
ACNFW proles respectively
Comparing the model predictions with local results we
see that after a single major merger is not possible to re-
produce the local correlations blue lines in ReM and
MtotMM Adopting a NFW prole Major NFW af-
ter  3 major mergers the highz galaxy moves along the
track to overlap to the local observed MtotM while it
would need more merging events if a ACNFW is used
Major ACNFW open squares In both cases though the
toy-model predictions do not match the average local Re
M relations showing a deciency of size growth expected
for major merging events
On the contrary after a few minor mergers yellow lines
which accrete  05  15 of the initial M depending on
the DM prole adopted both ReM and MtotMM are
matched see Minor NFW and Minor ACNFW
To summarise the behaviour of our toy-models a the
impact of minor merging on Re and MtotM is stronger
than the one of major merging at xed accreted M and the
latter do not seem to account for the observed Re evolution
b uncontracted NFW models provide larger MtotM
For simplicity we have not analyzed here the case of a
Mvir which changes less more than M ie Mvir  M
Mvir  M For example if Mvir  M then Mdyn
and MtotM get larger
In Sect 41 we have shown that MtotM are slightly
smaller in eld than in cluster galaxies but this dierence
is not statistical signicant For galaxies living within dense
environments the chance to interact with neighboring galax-
ies is very high but for galaxies in the eld merging is a less
common event Thus the only ways to put EDisCS eld
galaxies and local objects within a coherent scenario are a
they will fall in the following 7 Gyrs within a cluster or a
group of galaxies and merge with other galaxies b they

5 CONCLUSIONS
We have
shown that
We have analyzed the central DM content in a sample of
high-z  04  08 ETGs from the EDisCS survey pa-
rameterized in this paper through the total-to-stellar mass
ratio MtotM calculated at r  1 Re and compared the
results with local galaxy samples SPIDER Tortora et al
2012 ATLAS3D Cappellari et al 2011 Tortora et al 2009
correlations between
MtotM and Re M and e are fairly independent of the
sample adopted and almost all conserved at highz see
Fig 4 In fact highz galaxies are more DM dominated at
larger Re and e ie they follow a positive correlation For
this sample this is a clear indication that the main driver
in the observed positive correlations is the eective radius
consistently with local galaxies as found in Napolitano et al
2010 see also Auger et al 2010 Tortora et al 2010b
Tortora et al 2012 A less signicant negative correlation
is found in terms of stellar mass in the opposite direction
to the correlations of the local galaxies
As seen in Figs 3 and 4 an overall oset of the MtotM
from high to lowz galaxies is evident suggesting an evo-
lution of the DM fraction within Re In particular we nd
that at xed Re the EDisCS sample presents MtotM of
 015  025 dex smaller than local galaxies The change in
MtotM is stronger at M and e xed being  03  035
dex and  05  06 dex respectively At xed M a clear
variation of the MtotM as a function of Re is found from
high to lowz galaxies Fig 3 but not in e Fig 1 The
overall evolution of the DM fraction with redshift see Fig
5 is consistent with the results found in Faure et al 2011
but in contrast with the opposite trend found by Ru et al
2011 within Re2 which nd larger DM fractions at
high-z and inconsistent with the absence of evolution in
Bezanson et al 2013 Our ndings are consistent with re-
sults in Beiori et al 2014 which using SDSS-IIIBOSS
and SDSS-II datasets nd smaller DM fractions in higher-z
galaxies but the trend with redshift is shallower than ours
Instead we do not agree with the absence of evolution found
in Belli et al 2014 for a sample of quiescent galaxies at
We nd that on average the inferred fDM from a
Salpeter IMF or bottom-heavier IMFs in general are dis-
favored with respect to a Chabrier IMF mainly at high red-
shift and in low-e systems Thus we can reproduce our
fDM assuming a ChabrierSalpeter IMF at highlow red-
Tortora C et al
shift which would point to an IMF evolution with redshift
This result seems to be in contrast with the recent ndings
in Shetty  Cappellari 2014 which nd a Salpeter IMF
in z  07  08 massive galaxies However their models
assume a constant-ML prole and no-DM content in the
central regions ie the mass is only in stars which might
have biased the overall stellar ML as their dynamical ML
and the inferred  are just upper limits Tortora et al
2013 Furthermore their sample is composed by very mas-
sive M 1011 M galaxies with very high- most of the
systems have   200 kms Taking all these specics of
their sample their results are substantially consistent with
ours since a Salpeter IMF is allowed by the EDisCS sys-
tems at similar velocity dispersions providing nearly null
DM fractions consistent with their assumption see bottom
panels in Fig 4
We have briey discussed the possibility that the IMF is
non-universal not only as a function of redshift but that it
can also vary with the masscentral velocity dispersion see
eg Tortora et al 2013 The impact on our results of a
more realistic IMF variation with e from local observations
Tortora et al 2013 has been analyzed and assumed to be
valid and the same at all redshifts This has been shown
to produce a smaller number of negative DM fraction with
respect to a Salpeter IMF However a combined evolution
with masse and redshift would completely solve the is-
sue of negative fDM Although most of stars are already in
place at z  1 a change of IMF across the time could be pro-
duced by two dierent processes a new stars formed in the
core during a wet merging process which also produce pos-
itive age gradients eg Hopkins et al 2008 Tortora et al
2010a and higher-mass IMF Napolitano et al 2010 in
young and massive local ETGs or b by stars from both
merging galaxies characterized by two dierent IMFs which
can combine to modify the cumulative IMF of the remnant
Unfortunately the net eect of these processes on the nal
IMF is not yet clear and in most cases the combination of
a higher- and a lower-mass IMF would produce a nal
diluted IMF Therefore it is also plausible to scan alterna-
tive mass modelling and mechanisms to explain the negative
fDM at highz and in low-e ETGs as i adopting realistic
and viable DM halo proles ii the eect of some dissipa-
tive processes that might alter the standard DM distribu-
tion like the adiabatic contraction Napolitano et al 2010
Tortora et al 2013 or iii some other DM avor eg some
warm DM Schneider et al 2012
However a detailed analysis of the IMF and DM
halo evolution across
the time is beyond the scopes
of this paper and will be addressed in future assum-
ing more complex mass modelling Tortora et al 2013
Tortora et al 2014 From the theoretic point of view this
evolution would pose a further open question which cir-
cumstances might have caused the IMF variation across
time at any given M This
is a new fundamen-
tal question which has to be added to the IMF evi-
dences of non-universality Conroy  van Dokkum 2012
Cappellari et al 2012 Spiniello et al 2012 Dutton et al
2013 Ferreras et al 2013 Goudfrooij  Kruijssen 2013
La Barbera et al 2013 Tortora et al 2013 Weidner et al
2013 Tortora et al 2014
We have nally investigated our results with a xed
IMF within galaxy formation scenarios and found that sim-
ple passive evolution is not able to reproduce local results
On the contrary the galaxy merging scenario allow to re-
produce the growth of the Re and the MtotM with z
We have used toy-models which take into account size and
mass accretion from minor- and major-mergings to show
that a single major merger is not able to reproduce local
correlations while many minor mergers work better eg
Hilz et al 2013 Belli et al 2014
Of course in order to have a rmer assessment on the
actual DM content evolution with redshift much larger sam-
ples are needed with full spectroscopic and photometric
information In particular gravitational
lensing can pro-
vide us very robust mass estimates eg Barnabe et al
2009 Covone et al 2009 Auger et al 2010 Tortora et al
2010b Barnabe et al 2011 Spiniello et al 2011 Thus sur-
vey projects like SLACS or COSMOS eg Faure et al 2008
or the ongoing ESO public surveys with VST telescope
such as KiDS together with spectroscopic surveys eg
BOSSSDSS Thomas et al 2013 Beiori et al 2014 and
GAMA Baldry et al 2010 are fundamental to collect a
large sample of galaxies that span a wide range of luminos-
ity and redshifts in order to probe more massive galaxies
in the universe and their evolutive history by means of the
description of the dierent history of stellar and DM and
their interplay in the inner and outer regions of galaxies
