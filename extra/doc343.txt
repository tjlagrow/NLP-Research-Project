Abstract
H I absorption has been detected with the WSRT against both lobes
of the radio galaxy Coma A This radio galaxy could be expanding in
a particularly gas rich environment perhaps the result from interac-
tionsmergers between the dominant giant galaxy associated with the
radio galaxy and less massive galaxies in the same group
Powerful radio galaxies are frequently associated with kpc-sized emission
line nebulosities extending up to tens of kpc from the nucleus These nebu-
losities can be either lit up by interactions between the radio jetlobe and the
environment or photoionized by anisotropic UV radiation from the active nu-
cleus Little is known in radio galaxies to what extent this ionized gas is related
to the overall ISM A key element for studies of these extended emission line
regions is to know the intrinsic distribution of the gas in and around the galaxy
ie to know the distribution of the neutral gas together with that of the ionized
gas Coma A is an ideal object for this study It is a well-known radio galaxy
z  00857 studied in detail by van Breugel et al 1985 The radio structure
is mainly formed by two lobes see Fig 1 and the total size is  65 kpc for
H  75 km s1 Mpc1 145 kpcarcsec A spectacular system of interlocking
emission line arcs and laments has been observed in H see Fig 1 using the
Taurus Tunable Filter on the WHT Tadhunter et al 2000 A striking match
between the ionized gas and the radio structures see Fig 1 makes the origin
of the ionized gas even more puzzling and strongly suggests the presence of a
complex interaction between the radio structure and the gas around Coma A
1 HI observations with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope
We have observed Coma A at the frequency of the redshifted H I line 1343 MHz
with the WSRT using 10 MHz bandwidth and a velocity resolution of  20 km
s1 At the resolution of our observations about 13 arcsec the radio structure
of Coma A appears just resolved in two structures corresponding to the northern
and southern lobes The preliminary results show that we have detected H I in
absorption against both radio lobes In both lobes the peak of the absorption is
at a very low optical depth  04  This low optical depth is likely to be due
R Morganti et al
at least in part to dilution The velocity of the absorption is about 200 km s1
redshifted for the northern lobe and between 100 and 150 km s1 blueshifted for
the southern lobe compared to the systemic velocity The FWHM is between
150 and 200 km s1 Assuming a spin temperature of 100 K this gives a column
density of 5  1019 atoms cm2 Velocities of the ionized gas derived from a slit
aligned with the radio axis show the same trend with position Thus the HI
appears kinematically associated with the ionized gas

11 Preliminary conclusions
One of the very few objects in which spatially extended 21-cm H I absorption
has been detected against the radio lobes is the central radio galaxy in the
cooling ow cluster Abell 2597 ODea et al 1994 This has been interpreted as
indication that the radio lobes are surrounded by a collection of clouds containing
both neutral and ionized gas The same could apply to Coma A with the main
dierence that the scale of the phenomena is larger several tens of kpc instead
of few kpc Indeed in the case of Coma A the complicated H structure has
been explained by a particularly gas rich environment surrounding the galaxy
and that the close morphological association is due to the radio lobes expanding
into this gas-rich environment Tadhunter et al 2000 The detected H I would
just be part of this system
Coma A could be the result of interactionsmergers between the dominant
giant galaxy and less massive galaxies in the same group Although we cannot
yet say how spatially extended the observed absorption is it is quite likely that
Coma A indeed possesses extended H I structures
