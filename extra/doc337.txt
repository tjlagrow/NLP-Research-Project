ABSTRACT
In this second paper of a series of papers based on the FIRST and SDSS
surveys we investigate the evolution of galaxy morphology and nuclear activity
in the look-back time of the SDSS  2 Gyrs for a sample of 150000 galaxies
in the local universe We demonstrate an evolution in the strength of the radio
power and the spectroscopic emission-lines typical of AGN as well as in the mor-
phology of their hosts Such evolution appears more substantial for less luminous
systems and is possibly the low-redshift tail of the downsizing in star-formation
AGN activity and supermassive black hole build-up observed in higher redshift
surveysThis suggests that the dierences in intrinsic properties of galaxies along
the Hubble Sequence may arise from the dierence in the depth of their potential
wells which leads to dierent evolutionary paths because of dierent timescales
for gas infall This primordial infall and the following secular evolution mediated
by bar and density wave instabilities may bring galaxies of dierent mass to have
the dierent activity levels and morphological features in the local universe shown
in this study In agreement with such a hypothesis we nd that star-formation
as traced by radio emission is progressively more centrally concentrated in more
evolved star-forming galaxies and we show that the environment in which a galaxy
resides plays a lesser role in shaping the features and activity for the majority of
systems

Introduction
Understanding the activity of galaxies their morphologies and the interplay between
the two are key problems in galaxy evolution and are tightly correlated with the problem of
 2 
understanding whether such properties depend on the initial physical conditions of a galaxy
eg its mass or rather result from evolutionary processes driven by the environment in
which they live such as mergers gravitational and gas-gas interactions
Models of galaxy formation and evolution have tried to explain the dierences in the
features of galaxies for decades mostly unsuccessfully Hierarchical cold dark matter models
which have been shown to describe successfully large-scale structure formation currently fail
to describe properly many salient properties of galaxies such as the color-magnitude relation
the bimodal distribution in colors the luminosity function and downsizing ie the earlier
quenching of star formation in more massive objects Furthermore such models inadequately
describe the formation of small bulge-less spirals the most common galaxies in the universe
It is unclear if the problems that these models encounter are given by a simplistic treatment
of the complex baryonic physics governing the observable parameters or if the models are
not appropriate for the description of galaxy formation and evolution
Explaining the mechanisms which initiate and regulate star-formation and AGN activity
in galaxies along the Hubble diagram has proven as challenging Galaxies show very dierent
rates and histories of star-formation activity and host AGN with very dierent characteristics
narrow andor broad emission lines point-like radio emission and large radio jets to name
a few making the modeling of such activity quite complex
The interplay between star-formation and AGN activity is also poorly understood Using
the SDSS Kaumann et al 2003 showed that active galactic nuclei selected on the basis
of their emission lines preferentially reside in massive bulge-dominated systems with traces
of recent star-formation possibly a consequence of the presence of a reservoir of cold gas
which triggers both star-formation and AGN activity Using the GOODS Survey however
Nandra et al 2007 showed that X-ray AGN activity persists in many z  1 red-sequence
galaxies well after the star-formation has quenched suggesting that the presence of a cold
reservoir of gas may not be a necessary ingredient in the triggering of AGN activity
The role of the environment surrounding a galaxy in initiating activity is also quite
controversial Interactions and mergers among galaxies are known to trigger bursts of star
formation in galaxies eg Barton Geller  Kenyon 2000 yet the trigger for the onset
of star-formation on galactic scales in isolated spiral galaxies calls for a dierent explana-
tion In clusters Christlein  Zabludo 2005 have shown that the environment produces
a signicant eect in the later evolution of galaxies lowering their star-formation rates sub-
stantially while Hogg et al 2006 using the SDSS sample conclude the opposite ie that
the cluster environment may be irrelevant to the bulk of the transformation of galaxies
Mergers and close interaction between galaxies have also been suggested as possible triggers
of AGN activity Dahari 1984 however Grogin et al 2005 using the GOODS survey and
 3 
two Chandra Deep Fields have shown that there is no close connection between galaxy merg-
ers and moderate-luminosity AGN activity out to appreciable look-back times approaching
the epoch of peak AGN activity in the universe z  13 This result is supported by the
study of Pierce et al 2007 who showed that X-ray-selected AGN tend to reside in undis-
turbed pairs of early type galaxies with no direct evidence of gravitational perturbation
or interactions suggesting that the activation mechanism of AGN is not primarily galaxy
interaction
The role of secular evolution in triggering star-formation and AGN activity as well as
the morphological transformation of galaxies by means of a re-arrangement of energy and
mass through collective phenomena such as bars Combes 2000 andor spiral waves Zhang
1996 Sellwood  Binney 2002 is unclear but there is increasing observational evidence of
its importance in shaping galaxy features Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004
Interestingly many properties observed in the local universe are observed also in the
high- redshift population of galaxies investigated by recent deep galaxy surveys Using the
GOODS survey Grogin et al 2005 have shown that the well-known correlation between
size of a galactic bulge and the mass of the supermassive black hole residing at its center
Ferrarese  Merritt 2000 is in place at early epochs z13 Cassata et al 2007 using
the COSMOS Survey have studied the morphological content and environmental dependence
of the galaxy color-magnitude relation at z  07 and found that the red and blue sequences
of galaxies found in the nearby universe are found at z  07 as well By comparing the
high- and low-redshift populations they conclude that the local red sequence is adequately
reproduced by passive evolution suggesting that a fraction of the galaxies in the high-
redshift blue sequence eventually evolve into red-sequence galaxies They also conrm the
result of Balogh et al 2004 who showed that the slope and the normalization of such color-
magnitude relations are substantially invariant with respect to local density when galaxies
are separated into early and late types arguing that secular star-formation is driven more
by galaxy mass than by environment The color-density correlation found by other authors
eg Cooper et al 2008 at high redshift with bluer galaxies found in regions of greater over-
density is interpreted as an excess of more late-type galaxies in denser environments which
evolve into red-sequence galaxies at the present time These studies are in agreement with
older results Butcher  Oemler 1978 which showed a variation in the fractional abundance
of dierent morphological types in galaxy cluster populations as a function of redshift The
study of Cassata et al 2007 is not limited to clusters suggesting that a transformation of
galaxies might also occur in the absence of mechanisms such as the gas-gas and gravitational
interactions typical of dense cluster environments These results are at odds with the work
of Park et al 2007 who have used the SDSS sample to show that close interaction among
galaxies is the most likely mechanism leading to the density-morphology correlation observed

In a series of three papers based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey York et al 2000 and
the FIRST Survey Becker White  Helfand 1995 we examine the population of broad and
narrow emission-line active galactic nuclei AGN in the local universe in order to explore
the physical and environmental properties of galaxies
In Paper I Reviglio  Helfand 2009 we described the multiwavelength database built
for this analysis and the systematics aecting the spectroscopic selection of AGN We pre-
sented evidence of the existence of a large population of radio-emitting radio AGN which
lack optical spectroscopic signatures and show that at all luminosities galaxies with redder
colors are more likely to show weaker emission lines In this second paper we further explore
the interplay between galaxy properties and AGN features focusing on the interplay between
morphology star-formation and nuclear activity including its evolution over cosmic times
In a following paper we will present a comparative analysis of the radio and spectroscopic
properties of narrow- and broad-lined AGN and their evolution
The structure of the paper is the following
in section 2 we present the sample used
for this analysis while in 3 we show our evidence of co-evolution of galaxy activity and
morphology and in 4 we map the aging of the radio power associated with AGN In 5
we illustrate the aging of the spectroscopic features of AGN in 6 we study the correlation
between environment activity and morphology We discuss our results in 7 and present our
conclusions in 8
2 The sample
In this paper we further analyze a sample of 151815 galaxies with Petrosian R mag-
nitude in the range 145R175 drawn from the SDSS Second Data Release for which
we have constructed a multiwavelength database gathering information about their radio
emission from the FIRST and NVSS surveys the far-infrared emission from IRAS and x-ray
emission from the ROSAT surveys Details on the database construction are given in Paper
I The density of the environment surrounding each galaxy has been calculated using the
tridimensional density estimator discussed in Paper I further description of this method can
be found in Carter et al 2001
The spectroscopic classication of galaxies is adopted from Kaumann et al 2003 and
Brinchmann et al 2004 along with the extinction-corrected uxes for the main spectro-
scopic lines their equivalent widths and the extinction-corrected estimates of the stellar
masses of the galaxies in the sample As discussed in Paper I we have modied the clas-
sications to correct for eects of dilution and host light pollution which tend to bias the
 5 
classications with increasing redshifts
About 6 of the sample shows detectable radio emission in either FIRST or NVSS For
these radio-emitting galaxies the spectroscopic classication has been complemented with
an independent classication based on the radio and optical morphology of the sources as
discussed in Paper I and in Reviglio 2008
3 Evolution of AGN activity and host properties
The look-back time of the SDSS is about 2 Gyrs in standard cosmological models m 
03 and   07 The typical timescales for the processes associated with AGN activity
and star-formation are much shorter typically a few tens of millions of years Therefore we
wish to investigate whether evolution of activity and morphology can be detected over the
look-back time of the SDSS
In order to compare the properties of galaxies at dierent redshifts it is crucial to
minimize selection eects given by the survey systematics In Paper I we showed how dilution
signicantly biases the selection of active galaxies with increasing redshift and devised a
method to correct for this bias This correction is essential since dilution is a redshift-
dependent systematic and if not properly corrected could mimic evolution of the sample
with redshift cf Paper I for a more detailed discussion
In order to explore the properties of AGN and host galaxies over the look-back time of
the SDSS we have focused on volume-limited samples of galaxies which ensure completeness
of the optical sample within the redshift and absolute magnitude cuts applied We have
constructed a chain of eight volume-limited samples covering the absolute magnitude range
235  R  195 at intervals of 05 in magnitude This ensures that we are looking at
optically complete samples of AGN hosts with similar properties In gure 1 we show the
scatter plot in redshift and absolute magnitude of galaxies belonging to each volume-limited
sample
For the AGN-classied galaxies we show in Figure 2 the scatter plot of H luminosity
versus the luminosity distance and we note how the H luminosity decreases over time The
eects of dilution have been corrected for no lower cut appears in the plots but even if they
had not this would not account for the lack of strong emission-line AGN at lower redshifts
Dierences in the volumes sampled at various redshifts however might explain the
lack of high-luminosity systems at lower redshifts A better way to explore this trend is to
consider for each volume-limited sample the ratio of galaxies with H luminosity above the
 6 
median of the sample to those with a luminosity below the median This method allows us
to eliminate the possibility that the trends observed in the scatter plots simply result from
the fact that at higher redshifts larger volumes are sampled and therefore a larger number of
high luminosity systems is to be expected with our procedure the volume eect is removed
In Figure 3 we show that the strength of the H line has indeed decreased over time In the
next section we will demonstrate that this decrease is accompanied by a decrease in the radio
luminosity of these active nuclei As noted earlier this is part of a more general evolution
of AGN strength in radio and X-rays observed from the high- to the low-redshift universe
Longair 1966 Cowie et al 2003
The trends observed are unlikely the result of the inclusion in the ber with increasing
redshift of more H emission from star-forming regions residing in the outer part of the
in order to explain the increase in H luminosity observed in each volume-limited
sample these star-forming regions would need to account for as much as three times the H
emission observed in the nuclear region at lower redshifts This would severely aect the
spectral classication of these objects making them fall in composite or SFG class
Because of the requirement that each sample is volume-limited the look-back time
is shorter for less luminous systems
In order to compare the various samples we have
extrapolated the evolution in the look-back time considered to the same time interval t 
1Gyr In Figure 4 we show the trend for the parameter EH  logLz4Lz1Tz4Tz1 where
z4 and z1 refer to the fourth highest redshift and rst lowest redshift bin in each sub-
sample and T is the associated cosmic time in a standard m  03   07 cosmological
model This quanties the order of magnitude by which the luminosity would increase over
a 1 Gyr time interval assuming a rst-order interpolation of the trends shown in Fig2Note
that the bins for the lowest luminosity galaxies are both sparsely populated and extend only
over a modest range of redshift so the large changes seen may well be exaggerated over most
of the luminosity range the results suggest a factor of 2-3 decrease in H luminosity over the
past gigayear The evolution of the AGN H power in less luminous galaxies is stronger than
the evolution of this quantity in higher luminosity systems This nding is in agreement with
the evidence of downsizing in AGN activity with AGN activity peaking at earlier epochs in
more massive systems Cowie et al 2003 Kriek et al 2007 According to our results the
most massive galaxies have decreased their H by circa two orders of magnitude in the past
10 Gyr which means that at early times they had luminosities typical of strong AGN and
quasars a fact that we will further discuss in Paper III We note however that if black holes
in less massive systems have been growing signicantly only in recent epochs as suggested
by downsizing low-mass systems have not been steadily decreasing their luminosity over
the past  10 Gyr like the most massive ones which would make these low-mass systems
surprisingly bright at very high redshifts but only in a much more recent past
 7 
Interestingly this change in strength is accompanied by an increase in the concentra-
tion of the light as shown in gure 5 and an increase in Dn4000 parameter describing the
average time since the last burst of star formation gure 6 This suggests a co-evolution
of star-formation AGN and the morphological properties of galaxies over cosmic time The
transformation of the light concentration is stronger in less luminous systems this is shown
in gure 7 where we plot the trend for the parameter Ec  Cz4  Cz1Tz4  Tz1 which
quanties the factor by which the concentration parameter C increases over 1 Gyr assuming
a rst-order linear interpolation We note that the C parameter spans a range in values be-
tween 06 for disks and 02 for ellipticals  a change of  004 in such parameter is therefore
a  10 eect
This suggests that bulges in less massive systems are forming at recent epochs in agree-
ment with the ndings of Cimatti et al 2006
We further inspected the variation in the light-concentration for the other spectroscopic
types since star-forming and composite systems are associated with lower luminosity sys-
tems we have selected dierent intervals in magnitude -220R-180 While for composite
systems we do observe a change in the number of systems with concentration above the me-
dian of each sample in their respective look-back times g8 the same is not observed in
SFG galaxies Fig 9 This is in agreement with the fact that AGN activity is strongly cor-
related with an enhancement in the concentration of galaxy light typical of the presence of
a bulge and suggests that the diskSFG phase is a relatively stable phase for galaxies while
the AGNbulge phase is not ie the transition from a disk to a bulge-dominated system
must be rapid From this point of view the existence of the red and blue sequences and a
clean cut in morphology for galaxies at U-R 222 Strateva et al 2001 can be interpreted
as a consequence of the rapid evolution of systems of intermediate size from star-forming
disks to early-type systems in agreement with the suggestions Balogh et al 2004
4 Evolution of AGN radio emission
In Paper I we have shown that  5 of emission-line AGN at z  02 show radio emission
detectable by FIRST andor NVSS surveys The undetected emission line population has
a mean radio ux density detectable by stacking FIRST images that is only an order of
magnitude below the detection threshold Furthermore we have shown that there exists a
spectroscopically unremarkable population of AGN detected in FIRST which accounts for
4 of the early-type population
Since radio emission and optical emission lines are independent features of an active
 8 
nucleus with one not necessarily requiring the other Zirbel  Baum 1995 Best et al 2005
Reviglio  Helfand 2006 we have explored the evolution of AGN activity in the SDSS look-
back time for AGN radio emission in order to see if the tail of the well-known decrease in
radio luminosity over cosmic time eg Longair 1966 can be detected in the look-back time
of the SDSS
Using the technique described in the previous sections we have selected a chain of
volume-limited samples and we have plotted radio luminosity in each redshift range selected
Since NVSS and FIRST are both ux-limited surveys selecting a volume-limited sample
in the optical does not remove selection eects in the radio band brighter radio sources
are expected to be selected at higher redshifts in all volume-limited samples In order to
avoid this eect produced by the incompleteness of the radio sample at higher redshifts we
have used the aforementioned stacking procedure White et al 2007 to evaluate the median
luminosity of radio AGN in bins of redshift for each volume-limited sample The procedure
eectively removes the selection given by the ux-limited nature of the radio surveys since
all elds including those with source ux densities below the survey ux-limit are used for
obtaining the median luminosity
For each volume-limited sample we have thus considered four bins in redshift and plot the
radio luminosity obtained by stacking all elds containing emission-line AGN The median
luminosity was obtained by stacking in luminosity space and then tting a two-dimensional
gaussian prole to the median image obtained see Paper I for details
The results are shown in gure 10 We nd that the average radio luminosity of emission-
line systems has decreased over time in nearly all volume-limited samples The average K-
correction is of order 10 too small to account for the decrease in radio luminosity found
in the data The stacked radio sources were unresolved or marginally resolved the radio
luminosity is therefore equivalent to the peak radio emission coming from the central radio
AGN The fact that the FIRST survey resolves out part of the ux of extended sources
therefore does not aect our analysis We note a relationship between the strength of the
radio emission and the optical luminosity of its host galaxies with lower optical luminosities
harbor less intense radio AGN a fact we will investigate further in Paper III
The decrease in radio power is more pronounced in galaxies of lower luminosity as we
found for the H emission as shown in gure 10 no evolution is seen in either the -235R-
230 bin or the -200R-195 a lack of evolution in the concentration parameter was also
noted for the highest luminosity bin g 5 In the -200R-195 bin the look-back-time
may be too short for observing an actual change
If we consider spectroscopically passive galaxies which show no signicant signs of AGN
 9 
activity in their spectra we nd a less marked decrease in the median power of their AGN
from higher to lower redshift This is shown in Figure 11 For absolute magnitudes fainter
than -215 no ux is detected in our stacks  10 Jy showing that low-luminosity hosts
lacking emission lines harbor fainter or non-existent radio AGN In current radio AGN
production models the radio power is connected with accretion rate Meier 2001 If these
systems have used up most of their gaseous reservoir at earlier times as suggested by the
lack of emission lines it is likely that their accretion rates are lower and their radio emission
weaker We will investigate this fully in Paper III
In summary it appears that more evolved more luminous galaxies show less sign of
evolution in radio emission over the past 1 Gyr consistent with the trends found for the
emission lines and the morphology of the host
5 Evolution of AGN spectroscopic activity
In Paper I we showed that systems with unremarkable lines are often weak AGN with
weak emission lines that are misclassied as passive galaxies because of nuclear light dilution
by the host galaxy stellar light We have shown that this population is on average redder
than the population with detected lines and suggested that there is a physical dierence
between the two populations
In Figure 12 we show that this is part of a more general trend of line diminution in
redder systems If we select all systems at z02 with the four standard BTP lines detected
requiring that their EW is 10 and divide these systems between Seyfert II galaxies and
Liners using the usual cut OIIIH 3 we nd that the Seyfert II population is on average
bluer than the Liner population If we consider the class of AGN with H and NII detected
EW 1 but OIII and H marginally detected or undetected EW1 which we will refer
to as LES low excitation systems we nd that this class is redder than the Liners If we
then consider the class with all four BTP lines marginally detected or not detected at all
EW of all four lines 1 which we reclassied as AGN according to the criteria discussed
in Paper I this class is redder than the LES class Finally if we consider the sub-sample
of truly spectroscopically passive galaxies with all lines not detected but showing X-ray
or radio AGN we nd that these galaxies are redder than all other classes This strongly
suggests that the line strength in active galaxies is strongly linked with the galaxy color
The colors adopted have been corrected for dust reddening by means of the estimate
of the extinction coecient Az obtained by Kaumann et al 2003 Estimate of the ex-
tinction in the U and R bands from the Az coecient have been obtained by means of the
 10 
extinction law calculated by Rieke  Lebofsky 1985 where the AzAv value needed for
the conversion has been obtained by interpolating the values for the I and J band since the
average wavelength of the Z band is 8931 Angstrom in between the values for the standard
J and the I bands The trends found are therefore not an eect of dust extinction ie they
are not given by a correlation between the nuclear extinction and the global extinction in
the galaxy that would imply that more dusty galaxies also have more dusty nuclei
In Figure 13 we show that the same trends are found when hosts with similar luminosities
and therefore with similar supermassive black hole mass are chosen by restricting the
sample to volume-limited sub-samples spanning intervals of only 05 in absolute R magnitude
This suggests that the mass of the supermassive black hole is unlikely to be the parameter
that drives the dierence in the prominence of the lines As we will fully explore in Paper III
the accretion rate onto the supermassive black hole could be the parameter that regulates
the prominence of the lines It is reasonable to expect that as systems become more and
more gas depleted and therefore redder as a consequence of their decrease in star-formation
rate their accretion rates drop Lower accretion rates would power less luminous nuclear
emission leading to less prominent recombination lines
If galaxies progressively use up their gaseous reservoir then more gas-depleted galaxies
should have quenched their star formation at earlier times In this case the prominence of
their lines in spectra should be correlated not only with the color of the galaxy but also with
the Dn4000 Bruzual A 1983and the HA Worthey  Ottaviani 1997 parameters which
are indicators of the age of their stellar population1
In Figure 14 and 15 we show the median values of the Dn4000 and HA parameters for the
ve dierent classes of objects discussed above It is clear that weaker lines are associated
with galaxies with older stellar populations since the trend for Dn4000 is decreasing and
the trend for H is increasing
If we split our sample into four classes of luminosity as
before we nd that such trends persist for all types of galaxies conrming that at all galaxy
luminosities lines become weaker as the star-formation is quenched and the galaxy stellar
population becomes redder Fig 16 and 17
If we consider the evolution of the Dn4000 parameter after a burst of star-formation as
1 Dn4000 quanties the break in galaxy spectra occurring at 4000 A a feature which arises because of the
accumulation of a large number of absorption lines in a narrow wavelength range These absorption lines arise
in stellar atmospheres Young stars having highly ionized atmospheres are ineective at absorbing photons
so galaxies with young stellar population have weaker Dn4000 breaks HA on the contrary quanties the
strength of the HA absorption line which is typical of A stars HA therefore peaks in galaxies in which the
light is dominated by such a population and then decreases as the A-star population fades and the galaxy
becomes redder
 11 
shown in Kaumann et al 2003 we show their plot in Fig 18 we nd that a variation from
16 to 19 in the D4000 parameter corresponds approximately to an interval of 4109 years
At each luminosity the ABG galaxies had their last burst of star formation  4  109 years
earlier than the Seyfert population If we consider Seyferts and Liners we have a variation
of Dn4000 of  005 which corresponds to  4  108 yrs This implies that on timescales of
4  108 yrs a signicant variation of the nuclear spectrum can be observed
The look back time for the SDSS survey is  2  109 Therefore if this line of reasoning
is correct a decline in the strength of lines for a xed host should be observable as shown
in section 3
6 Environmental dependency of activity
Dierences in star-formation and AGN activity in galaxies may depend on their intrinsic
properties such as the depth of their potential well or their richness in gas or by the eects
of the environment in which they reside Denser environment favor close encounters among
galaxies which are known to disturb the distribution of their interstellar medium trigger-
ing star-formation activity and possibly AGN activity We have therefore explored further
the dependence of activity and morphology on environment and galaxy massluminosity to
clarify this issue
We have associated all galaxies with a density calculated by sampling the volume dened
by the tenth nearest neighbor to a galaxy and statistically correcting for unseen galaxies
as described in Carter et al 2001 and in Paper I This provides us with an estimate of
the environmental density on a few megaparsec scale eectively dividing the sample into
the dierent regions of large-scale structure voids laments and clusters The estimator
chosen is not sensitive to substructure on smaller scales and therefore does not see cluster
cores or tight pairs the study of which is beyond the scope of this paper
In gure 19 we show that the well-known density-morphology relation originally ob-
served in clusters by Dressler 1980 is observed also in the lower density regime of laments
and voids with an increase in late type systems with decreasing large-scale environmental
density This trend is observed both both if we divide early- and late-types according to
color following Strateva et al 2001 or on the basis of the likelihood of an exponential or
de-Vaucouleurs t to their light proles
This change in the typical morphology of galaxies with increasing density is accompanied
by a change in activity as well In Figure 20 we show the fractional abundance as a function
of density for the four main spectroscopic types after correction for dilution as discussed
 12 
in Paper I star-forming galaxies SFG AGN composite galaxies star-forming plus AGN
and passive galaxies showing only absorption lines in their spectra ABG It is evident how
galaxies with dierent types of activity inhabit dierent environments star-forming galaxies
preferentially reside in low-density environments galaxies showing both star-formation and
AGN activity signatures in environments of intermediate density galaxies with spectroscopic
AGN activity in dense environments and nally galaxies lacking emission lines in very dense
environments As discussed in Paper I 4 of these passive galaxies do harbor radio AGN
at the sensitivity threshold of FIRST and NVSS and the majority of such galaxies host
radio AGN typically one order of magnitude fainter The ABG class therefore should be
considered as passive only spectroscopically
We note that the smooth transformation of activity with environment from star-formation-
dominated to AGN-dominated and eventually into galaxies lacking signs of nuclear recom-
bination lines is not only accompanied by a change in the relative abundance of early- to
late-type galaxies in denser environments as described by the usual density-morphology re-
lation but also by a smooth transition in the morphology of galaxies with an increasing
prominence of the bulge relative to the disk
In order to quantify this variation we have
considered two dierent indicators The rst takes advantage of the fact that the light pro-
le of disk galaxies is well-described by an exponential law while the light prole of bulges
is well-described by a de-Vaucouleurs law As a consequence for each galaxy the param-
eter p dened as the arcotangent of the ratio of the exponential t likelihood Lexp to the
de-Vaucouleurs t likelihood LdeV  p  atanLexpLdev is a measure of the probability that
the system is disk or bulge dominated Values of p close to 2 describe galaxies with a very
high probability of being bulge-dominated while values of p close to zero describe galaxies
with a very high probability of being disk-dominated Values in between represent systems
with intermediate features or irregular galaxies The smooth variation from disk-dominated
systems to bulge-dominated systems with environment is shown in gure 21
A transformation from disk- to bulge-dominated systems along the Hubble sequence
can also be traced using a dierent estimator  the concentration parameter C given by
the ratio of the radius containing 50 of the galaxy light to the radius containing 90 of
the light Moving from low to high values of C signies a change in the concentration of
the light which describes a change in morphology from bulge-dominated to disk-dominated
systems since the parameter is inversely proportional to the concentration of the light The
smooth variation of the value of C with environment is shown in gure 22 This shows
that the correlation of density with morphology is not simply given by a dierent fraction
of ellipticals to spirals in dierent environments but that the bulginess of systems varies
smoothly across environments This change accompanies the variation in the type of activity
with environment noted above
 13 
Since the average mass and luminosity of galaxies increases with increasing environmen-
tal density and the prominence of bulges increases with increasing luminositymass as shown
in Figure 23 the trends observed may result from either environmental eects Park et al
2007 or the dierent evolution of galaxies of dierent mass Balogh et al 2004
In order to explore further this degeneracy we compared the actual eect of environment
on the morphology of galaxies selecting three environments low density 20  log 
10 medium density 10  log  00 and high density log  00 and evaluating the
average bulginess of systems with dierent luminosities in each environment If the environ-
ment plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of galaxies we would expect a signicant
dierence in the trends across dierent environments all galaxies in denser environments
must have undergone more interactions than galaxies in low density environments and at
all luminosities they should be signicantly more evolved towards earlier types The results
are shown in Figure 24 We nd that a similar correlation between luminosity and bulge
prominence is in place in high- medium- and low- density environments higher luminosity
systems show increased bulginess and the trends are quite smooth This is in agreement
with the claim by Hogg et al 2004 that the color-magnitude relation for galaxies does not
depend signicantly on the environment and suggests that whatever mechanism transforms
galaxies into bulgier systems must be eective in all types of environments from low to high
density From this point of view the environment seems to play a lesser role in shaping
the morphology of galaxies the magnitude of its eect can be evaluated by comparing the
osets in the trends of Figure 24 as shown in the lower right corner of Figure 24 This oset
accounts for just a few percent variation the bulk of the correlation must be produced by a
mechanism that works equally well in all environments
We have conducted a similar analysis on star-forming galaxies and AGN hosts in order
to evaluate whether or not the dependence of activity on density is primarily an eect of
the density-morphology correlation In Figure 25 we show that the fraction of AGN among
early-type galaxies in dierent environments is remarkably at suggesting that there is no
signicant variation in the counts of passive and active ellipticals across dierent environ-
ments The fraction of star-forming galaxies among late-type galaxies is also constant across
densities ranging over three orders of magnitude The fact that this fraction is  10 reects
the fact that disk galaxies are mostly 96 forming stars and are not in a composite AGN
plus star-formation or AGN stage Note that bins where the ratio is  10 are the conse-
quence of the existence of star-forming early-type galaxies since we are normalizing by the
number of late-type galaxies the ratio can be greater than 10 The results do not change
signicantly if we divide the sample into early and late types by requiring the early-type
galaxies to have the likelihood of a de-Vaucouleurs prole higher than the likelihood of a
disk prole This suggests that on the scales sampled in this study the correlation of activity
 14 
with density is a by-product of the density-morphology correlation or vice versa
This can be further seen by considering the intensity of the two types of activity We
selected the same type of galaxy in dierent environments and compared the average intensity
of the associated activity Star-formation is typically found in galaxies with lower absolute R
magnitude than the mean absolute R magnitude we therefore selected two dierent volume-
limited samples at dierent absolute R magnitudes to maximize the size of the samples We
choose 21  R  20 for star-forming galaxies and 225  R  215 for AGN dening
these as high-luminosity host samples We compared these with a low-luminosity sample
of host for each class 195  R  185 for SFG and 205  R  195 for AGN
In Figure 26 we show the trend for the median equivalent width of H EWH with
varying density in these dierent samples spectroscopically classied as AGN or SFG No
signicant variation of the EWH is found with density For AGN this suggests that the
relative intensity of their emission is not determined by the frequency of their interactions
with other galaxies in agreement with the results of Nandra et al 2007 For SFG the
EWH measures the ratio of the current to past star-formation activity Since galaxies in
denser environments should have undergone more interactions over time the invariance of
EWH with density suggests that the environment plays a relatively small role in shaping
their star-formation history in agreement with other studies Carter et al 2001 Lewis et
al 2002 Hogg et al 2006
Obviously one might argue that the transformation in morphology and activity may be
triggered on much smaller scales by close interactions However to recover the correlation
of morphology and activity with the large-scale environmental density sampled in this study
requires that over time galaxies in denser environments must have undergone more close
interactions than their counterparts in low-density environments or that more galaxies are
tidally interacting in denser environments If galaxies in denser environments have undergone
more close interactions than their counterparts in low-density environments there should
be a signicant dierence in the luminosity-concentration properties of the populations in
dierent large-scale environments because the large and the small scale would be coupled
We do not nd such a dierence To assume that more galaxies in denser environments
are in close pairtidally interacting systems than in low-density environments may explain
the increase in the fraction of early- to late-type with increasing large-scale density and the
invariance of the luminosity-concentration relation with density but it seems unlikely to
account for the smooth variation of the bulge-to-disk ratio observed in g 21 We note
however that in this study we do not divide the extreme environment of the core of clusters
from the bulk of the sample Whether gas-gas interactions and harassment play a major role
in shaping the properties of galaxies in such rare environments cannot be assessed by this

7 Discussion
Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the variety of galaxy properties ei-
ther by postulating a primordial dierence in early- and late-type galaxies or by assuming
an evolution of late-type galaxies into early types via mergers interaction andor secular
evolution At the moment no consensus has been reached on which of these scenarios is
preferable Certainly all must play a role in shaping the morphology of galaxies and it cannot
be excluded a priori that they are equally important in creating the trends observed
Each of these mechanisms however produces a dierent re-arrangement of gas and
angular momentum in galaxies with its own characteristic time scale and induced burst of
star formation and potentially AGN activity It is therefore likely that understanding the
morphological transformation of galaxies is strongly correlated with understanding a galaxys
star-formation history and the evolution of its AGN activity
Coherent information about galaxy morphology star-formation AGN activity and su-
permassive black hole assembly would allow us to place important constraints on the dierent
mechanisms at play and possibly allow us to identify what produces the salient dierences in
morphology AGN activity and star-formation history along the Hubble sequence The fact
that star-formation activity AGN activity and the growth of bulges and SMBHs Cowie et al
1996 2003 Merloni et al 2004 proceed from bigger to smaller systems suggests that galax-
ies do form a continuum with more massive galaxies formed at earlier times and evolving
faster than low-mass ones In agreement with this idea the smooth scaling relations between
morphology star-formation and AGN activity found in our data seem to conrm a smooth
transition in the properties of galaxies with increasing mass or luminosity
In this study we have investigated the transformation of similar types of galaxies in
the look back time of the SDSS in order to better understand the mechanisms behind the
evolution of galaxies
The evolution over the past Gyr both in morphology and spectroscopic and radio activ-
ity appears more signicant for less luminous systems in agreement with downsizing in the
mass assembly and activity observed at higher redshifts Cimatti et al 2006 Cowie et al
2003 1996The observed evolution is therefore likely the tail of the evolution of galaxies
and their nuclei observed at higher redshifts Consistent with this notion we have found
that the smooth transition of spectral properties in AGN is accompanied by a dierent his-
tory of star-formation as the nuclear emission lines become less and less prominent the
last star-formation event dates to earlier times This strongly supports a co-evolution of
star-formation and AGN activity Furthermore we have shown that mid- and low-luminosity
hosts of AGN show evidence for a re-arrangement of the stellar component with the bulge-
 16 
to-disk ratio increasing within the look-back time of the SDSS while star-forming systems
do not show signatures of signicant structural evolution suggesting that the disk phase as
the elliptical phase is stable while the bulgy phase is not and leads to a progressive growth
of the bulge If this phase is short compared to the red early-type and blue late type
phases as our study indicates a shortage of systems with intermediate colors is to be ex-
pected as suggested by Balogh et al 2004 From this point of view the red sequenceblue
sequence dichotomy found in the local population of galaxies Strateva et al 2001 can be
interpreted as a simple by-product of the dierent evolutionary timescales for systems of
dierent massluminosity
The data presented in this study show that galaxies of dierent sizes have evolved
dierently over the past 2 Gyrs For these changes to be environmentally driven requires
that the eect of the environment should be proportionally weaker on smaller galaxies This
seems unlikely especially considering the fact that bigger galaxies tend to inhabit denser
region of the large scale structure where the eects of environment harassment gas-gas
interactions should be more signicant In agreement with this we have shown that similar
galaxies in dierent environment share similar morphology and activity properties leading
to the conclusion that for the bulk of galaxies the transformation of both galaxy activity and
morphology is mainly a product of the intrinsic properties of the galaxies themselves not
of the environment which might nonetheless have an important role in the most extreme
environments such as the cores of clusters and tidally interacting pairs
From this point of view the most likely factor inuencing the evolution of galaxies is
the depth of the potential well in this case more massive galaxies are expected to be more
evolved systems As shown in gure 27 star-forming galaxies peak at absolute magnitudes
of R -18 composite systems at R  -205 AGN at R  -215 and passive systems at
R  -23 in agreement with a scenario in which galaxies of dierent massluminosity are at
dierent stages in their evolution from star-forming to passive systems passing through an
intermediate AGN phase Since more massiveluminous systems reside in denser environ-
ments the trends in gure 20 would be a consequence of the dierent rate of evolution for
systems of dierent mass
The simplest way to interpret our data is therefore to posit that galaxies of dierent
sizes underwent evolution at dierent rates with smaller systems still in the earlier stages
We note that the infall of baryonic matter in a potential well scales as t  05
Therefore bigger primordial over-densities should have faster infall of matter while small
over-densities should have a much slower infall This may be the key in understanding
galaxy formation and evolution
 17 
A fast infallcollapse of material in bigger over-densities would more likely resemble
a monolithic collapse These over-densities would form big bulges and big ellipticals and
supermassive black holes within A slow accretion phase typical of small over-densities
would most likely nd a thin disk equilibrium conguration forming smaller bulge-less spiral
galaxies over longer timescales Galaxies with intermediate potential wells would have both
While disks and spheroids are mostly stable congurations the mix of the two may not
be As the gas continues to fall into the potential well the disk-to-bulge ratio continues to
vary as we have shown in this study As gas is transferred from the outer regions into the
inner regions of the potential well AGN activity is powered As the reservoir of cold gas gets
depleted the AGN strength decreases as we have shown Strong AGN in the local universe
would be associated with bulgy systems with plenty of gas that at earlier times where mostly
star-forming systems as observed
Furthermore if the gaseous reservoir of galaxies is progressively transferred into the
inner regions one would expect that star-formation would become more and more centrally
concentrated as a galaxy ages We have explored this by considering the ratio of the radio
to optical sizes of our galaxies and have found that this ratio decreases for redder systems
consistent with the notion that star-formation becomes more and more centrally concentrated
for more evolved types Figure 28 in agreement with the early work of Hummel 1981
Such a redistribution of the gas is in agreement with the ndings of Cayatte et al 1994
who showed a decreasing ratio of HI to optical radii along the Hubble sequence Recently
evidence of gas infall in the inner regions of late-type galaxies produced by secular evolution
has been demonstrated by Regan et al 2006
This type of scenario seems to favor a transformation of the bulk of galaxies given by
the combined eect of the progressive infalling of matter from the outer regions of galaxies
Fraternali et al 2001 and its re-arrangement by means of disk instabilities such as bars and
density waves Combes 2000 Zhang 1996 Sellwood  Binney 2002 Kormendy  Kennicutt
2004 Since the properties of the gas infall mostly depends on the potential well of the galaxy
the properties of galaxies must vary smoothly with increasing luminosity and objects of
dierent luminosity should have dierent signatures of activity as we nd in the data While
this type of scenario would naturally predict downsizing and account for several observational
properties it stands in contrast to CDM models since it would require the over-densities
associated with massive ellipticals to be formed at an early time and not hierarchically
A merger-driven transformation of galaxies  on the contrary seems unlikely First the
evolution appears to be anti-hierarchical with smaller systems evolving more at later times
Secondly mergers seem unlikely to produce the smooth transformation of both star-formation
and AGN activity in hosts of dierent masses described in this paper Furthermore since
 18 
such a mechanism depends on the density of the environment and the relative velocity of
the encounters it is unlikely that it can work equally well in all environments as required by
Figure 24 Also it is not plausible that mergers would aect galaxies of dierent luminosities
in dierent ways as we nd transforming more low-luminosity systems in the past Gyr than
high-luminosity ones The existence of AGN activity in non-interacting systems Pierce et al
2007 raises further questions for this mechanism
From this point of view the bulk of the density-morphology relation might simply be a
size-density relation with bigger disk galaxies preferentially formed in denser environments at
earlier epochs and evolving more at earlier times than small size galaxies Late-type galaxies
in denser environments are then expected to have more concentrated gas than similar galaxies
in less dense environments Interestingly Cayatte et al 1994 compared late-type galaxies
in the Virgo cluster with galaxies in the eld and found that HI is more concentrated in cluster
galaxies although they interpreted this as a possible eect of the cluster environment on
the Virgo galaxies such as stripping
The size-density correlation would lead to the correlation of star-formation and AGN
activity with density shown in gure 20 smaller galaxies which inhabit less dense environ-
ments have longer transformation times and therefore at the present epoch are still forming
stars while bigger galaxies have evolved into spheroids and their gaseous reservoir is only
used to feed the SMBH at their centers When the trends are normalized respectively to late-
and early-type galaxies the correlation of activity with environment disappears there is no
substantial dierence in the ratio of star-forming disk galaxies or AGN early-type galaxies
across the range in densities across the large scale structure Figure 25 These results are
in agreement with earlier work by Schmitt 2001 From this point of view understanding
the density-morphology and the density-activity correlation would mean understanding why
bigger galaxy-scale over-densities were preferentially born or have aggregated within denser
large-scale environments
8 Conclusion
In this study based on the SDSS and FIRST Surveys we have investigated the evo-
lution of galaxy properties withing the SDSS look-back time  2 Gyr for a sample of 
150000 galaxies in the local universe We have shown a transformation of the activity and
morphology of galaxies over the look-back time of the SDSS and have further demonstrated
that this transformation is more signicant for lower luminosity systems in agreement with
the notion of downsizing in star formation AGN activity and bulge formation over cosmic
time The intensity of the H and radio emission has signicantly dropped over the last 1
 19 
Gyr in emission-line AGN a fact in agreement with the progressive fading of active nuclei
from high to low redshift traced by other surveys The hosts of these nuclei have sub-
stantially transformed towards more concentrated stellar distributions typical of more bulgy
systems The fact that systems of dierent luminosity evolve dierently over this look-back
time supports the claim that for the bulk of galaxies transformation is unlikely the product
of environment-driven mechanisms but rather depends on the masssize of the host itself
This is further supported by the direct study of the galaxy environment presented in
this paper We have shown that galaxies show increasing bulge-to-disk ratio with increasing
density and that this increase is accompanied by a transition in the type of activity from star-
formation-dominated to composite to AGN-dominated and eventually to passive systems
This transition accompanies the well-know density-morphology relation into regions well
beyond the cluster cores where it was originally discovered Dressler 1980 We argue that
these two trends with densities are unlikely driven by environment-driven mechanisms but
rather depend on the masssize of the host itself and dierent evolution timescales for galaxies
associated to dierent potential wells
We note that if over-densities of all sizes were formed at early epochs instead of being
hierarchically formed over time the infall time of gas would be much faster for the largest
over-densities and correspondingly slower for the smaller ones A fast infallcollapse of
material in bigger over-densities would more likely resemble a monolithic collapse These
over-densities would form big bulges and big ellipticals and supermassive black holes within
A slow accretion phase typical of small over-densities would most likely nd a thin disk
equilibrium conguration forming smaller bulge-less spiral galaxies over longer timescales
Galaxies with intermediate potential wells would have both and be a less stable conguration
In agreement with this we have shown that big bulge-dominated galaxies and star-forming
disks are stable congurations while galaxies with intermediate bulges hosting AGN tend
to evolve towards bulgier systems This rapid transformation of systems of intermediate
luminosity into earlier type systems with more prominent bulges demonstrated here suggests
that the intermediate phase may be short-lived compared to the star-forming disk phase
and the red elliptical phase thus explaining the dichotomy between red- and blue-sequence
galaxies
The progressive infall of gas from the outer regions to the inner regions of a galaxy po-
tential well can be traced using the size of radio emission as an indicator of the star-formation
region within galaxies We have shown that a progressive concentration of star-formation
activity towards the inner regions of redder star-forming galaxies is found in agreement
with early work of Hummels 1981 suggesting a picture in which gas is progressively trans-
ported by instabilities towards the inner regions As the gas is funneled towards the center
 20 
star-formation is triggered followed by nuclear activity As this cold gas reservoir is ex-
hausted the AGN activity is progressively brought to a halt explaining the anti-correlation
that we nd between line-strength of active nuclei and galaxy color and other indicators of
star-formation activity which is an extension of the results of Kaumann et al 2003
From this point of view the density-morphology relation and the density-activity relation
discussed in this study is the by-product of dierent formation and evolution timescales for
galaxies associated with dierent primordial over-densities and the fact that the biggest
galaxy-scale over-densities were formed within the denser large-scale structure over-densities

Fig 22 Trend in the median bulginess of the systems with varying environmental density as traced by
the median concentration parameter C High values of C  r50r90 are associated with disky systems Error
bars represent the median absolute deviation of C in each density bin

Fig 23 Trend in the median bulginess of the systems with absolute R magnitude More luminous
systems are on average more bulgy a well-known feature of the Hubble Sequence Error bars represent the
median absolute deviation of C in each bin of magnitude

Fig 24 The correlation of light concentration with the luminosity of a galaxy dening the Hubble
Sequence is independent of the density of the environment  very similar trends are found in all environments
The contribution of the environment appears to be limited to a small yet signicant oset of such trends
toward more concentrated systems in denser environments This is show in the lower-right plot where
crosses trace the dierence in the median values of the high- and the low-density samples and the diamonds
the dierence in the median values of the medium- and the low-density samples

Fig 25 Beyond the density-morphology correlation the fractional abundance of SFG and AGN is not
correlated with the environment if we normalize AGN to the number of early-type galaxies and SFG to the
number of late-type galaxies Fractions higher than 10 for the SFGLATE plot are found because of the
existence of early-type systems spectroscopically classied as star-forming

26 Beyond the density-morphology correlation
the strength of activity in galaxies does not
vary signicantly with density when the same type of host is chosen The star-forming sub-samples have
been selected from a high-luminosity volume-limited sample 21  R  20 and a low-luminosity one
195  R  185 Similarly the AGN subsamples have been selected from a high-luminosity volume
limited sample225  R  215 and a low-luminosity volume-limited sample 205  R  195
Error bars are the absolute median deviation in each bin

Fig 28 The median concentration of the radio emission in star-forming galaxies in high   1
galaxyMpc3 and low   1 galaxyMpc3 density environments The emission becomes more centrally
concentrated in redder galaxies and the concentration does not depend on the environment Radio sizes have
been determined as the HWHM of a two-dimensional gaussian t to the FIRST radio maps
