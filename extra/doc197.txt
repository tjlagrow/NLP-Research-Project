ABSTRACT
K band observations of the galaxy populations of three high redshift z  0810
X-ray selected massive clusters are presented The observations reach a depth of
K  215 corresponding to K   35 mag The evolution of the galaxy properties
are discussed in terms of their K band luminosity functions and the K band Hubble
diagram of brightest cluster galaxies
The bulk of the galaxy luminosities as characterised by the parameter K  from
the Schechter 1976 function are found to be consistent with passive evolution with
a redshift of formation of zf  152 This is consistent with observations of other
high redshift clusters but may be in disagreement with galaxies in the eld at similar
redshifts A good match to the shape of the Coma cluster luminosity function is found
by simply dimming the high redshift luminosity function by an amount consistent
with passive evolution The evolution of the cumulative fraction of K band light as a
function of luminosity shows no evidence of merger activity in the brighter galaxies
The evolution of the brightest cluster galaxies BCGs is tested by their K band
Hubble diagram and by the fraction of K band cluster light in the BCGs The evolution
observed is consistent with recent previous observations although the scatter in the
Hubble diagram allows for a range of evolutionary histories The fraction of cluster
light contained in the BCGs is not smaller than that in Coma suggesting that they are
already very massive with no need to hypothesise signicant mergers in their futures

INTRODUCTION
The evolutionary history of galaxies in clusters remains a
subject of debate The two most common explanations of
massive early-type galaxy formation and evolution are those
of monolithic collapse eg Eggen et al 1962 and hierarchi-
cal merging eg Cole et al 1994 In the monolithic collapse
scenario all the galaxies and the stars therein are formed
in a single burst and subsequently evolve passively along
the main sequence with no further star formation Such
a model will result in a very homogeneous population of
galaxies since their ages and metallicities will all be close to
identical with a small degree of scatter reecting the varia-
tions in initial mass function at formation There is a signi-
cant body of observational evidence that luminous early type
cluster galaxies are indeed remarkably homogeneous For ex-
ample the observed tightness of the colour-magnitude rela-

tion eg Visvanathan  Sandage 1977 Bower et al 1992
is naturally explained by such a homogeneous population
In the merging model galaxies form by a series of merg-
ers within a hierarchical model of structure formation eg
Kaumann et al 1993 The hierarchical scenario presents a
radically dierent evolution than in the monolithic collapse
picture Bursts of star formation related to mergers may
occur and a more gradual increase in the number of mas-
sive galaxies in a cluster would then occur as small galaxies
merge to form larger ones
Although the ages of the majority of the stars in galax-
ies in both scenarios are similar in order to explain the
tightness of the colour-magnitude relation and the evolu-
tion of the fundamental plane the mass as a function of
look-back time will be quite dierent ie the epoch of the
assembly of massive galaxies is not the same as the epoch of
star formation in the merging case The hierarchical model
will exhibit negative evolution of mass as a function of red-
shift ie at higher redshifts the massive galaxies will be
less massive on average whereas in the monolithic collapse
SC Ellis and LR Jones
model galaxies will have a constant mass with redshift The
negative evolution expected from hierarchical models will
be most apparent in the most massive galaxies which are
predicted to have assembled more recently The redshift of
assembly of massive galaxies is however poorly known and
is probably dependent on environment
If one is interested in the stellar mass of the galax-
ies as opposed to their star formation rate then the K
band is a good choice in which to make observations since
the light at such wavelengths originates mainly from the
longer lived stars of the main sequence see eg gure 1 of
Kaumann  Charlot 1998 and has the added advantages
that the k-correction dierences between galaxies of dierent
spectral types are small in K and the Galactic extinction by
dust is small Thus computing K band luminosity functions
for clusters of galaxies should give a useful measure of the
mass distribution of galaxies within clusters see section 4
and Trentham  Mobasher 1998
Brightest cluster galaxies BCGs are known to have a
very limited variation in absolute magnitude which histor-
ically led to their nomination as a candidate for a cosmo-
logical standard candle with which to directly measure the
curvature of the Universe Sandage 1972a Sandage 1972b
Controversy over their suitability as standard candles is be-
lieved to be due to environment with BCGs in high LX clus-
ters exhibiting much less scatter than those in low LX sys-
tems Brough et al 2002 Burke et al 2000 However the
evolution of BCG properties with redshift is now the pri-
mary interest of research on BCGs since there is much evi-
dence that they are a special case in the evolution of galaxies
within clusters For instance it is known that BCGs often do
not follow the same luminosity function as other galaxies in
clusters Schechter 1976 Dressler 1978 Bhavsar  Barrow
1985 most probably due to the fact that they have a pe-
culiar formation history Therefore the evolution of BCGs
can provide a dierent and complementary study of galaxy
formation theories compared with the general cluster pop-
ulation The K band Hubble diagram of BCGs provides an
ecient measure of the evolution of BCGs and we present
our results of this in section 5
Throughout this paper we have used a cosmology of
H0  70 km s1 Mpc1 in a at universe with M  03
and   07 except where stated

21 The Clusters
We present a study of three of the most massive  1015M
Maughan et al 2003 Maughan et al 2003 high redshift
clusters known They are thus ideal probes of galaxy evolu-
tion within clusters Such massive clusters at high redshift
are very rare and we have an unusual opportunity to study
the galaxy populations of rich distant clusters and com-
pare results with local massive clusters such as Coma The
high redshift of the clusters should make any evolution in
the galaxy populations easier to observe Two of the clus-
ters ClJ1226 and ClJ1415 appear relaxed based on their
X-ray morphologies and one of them ClJ0152 is probably
in a state of merging Thus we also have a small selection of
dierent environments All three clusters are X-ray selected
and thus should be relatively free from projection eects
The galaxy properties should also be largely independent of
the selection process They were all discovered in the Wide
Angle ROSAT Pointed Survey WARPS Scharf et al 1997
Jones et al 1998 Perlman et al 2002 Details are given be-

is at a
redshift of z  0833 and has a bolometric X-ray luminosity
of 16  02  1045 ergs s1 It is composed of two major
subclumps which are probably gravitationally bound
Maughan et al 2003 The projected separation of the
subclumps is 15 arcmin or 720 kpc suggesting that they
may be in the early stage of a very massive merger event
Individually the subclumps have X-ray temperatures and
luminosities of LX  10  02  1045 ergs s1 TX  5509
keV and LX  5811
09 keV
respectively Thus each clump considered individually is
still a massive cluster with Mtotal  6  1014 M and
Mtotal  5 1014 M for the northern and southern clumps
respectively see Maughan et al 2003

ClJ122693332 Ebeling et al 2001 Maughan et al 2003
Cagnoni et al 2001 is at a redshift z  0888 It has a
bolometric X-ray luminosity of LX  5302

09 keV and
Mtotal  1402
02  1015 M Maughan et al 2003 making
it one of the most massive clusters known at high redshifts
The cluster appears remarkably relaxed in X-rays indicating
little dynamic activity The K band image with adaptively
smoothed XMM X-ray contours from Maughan et al 2003b
is shown in gure 1
213 ClJ1415
ClJ141513612 is at the highest redshift of the three clus-
ters with z  103 Perlman et al 2002 Although at
present we have only ROSAT X-ray data for the cluster
so sub-structure may not be resolved it exhibits smooth X-
ray contours suggesting it may be dynamically relaxed It
has a bolometric X-ray luminosity of LX  2  1045 ergs
s1 and is thus likely to be a very massive cluster
22 Observations
All three clusters were observed at the 38m United King-
dom Infrared Telescope UKIRT on Mauna Kea Hawaii
using the UFTI camera a 1024  1024 pixel HgCdTe ar-
ray with a pixel size of 0091 arcseconds Observations were
made with the K98 and J98 lters 50 cut-os 117133m
and 203237m respectively with an exposure time of 66s
per frame or 60s per frame for a minority of observations
made in service time and the seeing was typically  05
arcseconds in K The total exposure times in K are listed in
table 1 along with the average seeing for each cluster A spa-
tial dithering of 15 arcsec was employed Since the eld of

052 The observations covered an area of 22  244
corresponding to an area of 10  13 Mpc For this cluster
with the highest redshift two oset elds were observed in
order to reduce the uncertainties in the eld subtraction
For the other clusters one oset eld was observed
23 Data Reduction
Each observation of a particular eld consisted of a num-
ber of dithered frames of the object plus a dark frame con-
taining only the instrumental background The data were
dark-subtracted at-elded and combined using standard
iraf procedures A bad-pixel mask was applied to exclude
any defective pixels Flat-eld frames were produced from
the object frames using the median value of each pixel after
applying a 4 clipping and scaling each frame by its modal
value to account for sky brightness variations
Each frame had its background sky value subtracted
using a 3-clipped mean as an estimate of the sky value
The relative osets of each frame were then measured using
bright stars in the eld of view Finally the frames were
shifted and combined using the mean value of each pixel
again after applying a 4 clipping around the median value
3 PHOTOMETRY
31 Standard stars
The photometry of the galaxies was calibrated using stan-
dard stars observed on the same nights as the cluster elds
The true magnitude of any celestial body is taken to be
mtrue  ZP  25logCR  Asecz  BJ  Ktrue
where ZP is the zero-point magnitude CR is the count
rate A is the coecient of extinction per unit airmass z is
the zenith angle secz therefore being the airmass and B
is the colour coecient necessary due to dierences in the
response of the combination of camera and lters used and
the standard star system
Values of ZP  A and B were determined from obser-
vations of standard stars taken on each night Standard
stars were selected from the UKIRT faint standards list
Hawarden et al 2001 Typically each night 6 stars of vary-
ing colours were observed between 1 and 3 times each at
diering airmasses
Whilst the value of A and ZP may vary from night to
night the value of the colour coecient B should be almost
constant Thus a single value of B was measured from all
the photometric nights combined The value we obtained
is consistent with zero as expected from the lter design
Tokunaga et al 2002 An independent value of ZP was
measured for each night and for most nights an indepen-
dent value of A was measured Where this was not possible
a value of A from other nights was used and checked for
consistency All were found to be consistent In any case the
low extinction in the K band and the low airmasses at which
most observations were performed combine to make this a
relatively small correction 02 mag
The parameters are listed in table 1 Note that the nal
photometric error as estimated from the scatter in the stan-
dard star measurements is less than 01 mag Corrections

ClJ1226 with adaptively smoothed XMM X-ray contours from
Maughan et al 2003b The image is  29 arcmin square
view of 90x90 arcsec covered only a fraction of each cluster
mosaics of dierent sizes for each cluster were used On each
night standard stars Hawarden et al 2001 were observed
in order to calibrate the zero-point air mass coecient and
colour coecient Some nights had patchy cloud cover and
thus yielded inaccurate photometric calibration Such nights
were deemed to be non-photometric and a calibration was
obtained via observations of the same elds on photometric
nights Non-photometric data were then weighted according
to their shorter eective exposure times
Observations were also made of one or more oset elds
in the vicinity of each cluster on the sky chosen as a reason-
ably blank part of a digitised sky survey image since at
these redshifts the clusters are also blank on digitised sky
survey images The purpose of these elds was to provide
a means of estimating the contamination from foreground
and background galaxies when constructing luminosity func-
tions The oset elds were typically 4 arcmin 19 Mpc
from the clusters beyond the virial radii
Observations of ClJ0152 were made in service time on
the nights of 15th and 20th October 2000 24th Decem-
ber 2000 28th December 2000 and 16th January 2001 The
northern and southern clumps will be referred to as eld A
and eld B The nights of 16th January 24th December and
28th December were found to be non-photometric and were
treated accordingly The areas observed were 150  139
and 151150 for elds A and B respectively correspond-
ing to a physical size of 836  752kpc and 843  836 kpc
ClJ12269332 was observed on the 18th 19th and 20th
April 2001 The night of the 18th had patchy cloud cover
and was deemed non-photometric The observations covered
an area of 247  31 corresponding to a physical size of
13  14 Mpc
Cl1415 was observed on the 10th 11th 12th April 2002

32 Galaxies
The SExtractor software of Bertin  Arnouts 1996 was
used to search for objects in each eld To detect objects
a threshold value per pixel must be chosen along with a
minimum number of connected pixels Because the nal im-
ages are constructed from a jittered pattern of images the
depth of observation varied across the nal image being
at its deepest in the centres and shallowest at the edges
Therefore detection of objects was done in two regions for
each image using dierent detection parameters in order to
reach as deep as possible in the centre of the image whilst
avoiding spurious detections at the edges of the image Typ-
ically the minimum signicance of the detections were 35
or 4 in the centres of the images and 7 at the edges where
 is the background RMS determined from counts over the
whole image and is thus an overestimate of  in the central
region and an underestimate in the outer region although
this is not the case for the central region of ClJ1415 when
 was determined from the central region alone Reliabil-
ity of the object detection and in particular the handling
of overlapping objects was checked by eye Faint pixels sur-
rounding deblended objects are assigned to one of the sub-
objects with a probability based on the expected contribu-
tion at that pixel from each of the deblended objects see
Bertin  Arnouts 1996
Counts were measured using an adaptive aperture based
on Krons algorithm Kron 1980 and also in a circular aper-
ture with radius chosen to maximise the signal to noise
For each object a value of stellarity was also measured see
Bertin  Arnouts 1996
To determine the magnitudes of the objects equation 1
was used with the following complication It is unknown to
start with what the true colours of the objects are therefore
the magnitudes cannot be determined To circumvent this
problem an approximate magnitude was measured in the
J and K bands neglecting the colour term in equation 1
This allowed an approximate colour to be determined The
approximate colour is then multiplied by a correction factor
previously determined using the same technique to measure
the approximate colours of standard stars and their true
colours The average value of
was 0982
J Ktrue
J Kapprox
Note that for the determination of colours magnitudes
derived from xed circular apertures were used whereas the
adaptive aperture magnitudes were used to derive pseudo-
total magnitudes The use of adaptive aperture magnitudes
using SExtractors Kron radius should avoid the prob-
lem described by Andreon 2002 of underestimating uxes
for galaxies with low central surface brightness The over-
all reliability of the photometry was checked by comparing
the eld galaxy counts derived from the oset elds with
deeper published results see g 2 There is generally good
agreement down to our limiting magnitudes see below
Stargalaxy discrimination was determined using SEx-
tractors stellarity parameter A cut-o of 08 was selected
to delimit the two classes of objects with those objects with
values greater than 08 being excluded as stars This value
was conrmed by examination of the radial proles of de-
tected objects It was found that objects with a stellarity
greater than 08 had an almost constant Gaussian FWHM
close to the value of the seeing whereas objects with stellar-
ity less than 08 had more extended proles The results are
insensitive to the precise value of this cut-o as there were
very few stars in each eld
4 LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS
K band luminosity functions KLFs were calculated sepa-
rately for each cluster of galaxies This was done in the fol-
lowing way Firstly some of the brightest galaxies have been
spectroscopically conrmed as cluster members so where
there are no other bright galaxies in the eld no subtraction
is necessary At fainter magnitudes the number of galaxies
Ncl in a bin of width M was counted with M  1 for
ClJ0152 and ClJ1415 and M  075 for ClJ1226 The con-
tamination from foreground and background galaxies was
estimated by counting the number of galaxies Nback in the
oset elds associated with the cluster Thus the number
of galaxies in each bin is given by
Nbin  Ncl  Nback cid16 Acl
Abackcid17
where Acl is the area of the cluster eld and Aback is the
area of the oset eld Note that because two dierent de-
tection thresholds have been used for each eld the faintest
bins are from a smaller area than the brighter bins since
only a small area was deep enough to detect objects of this
magnitude Therefore the detections from the smaller area
have been scaled by an appropriate factor to bring them into
line with the detections from the total area
The corresponding error on the number of galaxies in
each bin is found by summing in quadrature the error on
Ncl and the error on Nback

derived by tting to the data in table 1 of
Brainerd et al 1995 Following Djorgovski et al 1995 we
used rlim  Klim  3
Our limiting K magnitude was determined by plot-
ting the number density of galaxies from the oset elds
as a function of magnitude and determining the drop-o
point when compared to large area eld surveys Figure 2
shows the number density of galaxies in our four oset
elds ClJ1226 and ClJ1415 were found to be complete to
Klim  215 and ClJ0152 was found to be complete to
Klim  200
No corrections have been made for gravitational lensing
of the background galaxies by the cluster dark matter This
eect magnies the uxes of background galaxies Trentham
 Mobasher 1998 show that the net increase in the number
of galaxies to be subtracted is small 5 at the redshifts
and magnitudes considered here and for an equally massive
cluster because a large fraction of the eld galaxies along
the line of sight are in the foreground This correction is
signicantly less than the statistical errors
Luminosity functions for the three clusters are shown
in gure 3 4 and 5 along with the best tting Schechter
functions as described below
41 Fitting Schechter functions
The parametric Schechter 1976 luminosity function is of
the form
dL  
L e L
L dLL
where L is the characteristic luminosity at which the
function turns over to the faint end which has slope  The
normalisation of the function is given by

where K  is the characteristic K band magnitude Note
that  in equation 8 is not identical to the 
but in fact diers by a factor 04ln10
In general the Schechter function is found to be a good
t to composite cluster galaxy LFs as in the 2dF Galaxy

Redshift Survey De Propris et al 2003 However for indi-
vidual clusters there is often observed a dip in the LF eg
Biviano et al 1995 for the Coma cluster Yagi et al 2002
for a sample of 10 clusters Biviano et al 1995 suggest
that the dip is caused by a recent episode of star-formation
in the brightest galaxies thereby enhancing their luminosi-
ties However the presence of a dip in the H band LF of
Coma observed by Andreon 2002 suggests that recent star-
formation is unlikely to be the cause of the dip since the
H band is rather insensitive to the enhanced blue emis-
sion accompanying star-formation Rather Andreon 2002
suggests that the dip is the result of combining the LFs of
several dierent types see also Bingelli et al 1988 How-

Schechter function ts are as for gure 4
ever Andreon 2002 points out that such a dip is not
seen in the near-infrared LFs of ve clusters studied by
Trentham  Mobasher 1998 nor in the H band LF of
the Coma cluster measured by De Propris et al 1998 If
the dip is the result of the combination of dierent LFs for
dierent morphological types then the dierence between
the De Propris et al 1998 LF and the Andreon 2002 LF
suggests that the dip in the Coma LF may be dependent on
which part of the cluster is being observed and hence the
particular morphological mix measured In the present case
no obvious dips are present in any of our LFs and given the
limited resolution in magnitude caused by the statistical un-
certainties the use of any functions more complicated than
a Schechter function is not justied
Equation 8 was t to the KLFs of all 3 clusters us-
ing the maximum likelihood technique of Cash 1979 This
technique ts a Schechter function to the background sub-
tracted binned data in the following way The parameters
K  and  are free parameters and are allowed to vary be-
tween assumed limits For each combination of K  and  in
the parameter space a Schechter function is calculated with
the normalisation  set such that the predicted number of
galaxies is equal to the actual number of galaxies observed
within the same magnitude limits Thence the Cash statis-
tic C can be computed
C  2
nilnei  ei  lnni
where N is the number of bins ni is the observed num-
ber of galaxies in the ith bin and ei is the expected number
of galaxies in the ith bin resulting from the Schechter func-
tion The parameters for which C is a minimum are deemed
to be the best tting parameters see Cash 1979
It was found that  could not be strongly constrained
and therefore following De Propris et al 1999 we x at
  09 which is the value for the KLF of the Coma clus-
ter De Propris et al 1998 and of the eld Gardner et al
1997 The characteristic magnitude K  was t as a free
parameter and  was determined by ensuring that the in-
tegral of the function down to the limiting magnitude was
equal to the total number of galaxies to the same magnitude
It has been noticed since early studies of cluster lu-
minosity functions that the brightest cluster galaxies are
a special class of object Peach 1969 and that a better
t to the LF can often be made by excluding them from
the t Schechter 1976 Dressler 1978 Therefore Schechter
functions were t both including the BCGs and excluding
them Note that in the case of ClJ0152 we have excluded
two BCGs one from each sub-clump of the system The
best tting parameters are given in table 2 along with the
2 probability since the maximum likelihood statistic does
not give a measure of the goodness of t The best tting
Schechter functions including and excluding the BCGs are
also shown in gures 3 4 and 5
For two of the three clusters studied here good ts are
found both including and excluding the BCG see table 2
For ClJ1226 a marginal t is obtained excluding the BCG
because of one high bin at K  204 but the t is poorer
when the BCG is included a conclusion supported by a vi-
sual inspection of gure 3 The values of K  from each clus-
ter are consistent with each other but are systematically
fainter by 02 mag when the BCGs are excluded This dif-
ference is of similar size to the statistical uncertainty For
consistency with previous measurements of Coma in the
following section we will refer to K  values from the ts
excluding BCGs
42 Evolution of K 
To evaluate the evolution in K  models of galaxy evolution
were made using the synthetic stellar population SSP li-
braries of Bruzual  Charlot 2003 The parameters of the
model are the star formation history the initial mass func-
tion and the metallicity For all models considered here a
single burst of star formation was assumed to occur but
at dierent epochs the initial mass function was that of
Salpeter 1955 and the metallicity was assumed to be solar
ie Z  2 Models were constructed for passive evolution
in the following way Spectral energy distributions SEDs
were drawn from the Bruzual  Charlot 2003 libraries for

dierent ages A redshift of formation was chosen corre-
sponding to an age t  0 Then for the adopted cosmology
redshifts were calculated for the rest of the ages The SEDs
were redshifted to the appropriate redshift for each age and
multiplied by the lter transmission curve Thus the ux of
the SSP could be calculated for each redshift The uxes
were converted to apparent magnitudes and scaled appro-
priately eg for the evolution of K  the models were nor-
malised to K  of the Coma cluster see below
No-evolution models are made by simply choosing an
SED of a particular age and integrating the redshifted spec-
trum under the lter transmission curves
Passively evolving models with redshifts of formation
zf  15 zf  2 and zf  5 were made along with a no evolu-
tion model of a 10Gyr old population The results are shown
in gure 6 The models were scaled to the Coma cluster with
K   109 at z  00231 excluding BCGs De Propris et al
It is clear that the trend seen in De Propris et al 1999
is followed here and extended to higher redshifts All values
of K  are brighter than predicted by no evolution and are
generally consistent with passive evolution models The high
redshift points seem most consistent with zf  15 although
the errorbars are large enough to allow a range of zf  A
better t to all the data would be obtained by normalising to
K  at z  02 which is obtained from the mean of 3 clusters
rather than normalising to Coma In that case zf  2 would
be a better t to the highest z data
Although it was not possible to constrain  for any
individual cluster in order to verify the choice of   09
we have combined the counts from all three clusters into a
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
general LF and tted a Schechter function leaving  as a
free parameter
The combined LF was generated by nding a weighted
average of the counts in each bin of the individual clusters
where the weighting factor was the reciprocal of  In fact
the  values for each cluster are similar so the weighting
has little eect The combined LFs excluding and including
BCGs with the best tting Schechter functions are shown
in gures 7 and 9 respectively The best tting values were
K   1853 and   054 when the BCGs were not in-
cluded and   094 and K   1783 when they were
The condence limits excluding BCGs are shown in g-
ure 8 where it can be seen that the constraint on  is not
strong ranging from   015  09
There is a large degree of degeneracy between K  and
 as is evident from the shape of the contour in gure 8
Consequently when tting a Schechter function K  may be
misleading if the faint end slope is poorly constrained To
quantify this eect the combined LF was t with   09
The results are given in table 2 The result excluding BCGs
is a brighter value of K  as expected from the shape of
gure 8
Consequently if   054 for high redshift clusters
then the evolution in K  may not be as strong as seen in
gure 6 and values of zf  2  5 would be more consistent
with the K  measurements However if the last bin of the
combined KLF of gure 7 is excluded then   099 
04 Thus it is unclear whether the measured value of  
054 is in artefact due to incompleteness in the faintest
bin and therefore we elect to use the value of   09 for
the individual ts to clusters
43 Comparison with the Coma cluster
We make a comparison with the Coma cluster because it
has a similar LX 16x1045 erg s1 TX 8 keV and mass
1015 M as the high redshift clusters and it is relatively
well studied at NIR wavelengths The K band LF of the
Coma cluster shown in gure 7 was derived from the H band
luminosity function of De Propris et al 1998 using their
given value of H  K  022 and to a magnitude limit for
which all galaxies had spectroscopic membership conrma-
tion Note that the two LFs in gure 7 have not been scaled
in any way the high redshift clusters are of similar richness
as Coma although the comparison is not exact because the
high redshift LFs were obtained from a larger fraction of
the cluster area than for Coma see below The Coma LF
of Andreon  Pello 2000 covers a smaller area than that of
De Propris et al 1998 but is in good agreement except for
a dip in one bin For the high redshift clusters the conver-
sion from apparent to absolute magnitude was made using
a k -correction calculated for a 10Gyr old synthetic stellar

The typical size of the k -correction was  07 mag
The oset in absolute magnitude of K 12 mag be-
tween the Coma KLF and the combined high redshift KLF
indicates the degree of evolution The same degree of evolu-
tion is also seen in gure 6 as the dierence between the ob-
served values of K  and the no-evolution predictions Evolv-
ing the t to the high redshift KLF assuming a passively
evolving model with zf  2 gives a surprisingly good de-
scription of the observed Coma KLF the dotted lines in
gures 7  9 Thus dierences between the high redshift
and low redshift systems as shown by the bright end of
the LF studied here can be accounted for by purely passive
evolution There is no obvious change in the shape of the
44 Integrated light functions
An interesting and complementary measure of galaxy evo-
lution within clusters is provided by their integrated light
function This is calculated from the LF using
j Lk 
k  1     n
where Ni is the number of galaxies in the ith bin of the
LF and Li is the luminosity of the bin and n is the total
number of bins For the BCGs and bins in which there is
only one galaxy the individual contribution was calculated
using the total luminosity of the galaxy and not the bin
centre

eters for the combined luminosity function when BCGs are ex-
cluded
Figure 9 The combined luminosity function of three clusters
including BCGs Symbols are as in gure 7
Integrated light functions were calculated for all three
clusters and for the Coma cluster These are shown in g-
ures 10 and 11 for data excluding and including BCGs In
order to compare each cluster the luminosity has been nor-
malised to L Thus the eects of any pure luminosity evo-
lution such as passive evolution which would alter the lu-
minosity by a constant factor are eliminated from the plot
and any variation between the shapes is due to some other
evolutionary eect Note also that in order to make this com-
parison the integrations of the light functions must reach the
same depth below L As this was not the case the counts
for the faintest bin for ClJ1415 and the two faintest bins
for ClJ0152 were calculated from the best tting Schechter
functions and thus these are not shown in the plots The
contribution from these bins is only 510 of the light inte-
grated to our limit of LL  005 Integrating the Schechter
function to luminosities fainter than this limit would add
only a further  1

Figure 10 Integrated light functions for all three clusters com-
pared to Coma Brightest cluster galaxies have been excluded
Figure 11 Integrated light functions as in gure 10 but with
BCGs included
tions for the four clusters excluding their BCGs shown in
gure 10 shows that they are all consistent If the BCGs
are included in the integrated light function as in gure 11
the light functions are generally consistent within errors but
the scatter is greater
If merging plays an important role in the evolution of
massive galaxies since z  09 then it would be expected
that there would be a higher fraction of total cluster light
in bright galaxies at low redshift compared to high redshift
Little evidence is seen for this in either gure 10 or 11 If
BCGs are included then ClJ1226 is seen to have a slightly
higher fraction of light in its bright galaxies than Coma and
ClJ0152 has a lower fraction The lack of any systematic
dierence between the integrated light functions of the high
redshift clusters and Coma is suggestive that merging does
not play a dominant role in the evolution of massive early-
type galaxies since z  09
One caveat is that interpretation of the integrated light
functions is complicated by the dierent areas observed for
each cluster The observations of the high redshift clusters
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
reach radii of 3040 of the virial radii as measured from
the X-ray properties and provided by Ben Maughan pri-
vate communication whereas the observation of the Coma
cluster covers only 016 of the virial radius r200  23 Mpc
for H0  70km s1 Mpc1 Reiprich  Bohringer 2002
Driver et al 1998 show that the dwarf to giant galaxy ra-
tio within rich clusters is strongly anti-correlated with the
mean projected density outside the cores of clusters Our ob-
servations do not however reach dwarf galaxy luminosities
Andreon 2001 conrms that the fraction of dwarf galaxies
increases in the outer parts of a z  03 cluster AC118
and furthermore shows that the faint end slope of the KLF
recovered from the outer parts of the cluster is considerably
steeper than the faint end slope of the KLF recovered from
the core Consequently comparisons of observations cover-
ing dierent fractions of the virial radius must be made with
these eects in mind However our concern is with the bright
end of the LF in the inner regions of the clusters where these
eects are unlikely to produce large dierences
5 THE BRIGHTEST CLUSTER GALAXIES
The uneasy tting of some BCGs on the Schechter function
may be symptomatic of a dierent evolutionary process to
the majority of galaxies within a cluster We now examine
this evolution
The K band Hubble diagram is shown in gure 12
The models are the same as described above only now
they are normalised to the low redshift z  01 high LX
 19  1044 ergs s1 03  35 keV BCG photometry of
Brough et al 2002 The high LX clusters from gure 1
of Brough et al 2002 are shown as the open circles The
BCGs in the current study shown as solid points extend
to higher redshifts Note that there are two BCGs shown
for ClJ0152 one for each sub-clump The magnitudes of
the BCGs were measured in a metric aperture of radius
rm  125h1kpc for comparison with Brough et al 2002
The BCG in ClJ1226 overlaps with at least one fainter
galaxy observed in projection this galaxy has been sepa-
rated by Sextractor We note that the total magnitude of the
ClJ1226 BCG measured here K1534 mag is consistent
with the isophotal value of K155 measured by Cagnoni et
al 2001
It can be seen from gure 12 that the BCGs in ClJ1226
and ClJ1415 are somewhat brighter than no-evolution pre-
dictions but in good agreement with passive evolution mod-
els The BCGs of ClJ0152 are fainter relative to the models
than any other BCGs in gure 12 at z  04 perhaps indica-
tive that the BCGs are not fully formed Indeed as ClJ0152
is probably a merging system Maughan et al 2003 it may
be supposed that if the BCGs merge and no further star-
formation is triggered they will produce a brighter BCG
more consistent with the other high redshift BCGs
In contrast ClJ1226 has a relaxed X-ray morphology
Maughan et al 2003 Ebeling et al 2001 and is one of the
brightest BCGs at z  04 relative to the models These
results are suggestive that the evolution of BCGs at high
redshifts may be related to the dynamical history of the
cluster they inhabit although conrmation awaits a larger
sample

tal K band light for each cluster The total luminosity in
each cluster was calculated from the LFs as for the inte-
grated light functions to a depth of LL  006 The sub-
clumps in ClJ0152 have been treated independently since
each has a BCG In the case of Coma a correction was made
to account for the smaller fraction of the virial radius ob-
served This was calculated using the number density pro-
le of Kent  Gunn 1982 to determine the ratio of the
number of galaxies within the observed area to that within
037rvir the average area observed for the high redshift sam-
ple The correction was a factor of 196 The luminosity of
the Coma BCG NGC4874 was calculated using the 2MASS
total magnitude Note that there are two galaxies of simi-
lar brightness in Coma NGC4874 and NGC4884 We have
taken NGC4874 as the BCG here as it resides at the centre
of the X-ray emission
The results show that the fraction of light in the BCGs
at high redshift is greater than or equal to the fraction in
Coma This is still true if both brightest galaxies in Coma
are included
There are uncertainties in the corrections applied in or-
der to compare the clusters which were originally measured
to slightly dierent depths and covered dierent areas al-
though the variations in radius would produce only small
variations in total K band light 20 using the Coma light
prole A physical interpretation is that the high redshift
BCGs are already of similar or greater mass to the BCG in
Coma with no need to hypothesise any signicant mergers
in their future evolution
Why are the BCGs in ClJ0152 signicantly fainter than
the BCG in ClJ1226 We will test the assumption that the
stellar mass of the BCG is related to the mass of its host clus-
ter We assume the ratio of masses of the BCGs in ClJ0152
and ClJ1226 is proportional to the ratio of the total cluster
masses times the ratio of the fractions of galaxy light in the
BCGs assuming the mass fraction in galaxies is the same
in each cluster Then the combined eects of the lower to-
tal mass of each subclump of ClJ0152 by a factor of 039
compared to ClJ1226 and the lower fraction of cluster K-
band light in the BCGs by a factor of 069 are consistent
with the dierence in the luminosities of the BCGs by 157
mag or a factor of 024 This suggests that the BCG stellar
masses at high redshift may be lower in lower mass host clus-
ters as inferred by Brough et al 2002 Burke et al 2000
and Nelson et al 2002
We note that if the BCGs in ClJ0152 were to merge
as was hypothesised to explain their positions in the Hub-
ble diagram the fraction of light in the BCG would remain
roughly similar
6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The evolution of the galaxy populations of three high red-
shift clusters of galaxies has been studied The bulk evolu-
tion of the galaxies as characterised by K  is found to be
consistent with passive evolution with a redshift of forma-
tion zf  152 Further evidence for passive evolution is
seen in the similarity of the shape of the high-redshift LF
with that of Coma and in the consistent shapes of the in-
tegrated light functions Trentham  Mobasher 1998 also
reached similar conclusions about the evolution of the shape
of the K-band LF albeit with poorer accuracy
Purely passive evolution of early-type galaxies is con-
sistent with several other studies including the evolution of
the K band luminosity function De Propris et al 1999
evolution of the fundamental plane in terms of mass-light
ratios van Dokkum et al 1998 and studies of the scatter
of the colour-magnitude relation see eg Ellis et al 1997
Stanford et al 1998
Our conclusions are dierent to those of Barger et al
1998 who found no evidence of evolution in M 
K for clus-
ters at 031z056 assuming a q005 cosmology However
the cosmological dependence is such that at these redshifts
the q005 NE prediction is very similar to the m03
07 zf  2 passive evolution prediction see eg gure
8 of De Propris et al 1999 Thus the results of Barger et
al are in agreement with those found here
When discussing formation it is important to distin-
guish between the epoch at which the stars in the galax-
ies were formed and the epoch at which the galaxies were
assembled The studies of the fundamental plane and the
colour-magnitude relation refer to the epoch of star forma-
tion If merging were a dissipationless process then it would
be possible to have no extra star formation as a result of a
merger and thus the age of the stars within a galaxy could
be older than the age of galaxy assembly A study of the
cluster of galaxies MS 1054-03 at z  083 is presented by
van Dokkum et al 1999 and van Dokkum et al 2000 in
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
The K band galaxy luminosity functions of three massive high redshift clusters of galaxies
which there is observed a high fraction of merging red galax-
ies Very little star formation is seen in the merging galaxies
constituting evidence that the galaxies are in fact somewhat
younger than the stars that reside within them
Is such merging reected in the evolution of the LF
The K band luminosity of a galaxy is very nearly indepen-
dent of star-formation but reects the mass of the old stars
within the galaxy Thus K magnitudes are a good measure
of the stellar mass of a galaxy Diaferio et al 2001 give
predictions of the evolution of the KLF from semi-analytic
models of dissipationless hierarchical structure formation
The models show that there is very little evolution of the
number of massive galaxies in clusters since z  08 The
galaxies are assembled at high redshift and evolve passively
with little subsequent merging after z  08 A detailed
comparison with these models is however not possible be-
cause the luminosity evolution predictions in the models are
not suciently accurate for massive galaxies Diaferio et al
It is clear from gure 6 that the bulk of galaxies in our
sample were brighter in the past than predicted from no-
evolution models by K  -12 mag at z  09 A direct
comparison of the high-redshift K band LF with that of
Coma suggests that the two are very similar in shape and
the dierences in M 
K may be reconciled by pure luminos-
ity evolution The fading with time by K  -12 mag is
consistent with passive evolution from a formation epoch
zf  2 In the monolithic collapse picture this would be ex-
pected naturally The models of Diaferio et al 2001 show
that this is also predicted for massive cluster galaxies in a
hierarchical scenario since most merging takes place early
on the history of the cluster
In a merging model passive evolutionary processes will
still be present and thus K  would still appear brighter than
no-evolution predictions A probe of extrapassive processes
is the shape of the LF It is found that  is consistent with
that of Coma although it is poorly constrained here Perhaps
a stronger test for extrapassive processes is the shape of the
integrated light function The lack of any major changes
seen in gure 10 is suggestive that passive evolution alone is
responsible for the evolution measured in K  We conclude
that the luminosity evolution of bright galaxies in massive
clusters is consistent with pure passive evolution but note
that this may be consistent with hierarchical models if most
merging takes place at high redshifts
The mild K-band evolution of luminous eld galax-
ies to z1 found in recent surveys is also consistent with
luminosity evolution although the amount of evolution
M 
K  054 012 mag Pozzetti et al 2003 or MK 
07  03 mag Feulner et al 2003 Drory et al 2003 see
also Im et al 2002 is less than that observed here M 
12  03 mag or by De Propris et al 1999 M 
090  025 in massive clusters The recent results on the
eld evolution indicate little change in  to z1 and are in
contrast to the conclusions drawn by Kaumann  Charlot
1998 and Kaumann et al 1996 who found evidence for
a decit of massive galaxies in the eld at z  1
The dierence in luminosity evolution between the eld
and massive clusters both at z09 is in the opposite sense
to the environmental dependence of the formation epoch
in hierarchical models Kaumann et al 1993 Baugh et al
1996 Diaferio et al 2001 In these models the assembly of
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
an early-type galaxy and the formation of its stars occurs
at an earlier epoch in a region of high overdensity than in
the eld The degree of luminosity evolution between z1
and z0 is predicted therefore to be higher in early-type
eld galaxies than in massive clusters since z1 is closer to
their epoch of formation If the high redshift measurements
are not in error they can be checked via spectroscopic sam-
ples then more detailed studies will be required to separate
the K-band evolution of galaxies of dierent spectral types
since the cluster and eld samples contain a dierent mix of
galaxies and thus a dierent mix of star formation histories
Note that although there is a strong case that the ob-
served evolution in K  may be attributed almost entirely to
passive evolutionary processes the interpretation of this re-
sult as being due to a redshift of formation zf  15  2
is less secure The models used are for a single burst of
star-formation for a stellar population with a Salpeter ini-
tial mass function having a solar metallicity Age-redshift
relations are calculated for an assumed at cosmology with
H0  70km s1 Mpc1 and M  03 and   07 All
of these assumptions aect the resultant redshift of forma-
tion and so there is clearly some slack in the interpretation
of the evolution For example if the models if gure 6 are
normalised to the high LX point at z  02 rather than
Coma the data are more consistent with zf  25 Future
work based on the colours and morphologies of the member
galaxies will provide stronger constraints on the epoch of
formation
The evolution of BCGs is consistent with that found by
Brough et al 2002 for high LX clusters Figure 12 exhibits
a degree of scatter in the evolution of BCGs at high redshift
with some BCGs being consistent with no-evolution pre-
dictions of which ClJ0152 is an example and others being
consistent with passive evolution This can be interpreted as
showing that some BCGs are fully formed at high redshift
eg ClJ1226 whereas others would need to undergo merging
between z  1 and the present to reconcile them with local
This is supported by the ratios of K band light in the
BCGs to total cluster light The ratio in Coma is not larger
than the ratio in the high redshift clusters Thus excess
brightening of the BCGs with time relative to the other
cluster galaxies as would be expected from such processes
as cannibalism is not observed suggesting that the BCGs
at least of ClJ1226 and ClJ1415 are already fully formed
