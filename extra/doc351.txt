Abstract
Early-type galaxies from CfA catalogue were assotiated with IRAS
FSC sources
In given sample IR and optical properties were used to
obtain some classication of these objects The existance of signicant
classes can be evidence of presence one main type of the dust in each
galaxy Physical interpretation of obtained classes was discussed The
dust mass in two classes of galaxies can be calculated using evolution
modelling In this case we can obtain a estimations for chemical compo-
sition and initial mass function in these galaxies
Introduction
The availability of an enormous amount of infrared data obtained in the IRAS
experiment makes it possible to analyze statistical properties of samples of vari-
ous celestial objects including those in which the components of IR emission are
expected to be fairly weak In particular galaxies of early morphological types
E and S0 may be placed into the latter category Although the rst release of
the IRAS Point Source Catalog contained only a small number of such galaxies
the application of additional processing techniques allowed the formation of a
large sample of such objects and the investigation of statictical properties of
various galaxy physical parameters obtained both from IR data and from data
derived in other spectral regions Knapp et al 1 Bally  Thronson 2 The
release of the next catalog of IR sources Faint Source catalogue v2 FSC-2
Moshir et al 3 justies the studies of general sample properties of early-type
galaxies associated with the sources of this catalog These studies are also use-
ful because the objects in the IRAS Point Source Catalog PSC and FSC-2
Catalog are subject to various selection eects and may exhibit various physical
properties In this work such an investigation was performed using objects from
the CfA catalog Huhra 4 which has associations in the FCS-2 catalog For
the derived sample the objects were classied by means of the cluster analysis
and physical interpretation of the obtained classes was made
2 Data and data handling
To analyze possible associations with Faint Source Catalog the largest available
catalog of galaxies - CfA catalog - was used which containes 38909 objects
morphological type is given for 17008 objects 4596 objects from them are early-
type galaxies catalogs type t  0 To apply the identication procedure
the following selection criteria were used for objects the separation between
the objects in the CfA and FSC-2 catalogs was within 60 arcsec the object
showed a statistically signicant ux parameter F QU AL  2 in one of the
far-IR bands 60 or 100 m there was no associations for the source in FSC-2
catalog with other closer objects from catalogs of other objects The applied
procedure resulted in a sample of 539 galaxies which was used in the subsequent
analysis 11 galaxies from this list had no previous associations with IR sources
A group of galaxies with statistically signicant IR measurements in at least
three IRAS bands and with measured apparent magnitudes in Johnsons UBV
system as well as with known redshifts was selected from the general sample
These data were available for 166 E and S0 galaxies Such selection is required
to classify objects by at least three parameters As it is desirable that the
selected parameters were independent of the galaxy distance the ux ratios at
25 60 100 m and in the B band f25f60 f100f60 fBf60 were used for
the classication
Hierarchical clustering algorithm involving a sequential agglomeration of
objects or a group of objects clusters using a criterion of any kind was ap-
plied for object classication After the agglomeration of objects into a single
cluster the maximum number of statistically signicant clusters is determined
using a criterion of any kind a set of criteria In this case a software program
of hierarchical cluster analysis taken from the STATLIB library compiled by
Murtagh 5 minimal increase in residual mean square RMS in a cluster during
agglomeration Wards criterion was used as a criterion for cluster agglomera-
tion this leads to breaking the hyperspherical form in classication parameter
space into clusters To estimate the signicance of breaking into clusters a
semi-empirical criterion was applied based on an analysis of the dissimilarity
- number of cluster relationship Mojena  Wishart 6 according to this
criterion the agglomeration must stop when the growth rate of RMS increases
during cluster agglomeration The requirement that the separation between
clusters be larger than RMS within each cluster was used as an additional cri-
terion The application of both these criteria resulted in breaking the sample
into four clusters object classes which were subsequently subject to further
analysis
3 Results of Data Processing
To analyze the derived classes of galaxies some additional physical parameters
for each sample object were calculated including the dust distribution in tem-
perature dust masses and the contribution of IR emission to overall emission
from galaxies The limited number of photometric bands require a simple dust
model to describe the observational IR photometry
I  B cid0Tdustcid1
where     is the optical depth and B cid0Tdustcid1 - the Plank function Unfor-
tunately this approximation can not give meaningful results for a large number
of galaxies in the sample As a consequence we have to use a multicomponent
dust model
 B cid16T i
dustcid17
A two-component n  2 model of dust was employed to evaluate the tempera-
ture distribution As three measurements are not enough to determine the com-
plete set of parameters for such a model the spectral index  in the dependence
of absorption coecient on the frequency and the temperature of one of the
component T 1
 28K were xed parameters As a result of the modelling
the temperature of the hot component as well as the hot- to-cold compo-
nent ratio was calculated The hot component with temperature T 2
is present virtually in all galaxies its contribution to overall emission being in
the range from 1 to 60 The mass of dust as in the paper by Greenhouse
et al 7 was calculated from the emission in a wavelength interval of 25 to 300
m taking into account the two-component model of dust Statistical data on
classication parameters lgfBf60 lgf25f60 lgf100f60 and additional
physical parameters quoted above T 2
 lgMdust the contribution of hot
component to overall emission  as well as the redshift z and morphological type
t were obtained for each selected class of galaxies and are given in Table 1

To interpret some physical properties of galaxies of various types the avail-
able observations revealing traces of interaction possible associations with ob-
jects from Vorontsov-Velaminovs catalod of interacting galaxies traces of an
active nucleus possible associations with objects from Verons catalog and the
presence of radio emission were collected As a result of the comparison of the
above signs the following interpretation may be provided for the division of
early-type galaxy sample into classes
 Class 1 Galaxies with high abundance of moderate-temperature dust
this class includes all interacting galaxies galaxies with giant HII zones
and a number of sources emitting in a high-frequency radio range the
above signs imply outbreaks of star formation in this class of galaxies and
the existence of UV photons - the main source of dust heating
 Class 2 Diers from the previous class by a considerably lower dust abun-
dance and by a minimum number of peculiar properties there are weak
traces of nuclear activity in a number of cases this class appears to in-
clude normal ellipticals
 Class 3 Contains mainly galaxies with active nuclei high-temperature
dust when the amount of optical emission reradiated in infrared
small galaxies with synchrotron radio sources The dust properties being
close to IR properties of galaxies implies that the dust surrounding the
nucleus is the main contributor of IR emission in this class of galaxies
 Class 4 This class of objects has the same properties as class-2 galaxies
except that their dust is warmer To establish the nature of the additional
dust-heating source for this class of galaxies a more thorough investiga-
tion of their observed properties in a variety of spectral regions may be
required Another explanation can be oered if we assume that the spec-
tral index  in the dust model is large Since  is determined by the size
distribution of dust grains the distruction of large dust particles takes
place in these objects The negative corelation between the temperature
and mass of the dust favors the second explanation
4 Dust and history of galaxies
As a result previous consideration we can see that a set of galaxies without
signicant star formation nuclear activity and interaction can be selected using
by clustering methods For these objects we can suggest late-type stars in each
galaxy as ultimate source of interstellar dust in this galaxy It provide us to
write relations between stellar evolution and dust mass in a galaxy
galactic mass is generated mainly in atmospheres of late stars dust mass can
be estimated as
Mdust  Z tdust Mgas
where Z is the content of dust in the stellar wind depend on chemical compo-
sition Z tdust  lifetime of dust grains Mgas - stellar mass loss rates determined
 Z Mmax
MM
MdM
where Mgal is total galactic mass Mmin Mmax are minimal and maximal stellar
  stellar mass function Since Z and MM can
masses and M  M
be obtained from stellar models dust mass obtained from IR-observations can
be useful tool to estimate the chemical composition and stellar mass function
in the galaxies
5 Conclusions
1 It is possible to obtain statistically signicant groups of galaxies on the
basis of IRAS photometry This fact can be considered as evidence of the
existence of one main type of dust in each galaxy
2 The derived classes of galaxies can be interpreted as - galaxies with active
star formation class 1 - galaxies with strong nuclear activity class 3
- normal ES0 galaxies class 2 - galaxies with large index in the size
distribution of grains class 4
3 Many galaxies show appreciable up to 80 of the overall dust mass
amount of hot Tdust  60K dust
4 For galaxies from classes 2 and 4 we have an opportunity to estimate the
chemical composition and initial mass function from the dust mass
