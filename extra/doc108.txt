Abstract We present recent results on the evolution of the colour-magnitude
relation and of the star formation activity in galaxy clusters since z  08
Results are based on the ESO Distant Cluster Survey EDisCS - an ESO large
programme aimed at the study of cluster structure and cluster galaxy evolution
over a signicant fraction of cosmic time - and are discussed in the framework
of the current standard paradigm of structure formation
Introduction
Galaxy clusters are commonly considered as good laboratories for studying the
physical processes that drive galaxy evolution This foremost role is primarily
due to the practical advantage of having many galaxies all approximately at
the same redshift in a relatively small region of the sky so that ecient ob-
servations can be carried out even with modest elds of view and with limited
amounts of telescope time Within our current standard paradigm for structure
formation galaxy clusters represent however biased environments originating
from the highest and rarest peaks in the primordial density eld whose evo-
lution appears to be more rapid and perhaps more violent than in regions of the
Universe with average density see discussion in De Lucia 2007
The instrumental capabilities achieved in recent years and the completion
of modern large photometric and spectroscopic surveys have provided a rapidly
growing database of highredshift clusters and widened the mass range of the
examined systems It is now becoming evident that the physical properties of
cluster galaxies depend not only on redshift but also on cluster mass and that
this dependency needs to be taken into account for a correct interpretation of
observational data in terms of evolution In this framework the EDisCS cluster
sample represents an ideal dataset
EDisCS provides homogeneous photometry and spectroscopy for 20 elds
containing galaxy clusters from z  04 to z  08 Cluster candidates were
selected from the Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey Gonzalez et al 2001
by identifying positive surface brightness uctuations in the background sky
The parent EDisCS sample was constructed by selecting 30 from the high-
est surface brightness candidates and conrming the presence of an apparent
cluster and of a possible red-sequence with shallow VLT exposures in two l-

At the time of writing all phases of the programme have been completed
and most of the data have been made publicly available1 A rst basic charac-
terisation of our sample is presented in White et al 2005 and shows that the
EDisCS sample covers a wide range of masses and structural properties Fig 1
shows that the EDisCS clusters have velocity dispersions that are generally lower
than those of other well studied clusters at similar redshift They ll quite nicely
the redshift gap between the MORPHS and the ACS GTO clusters which are the
only two large high-redshift cluster samples studied in similar details Perhaps
more interestingly Fig 1 shows that the EDisCS sample spans the appropriate
range of cluster velocity dispersions for comparison with local samples
In this review we summarise the results of two studies based on EDisCS
data and related to the evolution of the star formation activity Sec 2 and of
the colour-magnitude relation Sec 3

Figure 2
From Poggianti et al 2006 The Oii -  relation in clusters
at 04  z  08 left panel and for low redshift clusters from SDSS right
panel On the left panel solid black dots represent the EDisCS clusters and
red symbols corresponds to literature data for clusters at similar redshift The
solid line in both panels and the dotted lines in the right panel represent a
by-eye description of the upper envelope of the high redshift data and of the
most populated regions for the low redshift data
In the following we will assume a CDM cosmology m  03   07
and H0  70 km s1 Mpc1 With this cosmology z  08 - the highest redshift
probed by the EDisCS sample - corresponds to more that 50 per cent of the
look-back time to the Big Bang All magnitudes used in the following are Vega
magnitudes
2 The star formation activity
Fig 2 shows the fraction of galaxies with Oii emission as a function of the
cluster velocity dispersion for clusters in the redshift range 04  08 in the left
panel and for a sample of low-redshift clusters from the SDSS in the right panel
All galaxies with an EW of Oii  3 A and within the cluster virial radius R200
are considered for details see Poggianti et al 2006 The error bars are large
and there is a large scatter for clusters with similar velocity dispersion The
general trend however is of a broad anti-correlation for high redshift clusters
where data indicate the presence of an envelope in the sense that more massive
clusters have at most a certain fraction of star forming galaxies Interestingly the
trend is not visible when considering only the most massive systems For clusters
at low redshift the fraction of star forming galaxies is approximately constant
for systems with velocity dispersion larger than  500 kms1 and shows a very
large scatter for systems with lower velocity dispersion

From Poggianti et al 2006 The solid lines in both panels
correspond to the solid and dashed lines in Fig 2 In both panels symbols
represent simulated haloes from the Millennium Simulation while dashed lines
are predictions obtained using the extended Press-Schechter formalism see
original paper for details
In order to investigate a possible connection between the observed trends
and the growth history of cosmic structures we used two dierent approaches
i the extended Press  Schechter formalism was used to estimate the fraction
of nal mass that resides in haloes of dierent mass at earlier times ii semi-
analytic techniques coupled to N -body simulations were used to estimate the
number of galaxies in haloes of dierent mass at higher redshifts The results of
this analysis are shown in Fig 3 The gure shows that the fraction of passive2
galaxies at high-z is largely determined by the fraction of massgalaxies that
were already in haloes with mass  3  1012 M at z  25 left panel The
fraction of passive galaxies in low-z clusters is in nice agreement with the fraction
of massgalaxies in haloes with mass  1  1014 M at z  028 right panel
The redshift z  028 corresponds to a lookback time of  3 Gyr This
time-interval can be considered a reasonable upper limit for the time required
to extinguish star formation in newly accreted galaxies by taking into account
the time-scales associated to various physical processes that might lead to a
suppression of the star formation activity and the spectro-photometric timescale
for the evolution of the Oii signature The trends shown in Fig 2 are therefore
consistent with a scenario where today cluster passive galaxies consist of two
dierent populations
primordial passive galaxies whose stars formed at z 
25 and quenched passive galaxies whose star formation has been suppressed
at later times possibly by physical processes at play in dense environments
2Here we consider passive all galaxies with no Oii emission The fraction of passive galaxies
is therefore 1  fOii where fOii is the fraction of star forming galaxies shown in Fig 2

From De Lucia et al 2007 The rst three panels show the
number of red-sequence galaxies as a function of magnitude The bottom-
right panel shows the evolution of the luminous-to-faint ratio as a function
of redshift see text Dierent colours correspond to dierent criteria for
cluster membership red for a method based on statistical subtraction and
black for a photometric redshift selection Dierent symbols in the bottom
right panels correspond to dierent choices for the area used for the analysis
see original paper for details
3 The colour-magnitude relation
The rst three panels of Fig 4 show the number of red-sequence galaxies as a
function of their I-band magnitude For the histograms shown in Fig 4 we have
used all cluster members within 03 mag from the best t colour-magnitude rela-
tion determined using spectroscopically conrmed members with absorption line
spectra Clusters have been combined in three redshift bins correcting colours
and magnitudes to the central redshift of the corresponding bin Corrections are
based on a single burst model with formation redshift zf  3 and a metallicity-
dependent normalisation3 We have shown that this simple model provides a
good t to the observed red-sequence over all the redshift range sampled by the
EDisCS clusters as well as for the Coma cluster and for a local cluster sample
from the SDSS
Black and red histograms in Fig 4 correspond to dierent criteria for cluster
membership The scale on the top of each panel shows the rest-frame V-band
magnitude corresponding to the observed I-band magnitude after correcting for
3As explained in the original papers the relation between the metallicity and luminosity has
been calibrated so as to reproduce the metallicity-luminosity relation observed for the Coma
cluster

Lucia et al 2004 and De Lucia et al 2007 By dening as luminous all galaxies
brighter than MV  20 and as faint all galaxies fainter than this limit and
brighter than MV  182 we nd a clear trend for a decreasing luminous-to-
faint ratio as a function of redshift The trend is conrmed independently of
the method used to select cluster members and of the area used for the analysis
bottom-right panel of Fig 4
The trend of Fig 4 can be reproduced by simple evolution of the combined
blue and red galaxies that populate the colour-magnitude diagram of our high-
redshift clusters This is shown explicitly in Fig 5 The average behaviour of
the EDisCS data is shown with black circles while the blue and red symbols
connected by arrows represent the evolution predicted by simple models obtained
evolving all galaxies at earlier redshifts Red arrows correspond to a model where
the star formation histories of the galaxies under consideration are truncated at
the redshift of the observation of each cluster while blue arrows correspond to
a model where the star formation histories are suppressed 1 Gyr later than the
redshift of observation see original paper for details The red lled circles in
Fig 5 show predictions from the semi-analytic model described in De Lucia 
Blaizot 2007
Evolution in galaxy clusters since z  08
Fig 5 shows that both the truncation and the delayed model predict an
amount of evolution from the highest redshift considered to z  0 that is in good
agreement with that measured using the highest redshift EDisCS clusters and the
Coma cluster green diamond In the truncation model galaxies move onto the
red-sequence very rapidly and the predicted luminous-to-faint ratio lies below
the measured value in the intermediate redshift bins
In the delayed model
galaxies stay blue longer and the predicted evolution is closer to the observed
trend at all redshifts sampled by the EDisCS clusters The local sample of SDSS
clusters used in our analysis lies above the value measured for the Coma cluster
with luminous-to-faint ratios compatible with those measured for the EDisCS
clusters at z  04 The zero-point of the colour-magnitude relation predicted
by our semi-analytic model shows the same level of evolution measured from the
data and the luminous-to-faint ratio measured for simulated clusters at z  0 is
in very nice agreement with that measured for Coma The predicted evolution
as a function of redshift is however weaker than observed This indicates that
in these models the transition from blue to red occurs on a time-scale which is
shorter than observed see also Wang et al 2007 and discussion in De Lucia
4 Discussion and Conclusions
In this review we have summarised the results of recent work studying the
evolution of the star formation activity and of the colour-magnitude relation in
galaxy clusters since z  08 Our dataset is based on systems with a wide range
of velocity dispersion from the EDisCS sample which we have complemented
with other clusters at similar redshift from the literature and with a local cluster
sample from the SDSS The complementarity between the EDisCS sample and
other well studied systems at similar redshift has revealed an important element
to better quantify evolution as a function of redshift and of cluster mass4
Using the presence of the Oii line in emission as a signature of ongoing
star formation we have demonstrated that the fraction of star forming galaxies
varies as a function cluster velocity dispersion and that this dependency changes
as a function of redshift Interestingly our results can be explained by linking
the passive systems with the massnumber of objects that have experienced
dierent environments at earlier times The model proposed is quite simple and
it does not provide useful insight on the physical processes responsible for the
suppression of the star formation in cluster galaxies It is however suggestive
that a simple model based on structure formation is able to explain quantita-
tively the evolution measured from our data
In fact structure formation is
an important - and often neglected - element to be taken into account when
interpreting observational data in terms of evolution
Our study on the evolution of the colour-magnitude relation has demon-
strated that there is signicant evolution in the luminosity distribution of red-
sequence galaxies Compared to clusters in the local Universe the EDisCS
4In the studies summarised here we have used the cluster velocity dispersion as a proxy for the
mass of the system
De Lucia  Poggianti
clusters exhibit a signicant decit of faint red galaxies Our results clearly
indicate that the redsequence population of highredshift clusters does not
contain all progenitors of nearby redsequence cluster galaxies A signicant
fraction of these must have moved onto the redsequence below z  08 We
have shown that the evolution in the relative distribution of luminous and
faint red-sequence galaxies can be explained by evolution of the blue bright
galaxies that populate the colour-magnitude diagram of high redshift clusters
The model used is extremely simplied eg it assumes a single redshift of forma-
tion it neglects the accretion of new galaxies and results should be interpreted
with caution A semi-analytic model coupled with high-resolution N -body sim-
ulations predicts a much smaller evolution than observed and we have argued
that this is due to a too rapid decline of the star formation of galaxies accreted
onto larger systems
Future studies comparing in detail results like those presented here with pre-
dictions from semi-analytic models coupled to high-resolution simulations will
provide important constraints on galaxy formation models and on the physical
processes governing evolution of galaxies in clusters
