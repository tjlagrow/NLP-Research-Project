Abstract
pseudo-bulges close to disk properties Sersic index rotation fraction aten-
ning to classical de Vaucouleurs bulges close to elliptical galaxies Secular
evolution and bar development can give rise to pseudo-bulges To ensure pro-
longed secular evolution gas ows are required along the galaxy life-time There
is growing evidence for cold gas accretion around spiral galaxies This can ex-
plain the bar cycle of destruction and reformation together with pseudo-bulge
formation However bulges can also be formed through major mergers minor
mergers and massive clumps early in the galaxy evolution Bulge formation is
so ecient that it is dicult to explain the presence of bulgeless galaxies today
1 Secular evolution and bulges gas ows
There are excellent recent reviews on secular evolution Kormendy  Kennicutt
2004 Jogee 2006 and in particular the formation of bulges has been debated
in detail last year in Oxford with the IAU Symposium 245 on Formation and
Evolution of Bulges Only more recent work will then be reviewed here
A clear distinction is now well established between classical bulges and
pseudo-bulges from the luminosity distribution Sersic index attening color
and the kinematics On the color-magnitude diagram the pseudo-bulges similar
in properties to disks are clearly on the blue cloud while the classical bulges
sit on the red sequence Drory  Fisher 2007 There is a clear bimodality in
Sersic index with the pseudo-bulge peak at n1-2 and the classical bulge peak
at n4 Fisher  Drory 2008
Gaseous haloes around galaxies
The secular evolution is fueled by external gas accretion and there is now
growing evidence of gas infalling on nearby spiral galaxies although this gas is
quite diuse One of the best example is the edge-on galaxy NGC891 Fraternali
et al 2007 HI gas is observed up to 20kpc above the plane with its rotation
decreasing with the altitude Part of this gas could come from galactic fountain
but not all since the angular momentum should then be conserved Moreover
modelisation of the fountain eect predicts gas outow cf the non edge-on
galaxy NGC 2403 while mostly inow is observed like for high velocity clouds
in the Milky Way Gaseous haloes require accretion of external gas Fraternali
 Binney 2006
A recent review by Sancisi et al 2008 gathers many examples of extra-
planar gas Part of it is due to dwarf companions or tidal streams but evidence
is mounting for extragalactic inow of gas due to cosmic accretion This external

top and with accretion bottom The Sb model is the maximum disk
model Combes 2008 the gas accretion rate is 5 Myr and the snapshot
corresponds to T8 Gyr Note that a bar is maintained only in the case of
gas accretion
gas inow produces lopsideness and fuels star formation When the angular
momentum of the accreted gas is close to perpendicular to that of the galaxy
polar rings can form The simulation of this phenomenon by Brooks et al 2008
reveals how successively star formation is occuring in the inner equatorial disk
then in the outer polar disk After 15 Gyr the interaction between the two
disks destroys the polar ring The velocity curve is about the same in both
equatorial and polar planes
Relative role of gas accretion and mergers
In the standard hierarchical scenario galaxies are thought to assemble their
mass essentially through mergers However the gas accretion from cosmic la-
ments has been under-estimated Analysis of a cosmological simulation with gas
and star formation shows that most of the starbursts are due to smooth ows
Dekel et al 2008 Corresponding inow rates are sucient to assemble galaxy
mass 10-100 Myr
2 Bar destruction re-formation role of gas
It is now well established that bar redistribution of mass and the vertical reso-
nance can buiid secularly pseudo-bulges eg Combes et al 1990 However in
a gaseous disk not dominated by dark matter the bar can quickly weaken and

even be destroyed cf Figure 1 With only 2 of the mass gas infall is enough
to transform a bar in a lens Friedli 1994 Berentzen et al 1998 Bournaud 
Combes 2002 Bournaud et al 2005 To pursue bulge formation and explain
the large frequency of bars external gas accretion has to be invoked in a self-
regulated cycle
in a rst phase a bar forms through gravitational instability
in a cold disk The bar produces gas inow which itself weakens or destroys
the bar through angular momentum transfer to the bar Then external gas
accretion can replenish the disk to turn back to the rst phase
Figure 2 illustrates such cycles for dierent galaxy models giant disks
with dierent dark matter fractions and dierent dark matter concentrations
Combes 2008 Although gas is provided at a constant inow rate in the outer
parts of the disks it enters the galaxy disk by intermittence and produces
starbursts Indeed while the bar is strong positive torques between corotation
and OLR conne the gas outside OLR Only when the bar weakens the gas can
replenish the disk to make it unstable again to bar formation Through these
cycles the pseudo-bulge can form as shown in Figure 3

Formation in a cosmological context
In cosmological simulations it is possible to take into account cosmic gas
accretion more realistically When spatial resolution is sucient it is possible
to see bars form destroy and reform Heller et al 2007
There is clearly in all these processes the inuence of the adopted gas
physics bar formation is more easy with isothermal gas while adiabatic gas
heats and prevents disk instability Star formation and feedback are then im-
portant keys to regulate the dynamics
Angular momentum transfer with dark matter haloes
In presence of a massive dark halo the angular momentum transfer is es-
sentially towards the dark component which helps to reform the bar However
the bar destroys more quickly in presence of gas Berentzen et al 2007 The
weakening of the bar is then interpreted as due to the central mass concentration
provided by the gas It cannot be due to the vertical resonance which is also
weakened or suppressed in presence of large quantities of gas
3 Bar and bulge statistics and high z evolution
The frequency of bars has been quantied on many samples and in particular
in the near infrared where bars are easier to dene eg the OSU NIR sample
Eskrige et al 2002
In all samples the main result is the paucity of weak
bars Marinova  Jogee 2007 Whatever the tool to measure bar strength the
number of strong bars is high at z0 Whyte et al 2002 Block et al 2002 Buta
et al 2004
Bar frequency with redshift
If at z0 about 23 of galaxies are barred with at least 30 strongly barred
the strong bars ellipticity higher than 04 in the optical remain about 30 at
redshift between 02 and 1 Jogee et al 2004 At high z however results are
more uncertain because of the K-correction and the lack of spatial resolution

after 1250 Myr Left is the stellar density middle the gas density contours
and right the gas velocity eld where the wedge indicate the amplitude of the
projected velocity in units of 100kms Not all mergers end up in an elliptical
galaxy but a signicant pseudo-bulge is formed Crocker et al 2008
preventing to detect small bars From a recent study of the COSMOS eld
the bar fraction is found to decrease at high z Sheth et al 2008 This is easy
to interprete in terms of gas fraction galaxy disks are more gas rich at high
redshifts and the gas inow is destroying bars The time spent in a barred
phase is then expected to be smaller for galaxies at z  1
BT and n statistics
The bulge-to-total luminosity ratio BT and the Sersic index n have been
studied by several groups in near-infrared samples A clear decrease of BT
and n has been found with the Hubble type whatever the barred or unbarred
character Laurikainen et al 2007 In the OSU sample of 146 bright spirals in
H-band where 23 of galaxies are barred 60 have n  2 and BT  02
barred or not Weinzirl Jogee Khochfar et al 2008 There is in addition a
clear correlation between BT and n
This large observed fraction of low bulge galaxies is a constraint for models
In CDM a BT02 galaxy requires no merger since 10 Gyr or last merger
before z  2 The predicted fraction of these low-bulge bright spiral is 15 times
lower than observed Weinzirl et al 2008 Most of these low-bulge bright spirals
must be explained either by rare minor mergers or secular evolution without
mergers With semi-analytical criteria Koda et al 2007 propose a solution in
terms of the tail of the distribution
Frequency of bulge-less galaxies
Locally about 23 or the bright spirals are bulgeless or with a low-bulge
Kormendy  Fisher 2008 Weinzirl et al 2008 Some of the remaining have
both a classical bulge and a pseudo-bulge plus nuclear clusters Boker et al
From the observed frequency of edge-on superthin galaxies Kautsch et al
2006 estimate that 13 of galaxies are completely bulgeless
In the SDSS
sample 20 of bright spirals are bulgeless until z003 Barazza et al 2008
Disk-dominated galaxies are more barred than bulge-dominated ones How can
this be reconciled with the hierarchical scenario

4 Mergers and bulge formation scenarios
We can rst remark that major mergers do not always lead to spheroids or
classical bulges but sometimes also to pseudo-bulges An extreme example
is shown in Figure 4 the result of an equal mass merger to reproduce the
NGC 4550 system This simulation is run with one disk prograde with respect
to the relative orbit and one disk retrograde which leads to counter-rotation
eg Di Matteo et al 2007 In this system the gas eventually settles in the
prograde sense in corotation with the prograde stellar disk which is also the
most perturbed in the interaction thus ends up as a thicker disk The angular
momentum exchange between stars gas and the orbit can be seen in Figure 5
Crocker et al 2008 This major merger forms a bulge with low n  1  2 This
must also be the case for similar encounter geometries ie
for almost aligned
or anti-aligned spins
Scenarios of bulge formation
Although four dierent processes have been identied to form bulges major
mergers minor mergers bars and clumpy young galaxies it is usually not easy
to separate them in each galaxy since they can occur successively
In major mergers the tidal trigger rst forms strong bars in the partner
galaxies which drive the gas inward this forms rst a pseudobulge in each
galaxy Then the merger of the two galaxies could provide a classical bulge
according to the encounter geometry which will co-exist with the pseudo ones
Alternatively after a classical bulge has formed in a system subsequent
gas accretion could re-form a disk and a bar which drives the gas towards the
center and form a pseudobulge
It is likely that most galaxy disks begin gas-rich without central concentra-
tion without bulge and therefore are highly unstable to form clumpy galaxies
at high z Simulations show that there is rapid formation of an exponential disk
and a bulge through dynamical friction Noguchi 1999 Bournaud et al 2007b
The evolution is slightly quicker than with spirals and bars The rapid bulge
formation is again a problem for the bulgeless galaxies today
Clues from high z galaxies
Secular evolution and the assembly of bulges
Spheroids appear in place quite early Conselice 2007 There is a decit of
disk galaxies at z1 Could it be a bias of the observations with limited sensitiv-
ity Or disky galaxies have formed only recently and in poor environment Big
disks in rotation are however observed Genzel et al 2008 Neichel et al 2008
Massive bulges BT 02 and ellipticals have the same early formation
as shown by the GOODS study of 01 z 12 galaxies MacArthur et al 2008
Their star formation history SFH is compatible with a single early burst There
is however a degeneracy the same SFH can be obtained if the mass is assembled
more recently from dry mergers
Multiple minor mergers
The bulges formed by minor mergers are often the same as for major merg-
ers since they are more numerous The issue is not the mass ratio of individual
mergers but the total mass accreted As soon as a given spiral galaxy has ac-
creted 30-40 of its initial mass either in one event or a series of small minor
mergers then the nal result is likely to be an elliptical galaxy Bournaud et al
2007a have shown through simulations that 50 mergers of 501 mass ratio can
easily form an elliptical and this is certainly more frequent than a 11 merger
5 Conclusion
Secular evolution and bars play a major role in pseudo-bulge formation and this
explains their presence in the blue sequence of galaxies Since gas inow weakens
or destroy the bar a galaxy can have several bar episodes and each accumu-
lates mass in the pseudo-bulge Cold gas accretion from cosmic laments can
replenish galaxy disks and reform bars It is expected that bars were destroyed
more frequently at high z since galaxy disks contained more gas This is in line
with the observation of decreasing bar fraction at high z
There are several scenarios for bulge formation classical bulges through
major mergers but also a succession of minor mergers clumps in young galaxies
coalescing in the center due to dynamical friction bars In most galaxies there
is coexistence of many processes and it is not easy to reconstruct the dynamical
history of the bulge assembly In any case it is quite easy to form a bulge in any
galaxy environment and it is a surprise to observe a large fraction of bulgeless
galaxies
It is a challenge both for the hierarchical scenario but also for the
secular evolution It is dicult in particular to nd high-z precursors of these
bulgeless galaxies Have those disks formed recently
