ABSTRACT
We combine photometry and lens modeling to study the properties of 17
gravitational lens galaxies between z  01 and 1 Most of the lens galaxies
are passively evolving early-type galaxies with a few spirals The colors scale
lengths and ellipticities of lens galaxies are similar to those of the general
population of early-type galaxies although there may be a decit of apparently
round lens galaxies produced by the inclination dependence of lensing cross
sections The projected mass distributions are aligned with the projected
light distributions to 10 except in the presence of a strong external tidal
perturbation suggesting that dark matter halos have orbits that are signicantly
modied by interactions with the baryonic component and are not far out of
alignment with the stars Lens galaxies obey image separationlens luminosity
correlations analogous to the Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher relations which
are consistent with standard dark matter lens models The lens galaxy
mass-to-light ratios decrease with redshift as dlog MLBdz  03  01
05  01 for 0  1 01 thus providing direct evidence of passive
evolution for a sample of early-type galaxies in low-density environments The
evolution-corrected mass-to-light ratios are generally larger than predicted by
constant ML dynamical models although there is signicant scatter with
improved photometry lens galaxy mass-to-light ratios would better distinguish
between constant ML and dark matter models These conclusions are limited
primarily by the quality of lens galaxy photometry

Introduction
Although knowledge of the distribution of galaxies in color luminosity structure
and redshift is growing rapidly eg Griths et al 1994 Lilly et al 1995 Schade et
al 1995 Lin et al 1996 1997 Ellis 1997 there is still little direct information on the
masses of intermediate-redshift galaxies As a result most physical inferences about galaxy
populations above z  01 such as evolution rates remain critically dependent on modeling
the relations between a galaxys luminosity and its stellar or total mass For nearby galaxies
masses can be estimated by combining a dynamical model with well-dened correlations
between luminosities scale lengths and velocities such as the Faber-Jackson Faber 
Jackson 1976 and Tully-Fisher Tully  Fisher 1977 relations and the fundamental plane
of elliptical galaxies eg Djorgovski  Davis 1987 Dressler et al 1987 These relations
have recently been extended to z  05 to study galaxy evolution eg van Dokkum  Franx
1996 Kelson et al 1997 but the observations are dicult because of the need for spectra
with high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio Other studies both spectroscopic eg
Bender Ziegler  Bruzual 1996 and photometric eg Pahre Djorgovski  de Carvalho
1996 Schade et al 1996 1997 Stanford Eisenhardt  Dickinson 1997 have also found
evidence for galaxy evolution out to z  1 All these results apply only to ensembles of
galaxies that are in high-density cluster environments where evolution may or may not be
typical see Stanford et al 1997
There is however one population of galaxies whose masses can be determined
individually with high precision at any redshift and which are found in a wide range of
environments  gravitational lens galaxies The mass enclosed by the images of a four-image
lens is determined in a model-independent way with an internal uncertainty of only a
few percent eg Kochanek 1991a Wambsganss  Paczynski 1994 The full range of
cosmological models plausible external perturbations due to nearby objects eg Keeton
Kochanek  Seljak 1997 and large-scale structure eg Bar-Kana 1996 Wambsganss et
al 1997 can change the masses by 20 Such precision is better than that achieved
by dynamical studies of individual nearby galaxies and far exceeds the precision possible
for galaxies at intermediate redshifts using dynamical methods Hence measuring masses
via lensing allows us to replace dicult measurements and analyses of high-precision
dynamical observations with simpler observations of source and lens redshifts and lens
galaxy photometry making it much easier to study physical properties such as the evolution
of mass-to-light ratios
Lensing also oers a way to directly probe the mass distributions of distant galaxies
and to compare them with their light distributions Lens models and statistics eg Maoz
 Rix 1993 Kochanek 1995 1996a Grogin  Narayan 1996 suggest that lens galaxies are
 3 
not well described by constant mass-to-light ratio models and instead require dark roughly
isothermal halos in agreement with results from stellar dynamics and X-ray observations
eg Fabbiano 1989 Rix et al 1997 Lens models also suggest that the quadrupole shapes
of the mass and light distributions need not be the same see Keeton et al 1997 Jackson
Nair  Browne 1997 which is consistent with models of polar-ring galaxies and X-ray
galaxies indicating that dark halos can be signicantly atter than the light eg Sackett et
al 1994 Buote  Canizares 1994 1996 also see the review by Sackett 1996
We must bear in mind however that the lens galaxies are a biased sample of galaxies
First the lens galaxy sample preferentially selects massive galaxies because they are more
likely to lens background objects For example with an   1 Schechter 1976 luminosity
function dndL  LL1 expLL and a dark matter lens model for which the
lensing cross section scales as L eg Turner Ostriker  Gott 1984 the luminosity function
of lens galaxies is roughly dndL  expLL In other words the lensing cross section
lters the divergent by number population of low-luminosity galaxies out of the lens
galaxy sample The need to resolve the multiple images produced by a lens adds a further
bias against low-mass galaxies Taken together these mass biases mean that lens galaxies
are a poor probe of the faint blue galaxies responsible for many of the interpretation
problems in galaxy number count models eg Ellis 1997 The mass biases are also biases
for early-type galaxies over late-type galaxies because of their smaller masses spiral
galaxies are expected to account for only 1020 of gravitational lenses eg Turner et
al 1984 Fukugita  Turner 1991 Kochanek 1993a 1996a Maoz  Rix 1993 Keeton 
Kochanek 1997b
The average lens galaxy is expected to be atter than the average galaxy see
Kochanek 1996b King  Browne 1996 Keeton et al 1997 Jackson et al 1997 in part
because the eciency of attened galaxies as lenses is maximized when they are viewed
edge-on Kochanek 1996b Keeton  Kochanek 1997b Despite the inclination bias
the lens galaxy sample is not strongly biased to include intrinsically at galaxies because
inclination-averaged lensing cross sections are almost independent of the intrinsic axis ratio
Keeton  Kochanek 1997b Finally optically-selected samples are biased against dusty
eg Kochanek 1991b 1996a Tomita 1996 Falco Kochanek  Munoz 1997a Malhotra
Rhoads  Turner 1997 Perna Loeb  Bartelmann 1997 and bright Kochanek 1991b
1996a lens galaxies because of these two eects the lensed quasar sample is unlikely to
contain many examples of lensing by spiral galaxies Statistical models of radio-selected
lenses suggest that the optically-selected quasar lens samples may be only 5040
20 complete
Falco et al 1997a The radio-selected lenses should be a fair sample of galaxies by mass
except for the selection against low-mass galaxies created by the need to resolve the lensed
images

Our goal is to assemble a preliminary survey of the optical properties of gravitational
lens galaxies and to establish their utility as probes of the structure and evolution of
galaxies between z  01 and 1 Our results will be limited by the number of objects
available for study and by the heterogeneity and quality of the available surface photometry
Neither of these problems is fundamental and a determined observational program could
eliminate these restrictions In 2 we gather the available data and discuss their quality We
describe new surface photometry of Hubble Space Telescope images discuss photometric
corrections used to convert apparent magnitudes to rest-frame luminosities and present
lens models to characterize lens galaxy mass distributions In 3 we analyze the optical and
mass structures of lens galaxies the colors of lens galaxies the correlation between image
separation and lens luminosity and lens galaxy mass-to-light ratios and evolution In 4 we
present our conclusions
2 Lens Galaxy Data
There are now 30 known multiply-imaged gravitational lenses2 In some lenses the
sources are so bright that no lens galaxy has been seen eg the doubles 12081011 and
J0313 and the quad H 1413117 and in others we have no way to determine whether the
optical emission is due to the source or to the lens eg B 1938666 and PKS 1830211
There are however 21 lenses where the lens galaxy has been observed although the quality
of the data varies We have excluded the lens Q 22370305 Huchra et al 1985 which
consists of four images of a quasar produced by the bulge of a nearby z  004 spiral
galaxy because it is dicult to nd a luminosity estimate for the bulge that plays the
same role as aperture or total magnitudes for the other lens galaxies We also excluded the
lens MG 2016112 Lawrence et al 1984 because it seems to require two lens galaxies
at dierent redshifts and is not well understood see Nair  Garrett 1997 Finally
we neglected the lenses FSC 102144724 Eisenhardt et al 1996 and HE 11041805
Wisotski et al 1993 Courbin Lidman  Magain 1997a Thus we are left with 17 lens
galaxies whose optical properties we summarize in Tables 14 We are interested in the
lens geometries and redshifts Table 1 the lens galaxy structural parameters eective
radius ellipticity and position angle Table 2 as well as the lens galaxy color Table 2
total integrated magnitude Table 3 and magnitude inside the critical radius Table 4
Only a few lens galaxies have structural parameters reported in the literature More
have published photometry but because the dening aperture is usually unspecied it is

dicult to interpret the data Many of the lenses however have been observed with the
Hubble Space Telescope HST with these observations we were able to make a systematic
analysis of lens galaxy structural parameters and magnitudes We used our own HST
data together with data from the HST public archive see Table 2 for references For
the analysis we combined each set of cosmic-ray split images by standard procedures and
constructed a synthetic PSF with Tiny Tim v 43 Krist 1997 We then simultaneously
modeled the images as a combination of point sources or Gaussians for the lensed images
and elliptical de Vaucouleurs proles for the galaxies Each model was computed on a
three-times oversampled grid relative to the PSF which itself was modeled on a two-times
oversampled grid relative to the images The model was optimized to derive the structural
parameters of the lens galaxy which could then be used to compute total and aperture
magnitudes Note that we quote HST instrumental magnitudes rather than converting
them to standard lters such as BVRI Finally we used the full covariance matrix of
the model t to derive formal statistical uncertainties after rescaling the nominal 2 to be
unity per degree of freedom Our procedures are similar to those used by the Medium
Deep Survey eg Ratnatunga et al 1995 and for the two lenses found in the MDS survey
HST 125312914 and HST 141765226 we derive statistically compatible results We
use only de Vaucouleurs ts to the galaxies because isolated exponential disks failed to
provide comparably good ts and the complication of diskbulge models is unwarranted
at present Several of the galaxies require special discussion
 B 0218357 We could not robustly separate the quasar images from the galaxy in
the existing data We used the results from similar modeling by B McLeod 1997
private communication
 Q 0142100 and BRI 09520115 In each case the galaxy properties are sensitive to
the treatment of the bright quasar images that bracket the galaxy and the formal
statistical uncertainties underestimate the true systematic errors in the prole ts
A blind deconvolution is needed to construct an accurate model of the true PSF
simultaneously with the model of the image
 Q 0957561 The galaxy parameters are robust but as in Q 0142100 and
BRI 09520115 the model would benet from a blind deconvolution particularly to
determine the properties of the low surface brightness lensed features discovered by
Bernstein et al 1997
 MG 11310456 There appears to be a very low surface brightness optical ring
surrounding the lens galaxy An optical ring was suggested by Hammer et al 1991
but their detection is far too bright to match the HST images and must have been
created by an error in modeling the galaxy prole and the ground-based PSF
 6 
 B 1600434 Both the HST V and I images have little ux from the galaxy although
the mean structure is readily apparent if we subtract the lensed images and convolve
the residual image with a Gaussian to increase the visibility of the low surface
brightness galaxy There are two peaks to the extended emission one between the two
lensed images and one underneath the fainter radio image see Jackson et al 1997
The low signal-to-noise ratio and the complicated structure prevent any sensible
model parameter determinations The shape orientation and color were estimated
from aperture photometry
 B 1608656 In addition to the obvious extended lensed emission Jackson et al
1997 there appears to be a faint ring surrounding the entire galaxy particularly in
the I image Despite its faintness the emission strongly aects the prole ts and
a reliable determination of the properties of the lens galaxy will require using a lens
model to properly subtract the optical ring In addition the lens galaxy shows a
complicated structure that may indicate that the lensing mass comprises two galaxies
or a single galaxy cut by a dust lane Jackson et al 1997
 B 1933503 As with B 1600434 the rough appearance of the galaxy is readily
apparent after convolving the images with a Gaussian to enhance the low surface
brightness features However there is far too little ux from the galaxy to do more
than crudely estimate an ellipticity position angle and aperture magnitude
Where we could not robustly extract all the desired data we either made estimates and
enclosed them in parentheses in Tables 24 to ag them as systematically suspect or
omitted them altogether if we judged them too unreliable In most cases the eective
radius estimate and hence the total magnitude are the most uncertain quantities while the
ellipticity position angle color and aperture magnitude are relatively reliable
There are several corrections that should be applied to the magnitudes First Table 1
gives EB  V  values for Galactic extinction estimated from the survey of Stark et al
1992 The large foreground extinctions for several lens galaxies notably the radio-selected
lenses MG 04140534 B 0712472 and B 1933503 produce signicant color and
magnitude corrections that have not previously been taken into account We corrected
colors and magnitudes for Galactic extinction using extinction coecients computed with
RV  33 and the Cardelli Clayton  Mathis 1989 model for the extinction curve Note
however that Tables 24 give instrumental colors and magnitudes without extinction
corrections
Second as indicated by Tables 34 the existing observations use a very heterogeneous
set of lters Comparing the observations to one another and to studies of local galaxies
 7 
requires converting to a standard wavelength which can be done by applying photometric
corrections including color K and evolutionary corrections We computed the corrections
using the spectral evolution models of Bruzual  Charlot 1993 with the Kurucz 1979
model of Lyrae to dene the standard magnitude zero points Fukugita Shimasaku 
Ichikawa 1995 discuss the normalizations of a wide variety of photometric systems and
Holtzman et al 1995 discuss the normalization of the HSTWFPC2 photometric bands
We checked our results against those of Guiderdoni  Rocca-Volmerange 1987 1988 and
Poggianti 1997 both of which describe the standard technique
The photometric corrections introduce several systematic uncertainties into the
converted magnitudes 1 the choice of the galaxy evolution model in particular the
galaxy formation redshift zf and the initial mass function IMF 2 the cosmological
model which enters the models through the galaxy age as a function of redshift 3 the
star formation rates used to describe dierent morphological types which we take from
Guiderdoni  Rocca-Volmerange 1988 and 4 the synthetic lters used to simulate real
photometric lters We take as our canonical models a Salpeter 1955 IMF for early-type
galaxies and a Scalo 1986 IMF for spiral galaxies with a formation redshift zf  15 for
all galaxies We use H0  50 km s1 Mpc1 and consider several discrete values for 0 and
0 We have not attempted to assign formal uncertainties to the photometric corrections
but based on 32 below we estimate that the systematic uncertainties other than from the
cosmological model are a few tenths of a magnitude
Finally we characterize the mass distributions of the lens galaxies using dark matter
dominated singular isothermal ellipsoid SIE lens models see Kassiola  Kovner 1993
Kormann Schneider  Bartelmann 1994ab Kochanek 1996b Keeton et al 1997 We
focus on these models because galaxies generally appear to be singular eg Gebhardt et
al 1996 and because stellar dynamical models eg Rix et al 1997 X-ray galaxies eg
Fabbiano 1989 and lens models and statistics eg Maoz  Rix 1993 Kochanek 1995
1996a Grogin  Narayan 1996 generally prefer an isothermal prole Using an ellipsoidal
mass distribution allows us to probe the shape of the mass distribution We use a surface
mass density of the form
rq1   cos 2  0
where b is the critical radius  an ellipticity parameter related to the axis ratio q by
q2  1  1   and 0 is the orientation angle of the projected ellipsoid quoted as a
standard major-axis position angle measured North through East The critical surface
density for lensing is cr  234h1DlDs2rHDls  1011 Marcsec2 where rH  cH0
is the Hubble radius and Dl Ds and Dls are angular diameter distances to the lens to
the source and from the lens to the source respectively Formulas for the deection and
 8 
magnication of the SIE model are given in Kassiola  Kovner 1993 Kormann et al
1994a and Keeton  Kochanek 1997b In addition to the SIE model another usefule
isothermal model is a singular isothermal sphere plus external shear SISshear model
where the ellipsoidal mass distribution is replaced by the combination of a spherical mass
distribution and an external tidal perturbation eg Falco Gorenstein  Shapiro 1985
Gorenstein Shapiro  Falco 1988 Kochanek 1991a For completeness we consider both
the SIE and SISshear models and we summarize the model results in Table 5 Note that
for the table we have converted the parameter  to the ellipticity e using e  1  q and
q  1  121  12
The models we consider have a single source of shear  an ellipsoidal galaxy or an
external shear  and Table 5 shows that they generally cannot give a good t For many
lenses obtaining a good 2 requires a model with two independent shears such as an
ellipsoidal galaxy with an external shear eg Keeton et al 1997 Witt  Mao 1997 and
in at least four cases the external shear can be attributed to a signicant tidal perturbation
from a nearby cluster group or galaxy MG 07512716 Lehar et al 1997a Q 0957561
eg Young et al 1980 Grogin  Narayan 1996 PG 1115080 eg Keeton  Kochanek
1997a Kundic et al 1997a Schechter et al 1997 Tonry 1997 B 1422231 eg Hogg 
Blandford 1994 Kormann et al 1994b Kundic et al 1997b Tonry 1997 Nevertheless
the single-shear models are useful because they provide fundamental information about the
average monopole and quadrupole of the mass They give a position angle for the mean
shear axis that is largely independent both of the mass prole and of the nature of the
shear They also give a robust mass estimate namely the mass within the critical radius
M  b2cr that is essentially model-independent eg Kochanek 1991a Wambsganss 
Paczynski 1994 and has internal uncertainties of only a few percent due to uncertainties
in b There is in addition a 10 mass uncertainty due to potential uctuations from
large-scale structure eg Bar-Kana 1996 Wambsganss et al 1997 and to perturbations
from nearby galaxies or groups eg Keeton et al 1997 as well as a small dependence
10 on the cosmological model through cr
3 Results
We now combine the optical data and the lens models to survey the properties of lens
galaxies We consider the structures of the mass and light distributions the colors of lens
galaxies the correlation between lens galaxy luminosity and image separation and the
mass-to-light ratios and evolution of the lens galaxies
 9 
31 Lens galaxy structure
We can ask two questions about the structure of lens galaxies First because lensing
makes it possible to directly probe the mass distribution of lens galaxies we can ask
how the mass and light distributions compare in individual galaxies We know that their
proles dier from each other because in early-type galaxies the light roughly follows a de
Vaucouleurs 1948 r14 law while the mass must be distributed in a more extended halo
that is roughly isothermal eg Fabbiano 1989 Maoz  Rix 1993 Kochanek 1995 1996a
Grogin  Narayan 1996 Rix et al 1997 but we can ask how the quadrupole structures
compare by studying the shapes and orientations of the models and of the light distributions
also see Keeton et al 1997 Jackson et al 1997 Second we can compare the distribution
of optical properties for the lens galaxy sample and the general population of early-type
galaxies and thus examine lensing selection eects and biases
Figure 1 compares the optical and model major-axis PAs of the lens galaxies With a
few exceptions the PAs are the same to 10 ie either consistent or dierent by 23
Two exceptions are MG 07512716 Lehar et al 1997 and Q 0957561 Young et al
1980 but in these systems the lens galaxy is part of a cluster or group that contributes
to the lensing so it is not surprising that the average quadrupole of the mass is not
aligned with the galaxys light In the remaining outlier MG 11310456 the PA of the
model closely matches that expected if two nearby galaxies produce a tidal perturbation
Chen Kochanek  Hewitt 1995 The models appear then to be consistent with the
hypothesis that in the absence of external tidal perturbations the projected mass is aligned
with the projected light and conversely that large misalignments signal the presence of
external tidal perturbations Note however that the alignment of the galaxy with the
shear in B 1422231 Hogg  Blandford 1994 Kormann et al 1994b Impey et al 1996
Keeton et al 1997 reminds us that even strong tidal perturbations need not produce large
misalignments If all large misalignments are attributable to external tides then halos
cannot be far out of equilibrium In addition halos probably cannot have the at nearly
prolate shapes predicted by N-body simulations of dissipationless collapse eg Dubinski
 Carlberg 1991 Warren et al 1992 because such halos combined with modestly triaxial
luminous galaxies inferred from kinematic misalignment studies eg Franx Illingworth 
de Zeeuw 1991 produce misalignments between the major axes of the luminous galaxy and
the dark halo of hi  16  19 Romanowsky  Kochanek 1997
Figure 1 also compares the optical and model ellipticities Several lenses with large
tidal perturbations Q 0957561 and B 1422231 clearly stand out by requiring models
signicantly atter than the light although one MG 07512716 does not The remaining
lenses show no strong correlation between the optical and model ellipticities The lack of a
 10 
correlation is certainly consistent with the local results that mass and luminous axis ratios
can dier eg Sackett et al 1994 Buote  Canizares 1994 1996 see the review by Sackett
1996 A quantitative interpretation of Figure 1 is not straightforward however because
the model ellipticity depends on the mass prole with steeper density proles requiring
larger ellipticities Still it appears that galaxy mass distributions are not intrinsically
very at which is consistent with the fact that we do not see any lenses with the disk
image geometry  2 or 3 images o to one side of the lens galaxy center and bracketing the
projected disk  that are associated with highly attened mass distributions see Keeton 
Kochanek 1997b
Figure 2 compares the optical axis ratios of the lens galaxies to a sample of early-type
galaxies in Coma from Jrgensen  Franx 1994 Visually there appears to be a decit of
both round and at lens galaxies compared to the Coma sample both for the optical quasar
and radio lens samples A Kolmogorov-Smirnov KS test of whether the distributions are
identical gives a probability of 32 which indicates that any dierences between the two
samples are statistically marginal The observed numbers of 4-image lenses also suggest
that on average lens galaxies are atter than observed galaxies Kochanek 1996b King 
Browne 1996 Keeton et al 1997 but this result is signicant only at the 1 condence
level Kochanek 1996b Thus at present the statistical evidence that lens galaxies are
signicantly atter than regular galaxies is weak Such an eect could be explained
naturally by the lensing inclination bias which makes attened lens galaxies likely to be
seen edge-on rather than face-on Keeton et al 1997 Keeton  Kochanek 1997b and
predicts a 30 decit of e  0 lens galaxies This eect is not strong for very at galaxies
because optically at galaxies such as spirals require a signicantly rounder dark halo for
stability Ostriker  Peebles 1973 Given that there is no signicant dierence in the
ellipticity distributions of the optical- and radio-selected samples and that there are few
highly attened systems it is unlikely that there is a signicant contribution from spiral
galaxies independent of the inclination bias
Finally Figure 3 shows the relation between lens galaxy eective radius and
luminosity for an 0  1 cosmology compared to the correlation for nearby early-types
ReRe  LLa with Re  4  1h1 kpc and a  12  02 eg Kormendy 
Djorgovski 1989 Rix 1991 The lens galaxies seem to follow the trend although the
dispersion is large Also the result is not very robust because the eective radii and hence
also the total magnitudes are the most uncertain of the optical parameters and because
several of the lens galaxies MG 04140534 MG 11310456 and HST 125312914 that
do have good estimates of Re lack lens redshifts

32 Lens galaxy colors
The distribution of lens galaxy colors provides a way to type the galaxies to probe
galaxy evolution and to make photometric redshift estimates Fourteen lens galaxies
have measured colors see Table 2 Figure 4 compares them to theoretical color evolution
curves for various galaxy types To help compare the colors we have taken the lenses with
known lens redshifts and used the color corrections to transform the observed colors to
F555WF814W roughly V  I as shown in Figure 4 top right and Figure 5 In Figure 5
we also indicate the systematic eects in the theoretical color evolution curves related to
the IMF formation redshift star formation rate and cosmological model see 2
Of the 14 measured colors 11 are either consistent with or redder than early-type
galaxy models For B 1600434 the red color is not reliable because it is based on
low signal-to-noise data Jaunsen  Hjorth 1997 suggested from earlier ground-based
observations that the color and morphology of the lens galaxy in B 1600434 are actually
more consistent with a spiral galaxy For other cases MG 04140534 MG 11310456
and HST 125312914 the signicance of the colors depends heavily on the unknown lens
redshifts If they have zl  08 their colors are only modestly redder than those of passively
evolving early-types By contrast if they are at zl  08 their colors suggest that a sizable
fraction of early-type galaxies must contain enough dust to signicantly aect their colors
Lawrence et al 1995 have suggested that this may be the case at least for MG 04140534
The possibility of dust in early-type galaxies would have dramatic consequences for galaxy
evolution models which usually assume that early-types have little dust It would also
aect cosmological constraints derived from optically-selected lens statistics see Kochanek
1996a Falco et al 1997a Malhotra et al 1997
The three lenses with colors bluer than those of early-type models are B 0218357
B 1608656 and B 1933503 For B 1608656 the color is hard to interpret due to strong
contamination from the lensed images especially in I and to the complicated structure of
the galaxy the model ts give a redder color than the aperture photometry and neither is
very reliable at present For B 1933503 the color is based on very low signal-to-noise data
and thus is not very reliable By contrast for B 0218357 the blue color seems reliable
and suggestive of an Sa galaxy which is consistent with other observations B 0218357
is the smallest-separation lens known with an image separation 034 that is typical of
expectations for lensing by spirals hi  06 see 33 and the lens contains HI and
molecular gas Carilli Rupen  Yanny 1993 Wiklind  Combes 1995 Combes  Wiklind
1997 all of which provides strong evidence that the lens galaxy is a spiral
Figure 5 illustrates the eects of varying the stellar population and evolution models
in interpreting the colors Most lens galaxy colors are roughly consistent with passively
 12 
evolving early-type galaxies and not with spiral galaxies regardless of the parameter
choices The anomalous colors do not weaken this conclusion because varying the
parameters in the plausible direction decreasing the formation redshift from zf  15 or
increasing the Hubble constant from H0  50 km s1 Mpc1 tends to make the theoretical
colors bluer rather than redder so a color that is dicult to explain as an early-type galaxy
is even more dicult to explain as a spiral galaxy
Image separations and lens luminosities
Theoretical models predict correlations between lens luminosities and image separations
which are used in statistical studies to estimate the cosmological model eg Turner et al
1984 Fukugita  Turner 1991 Kochanek 1993a 1996a Maoz  Rix 1993 Falco et al
1997a Im Griths  Ratnatunga 1997 Singular isothermal sphere lens models relate
the image separation  to the dark matter velocity dispersion  of the lens galaxy by
  2DlsDs where   8c2 is the image separation produced by
an L galaxy for a source at innity The average observed separation is hi  2
see Kochanek 1993b for general relations The Faber-Jackson 1976 and Tully-Fisher
1977 relations then relate the lens galaxys velocity dispersion to its luminosity via
LL   so we expect an image separationlens luminosity correlation of the form

For early-type galaxies Kochaneks 1993a 1996a estimate of the Faber-Jackson relation
based on gravitational lens statistics is consistent with   4 and yields   220  20
km s1 which also agrees with dark matter models for the stellar dynamics of ellipticals
Kochanek 1994 For spiral galaxies Fukugita  Turners 1991 estimate of the
Tully-Fisher relation is   26 and   1448
characteristic image splittings of ES0  279 and spiral  119 In other
words for the same luminosity a spiral produces a smaller image separation than an
early-type conversely for a xed image separation a spiral must be 2 mag brighter than
an early-type Finally from galaxy number counts and dynamical models an L galaxy has
an absolute B magnitude of MB  197  01  5 log h Efstathiou Ellis  Peterson
13 km s1 These velocity dispersions yield
Figure 6 shows the predicted relations for ES0 and spiral galaxies together with
the empirical results for lenses with at least one known redshift The image separations
 13 
were taken to be   2bSIS with bSIS from Table 5 The rest-frame B luminosities were
estimated by using the total magnitudes in Table 3 with the color K evolutionary and
Galactic extinction corrections described in 2 Some of the magnitudes in Table 3 are
estimates of the total integrated magnitude and we indicate these with lled points in
Figure 6 Other magnitudes are only aperture magnitudes which we indicate with open
points Note that we have included B 1600434 both as an early-type and a spiral galaxy
the main dierence is the value of  used in the normalization of the image separation
In general the data show the expected correlation although there are a few lenses that
need special discussion
 MG 04140534 As with conclusions about the lens galaxys color 32 conclusions
about its luminosityimage separation relation depend strongly on the lens redshift
If the lens has zl  08 the upper end of the dotted curves in Figure 6 its color
luminosity and image splitting are all roughly consistent with passively evolving
early-type models Note that without the correction for Galactic extinction the lens
galaxy would appear anomalously red and faint even at zl  08
 B 1600434 Jaunsen  Hjorth 1997 proposed from ground-based images that the
lens galaxy is a spiral and the HST images reveal a structure that is dicult to
interpret but is not inconsistent with a spiral Jackson et al 1997 However Figure 6
shows that when treated as a spiral the lens is underluminous by  2 mag while
when treated as an early-type it sits signicantly closer to the trend Its color see
32 and low luminosity seem anomalous for a spiral but they are hard to interpret
given the existing low signal-to-noise data
 B 1608656 and B 1933503 The colors although very uncertain seemed to be
more consistent with spiral galaxy models than with early-type models 32 The
luminosities and image separations however are consistent with the early-type
correlation and not with the spiral correlation Better optical observations including
infrared observations and lens models are needed to properly interpret these systems
 MG 07512716 PG 1115080 and B 1422231 Each galaxy is part of a small
group that contributes  10 to the image separation Hogg  Blandford 1994
Keeton  Kochanek 1997a Kundic et al 1997ab Lehar et al 1997 Schechter et al
1997 Tonry 1997 and thus is expected to appear somewhat underluminous With
total magnitude estimates and a quantitative estimate of the correlation it would be
possible to see whether this is true
 Q 0957561 The galaxy is part of a cluster that contributes signicantly to the large
image separation Young et al 1980 so its position below the trend is expected
 14 
With a good quantitative estimate of the image separationlens luminosity correlation
it would be possible to estimate the intrinsic image splitting of the galaxy and thus
to break the cluster degeneracy in lens models and estimates of the Hubble constant
see Grogin  Narayan 1996 Falco et al 1997c Fischer et al 1997
Table 6 gives the parameters MB and  derived from the correlations by tting a
subsample of lens galaxies namely early-type galaxies with a known lens redshift see the
caption of Table 6 for a list For each t a lens with both source and lens redshifts and
a magnitude in only one passband was represented by a single data point A lens with
no source redshift or with magnitudes in multiple passbands was represented by two data
points that cover the range of results from dierent passbands andor dierent source
redshifts 2  zs  4 Rather than trying to estimate the uncertainties we assumed
uniform uncertainties scaled so that 2  Ndof at the minimum With this technique
the error bars give a rough estimate of the uncertainties from the observed scatter The
empirical correlations are at least broadly consistent with a Faber-Jackson coecient   4
although with the current data the values are slightly lower   27  05 for 0  1
The values for MB are also lower than the canonical value but only by a few tenths of a
magnitude
Im et al 1997 recently used the theoretical relation eq 3 with a sample of seven
lens galaxies to constrain the cosmological model They found that lens galaxy luminosities
are signicantly lower than expected unless 0 is large which contradicts results from lens
statistics Maoz  Rix 1993 Kochanek 1996a Falco et al 1997a that rule out a large
0 We believe that the results of Im et al 1997 are biased in two ways First Im et al
1997 underestimated some of the lens galaxy magnitudes For lenses with only aperture
magnitudes Im et al 1997 subtracted 03 mag to estimate total magnitudes we believe
this to be a signicant underestimate of the aperture corrections compare Tables 3 and 4
In addition Im et al 1997 did not account for Galactic extinction which is signicant for
several lenses see Table 1 By using underestimated magnitudes Im et al 1997 forced
the cosmological model to compensate by raising 0 to increase the luminosity inferred
from a given apparent magnitude Second Im et al 1997 did not properly treat the
uncertainties in global parameters such as MB For example for a canonical value of MB
with uncertainty M  and a tted value that diered by M Im et al 1997 would have
assigned 2  NlensMM 2 whereas a proper treatment of the covariance matrix
would give 2  MM 2 As a result Im et als 1997 cosmological uncertainties
were underestimated by a factor of 23 independent of the systematic biases from
underestimating the lens luminosities Taking into account the underestimated luminosities
and treating the uncertainties correctly overwhelms any cosmological conclusions The
image separationlens luminosity correlation certainly promises to give an interesting
 15 
cosmological constraint but only after the quality of the data has improved
34 Mass-to-light ratios and galaxy evolution
Finally we combined the masses from Table 5 with the aperture magnitudes from
Table 4 to compute mass-to-light ratios ML estimates from lensing have a unique
advantage over estimates from dynamical methods whereas the dynamical methods are
plagued by the ambiguities of using stellar dynamical models to estimate the mass the
lensing method has a robust mass estimate and thus is limited almost entirely by the quality
of the photometry In addition because mass-to-light ratios depend only on aperture
magnitudes and not on accurate prole ts and extrapolations they yield physical results
that are more reliable than the total luminosities studied in 33 As a result lensing
mass-to-light ratios oer an excellent probe of galaxy evolution and structure Lensing also
makes it possible to compute a reliable ML estimate for individual galaxies as opposed to
ML estimates from the fundamental plane that are usually interpreted only in a statistical
Figure 7 shows the rest-frame B-band mass-to-light ratio inside the critical radius
for the lens galaxies with a known lens redshift These MLB use luminosities that were
converted to rest-frame B by using the spectral evolution model to compute color and
K corrections we did not apply the evolutionary correction because we wanted to look
for evidence of evolution Note that although we are using V  R and I magnitudes to
compute the rest-frame B luminosity we are not actually extrapolating the magnitudes
since rest-frame B is roughly equivalent to V at z  02 and I at z  1 we are in fact
interpolating between magnitudes
Although there is signicant scatter in Figure 7 there is a clear decrease in MLB with
redshift due to galaxy evolution To lowest order log MLBz is expected to be linear in z
log MLBz  log MLB0  zdlog MLBdz    
eg van Dokkum  Franx 1996 so we can t a line to the data For the t we excluded
B 0218357 because it is a spiral galaxy B 1600434 because it is poorly understood and
Q 0957561 because the cluster mass makes the ML something other than a true galaxy
ML We used the same t technique as in 33 with at most two data points per lens to
represent the range of results and uniform errors scaled to give 2  Ndof at the minimum
Again the quoted error bars give a rough estimate of the uncertainties
Table 6 summarizes the ts for the dierent cosmological models and Figure 7 shows
the best ts superposed on the data We note that of the lens galaxies used in the t only
 16 
MG 07512716 PG 1115080 and B 1422231 lack estimates of the magnitude within
the critical radius we consider the ts both with and without these galaxies Without
these three galaxies we nd dlog MLBdz  03  01 for 0  1 and 05  01
for 0  01 with 0  0 including these galaxies gives evolution rates that are 1
smaller There is an additional systematic uncertainty because in this preliminary study
we neglected the fact that ML has a small dependence on luminosity eg van der Marel
1991 Jrgensen Franx  Kjrgaard 1996 and that with a dark matter lens model the
ML depends on the impact parameter Our results are comparable to recent results from
studies of intermediate-redshift clusters Kelson et al 1997 found dlog MLV dz  03
0  01 based on fundamental-plane observations of clusters at redshifts of 033 039
and 058 and Schade et al 1997 found dlog Ldz  03 0  1 based on a projection
of the fundamental plane in clusters at redshifts between 02 and 1 The fundamental
plane studies are conned to galaxies in high-density clusters but Stanford et al 1997
suggest that evolution rates are not very sensitive to cluster properties such as optical
richness or X-ray luminosity The fact that we nd similar evolution rates for lens galaxies
in low-density environments provides further empirical evidence that there is no strong
environmental dependence in the stellar populations of early-type galaxies
Mass-to-light ratios are also important in setting the mass scale for both stellar
dynamics and gravitational lensing Previous studies have shown that consistency with
constant ML stellar dynamical models requires an average MLB  10  2h eg van
der Marel 1991 while consistency with lens statistics requires MLB  20  4h eg
Maoz  Rix 1993 Kochanek 1996a and estimates from photometry and lens models of
a few lenses have found MLB  20h eg Kochanek 1995 Burke et al 1992 Figure 8
shows the evolution-corrected MLB ie where the rest-frame B luminosity has been
estimated by applying the evolutionary correction in addition to the color K and Galactic
extinction corrections for our larger sample Two lenses that have notably low values are
B 0218357 which is a spiral and has MLB  4h characteristic of spirals eg Kent 1987
Broeils  Courteau 1997 and MG 07512716 which has only an isophotal magnitude that
overestimates the luminosity within the critical radius and hence underestimates MLB
Other than these two lenses the mass-to-light ratios are generally higher than expected
from stellar dynamics although they are somewhat lower than expected from lens statistics
The large scatter may be related to the dependence of ML on luminosity and on impact
parameter With better photometric data and a larger lens sample it would be possible to
correct for these eects to reduce the scatter and thus to see whether they can explain why
ML from lens models might be smaller than those from lens statistics Nevertheless even
at present the lens galaxy ML provide weak evidence for dark matter in the inner regions
of galaxies

4 Conclusions
The sample of gravitational lens galaxies is now large enough to warrant a systematic
study of their properties By combining the available optical data including new surface
photometry of HST images with constraints from lens models we have surveyed the
physical properties of 17 lens galaxies at redshifts between 01 and 08 Most of the galaxies
appear to be passively evolving early-type galaxies with the exception of one clear spiral
B 0218357 Several lens galaxies B 1600434 B 1608656 and B 1933503 have
poor-quality images or contamination from the lensed images and thus require further
study to understand their colors and morphologies nevertheless at least for B 1608656
and B 1933503 the image separations lens luminosities and mass-to-light ratios are
more consistent with early-type galaxies than with spirals Several other lens galaxies
MG 04140534 MG 11310456 and HST 125312914 may or may not be anomalously
red depending on their redshifts Our results do not support the suggestion by Malhotra et
al 1997 that massive galaxies at intermediate redshifts are very dusty or by Jackson et
al 1997 that most of the lenses are spirals Note that accepting either of these hypotheses
would force a radical revision of almost all galaxy evolution models
The shape distribution of lens galaxies is similar to that of the general population
of early-type galaxies although there is weak evidence for a decit of apparently round
lens galaxies such a decit may be created by the inclination dependence of lensing cross
sections that bias attened lens galaxies toward being viewed edge-on Keeton  Kochanek
1997b There is no obvious correlation between the optical and model ellipticities of lens
galaxies However there is a strong correlation between the optical and model position
angles suggesting that the projected mass and projected light are generally aligned to
10 except in the presence of strong external tidal perturbations This conclusion rules
out dark halos that are far out of equilibrium and have intrinsic axes misaligned with
respect to the luminous baryons It also suggests that halos cannot be formed solely by
dissipationless collapse because such halos tend to be very at and nearly prolate eg
Dubinski  Carlberg 1991 Warren et al 1992 so that when they are combined with a
typical modestly triaxial or oblate luminous galaxy eg Franx et al 1991 there is a large
misalignment between the major axes of the projected mass and light Romanowsky 
Kochanek 1997 The interaction of the dark matter with the baryons must substantially
alter the shape of the dark matter halo so that the light and mass have similar triaxialities
and intrinsic axes as is seen in the preliminary simulations of Dubinski 1994
Lens galaxies obey the correlations between image separation and lens luminosity
predicted by dark matter lens models combined with the Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher
relations For the early-type lens galaxies in an 0  1 cosmology the characteristic
 18 
magnitude is MB  193  01  5 log h and the Faber-Jackson exponent is
  27  05 with an additional systematic uncertainty due to uncertainties in total
magnitude estimates and to the uncertainty in  from lens statistics eg Fukugita
 Turner 1991 Kochanek 1993a 1996a Im et al 1997 attempted to use the image
separationlens luminosity correlation to constrain the cosmological model but by
underestimating aperture corrections neglecting Galactic extinction and improperly
treating uncertainties they obtained misleading results favoring a high-0 cosmology A
robust calculation of the image separationlens luminosity correlation would oer an
interesting cosmological constraint but at present the data lack the necessary precision
The correlation would also improve the constraints on H0 by allowing a calculation of the
intrinsic image splitting of lens galaxies to break the cluster degeneracy in Q 0957561 see
Grogin  Narayan 1996 Falco et al 1997c Fischer et al 1997 and the group degeneracy in
PG 1115080 see Schechter et al 1997 Keeton  Kochanek 1997a Courbin et al 1997b
but again the required precision is not yet available It might also be possible to search for
the analog of the fundamental plane as an explanation of the scatter in the correlation but
the current sample has too few robust estimates of eective radii
The most robust physical properties of the lens galaxies that we can calculate are
mass-to-light ratios Mass-to-light ratios require only aperture magnitudes so they do not
depend on accurate prole ts and extrapolations In addition lensing measures a mass
that has an internal uncertainty of only a few percent eg Kochanek 1991a Wambsganss 
Paczynski 1994 and systematic uncertainties of 20 due to external tidal perturbations
potential uctuations associated with large-scale structure or the cosmological model eg
Bar-Kana 1996 Wambsganss et al 1997 Keeton et al 1997 Thus lens galaxy mass-to-light
ratios are limited primarily by the quality of the photometry making them an outstanding
probe of galaxy evolution We measure an evolution rate of dlog MLBdz  03  01
05  01 for 0  1 01 although there is an additional systematic uncertainty ML
depends weakly on luminosity and more strongly on impact parameter in dark matter
models and in this preliminary study we did not include corrections Our results for lens
galaxies in low-density environments are comparable to results from measurements of the
fundamental plane in intermediate-redshift clusters eg Kelson et al 1997 Schade et al
1996 1997 suggesting that there are no strong environmental eects in the evolution of
early-type galaxies see also Stanford et al 1997 The evolution-corrected mass-to-light
ratios help distinguish between early-type lens galaxies which have MLB  1020h eg
van der Marel 1991 Maoz  Rix 1993 Kochanek 1996a and spiral lens galaxies which
have MLB  4h eg Kent 1987 Broeils  Courteau 1997 at present B 0218357 is
the only lens galaxy with a robust MLB estimate that is consistent with a spiral galaxy
For the early-type lens galaxies the mass-to-light ratios are generally larger than expected
 19 
from constant ML stellar dynamical models although the scatter is large Most of the
scatter is due to uncertainties and systematic eects in the photometric data in particular
it may be related to the dependence of ML on luminosity and impact parameter With
improved photometric data the uncertainties would be signicantly reduced and lens
galaxy mass-to-light ratios could provide strong evidence for dark matter in the inner parts
of galaxies
Our analysis is limited primarily by the quality of the optical data and by the absence
of redshift measurements for some of the lens systems Given a homogeneous data set with
well-determined photometry most of the observational uncertainties will be eliminated
Then by using its ability to probe mass distributions and measure masses  and thus
to avoid dicult spectroscopy and dynamical analysis of distant galaxies  we can use
gravitational lensing as a powerful probe of high-redshift galaxies and their evolution In
addition with well-calibrated correlations it should be possible to use lens galaxy colors
luminosities scale lengths and image separations as an accurate method for estimating lens
redshifts

positions and ux ratios as well as the galaxy position if available eg Keeton  Kochanek
1997a Radio rings were modeled using the LensClean program eg Kochanek 1995 Chen
et al 1995 The error bars are 1 standard errors using a 2 renormalized to equal Ndof
at the minimum because the models generally are poor ts these error bars overestimate
the mass uncertainties The SIS model gives a robust estimate for the mass within the
critical radius M  b2cr which depends only weakly on the lens model The ellipticity
depends on the radial mass prole of the lens roughly as 1  r where r is the surface
density of the model at the critical radius in units of the critical surface density  more
centrally concentrated models require higher ellipticities The position angle is essentially
model-independent in single-shear models

statistically consistent with those in the table Error bars were computed assuming
uniform errors scaled so that 2  Ndof at the minimum
 Fits to the mass-to-light ratio evolution in 34 The results in parentheses
use all of the early-type lens galaxies with a known lens redshift listed above
The other results exclude 0751 1115 and 1422 because these lens galaxies lack
accurate estimates of the magnitude within the critical radius Again error bars
were computed assuming uniform uncertainties scaled so that 2  Ndof at the
minimum

Fig 2 Optical ellipticity distribution of lens galaxies and of a sample of early-type galaxies

axis ratio The histograms in the upper left and upper right show the lens galaxy and Coma
samples respectively In the lower left the solid and dashed curves show deprojections of
the Coma and lens galaxy samples respectively assuming galaxies are oblate In the upper
left and right the curves show reprojections of the deprojected distributions Note that
the lensing projection and deprojection take into account the eects of both inclination bias
Keeton  Kochanek 1997b and magnication bias Falco et al 1997a Finally the lower
right shows the eects expected for spirals Specically an assumed intrinsic distribution
given by the dotted line in the lower left projects to the curves in the lower right where
the solid curve is a simple projection and the dashed curve is a lensing projection The lens
galaxy histogram is included for comparison

Fig 4 Observed extinction-corrected colors and theoretical color evolution curves Lens
galaxies with a known redshift are shown as crosses while those with no known redshift
are shown as horizontal dotted lines For 0142 14176 1549 and 1654 we estimated
F555WF814W colors by applying color transformations to the observed colors these points
are shown as boxes Theoretical color evolution curves are shown for various galaxy types
the burst model consists of a 1 Gyr period of constant star formation followed by passive
evolution the ES0 model has an exponential star formation rate with a time scale of 1 Gyr
and the spiral models have a star formation rate proportional to the gas fraction where the
proportionality constant decreases from Sa to Sb to Sc see Guiderdoni  Rocca-Volmerange
1988 The burst and ES0 models have a Salpeter 1955 IMF while the spiral models have
a Scalo 1986 IMF The curves shown are for 0  1 and H0  50 km s1 Mpc1 with a
galaxy formation redshift zf  15

the light curves have a Scalo 1986 IMF The dotted solid and dashed lines have a formation

6 Image separationlens luminosity correlations The horizontal axis is the
normalized separation using   2bSIS with bSIS from Table 5 The vertical axis is the rest-
frame absolute B magnitude using total magnitudes from Table 3 with color K evolutionary
and Galactic extinction corrections Filled points denote plausible total magnitudes and open
points denote aperture magnitudes Triangles denote spirals and squares denote early-types
Where the lens redshift is unknown the points indicate the median expected redshift and
the lines indicate the 90 condence interval see Table 1 Where the source redshift is
unknown points along the horizontal line denote zs  2 3 and 4 from right to left
Lenses with magnitudes in multiple bands are represented by points connected vertically
The expected relations for ES0 and spiral galaxies are shown by the solid and dashed lines
The error bars indicate the uncertainties in  and MB
 39 
Fig 7 Rest-frame B-band mass-to-light ratios inside the critical radius The luminosities
were computed from the aperture magnitudes in Table 4 with Galactic extinction color and
K corrections  but no evolutionary corrections Filled points indicate that the aperture
magnitudes used an aperture radius equal to the critical radius while open points indicate
an aperture radius not equal to the critical radius Vertical lines connect values of ML
computed from dierent photometric bands and for 0751 1549 and 1933 with dierent
source redshifts zs  2 3 and 4 thus the spread in the points gives some idea of the
systematic uncertainties 0218 stands out because it is a spiral galaxy and 0957 because the
mass from the cluster increases the ML 1600 is o the scale in the two upper panels The
clear trend of ML with redshift is consistent with passive evolution The heavy lines show
the best ts to this trend the solid lines exclude 0751 1115 and 1422 from the ts while
the dotted lines include them see the text and Table 6
 40 
Fig 8 Evolution-corrected ML ie the same ML as in Figure 7 except that the
evolutionary correction has been added The notation is the same as in Figure 7 Again
0218 stands out because it is a spiral and 0957 which is o the scale in all but the 0  08
panel because the mass from the cluster increases the ML The shaded regions indicate
the results from lens statistics eg Maoz  Rix 1993 Kochanek 1996a and from constant
ML stellar dynamical models eg van der Marel 1991
