Abstract
Measuring the evolution in the clustering of galaxies over a large
redshift range is a challenging problem For a two-dimensional galaxy
catalog however we can measure the galaxy-galaxy angular correlation
function which provides information on the density distribution of galax-
ies By utilizing photometric redshifts we can measure the angular cor-
relation function in redshift shells Brunner 1997 Connolly et al 1998
which minimizes the galaxy projection eect and allows for a measure-
ment of the evolution in the correlation strength with redshift In this
proceedings we present some preliminary results which extend our previ-
ous work using more accurate photometric redshifts and also incorporate
absolute magnitudes so that we can measure the evolution of clustering
with either redshift or intrinsic luminosity
1 Data
The photometric data used in this analysis are located in the intersection be-
tween the HST 5096 eld and the CFRS 14 hour eld ie the Groth Strip
covering approximately 0054 Sq Degree All of the photometric data were ob-
tained over several observing runs using the Prime Focus CCD PFCCD camera
on the Mayall 4 meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory KPNO
All observations were made through the broadband lters U B R  I
The photometric data were reduced in the standard fashion which is detailed
elsewhere Brunner 1997 Source detection and photometry were performed us-
ing SExtractor which was chosen for its ability to detect objects in one image
and analyze the corresponding pixels in a separate image When applied uni-
formly to multi-band data this process generates a matched aperture dataset
Our detection image was constructed from the U B R  I images using a 2
process Szalay et al 1998
2 Empirical Photometric Redshifts
The photometric redshifts used in this analysis were derived empirically using
a piecewise approximation approach Brunner et al 1999 Briey this ap-
proach denes ve dierent redshift intervals which track the movement of the
4000 A break through our lter system with increasing redshift for z  12
190 calibrating redshifts were used to derive a global third order polynomial in
U B R  I which provided an initial redshift estimate from which the appro-
priate local redshift estimate was selected The range of calibrating redshifts for
each polynomial t was extended by approximately 005 in order to diminish
end-aliasing eects This algorithm is designed to generate an optimal redshift
for objects by using the more accurate local relations Brunner et al 1997
For each derived polynomial t the degrees of freedom remained a substantial
fraction of the original data a second order t in four variables requires 15
parameters while a third order t in four variables requires 35 parameters

brating spectroscopic redshifts and the estimated photometric redshifts
used in this analysis The intrinsic dispersion in the relationship is
  0061 The right hand gure provides a histogram view of the
residual dierences between the spectroscopic and photometric red-
shifts
A subtle and often overlooked eect in any photometric redshift analysis is
the requirement for accurate multi-band photometry Ideally we could restrict
our photometric-redshift catalog to only those objects which have measured
magnitude errors below some set limits eg 10 photometry This type of a
restriction however introduces two complications a bias towards blue spectral
types and a subsequently complicated selection eect
In an attempt to overcome these biases we restrict the full sample to those
objects which have both IAB  240 and measured magnitude errors  025
in U B  R This minimizes any selection bias to only faint early-type galax-
ies The remaining lter combinations contribute to the noise in our analysis
ie when we consider our nal catalog complete to I  240 and amount to
only a few percent when combined After removing stars and sources with bad
detection ags our nal photometric-redshift catalog contains 3052 sources
3 Ensemble Approach
A formal analytic technique is not always available to utilize photometric red-
shifts and their associated errors when measuring cosmologically interesting
quantities As a result we have developed an alternative technique the galaxy
ensemble approach Essentially we treat the problem in the context of statis-
tical mechanics where each galaxy is localized in redshift space by a Gaussian
probability distribution function To calculate a physically meaningful quantity
we create multiple realizations or ensembles of the galaxy redshift distribu-
tion and calculate the appropriate quantity for all of the dierent ensembles
We then average the dierent measurements to produce the desired value si-
multaneously producing a realistic error estimate This can easily be done for
the redshift distribution of the galaxy sample where an analytic approach is
also available for comparison cf Brunner et al 1999
This approach was used to generate absolute magnitude distributions in
both the U and B bands for this data First a set of 100 redshifts were esti-
mated for each source by drawing redshifts randomly from a Gaussian proba-
bility distribution function PDF with mean and sigma given by the calculated
photometric redshift and photometric redshift error For each redshift in the
ensemble a k-correction was calculated using the assigned spectral type Ap-
parent magnitudes were estimated for every source in the ensemble by drawing
them from a Gaussian PDF with mean and sigma given by the measured mag-
nitude and magnitude error Using the k-corrections apparent magnitudes and
an assumed cosmology 100 dierent absolute magnitude distributions in both
B and U were generated
4 Angular Correlation Function
Before computing the angular correlation function we determined the regions
within our image in which the detection eciency might be reduced The pri-
mary areas where this occurs are around bright stars in charge transfer trails
and near the edge of the frame due to edge eects or focus degradations We
therefore dened bounding boxes for each of the four stacked images which
contained all of the observable ux for the saturated stars within the image
These four mask les were concatenated to produce a total mask le which was
used for the calculation of the angular correlation function in dierent redshift
intervals
We used the optimal estimator DD  2DR  RRRR Landy  Szalay
1993 where D stands for data and R stands for random to determine the
angular correlation function This required counting the number of observed
pairs that were not within the masked areas which was done in 10 bins of
constant width  lg  025 centered at   43 to   7596 1000 objects
were then randomly placed in the non masked areas within the image and the
data-random and random-random correlation functions were calculated for the
same angular bins used for the data-data auto-correlation function
This estimator uses the calculated number density of galaxies within the
CCD frame to estimate the true mean density of galaxies The small angular
area of our images introduces a bias in the estimate commonly referred to as
the Integral Constraint Peebles 1980 We estimated a correction for this
bias following the prescription of Landy and Szalay 1993 which is subtracted
from the DD  2DR  RRRR value
The error in the estimation of the angular correlation function is assumed
Poisson in nature and is calculated as the square root of the number of random-
random pairs in each angular bin
5 Evolution in the Clustering of Galaxies
The multivariate angular correlation function w zP  was determined for nine
dierent redshifts by binning the data in redshift bins of width zP  02 cen-
tered at zP  02 to zP  10 The nine dierent functions are calculated for
the 258 330 327 420 640 715 713 732 and 514 objects in the dierent re-
spective redshift bins For each redshift region a least squares t was performed
assuming the relation w  Aw08 The amplitude was then measured by
minimizing the absolute deviation with respect to Aw which in this case reduces
to nding the median of the measured correlation function amplitudes
Previously two methods have been used to quantify the evolution in the
clustering of galaxies The rst technique is to invert the angular correlation
function w using the Limber equation Peebles 1980 and an observed or
model redshift distribution to estimate the expected change in the amplitude
of the angular correlation function for dierent magnitude intervals andor cos-
mologies The other approach is to compute the spatial correlation function
r for dierent epochs directly using spectroscopic redshifts These two
techniques however suer from dierent limitations that have restricted their
utility
Studies which utilize dierent magnitude intervals are limited by the redshift
smoothing eects of an apparent magnitude limited sample much the same as
the number magnitude distributions The spectroscopic approach is hindered
either by the size of the available samples especially when the data is binned
into distinct redshift intervals or by the depth of the survey These studies are
also aected up to a factor of two by the redshift space distortions due to
density inhomogeneities
We adopt the novel approach of computing the amplitude of the multi-
variate angular correlation function for the 3052 objects in the photometric
redshifttemplate SED catalog in redshift bins of width z  02 To compare
these observations to semi-analytic theory we assume a power law model for the
spatial clustering Peebles 1980

locally The three canonical values of the evolution assuming   18 are

coordinates and   12 for clustering xed in co-moving coordinates The
change in Aw with redshift is displayed in Figure 2 along with the three dierent
evolution models for   10 and   01 The error in Aw was calculated by
estimating Aw in each redshift interval for the 1 upper and lower values

tude of the angular correlation function with redshift The three lines

bers equation and the redshift distribution measured from the galaxy

sumes xed clustering in proper coordinates   00 and the bottom
panel assumes xed clustering in co-moving coordinates   12
Of the three dierent scenarios the predictions for clustering xed in co-
moving coordinates   12 are the least consistent with our data indepen-
dent of the value of  The predictions of linear theory   08 are mildly
consistent for high values of  while the best agreement is for clustering xed
in proper coordinates   00 independent of the value of  Our technique
is less sensitive to redshift distortions than the spatial correlation approach due
to the width of our redshift bins Furthermore our technique does not require
model predictions for the redshift distribution of galaxies as does the apparent
magnitude interval approach
The novel measurement of the evolution in the clustering of galaxies with
absolute magnitude we have presented in Figure 3 is consistent with both the
general expectation of most structure formation theories and similar low redshift
observations Further improvements in this technique are forthcoming Brunner
et al 1999b and will include measurements of the evolution of the correlation
length with both redshift and absolute magnitude as well as a conversion from
Figure 3
These two panels show the evolution of the amplitude of
the angular correlation function with absolute magnitude top and the
evolution of the correlation length with absolute magnitude bottom
for the U right and B left bands No segregation by redshift was
used in this analysis The absolute magnitudes are generated using the
100 dierent realizations with the ensemble approach The amplitude
of the correlation function was converted to R0 using Limbers equation
with   1 and   00 and integrating over entire redshift range
the amplitude of the correlation function Aw to the correlation length r0 in
a model ie  free technique
