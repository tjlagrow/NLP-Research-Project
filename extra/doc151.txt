Abstract
We briey discuss the main dierences between the H i properties of
luminous and low-luminosity early-type galaxies In luminous early-type
galaxies the H i is often irregularly distributed but in a few cases regular
H i disks of low surface density are seen
In low-luminosity galaxies
the H i is more often in a disk with high central surface densities This
suggests a dierent evolution of the gas in these two groups of galaxies
Introduction
Early-type galaxies are generally considered gas poor but this does not mean
that gas is not important for the evolution of these galaxies Many early-type
galaxies in particular those in the eld do have a long-lived cool interstellar
medium one that is often very similar to that in spiral galaxies The main
dierence is that they galaxies have less of it typically 1-10 compared to what
is present in spirals eg Knapp 1999
Gas content is one of the key elements for understanding the formation and
evolution of galaxies Early-type galaxies constitute quite a heterogeneous group
of galaxies Several of their properties eg stellar rotation isophotal shape core
properties ionization characteristics of the ionized gas star formation history
vary systematically with luminosity and environment These dierences can be
partly explained by dierent amounts of gas present in the formationevolution
In models for galaxy formation the gas supply is a key factor To help in under-
standing the mechanisms and processes behind these systematic dierences it
may be worthwhile to study the properties of the neutral hydrogen in early-type
galaxies and in particular whether there are systematic dierences of the H i
properties as function of luminosity and environment
A few dozen H i data cubes are available now of early-type galaxies most
of them obtained by Van Gorkom and collaborators with the VLA and by us
using the Australia Telescope Compact Array and we will briey discuss some
of the systematics of the H i properties of early-type galaxies

2 Origin
One key question is where does the H i come from It is generally thought that
the H i is due to a recent accretionmerger event But is this the whole story If
one considers the H i detection rates eg Bregman et al 1992 one does indeed
see that early-type galaxies that based on their optical morphology are classied
as peculiar are more often detected than normal early-type galaxies This
does indicate that accretionmerging is an important factor But the statistics
also indicate that those early-type galaxies that show some indications for the
presence of a usually small disk component are more likely to be detected in
H i eg Hogg et al 1993 This suggests that a subgroup of early-type galaxies
has regular H i structures A third factor is also the environment although there
are no good statistics available in order to be able to quantify this
3 Luminous early-type galaxies
The range in H i morphology in the luminous galaxies MB  19 is much
broader than that seen in low-luminosity galaxies In most luminous galaxies
the H i shows an irregular morphology consistent with the idea that the gas is
accreting onto the galaxy or is left over from a recent merger event Often
these galaxies are found in small groups
However as suggested by the detection statistics there are a few luminous
galaxies known that have very regular H i An example is NGC 807 This galaxy
is classied as E4 in the RC3 but is rich in H i The H i is very extended going
out to several tens of kpc and shows very regular kinematics Figure 1a shows
the position-velocity plot of the H i along the major axis obtained by us from
archival VLA data Dressel et al Another example is NGC 3108 observed by
us with the ATCA and the VLA Also this galaxy has a H i disk of several tens
of kpc in radius Figure 1b shows the position-velocity map of the H i along the
major axis The H i disk in NGC 3108 has a central hole Interestingly this
hole is lled up with ionized gas that has the same kinematics as the H i These
data show that the H i in these galaxies is in a regularly rotating disk that is
basically the same as disks in spiral galaxies including the at rotation curves
In fact if one would not know the optical morphology it would be very dicult
to tell from the H i data alone that these are early-type galaxies
What distinguishes these H i disks from those seen in spiral galaxies is that
the surface density of the H i is much lower The peak surface density is usually
below 2 M pc2 and often the H i distribution has a central hole These low
surface densities imply that no large-scale star formation is occurring and the H i
disk will evolve very slowly At most a very faint optical counterpart to the H i
disk will form Some of these galaxies could perhaps be considered as extremely
early-type spirals where the characteristics of the H i are such that an optical
disk failed to form from the H i disk disk-less disk galaxies
However the presence of the H i in these galaxies may still be connected
to mergingaccretion to some extent For example NGC 5266 Morganti et al
1997 is a minor-axis dust-lane elliptical with a large amount of H i MHILB 
02 Almost all the H i is in a disk-like structure with more or less regular
kinematics parallel to the optical major axis However in the centre a small

grey contours near the centre that of H
fraction of the H i is rotating parallel to the minor axis and is coincident with
the minor-axis dust lane Faint traces of H i connecting the two H i structures
are also seen Most likely NGC 5266 is a system where a large amount of H i
has been accreted a relatively long time ago and most of the H i has been able
to settle in a disk Perhaps NGC 5266 is an example of the scenario suggested
by Hibbard and van Gorkom 1996 that during a merger of gas-rich galaxies a
large fraction of the H i can be transported to large radii as tidal tails while at
a later stage this gas falls back to form a disk This would suggest that some
of the early-type galaxies with regular gas disks are very old merger remnants
4 Low-luminosity early-type galaxies
In low-luminosity early-type galaxies the situation is quite opposite to that in lu-
minous galaxies Almost without exception in low-luminosity early-type galax-
ies the H i is in a disk with regular morphology and kinematics
In a way
low-luminosity early-type galaxies are also disky in H i In most low-luminosity
galaxies there is no evidence from the kinematics that a recent accretion has
occurred This points to a dierent accretion history of the H i As an exam-
ple in gure 3 we give the total H i image and the position-velocity map of the
galaxy NGC 2328 MB  18 The H i in this galaxy is in a nicely rotating
disk aligned with the optical body
Only in some galaxies there is some kinematics evidence that part of the
H i may have been accreted recently For example in the galaxies NGC 802
Sadler et al 2000 and NGC 855 Walsh et al 1990 part of the H i is in a
polar ring-like structure
Another characteristic is that in low-luminosity galaxies the H i is very
centrally concentrated and that the central surface densities are much higher

that in luminous early-type galaxies The central surface densities observed are
typically 6 M pc2 or higher and signicant star formation is occurring in the
central regions In fact these galaxies follow the radio-FIR correlation observed
for spiral galaxies suggesting that the conditions in the central regions are not
too dierent from those in spiral galaxies
5 Conclusions
Systematics dierences are observed between the H i properties of luminous
early-type galaxies and those of low-luminosity early-type galaxies These dif-
ferences are likely to be connected to systematics dierences between the two
classes of galaxies seen at other wavelengths and could point to dierences in
accretion history of the gas and evolution
