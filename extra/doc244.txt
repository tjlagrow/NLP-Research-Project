ABSTRACT
We have combined optical data from the 2dF-SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy and QSO
2SLAQ redshift survey with radio measurements from the 14 GHz VLA FIRST and
NVSS surveys to identify a volumelimited sample of 391 radio galaxies at redshift
04  z  07 By determining an accurate radio luminosity function for luminous
earlytype galaxies in this redshift range we can investigate the cosmic evolution of
the radiogalaxy population over a wide range in radio luminosity
The lowpower radio galaxies in our LRG sample those with 14 GHz radio lumi-
nosities in the range 1024 to 1025 W Hz1 corresponding to FR I radio galaxies in the
local universe undergo signicant cosmic evolution over the redshift range 0  z  07
consistent with pure luminosity evolution of the form 1zk where k  20  03
Our results appear to rule out at the 67 level models in which lowpower radio
galaxies undergo no cosmic evolution The most powerful radio galaxies in our sample
with radio luminosities above 1026 W Hz1 may undergo more rapid evolution over
the same redshift range
The evolution seen in the lowpower radio-galaxy population implies that the to-
tal energy input into massive earlytype galaxies from AGN heating increases with
redshift and was at least 50 higher at z  055 the median redshift of the 2SLAQ
LRG sample than in the local universe

INTRODUCTION
The strong cosmic evolution of the most powerful radio
galaxies was deduced more than forty years ago from radio
source counts Longair 1966 which imply that the space
density of powerful radio galaxies at redshift z  2 was
roughly a thousand times higher than in the local universe
Doroshkevich Longair  Zeldovich 1970 Dunlop  Pea-
cock 1990
Far less is known about the cosmic evolution of the
lowerpower radio galaxies which comprise the overwhelm-
ing majority of the local radio AGN population Relatively
few lowpower radio galaxies have been observed at redshifts

beyond z  03 partly because classical uxlimited radio
surveys like the Cambridge 3CR Laing Riley  Longair
1983 and Molonglo MRC Large et al 1981 sample only a
narrow range in radio luminosity at any given redshift see
eg Blundell et al 2002 but the observed distribution of
radio source counts implies that lowpower radio sources
cannot evolve as rapidly as the most powerful sources do
Longair 1966
This nding led to the development of two classes of
model for the cosmic evolution of radioloud active galax-
ies single-population models in which the rate of evolution
varies with radio power Dunlop  Peacock 1990 and dual
population models in which the radiosource population is
assumed to be made up of a lowluminosity nonevolving
component and a highluminosity rapidlyevolving compo-
nent Jackson  Wall 1999 In the dualpopulation mod-
els the two populations have been variously been identied
with FR I and FR II radio galaxies Wall 1980 later ex-
panded by Jackson  Wall 1999 to include BL Lac objects
and atspectrum QSOs as the beamed counterparts of FR I
and FR II objects respectively or with objects having weak
and strong optical emission lines independent of their radio
morphology Willott et al 2001
Several recent studies imply that lowpower radio
galaxies ie those with 14 GHz radio luminosities near or
below the FR IFR II divide at  1026 W Hz1 undergo lit-
tle or no cosmic evolution In the model of Jackson  Wall
1999 which is consistent with both radio source counts
and the observed redshift distribution of 3CR sources there
is strong cosmic evolution of FR II radio galaxies but no evo-
lution of the FR I population Clewley  Jarvis 2004 also
found no increase in the comoving density of radio sources
with luminosities below P325 MHz  1025 W Hz1 over the
redshift range 0  z  08
In contrast Brown Webster  Boyle 2001 found sig-
nicant luminosity evolution of the form 1  zk where
3  k  5 for a sample of lowpower radio galaxies over
the redshift range 0  z  05 Snellen  Best 2001 found
two distant FR I radio galaxies in the small area of sky cov-
ered by the Hubble Deep Field from which they argue that
FR I radio galaxies must be signicantly more abundant at
z  1 than in the nearby universe Willott et al 2001 also
suggest that the comoving space density of lowluminosity
radio galaxies rises by about 1 dex between z  0 and  1
The tight relation between the mass of luminous early
type galaxies and the mass of their central supermassive
 Fanaro  Riley 1974 divided radio galaxies into two classes
based on the observed morphology of their radio emission and
showed that this morphology correlates with radio luminosity
with the less luminous FR I objects having a jet-like appearance
and the more luminous FR II objects having edge-brightened ra-
dio hotspots Later work Bicknell 1995 showed that the classi-
cation appears to have a physical basis since FR II radio galaxies
have jets which remain relativistic over scales of tens to hundreds
of kiloparsec whereas FR I radio jets rapidly decelerate to sub-
relativistic velocities As a result models of radio-galaxy evolution
often treat FR I and FR II radio galaxies as separate populations
which may evolve in dierent ways
 Throughout this paper we use the term earlytype galaxy
to refer to both luminous passivelyevolving distant galaxies
LRGs and giant ES0 galaxies in the local universe
black holes Magorrian et al 1998 implies that the evolu-
tion of galaxies and their central black holes are intimately
related There is also increasing evidence that radio jets can
regulate and prevent star formation in luminous earlytype
galaxies by heating the interstellar gas and stopping the on-
set of cooling ows Binney  Tabor 1995 Rawlings  Jarvis
2004 Birzan et al 2004 Springel Di Matteo  Hernquist
2005 Since most radio galaxies have radio luminosities well
below the FR IFR II break for most of their lifetimes im-
proving our understanding of the cosmic evolution of these
lowerpower radio galaxies is an essential rst step in under-
standing their eects on the starformation history of mas-
sive galaxies This is particularly important in the context
of recent semianalytic models of galaxy evolution which in-
corporate AGN heating eg Croton et al 2006 Bower et
al 2006 as we discuss in 64 of this paper
Previous studies in this area have relied strongly on the
analysis of radio sourcecounts andor on the use of pho-
tometric redshifts to derive distances However the most
direct and accurate way to measure the cosmic evolution
of lowpower radio galaxies is to compare the radio lumi-
nosity function RLF observed at dierent redshifts This
requires a large volumelimited rather than uxlimited
sample of radio sources which is reasonably complete over
a wide range in radio power Such samples can now be as-
sembled by combining a large optical redshift survey with a
sensitive largearea radio continuum survey this technique
has been used to measure accurate RLFs for galaxies in the
local universe Sadler et al 2002 Best et al 2005ab Mauch
 Sadler 2006 In this paper we extend the same technique
to higher redshift 04  z  08 by using optical spectra
from the 2SLAQ LRG survey Cannon et al 2006 and radio
data from the VLA FIRST Becker et al 1995 and NVSS
Condon et al 1998 surveys

2 THE 2SLAQ LRG SURVEY
During 20035 the 2SLAQ 2dFSDSS LRG And QSO sur-
vey used the 2dF multiobject spectrograph on the Anglo
Australian Telescope to obtain optical spectra of over 11000
luminous red galaxies LRGs with i-band magnitude 198
and redshifts in the range 04  z  08 Full details of the
source selection sample properties and spectroscopic obser-
vations are discussed by Cannon et al 2006 and only a
brief outline is given here
The total co-moving volume sampled by the 2SLAQ
LRG survey out to the median redshift of z055 is just
over 108 Mpc3 ie a larger volume than that sampled by the
2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey 2dFGRS Colless et al 2001
which covered a larger area of sky to a shallower redshift
limit up to z  03 for the most luminous galaxies
21 Colour selection of 2SLAQ LRGs
The 2SLAQ LRG sample was selected using ugriz Fukugita
et al 1996 photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
SDSS York et al 2000 in two narrow strips along the
celestial equator covering a total area of about 180 deg2

Radiogalaxy evolution to z  07
mary sample Sample 8 consists of objects with z  045 at
a surface density such that most targets can be accessed in
a single pass This sample has over 90 completeness both
spatially and in terms of redshift reliability A secondary
sample Sample 9 contains mostly lower-redshift objects
with z  045 it is photometrically homogeneous and has
high redshift completeness but very variable spatial cover-
The photometric selection technique worked very suc-
cessfully over 90 of the objects observed were LRGs in the
target redshift range As discussed by Wake et al 2006
these galaxies lie well above the knee in the optical lumi-
nosity function and have rband luminosities in the range
215 L
22 2dF spectroscopy
All the 2SLAQ spectra were obtained with the 2dF bre
spectrograph Lewis et al 2002 and the observing and re-
duction techniques are described in detail by Cannon et al
2006 The wavelength coverage of the 2dF spectra was
typically 50007250 A as shown in Figure 2 In the redshift
range targeted by the 2SLAQ survey the main features seen
in the 2dF spectra are the Ca II H and K absorption lines
and 4000A break
For 2SLAQ galaxies with redshifts above z  045 the
H line is shifted out of the 2dF wavelength range and the
only observable strong emission line is O II 3727A which
is seen in the spectra of just over 25 of the radiodetected
2SLAQ LRGs Higherexcitation emission lines of Ne V
3426A and Ne III 3870A are also detected in a few 2SLAQ
LRGs like J092203200044435 in Figure 2 as discussed
later in 43 The great majority  70 of radiodetected
2SLAQ LRGs show absorptionline spectra like the galaxy
in Figure 2a and only a handful have an eA spectrum
like that shown in 2d
3 RADIO SOURCE IDENTIFICATIONS
We adopted a twostep approach similar to that described
by Best et al 2005a to identify radio sources associated
with the 2SLAQ LRGs using radiosource catalogues from
both the VLA FIRST survey Becker et al 1995 and the
NVSS Condon et al 1998
The FIRST and NVSS radio surveys have complemen-
tary properties NVSS with a 45 arcsec beam accurately
samples the total ux density of extended radio sources
FIRST with a 5 arcsec beam has higher spatial resolution
but at the expense of resolving out extended radio emission
on scales larger than a few arcseconds and hence under-
estimating the total ux density of galaxies with extended
radio components We therefore use the FIRST positions to
identify 2SLAQ radio galaxies and the NVSS ux densities
to calculate the radio luminosity function
31 Background
The surface density of bright galaxies B195 mag is
low enough that reliable radio identications can usually
be made from the NVSS survey alone see eg Sadler et
Figure 1 Photometric selection criteria for the 2SLAQ LRG
sample Small dots show the full 15000-galaxy spectroscopic
sample and large lled circles the z  04 radiodetected LRGs

dened by Cannon et al 2006 are also labelled along with the
colourcut lines cpar and dperp used to select them A small num-
ber of 2SLAQ galaxies belong to other photometric samples and
fall outside the area covered by Samples 8 and 9
The colours used for selection were the SDSS extinction-
corrected modelMag colours as described by Stoughton et
al 2002 and the colour selection criteria were similar to
those used by Eisenstein et al 2001 to select SDSS LRGs

get objects in the redshift range 04  z  08 A dered-
dened cuto magnitude of i198 was applied along with
the cuts in g  r and r  i colour
Figure 1 shows the colour cuts used to select target
2SLAQ LRGs for the spectroscopic survey As discussed in
detail by Cannon et al 2006 04  z  07 LRGs whose
light is dominated by an old passivelyevolving stellar pop-
ulation are expected to lie along a vertical track in this di-
agram with g  r  17 In this redshift range the r  i
colour of earlytype galaxies becomes rapidly redder with
increasing z as the 4000A break moves through the band
whereas the g  r colour remains almost constant

al 2002 Mauch  Sadler 2006 For fainter objects how-
ever more accurate radio positions are needed Best et al
2005a have developed a multi-stage method using infor-
mation from both FIRST and NVSS to produce a sample of
radiosource IDs with high completeness and reliability and
have used this to identify the radio counterparts of galaxies
145  r  178 mag in the second data release of the
Experience shows that the measured radio luminosity
function of volumelimited galaxy samples such as the SDSS
and 2dFGRS is very robust against small changes in the way
the sample is selected For example the RLFs measured by
Best et al 2005a for local AGN and starforming galaxies
agree well with those measured by Sadler et al 2002 and
Mauch  Sadler 2006 even though slightly dierent radio
identication criteria were used in all three investigations
In this study we use a similar approach to that of Best
et al 2005a though with some modications as described
below In particular we check all our candidate FIRST radio
IDs visually on radiooptical overlay plots This matches
the procedure used by Mauch  Sadler 2006 to identify a
large sample of radio galaxies from the 6dF Galaxy Survey
Jones et al 2004 which we use here as the local benchmark
to measure the redshift evolution of the radio luminosity
function
We carried out the radiosource identication in three
stages
 Early in the project we performed a series of tests on
the 2003 version of the 2SLAQ LRG input photometric cat-
alogue This allowed us to estimate both the reliability of
the nal radio sample and the expected number of extended
double and multiple radio sources as described in 321
 Once the 2SLAQ spectroscopic observations were com-
plete we cross-matched the nal spectroscopic catalogue
with the FIRST survey This allowed us to identify a sample
of 367 2SLAQ LRGs associated with FIRST radio sources
see 331
 We also cross-matched the 2SLAQ LRG spectroscopic
catalogue with the NVSS catalogue as discussed in 332
This allowed us to identify six very extended radio sources
with angular sizes greater than 1 arcmin as well as 22 weak
radio sources which were not listed in the FIRST catalogue
The NVSS catalogue provides accurate total ux densities
for most of the sources identied in the FIRST catalogue
ccid13 2006 RAS MNRAS 000 1
Radiogalaxy evolution to z  07
pected the number of matched sources approaches the value
expected by chance for osets larger than about 20 arcsec
The population of FIRST radio sources within 30 arcsec
of a 2SLAQ LRG will be a mixture of the following
a Single radio sources which are genuinely associated with
a 2SLAQ galaxy
b Components of double or triple radio sources which are
genuinely associated with a 2SLAQ galaxy
c Unrelated foreground or background radio sources The
likely numbers of such objects can be estimated from Monte
Carlo tests
d Components of single double or triple radio sources as-
sociated with neighbouring galaxies at the same redshift as
the 2SLAQ galaxy
For each 2SLAQ LRG with a candidate radio source
within 30 arcsec we overlaid radio contours from the FIRST
survey onto greyscale optical images taken mainly from the
SDSS DR3 with a small number from the SuperCOSMOS
images These overlays were then inspected by at least two
team members who agged each candidate source as ac-
cept or reject based on the following guidelines
i All sources less than 30 arcsec from a 2SLAQ galaxy were
accepted as genuine IDs
ii A single FIRST source separated by 310 arcsec from
a 2SLAQ galaxy is accepted as an ID if a it is spatially
resolved and extended in the direction of the optical galaxy
b the separation is no larger than the projected major axis
of the radio source and c no other optical object closer to
the radio position is visible on the overlay images
iii Two FIRST components of similar ux density are ac-
cepted as IDs if the optical galaxy lies within 50 arcsec of
the radio centroid unless another optical object is closer
iv Where three or more FIRST components are present
a decision on whether each is associated with the optical
galaxy is based on visual inspection alone
322 The eects of clustering
Of the 2871 FIRST matches with the 2SLAQ input pho-
tometric catalogue 1602 56 were classied as genuine
associations with 1362 2SLAQ galaxies This corresponds to
a radio detection rate of 23 for the 2003 2SLAQ input
catalogue Of the accepted radio galaxies 87 had a single
FIRST component 10 were doubles and 3 were resolved
into three or more FIRST components Our Monte Carlo
tests imply that the excess of real over random sources
in this sample should be roughly 175040 This is signi-
cantly higher than the 1602 sources we accepted as genuine
associations with 2SLAQ galaxies and at rst glance might
suggest that we have failed to recognize up to 150 genuine
matches of FIRST radio sources with galaxies in the 2SLAQ
input catalogue
However as noted by Best et al 2005a Monte Carlo
tests will not give a reliable estimate of completeness if the
2SLAQ galaxies are strongly clustered If the overall space
density of galaxies is higher in the vicinity of a 2SLAQ LRG
then the probability of nding a radio source within 30 arcsec
of the LRG will also be higher For the 2003 2SLAQ in-
put catalogue we have a statistical excess of 14840 ra-
dio sources which are not identied with 2SLAQ galaxies
but also cannot be explained by chance associations of fore-
ground or background objects If these excess radio sources

ber of chance coincidences expected if the FIRST radio sources

32 Tests using the 2SLAQ LRG photometric
catalogue
321 Radiosource identication
Of the 70582 galaxies listed in the 2003 2SLAQ LRG input
photometric catalogue 60290 85 lay within the region of
sky covered by the FIRST radio catalogue We checked for
possible matches of these galaxies with FIRST radio sources
using a 30 arcsec maximum oset between the radio and op-
tical positions because both our own tests and the study
by Best et al 2005a showed that only a handful of gen-
uine radio IDs are expected at larger separations For the
redshift range covered by the 2SLAQ LRGs 04  z  08
30 arcsec corresponds to a projected linear distance from the
optical galaxy of 160220 kpc The few radio galaxies with
radio lobes more distant than this are best identied in the
lower-resolution NVSS images as discussed below
A total of 2782 of the LRGs in the input catalogue 4
had one or more FIRST radio sources within 30 arcsec of the
optical position and so were candidate radio galaxies We
repeated the matching process using a set of random po-
sitions oset by 10 arcmin from the position of each galaxy
in the 2SLAQ input catalogue This Monte Carlo test al-
lows estimation of the number of unrelated foreground or
background radio sources which are seen by chance Figure
3 plots the number of sources seen in 2SLAQ and random
elds as a function of the oset between radio and optical po-
sitions Note that the vertical axis is logarithmic so the ex-
cess of sources at separations  3 arcsec is very large As ex-

Sadler et al
are associated with LRGs which are clustered near 2SLAQ
galaxies but fall below the i  198 magnitude cuto of the
2SLAQ catalogue and if we assume the same 23 radio de-
tection rate for these slightly fainter LRGs as for the 2SLAQ
galaxies we would require an excess of about 6500 LRGs
within 30 arcsec of a 2SLAQ LRG This in turn implies that
11 of 2SLAQ LRGs have another LRG within 30 arcsec
on the sky a projected separation of 190 kpc for redshift
z055 which is consistent with the observed level of clus-
tering in the 2SLAQ LRG sample Ross et al 2006
33 Identication of radio galaxies in the 2SLAQ
spectroscopic catalogue
331 Cross-matches with the FIRST and NVSS
radiosource catalogues
The 2SLAQ LRG input catalogue was revised and expanded
in 2004 so the nal LRG spectroscopic sample is not a sim-
ple subset of the 2003 input catalogue discussed above We
therefore repeated the matching process described in 321
for the 14978 galaxies in the nal spectroscopic LRG sam-
ple The overlap with the FIRST survey area was signi-
cantly higher for the nal spectroscopic catalogue 965
than for the 2003 input catalogue 85 giving us near
complete radio data for the spectroscopic sample
The lowerresolution NVSS is more sensitive to large
scale radio emission than the FIRST survey and so pro-
vides a better measure of the total ux density of ex-
tended radio sources Condon et al 1998 We independently
cross-matched the 2SLAQ spectroscopic catalogue with the
NVSS both to measure more accurate total ux densities for
sources identied through matching with FIRST and also to
search for extended or low surfacebrightness radio sources
which might have been missed in the FIRST survey
Following Best et al 2005a we searched for NVSS
radio components within 3 arcmin of the optical position
of each LRG This search radius is large enough to include
both lobes of any extended or multi-component radio galaxy
but smaller than the 10 arcmin separation typical of unre-
lated NVSS sources It is important to note however that
the probability of nding an unrelated NVSS source within
3 arcmin of an arbitrary position on the sky is high 30
see Fig 6 of Condon et al 1998 and even the probability
of nding two unrelated sources within 3 arcmin is 10
Of the 14978 galaxies in the nal LRG spectroscopic
catalogue 4378 had a single NVSS source within 3 arcmin
of the optical position and a further 1316 had two or
more NVSS sources within 3 arcmin We excluded all the
single-component matches with osets larger than 30 arcsec
since Mauch  Sadler 2006 found that genuine matches of
nearby galaxies with a single NVSS source all have radio
optical separations smaller than 30 arcsec This left 375 can-
 The fraction of galaxies with Galactic latitude b  20 is
signicantly lower in the nal spectroscopic catalogue than in the
2003 input catalogue Since the FIRST survey has incomplete
coverage of regions within 20 degrees of the Galactic Plane its
overlap with the nal spectroscopic catalogue is correspondingly
higher than the 85 overlap with the 2003 input photometric
catalogue
Figure 4 The 2SLAQ radio galaxy J003754590027174 at
z059 which has a projected linear size of 20 Mpc making it
one of the largestknown radio galaxies A cross marks the op-
tical position of the 2SLAQ galaxy which is coincident with the
radio core near the centre of the image and the lled ellipse in
the lower righthand corner shows the size of the FIRST beam
didate single-component NVSS matches in addition to the
1316 candidate multi-component matches
We checked all the candidate NVSS identications by
visually inspecting overlays of FIRST and NVSS radio con-
tours onto optical images of each galaxy since the FIRST
contours usually allow us to unambiguously identify the host
galaxy of a candidate NVSS radio source This visual in-
spection yielded a list of 322 2SLAQ LRGs which appeared
to be genuinely associated with one or more NVSS radio
sources 271 of these galaxies were already identied with
FIRST radio sources but the remaining 51 galaxies had no
corresponding source in the FIRST catalogue and are dis-
cussed in 332 below
The NVSS matching process allowed us to identify addi-
tional radio components oset more than 30 arcsec from the
2SLAQ galaxy position for several 2SLAQ LRGs which had
already been matched with FIRST sources One of these
J003754590027174 is shown in Figure 4 and is a newly-
discovered giant radio galaxy with a linear size of 20 Mpc
Only the relatively weak central component of this source
was identied in our original FIRST matching but the two
radio hotspots each more than 2 arcmin from the 2SLAQ
position were easily found by inspection of the NVSS over-
lay plot

NVSS and FIRST
Figure 5 compares the total NVSS and FIRST ux densi-
ties for 2SLAQ LRGs which were detected in both radio
surveys Note that for sources weaker than about 10 mJy
the catalogued FIRST ux densities tend to be systemat-
ically lower than those measured by NVSS mostly due to
the radio emission of extended sources being resolved out

Galaxies listed as uncatalogued have a radio source catalogued

but below the uxdensity limit of the FIRST catalogue
signicantly higher for the galaxies in Sample 8 31  02
than for those in Sample 9 19  02
The dierence in radio detection rates is related to the
higher median redshift of the Sample 8 LRGs compared to
those in Sample 9 and a plot of radio detection rate versus
redshift shows a smooth rise in detection rate from about
14 at z  04 to 36 at z  06 and above The de-
tection rate increases with redshift because radio galaxies
are preferentially found in the most massive and luminous
LRGs see 42 of this paper Because of the i  198 ap-
parent magnitude limit of the 2SLAQ sample these very
luminous LRGs make up an higher fraction of the 2SLAQ

As noted above our NVSS cross-matching identied a
further 51 candidate NVSS identications of 2SLAQ LRGs
which were not matched with radio sources in the FIRST
catalogue While these could be variable radio sources it is
more likely that at the higher resolution of the FIRST survey
their peak surface brightnesses fall below the 1 mJybeam
limit of the FIRST catalogue Three of these objects are as-
sociated with wide double sources which are listed in the
FIRST catalogue but have no catalogued FIRST compo-
nents within 30 arcsec of the 2SLAQ galaxy Many of the
remaining objects have a weak radio source at the 2SLAQ
position which is visible in the FIRST survey image but
too faint to be listed in the FIRST catalogue As noted
in 31 the identication of distant LRGs with faint radio
sources cannot be done reliably using NVSS data alone Of
the 51 NVSS radio identications without a FIRST cata-
logue match we therefore chose to accept as genuine IDs
the 22 galaxies which had a weak source visible in FIRST
images at  3 where  is the local rms noise level in the
FIRST image and within 3 arcsec of the optical 2SLAQ
position This is a conservative approach aimed at maximiz-
ing the reliability of our 2SLAQ radio IDs and we recognize
that it may have a small eect on the completeness of our
radio sample as discussed in 352

35 Reliability and completeness of the nal radio
351 Reliability
The great majority of the galaxies in Table 3 81 are as-
sociated with singlecomponent FIRST sources and Monte
Carlo tests show that these can be identied with a high
degree of reliability fewer than 1 will be chance asso-
ciations of unrelated objects For galaxies with multiple
FIRST components which are accepted on the basis on vi-
sual inspection the reliability should also be high Best et
al 2005a assumed their visual analysis to be 100 reli-
able We therefore estimate that the reliability of our nal
2SLAQ radio sample is at least 98 similar to the overall
reliability of 989 quoted by Best et al 2005a for their
lowerredshift SDSS sample
Figure 6 Log N  log S plot for the nal 2SLAQ radio sample

tribution and the vertical dashed line indicates the ux density
limit of 28 mJy used in calculating the radio luminosity function

from Hopkins et al 2003 scaled by an arbitrary factor of 005 in
dNdS for ease of comparison Note that the values of dNdS in
this plot are dierential source counts and we chose not to follow
the radio convention of dividing by a Euclidean slope of S25
352 Completeness
In assessing the overall completeness of our nal radio sam-
ple we need to examine the completeness of both the optical
and the radio samples Only a subset of the 2SLAQ LRG
photometric catalogue was observed spectroscopically but
we can account for this by calculating the eective area of
sky covered by the 2dF spectroscopic sample as described
in 51 For the luminosity function calculations presented
in 5 the only remaining incompleteness on the optical side
comes from the small fraction of galaxies for which the mea-
sured redshift is unreliable ie objects with Q2 in Table
3 Of the radiodetected LRGs in Table 1 378391 have a
reliable 2dF redshift so the spectroscopic incompleteness of
our sample is about 3
On the radio side the NVSS catalogue is essentially
complete for radio sources with ux densities above 28 mJy
as can be seen from Figure 32 of Condon et al 1998
This is supported by the number counts of 2SLAQ radio
sources shown in Figure 6 which account for roughly 5
of all 14 GHz radio sources in the uxdensity range 28
500 mJy based on the source counts presented by Hopkins
et al 2003 Below the NVSS completeness limit of 28 mJy
the number counts in Figure 6 start to fall o and our ra-
dio sample becomes seriously incomplete reecting the well-
known incompleteness of the FIRST catalogue for faint ex-
tended radio sources
Our decision to reject candidate NVSS IDs for which
we could nd no corresponding source at the 3 level in the
FIRST images see 332 may also aect the completeness

level of our nal sample If all 15 of the rejected NVSS ob-
jects with ux density above 28 mJy are actually genuine
IDs and should have been included in our sample this would
represent a radio incompleteness of 2
As discussed in 5 we set a radio uxdensity limit of
28 mJy in our calculation of the radio luminosity function If
the NVSS catalogue is essentially complete above this limit
then the overall incompleteness of our 2SLAQ radio sample
is roughly 5 ie 3 spectroscopic incompleteness plus
up to 2 incompleteness in the radio catalogue for sources
with radio ux densities above 28 mJy We therefore esti-
mate that our sample of 2SLAQ radio galaxies is at least
95 complete and 98 reliable down to the magnitude and
uxdensity limits used for the luminosity function calcula-
tions in 5
4 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LRG
RADIOGALAXY POPULATION
41 Physical mechanisms for the radio emission
In the 2SLAQ redshift range 04  z  08 even the weak-
est radio sources in the FIRST and NVSS catalogues will
have radio luminosities above 1024 W Hz1 In the local uni-
verse radio sources above this level are almost invariably
associated with active galactic nuclei AGN rather than
starforming galaxies Condon 1992 Sadler et al 2002 Best
et al 2005a Since the photometric selection of the 2SLAQ
LRG sample also excludes galaxies with ongoing star forma-
tion we expect all the radio galaxies identied in Table 3 to
be powered by an AGN
42 Redshift and luminosity distribution
The radio galaxies in the 2SLAQ LRG sample are signif-
icantly more luminous than the 2SLAQ LRG sample as a
whole as can be seen from Table 4 This is not unexpected
since the probability that an earlytype galaxy will be a
radio galaxy is known to rise sharply with optical luminos-

Figure 7 The mean redshift of 2SLAQ radio galaxies as a func-
tion of radio power Crosses show individual radio sources while
the lled circles and solid line show the mean redshift for each of
the 04 dex bins in log P used to calculate the radio luminosity
function The error bars show the standard error on the mean for
each bin and the horizontal dashed line is the mean redshift for
the full 2SLAQ LRG spectroscopic sample
ity Auriemma et al 1977 Sadler Jenkins  Kotanyi 1989
Best et al 2005b
Figures 7 and 8 show that the 2SLAQ radio sample is
close to volumelimited with no strong correlation between
either absolute magnitude or radio luminosity and redshift
In particular Figure 7 shows that the mean redshift of the
2SLAQ radio galaxies is almost independent of their radio
luminosity making this an excellent sample for measuring
the radio luminosity function The smaller number of low
power  10248 W Hz1 radio galaxies at redshifts above
z  06 is due to the uxdensity limit of the NVSS and
FIRST catalogues and causes the mean redshift to drop
slightly at the lowest radio luminosities This ux limit is
taken into account when calculating the radio luminosity
function and so does not aect the sample completeness
Figure 8 shows the relatively sharp cuto in absolute
magnitude M02r caused by the i  198 mag cuto of the
2SLAQ LRG sample Although the 2SLAQ LRGs span a
wide range almost three orders of magnitude in radio lu-
minosity their range in optical luminosity is much narrower
corresponding to only one order of magnitude roughly 2
20 L
Since Wake et al 2006 nd no evolution in the number
density of these bright LRGs over the redshift range 0  z 
06 beyond that expected from the passive evolution of their
stellar population it is straightforward to match the 2SLAQ
sample with local earlytype galaxies of similar luminosity
in order to study the evolution of their radio properties
Sadler et al

radio galaxies over the redshift range of the sample The absolute
magnitudes M02r are those dened by Wake et al 2006 and

if redshifted to z  02 and observed through an SDSS r-band
lter Filled circles show galaxies from Sample 8 see Figure 1
and open circles galaxies from Sample 9
43 Optical emission lines
431 The fraction of galaxies with optical emission lines
We visually inspected all the spectra of radiodetected
2SLAQ galaxies to check for the presence of optical emission
lines Where seen this is noted in Table 3 In most cases the
only detected emission line is O II at 3727A which is seen
in 27 of 2SLAQ radio galaxies Thus like most lowpower
radio galaxies in the local universe Owen Ledlow  Keel
1995 the majority of 2SLAQ radio galaxies do not show
strong optical emission lines and would not have been rec-
ognized as AGN on the basis of their optical spectra alone
432 O II emission
The 3727A O II emission line can be excited both by star
forming regions and by an AGN but it can also occur when
neither of these is present through photoionization by the
old hot postAGB stars which should exist in all luminous
earlytype galaxies Bressan et al 1994 As a result de-
tection of the O II line alone gives little or no useful infor-
mation about either the ionization state of the gas or the
dominant physical process responsible for ionizing it
Measurement of the observed ratios of other common
emission lines such as H H O III and N II eg Veil-
lueux  Osterbrock 1987 can distinguish starforming
galaxies from those in which the gas is ionized by an AGN
but such measurements are not possible for most of the
LRGs in our 2SLAQ sample because the relevant emission
lines are redshifted out of the 2dF spectral range
433 Ne III and Ne V emission lines
Thirteen of the galaxies in Table 3 34 of the radio sample
show both strong O II emission lines and weaker emission
lines of Ne III 3869 A andor Ne V 3426 A as seen in Fig-
ure 2c The presence of these additional highexcitation
emission lines strongly suggests that the dominant ionizing
source in these particular galaxies is an active nucleus
The fraction of radiodetected LRGs with detected
Ne III and Ne V emission lines though low is signicantly
higher than in the 2SLAQ LRG sample as a whole We esti-
mate that only 04  02 of a sample of 744 goodquality
2SLAQ LRG spectra show visible Ne III and Ne V emis-
sion lines so the line is roughly eight times more common in
the radiodetected subsample than in the LRG population
as a whole We stress once again however that the major-
ity of the lowpower radio galaxies in the 2SLAQ sample are
optically normal and do not show strong optical emission
lines in their spectra
434 Comparison with the full 2SLAQ LRG sample
As noted by Roseboom et al 2006 the relatively low SN
of the 2SLAQ spectra makes it dicult to measure the equiv-
alent widths of weak emission lines accurately They there-
fore used a cuto in O II emissionline equivalent width of
8 A to dene an emissionline LRG and found that 15
of the 2SLAQ LRGs lay above this cuto
Our visual classication of emissionline galaxies in Ta-
ble 3 selects objects with almost exactly the same range
in O II equivalent width as the em and ema galaxies
discussed by Roseboom et al 2006 For a sample of 162
galaxies in common 2426 92 of the Roseboom et al
2006 objects with O II EW80A are listed by us as hav-
ing O II emission compared to only 11136 8 of the
EW 80A objects If we drop the equivalent width cuto
to 70 A the agreement is even better with 93 of galax-
ies above the cuto and only 5 of those below the cuto
classifed in Table 3 as showing O II emission
The fraction of galaxies with O II emission in the full
sample of 5697 2SLAQ LRGs measured by Roseboom et al
2006 is 151 if we adopt an EW cuto of 8 A and 177
for an EW cuto of 7 A This is lower than the 27 O II
detection rate for the 2SLAQ radio galaxies in Table 3 but
the dierence needs to be assessed carefully The emission
line luminosity of elliptical and S0 galaxies correlates with
absolute magnitude in the sense that luminous galaxies are
more likely than smaller galaxies to show emission lines in
their spectra Phillips et al 1986 To compare the emission
line properties of 2SLAQ radio galaxies with those of the full
LRG sample therefore we need to compare sets of objects
which are carefully matched in optical luminosity Such a
comparison is outside the scope of the present paper but
will be included in a later paper in this series

5 THE RADIO LUMINOSITY FUNCTION AT
OF LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES AT Z04
51 Area covered by the 2SLAQ spectroscopic
As discussed by Cannon et al 2006 the spectroscopic cov-
erage of the 2SLAQ LRG sample is not uniform and has
both overlapping elds and gaps on the sky Determining
the total area of sky covered by the 2SLAQ spectroscopic
sample is therefore a necessary rst step in measuring the
radio luminosity function
Cannon et al 2006 estimated the eective area of the
2SLAQ LRG spectroscopic survey as 135 deg2 for Sample
8 and 90 deg2 for Sample 9 based on the number of galax-
ies observed and their surface density on the sky Since an
accurate measurement of eective area is crucial to the nor-
malization of the measured radio luminosity function we
have recalculated the 2SLAQ LRG survey area using the
same methodology applied by Wake et al 2006 to calcu-
late the optical luminosity function for the 2SLAQ LRGs
Both the completeness and the area were calculated us-
ing a mask which is constructed by repeatedly running the
2dF congure program on a random distribution of points
in one eld This creates a random catalogue of roughly 5
million points with a distribution covering all the possible
positionings of a 2dF bre A random catalogue for the entire
survey was then constructed by placing this single random
2df eld distribution at every eld centre which was observed
in the survey Regions which are not in the input catalogue
were removed since the edges of some of our elds lay out-
side the region covered by the input catalogue This nal
random catalogue contained about 400 million data points
The nal mask was based on a grid with 3030 arcsec
pixels covering the whole survey area Those pixels which
contained at least one random point were agged and the
mask was used to calculate both the area and the complete-
ness To calculate the area we simply summed the pix-
els which were agged as containing a random point this
yielded a total area of 1862 deg2 To determine the com-
pleteness we divided the number of LRGs with a redshift
in the masked region by the number of LRGs from the in-
put catalogue in the masked region This allows calculation
of the eective area for each spectroscopic sample which is
simply the total area multiplied by the completeness For
galaxies with spectra whose quality is good enough to mea-
sure a reliable redshift Q3 we calculate an eective area
of 1417 deg2 for Sample 8 and 935 deg2 for Sample 9 These
are roughly 45 higher than the values estimated by Can-
non et al 2006
In this study we must also account for the small fraction
of the 2SLAQ survey area mostly at low Galactic latitude
for which radio data from the FIRST survey are not avail-
able For the 2SLAQ spectroscopic sample 17 of galaxies
in Sample 8 and 45 of galaxies in Sample 9 lie outside the
region of sky covered by the FIRST source catalogue The
smaller overlap between FIRST and Sample 9 is because
more of the Sample 9 elds are at lower galactic latitude
than the region covered by FIRST After accounting for the
area not covered by FIRST we have a nal eective area of
1393 deg2 and 893 deg2 for Samples 8 and 9 respectively

Radiogalaxy evolution to z  07
52 Calculation of the radio luminosity function
We derived the radio luminosity function for 2SLAQ LRGs
by applying the 1Vmax method Schmidt 1968 to the 251
2SLAQ LRGs which belong to Sample 8 or 9 and have a
14 GHz ux density of 28 mJy or more We calculated Vmax
for each object using the maximum and minimum redshift
limits at which each object could be placed and still sat-
isfy both the optical and radio selection criteria of our sam-
ple The upper and lower redshift limits set by the optical
colour and magnitude cutos for the 2SLAQ sample were
calculated using the same method as Wake et al 2006 for
their calculation of the optical luminosity function while
the radio upper limits were set by the redshift at which each
source fell below the 28 mJy ux limit there is no lower
redshift limit for our radio selection criteria The value of
Vmaxi adopted for the ith sample galaxy is

53 Evolution of the radiogalaxy population to
z 07
531 Comparison with the local radiogalaxy population
We can now determine the evolution of the radiogalaxy
population out to z  07 by comparing the 2SLAQ radio
luminosity function with the RLF of similar galaxies in the
local universe For our local benchmark we need a large
uniform survey which covers a large volume at z  0 so
that evolutionary eects within the sample volume can be
neglected
We chose to use as our comparison sample the large
dataset of nearby radio galaxies identied by Mauch 
Sadler 2006 from the second data release of the 6dF
Galaxy Survey 6dFGS Jones et al 2004 The 6dFGS
DR2 contains spectra of about 45000 galaxies brighter than
K1275 mag in the nearinfrared Kband and the 6dFGS
radio galaxies identied by Mauch  Sadler span the red-
shift range 0  z  015 with a median redshift of 0073
The large sample volume  39  108 Mpc3 and shallow
depth of the 6dFGS survey allow us to derive an accurate
z  0 radio luminosity function with which to compare our
2SLAQ results
We note that passive evolution of the optical luminos-
ity function of luminous red galaxies over the redshift range
0  z  07 has little eect on the results of this study
since radio galaxies are known to be almost exclusively as-
sociated with the most massive and luminous galaxies at
all redshifts out to z  5 RoccaVolmerange et al 2004
However we have corrected the optical luminosities of the
2SLAQ galaxies to their equivalent value at z  02 using
the same correction factors for passive evolution as Wake et
al 2006 The values of M02r for 2SLAQ LRGs in this pa-
per should dier by less than 01 mag from the Mr values
measured for similar galaxies at z  0

is close to 05 consistent with the two samples being essentially complete and volumelimited

Since the 2SLAQ LRG sample eectively excludes
galaxies with absolute magnitudes fainter than M02r 
220 we also chose to compare the 2SLAQ RLF with
a local RLF calculated for a sample with a similar cuto
in optical luminosity The optical luminosity function for
6dFGS galaxies Jones et al 2006 has M
r210 mag and
K238 mag so we adopted a cuto in absolute magni-
tude of MK  248 mag ie one magnitude brighter than
K for our local sample in order to match the luminosity
cuto of the 2SLAQ sample as closely as possible In prac-
tice since the probability that an earlytype galaxy will be a
radio galaxy rises very sharply with optical luminosity this
luminosity cut has almost no eect on the measured RLF
for local galaxies  only six of the 337 6dFGS radio galaxies
with radio luminosities P14  10242 W Hz1 are excluded
by our cuto in MK
Figure 9 compares the 6dFGS and 2SLAQ RLFs for
the range in radio luminosity for which they overlap The
2SLAQ RLF is higher than the local value at all luminosi-
ties but the dierence is most striking for the most powerful
radio galaxies in our sample This can be seen more clearly
in Figure 10 which plots the ratio of the space densities of
2SLAQ and 6dFGS radio galaxies Figure 10 strongly sug-
gests that lowpower radio galaxies undergo cosmic evolu-
tion though their evolution is less dramatic than that seen
in powerful radio galaxies
532 The redshift evolution of lowpower radio galaxies
The redshift evolution of a galaxy population can be inves-
tigated by comparing the measured luminosity function of
the same population at two or more epochs Any shift in the
luminosity function is usually represented by one of two sim-
ple extremes luminosity evolution in which the luminosity
functions are matched by shifting one of them horizontally
and density evolution in which the shift is vertical These
alternatives are equally plausible for a pure powerlaw lumi-
nosity function but can in principle be distinguished if the
log10P14 W Hz1

LRGs lled circles compared with the observed local RLF mea-

The dashed line shows a parametric t to the 6dFGS RLF over
the luminosity range 1022 to 1026 W Hz1
luminosity function undergoes a change in slope at some
luminosity
As noted by Peacock 1999 the physical motivation for
either of these descriptions is weak Both luminosity and
density evolution assume that the overall shape of the lumi-
nosity function remains the same at all epochs which may
not be the case Luminosity evolution suggests a population
whose overall luminosity declines with time while density
evolution implies a set of objects which have constant lu-
minosity but a range of lifetimes It is likely that neither of

Radiogalaxy evolution to z  07
Figure 10 Ratio of the radio luminosity functions measured

values set by the error bars on the two RLFs

LRGs open circles and 6dFGS galaxies lled circles at the
current epoch where the equivalent luminosity function at z0
has been derived by dividing the observed luminosity function of
each sample by 1z20
these simple models completely describes the physical pro-
cesses which actually occur Our main goal in this paper
however is to determine whether lowpower radio galaxies
evolve with redshift and even a simple parameterization of
the luminosity function is an adequate tool for testing this
To quantify the evolution of lowpower radio galaxies
we follow earlier studies in assuming that the redshift de-
pendance can be represented by pure luminosity evolution
of the form
P z  P 01  zKL
Boyle et al 1988 We then nd the best-tting value for KL
by dividing the radio power of each galaxy by 1  zKL for
0  KL  10 and minimising the 2 value from the rebinned
local and 2SLAQ RLFs for each KL Error estimates are
determined by computing the value of KL for which 2 
min  1 which is equivalent to 1 Lampton Margon
 Bowyer 1976 The t of KL was only made for P 
10258 W Hz1 to avoid contamination by the more strongly
evolving highpower radio galaxies in the 2SLAQ sample
The best tting value for KL is 20  03 which implies
that lowpower radio galaxies in the redshift range probed
by the 2SLAQ sample are signicantly more luminous than
those in the local sample The hypothesis that lowpower
radio galaxies undergo no cosmic evolution can be ruled out
at the 67 level Figure 11 shows the 6dFGS and 2SLAQ
RLFs shifted to redshift z0 assuming the tted form for
the evolution
In summary we nd that lowpower radio galaxies with
P14  1025 W Hz1 undergo signicant cosmic evolution
over the redshift range 0  z  07 Our observations are

533 The redshift evolution of powerful radio galaxies
Although the number of powerful radio galaxies in our
2SLAQ sample is relatively small there is some evidence
that they undergo more dramatic evolution than their lower
power counterparts Figure 10 implies that the number den-
sity of the most powerful P14  1026 W Hz1 radio galax-
ies in our sample could be at least ten times higher at
z  055 than in the local universe though this is highly
uncertain because of the small number of objects observed
in this luminosity range The 6dFGS radiogalaxy sample
covers a volume of 39  108 Mpc3 ie almost four times
the 2SLAQ volume but has only four galaxies with radio
luminosity above 1026 W Hz1 whereas the smaller 2SLAQ
volume contains at least ten radio galaxies more powerful
than 1026 W Hz1 We therefore stress that the small num-
ber of powerful radio galaxies seen at low redshift is not a
volume eect
If we assume the same luminosity evolution of the form
1z2 which ts the lowpower sample then the obser-
vation of four P14  10260 W Hz1 radio galaxies in the
6dFGS volume implies that we would expect to see 123 ra-
dio galaxies with P14  102632 W Hz1 in the 2SLAQ sam-
ple volume Five are actually observed so Poisson statistics
imply a probability of 07 that the dierence is due to
chance If we also take into account the formal uncertainty
in the four highpower 6dFGS sources then the signicance
level drops to 34 The small number of very powerful
radio galaxies in the 6dFGS and 2SLAQ samples therefore
Sadler et al
limits what we can say about their cosmic evolution at this
stage We note however that the observed number of pow-
erful  1026 W Hz1 radio galaxies in the 2SLAQ sample
is consistent with a population undergoing the kind of rapid
density evolution reported by Willott et al 2001 who
found an increase of 3 dex in the space density of the most
powerful radio galaxies over the redshift range 0  z  2
This implies a number density increasing as approximately
1z6 ie ten times as many radio galaxies at powers above
1026 in the 2SLAQ sample at z  055 as in the 6dFGS at
z  007 which is close to the value seen in Figure 10
6 DISCUSSION
61 Environment of the 2SLAQ radio galaxies
As discussed briey in 322 radiosource statistics suggest
that many of the 2SLAQ galaxies lie in highlyclustered en-
vironments The 2SLAQ sample also contains at least two
z  05 headtail radio galaxies J135058430036335
and J143432650104573 in Table 3 which are often trac-
ers of highredshift rich clusters eg Blanton et al 2003
The clustering properties of the overall 2SLAQ LRG
sample have recently been studied by Ross et al 2006
who note that the 2SLAQ spectroscopic sample is biased
against close 30 arcsec pairs of galaxies because of the
minimum bre separation set by the 2dF positioner the
so-called bre collision problem In general the 2SLAQ
spectroscopic catalogue omits about 65 of objects which
are within 30 arcsec of another 2SLAQ galaxy about half
of those within 1 arcmin and virtually none of those with
separations larger than about 3 arcmin Figure 12 shows an
example of a pair of 2SLAQ radio galaxies which are almost
certainly members of a cluster at z  06 In this case the
angular separation is just over 30 arcsec and both galaxies
were observed spectroscopically The velocity dierence be-
tween these two radio galaxies is 420 km s1 typical of the
velocity dispersion of galaxies in a modest-sized cluster or
large galaxy group
62 The twopoint correlation function for
2SLAQ radio galaxies
We investigated the clustering properties of the 2SLAQ ra-
dio galaxies in a more quantitative way by calculating the
redshiftspace twopoint correlation function between the
2SLAQ radio galaxies and the full LRG sample The trian-
gular points in Figure 13 show the measured redshiftspace
correlation s between 303 Sample 8 radio galaxies from
Table 3 and a set of 8656 LRGs which are also in Sam-
ple 8 Further details of the calculations and sample de-
nition are given by Ross et al 2006 The dashed line in
Figure 13 is the 2SLAQ LRG autocorrelation measured by
Ross et al 2006 and the solid line shows the result for
the lowerredshift SDSS LRGs from Zehavi et al 2005 on
intermediate-scales and Eisenstein et al 2005 at the large-
scales
As discussed by Ross et al 2006 the 2SLAQ LRG
measurements lie below the SDSS LRG line This should not
necessarily be taken as evidence of evolution in the clustering
properties of LRGs Although the SDSS LRG survey is at

lower redshift than 2SLAQ it has stricter colour selection
criteria and so excludes many of the bluer less luminous
LRGs which are present in the 2SLAQ sample The SDSS
LRGs may therefore appear more clustered simply because
they are on average more luminous and hence more biased
than the 2SLAQ LRGs
Interestingly the 2SLAQ radio galaxies have a cluster-
ing strength which is higher than the 2SLAQ LRG popula-
tion as a whole but lower than the SDSS LRGs There is no
a priori reason to expect that radio galaxies will be clustered
dierently from other luminous earlytype galaxies Ledlow
 Owen 1995 showed that the probability of a luminous
earlytype galaxy hosting a radio source is unaected by
its clustering environment and Blake  Wall 2002 found
that the angular clustering of NVSS radio sources is similar
to that of the general galaxy population We have shown in
Table 4 that the 2SLAQ radio galaxies are signicantly more
luminous than the 2SLAQ LRG population as a whole It
therefore seems likely that the higher clustering strength of
the 2SLAQ radio galaxies can be explained simply by their
higher luminosity though it would be interesting to test this
more explicitly
63 Lowpower radio galaxies and the FR III
The lowestpower radio galaxies in our 2SLAQ sample have
radio luminosities similar to those of FR I radio galaxies in
the local universe see Figure 14 The currentlyavailable
FIRST and NVSS radio images do not have high-enough
resolution and sensitivity to allow one to distinguish reli-
ably between FR I and FR II morphologies for most radio
galaxies in the 2SLAQ sample At this stage therefore it is
unclear whether the dierent rates of cosmic evolution which
we nd for lowpower and highpower radio galaxies rep-
resent dierences between the FR I and FR II radiogalaxy
populations or simply a general tendency for more luminous
radio galaxies to undergo more rapid luminosity evolution
Deeper highresolution radio observations of the galaxies in
Table 3 are needed to address this question further
64 AGN heating and the evolution of massive
galaxies
Feedback from AGN heating and specically mechanical
heating of the interstellar gas by radio jets is a recent ad-
dition to hierarchical models for the formation of massive
galaxies eg Croton et al 2006 Bower et al 2006 In these
models re-heating of cooling gas by an AGN prevents low
redshift star formation from occurring in massive earlytype
galaxies making it possible for hierarchical models to repro-
duce the observed colours and luminosity function of early
type galaxies
Best et al 2006 recently derived an empirical con-
version between the observed radio luminosity of an AGN
and the mechanical energy input into the parent galaxy
and found that the total energy input scaled roughly as
P0401 where P is the total radio luminosity If this is
correct then the global rate of AGN heating in the local
universe is dominated by the contribution of lowluminosity
1022 P14  1024 W Hz1 radio galaxies since these make
up the great majority of radio-loud AGN

Radiogalaxy evolution to z  07
Figure 14 Comparison of 14 GHz radio luminosity and rband
absolute magnitude for 2SLAQ radio galaxies The dashed line
represents the division between local FR I and FRII radio galaxies
found by Ledlow  Owen 1996 with FR II radio galaxies lying
above the line and FR Is below
Our results imply that the lowpower radio galaxies as-
sociated with LRGs in the local universe would typically
have been at least twice as powerful at z05 and by extrap-
olation perhaps ve times as powerful at z  1 If the same
kind of evolution also occurs for radio galaxies weaker than
those observed here then the total energy input from AGN
heating in massive earlytype galaxies would have been up
to 50 higher at z  05 than in the local universe and
perhaps twice as high at  1
65 Eects of the 2SLAQ colour and luminosity
The rate of cosmic evolution measured for lowpower ra-
dio galaxies in this study is a lower limit since the 2SLAQ
LRG sample has a strict colour cuto as plotted in Fig-
ure 1 whereas no such colour restriction was applied to the
local 6dFGS radio galaxies If there were an additional
population of blue radio galaxies at redshift z  055 they
might be removed by the 2SLAQ colour selection and so
missed from our analysis Figure 15 plots the parameter
cpar  07g  r  12r  i  018 against redshift for
our radiogalaxy sample as well as the full 2SLAQ LRG
sample Any recent or on-going star formation would scat-
ter LRGs to lower values of cpar in this plot as discussed
by Cannon et al 2006 and Roseboom et al 2006 Well
over 90 of 2SLAQ radio galaxies lie close to the locus of
passivelyevolving galaxies seen in the main 2SLAQ LRG
sample suggesting that they have undergone little or no re-
cent star formation
Cannon et al 2006 have pointed out that the highest
redshift z  065 2SLAQ LRGs have a bimodal distribu-
tion in cpar and attribute this to latertype luminous galax-

LRG sample small dots and the 2SLAQ radio galaxies large
lled circles The horizontal line at cpar  16 marks the expected
division between passive red and starforming blue galaxies
in this redshift range and the box marked by dotted lines at
z  065 and cpar  20 is the region identied by Cannon et al
as containing a population of latertype highredshift galaxies
with recent star formation
ies with recent star formation which have spilled across the
colourselection boundary The region occupied by these ob-
jects is shown in Figure 15 Radio galaxies with ongoing star
formation should also be easy to identify in this region but
very few are seen fewer than 5 of 2SLAQ radio galaxies lie
near the cpar boundary in Figure 15 We therefore estimate
that only a small number of starforming radio galaxies are
being excluded from our sample by the 2SLAQ colour cuts
A second consideration is the cuto in optical luminos-
ity set by the 2SLAQ i  198 magnitude limit for 2dF spec-
troscopy The eect of this is to set a fairly sharp boundary
in at Mr  220 as can be seen in Figure 14 This corre-
sponds to a lower limit of about 21011 M in stellar mass if
we adopt the values of log MLr  06 used by Kaumann
et al 2003
In the local universe as discussed in 531 this cuto
would have little or no eect on measurements of the radio
luminosity function This is conrmed by the recent work
of Best et al 2005b who nd that fewer than 1 of SDSS
galaxies with stellar masses below 2  1011 M host a radio
loud AGN even at radio luminosities an order of magnitude
lower than those considered here At z  055 however this
is not necessarily the case and it is possible that galaxies
below the 2SLAQ cuto in optical luminosity could host sig-
nicant numbers of radio galaxies Because of this caveat
we stress that the radio luminosity functions derived in this
paper apply to optically bright earlytype galaxies If less
luminous galaxies also contribute signicantly to the radio
luminosity function in the 2SLAQ redshift range then the
overall rate of cosmic evolution in the radiogalaxy popula-
tion would be even higher than the values derived in 53
7 SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK
The main results of this study are
 We have measured an accurate radio luminosity func-
tion for luminous earlytype galaxies in the redshift range
04  z  07 and compared this with the radio luminosity
function for the same population in the local universe This
allows us to measure the cosmic evolution of AGN-related
radio emission in a single well-dened galaxy population
 We nd clear evidence that lowpower radio galaxies
ie those in the luminosity range covered by local FR I radio
galaxies undergo signicant cosmic evolution over the red-
shift range 0  z  07 This evolution is welltted by pure
luminosity evolution of the form 1zk where k2003
for galaxies with radio luminosities between 1024 and 1026
W Hz1 The overall rate of evolution may be higher than
this if some lowpower radio galaxies at z  055 have been
excluded by the i  198 mag cuto of the 2SLAQ spectro-
scopic sample
 The most powerful radio galaxies in our sample those
with 14 GHz radio powers above 1026 W Hz1 may evolve
more rapidly than lowerluminosity radio galaxies over the
redshift range 0  z  07
 The radio detection rate is highest for the most lumi-
nous 2SLAQ LRGs and the median absolute magnitude of
our radiogalaxy sample is 04 mag brighter than that of the
2SLAQ LRG population as a whole
 The 2SLAQ radio galaxies are more strongly clustered
than the overall 2SLAQ LRG sample possibly because they
are on average more luminous
 Most 2SLAQ radio galaxies show no obvious emission
lines in their optical spectra The fraction showing 3727A
O II emission is slightly higher than in the 2SLAQ LRG
sample as a whole this but this may be due to the higher
optical luminosity of the radiogalaxy subsample and a more
detailed analysis is needed About 3 of the 2SLAQ radio
galaxies show highionization emission lines of 3426A Ne V
andor 3870A Ne III
This paper presents a rst analysis of the evolving
radiogalaxy population out to z  07 A second paper
Johnston et al 2007 in preparation will study the stellar
populations of radioloud LRGs in the 2SLAQ survey Fur-
ther radio observations of the 2SLAQ area would be valu-
able both at higher spatial resolution to test whether the
FR IFR II divide seen in Figure 14 evolves with redshift
and to fainter ux limits to probe further down the radio
luminosity function Since the 2SLAQ survey also targeted
QSOs over a redshift range which overlaps that covered by
the LRG survey a comparison of the relative numbers of ra-
dio galaxies and radioloud QSOs in the same redshift range
would give a useful test of the unied model for radioloud
The new 2dF AAOmega spectrograph recently commis-
sioned at the AngloAustralian Telescope has signicantly
higher eciency than the system used for the 2SLAQ sur-
vey and now makes it possible to extend the 2SLAQ LRG
ccid13 2006 RAS MNRAS 000 1
survey to higher redshifts andor larger samples In partic-
ular a large spectroscopic redshift survey of LRGs out to
z  1 appears to be feasible in the near future
New radio surveys will be needed to identify and study
lowpower radio galaxies beyond z  07 in conjunction
with the new generation of large-area spectroscopic surveys
though the existing FIRST and NVSS surveys will still be
able to detect many of the most powerful radio galaxies out
to z  1 A new radio survey would ideally be able to de-
tect sources well below 1 mJy over a wide area of sky at
least 50 square degrees and achieve both good positional
accuracy and good surfacebrightness sensitivity While this
is time-consuming at present it should be easier when new
wideband correlators come into use at both the Australia
Telescope Compact Array ATCA and the VLA over the
next few years
