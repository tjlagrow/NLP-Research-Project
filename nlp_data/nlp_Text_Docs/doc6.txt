Fuzzy Modeling and Natural Language 
Processing for Paninis Sanskrit Grammar 
P Venkata Subba Reddy 
AbstractIndian  languages  have  long  history  in World  Natural  languages  Panini  was the  first  to  define  Grammar  for  San-
skrit language with about 4000 rules in fifth century These rules contain uncertainty information It is not possible to Comput-
er processing of Sanskrit language with uncertain information  In this paper fuzzy logic and fuzzy reasoning are proposed to 
deal  to  eliminate  uncertain  information  for  reasoning  with  Sanskrit  grammar  The  Sanskrit  language  processing  is  also  dis-
cussed in this paper

1  INTRODUCTION
Computer languages are defined based on particular 
grammar for example C Pascal etc Computer processing 
of natural languages has become an application area such 
as  natural  language  processing  Machine  translation 
etcNatural  languages  are  to  be  defined  with  the  gram-
Panini  defined  Sanskrit  grammar  with  4000  rules 
long  back  in  sixth  century  BC  4  The  rules  of  Paninis 
Sanskrit  grammar 
contain  uncertainty  Computer 
processing of this grammar is very difficult unless uncer-
tainty  is  eliminated  There  are  many  logics  available  to 
deal  with  uncertainty  like  fuzzy  logic  probabilistic  logic 
Where  is union 
For instance x is Tall is defined as 
Tall  Tallx 0 1 where Tall is fuzzy set 
Tall  056x1  06x2  065x3  067x4  069x5 
The combination of Fuzzy sets are given as follows 
AB  min Ax Bxx disjunction 
AVB    max Ax Bxx conjunction 
  A      1 - Axx negation 
A  B max 1 - Ax Bxx implication 
Ax y Ax X  Byxy  minAx X  Byxy 
A  o  R    max  Ax  Ax  yx    where  Rx  y  is  Fuzzy 
relation and o is composition 
The  propositions  may  contain  quantifiers  Square  opera-
tor  is  used  for  very  most  concentration  The  square 
root operator is used for more or less diffusion 
For instance 
very youngx   youngx2 
notvery youngx   1-youngx2 
more or less youngx  youngx12 
           Fuzzy  reasoning8  is  a  drawing  conclusion  from 
Fuzzy  propositions  using  fuzzy  inference  rules  Some  of 
the Fuzzy inference rules are given bellow  
R1    x is A                               R2 x is A                                    
         x and y are B                   x or y is B                               
                          
The  Fuzzy  set  A  of  X  is  characterized  by  its         
          y is AB                            y is AVB 
membership  function  A    Ax    and  ranging    values  in        
the unit interval  0 1 
R3  x and y are A                   R4 x or y are A    
        y and z are B                      y or z are  B   
        
       
        y and z are B                     x or z are B 
Fuzzy logic and reasoning 7 8 13 14 are discussed 
to  deal  with  uncertainty  in  the  rules  of  Paninis  Sanskrit 
grammar  The  Paninian  approach  to  Natural  Language 
Processing  NLP  is  reviewed  and  compared  with  the 
current  computer-based  understanding  systems  6  12 
15  The  Paninian-style  generative  rules  and  meta-rules 
could assist in further advances in NLP 
2    FUZZY LOGIC 
Zadeh9  proposed  Fuzzy  logic  to  deal  with  Uncertain 
and Incomplete information Here we discuss Fuzzy logic 
briefly  and  later  we  apply  it  for  Paninis  Sanskrit  Gram-
mar 23 
Zadeh9  has introduced Fuzzy set as a model to 
deal    with  imprecise  inconsistent  and  inexact  informa-
tion  Fuzzy  set  is  a  class  of  objects  with  a  continuum  of 
grade of membership   
Ax  X 0 1 x  X  where X is Universe of discourse         
A   Ax 1x1    Ax 2x2       Ax nxn   
        
        R5  x is A 
        if x is A then y is B 
         
        y is A o AB 
3  FUZZY  MODELLING  FOR  PANINIS 
SANSKRIT GRAMMAR 
Grammars  are  defined  to  either  programming 
languages  or  natural  languages  Computer  processing  of 
natural  languages  and  language  translations  is  an  appli-
cation  area  in  the  computer  field  Indian  languages  are 
having long history Panini proposed grammar with 4000 
rules  for  Sanskrit  These  are  categorized  into  different 
sets One of them is Syadvada set The Syadvada set con-
tains seven possibilities they are given below 
1 May be it is Syadasti 
2 May be it is not Sada nasti 
3 May be it is and it is not at different times Syad asti-          
nasti 
4 May be it is and it is not at the same time and is inde-
scribable Syad avaktavya 
5  May  be  it  is  and  yet  indescribable  Syad  asti  avak-
tavya 
6 May be it is not and also indescribable Syad asti nasti 
avaktavya 
7  May be it is and it is not and also indescribable  Syad 
asti nasti avaktavya 
The above rules  contain uncertainty The uncertainty 
has  to  be  eliminated  for  further  computer  processing  of 
the  Sanskrit  language  Fuzzy  logic  can  be  used  to  elimi-
nate  the  uncertainty  The  fuzzy  logic  is  applied  for  the 
above rules to eliminate uncertainty and the rules are giv-
en below 
1  May be it is  Syadasti 
Syadastix  01 
2  May be it is not Syad nasti 
Syad nasti  1 - Syadastix 
3  May be it is and it is not at different times Syad 
asti-nasti 
Syadastix  1 - Syadastix o different times xy 
where  o  is  composition  and  y  is  time  varia-
4  May be it is and it is not at the same time and is 
where t is constant 
5  May be it is and yet indescribable Syad asti 
avaktavya 
Syadastix  different times x12 
where yet is diffusion 
6  May be it is not and also indescribable yad asti 
nasti avaktavya 
1- Syadastix  different times x 
      7      May  be  it  is  and  it  is  not  and  also  indescribable 
Syad asti nasti avaktavya 
This fuzzy represention of the sanskrit sentences shall be 
further used for fuzzy reasoning 7 13 14  16 
Syadastix  1- Syadastix  different times x 
For istance consider two sentences 
May be it is Syadasti 
May  be  it  is  and  it  is  not  at  different  times  Syad  asti-
nasti 
The inference will be given as using R1 
it is not at different times  with the fuzziness   
Syadasti   Syad asti-nasti

puter-assisted instruction are discussed for a computer to
