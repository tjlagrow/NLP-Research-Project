Abstract In this paper we present SABRINA Sentiment Analysis a Broad Re-
source for Italian Natural language Applications a manually annotated prior po-
larity lexical resource for Italian natural language applications in the eld of opin-
ion mining and sentiment induction The resource consists in two different sets
an Italian dictionary of more than 277000 words tagged with their prior polarity
value and a set of polarity modiers containing more than 200 words which can
be used in combination with non neutral terms of the dictionary in order to induce
the sentiment of Italian compound terms To the best of our knowledge this is the
rst prior polarity manually annotated resource which has been developed for the
Italian natural language
Introduction
Sentiment classication 811123 concerns the use of automatic approaches for pre-
dicting the orientation of subjective content on text documents with applications on
many areas including information retrieval customer intelligence and recommender
and advertising systems Such discipline where sentiment opinion or emotion are
identied and classied in human written text is well known as sentiment analysis
With the rapid increase of available subjective text on the internet in the form of blog
posts comments in discussion forums and product reviews mining the users opinion
can assist in a lot of potential applications in areas such as recommender systems search
engines and market research
Although some attempts have been made to extend solutions to other languages till
date all research efforts found in sentiment analysis literature deal mostly with English
texts However in order to identify sentiment from a text a lexical analysis of the source
language plays a crucial role
An approach for detecting sentiment in texts concerns the use of lexical resources
such as a dictionaries of opinionated terms For example the terms love good and fa-
vorite directly indicate a positive sentiment or an opinion while words like hate bad
and scandal can be associated with a negative sentiment

Language Processing and Cognitive Science NLPCS 2015
Among the others SentiWordNet 9 is one of the most used resource contain-
ing opinion information on terms extracted from the WordNet database 13 and made
publicly available for research purposes It is built via a semi supervised method and is
considered a valuable resource for performing opinion mining tasks providing a readily
available database of term sentiment information for the English language
Other previous works 149 have been already proposed for making dictionaries for
those sentiment words using automatic approaches however automatic identication of
polarity orientation of such words is also a difcult research issue known as polar-
ity identication In this context it has been shown that the use of sentiment lexicons
only provide a good baseline ie without using any natural language techniques only
dictionary based approach produce a good performance 7
An alternative to automatic tagged resources are manually annotated lexicons which
turns out to be undoubtedly more trustable although they took long time to be con-
structed and may be subject it annotator bias
In this paper we present SABRINA Sentiment Analysis a Broad Resource for Ital-
ian Natural language Applications a manually annotated prior polarity lexical resource
for Italian natural language applications in the eld of opinion mining and sentiment
induction The resource consists in two different sets an Italian dictionary of more than
277000 words tagged with their prior polarity value and a set of polarity modiers
containing more than 200 words which can be used in combination with non neutral
terms of the dictionary in order to induce the sentiment of Italian compound terms To
the best of our knowledge this is the rst prior polarity manually annotated resource
which has been developed for the Italian natural language
The paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we introduce the concept of prior
and posterior polarity and present some known lexicons which label terms with their
sentiment polarity Then in Section 3 we present the new tagged resources which has
been created for the Italian language and discuss its properties In Section 4 we briey
introduce also a web based fronted for accessing the resources We draw our conclu-
sions in Section 5
2 Prior and Posterior Polarity
A typical computational approach to sentiment analysis starts with prior polarity lexi-
cons where entries are tagged with their prior out of context polarity as human beings
perceive using cognitive knowledge
The prior polarity of a term is the sentiment positive or negative that such word
evokes by itself More specically we could dene the prior polarity of a term as the
polarity for its non-disambiguated meaning out of any context
For example the adjective cold evokes in most cases a fairly negative sentiment
since it is used in sentences as a cold man a cold winter or I feel cold However de-
pending on the context we can nd such term in sentences with a positive acceptation
as in I love cold beer
In contrast with the prior polarity of a word the polarities associated to each word
sense is called in literature posterior polarity
In most cases prior polarity lexicons are lists of positive and negative words of-
ten deployed as baselines or as features for other methods for sentiment analysis re-
search 11 In these lexicon words are associated with their prior polarity For example
it is presumable that the term wonderful is associated with positive connotation while
the term horrible is associated with negative one These approaches have the advantage
of not needing deep semantic analysis or word sense disambiguation to assign an affec-
tive score to a word and are domain independent In other word they are less precise but
more portable
21 Polarity Lexicons
Opinion lexicons are resources that associate sentiment orientation and words Their
use in opinion mining research stems from the hypothesis that individual words can
be considered as a unit of opinion information and therefore may provide clues to
document sentiment and subjectivity These techniques could be broadly categorized in
two genres manual annotation and automatic extraction of word polarity
 Manual annotation Manual annotated lexicons are undoubtedly trustable but it
took long time and for these reasons tend to be constrained to a small number of
terms By its nature building manual lists is a time consuming effort and may be
subject to annotator bias Although such limitations manually created opinion lexi-
cons were applied to sentiment classication as seen in 14 where a prediction of
document polarity is given by counting positive and negative terms
 Automatic detection To overcome the above issues lexical induction approaches
have been proposed in the literature with a view to extend the size of opinion lex-
icons from a core set of seed terms either by exploring term relationships or by
evaluating similarities in document corpora Early work in this area seen in 10 ex-
tends a list of positive and negative adjectives by evaluating conjunctive statements
in a document corpus However in most cases automatic processes still demands
manual validations and moreover may fail to cover the multiple domains as auto-
matic processes trust on specic corpus
SentiWordNet 9 is one of the most popular lexical resources in Sentiment Anal-
ysis It has been widely adopted since it provides a broad-coverage lexicon built in
a semi-automatic manner for English providing posterior polarities scores for each
term of the language It is the result of the automatic annotation of all the synsets of
WordNet 13 according to the notions of positivity negativity and neutrality Different
senses of the same term may thus have different opinion-related properties
However in most opinion mining applications it is necessary to derive prior polar-
ities from the posteriors For this reason several formulae to compute prior polarities
starting from posterior polarities scores have been proposed in the literature However
their performance varies signicantly depending on the adopted variant
For instance SentiWords is an inducted prior polarity lexicon with the higher cover-
age for the English language It contains roughly 155000 words associated with a sen-
timent score included between 1 strongly negative and 1 strongly positive learned
from SentiWordNet Words in this resource are also aligned with WordNet lists
For the sake of completeness we notice also that other prior polarity sentiment lexi-
cons are available for the English language such as Subjectivity Word List 17 Word-
Net Affect list 15 and the Taboadas adjective list 16
Although most of the efforts in literature have been devoted to the construction on
lexicons resource for the English language in recent years some research endeavors
could be found in literature for solving the opinion mining problem in several lan-
guages and domains 7 Until date most of the approaches to sentiment analysis in
languages different from English consists in applying a word-translation from the tar-
get language to English before polarity extraction which is applied by using one of the
above described lexicons Such solutions however presents several problems including
translation precision and disambiguation of words
Recently some efforts have also been made to produce polarity lexicons also for
languages different from English For instance in 6 the authors proposed multiple
computational techniques like WordNet based dictionary based corpus based or gen-
erative approaches for generating SentiWordNet for Indian languages
For the sake of completeness we mention also an interactive gaming approach used
for obtaining polarity values of english words presented in 7 where the authors pro-
posed a tool named Dr Sentiment to create and validate SentiWordNet in 56 languages
by involving Internet population
3 New broad Lexical Resources for the Italian Language
In this section we present SABRINA1 Sentiment Analysis a Broad Resource for Italian
Natural language Applications a manually annotated prior polarity lexical resource
for Italian natural language applications in the eld of opinion mining and sentiment
induction The resource consists in two different sets an Italian dictionary of more than
277000 words tagged with their prior polarity value and a set of polarity modiers
containing more than 200 words which can be used in combination with non neutral
terms of the dictionary in order to induce the sentiment of Italian compound terms
In recent years sentiment analysis in Italian texts has attracted attention due to
Evalita an initiative devoted to the evaluation of Natural Language Processing and
Speech tools for Italian In the recent Evalita 2014 edition the Sentipolc SENTIment
POLarity Classication task2 2 was proposed It focused on Italian texts from Twitter
by launching a battery of related tasks with an increasing level of complexity
A rst automatic annotated lexicon for the Italian language has been developed in
1 where the authors exploited three existing resources namely MultiWordNet 5
SentiWordNet 9 and WordNet 13 to obtain an annotated lexicon of senses for Ital-
ian It was named Sentix and basically port the SentiWordNet annotation to the Italian
1 A tool for evaluating SABRINA is available at the anonymous url httpwwwdmi
unictitfarosabrina Each example which you can nd in this section is tagged
with an anchor which redirect the reader to the web page of the tool in order to evaluate the
sentiment value of the example itself

portion of MultiWordNet in a completely automatic fashion Sentix was then used in
4 where the author described the UNITOR system that participated to the Sentipolc
task within the context of Evalita 2014 The system has been developed as a workow
of Support Vector Machine classiers Specic features and kernel functions have been
used to tackle the different sub-tasks ie Subjectivity Classication Polarity Classi-
cation and the pilot task Irony Detection
To the best of our knowledge besides Sentix SABRINA is the rst prior polarity
manually annotated resource which has been developed for the Italian natural language
Italian Polarity Lexicon
Most sentiment lexicons in literature contain lists of tagged lemmas ie the canonical
form  or dictionary form of a word For instance the lastest version of MultiWordNet
139 contains around 58 000 Italian word senses and 41 500 lemmas organized into
32 700 synsets aligned whenever possible with Princeton WordNet English synsets In
using such kind of resources in sentiment analysis it is necessary to operate a previous
step of sense disambiguation in order to identify the correspondent lemma of a word
Our lexicon contains 277387 words of the Italian language including their inec-
tion used in order to express different grammatical categories such as tense mood
person gender etc For instance the dictionary contains the verb correre to run and
its conjugations correvo correra corressi etc
Such set of words have been manually tagged with their prior polarities The anno-
tation process started from the word set in the Ispell Italian dictionary3 used for spell-
checking purpose Each word of the lexicon has been associated with a polarity in the
range between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates a strongly negative polarity while 1 in-
dicates a very positive polarity Mildly negative or positive opinion polarity have been
tagged respectively with values 05 and 05 In addition terms with a neutral polarity
have been tagged with a value equal to 0
Two human annotators have been involved in the tagging process The whole anno-
tation process took more than three months
Figure 1 shows the polarity distribution of all words of the Italian dictionary We
observed 162000 words which have been tagged with a neutral sentiment polarity
more than 70000 with a negative polarity and more than 43000 words tagged with a
positive polarity
Specically words evoking a negative sentiment are divided in two sets 22651
with a strongly negative polarity and 49074 words with a fairly negative polarity Sim-
ilarly in the case of words evoking a positive sentiment we observed 6739 words with
a strongly positive polarity and 36688 words with a fairly positive polarity Table 1
shows in details the number of words detected for each polarity value together with
the percentage of words detected in each group Notice that more than 40 of words
have been assigned to a polarity values while 58 of words have been assigned with a
neutral polarity

32 Polarity Modiers
An adjective is a word or set of words that modies a noun or a pronoun In most cases
adjectives come before the word they modify Some adjective can modify the polarity
of a noun with a non neutral prior polarity For example the adjective raro rare can
be used in composition with the adjective bellezza beauty to emphasize its positive
meaning a women with a rare beauty Similarly the adjective esiguo scarse can be
used in combination with the noun valore virtue changing its positive polarity in a
negative sentiment a man with scarse virtue
An adverb is a word or set of words that modies verbs adjectives or other ad-
verbs Generally an adverb answers how when where or to what extent an action is
performed or an adjective is applicable In this context some adverbs are able to modify
the sentiment evoked by a verb or by an adjective with non neutral polarity For in-
stance the adverb appena barely can be associated with an adjective in order to reduce
its positive or negative polarity eg barely succeed or barely enthusiast Similarly the
adverb davvero truly can be associated with an adjective like sorprendente amazing
in order to emphasize its positive meaning
In our work we collected a set of more than 200 polarity modier which have been
manually tagged with a proportionality factor ranging between 20 and 20 When
a term with a non neutral polarity x is associated with a modier with a proportionality
factor y we obtain a compound term whose polarity can be estimated as x  y
Depending on the value of such factor we can distinguish four different kind of
modiers
 Emphasize
These modiers have a proportionality factor greater than 10 and when associ-
ated with a term having a non neutral polarity evokes a sentiment which is stronger
than the original one thus they emphasize a positive or negative polarity value

alquanto sgradevole rather unpleasant  15  10  15
grande valore great virtue  18  05  09
 Moderate
These modiers have a proportionality factor greater than 00 and smaller than
10 When associated with a term having a non neutral polarity they result in a
compound term with a moderated sentiment which is weaker than the original one
appena vinto just gained  07  05  035
mediamente brutto ugly on average  05  10  05
breve successo brief success  06  05  03
 Reverse and moderate
This kind of modiers have a proportionality factor greater than 10 and smaller
than 00 When they are associated with a term having a non neutral polarity evoke
a sentiment which is in opposition with the original sentiment but has an absolute
value of polarity which is smaller than the original polarity
poco ragionevole little reasonable  07  05  035
esiguo dolore scarse pain  07  10  07
limitato guadagno limited benet  08  10  08
 Reverse and emphasize
These modiers have a proportionality factor smaller or equal than 10 and if
associated with a term having a non neutral polarity evokes a sentiment which is
stronger than the original one but with an opposite polarity
insufciente prestigio insufcient prestige  12  10  12
minime scomodita minimal inconvenience  10  05  05
scarso valore lacking virtue  12  05  06
In Table 4 some examples of polarity modiers are shown together with their re-
spective proportionality factors
4 A Web Based Frontend
We implemented a simple web based tool in order to access the lexical resource pre-
sented in this paper In order to allow a blind review of the paper we uploaded the tool
in a free hosting server The tool is accessible at the url
httpwwwdmiunictitfarosabrina
The tool allows to evaluate single Italian terms or compound terms where words with
a non neutral polarity are associated with modiers as described above Moreover each

left positive polarity modiers and on the right negative polarity modiers
example which you can nd above in the paper is tagged with an anchor which redirect
the reader to the web page of the tool in order to evaluate the sentiment value of the
example itself
If a whole sentence is tested by the tool containing more than one term with non
neutral prior polarity then a straightforward approach is applied in order to compute
an approximation of the polarity of the whole sentence In particular the set of polarity
values contained in the sentence is arranged from the lowest one to the highest one and
the median of such a set is taken as the polarity value of the whole sentence
Specically the median is the number separating the higher half of the set of polarity
values from the lower half If there is an even number of polarity values then there is
no single middle value Int this cases the median is usually dened to be the mean of
the two middle values
5 Conclusions
In this paper we presented a new lexical resource for the Italian language containing
more than 277000 words which have been manually tagged with their prior polarity
values ie a value indicating the sentiment which such words evoke when are out of
any context We also provide an additional lexical resource containing a set of more
than 200 polarity modiers which can be used for inducing the sentiment polarity of
Italian compound terms Future works will be devoted to test the effectiveness of such
resource in opinion mining task
