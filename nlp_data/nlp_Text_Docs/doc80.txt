Abstract
This paper explores the use of Proposi-
tional Dynamic Logic PDL as a suit-
able formal framework for describing
Sign Language SL the language of
deaf people
in the context of natu-
ral language processing SLs are vi-
sual complete standalone languages
which are just as expressive as oral lan-
guages Signs in SL usually correspond
to sequences of highly specic body
postures interleaved with movements
which make reference to real world ob-
jects characters or situations Here we
propose a formal representation of SL
signs that will help us with the analysis
of automatically-collected hand track-
ing data from French Sign Language
FSL video corpora We further show
how such a representation could help us
with the design of computer aided SL
verication tools which in turn would
bring us closer to the development of an
automatic recognition system for these
languages
Introduction
Sign languages SL the vernaculars of deaf
people are complete rich standalone commu-
nication systems which have evolved in paral-
lel with oral languages Valli and Lucas 2000
However in contrast to the last ones research
in automatic SL processing has not yet man-
aged to build a complete formal denition ori-
ented to their automatic recognition Cuxac
and Dalle 2007 In SL both hands and non-
manual features NMF eg
facial muscles
can convey information with their placements

program
congurations and movements These particu-
lar conditions can dicult the construction of
a formal description with common natural lan-
guage processing NLP methods since the ex-
isting modeling techniques are mostly designed
to work with one-channel sound productions
inherent to oral languages rather than with
the multi-channel partially-synchronized infor-
mation induced by SLs
Our research strives to address the formal-
ization problem by introducing a logical lan-
guage that lets us represent SL from the lowest
level so as to render the recognition task more
approachable For this we use an instance of
a formal logic specically Propositional Dy-
namic Logic PDL as a possible description
language for SL signs
For the rest of this section we will present a
brief introduction to current research eorts in
the area Section 2 presents a general descrip-
tion of our formalism while section 3 shows
how our work can be used when confronted
with real world data Finally section 4 present
our nal observations and future work

11 Current Sign Language Research
Extensive eorts have been made to achieve
ecient automatic capture and representation
of the subtle nuances commonly present in
sign language discourse Ong and Ranganath
2005 Research ranges from the development
of hand and body trackers Dreuw et al 2009
Gianni and Dalle 2009 to the design of high
level SL representation models Lejeune 2004
Lenseigne and Dalle 2006 Linguistic re-
search in the area has focused on the character-
ization of corporal expressions into meaning-
ful transcriptions Dreuw et al 2010 Stokoe
2005 or common patterns across SL Arono
et al 2005 Meir et al 2006 Wittmann
1991 so as to gain understanding of the un-
derlying mechanisms of SL communication
Works like Losson and Vannobel 1998 deal
with the creation of a lexical description ori-
ented to computer-based sign animation Re-
port Filhol 2009 describes a lexical speci-
cation to address the same problem Both pro-
pose a thoroughly geometrical parametric en-
coding of signs thus leaving behind meaning-
ful information necessary for recognition and
introducing data beyond the scope of recog-
nition This complicates the reutilization of
their formal descriptions Besides they dont
take in account the presence of partial informa-
tion Treating partiality is important for us
since it is often the case with automatic tools
that incomplete or unrecognizable information
arises Finally little to no work has been di-
rected towards the unication of raw collected
data from SL corpora with higher level descrip-
tions Dalle 2006
2 Propositional Dynamic Logic for
Propositional Dynamic Logic PDL is a multi-
modal logic rst dened by Fischer and Lad-
ner 1979 It provides a language for describ-
ing programs their correctness and termina-
tion by allowing them to be modal operators
We work with our own variant of this logic
the Propositional Dynamic Logic for Sign Lan-
guage PDLSL which is just an instantiation
of PDL where we take signers movements as
programs
Our sign formalization is based on the ap-
proach of Liddell and Johnson 1989 and Fil-
hol 2008 They describe signs as sequences of
immutable key postures and movement transi-
In general each key posture will be charac-
terized by the concurrent parametric state of
each body articulator over a time-interval For
us a body articulator is any relevant body part
involved in signing The parameters taken in
account can vary from articulator to articula-
tor but most of the time they comprise their
congurations orientations and their place-
ment within one or more places of articulation
Transitions will correspond to the movements
executed between xed postures
21 Syntax
We need to dene some primitive sets that will
limit the domain of our logical language
Denition 21 Sign Language primi-
tives Let BSL  D W R L be the set of
relevant body articulators for SL where D W
R and L represent the dominant weak right
and left hands respectively Both D and W
can be aliases for the right or left hands but
they change depending on whether the signer
is right-handed or left-handed or even depend-
ing on the context
congurations for a hand
dominant or weak hand in the following man-
Let  be the two-dimensional projection of
a human body skeleton seen by the front We
dene the set of places of articulation for SL as

for each   SL  is a sub-plane of  as

Finally let v1 and v2 be any two vectors with
the same origin We denote the rotation angle
between the two as v1v2
Now we dene the set of atomic propositions
that we will use to characterize xed states
and a set of atomic actions to describe move-

graphs representing key postures and transi-
tions states are determined by the values of
their propositions while edges represent sets
of executed movements Here we present only
a small extract of the logic semantics

We also need to dene a structure over se-
quences of states to model internal dependen-
cies between them nevertheless we decided to
omit the rest of our semantics alongside satis-
faction conditions for the sake of readability
3 Use Case Semi-Automatic Sign
Recognition
We now present an example of how we can use
our formalism in a semi-automatic sign recog-
nition system Figure 2 shows a simple module
diagram exemplifying information ow in the
systems architecture We proceed to briey
describe each of our modules and how they
work together
Formul
formulas codify the information tracked in the
previous part Detected movements are inter-
preted as PDLSL actions between states

31 Tracking and Segmentation
The process starts by capturing relevant infor-
mation from video corpora We use an exist-
ing head and hand tracker expressly developed
for SL research Gonzalez and Collet 2011
This tool analyses individual video instances
and returns the frame-by-frame positions of
the tracked articulators By using this infor-
mation the module can immediately calculate
speeds and directions on the y for each hand
The module further employs the method
proposed by the authors in Gonzalez and
Collet 2012 to achieve sub-lexical segmenta-
tion from the previously calculated data Like
them we use the relative velocity between
hands to identify when hands either move at
the same time independently or dont move at
all With these we can produce a set of possi-
ble key postures and transitions that will serve
as input to the modeling module
32 Model Extraction Module
This module calculates a propositional state
for each static posture where atomic PDLSL
Figure 3 shows an example of the process
Here each key posture is codied into propo-
sitions acknowledging the hand positions with
respect to each other R

left hand oats over the torse

TORSE their conguration eg
hand is open with F R
OPENPALMCONFIG and their
movements eg left hand moves to the up-
left direction with cid37L
This module also checks that the generated
graph is correct
it will discard simple track-
ing errors to ensure that the resulting LTS will
remain consistent
33 Verication Module
First of all the verication module has to be
loaded with a database of sign descriptions en-
coded as PDLSL formulas These will charac-
terize the specic sequence of key postures that
morphologically describe a sign For exam-
ple lets take the case for sign route in FSL
shown in gure 4 with the following PDLSL
formulation

with 2D coordinates With these in mind we
tried to design something exible that could
be easily adapted by computer scientists and
linguists alike Our primitive sets were inten-
tionally dened in a very general fashion due
to the same reason all of the perceived di-
rections articulators and places of articulation
can easily change their domains depending on
the SL we are modeling or the technological
constraints we have to deal with Proposi-
tions can also be changed or even induced by
existing written sign representation languages
such as Zebedee Filhol 2008 or HamNoSys
Hanke 2004 mainly for the sake of extend-
ability
From the application side we still need to
create an extensive sign database codied in
PDLSL and try recognition on other corpora
with dierent tracking information For ver-
ication and model extraction further opti-
mizations are expected including the handling
of data inconsistencies and repairing broken
queries when verifying the graph
issues
theoretical
Regarding our
work will be centered in improving our lan-
guage to better comply with SL research This
includes adding new features
like incorpo-
rating probability representation to improve
recognition We also expect to nish the deni-
tion of our formal semantics as well as proving
correction and complexity of our algorithms

It also indicates the posi-
tion of each hand their orientation whether
they touch and their respective congurations
in this example both hold the same CLAMP

The module can then verify whether a sign
formula in the lexical database holds in any
sub-sequence of states of the graph generated
in the previous step Algorithm 1 sums up the

4 Conclusions and Future Work
We have shown how a logical language can
be used to model SL signs for semi-automatic
recognition albeit with some restrictions The
traits we have chosen to represent were im-
posed by the limits of the tracking tools we
had to our disposition most notably working
language translation system with vision-based
features
