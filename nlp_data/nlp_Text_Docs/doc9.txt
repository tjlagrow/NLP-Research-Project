Abstract  In  this  paper  we  define  event  expression  over  sentences  of 
natural  language  and  semantic  relations  between  events  Based  on  this 
definition we formally consider text understanding process having events 
as basic unit

1 Event and Semantic Relation 
We  introduce  semantic  representation  model  of  sentences  for  text 
understanding  which  is  based  on  event  expression  by  considering  a 
sentence  as  a  description  of  event  We  first  give  event  expression 
consisting  of  certain  items  which  is  called  case-relations  where  event 
expression represents the meaning of a sentence 
Formally an event corresponding to a sentence S can be represented as 
follows   
In  some  cases  we  simply  write 
  be  a  tuple 
  and  omit 
  Here 
  Let 
  is  a 
case-relation  shown  in Table  1 and 
which takes a Korean word or a variable We call a case-relation taking a 
variable case-relation with undefined value   
is  a value of  case-relation 
  is  an  event    expression  which  is  the  value  of  case-relation 
This  reflects  the  internal  nesting  of  natural  language  sentences  and 
corresponds  to  subordinate  clause  of  principal  clause  of  a  sentence  We 
introduced  14  case-relations  in  domain  of  our  text  understanding 
systemTable 1 
There  exists  semantic  relation  between  sentences  of  a  text  Naturally 
there  exists  semantic  relation  between  events  corresponding  to  these 
sentences

We  propose  7  semantic  relations  of  language  domain  which  can  be 
managed in our model

  sentences  of  a  text  and 
  events 
that  subsequence  of  events 
  occurs  consequently  and 
In  our  model  understanding  of  text  is  a  process  confirming  the 
semantic  relations  in    This  process  is  performed  by  matching 
events  and  its  relevant  events  to  a  story  schema  which  is  defined  in  our 
model We consider this course as a process for text understanding     
Definition  1  Let 
every  case-relations  and  values  of 
  is event schema and 
  We  call 
  be  two  events  We  say  that 
  matches 
  are  equal  to  ones  of 
  matchable event 
Remark An event can match another event or can be matched by another 
event     
Through the matching the value of case-relation with undefined value 
  We  call  such  a  unifying  process 
confirmation process of case-relation with undefined value   
  is  unified  by  one  in 
Definition  2  We  call  the  following  relational  diagram  memory  schema 
and denote by

this tree is an event schema or an event For two neighboring nodes there 
is  a  edge  with  label

  And  let

3Story and understanding diagram in memory 
Generally story consists of a series of consequent  events and some other 
events relating to it To make system understand such a story we defined

structure  base  on  this  idea  Now  let 
  be  sequence  of 
events and 
be memory schema matching this sequence 
Based  on  the  condition  13  which  is  given  in  the  definition  of 
matching  of  memory  schema  understanding  system  can  deal  with  the 
following cases   
  There exists 
this case 
  There exists 
  which is matched by

  which is matched by 
  is  an  event  schema  with  the  same  variable  and 
confirmed  through  confirmation  process  of  case-relation  with  the  same 
variable  Also  in  this  case 
  is  replaced  with 
is  an  event  schema  not  including  case-relation  with  undefined 
value In this case no one is replaced     
For  all  event  schema  of 
  we  apply  the  procedure 
described above and delete test factor  of edges  in 
We call such a diagram story   
Let  us  assume  that 
and  is  understandable  in  memory  Then  we  can  obtain 
  stories  from 
  memory  schemas  by  applying  consequence  1  of  theorem  1This 
stories  is  called    understanding 
  is  a  sequence  of  events  in  text 
relational  diagram  consisting  of 
diagram in memory of text 
  and is denoted by 
  in our paper   
From  the  above  discussion  we  can  see  that  understanding  process  in 
memory  depends  on  memory  schema  Description  ability  of  memory 
schema  depends  on  the  structure  of  memory  schema  and  semantic 
relations  defined  by  systemNote  that  the  memory  schema  of  this  paper 
assumes consequent occurrence of events 
4 Conclusion 
In  this  paper  we  defined  event  expression  over  sentences  in  natural 
language  and  semantic  relations  between  events  We  also  defined  event 
schema  memory  schema  and  understandable  sequence  of  events  in 
memory  Based  on 
understanding process having understanding diagram in memory   
this  definition  we  formally  considered
