Abstract
Human annotation of natural language facilitates standardized evaluation of natural lan-
guage processing systems and supports automated feature extraction This document consists
of instructions for annotating the temporal information in scheduling dialogs dialogs in which
the participants schedule a meeting with one another Task-oriented dialogs such as these
are would arise in many useful applications for instance automated information providers
and automated phone operators Explicit instructions support good inter-rater reliability and
serve as documentation for the classes being annotated
Introduction
Research systems in computational linguistics are no longer assessed solely by appeals to re-
searcher intuition on selected examples Instead system results usually are compared to inde-
pendent interpretations of naturally occurring text Therefore the main purpose of this temporal
coding task is to provide a benchmark for evaluating the performance of Artwork1 on tracking
the times discussed in scheduling dialogs This includes the inference of missing or underspecied
temporal information To facilitate the evaluation the temporal information is being recorded in
a standardized format
This coding can also serve as a starting point for obtaining a tagged corpus of temporal
expressions in naturally occurring discourse Such a corpus makes it easier to compare the
performance of dierent research systems on the same problem It also permits for statistical
analysis which might be useful for extracting temporal features
Each dialog to be coded concerns two people trying to arrange for a meeting For each
utterance you are to specify the time that is being referred to either explicitly or implicitly This
should only be based on an interpretation of the utterances that have already been encountered
the dialog context That is you should not revise answers in light of subsequent utterances
Furthermore you should interpret the text based on your common-sense intuitions regarding
meetings such as that they usually occur during normal working hours However in order to

1Artwork is being developed at NMSUs Computing Research Laboratory as part of a joint project with CMU
on investigating ways to facilitate machine translation of scheduling dialogs
restrict the wide range of plausible inferences that can be applied you need to limit such inferences
to what can be readily inferred from the dialog This vague notion will be discussed in detail
later For now consider it as covering the obvious inferences Surprisingly these are often the
most dicult to model via a computer
See the guidelines section below for more information about these and other requirements
First an example dialog will be discussed to show what is expected of you Then the coding
representation is explained You need to adhere to this format to ensure that the results are
recorded in a common format After the detailed list of guidelines there is a section with
additional coding advice The appendix gives a complete example of a dialog coded based on
these instructions
2 Background
The following transcript illustrates the type of scheduling dialog you will be tagging It is given
in both the original Spanish and in the English translation You do not need to refer to the
Spanish version to perform this task it is provided as background material for those who can
read Spanish2
S1 Quihubo Primo que paso
1 Whats up Primo whats happening
S2 Nada aqui nada mas como has estado
2 Not much same old thing how you been
S1 Muy bien Oye necesito juntarme contigo Necesitamos este discutir eh uh
algo del proyecto Cuando tienes tiempo
3 Good 4 Listen I need to talk to you 5 We need to ahh talk about
ahh uh something about the project 6 When do you have time
S2 Hijola pos que dia estas pensando en
7 Jeez well what day were you thinking about
S1 Pos si se puede manana Si se puede manana Tienes chance manana
8 Well tomorrow if you can 9 Tomorrow if you can 10 Do you have
a chance tomorrow
S2 Pos depende en que hora porque mira para empezar como horita de las ocho a
las diez tengo una cita con el doctor y ya sabes como le entretiene a uno
11 Well it depends on what time because look to begin with I have a
doctors appointment between eight and ten and you know the runaround
they give you
S1 Si
12 Yeah
2Subtle distinctions are occasionally lost in the translation but this usually doesnt aect the temporal
information
The dialogs are divided into groups of consecutive utterances by the same speaker which are
called turns Most of the turns have just one or two utterances but a few have several especially
if the speaker makes a correction
In this dialog the rst two turns are typical greetings that the speakers exchange No temporal
information has been conveyed Next speaker 1 introduces the need to have a meeting and
then asks the other person to indicate availability
In reply speaker 2 asks for a clarication
Although there is mention of when and what day these are not specic times so they are
not represented Therefore the entries for the rst seven utterances would indicate no temporal
information
 Start WeekDay Month Date Hour Time of Day
End WeekDay Month Date Hour Time of Day
This shows that time is being represented by intervals rather than by points as there are
starting and ending entries for all elds3 The interval-based approach is commonly used in
natural language processing since it is closer to the way people usually express time periods
The example also shows that all the elds are explicitly lled in in cases where no information
is known the special entry null is used This is designed to eliminate errors due to coder
omissions
Starting with utterance 8 specic times are being discussed Speaker 1 suggests tomorrow
for a potential meeting Since the dialog date is Tuesday May 11th 1993 we know that the time
in question is Wednesday May 12th The next two utterances reiterate this request so the times
will be the same
3An alternative representation would be to encode the start and end points separately along with the relation
between the points For instance the entry for 8 would be split into two entries with a precedes relation between
the two
 Start WeekDay Month Date Hour Time of Day
End WeekDay Month Date Hour Time of Day
Wednesday May
Wednesday May
Wednesday May
Wednesday May
Wednesday May
Wednesday May
It might seem odd that both the starting and ending times are the same Doesnt this mean
the interval has no length No since the hour and time of day elds are left unspecied The
representation indicates that the period in question starts some time on May 12th and ends
some time on the same day However there are cases when the interval length will be zero For
instance 10 But remember the oce closes tomorrow at 3pm would be represented as
Wednesday May
Wednesday May
afternoon
afternoon
In response to the suggested date of Wednesday May 12th the other person gives a constraint
that the meeting cant occur between eight and ten due to a doctors appointment Note that
there is no mention of the meeting date but this is readily inferred from the dialog context
Finally the last utterance conveys no temporal information
Wednesday May
Wednesday May
800 morning
1000 morning
As indicated in the table we also inferred that the time for 11 is in the morning Although
it might seem obvious that it must be in the morning you have to be careful when you make
this type of judgement In this case youd be surprised if the appointment were in the evening
especially since its a doctors appointment Thus when in doubt about a time determine
whether it would surprise you if it werent the case Just leave the eld as null otherwise
3 Code Format
For each distinct time mentioned in the dialog please ll out the following information using
null to indicate information that cannot be inferred and commas to separate elds A template
will be provided to help ensure that the correct format is applied
Label SWeekDay
STimeOfDay
EWeekDay EMonth EDate EHourSpec ETimeOfDay
SHourSpec
SMonth
The S prexes elds for the starting time and the E prexes those for the ending time Each of
the components in this structure is given in the following format where the qualiers are optional
WeekDay
HourSpec
Description
Numeric label of the utterance eg 1 19a
Use 1 alt1 etc for alternatives see below
sunday monday  saturday
january february  december
1 2 3  31
10 1215
Omit the AM or PM indicator
since that is covered by the Time of Day eld
TimeOfDay morning afternoon evening
breakfast lunch dinner
all-day
Since meetings could last an entire day be careful not
to assume it will just be in the morning or afternoon
Qualiers
before after during Mainly for use with TimeOfDay before lunch
early mid late
but could also be used with other elds after the fth
Description
Figure 1 Possible Values for the Components of the Temporal Representation
Qualiers TimeComponent
Example 1 shows the exact format that is required Possible values for the components elds
are listed in gure 1
Im free late in the afternoon on Monday the 19th until Wednesday
monday august 19 null late afternoon
wednesday august 21 null null
A few examples will be given just to illustrate the desired format The rationale for the
content of the representation is covered in the next section First of all since qualiers can apply
to any eld the value for each component is actually a list of items These lists are enclosed in
parentheses to eliminate confusion The whole structure is then enclosed in square brackets
Are you free Wednesday September 4th
wednesday september 4 null null
wednesday september 4 null null
Yes but only early in the morning
wednesday september 4 null early morning
wednesday september 4 null early morning
Oh then how about after the fth
null september after 5 null null
null null null null null
4 Coding Guidelines
Please keep in mind the following guidelines for specifying the times The examples given assume
the dialog date is Monday 19 August 1996 The calendar for this period follows
Tues Wed
August 1996
In what follows the labeling convention for these examples uses a number followed by an
optional letter sux eg 1a The number is based on the example number rather than the
utterance number The letter is used when there is more than one utterance for the same example
Since there might be several examples together this might be a little confusing However two
utterances will be related only if the labels use the same example number as a prex For instance
in the following utterances 5b and 6a would be unrelated
Good morning Peter
Good morning and how are you Mary
What day is best for you
None really since my schedules quite full
The guidelines follow
1 Fill in missing temporal information based on what can be readily inferred from the context
of the dialog Avoid relying too much on common-sense assumptions such as about the
most likely times for meetings Unfortunately there are no clear boundaries Instead you
must use your intuition about what seem to be reasonable assumptions
Lets meet tomorrow morning
OK how about 8 oclock
tuesday august 20 null morning
tuesday august 20 null null
tuesday august 20 8 morning
tuesday august 20 null null
We need to discuss the project soon
Well lets meet Thursday after lunch
null null null null null
null null null null null
thursday august 22 null after lunch
thursday august 22 null null
Lets meet Friday afternoon
OK how about 3pm
friday august 23 null afternoon
friday august 23 null null
friday august 23 3 afternoon
friday august 23 null afternoon
The representation for 9b suggests the meeting ends in the afternoon presumably since
people usually dont stay late on Fridays Thus it is a case of extrapolating too much from
the dialog Note that evening would also be inappropriate since the meeting might very
well be short Therefore its better to be noncommittal and use null
2 Only consider the previous utterances when interpreting the time of an utterance So dont
read ahead if you are unsure of the time Likewise dont revise previous answers There
might be transcription errors in the dialogs which were recorded from actual conversations
Even if a later utterance reveals an error in an earlier one do not go back and revise it
Note that you may not be able to determine what all of the times aresometimes speakers
are too vague for a denitive time to be determined Fill in a time when you are reasonably
certain what the speakers mean
3 Consider weeks as just workweeks Therefore omit weekends unless the dialog suggests
otherwise
I am free all this week
monday august 19 null null
friday august 23 null null
When speciers such as rst or last apply to partial workweeks the interpretation can be
quite subjective A rule of thumb is to consider only those with more than two working
I was in Portland the rst week of August
monday august 5 null null
friday august 9 null null
This shows that the period discussed is the interval from Monday the fth to Friday the
ninth treated as a single unit The partial workweek Aug 1-2 is skipped
4 Be as specic as possible about the time for a meeting or for the speakers availability For
instance if a day of the week is specied relative to some week just code the time for the
day not the entire week as illustrated in 12a
Lets meet Friday next week
I can only meet next month
OK then how about the rst week
friday august 30 null null
friday august 30 null null
sunday september 1 null null
monday september 30 null null
monday september 2 null null
friday september 6 null null
12b shows that months should be interpreted as ranges from the rst of the month to the
last Weeks are handled similarly except that weekends are not included
5 If no end time is mentioned then code the end time using as much of the start time as
possible For instance if the start time mentions the day and the exact starting time in
hours and minutes use the day in the end time as well but omit the HourSpec
Lets meet Thursday at 9am
thursday august 22 9 morning
thursday august 22 null null
6 Dont just encode the time as literally given Instead encode it based on an interpretation
giving the most information regarding the meeting or other scheduling event For example
information on an entire meeting is more informative than just information on its start or
The meeting has to be Friday at 8am
OK just so it ends at 10am
friday august 23 8 morning
friday august 23 null null
friday august 23 8 morning
friday august 23 10 morning
Taken literally 14a would be represented as a point But since meetings take time the
ending hour is left unspecied Similarly the encoding for 14b provides more information
about the meeting than what a literal interpretation of at 10am would provide
7 Interpret simple events as instantaneous unless such events are usually considered as part
of an extended event As above the encoding should indicate the time most relevant for
the scheduling domain
Lets meet tomorrow afternoon at 3pm
Would we then adjourn at 5pm
Yes Ill remind you at 1pm
tuesday august 20 3 afternoon
tuesday august 20 null null
tuesday august 20 3 afternoon
tuesday august 20 5 afternoon
tuesday august 20 1 afternoon
tuesday august 20 1 afternoon
It is natural to consider 15a as referring to a point in time since you might interpret
meet as encounter an instantaneous occurrence or simple event But since were con-
cerned primarily with the scheduling domain you should generally interpret meet as
hold meeting a prolonged occurrence or complex event Similarly 15b might be taken
to refer to an instantaneous occurrence just considering the adjournment itself But it also
should be represented as an interval because the simple adjournment event is part of the
complex meeting event the focus of the domain However 15c is represented by a point
since reminders are generally independent simple events
Note that the distinction between instantaneous and prolonged occurrences or simple versus
complex event is easier to see in other domains
John walked the dog at 6pm
Spot bit John at 615
null null null 6 evening
null null null null evening
null null null 615 evening
null null null 615 evening
16a is represented as an interval since walking a dog is a complex event 16b in contrast
is represented by a point since a dog-bite event usually is relatively instantaneous
8 Consider the big picture when deciding on event interpretations This guideline is implicit
in the previous two but it is important enough to emphasize separately Since the same
event can be looked at from dierent viewpoints the event aspect there might be confusion
on what to encode In 17 below the entire event is being referred to whereas in 17
just the start Again you should consider the temporal references at the level of the entire
meeting event instead of at the level of the viewpoint Thus 17 and 17 are represented
in the same way
17
17
Lets meet in the afternoon
null null null null afternoon
null null null null null
Lets start the meeting in the afternoon
null null null null afternoon
null null null null null
Some people may read sentences such as 17 as meaning that the entire meeting must
be held in the afternoon For consistency of tagging however please encode these and
similar examples as specied in this document
9 Treat discrete times individually Please label each alternative in the disjunction with
the sux  alt1  alt2 etc as illustrated Similarly label each required time in a
conjunction with  and1  and2 etc
18 alt1
18 alt2
I can meet Wednesday or Friday
wednesday august 21 null null
wednesday august 21 null null
friday august 23 null null
friday august 23 null null
19 and1
19 and2
I can meet Tuesday and Thursday
tuesday august 21 null null
tuesday august 21 null null
thursday august 22 null null
thursday august 22 null null
10 Treat time ranges as a unit represented by one interval That is use a single descriptor
instead of a series of alternatives
I will be away the 22nd through the 26th
thursday august 22 null null
monday august 26 null null
11 When in doubt about an assumption you are making ask yourself whether you would be
surprised it if werent the case
Lets meet at two
null null null 2 afternoon
null null null null null
The meeting of 21 is assumed to be in the afternoon since you would probably be surprised
if the meeting were instead at 2am You might object that you wouldnt be surprised at a
2am clandestine meeting but remember to assume normal working hours and activities
Lets meet at eight
null null null 8 null
null null null null null
Here you probably wouldnt be surprised if the meeting was at 8pm so coding the meeting
as in the morning might be assuming too much unless of course something in the prior
context suggests that the morning is intended
12 Fill in elds that can be determined from other elds or from the dialog date For instance
resolve dates to days of the week and use the current month when no other month could
reasonably apply Likewise resolve temporal adverbs and phrases eg tomorrow in
two days to absolute dates based on the dialog date
Today is the nineteenth right
monday august 19 null null
monday august 19 null null
Are you free tomorrow morning
tuesday august 20 null morning
tuesday august 20 null null
13 When trying to decide how much common-sense reasoning you can apply to the interpreta-
tion consider how specic the times are that have been mentioned In regards to time it
is generally safer to make assumptions going from the specic to the general So it is safe
to assume a meeting that starts at 1pm ends on the same day But it is risky to assume
that a meeting on a Monday wont start before 9am
Similarly consider the range of possibilities and the likelihood of the alternatives If someone
says at 3 oclock the choices are 3am and 3pm with the former being unlikely However
if someone says after 3pm there are many choices eg 301pm 302pm  1159pm
with those starting at multiples of 30 minutes being more likely eg 330pm 4pm 
7pm Thus it would be safer to leave the corresponding entry null This is how example
25 is handled
After the twenty fth
null august after 25 null null
null null null null null
Although the 31st might be considered a good ending time there are other good possibilities
eg Thursday 8 September which is two weeks afterwards Note the special handling of
after in which the day of the week is not resolved and where the qualier goes with the
14 Since there is not a separate eld for coding duration omit the information when it cannot
be coded using a pair of startingending elds
26
26
I can meet Thursday for three hours
thursday august 22 null null
thursday august 22 null null
I can meet Thursday at 1pm for three hours
thursday august 22 1 afternoon
thursday august 22 4 afternoon
15 Be careful in coding the entries Please double-check your answers When lling out the
form you might have accidentally copied over a value from a previous entry
