Abstract Controlled languages for industrial application are often re-
garded as a response to the challenges of translation and multilingual
communication 3 pp 5253 5 p 212 2 pp iiii This paper presents
a quite dierent approach taken by Koenig  Bauer AG where the main
goal was the improvement of the authoring process for technical docu-
mentation Most importantly this paper explores the notion of a con-
trolled language and demonstrates how style guides can emerge from non-
linguistic considerations Moreover it shows the transition from loose
language recommendations into precise and prescriptive rules and inves-
tigates whether such rules can be regarded as a full-edged controlled
language
Introduction
A considerable amount of research on controlled languages deals with English In
this paper I examine an approach for an industrial application of a controlled
language in German at the printing press manufacturer Koenig  Bauer AG
KBA1 In comparison to well-known industrial examples such as CFECTE
or ASD-STE100 2 13 cf 3 KBA did not create an independent project
on a controlled language Instead the companys main goal was to redene the
authoring process for technical documentation Language standardization was
needed to support this goal I will explain this background in the rst section
The following section will give a closer look at the results of dierent projects that
originated dierent language rules These rules and style guides will illustrate
how KBA unintentionally laid the foundations for a de facto controlled language
After showing some future directions for the project I will discuss its results
within the current theoretical frameworks
Although this paper derives from a case study its main goal is to explore
the notion of a controlled language and to demonstrate how style guides can

sition from loose language recommendations to precise and prescriptive rules It

language
2 Background
Koenig  Bauer AG is one of the leading printing press manufacturers operat-
ing from Wrzburg Germany employing around 6200 2012 people worldwide
The variety of products covers a o web oset sheetfed oset and security print-
ing The annual reports2 indicate that over 80  of the products are exported
which makes translation of documentation and localization of the press soft-
ware an important step in the production process Further the web printing
presses are unique custom-made production plants rather than standard mod-
els In consequence every operating manual is a unique document describing
specic features and the conguration of the press for a given customer Such
a document can be up to 800 pages long It is translated into one language
national or regional language of the customer and some customers require an
additional English translation In short it means one press  one manual in
the source language German  one manual in the target language There are
certainly some core parts of the press and some partial congurations recur-
ring for many customers In order to make the authoring process for technical
documentation more ecient it was therefore important to facilitate identify-
ing indexing storing retrieving and combining the recurring information units
This task had to be accomplished before addressing any issues of translation In
other words the company was mainly interested in increasing the reuse of the
content
In order to redene standard procedures for technical documentation the
company launched six projects in 2007 These projects contribute to the overar-
ching goal of improving the reuse as follows 14 21
1 CMS Project aiming at the implementation of a content management system
for editing storing retrieving and managing modularized content
TIM-RS Rcid13 by Fischer Computertechnik3 was chosen as the CMS with the
PI-Mod4 as a data model for authoring PI-Mod allows semantic as well as
topic-based XML markup for text chunks and modular reusable information
This project provides the technology foundation for the reuse
2 Writers manual In this project meta documentation of the CMS project
was developed The manual describes allowed XML elements their content
dependencies and where necessary their linguistic form Moreover it pro-
vides general recommendations on orthography and style for the technical
documentation

3 Terminology management A project on standardization of the specialized
vocabulary The goals were here to dene standard procedures for the termi-
nology management to model the terminology database in SDL MultiTerm5
and to develop linguistic rules for evaluation and selection of preferred terms
4 Translation Most documents at KBA are written in German and the com-
pany does not have in-house translators therefore the project denes general
conditions for the translation services In the context of this paper the most
important decisions are the prescribed use of Translation Memories develop-
ment of and adherence to the foreign-language equivalents to the provided
German terminology as well as development of and adherence to general
style guides for each foreign language as needed
5 Graphics Due to the variability of the products a full reuse of graphics
in operating manuals is impossible This project should nonetheless dene
common standards regarding the exporting of graphics from CAD systems
further processing and managing in the CMS environment
6 Parts catalog In contrast to the above this project focuses not on reuse
but on making the editing and publishing of the parts catalog more simple
and transparent
As we see there was no particular project for developing a controlled language as
such Yet relevant issues and requirements concerning language use are scattered
across all projects
3 Language Constraints at KBA
KBA chose a modular approach towards development of technical documenta-
tion which means that the documents are built up by combining dierent text
modules and chunks These chunks can already be stored in a database however
they could be written by dierent writers at a dierent time and for dierent
products The reuse principle requires not only homogeneous layout and typog-
raphy but also explicit linguistic rules for all writers involved in order to keep or
achieve consistent language Not only does consistent language make the manu-
als more readable for the target human audience but at the same time it also
supports the implementation of the reuse technology for instance the vocab-
ulary is used to index modules and chunks Therefore consistent terminology
improves the machine-aided retrieval
In conclusion it was the variability of the products as well as the desire to
make the process of the technical writing more ecient that led to the develop-
ment of the stylesyntax and lexical rules In addition improving the readability
and translatability was an important aspect of standardizing the vocabulary
In the following section I will elaborate on the linguistic results of the
projects 14 described above dividing them into issues concerning lexicon and
syntaxstyle By giving some examples of the rules and by describing the rule-
formation process I would like to draw attention to some aspects that will be
5 httpwwwsdlcomproductssdl-multitermdesktophtml
subsequently crucial to the understanding of a controlled language First KBA
went beyond the regular terminology management by developing a rule-based
selection of preferred terms Second some imprecise style guides emerged from
non-linguistic considerations Thanks to human and later machine-aided editing
the rules have become more explicit and prescriptive The following sections will
illustrate this transition
31 Lexical Level
KBA imposed two constraints to the standardization of the specialized vocab-
ulary6 The rst constraint limited the in-house standardization to the German
terms only The second one restricted the scope of standardization to the specic
printing vocabulary leaving out the more general technical terms or terms used
in other domains such as economics Importantly KBA required the selection
of preferred terms to be reproducible and transparent to the writers Therefore
linguistic criteria were developed for evaluating existing terms which can be
applied for coining new terms as well Using a corpus of companys vocabulary
semantic and morphological aspects of the word formation patterns were iden-
tied and evaluated An essential part was to identify the patterns leading to
ambiguity and synonymy for instance
 Ambiguity Nominalization using the sux -ung can both indicate a process
or a device performing the process wenden to turn a sheet for perfecting
 Wendung the process of perfecting or a perfecting unit
 A process can be expressed through nominalization with sux -ung see
above or conversion of the innite verb form wenden  Wendung vs
Wenden
 Dierent features of a concept can be stressed in synonymous terms
Chromwalze chrome roller focus on material vs Feuchtreibwalze
dampener distributor roller focus on function
 The hypernymy can be explicitly stated using the hypernym in com-
pound nouns or this relation can be stated implicitly Farbreibwalze
oscillating ink roller vs Farbreiber ink oscillator
 Synonymy
One of the goals in developing the linguistic criteriarules was to achieve a
one-to-one relation between the word formation pattern and the semantic class
of the objects In other words the signiant should indicate the class of the
signi as illustrated by the following rules
 Use conversion to indicate the process Wenden
 Use the nominalization with -ung or -or-er to indicate a complex device
Wendung Lngsschneider slitter7
6 This section is based on 21
7 The corpus indicates a complementary distribution of both patterns with only few
exceptions
 Use hypernym for composition of less complex parts Farbreibwalze Schneid-
messer cutting knife
 Use the following ranking of features to be included in the term 1 function
2 object 3 working principle 4 shape 5 material 6 temporal graduate
internal features cf 18 p 14
 Do not use more than 4 lexical morphemes in a compound noun 3 mor-
phemes are preferred
These criteria are intended to be an assistance rather than absolute rules
for selecting the preferred terms In case they lead to the selection of extremely
unusual forms established terms are preferred
These rules steps and roles in the terminology management process as well
as the denition of the data structure for the terminology database were xed in
a terminology manual Only after this denition task was completed the actual
standardization of the lexicon began Contrary to the manual which recom-
mended management similar to model B of ISO 15188 10 the initial standard-
ization followed rather model D The rst terminology draft was proposed by
the terminologist and consulted with the technical writers The nal form was
released only after consulting with the constructing engineers who gave their
feedback on every term in the draft
Applying the theoretical principles of terminology management by Wster
22 cf 1 the standardization process was concept-driven Manually extracted
terms were rst arranged into concept systems multiple arrangement of one term
was allowed and then given a denition Only after both the concept systems
and the denition were specied the preferred term was chosen according to the
rules described above
SDL MultiTerm was used from the very beginning In addition the initial
management employed MS PowerPoint concept systems and MS Excel def-
initions and synonyms in order to facilitate the feedback by the engineers
Moreover the workow software quickTerm by Kaleidoscope8 is now being im-
plemented which will help to shift back to the originally intended management
as in the model B
Currently the database contains 614 concepts 1689 terms covering almost
entirely the printing specic vocabulary for the operating manuals Roughly
30  of the German terms have an approved foreign-language equivalent in one
or more of the following languages English French Dutch Russian Swedish
and Spanish The equivalents are provided by the translation services based on
the given German terminology and are not double-checked by KBA before nal
release However quickTerm allows users to send their feedback on all languages
32 Syntactic and Stylistic Level
Unlike the lexical level where an eort was put in the linguistic evaluation
of the corpus data and development of systematic rules for word formation
8 httpwwwkaleidoscopeatDeutschSoftwareQuickTermquicktermphp
the development of the stylistic and syntactic rules was a byproduct of the
implementation of PI-Mod
PI-Mod uses XML elements to mark up information in a text according to its
semantics for instance as step descriptive precondition cause or
solution After agreeing on the elements needed for operating manuals the
standardization of syntax and style for some elements began This standardiza-
tion was necessary for a similar reason as the lexical one competing syntactic
patterns were in use for instance imperative verb form vs innite verb form
used as imperative in step in action full sentence vs ellipsis in cause
There is no record of the decision-making process for these rules as the fo-
cus of the CMS project was on the technical rather than linguistic specication
14 However the original writers manual and personal communication indicate
that the prescribed style patterns were a combination of so-called good practice
for technical documentation implicit or explicit but merely oral arrangements
among the writers and the standard examples used in the general PI-Mod spec-
ication
The rules can be divided into general and element specic rules Here are some
examples of the original recommendations developed during the CMS project
 Avoid Passive Voice
 Structure information logically for instance if  then or condition  step
 Element step as child element of action
Use the formal imperative verb form Sie
 Element symptom
Write from users perspective do not use questions
Example Mastarm fhrt nicht richtig hoch sentence with a nite verb9
 Element cause as child element of safetyadvice
Name the cause of the hazard with one word or in a short and expressive
sentence Use an exclamation point
Example 1 Verbrhungsgefahr durch herausspritzendes l ellipsis no nite
Example 2 ldruck in Arbeitshydraulik kann Manometer zerstren sen-
tence with a nite verb
 Element cause as child element of errordescription
Describe the cause of an error in one word or in a short and expressive
sentence
Example 1 Kein Kraftsto im Tank ellipsis no nite verb
Example 2 Pumpe hat zu wenig Leistung sentence with a nite verb
Initially the syntactic and stylistic rules were enforced by human editing
within the department Already at that point it became clear that some rules
remained ambiguous As demonstrated in the examples above some rules were
linguistically imprecise some lacked an explicit form some depended on some-
times contradicting examples and did not indicate whether they were recom-
mendations or prescriptions The room for interpretation lowered the consistency
9 Information in brackets was not indicated in the manual
of the texts and in consequence  the reuse Therefore the rules and examples
in the writers manual have been gradually replaced by more precise ones for
instance
 Element cause as child element of safetyadvice
Use ellipsis construction with no nite verb Do not use full sentences with
verbs Name the cause of the hazard with one word Verbrhrungsgefahr
Verbrennungsgefahr Use an exclamation point
Positive example Maschinenschaden durch liegengebliebenes Werkzeug
Negative example Liegengebliebenes Werkzeug fhrt zu Maschinenschaden
 Element cause as child element of errordescription
Use a full sentence with a verb Do not use ellipsis Use a period at the end
of the sentence
Positive example Kein Kraftsto ist im Tank
Negative example Kein Kraftsto im Tank
Further specication of the rules has been reinforced by the implementation
of a controlled language checker CLC Acrolinx10 since the rules had to be
easily transformed into a machine-readable form Hence the syntacticstylistic
level is being further consolidated
Although not used from the beginning a CLC was considered a medium-
term goal At this time the system is being implemented to t into the already
existing linguistic environment With respect to style and syntax KBA rules
are being mapped to the standard Acrolinx set of rules and the system is being
checked in a test environment Practical application is expected not earlier than
in the summer 2014 Despite oering solutions for terminology management
Acrolinx will solely be used for proofreading SDL MultiTerm will remain the
primary source for the lexical level of the language
4 Prospects
The four crucial projects resulting in the linguistic rules  CMS terminology
writers manual and translation  are completed Yet the maintenance and fur-
ther development of the rules is an on-going process Other tasks like the pro-
ductive use of a CLC are still to be accomplished More importantly described
development is normative only to the department of technical documentation
however other departments can obviously benet from the use of language re-
strictions as well Some applications might regard CAD models ERM mainly
terminology and press software both terminology and syntaxstyle Although
some ways of implementing a controlled language to these applications have al-
ready been explored they still remain a challenge for the future
Overall the main goal of modular approach and reuse still has to be evaluated
KBA is going to track the reuse applying the REx method 16 Resulting data
could then be used for further interpretation of the linguistic contribution to the
improved reuse11

5 Discussion
Before any specic issues concerning language at KBA can be discussed it needs
to be determined whether the rules and developments described above constitute
a controlled language
The term controlled language is not used in any internal documents to de-
scribe the lexical or syntactic rules for technical documentation Rather there
is an issue of terminology and writing rules Schreibregeln  both being treated
separately The constraints on the language are put into an overarching context
of standardization just like XML markup modular editing or data indexing in
the CMS This might be the result of the distribution of the linguistic decisions
over the four projects In consequence an explicit notion of a controlled language
has not yet emerged
From the theoretical point of view however the linguistic constraints at
KBA satisfy all of the criteria by Kuhn 12 p 123 They are based on just one
language and restrict its system on the orthographic morphological lexical syn-
tactic and textual level combining both prescriptive and proscriptive rules 5 p
228 Although no empirical studies are available we can assume that the output
is easily recognizable as German to an expert familiar with the sublanguage of
printing And nally although the already established forms that had developed
in an unsystematic way were preferred the codication of the forms in manuals
was a deliberate and to a certain extent systematic process Therefore we can
regard these linguistic constraints as a controlled language
Having claried the status of the linguistic constraints at KBA as controlled
language we can try to determine its type
We can apply to it the categories human-oriented and machine-oriented as
proposed by Huijsen 9 The development of the controlled language at KBA
indicates an expansion of originally predominant human-oriented language to a
language that comprises both human- and machine-relevant features but a clear
determination is dicult Both categories seem to be tendencies rather than a
dichotomy which supports the main view in the literature 9 p 2 cf 12 p
Moreover we can examine further motives for this controlled language There
are three main groups of motives discussed in the literature 1 to improve the
communication among humans 2 to improve the translation and 3 to represent
formal notations 12 p 125 cf 9 p 1 cf 19 p 225 cf 20 p 134 leading
Kuhn to postulate three main types of controlled languages 12 p 125 As
demonstrated above these motives were not of primary concern for the style
rules at KBA where the increase of reuse was the main goal The reuse issue of
a controlled language is not a new topic in the literature It has been discussed
in several case studies CTE 6 p 422 13 p 194 It is also mentioned in
some general overviews on controlled languages but it rarely seems to be the
major aspect discussed in detail 5 pp 206207 briey 8 p 11 15 p 248
17 p 62 left out 2 pp iiii 3 Clearly the reuse motive is missing in
the classication by Kuhn This might suggest the fourth type of a controlled
language  to improve the eciency of the authoring process for technical
documentation  an issue which seems to be underrepresented in the literature
Certainly a legitimate question may arise whether a controlled language for
the content reuse serves solely the purpose of ensuring the readability of the text
for the target audience As such it could be subsumed under the rst type of
controlled languages As we saw controlled language at KBA in particular the
vocabulary ensures not only the consistency of a text but also the retrieval of
modules and hence contributes to the reuse in various ways It is not to say that
KBA was unaware that the improved clarity and precision of a controlled lan-
guage have impact on the readability for the target audience as well as improve
human and machine-aided translatability and help control companys liability
in case of damage to persons or facilities 14 21 cf 11 p 443 cf 19 pp
225230 These secondary motives were certainly important for the support of
the projects at dierent management levels in the company cf 4 Modul 1 Yet
these general considerations only became tangible once the modular editing for
improving the reuse started to be implemented since in an obvious way the
modular approach jeopardizes the consistency with all the consequences
What is more the aspect of human understanding can also be found in
controlled languages for translation  a controlled language ensures a o a cor-
rect and readable output of human machine-aided or machine translation
Nonetheless controlled languages for translation constitute their own type Alto-
gether taken the classication by Kuhn as a starting point it seems by analogy
to the controlled languages for translation reasonable to add the fourth type of
controlled languages mentioned above to the classication
Another matter to discuss is the use of CLC and a general acceptance of a
controlled language Based on observation the need for the application of lan-
guage rules is generally understood and accepted by the technical writers First
tests of CLC seem to conform this However ambiguous terms lower the precision
of the CLC which is consistent with the diculties mentioned in the literature
9 p 8 15 p 252 Splitting the vocabulary into domains as suggested by the
software provider and by some authors 15 p 276 seems to lack of a good split-
ting criterion that would not cause too much term overlap between the domains
requiring some essential changes in the database denition and a reconsideration
of the concept-driven terminology management Currently dierent models for
software feedback and score in case of ambiguity are being tested Overall the
problem remains unsolved The main question concerning this type of feedback
is whether it will have an impact on the eectiveness and on general acceptance
of a CLC by the writers
Looking from a broader perspective the case of KBA sheds some light on
the more general issue of the acceptance of a controlled language by the writers
Godden reports on the diculties with the editor-centered model for CASL
at General Motors where the writers not previously trained in the rules were
reluctant to accepting the changes proposed by the editor Some better results
were achieved by a hybrid model requiring prior training of the writers 7 cf
5 pp 215216 cf 8 pp 107112 We do not have similar data concerning
machine editing at KBA yet but the experience with the human editing shows
a promising degree of acceptance of the language rules and proposed changes
in case of a clear violation of the rules I presume that there is a link between
cooperative approach to the denition of the rules resulting on the one hand
in a sense of community and on the other in a better comprehension of the
rules leading altogether to an increase of acceptance There has already been
an awareness of this phenomenon particularly in the literature on terminology
management 5 p 166 cf 17 p 63 but empirical studies are still needed
6 Concluding Remarks
The case of KBA shows that the notion of a controlled language needs to be
reexamined It can emerge as a result of deliberate decisions that are not neces-
sarily labeled and conceived as a design of a controlled language The distinction
between controlled languages and style guides is indeed vague 12 p 124 and
needs to be examined on a case by case basis and perhaps only at a given
point in time This also suggests that there might be more companies having
language regulations that do not see themselves as being concerned by the dis-
course of controlled languages Furthermore a new type of a controlled language
 to improve the authoring process for technical documentation  needs to be
considered
From the practical point of view the case of KBA shows that the develop-
ment in technology has made a controlled language more attainable There is
no longer a need for custom-built software solutions to implement the specica-
tions of a controlled language There is an array of standard software that can
be customized to t specic needs which makes a controlled language easier
and more aordable to develop and implement opening the eld to medium-size
companies

2 Background
Koenig  Bauer AG is one of the leading printing press manufacturers operat-
ing from Wrzburg Germany employing around 6200 2012 people worldwide
The variety of products covers a o web oset sheetfed oset and security print-
ing The annual reports2 indicate that over 80  of the products are exported
which makes translation of documentation and localization of the press soft-
ware an important step in the production process Further the web printing
presses are unique custom-made production plants rather than standard mod-
els In consequence every operating manual is a unique document describing
specic features and the conguration of the press for a given customer Such
a document can be up to 800 pages long It is translated into one language
national or regional language of the customer and some customers require an
additional English translation In short it means one press  one manual in
the source language German  one manual in the target language There are
certainly some core parts of the press and some partial congurations recur-
ring for many customers In order to make the authoring process for technical
documentation more ecient it was therefore important to facilitate identify-
ing indexing storing retrieving and combining the recurring information units
This task had to be accomplished before addressing any issues of translation In
other words the company was mainly interested in increasing the reuse of the
content
In order to redene standard procedures for technical documentation the
company launched six projects in 2007 These projects contribute to the overar-
ching goal of improving the reuse as follows 14 21
1 CMS Project aiming at the implementation of a content management system
for editing storing retrieving and managing modularized content
TIM-RS Rcid13 by Fischer Computertechnik3 was chosen as the CMS with the
PI-Mod4 as a data model for authoring PI-Mod allows semantic as well as
topic-based XML markup for text chunks and modular reusable information
This project provides the technology foundation for the reuse
2 Writers manual In this project meta documentation of the CMS project
was developed The manual describes allowed XML elements their content
dependencies and where necessary their linguistic form Moreover it pro-
vides general recommendations on orthography and style for the technical
documentation

3 Terminology management A project on standardization of the specialized
vocabulary The goals were here to dene standard procedures for the termi-
nology management to model the terminology database in SDL MultiTerm5
and to develop linguistic rules for evaluation and selection of preferred terms
4 Translation Most documents at KBA are written in German and the com-
pany does not have in-house translators therefore the project denes general
conditions for the translation services In the context of this paper the most
important decisions are the prescribed use of Translation Memories develop-
ment of and adherence to the foreign-language equivalents to the provided
German terminology as well as development of and adherence to general
style guides for each foreign language as needed
5 Graphics Due to the variability of the products a full reuse of graphics
in operating manuals is impossible This project should nonetheless dene
common standards regarding the exporting of graphics from CAD systems
further processing and managing in the CMS environment
6 Parts catalog In contrast to the above this project focuses not on reuse
but on making the editing and publishing of the parts catalog more simple
and transparent
As we see there was no particular project for developing a controlled language as
such Yet relevant issues and requirements concerning language use are scattered
across all projects
3 Language Constraints at KBA
KBA chose a modular approach towards development of technical documenta-
tion which means that the documents are built up by combining dierent text
modules and chunks These chunks can already be stored in a database however
they could be written by dierent writers at a dierent time and for dierent
products The reuse principle requires not only homogeneous layout and typog-
raphy but also explicit linguistic rules for all writers involved in order to keep or
achieve consistent language Not only does consistent language make the manu-
als more readable for the target human audience but at the same time it also
supports the implementation of the reuse technology for instance the vocab-
ulary is used to index modules and chunks Therefore consistent terminology
improves the machine-aided retrieval
In conclusion it was the variability of the products as well as the desire to
make the process of the technical writing more ecient that led to the develop-
ment of the stylesyntax and lexical rules In addition improving the readability
and translatability was an important aspect of standardizing the vocabulary
In the following section I will elaborate on the linguistic results of the
projects 14 described above dividing them into issues concerning lexicon and
syntaxstyle By giving some examples of the rules and by describing the rule-
formation process I would like to draw attention to some aspects that will be
5 httpwwwsdlcomproductssdl-multitermdesktophtml
subsequently crucial to the understanding of a controlled language First KBA
went beyond the regular terminology management by developing a rule-based
selection of preferred terms Second some imprecise style guides emerged from
non-linguistic considerations Thanks to human and later machine-aided editing
the rules have become more explicit and prescriptive The following sections will
illustrate this transition
31 Lexical Level
KBA imposed two constraints to the standardization of the specialized vocab-
ulary6 The rst constraint limited the in-house standardization to the German
terms only The second one restricted the scope of standardization to the specic
printing vocabulary leaving out the more general technical terms or terms used
in other domains such as economics Importantly KBA required the selection
of preferred terms to be reproducible and transparent to the writers Therefore
linguistic criteria were developed for evaluating existing terms which can be
applied for coining new terms as well Using a corpus of companys vocabulary
semantic and morphological aspects of the word formation patterns were iden-
tied and evaluated An essential part was to identify the patterns leading to
ambiguity and synonymy for instance
 Ambiguity Nominalization using the sux -ung can both indicate a process
or a device performing the process wenden to turn a sheet for perfecting
 Wendung the process of perfecting or a perfecting unit
 A process can be expressed through nominalization with sux -ung see
above or conversion of the innite verb form wenden  Wendung vs
Wenden
 Dierent features of a concept can be stressed in synonymous terms
Chromwalze chrome roller focus on material vs Feuchtreibwalze
dampener distributor roller focus on function
 The hypernymy can be explicitly stated using the hypernym in com-
pound nouns or this relation can be stated implicitly Farbreibwalze
oscillating ink roller vs Farbreiber ink oscillator
 Synonymy
One of the goals in developing the linguistic criteriarules was to achieve a
one-to-one relation between the word formation pattern and the semantic class
of the objects In other words the signiant should indicate the class of the
signi as illustrated by the following rules
 Use conversion to indicate the process Wenden
 Use the nominalization with -ung or -or-er to indicate a complex device
Wendung Lngsschneider slitter7
6 This section is based on 21
7 The corpus indicates a complementary distribution of both patterns with only few
exceptions
 Use hypernym for composition of less complex parts Farbreibwalze Schneid-
messer cutting knife
 Use the following ranking of features to be included in the term 1 function
2 object 3 working principle 4 shape 5 material 6 temporal graduate
internal features cf 18 p 14
 Do not use more than 4 lexical morphemes in a compound noun 3 mor-
phemes are preferred
These criteria are intended to be an assistance rather than absolute rules
for selecting the preferred terms In case they lead to the selection of extremely
unusual forms established terms are preferred
These rules steps and roles in the terminology management process as well
as the denition of the data structure for the terminology database were xed in
a terminology manual Only after this denition task was completed the actual
standardization of the lexicon began Contrary to the manual which recom-
mended management similar to model B of ISO 15188 10 the initial standard-
ization followed rather model D The rst terminology draft was proposed by
the terminologist and consulted with the technical writers The nal form was
released only after consulting with the constructing engineers who gave their
feedback on every term in the draft
Applying the theoretical principles of terminology management by Wster
22 cf 1 the standardization process was concept-driven Manually extracted
terms were rst arranged into concept systems multiple arrangement of one term
was allowed and then given a denition Only after both the concept systems
and the denition were specied the preferred term was chosen according to the
rules described above
SDL MultiTerm was used from the very beginning In addition the initial
management employed MS PowerPoint concept systems and MS Excel def-
initions and synonyms in order to facilitate the feedback by the engineers
Moreover the workow software quickTerm by Kaleidoscope8 is now being im-
plemented which will help to shift back to the originally intended management
as in the model B
Currently the database contains 614 concepts 1689 terms covering almost
entirely the printing specic vocabulary for the operating manuals Roughly
30  of the German terms have an approved foreign-language equivalent in one
or more of the following languages English French Dutch Russian Swedish
and Spanish The equivalents are provided by the translation services based on
the given German terminology and are not double-checked by KBA before nal
release However quickTerm allows users to send their feedback on all languages
32 Syntactic and Stylistic Level
Unlike the lexical level where an eort was put in the linguistic evaluation
of the corpus data and development of systematic rules for word formation
8 httpwwwkaleidoscopeatDeutschSoftwareQuickTermquicktermphp
the development of the stylistic and syntactic rules was a byproduct of the
implementation of PI-Mod
PI-Mod uses XML elements to mark up information in a text according to its
semantics for instance as step descriptive precondition cause or
solution After agreeing on the elements needed for operating manuals the
standardization of syntax and style for some elements began This standardiza-
tion was necessary for a similar reason as the lexical one competing syntactic
patterns were in use for instance imperative verb form vs innite verb form
used as imperative in step in action full sentence vs ellipsis in cause
There is no record of the decision-making process for these rules as the fo-
cus of the CMS project was on the technical rather than linguistic specication
14 However the original writers manual and personal communication indicate
that the prescribed style patterns were a combination of so-called good practice
for technical documentation implicit or explicit but merely oral arrangements
among the writers and the standard examples used in the general PI-Mod spec-
ication
The rules can be divided into general and element specic rules Here are some
examples of the original recommendations developed during the CMS project
 Avoid Passive Voice
 Structure information logically for instance if  then or condition  step
 Element step as child element of action
Use the formal imperative verb form Sie
 Element symptom
Write from users perspective do not use questions
Example Mastarm fhrt nicht richtig hoch sentence with a nite verb9
 Element cause as child element of safetyadvice
Name the cause of the hazard with one word or in a short and expressive
sentence Use an exclamation point
Example 1 Verbrhungsgefahr durch herausspritzendes l ellipsis no nite
Example 2 ldruck in Arbeitshydraulik kann Manometer zerstren sen-
tence with a nite verb
 Element cause as child element of errordescription
Describe the cause of an error in one word or in a short and expressive
sentence
Example 1 Kein Kraftsto im Tank ellipsis no nite verb
Example 2 Pumpe hat zu wenig Leistung sentence with a nite verb
Initially the syntactic and stylistic rules were enforced by human editing
within the department Already at that point it became clear that some rules
remained ambiguous As demonstrated in the examples above some rules were
linguistically imprecise some lacked an explicit form some depended on some-
times contradicting examples and did not indicate whether they were recom-
mendations or prescriptions The room for interpretation lowered the consistency
9 Information in brackets was not indicated in the manual
of the texts and in consequence  the reuse Therefore the rules and examples
in the writers manual have been gradually replaced by more precise ones for
instance
 Element cause as child element of safetyadvice
Use ellipsis construction with no nite verb Do not use full sentences with
verbs Name the cause of the hazard with one word Verbrhrungsgefahr
Verbrennungsgefahr Use an exclamation point
Positive example Maschinenschaden durch liegengebliebenes Werkzeug
Negative example Liegengebliebenes Werkzeug fhrt zu Maschinenschaden
 Element cause as child element of errordescription
Use a full sentence with a verb Do not use ellipsis Use a period at the end
of the sentence
Positive example Kein Kraftsto ist im Tank
Negative example Kein Kraftsto im Tank
Further specication of the rules has been reinforced by the implementation
of a controlled language checker CLC Acrolinx10 since the rules had to be
easily transformed into a machine-readable form Hence the syntacticstylistic
level is being further consolidated
Although not used from the beginning a CLC was considered a medium-
term goal At this time the system is being implemented to t into the already
existing linguistic environment With respect to style and syntax KBA rules
are being mapped to the standard Acrolinx set of rules and the system is being
checked in a test environment Practical application is expected not earlier than
in the summer 2014 Despite oering solutions for terminology management
Acrolinx will solely be used for proofreading SDL MultiTerm will remain the
primary source for the lexical level of the language
4 Prospects
The four crucial projects resulting in the linguistic rules  CMS terminology
writers manual and translation  are completed Yet the maintenance and fur-
ther development of the rules is an on-going process Other tasks like the pro-
ductive use of a CLC are still to be accomplished More importantly described
development is normative only to the department of technical documentation
however other departments can obviously benet from the use of language re-
strictions as well Some applications might regard CAD models ERM mainly
terminology and press software both terminology and syntaxstyle Although
some ways of implementing a controlled language to these applications have al-
ready been explored they still remain a challenge for the future
Overall the main goal of modular approach and reuse still has to be evaluated
KBA is going to track the reuse applying the REx method 16 Resulting data
could then be used for further interpretation of the linguistic contribution to the
improved reuse11

5 Discussion
Before any specic issues concerning language at KBA can be discussed it needs
to be determined whether the rules and developments described above constitute
a controlled language
The term controlled language is not used in any internal documents to de-
scribe the lexical or syntactic rules for technical documentation Rather there
is an issue of terminology and writing rules Schreibregeln  both being treated
separately The constraints on the language are put into an overarching context
of standardization just like XML markup modular editing or data indexing in
the CMS This might be the result of the distribution of the linguistic decisions
over the four projects In consequence an explicit notion of a controlled language
has not yet emerged
From the theoretical point of view however the linguistic constraints at
KBA satisfy all of the criteria by Kuhn 12 p 123 They are based on just one
language and restrict its system on the orthographic morphological lexical syn-
tactic and textual level combining both prescriptive and proscriptive rules 5 p
228 Although no empirical studies are available we can assume that the output
is easily recognizable as German to an expert familiar with the sublanguage of
printing And nally although the already established forms that had developed
in an unsystematic way were preferred the codication of the forms in manuals
was a deliberate and to a certain extent systematic process Therefore we can
regard these linguistic constraints as a controlled language
Having claried the status of the linguistic constraints at KBA as controlled
language we can try to determine its type
We can apply to it the categories human-oriented and machine-oriented as
proposed by Huijsen 9 The development of the controlled language at KBA
indicates an expansion of originally predominant human-oriented language to a
language that comprises both human- and machine-relevant features but a clear
determination is dicult Both categories seem to be tendencies rather than a
dichotomy which supports the main view in the literature 9 p 2 cf 12 p
Moreover we can examine further motives for this controlled language There
are three main groups of motives discussed in the literature 1 to improve the
communication among humans 2 to improve the translation and 3 to represent
formal notations 12 p 125 cf 9 p 1 cf 19 p 225 cf 20 p 134 leading
Kuhn to postulate three main types of controlled languages 12 p 125 As
demonstrated above these motives were not of primary concern for the style
rules at KBA where the increase of reuse was the main goal The reuse issue of
a controlled language is not a new topic in the literature It has been discussed
in several case studies CTE 6 p 422 13 p 194 It is also mentioned in
some general overviews on controlled languages but it rarely seems to be the
major aspect discussed in detail 5 pp 206207 briey 8 p 11 15 p 248
17 p 62 left out 2 pp iiii 3 Clearly the reuse motive is missing in
the classication by Kuhn This might suggest the fourth type of a controlled
language  to improve the eciency of the authoring process for technical
documentation  an issue which seems to be underrepresented in the literature
Certainly a legitimate question may arise whether a controlled language for
the content reuse serves solely the purpose of ensuring the readability of the text
for the target audience As such it could be subsumed under the rst type of
controlled languages As we saw controlled language at KBA in particular the
vocabulary ensures not only the consistency of a text but also the retrieval of
modules and hence contributes to the reuse in various ways It is not to say that
KBA was unaware that the improved clarity and precision of a controlled lan-
guage have impact on the readability for the target audience as well as improve
human and machine-aided translatability and help control companys liability
in case of damage to persons or facilities 14 21 cf 11 p 443 cf 19 pp
225230 These secondary motives were certainly important for the support of
the projects at dierent management levels in the company cf 4 Modul 1 Yet
these general considerations only became tangible once the modular editing for
improving the reuse started to be implemented since in an obvious way the
modular approach jeopardizes the consistency with all the consequences
What is more the aspect of human understanding can also be found in
controlled languages for translation  a controlled language ensures a o a cor-
rect and readable output of human machine-aided or machine translation
Nonetheless controlled languages for translation constitute their own type Alto-
gether taken the classication by Kuhn as a starting point it seems by analogy
to the controlled languages for translation reasonable to add the fourth type of
controlled languages mentioned above to the classication
Another matter to discuss is the use of CLC and a general acceptance of a
controlled language Based on observation the need for the application of lan-
guage rules is generally understood and accepted by the technical writers First
tests of CLC seem to conform this However ambiguous terms lower the precision
of the CLC which is consistent with the diculties mentioned in the literature
9 p 8 15 p 252 Splitting the vocabulary into domains as suggested by the
software provider and by some authors 15 p 276 seems to lack of a good split-
ting criterion that would not cause too much term overlap between the domains
requiring some essential changes in the database denition and a reconsideration
of the concept-driven terminology management Currently dierent models for
software feedback and score in case of ambiguity are being tested Overall the
problem remains unsolved The main question concerning this type of feedback
is whether it will have an impact on the eectiveness and on general acceptance
of a CLC by the writers
Looking from a broader perspective the case of KBA sheds some light on
the more general issue of the acceptance of a controlled language by the writers
Godden reports on the diculties with the editor-centered model for CASL
at General Motors where the writers not previously trained in the rules were
reluctant to accepting the changes proposed by the editor Some better results
were achieved by a hybrid model requiring prior training of the writers 7 cf
5 pp 215216 cf 8 pp 107112 We do not have similar data concerning
machine editing at KBA yet but the experience with the human editing shows
a promising degree of acceptance of the language rules and proposed changes
in case of a clear violation of the rules I presume that there is a link between
cooperative approach to the denition of the rules resulting on the one hand
in a sense of community and on the other in a better comprehension of the
rules leading altogether to an increase of acceptance There has already been
an awareness of this phenomenon particularly in the literature on terminology
management 5 p 166 cf 17 p 63 but empirical studies are still needed
6 Concluding Remarks
The case of KBA shows that the notion of a controlled language needs to be
reexamined It can emerge as a result of deliberate decisions that are not neces-
sarily labeled and conceived as a design of a controlled language The distinction
between controlled languages and style guides is indeed vague 12 p 124 and
needs to be examined on a case by case basis and perhaps only at a given
point in time This also suggests that there might be more companies having
language regulations that do not see themselves as being concerned by the dis-
course of controlled languages Furthermore a new type of a controlled language
 to improve the authoring process for technical documentation  needs to be
considered
From the practical point of view the case of KBA shows that the develop-
ment in technology has made a controlled language more attainable There is
no longer a need for custom-built software solutions to implement the specica-
tions of a controlled language There is an array of standard software that can
be customized to t specic needs which makes a controlled language easier
and more aordable to develop and implement opening the eld to medium-size
companies
