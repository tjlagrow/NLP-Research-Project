Abstract
Word sense disambiguation has developed as a sub-area
of natural language processing as if like parsing it was
a well-dened task which was a pre-requisite to a wide
range of language-understanding applications First I
review earlier work which shows that a set of senses for
a word is only ever dened relative to a particular hu-
man purpose and that a view of word senses as part of
the linguistic furniture lacks theoretical underpinnings
Then I investigate whether and how word sense ambi-
guity is in fact a problem for NLP applications
What word senses are not
There is now a substantial literature on the problem of
word sense disambiguation WSD The goal of WSD
research is generally taken to be disambiguation be-
tween the senses given in a dictionary thesaurus or sim-
ilar The idea is simple enough and could be stated as
follows
Many words have more than one meaning When a
person understands a sentence with an ambiguous
word in it that understanding is built on the basis
of just one of the meanings So as some part of the
human language understanding process the appro-
priate meaning has been chosen from the range of
possibilities
Stated in this way it would seem that WSD might be
a well-dened task undertaken by a particular mod-
ule within the human language processor This module
could then be modelled computationally in a WSD pro-
gram and this program performing as it did one of
the essential functions of the human language processor
would stand alongside a parser as a crucial component
of a broad range of NLP applications
There are problems with this view The simplest
stems from the observation that dierent dictionaries

very often give dierent sets of senses for a word A
closer investigation reveals a lack of theoretical foun-
dations to the concept of word sense The concept is
intimately connected to our knowledge and experience
of dictionaries but these are social artifacts created to
satisfy such human purposes as playing word-games re-
solving family arguments and making prots for pub-
lishers Amid all these competing goals the pursuit of
truth is not always dominant
In particular a standard dictionary species the
range of meaning of a word in a list possibly nested
of senses This is not the outcome of an analysis of
how word-meaning operates but is rather a response
to constraints imposed by
 tradition

 compactness
 a single simple method of access
 resolving disputes about what a word does and does
not mean
The format of the dictionary has remained fairly sta-
ble since Dr Johnsons day The reasons for the format
and the reasons it has proved so resistant to change and
innovation are explored at length in Nunberg 1994
In short the development of printed discourse particu-
larly the new periodicals in England in the early part of
the eighteenth century brought about a re-evaluation of
the nature of meaning No longer could it be assumed
that a disagreement or confusion about a words mean-
ing could be settled face-to-face and it seemed at the
time that the new discourse would only be secure if
there was some mutually acceptable authority on what
words meant The resolution to the crisis came in the
form of Johnsons Dictionary Thus from its inception
the modern dictionary has had a crucial symbolic role
as in-principle arbiter of disputes Hence the dictio-
nary with its implications of unique reference and au-
thority cf the Bible Further evidence for this po-
sition is to be found in McArthur 1987 for whom the
religious or quasi-religious tinge p 38 to reference
materials is an enduring theme in their history Sum-
mers 1988 whose research into dictionary use found
that settling family arguments was a major use p
114 cited in Bejoint 1994 p 151 and Moon 1989
who catalogues the use of the UAD Unidentied Au-
thorising Dictionary from newspapers letters pages to
restaurant advertising materials pp 6064
To solve disputes about meaning a dictionary must
be above all clear It must draw a line around a mean-
ing so that a use can be classied as on one side of the
line or the other A dictionary which dwells on marginal
or vague uses of a word or which presents word meaning
as context-dependent or variable or exible will be of
little use for purposes of settling arguments The pres-
sure from this quarter is for the dictionary to present
a set of discrete non-overlapping meanings for a word
each dened by the necessary and sucient conditions
for its application whatever the facts of the words
Lexicographers are vividly aware of the problem
They have frequently lamented the possibly-nested list
model Stock 1983 Hanks 1994 Fillmore and Atkins
1992 They know all too well the injustice it fre-
quently does to a words range of meaning and use
But WSD researchers at least until recently have gen-
erally proceeded as if this was not the case as if a sin-
gle program disambiguating perhaps in its English-
language version between the senses given in some hy-
brid descendant of Merriam-Webster LDOCE COM-
LEX Roget OALDCE and WordNet would be rele-
vant to a wide range of NLP applications1
The sets of word senses presented in dierent dic-
tionaries and thesauri have been prepared for various
purposes for various human users there is no a pri-
ori reason to believe those sets are appropriate for any
NLP application2
It seems likely that NLP application lexicons which
in the mid 1990s almost invariably hand-built
rather than MRD-derived will be application-driven
rather than resource-driven so will only contain the
word senses and make the word sense distinctions rele-
1The most promising recent WSD work is moving away
from this position determining the senses between which
the program is to disambiguate either directly from the
clusters in the corpus Schutze 1997 or through a small
amount of human input Clear 1994 or a choice of either

tionaries and elsewhere see Kilgarri 1992 1993 1997b
vant to the application They might not encounter word
sense ambiguity on anything like the scale that a brief
glance at a dictionary or at the WSD literature would
suggest The remainder of the paper addresses whether
this is so and what scale of problem word sense ambi-
guity causes for dierent varieties of NLP application3
Taxonomy
First let us distinguish ve types of application for
which WS ambiguity is potentially an issue
 Information Retrieval IR
 Machine Translation MT
 Parsing and
implicitly all those applications for
which parsing is one stage of processing
 Lexicography
 Residual core language understanding including
database front ends dialogue systems Information
Extraction as in MUC hereafter NLU
The intellectual anities of most recent WSD work are
with IR The problem of nding whether a particu-
lar sense applies to an instance of a word can be con-
strued as equivalent to the essential IR task of nding
whether a document is relevant to a query The homol-
ogy is made explicit at various points in the literature
Gale Church and Yarowsky 1992 Gale Church and
Yarowsky 1993
Most work in IR disregards syntactic structure en-
tirely stemming words so that clean cleaner clean-
ing and cleaned are all mapped to clean and then treats
a document as a bag of stems It does not use POS-
tagging or name-recognition although these are rela-
tively mature and reliable technologies for these tasks
within NLP and parsing has not been found to improve
IR performance the linguistic processing has not been
fast robust or portable enough and it is not in any case
clear whether it provides relevant information for the IR
task This is very much a live issue see Strzalkowski
1994 Strzalkowski and Vauthey 1995 for recent ev-
idence of the potential of NLP in IR However to date
IR has made progress through applying sophisticated
statistical techniques to documents treated as objects
without linguistic structure and this is the approach to
WSD which has recently ourished
Within IR WSD can be viewed as an alternative to
NLP rather than a technique within it If a statistical
model based on a bag of stems is inadequate one way to
3My sources include an informal email survey on the
CORPORA mailing list to which I had 28 responses
get closer to the meaning of a text is WSD another is a
linguistically-informed technique such as parsing They
are not mutually exclusive but nor are they readily
compatible
A high proportion of WSD research is oriented to-
wards IR yet it is not clear whether WSD has the po-
tential to signicantly improve IR performance In the
rst careful study of the question Krovetz and Croft
1992 conducted some experiments which suggested
that WS-ambiguity causes only limited degradation of
IR performance Their experiments were on the small
specialist CACM corpus They used a standard set
of queries for which correct answers are available
They compared system performance with ambiguity
and without ambiguity the with ambiguity condi-
tion was the normal situation while for the without
ambiguity condition all relevant terms had been man-
ually disambiguated in a simulation of a perfect WSD
program For this corpus and query-set they concluded
that a perfect WSD program would improve perfor-
mance by 2
Sanderson 1994 performed a similar experiment us-
ing pseudo-words A pseudo-word is a word formed
by pretending that two distinct words were a single
word with two meanings one corresponding to each
of the original words Thus the pseudo-word banana-
kalashnikov could be formed by replacing all instances
of banana and kalashnikov in a corpus by banana-
kalashnikov then a WSD program would have the task
of determining which were originally bananas which
kalashnikovs The method allowed Sanderson to reg-
ulate the degree of ambiguity in the corpus and to
model both accurate and inaccurate WSD programs
He found that introducing extra ambiguity did little
to degrade performance but when the WSD algorithm
made mistakes this did do harm Also in longer queries
the dierent words in the query will tend to be mutu-
ally disambiguating so WSD is probably only relevant
where the query is very short He concludes the per-
formance of IR systems is insensitive to ambiguity but
very sensitive to erroneous disambiguation p 149
Schutze 1997 rst distinguishes sense discrimina-
tion from disambiguation Discrimination involves
identifying distinct senses and classifying occurrences
of the word as belonging to one of those senses It does
not involve labelling the senses which correspond to
clusters of occurrences or associating them with any
external knowledge source such as a dictionary Thus
in keeping with the spirit of this paper his senses are
automatically devised to match the corpus System per-
formance improved by up to 434 with the addition
4They cite an improved average precision over 11 levels
of recall of 144 compared to the baseline from 299 to
of the disambiguation module and the added sophisti-
cation that a word can be assigned to more than one
word sense where it is near more than one in vector
space
It is debatable how important an improvement of 2
or 4 percentage points is On the one hand WSD will
clearly not revolutionise IR or render it a solved prob-
lem But IR is a fairly mature technology very widely
used by millions of users and an average 4 improve-
ment across all those users and all their many queries
could be seen as very signicant indeed
Machine Translation
In IR it is generally dicult to assign blame for poor
performance to word sense ambiguity or any other spe-
cic source MT by contrast wears its mistakes on its
sleeve It is abundantly clear to all in MT that word
sense ambiguity is a huge problem
The literature has surprisingly little to say about it
Hutchins and Somers 1992 point out the two variants
of the problem monolingual ambiguity where the word
is ambiguous in the source language and translational
ambiguity where speakers of the source language do
not consider the word ambiguous but it has two pos-
sible translations as when English blue is translated
dierently into Russian according to whether it is light
blue or dark
MT is a technology rather than a science MT sys-
tems generally take a decade from idea to marketplace
so the theory available at their inception is destined to
be out of date by the time they perform Thus no re-
cent WSD work is employed in existing MT systems
They use extensive sets of selection restrictions paired
with semantic features to make it possible for the sys-
tem to make the correct lexical choice MT systems
usually use a number of very large lexicons where selec-
tion restriction information designed to resolve ambi-
guity problems accounts for a large proportion of the
bulk The SYSTRAN English-French lexicon respon-
sible for word choice contains 400 rules governing the
one English word oil and when it should be translated
as huile when petrole Hutchins and Somers 1992 p
One paper which does bring state-of-the-art WSD
to bear on Machine Translation albeit in experimen-
tal mode is Dagan and Itai 1994 They use a bilin-
gual lexicon to identify the possible translations and
a parsed target language corpus to gather information
about the tuples in which each of the possible trans-
lations is often found A tuple comprises a gram-
342 This improvement is 43 in absolute terms but
144 when calculated as an improvement on the baseline
performance
matical relation such as subject-verb and the oc-
cupier of each of the slots of that relation so The man
walked home would give the triple subject-verb
man walk The source-language text to be translated
in then parsed to give a source language tuple The
bilingual dictionary and the target-language statistics
are then used to nd the best match
The paper applies sophisticated WSD to a real prob-
lem with the discriminations that the system makes
being dened by the needs of the application
Parsing
Accurate parsing is a requirement for a wide range of
NLP applications so if WSD is critical for parsing ac-
curately it is by implication signicant for all those
applications that depend on parsing McCarthy 1997
explores WSD methods explicitly for purposes of im-
proving parsing Before assessing whether WS ambigu-
ity is critical let us take a step back
It is well-established that the problem of syntactic
ambiguity is AI-complete Hobbs et al 1992 p 269
Here let us focus on one particular but pervasive va-
riety of syntactic ambiguity prepositional phrase PP
attachment A problem is AI-complete if its solution
requires a solution to all the general AI problems of
representing and reasoning about arbitrary real-world
knowledge In principle any item of general knowledge
might be the datum required to make a PP-attachment
If that is all that can be said the outlook is bleak We
would hope that in practice a small and tractable sub-
set of general knowledge will resolve a high proportion
of ambiguities
Some approaches to high-quality parsing make exten-
sive use of machine-readable dictionaries MRDs In
the 1990s Microsoft have been the leading proponents
of MRDs-for-parsing5 The hypothesis behind the ap-
proach is that dictionary entries provide implicitly or
explicitly the information required to resolve most syn-
tactic ambiguities
Note that even if this hypothesis is true it does not
imply that WSD has an important role to play Lexi-
cal information can resolve many syntactic ambiguities
without being sense-disambiguated Consider
1 I love baking cakes with friends
2 I love baking cakes with butter icing
The PP attachment ambiguity is resolved along with
the ambiguity of with by the semantic class of the nal
noun phrase Where the head of this noun phrase is
5The method is used in the parser embedded in 1997 Mi-
crosoft Words grammar checker as demonstrated by Steve
Richardson at the ACL Conference in Applied NLP Wash-
ington DC 1997
human as in 1 the PP attaches to the verb Where
it is a cake ingredient it attaches to cakes Lexical in-
formation is required to determine the attachment in 1
and 2 but since neither friends nor icing is ambiguous
between humans and cake-ingredients disambiguation
is not required
That lexical information will resolve a high propor-
tion of syntactic ambiguities is one hypothesis that a
signicantly higher proportion will be resolved if the
lexical information is sense-specic is another
Almost no work has been done to test either hypoth-
esis Whittemore Ferrara and Brunner 1990 tested
and conrmed a related hypothesis that lexical pref-
erences of nouns and verbs for PPs of a particular
type are better predictors of PP-attachment than any
purely syntactic considerations They took a sample
corpus and counted the PPs that would be correctly
attached if each strategy was used To discover the
signicance of WS-ambiguity to parsing a study is re-
quired which combines this method with Krovetz and
Crofts of manually disambiguating to determine the
performance improvement that would be achieved with
a perfect WSD program
Lexicography
NLP is most aware of lexicographers as suppliers of
wares but they are also customers A linguistically an-
notated corpus is of more use to a lexicographer than
a raw one as he or she can then investigate the be-
haviour of a word in particular linguistic contexts with-
out having to trawl through large numbers of irrelevant
citations A sense-annotated corpus would be partic-
ularly valuable as the lexicographer would not have
to trawl through money bank citations when dening
river bank Clear 1994 There is then an intriguing
possibility that the behaviour of WSD programs will
feed back into the nature of the dictionary senses they
disambiguate between
For existing NLP applications requiring a deeper under-
standing of the text 99 of the ambiguity to be found
in a desk dictionary is not relevant This is rstly
because these applications deal only with very specic
text types The specic sublanguage generally means
that if a word has a meaning which is of interest it is
very likely that occurrences of the word will be being
used in that meaning and not some other Secondly
even then the application can only interpret those in-
puts for which there is a possible interpretation in the
knowledge base or in the systems output behaviour
Several respondents to the email survey where I asked
does WS ambiguity cause problems for your system
commented We dont have any semantics in our lexi-
con we just have hooks into the knowledge representa-
tion
Where a word has one sense in the domain model
and one or more outside it an NLU application can
generally determine whether the word is being used in
the domain sense by identifying whether the entire sen-
tence or query is coherent in terms of the domain model
If it is the word is almost certainly being used in the
domain sense Where a word has more than one do-
main sense it is unlikely that both will produce coher-
ent analyses The domain model will generally provide
disambiguating material not because it has been explic-
itly added but because type-checking and coherence-
checking which is necessary in any case will reject in-
valid senses
With time NLU systems will become more sophisti-
cated with richer domain models and less limitations in
the varieties of text they can analyse This will make
WSD more salient though dierent strategies will be
relevant for the foreground lexicon containing the key
words for the domain model and the background lex-
icon containing all other words Foreground lexicon
senses will be tightly-dened and domain-specic and
will be disambiguated by coherence-checking Back-
ground lexicon disambiguation will only need to be be-
tween coarse-grained senses Its function will be to in-
crease parse accuracy and statistical methods will be
appropriate The full argument is presented in Kilgar-
ri 1997
Answers
The answers to the question Does WS ambiguity
cause problems for NLP applications are
IR yes to some moderate degree Problems can
substantially be overcome by using longer queries
Within IR WSD features as something of an alter-
native to NLP
MT yes Huge problem with the problem space de-
ned by all the one-to-many and many-to-many map-
pings in a bilingual dictionary Addressed to date by
lots and lots of selection restrictions
Parsing not known
Lexicography yes WSD would be of benet
NLU not much NLU applications are mostly domain
specic and have some sort of domain model
is generally necessary to have a detailed knowledge
of the word senses that are in the domain so the
knowledge to disambiguate will often be available in
the domain model even where it has not explicitly
been added for disambiguation purposes

Yarowsky 1993
Most work in IR disregards syntactic structure en-
tirely stemming words so that clean cleaner clean-
ing and cleaned are all mapped to clean and then treats
a document as a bag of stems It does not use POS-
tagging or name-recognition although these are rela-
tively mature and reliable technologies for these tasks
within NLP and parsing has not been found to improve
IR performance the linguistic processing has not been
fast robust or portable enough and it is not in any case
clear whether it provides relevant information for the IR
task This is very much a live issue see Strzalkowski
1994 Strzalkowski and Vauthey 1995 for recent ev-
idence of the potential of NLP in IR However to date
IR has made progress through applying sophisticated
statistical techniques to documents treated as objects
without linguistic structure and this is the approach to
WSD which has recently ourished
Within IR WSD can be viewed as an alternative to
NLP rather than a technique within it If a statistical
model based on a bag of stems is inadequate one way to
3My sources include an informal email survey on the
CORPORA mailing list to which I had 28 responses
get closer to the meaning of a text is WSD another is a
linguistically-informed technique such as parsing They
are not mutually exclusive but nor are they readily
compatible
A high proportion of WSD research is oriented to-
wards IR yet it is not clear whether WSD has the po-
tential to signicantly improve IR performance In the
rst careful study of the question Krovetz and Croft
1992 conducted some experiments which suggested
that WS-ambiguity causes only limited degradation of
IR performance Their experiments were on the small
specialist CACM corpus They used a standard set
of queries for which correct answers are available
They compared system performance with ambiguity
and without ambiguity the with ambiguity condi-
tion was the normal situation while for the without
ambiguity condition all relevant terms had been man-
ually disambiguated in a simulation of a perfect WSD
program For this corpus and query-set they concluded
that a perfect WSD program would improve perfor-
mance by 2
Sanderson 1994 performed a similar experiment us-
ing pseudo-words A pseudo-word is a word formed
by pretending that two distinct words were a single
word with two meanings one corresponding to each
of the original words Thus the pseudo-word banana-
kalashnikov could be formed by replacing all instances
of banana and kalashnikov in a corpus by banana-
kalashnikov then a WSD program would have the task
of determining which were originally bananas which
kalashnikovs The method allowed Sanderson to reg-
ulate the degree of ambiguity in the corpus and to
model both accurate and inaccurate WSD programs
He found that introducing extra ambiguity did little
to degrade performance but when the WSD algorithm
made mistakes this did do harm Also in longer queries
the dierent words in the query will tend to be mutu-
ally disambiguating so WSD is probably only relevant
where the query is very short He concludes the per-
formance of IR systems is insensitive to ambiguity but
very sensitive to erroneous disambiguation p 149
Schutze 1997 rst distinguishes sense discrimina-
tion from disambiguation Discrimination involves
identifying distinct senses and classifying occurrences
of the word as belonging to one of those senses It does
not involve labelling the senses which correspond to
clusters of occurrences or associating them with any
external knowledge source such as a dictionary Thus
in keeping with the spirit of this paper his senses are
automatically devised to match the corpus System per-
formance improved by up to 434 with the addition
4They cite an improved average precision over 11 levels
of recall of 144 compared to the baseline from 299 to
of the disambiguation module and the added sophisti-
cation that a word can be assigned to more than one
word sense where it is near more than one in vector
space
It is debatable how important an improvement of 2
or 4 percentage points is On the one hand WSD will
clearly not revolutionise IR or render it a solved prob-
lem But IR is a fairly mature technology very widely
used by millions of users and an average 4 improve-
ment across all those users and all their many queries
could be seen as very signicant indeed
Machine Translation
In IR it is generally dicult to assign blame for poor
performance to word sense ambiguity or any other spe-
cic source MT by contrast wears its mistakes on its
sleeve It is abundantly clear to all in MT that word
sense ambiguity is a huge problem
The literature has surprisingly little to say about it
Hutchins and Somers 1992 point out the two variants
of the problem monolingual ambiguity where the word
is ambiguous in the source language and translational
ambiguity where speakers of the source language do
not consider the word ambiguous but it has two pos-
sible translations as when English blue is translated
dierently into Russian according to whether it is light
blue or dark
MT is a technology rather than a science MT sys-
tems generally take a decade from idea to marketplace
so the theory available at their inception is destined to
be out of date by the time they perform Thus no re-
cent WSD work is employed in existing MT systems
They use extensive sets of selection restrictions paired
with semantic features to make it possible for the sys-
tem to make the correct lexical choice MT systems
usually use a number of very large lexicons where selec-
tion restriction information designed to resolve ambi-
guity problems accounts for a large proportion of the
bulk The SYSTRAN English-French lexicon respon-
sible for word choice contains 400 rules governing the
one English word oil and when it should be translated
as huile when petrole Hutchins and Somers 1992 p
One paper which does bring state-of-the-art WSD
to bear on Machine Translation albeit in experimen-
tal mode is Dagan and Itai 1994 They use a bilin-
gual lexicon to identify the possible translations and
a parsed target language corpus to gather information
about the tuples in which each of the possible trans-
lations is often found A tuple comprises a gram-
342 This improvement is 43 in absolute terms but
144 when calculated as an improvement on the baseline
performance
matical relation such as subject-verb and the oc-
cupier of each of the slots of that relation so The man
walked home would give the triple subject-verb
man walk The source-language text to be translated
in then parsed to give a source language tuple The
bilingual dictionary and the target-language statistics
are then used to nd the best match
The paper applies sophisticated WSD to a real prob-
lem with the discriminations that the system makes
being dened by the needs of the application
Parsing
Accurate parsing is a requirement for a wide range of
NLP applications so if WSD is critical for parsing ac-
curately it is by implication signicant for all those
applications that depend on parsing McCarthy 1997
explores WSD methods explicitly for purposes of im-
proving parsing Before assessing whether WS ambigu-
ity is critical let us take a step back
It is well-established that the problem of syntactic
ambiguity is AI-complete Hobbs et al 1992 p 269
Here let us focus on one particular but pervasive va-
riety of syntactic ambiguity prepositional phrase PP
attachment A problem is AI-complete if its solution
requires a solution to all the general AI problems of
representing and reasoning about arbitrary real-world
knowledge In principle any item of general knowledge
might be the datum required to make a PP-attachment
If that is all that can be said the outlook is bleak We
would hope that in practice a small and tractable sub-
set of general knowledge will resolve a high proportion
of ambiguities
Some approaches to high-quality parsing make exten-
sive use of machine-readable dictionaries MRDs In
the 1990s Microsoft have been the leading proponents
of MRDs-for-parsing5 The hypothesis behind the ap-
proach is that dictionary entries provide implicitly or
explicitly the information required to resolve most syn-
tactic ambiguities
Note that even if this hypothesis is true it does not
imply that WSD has an important role to play Lexi-
cal information can resolve many syntactic ambiguities
without being sense-disambiguated Consider
1 I love baking cakes with friends
2 I love baking cakes with butter icing
The PP attachment ambiguity is resolved along with
the ambiguity of with by the semantic class of the nal
noun phrase Where the head of this noun phrase is
5The method is used in the parser embedded in 1997 Mi-
crosoft Words grammar checker as demonstrated by Steve
Richardson at the ACL Conference in Applied NLP Wash-
ington DC 1997
human as in 1 the PP attaches to the verb Where
it is a cake ingredient it attaches to cakes Lexical in-
formation is required to determine the attachment in 1
and 2 but since neither friends nor icing is ambiguous
between humans and cake-ingredients disambiguation
is not required
That lexical information will resolve a high propor-
tion of syntactic ambiguities is one hypothesis that a
signicantly higher proportion will be resolved if the
lexical information is sense-specic is another
Almost no work has been done to test either hypoth-
esis Whittemore Ferrara and Brunner 1990 tested
and conrmed a related hypothesis that lexical pref-
erences of nouns and verbs for PPs of a particular
type are better predictors of PP-attachment than any
purely syntactic considerations They took a sample
corpus and counted the PPs that would be correctly
attached if each strategy was used To discover the
signicance of WS-ambiguity to parsing a study is re-
quired which combines this method with Krovetz and
Crofts of manually disambiguating to determine the
performance improvement that would be achieved with
a perfect WSD program
Lexicography
NLP is most aware of lexicographers as suppliers of
wares but they are also customers A linguistically an-
notated corpus is of more use to a lexicographer than
a raw one as he or she can then investigate the be-
haviour of a word in particular linguistic contexts with-
out having to trawl through large numbers of irrelevant
citations A sense-annotated corpus would be partic-
ularly valuable as the lexicographer would not have
to trawl through money bank citations when dening
river bank Clear 1994 There is then an intriguing
possibility that the behaviour of WSD programs will
feed back into the nature of the dictionary senses they
disambiguate between
For existing NLP applications requiring a deeper under-
standing of the text 99 of the ambiguity to be found
in a desk dictionary is not relevant This is rstly
because these applications deal only with very specic
text types The specic sublanguage generally means
that if a word has a meaning which is of interest it is
very likely that occurrences of the word will be being
used in that meaning and not some other Secondly
even then the application can only interpret those in-
puts for which there is a possible interpretation in the
knowledge base or in the systems output behaviour
Several respondents to the email survey where I asked
does WS ambiguity cause problems for your system
commented We dont have any semantics in our lexi-
con we just have hooks into the knowledge representa-
tion
Where a word has one sense in the domain model
and one or more outside it an NLU application can
generally determine whether the word is being used in
the domain sense by identifying whether the entire sen-
tence or query is coherent in terms of the domain model
If it is the word is almost certainly being used in the
domain sense Where a word has more than one do-
main sense it is unlikely that both will produce coher-
ent analyses The domain model will generally provide
disambiguating material not because it has been explic-
itly added but because type-checking and coherence-
checking which is necessary in any case will reject in-
valid senses
With time NLU systems will become more sophisti-
cated with richer domain models and less limitations in
the varieties of text they can analyse This will make
WSD more salient though dierent strategies will be
relevant for the foreground lexicon containing the key
words for the domain model and the background lex-
icon containing all other words Foreground lexicon
senses will be tightly-dened and domain-specic and
will be disambiguated by coherence-checking Back-
ground lexicon disambiguation will only need to be be-
tween coarse-grained senses Its function will be to in-
crease parse accuracy and statistical methods will be
appropriate The full argument is presented in Kilgar-
ri 1997
Answers
The answers to the question Does WS ambiguity
cause problems for NLP applications are
IR yes to some moderate degree Problems can
substantially be overcome by using longer queries
Within IR WSD features as something of an alter-
native to NLP
MT yes Huge problem with the problem space de-
ned by all the one-to-many and many-to-many map-
pings in a bilingual dictionary Addressed to date by
lots and lots of selection restrictions
Parsing not known
Lexicography yes WSD would be of benet
NLU not much NLU applications are mostly domain
specic and have some sort of domain model
is generally necessary to have a detailed knowledge
of the word senses that are in the domain so the
knowledge to disambiguate will often be available in
the domain model even where it has not explicitly
been added for disambiguation purposes
