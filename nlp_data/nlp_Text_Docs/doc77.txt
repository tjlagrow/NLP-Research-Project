Abstract
This paper presents a corpus-based method
to assign grammatical subjectobject re-
lations to ambiguous German constructs
It makes use of an unsupervised learning
procedure to collect training and test data
and the back-o model to make assignment
decisions
1 Introduction
Assigning a parse structure to the German sentence
1 involves addressing the fact that it is syntacti-
cally ambiguous
1 Eine hohe Inationsrate erwartet die Okonomin
expects the economist
a high ination rate
The economist expects a high ination rate
In this sentence it must be determined which nom-
inal phrase is the subject of the verb The verb er-
warten to expect takes in one reading a nom-
inative NP as its subject and an accusative NP as
its object The nominal phrases preceding and fol-
lowing the verb in 1 are both ambiguous with
respect to case they may be nominative or ac-
cusative Further both NPs agree in number with
the verb and since in German any major con-
stituent may be fronted in a verb-second clause
both NPs may be the subjectobject of the verb
In this example morpho-syntactical information is
not sucient to determine that the nominal phrase
N P die Okonomin the economist is the subject of
the verb and N P Eine hohe Inationsrate a high
ination rate its object
Determining the subjectobject of an ambiguous
construct such as 1 with a knowledge-based ap-
proach requires at least a lexical representation
specifying the classes of entities which may serve as
arguments in the relations denoted by each verb
in the vocabulary as well as membership informa-
tion with respect to these classes for all entities de-
noted by nouns in the vocabulary One problem with
this approach is that it is usually not available for a
broad-coverage system
This paper proposes an approximation similar to
the empirical approaches to PP attachment decision
Hindle and Rooth 1993 Ratnaparkhi Reynar and
Roukos 1994 Collins and Brooks 1995 These
make use of unambiguous examples provided by a
treebank or a learning procedure in order to train a
model to decide the attachment of ambiguous con-
structs
In the current setting this approach in-
volves learning the classes of nouns occurring unam-
biguously as subjectobject of a verb in sample text
and using the classes thus obtained to disambiguate
ambiguous constructs
Unambiguous examples are provided by sentences
in which morpho-syntactical information suces to
determine the subject and object of the verb For in-
stance in 2 the nominal phrase N P der Okonom
with a masculine head noun is unambiguously nom-
inative identifying it as the subject of the verb In
3 both NPs are ambiguous with respect to case
however the nominal phrase N P Die Okonomen
with a plural head noun is the only one to agree in
number with the verb identifying it as its subject
2 Eine hohe Inationsrate erwartet der Okonom
expects the economist
a high ination rate
The economist expects a high ination rate
3 Die Okonomen erwarten eine hohe Inationsrate
the economists expect
a high ination rate
The economists expect a high ination rate
This paper describes a procedure to determine the
subject and object in ambiguous German constructs
automatically It is based on shallow parsing tech-
niques employed to collect training and test data
from unambiguous examples in a text corpus
and the back-o model to determine which NP in
a morpho-syntactically ambiguous construct is the
subjectobject of the verb based on the evidence
provided by the collected training data
2 Collecting Training and Test Data
Shallow parsing techniques are used to collect train-
ing and test data from a text corpus The corpus
is tokenized morphologically analyzed lemmatized
and parsed using a standard CFG parser with a
hand-written grammar to identify clauses containing
a nite verb taking a nominative NP as its subject
and an accusative NP as its object
Constructs covered by the grammar include verb-
second and verb-nal clauses Each clause is seg-
mented into phrase-like constituents including nom-
inative NC prepositional PC and verbal VC
constituents Their denition is non-standard for
instance all prepositional phrases whether comple-
ment or not are left unattached As an example
the shallow parse structure for the sentence in 4 is
shown in 4 below
4 Die Gesellschaft erwartet in diesem Jahr
expects in this year
the society
in Sudostasien
in southeast Asia a turnover
einen Umsatz
von 125 Millionen DM
from 125 million DM
The society expects this year in southeast Asia
a turnover of 125 million DM
S N C3snomacc Die Gesellschaft
V C3s erwartet
P C in diesem Jahr
P C in Sudostasien
N C3sacc einen Umsatz
P C von 125 Millionen DM
Nominal and verbal constituents display person and
number information nominal constituents also dis-
play case information For instance in the structure
above 3 denotes third person s denotes singular
number nom and acc denote nominative and ac-
cusative case respectively The set nom acc indi-
cates that the rst nominal constituent in the struc-
ture is ambiguous with respect to case it may be
nominative or accusative
Test and training tuples are obtained from shallow
structures containing a verbal constituent and two
nominativeaccusative nominal constituents Note
that no subcategorization information is used it suf-
ces for a verb to occur in a clause with two nom-
inativeaccusative NCs for it to be considered test-
ingtraining data
Training data consists of tuples n1 v n2 x
where v is a verb n1 and n2 are nouns and
x  1 0 indicates whether n1 is the subject
of the verb Test data consists of ambiguous tu-
ples n1 v n2 for which it cannot be established
which noun is the subjectobject of the verb based
on morpho-syntactical information alone
The set of training and test tuples for a given cor-
pus is obtained as follows For each shallow structure
s in the corpus containing one verbal and two nomi-
nativeaccusative nominal constituents let n1 v n2
be such that v is the main verb in s and n1 and n2
are the heads of the nominativeaccusative NCs in
s such that n1 precedes n2 in s In the rules below
i j  1 2 j 6 i and gi  1 if i  1 and 0
otherwise Note that the last element in a training
tuple indicates whether the rst NC in the structure
is the subject of the verb 1 if so 0 otherwise
Case Nominative Rule If ni is masculine and
the NC headed by ni is unambiguously nominative1
then n1 v n2 gi is a training tuple
Case Accusative Rule If ni is masculine and the
NC headed by ni is unambiguously accusative then
n1 v n2 gj is a training tuple
If ni but not nj agrees with
Agreement Rule
v in person and number then n1 v n2 gi is a
training tuple
Heuristic Rule If the shallow structure consists
of a verb-second clause with an adverbial in the rst
position or of a verb-nal clause introduced by a
conjunction or a complementizer then n1 v n2 1
is a training tuple see below for examples
Default Rule n1 v n2 is a test triple
For instance the training tuple Gesellschaft er-
warten Umsatz 1 society expect turnover is
obtained from the structure 4 above with the
Case Accusative Rule since the NC headed by
the masculine noun Umsatz turnover is unam-
biguously accusative and hence the object of the
verb The training tuple Inationsrate erwarten
Okonom 0 ination rate expect economist and
 Okonom erwarten Inationsrate 1 economist
expect ination rate are obtained from sentences
2 and 3 with the Case Nominative and Agree-
ment Rules respectively and the test tuple Ina-
tionsrate erwarten Okonomin ination rate ex-
pect economist from the ambiguous sentence in
1 by the Default Rule
1Only NCs with a masculine head noun may be un-
ambiguous with respect to nominativeaccusative case
in German
The Heuristic Rule is based on the observation
that in the constructs stipulated by the rule al-
though the object may potentially precede the sub-
ject of the verb this does not usually occur in writ-
ten text 5 and 6 are sentences to which this rule
applies
5 In diesem Jahr erwartet die Okonomin
expects the economist
in this year
eine hohe Inationsrate
a high ination rate
This year the economist expects a high
ination rate
6 Weil
die Okonomin eine hohe Inationsrate
because the economist a high ination rate
erwartet   
expects
Because the economist expects a high ination
rate    
Note that the Heuristic Rule does not apply to verb-
nal clauses introduced by a relative or interrogative
item such as in 7
7 Die Rate die
die Okonomin erwartet   
the rate which the economist expects   
3 Testing
The testing algorithm makes use of the back-o
model Katz 1987 in order to determine the sub-
jectobject in an ambiguous test tuple The model
developed within the context of speech recognition
consists of a recursive procedure to estimate n-gram
probabilities from sparse data Its generality makes
it applicable to other areas the method has been
used for instance to solve prepositional phrase at-
tachment in Collins and Brooks 1995
31 Katzs back-o model
1 denote the n-gram w1     wn and f wn
denote the number of times it occurred in a sample
text The back-o estimate computes the probabil-
ity of a word given the n  1 preceding words It
is dened recursively as follows
In the formulae
below wn1
 is a normalizing factor and dr a dis-
count coecient See Katz 1987 for a detailed
account of the model
Pbownwn1
 cid26P wnwn1
wn1
Pbownwn1
 if P wnwn1
 otherwise
where P wnwn1
 is dened as follows
P wnwn1
  df wn
f wn1
if f wn1
otherwise
32 The Revised Model
In the current context
instead of estimating the
probability of a word given the n1 preceding words
we estimate the probability that the rst noun n1 in
a test triple n1 v n2 is the subject of the verb v
ie P S  1N1  n1 V  v N2  n2 where S is
an indicator random variable S  1 if the rst noun
in the triple is the subject of the verb 0 otherwise
 only one relation
the precedence relationis relevant to the problem
in the current setting one would like to make use of
two implicit relations in the training tuplesubject
and objectin order to produce an estimate for
P 1n1 v n2 The model below is similar to that
in Collins and Brooks 1995
In the estimate Pbownwn1
Let L be the set of lemmata occurring in the
training triples obtained from a sample text and let
cn1 v n2 x denote the frequency count obtained
for the training tuple n1 v n2 x x  0 1 We
dene the count fson1 v n2  cn1 v n2 1 
cn2 v n1 0 of n1 as the subject and n2 as the ob-
ject of v Further we dene the count fsn1 v 
any object and analogously the count fon1 v of
n1 as the object of v with any subject Further
Pn2L fson1 v n2 of n1 as the subject of v with
we dene the counts fsv Pn1n2L cn1 v n2 1
and fov  Pn1n2L cn1 v n2 0 The estimate
Pi1n1 v n2 0  i  3 is dened recursively as
follows
P01n1 v n2  10
Pi1n1 v n2  cin1vn2
tin1vn2  if tin1 v n2  0
Pi11n1 v n2 otherwise
where the counts cin1 v n2 and tin1 v n2 are
dened as follows
fson1 v n2
fsn1 v  fon2 v
if i  3
if i  2
if i  1
tin1 v n2 
cin1 v n2 
fson1 v n2  fson2 v n1
if i  3
fsn1 vfon1 vfsn2 vfon2 v if i  2
if i  1
fsv  fov
The denition of P31n1 v n2 is analogous to that
of Pbownwn1
 In the case where the counts are
positive the numerator in the latter is the number
of times the word wn followed the n-gram wn1
training data and in the former the number of times
n1 occurred as the subject with n2 as the object of v
This count is divided in the latter by the number
of times the n-gram wn1
was seen in training data
and in the former by the number of times n1 was
seen as the subject or object of v with n2 as its
objectsubject respectively
However the denition of P21n1 v n2 is some-
it makes use of both the subject
what dierent
and object relations implicit in the tuple
P21n1 v n2 one combines the evidence for n1 as
the subject of v with any object with that of n2 as
the object of v with any subject
At the P1 level only the counts obtained for the
verb are used in the estimate although for certain
verbs some nouns may have denite preferences for
appearing in the subject or object position this in-
formation was deemed on empirical grounds not to
be appropriate for all verbs
When the verb v in a test tuple n1 v n2
does not occur in any training tuple the default
P01n1 v n2  10 is used it reects the fact that
constructs in which the rst noun is the subject of
the verb are more common
33 Decision Algorithm
The decision algorithm determines for a given test
tuple n1 v n2 which noun is the subject of the
verb v
In case one of the nouns in the tuple is
a pronoun it does not make sense to predict that
it is subjectobject of a verb based on how often it
occurred unambiguously as such in a sample text In
this case only the information provided by training
data for the noun in the test tuple is used Further
in case both heads in a test tuple are pronouns the
tuple is not considered The algorithm is as follows
If n1 and n2 are both nouns then n1 is the subject
of v if P31n1 v n2  05 else its object
In case n2 but not n1 is a pronoun redene ci and
ti as follows
cin1 v n2 cid26 fsn1 v
if i  2
if i  1
tin1 v n2 cid26 fsn1 v  fon1 v
fsv  fov
if i  2
if i  1
and calculate P21n1 v n2 with these new deni-
tions If P21n1 v n2  05 then n1 is the subject
of the verb v else its object We proceed analogously
in case n1 but not n2 is a pronoun
34 Related Work
In Collins and Brooks 1995 the back-o model
is used to decide PP attachment given a tuple
v n1 p n2 where v is a verb n1 and n2 are nouns
and p a preposition such that the PP headed by p
may be attached either to the verb phrase headed
by v or to the NP headed by n1 and n2 is the head
of the NP governed by p
The model presented in section 32 is similar to
that in Collins and Brooks 1995 however unlike
Collins and Brooks 1995 who use examples from
a treebank to train their model the procedure de-
scribed in this paper uses training data automati-
cally obtained from sample text Accordingly the
model must cope with the fact that training data is
much more likely to contain errors The next sec-
tion evaluates the decision algorithm as well as the
training data obtained by the learning procedure
4 Results
The method described in the previous section was
applied to a text corpus consisting of 5 months of the
newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung with ap-
proximately 15 million word-like tokens The learn-
ing procedure produced a total of 24178 test tuples
and 47547 training triples
41 Learning procedure
In order to evaluate the data used to train the model
1000 training tuples were examined Of these tuples
127 were considered to be partially incorrect based
on the judgments of a single judge given the original
sentence Errors in training and test data may stem
from the morphology component from the grammar
specication from the heuristic rule or from actual
errors in the text
411 Subcategorization Information
The system works without subcategorization in-
formation it suces for a verb to occur with a possi-
bly nominative and a possibly accusative NC for it to
be considered trainingtest data Lack of subcatego-
rization leads to errors when verbs occurring with an
ambiguous dative NC are mistaken for verbs which
subcategorize for an accusative nominal phrase For
instance in 7 below the verb gehoren to belong
takes in one reading a dative NP as its object and
a nominative NP as its subject Since the nomi-
nal constituent N C Bill is ambiguous with respect
to case and possibly accusative the erroneous tu-
ple Wagen gehoren Bill 1 car belong Bill is
produced for this sentence
7 Der Wagen gehort Bill
belongs Bill
the car
The car belongs to Bill
Another source of errors is the fact that any ac-
cusative NC is considered an object of the verb
For instance in sentence 8 the verb trainieren to
train occurs with two NCs Since the NC preced-
ing the verb is unambiguously nominative and the
one following the verb possibly accusative the train-
ing tuple Tennisspieler trainieren Jahr 1 ten-
nis player train year is produced for this sentence
although the second NC is not an object of the verb
8 Der Tennisspieler trainiert das ganze Jahr
the whole year
the tennis player trains
412 Homographs
In sentence 9 below the word morgen to-
morrow is an adverb However
its capitalized
form may also be a noun leading in this case to
the erroneous training tuple Morgen trainieren
Tennisspieler 0 since N C der Tennisspieler is un-
ambiguously nominative
9 Morgen
trainiert der Tennisspieler
the tennis player
tomorrow trains
The tennis player will train tomorrow
413 Separable Prexes
In German verb prexes can be separated from
the verb When a nite separable prex main verb
occupies the second position in the clause its prex
takes the last position in the clause core For exam-
ple in sentence 10 below the prex zuruck of the
verb zuruckweisen to reject follows the object of
the verb and a subordinate clause with a subjunc-
tive main verb This construct is not covered by the
current version of the grammar However due to
the grammar denition and since weisen is also a
verb without a separable prex in German C Er
weist die Kritik der Prinzessin is still accepted as a
valid clause leading to the erroneous training tuple
er weisen Kritik 1 he point criticism Such
errors may be avoided with further development of
the grammar
10 Er weist die Kritik
der Prinzessin seine
he rejects the criticism the princess
Ohren seien zu gro zuruck
He rejects the princess criticism that his ears
are too big
too big PRT
11 all words in the name Mexikanische Verband
fur Menschenrechte are capitalized Upon encoun-
tering the adjective Mexikanische the system takes
it to be a noun nouns are capitalized in German
followed by the noun Verband in apposition Sen-
tence 11 is the source of the erroneous training tu-
ple Mexikanisch beschuldigen Behorde 1 Mexi-
can blame public authorities
11 Der Mexikanische Verband fur Menschen-
for Human
the Mexican Association
rechte beschuldigt die Behorden
Rights blames
The Mexican Association for Human Rights
blames the public authorities
the public authorities
415 Multi-word lexical units
The learning procedure has no access to multi-
word lexical units For instance in sentence 12 the
rst word in the expression Hand in Hand is consid-
ered the object of the verb leading to the training
tuple Architekten arbeiten Hand 1 architect
work hand Given the information the system has
access to such errors cannot be avoided
12 Alle Architekten sollen Hand in Hand arbeiten
all architects
All architects should work hand in hand
should hand in hand work
416 Source Text
Not only spelling errors in the source text are the
source of incorrect tuples For instance in sentence
13 the verb suchen to seek is erroneously in the
third person plural Since Reihe series in German
is a singular noun and Kontakte contacts plu-
ral the actual object but not the subject agrees in
number with the verb so the incorrect tuple Reihe
suchen Kontakt 0 series seek contact is ob-
tained from this sentence
13 Eine Reihe von Staaten suchen geschaftliche
from states seek
a series
Kontakte zu der Region
contacts to the region
A series of states seek contacts to the region
business
Finally a large number of errors specially in test
tuples stems from the fact that soft constraints are
used for words unknown to the morphology
42 Decision Algorithm
414 Constituent Heads
The system is not always able to determine con-
stituent heads correctly For instance in sentence
In order to evaluate the accuracy of the decision al-
gorithm 1000 triples were selected from the set of
test triples Of these 285 contained errors based
Number Percent of test tuples Number correct Accuracy
Figure 1 The accuracy of the system at each level
on the judgements of a single judge given the origi-
nal sentence2 The results produced by the system
for the remaining 715 tuples were compared to the
judgements of a single judge given the original text
The system performed with an overall accuracy of
9049
A lower bound for the accuracy of the decision al-
gorithm can be dened by considering the rst noun
in every test tuple to be the subject of the verb by
far the most common construct yielding for these
715 tuples an accuracy of 8783
The above gure shows how many of the 715 eval-
uated test tuples were assigned subjectobject based
on the values Pn and the accuracy of the system at
each level
The accuracy for P2 and P3 exceeds 95 How-
ever their coverage is relatively low 2881 Since
the procedure used to collect training data runs
without supervision increasing the size of the train-
ing set depends only on the availability of sample
text and should be further pursued
One reason for the relatively low coverage is
the fact that German compound nouns consider-
ably increase the size of the sample space For in-
stance the head of the nominal constituent N C Der
Tennisspieler the tennis player is considered by
the system to be the compound noun Tennisspieler
tennis player instead of its head noun Spieler
player Consistently considering the head of pu-
tative compound nouns to be the head of nomi-
nal constituents may in some cases lead to awk-
ward results However reducing the size of the sam-
ple space by morphological processing of compound
nouns should be considered in order to increase cov-

Sentence 18 below was the source for the test tuple
Altersgrenze nennen Gesetz age limit mention
law The system incorrectly considered the noun
Altersgrenze to be the subject of the verb
18 Eine Altersgrenze nennt
das Gesetz nicht
an age limit
The law does not mention an age limit
mentions the law
There were no training tuples in which the com-
pound noun Altersgrenze occurred as the sub-
jectobject of the verb However the noun Gesetz
occurred more frequently as the object of the verb
nennen than as its subject leading to the erroneous
decision
5 Conclusion
This paper describes a procedure to automatically
assign grammatical subjectobject relations to am-
biguous German constructs It is based on an unsu-
pervised learning procedure to collect test and train-
ing data and the back-o model to make assignment
decisions The system was implemented and tested
on a 15-million word newspaper corpus
The overall accuracy of the decision algorithm was
almost 3 higher than the baseline of 8783 es-
tablished The accuracy of the procedure for tu-
ples for which a decision was made based on training
pairstriples P2 and P3 exceeded 95
In order to increase the coverage for these cases as
well as the overall performance of the procedure the
sample space should be reduced by morphologically
processing German compound nouns and the size of
the training set should be increased Further in the
experiment described in this paper the model was
trained with data obtained by an unsupervised pro-
cedure which performs with an accuracy of approxi-
mately 87 for training data Further development
of the morphology component and grammar deni-
tion should lead to improved results
