Abstract
Spoken language processing requires speech and nat-
ural language integration Moreover spoken Korean
calls for unique processing methodology due to its lin-
guistic characteristics This paper presents SKOPE a
connectionistsymbolic spoken Korean processing en-
gine which emphasizes that 1 connectionist and sym-
bolic techniques must be selectively applied accord-
ing to their relative strength and weakness and 2
the linguistic characteristics of Korean must be fully
considered for phoneme recognition speech and lan-
guage integration and morphologicalsyntactic pro-
cessing The design and implementation of SKOPE
demonstrates how connectionistsymbolic hybrid ar-
chitectures can be constructed for spoken agglutina-
tive language processing Also SKOPE presents many
novel ideas for speech and language processing The
phoneme recognition morphological analysis and syn-
tactic analysis experiments show that SKOPE is a vi-
able approach for the spoken Korean processing
Introduction
Spoken language processing challenges for integration
of speech recognition into natural language processing
and must deal with multi-level knowledge sources from
signal level to symbol level The multi-level knowledge
integration and handling increase the technical di-
culty of both the speech and the natural language pro-
cessing In the speech recognition side the recognition
must be at phoneme-level for large vocabulary contin-
uous speech and the speech recognition module must
provide right level of outputs to the natural language
module in the form of not single solution but many
alternatives of solution hypotheses The n-best list
 word-graph  and word-lattice 
techniques
are mostly used in this purpose The speech recogni-
tion module can also ask the linguistic scores from the
language processing module in a more tightly coupled
bottom-uptop-down hybrid integration scheme  In
the natural language side the insertion deletion and
substitution errors of continuous speech must be com-
pensated by robust parsing and partial parsing tech-

niques eg  Often the spoken languages are un-
grammatical fragmentary and contain non-uencies
and speech repairs and must be processed incremen-
tally under the time constraints 
Most of the speech and natural language systems
which were developed for English and other Indo-
European languages neglect the morphological process-
ing and integrate speech and natural language at the
word level   Often these systems employ a pro-
nunciation dictionary for speech recognition and inde-
pendent dictionaries for natural language processing
However for the agglutinative languages such as Ko-
rean and Japanese the morphological processing plays
a major role in the language processing since these lan-
guages have very complex morphological phenomena
and relatively simple syntactic functionality Unfortu-
nately even the Japanese researchers apply degenerated
morphological techniques for the spoken Japanese pro-
cessing   Obviously degenerated morphological
processing limits the usable vocabulary size for the sys-
tem and word-level dictionary results in exponential
explosion in the number of dictionary entries For the
agglutinative languages we need sub-word level inte-
gration which leaves rooms for general morphological
processing
The spoken language processing calls for multi-
strategic approaches in order to deal with signal level
as well as symbol
information in a symbiotic
and unied way Recent development of connection-
ist speech recognition  and connectionist natural
language processing 
shed lights on the connec-
tionistsymbolic hybrid models of spoken language pro-
cessing and some of the researches are already avail-
able for English and other Indo-European languages 
 We feel that it is the right time to develop con-
nectionistsymbolic hybrid spoken languages process-
ing systems for the agglutinative languages such as Ko-
rean and Japanese
This paper presents one of the such endeavors
SKOPE Spoken Korean Processing Engine that has
the following unique features 1 The connectionist and
symbolic techniques are selectively used according to
their strength and weakness The learning capability
fault-tolerant property and ability of simultaneous inte-
gration of multiple signal-level sources make the connec-
tionist techniques suitable to the phoneme recognition
from the speech signals but the structure manipula-
tion and powerful matching binding properties of the
symbolic techniques are the better choices for the com-
plex morphological processing of Korean However the
parallel multiple constraint relaxation capability of the
connectionist techniques are applied together with the
symbolic structure binding techniques for the syntactic
processing 2 The linguistic characteristics of Korean
are fully considered in phoneme recognition speech and
language integration and morphologicalsyntactic pro-
cessing 3 The SKOPE provides multi-level applica-
tion program interfaces APIs which can utilize the
phoneme-level or the morphological level or the syn-
tactic level services for the applications such as spoken
language interface voice information retrieval and spo-
ken language translation
We hope the experience of SKOPE development pro-
vide viable answers to some of the open questions to the
speech and language processing such as 1 how learning
and encoding can be synergetically combined in speech
and language processing 2 which aspects of system
architecture have to be considered in spoken language
processing especially in connectionistsymbolic hybrid
systems and nally 3 what are the most ecient way
of speech and language integration especially for ag-
glutinative languages
Characteristics of spoken Korean
This section briey explains the linguistic characterists
of spoken Korean before describing the SKOPE sys-
tem In this paper Yale romanization is used for rep-
resenting the Korean phonemes 1 A Korean word
called Eojeol consists of more than one morphemes
with clear-cut morpheme boundaries
2 Korean is
a postpositional language with many kinds of noun-
endings verb-endings and prenal verb-endings These
functional morphemes determine the nouns case roles
verbs tenses modals and modication relations be-
tween Eojeols 3 Korean is a basically SOV language
but has relatively free word order compared to the rigid
word-order languages such as English except for the
constraints that the verb must appear in a sentence-
nal position However in Korean some word-order
constraints do exist such that the auxiliary verbs repre-
senting modalities must follow the main verb and the
modiers must be placed before the word called head
they modify 4 The unit of pause in speech which is
called Eonjeol may be dierent from that of a written
text an Eojeol The spoken morphological analysis
must deal with an Eonjeol since no Eojeol boundary
can be provided in the speech 5 Phonological changes
can occur in a morpheme between morphemes in an
Eojeol and even between Eojeols in an Eonjeol These
changes include consonant and vowel assimilation dis-
similation insertion deletion and contraction 6 Ko-
rean has many rising diphthongs that are very similar to
speech input

mono-vowels at signal level Korean has well-developed
syllable structures and unlike Japanese that has only
CV1 type syllable Korean has all dierent types such
as CV VC V CVC Moreover in CVC type syllable
rst and second consonants are almost same in pronun-
ciation These signal characteristics make it dicult to
directly use phonemes or syllables as sub-word recogni-
tion units
The SKOPE architecture
The above spoken Korean characteristics and the rel-
ative strength and weakness of symbolicconnectionist
techniques result in the general SKOPE architecture
which is shown in gure 1 The architecture con-
sists of three dierent but closely interrelated modules
phoneme recognition morphological analysis and syn-
tactic analysis module The phoneme recognition mod-
ule processes the signal-level information and changes
it to the symbol-level information phoneme lattice
The morphological analysis begins the primitive lan-
guage processing and connects the speech recognition
to the language processing at the phoneme-level The
syntactic analysis module nishes the language process-
ing2 and produces the domain independent syntactic
structures for application systems The following sub-
sections briey describe each module

2We believe that the semantic and pragmatic processing
should be integrated into the domain knowledge for prac-
tical application under the current NLP technology so we
excluded the semantic and pragmatic processing from our
general model

Diphone-based connectionist phoneme
recognition
The phoneme recognition is performed by developing
the hierarchically organized group of TDNNs time de-
lay neural networks  Considering the signal char-
acteristics of the Korean phonemes we dene diphones
as a new sub-word recognition unit The dened di-
phones are shown in gure 2 and are classied into four
dierent types The diphones have the co-articulation
handling features similar to the popular triphones 
but are much fewer in numbers
Figure 3 shows the architecture of the component
TDNNs in the phoneme recognition module The whole
module consists of total 19 dierent TDNNs for recog-
nition of the dened Korean diphones The top-level
TDNN identies the 18 vowel groups of diphones we re-
classied the total 672 diphones into 18 dierent groups
according to the vowels that are contained in the di-
phones The 18 dierent sub-TDNNs recognize the
target diphones
For the training of TDNNs we manually segment the
digitized speech into 200 msec range which includes
roughly left-context phoneme target diphone and right
context phoneme and perform 512 order FFTs and
16 step mel-scaling 
to get the lter-bank coe-
cients Each frame size is 10 msec so 20 frames by
16 mel-scaling factor values are fed to the TDNNs
with the proper output symbols that is vowel group
name or target diphone names After the training of
each TDNN the phoneme recognition is performed by
feeding 200 msec signals to the vowel group identica-
tion network and subsequently to the proper diphone
recognition network The 200 msec signals are shifted
by 30 msec steps and continuously fed to the networks
to process the continuous speech in an Eonjeol From
the resulting diphone sequences the necessary phoneme
lattice has to be constructed We use a simple deter-
ministic decoding heuristics and try to maintain all the
possible diphone spotting results since the later phono-
logicalmorphological processing can safely prune the
incorrect recognitions The decoding begins by group-
ing the diphones into the same types see gure 2 The
frequency count for each diphone that is the number
of specic diphones per 30 msec frame shift is utilized

quency count diphones and nally the diphones are
split into the constituent phonemes by merging the
same phonemes in the neighboring diphones
Table-driven morphological and
phonological analysis
The morphological analysis starts with the phoneme
lattice The phoneme lattice delivers the alternative
phonetic transcriptions3 of input speech which must be
searched by the morphologicalphonological analyzer to
reconstruct the orthographic morpheme strings The
conventional morphological analysis procedure  that
is morpheme segmentation morphotactics modeling
and orthographic rule or phonological rule modeling
must be augmented and extended as the followings 1
The conventional morpheme segmentation is extended
to deal with the exponential number of phoneme se-
quences and between-morpheme phonological changes
during the segmentation 2 the morphotactics model-
ing is extended to cope with the complex verb and noun-
endings or postpositions and 3 the orthographic rule
modeling is combined with the phonological rule mod-
eling to correctly transform the phonetic transcriptions
to the orthographic morpheme sequences
The central part of the morphological analysis lies
in the dictionary construction In our dictionary each

in the sense that each phoneme is pronounced as it is writ-
ten That is why we sometimes use phonetic and phonemic
interchangeably

The extended morphological analysis is based on the
well-known tabular parsing technique for context-free
language  and augmented to handle the Korean
phonological rules and phoneme-lattice input Figure 5
shows our extended table-driven morphological anal-
ysis process The example phoneme lattice was ob-
tained from the input speech ci-wul-sswu removable
and the morphological analysis produces ci-wulswu
removeADNOMINALBOUND-NOUN where 
is the morpheme boundary and - is the syllable bound-
The extended morpheme segmentation is basically
performed using the dictionary search During the left-
to-right scan of the input phoneme lattice when a mor-
pheme boundary is found in the lattice the morpheme
is enrolled in the triangular table in an appropriate po-
sition For example in gure 5 morphemes such as
ci-wu l swu etc are enrolled in the table position
13 44 56 etc The position ij designates
the starting and ending position of the enrolled mor-
phemes However since the input is a phoneme-lattice
total exponential time is required to nd all the possible
morpheme boundaries To cope with such exponential
explosion the dictionary is organized as trie structure
 using the phonetic transcriptions as trie indices
and breadth-rst search of the trie can prune the un-
necessary phoneme sequences earlier in the search
The morphotactics modeling is necessary after all
the morphemes are enrolled in the table in order to
combine only legal morphemes into an Eojeol Ko-
rean word and the process is called morpheme-
connectivity-checking Since Korean has well developed
postpositions noun-ending verb-ending prenal verb-
ending which play as grammatical functional mor-
phemes we must assign each morpheme proper part-of-
speech POS tags for the ecient connectivity check-
ing Our more than 200 POS tags which are rened
from the 13 major Korean lexical categories are hierar-
chically organized and contained in the dictionary in
the name of morphological connectivity see gure 4
In the case of idiomatic expressions we place such id-
ioms directly in the dictionary for eciency where two
dierent POS tags are necessary for the left and the
right morphological connectivity For single morpheme
the left and the right POS tags are always same The
separate morpheme-connectivity-matrix indicates the
legal morpheme combinations and the morphotactics
modeling is performed using the POS tags in the dic-
tionary and morpheme-connectivity-matrix
The orthographic rule modeling must be integrated
with the phonological rule modeling in spoken language
processing Since we must deal with the phoneme lat-
tice the conventional rule-based modeling requires ex-
ponential number of rule application  So our so-
lution is based on the declarative modeling of both or-
thographic and phonological rules in uniform way That
is in our dictionary the conjugated verb forms as well
as the original verb forms are enrolled and the same
morphological connectivity information is applied The
phonological rule modeling is also accomplished declar-
atively by having the phonemic connectivity informa-
tion in the dictionary The phonemic connectivity infor-
mation for each morpheme declares the possible phone-
mic changes in the rst left and last right positioned
phonemes in the morpheme and the separate phoneme-
connectivity-matrix indicates the legal sound combina-
tions in Korean phonology For example in gure 5 the
morpheme l can be combined with the morpheme swu
during the morpheme connectivity checking even if swu
is actually pronounced as sswu because the phoneme-
connectivity-matrix supports the legality of the combi-
nation of l sound with ss sound4 In this way we can
declaratively model all the major Korean phonology
rules such as second consonant standardization con-
sonant assimilation palatalization glotalization inser-
tion deletion and contraction
Table-driven connectionistsymbolic
syntax analysis
The phoneme lattice-based morphological analysis pro-
duces the morphologically analyzed segmented and
stem reconstructed morpheme sequences Since there
are usually more than one analysis results due to the
errors of speech recognition process the outputs are
usually organized as morpheme lattice For the seam-
less integration of the morphological analysis with the
syntax analysis we employ the same table-driven con-
trol for the syntax analysis as well as the morphological
analysis
We extend the category formation and functional
application rules in the previous categorial unication
grammar  to deal with the word order variations
in Korean

 if category a  C and category set S  C then aS

The syntax analysis is performed by interactive relax-
ation spreading activation parsing on the categorial
grammar where the position of the functional applica-
tions are controlled by a triangular table The original
interactive relaxation parsing  was extended to pro-
vide ecient constituent searching and expectation gen-
eration through positional information provided by cat-
egorical grammar and triangular table Figure 6 shows
table-driven interactive relaxation parsing
The interactive relaxation process consists of the fol-
lowing three steps that are repetitively executed 1 add
nodes 2 spread activation and 3 decay
add nodes Grammar nodes syntactic categories from
the dictionary are added for each sense of the
morphemes when the parsing begins A grammar
node which has more activation than the predened
threshold  generates new nodes in the proper po-
sitions to be discussed shortly The newly gener-
ated nodes search for the constituents expectations
which are in the appropriate table positions and are
of proper function applicable categories For exam-
ple in gure 6 when npnp22 res it generates

spread activation The bottom-up spreading activa-
tion is as follows

where predened portion  of total activation a is
passed upward to the node with activation ai among
the n parents each with node activation aj In other
words the node with large activation gets more and
more activation and it gives an inhibition eects
without explicit inhibitory links  The top-down
spreading activation uniformly distributes

the source activation a
decay The nodes activation is decayed with time The
node with less constituents than needed gets penal-
ties plus decays
a  1  d  Ca
where a is an activation value d is a decay ratio and
Ca Cr is the actual and required constituents Af-
ter the decay the node with less activation than the
predened threshold  is removed from the table
The node generation and constituent search positions
are controlled by the triangular table When the node
aij acts as an argument it generates node only in
the position kj where 1  k  j and the generated
node searches for the constituents functors only in the
position ki-1 Or when the node is generated in the
position ik where j  k  numberof morphemes
it searches for the position j1k for its constituents
When the node acts as a functor the same position re-
strictions also apply for the node generation and the ar-
gument searching The position control combined with
the interactive relaxation guarantees an ecient lex-
ically oriented and robust syntax analysis of spoken
languages
Implementation and experiments
The SKOPE was fully implemented in UNIXC plat-
form and have been extensively tested in practical do-
mains such as natural language interface to operating
systems The phoneme recognition module targets 1000
morpheme continuous speech currently speaker depen-
dent due to the short of standard speech database for
Korean The unied morpheme-level phonetic dictio-
nary has about 1000 morpheme entries and compiled
into the trie structure The morpheme-connectivity-
matrix and phoneme-connectivity-matrix are encoded
with the special Korean POS part-of-speech symbols
and compressed
This section demonstrates the SKOPEs performance
in continuous diphone recognition morphological anal-
ysis and syntax analysis experiments For the con-
tinuous diphone recognition experiment we generated
about 5500 diphone patterns from the 990 Eojeol pat-
terns 66 Eojeols 15 times pronunciation for the train-
ing of TDNNs
In the performance phase the new
2600 test Eojeol patterns 260 Eojeol 10 times pro-
nunciation are continuously shifted with 30 msec step
and generate 7772 test diphone patterns disjoint from
the training patterns Figure 7-a shows the continu-
ous diphone recognition performance The correct des-
ignates that the correct target diphones were spotted
in the testing position and the delete designates the
other case The insert designates that the non-target
diphones were spotted in the testing position To com-
pare the ability of handling the continuous speech we
also tested the diphone recognition using the hand-
segmented test patterns with the same 7772 target di-
phones Figure 7-b shows the segmented diphone recog-
nition performance Since the test data are already
hand-segmented before input there are no insertion and
deletion errors in this case The fact that the segmented
speech performance is not much better than the contin-
uous one 938 vs 934 demonstrates the diphones
suitability to handling the continuous speech
For the morphological analysis performance we used
the same 990 Eojeol patterns to train the phoneme
recognition module and the 2600 Eojeol patterns to
test the morphological analysis performance directly
from the speech input Figure 8 shows the results
This experiment shows that most of the morphologi-
cal errors are propagated from the incorrect deleted or
spurious inserted phoneme recognition results To see

tactic analysis modules assuming no speech recognition

morphemes are also generated due to the speech inser-
tion errors
error we articially made the phoneme lattices by mu-
tating the correctly recognized phoneme sequences ac-
cording to the phoneme recognizers confusion matrix
Each phoneme lattice was made to contain at least one
correct recognition result so the phoneme recognition
performance is assumed to be perfect except the arti-
cially made insertion errors mutations In this way
we made 6 or 7 lattices for each of the 50 sentences
altogether 330 phoneme lattices The average phoneme
alternatives per single correct phoneme in the lattice
are 23 and average sentence length is 31 phonemes
This means there are average 2331 phoneme chains in
each lattice The used sentences are natural language
commands to UNIX  and are fairly complex which
have one or two embedded sentences or conjunctions
Figure 9 shows the morphological and syntactic analy-
sis results for these articially made phoneme lattices
For the syntactic level interactive relaxation we used
the following parameters which are experimentally de-
termined upward propagation portion  005 down-
ward propagation portion  003 decay ratio d 087
the node generation threshold  051 and the node
removal threshold  0066
The morphological analysis was perfect as shown in
the table Since the phoneme lattice was made to con-
tain at least one correct phoneme recognition result
the morphological analysis must be perfect as long as
the morpheme is enrolled in the dictionary and the con-
nectivity information can cover all the morpheme com-
binations This was possible due to the small number
of tested sentences 50 sentences This results verify
approaches to the advanced spoken language process-
ing model including optimizing TDNN-based phoneme
recognition module integrating HMM-based morpheme
recognition module into the connectionist phoneme
recognition and incorporating probabilistic searches
into the morphological analysis process as well as the
syntactic analysis process We are also developing ap-
plications on top of our SKOPE including speech-to-
speech translation system and intelligent interface agent
for UNIX operating system We hope our approach
could be extended to other agglutinative languages such
as Japanese Finish and Turkish and also to the lan-
guages that have complex morphological phenomena
such as German and Dutch

Figure 9 The morphological and syntactic analysis
from the articially made phoneme lattices
that most of the morphological analysis errors from real
speech input are actually propagated from the phoneme
recognition errors as discussed before However the
syntax analysis results are marginal here since we only
count the single best scored tree and we dont use yet
any semantic feature in the analysis The syntax anal-
ysis failures mainly come from 1 the insertion errors
articial mutations in the phoneme lattices5 which
result in ambiguous morpheme lattice and nally pro-
duce redundant syntax trees and 2 the inherent struc-
tural ambiguities in the sentence These failures should
be greatly reduced if we generate n-best scored parse
trees and let the semantic processing module select the
correct ones as is usually done in most of the probabilis-
tic parsing schemes
Conclusions and future works
This paper explains the design and implementation
of spoken Korean processing engine which is a con-
nectionistsymbolic hybrid model of spoken language
processing by utilizing the linguistic characteristics of
Korean The SKOPE model demonstrates the syner-
getic integration of connectionist and symbolic tech-
niques by considering the relative strength and weak-
ness of two dierent techniques and also demonstrates
the phoneme level speech and language integration for
general morphological processing for agglutinative lan-
guages Besides the above two major contributions
the SKOPE architecture has the following unique fea-
tures in spoken language processing 1 the diphones
are newly developed as a sub-word recognition unit for
connectionist Korean speech recognition 2 the mor-
phological and syntactic analysis are tightly coupled by
using the uniform table-driven control 3 the phonolog-
ical and orthographic rules are uniformly co-modeled
declaratively and 4 the table-driven interactive relax-
ation parsing and extension of the categorial grammar
can provide robust handing of word-order variations in

Abstract
Spoken language processing requires speech and nat-
ural language integration Moreover spoken Korean
calls for unique processing methodology due to its lin-
guistic characteristics This paper presents SKOPE a
connectionistsymbolic spoken Korean processing en-
gine which emphasizes that 1 connectionist and sym-
bolic techniques must be selectively applied accord-
ing to their relative strength and weakness and 2
the linguistic characteristics of Korean must be fully
considered for phoneme recognition speech and lan-
guage integration and morphologicalsyntactic pro-
cessing The design and implementation of SKOPE
demonstrates how connectionistsymbolic hybrid ar-
chitectures can be constructed for spoken agglutina-
tive language processing Also SKOPE presents many
novel ideas for speech and language processing The
phoneme recognition morphological analysis and syn-
tactic analysis experiments show that SKOPE is a vi-
able approach for the spoken Korean processing
Introduction
Spoken language processing challenges for integration
of speech recognition into natural language processing
and must deal with multi-level knowledge sources from
signal level to symbol level The multi-level knowledge
integration and handling increase the technical di-
culty of both the speech and the natural language pro-
cessing In the speech recognition side the recognition
must be at phoneme-level for large vocabulary contin-
uous speech and the speech recognition module must
provide right level of outputs to the natural language
module in the form of not single solution but many
alternatives of solution hypotheses The n-best list
 word-graph  and word-lattice 
techniques
are mostly used in this purpose The speech recogni-
tion module can also ask the linguistic scores from the
language processing module in a more tightly coupled
bottom-uptop-down hybrid integration scheme  In
the natural language side the insertion deletion and
substitution errors of continuous speech must be com-
pensated by robust parsing and partial parsing tech-

niques eg  Often the spoken languages are un-
grammatical fragmentary and contain non-uencies
and speech repairs and must be processed incremen-
tally under the time constraints 
Most of the speech and natural language systems
which were developed for English and other Indo-
European languages neglect the morphological process-
ing and integrate speech and natural language at the
word level   Often these systems employ a pro-
nunciation dictionary for speech recognition and inde-
pendent dictionaries for natural language processing
However for the agglutinative languages such as Ko-
rean and Japanese the morphological processing plays
a major role in the language processing since these lan-
guages have very complex morphological phenomena
and relatively simple syntactic functionality Unfortu-
nately even the Japanese researchers apply degenerated
morphological techniques for the spoken Japanese pro-
cessing   Obviously degenerated morphological
processing limits the usable vocabulary size for the sys-
tem and word-level dictionary results in exponential
explosion in the number of dictionary entries For the
agglutinative languages we need sub-word level inte-
gration which leaves rooms for general morphological
processing
The spoken language processing calls for multi-
strategic approaches in order to deal with signal level
as well as symbol
information in a symbiotic
and unied way Recent development of connection-
ist speech recognition  and connectionist natural
language processing 
shed lights on the connec-
tionistsymbolic hybrid models of spoken language pro-
cessing and some of the researches are already avail-
able for English and other Indo-European languages 
 We feel that it is the right time to develop con-
nectionistsymbolic hybrid spoken languages process-
ing systems for the agglutinative languages such as Ko-
rean and Japanese
This paper presents one of the such endeavors
SKOPE Spoken Korean Processing Engine that has
the following unique features 1 The connectionist and
symbolic techniques are selectively used according to
their strength and weakness The learning capability
fault-tolerant property and ability of simultaneous inte-
gration of multiple signal-level sources make the connec-
tionist techniques suitable to the phoneme recognition
from the speech signals but the structure manipula-
tion and powerful matching binding properties of the
symbolic techniques are the better choices for the com-
plex morphological processing of Korean However the
parallel multiple constraint relaxation capability of the
connectionist techniques are applied together with the
symbolic structure binding techniques for the syntactic
processing 2 The linguistic characteristics of Korean
are fully considered in phoneme recognition speech and
language integration and morphologicalsyntactic pro-
cessing 3 The SKOPE provides multi-level applica-
tion program interfaces APIs which can utilize the
phoneme-level or the morphological level or the syn-
tactic level services for the applications such as spoken
language interface voice information retrieval and spo-
ken language translation
We hope the experience of SKOPE development pro-
vide viable answers to some of the open questions to the
speech and language processing such as 1 how learning
and encoding can be synergetically combined in speech
and language processing 2 which aspects of system
architecture have to be considered in spoken language
processing especially in connectionistsymbolic hybrid
systems and nally 3 what are the most ecient way
of speech and language integration especially for ag-
glutinative languages
Characteristics of spoken Korean
This section briey explains the linguistic characterists
of spoken Korean before describing the SKOPE sys-
tem In this paper Yale romanization is used for rep-
resenting the Korean phonemes 1 A Korean word
called Eojeol consists of more than one morphemes
with clear-cut morpheme boundaries
2 Korean is
a postpositional language with many kinds of noun-
endings verb-endings and prenal verb-endings These
functional morphemes determine the nouns case roles
verbs tenses modals and modication relations be-
tween Eojeols 3 Korean is a basically SOV language
but has relatively free word order compared to the rigid
word-order languages such as English except for the
constraints that the verb must appear in a sentence-
nal position However in Korean some word-order
constraints do exist such that the auxiliary verbs repre-
senting modalities must follow the main verb and the
modiers must be placed before the word called head
they modify 4 The unit of pause in speech which is
called Eonjeol may be dierent from that of a written
text an Eojeol The spoken morphological analysis
must deal with an Eonjeol since no Eojeol boundary
can be provided in the speech 5 Phonological changes
can occur in a morpheme between morphemes in an
Eojeol and even between Eojeols in an Eonjeol These
changes include consonant and vowel assimilation dis-
similation insertion deletion and contraction 6 Ko-
rean has many rising diphthongs that are very similar to
speech input

mono-vowels at signal level Korean has well-developed
syllable structures and unlike Japanese that has only
CV1 type syllable Korean has all dierent types such
as CV VC V CVC Moreover in CVC type syllable
rst and second consonants are almost same in pronun-
ciation These signal characteristics make it dicult to
directly use phonemes or syllables as sub-word recogni-
tion units
The SKOPE architecture
The above spoken Korean characteristics and the rel-
ative strength and weakness of symbolicconnectionist
techniques result in the general SKOPE architecture
which is shown in gure 1 The architecture con-
sists of three dierent but closely interrelated modules
phoneme recognition morphological analysis and syn-
tactic analysis module The phoneme recognition mod-
ule processes the signal-level information and changes
it to the symbol-level information phoneme lattice
The morphological analysis begins the primitive lan-
guage processing and connects the speech recognition
to the language processing at the phoneme-level The
syntactic analysis module nishes the language process-
ing2 and produces the domain independent syntactic
structures for application systems The following sub-
sections briey describe each module

should be integrated into the domain knowledge for prac-
tical application under the current NLP technology so we
excluded the semantic and pragmatic processing from our

Diphone-based connectionist phoneme
recognition
The phoneme recognition is performed by developing
the hierarchically organized group of TDNNs time de-
lay neural networks  Considering the signal char-
acteristics of the Korean phonemes we dene diphones
as a new sub-word recognition unit The dened di-
phones are shown in gure 2 and are classied into four
dierent types The diphones have the co-articulation
handling features similar to the popular triphones 
but are much fewer in numbers
Figure 3 shows the architecture of the component
TDNNs in the phoneme recognition module The whole
module consists of total 19 dierent TDNNs for recog-
nition of the dened Korean diphones The top-level
TDNN identies the 18 vowel groups of diphones we re-
classied the total 672 diphones into 18 dierent groups
according to the vowels that are contained in the di-
phones The 18 dierent sub-TDNNs recognize the
target diphones
For the training of TDNNs we manually segment the
digitized speech into 200 msec range which includes
roughly left-context phoneme target diphone and right
context phoneme and perform 512 order FFTs and
16 step mel-scaling 
to get the lter-bank coe-
cients Each frame size is 10 msec so 20 frames by
16 mel-scaling factor values are fed to the TDNNs
with the proper output symbols that is vowel group
name or target diphone names After the training of
each TDNN the phoneme recognition is performed by
feeding 200 msec signals to the vowel group identica-
tion network and subsequently to the proper diphone
recognition network The 200 msec signals are shifted
by 30 msec steps and continuously fed to the networks
to process the continuous speech in an Eonjeol From
the resulting diphone sequences the necessary phoneme
lattice has to be constructed We use a simple deter-
ministic decoding heuristics and try to maintain all the
possible diphone spotting results since the later phono-
logicalmorphological processing can safely prune the
incorrect recognitions The decoding begins by group-
ing the diphones into the same types see gure 2 The
frequency count for each diphone that is the number
of specic diphones per 30 msec frame shift is utilized

quency count diphones and nally the diphones are
split into the constituent phonemes by merging the
same phonemes in the neighboring diphones
Table-driven morphological and
phonological analysis
The morphological analysis starts with the phoneme
lattice The phoneme lattice delivers the alternative
phonetic transcriptions3 of input speech which must be
searched by the morphologicalphonological analyzer to
reconstruct the orthographic morpheme strings The
conventional morphological analysis procedure  that
is morpheme segmentation morphotactics modeling
and orthographic rule or phonological rule modeling
must be augmented and extended as the followings 1
The conventional morpheme segmentation is extended
to deal with the exponential number of phoneme se-
quences and between-morpheme phonological changes
during the segmentation 2 the morphotactics model-
ing is extended to cope with the complex verb and noun-
endings or postpositions and 3 the orthographic rule
modeling is combined with the phonological rule mod-
eling to correctly transform the phonetic transcriptions
to the orthographic morpheme sequences
The central part of the morphological analysis lies
in the dictionary construction In our dictionary each

in the sense that each phoneme is pronounced as it is writ-

The extended morphological analysis is based on the
well-known tabular parsing technique for context-free
language  and augmented to handle the Korean
phonological rules and phoneme-lattice input Figure 5

ysis process The example phoneme lattice was ob-
tained from the input speech ci-wul-sswu removable
and the morphological analysis produces ci-wulswu
removeADNOMINALBOUND-NOUN where 
is the morpheme boundary and - is the syllable bound-
The extended morpheme segmentation is basically
performed using the dictionary search During the left-
to-right scan of the input phoneme lattice when a mor-
pheme boundary is found in the lattice the morpheme
is enrolled in the triangular table in an appropriate po-
sition For example in gure 5 morphemes such as
ci-wu l swu etc are enrolled in the table position
13 44 56 etc The position ij designates
the starting and ending position of the enrolled mor-
phemes However since the input is a phoneme-lattice
total exponential time is required to nd all the possible
morpheme boundaries To cope with such exponential
explosion the dictionary is organized as trie structure
 using the phonetic transcriptions as trie indices
and breadth-rst search of the trie can prune the un-
necessary phoneme sequences earlier in the search
The morphotactics modeling is necessary after all
the morphemes are enrolled in the table in order to
combine only legal morphemes into an Eojeol Ko-
rean word and the process is called morpheme-
connectivity-checking Since Korean has well developed
postpositions noun-ending verb-ending prenal verb-
ending which play as grammatical functional mor-
phemes we must assign each morpheme proper part-of-
speech POS tags for the ecient connectivity check-
ing Our more than 200 POS tags which are rened
from the 13 major Korean lexical categories are hierar-
chically organized and contained in the dictionary in
the name of morphological connectivity see gure 4
In the case of idiomatic expressions we place such id-
ioms directly in the dictionary for eciency where two
dierent POS tags are necessary for the left and the
right morphological connectivity For single morpheme
the left and the right POS tags are always same The
separate morpheme-connectivity-matrix indicates the
legal morpheme combinations and the morphotactics
modeling is performed using the POS tags in the dic-
tionary and morpheme-connectivity-matrix
The orthographic rule modeling must be integrated
with the phonological rule modeling in spoken language
processing Since we must deal with the phoneme lat-
tice the conventional rule-based modeling requires ex-
ponential number of rule application  So our so-
lution is based on the declarative modeling of both or-
thographic and phonological rules in uniform way That
is in our dictionary the conjugated verb forms as well
as the original verb forms are enrolled and the same
morphological connectivity information is applied The
phonological rule modeling is also accomplished declar-
atively by having the phonemic connectivity informa-
tion in the dictionary The phonemic connectivity infor-
mation for each morpheme declares the possible phone-
mic changes in the rst left and last right positioned
phonemes in the morpheme and the separate phoneme-
connectivity-matrix indicates the legal sound combina-
tions in Korean phonology For example in gure 5 the
morpheme l can be combined with the morpheme swu
during the morpheme connectivity checking even if swu
is actually pronounced as sswu because the phoneme-
connectivity-matrix supports the legality of the combi-
nation of l sound with ss sound4 In this way we can
declaratively model all the major Korean phonology
rules such as second consonant standardization con-
sonant assimilation palatalization glotalization inser-
tion deletion and contraction
Table-driven connectionistsymbolic
syntax analysis
The phoneme lattice-based morphological analysis pro-
duces the morphologically analyzed segmented and
stem reconstructed morpheme sequences Since there
are usually more than one analysis results due to the
errors of speech recognition process the outputs are
usually organized as morpheme lattice For the seam-
less integration of the morphological analysis with the
syntax analysis we employ the same table-driven con-
trol for the syntax analysis as well as the morphological
analysis
We extend the category formation and functional
application rules in the previous categorial unication
grammar  to deal with the word order variations
in Korean

 if category a  C and category set S  C then aS

The syntax analysis is performed by interactive relax-
ation spreading activation parsing on the categorial
grammar where the position of the functional applica-
tions are controlled by a triangular table The original
interactive relaxation parsing  was extended to pro-
vide ecient constituent searching and expectation gen-
eration through positional information provided by cat-
egorical grammar and triangular table Figure 6 shows
table-driven interactive relaxation parsing
The interactive relaxation process consists of the fol-
lowing three steps that are repetitively executed 1 add
nodes 2 spread activation and 3 decay
add nodes Grammar nodes syntactic categories from
the dictionary are added for each sense of the
morphemes when the parsing begins A grammar
node which has more activation than the predened
threshold  generates new nodes in the proper po-
sitions to be discussed shortly The newly gener-
ated nodes search for the constituents expectations
which are in the appropriate table positions and are
of proper function applicable categories For exam-
ple in gure 6 when npnp22 res it generates

spread activation The bottom-up spreading activa-
tion is as follows

where predened portion  of total activation a is
passed upward to the node with activation ai among
the n parents each with node activation aj In other
words the node with large activation gets more and
more activation and it gives an inhibition eects
without explicit inhibitory links  The top-down

the source activation a

node with less constituents than needed gets penal-
ties plus decays
a  1  d  Ca
where a is an activation value d is a decay ratio and
Ca Cr is the actual and required constituents Af-
ter the decay the node with less activation than the
predened threshold  is removed from the table
The node generation and constituent search positions
are controlled by the triangular table When the node
aij acts as an argument it generates node only in
the position kj where 1  k  j and the generated
node searches for the constituents functors only in the
position ki-1 Or when the node is generated in the
position ik where j  k  numberof morphemes
it searches for the position j1k for its constituents
When the node acts as a functor the same position re-
strictions also apply for the node generation and the ar-
gument searching The position control combined with
the interactive relaxation guarantees an ecient lex-
ically oriented and robust syntax analysis of spoken
languages
Implementation and experiments
The SKOPE was fully implemented in UNIXC plat-
form and have been extensively tested in practical do-
mains such as natural language interface to operating
systems The phoneme recognition module targets 1000
morpheme continuous speech currently speaker depen-
dent due to the short of standard speech database for
Korean The unied morpheme-level phonetic dictio-
nary has about 1000 morpheme entries and compiled
into the trie structure The morpheme-connectivity-
matrix and phoneme-connectivity-matrix are encoded
with the special Korean POS part-of-speech symbols
and compressed
This section demonstrates the SKOPEs performance
in continuous diphone recognition morphological anal-
ysis and syntax analysis experiments For the con-
tinuous diphone recognition experiment we generated
about 5500 diphone patterns from the 990 Eojeol pat-
terns 66 Eojeols 15 times pronunciation for the train-
ing of TDNNs
In the performance phase the new
2600 test Eojeol patterns 260 Eojeol 10 times pro-
nunciation are continuously shifted with 30 msec step
and generate 7772 test diphone patterns disjoint from
the training patterns Figure 7-a shows the continu-
ous diphone recognition performance The correct des-
ignates that the correct target diphones were spotted
in the testing position and the delete designates the
other case The insert designates that the non-target
diphones were spotted in the testing position To com-
pare the ability of handling the continuous speech we
also tested the diphone recognition using the hand-
segmented test patterns with the same 7772 target di-
phones Figure 7-b shows the segmented diphone recog-
nition performance Since the test data are already
hand-segmented before input there are no insertion and
deletion errors in this case The fact that the segmented
speech performance is not much better than the contin-
uous one 938 vs 934 demonstrates the diphones
suitability to handling the continuous speech
For the morphological analysis performance we used
the same 990 Eojeol patterns to train the phoneme
recognition module and the 2600 Eojeol patterns to
test the morphological analysis performance directly
from the speech input Figure 8 shows the results
This experiment shows that most of the morphologi-
cal errors are propagated from the incorrect deleted or
spurious inserted phoneme recognition results To see

tactic analysis modules assuming no speech recognition

are correctly recognized and analyzed and 198 can-

morphemes are also generated due to the speech inser-
tion errors
error we articially made the phoneme lattices by mu-
tating the correctly recognized phoneme sequences ac-
cording to the phoneme recognizers confusion matrix
Each phoneme lattice was made to contain at least one
correct recognition result so the phoneme recognition
performance is assumed to be perfect except the arti-
cially made insertion errors mutations In this way
we made 6 or 7 lattices for each of the 50 sentences
altogether 330 phoneme lattices The average phoneme
alternatives per single correct phoneme in the lattice
are 23 and average sentence length is 31 phonemes
This means there are average 2331 phoneme chains in
each lattice The used sentences are natural language
commands to UNIX  and are fairly complex which
have one or two embedded sentences or conjunctions
Figure 9 shows the morphological and syntactic analy-
sis results for these articially made phoneme lattices
For the syntactic level interactive relaxation we used
the following parameters which are experimentally de-
termined upward propagation portion  005 down-
ward propagation portion  003 decay ratio d 087
the node generation threshold  051 and the node
removal threshold  0066
The morphological analysis was perfect as shown in
the table Since the phoneme lattice was made to con-
tain at least one correct phoneme recognition result
the morphological analysis must be perfect as long as
the morpheme is enrolled in the dictionary and the con-
nectivity information can cover all the morpheme com-
binations This was possible due to the small number
of tested sentences 50 sentences This results verify
approaches to the advanced spoken language process-
ing model including optimizing TDNN-based phoneme
recognition module integrating HMM-based morpheme
recognition module into the connectionist phoneme
recognition and incorporating probabilistic searches
into the morphological analysis process as well as the
syntactic analysis process We are also developing ap-
plications on top of our SKOPE including speech-to-
speech translation system and intelligent interface agent
for UNIX operating system We hope our approach
could be extended to other agglutinative languages such
as Japanese Finish and Turkish and also to the lan-
guages that have complex morphological phenomena
such as German and Dutch

Figure 9 The morphological and syntactic analysis
from the articially made phoneme lattices
that most of the morphological analysis errors from real
speech input are actually propagated from the phoneme
recognition errors as discussed before However the
syntax analysis results are marginal here since we only
count the single best scored tree and we dont use yet
any semantic feature in the analysis The syntax anal-
ysis failures mainly come from 1 the insertion errors
articial mutations in the phoneme lattices5 which
result in ambiguous morpheme lattice and nally pro-
duce redundant syntax trees and 2 the inherent struc-
tural ambiguities in the sentence These failures should
be greatly reduced if we generate n-best scored parse
trees and let the semantic processing module select the
correct ones as is usually done in most of the probabilis-
tic parsing schemes
Conclusions and future works
This paper explains the design and implementation
of spoken Korean processing engine which is a con-
nectionistsymbolic hybrid model of spoken language
processing by utilizing the linguistic characteristics of
Korean The SKOPE model demonstrates the syner-
getic integration of connectionist and symbolic tech-
niques by considering the relative strength and weak-
ness of two dierent techniques and also demonstrates
the phoneme level speech and language integration for
general morphological processing for agglutinative lan-
guages Besides the above two major contributions
the SKOPE architecture has the following unique fea-
tures in spoken language processing 1 the diphones
are newly developed as a sub-word recognition unit for
connectionist Korean speech recognition 2 the mor-
phological and syntactic analysis are tightly coupled by
using the uniform table-driven control 3 the phonolog-
ical and orthographic rules are uniformly co-modeled
declaratively and 4 the table-driven interactive relax-
ation parsing and extension of the categorial grammar
can provide robust handing of word-order variations in
Korean
However current implementation of the system still
suers from excessive continuous speech recognition er-
rors Since the large vocabulary continuous speech
recognition is still an open problem we cannot hope
for the 100 correct speech recognition results in the
near future Currently we are pursuing multi-strategic
5Recall we generated average 23 phonemes per single
correct phoneme
