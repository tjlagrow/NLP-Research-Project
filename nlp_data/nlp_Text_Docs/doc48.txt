   Abstract  Present  human  languages  display  slightly  asymmetric  log-normal  Gauss 
distribution for size 1-3 whereas present cities follow power law Pareto-Zipf law4 Our 
model  considers  the  competition  between  languages  and  that  between  cities  in  terms  of 
growing multiplicative noise process5 and fragmentation 6 where relevant parameters 
are naturally different for languages and cities We consider lifetime distribution for old and 
living  languages  and  that  for  old  and  living  cities  We  study  also  the  effect  of  random 
elimination punctuation within time evolution of languages and cities Finally we assume 
decreasing  exponential  distribution  for  cities  over  size  with  independent  random  amplitude 
and random negative exponent and show that this gives the Pareto-Zipf law 
1   Introduction Our essential aim is to show that similar processes may be governing time 
evolution of competition between languages or cities yet with different parameters where the 
most crucial ones are two Rate for the growth within a multiplicative noise process 5 and a 
factor for fragmentation 6 It is similar to real life origination birth spread and extinction 
takes place in terms of fragmentation and growth is due to multiplicative noise process 
   Empirical criteria for our results are i Number of living languages and that of living cities 
towns villages etc may be different but total size for the present time must be the same 
for both cases where the mentioned size is world population ii World population increases 
exponentially  super  exponentially  for  recent  times  with  time3  7  iii  At  present  the 
biggest  language  Mandarin  Chinese  is  spoken  by  about  1025  billion  people  and  world 
population as the prediction made by United Nations is 65 billion in 2005 and to be about 
10 billion in 2050 7 so the ratio of the size for the biggest language to the total size ie 
world  population  must  be  about  165  iv  Size  distribution  for  the  present  time  must  be 
slightly  asymmetric  log-normal  for  languages  1  and  this  must  be  power  law  -1  for  the 
present cities Pareto-Zipf law4 It is known that many old languages and old cities are 
not living at present So we consider random elimination in both cases punctuation which 
might  have  occurred  due  to  some  historical  reasons  such  as  mass  immigration  being 
colonized lose of war and wide spread illness etc Secondly we aim at showing that Pareto-
Zipf law may be emerging from decreasing exponential distribution of number of cities over 
size where independent random numbers are used one for amplitude and one for negative 
exponent  Following  section  is  the  model  and  next  one  is  applications  and  results  Last 
section is devoted for discussion and conclusion We will display some more properties of the 
mentioned exponential functions within Appendix 
2   Model For languages or cities i we have various number of ancestors M0 all of 
which have random initial size Pi0 They grow in time t with a random rate RiR where 
R is universal within a random multiplicative noise process 
Pit  1  RiPit  1    
and if a random number is smaller than the splitting probability H then the language or city 
i splits with the splitting ratio fragmentation mutation factor S which has the following 
meaning If the current number of speakers of a language or population of a city i is Pit 
SPit  many  members  form  another  population  and  1SPit  many  survive  during  the 
fragmentation at t Number of languages or cities Mt increases by one if one language or 
city i splits if any two of them split at t then Mt increases by two etc Furthermore we 
assume that if for H1 this random number is larger than some G near 1 the language or the 
city becomes extinct It is obvious that results do not change if 1  S is substituted for S ie 
if the mutated and surviving members are interchanged So the greatest value for S is 05 
effectively Please note that fragmentation causes new agents to emerge birth and at the 
same time it drives them to extinction in terms of splitting and any language or city with a 
member less than unity is considered as extinct 
   Time evolution of total number of human speaking all of the current languages or living in 
all of the current cities ie world population is 
Wt   Mt
i1Pit     
where a city may actually also be a village of single house except if we demand a minimum 
population 
   It is obvious that if one changes M0 to M0 without changing origin and unit for time 
scale then Mt must be changed to Mt where Mt MtM0M0 Secondly if time 
steps of the evolution are long enough and the total number of time steps is small we may 
have more fragmentation per unit time If on the other hand time steps are considerably short 
for big number of total time steps intermittency may become crucial Moreover there may 
be various other reasons for waiting periods of time in fragmentation as well as in population 
growth We assumed an intermittency factor H for splitting which is taken same for all of 
languages or of cities Please note that H 1G gives gradual evolution where we have a 
regular fragmentation with H and with some S at each time step t This case is kept out of 
the present scope because we consider it as historically unrealistic Thirdly we know that 
not all of the ancestor and old languages or cities survive and we have many ancient and 
older languages which are not spoken any more and many of the old cities are archeological 
sites now The relevant number of people might have immigrated and changed the language 
and city they might have changed their language after being colonized within the same cities 
and they might have became totally extinct after a lost war or after a wide spread and severe 
illness etc We count such cases as random eliminations by the rate G at each t We keep the 
historical  reasons  out  of  the  present  scope  and  consider  only  the  results  and  once  the 
reasons are kept away the results of them may naturally be taken as random In summary if a 
random number which is defined for each t is smaller than H for H1 then the language or 
city splits by S and if the random number is larger than some G near 1 then the language 
or city becomes extinct and in between it grows for each time step by R at most Number 
of  languages  or  cities  increases  decreases  or  fluctuates  about  M0  for  relatively  big 
numbers for H high fragmentation and G low elimination for small numbers for H low 
fragmentation  and  G  high  elimination  and  for  HG1  equal  fragmentation  and 
elimination  respectively  out  of  which  we  regard  only  the  first  case  where  we  have  for 
1HG increase in the number of agents and we disregard the others Because it is known 
guessed that the number of cities languages did not decrease ever in past We try several 
number  of  ancestors  M0  with  sizes  Pi0  for  the  selected  case  where  we  assign  new 
random growth rates for new languages or cities which are not changed later as well as the 
growth rates for ancestors are kept as same through the time evolution 
   For  lifetime  we  simply  subtract  the  number  of  time  step  at  which  a  language  or  city  is 
generated  from  that  one  at  which  the  given  agent  became  extinct  where  the  agent  may 
become extinct since its size becomes less then unity in terms of fragmentation or since it is 
randomly eliminated In any case we have two different definitions for lifetime one is for the 
extinct agents and the other is for living agents age We may define t as the probability 
density function where t stands for the number of time steps and  stands for ages and  
counts the languages or cities with age  at t with 0 t It is obvious that the integral of  
over with 0 t gives the number of living not all but generated languages or cities at t 
which  is  equal  to  the  number  of  total  living  agents  Mt  minus  the  number  of  living 
ancestors which goes zero with tcid198 
   Please note that the introduced parameters have units involving time and our time unit is 
arbitrary After some period of evolution in time we reaching the present stop the simulation 
and calculate probability distribution function PDF for size and for some other functions 
such as extinction frequency lifetime etc for languages or cities  Number of interaction 
tours  may  be  chosen  as  arbitrary  without  following  historical  time  since  we  do  not  have 
historical  data  with  different  time  units  and  the  parameters  with  units  may  be  refined 
accordingly Yet in most cases relative values with respect to other cases population growth 
rate  in  different  runs  for  example  and  ratios  of  the  parameters  the  ratio  of  S  to  H  for 
example are important 
3   Applications and results Languages and cities are man made systems and language is 
not a physical quantity whereas city is a physical quantity Yet we find many similarities 
between  them  We  first  consider  languages  sect  31  later  we  study  cities  sect  32  in 
section 33 we compare the results for languages and cities and finally in section 34 we 
utilize exponential decreasing functions with two independent random numbers one for the 
amplitude and one for the negative exponent where our essential aim is to show that the 
mentioned sum gives Pareto-Zipf power law for size distribution 
31   Languages In our initial world at our t0 we have M0 100 many languages each 
of  which  is  spoken  by  randomly  chosen  Pi0  10000  people  thus  the  initial  world 
population  W0  is  about  500000  since  average  of  the  homogeneous  random  numbers 
between zero and unity is 05 Thus we assume power law zero for the initial distribution of 
languages over size ie MP  PP
   It is obvious that we may not set our time origin correctly because not a real data for the 
initial time is available to match with Yet we may assume a homogeneous distribution of 
size  over  initial  languages  In  fact  we  tried  many  smooth  Gauss  exponential  etc  initial 
distributions  not  shown  and  all  of  them  undergone  similar  time  evolutions  within  about 
3000 time steps under the present process of random multiplication for growth and random 
fragmentation  for  spread  and  origination  and  extinction  where  we  utilized  various 
combinations of the relevant parameters including H and G We tried also delta distribution 
which  is  equivalent  to  assuming  single  ancestor  for  the  initial  case  it  also  evolved  into  a 
slightly asymmetric log-normal one with different set of parameters certainly not shown in 
time In all of them we observe that the language distribution at present is independent of 
initial distributions disregarding some extra ordinary ones 
      Evolution  without  elimination  G1  Number  of  languages  Mt  and  population  of 
world  Wt  increases  exponentially  in  time  as  shown  in  Figure  1  where  the  arrow  for 
languages dashed line has the slope 0000095 and that for world population solid line has 
slope 0002530 where the parameters are R000752 and H00022 with S049999 others 
are same as before 
   Within the present section we utilize 3000 time steps as shown in Fig1 where we consider 
the present time the year 2000 as t1920 which is indicated by a two sided arrow in Fig1 
We show the portion for 1920 t3000 because we will make some comments predictions 
for languages about future and also for cities since there are close relations between them 
Please note that at t1920 present time the year 2000 we have 7168 languages and the 
world population is about 10 billion Fig 1 
   Figure 2 is the time evolution of size distribution of languages PDF all of which split and 
grow by the same parameters ie S R H all same as declared in the third paragraph of this 
0 for initial parameters M0 and P 0 
section and G1 thus we do not have abrupt punctuated elimination of languages here 
Lower plot is historical t270 open circles and upper one squares is for the present time 
t1920    In  Fig  2  we  observe  that  initial  languages  spread  in  number  by  fragmentation 
then  we  have  new  languages  which  split  from  the  previous  bigger  ones  right  New 
languages emerge also from the small ones left And all of them grow in size in terms of a 
random multiplicative noise process Growing rates are similar yet bigger ones grow if they 
do in bigger amounts at each time step We observe that small languages grew from few 
decades  to  more  yet  few  decades  with  a  time  period  of  1650  1920-270  time  steps 
whereas the biggest language grew within the same time period from few tens of thousands 
to a billion as we observe at right end of Fig 2 Chinese in reality In the meantime world 
population grew exponentially from about half million to about 10 billion and number of 
languages increased exponentially from about 197 to about 7168 We have parabolic fit 
dashed line in Fig 2 which indicates that the present distribution is slightly asymmetric log-
normal For the empirical distribution of the present languages see 1 and 2-3 
   We may summary our results in some of which we utilized several other combinations of 
the  declared  parameters  not  shown  as  1-  For  many  combinations  of  parameters  we  get 
asymmetric log-normal distributions for example for H0003 with R000752 and S01 
about  70000  languages  not  7000  may  outcome  not  shown  where  asymmetry  may  be 
slight or more depending upon the parameters On the other hand as M0 increases without 
changing other parameters top of the plot for MP rises up and as Pi0 increases width and 
the area ie world population Wt under the plot increases all for a given number of time 
steps Please note that M0 and W0 ie sum of Pi0 over i for 1iM0 is the amplitude 
of  the  asymptotically  exponential  function  Mt  and  Wt  respectively  not  shown  2- 
Increase in H lifts the left end and top of the plot for MP and widens it for a given Wt 
since we have more generated agents due to high fragmentation per time step 3- Increase in 
R  extends  the  plot  for  MP  along  two  directions  ie  it  widens  the  plot  at  left  small 
languages  and  at  right  big  languages  end  since  we  have  more  rapid  growth  in  every 
language where mutated split abundance also increases In short we obtain various plots 
which are more or less or almost same as the empirical data for the present languages with 
different parameters Our relevant comment is that language distribution at present time may 
not be unique and similar ones may be obtained with various combinations of parameters for 
initial conditions and these for evolution where range of each parameter used is considerably 
wide We will revisit this issue in section 33 4- One important observation that we make 
within  our  results  is  for  1920t  ie  for  future  For  a  given  asymmetric  log-normal  size 
distribution of languages for the present time as t increases asymmetry increases where we 
keep all of the given the parameters as same and increase t Small languages end rises up 
with  decrease  in  local  slope  with  time  in  the  meantime  local  slope  for  big  languages  end 
becomes more and more steep In short small languages end becomes the top of the plot for 
MP and big languages end turns to be power law with exponent about negative unity see 
Figure 2 the plot in open squares where the slope for plot in solid squares at tail is 07 
Thus  we  have  power  law  with  exponent  zero  at  the  beginning  we  have  power  law  with 
exponent about negative unity for future and intermediately ie at the present time we have 
log-normal for size distribution We will revisit the current issue in further paragraphs of this 
section and in sections 32-34 and 4 
   Time distribution of languages is another important issue besides the size distribution We 
consider here lifetime for the extinct languages and ages of the present ones Figure 3 is the 
lifetimes of languages at present t1920 thick solid past t1920 thin solid and in future 
1920t  dashed  Parameters  are  same  as  before  Here  we  observe  that  many  ancestors 
survive in all t only two ancestor languages are found as mutated or having become extinct 
before t1920 Secondly generated languages are distributed exponentially decreasing with 
age in both cases Inset is the number of speakers for each of the living language at present 
time which evolved out of the initial ones with random size The biggest present language 
Chinese is spoken by little more than one billion 1G in the inset human 
   We obtained many similar results for the same parameters yet for different number of time 
steps where we observed that the negative exponent remained same in results Secondly 
we tried the same number of time steps as the one utilized within the previous case and we 
change other parameters Considering these new parameters which give similar PDF for the 
present  empirical  distribution  of  languages  over  size  we  observed  similar  exponential 
behavior  for  distribution  of  emerged  languages  over  age  where  the  negative  exponents 
depend  on  the  parameters  Consecutively  we  may  state  that  generated  languages  are 
distributed  decreasing  exponentially  independent  of  the  parameters  used  with  age  and 
negative exponents depend on the parameters It is obvious that increasing H directly and 
increasing R indirectly since any size hardly becomes less than unity for big R promotes 
many new languages to emerge As a result linear portions of the plots left end in Fig 4 
which has logarithmic vertical axis for the number becomes steeper which means that the 
exponents  increase  in  absolute  value  There  we  may  consider  the  situation  as  scaling  the 
horizontal time axis where increasing H and R amounts to increasing the unit for a time 
step and decreasing the number of time steps from the initial time t0 up to the present and 
vice versa 
   Elimination G1 plays a role which is opposite to that of fragmentation H and growth 
R in evolution where H and R develop the evolution forward and G recedes So the present 
competition turns out to be one between H and R and G Number of languages are essentially 
determined by H and G where two criteria are crucial For a given number of time steps R 
and M0 etc there is a critical value for G where for GcriticalG 1 languages survive and 
for smaller values of G ie if GGcritical languages may become extinct totally Secondly 
sum of H and G is a decisive parameter for the evolution If for a given G with GcriticalG 
HG1 then the number of languages does not increase and does not decrease but oscillates 
about M0 since almost same amount of languages emerges by H and becomes extinct 
by G at each time step and we have intermediate elimination On the other hand if HG1 
then languages decrease in number with time and we have high strong heavy elimination 
Only for 1HG with G1 we have low weak light elimination of languages where the 
number increases yet slowly with respect to the case for G1 It is obvious that elimination 
slows down the evolution It amounts to decreasing the unit for a time step and increasing the 
number of time steps from the initial time t0 up to the present and vice versa So we need 
more time to arrive at a given configuration of languages ie total number size total size 
PDF etc 
   Now we introduce G09996 with H00022 as before where 1HG and we have light 
elimination We have the parameters same as before for M0 100 number of ancestors 
and  Pi0  10000  number  of  initial  speakers  which  grows  with  the  rate  R000752  as 
before Eq 1 At the end of 1920 time steps we have W about 13 billion and M about 3030 
Eq  2  where  it  may  be  observed  that  light  elimination  is  effective  on  the  number  of 
languages rather than on world population World population Wt and number of languages 
Mt increases exponentially disregarding the abrupt and temporary recessions not shown 
with exponents 000235 and 78x10-4 respectively Figure 4 is the resulting size and the inset 
is time distribution of languages at t1920 solid squares for size where PDF is smaller in 
height with respect to the one solid squares in Fig 2 If we increase H to 00028 keeping 
other parameters same as before we observe a different picture not shown where small 
size end of the PDF plot is higher since fragmentation is higher yet we do not have small 
languages spoken by few people Many small languages are now spoken by some hundred or 
thousand human at minimum Languages move towards right on the plot PDF for size as 
their speakers increase in number and they move towards left as they fragment and become 
extinct at the left end when they are spoken by no human 
   Log-normal  plot  in  open  squares  for  t3000  future  in  Fig  4  is  clearly  asymmetric  It 
involves a long tail for big sizes and a short arm for small sizes top of the plot is for about 
100000 speakers etc Please note that the plot with open squares in Fig 2 is for G1 and for 
t3000 for future and the only different parameter here with respect to the corresponding 
plot in Fig 2 is G Initial conditions are similar not same because we have random Pi0 in 
both cases but evolution parameters are different yet the plots are similar in many aspects 
First of all in both cases we have higher left arm for small languages with respect to the 
plots  for  the  present  time  which  implies  that  present  small  languages  will  decay  in  time 
where punctuation increases the rate for decay Secondly we have decreasing exponential 
time  distribution  in  both  cases  and  punctuation  G1  decreases  the  exponent  in  absolute 
value As a result of punctuation we may expect more people speaking a given language in 
future due to some mechanisms else than fragmentation for example change of languages 
in terms of physical or cultural colonization etc since top of the plot for future in Fig 4 is 
lower  than  top  of  the  corresponding  plot  in  Fig  2  On  the  other  hand  as  we  mentioned 
previously two paragraphs before that presence of G1 amounts to increasing the unit for 
time steps So the plot in solid squares in Fig 4 may be viewed as one for future with smaller 
parameters  for  H  and  R  More  clearly  if  one  utilizes  bigger  parameters  for  H  R  he  may 
obtain the target configuration for languages for smaller t if G1  And since G1 eliminates 
Mt randomly we need bigger parameters for H and R to mimic the size distribution world 
population size of the biggest language and other empirical data As a result size distribution 
comes out with long tail for big size and with short arm for small size Moreover sizes for 
small languages increase ie we do not have languages spoken by few human any more 
   As time evolves top of the PDF for size moves towards left due to fragmentation H and 
tail becomes more and more crowded due to increase in population R As a result we have 
two configurations For some H and R we have local horizontal behavior for small size 
saturation and we have a decline for big size which becomes roughly straight in many of 
our runs not shown Secondly for bigger H without changing R top of the plot rises at 
small  language  end  and  we  have  roughly  straight  distribution  for  many  big  languages  in 
log-log axes which means that we have power law see paragraph 6 of sect 31 
   We  had  already  considered  age  distribution  of  the  generated  languages  as  decreasing 
exponentials in time for G1 where age distribution for ancestor languages is delta function 
ie  same  1920  for  all  of  the  ancestors  And  now  we  have  similar  exponential  time 
distribution for G1 yet with smaller exponent in absolute value not shown Secondly for 
G1 number of living ancestors decreases in time with high fragmentation not shown and 
with the same H for fragmentation as before not shown where we have only 32 ancestor 
languages present at t1920 for G1 with H00022 
   Please note that ancestor languages may fragment at any time t1920 and they may give 
birth to new languages where size may vary in time for ancestor and generated languages 
We count these languages as ancestor if their lifetime is 1920 for 1920 time steps Figure 5 
is the time distribution for lifetime of the languages which became extinct and the inset is 
the relative frequency of events for extinction all with G1 where other parameters are same 
as before 
   We  observe  that  the  distribution  for  lifetime  for  extinct  languages  are  also  decreasing 
exponential  with  exponent  0001  as  given  by  an  exponential  fit  not  shown  As  a  result 
more languages become extinct in their youth and less ones become extinct as they become 
old  In  other  words  languages  become  extinct  either  with  short  lifetime  soon  after  their 
generation or they hardly become extinct later and live long which may be considered as a 
kind of natural selection It may be noted that long living languages have many speakers 
and they hardly become extinct in terms of splitting 
   Certainly  we  do  not  have  any  empirical  record  for  time  distribution  of  languages  to 
compare our results Yet the number of time steps we utilized 1920 may correspond to 
roughly  last  20000  years  of  history  with  the  initial  conditions  M0  100  and  W0 
500000 So our time unit may correspond to about a decade in year and 10 to 100 time 
steps ie century to millennium for a given ancient language to become extinct may be 
considered as reasonable We count the number of extinct languages in Fig 5 as 618 about 
10 of the living ones which may also be considered as reasonable 
   Inset in Fig 5 shows the ratio of languages which became extinct to the ones living at any t 
0t1920 where we observe cascades within extinctions which decay in time And as time 
evolves  cascades  disappear  and  we  have  a  constant  noise  for  which  we  have  the  present 
slightly asymmetric log-normal size distribution MP 
   As the final remark of this section we note that the number of time steps which we used 
within the runs are 3000 2430 1920 and 270 and they go in squares ie with 30m2 where 
m10 9 8 and 3 respectively It is because we observed that size distribution develops in 
roughly equal amounts in log-log plot if we increase our maximum number of time steps in 
squares For example consider Fig 3 when we plot PDF for t480 m4 750 m5 1080 
m6  and  1470  m7  they  fill  in  space  between  the  plot  for  t270  and  t1920  almost 
uniformly And if we continue for m9 and 10 the mentioned uniformity survives We think 
that  evolution  of  language  distribution  for  size  may  be  running  in  steps  which  are 
proportional  to  square  of  time  periods  Also  see  Figure  7  where  number  of  ancestors 
decreases roughly uniformly with square of time 
32      Cities  We  claim  that  initial  world  is  not  much  relevant  for  the  present  size 
configuration of cities Moreover we may obtain similar configurations for various evolution 
parameters In Figure 6 we display three PDF for size distributions with different initial and 
evolution parameters where the maximum population for ancestors P10000 and splitting 
factor  S01  is  same  with  G1  for  all  Please  note  that  S  is  not  the  maximum  value 
which  is  05  effectively  since  we  think  that  any  number  of  human  may  change  their 
language  yet  a  city  may  split  only  in  small  portions  On  the  other  hand  it  is  known  that 
minimum size for a language is unity but it is not defined for a city A city may actually also 
be a village of single house except if we demand a minimum population For that reason we 
considered several minimum populations for a city In Figure 6 slopes for linear fits dashed 
lines are about 1 -1 squares 2 -1 circles and 3 -085 stars And  utilized parameters 
are  1  squares  M0100  R0005  H  001  number  of  time  steps2430  and  minimum 
population  for  a  city  626  2  circles  M0100  R00062  H  002  number  of  time 
steps3000  and  minimum  population  for  a  city740  and  3  stars M010  R0005  H 
0015  number  of  time  steps1470  and  minimum  population  for  a  city  1  We  observed 
many other power laws about minus unity for several other combinations of parameters 
not  shown  where  we  observe  also  that  a  very  wide  range  of  parameters  give  the  same 
Pareto-Zipf  law  And  we  obtain  decreasing  exponential  time  distributions  for  lifetime  of 
extinct cities and ages of the livings ones for big M0 and for M0 less than or equal to 
about 10 the mentioned decreasing exponential distributions for lifetime changes in form 
Please see Figs 3 and 4 for similar distributions for languages and note that exponents are 
same for different t which may be utilized to predict the terminal number for cities and that 
for languages under some assumptions as we will mention in section 33 
   At  present  it  is  obvious  that  Wt  and  Mt  increases  exponentially  due  to  R  and  H 
respectively  since  G1  For  GcriticalG1  increase  in  Mt  lessens  and  for  GcriticalG  and 
GH1 we have oscillations in Mt about M0 which is not a realistic case as the one for 
GcriticalG1 where we have few cities at the end and we do not consider them here 
33   Languages and cities It is worth to emphasize that languages and cities are no longer 
the  same  and  that  for  some  intermediate  times  the  cities  obey  the  1size  law  while  the 
languages obey the log-normal distribution for the same or better similar set of parameters 
   As  we  mentioned  in  the  previous  section  time  distribution  of  cities  lifetime  for  extinct 
cities  and  ages  of  the  livings  ones  are  decreasing  exponentials  disregarding  the  cases  for 
small number of ancestors as shown in Figure 7 Simple probability density functions are 
also exponential not shown which means that cities occupy time distribution plots Figs 3 
4 and 7 in exponential order more cities for small t and less cities for big t for a given 
number of time steps in all Inset of Fig 7 is simple probability density function of living 
cities at t1920 which is decreasing exponential with the rate exponent of 000185 per time 
step where the number of living ancestor cities is 37 at present as shown by a solid square 
which  is  far  from  the  curve  and  they  M0  say  about  1000  in  number  at  most  can  be 
neglected within some hundred thousand cities at present if ancestors have small sizes On 
the other hand we know that size distribution for languages is not power law for the present 
time Yet they display decreasing exponential time distributions lifetime of extinct languages 
and ages of the livings ones disregarding the cases for small number of ancestors similar to 
the ones for cities For random elimination case punctuation for languages with G09988 
H00022  ie  light  elimination  for  R  00082  simple  probability  density  function  not 
shown  similar  to  the  one  in  the  inset  of  Fig  7  is  decreasing  exponential  with  exponent 
about 00017 where the number for the youngest languages ie these emerged within the 
last 192 time steps since we divide horizontal time axis into equal 100 parts to calculate 
probability is 2430 for 1920 time steps where decrease in the number of living ancestors in 
time from hundred to about ten is observable 
   Now we may represent the probability density function by t where t stands for the 
number of time steps and  stands for ages of the languages at t and  counts the languages 
with age  at t with 0 t It is obvious that the integral of  over with 0 t gives the 
number of living not all but generated languages at t which is equal to the number of total 
living  languages  Mt  minus  the  number  of  living  ancestors  and  the  number  of  living 
ancestors goes zero with tcid198 
   In Fig 7 and in many others not shown we observe that exponent  say of t is 
independent of t for languages and cities Assuming that the exponent 000185 for cities 
will remain as constant for tcid198 we may predict Mtcid198 A simple integration of t 
1texp- over   with 0 t can be performed for Mt since living ancestors decay 
in terms of fragmentation and random elimination with time Mt1texp-t The 
crucial parameter for the result is 1t ie number of newly generated languages or newly 
established cities at 1 for each t It is obvious that 1t can not be constant or a decreasing 
function with t Because we have elimination with G1 and number of eliminated languages 
or  cities  increases  with  t  languages  change  and  some  of  them  become  useless  and  cities 
become old and ruined in time 1t may be an increasing function in time due to non zero 
fragmentation H If 1t increases linearly with time we get saturation in Mtcid198 which 
is  not  contradiction  since  we  have  elimination  If 1t  increases  exponentially  with  the 
exponent   we  have  saturation  in  Mtcid198  for     and  we  have  Mtcid1980  for    
Since we know that at present Mt increases with time we may guess that   ie we 
invent  new  languages  and  establish  new  cities  which  increase  either  linearly  or 
exponentially with the exponent bigger than 00017 for languages and bigger than 000185 
for  cities  in  time  One  may  guess  that  Mtcid198  will  saturate  in  reality  since  human 
population for languages and surface area of earth for languages is limited 
   On the other hand it is known that cities were states in past yet it is not certain whether 
one language was spoken per city state or vice versa For the present we have about 7000 
languages at present for a world population which is little less than 10 billion as mentioned 
within  the  first  paragraph  of  sect  31  For  the  size  distribution  designated  by  number  1 
squares in Fig 6 we have about 110 thousand cities with a world population which is about 
5  billion  not  shown  So  one  may  say  that  a  language  is  spoken  within  15  city  on  the 
average at present Yet it is not meaningful because of several reasons one of which is that 
we counted these as city which have 626 citizens at minimum And we do not know totally 
how many human are living in towns and villages etc But it is obvious that we have much 
more cities than the languages in the present world We have many metropolitan cities in the 
present  world  where  only  one  language  is  spoken  by  big  majorities  And  we  have  many 
cities per country where the number of languages is smaller than the number of cities etc It 
is  certain  that  ratio  of  the  number  of  total  languages  to  that  of  cities  is  less  than  unity  at 
present 
   Thus far we considered within various paragraphs that languages and cities as products of 
the same humans are very similar to each other in many respects Yet languages and cities 
are no longer the same and for some intermediate times the cities obey the 1size law while 
the  languages  obey  the  log-normal  distribution  for  the  same  or  better  similar  set  of 
parameters We predict that log-normal size distribution may turn into power law with the 
same parameters if only the number of time steps is increased ie in future Moreover 
languages  and  cities  have  decreasing  exponential  time  distributions  lifetime  for  extinct 
cities and age for the livings ones 
   In the next section we will consider power law distribution for cities over size where we 
will utilize big number sum of decreasing exponential functions with independent random 
numbers for amplitude and exponent and show that the sum gives power law -1 
34      Sum  of  exponential  functions  with  random  and  independent  amplitude  and  exponent 
Lets consider exponential functions zjkx where the amplitude and exponent are random 
and independent for a real or complex number b 
In Eq 3 x is any independent variable Aj is one random number Amin Aj  Amax and BBk is 
another random number BminB  BBk  Bmax which are independent of each other In other words 
we  select  A  and  B  from  different  sets  of  random  numbers  between  which  there  is  no 
connection It is obvious that real b may be taken as a scaling factor for x or for BkB  ie one 
may select b1 for a unit of x-axis and one may select b1 for a scaled unit of x-axis with 
xcid198bx And similarly one may select b1 for some BBmin and Bmax and one may select b1 for 
B cid198bBmin and BBmaxcid198bBmax Now we take b in Eq 3 as negative for positive BkB  bcid198-b 
thus we will have negative exponents 
   Within a system we may have several physical quantities which vary in proportion to zjkx 
or  to  derivatives  and  integrals  of  zjkx  Lets  consider  one  such  function  yjkx  which  is 
proportional to zjkx ie yjkx zjkx where the constant for proportion is taken as unity for 
simplicity We define 
jkx  AjexpBBkbx     
Yxj
K yjkxJK    
with some big yet finite J and K where the order of sum is not important due to independence 
of the random numbers and random numbers are generated homogeneously  
   Inset  of  Figure  8  is  for  yjkx  Eq  3  with  b01  and  Amin  Bmin  00  Amax    Bmax10 
which  may  be  considered  as  size  distribution  for  languages  or  cities  along  x-axis  where  x 
counts the agents ie we place an agent i1 at x1 if it is generated right after an agent i 
which is placed at x Please note the present ancestors for small x For the sum in Eq 4 one 
may select the random numbers same for all x and one may select new different random 
numbers at each x where all of the random numbers are completely independent Ai is one 
random number AminAiAmax and BBi is another random number Bmin
 in all Figure 
8 displays Yx Eq 4 with JK1000 for Amin Bmin 00 Amax 10 Bmax10 where we 
have no fluctuation in Y for the random numbers selected same for each x dashed thick line 
and fluctuation in Y increases in magnitude as x increases fluctuating plot for the random 
numbers re-selected for each x And in both cases we have power law as the arrow with 
slope -1 indicates in log-log axes 
   Obviously the important issue in Fig 8 is that Yx is a power function for large x with the 
power of minus unity ie 
B BBjBmax
Yxj
K yjkxJK  x-1    
which is similar to Pareto-Zipf law if x stands for city population We may state that if the 
probability of finding a city with population about x say  xdx decreases exponentially with 
independent random amplitude and exponent then the sum of mentioned probabilities gives 
the famous power law In other words reason for the mentioned power law is the randomness 
in  amplitude  and  negative  exponent  of  the  probability  of  finding  a  city  with  population 
about x say  xdx Clearly Eq 5 is valid for every situation competition between cities 
that between languages and similarly between speciation and extinction etc if it satisfies 
the  given  conditions  ie  random  and  positive  amplitudes  independently  random  and 
negative exponents 
   For  homogeneously  yet  independent  distributions  for  the  random  numbers  Aj  for  the 
amplitudes and BBk for the exponents with Amin Aj  Amax and Bmin
B  BBk  Bmax one may 
utilize the general theorem of central limit with large N or just convert the double sum into a 
double integral over A Ajcid198A and B BkB cid198B which vary linearly since the random numbers 
are homogeneously distributed between the extrema to obtain the following equalities 
Yxj
        A2

minexpBBmaxbx  expBmin
bx2bx    
and for BBmin 0 we have  
Yx   A2
max  A2
minexpBBmaxbx  12bx     7 
which may be further simplified for 12bx 
Yx  A2
max  A2
min 2b x 
1    
since the exponential term approaches to zero as x increases And the result is power law 
with power minus one Eq 5 It is obvious that BBmax may always be taken as unity and b 
may be varied accordingly We may state that our analysis Eqs 5-8 is general for any set 
of independent random numbers for amplitudes provided Amax and Amin is finite and that for 
exponents provided BminB  0 where BBmax 1 may be taken after changing b accordingly For 
some other applications of the present issue in biology for example see 8 
  As  we  mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  this  section  that  b  in  Eqs  3-8  may  be  real  or 
complex  It  is  obvious  that  for  a  complex  specifically  purely  imaginary  b  Yx  may  be 
expressed in terms of sinus and cosinus functions so we get oscillatory behavior in Mt Eq 
2  for  GH1  for  example  and  similarly  in  time  series  for  price  in  economy  etc 
Furthermore yjkx in Eq 4 may be proportional to first second etc derivative of zjkx in 
Eq 3 or to integral of it where we have more interesting cases since then we have more 
than two random numbers in yjkx We consider these cases within Appendix 
Appendix 
Power  law  for  harmonic  oscillation      For  complex  b  ie  bcid198ib  yjkx    AjexpBBkbx 
which  may  be  re-written  as  a  linear  combination  of  sine  and  cosine  yjkx    AjsinBkB bx   
AjcosBBkbx  Then we have 
Yxj
K AjsinBBkbx  AjcosBkB bxJK 
which is similar to Eq 9 in 9 It is obvious that not Yx in Eq 9 but its envelope has 
power law -1 as the following equation implies 
Yx  A2
max  A2
minsinBBmaxbx  cosBmin
bx2bx     
Power law with higher power   Now lets suppose that yjkx is proportional to dzjkxdx 
then we have three at a first glance it may be seen as two random numbers two of which 
are independent in yjkx  bAjBBkexpBkB bx after taking the proportionality constant as unity 
One may show after a similar analysis Eqs 3-8 that Yx  x2 Similarly if yjkx is 
proportional to d2zjkxdx2 then we have Yx  x3 etc For similar distribution functions 
for price in economy where x stands for the relative price change more precisely for the 
change in the logarithm of the price one may see 10 and relevant references therein  
4   Discussion and conclusion Starting with random initial conditions and utilizing many 
random  parameters  for  evolution  we  obtained  many  regularities  for  size  and  time 
distributions etc under the process of random multiplicative noise for growth and random 
fragmentation  for  generation  and  extinction  of  languages  or  cities  with  no  further  random 
elimination  G1  We  find  that  results  are  independent  of  initial  conditions  disregarding 
some  extra  ordinary  ones  If  we  have  G1  we  need  longer  time  to  mimic  a  target 
configuration  where  new  generated  languages  or  cities  may  be  inserted  in  terms  of 
fragmentation  provided  GcriticalG  and  1GH  Furthermore  many  languages  or  cities 
become  extinct  in  their  youth  and  less  ones  become  extinct  as  they  become  old  In  other 
words  languages  or  cities  become  extinct  either  with  short  lifetime  soon  after  their 
generation or they hardly become extinct later and live long which may be considered as a 
kind of natural selection 
   It is known that logistic maps Eq 1 are dynamic and under some circumstances they 
may become chaotic We predict that time distribution for languages or cities are decreasing 
exponential and log-normal size distribution for languages at present may turn into power law 
in future Power law -1 for size distribution of present cities may be result of decreasing 
exponential distribution of their probability over size It is worth to mention that finite sum of 
decreasing  exponential  functions  with  two  independent  random  numbers  one  for  the 
exponent and one for the amplitude may be useful to express many relevant phenomena as 
well in biology and economy 
   In  summary  languages  and  cities  are  not  the  same  and  for  some  intermediate  times  the 
cities obey the 1size law while the languages obey the log-normal distribution where the 
decisive parameters are fragmentation rate H and splitting factor S We have smaller H 
and bigger S for languages with respect to these for cities for the same population growth 
rate R which governs the world population which is the same for languages and cities and 
for the same set of other parameters

   Abstract  Present  human  languages  display  slightly  asymmetric  log-normal  Gauss 
distribution for size 1-3 whereas present cities follow power law Pareto-Zipf law4 Our 
model  considers  the  competition  between  languages  and  that  between  cities  in  terms  of 
growing multiplicative noise process5 and fragmentation 6 where relevant parameters 
are naturally different for languages and cities We consider lifetime distribution for old and 
living  languages  and  that  for  old  and  living  cities  We  study  also  the  effect  of  random 
elimination punctuation within time evolution of languages and cities Finally we assume 
decreasing  exponential  distribution  for  cities  over  size  with  independent  random  amplitude 
and random negative exponent and show that this gives the Pareto-Zipf law 
1   Introduction Our essential aim is to show that similar processes may be governing time 
evolution of competition between languages or cities yet with different parameters where the 
most crucial ones are two Rate for the growth within a multiplicative noise process 5 and a 
factor for fragmentation 6 It is similar to real life origination birth spread and extinction 
takes place in terms of fragmentation and growth is due to multiplicative noise process 
   Empirical criteria for our results are i Number of living languages and that of living cities 
towns villages etc may be different but total size for the present time must be the same 
for both cases where the mentioned size is world population ii World population increases 
exponentially  super  exponentially  for  recent  times  with  time3  7  iii  At  present  the 
biggest  language  Mandarin  Chinese  is  spoken  by  about  1025  billion  people  and  world 
population as the prediction made by United Nations is 65 billion in 2005 and to be about 
10 billion in 2050 7 so the ratio of the size for the biggest language to the total size ie 
world  population  must  be  about  165  iv  Size  distribution  for  the  present  time  must  be 
slightly  asymmetric  log-normal  for  languages  1  and  this  must  be  power  law  -1  for  the 
present cities Pareto-Zipf law4 It is known that many old languages and old cities are 
not living at present So we consider random elimination in both cases punctuation which 
might  have  occurred  due  to  some  historical  reasons  such  as  mass  immigration  being 
colonized lose of war and wide spread illness etc Secondly we aim at showing that Pareto-
Zipf law may be emerging from decreasing exponential distribution of number of cities over 
size where independent random numbers are used one for amplitude and one for negative 
exponent  Following  section  is  the  model  and  next  one  is  applications  and  results  Last 
section is devoted for discussion and conclusion We will display some more properties of the 
mentioned exponential functions within Appendix 
2   Model For languages or cities i we have various number of ancestors M0 all of 
which have random initial size Pi0 They grow in time t with a random rate RiR where 
R is universal within a random multiplicative noise process 
Pit  1  RiPit  1    
and if a random number is smaller than the splitting probability H then the language or city 
i splits with the splitting ratio fragmentation mutation factor S which has the following 
meaning If the current number of speakers of a language or population of a city i is Pit 
SPit  many  members  form  another  population  and  1SPit  many  survive  during  the 
fragmentation at t Number of languages or cities Mt increases by one if one language or 
city i splits if any two of them split at t then Mt increases by two etc Furthermore we 
assume that if for H1 this random number is larger than some G near 1 the language or the 
city becomes extinct It is obvious that results do not change if 1  S is substituted for S ie 
if the mutated and surviving members are interchanged So the greatest value for S is 05 
effectively Please note that fragmentation causes new agents to emerge birth and at the 
same time it drives them to extinction in terms of splitting and any language or city with a 
member less than unity is considered as extinct 
   Time evolution of total number of human speaking all of the current languages or living in 
all of the current cities ie world population is 
Wt   Mt
i1Pit     
where a city may actually also be a village of single house except if we demand a minimum 
population 
   It is obvious that if one changes M0 to M0 without changing origin and unit for time 
scale then Mt must be changed to Mt where Mt MtM0M0 Secondly if time 
steps of the evolution are long enough and the total number of time steps is small we may 
have more fragmentation per unit time If on the other hand time steps are considerably short 
for big number of total time steps intermittency may become crucial Moreover there may 
be various other reasons for waiting periods of time in fragmentation as well as in population 
growth We assumed an intermittency factor H for splitting which is taken same for all of 
languages or of cities Please note that H 1G gives gradual evolution where we have a 
regular fragmentation with H and with some S at each time step t This case is kept out of 
the present scope because we consider it as historically unrealistic Thirdly we know that 
not all of the ancestor and old languages or cities survive and we have many ancient and 
older languages which are not spoken any more and many of the old cities are archeological 
sites now The relevant number of people might have immigrated and changed the language 
and city they might have changed their language after being colonized within the same cities 
and they might have became totally extinct after a lost war or after a wide spread and severe 
illness etc We count such cases as random eliminations by the rate G at each t We keep the 
historical  reasons  out  of  the  present  scope  and  consider  only  the  results  and  once  the 
reasons are kept away the results of them may naturally be taken as random In summary if a 
random number which is defined for each t is smaller than H for H1 then the language or 
city splits by S and if the random number is larger than some G near 1 then the language 
or city becomes extinct and in between it grows for each time step by R at most Number 
of  languages  or  cities  increases  decreases  or  fluctuates  about  M0  for  relatively  big 
numbers for H high fragmentation and G low elimination for small numbers for H low 
fragmentation  and  G  high  elimination  and  for  HG1  equal  fragmentation  and 
elimination  respectively  out  of  which  we  regard  only  the  first  case  where  we  have  for 
1HG increase in the number of agents and we disregard the others Because it is known 
guessed that the number of cities languages did not decrease ever in past We try several 
number  of  ancestors  M0  with  sizes  Pi0  for  the  selected  case  where  we  assign  new 
random growth rates for new languages or cities which are not changed later as well as the 
growth rates for ancestors are kept as same through the time evolution 
   For  lifetime  we  simply  subtract  the  number  of  time  step  at  which  a  language  or  city  is 
generated  from  that  one  at  which  the  given  agent  became  extinct  where  the  agent  may 
become extinct since its size becomes less then unity in terms of fragmentation or since it is 
randomly eliminated In any case we have two different definitions for lifetime one is for the 
extinct agents and the other is for living agents age We may define t as the probability 
density function where t stands for the number of time steps and  stands for ages and  
counts the languages or cities with age  at t with 0 t It is obvious that the integral of  
over with 0 t gives the number of living not all but generated languages or cities at t 
which  is  equal  to  the  number  of  total  living  agents  Mt  minus  the  number  of  living 
ancestors which goes zero with tcid198 
   Please note that the introduced parameters have units involving time and our time unit is 
arbitrary After some period of evolution in time we reaching the present stop the simulation 
and calculate probability distribution function PDF for size and for some other functions 
such as extinction frequency lifetime etc for languages or cities  Number of interaction 
tours  may  be  chosen  as  arbitrary  without  following  historical  time  since  we  do  not  have 
historical  data  with  different  time  units  and  the  parameters  with  units  may  be  refined 
accordingly Yet in most cases relative values with respect to other cases population growth 
rate  in  different  runs  for  example  and  ratios  of  the  parameters  the  ratio  of  S  to  H  for 
example are important 
3   Applications and results Languages and cities are man made systems and language is 
not a physical quantity whereas city is a physical quantity Yet we find many similarities 
between  them  We  first  consider  languages  sect  31  later  we  study  cities  sect  32  in 
section 33 we compare the results for languages and cities and finally in section 34 we 
utilize exponential decreasing functions with two independent random numbers one for the 
amplitude and one for the negative exponent where our essential aim is to show that the 
mentioned sum gives Pareto-Zipf power law for size distribution 
31   Languages In our initial world at our t0 we have M0 100 many languages each 
of  which  is  spoken  by  randomly  chosen  Pi0  10000  people  thus  the  initial  world 
population  W0  is  about  500000  since  average  of  the  homogeneous  random  numbers 
between zero and unity is 05 Thus we assume power law zero for the initial distribution of 
languages over size ie MP  PP
   It is obvious that we may not set our time origin correctly because not a real data for the 
initial time is available to match with Yet we may assume a homogeneous distribution of 
size  over  initial  languages  In  fact  we  tried  many  smooth  Gauss  exponential  etc  initial 
distributions  not  shown  and  all  of  them  undergone  similar  time  evolutions  within  about 
3000 time steps under the present process of random multiplication for growth and random 
fragmentation  for  spread  and  origination  and  extinction  where  we  utilized  various 
combinations of the relevant parameters including H and G We tried also delta distribution 
which  is  equivalent  to  assuming  single  ancestor  for  the  initial  case  it  also  evolved  into  a 
slightly asymmetric log-normal one with different set of parameters certainly not shown in 
time In all of them we observe that the language distribution at present is independent of 
initial distributions disregarding some extra ordinary ones

world  Wt  increases  exponentially  in  time  as  shown  in  Figure  1  where  the  arrow  for 
languages dashed line has the slope 0000095 and that for world population solid line has 
slope 0002530 where the parameters are R000752 and H00022 with S049999 others 
are same as before 
   Within the present section we utilize 3000 time steps as shown in Fig1 where we consider 
the present time the year 2000 as t1920 which is indicated by a two sided arrow in Fig1 
We show the portion for 1920 t3000 because we will make some comments predictions 
for languages about future and also for cities since there are close relations between them 
Please note that at t1920 present time the year 2000 we have 7168 languages and the 
world population is about 10 billion Fig 1 
   Figure 2 is the time evolution of size distribution of languages PDF all of which split and 
grow by the same parameters ie S R H all same as declared in the third paragraph of this 
0 for initial parameters M0 and P 0 
section and G1 thus we do not have abrupt punctuated elimination of languages here 
Lower plot is historical t270 open circles and upper one squares is for the present time 
t1920    In  Fig  2  we  observe  that  initial  languages  spread  in  number  by  fragmentation 
then  we  have  new  languages  which  split  from  the  previous  bigger  ones  right  New 
languages emerge also from the small ones left And all of them grow in size in terms of a 
random multiplicative noise process Growing rates are similar yet bigger ones grow if they 
do in bigger amounts at each time step We observe that small languages grew from few 
decades  to  more  yet  few  decades  with  a  time  period  of  1650  1920-270  time  steps 
whereas the biggest language grew within the same time period from few tens of thousands 
to a billion as we observe at right end of Fig 2 Chinese in reality In the meantime world 
population grew exponentially from about half million to about 10 billion and number of 
languages increased exponentially from about 197 to about 7168 We have parabolic fit 
dashed line in Fig 2 which indicates that the present distribution is slightly asymmetric log-
normal For the empirical distribution of the present languages see 1 and 2-3 
   We may summary our results in some of which we utilized several other combinations of 
the  declared  parameters  not  shown  as  1-  For  many  combinations  of  parameters  we  get 
asymmetric log-normal distributions for example for H0003 with R000752 and S01 
about  70000  languages  not  7000  may  outcome  not  shown  where  asymmetry  may  be 
slight or more depending upon the parameters On the other hand as M0 increases without 
changing other parameters top of the plot for MP rises up and as Pi0 increases width and 
the area ie world population Wt under the plot increases all for a given number of time 
steps Please note that M0 and W0 ie sum of Pi0 over i for 1iM0 is the amplitude 
of  the  asymptotically  exponential  function  Mt  and  Wt  respectively  not  shown  2- 
Increase in H lifts the left end and top of the plot for MP and widens it for a given Wt 
since we have more generated agents due to high fragmentation per time step 3- Increase in 
R  extends  the  plot  for  MP  along  two  directions  ie  it  widens  the  plot  at  left  small 
languages  and  at  right  big  languages  end  since  we  have  more  rapid  growth  in  every 
language where mutated split abundance also increases In short we obtain various plots 
which are more or less or almost same as the empirical data for the present languages with 
different parameters Our relevant comment is that language distribution at present time may 
not be unique and similar ones may be obtained with various combinations of parameters for 
initial conditions and these for evolution where range of each parameter used is considerably 
wide We will revisit this issue in section 33 4- One important observation that we make 
within  our  results  is  for  1920t  ie  for  future  For  a  given  asymmetric  log-normal  size 
distribution of languages for the present time as t increases asymmetry increases where we 
keep all of the given the parameters as same and increase t Small languages end rises up 
with  decrease  in  local  slope  with  time  in  the  meantime  local  slope  for  big  languages  end 
becomes more and more steep In short small languages end becomes the top of the plot for 
MP and big languages end turns to be power law with exponent about negative unity see 
Figure 2 the plot in open squares where the slope for plot in solid squares at tail is 07 
Thus  we  have  power  law  with  exponent  zero  at  the  beginning  we  have  power  law  with 
exponent about negative unity for future and intermediately ie at the present time we have 
log-normal for size distribution We will revisit the current issue in further paragraphs of this 
section and in sections 32-34 and 4 
   Time distribution of languages is another important issue besides the size distribution We 
consider here lifetime for the extinct languages and ages of the present ones Figure 3 is the 
lifetimes of languages at present t1920 thick solid past t1920 thin solid and in future 
1920t  dashed  Parameters  are  same  as  before  Here  we  observe  that  many  ancestors 
survive in all t only two ancestor languages are found as mutated or having become extinct 
before t1920 Secondly generated languages are distributed exponentially decreasing with 
age in both cases Inset is the number of speakers for each of the living language at present 
time which evolved out of the initial ones with random size The biggest present language 
Chinese is spoken by little more than one billion 1G in the inset human 
   We obtained many similar results for the same parameters yet for different number of time 
steps where we observed that the negative exponent remained same in results Secondly 
we tried the same number of time steps as the one utilized within the previous case and we 
change other parameters Considering these new parameters which give similar PDF for the 
present  empirical  distribution  of  languages  over  size  we  observed  similar  exponential 
behavior  for  distribution  of  emerged  languages  over  age  where  the  negative  exponents 
depend  on  the  parameters  Consecutively  we  may  state  that  generated  languages  are 
distributed  decreasing  exponentially  independent  of  the  parameters  used  with  age  and 
negative exponents depend on the parameters It is obvious that increasing H directly and 
increasing R indirectly since any size hardly becomes less than unity for big R promotes 
many new languages to emerge As a result linear portions of the plots left end in Fig 4 
which has logarithmic vertical axis for the number becomes steeper which means that the 
exponents  increase  in  absolute  value  There  we  may  consider  the  situation  as  scaling  the 
horizontal time axis where increasing H and R amounts to increasing the unit for a time 
step and decreasing the number of time steps from the initial time t0 up to the present and 
vice versa 
   Elimination G1 plays a role which is opposite to that of fragmentation H and growth 
R in evolution where H and R develop the evolution forward and G recedes So the present 
competition turns out to be one between H and R and G Number of languages are essentially 
determined by H and G where two criteria are crucial For a given number of time steps R 
and M0 etc there is a critical value for G where for GcriticalG 1 languages survive and 
for smaller values of G ie if GGcritical languages may become extinct totally Secondly 
sum of H and G is a decisive parameter for the evolution If for a given G with GcriticalG 
HG1 then the number of languages does not increase and does not decrease but oscillates 
about M0 since almost same amount of languages emerges by H and becomes extinct 
by G at each time step and we have intermediate elimination On the other hand if HG1 
then languages decrease in number with time and we have high strong heavy elimination 
Only for 1HG with G1 we have low weak light elimination of languages where the 
number increases yet slowly with respect to the case for G1 It is obvious that elimination 
slows down the evolution It amounts to decreasing the unit for a time step and increasing the 
number of time steps from the initial time t0 up to the present and vice versa So we need 
more time to arrive at a given configuration of languages ie total number size total size 
PDF etc 
   Now we introduce G09996 with H00022 as before where 1HG and we have light 
elimination We have the parameters same as before for M0 100 number of ancestors 
and  Pi0  10000  number  of  initial  speakers  which  grows  with  the  rate  R000752  as 
before Eq 1 At the end of 1920 time steps we have W about 13 billion and M about 3030 
Eq  2  where  it  may  be  observed  that  light  elimination  is  effective  on  the  number  of 
languages rather than on world population World population Wt and number of languages 
Mt increases exponentially disregarding the abrupt and temporary recessions not shown 
with exponents 000235 and 78x10-4 respectively Figure 4 is the resulting size and the inset 
is time distribution of languages at t1920 solid squares for size where PDF is smaller in 
height with respect to the one solid squares in Fig 2 If we increase H to 00028 keeping 
other parameters same as before we observe a different picture not shown where small 
size end of the PDF plot is higher since fragmentation is higher yet we do not have small 
languages spoken by few people Many small languages are now spoken by some hundred or 
thousand human at minimum Languages move towards right on the plot PDF for size as 
their speakers increase in number and they move towards left as they fragment and become 
extinct at the left end when they are spoken by no human 
   Log-normal  plot  in  open  squares  for  t3000  future  in  Fig  4  is  clearly  asymmetric  It 
involves a long tail for big sizes and a short arm for small sizes top of the plot is for about 
100000 speakers etc Please note that the plot with open squares in Fig 2 is for G1 and for 
t3000 for future and the only different parameter here with respect to the corresponding 
plot in Fig 2 is G Initial conditions are similar not same because we have random Pi0 in 
both cases but evolution parameters are different yet the plots are similar in many aspects 
First of all in both cases we have higher left arm for small languages with respect to the 
plots  for  the  present  time  which  implies  that  present  small  languages  will  decay  in  time 
where punctuation increases the rate for decay Secondly we have decreasing exponential 
time  distribution  in  both  cases  and  punctuation  G1  decreases  the  exponent  in  absolute 
value As a result of punctuation we may expect more people speaking a given language in 
future due to some mechanisms else than fragmentation for example change of languages 
in terms of physical or cultural colonization etc since top of the plot for future in Fig 4 is 
lower  than  top  of  the  corresponding  plot  in  Fig  2  On  the  other  hand  as  we  mentioned 
previously two paragraphs before that presence of G1 amounts to increasing the unit for 
time steps So the plot in solid squares in Fig 4 may be viewed as one for future with smaller 
parameters  for  H  and  R  More  clearly  if  one  utilizes  bigger  parameters  for  H  R  he  may 
obtain the target configuration for languages for smaller t if G1  And since G1 eliminates 
Mt randomly we need bigger parameters for H and R to mimic the size distribution world 
population size of the biggest language and other empirical data As a result size distribution 
comes out with long tail for big size and with short arm for small size Moreover sizes for 
small languages increase ie we do not have languages spoken by few human any more 
   As time evolves top of the PDF for size moves towards left due to fragmentation H and 
tail becomes more and more crowded due to increase in population R As a result we have 
two configurations For some H and R we have local horizontal behavior for small size 
saturation and we have a decline for big size which becomes roughly straight in many of 
our runs not shown Secondly for bigger H without changing R top of the plot rises at 
small  language  end  and  we  have  roughly  straight  distribution  for  many  big  languages  in 
log-log axes which means that we have power law see paragraph 6 of sect 31 
   We  had  already  considered  age  distribution  of  the  generated  languages  as  decreasing 
exponentials in time for G1 where age distribution for ancestor languages is delta function 
ie  same  1920  for  all  of  the  ancestors  And  now  we  have  similar  exponential  time 
distribution for G1 yet with smaller exponent in absolute value not shown Secondly for 
G1 number of living ancestors decreases in time with high fragmentation not shown and 
with the same H for fragmentation as before not shown where we have only 32 ancestor 
languages present at t1920 for G1 with H00022 
   Please note that ancestor languages may fragment at any time t1920 and they may give 
birth to new languages where size may vary in time for ancestor and generated languages 
We count these languages as ancestor if their lifetime is 1920 for 1920 time steps Figure 5 
is the time distribution for lifetime of the languages which became extinct and the inset is 
the relative frequency of events for extinction all with G1 where other parameters are same 
as before 
   We  observe  that  the  distribution  for  lifetime  for  extinct  languages  are  also  decreasing 
exponential  with  exponent  0001  as  given  by  an  exponential  fit  not  shown  As  a  result 
more languages become extinct in their youth and less ones become extinct as they become 
old  In  other  words  languages  become  extinct  either  with  short  lifetime  soon  after  their 
generation or they hardly become extinct later and live long which may be considered as a 
kind of natural selection It may be noted that long living languages have many speakers 
and they hardly become extinct in terms of splitting 
   Certainly  we  do  not  have  any  empirical  record  for  time  distribution  of  languages  to 
compare our results Yet the number of time steps we utilized 1920 may correspond to 
roughly  last  20000  years  of  history  with  the  initial  conditions  M0  100  and  W0 
500000 So our time unit may correspond to about a decade in year and 10 to 100 time 
steps ie century to millennium for a given ancient language to become extinct may be 
considered as reasonable We count the number of extinct languages in Fig 5 as 618 about 
10 of the living ones which may also be considered as reasonable 
   Inset in Fig 5 shows the ratio of languages which became extinct to the ones living at any t 
0t1920 where we observe cascades within extinctions which decay in time And as time 
evolves  cascades  disappear  and  we  have  a  constant  noise  for  which  we  have  the  present 
slightly asymmetric log-normal size distribution MP 
   As the final remark of this section we note that the number of time steps which we used 
within the runs are 3000 2430 1920 and 270 and they go in squares ie with 30m2 where 
m10 9 8 and 3 respectively It is because we observed that size distribution develops in 
roughly equal amounts in log-log plot if we increase our maximum number of time steps in 
squares For example consider Fig 3 when we plot PDF for t480 m4 750 m5 1080 
m6  and  1470  m7  they  fill  in  space  between  the  plot  for  t270  and  t1920  almost 
uniformly And if we continue for m9 and 10 the mentioned uniformity survives We think 
that  evolution  of  language  distribution  for  size  may  be  running  in  steps  which  are 
proportional  to  square  of  time  periods  Also  see  Figure  7  where  number  of  ancestors 
decreases roughly uniformly with square of time 
32      Cities  We  claim  that  initial  world  is  not  much  relevant  for  the  present  size 
configuration of cities Moreover we may obtain similar configurations for various evolution 
parameters In Figure 6 we display three PDF for size distributions with different initial and 
evolution parameters where the maximum population for ancestors P10000 and splitting 
factor  S01  is  same  with  G1  for  all  Please  note  that  S  is  not  the  maximum  value 
which  is  05  effectively  since  we  think  that  any  number  of  human  may  change  their 
language  yet  a  city  may  split  only  in  small  portions  On  the  other  hand  it  is  known  that 
minimum size for a language is unity but it is not defined for a city A city may actually also 
be a village of single house except if we demand a minimum population For that reason we 
considered several minimum populations for a city In Figure 6 slopes for linear fits dashed 
lines are about 1 -1 squares 2 -1 circles and 3 -085 stars And  utilized parameters 
are  1  squares  M0100  R0005  H  001  number  of  time  steps2430  and  minimum 
population  for  a  city  626  2  circles  M0100  R00062  H  002  number  of  time 
steps3000  and  minimum  population  for  a  city740  and  3  stars M010  R0005  H 
0015  number  of  time  steps1470  and  minimum  population  for  a  city  1  We  observed 
many other power laws about minus unity for several other combinations of parameters 
not  shown  where  we  observe  also  that  a  very  wide  range  of  parameters  give  the  same 
Pareto-Zipf  law  And  we  obtain  decreasing  exponential  time  distributions  for  lifetime  of 
extinct cities and ages of the livings ones for big M0 and for M0 less than or equal to 
about 10 the mentioned decreasing exponential distributions for lifetime changes in form 
Please see Figs 3 and 4 for similar distributions for languages and note that exponents are 
same for different t which may be utilized to predict the terminal number for cities and that 
for languages under some assumptions as we will mention in section 33 
   At  present  it  is  obvious  that  Wt  and  Mt  increases  exponentially  due  to  R  and  H 
respectively  since  G1  For  GcriticalG1  increase  in  Mt  lessens  and  for  GcriticalG  and 
GH1 we have oscillations in Mt about M0 which is not a realistic case as the one for 
GcriticalG1 where we have few cities at the end and we do not consider them here 
33   Languages and cities It is worth to emphasize that languages and cities are no longer 
the  same  and  that  for  some  intermediate  times  the  cities  obey  the  1size  law  while  the 
languages obey the log-normal distribution for the same or better similar set of parameters 
   As  we  mentioned  in  the  previous  section  time  distribution  of  cities  lifetime  for  extinct 
cities  and  ages  of  the  livings  ones  are  decreasing  exponentials  disregarding  the  cases  for 
small number of ancestors as shown in Figure 7 Simple probability density functions are 
also exponential not shown which means that cities occupy time distribution plots Figs 3 
4 and 7 in exponential order more cities for small t and less cities for big t for a given 
number of time steps in all Inset of Fig 7 is simple probability density function of living 
cities at t1920 which is decreasing exponential with the rate exponent of 000185 per time 
step where the number of living ancestor cities is 37 at present as shown by a solid square 
which  is  far  from  the  curve  and  they  M0  say  about  1000  in  number  at  most  can  be 
neglected within some hundred thousand cities at present if ancestors have small sizes On 
the other hand we know that size distribution for languages is not power law for the present 
time Yet they display decreasing exponential time distributions lifetime of extinct languages 
and ages of the livings ones disregarding the cases for small number of ancestors similar to 
the ones for cities For random elimination case punctuation for languages with G09988 
H00022  ie  light  elimination  for  R  00082  simple  probability  density  function  not 
shown  similar  to  the  one  in  the  inset  of  Fig  7  is  decreasing  exponential  with  exponent 
about 00017 where the number for the youngest languages ie these emerged within the 
last 192 time steps since we divide horizontal time axis into equal 100 parts to calculate 
probability is 2430 for 1920 time steps where decrease in the number of living ancestors in 
time from hundred to about ten is observable 
   Now we may represent the probability density function by t where t stands for the 
number of time steps and  stands for ages of the languages at t and  counts the languages 
with age  at t with 0 t It is obvious that the integral of  over with 0 t gives the 
number of living not all but generated languages at t which is equal to the number of total 
living  languages  Mt  minus  the  number  of  living  ancestors  and  the  number  of  living 
ancestors goes zero with tcid198 
   In Fig 7 and in many others not shown we observe that exponent  say of t is 
independent of t for languages and cities Assuming that the exponent 000185 for cities 
will remain as constant for tcid198 we may predict Mtcid198 A simple integration of t 
1texp- over   with 0 t can be performed for Mt since living ancestors decay 
in terms of fragmentation and random elimination with time Mt1texp-t The 
crucial parameter for the result is 1t ie number of newly generated languages or newly 
established cities at 1 for each t It is obvious that 1t can not be constant or a decreasing 
function with t Because we have elimination with G1 and number of eliminated languages 
or  cities  increases  with  t  languages  change  and  some  of  them  become  useless  and  cities 
become old and ruined in time 1t may be an increasing function in time due to non zero 
fragmentation H If 1t increases linearly with time we get saturation in Mtcid198 which 
is  not  contradiction  since  we  have  elimination  If 1t  increases  exponentially  with  the 
exponent   we  have  saturation  in  Mtcid198  for     and  we  have  Mtcid1980  for    
Since we know that at present Mt increases with time we may guess that   ie we 
invent  new  languages  and  establish  new  cities  which  increase  either  linearly  or 
exponentially with the exponent bigger than 00017 for languages and bigger than 000185 
for  cities  in  time  One  may  guess  that  Mtcid198  will  saturate  in  reality  since  human 
population for languages and surface area of earth for languages is limited 
   On the other hand it is known that cities were states in past yet it is not certain whether 
one language was spoken per city state or vice versa For the present we have about 7000 
languages at present for a world population which is little less than 10 billion as mentioned 
within  the  first  paragraph  of  sect  31  For  the  size  distribution  designated  by  number  1 
squares in Fig 6 we have about 110 thousand cities with a world population which is about 
5  billion  not  shown  So  one  may  say  that  a  language  is  spoken  within  15  city  on  the 
average at present Yet it is not meaningful because of several reasons one of which is that 
we counted these as city which have 626 citizens at minimum And we do not know totally 
how many human are living in towns and villages etc But it is obvious that we have much 
more cities than the languages in the present world We have many metropolitan cities in the 
present  world  where  only  one  language  is  spoken  by  big  majorities  And  we  have  many 
cities per country where the number of languages is smaller than the number of cities etc It 
is  certain  that  ratio  of  the  number  of  total  languages  to  that  of  cities  is  less  than  unity  at 
present 
   Thus far we considered within various paragraphs that languages and cities as products of 
the same humans are very similar to each other in many respects Yet languages and cities 
are no longer the same and for some intermediate times the cities obey the 1size law while 
the  languages  obey  the  log-normal  distribution  for  the  same  or  better  similar  set  of 
parameters We predict that log-normal size distribution may turn into power law with the 
same parameters if only the number of time steps is increased ie in future Moreover 
languages  and  cities  have  decreasing  exponential  time  distributions  lifetime  for  extinct 
cities and age for the livings ones 
   In the next section we will consider power law distribution for cities over size where we 
will utilize big number sum of decreasing exponential functions with independent random 
numbers for amplitude and exponent and show that the sum gives power law -1 
34      Sum  of  exponential  functions  with  random  and  independent  amplitude  and  exponent 
Lets consider exponential functions zjkx where the amplitude and exponent are random 
and independent for a real or complex number b 
In Eq 3 x is any independent variable Aj is one random number Amin Aj  Amax and BBk is 
another random number BminB  BBk  Bmax which are independent of each other In other words 
we  select  A  and  B  from  different  sets  of  random  numbers  between  which  there  is  no 
connection It is obvious that real b may be taken as a scaling factor for x or for BkB  ie one 
may select b1 for a unit of x-axis and one may select b1 for a scaled unit of x-axis with 
xcid198bx And similarly one may select b1 for some BBmin and Bmax and one may select b1 for 
B cid198bBmin and BBmaxcid198bBmax Now we take b in Eq 3 as negative for positive BkB  bcid198-b 
thus we will have negative exponents 
   Within a system we may have several physical quantities which vary in proportion to zjkx 
or  to  derivatives  and  integrals  of  zjkx  Lets  consider  one  such  function  yjkx  which  is 
proportional to zjkx ie yjkx zjkx where the constant for proportion is taken as unity for 
simplicity We define 
jkx  AjexpBBkbx     
Yxj
K yjkxJK    
with some big yet finite J and K where the order of sum is not important due to independence 
of the random numbers and random numbers are generated homogeneously  
   Inset  of  Figure  8  is  for  yjkx  Eq  3  with  b01  and  Amin  Bmin  00  Amax    Bmax10 
which  may  be  considered  as  size  distribution  for  languages  or  cities  along  x-axis  where  x 
counts the agents ie we place an agent i1 at x1 if it is generated right after an agent i 
which is placed at x Please note the present ancestors for small x For the sum in Eq 4 one 
may select the random numbers same for all x and one may select new different random 
numbers at each x where all of the random numbers are completely independent Ai is one 
random number AminAiAmax and BBi is another random number Bmin
 in all Figure 
8 displays Yx Eq 4 with JK1000 for Amin Bmin 00 Amax 10 Bmax10 where we 
have no fluctuation in Y for the random numbers selected same for each x dashed thick line 
and fluctuation in Y increases in magnitude as x increases fluctuating plot for the random 
numbers re-selected for each x And in both cases we have power law as the arrow with 
slope -1 indicates in log-log axes 
   Obviously the important issue in Fig 8 is that Yx is a power function for large x with the 
power of minus unity ie 
B BBjBmax

K yjkxJK  x-1    
which is similar to Pareto-Zipf law if x stands for city population We may state that if the 
probability of finding a city with population about x say  xdx decreases exponentially with 
independent random amplitude and exponent then the sum of mentioned probabilities gives 
the famous power law In other words reason for the mentioned power law is the randomness 
in  amplitude  and  negative  exponent  of  the  probability  of  finding  a  city  with  population 
about x say  xdx Clearly Eq 5 is valid for every situation competition between cities 
that between languages and similarly between speciation and extinction etc if it satisfies 
the  given  conditions  ie  random  and  positive  amplitudes  independently  random  and 
negative exponents 
   For  homogeneously  yet  independent  distributions  for  the  random  numbers  Aj  for  the 
amplitudes and BBk for the exponents with Amin Aj  Amax and Bmin
B  BBk  Bmax one may 
utilize the general theorem of central limit with large N or just convert the double sum into a 
double integral over A Ajcid198A and B BkB cid198B which vary linearly since the random numbers 
are homogeneously distributed between the extrema to obtain the following equalities

since the exponential term approaches to zero as x increases And the result is power law 
with power minus one Eq 5 It is obvious that BBmax may always be taken as unity and b 
may be varied accordingly We may state that our analysis Eqs 5-8 is general for any set 
of independent random numbers for amplitudes provided Amax and Amin is finite and that for 
exponents provided BminB  0 where BBmax 1 may be taken after changing b accordingly For 
some other applications of the present issue in biology for example see 8 
  As  we  mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  this  section  that  b  in  Eqs  3-8  may  be  real  or 
complex  It  is  obvious  that  for  a  complex  specifically  purely  imaginary  b  Yx  may  be 
expressed in terms of sinus and cosinus functions so we get oscillatory behavior in Mt Eq 
2  for  GH1  for  example  and  similarly  in  time  series  for  price  in  economy  etc 
Furthermore yjkx in Eq 4 may be proportional to first second etc derivative of zjkx in 
Eq 3 or to integral of it where we have more interesting cases since then we have more 
than two random numbers in yjkx We consider these cases within Appendix 
Appendix 
Power  law  for  harmonic  oscillation      For  complex  b  ie  bcid198ib  yjkx    AjexpBBkbx 
which  may  be  re-written  as  a  linear  combination  of  sine  and  cosine  yjkx    AjsinBkB bx   
AjcosBBkbx  Then we have 
Yxj
K AjsinBBkbx  AjcosBkB bxJK 
which is similar to Eq 9 in 9 It is obvious that not Yx in Eq 9 but its envelope has 
power law -1 as the following equation implies 
Yx  A2
max  A2
minsinBBmaxbx  cosBmin
bx2bx     
Power law with higher power   Now lets suppose that yjkx is proportional to dzjkxdx 
then we have three at a first glance it may be seen as two random numbers two of which 
are independent in yjkx  bAjBBkexpBkB bx after taking the proportionality constant as unity 
One may show after a similar analysis Eqs 3-8 that Yx  x2 Similarly if yjkx is 
proportional to d2zjkxdx2 then we have Yx  x3 etc For similar distribution functions 
for price in economy where x stands for the relative price change more precisely for the 
change in the logarithm of the price one may see 10 and relevant references therein  
4   Discussion and conclusion Starting with random initial conditions and utilizing many 
random  parameters  for  evolution  we  obtained  many  regularities  for  size  and  time 
distributions etc under the process of random multiplicative noise for growth and random 
fragmentation  for  generation  and  extinction  of  languages  or  cities  with  no  further  random 
elimination  G1  We  find  that  results  are  independent  of  initial  conditions  disregarding 
some  extra  ordinary  ones  If  we  have  G1  we  need  longer  time  to  mimic  a  target 
configuration  where  new  generated  languages  or  cities  may  be  inserted  in  terms  of 
fragmentation  provided  GcriticalG  and  1GH  Furthermore  many  languages  or  cities 
become  extinct  in  their  youth  and  less  ones  become  extinct  as  they  become  old  In  other 
words  languages  or  cities  become  extinct  either  with  short  lifetime  soon  after  their 
generation or they hardly become extinct later and live long which may be considered as a 
kind of natural selection 
   It is known that logistic maps Eq 1 are dynamic and under some circumstances they 
may become chaotic We predict that time distribution for languages or cities are decreasing 
exponential and log-normal size distribution for languages at present may turn into power law 
in future Power law -1 for size distribution of present cities may be result of decreasing 
exponential distribution of their probability over size It is worth to mention that finite sum of 
decreasing  exponential  functions  with  two  independent  random  numbers  one  for  the 
exponent and one for the amplitude may be useful to express many relevant phenomena as 
well in biology and economy 
   In  summary  languages  and  cities  are  not  the  same  and  for  some  intermediate  times  the 
cities obey the 1size law while the languages obey the log-normal distribution where the 
decisive parameters are fragmentation rate H and splitting factor S We have smaller H 
and bigger S for languages with respect to these for cities for the same population growth 
rate R which governs the world population which is the same for languages and cities and 
for the same set of other parameters
