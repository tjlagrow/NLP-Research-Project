AbstractThis paper explores two separate questions
Can we perform natural language processing tasks without
a lexicon and Should we Existing natural
language
processing techniques are either based on words as units
or use units such as grams only for basic classication
tasks How close can a machine come to reasoning about
the meanings of words and phrases in a corpus without
using any lexicon based only on grams
Our own motivation for posing this question is based on
our efforts to nd popular trends in words and phrases
from online Chinese social media This form of written
Chinese uses so many neologisms creative character place-
ments and combinations of writing systems that it has
been dubbed the Martian Language Readers must often
use visual queues audible queues from reading out loud
and their knowledge and understanding of current events
to understand a post For analysis of popular trends the
specic problem is that it is difcult to build a lexicon when
the invention of new ways to refer to a word or concept
is easy and common For natural language processing in
general we argue in this paper that new uses of language
in social media will challenge machines abilities to operate
with words as the basic unit of understanding not only in
Chinese but potentially in other languages
I INTRODUCTION
We propose the pointillism model for natural language
processing In the proposed model a corpus is divided
into grams eg bigrams and trigrams in the applications
of this model we have developed for Chinese so far
and words and phrases are constructed from grams
using external information eg temporal correlations in
the appearance of grams In painting pointillism is a
technique where complex scenes can be represented by
arrangements of just a few primary colors into dots This
is contrasted with detailed strokes using the full pallet of
colors For machines understanding a corpus as a time
sequence of grams may be more tractable than trying
to maintain an accurate lexicon for many applications
and contexts Thus we propose the pointillism model as
an alternative to natural language processing based on
As a specic case study in Section II we consider
the analysis of topical trends in Chinese social media
The written form of Chinese that is used for social
media contains so many neologisms creative character
placements and combinations of writing systems that
it has been dubbed the Martian Language 1 2
To evade censorship convey special meaning or simply
for creative reasons it is common for Chinese speakers
to invent completely new ways to reference a topic
or current event whenever they post content This not
only makes it difcult to build a lexicon that contains
all possible terms but it also exacerbates the already
difcult task of Chinese text segmentation and means
that the co-occurrences of words or grams alone may
not be enough information to link posts about the same
Figure 1 contrasts a typical traditional approach to
trend analysis with the pointillism approach In a tradi-
tional method a lexicon is used to break the corpus up
into words and then the trends of words and sequences
of words are analyzed This requires a lexicon and a
good way to divide the text into words An example
of the pointillism approach might begin with trend
analysis of trigrams Then for trigrams that appear to
have an interesting trend an analysis phase uses external
information such as correlations in trigram frequency
over time
to build trending words and phrases out
of overlapping trigrams The main advantage of the
pointillism approach is that word segmentation and other
tasks that require a lexicon are not necessary meaning
that even corpuses with many unknown words can be
analyzed A disadvantage of the pointillism approach
is that external information is needed in this case the
frequency of the appearance of trigrams with a relatively
high resolution on the time scale For these reasons
while a more traditional trend analysis may be more
appropriate for for example analysis of blog posts in
English 3 we assert that the pointillism approach is
more effective in a different context such as the analysis
of microblog posts in Chinese
In contrast to other approaches based on grams 4
5 the pointillism approach uses external information
detailed timing information that contains correlations
based on human diurnal patterns and current events
Microblog posts have a timestamp that is accurate to the
minute or second though in this paper we bin posts by
the hour This timing information enables us to build
words and phrases out of trigrams and then group those











Fig 1 Change of Order
Fig 2 Trigram trends for  on Weibo
words and phrases into topical clusters
Figure 2 shows an example of the temporal patterns
that we exploit This is from a dataset that we are collect-
ing from Weibo a Chinese-language microblogging site
that is similar to Twitter The word we are analyzing
in this gure is  Peoples Republic
of China This is neither a neologism nor an unknown
word that cannot be found in the dictionary but it is a
good example of a word that can create ambiguities for
word segmenters Substrings of this word are themselves
words  alternate formal name for China 
ethnic Chinese   the people     the
Chinese people and  republic Most individual
characters in Chinese are themselves words as well eg
 person or  and The temporal correlations shown
in Figure 2 exist for unknown and uncommon words but
we use a common term in the gure so that the temporal
correlations we refer to are illustrated for the reader
The rest of this paper is structured as follows First
we present some preliminary results from an application
of the pointillism approach in Section II to demonstrate
that natural language processing tasks that go beyond
simple document classications can be carried out with-
out a lexicon Then in Section III we give examples
from several languages where the pointillism approach
may be applicable Then we conclude with some open
questions and nal remarks
II TREND ANALYSIS IN CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA
In another paper 6 we describe the detailed algo-
rithms we used to build a system that connects trigrams
of Chinese characters from Weibo together into longer
words and phrases based on frequency correlations Here
we give an example from that paper where these fre-
quency correlations can help piece together the details of
a trending story even though only a meaningless trigram
showed a strong trend and posts about the event shared
only very common words On 4 August 2011 the trigram
 showed a strong trend Running the algorithms
described in Song et al 6 to nd overlapping trigrams
with frequency correlations gives a set of candidates that
a human can use to understand the event that lead to the
10010020110804d gram
up1conn
Wan made a TV program about the first
immigrants

The statue was  by the police

The statue was splashed 

The statue was splashed with red paint

The statue was splashed with red oil
5
The statue was  by 5 men
5
The statue was defaced by 5 men
5
The statue was  by 5 men who have

The statue was smashed

The first immigrant people
 is a trigram which has no meaning in Chinese
We caught this particular trigram out of the 323 million
trigrams in our database because it appeared 100 times
more frequently than average on 4 August 2011 After
we fed this trigram into a trigram connector and set the
connection time from 5 days before to 5 days afterward
we found the phrase  Wan made
a TV program about the rst immigrants This is still
not clear enough to tell us why making a TV program
created a trend However
if you read the candidate
results the whole story becomes clear It tells us that
5 men smashed and splashed red oil paint on the statue
of The First Immigrants
In this event there are many trigram words such as
 statues  immigrants  red oil
paint and so on However the only trigram with a strong
trend was  a meaningless trigram In general
these three characters did not appear together before
this event The sudden frequency increase of this trigram
from 0 helps our system notice this trigram which lead
us to this event Other trigrams did not increase in rate
as much as  because of this event This may be
because they already exist and are common words and
thus it is difcult for them to have a precipitous increase
in one day
As an example of such a connection with an improved
algorithm based on term frequencyinverse document
frequency tf-idf we were able to make the connection
between oil prices and diesel prices in two Weibo trends
that were related
09515623470222634
Tomorrow oil prices will again rise
09359352855815268

The algorithms and complete results will be published

III SOCIAL MEDIA EXAMPLES
In this section we give some examples in various
languages where approaches based on lexicons may fail
A An example from Japan
The following example of a post from Twitter is
a mixture of English Kanji Chinese characters and
Hiragana a Japanese syllabary
post
A rough translation of the post is I have been in
the dressing room for three days can you make a post
to explain in three lines what has been going on 
 is relatively straightforward Japanese text
that translates to I have been in the dressing room for
three days  is a neologism that is explained in a
blog post by Maggie Sensei 7  is the name of a
company Imakita but in this case serves as a neologism
for   which translates to I just got
here explain in three lines what has been going on 
 in Japanese is pronounced Sangyou but sounds like
 or sanggyou meaning three lines 
 is Japanese Hiragana for make and post is an
English word
This example demonstrates the ability of Japanese
social media users to mix different character systems
play with sounds and combine different languages This
gives microblog posters great freedom of expression in
how they use written language to express their meaning
When the posters are using this freedom while posting
about current events and hot trends natural language
processing based on a lexicon may not be able to
categorize the topic of the post based only on the words
in the lexicon
B An example from India
It is very common in India to mix languages in social
media posts such as this example from Twitter that uses
a mixture of Hindi and English
saale government ki maakiaankh kutteke bac-
che social networking sites bandh karega ek ek
madharchod ka gaand maro bhenchod
This translates to
Bad-boy governments eye-of-mother son-of-
dogs want social networking sites shut down each and
every motherfuckers ass be raped sisterfucker
A topical analysis of social media aimed at sentiment
analysis would be concerned with the topic of the post
that the sentiment is being directed at In this case it
is an alleged government proposal to shut down social
media sites In this post government and social media
sites are in English but the words expressing the desire
to ban these sites and the authors sentiment towards
this are in Hindi Indian social media also contains
many regional languages so any sentiment analysis of
Indian social media sites would have to incorporate many
different ways of mixing languages Can the pointillism
approach help in this case or is it better to build build
a comprehensive lexicon that incorporates these many
languages We leave this as an open question
C An example from China
The following is an excerpt from a blog post in China

 

The author is using poetry and creatively pointing
out character similarities in different words to make
a point without explicitly writing their meaning The
phrase is a poem and translates to Yaqing dont call
me rude this kind of talk is also at a loss for meaning
the circumstances now are a broken record that can
be expressed with a poem Zhongnanhai has authority
over the South China Sea Diaoyutai State Guesthouse
has authority over the Diaoyu islands Zhongnanhai is
the central headquarters of Chinas State Council and
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse is a hotel where leaders of
foreign nations stay when they visit Beijing The author
is expressing an opinion about a recent event in which
China demanded an apology from Japan over the Diaoyu
island dispute rather than demanding compensation 
 is a neologism that refers to Elegant Youth in
contrast to  which means angry youth In this
context  means people who would prefer a less
militant solution to the Diaoyu Island dispute 
is a repeating machine that records audio and then plays
it back eg for use as a study aid in the classroom
to record lectures for later review so in this context is
similar to the English phrase broken record in terms
of connotations
When authors use this kind of indirect language to ex-
press opinions about current events the co-occurrences
of known words and individual grams sometimes are not
enough to adequately capture the full range of topics
touched on by a post The trigram  suggests that
the example post is related to Diaoyu island which was
probably a trend at the time the post was written but the
post also has phrases that suggest government authority
 foreign inuence 
a situation  and circumstances that have
not changed  Other authors will have other
methods for expressing these concepts An advantage
of the pointillism approach is that external information
such as frequency correlations in trigrams can help to
link together similar concepts that are expressed in very
different ways
Humans are able to use their understanding of current
events to understand the meaning of a blog post such as
the example above For natural language processing a
machine lacks this contextual information but is able to
perform calculations on how the trigrams that might be
parts of words or phrases correlate over time in terms
of the frequency of their usage This information can
serve as proxy information for context and may enable
natural language processing tasks to make connections
that go beyond co-occurrences and get closer to the
actual meaning of social media content
IV CONCLUSION
In conclusion we have given supporting evidence to
suggest that carrying out a natural language processing
task specically trend analysis is possible without a
lexicon is possible We have also given examples in
several languages where removing the dependence on
a lexicon could be benecial Thus we propose the
pointillism approach to natural language processing as
being particularly suitable for certain languages and
contexts
