Concepts and methods of complex networks have been applied to probe the properties of a myriad of real sys-
tems 1 The nding that written texts modeled as graphs share several properties of other completely dierent real
systems has inspired the study of language as a complex system 2 Actually language can be represented as a
complex network in its several levels of complexity As a consequence morphological syntactical and semantical
properties have been employed in the construction of linguistic networks 3 Even the character level has been useful
to unfold particular patterns 4 5 In the review by Cong and Liu 6 the authors emphasize the need to use the
topological information of complex networks modeling the various spheres of the language to better understand its
origins evolution and organization In addition the authors cite the use of networks in applications aiming at holistic
typology and stylistic variations In this context I will discuss some possible directions that could be followed in
future research directed towards the understanding of language via topological characterization of complex linguistic
networks In addition I will comment the use of network models for language processing applications Additional
prospects for future practical research lines will also be discussed in this comment
The topological analysis of complex textual networks has been widely studied in the recent years As for co-
occurrence networks of characters it was possible to verify that they follow the scale-free and small-world features 4
Co-occurrence networks of words or adjacency networks have accounted for most of the models tackling textual
applications In special they have been more prevalent than syntactical networks because they represent a simplied
representation of the complex syntactical analysis 7 8 as most of the syntactical links occur between neighboring
words Despite its outward simplicity co-occurrence networks have proven useful in many applications such as
in authorship recognition 9 extractive summarization 10 11 12 stylistic identication 13 and part-of-speech
tagging 14 Furthermore such representation has also been useful in the analysis of the complexity 15 and quality
of texts 16 Unfortunately a major problem arising from the analyses performed with co-occurrence networks is
the diculty to provide a rigorous interpretation of the factors accounting for the success of the model Therefore
future investigations should pursue a better interpretation at the network level aiming at the understanding of the
fundamental properties of the language Most importantly it is clear from some recent studies 8 9 that novel
topological measurements should be introduced to capture a wider range of linguistic features
Many of the applications relying on network analysis outperform other traditional shallow strategies in natural lan-
guage processing see eg the extractive summarization task 10 11 However when deep analyzes are performed
network-based strategies usually do not perform better than other techniques making extensive use of semantic re-
sources and tools In order to improve the performance of network-based applications I suggest a twofold research
line i the introduction of measurements consistent with the nature of the problem and ii the combination of
topological strategies with other traditional natural language processing methods More specically in i I propose

the conception of measurements that are able to capture semantic aspects since the topological measurements of
co-occurrence networks capture mostly syntactic factors 8 Although such networks have proved useful in some
semantical-dependent tasks see eg a topological approach to word sense disambiguation in 17 I believe that the
creation of novel semantic-based measurements would improve the state of the art Alternative forms to create the
network could also be useful to grasp semantical features hidden in the topological space In ii I suggest for exam-
ple the introduction of a hybrid classier that could consider both linguistic deeper linguistic processing 18 and
topological attributes at the same time in a hybrid way Examples of combinations of distinct strategies are described
in 9 19 and 20
In sum the network framework has proven applicable to understand the properties of the language and its ap-
plications especially those related to the textual classication in several levels Despite the limitations imposed by
the restrict understanding of the mechanisms behind the classication it is worth noting that the such representation
remains entirely generic being therefore useful to many tasks as well as for analyzing the evolution of languages cul-
tures and emotional trends For this reason I believe that the use of complex networks in both practical and theoretical
investigations shall yield novels insights into the mechanisms behind the language
