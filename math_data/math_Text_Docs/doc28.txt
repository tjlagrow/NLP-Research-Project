T cells form intriguing patterns during adhesion to antigen-presenting cells The patterns at the
cell-cell contact zone are composed of two types of domains which either contain short TCRMHCp
receptor-ligand complexes or the longer LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes The nal pattern consists of
a central TCRMHCp domain surrounded by a ring-shaped LFA-1ICAM-1 domain while the
characteristic pattern formed at intermediate times is inverted with TCRMHCp complexes at the
periphery of the contact zone and LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes in the center
In this article we
present a statistical-mechanical model of cell adhesion and propose a novel mechanism for the T
cell pattern formation Our mechanism for the formation of the intermediate inverted pattern is
based i on the initial nucleation of numerous TCRMHCp microdomains and ii on the diu-
sion of free receptors and ligands into the contact zone Due to this inward diusion TCRMHCp
microdomains at the rim of the contact zone grow faster and form an intermediate peripheral ring
for suciently large TCRMHCp concentrations In agreement with experiments we nd that the
formation of the nal pattern with a central TCRMHCp domain requires active cytoskeletal trans-
port processes Without active transport the intermediate inverted pattern seems to be metastable
in our model which might explain patterns observed during natural killer NK cell adhesion At
smaller TCRMHCp complex concentrations we observe a dierent regime of pattern formation
with intermediate multifocal TCRMHCp patterns which resemble experimental patterns found
during thymozyte adhesion

INTRODUCTION
T lymphozytes mediate immune responses by adher-
ing to cells which display foreign peptide fragments on
their surface These peptide fragments are presented
by MHC molecules on the cell surfaces and recognized
by the highly specic T cell receptors TCR Cytotoxic
T cells directly kill virally infected cells after adhesion
while helper T cells help to activate other lymphozytes
eg B cells which produce and secrete antibodies

K-H Lee et al 2002 The nal pattern of an ad-
hering T cell consists of a central domain with bound
TCRMHCp complexes surrounded by a ring-shaped
domain in which the integrin receptors LFA-1 of the
T cell are bound to their ligands ICAM-1 of the APC

tern inversion has been rst observed for T cells adhering
to a supported lipid bilayer with MHCp and ICAM-1
Grakoui et al 1999 Johnson et al 2000 more recently
also in a cell conjugate system K-H Lee et al 2002 In
the case of natural killer NK cells the inverted synapses
seem to be stable Davis et al 1999 Fassett et al 2001
More recently thymozytes immature T cells have been
found to form multifocal synapses with several nearly
circular clusters of TCRMHC-peptide complexes in the
contact zone Hailman et al 2002 Richie et al 2002
As has been proposed by several groups the lateral
segregation or phase separation in the immunological
synapse probably is caused by the length dierence
between receptorligand complexes Davis et al 1996

phase behavior of the membranes is also aected by
the concentrations of the complexes Weikl et al 2002a
Weikl and Lipowsky 2001 Weikl et al 2002b Lateral
phase separation only occurs if the complex concentra-
tions exceed a critical threshold An additional driving
force for phase separation comes from large glycopro-
teins such as CD43 and CD45 Weikl et al 2002b
These glycoproteins have a length of 40 nm and more
Shaw and Dustin 1997 and thus form a steric barrier
for TCRMHCp binding
To understand the time-dependent pattern evolution
it is necessary to consider the dynamics of the phase sep-
aration process in the cell geometry The rst theoreti-
cal model based on a Landau-Ginzburg free energy cou-
pled to a set of reaction-diusion equation has been pro-
posed by Qi Groves and Chakraborty Qi et al 2001
S-J Lee et al 2002 Qi et al obtain circularly sym-
metric adhesion patterns exhibiting the characteristic do-
main inversion and conclude that the entire T cell pattern
evolution may be caused by self-assembly The formation
of the intermediate inverted synapse is suggested to be
formed in a pivot mechanism in which the formation of
LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes in the center of the cell con-
tact zone causes close apposition in the periphery allow-
ing TCRMHCp binding
Here we consider a statistical-mechanical model for
the cell adhesion dynamics in which the T cell and APC
membranes are discretized into small patches of linear
size a  70 nm In this model the congurational energy
of the membranes depends on the numbers of receptors
ligands and glycoproteins present in each patch and the
separation of apposing patches in the cell contact zone
The adhesion dynamics is studied with Monte Carlo sim-
ulations which include the whole range of uctuations in
membrane shape and composition Based on the pat-
terns observed in the simulation we propose a novel
mechanism for the formation of the intermediate inverted
synapse We observe an initial formation of many small
TCRMHCp microclusters throughout the contact zone
Subsequently TCRMHPp clusters at the periphery of
the contact zone grow faster due to the diusion of free
receptors and ligands into this zone For suciently large
TCRMHCp concentrations these peripheral clusters co-
alesce into a closed ring surrounding a central domain of
LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes At smaller TCRMHCp con-
centrations we observe a dierent dynamic regime with
characteristic multifocal intermediate patterns consisting
of several circular TCRMHPp domains which resemble
patterns observed during thymozyte adhesion
Our proposed mechanism for the formation of the in-
termediate inverted T cell synapse is a self-assembly
mechanism based on TCRMHCp microcluster nucle-
ation and the diusion of free receptors and ligands into
the contact zone However we nd that the nal ma-
ture T cell synapse only arises in the presence of active
cytoskeletal transport of TCRs to the center of the con-
tact zone This seems to be in agreement with experimen-
tal ndings Cytochalasin D an inhibitor of actin-based
transport inhibits also the central TCRMHCp move-
ment Grakoui et al 1999 An active actinmyosin-
based transport of receptors into the contact zone has
been observed Wulng and Davis 1998 while the gly-
coprotein CD43 is actively moved out of the contact zone
Allenspach et al 2001 Delon et al 2001 Without ac-
tive transport the intermediate TCRMHCp ring seems
to be metastable and persists for an hour and more ac-
cording to our simulations This might explain the in-
verted synapse of natural killer NK cells which con-
sists of a peripheral ring of short HLA-CKIR complexes

an APC membrane bottom The T cell membrane con-
tains the T cell receptor TCR green and the receptor LFA-1

ands MHCp green and ICAM-1 red Both membranes

ent lengths of bound TCRMHCp complexes LFA-1ICAM-1
complexes and glycoproteins the membrane phase separates
into domains
surrounding a central domain containing the longer LFA-
1ICAM-1 complexes The formation of the inverted NK
synapse is not inhibited by ATP depletion or disruption
of the cytoskeleton and thus appears to be caused by
self-assembly Davis et al 1999 Fassett et al 2001
II MODEL
In this section we describe our theoretical model for
the interaction of a T cell with an antigen-presenting cell
APC We consider two apposing membranes The rst
membrane represents the T cell and contains the recep-
tors TCR and LFA-1 The second membrane represents
the APC and contains the ligands MHCp and ICAM-1
We use the terms receptors and ligands here with re-
spect to the T cell Adhesion molecules anchored in the
T cell membrane are called receptors and those in the
APC membrane are ligands Protruding glycoproteins
are embedded in both membranes forming a steric bar-
rier for the formation of the short TCRMHCp complexes
see Fig 1
To mimick the adhesion geometry of the cells we di-
vide the membranes into a contact zone and a surround-
ing region in which the membranes do not interact The
receptors can diuse in the whole T cell membrane but
interact with the ligands of the APC membrane only
within the contact zone of the two membranes For sim-
plicity we avoid the problem of modeling the full cell
shape and assume here that the contact zone has an es-
sentially circular shape and a constant area on the time
scales considered here see Fig 2 This contact zone is
thought to be established in fast initial adhesion events
after rst cell contact Experimental pictures of adhering
T cells show that the contact zone fully develops in less
than 30 seconds Grakoui et al 1999
To characterize the membrane conformations we par-
tition both membranes into quadratic patches with linear
extension a1 The local composition of the T cell mem-
brane is then described by the numbers nT
i of TCRs nL
of LFA-1 and nGt
of glycoproteins in each membrane

membrane is given by the numbers nM
ICAM-1 and nGa
of glycoproteins in all patches Within
the contact zone the local separation between two appos-
ing membrane patches of the two cells is denoted by li
The elastic energy of the membranes in the contact
zone is dominated by the bending energy and by lateral
tension and can be written as

Here   121  2 denotes the eective bending
rigidity of the two membranes with rigidities 1 and 2
and  is a lateral tension For simplicity the eective
bending rigidity is taken to be independent of the local
membrane composition The term

is the total curvature of the membrane separation eld li
at site i and
dli2  dlxy2  lxay  lxy2  lxay  lxy2
describes the local area increase of the curved mem-
branes with respect to the reference x-y plane given by
li  lxy  0 The elastic energy 1 dominates the uc-
tuations of the membrane separation in the contact zone
whereas the overall cell shape is also aected by the elas-
ticity of the cytoskeleton which is coupled to the mem-
branes In the simulations we use the dimensionless sep-
z  1 to correspond to a length of 20 nm which results
aration eld z  lapkBT  and choose the value
in the relation a  20pkBT  nm for the linear patch
size For the typical rigidities 1  2  25kBT of the
two biomembranes the eective rigidity  has the value
125kBT  and the linear patch size is a  70 nm For
the lateral tension we choose the value   01a2 
2  106Nm
The overall congurational energy of the membranes
in the contact zone is the sum of the elastic energy 1
and the interaction energies of receptors ligands and
glycoproteins

the contact zone

TCR and MHCp molecules at site i This minimum
is equivalent to the number of interacting TCRMHCp
pairs in the apposing patches at site i
The receptor-complexes can only form if the membrane
separation is in an appropriate range The length of
the TCRMHCp complexes is about 15 nm while the
LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes have a length of about 40 nm
Since the membrane within a patch is rough due to the
thermal uctuations on length scales smaller than the lin-
ear extension a  70 nm of the patches we assume that
the complexes can form if the separation of two appos-
ing patches does not deviate more than 5 nm from the
lengths zT M and zLI The interaction potential of TCR
and MHCp is then given by
VT M  UT M for 10 nm  li  20 nm
otherwise
and the interaction potential of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 is
VLI  ULI
for 35 nm  li  45 nm
otherwise
where UT M  0 is the binding energy of a TCRMHCp
complex and ULI  0 the binding energy of LFA-
1ICAM-1 As noted above the potential width of
10 nm eectively takes into account small-scale uctu-
ations within patches Thus this width does not re-
sult from the atomic interaction potentials of receptor
and ligand molecules which should have a signicantly
smaller range Similarly the binding energies of the
receptorligand complexes should be seen as eective
binding energies which can be used to adjust the 2-
dimensional equilibrium constants of the TCRMHCp
and LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes The 2-dimensional equi-
librium constants are approximately given by KT M 
a2eUT M kB T  and KLI  a2eULI kB T  see Ap-
pendix

membranes vary in size However many of these pro-

green patches with bound LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes in red
teins have a length comparable to the length of the LFA-
1ICAM-1 complexes These glycoproteins do not in-
hibit the binding of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 but impose
a steric barrier for the formation of TCRMHCp com-
plexes They are characterized here by the potential

with UG  10a2 and lG  40 nm This potential
results from the fact that a membrane patch of size a
containing a glycoprotein has to bend around this protein
to achieve an overall patch separation smaller than the
length of the glycoprotein
In the following the radius of the circular contact zone
is chosen to be 45a and the nonadhering membrane sur-
rounding the contact zone is a ring of width 55a As
boundary condition at the rim of the contact zone the
membrane separation is xed at a value of 100 nm which
is signicantly larger than the length of the TCR-MHCp
and LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes and the glycoproteins
III ADHESION DYNAMICS IN THE ABSENCE
OF CYTOSKELETAL TRANSPORT PROCESSES
We rst consider the pattern formation in the absence
of active forces which transport molecules in or out of
the contact zone The lateral motion of receptors lig-
ands and glycoproteins within the membranes is then
purely diusive In our discretized membranes the dif-
fusive motion of the macromolecules is modeled as a
hopping process between neighboring membrane patches
Each receptor ligand or glycoprotein in a certain mem-
brane patch can hop to one of the four nearest neighbor
patches during a single time step The hopping processes
of macromolecules located in the nonadhering membrane
region do not change the cell interaction energy eq 2
However within the contact zone the attempted hop-
ping of a macromolecule may change the free energy
According to the standard Metropolis criterion the hop-
ping attempt is always accepted if it does not increase
the free energy but is only accepted with probability
expFkBT  if it leads to a free energy increase
F 2 During a time step we also attempt to shift the
separation li between apposing membrane patches in the
contact zone by d  1 1 where d is the step width
10 nm and 1 1 is a random number between 1 and
A single Monte Carlo step roughly corresponds to 1 ms
of real time This time estimate can be derived from the
2-dimensional diusion law hx2i  4Dt and the typical
diusion constant D  1 m2s for membrane-anchored
macromolecules
In a single Monte Carlo step a free
receptor free ligand or a glycoprotein moves a distance
a to a neighboring membrane patch which corresponds
to a diusion time t  a24D  1 ms for a  70 nm
On the length scale of our patches the diusive motion of
the macromolecules is slower than the relaxation of the
membrane separation Brochard and Lennon 1975 and
hence denes the time scale
These dynamic rules and the free energy given in
2 We reject moves in which bound ligands or receptors hop from
one binding partner to another in a single time step For these
moves the free energy dierence would be zero Thus the ac-
tual free energy barrier for the unbinding process of the lig-
andreceptor complex would not be captured

eq 2 specify a stochastic adhesion process Here
we study the adhesion process with Monte Carlo
simulations
Taking averages over many indepen-
dent Monte Carlo runs gives a numerical solution of
the corresponding master equation van Kampen 1992
Binder and Heermann 1992
The stochastic process
captures the uctuations in the membrane separation
and describes the diusive motion of the receptors lig-
ands and glycoprotein on a single-molecule level which
is essential for the mechanisms of pattern formation con-
sidered in this article As initial conformation we choose
the separation prole l  lo  cr4 where r is the distance
from the center of the contact zone lo is 45 nm and
c  0 is chosen so that the separation at the rim of the
contact zone with radius r  45a is 100 nm boundary
condition This initial separation in the contact zone is
larger than 45 nm and thus beyond the interaction range
of receptors ligands and glycoproteins Initially these
molecules are taken to be randomly distributed within
the whole membrane
We systematically study the adhesion dynamics for
various concentrations of the receptors ligands and gly-
coproteins and for various eective binding energies or
2d equilibrium constants of the TCRMHCp and LFA-
1ICAM-1 complexes Since the length dierence of the
complexes leads to phase separation at the molecular
concentrations considered here the two types of recep-
torligand complexes have to compete for the contact
In general the overall area of TCRMHCp do-
mains in the contact zone increases with the concentra-
tions of TCR and MHCp molecules and with the eective
binding energy UT M  However if the molecular concen-
trations or the binding energy are too small TCRMHCp
domains do not form and the contact zone contains only
bound LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes At molecular concen-
trations and binding energies where TCRMHCp and
LFA-1ICAM-1 domains coexist we observe two dier-
ent regimes for the dynamics with clearly distinct pat-
terns of TCRMHCp domains at intermediate times
The pattern evolution roughly depends on the overall
area of TCRMHCp domains after initial relaxation
Regime 1 If the overall area of TCRMHCp domains
is relatively large we observe a characteristic ring-shaped
TCRMHCp domain at intermediate times surrounding
a central domain of LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes A typ-
ical example for the pattern evolution in this regime is
presented in Fig 3 The rst Monte Carlo snapshots
of the contact zone show the formation of many small
TCRMHCp microclusters At later times the clusters
close to the rim of the contact zone grow faster and form
an intermediate peripheral TCRMHCp ring The faster
growth of the clusters close to the rim is caused by the
diusion of unbound TCR and MHCp molecules from
the nonadhering membrane into the contact zone Fi-
nally the ring breaks to form a single large TCRMHCp
domain
Regime 2 For smaller TCR or MHCp concentrations
or smaller eective binding energy we observe charac-
teristic multifocal TCRMHCp patterns at intermediate
times A typical example is shown in Fig 4 Initially we
observe again the nucleation of many TCRMHCp micro-
clusters throughout the contact zone However the over-
all area of TCRMHCp domains now is not large enough
for the formation of a TCRMHCp ring
Instead mi-
croclusters in the whole contact zone grow and coalesce
which leads to multifocal intermediates and nally again
to a single TCRMHCp domain
To distinguish the two dynamic regimes systematically
we consider a peripheral ring of the contact zone with
distances r  35a from the center and divide this ring
into 100 equal segments For each Monte Carlo pattern
obtained during adhesion we determine the fraction Y
of ring segments which contain bound TCRMHCp com-
plexes A fully closed peripheral TCRMHCp ring corre-
sponds to a ring occupation Y  100  We nd that the
crossover between the two dynamic regimes can be ap-
propriately described by a maximum ring occupation of
Y max  80  attained during adhesion A pattern evolu-
tion with Y max  80  typically has multifocal interme-
diates as in Fig 4 Regime 2 while pattern evolutions
with Y max  80 exhibit the inverted synapse of T cells
with peripheral TCRMHCp ring see Fig 3 Regime 1
The diagram at the top of Fig 5 shows how the dy-
namic regimes for pattern formation depend on the eec-
tive binding energies UT M and ULI of the TCRMHCp
and LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes These binding energies

tom diagram the binding energy ULI of LFA-1ICAM-1 com-
plexes has the value 3kBT  The black diamonds in the gure
represent data points obtained from Monte Carlo simulations
At large values of the binding energy UT M of the TCRMHCp
complexes we observe a peripheral TCRMHCp ring at inter-
mediated times as in Fig 3 Regime 1 At medium values of
UT M  multifocal patterns as in Fig 4 are obtained at interme-
diate times Regime 2 At small values of UT M  TCRMHCp
domains in the contact zone do not form The threshold for
the formation of TCRMHCp domains and the crossover be-
tween the two dynamic regimes depend on the binding energy
ULI of LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes and the glycoprotein con-
centration XG in both membranes
FIG 6 Two possible patterns with a single TCRMHCp do-
main shown in green In the left pattern the TCRMHCp
domain only has boundaries with the red LFA-1ICAM-1 do-
In the right pattern the TCRMHCp domain is in
contact with the rim of the contact zone
are proportional to the logarithm of the ideal 2d equi-
librium constants of the complexes see Appendix An
increase in UT M in general leads to more TCRMHCp
complexes in the contact zone while an increase in ULI
leads to the binding of more LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes
We observe three dierent scenarios i At small values
of UT M  TCRMHCp domains do not form at all in the
contact zone which then is completely occupied by LFA-
1ICAM-1 complexes TCRMHCp domains only form
above a threshold value for UT M  This threshold value
increases with ULI ii At large values of UT M  we ob-
serve Regime 1 of pattern formation with the characteris-
tic peripheral ring of TCRMHCp complexes as in Fig 3
iii At intermediate values UT M  we nd the patterns of
Regime 2 with characteristic multifocal intermediates as
in Fig 4 The crossover value of UT M separating Regime
1 and Regime 2 increases with ULI The intermediate
TCRMHCp ring of Regime 1 only forms if suciently
large numbers of TCRMHCp complexes are present in
the contact zone Instead of varying the eective bind-
ing energies UT M and ULI  the numbers of bound recep-
torligand complexes in the contact zone could also be
changed by varying the overall concentrations of the re-
ceptors and ligands with similar eects on the pattern
formation
The diagram at the bottom of Fig 5 shows the eect
of the glycoprotein concentration XG on the adhesion
dynamics The length of the glycoproteins is compatible
with the length of the LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes Hence
the glycoproteins can enter the red LFA-1ICAM-1 do-
mains in the contact zone but are excluded from the
green TCRMHCp domains The accessible membrane
area for the glycoproteins increases with the fraction of
LFA-1ICAM-1 domains in the contact zone and so does
the entropy of the glycoprotein distribution Therefore
an increase in the overall glycoprotein concentrations
leads to a larger fraction of red LFA-1ICAM-1 domains
in the contact zone and thus has a similar eect as in-
creasing the binding energy ULI of the LFA-1ICAM-1
complexes
In both dynamic regimes of pattern formation the co-
alescence of clusters nally leads to a single TCRMHCp
domain in our model In the absence of active transport
processes we always observe that the nal TCRMHCp
domain is in contact with the rim of the contact zone see

FIG 7 Pattern formation with active transport of TCRs towards the center of the contact zone Membrane patches with
bound TCRMHCp complexes are shown in green patches with LFA-1ICAM-1 complexes in red Molecular concentrations
and binding energies are the same as in Fig 3 ring regime Top At zero force the intermediate TCRMHCp pattern is
stable for 30 minutes and more In the nal equilibrium pattern both types of domains are in contact with the rim of the
adhesion region see section III Middle At the force F  001kB T a the nal equilibrium state is the target-shaped mature
synapse of T cells This state is already established within 30 minutes Bottom At the 10-fold stronger force F  01 kBT a
the nal target-shaped pattern already forms within 5 to 10 minutes An intermediate pattern with a TCRMHCp ring appears
around 30 seconds after initial contact
Figs 3 and 4 This behavior can be understood from the
line tensions at the domain boundaries and at the rim of
the contact zone The line tension between TCRMHCp
and LFA-1ICAM-1 domains  is an energy per unit
length of the domain boundaries and is mainly caused by
the elastic energy of the membanes within the boundary
regions between the domains At the boundary the mem-
branes are bent to connect a TCRMHCp domain with
a membrane separation of around 15 nm with an LFA-
1ICAM-1 domain with a separation of around 40 nm
Similar line tensions or energies per length arise at the
rim of the contact zone both for TCRMHCp and LFA-
1ICAM-1 domains adjacent to the rim which we de-
note here by T M and LI  Of special interest here is
the dierence r  T M  LI  the energy per length
for replacing an LFA-1ICAM-1 boundary at the rim of
the contact zone by a TCRMHCp boundary While 
is always positive reecting the phase separation r in
principle can have both positive and negative sign 3
Let us assume that the nal TCRMHCp domain has
a smaller area than the LFA-1ICAM-1 domain which
seems to be the case for T cells If r is larger than 
boundaries of TCRMHCp domains inside the contact
zone with the LFA-1ICAM-1 domain are energetically
more favorable than boundaries at the rim Hence the
nal TCRMHCp domain should be circular and located
anywhere inside the contact zone to minimize the overall
line tension see Fig 6 In contrast if  is larger than r
TCRMHCp domain boundaries at the rim of the contact
zone are more favorable than interior boundaries and
the nal TCRMHCp domain should be in contact with
the rim In our simulations  is clearly larger than r
although r is positive since our boundary conditions a
rim separation of 100 nm favor LFA-1ICAM-1 domains
at the egde of the contact zone In the case of cells it
is reasonable to assume that  is much larger than r
since separation dierences between 15 and 40 nm at the
edge of the contact zone should not cause large energetic
dierences in the cell elasticity

we assume that each TCR molecule experiences a con-
stant force which is directed towards the center of the
contact zone midpoint This force corresponds to an ad-
ditional term F  r in the congurational energy of each
TCR where F is the magnitude of the force and r the
distance of the receptor from the center of the contact
zone Under the inuence of this force diusive steps
bringing TCRs closer to focal point of the cytoskeleton
in the center of the contact are in general more likely
than diusive steps in the opposite direction
Figure 7 compares the pattern evolution at zero force
with patterns at the forces F  001kBT a  6  1016 N
and F  01kBT a  6  1015 N The concentrations
and binding energies are the same as in Fig 3 For these
values the force F  001kBT a is close to the force
threshold leading to a target-shaped nal synapse with
central TCRMHCp cluster see Fig 8 Besides lead-
ing to a central TCRMHCp cluster the active forces
speed up the pattern evolution At the weaker force
F  001kBT a the nal equilibrium state is reached af-
ter approximately 30 minutes while the 10-fold stronger
force F  01kBT a leads to equilibrium within few
minutes The absolute times are based on the estimate
that one Monte Carlo step roughly corresponds to 1 ms
see above However TCRMHCp rings at intermediate
times form in all three cases shown in Fig 7 Only sig-
nicantly stronger forces prohibit the formation of inter-
mediate rings by pulling the TCRs more directly to the
center of the contact zone
To quantify the impact of the active forces on the pat-
tern evolution we consider again the peripheral ring oc-
cupation Y of the TCRMHCp complexes see Fig 8
Values Y  80  at intermediate times indicate a periph-
eral TCRMHCp ring as in the inverted T cell synapse
and values Y  0  at later times correspond to target-
shaped patterns with a central TCRMHCp domain as in
the mature T cell synapse We consider the same molec-
ular concentrations and binding energies as in the Figs 3
and 7 For these values active forces F  0003kBT a
are too weak to cause a nal central TCRMHCp clus-
ter while forces F  01kBT a guide the TCRs very
quickly to the contact zone center which prevents the
formation of a peripheral TCRMHCp ring at interme-
diate times We obtain a T-cell like pattern evolution
for forces 001kBT a  F  01kBT a with an inter-
time seconds
FIG 8 TCRMHCp ring occupation Y at various forces
F  f  kBT a as a function of time t for the same molec-
ular concentrations as in Figs 3 and 7 A ring occupation
Y  100  corresponds to fully closed peripheral ring of
TCRMHCp complexes smaller percentages of Y correspond
to partial occupations of the peripheral ring with distances
r  35 a from the center of the contact zone T-cell like
pattern evolution with intermediate values of Y  80 
inverted synapse and nal values of Y  0  mature
synapse are obtained for forces between F  001kB T a and
F  01kB T a see also Fig 7 Larger forces prevent the for-
mation of an intermediate peripheral TCRMHCp ring while
smaller forces do not lead to a nal central TCRMHCp clus-
ter The data points represent averages over 24 independent
Monte Carlo runs for each force
mediate inverted synapse and a nal mature synapse
exhibiting a central TCRMHCp cluster Experimen-
tally the mature synapse of T cells has been observed
to form on timescales between 5 and 30 minutes which
agrees with the equilibration times we obtain for these
forces
In the absence of active forces F  0 the
intermediate peripheral TCRMHCp ring seems to be
metastable and appears in our simulations for times up
to an hour This metastability might explain the inverted
NK cell synapse which consists of a peripheral ring of
short receptorligand complexes and a central domain
containing the longer integrins The inverted synapse
of NK cells seems to formed by self-assembly since it is
not aected by ATP depletion or cytoskeletal inhibitors
Davis et al 1999 Fassett et al 2001
V CONCLUSIONS
In this article we have considered possible mechanisms
underlying the pattern formation during T cell adhesion
We propose a novel mechanism for the formation of in-
termediate patterns which is based on the nucleation of
TCRMHCp microdomains throughout the contact zone
and the diusion of free receptors and ligands into this
zone This self-assembly mechanism does not require
active processes and leads to the inverted synapse pat-
tern of T cells if the TCRMHCp concentration is large
enough The mechanism leads to multifocal intermedi-
ates as observed during thymozyte adhesion for smaller
TCRMHCp concentrations
According to our model the nal T cell pattern with
a central TCRMHPp domain is caused by active trans-
port of TCRs towards the center of the contact zone
where the polarized cytoskeleton has a focal point This
seems to be in agreement with experiments which show
that the central TCRMHCp movement is inhibited by
blocking the active cytoskeletal transport with Cytocha-
lasin D Grakoui et al 1999
In our model the coalescense of domains eventually
leads to a single TCRMHCp domain Without active
transport we nd that this domain is located at the rim
of the contact zone We obtain the nal bull-eye pat-
tern of the mature synapse with a central TCRMHCp
domain only in the presence of active TCR transport
For simplicity we have modeled the active transport by
a constant average force F which acts on the TCRs and
is directed towards to the center of the contact zone We
obtain the characteristic pattern inversion of T cells for
average forces in the range 6  1016 N  F  6  1015 N
Smaller average forces do not lead to the mature T cell
synapse with central TCRMHCp cluster while larger
forces disrupt the peripheral TCRMHCp ring of the in-
termediate inverted synapse It is important to note that
these average forces acting on a single TCR are signi-
cantly smaller than the maximum forces around 1 pN
1012 N which can be exerted by a single molecular mo-
tor The transport of a TCR molecule over larger dis-
tances presumably involves several cytoskeletal binding
and unbinding events Since the TCRs are membrane-
anchored the transport along cytoskeletal bers close to
the membrane may also be aected by additional friction
within the membrane
Active cytoskeletal processes could also stabilize the
multifocal patterns of thymozytes which have been ob-
served by Hailman et al The cytoskeleton of thymozytes
presumably remains in a mobile nonpolarized state
which still allows cell migration Hailman et al 2002
The few TCRMHCp clusters of thymozytes may be
coupled to the cytoskeleton thus following its move-
ments An alternative explanation for the multifocal
patterns has been given in terms of critical uctuations
S-J Lee et al 2003 Raychaudhuri et al Fluctuations
close to a critical point can lead to the appearance and
disappearance of small domains since the line tension of
the domain boundaries then is low However the few
small TCRMHCp clusters observed bei Hailman et al
are rather circular which indicates a relatively large line
tension
In addition the multifocal patterns were ob-
served over a 100-fold range of antigen concentrations
Hailman et al 2002 whereas critical uctuations can
only be observed in a rather narrow concentration range
close to the critical point
complexes and a central domain with the longer LFA-
1ICAM-1 complexes The formation of the NK cell
synapse seems not to depend on active cytoskeletal pro-
cesses since ATP depletion or disruption of the cy-
toskeleton has no eect on the pattern Davis et al 1999
Fassett et al 2001 A possible explanation for the NK
cell synapse is the metastability of the inverted pattern in
the absence of active cytoskeletal processes Without ac-
tive transport the inverted intermediate synapse persists
up to an hour in our model As mentioned above exper-
iments show that the central TCRMHCp movement of
T cells requires cytoskeletal transport as well
We have applied our model here to T cell adhesion
using the specic lengths of the TCRMHCp and ICAM-
1LFA-1 complexes in the interaction potentials 3 and
4 However the model is rather general and also applies
to other cell adhesion events We have previously consid-
ered a simpler membrane system with stickers and re-
pellers Weikl et al 2002a The phase separation into
sticker- and repeller-rich domains is driven by the length
dierence between the two molecule types
In the cell
adhesion geometry we obtained intermediate patterns
which are similar to those presented here A dierence
to T cell membranes is that the repeller-rich domains are
unbound Large-scale membrane uctuations in these
domains then drive the nal sticker clusters towards the
center of the contact zone at least for the free bound-
ary conditions with unconstrained membrane separation
at the contact zone rim Weikl et al 2002a In contrast
the coexisting TCRMHCp and ICAM-1LFA-1 domain
types of T cells are both bound and large-scale mem-
brane uctuations are suppressed
We have characterized the receptorligands by an ef-
fective binding energy which is directly related to an ef-
fective 2D equilibrium constant K2D see Appendix The
equilibrium constant K2D is the ratio of the kinetic on-
and o-rates kon and kof f for the receptor-ligand bind-
ing Bell 1978 Characterising the binding kinetics by
the single parameter K2D rather than the two parame-
ters kon and kof f is justied at least if the on-reaction
of a receptor-ligand pair in apposing membrane patches
of our discrete model is faster than the timescale 1 ms
for the diusive Monte Carlo steps In general such an
approach may also be justied by a local equilibration
within domains
APPENDIX A BINDING ENERGIES AND 2D
EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTS
In this appendix we consider the relation between the
2d equilibrium constants and the binding energies of re-
ceptors and ligands with square-well potentials 3 or 4
The 2d equilibrium constants are dened by
Natural killer NK cells form an inverted synapse
consisting of a peripheral ring of short HLA-CKIR
where xR is the area concentration of receptors R in one
of the membranes xL is the area concentration of the
REFERENCES
ligands L in the apposing membrane and xRL is the con-
centration of the complexes In general K2d depends on
the state of the membrane not only on the interaction
potential of receptors and ligands For example if the
membrane separation is to large to allow complex forma-
tion the equilibrium constant A1 is zero In a bound
state K2d will depend on the separation and roughness
of the membrane which in turn are aected by the con-
centrations of the receptors ligands and steric repellers
such as glycoproteins Here we only consider the ideal
2d equilibrium constant for a membrane segment which is
entirely within the binding range of the receptorligand
square-well interaction
For convenience we choose in the following the grand-
canonical ensemble with chemical potentials R and L
for receptors and ligands However the ideal 2d equilib-
rium constant derived below will be independent of R
and L and thus applies also to the canonical ensemble
with xed overall receptor and ligand concentrations
Let us consider two apposing membrane patches within
binding range of the receptors R and ligands L A state
of these apposing patches is characterized by the numbers
mL and mR of ligands and receptors present in the two
membranes The congurational energy is hmL mR 
URL minmL mR  LmL  RmR where URL is the
binding energy of RL complexes To simplify the nota-
tion below the parameters R L and URL are taken
to be in units of the thermal energy kBT 
In a given
state there can be k bound RL complexes plus either i
uncomplexed ligands or j uncomplexed receptors or no
additional uncomplexed molecules The partition func-
tion then has the form
