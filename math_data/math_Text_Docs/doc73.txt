Abstract
The energy source of the radiation in UnruhHawking process is investigated with emphasis on the
particle number denition based on conservation laws It has been shown that the particle radiation is not
the result of pair creation by the gravitational force but the result of dierence in the conservation laws to
dene the particle number The origin of the radiated energy in the distant future corresponds to the zero
point oscillations with innitely large wave numbers This result implies the need of reconsideration on
the scenario of black hole evaporation
Introduction
The theory of quantum particle radiation by gravitational force 1 2 is generally accepted as well established
however several authors pointed out essential problems that might brow up the whole story 3 4 5 see
6 for a review What called trans-Plankian problem has been known from very early years 7 In the last
two decades this problem has been investigated intensively 8 9
The derivation of HawkingUnruh process is based on so called cis-Plankian physics ie the theories
of gravitation and quantum eld we know at the present It is believed these theories will break down
beyond an extremely small scale the Plank scale presumably and we do not know what happens there The
unknown physics in that scale is called trans-Plankian physics The calculation of HawkingUnruh eect
inevitably requires the wave modes with innitesimally small wave length see eg 6 therefore we
need to know the trans-Plankian physics to understand the radiation mechanism this is the trans-Plankian
problem There has been attempts 9 to derive the radiation within the cis-Plankian scale however they
are based on ad hoc assumptions yet to be tested experimentally
Helfer 4 pointed out another issue we have to consider before the trans-Plankian problem The radiation
at later times must have plied up near the horizon at the time of black hole formation and its backreaction
is far from negligible to the black hole metric This implies the theory of Hawking radiation is intrinsically
inconsistent even within the framework of cis-Plankian physics because such backreaction may completely
destroy the black hole formation
This is a serious problem Papers on the trans-Plankian problem so far assume that the Hawking
radiation is well predicted by the cis-Plankian physics and discuss what will happen if we have to consider
trans-Plankian eects However if cis-Plankian physics itself fails to derive the Hawking radiation then
we do not have any reason to believe the existence of radiation
The purpose of the present paper is to formulate the Helfers conclusion 4 from a dierent point of view
We wish to show the theory of black hole evaporation is inconsistent even if the cis-Plankian physics is valid
up to innitesimally small scale To this end we need another unknown physics within the cis-Plankian
regime the eect of the zero-point oscillation to the gravity We do not know the general theory for this
however there can be two possibilities for the Hawking radiation
One is such that the radiation can carry away the black hole energy to cause its evaporation In this case
the backreaction of the quantum led is so large as to alter the black hole formation completely 4 We will
see in the present paper there can be another possibility that the eld has no backreaction to the black hole
geometry In this case however there will be no black hole evaporation at all even with the existence of
Hawking radiation This may be plausible because there are considerable amount of observational evidence
to believe the existence of black holes
We take an approach a little dierent from the conventional quantization with creationannihilation
operators in the present paper the mathematical structure is equivalent but its interpretation is not the
same The quantization with creationannihilation operators takes two dierent steps transition from the
classic to quantum eld and introduction of the particle picture namely at the same time The essential step
in the canonical quantization method is to replace a classical Poisson bracket with a quantum commutation
relation regarding the eld as a collection of quantum operators
If conserved quantities have discrete
eigenvalues with equal intervals then we can construct the particle picture It is well known the latter is
not always possible in a curved spacetime
It also should be noted these two steps do not have to be done at the same place even when we have the
particle picture The commutation relation must be given on a Chaucy surface on which the Poisson bracket
is dened The particle picture in contrast does not have to be on the same surface It can be on some other
spacelike surface which does not have to be a Chaucy surface as long as there exist some conservation laws
In the present paper the essential quantization ie denition of the commutation relation will be done
on the surface of constant time in MinkowskiKruscal coordinates Then the particle picture is introduced
based on that quantization not only on the same surface but also on the surface of constant time in
RindlerSchwarzschild coordinates
The particle picture is based on conservation laws in general What we directly measure is not the
particle number itself but some conserved quantity such as energy or electric charge We imagine there
are n particles each of which carries a certain amount of conserved quantity if the total of the quantity has
discrete values proportional to an integer n
This means the concept of particle number is dened by conserved quantities If all the conserved
quantities share the same n then we can dene one unique particle number however this is not the case
There can be several dierent denitions of particle numbers because there can be several dierent Killing
vector elds that determine the conservation laws in a relativistic spacetime
Consequently one physical state can have dierent particle numbers and this is what is happening in
the UnruhHawking process Particles are not created in the literal meaning of creation which means the
particle number increases as time goes on Rather what takes place is just a dierence of particle numbers
caused by the dierence in their denitions This is in agreement with the result of Belinski 3 calculated
from another viewpoint
We will see in the present paper the radiation of particles comes from the vacuum state ie zero particle
state of another kind of particle number This is possible because a vacuum is not a completely empty
space but has zero point oscillations The continuous particle radiation can take place because the zero point
oscillations exist up to innitely large wave numbers which means innite amount of energy source
The present paper is organized in the following In section 2 we rst review some basic concepts to
clarify the procedure of quantization used in the later sections We examine in Section 3 the case of Unruh
process in a at spacetime since it has the two dierent types of conservation laws clearly dened we can
understand the problem with this simple analogy We apply the results obtained in Section 3 to the case of
Schwarzschild black holes in Section 4 and a brief summary is given in Section 5
2 Basics
21 Time and Energy
The concept of energy is often used in a sloppy way which sometimes leads to misconceptions The
integration of the energy-momentum tensor cannot be carried out in the curved spacetime in general
however there can be well dened energy as a globally conserved quantity if there exists a Killing vector
eld If a Killing vector  is timelike then the integration R Td T energy-momentum tensor
over an appropriate spacelike surface  is conserved with respect to the time evolution in  If there are
several dierent timelike Killing vector elds there can be the same number of corresponding energies the
energies dened by dierent Killing vector elds are dierent physical entities
Sometimes this dierence in energies is not well understood and causes confusion one good example
is an intuitive explanation of the Hawking radiation found in popular science books It goes like 1 a
vacuum is not an empty space but lled with instantaneous pair production of virtual particles 2 a pair
of virtual particles can exist within a short time period of t  E because of the uncertain principle
3 when such virtual particles are created near the event horizon one of the pair may fall into the black
hole across the horizon during the time interval of t 4 once a virtual particle crosses the horizon its
energy becomes negative 5 then the other particle of the pair can have positive energy without violating
the energy conservation law
This explanation does not specify the Killing vector eld with which the time and energy are dened If
the Killing vector is something like the Schwarzschild time then a particle takes innitely long time to reach
the horizon and cannot cross the horizon during the period of t If on the other hand the Killing vector
is such that a particle can cross the horizon within a nite period then the corresponding energy does not
change the sign on the other side of the horizon The pair production near the horizon is not likely to occur
to cause the Hawking radiation in both cases
22 Conservation Laws and Particle Numbers
Usually the quantization process to investigate HawkingUnruh process is based on the creationannihilation
operators dened by the negativepositive frequency modes In the present paper we take one step back-
wards and perform the quantization by replacing the Poisson bracket with the commutation relation Here-
after let us use the word quantization with the meaning of the transition from the classical to quantum
theory and does not necessarily mean the particle picture
The particle picture is derived from conserved quantities after the quantization If the quantum observ-
able of a conserved quantity has the structure of a harmonic oscillator its eigenvalues are proportional to
2 is subtracted out by normal ordering thus the quantity
is proportional to n When there are several conserved quantities that share the same n for the same state
then we can interpret n as the particle number
2 with n  0 1 2     Usually the constant 1
Suppose we establish quantization somehow and nd an observable a hat mark indicates a quantum
operator and its Hermite conjugate a have the following commutation relation
We use the unit system with G    c  1 throughout the present paper The general theory of quantum
harmonic oscillators tells us see eg 10 an observable dened as
 a a  a a  a a  1 
has the eigenstates nAi that satises
2 cid16 a a  a acid17
AnAi  A0cid18n 
2cid19nAi  n  0 1 2      
if a has the commutation relation of 1
For the above argument the observable A does not have to be related to the Hamiltonian explicitly note
the Poisson bracket has something to do with the Hamiltonian implicitly and there can be several choices
for such observables For example if we dene a new observable b as
b   a   a
2  nBi and vice versa
with 2  2  1 then it also satises the commutation relation like 1 and thus B  1
has the eigenvalues B0n  1
AnBi  n  1
Both pairs a a and b b have the structure of annihilationcreation operators however it is not enough
for the particle picture To construct the particle picture with a and a A must obey a conservation law in
time ie  At  0 here we employ the Heisenberg picture at least approximately If A rapidly changes
even without interactions so does n and it is not appropriate to regard n as a particle number
It is easy to conrm its eigenstates nBi are not the eigenstates of
2 B0b b  b b
A ie
When the Hamiltonian does not depend on time explicitly the condition of  At  0 is equivalent to
the following commutation relation
 A H  0 
Obviously the Hamiltonian itself satises this condition therefore the Hamiltonian is usually used to
introduce the particle picture Then the operators a and a become the amplitudes of wave modes with
positive and negative frequencies respectively which are usually used in the procedure of quantization
as the annihilation and creation operators Therefore the mathematical structure in the present paper is
equivalent to the one in the conventional method
If there are other conserved observables with respect to the time t then they share the same set of
eigenstates with the Hamiltonian H because of the commutation relation 5 Therefore n can be regarded
as the particle number without specifying the conserved quantities as long as the conservation laws are on
the same time evolution of t Especially the ground sate of the observables is uniquely determined and we
call it vacuum We can dene the number operator as
N  a a
whose eigenvalue is the particle number n and the vacuum means the eigenstate with n  0
However in relativistic spacetimes there can be several dierent types of time evolution with dierent
sets of conservation laws because several dierent Killing vector elds can exist the Minkowski and Rindler
times in a at spacetime are a good example
If two dierent types of time evolution have their own conservation laws then the conserved quantities
that belong to dierent time evolution may have dierent sets of eigenstates Consequently the ground
state in one time evolution is not the ground state in another in other words they have dierent vacuum
states This is what causes HawkingUnruh radiation as we will see in the next section
3 Unruh process
31 Minkowski Coordinates
Suppose the following real valued Klein-Goldon equation in a two dimensional Minkowski spacetime
where t and x are the time and space coordinates
tt  xx  0 
We write t  t etc in shorthand We take the Cauchy surface for the canonical dynamics as the one
dened with t  constant then the Hamiltonian may be written as
H  Z 
tt x  2
xt xi dx 
We expand the eld as
with mode functions
x t  Z ak uk x t  ak uk x t dk 
uk x t 
4
eitikx 
where   k and the asterisk indicates complex conjugate Precisely speaking ak diverges to innity
as we usually encounter in the Fourier transform we assume some appropriate prescription such as the
distributionhyperfunction formulation has been applied to avoid this diculty in this paper
The essential transition from the classical to the quantum eld is done by replacing ak and ak with
the operators satisfying the commutation relation of
h ak aki  ak ak  ak ak  k  k 
The above quantization is based on the Cauchy surface of t  constant
It should be noted that the
quantization in this paper takes place only once at this point Later we introduce the particle picture on the
surface of constant Rindler time but it is expressed by a linear superposition of a and a and based on the
commutation relation dened here
The Hamiltonian 8 can be expressed as a collection of quantum harmonic oscillators
H  Z 
2 h ak ak  ak aki dk 
Therefore we can dene the particle number as explained in the previous section and ground sate of H is
called vacuum
Now that we have the quantized operators ak and ak we can calculate the eld x t at any point
of the spacetime as a quantum observable Any classical quantity dened from the classical eld  can be
quantized by replacing
    Z h ak uk x t  ak uk x ti dk 
32 Rindler Coordinates
The Hamiltonian H in 8 is the energy with the conservation law based the Killing vector eld of Minkowski
time t We examine in the following another conservation law resulting from another Killing vector eld
xt  tx where  is a real constant that corresponds to the relativistic acceleration The energy M for this
Killing vector eld is written in the classical eld theory as
M  Z
t2  x2 cid16t2
x  x2
tcid17 d 
where  is a surface specied by tx  tanh and x  0 Clearly M is not the same quantity as H
therefor let us distinguish M and H by calling them Rindler energy and Minkowski energy respectively
The density of the Rindler energy is conserved locally and there is no Rindler energy ow across the
left and right Rindler wedges thus we have M  0 once we calculate M on a surface  with a given
 then the result holds for all  When we choose   0 we can express M with the coecients ak of the
Minkowski modes Since M is quadratic in  we can write
M   Ak k ak ak  Bk k ak ak  Ck k ak ak dk dk 
with coecients A B and C that do not depend on  or t
The above quantity is quantized by replacing ak  ak and ak  ak as
M   cid20A ak ak 
2 cid16 ak ak  ak akcid17  C ak akcid21 dk dk 
As noted before this quantization is based on the Cauchy surface of t  constant not  Therefore 
does not have to be a Cauchy surface
What we wish to show in the following is that the particle numbers dened by M and H are not the
same Before that we have to show that M surely can dene the particle number Suppose an operator b is
dened as a linear superposition of a and a as
bp  Z hp k ak  p k aki dk 
If b satises the commutation relation
and M can be expressed with b as
bp bp  p  p 
2 Z hbp bp  bp bpi dp 
then we can dene the particle number with M in the similar way as done in the previous subsection with
It is possible show the above two equations with direct calculation however it is easier to use the
following Rindler coordinates   for the right Rindler wedge ie region of x  0 xt
Then the Rindler energy M may be written as
t   sinh x   cosh 
M  Z 
We introduce the eigenfunctions
 cid16 2
  22 2
cid17 d 
vp   
4
expi  i1p ln 
with   p The wave function  can be expanded in the right Rindler wedge as
  Z hbp vp  bp vpi dp 
then M in 21 can be cast into 19 In this context  and  in 17 are equivalent to the Bogolubov coecients
that satisfy
Z cid2p1 kp2 k  p1 kp2 kcid3 dk  p1  p2 
The above property combined with 11 yields the commutation relation of 18 therefore we can dene
particle numbers with M
What we do next is to compare the eigenstates of M and H From 16 it is clear that M and H do not share
the same set of eigenstates unless A and C vanishes We can see from 17 and 15 that A and C vanished
when   0 however  can be evaluated by a straightforward integration see eg 11 resulting
cid12cid12cid12
p kcid12cid12cid12
e2  1
Therefore the eigenstates of M are not the eigenstates of H This means that the ground state of H is not the
M which can be stated in other words as a vacuum dened by the Minkowski energy is
ground state of
not a vacuum dened by the Rindler energy The expected value of the particle number dened by Rindler
energy we call Rindler particle number hereafter in the Minkowski vacuum can be calculated using 25
resulting the well known Plankian distribution 11
What we have seen above is not surprising since dierent operators may have dierent sets of eigenstates
However it contradicts with the picture of the pair production by the gravitational force often found
in intuitive explanations like the one in Section 2 The particle number dened by Minkowski energy
Minkowski particle number hereafter is zero for all t and the Rindler particle number has the xed
Plankian distribution for all  This is consistent with the time symmetry the vacuum in the at spacetime
must be symmetric in time both in t and  but the particle creation process is not symmetric
33 Origin of the Radiation
The Rindler particle number in the Unruh process is calculated by the expected value of the Rindler energy
for the ground state of the Minkowski energy ie h0H M0Hi If the vacuum were a completely empty
space ie a0Hi  a 0Hi  0 then h0H M0Hi would vanish However this is not true since the quantum
ground state has zero point oscillation and hence h0H M0Hi  0 This means the particles found in the
Unruh process comes from the zero point oscillation of the Minkowski modes
Then what we wish to know is the properties of zero point oscillations that contribute to the continuous
radiation of Rindler energy In the present paper we concentrate on right moving waves ie k  0 or
p  0 since their analog in the Schwarzschild spacetime play the key role in the black hole evaporation It
should be noted however left moving waves are also problematic and should be examined in the next step
We rst examine the properties of waves in the classical limit and then apply the result to the quantum
To begin with we observe that the a eigenmode 22 has innite Rindler energy in a nite region of
0    c with arbitrary position c in the right Rindler wedge this can be conrmed by the following
direct integration
0Z c
 cid16 v2
  22 v2
cid17 d   
Also it is easy to conrm there is a constant rightward outux of the Rindler energy at   c by direct
calculation This outux comes from the region of 0    c but the total Rindler energy can be conserved
because the amount of the Rindler energy in that region is innitely large Belinski 3 considered this fact
as physically unacceptable and concluded the radiation results from vp is just a mathematical illusion
The present paper takes a dierent interpretation The innite Rindler energy can be physically real as
long as we believe zero point oscillations exist for any high frequency modes because the collection of such
oscillations has innitely large Rindler energy even in a nite volume
To see this we examine the behavior of the a wave packet in the following form cc means complex
conjugate
   exp   e 02
e s02
 expi  i1p ln  cc 
This wave packet was initially localized around   0 with width s0 at   0 and propagates rightward The
width of the packet becomes larger and the wave number becomes smaller as a result of wave propagation
The wave packet can be expanded by the Minkowski modes uk t x as
t x  Z h uk uk t x   uk uk t xi dk
with the Klein-Goldon inner products 1 2 which can be calculated at t    0 as
1 2  Z h1t2  12tit0
When s  0 ln0 then we can approximate
  12
   exp

where s1  s0 e and 1  0 e are the width and center of the wave packet at a time  Using the above
approximation we obtain
t x 
s0 
exphi1p ln0iZ eik0 exphs2
0k  p02i eitikxdk  cc
from 28 with 29 The above expression means that the wave packet comes from the Minkowski modes
with wave number around k0  p0 when s0  0p
Suppose we nd a wave packet around 1 at a given time   1  0 in the Rindler space then its position
at   0 was 0  1 e1 therefore the packet consists of the Minkowski modes with k  k0  p e10
When we regard the wave eld at   1 as a superposition of such wave packets we see that the waves in the
region of 0    1 at   1 consists of Minkowski modes with wave numbers larger than k0  p e10
Since k0   in the limit of 1   we understand the Rindler energy radiation at the distant future in
 comes from the Minkowski modes with innitely large wave numbers The Rindler coordinates represent
an observer with constant acceleration and the relative velocity of the accelerating observer to the rest frame
becomes innitely large in the limit of    Waves with nite wave numbers in this limit are innitely
red shifted therefore its original wave number must have been innitely large
Now let us apply the above observation to quantum vacua to see the origin of the Rindler particles
Suppose the quantum state is Minkowski vacuum ie the ground state of the Minkowski energy Then
the state has zero point oscillation up to innitely large wave numbers Usually the energy of these zero
point oscillation is subtracted out by normal ordering and we regard there is no particle in the ground state
However the ground state of the Minkowski energy is not the ground state of the Rindler energy which
means the existence of the Rindler particles The continuous radiation of Rindler particles is possible for
any large  because the zero point Minkowski energy exist for modes with any large wave numbers The
radiated Rindler energy must have been piled up near   0 at the initial time of   0 since there is no
particle creation as we have seen in the previous subsection
4 Hawking Radiation
Let us move on to the Hawking radiation from a Schwarzchild black hole in this section We introduce the
Schwarzchild coordinates t r   whose metric is
ds2  cid181 
r cid19 dt2 cid181 
r cid191
dr2  r2d2  r2 cos2 d 
The Kruscal coordinates u v   are related to t r   as

u  vcid12cid12cid12cid12
 expcid18 t
2Mcid19 
2Mcid19 
The rest of the coordinates  and  are unchanged
It is generally accepted that the quantum properties of vacuum near the Schwarzchild event horizon
is essentially the same as those in the Rindler spacetime 2 12 therefore the results we obtained in the
previous section are basically valid by replacing MinkowskiRindler coordinates with KruscalSchwarzchild
coordinates note t in the Schwarzchild spacetime corresponds to  not t in the at spacetime There
are however two fundamental dierences One is the denition of the energy in Kruscal coordinates and
the other is the backreaction of the quantum elds to the black hole metric The latter causes the essential
problem in the scenario of the black hole evaporation
The rst dierence is about the energy that corresponds to the Minkowski energy The Kruscal time u is
not a global Killing time and thus there is no global energy conservation law like for the Minkowski energy
However u can be approximately regarded as a Killing time near the horizons As we have seen in the
previous section the radiation in later time comes from the innitely high frequency modes innitesimally
near the horizon therefore the energy is conserved approximately for these waves
This is in parallel to the approximation of geometrical optics used by Hawking in his original paper 1
geometrical optics assumes locally constant frequency which means locally constant energy Hereafter we
assume the energy corresponds to the Kruscal time u is approximately conserved and treat it in the same
way as for the Minkowski energy in the previous subsection We call it Hartle-Hawking energy since its
ground state is often called Hartle-Hawking vacuum The energy dened with the Schwarzchild time is
called Boulware energy hereafter for the same reason
We have another problem in the denition of the Hartle-Hawking energy in a Schwarzchild spacetime
Minkowski energy is dened as an integration over a surface of t  constant in a at spacetime If we
introduce a similar denition for the Hartle-Hawking energy with Kruscal time u  constant the energy
would include the part of the white hole in the extended Schwarzchild spacetime This diculty may be
avoided by analyzing the black hole formation process by a star collapse or the analytical continuation
method proposed by Hartle and Hawking 13 A detailed analysis on this point will be given in a
forthcoming paper of the author
The second dierence is far more serious the energy of zero point oscillations may change the metric
Usually the zero point energy is subtracted out by normal ordering in the source term of the Einstein
equation and the vacuum does not have eect on the metric This means only the excited state of the energy
can cause gravitation However as we have seen in the previous section the ground state of Hartle-Hawking
energy is not the ground state of the Boulware energy and vise versa
In a at spacetime we consider the ground state of the Minkowski energy is the state of no gravitation
because the Minkowski coordinates are the natural coordinate system We have seen there is innite
accumulation of the Rindler energy near   0 for a Rindler mode vp   There must be an innitely
strong source of gravitational force at   0 if we assume the ground state of the Rindler energy is the state
of no gravitation since the vacuum state dened by the Minkowski energy is the excited state of the Rindler
energy This is not plausible and we can conclude the ground state of the Minkowski energy has no eect
on the metric
In contrast we do not know which coordinate system is natural to calculate the energy stress-energy
tensor for a curved spacetime in general see eg 14 The Schwarzchild coordinates are implicitly
assumed to be natural in the scenario of the black hole evaporation in other words excited states of
Boulware energy causes the gravity The black hole evaporation is believed to be the result of the Hawking
radiation that carries the energy away from the black hole and the energy in this context is the Boulware
energy this means the Boulware energy can have eects on the black hole metric somehow
If this is true however the Rindler energy radiated at later times must have been exist just outside of the
horizon from the beginning 3 The energy does not come from inside the black hole but comes from the
Minkowski modes with extremely high wave numbers This means the backreaction of the quantum eld
is far from negligible to the black hole metric 4
On the contrary we can imagine the gravity is caused by the exited state of Hartle-Hawking energy and
its ground state has no eect on the metric The black hole can exist in this case however it cannot evaporate
There exists a constant outow of Boulware energy but it is the ground state of the Hartle-Hawking energy
and does not have a backreaction on the metric Consequently the black hole metric is unchanged at all just
like the Unruh process does not change the at metric There can be other possibilities for the eect of the
zero point energy to the metric however it is hard to imagine there is an extremely convenient case which
is favorable for the scenario of black hole evaporation
5 Summary
What we have seen in the present paper are
1 The ground state of MinkowskiHartle-Hawking energy is not the ground states of RindlerBoulware
energy and this is what causes the HawkingUnruh process
2 The quantum state is unchanged and particles pairs are not created in any coordinate system the num-
ber of MinkowskiHartle-Hawking particles is zero and number of RindlerBoulware particles has time
stationary Plankian distribution all through the time where time means the RindlerSchwarzchild
3 The radiation of RindlerBoulware energy in the distant future of RindlerSchwarzchild time comes
from the zero point oscillation of MinkowskiHartle-Hawking energy with innitely large wave fre-
quencies
4 The eect of zero point energy to the metric is not known however we have the following two
possibilities for a Schwarzchild spacetime The scenario of black hole evaporation is inconsistent in
both cases
a If the Hawking radiation causes the black hole evaporation it means the excitation in the Boulware
energy can cause the metric change The Boulware energy radiated later time was accumulated
near the horizon at the initial time whose existence essentially alter the Schwarzchild metric
from the beginning
b If on the contrary the Boulware energy of the Hawking radiation does not aect the metric then
the Schwarzchild metric can exist as we expect but exists forever There is no evaporation of the
black hole
We started the present study by assuming that the cis-Plankian physics is valid for any small scale phenom-
ena and end up with the inconsistency of black hole evaporation This fact means we have no reason to
believe the black hole evaporation A new theory of physics in trans-Plankian scale may save the evapora-
tion but may not we can imagine anything but cannot believe What we can say for sure is that the physics
we know at the present is not able to predict the black hole evaporation if the calculations in the present
paper are correct
We see the scenario of black hole evaporation is inconsistent however we do not know what is the
consistent theory even within the cis-Plankian regime The problem deeply depends on the renormalization
procedure in curved spacetimes to which we do not know the answer yet It is often said Hawking process
can be a touchstone for the theory of quantum gravity The author of the present paper would like to say it
also can be a touchstone for the renormalization theory or theory on what is avoided by renormalization at
the present in curved spacetimes
