When a black hole is in an empty space on which there is no matter eld except that of the
Hawking radiation Hawking eld then the black hole evaporates and the entropy of the black
hole decreases The generalised second law guarantees the increase of the total entropy of the
whole system which consists of the black hole and the Hawking eld That is the increase of
the entropy of the Hawking eld is faster than the decrease of the black hole entropy
In naive
sense one may expect that the entropy increase of the Hawking eld is due to the self-interaction
among the composite particles of the Hawking eld and that the self-relaxation of the Hawking
eld results in the entropy increase Then when one consider a non-self-interacting matter eld
as the Hawking eld it is obvious that the self-relaxation does not take place and one may think
that the total entropy does not increase However using nonequilibrium thermodynamics which has
been developed recently we nd for the non-self-interacting Hawking eld that the rate of entropy
increase of the Hawking eld the entropy emission rate by the black hole grows faster than the rate
of entropy decrease of the black hole along the black hole evaporation in the empty space The origin
of the entropy increase of the Hawking eld is the increase of the black hole temperature Hence an
understanding of the generalised second law in the context of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics
is suggested even if the self-relaxation of the Hawking eld does not take place the temperature
increase of the black hole during the evaporation process causes the entropy increase of the Hawking
eld to result in the increase of the total entropy

INTRODUCTION
When a black hole is in an empty space on which there is no matter eld except that of the Hawking radiation
Hawking eld 1 then an outgoing energy ow from the black hole into the empty space arises due to the Hawking
radiation and the black hole loses its mass energy This denotes that a black hole evaporates Concerning the black
hole evaporation in the empty space the generalised second law GSL of the black hole thermodynamics is an
important and interesting issue 2 3 The GSL conjectures that the entropy of a black hole Sg is given by the
horizon area divided by 4 and that the total entropy of the whole system which consists of the black hole and the
Hawking eld increases during the black hole evaporation process Note that when the GSL holds the black hole
entropy Sg decreases during the evaporation process but the entropy of the Hawking eld increases faster than the
decrease of Sg
By the way the outgoing energy ow from the black hole into the empty space denotes that the Hawking eld is in
a nonequilibrium state since no energy ow arises in an equilibrium state Therefore the black hole evaporation in
the empty space should be interpreted as a nonequilibrium process of the whole system In order to prove the GSL
in the context of the black hole evaporation in the empty space we have to dene a nonequilibrium entropy of the
Hawking eld
However because a general denition of the nonequilibrium entropy of matters has not yet been formulated the
existing proofs of the GSL consider an equilibrium between a black hole and a heat bath surrounding it or assume
the existence of a well-dened nonequilibrium entropy of an arbitrary matter 4 Here note that in the existing
proofs a self-interacting matter eld has been considered as the Hawking eld For the black hole evaporation in
the empty space the self-interaction causes the self-relaxation of the Hawking eld itself during propagating on the
empty space to increase the entropy of the Hawking eld if a nonequilibrium entropy were to be dened Then one
may expect naively that the self-relaxation of the Hawking eld is the origin of the increase of the total entropy of
the whole system This seems to be a very reasonable picture of the GSL in the context of the black hole evaporation

in the empty space However I dare to suggest an understanding of the GSL in the context of the nonequilibrium
thermodynamics as follows The self-interaction of the Hawking eld is not necessary but the increase of the black
hole temperature during the evaporation process plays an essential role for the validity of the GSL That is due to
the temperature increase the rate of entropy increase of the Hawking eld the entropy emission rate by the black
hole grows faster than the rate of entropy decrease of the black hole then the total entropy increases without the
self-interaction of the Hawking eld Note that the increase of the black hole temperature along the loss of mass
energy is due to the negative heat capacity of the black hole The negative heat capacity is peculiar to self-gravitating
systems 5 Therefore our understanding of the GSL depends strongly on the feature of the self-gravitation of the
black hole
In order to explain our understanding of the GSL it is appropriate to consider a non-self-interacting matter eld as
the Hawking eld For example photon graviton and a massless free Klein-Gordon eld cid3  0 can be the non-
self-interacting Hawking elds Recently in the study on nonequilibrium thermodynamics of a non-self-interacting
matter eld it has been reported that a nonequilibrium thermodynamics for a radiation eld photon gas was
formulated in a consistent way 6 With referring to report 6 this paper aims to calculate the time evolution of
the total entropy of a black hole and the non-self-interacting Hawking eld in a simplied model of the black hole
evaporation in the empty space and to give an understanding of the GSL as explained above Further since report
6 treats the photons which are collisionless and massless particles we consider that the Hawking eld is not only
non-self-interacting but also massless
This paper is organised as follows The strategy to reach our understanding of the GSL is explained in section II
In section III the nonequilibrium entropy obtained in 6 is briey explained Section IV is devoted to the application
of the nonequilibrium entropy to our strategy Summary and discussions are in section V
We set the fundamental constants unity   G  c  kB  1 Then the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is   260
which is appropriate for a photon gas When one consider a general non-self-interacting massless eld as the Hawking
eld replace the Stefan-Boltzmann constant as     N 2120  N 2 where N  nb  78 nf  and nb
nb  2 for photons is the number of helicities of massless bosonic eld and nf is that of massless fermionic eld
II STRATEGY TO REACH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE GSL
A GSL in the context of the black hole evaporation
Before proceeding to the explanation of our strategy to reach the understanding of the GSL in the context of
nonequilibrium thermodynamics we summarise the statement of the GSL in the context of the black hole evaporation
in the empty space
Some classical properties of a black hole solution of the Einstein equation can be mathematically formulated so
that they correspond to the four laws of the ordinary thermodynamics 3 On the other hand the Hawking radiation
which is a quantum eect of matter elds on a classical black hole spacetime implies that the black hole emits a
thermal radiation of temperature Tg  2 where  is the surface gravity at the black hole horizon 1 Then
because of the Hawking radiation the mathematical correspondence between the properties of a black hole and the
laws of thermodynamics seems to be physically reasonable This mathematical correspondence has been known as
the black hole thermodynamics In the black hole thermodynamics the quantity Sg which corresponds to an entropy
of the black hole is determined to be Sg  Ag4 where Ag is the spatial area of the black hole horizon
Hereafter we consider the Schwarzschild black hole for simplicity Consider the case that the black hole is in an
empty space on which no matter eld except the Hawking eld exists and the black hole evaporates due to the
Hawking radiation The black hole thermodynamics suggests that the black hole behaves like a spherical black body
whose equations of states are
16 T 2
 R 2
where Rg and Eg are respectively the areal radius and the mass energy of the black hole
When the Hawking radiation the quantum eect of matter elds is not considered the mass energy Eg never
decrease and the quantity Sg never decrease as well Then from classical viewpoint it seems that Sg corresponds
to the entropy of the black hole However it is obvious that when the Hawking radiation is taken into account Sg
decreases during the black hole evaporation process due to the energy loss by the Hawking radiation Then the GSL
conjectures that the quantity Sg in equations 1 is the true entropy of the black hole and the total entropy of the
whole system increases during the black hole evaporation process in the empty space 2
Here we give some supplementary comments on the energetic and entropic properties of the black hole For the
rst on the energetics the equations of states 1 give the negative heat capacity Cg of the black hole
8 T 2
 2 R 2
g  0 
This denotes that when the energy Eg is lost the temperature Tg increases The negative heat capacity is a peculiar
energetic property to the self-gravitating systems 5 Therefore it is obvious that the equations of states 1 contain
the self-gravitational eects of the black hole on its own thermodynamic states Next for the black hole entropy it has
already been revealed that if there is no black hole horizon Rg  0 on the spacetime the quantity which corresponds
to the entropy of the spacetime itself is zero 7 8 That is the quantity which corresponds to the entropy of the
whole gravitational eld is given by the quantity Sg in equations 1 Hence the energetic and entropic properties of
a black hole are well encoded in the equations of states 1
B Strategy to reach our understanding of the GSL
We have to dene the total entropy of the whole system It has already been shown in reference 8 that for the
equilibrium state of the black hole with a general self-interacting Hawking eld the total entropy is given by a simple
sum of the black hole entropy Sg with the equilibrium entropy of the general Hawking eld Therefore in the case of
the black hole evaporation in the empty space we assume that the equilibrium case is extended simply so that the
total entropy Stot of the whole system which consists of the black hole and the nonequilibrium Hawking eld is given
by the simple sum
Stot  Sg  Sm 
where Sg is given by equations 1 and Sm is the nonequilibrium entropy of the general self-interacting Hawking eld
The GSL conjectures the inequality dStot  0 during the black hole evaporation process Here note that because the
black hole evaporation proceeds very slowly as seen later in section IV A we approximate the black hole itself is in
an equilibrium state at each moment during the evaporation process while the Hawking eld is in a nonequilibrium
state Hence we use the equilibrium quantity Sg as the black hole entropy in equation 3 More discussions on the
validity of the additivity 3 and of the existence of a well-dened nonequilibrium entropy Sm of an arbitrary matter
are given later in section V
Because the Hawking eld is in a nonequilibrium state due to the energy ow by the Hawking radiation the problem
is how to deal with the nonequilibrium entropy Sm Note that it is appropriate to assume that the nonequilibrium
entropy of any self-interacting matter increases during a relaxation process since it is the self-interaction that causes
the increase of the matter entropy in the context of the ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics Therefore if we nd
the increase of the total entropy of the whole system which consists of the black hole and the non-self-interacting
Hawking eld then it implies that the GSL holds with an arbitrary self-interacting Hawking eld Here one may
show an example as an objection that when an inter-stellar gas collapses to form a star although the net entropy will
increase the self-gravitational eect decreases the entropy of the collapsing gas However as discussed in appendix A
we can expect that this objection is not true of the Hawking eld
Next turn our attention from self-interaction to the eect by the external-gravitational eld on the Hawking ra-
diation It should be noted that even when the self-interaction including self-gravitation of the Hawking eld is
ignored there remain some gravitational interactions between the Hawking eld and the black hole which are for
example the gravitational red shift curvature scattering lens eect and so on The external-gravitational eld works
as if a virtual medium on which the Hawking eld propagates then the composite particles of the Hawking eld
interact with the virtual medium to result in the relaxation of the Hawking eld toward some equilibrium state
Therefore it is appropriate to assume that the external-gravitational interaction causes the increase of the entropy
of the Hawking eld Hence we expect that if we can calculate a nonequilibrium entropy of the non-self-interacting
Hawking eld by ignoring the external-gravitational interaction then the rate of increase of such an approximate
entropy is smaller than that of the nonequilibrium entropy of the non-self-interacting Hawking eld calculated by
including the external-gravitational interaction
From the above discussions we can expect that the following inequality holds along the black hole evaporation
process in the empty space
where Stot is the total entropy with a general self-interacting Hawking eld given by equation 3 which includes
the gravitational interactions between the black hole and the Hawking eld and Smin
is the total entropy of the
dStot  dSmin
whole system which consists of the black hole and the non-self-interacting Hawking eld Here the entropy Smin
decomposed as
tot  Sg  Snsi 
where Snsi is the nonequilibrium entropy of the non-self-interacting Hawking eld without including the gravitational
interaction with the black hole Therefore if the inequality dSmin
 0 holds then we can expect that the GSL
dStot  0 follows
In naive sense one may think that the nonequilibrium entropy Snsi of the non-self-interacting Hawking eld does
not increase because the self-interactions and the external-gravitational potential are ignored and the Hawking eld
never relaxes by itself The absence of the self-relaxation is a right conclusion from above discussions However it
should be emphasised that there still remains an interaction the emission process of the Hawking radiation by the
black hole Here note that the negative heat capacity Cg of the black hole denotes the increase of the black hole
temperature Tg along the loss of the mass energy Eg Therefore it can be expected that the emission process causes
the increase of the entropy Snsi of the non-self-interacting Hawking eld even when the gravitational interaction with
the black hole is ignored The higher the temperature Tg grows the more amount of matter entropy is emitted with
the Hawking radiation
In this paper by constructing a concrete formula of the nonequilibrium entropy Snsi of a non-self-interacting
Hawking eld without including the gravitational interaction with the black hole we aim to show that the inequality
dSmin
tot  0 holds during the black hole evaporation in the empty space The concrete method for the calculation of
the entropy Snsi is explained in the following sections
C The model of the black hole evaporation
Because we are interested in the non-self-interacting Hawking eld without the gravitational interaction with the
black hole it is enough to consider the model that a black body satisfying the equations of states 1 is put in a at
spacetime This modelling retains the self-gravitational eects of the black hole on its own thermodynamic states
negative heat capacity as mentioned in section II A Therefore in order to pick up the nonequilibrium eects
of the Hawking eld on the black hole evaporation process we consider a simplied model named NHR after the
nonequilibrium Hawking radiation
NHR Model Consider a spherical black body satisfying equations 1 which emits some non-self-interacting mass-
less matter elds with Planckian spectrum free Hawking elds Then put the black body in a at spacetime
on which there exists no matter eld except the free Hawking elds Then the black body evaporates due to
equations 1 and the emission of the free Hawking elds This evaporation can be understood as a relaxation
process of the whole system which consists of the black body and the fee Hawking elds
Here note that although the self-interactions including the self-gravitation of the Hawking eld are ignored however
the self-gravitational eects of the black hole on its own thermodynamic state is encoded in the equations of states
1 Henceforth we call the black body the black hole and call the non-self-interacting massless elds the free Hawking
elds
In the NHR model the black hole continues to emit the free Hawking elds without any in-falling energy into the
black hole and the free Hawking elds continue to spread out into the empty space That is an outgoing energy ow
from the black hole into the empty space exists during the black hole evaporation process The outgoing energy ow
equals the rate of energy increase in the free Hawking elds
Further because of the quasi-equilibrium approximation of the black hole itself see the rst paragraph in section
II B we notice that from the thermodynamic viewpoint the thermodynamic state of the black hole itself during
the evaporation process changes along a sequence of equilibrium states characterised by equations 1 in the state
space and that the black hole behaves always as a perfect black body of temperature Tg at each moment during the
evaporation process Recall the quasi-static process in the ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics Therefore the
rate of energy increase J in the free Hawking elds in the NHR model is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law
J   T 4
where  is the general Stefan-Boltzmann constant given at the end of section I
This J is equivalent to the energy ow in the free Hawking elds and denotes that while the thermodynamic state
of the black hole changes along a sequence of equilibrium states the thermodynamic state of the free Hawking elds
should change along a sequence of nonequilibrium states in the state space where each nonequilibrium state in the
g    xin   
FIG 1 MS model The radiation eld between the outer and inner black bodies is in a steady state The entropy of the
radiation eld is given by the steady state thermodynamics for a radiation eld
sequence of the elds states should have the energy ow J Hence the time evolution of the total entropy Smin
should be analysed with a nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the free Hawking elds In order to carry out the
nonequilibrium analysis we refer report 6 which has formulated a nonequilibrium thermodynamics for a radiation
eld photon gas in a consistent way This can easily be extended to a general non-self-interacting massless eld as
shown in the next section III Then the nonequilibrium entropy Snsi of the free Hawking elds is concretely given
using the formula obtained in 6
Here one may point out that for an equilibrium of a black hole with the Hawking eld the gravitational red shift
results in the need for a higher temperature of the Hawking eld than the black hole temperature Tg in order to retain
the equilibrium against the attractive gravitational force by the black hole 9 Then an energy ow stronger than J
would be appropriate in order to retain the eect of the gravitational red shift However the NHR model ignores the
external-gravitational potential and the energy ow J of equation 6 is suitable for our purpose Further note that a
lower temperature of the free Hawking elds implies a smaller emission rate of entropy by the black hole Therefore
by ignoring the gravitational red shift we can recognise that inequality 4 becomes more reasonable
Although some simplications and assumptions are put in the NHR model which one may think as a too simplied
model we will use it to obtain some insight into the GSL Further in order to avoid confusions it is helpful for readers
to mention here that the so-called black hole phase transition or the Hawking-Page phase transition for AdS black
holes in the ordinary black hole thermodynamics 10 is out of the scope of this paper The black hole phase transition
is the conclusion which comes from the study on the equilibrium states of the system in which a black hole is put in
a heat bath Here in this paper we do not consider any heat bath surrounding the black hole but put a black hole in
an empty and innitely large space where the black hole can not be in any equilibrium with its environment We are
interested in the dynamical process of a black hole evaporation in the empty space as a nonequilibrium process and
aim to clarify the eect of the increase of black hole temperature on the GSL
III STEADY STATE THERMODYNAMICS FOR FREE HAWKING FIELDS
As a middle step before proceeding to the calculation of the nonequilibrium entropy Snsi of the free Hawking elds
in the NHR model we consider a more simplied model which considers a radiation eld photon gas as the free
Hawking elds and can be realised in a laboratory experiment This simple model is shown in gure 1 and named
MS after the middle step
MS model Make a vacuum cavity in a large black body of equilibrium temperature Tout and put an another smaller
black body of temperature Tin 6 Tout in the cavity For the case Tin  Tout the radiation eld photon gas
emitted by the two black bodies causes an energy ow from the inner black body to the outer one When the
outer black body is isolated from the outside world the whole system which consists of the two black bodies
and the radiation eld between them relaxes to a total equilibrium state in which the two black bodies and the
radiation eld have the same equilibrium temperature
Note that the equations of states of the two black bodies are not specied Here following report 6 we consider that
the black bodies emit a radiation eld photon gas However it is easily extended to a general non-self-interacting
massless eld by replacing the Stefan-Boltzmann constant  with the generalized one  as mentioned at the end of
section I In section IV we will extend the MS model to the NHR model To do so we will make the inner black body
have the equations of states 1 and remove the outer black body by setting the cavity innitely large and Tout  0
Concerning the relaxation process required in the MS model consider the case satisfying the following two condi-
tions The rst is that the thermodynamic state of each black body evolves so slowly that it changes along a sequence
of equilibrium states in the state space during the relaxation process The second condition is that the volume of
the cavity is so small that the speed of light is approximated as innity during the relaxation process These two
conditions denote that 6 at each moment of the relaxation process the retarded eect of photons is ignored and the
thermodynamic state of the radiation eld sandwiched by the two black bodies is well approximated by the nonequi-
librium state which possesses a stationary energy ow Jrad determined by the temperatures of the two black bodies
Tin and Tout The energy ow Jrad is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law Jrad    T 4
out  Ain where Ain is
the surface area of the inner black body This Jrad equals the energy exchange par a unit time between the two black
bodies via the radiation eld
in  T 4
From above discussions it is enough for us to consider a set state space of the steady states macroscopically
stationary nonequilibrium state of the radiation eld whose nonequilibrium nature is raised by the steady energy
ow Jrad That is the sequence of the nonequilibrium states of the radiation eld during the relaxation process lies in
the set state space of the steady states Although each steady state alone does not cause any time evolution of the
system however the time evolution of the temperatures Tin and Tout can be obtained by shifting the thermodynamic
state of the radiation eld along the sequence of the steady states as time goes on Therefore we need a consistent
denition of the steady state entropy of the radiation eld Once the steady state entropy of the radiation eld is
obtained we can express explicitly the total entropy during the relaxation process of the whole system which consists
of the two black bodies and the radiation eld Further by extending the denition of the steady state entropy into
the case of an innitely large cavity with Tout  0 it is expected that the total entropy Smin
of the NHR model can
be analysed explicitly as well
A consistent thermodynamic framework for the steady states for a radiation eld in the MS model has already been
constructed 6 The outline of the construction of the entropy in the steady state thermodynamics for a radiation
eld in the MS model is as follows
Refer the Landau-Lifshitz type denition of a nonequilibrium entropy for a bosonic gas 11
Sboson Z
2 3 dx3 gpx   1  fpx  ln  1  fpx   fpx ln fpx  
where p is the momentum of a photon x is a spatial point and gpx and fpx are respectively the number of states
and the average number of particles at a point p x in the phase space of the bosonic gas Note that it has also been
shown in reference 11 that the maximisation of Sboson for an isolated system Sboson  0 gives the equilibrium
Bose distribution This is frequently referred to in many works on nonequilibrium systems as the H-theorem However
in reference 11 concrete forms of gpx and fpx are not specied since an arbitrary system is considered
In the MS model the radiation eld is sandwiched between two black bodies Then we can determine gpx and fpx
gpx  2 helicities of a radiation eld
fpx 
expT p x  1
where the frequency of a photon   p and T p x is given by
T p x Tin
for p  pin at x
for p  pout at x
where pin is the momentum of the photon emitted by the inner black body and pout by the outer black body The
x-dependence of T p x arises because the directions in which the photons of pin and pout can come to a point x
vary from point to point
From above we obtain the steady state entropy of a radiation eld Srad
Srad Z dx3sradx
sradx 
in  goutx T 3
where ginx is the solid angle divided by 4 covered by the direction of pin at x as shown in gure 1 and goutx
cid0 ginx T 3
is similarly dened with pout In deriving 9 we used the relations R 
0 dx cid2x2ex  1cid3 lnex  1  114180 and
0 dx cid2x21  excid3 ln1  ex  436 
Further with dening the steady state internal energy Erad  2R dp3dx3  fpx and the other variables such as the
free energy with somewhat careful discussions it has already been checked that the 0th 1st 2nd and 3rd laws of
the ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics are extended to include the steady states of a radiation eld That is the
steady state thermodynamics for a radiation eld has already been constructed in a consistent way Especially in the
steady state entropy 9 it has already been revealed in 6 that the total entropy of the whole system which consists
of the two black bodies and the radiation led increases monotonically during the relaxation process required in the
MS model dSin  dSout  dSrad  0 where the equality holds for the total equilibrium state Sin and Sout are the
outcid1 
entropies of the two black bodies which are given by the ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics and it is assumed
that the two black bodies are made of ordinary materials and have positive heat capacities
When we consider a massless fermionic eld instead of the radiation eld in the MS model equation 7 is replaced
by 11
Sf ermion  Z
2 3 dx3 gpx   1  fpx  ln  1  fpx   fpx ln fpx  
where gpx  nf is the eective number of helicities and fpx   expT p x  1 1 Then following the same
procedure as a radiation eld we can obtain the steady state entropy of a massless fermionic eld as
0 dx cid2x2ex  1cid3 lnex  1  460  A and R 
where we used R 
0 dx cid2x21  excid3 ln1  ex  114180  A
where A  ln 22  2 ln 226  4 4 12  7 ln 22 3 z is the zeta function and z s is the modied
zeta function Apells function Hence when the black bodies in the MS model emit nf massless fermionic modes
and nb massless bosonic modes nb  2 for a radiation eld the steady state entropy of the matter elds between
the two black bodies is given by equation 9 by replacing  by  given at the end of section I
IV TIME EVOLUTION OF THE TOTAL ENTROPY
A From the MS model to the NHR model
We proceed to the analysis of the total entropy Smin
in the NHR model which can be obtained from the MS
model by considering the equations of states of the inner black body as equations 1 and by removing the outer black
body The way of removing the outer black body from the MS model is to set the cavitys volume innite and to
set the outer temperature zero Tout  0 In the NHR model the free Hawking elds continue to spread out into the
empty space
The time evolution of the black hole radius Rg is given by equations 1 and 6
 J  Rgt  R0 cid181 
1280  R3
0cid1913
4  Tgt
where R0  Rg0 is the initial radius and it is assumed that the emission of the Hawking radiation starts at t  0
This Rgt leads the time evolution of the thermodynamic state of the black hole and the steady state of the free
Hawking elds Equation 12 gives the evaporation time life time of the black hole
tev  1280 
On the other hand the time scale tbh that a massless particle travels across the size of the black hole is given by
tbh  R0 This time tbh gives a typical time scale of the free Hawking elds to spread out into the empty space
Therefore when the inequality tevtbh  O1 holds the black hole evaporation proceeds very slowly in comparison
with the time scale tbh Henceforth we assume the order relation tevtbh  O1 which denotes that the quasi-
equilibrium approximation of the black hole itself is valid as mentioned in section II B More discussion on this
assumption is given later in section V
B Nonequilibrium entropy of the free Hawking elds
In order to apply the steady state thermodynamics 6 to the free Hawking elds in the NHR model the distribution
function of photons 8 should be modied to include the retarded eect of composite particles nb bosons and nf
fermions travelling in an innitely large space In this section we construct the modied distribution function for the
rst then obtain the nonequilibrium entropy of the free Hawking elds in the NHR model by substituting the modied
distribution function into formulae 7 and 10 Here note that because of the quasi-equilibrium approximation of
the black hole itself we ignore the special relativistic Doppler eects due to the shrinkage of the surface of the black

FIG 2 Retarded eect on the Hawking radiation
Hereafter r denotes the areal radius from the centre of the black hole In order to take the retarded eect into
account consider a massless particle which has been emitted at the surface of the black hole at time t and reaches
the spatial point of r at time t  t The emission time t depends not only on the coordinates t r but also on
the angle p between the radial direction of r and the momentum of the particle see gure 2 This emission time
tt r p can be obtained as a root of the following equation

Note that this is the equation of degree six about t and the appropriate root as the emission time tt r p is the
maximum root in the range 0  t  t Although another root may exist in this range however such a root corresponds
to the particle emitted at point q in gure 2 which is obviously unphysical And the other four roots of this equation
may be complex valued ones Further it is also obvious that the angle p has an upper bound 0  p  mt r This
upper bound is given by appendix B as see equations B1 B2 and B3

Here note that because the entropy min
does not explicitly depend on R0 or N  then once the value of  is
xed the choice of R0 or N  is arbitrary with adjusting the value of N or R0 appropriately to match with  And
we assume   O1 as mentioned in section IV A
The numerical results are shown in gures 3 and 4 The parameters R0 and N are chosen so that the relations

gure is as follows
 Because the plotted curves are converging it is appropriate to conclude that the total entropy min
increasing for   O1 and the GSL is well supported
 Since the normalised black hole entropy Xg 2 is obviously monotone decreasing the entropy of the free
Hawking elds increases monotonically faster than the decrease of the black hole entropy
is monotone
 It is suggested rather well that min
large   103 and the nal value is approximately given by min
  gives almost the same curves in - graph for all values of suciently

however the same behaviour is obtained for all values of suciently large   103 The arrows in gure 4 denote the
direction of the null world lines of massless particles What we can nd with this gure is as follows
 While the entropy of the free Hawking elds spreads out to decrease the spatial density left panel the spherical
shell density on each spherical shell remains constant while it spreads out into the empty space right panel
This is consistent with the absence of the self-relaxation in the free Hawking elds
 The entropy of the free Hawking elds at the surface of the black hole which equals the amount of matter
entropy emitted by the black hole at each moment increases as the evaporation process proceeds Here note
that the the black hole temperature increases obviously That is the understanding of the GSL suggested in
section I can be extracted from gures 3 and 4
V SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS
When a black hole evaporates due to the Hawking radiation the thermodynamic state of the Hawking eld is in a
nonequilibrium state Then referring to a recent development on the steady state thermodynamics for a radiation eld
we have analysed explicitly the time evolution of a black hole evaporation process within the framework of the NHR
model and obtained the conclusion that the total entropy Smin
increases monotonically for   tevR0  O1
where tev is the evaporation time and R0 is the initial black hole radius Therefore as discussed in section II we can
obtain the understanding of the GSL in the context of the steady state thermodynamics as follows The increase of
the black hole temperature due to its negative heat capacity gives the increase of the entropy of the Hawking elds
and the rate of entropy increase of the Hawking elds is faster than the rate of entropy decrease of the black hole
That is the self-interaction of the Hawking elds is not necessary for the validity of the GSL
Here we pay attention to the last stage of the evaporation process in the NHR model the total entropy Stot
increases in an accelerating fashion as shown in gure 3 According to the relaxation process in the MS model which
reaches a total equilibrium state as mentioned in section III or shown in report 6 in detail one may think the
accelerated increase of Smin
is strange because the black hole evaporation process in the framework of the NHR
model is also described as the relaxation process of the whole system However the accelerated increase of Smin
never contradict the discussions in section III and in report 6 because the black hole has the negative heat capacity
as shown by equation 2 The negative heat capacity is a peculiar property to the self-gravitating systems 5 While
the positive heat capacity of an ordinary system makes the entropy emission rate decrease to zero as the relaxation
process proceeds however the negative heat capacity of the black hole makes the entropy emission rate increase as
the black hole evaporation process proceeds as shown by the right panel in gure 4 This increase of the entropy
emission rate is the essence of our understanding of the GSL
Here it is recalled that the negative heat capacity of a self-gravitating gas system not of a black hole causes
the accelerated increase of its temperature which is called the gravothermal catastrophe 5 The gravothermal
catastrophe is the phenomenon suggested by the ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
Hence the accelerated increase of the total entropy of the black hole and the Hawking elds shown in gure 3 may be
interpreted as a nonequilibrium version of the gravothermal catastrophe
In this paper the monotone increasing nature of the total entropy Smin
is concluded by the numerical results
shown in gure 3 Therefore correctly speaking our conclusion is not analytically completely supported at present
If the inequality dSmin
dt  0 will be obtained analytically our understanding of the GSL will have more rigid
mathematical reasoning Further our discussion given in this paper may be understood as a new proof of the GSL
dStot  0 according to inequality 4
We turn our discussion to the validity of the assumption   tevtbh  O1 which guarantees the validity of the
quasi-equilibrium approximation of the black hole In semi-classical treatment the black hole temperature is less than
the Planck temperature Then the exotic particles are not expected to be created in the Hawking radiation and only
the ordinary well-known standard particles will be created Hence we can expect that the number of species of the
Hawking elds  N  is less than 108573  O105 see inequality 17  For the case N  O105 the assumption
  O1 is valid for a black hole of initial radius R0  O10 in Planck unit And if we estimate the order of N
by the ordinary standard particles three generations of quarks and leptons and their inner states gauge particles of
four fundamental interactions and their helicities then we nd N  O10 and the assumption   O1 is valid for
a black hole of initial radius R0  O101 in Planck unit Hence when no exotic particle appears in the Hawking
radiation our discussion based on the NHR model seems to be valid for a semi-classical black hole of initial radius
R0  1 until one Planck time before the evaporation time tev
Here we notice that for the case N  O10 the order relation   O103 corresponds to the black hole of
initial radius R0  O10 Therefore we nd from gure 3 that for the black hole of R0  O10    O103
the normalised total entropy min
  evolves in almost the same increasing fashion and reaches almost the same
nal value  133 Further it should be noted here that even if we consider the very last stage of the evaporation
process where the quasi-equilibrium approximation of the black hole breaks down and the evaporation may proceed
to a quantum gravitational process it is reasonable to expect that the total entropy after the quantum evaporation
process nished should be greater than the total entropy before the evaporation process proceeds to the quantum one
since the well-dened entropy has to be a non-decreasing quantity Hence because inequality 4 indicates that Smin
is the lower bound of the total entropy of the whole system it is suggested that when the black hole evaporates in
the empty space with emitting any self-interacting Hawking eld the nal value of the total entropy Stot not the
lower bound Smin
 should be larger than 133  Sg0
Finally we discuss about the strategy to reach the understanding of the GSL in the context of the steady state
thermodynamics The strategy explained in section II has two key assumptions remained to be proven the additivity
of the entropy 3 and the existence of a well-dened nonequilibrium entropy Sm of an arbitrary self-interacting
Hawking eld However these two key assumptions seem to be reasonable as are discussed in the following two
paragraphs
On the validity of the additivity 3 we refer the present status of the study on the laboratory system which has
self-interactions but not self- and external-gravitational interactions For example consider that the system is in a
nonequilibrium state which is not so far from an equilibrium state that the heat ux in that system is not extremely
strong Then the so-called extended irreversible thermodynamics 12 gives a well-dened nonequilibrium entropy up
to the second order in the expansion by the heat ux Further the nonequilibrium entropy satises the additivity as in
the ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics Therefore we can expect that when the equilibrium entropy satises the
additivity even with the gravitational eects the nonequilibrium entropy also satises the additivity Hence due to
the additivity of the equilibrium entropies of the black hole and the Hawking eld 8 it seems reasonable to assume
the additivity 3
Next we consider the validity of the existence of a well-dened nonequilibrium entropy Sm of an arbitrary self-
interacting Hawking eld As mentioned in the previous paragraph the nonequilibrium entropy has already been
dened well up to the second order in the expansion by the heat ux 12 Further on the other hand the evaporation
time tev of a black hole has an extremely long time scale   tevtbh  O1 as discussed above Therefore it seems
appropriate that the black hole evaporation proceeds so slowly that the nonequilibrium state of the self-interacting
Hawking eld is not so far from an equilibrium state that the expansion of the thermodynamic quantities by the
heat ux up to the second order can be a good approximation Hence it is reasonable to assume the existence of a
well-dened nonequilibrium entropy of an arbitrary self-interacting Hawking eld
APPENDIX A BLACK HOLE EVAPORATION AND STAR FORMATION PROCESS
This appendix discusses in a simple way about the similarity between the black hole evaporation process and the
star formation process When an interstellar gas collapses to form a star it is commonly believed that there arises
the increase of the net entropy of the system which consists of the collapsing gas and the radiated matters from the
gas However the self-gravitational eect of the collapsing gas causes the decrease of the entropy of the collapsing gas
itself It is briey explained as follows
Since the pressure of the gas at its surface is zero the loss of energy E par a unit time of the collapsing gas by
the radiation of energy is actually the loss of heat due to the rst law of the thermodynamics
where T is the temperature of the collapsing gas and S is the loss of entropy par a unit time The energy loss
E can be interpreted as the minus of the luminosity L of the collapsing gas L  E Then with the assumption
of the local mechanical and thermal equilibrium of the collapsing gas at each moment of its collapse relation A1
can be rewritten more exactly to the following form 5
E  T S
where U is the total internal energy of the collapsing gas and  is the total self-gravitational potential given by
L  
d U   
 T S 
 Z M
dm cid18
rmcid19 
where G is Newtons constant M is the mass of the collapsing gas and the radial distance from the centre of the gas
rm is expressed as the function of mass m inside the sphere of radius r
From above it is recognised that the radius rm becomes smaller as the gas collapses then the self-gravitational
potential  decreases to result in the radiation of energy L  0 and the loss of the entropy S  0 Therefore if
we consider not a collapsing but an expanding self-gravitating gas the radius rm increases to result in the increase
of entropy S  0 Here note that the Hawking eld in the black hole evaporation process corresponds not to the
collapsing gas but to the the expanding matters radiated by the collapsing gas Hence it seems reasonable to assume
that the entropy of a self-gravitating Hawking eld is larger than that of a non-self-gravitating Hawking eld
APPENDIX B UPPER BOUND OF p
This appendix derives the upper bound m of the angle p which appears in equation 14 In order to nd the
explicit expression of m look at the photons emitted by the black hole at the initial time t  0 which we call the
initial photons Obviously we have m  0 for t  r  R0 since no photons has been reached the point The initial
photons emitted in radial direction form the boundary of the region which the free Hawking elds ll The initial
photons emitted in o-radial directions propagate behind the initial photons emitted in radial directions Therefore
0 Within
this time interval the upper bound m is given by the initial photon which is obtained with setting t  0 in gure 2
Then we nd
the initial photons reach a spatial point of radial distance r  R0 in the time interval r R0  t pr2  R2

the trajectory of this photon is tangent to the sphere of radius Rgtm and the other four roots may be complex
valued ones Finally turn to the spatial point of radial distance r  R0 It is obvious for this spatial point that the
upper bound m is also given by formula B2
