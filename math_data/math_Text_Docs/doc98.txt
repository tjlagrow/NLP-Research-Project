We have used the analogy between gravitational systems and non-homogeneous uid ows to
calculate the density-density correlation function of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in the
presence of an acoustic black hole The emission of correlated pairs of phonons by Hawking-like
process results into a peculiar long-range density correlation Quantitative estimations of the eect
are provided for realistic experimental congurations

Hawkings prediction of black holes evaporation is gen-
erally regarded as a milestone of modern theoretical
physics Combining Einsteins General Relativity and
Quantum Mechanics Hawking was able to show that
black holes are not black but emit thermal radiation
at a temperature inversely proportional to their mass
1 This quantum mechanical process is triggered by the
formation of a horizon and proceeds via the conversion
of vacuum uctuations into on-shell particles Unfortu-
nately so far there is no experimental support for this
amazing theoretical prediction The emission tempera-
ture Hawking temperature for a solar mass black hole
is expected to be of the order of 108 K far below the
3 K cosmic microwave background Nor evidence has
been found so far of a X-ray background from a hypo-
thetical primordial population of low mass black holes
 1010 Kg in the nal stages of their evaporation 2
Expectations to directly observe Hawking radiation from
mini-black holes formed in colliders like LHC or next gen-
eration ones are based on models where the quantum
gravity scale Planck scale 1019 GeV is lowered down
to the TeV scale by the presence of extra-dimensions 3
It is perhaps fair to say that the prospects to have a di-
rect experimental detection of Hawking radiation from
black holes in the near future are not very optimistic
In a remarkable work Unruh 4 showed that Hawking
radiation is not peculiar to gravity but is rather a purely
kinematic eect of quantum eld theory which only de-
pends on eld propagation on a black hole-type curved
space-time background This opens the concrete possibil-
ity to study the Hawking radiation process in completely
dierent physical systems As an example the propaga-
tion of sound waves in Eulerian uids can be described in
terms of the same equation describing a massless scalar
eld on a curved spacetime characterized by an acous-
tic metric G which is function of the background ow
the curvature of the acoustic geometry is induced by the
inhomogeneity of the uid ow while at minkowskian
spacetime is recovered in the case of a homogeneous sys-
tem In particular an acoustic black hole or dumb hole
conguration is obtained whenever a subsonic ow turns
supersonic sound waves in the supersonic region are in
fact dragged away by the ow and can not propagate back
towards the acoustic horizon separating the supersonic
and subsonic regions Upon quantization Hawking radi-
ation is expected to appear as a ux of thermal phonons
emitted from the horizon at a temperature proportional
to its surface gravity Even though a substantial eort
has been spent on a variety of analog models 8 eg
superuid Helium 9 phonons in atomic Bose-Einstein
condensates 5 degenerate Fermi gases 6 slow light in
moving media 10 or travelling refractive index inter-
faces in nonlinear media 11 the weakness of Hawking
radiation has so far prevented experimental verication
of these predictions
In the present Letter we propose a novel route to de-
tect the emission by an acoustic black hole in a owing
Bose-Einstein condensate Dierently from the case of
astrophysical black holes both the external and the in-
ternal region of the acoustic black hole are in fact ac-
cessible to experiment the quantum-optical correlations
between the Hawking radiation emitted inside and out-
side the acoustic black hole are responsible for a signi-
cant long-range correlation between the density uctua-
tions at points respectively inside and outside the acous-
tic black hole This unique signature can be exploited to
isolate Hawking radiation from the background of com-
peting processes and experimental noise
We start by briey recalling those features of Hawk-
ing radiation that we shall use in what follows Con-
sider the quantum eld associated to Hawking radiation
to be in its vacuum state at early times before the hori-
zon formation let us call it ini
In the Heisenberg
picture the state of the eld at late times will be still
ini but because of the horizon formation the ini state
does not correspond to the late time vacuum state outi
of the eld A basis for the out modes see Fig1 is com-
posed by ingoing ie propagating downstream in the
free-falling frame modes and outgoing ie modes prop-
agating upstream modes Let 0ingi and 0outgi be the
We limit our attention to the so-called hydrodynamic
limit where perturbations are considered with wave-
lengths much longer than the healing length   mgn
m is the atomic mass and g the atom-atom nonlinear in-
teraction constant in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation 12
The linearized equation of motion for the phase 1 eld
is then formally equivalent to a curved spacetime eld
equation for a massless scalar eld 5

To obtain workable analytical expressions we restrict
our attention to the simplest case of a one-dimensional
condensate whose transverse size  is assumed to be
much smaller than the healing length  Congurations
of this kind can be realized in the lab by outcoupling
atoms from a mother condensate in to an atomic ber to
form a so-called atom laser beam 21 25 26 Perform-
ing a dimensional reduction along the transverse direc-
tion 29 the two-point function for the eld 1 can be

ric 3 with n1D  n2

entering the two-point function 6 is to be taken in the
vacuum state of the positive frequency modes with re-
spect to the x coordinates 7 27 After dimensional
reduction an eective potential term appears in the 11
dimensional wave equation 2 which is responsible for
backscattering of the modes In what follows we neglect
such a term to obtain a conformally invariant 1  1 di-
mensional theory that can be handled in a fully analytical
FIG 1 Space-time diagram describing the ingoing blue
lines and outgoing red modes Before the black hole for-
mation t  0 modes propagate along straight lines When
the horizon in x  0 is formed propagation gets signicantly
distorted and the outgoing modes inside the black hole remain
trapped
vacuum states of respectively the ingoing and outgoing
modes Among the outgoing modes we must distinguish
between the ones which propagate outside the horizon
with a sound velocity faster than the ow velocity and
are therefore able to reach the asymptotic region far from
the horizon and the ones that are trapped inside the hori-
zon and are dragged inwards by the ow which is here
faster than the speed of sound
Hawking radiation corresponds to particles creation in
the outgoing sector only and limiting to this latter the
late-time decomposition for the ini vacuum in terms of
these escaping and trapped modes has the form of a two-
mode squeezed vacuum state 27

where aesctr 
are creation operators for respectively the
outgoing escaping and trapped modes TH is the Hawk-
ing temperature and B the Boltzmann constant Thus
the Hawking process consists of the creation of corre-
lated pairs of outgoing quanta triggered by the horizon
formation 32 33 one member is emitted into an es-
caping mode and corresponds to what is usually called
Hawking particle the other member the so-called part-
ner is emitted into a trapped mode inside the horizon
Of course this latter particle is denitively lost and can
not be detected in the case of astrophysical black holes
Let us now move to an analog model of black hole based
on a owing atomic Bose-Einstein condensate BEC As
we are considering small uctuations around a station-
ary and fully condensed state we write the Bose eld
operator as   ei n in terms of the number den-
sity n and the phase  12 and we expand the density
n  n  n1 and phase     1 operators around the

as a white dashed line is the signature of Hawking radiation

tive frequency with respect to the generalized coordinate

esting case when the x x points are located on opposite
sides with respect to the horizon and lie well outside the

The x x dependence contained in the cosh term is the
central result of the present Letter as shown in Fig 3
2 x x has a quite narrow valley-shaped feature cen-
tered on the xv  cl  xcr  v straight line that
describes correlations between pair of points located re-
spectively inside and outside the black hole The bottom
value of the valley goes as the squared surface gravity
and it is inversely proportional to the diluteness param-
eter n1D of the gas The neglected subleading term

ow velocity v are kept constant while the sound velocity c
is modied around t  0 according to the picture The sonic
horizon is at x  0
way 15 This is expected to produce only slight quanti-
tative overestimations of the nal result 30
The consistency of this approach can be validated
on the simplest case of a spatially homogeneous one-
dimensional BEC of density n1D moving at a constant
and spatially uniform speed v
In this case the light
cone coordinates associated to the vacuum are simply

cv  Using 5 this leads to the result
2 x x  n1D2xx2 which fully agrees with
standard BEC theory 16 in the long-distance x x 
 limit where the hydrodynamic approximation is valid
We now turn to the most interesting case of an acoustic
black hole Consider a one-dimensional BEC of uniform
density n1D which is owing with constant speed v along
the x direction For t  0 the sound velocity cx t is
constant in space and equal to cx t  cr  v At t  0
the sound velocity in the x  0 region is rapidly switched
to a lower cl  v value in order to create a horizon that
separates a region of sub-sonic v  cr ow for x  0 from
a super-sonic v  cl one for x  0 In the crossover re-
gion x  x0 x0 the sound velocity is assumed to vary
linearly in x In order for the hydrodynamic approxima-
tion to be valid x0 has to be larger than  The sonic
horizon ie the locus where c  v lies at x  0 see
Fig 2
In practice such a modulation can be obtained by
spatially modulating the transverse connement of the
waveguide 21 34 andor the nonlinear interaction con-
stant gx by means of a spatially varying magnetic eld
in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance 12
In order
to minimize competing processes such as back-scattering
of condensate atoms Landau- Cerenkov phonon emis-
sion 14 and soliton shedding 21 from the horizon re-
gion the change in gx has to be compensated by a
corresponding change in the external potential V x so
to keep the local potential ngx  V x constant
While the ingoing modes remain positive frequency
modes with respect to the x light cone coordinate even
Ox x2 contains the vacuum contribution of the in-
going modes and it is a consequence of the short-range
repulsion of bosons 16 On the other hand no specic
signal appears for pair of points on the same side of the
horizon
The position of the valley has a transparent physical
interpretation at all times pairs of Hawking phonons
almost simultaneously emerge from the horizon region
and propagate into the sub- and super-sonic regions at
speeds respectively cr  v and v cl After a propagation
time t the initial quantum correlation then reects into
a density correlation between x  cr  vt and x 
v  clt The valley-shaped feature is immediately
recovered once we integrate over all possible values of
t The width of the valley is proportional to the inverse
of the surface gravity k1 and it provides a simple way
of estimating the Hawking temperature of the emission
Note that under the hydrodynamic assumption the width
is much larger than the healing length 
The contribution of mode back-scattering here ne-
glected quickly vanishes in the hydrodynamic limit the
corresponding terms are in fact of higher order in k Al-
though all our predictions have been obtained for the
simplest conguration the behavior of the correlation
function at late t  k1 times can be shown to be
generic and independent on the details of the horizon
formation process 7
We conclude by providing quantitative estimations of
the Hawking signal for parameters inspired to an existing
guided Rb-atom laser experiment 25 For such systems
we can consider ow speeds on the order of v  4 mms
and sound speed modulations such that clv  07 and
crv  15 which implies that the healing length  is
on the order of 02 m A value 2x0  6  12 m for
the thickness of the modulation region is expected to be
enough to fulll the hydrodynamic assumption Insert-
ing these values into the expression for TH one obtains
a quite low 24 Hawking temperature in the TH  4 nK
range For a reasonable value of the diluteness param-
eter n1D  10 the maximum of the density correla-
1D  25  104
tion signal 8 turns out to be G1D
However as our predictions follow from quantum hydro-
dynamics their validity goes beyond weakly interacting
BECs and in particular in one dimension they extend to a
generic Luttinger liquid 13 stronger correlation signals
can therefore be observed in stronger interacting systems
where the diluteness parameter is smaller
Furthermore
its peculiar valley shape should allow
to isolate its contribution on top of the background of
thermal uctuations 35 and experimental noise To
this purpose several detection schemes have been de-
veloped during recent years to experimentally char-
acterize local density uctuations in ultracold atomic
gases 17 18 19 some of which are able to resolve even
individual atoms 20 To overcome the atomic shot-
noise one may take advantage of the large number of
atoms that are available in the quasi-CW atom laser
beam 25 26
In summary we have shown that the gravitational
analogy predicts a characteristic peak in the density-
density correlation function in a owing atomic Bose-
Einstein condensate in the presence of a horizon
the quantum correlation within the pairs of Hawking
phonons reects into long-ranged density correlations
that extend far from the horizon This constitutes a
promising signature to detect and isolate the Hawking
emission of phonons from acoustic black holes
