RUIN PROBABILITIES FOR RISK PROCESSES WITH
NON-STATIONARY ARRIVALS AND SUBEXPONENTIAL
LINGJIONG ZHU
Abstract In this paper we obtain the nite-horizon and innite-horizon ruin
probability asymptotics for risk processes with claims of subexponential tails
for non-stationary arrival processes that satisfy a large deviation principle
As a result the arrival process can be dependent non-stationary and non-
renewal We give three examples of non-stationary and non-renewal point
processes Hawkes process Cox process with shot noise intensity and self-
correcting point process We also show some aggregate claims results for these
three examples
1 Introduction
Let us consider a classical risk model
Ut  u  pt 
where Ci are iid claims distributed as an R-valued random variable C p  0 is
the premium rate u  0 is the initial reserve and Nt is a simple point process
We are interested in the case when Ci have heavy tails A distribution function
B is subexponential ie B  S if
PC1  C2  x
PC1  x
x
ECR x
where C1 C2 are iid
random variables with distribution function B Let us
denote Bx  PC1  x and let us assume that EC1   and dene B0x 
0 Bydy where F x  1  F x is the complement of any distribution
function F x In the paper the notation f x  gx means limx
Goldie and Resnick 1988 showed that if B  S and satises some smoothness
conditions then B belongs to the maximum domain of attraction of either the
Frechet distribution or the Gumbel distribution In the former case B is regularly
varying ie Bx  Lxx1 for some   0 and we write it as B  R  1
  0 where L  R  R is a slowly varying function ie limx
Lx  1
for any   0
gx  1
We assume that B0  S and either B  R  1 or B  G ie the maximum
domain of attraction of Gumbel distribution x  expex A distribution

of attraction of Gumbel distribution G consists of the distribution functions F so
that there exist an  0 bn  R such that limn nF anx  bn  ex x  R G

Ti  i  i1 is the length of the time interval between two consecutive arrival
times of the point process i1 and i i stands for the ith arrival time of the point
process If Ti are iid with mean ET1 then Nt is a renewal process and assume
the usual net prot condition

The extensions when Nt is not a renewal process has been studied in Asmussen et al
1999 when the authors consider a risk process with regenerative structures or a
stationary and ergodic process satisfying certain conditions See also Araman and Glynn
2006 Schlegel 1998 and Zwart et al 2005
But in general for a simple point process Nt we may not have a regenerative
structure and it may not be stationary and ergodic as assumed in Asmussen et al
1999 For example none of the examples that we will introduce later in Section
3 are stationary or have a regenerative structure In this paper we point out that
the classical innite-horizon ruin probability estimate 15 and also nite-horizon
ruin probabiliy estimate still hold as long as there exists a large deviation principle
for Ntt   which is the main result of this paper ie Theorem 3 and Theorem
8 in Section 21 The intuition behind it is that if the arrival times deviate away
from its mean with an exponentially small probability it will be dominated by the
subexponential distributions of the claim sizes Our proof is essentially based on
checking the conditions proposed in Asmussen et al 1999
In Section 22 we review some known results about estimates of aggregate claims
when Nt is not necessarily renewal and show that a condition is satised given the
large deviation principle of Ntt  
Finally
in Section 3 we give three examples of non-renewal processes
Hawkes process which answers a question of Stabile and Torrisi 2010 Cox pro-
cess with shot noise intensity which reproves a result that is known see Asmussen and Albrecher
2010 and self-correcting point process for which our results apply

21 Ruin Probabilites Before we proceed recall that a sequence PnnN of
probability measures on a topological space X satises the large deviation principle
LDP with rate function I  X  R if I is non-negative lower semicontinuous and
for any measurable set A we have

Here Ao is the interior of A and A is its closure See Dembo and Zeitouni 1998
or Varadhan 1984 for general background regarding large deviations and the ap-
plications Also Varadhan 2008 has an excellent survey article on this subject
The following assumption is the main assumption of this paper
Assumption 1 i Ntt   satises a large deviation principle with rate func-
tion I such that Ix  0 if and only if x  
ii Ix is increasing on   and decreasing on 0

sequence by using ergodic theorem And that is the only place Asmussen et al
1999 used the stationarity and ergodicity assumption That is why as long as we
can prove Lemma 1 we can drop the stationarity and ergodicity assumption The
following is the main assumption for the asymptotic results of ruin probabilities
that we are going to establish in this paper
We have the following asymptotic estimates for innite-horizon ruin probabilities

Remark 4 In Theorem 3 we can replace the large deviation assumption of Ntt 
 by a large deviation assumption of  1
i1 Ti   But usually if Ntt   sat-
ises a large deviation principle with rate function Ix if and only if  1
i1 Ti 
 satises a large deviation principle with rate function xI1x The reason we
chose to assume the large deviation for Ntt   in Assumption 1 is because when
Nt is not renewal the inter-occurrence times are not iid and it is usually eas-
ier and more natural to establish the large deviation for Ntt   which is at
least in the case of our three examples Hawkes process Cox process with shot noise
intensity and self-correcting point process
Next let us consider the nite-horizon ruin probabilities

u z  Pu  z

22 Aggregate Claims Let At  PNt

t we have

Remark 9 Indeed Kluppelberg and Mikosch 1997 proved a slightly stronger re-
sult which says 222 holds assuming that the claim sizes Ci are iid with a
distribution function F  ERV   for some 1       where ERV
denotes the space of extended regular varying functions
It is usually easy to check i and also under the assumptions in Theorem 3
t   and Ntt   satises a large deviation principle with rate function Ix
which is nonzero if and only if x 6  Therefore if we assume we could prove that
t   as t   then ii is satised Moreover iii can be replaced by

3 Examples of Non-Renewal Arrival Processes
31 Example 1 Hawkes Process Hawkes process is a simple point process
that has self-exciting property clustering eect and long memory
It was rst
introduced by Hawkes 1971 and has been widely applied in nance seismology
neuroscience DNA modelling and many other elds A simple point process Nt is
a linear Hawkes process if it has intensity
t   X t
ht   
h  0   0  is integrable and khkL1  1 We also assume that Nt
starts with empty past history ie N  0  0 By our denition the Hawkes
process is non-stationary and is in general even non-Markovian unless h is an
exponential function Also it does not have a regenerative structure Thus the
conditions in Asmussen and Albrecher 2010 do not apply here
Notice that it is well known that see for example Daley and Vere-Jones 2003

and Bordenave and Torrisi 2007 proved the a large deviation principle for Ntt

to study the ruin probabilities with subexponential claims when the arrival process
is a non-stationary linear Hawkes process

Remark 14 Indeed the large deviations for nonlinear Hawkes processes have been
established in Zhu 2011a and Zhu 2011b Unlike linear Hawkes processes the
rate function for the large deviations for nonlinear Hawkes processes are less explicit
and it is therefore more dicult to check if it satises the conditions in this paper
This has to be left for future investigations
32 Example 2 Cox Process with Shot Noise Intensity We consider a Cox
process Nt with intensity t that follows a shot noise process
t  t  X 1t
gt   1
where  1 are the arrival times of an external homogenous Poisson process with
0 gtdt   and t is a
intensity  Here g  R  R is integrable ie R 
positive continuous deterministic function such that t   as t  
The ruin probabilities for heavy-tailed claims with arrival process being a shot
noise Cox process is known in the literature eg see the book by Asmussen and Albrecher
2010 But the techniques in the literature use the very specic features of shot
noise Cox process and the proofs are much longer Our proof essentially only needs
the large deviation result for Ntt   which is very easy to establish
Since N 1 is a Poisson process with intensity  by the denition of t it is easy
to see that

It is not clear to the author if the large deviation result for Ntt   is known
in the literature For the sake of completeness let us establish the large deviation
principle here

33 Example 3 Self-Correcting Point Process A self-correcting point pro-
cess also known as the stress-release model is a simple point process N with empty

The rate function   R  R is continuous and increasing such that

Notice that in the denition of intensity in 321 we used Nt instead of Nt That
is crucial to guarantee that the intensity t for the self-correcting point process is
Ft-predictable
The model was rst introduced by Isham and Westcott 1979 as an example
of a process that automatically corrects a deviation from its mean Later it was
studied as a model in seismology The stress builds up at the linear rate 1 in our
model and releases by the amount 1 at ith jump Vere-Jones 1988 discussed an
insurance interpretation

of large numbers of Ntt and nally iii of Assumption 2 can be veried by easily
checking the rate function in Lemma 18
