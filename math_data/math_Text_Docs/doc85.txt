Abstract
It appears dicult to construct a simple model for an open universe based on the
one bubble inationary scenario The reason is that one needs a large mass to avoid
the tunneling via the Hawking Moss solution and a small mass for successful slow-
rolling However Rubakov and Sibiryakov suggest that the Hawking Moss solution
is not a solution for the false vacuum decay process because it does not satisfy the
boundary condition Hence we have reconsidered the arguments for the defect of the
simple polynomial model We point out the possibility that one of the valley bounce
belonging to a valley line in the functional space represents the decay process instead
of the Hawking Moss solution Under this presumption we show an open ination
model can be constructed within the polynomial form of the potential so that the
uctuations can be reconciled with the observations

1 Introduction
Recent observations suggest the matter density of the universe is less than the critical density
Hence it is desirable to have a model for an open universe say 0  03 The realization of
an open universe is dicult in the ordinary inationary scenario This is because if the universe
expands enough to solve the horizon problem the universe becomes almost at One attempt
to realize an open universe in the inationary scenario is to consider inside the bubble created
by the false vacuum decay 1 The scenario is as follows Consider the potential which has
two minimum One is the false vacuum which has non-zero energy and the other is the true
vacuum Initially the eld is trapped at the false vacuum Due to the potential energy universe
expands exponentially and the large fraction of the universe becomes homogeneous As the false
vacuum is unstable it decays and creates the bubble of the true vacuum If the decay process is
well suppressed the interior of the bubble is still homogeneous The decay is described by the
O4 symmetric conguration in the Euclidean spacetime Then analytical continuation of this
conguration to the Lorentzian spacetime describes the evolution of the bubble which looks from
the inside like an open universe Unfortunately since the bubble radius cannot be greater than
the Hubble radius the created universe is curvature dominated even if the whole energy of the
false vacuum is converted to the energy of the matter inside the bubble 2 Thus the second
ination in the bubble is needed
If this second ination stopped when   1 our universe
becomes homogeneous open universe
Though the basic idea is simple the realization of the scenario in a simple model has been
recognized dicult 3 The diculty is usually explained as follows Consider the model involv-
ing one scalar eld For the polynomial form of the potential like V   m22  3  4
the tunneling should occur at suciently large  to ensure that the second ination gives the
appropriate density parameter Then the curvature around the barrier which separates the false
and the true vacuum is small compared with the Hubble scale which is determined by the energy
of the false vacuum The eld jumps up onto the top of the barrier due to the quantum diusion
When the eld begins to roll down from the top of the barrier large uctuations are formed due
to the quantum diusion at the top of the barrier Then the whole scenario fails The problem is
rather generic To avoid jumping up the curvature around the barrier should be large compared
with the Hubble scale V   H 2 On the other hand to realize the second ination the eld
should roll down slowly then we need V   H 2 These two conditions are incompatible
There are several attempts to overcome the problem Recently Linde constructs the potential
which has sharp peak near the false vacuum 4 In this potential the tunneling occurs and at the
same time slow-rolling is allowed after the tunneling then the second ination can be realized
But it is still unclear what is the physical mechanism for the appearance of the sharp peak in
the potential
A more detailed study of the tunneling process is needed to tackle the problem
imaginary-time path-integral formalism the tunneling is described by the solution of the Eu-
clidean eld equation The solution gives the saddle-point of the path-integral Then the solution
determines the semi-classical exponent of the decay rate expSEB where SE is the Euclidean
action In the case the curvature around the barrier is small compared with the Hubble the so-
lution is given by the Hawking Moss HM solution which stays at the top of the barrier through
the whole Euclidean time 5 Recently Rubakov and Sibiryakov give the interpretation of the HM
solution in the de Sitter spacetime using the constrained instanton method 6 7 They show the
HM solution does not represent the false vacuum decay This is because the HM solution does not
satisfy the boundary condition that the eld exists in the false vacuum at the innite past One
should consider a family of the almost saddle-point congurations instead of the true solution
of the Euclidean eld equation They show although the decay rate is determined by the HM
solution the structure of the eld after tunneling is determined by the other conguration which
is one of the almost saddle-point solutions In the constrained instanton method one introduces
the constraint to dene the subspace in the functional space and looks for the almost saddle-point
solution One must choose the constraint so that the almost saddle-point solution is contained
in the region which is expected to dominate the path-integral One way is to consider the valley
region of the functional space 8 9 Along the valley line the action varies most gently Then it
is reasonable to take a conguration on the valley line as the almost saddle-point conguration
We will call the conguration on the valley line the valley bounce V 
Their analysis opens up a new possibility to overcome the problem Suppose that one of
the valley bounces describes the tunneling and the inside of the bubble created from this valley
bounce is our open universe The initial condition of the tunneling eld in the open universe is
determined by the valley bounce If the eld appears suciently far from the top at the nucleation
the large uctuations can be avoided During the tunneling uctuations of the tunneling eld
are generated These uctuations are stretched during the second ination and observed in the
open universe
In this paper we extend the valley method developed by Aoyamaetal 9 to the de Sitter
spacetime Taking the assumption that one of the valley bounces describes the tunneling and
inside the bubble created from the valley bounce is our universe the uctuations generated during
the tunneling are calculated by dening the uctuations which are relevant to the observable in
the open universe as those orthogonal to the gradient of the action Then we show an open
universe can be constructed from the valley bounce and the uctuations can be generated with
the appropriate properties The paper is organized as follows
In the next section we review
the formalism to describe the false vacuum decay in the de Sitter spacetime Then we explain
the role of the congurations on the valley of the action ie valley bounces We derive the
valley equation which determines the valley bounce In section 3 we solve the valley equation
analytically using the piece-wise quadratic potential and xed background approximation Then
the structure of the valley is shown In section 4 we explain the scenario emphasizing the role of
the valley bounce and show that a simple model for an open universe can be constructed without
introducing the ne-tuning of the potential In section 5 we calculate observable uctuations in
the open universe from the valley bounce The power spectrum of the curvature perturbations is
calculated and these uctuations are shown to be compatible with the observations In section
6 we summarize the results
2 Valley method in de Sitter spacetime
First we review the formalisms which are necessary to describe the false vacuum decay in
the de Sitter space We want to examine the case in which the gravity comes to play a role
Unfortunately we have not known how to deal with quantum gravity eect yet So we study
the case in which we can treat gravity at the semi-classical level That is we treat the problem
within the framework of the eld theory in a xed curved spacetime 6 The potential relevant
to the tunneling is given by
V     VT 
We assume  is of the order M 4
 and VT  is of the order M 4 We study the case M is small
compared to M M  M Then the geometry of the spacetime is xed to the de Sitter spacetime
with H  M 2
p  8G3 We consider the situation in which the potential VT 
has the false vacuum at   F and the top of the barrier at   T  Since the background
metric is xed we can change the origin of the energy freely We choose VT F   0 Following
we work in units with H  1
 Mp where M 2
The decay rate is given by the imaginary part of the path-integral
Z  Z d exp SE
where SE is the Euclidean action relevant to the tunneling The dominant contribution of this
path-integral is given by the congurations which have O4 symmetry 10 So we assume the
background metric and the eld to have the form
ds2  d2  a2cid16d2  sin2 dcid17 
  
where a  sin  Then the Euclidean action of  is given by
SE  22Z dcid18a3cid181
2  VT cid19cid19 
The saddle-point of this path-integral is determined by the Euclidean eld equation SE0
We impose the regularity conditions at the time when a  0 as
  3 cot    V 
T   0
  0      0
We represent the solution of this equation as B If the uctuations around the solution have
a negative mode it gives the imaginary part to the path-integral and this solution contributes to
the decay dominantly The decay rate  is evaluated by
  expSEB
If the
The equation has two types of the solutions depending on the shape of the potential
curvature around the barrier is large compared with the Hubble scale then the Coleman De
Luccia CD solution and the Hawking Moss HM solution exist 5 10 Since the CD solution
has lower action than that of the HM solution the decay is described by the CD solution The
analytic continuation of this solution to Lorentzian spacetime describes the bubble of the true
vacuum On the other hand in the case the curvature around the barrier is small compared with
the Hubble scale only the HM solution exists This solution is a trivial solution   T  The
meaning of the HM solution is somewhat ambiguous There are several attempts to interpret this
tunneling mode One way is to use the stochastic approach 12 It has been demonstrated that
the decay rate given by eq7 coincides with the probability of jumping from the false vacuum
F onto the top of the barrier T due to the quantum uctuations
Recently Rubakov and Sibiryakov gave the interpretation of the HM solution using the con-
strained instanton method 6 7 The main idea is to consider a family of the almost saddle-point
congurations instead of the true solution of the Euclidean eld equation ie the HM solution
The motivation comes from the boundary condition They take the boundary condition that
the state of the quantum uctuations above the classical false vacuum is the conformal vacuum
For this boundary condition they show the eld should not be constant at 0     and the
HM solution is excluded by this boundary condition Then one should seek the other congura-
tions which obey the boundary condition and dominantly contribute to the path-integral In the
functional integral the saddle-point solution gives the most dominant contribution but the con-
tribution from a family of almost saddle-point congurations which have almost the same action
with that of the saddle-point solution should also be included To seek the almost saddle-point
solution one introduces the constraint to the path integral The constraint selects the subspace
of the functional space The minimum in this subspace satises the equation of motion with
constraint instead of the eld equation This minimum corresponds to the almost saddle-point
conguration which is slightly deformed from the HM solution Since the HM solution gives the
minimum action the decay rate is determined by the HM solution But the structure of the eld
after tunneling can be determined by the one of the almost saddle-point conguration They
found that the conguration describes the bubble of the true vacuum in the Lorentzian space-
time Then they conclude that even in the case only the HM solution exists the result of the
tunneling process can be the bubble of the true vacuum which is described by one of the almost
saddle-point congurations
In the constrained instanton method the validity of the method depends on the choice of the
constraint 9 13 We should choose the constraint so that the almost saddle-point solution is
contained in the region which is expected to dominate the path-integral Since the action varies
most gently along the valley line we consider the valley region of the action 8 9
In the false vacuum decay process in the at spacetime the congurations along the valley
line have physical meanings 14 These congurations actually dominate the path-integral in the
presence of the low energy incoming particles If the incoming particles exist the path-integral
which describes the decay is given by R dq expSE The eect of the incoming particles
deforms the saddle-point As long as the energy of these incoming particles is low the deformed
congurations belong to the valley This is because in deforming the congurations from the
saddle-point solution the congurations on the valley line can be obtained most easily compared
with the other congurations with the same action Thus the congurations on the valley play
a crucial role to calculate the decay rate or the cross section when the initial state is of higher
energy than the ground state In the de Sitter space time the choice of the quantum states of
the quantum uctuations above a given classical false vacuum will aect the tunneling process
considerably 6 Hence we think the congurations on the valley line in the de Sitter spacetime
may also play an important role though it is not easy to identify the corresponding quantum
Taking into account the above fact it is desirable to analyze the structure of not only the
solution of the Euclidean eld equation but also the congurations on the valley line One way to
ned the congurations on this valley line is to use the valley method developed by Aoyamaetal
9 To obtain the intuitive understanding of this method consider the system of the eld i
Here i stands for the discretized coordinate label and we take the metric as ij In the valley
method the equation which identies the valley line in the functional space is given by
DijiS   iS Dij  ijS
where i  i Since the equation 8 has one parameter  the equation denes a trajectory
in the space of  The parameter  is one of the eigen value of the matrix Dij On the trajectory
the gradient vector iS is orthogonal to all the eigenvectors of Dij except for the eigenvector of
the eigen value  The equation can be rewritten as
icid181
jS2  Scid19  0
Then the solution extremizes the norm of the gradient vector iS under the constraint S const
where  plays the role of the Lagrange multiplier Such solution can be found each hypersurface
of constant action then the solutions of the equation form a line in the functional space If we
take  as the one with the smallest value then the gradient vector is minimized and the action
varies most gently along this line This is a plausible denition of the valley line We will call the
conguration on the valley line of the action the valley bounce V and the trajectory they form
the valley trajectory
We shall formulate the valley method in the de Sitter spacetime The most convenient way is
to use the variational method eq9 We shall dene the valley action by
SV  SE 
2 Z dg  1

The valley bounce is obtained by varying the action SV  The equation which determines the
valley bounce SV   0 is a fourth order dierential equation We introduce the auxiliary eld
f to cancel the fourth derivative term 14
2 Z dg f

Then the valley action becomes
SV  Sf  SE 
2 Z dgf 2 
 Z df
Taking the variation of this action with respect to f and  we obtain the equations for  and f

Using a  sin  the valley equation which determines the structure of the valley bounce is
given by
  3 cot    V

T f  f
The uctuations around the valley bounce can be expanded by the eigenmodes gn with the
eigenvaluen of the operator S 2

T gn  ngn
Since  is one of the n with the smallest value the gradient of the action f  is orthogonal to
the other eigenmodes with n 6  To ensure that the valley bounce gives the imaginary part to
the path-integral the uctuations around the valley bounce should have one negative eigenvalue
In the next section we solve the valley equation and clarify the structure of the valley bounce
Solving the valley equation is the eigenvalue problem of the two variables it is desirable to solve
the equation analytically to conrm the existence of the solutions The valley bounce can have
a thick-wall prole In the at spacetime there exists the attempt to treat thick-wall solutions
analytically by constructing the piece-wise quadratic potentials 11
In the next section we
extend the attempt to the de Sitter spacetime and solve not only the Euclidean eld equation
but also the valley equation analytically
3 Valley bounces
31 The construction of Valley bounces
To solve the valley equation developed in the last section we construct the piece-wise quadratic
potential We connect two parabola In the potential the true vacuum is absent But this is
not essential in calculations In fact we have solved numerically the valley equation for several
potentials and found this model is sucient to discuss the generic feature of the valley bounce
The potential which we study is
VT   
F   F 2
T   T 2  
    0
0    
where  is of the order M 4 We require that the potential and its derivative are connected
smoothly at the connection point   0 From this condition we obtain
T  
F  vuut
T and F have a mass scale of the order M 2mT  Thus we rescale the eld as   M 2mT 
and f  M 2mT f 
First we solve the Euclidean eld equation
If one puts z   cos  and Y z  1  z2  i the equation reduces to the associated
Legendre dierential equation

Here i  T for     0 and i  F for 0     The independent solutions of the
equation are given by the associated Legendere function of the rst and second kinds P 1
iz and

 z is regular at z  1 Since these functions behave at z  1 as
 z  212 sin11  z12
z  212 cos1  z12
the combination of these solutions

F z

where Bz0  0 Since the potential is constructed to be smooth to its rst derivative we
demand B and its rst derivative must be continuous at z  z0 Then the coecients Ai are
determined in terms of z0

The junction time z0 is determined by Bz0  0
F P 1
T z0B2
F z0  T P 2
T z0B1
F z0  0
If the algebraic equation for z0 has a solution this gives the CD solution The condition for the
existence of the solution restricts the parameter mi We see this condition is approximately given
Next we shall solve the valley equation Equation for f is given by
f   3 cot  f   V 
T f  f
The regularity conditions are the same with that of  Then the general solution which satises
the boundary conditions is given by

Note that in this model the deformation of the congurations is essentially determined by z If
z  z0 Gi becomes 0 so V  B as expected
To ensure that the valley bounce plays a role instead of the true saddle point solution we
must examine the uctuations around the valley bounce have one negative mode and give the
imaginary part to the path-integral The equation which determines the eigenmodes is given by
g
n  3 cot  g

Then the eigenvalue equation which determines the eigenvalue n of these eigenmodes becomes
T n

F n
z  0
Note that  is one of the solutions n
We should treat separately the case in which the valley bounce exists around the top of the
barrier and passes through only one parabola We put the solution for f as
bn cos n
then the equation for f is rewritten as 15
Xn0cid16n  1n  2  m2
T  bn1  n  1n  2  m2
T  bn1cid17 sin n  0
Thus bn converges only when

32 The structure of the valley
Using the analytic solution of  and f  we show the structure of the valley Remember that we
have rescaled the eld as   M 2mT  and f  M 2mT f  Following for completeness we
consider the two types of the potential 1m2
T  4 and 2m2
T  7 m2
There exist two solutions in the Euclidean eld equation the CD solution and the HM solution
For example we take m2
F  22 and   06M 4 Fig1 The behaviors of the CD solution
 the eigenmode with the negative eigenvalue g and the scale factor a are shown in
Fig2 The CD solution has one negative eigenvalue CD  47 and the smallest positive
eigenvalue is CD  3 Since the CD solution gives the saddle-point of the path-integral we
analyze the valley trajectory which contains the CD solution At the CD solution on the valley
trajectory f  0 The valley bounce near the CD solution is obtained by deforming the CD
solution V  CD  V  The deformation V is due to the source term f 6 0 in the
equation for  The equation for f is almost the same with that for the eigenmode g at the CD
solution Thus  is given by   CD   To ensure the action varies most gently along the
valley trajectory CD should be the eigenvalue of the smallest value In this case CD has one
negative eigenvalue so we take  at the CD solution as CD  CD or CD  CD
First examine the valley trajectory associated with the negative eigenvalue CD  CD
The valley bounce obtained from the analytic results developed in the previous section is shown
in the lower-panel of Fig3 Since CD is the lowest eigenvalue f does not have a node In
the equation for  f acts as the force So the valley bounce in this trajectory is obtained by
deforming the CD solution adding a one-direction force f  If f  0 the valley bounce has a
structure of the small bubble and if f  0 it has a structure of the large bubble 14 We plot the
action along this trajectory in lower-panel of Fig4 The CD solution gives the maximum of the
action
Next consider the valley trajectory associated with the smallest positive eigenvalue CD 
CD We show the valley bounce in this trajectory in the upper panel of Fig3 Since CD
is the next to the lowest eigenvalue f has one node In the equation for  f acts as the mass
term of  So in this trajectory the valley bounce is obtained by modifying the mass of the eld
 It is known that the CD solution is smoothly connected to the HM solution if one decreases
the mass around the top of the barrier 16 Then it is expected that this trajectory connects
the CD solution and the HM solution The action along this valley trajectory is shown in the
upper-panel of Fig4 Since the degeneracy occurs in  we take the horizontal coordinate as the
norm of the solution   q22R a3  T 2 14 We see the CD solution is the minimum
and the HM solution is the maximum of the action and these solutions are smoothly connected
on this trajectory as expected
The saddle point solution is the HM solution For example we take m2
F  05
and   01M 4 Fig5 The HM solution has one negative eigenvalue HM  2 and the
T  2 m2
smallest positive eigenvalue is given by HM  2 The generic feature of the valley bounce
is understood by the simple analysis of the case in which the valley bounce exists only in one
parabola First consider the valley trajectory associated with the negative eigenvalue The
solution of the valley equation is essentially has a form f    T   const This solution
does not represent the tunneling so we seek the trajectory associated with the smallest positive
eigenvalue HM   HM The solution of the valley equation is given by   T  cos 
and f    T  Fig6 In this trajectory the HM solution gives the minimum of the action
Fig7 The action grows as the variation of the eld becomes large but the increase is relatively
gentle
The uctuations around the valley bounce should have one negative mode to ensure that the
valley bounce plays a role instead of the HM solution The valley bounce has a lowest eigenvalue
V  V  which is negative on this trajectory Since this is the unique negative eigenvalue
the gaussian integration of the uctuations around this valley bounce gives the imaginary part to
the path-integral Then the valley bounce contributes to the false vacuum decay and describes
the creation of the bubble of the true vacuum
4 An open universe from valley bounce
Using the results developed so far we will study a model for an open universe inside the bubble
Since the radius of the bubble R is small compared with the Hubble horizon 10 then the
curvature scale is greater than the energy of the matter inside the bubble M even if the whole
p  H 2  1R2 2
energy of the false vacuum is converted to the energy of the matter M M 2
Thus we need the second ination in the bubble To realize the second ination inside the bubble
the eld should roll slowly down the potential It requires that the curvature of the potential
is small compared with the Hubble To avoid the ad hoc ne-tuning of the potential we will
assume the requirement is satised for all region of the potential Since mT  H the solution
of the Euclidean eld equation is given by the HM solution If the tunneling is described by the
HM solution the eld appears at the top of the barrier Then large uctuations are generated
because at the top of the barrier the eld experiences the quantum diusion rather than the
classical potential force Fluctuations in this diusion dominated epoch make the inhomogeneous
delay of the start of the classical motion thus make large uctuations
The above argument is based on the assumption that the HM solution describes the false
vacuum decay However it seems to be possible that one of the valley bounces describes the
decay instead of the HM solution One of the grounds is that in the de Sitter spacetime the
choice of the quantum states of the quantum uctuations above the false vacuum will aect the
tunneling process considerably 6 In the de Sitter spacetime one has to specify the state of
the quantum uctuations of the eld besides specifying the classical vacuum which is the average
value of the eld ie F  The dominant conguration in the path-integral depends on the initial
state of the quantum uctuations above the false vacuum In case of the at spacetime if the
initial state is of higher energy than the ground state the dominant conguration is given by one
of the valley bounces instead of the bounce solution 14 Thus it seems natural to consider the
situation in which one of the valley bounces describes the tunneling and inside the created bubble
is our universe although it is dicult to identify the quantum state corresponding to the valley
bounce Hence we take the presumption that one of the valley bounces describes the tunneling
and inside the bubble created from the valley bounce is our universe
A problem about the assumption that an individual valley bounce describes the tunneling is
the interpretation of the valley bounce in the Lorentzian spacetime Our interpretation is that the
valley bounce determines the initial condition of the tunneling eld in the open universe Within
the xed background approximation we can make analytic continuation about the background
geometry from the Euclidean de Sitter space 3 see Fig8 By the analytic continuation
we obtain the Lorenzian de Sitter spacetime Region II
  i  2   
ds2  d2  a2cid16d 2  cosh2  d2cid17 
We take the nucleation surface at   0 Region II is almost covered by the false vacuum Then
we assume the eect which modies the dominant conguration from the HM solution to the
valley bounce also modies the classical motion of the eld in this region The eld obeys the
equation analytically continued from the valley equation 14 The solution of the equation is
given by the analytic continuation of the valley bounce On the other hand because the bubble
expands classically at a velocity rapidly approaching the velocity of light inside the expanding
bubble is well described by the usual classical equation of motion On the light-cone of the center
of the bubble    the coordinate is singular a  0 We continue to the interior of the
light-cone Region I by
The resulting metric is given by
r    i
t  i  
ds2  dt2  bt2cid16dr2  sinh2 rd2cid17 
The expanding bubble is homogeneous and isotropic on the hypersurface on the hyperbolic time
slicing t  const The interior of the light-cone can be viewed as an open Friedman-Robertson-
Walker universe with scale factor bt The initial condition of the tunneling eld on t  0
hypersurface is determined by the behavior of valley bounce at    After that time the
evolution of the eld is described by the classical eld equation
Under these assumptions we will construct a model for an open ination in the simple model
with the polynomial form of the potential We connect the linear potential at the point the eld
appears after the tunneling

In the small t this behaves as 143t The classical motion during one expansion time is given
by  H 1 On the other hand the amplitude of the quantum uctuations is given by   H
The curvature perturbation R produced by the quantum uctuations is approximately given by
the ratio of these two quantities

This should be of the order 105 from the observation of the cosmic microwave background CMB
anisotropies If   T  H as in the case the HM solution describes the tunneling R  1
and the scenario cannot work well Fortunately from Fig7 we see for appropriate  the valley
bounce gives the initial condition as   T  O1M 2mT  which is larger than the Hubble
if M  H For this initial condition the potential force works and the eld rolls slowly down the
potential according to eq50 We expect the curvature perturbation can be suppressed for the
valley bounce
5 Fluctuations in the open universe
In this section we will calculate the observable uctuations in the open universe from the valley
bounce based on a model described in the previous section We will assume the decay is described
by one of the valley bounces 0 Then we take one specic  in the following calculations Under
this assumption we calculate the observable uctuations in the open universe
51 Fluctuations around the valley bounce
We rst calculate the uctuations around the valley bounce in the Euclidean spacetime The
Euclidean action can be expanded around the valley bounce 0 as

Since the valley bounce does not obey the eld equation then the rst order derivative term does
not vanish This can be avoided by constraining the space of the uctuations to that orthogonal
to the gradient of the action

We must calculate the physical observable like two-point correlation function in the bubble
described by 0 For example consider the variance of the scalar eld h2i  hi2 where h i is
average over  and  Analytically continuing to the Lorentzian spacetime this corresponds to
the average over the space in open universe Since the variables which depend only on  obey
the relation
we can show
h0i  0
hi  
h2i  hi2  h  2i  h  i2
So the observable in the open universe can be evaluated from inhomogeneous uctuations which do
not have O4 symmetric congurations In the de Sitter spacetime inhomogeneous uctuations
are expanded by scalar harmonics
    Z dp SpYplm 
The harmonics obeys the orthogonal relation between dierent p2 Now the gradient vector is
given by f  which is the mode of p2  1 Then the inhomogeneous uctuations which depend
on  and  p2 6 1 are orthogonal to the gradient of the action f  automatically
Fluctuations around the valley bounce 0 obey the eld equation

we assume background eld obeys the equation of motion analytically coninued from the valley
equation Then the uctuations in Region II is obtained by the analytical continuation 45

Thus we will solve the equation 58 analytically continuing to Region II The procedure to solve
the equation is the same with that was done in the previous works 17 18 19 20 We will follow
their calculations Expanding the uctuations as

to the initial quantum state of the uctuations We will take this initial state as Bunch-Davis

to the wall uctuation mode w  CD with sup  2 Although in the present case the corre-
spondence cannot be held the behavior of the supercritical mode resembles the wall uctuation

53 Curvature perturbations in the open universe
In this subsection we restore the Hubble scale H The eld evolves with the classical eld equation
inside the bubble Region I We should match the uctuations 89 93 to the solution of the
eld equation with the background eld satisfying the classical equation of the motion 50
Fluctuations of the scalar eld give rise to a metric perturbations in the open universe So

In some open ination model the contribution of the discrete modes gives the strong constraint
on the model 23 The supercurvature mode produces very large scale metric perturbations and
enhances the amplitude of the low multipoles of the CMB anisotropies No evidence for such
enhancement in the observed spectrum implies that the contribution of these discrete modes
must not dominate the contribution of the continuous modes Furthermore if the amplitude of
the supercurvature modes is large the universe is not open but quasi-open beyond the coherent
length of the supercurvatuer modes 24 In our model however the last factor in the power
spectrum PRi  is O1 see Fig10 then there is no inconsistency with the observed CMB
anisotropies and the universe looks like an innite open universe described by the valley bounce
The harmlessness of the supercurvature mode can be deduced from the analysis of the case
the CD solution describes the tunneling and the thin-wall approximation can be used In this
case the supercritical mode is the wall uctuation mode given by w  Nw CD Here the
normalization constant is given by Nw  R da 2
CD12 Within the thin wall approximation
this can be evaluated as Nw  RS112 where S1 is the surface tension of the wall and R is the
radius of the bubble The surface tension of the wall is estimated by S1  mT 2 where  is
the scale of the variation of the eld during tunneling The curvature perturbation generated from
this wall uctuation is given by R  H CDw  HRS1 Using R  1H and mT  H
this can be estimated as R  H Thus the thickness of the barrier the eld passes during
the tunneling determines the amplitude of the curvature perturbation generated from the wall
uctuation mode In the case the valley bounce describes the tunneling the supercritical mode
can not be interpreted as the wall uctuation mode But the behavior of the supercritical mode
resembles that of the wall uctuation mode Thus we expect this analysis can be applied Since
the valley bounce gives   M 2mT  the contribution of the supercritical mode is suppressed
Then the constraint from the discrete mode is not strong in this model
6 Conclusion
It is dicult to provide the model which solves the horizon problem and at the same time leads
to the open universe in the context of the usual inationary scenario In the one bubble open
inationary scenario the horizon problem is solved by the rst ination and the second ination
creates the universe with the appropriate 0 Many works have been done within this framework
of the scenario and it is recognized this scenario requires additional ne-tuning 3 4 The defect
comes from the fact that the requirement the curvature around the barrier should be larger than
the Hubble scale to avoid large uctuations contradicts to the requirement the curvature of the
potential should be small to realize the second ination inside the bubble Additional constraint
comes from the uctuations generated in the decay process which can be observed and reject
some models 23
In this paper we pointed out a possibility of constructing a model without these diculties by
reconsidering the tunneling process If the curvature around the potential is small the tunneling
is described by one of a family of the almost saddle-point solutions 6 This is because the true
saddle-point solution that is the Hawking Moss solution does not satisfy the boundary condition
for the false vacuum decay A family of the almost saddle-point solutions generally forms a valley
line in the functional space We called the congurations on the valley line valley bounces To
identify the valley bounces we formulated the valley method in the de Sitter spacetime and
claried the structure of the valley bounces In this method the valley bounces can be identied
using the fact the trajectory they form in the functional space corresponds to the line on which
the action varies most gently
Our assumption is that one of the valley bounces describes the creation of the bubble inside
of which is our open universe and determines the initial condition in the open universe Based on
this assumption we found that there occurs the second ination without the large uctuations
even if the curvature around the barrier is small compared with the Hubble scale
The uctuations of the tunneling eld give rise to the metric perturbation These can be
observed in our open universe The uctuations around the valley bounce which are orthogonal
to the gradient of the action are relevant to the observable We calculated the power spectrum
of the metric perturbations generated in the second ination and found these uctuations can
be compatible with the observations In some models of the open ination the discrete mode
of the uctuations gives strong constraint on the model We showed this is not the case in
our model Hence using the valley bounce we can solve the problem which arises in the open
inationary scenario besides the usual ne-tuning of the inationary scenario Then the one
bubble open ination model can be constructed in the simple model with the polynomial form of
the potential
Our conclusion is based on the assumption that an individual valley bounce describes the
tunneling and gives the initial condition of the tunneling eld in the open universe Although
this assumption seems to be plausible we note that further investigations are needed for the
justication of this assumption
