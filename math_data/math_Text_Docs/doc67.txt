Abstract Using the Damour-Runi-Sannan the Parikh-Wilczek and the
thin lm brick-wall models we investigate the Hawking radiation of un-
charged massive particles from 4-dimensional linear dilaton black holes
which are the solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Einstein-Yang-Mills-
Dilaton and Einstein-Yang-Mills-Born-Infeld-Dilaton theories Our results
show that the tunneling rate is related to the change of Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy Contrary to the many studies in the literature here the emission
spectrum is precisely thermal This implies that the derived emission spec-
trum is not consistent with the unitarity of the quantum theory which
would possibly lead to the information loss

1 Introduction
Obeying the laws of black hole mechanics 1 Hawking 23 proved that
a stationary black hole can emit particles from its event horizon with a
temperature proportional to the surface gravity According to this idea the
vacuum uctuations near the horizon would produce a virtual particle pair
similar to electron-positron pair creation in a constant electric eld When
a virtual particle pair is created just inside or outside the horizon the sign
of its energy changes as it crosses the horizon So after one member of the

pair has tunneled to the opposite side the pair can materialize with zero
total energy This discovery also announced the relation between the triple
subjects  the quantum mechanics thermodynamics and the gravitation
After this pioneering study of Hawking many methods have been proposed
to calculate the Hawking radiation for the last three decades
One of the commonly used methods is known as Damour-Runi-Sannan
DRS 45 method This method is applicable to any Hawking temperature
problem in which the asymptotic behaviors of the wave equation near the
event horizon are known
In 2000 Parikh and Wilczek 6 proposed a method based on null geodesics
in order to clarify more the Hawking radiation via tunneling across the event
horizon Namely they treated the Hawking radiation as a tunneling process
and used the WKB approximation to determine the correction spectrum for
the black holes Hawking radiation In their study it is supposed that the
barrier depends on the tunneling particle itself The crucial point of this
method is not to violate the energy conservation during the process of par-
ticle emission and to pass to an appropriate coordinate system at horizon
In general the tunneling process is not precisely a thermal eect and it
explains the modication of the black hole radiation spectrum in which it
leads to the unitarity in the quantum theory 789
Another possible method to study the statistical origin of the black hole
entropy is the brick-wall model initially proposed by tHooft 10 The brick-
wall model identies the black hole entropy by the entropy of a thermal
gas of quantum eld excitations outside the event horizon Since then this
method has been satisfactorily applied to many black hole geometries see
for instance 11 and the references therein Although t Hooft made signif-
icant contribution to clarify the understanding and calculating the entopy
of the black holes there were some drawbacks in his model Those draw-
backs are overcome by the improved form of the original brick-wall model
which is called as thin lm brick-wall model 12 The thin lm brick-wall
model gives us acceptable and net physical meaning of the entropy calcula-
tion In summary since the entropy calculated by the thin lm brick-wall
model is just from a small region thin lm near the horizon this improved
version of the brick-wall model represents explicitly the correlation between
the horizon and the entropy In this study we obtain the ultraviolet cut-o
distance as 90 where  is the Boltzmann factor
Hawking described the black hole radiation as tunneling triggered by the
vacuum uctuations near the horizon His discovery which treats the black
hole radiation as being pure thermal gave also rise to a new paradox in the
black hole physics  the information loss paradox Although Parikh and
Wilczeks tunneling process 6 is a way to overcome the information loss
paradox in the Hawking radiation the information might not be conserved
in some black hole geometries For instance if only the tunneling process
of the outer horizon of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is considered
1314 it can be shown that the information loss is possible The similar
violation in the conservation of information happens in the 4-dimensional
Hawking Radiation of Linear Dilaton Black Holes in Various Theories
linear dilaton black holes LDBHs in various theories and we will explain
its reason by using the dierences in entropies of the black holes before and
after the emission
The paper is organized as follows In section 2 a brief overview of
the 4-dimensional LDBHs in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton EMD Einstein-
Yang-Mills-Dilaton EYMD and Einstein-Yang-Mills-Born-Infeld-Dilaton
EYMBID theories which they have been recently employed in 15
calculating the Hawking radiation via the method of semi-classical radiation
spectrum is given Next we apply the DRS method to nd the temperature
of the LDBHs and the tunneling rate of the chargeless particles crossing
the event horizon Section 3 is devoted to the calculation of the entropy of
the horizon by using all those methods mentioned above As it is expected
they all conclude with the same result Finally we draw our conclusions and
discussions
Throughout the paper the units G  c h kB1 are used
2 LDBHs Calculation of Their Temperature and Tunneling Rate
The line-element of N -dimensional N  4 LDBHs which are static spher-
ically symmetric solutions in various theories EMD EYMD and EYMBID
have been recently summarized by 15 However throughout this paper we
restrict ourselves to the 4-dimensional LDBHs and follow the notations of
Consider a general class of static spherically symmetric spacetime for
the LDBHs as
ds2  f dt2 
 A2rd2
where d2  d2  sin2 d2 Here the metric function f is given by
f  r1 
where r is the radius of the event horizon The coecients  and A in
the metric 1 take dierent values according to the concerned theory
Since the present form of the metric represent asymptotically non-at
solutions one should consider the quasi-local mass denition M of the met-
ric 1 In 15 the relationship between the horizon r and the mass M is
explicitly given as
In the EMD theory 151617 the coecients  and A are found as

where  is a constant related to the electric charge of the black hole
Meanwhile one can match the metric 1 to the LDBHs metric of Clement
etal 17 by setting   r0 Next if one considers the EYMD and EYMBID
theories 1819 the coecients in the metric 1 become

where Q and QC are YM charge and the critical value of YM charge
respectively The existence of the metric 1 in EYMBID theory depends
strictly on the condition 19
Q2  Q2
where  is the Born-Infeld parameter Meanwhile it is not necessary to
say that values of  in equations 4 5 and 6 are always positive
By using the denition of the surface gravity 20 we get
  lim
f r
Since the surface gravity 8 is positive one can deduce that it is directed
towards the singularity As a consequence it is attractive and the matter
can only fall into the black hole This horizon is a future horizon to an
observer who is located outside of it
In curved spacetime a massive test scalar eld  with mass  obeys the
covariant Klein-Gordon KG equation which is given by
 det g
cid16p det ggcid17  2  0
The massive scalar wave equation  in metric 1 can be separated
as   Y  t r in which the radical KG equation 9 satises the
following equation

where l is the angular quantum number In order to change equation
10 into a standard wave equation at the horizon we introduce the tortoise
coordinate transformation which is obtained from

After making the straightforward calculation we nd an appropriate r

Thus one can transform the radical equation 10 into the following

While r  r in which f  0 the transformed radical equation 13
can be reduced to the following standard form of the wave equation as

This form of the wave equation reveals that there are propagating waves
near the horizon The solutions of equation 14 which give us the ingoing
and outgoing waves at the black hole horizon surface r are

When we introduce the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate v 
t  r the line-element 1 of the LDBHs becomes
ds2  f dv2  2dvdr  A2rd2
The present form of the metric does not attribute a singularity to the
horizon so that the ingoing wave equation behaves regularly at the horizon
This yields the solutions of ingoing and outgoing waves at the horizon r
as follows

Now we consider only the outgoing waves Namely
outr  r  eivr  r
which has a singularity at the horizon r Therefore equation 20 can
only describe the outgoing particles outside the horizon and strictly cannot

describe the particles which are inside the horizon In other words the
description of the particles behavior inside horizon has to be made as well
To this end the outgoing wave out should be analytically extended from
outside to the interior of the black hole by the lower half complex r-plane
r  r  r  r ei  r  rei
We can derive the solution of outgoing wave inside the horizon as follows

According to the Damour-Runi-Sannan DRS 45 method it is pos-
sible to calculate the emission rate The total outgoing wave function can
be written in a uniform form

where  is the Heaviside step function and N represents the normal-

One can remark for this section that the resulting temperature 27
obtained from the DRS method is in agreement with the statistical Hawking
temperature 20 computed as usual by dividing the surface gravity by 2

3 Entropy of the Horizon
In this section we shall use three dierent methods in order to show that
they all lead to the same entropy result We rst employ the DRS method
which is worked in detail and obtained remarkable results in the previous
section The second method will be the Parikh-Wilczek method 6 describ-
ing the Hawking radiation as a tunneling process Last method that is also
going to be used in the calculation of the entropy is the thin lm brick-wall
model 12
In the DRS method the emission rate of outgoing particles is found as
in equation 28 Accordingly the probability of emission can be modied
into 1321 and references therein
2 R 
  e R 
T  eSBH 
where SBH is the dierence of Bekenstein-Hawking entropies of the
LDBHs before and after the emission of the particle
On the other hand the novel study on the tunneling eect is designated
by Parikh-Wilczek method 6 which proposes an approach for calculat-
ing the tunneling rate at which particles tunnel across the event horizon
They treated Hawking radiation as a tunneling process and used the WKB
method 9 In classical limit we can also nd the tunneling rate by applying
WKB approximation This relates the tunneling amplitude to the imaginary
part of the particle action at stationary phase and the Boltzmann factor for
emission at the Hawking temperature
In the WKB approximation the imaginary part of the amplitude for
outgoing positive energy particle which crosses the horizon outwards from
initial radius of the horizon rin to the nal radius of the horizon rout could
be expressed by
Im I  ImZ rout
prdr  ImZ rout
rin Z pr
By using the standard quantum mechanics the tunneling rate  is given
in the WKB approximation as 2223
  exp2 Im I
Here we can consider the particle with energy  as a shell of energy and
x the total mass M quasi-local mass and allow the hole mass to uctuate
Then the Hamiltons equation of motion can be used to write dpr  dH
and it can be noted that the horizon moves inwards from M to M   while
a particle emits Introducing H  M   and inserting the value of the
r  dr
2 obtained from the null geodesic equation into 30 we obtain

The r-integral can be done by deforming the contour The deformation
of the integral is based on an assumption that the contour semicircles the
residue in a clockwise fashion In this way one can obtain
Im I  2Z 
So the tunneling rate 31 is
d 
  exp2 Im I  expcid184Z

 cid19  exp SBH  
Our result 34 is consistent with the results of the other works 624
252627
Now we come to the stage to apply the thin lm brick-wall model 12
which was based on the brick wall model proposed rstly by tHooft 10
According to this model the considered eld outside the horizon is assumed
to be non-zero only in a thin lm which exists in a small region bordered
by r   and r     Here  is the ultraviolet cut-o distance and
 is the thickness of the thin lm In summary both  and  are positive
innitesimal parameters This model treats the entropy as being associated
with the eld in the considered small region in which the local thermal
equilibrium and the statistical laws are valid 28 That is why one can work
out the entropy of the horizon by using this model
If one redenes the massive test scalar eld  as being   eitrYlm 
in the KG equation 9 and considers its radial part only the wave vector
is found with the help of WKB approximation as
r1  r
r1  r
r   2 
ll  1
Using the quantum statistical mechanics we calculate the free energy
F  1
 Z 
2l  1
e  1
While integrating equation 36 with respect to l one should consider
the upper limit of integration such that k2 remains positive and the lower
limit becomes zero Briey we get
F  2A2
3 2 Z 
e  1Zr
r  r2 2  2r  r
where  denotes the inverse of the temperature In equation 37 the
integration with respect to r is quite dicult On the other hand the thin
lm brick-wall model imposes us to take only the free energy of a thin layer
near horizon of a black hole and the integration with respect to r must
be limited in the region r    r  r     The natural result of
Hawking Radiation of Linear Dilaton Black Holes in Various Theories
this choice sets the coecient of 2 to zero and whence the integration of
equation 37 with respect to  becomes very simple such that it can be
easily found as 4154 Finally the equation 37 reduces to
F  23A2
 23A2r
454 2 Z r
454 2 Z r
F  23A2r
454 2
r  r2 dr
r  r2 
  
and we can get the entropy
SBH  2 F
83A2r
453 2
  
Since the beta is the inverse of the temperature
and if we select an appropriate cut-o distance  and thickness of thin
lm  to satisfy
  
 90
the total entropy of the horizon becomes
where Ah is the area of the the black hole horizon ie Ah  4A2r
The derivative of the entropy 44 with respect to M is
 A2 r
Getting the integral of M  equation 45 becomes to
SBH Z M 
M  dM   4Z M 
After substituting M   M    into the above equation we obtain
SBH  Z 
M  d  4Z 
One can easily see that equation 47 is nothing but the results obtained
both from Parikh-Wilczek method 34 and the DRS method 29
HPasaoglu ISakalli
On the other hand for the LDBHs the change of the entropy before and
after the radiation is
SBH  SM    SM   
Since equation 48 contains only  we deduce that the spectrum is
precisely thermal In other words the thermal spectrum does not suggest
the underlying unitary theory and whence we can understand that the
conservation of information is violated
4 Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper we have eectively utilized three dierent methods the DRS
model the Parikh-Wilczek model and the thin lm brick wall model to
investigate the Hawking radiation for massive 4-dimensional LDBHs in the
EMD EYMD and EYMBID theories By considering the DRS method the
tunneling probability for an outgoing positive energy particle or simply the
tunneling rate is neatly found Later on it is shown that the tunneling rate
found from the DRS method can be expressed in terms of the dierence
of Bekenstein-Hawking entropies SBH of the black holes Beside this the
other two methods ie the Parikh-Wilczek method and the thin lm brick-
wall model attribute also the same SBH result In the thin lm brick-wall
model the cut-o factor is found to be 90 which is exactly same as in the
calculation of the entropy for the Schwarzschild black hole 29
On the other hand the obtained SBH result shows us that the emis-
sion spectrum is nothing but a pure thermal spectrum This result is not
consistent with the unitarity principle of quantum mechanics It also implies
the violation of the conservation of information in the LDBHs
Finally further application of the Hawking radiation of the charged mas-
sive particles via dierent methods to the case of LDBHs in higher dimen-
sions 15 may reveal more information compared to the present case This
will be our next problem in the near future
