We introduce a model-independent approximation for the branching ratio of Hawkes self-exciting
point processes Our estimator requires knowing only the mean and variance of the event count in a
suciently large time window statistics that are readily obtained from empirical data The method
we propose greatly simplies the estimation of the Hawkes branching ratio recently proposed as a
proxy for market endogeneity and formerly estimated using numerical likelihood maximisation We
employ our new method to support recent theoretical and experimental results indicating that the
best tting Hawkes model to describe SP futures price changes is in fact critical now and in the
recent past in light of the long memory of nancial market activity
I THE SELF-EXCITING HAWKES PROCESS
The Hawkes model 1 2 is a simple and powerful
framework for simulating or modelling the arrival of
events which cluster in time eg earthquake shocks and
aftershocks neural spike trains and transactions on nan-
cial markets In one dimension the model is a counting
process N t with an intensity t the expected num-
ber of events per unit time given by a constant term 
and a self-exciting term which is a function of the event
history
cid90 t
t   
t  sdN s
This self-exciting term gives rise to event clustering
through an endogenous feedback past events contribute
to the rate of future events    0 is the inuence
kernel which decides the weight to attribute to events
which occurred at a lag  in the past The base intensity
 and the kernel shape t are parameters to be varied
A popular choice for the kernel is the exponential func-
tion    e 3 4 but in general the kernel to be
used should depend on the application or the dynamics
of the data to be modelled Note that for t  0 the
model reduces to a Poisson process with constant inten-
sity 
By taking the expectation of both sides of Eq
and assuming stationarity ie a nite average event rate
Et   we can express the average event rate of the
process as   1  n   where n cid82  d  One
can create a direct mapping between the Hawkes process
and the well known branching process 5 in which exoge-
nous mother events occur with an intensity  and may
give rise to x additional endogenous daughter events
where x is drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean
n These in turn may themselves give birth to more
daughter events etc
The value n which corresponds with the integral of
the Hawkes kernel is the branching ratio determines the
behaviour of the model
If n  1 meaning that each
event typically triggers at least one extra event then the
process is non-stationary and may explode in nite time
6 However for n  1 the process is stationary and has
proven useful in modelling the clustered arrival of events
in a wide variety of applications including neurobiology
7 social dynamics 8 9 and geophysics 10 11 The
Hawkes model has also seen many recent applications to
nance 1214 especially as a means of modelling the
very high-frequency events aecting the limit-order book
of nancial exchanges 1519
One novel application of the Hawkes framework to -
nance is as a means of measuring market endogeneity or
reexivity in nancial markets 3 6 In 3 the authors
consider mid-price changes in the E-mini SP Futures
contract between 1998 and 2010 and observe that the
branching ratio n of the best-tting exponential kernel
model has been increasing steadily over this period from
n  025 in 1998 to n  065 in 2010 see our Fig 6 be-
low They argue that this observation implies that the
market has become more reexive in recent years with
the rise of high frequency and algorithmic trading and is
therefore more prone to market instability and so-called
ash crashes
In 20 however we have argued that due to the pres-
ence of long-range dependence in the event rate of mid-
price changes detectable in both 1998 and 2011 as one
extends the window of observation the best tting sta-
tionary Hawkes model must in fact be critical ie have
a branching ratio n  1 This is backed up by theoretical
arguments and empirical measurements on market data
Let us however insist that this conclusion only holds
if one believes that Hawkes processes provide an exact
representation of the reality of markets It is very plau-
sible that the dynamics of markets is more complicated
and involves for example non-linearities absent from
the Hawkes process dened by Eq 1 but that the best
way to represent this dynamics within the framework of
Hawkes processes is to choose n  1 with a long-ranged
inuence kernel
In this article we introduce a simple approximation
for the branching ratio of the Hawkes process which al-
lows us to faithfully reproduce the results of 3 which
proposes the statistic as a measure of market instability
and as a crash prediction metric The interest of our
approximation lies in its great simplicity one need only
estimate the mean and variance of the event count in a
suciently large time window The approximation also
avoids a number of pitfalls 21 inherent to the signi-
cantly more complex approach 4 employed in 3
The estimator accepts one parameter a time window
size W  during which we measure the mean and vari-
ance of the event count We note that when we em-
ploy our estimator to mid-price changes in the SP elec-
tronic futures market with a xed window size W then
the branching ratio estimate obtained increases over time
as reported in 3 If however we allow the window size
to scale appropriately halving in size every 18 months
to adapt to the decreasing latency of interactions on the
market we recover a constant branching ratio estimate
as proposed in 20 This result reiterates the need for a
scale-invariant or at least scale-sensitive means of mea-
suring the reexivity of nancial market events
II MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION
Given observed events eg mid-price changes at
times t1 t2     tn in an interval 0 T  one can t the
Hawkes model by maximising the log-likelihood 4 22
over the set of parameters 
cid90 T
cid90 T
tdt
log Lt1     tn  
log tdN t
In the case of the exponential kernel     
In practice the model parameters    which max-
imise this log-likelihood are obtained with numerical
techniques due to the lack of a closed form solution 1
The branching ratio estimate is then n   
However there are a number of pitfalls to using this
procedure as a means of estimating the Hawkes branching
ratio n cid82  d 21 Arguably the most important of
which is that any estimate of n made in this manner will
be heavily dependent on the choice of kernel model eg
exponential power-law etc It may be that the chosen
model cannot satisfactorily describe the observed events
hence the meaning of the branching ratio extracted from
the maximum likelihood method is questionable
Care must also be taken when employing this method
in the presence of imperfect event data as illustrated in
21 In one of their gures the authors present a neg-
ative log-likelihood surface which features two minima
one local and one global The global log-likelihood
minimum does in fact little more than describe packet
clustering inside the millisecond which arises from the
manner in which events arriving at the exchange at dier-
ent times are bundled and recorded with the same time-
stamp Subsequent randomisation of the timestamps in-
side a short time interval in this case one millisecond
creates a spurious high frequency correlation that makes
the global minimum irrelevant The local log-likelihood
minimum which is in fact a better t to the true lower
frequency dynamics does a poor job at explaining the
spurious high frequency clustering and is punished with
a lower log-likelihood Indeed when the authors of 21
choose to t this local minimum they corroborate results
presented in 20
We believe it is therefore essential to have additional
checks such as non-parametric methods 15 at ones
disposal to support results obtained from likelihood max-
imisation To address the pitfalls in branching ratio es-
timation that arise from the model choice we propose a
simple model-independent tool for branching ratio ap-
proximation in the next section which accurately repro-
duces previous results of 3 and also indicates the criti-
cality of the relevant Hawkes process which describes the
market
III A MEAN-VARIANCE ESTIMATOR FOR
THE BRANCHING RATIO n

transform of the kernel function to the Fourier transform

Therefore to deduce the branching ratio of the sta-

to t the parameters of the Hawkes process for nancial appli-
cations indeed a recent publication 18 proposes a fast albeit
still parametric method for tting the multivariate exponential
Hawkes process
IV NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS 
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
In Fig 1 we test the estimation procedure described in
the previous section on a number of simulated exponen-
tial Hawkes processes with a variety of branching ratios
To do this we x   10 but vary   n in the range
0    095 We choose a base intensity   1  n
such that each process has the same average event rate
  1 We simulate the process for a time T  105 using
simulation Algorithm 1 described in 23 This procedure
is prone to edge eects so we disregard the initial period
of size 104 to ensure the process is close to stationarity
in the period studied
We estimate the branching ratio with a window size
W  20 signicantly larger than the time-scale of corre-
lation of our process 1  1 However the window size
chosen is also suciently small that we have a signicant
number of independent observations m  09  10520
with which to make a reliable estimate of the variance of
NW  We see very good agreement between our branch-
ing ratio estimates and the input branching ratio of the
simulation see Fig 1
Note however that our approximation systematically
underestimates the branching ratio since our nite win-
dow size does not completely cover the region of support
of the autocorrelation function This is particularly vis-
ible in Fig 1 for large n We now investigate the eect
of window size on the estimate obtained

and we nd using Eq 4
where W  W is the average number of events falling
in a window of size W  The above expression has a very
intuitive interpretation When the variance is equal to
the event rate the process is obeying Poisson statistics
and n  0 Any increase in the variance above the event
rate indicates some positive correlations and within a
Hawkes framework a positive branching ratio
Note from Eq 5 that 2
W W is a biased estimator
   and for a general W will fall short of its
theoretical value This means that Eq 7 will gener-
ally under-estimate the branching ratio and only become
exact in the limit W  
for cid82 
In practice to estimate the branching ratio of an em-
pirical sample of total length T  mW we substitute
the mean and variance term in Eq 7 by their sample
estimates

An estimate obtained in this fashion is asymptotically
convergent for large T cid29 W  ie m cid29 1 For a xed
window size W we can always ensure that our estimate
of the variance of NW is within a desired maximum error
with a desired minimum probability by increasing T and
therefore the number of observations m of NW  Further-
more we can make Eq 6 exact by allowing W to be
arbitrarily large
Note however that for any nite m the average of
n over all possible realisations of the process is in fact
 This is because a value 2
W  0 is always possible
with a non zero probability For this reason we choose to
present the median of our estimates
FIG 1 Applying the mean-variance branching ratio approx-
imation method to a simulated Hawkes process with exponen-
tial kernel form and scale parameter   10  is varied to
decide the branching ratio and  is varied to keep the av-
erage event rate xed at   10 The process is simulated
for T  100000s and the branching ratio estimate is made
using Equation 7 with a window size W  20 The mean and
595 condence bands are calculated over an ensemble of
100 process for each parameter set

data 15 20 Specically we consider a kernel with an
Omori law form
For Eq 6 to be accurate we must choose a large
W  However for a nite sample size large W implies
small m  T W  and therefore less statistical power
with which to estimate the variance of the event count
NW  This compromise is illustrated in Fig 2 for which
we simulate an ensemble of exponential Hawkes processes
with parameters   075   10 and   025 We
note that for increasing window size W  the condence
bands of our estimate converge on the expected value of
n  075
However when we make the window size too large we
suer signicant error coming from the estimation of the
variance For the practical implementation of this proce-
dure to empirical data we recommend a choice of window
size suciently large to capture the bulk of autocorrela-
tion present in the event rate but suciently small that
one can expect to obtain reliable estimates of the variance
of the event count in that window
One can approximate upper and lower condence in-
tervals on the branching ratio estimate from a single real-
isation of a time series by bootstrap re-sampling Indeed
the simple variance estimator of Eq 9 is not optimal
and can be improved with the use of over-lapping win-
dows or for example a Monte Carlo sampling scheme
which selects random windows with replacement
  
0   1
In the critical case of n  1 with 0    05 this
process will exhibit long-range dependence with an au-
tocorrelation function   decaying asymptotically as a
power law    12 20 24 The integral of the
autocorrelation function is therefore divergent for large
 s and the variance of the event count in a window of size
W grows with as 2
term in Eq 7
W  W 12 The
cid113 W
will in this case not converge to a nite constant for large
W but rather shrink to zero leading to 1  n  W 
We have simulated such a process with exponent  
035 and cut-o parameter 0  10 To allow our simu-
lation to attain a stationary state with an average event
rate   1 we make our process very near critical by
choosing n  099 and   001 We simulate for a very
long period T  1  109 and discard the rst 09  109
to ensure the process is close to stationarity   099 at
09  109 In Fig 3 we present the results of branching
ratio estimation using Eq 7 with a variety of window
sizes W 
We note that the branching ratio estimate we obtain is
very much dependent on the choice of window size used
To capture all the correlation present in the process and
obtain estimates close to the the true input value n 
099 we must probe the correlation on very large scales
by choosing a very large value for W  The branching
ratio obtained indeed varies with window size according
to the law W  in a similar way to the integral of the
kernel   see Fig 3
FIG 2 Applying the mean-variance branching ratio approxi-
mation method to simulated data Shaded area represents the
595 condence interval We note that the branching ra-
tio estimate converges on the expected value of 075 as the
window size increases For very large W we lack a sucient
number of event count observations to estimate the variance
of NW with precision and the condence interval grows con-
siderably
B Power-law kernel
Finally we test the estimation procedure on a near
critical power-law Hawkes process a type suggested in
some recent publications as a good t to nancial event
1  n for simulated near-critical n  099  
FIG 3
035 power-law Hawkes processes The value for 1  n that
we obtain approximately scales as  W 035 for large W 
Note that the simulated process is only near-critical with
a branching ratio n  1  1  102 so for very large W the
curve levels o and converges to 1  102

A Flash-crash revisited
To demonstrate the eectiveness of this simple estima-
tor we have repeated the ash-crash day branching ratio
analysis of Filimonov  Sornette 3 We consider non-
overlapping periods of 10 minutes in the hours of trading
before and just after the ash-crash For each 10-minute
period we calculate the sample mean and variance of the
number of mid-price changes in the 60 windows of length
W  10s contained The resulting values are plugged
into Eq 7 to obtain an approximation of the branch-
ing ratio for each period The results are presented in
Fig 4

maximising the likelihood of the exponential model with 1-
second randomisation The dashed line is the E-mini SP
price The points are placed at the end of the 10-minute
period for which the branching ratio estimate is made The
shaded region is a 1090 condence interval generated by
bootstrap re-sampling

Note that this simple estimator is biased and for
a general W  will typically underestimate the value of
 tdt and therefore the branching ratio Since we
consider a window size W  10s we have systematically
underestimated n in Figure 4 as measurements of t on
this data have support outside the interval 10s 10s 
there is still signicant autocorrelation in the event rate
at scales longer than 10s
However we have identied that a window size W of
the order of approximately 10 to 30 seconds produces es-
timates of the branching ratio on our data in line with
those obtained by ML tting to the exponential model
after intra-second randomisation the method applied in
3 Note that we do not x  in our ML t but let
it settle naturally at the value which maximises the log-
likelihood We observe that this value  is very much

tion of window size for E-mini SP mid-price changes in 2010
The mean and variance of NW are estimated on the full year
The change of power-law behaviour occurs around 100 sec-
onds Note that we have stitched together all 5-minute bins
of regular trading hours 0930 to 1600 EST that contain
at least one event this solves a problem arising from missing
data at half-days We have then de-trended the intra-day
seasonality by dividing each 5-minute event count by a nor-
malised average event rate for each 5-minutes of the trading
day calculated on the full year
dependent on the period of randomisation2 of the times-
tamps When we randomise timestamps inside each mil-
lisecond we obtain 1  102 for periods in 2010 but
randomisation at larger intervals eg the intra-second
randomisation of Filimonov  Sornette prevents 1
from exceeding values of the order of magnitude of the
scale of randomisation
Note that since our results with W  10s correspond
well with those obtained using the methods of Filimonov
 Sornette 3 their procedure must also underestimate
the branching ratio To converge on the true n in expec-
tation we must take Eq 7 in the limit of W  
We do just this in Fig 5 for mid-price changes of the
E-mini SP Futures contract in 2010 One notes that as
the window size increases the branching ratio converges
to n  1 in a non-trivial way As reported in 20 for the
structure of the kernel at short and long time-scales two
regimes are detectable with a transition around ve min-
utes The branching ratio asymptotically tends towards
n  10 with a scaling exponent   037 compatible
with the value of 045 estimated in 20 for a 14-year pe-
riod Note that in taking the limit W   we consider
variation in the event rate at signicant time-scales to be
explained by the stationary Hawkes model
2 To address the limited precision of the event data in 3 the
authors randomise timestamps uniformly inside the second that
they are reported

mates using the mean-variance estimator with a window size

the plot presented in 3 We attribute this to dierences in
the data source or identication of mid-price changes
B Reexivity  1998 - 2013
Using the mean-variance estimator we can also easily
reproduce the result of 3 that claims to demonstrate
that reexivity has been increasing in the SP futures
market since 1998 To do this we set our only parameter
W  30s and estimate the branching ratio in periods of
15-minutes In Fig 6 we present the 2-month medians
of these estimates beside the median of the branching
ratio estimate obtained using the exponential maximum
likelihood approach after intra-second randomisation
Since we expect the minimum time-scale of correla-
tion in the data to have decreased over the past decades
due to decreasing latency with advancing technology we
now re-perform the experiment but with a window size
Wt that follows Moores law in such a way to keep the
average number of events in Wt roughly constant More
precisely the window size Wt halves every 18 months
this describes well the increase in the high frequency ac-
tivity of markets see 20 The results of this experiment
are presented in Fig 7 and conrm that the kernel inte-
gral is approximately invariant over time provided that
the measurement window Wt is appropriately rescaled
to account for the changing speed of interactions in the
market We nd this quite remarkable as this suggests
that the amount of self-reexivity in nancial markets is
scale invariant and has not signicantly increased due
to high-frequency trading
VI SUMMARY
We have introduced a simple estimator for the branch-
ing ratio of Hawkes self-exciting point-process The
method is straight-forward to apply to empirical event
FIG 7 Estimates of the branching ratio on 2-month peri-
ods using the mean-variance estimator with a window size
that follows Moores law Wt  W0ectt0 with c 
 log1218 months and t0  1998 We again stitch to-
gether periods of regular trading hours and de-trend the event
count by the intra-day U-shape for each year When W is ap-
propriately rescaled the branching ratio estimate is approxi-
mately constant through time for all values of W0 and tends
to n  10 for large W0
data since it requires only a rudimentary calculation on
the mean and variance of the event rate The estimator
does not suer from the bias inherent to the contentious
question of the choice of kernel in the likelihood maximi-
sation approach and furthermore it avoids the need for
complicated numerical minimisation techniques
Despite its simplicity our estimator can accurately re-
produce results obtained for the branching ratio using
this prior method The estimator presented is indeed a
biased estimator but it can be made asymptotically un-
biased in the limit of large W and T  for which we observe
that the branching ratio for empirical mid-price changes
of the E-mini SP futures contract approaches unity in
line with previous theoretical and empirical results 20
Furthermore we demonstrate that if the window size
is allowed to scale with Moores law and adapt to the
changing speed of interaction in the market over the past
fteen years then the branching ratio approximation re-
covered is constant supporting prior observations of the
invariance of the Hawkes kernel and branching ratio over
time in 20
Finally let us reiterate the caveat made above the
Hawkes analysis of the activity in nancial markets leads
to the conclusion that the process must be critical How-
it might well be that the dynamics of markets
is more complicated and requires non-linearities absent
from the Hawkes process dened by Eq
