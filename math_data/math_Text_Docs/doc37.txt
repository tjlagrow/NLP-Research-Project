LIMIT THEOREMS FOR NEARLY UNSTABLE
HAWKES PROCESSES

Because of their tractability and their natural interpretations in
term of market quantities Hawkes processes are nowadays widely
used in high-frequency nance However in practice the statistical
estimation results seem to show that very often only nearly unstable
Hawkes processes are able to t the data properly By nearly unsta-
ble we mean that the L1 norm of their kernel is close to unity We
study in this work such processes for which the stability condition is
almost violated Our main result states that after suitable rescaling
they asymptotically behave like integrated CoxIngersollRoss mod-
els Thus modeling nancial order ows as nearly unstable Hawkes
processes may be a good way to reproduce both their high and low
frequency stylized facts We then extend this result to the Hawkes-
based price model introduced by Bacry et al Quant Finance 13
2013 6577 We show that under a similar criticality condition
this process converges to a Heston model Again we recover well-
known stylized facts of prices both at the microstructure level and
at the macroscopic scale

cess whose intensity at time t denoted by t is of the form

where  is a positive real number  a regression kernel and the Ji are
the points of the process before time t see Section 2 for more accurate
denitions These processes were introduced in 1971 by Hawkes see 22

recent years with the availability of ultra high-frequency data nance
has become one of the main domains of application of Hawkes processes
The introduction of Hawkes processes in nance is probably due to Chavez-
Demoulin et al see 14 in the context of value at risk estimation and
to Bowsher see 12 who jointly studied transaction times and midquote
changes using the Hawkes framework Then in 9 Bauwens and Hautsch
built so-called latent factor intensity Hawkes models and applied them to
transaction data Another pioneer of this type of approach is Hewlett He
considered in 26 the particular case of the foreign exchange rates market
for which he tted a bivariate Hawkes process on buy and sell transaction
data More recently Bacry et al have developed a microstructure model for
midquote prices based on the dierence of two Hawkes processes see 6
Moreover Bacry and Muzy have extended this approach in 7 where they
design a framework enabling to study market impact Beyond midquotes and
transaction prices full limit order book data not only market orders but
also limit orders and cancellations have also been investigated through the
lenses of Hawkes processes In particular Large uses in 34 a ten-variate
multidimensional Hawkes process to this purpose Note that besides mi-
crostruture problems Hawkes processes have also been introduced in the
study of other nancial issues such as daily data analysis see 17 nancial
contagion see 2 or credit risk see 18
Hawkes processes have become popular in nancial modeling for two main
reasons First these processes represent a very natural and tractable exten-
sion of Poisson processes In fact comparing point processes and conven-
tional time series Poisson processes are often viewed as the counterpart
of iid random variables whereas Hawkes processes play the role of au-
toregressive processes see 16 for more details about this analogy Another
explanation for the appeal of Hawkes processes is that it is often easy to
give a convincing interpretation to such modeling To do so the branching
structure of Hawkes processes is quite helpful Recall that under the as-
sumption kk1  1 where kk1 denotes the L1 norm of  Hawkes processes
can be represented as a population process where migrants arrive accord-
ing to a Poisson process with parameter  Then each migrant gives birth
to children according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity
function  these children also giving birth to children according to the same
nonhomogeneous Poisson process see 24 Now consider for example the
classical case of buy or sell market orders as studied in several of the
papers mentioned above Then migrants can be seen as exogenous orders
whereas children are viewed as orders triggered by other orders
Beyond enabling us to build this population dynamics interpretation the
assumption kk1  1 is crucial in the study of Hawkes processes To x
ideas let us place ourselves in the classical framework where the Hawkes
process Nt starts at  In that case if one wants to get a stationary
LIMIT THEOREMS FOR NEARLY UNSTABLE HAWKES PROCESSES
intensity with nite rst moment then the condition kk1  1 is necessary
Furthermore even in the nonstationary setting this condition is usually
required in order to obtain classical ergodic properties for the process see
5 For these reasons this condition is often called a stability condition in
the Hawkes literature
From a practical point of view a lot of interest has been recently devoted
to the parameter kk1 For example Hardiman Bercot and Bouchaud see
21 and Filimonov and Sornette see 19 20 use the branching inter-
pretation of Hawkes processes on midquote data in order to measure the
so-called degree of endogeneity of the market This degree is simply de-
ned by kk1 which is also called branching ratio The intuition behind
this interpretation of kk1 goes as follows The parameter kk1 corresponds
to the average number of children of an individual kk2
1 to the average
number of grandchildren of an individual     Therefore if we call cluster
the descendants of a migrant then the average size of a cluster is given by
Pk1 kkk
1  kk11  kk1 Thus in the nancial interpretation the av-
erage proportion of endogenously triggered events is kk11kk1 divided
by 1  kk11  kk1 which is equal to kk1
This branching ratio can be measured using parametric and nonparamet-
ric estimation methods for Hawkes processes see 36 37 for likelihood based
methods and 4 39 for functional estimators of the function  In 21 very
stable estimations of kk1 are reported for the E mini SP futures between
1998 and 2012 the results being systematically close to one In 19 values
of order 0708 are obtained on several assets A debate on the validity of
these results is currently ongoing between the two groups In particular it
is argued in 21 that the choice of exponential kernels in 19 may lead to
spurious results whereas various bias that could aect the study in 21 are
underlined in 20 In any case we can remark that both groups nd val-
ues close to one for kk1 which is consistent with the results of 4 where
estimations are performed on Bund and Dax futures
This seemingly persistent statistical result should denitely worry users
of Hawkes processes Indeed it is rarely suitable to apply a statistical model
where the parameters are pushed to their limits In fact these obtained val-
ues for kk1 on empirical data are not really surprising Indeed one of the
best-documented stylized facts in high-frequency nance is the persistence
or long memory in ows and market activity measures see for example
11 35 Usual Hawkes processes in the same way as autoregressive pro-
cesses can only exhibit short-range dependence failing to reproduce this
classical empirical feature see 29 for details
In spite of their relative inadequacy with market data Hawkes processes
possess so many appealing properties that one could still try to apply them in
some specic situations In 21 it is suggested to use the without ancestors
version of Hawkes processes introduced by Bremaud and Massoulie in 13
T JAISSON AND M ROSENBAUM
For such processes kk1  1 but in order to preserve stationarity and a nite
expectation for the intensity one needs to have   0 This is probably a
relevant approach However setting the parameter  to 0 is not completely
satisfying since this parameter has a nice interpretation exogenous orders
Moreover it is not found to be equal to zero in practice see 21 Finally
a time-varying  is an easy way to reproduce seasonalities observed on the
market see 7 however for simplicity we work in this paper with a constant
  0
These empirical measures of kk1 close to one are the starting point of
this work Indeed our aim is to study the behavior at large time scales of
nearly unstable Hawkes processes which correspond to these estimations
More precisely we consider a sequence of Hawkes processes observed on
0 T  where T goes to innity In the case of a xed kernel not depending
on T  with norm strictly smaller than one scaling limits of Hawkes processes
have been investigated in 5 see also 42 for the case of non linear Hawkes
processes In this framework Bacry et al obtain a deterministic limit for
the properly normalized sequence of Hawkes processes as it is the case for
suitably rescaled Poisson processes In their price model consisting in the dif-
ference of two Hawkes processes a Brownian motion with some volatility
is found at the limit These two results are in fact quite intuitive Indeed in
the same way as Poisson processes and autoregressive models Hawkes pro-
cesses enjoy short memory properties In this work we show that when the
Hawkes processes are nearly unstable these weakly dependent-like behav-
iors are no longer observed at intermediate time scales To do so we consider
that the kernels of the Hawkes processes depend on T  More precisely we
translate the near instability condition into the assumption that the norm
of the kernels tends to one as the observation scale T goes to innity
Our main theorem states that when the norm of the kernel tends to one
at the right speed meaning that the observation scale and kernels norm
balance in a suitable way the limit of our sequence of Hawkes processes
is no longer a deterministic process but an integrated CoxIngersollRoss
process CIR for short as introduced in 15 In practice it means that when
observing a Hawkes process with kernels norm close to one at appropriate
time scale it looks like an integrated CIR Furthermore for the price model
dened in 6 in the limit the Brownian motion obtained in 5 is replaced by
a Heston model see 25 for denition This is probably more in agreement
with empirical data
The paper is organized as follows The assumptions and main results
notably the convergence toward an integrated CIR are given in Section 2
The case of the dierence of two Hawkes processes is studied in Section 3
The proofs are relegated to Section 4

2 Scaling limits of nearly unstable Hawkes processes We give in this
section our main results about the limiting behavior of a sequence of nearly
unstable Hawkes processes We start by presenting our assumptions and
dening our asymptotic setting
21 Assumptions and asymptotic framework We consider a sequence
of point processes N T
t  satises
0  0 and the process is observed on the time interval 0 T  Furthermore
our asymptotic setting is that the observation scale T goes to innity The
intensity process T
t t0 indexed by T 1 For a given T  N T
t  is dened for t  0 by
t   Z t
T t  s dN T
where  is a positive real number and T a nonnegative measurable function
on R which satises kTk1   For a given T  the process N T
dened on a probability space T F T  PT  equipped with the ltration
s st Moreover we
assume that for any 0  a  b  T and A  F T
is the -algebra generated by N T
t t0T  where F T

which sets T as the intensity of N T  In particular if we denote by J T
the jump times of N T
t  the process
n n1
tJ T
n Z tJ T
is a martingale and the law of N T is characterized by T  From Jacod 27
such construction can be done The process N T is called a Hawkes process
Let us now give more specic assumptions on the function T  We denote
by kk the L norm on R
Assumption 1 For t  R
T t  aT t
where aT T 0 is a sequence of positive numbers converging to one such that
for all T  aT  1 and  is a nonnegative measurable function such that
s ds  1 and
ss ds  m  
Moreover  is dierentiable with derivative  such that kk   and
kk1  
1Of course by T we implicitly means Tn with n  N tending to innity
T JAISSON AND M ROSENBAUM
Remark 21 Note that under Assumption 1 kk is nite
Thus the form of the function T depends on T so that its shape is xed
but its L1 norm varies with T  For a given T  this L1 norm is equal to aT
and so is smaller than one implying that the stability condition is in force
Note that in this framework we have almost surely no explosion2
n
n  
However remark that we do not work in the stationary setting since our
process starts at time t  0 and not at t  
The case where kTk1 is larger than one corresponds to the situation
where the stability condition is violated Since aT  kTk1  1 tends to one
our framework is a way to get close to instability Therefore we call our
processes nearly unstable Hawkes processes There are of course many other
ways to make the L1 norm of T converge to one than the multiplicative
manner used here However this parametrization is sucient for applications
and very convenient to illustrate the dierent regimes that can be obtained
22 Observation scales
In our framework two parameters degenerate
at innity T and 1 aT 1 The relationship between these two sequences
will determine the scaling behavior of the sequence of Hawkes processes
Recall that it is shown in 5 that when kk1 is xed and smaller than one
after appropriate scaling the limit of the sequence of Hawkes processes is
deterministic as it is for example the case for Poisson processes In our
setting if 1  aT tends slowly to zero we can expect the same result
Indeed we may have T large enough so that we reach the asymptotic regime
and for such T  aT is still suciently far from unity This is precisely what
happens as stated in the next theorem
Theorem 21 Assume T 1  aT    Then under Assumption 1
the sequence of Hawkes processes is asymptotically deterministic in the
sense that the following convergence in L2 holds
v01
1  aT
T v  EN T
T v  0
On the contrary if 1  aT tends too rapidly to zero the situation is
likely to be quite intricate Indeed for given T  the Hawkes process may
already be very close to instability whereas T is not large enough to reach
the asymptotic regime The last case which is probably the most interesting
2In fact for a Hawkes process the no explosion property can be obtained under weaker
conditions for example R t
0 s ds   for any t  0 see 5
We also set T the function dened on R by
t  N T

one is the intermediate case where 1  aT tends to zero in such a manner
that a nondeterministic scaling limit is obtained while not being in the
preceding degenerate setting We largely detail this situation in the next
subsection
23 Nondegenerate scaling limit for nearly unstable Hawkes processes
We give in this section our main result a nondegenerate scaling limit for a
sequence of properly renormalized nearly unstable Hawkes processes Before
giving this theorem we wish to provide intuitions on how it is derived Let
M T be the martingale process associated to N T  that is for t  0
where T 1  T and for k  2 T k denotes the convolution product
of T k1 with the function T  Note that T t is well dened since
kTk1  1 In the sequel it will be convenient to work with another form for
the intensity We have the following result whose proof is given in Section 4
Proposition 21 For all t  0 we have
t   Z t
T t  s ds Z t
T t  s dM T
Now recall that we observe the process N T
t  on 0 T  In order to be able
to give a proper limit theorem where the processes live on the same time
interval we rescale our processes so that they are dened on 0 1 To do so
we consider for t  0 1
tT   Z tT
T T t  s ds Z tT
T T t  s dM T
For the scaling in space a natural multiplicative factor is 1 aT  Indeed
is 1kT k1 Thus the order
in the stationary case the expectation of T
of magnitude of the intensity is 1  aT 1 This is why we dene
t  T
tT 1  aT 
Understanding the asymptotic behavior of C T
t will be the key to the
derivation of a suitable scaling limit for our sequence of renormalized pro-
cesses We will see that this behavior is closely connected to that of the
T JAISSON AND M ROSENBAUM
function T  About T  one can rst remark that the function dened for
x  0 by
T x  T
is the density of the random variable
where the Xi are iid random variables with density  and I T is a ge-
ometric random variable with parameter 1  aT k  0 PI T  k  1 
aT aT k1 Now let z  R The characteristic function of the random vari-
able X T  denoted by bT  satises

where  denotes the characteristic function of X1 Since
ss ds  m  
the function  is continuously dierentiable with rst derivative at point
zero equal to im Therefore using that aT and  z
T  both tend to one as T
goes to innity bT z is equivalent to
1  izmT 1  aT 
Thus we precisely see here that the suitable regime so that we get a
nontrivial limiting law for X T is that there exists   0 such that
T 1  aT  T 
When 3 holds we write d0  m In fact we have just proved the
following result
Proposition 22 Assume that 3 holds Under Assumption 1 the
sequence of random variable X T converges in law toward an exponential
random variable with parameter 1d0
LIMIT THEOREMS FOR NEARLY UNSTABLE HAWKES PROCESSES
This simple result is of course not new For example these types of geo-
metric sums of random variables are studied in detail in 32 Note also that
when X1 is exponentially distributed X T is also exponentially distributed
even for a xed T 
Assume from now on that 3 holds and set uT  T 1  aT  so that
uT goes to one Proposition 22 is particularly important since it gives us
the asymptotic behavior of T in this setting Indeed it tells us that
T T x  T x

Let us now come back to the process C T
t  which can be written
t  1  aT   Z t

By studying its quadratic variation we will show that BT represents a se-
quence of martingales which converges to a Brownian motion So heuristi-
cally replacing BT by a Brownian motion B and T T x by 1

4 we get
t  1  etm 
Applying Itos formula this gives
  C

which precisely corresponds to the stochastic dierential equation SDE
satised by a CIR process
Before stating the theorem which makes the preceding heuristic derivation
rigorous we consider an additional assumption
Assumption 2 There exists K  0 such that for all x  0 and T  0
T x  K
Note that Assumption 2 is in fact not really restrictive Indeed if  is
decreasing then any T is decreasing Thus since T 0 is bounded As-
sumption 2 holds in this case Also from 38 page 214 point 5 we get
that if kk   and R 
s3s ds   then Assumption 2 follows
T JAISSON AND M ROSENBAUM
From 32 Chapter 5 Lemma 41 another sucient condition to get As-
sumption 2 is that the random variable X1 with density  can be written
in law under the form X1  E  Y  where E follows an exponential law
with parameter   0 and Y is independent of E We now give our main
theorem
Theorem 22 Assume that 3 holds Under Assumptions 1 and 2 the
sequence of renormalized Hawkes intensities C T
t  dened in 1 converges in
law for the Skorohod topology toward the law of the unique strong solution
of the following CoxIngersollRoss stochastic dierential equation on 0 1

24 Discussion
 Theorem 22 implies that when kk1 is close to 1 if the observation time
T is suitably chosen that is of order 11  kk1 a nondegenerate be-
havior neither explosive nor deterministic can be obtained for a rescaled
Hawkes process
 This can for example be useful for the statistical estimation of the pa-
rameters of a Hawkes process Indeed designing an estimating procedure
based on the ne scale properties of a Hawkes process is a very hard
task Nonparametric methods are dicult to use and present various in-
stabilities see 4 20 whereas parametric approaches are of course very
sensitive to model specications see 20 21 Considering an intermediate
scale where the process behaves like a CIR model one can use statisti-
cal methods specically developed in order to estimate CIR parameters
see 3 for a survey Of course only the parameters  m and  can be
recovered this way Therefore there is clearly an information loss in this
approach However it still gives us access to quantities which are im-
portant in practice see Section 1 In some sense it can be compared to
the extreme value theory based method for extreme quantile estimation
where one assumes that the random variables of an iid sample belong
to some max stable attraction domain Indeed these two methods lie be-
tween a fully parametric one where a parametric form is assumed for the
LIMIT THEOREMS FOR NEARLY UNSTABLE HAWKES PROCESSES
law of the random variables or the function  and a fully nonparametric
one where a functional estimator of the repartition function or of  is
used in order to reach the quantity of interest the quantile or the L1
norm of 
 CIR processes are a very classical way to model stochastic squared
volatilities in nance see the celebrated Heston model 25 Also it is
widely acknowledged that there exists a linear relationship between the
cumulated order ow and the integrated squared volatility see for exam-
ple 41 Therefore our setting where kk1 is close to one and the limiting
behavior obtained in Theorem 22 seem in good agreement with market
 For the stationary version of a Hawkes process one can show that the
T is of order T 1  kTk13 see for example 13 There-
variance of N T
fore if T 1  aT  tends to zero that is kTk1 goes rapidly to one then
the variance of 1aT 
T blows up as T goes to innity This situation is
therefore very dierent from the one studied here and is therefore out of
the scope of this paper
 The assumption R 
ss ds   is crucial in order to approximate
T by an exponential function using Proposition 22 Let us now consider
the fat tail case where the preceding integral is innite More precisely
x1  0    1 as x goes to
let us take a function  which is of order
innity In this case following the proof of Proposition 22 we can show
the following result where we borrow the notation of Proposition 22
Proposition 23 Let E
C be a random variable whose characteristic
function satises
EeizE 
1  Ciz 
Assume z  1 0 iz for some   0 0    1 and 1  aT T  
  0 Then X T converges in law toward the random variable E
Thus when the shape of the kernel is of order x1 the right
observation scale is no longer T  11  kk1 but T  11  kk11
Remark also that if we denote by E the   MittagLeer function
that is

see eg 40 then the density

C is linked to this function since

T JAISSON AND M ROSENBAUM
Now let us consider the asymptotic setting where T  T 1 T 
aT  with aT  1  
T  and  as in Proposition 23 If we apply the same
heuristic arguments as those used in Section 2 to the renormalized inten-
tT 1  aT

we get the following type of limiting law for our sequence of Hawkes
intensities
Xt  Z t
t  s ds Z t

These heuristic arguments are however far from a proof Indeed in
this case we probably have to deal with a non semi-martingale limit
Furthermore tightness properties which are important in the proofs of
this paper are much harder to show in particular the function 
C is not
bounded We leave this case for further research
 In the classical time series setting let us mention the paper 8 where the
authors study the asymptotic behavior of unstable integer-valued autore-
gressive model INAR processes In this case CIR processes also appear
in the limit This is in fact not so surprising since INAR processes share
some similarities with Hawkes processes In particular they can somehow
be viewed as Hawkes processes for which the kernel would be a sum of
Dirac functions
3 Extension of Theorem 22 to a price model
In the previous section
we have studied one-dimensional nearly unstable Hawkes processes For -
nancial applications they can for example be used to model the arrival of
orders when the number of endogenous orders is much larger than the num-
ber of exogenous orders which seems to be the case in practice see 19 21
In this section we consider the high-frequency price model introduced in 6
which is essentially dened as a dierence of two Hawkes processes Using
the same approach as in Theorem 22 we investigate the limiting behavior
of this model when the stability condition is close to saturation
31 A Hawkes-based price model

price Ptt0 are modeled thanks to a two-dimensional Hawkes process in

with 1 and 2 two nonnegative measurable functions such that the stability
condition

is satised
This model takes into account the discreteness and the negative auto-
correlation of prices at the microstructure level Moreover it is shown in 5
that when one considers this price at large time scales the stability condition
implies that after suitable renormalization it converges toward a Brownian
motion with a given volatility
32 Scaling limit
In the same spirit as in Section 2 we consider the
scaling limit of the Hawkes-based price process when the stability condition
becomes almost violated More precisely following the construction of mul-
tivariate Hawkes processes of 5 for every observation interval 0 T  we
dene the Hawkes process N T  N T  with intensity

since  is continuous this supremum is attained at some point z0 We have

Then we aim at applying Theorem 54 in 33 to C T  This result essentially
says that for a sequence of SDEs where the functions and processes dening
the equations satisfy some convergence properties the laws of the solutions
of the SDEs converge to the law of the solution of the limiting SDE We now
check these convergence properties
The sequence of processes BT  is a sequence of martingales with jumps
uniformly bounded by c Furthermore for t  0 1 the quadratic vari-

toward a Brownian motion

Thus for any T  B1T and B2T are two martingales with uniformly
bounded jumps and their quadratic co-variations satisfy Lemma 413 Con-

Step 4 Convergence of C T  B2T  The aim of this step is to prove
that the couple C T  B2T  converges in law toward C B2 with C a
CIR process and B2 a Brownian motion independent of C More precisely
we have the following lemma

renormalized intensity C T converges toward a CIR Note that the renormal-
izing factor here is 1T and not 1  aT  which is not an issue since 3
holds Thus we get the convergence of C T toward a CIR To obtain the joint
convergence we just need to write the same proof as for Theorem 22 up
to obvious changes but using this time Theorem 54 in 33 together with
Lemma 414 cid3

Moreover in Lemma 416 we have shown that the second term in the de-
