Recent work which treats the Hawking radiation as a semi-classical tunneling process at the
horizon of the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes indicates that the exact radiant
spectrum is no longer pure thermal after considering the black hole background as dynamical and
the conservation of energy In this paper we extend the method to investigate Hawking radiation
as massless particles tunneling across the event horizon of the Kerr black hole and that of charged
particles from the Kerr-Newman black hole by taking into account the energy conservation the
angular momentum conservation and the electric charge conservation Our results show that when
self-gravitation is considered the tunneling rate is related to the change of Bekenstein-Hawking en-
tropy and the derived emission spectrum deviates from the pure thermal spectrum but is consistent
with an underlying unitary theory

INTRODUCTION
The no hair theorem stated that all information
about the collapsing body was lost from the outside re-
gion apart from three conserved quantities the mass the
angular momentum and the electric charge
In other
words this implied that the only stationary rotating
black hole solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations
in four dimensions are the Kerr-Newman metrics In the
classical theory the loss of information was not a seri-
ous problem since the information could be thought of
as preserved inside the black hole but just not very ac-
cessible However taking the quantum eect into con-
sideration the situation is changed With the emission
of thermal radiation 1 black holes could lose energy
shrink and eventually evaporate away completely Since
the radiation with a precise thermal spectrum carries no
information the information carried by a physical system
falling toward black hole singularity has no way to be
recovered after a black hole has disappeared completely
This is the so-called information loss paradox 2 which
means that pure quantum states the original matter that
forms the black hole can evolve into mixed states the
thermal spectrum at innity Such an evolution violates

the fundamental principles of quantum theory as these
prescribe a unitary time evolution of basis states While
the information paradox can perhaps be attributed to
the semi-classical nature of the investigations of Hawk-
ing radiation researches in string theory indeed support
the idea that Hawking radiation can be described within
a manifestly unitary theory however it still remains a
mystery how information is recovered Although a com-
plete resolution of the information loss paradox might be
within a unitary theory of quantum gravity or stringM-
theory it is argued that the information could come out
if the outgoing radiation were not exactly thermal but
had subtle corrections 2
On the other hand the mechanism of black hole radi-
ance remains shrouded in some degree of mystery In the
original derivation of black hole evaporation Hawking
described the thermal radiation as a quantum tunnel-
ing process 3 triggered by vacuum uctuations near the
event horizon According to this scenario a pair of parti-
cles is spontaneously created just inside the horizon the
positive energy particle then tunnels out to the innity
and the negative energy partner remains behind and
eectively lowers the mass of the black hole This tunnel-
ing picture can be depicted in another manner that is a
particleanti-particle pair is created just outside the hori-
zon the negative energy particle tunnels into the horizon
because the negative energy orbit exists only inside the
horizon the positive energy partner is left outside and
emerges at innity
In fact the above viewpoint that regards the radiation
as quantum tunneling out from inside the black hole has
been proved very convenient to explore the issue of dy-
namics But actual derivation 4 of Hawking radiation
did not proceed in this way at all most of which based
upon quantum eld theory on a xed background space-
time without considering the uctuation of the spacetime
geometry Moreover there is another fundamental issue
that must necessarily be dealt with namely the energy
conservation It seems clear that the background geom-
etry of a radiating black hole should be altered with the
loss of energy but this dynamical eect is often neglected
in formal treatments
Recently a program that implemented Hawking ra-
diation as a tunneling process was initiated by Kraus
and Wilczek 5 and developed by Parikh and Wilczek
6 this framework shall be referred to as the Kraus-
Parikh-Wilczeks analysis for briefness see also Ref
for a dierent methodology that the tunneling picture has
been applied who carried out a dynamical treatment of
black hole radiance in the static spherically symmetric
black hole geometries More specically they considered
the eects of a positive energy matter shell propagat-
ing outwards through the horizon of the Schwarzschild
and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes and incorporated
the self-gravitation correction of the radiation In partic-
ular they took into account the energy conservation and
allowed the background geometry to uctuate in their
dynamical description of the black hole background In
doing so they allowed the black hole to lose mass while
radiating but maintained a constant energy for the total
system The emission spectrum that they calculated for
the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes
gives a leading-order correction to the emission rate aris-
ing from loss of mass of the black hole which corresponds
to the energy carried by the radiated quantum This re-
sult displays that the derived spectrum of black hole radi-
ation is not strictly pure thermal under the consideration
of energy conservation and the unxed spacetime back-
ground which may be a correct amendment to Hawking
radiation spectrum
Apart from the energy conservation and the parti-
cles self-gravitation are considered a salient point in the
Kraus-Parikh-Wilczeks analysis is to introduce a coor-
dinate system that is well-behaved at the event horizon
in order to calculate the emission probability The so-
called Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates rediscovered in
Ref 8 are not only time independent and regular at the
horizon but for which time reversal is manifestly asym-
metric namely the coordinates are stationary but not
static Following this approach a lot of people 9 10 11
have investigated Hawking radiation as tunneling from
various spherically symmetric black holes and the ob-
tained results are very successful to support the Parikh-
Wilczeks picture Nevertheless all these investigations
are limited to the spherically symmetric black holes and
most of them are conned only to discuss the tunneling
process of the uncharged massless particles There are
also some recent attempts to extend this approach to the
case of the stationary axisymmetric geometries 12 13
however as far as the treatment is concerned not all of
them are completely satisfactory
The purpose of the current paper is to present a rea-
sonable extension of the self-gravitation analysis we will
follow the presentation of 6 from spherically symmetric
spacetime to the case of a rotating Kerr 14 black hole
Moreover we attempt to extend this method to inves-
tigate the tunneling radiation of charged particles from
the event horizon of a stationary Kerr-Newman 15 black
hole In order to do so one needs to nd a coordinate
system that is well-behaved at the event horizon since
it is the key to do a tunneling computation in the semi-
classical framework of 5 6 Fortunately several years
ago a suitable solution to this problem was already pro-
vided by Chris Doran 16 who presented a faithful gen-
eralization of the Painleve-Gullstrand coordinate system
to the case of the Kerr black hole The new form of the
Kerr solution found in Ref 16 inherits most of the at-
tractive properties of the Painleve-Gullstrand coordinate
system 1 The metric is regular at the event horizon
2 The time direction remains to be a Killing vector be-
sides there exists another Killing vector  3 The time
coordinate t registers the local proper time for radially
free-falling observers 4 The measure on the surfaces of
constant-time slices is the same as that of at spacetime
5 In addition it satises Landaus condition of the co-
ordinate clock synchronization 17 All these features
are very useful to study the radiation of particles tun-
neling across the event horizon of a rotating black hole
Their utility will be demonstrated by how to calculate
the tunneling probability in this paper
Now since we shall adopt the semi-classical method
5 6 with which the gravitation eects need not to be
taken into account in our discussion it seems that the
unique task left is directly to calculate the tunneling rate
and the corrected radiant spectrum of the black holes
Nevertheless there is still another important issue needed
to be well addressed namely the frame-dragging eect
of a rotating black hole
In general because there ex-
ists a frame-dragging eect of the coordinate system in
the stationary rotating spacetime the matter eld in the
ergosphere near the horizon must be dragged by the grav-
itational eld with an azimuthal angular velocity also so
a legitimate physical picture should be described in the
dragging coordinate system In addition due to the pres-
ence of rotation the event horizon does not coincide with
the innite red-shift surface in both forms of the origi-
nal Kerr 14 solution and that presented by Doran 16
the geometrical optical limit cannot be used there since
the Kraus-Parikh-Wilczeks analysis is essentially akin to
a WKB s-wave approximation So the Painleve-Kerr
metric introduced by Doran 16 is still inconvenient for
us to depict the tunneling process that takes place at
the event horizon Apparently this supercial diculty
can be easily overcome by further performing a dragging
coordinate transformation which makes the event hori-
zon coincide with the innite red-shift surface so that
the WKB approximation can be applied now The nal
Painleve-Kerr coordinate system at which we arrived in
a dragging coordinate system retains all the nice features
mentioned above therefore it is very convenient for us to
investigate the tunneling process of a rotating black hole
After equipped with these insights we are readily to
investigate Hawking radiation of massless particles as a
tunneling process across the event horizon of the Kerr
black hole and that of charged particles from the Kerr-
Newman black hole by taking into account the energy
conservation the angular momentum conservation and
the electric charge conservation The picture adopted in
our discussion is a charged particle does tunnel out of
a rotating charged black hole the tunneling barrier is
created by the self-gravitation among the outgoing par-
ticle If the total energy and total angular momentum
as well as electric total charge must be conserved the
outgoing particle must tunnel out a radial barrier to an
observer resting in the dragging coordinate system With
the loss of energy the angular momentum and the elec-
tric charge the black hole will shrink its size its drag-
ging velocity and electric potential will change also That
is to say the geometry must be dynamic This picture
enables us to compute the tunneling rate and the radi-
ant spectrum of a rotating Kerr and Kerr-Newman black
hole Our results show that when self-gravitation is con-
sidered the tunneling probability is related to the change
of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the derived emission
spectrum deviates from the pure thermal spectrum but
is consistent with an underlying unitary theory
Our paper is outlined as follows In Sec II we begin
with by briey reviewing the extension of the Painleve-
Gullstrand coordinate system to the Kerr black hole case
and show that the new form 16 of the Kerr solution has
many of the desired properties to do a semi-classical tun-
neling calculation of the emission rate from which the
corrected spectrum can be directly extrapolated We
then introduce the dragging coordinate system in the
Painleve-Kerr spacetime and present the radial geodesic
equation of uncharged particles In Sec III we inves-
tigate Hawking radiation as tunneling from the event
horizon of the Kerr black hole and compute the tunnel-
ing rate In Sec
IV we extend this analysis to Kerr-
Newman spacetime and calculate the emission probabil-
ity of charged particles Section V ends with some brief
remarks

The Painleve-Gullstrand coordinate system 1 has a
number of nice features 16 many of which extend to
the Kerr case The solution is well-behaved without a
singularity at the horizon so can be employed safely to
analyze physical processes near the event horizon and
indeed inside it A second useful feature is that the
time coordinate t coincides with the local proper time
of observers free-falling along radial trajectories starting
from rest at innity Because it has many of the prop-
erties of a global Newtonian time physics as seen by
these observers is almost entirely Newtonian making it
a very powerful one for studying across-horizon physics
Another useful property of this metric is that the mea-
sure on surfaces of constant-time slices is the same as
that of at Euclidean spacetime A further feature of
the metric is that an observer at innity does not make
any distinction between the Painleve-Gullstrand coordi-
nates and the static Schwarzschild coordinates the two
time coordinates coincides with each other there Fi-
nally the line element satises the Landaus condition of
coordinate clock synchronization 17 making it very im-
portant to discuss the tunneling process because particle
tunneling through a barrier is an instantaneous process
in the sense of quantum mechanics
Extending to the case of a stationary rotating black
hole it is naturally expected to nd an analogue of the
Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates for the Kerr solution
Such an attempt might fail due to the presence of angu-
lar momentum However Doran 16 indeed achieved a
suitable generalization by realizing that the key is to look
for a convenient set of reference observers which general-
izes the idea of a family of free-falling observers on radial
trajectories since it is only the local properties of time
t that make it so convenient for describing the physics
of the solution Starting from the advanced Eddington-
Finkelstein coordinate formalism of the Kerr metric and
performing a coordinate transformation Doran reached
to a new form of the Kerr metric as follows 16

II NEW FORM OF THE KERR SOLUTION
AND DRAGGING COORDINATE SYSTEM
Recall that in the tunneling framework advocated by
Parikh and Wilczeks 6 a convenient trick is to use sta-
tionary coordinates that are manifestly asymmetric un-
der time reversal In the case of a Schwarzschild black
hole it is most convenient to recast the metric into the
where   r2  a2 cos2  and   r2  a2  2M r see
below in which M is the mass the specic angular mo-
mentum a  JM is kept as a constant thought this
Unlike Doran did in Ref 16 instead we shall demon-
strate that via a suitable coordinate transformation the
metric 2 can be directly obtained from the usual form
of the Kerr solution which can be expressed as 14
ds2  dt2 
 cid16dt  a sin2 d cid172
d2  r2  a2 sin2 d 2 
In order to do so it is instructive to note that the met-
ric 1 can be obtained from the original Schwarzschild
solution

both forms of the original Kerr solution and the Painleve-
Kerr metric the geometrical optical limit cannot be ap-
plied On the other hand since there exists a frame-
dragging eect in the stationary rotating spacetime the
matter eld in the ergosphere near the horizon must be
dragged by the gravitational eld also so a reasonable
physical picture should be depicted in the dragging coor-
dinate system Obviously this hints that we must con-
tinue to transform the metric into a dragging coordinate
system Carrying out a dragging coordinate transforma-
tion d   dt with
ar2  a2  
r2  a22  a2 sin2 
yields the new line element which shall be called as the
dragged Painleve-Kerr metric
So a natural extension of this transformation in the ro-
tating case should be written as
ds2 
dt  dt  p2M rr2  a2
d   d 
r2  a2 dr 
r 2M r
A direct computation can check this indeed is the case
The new form 2 of the Kerr metric directly gen-
eralizes the Painleve-Gullstrand metric 1 replacing
p2Mr with p2M r and introducing a rotational
component This coordinate system faithfully inherits
a number of nice characters of the Painleve-Gullstrand
line element 1 The metric is well-behaved at the event
horizon 2 There exist two commuting Killing vectors
t and  3 The time coordinate t represents the local
proper time for radially free-falling observers 4 The
hypersurfaces of constant-time slices are just at Eu-
clidean space in the oblate spheroidal coordinates 5
In addition it satises Landaus condition of the coor-
dinate clock synchronization 17 As such we shall re-
fer it to as the Painleve-Kerr coordinate system Since
these coordinates comply with the perspective of a free-
falling observer who is expected to experience nothing
out of the ordinary upon passing through the horizon
it is well-suited for studying processes near the event
horizon The new form of the Kerr solution has already
proved to be very powerful in numerical simulation in as-
trophysics black hole physics and quantum mechanics in
curved spaces 16 and references therein In this paper
we shall further exploit its another application in black
hole phenomena due to its distinguishing feature of hori-
zon regularity namely Hawking radiation as tunneling
from the horizon
However due to the inclusion of rotation the Painleve-
Kerr metric 2 is still inconvenient for our study of the
tunneling process at the event horizon The reasons come
from two aspects
In the one hand because the event
horizon r  M  M 2  a2 does not coincide with the
innite red-shift surface rT LS  M M 2  a2 cos2  in
r2  a22  a2 sin2 
2 p2M rr2  a2
r2  a22  a2 sin2 
dt2 
r2  a2 dr2
dtdr  d2 
In fact the line element 8 represents a 3-dimensional
hypersurface in the 4-dimensional spacetime with no
coordinate singularity at the horizon Along with the
above-mentioned properties of the Painleve-Kerr coordi-
nate system the event horizon and the innite red-shift
surface coincide with each other in the dragged Painleve-
Kerr coordinate system so that the WKB approximation
can be used now These attractive features are very ad-
vantageous for us to discuss Hawking radiation via tun-
neling and to do an explicit computation of the tunneling
probability at the event horizon
In the subsequent section we shall investigate the tun-
neling behavior of massless particles from the horizon
For this purpose let us rst evaluate the radial null
geodesics Since the tunneling processes take place near
the event horizon we may consider a particle tunneling
across the event horizon as an ellipsoid shell and think
that the particle should still be an ellipsoid shell during
the tunneling process ie the particle does not have mo-
tion in the -direction Therefore under these assump-
tions ds2  0  d the radial null geodesics followed
by massless particles are
r2  a22
r2  a22  a2 sin2 
r2  a2 s1 
 r1 
2a2 sin2 
r2  a23  
where the upper lower sign can be identied with the
outgoing incoming radial motion under the implicit
assumption that time t increases towards the future In
other words the plus sign corresponds to an outgoing
geodesic and the minus sign corresponds to an ingoing
geodesic respectively
III TUNNELING PROCESS OF UNCHARGED
PARTICLES FROM KERR BLACK HOLES
Now we turn to discuss Hawking radiation of un-
charged particles as a semi-classical tunneling process
across the barrier which is created just by the outgoing
particle itself We adopt the picture of a pair of virtual
particles spontaneously created just inside the horizon
The positive energy virtual particle can tunnel out and
materialize as a real particle escaping classically to inn-
ity its negative energy partner is absorbed by the black
hole resulting in a decrease in the mass and angular mo-
mentum of the black hole In our discussion we consider
the particle as an ellipsoid shell of energy  and angular
momentum a If the particles self-gravitation is taken
into account Eqs 7-9 should be modied To guaran-
tee the conservation of energy and angular momentum
we x the total mass and total angular momentum of the
spacetime but allow the holes mass and angular momen-
tum to uctuate When a particle of energy  is radiated
from the event horizon the mass and angular momentum
of the black hole will be reduced to M   and M  a
respectively Then we should replace M with M   in
Eqs 7-9 in order to describe the moving of the shell
In particular the particle will move along the modied
null geodesic in the radial direction
2a2 sin2 
r2  a2s1 
r2  a2 s1 
r2  a23 1
where   r2  a2  2M  r is the horizon equation
after the emission of the particle with energy 
Since the event horizon coincides with the innite red-
shift surface in the dragged Painleve-Kerr coordinate sys-
tem so the geometrical optical limit become an especially
reliable approximation and the semi-classical WKB s-
wave approximation can be used By means of WKB
approximation the tunneling probability for an outgoing
positive energy particle can be expressed in terms of the
imaginary part of the action as
  e2Im S 
At this point it should be noticed that the coordinate 
does not appear in the dragged Painleve-Kerr metric 8
That is  is an ignorable coordinate in the Lagrangian
function To eliminate this degree of freedom completely
the imaginary part of the action should be written as by
using dt  d   dr r
where Pr and P are two canonical momenta conjugate
to r and  respectively ri  r  M  M 2  a2 and
rf  M   pM  2  a2 are the locations of the
event horizon before and after a particle tunnels out they
are just inside and outside the barrier through which the
particle tunnels
To proceed with an explicit calculation we now re-
move the momentum in favor of energy by applying the
Hamiltons equations

where dHrPr   dJ  a dM   which represents
the energy change of the black hole because of the loss of
the angular momentum when a particle tunnels out and
the dragging angular velocity is given by
 
ar2  a2  
r2  a22  a2 sin2 
Substituting Eqs 10 and 13 into Eq 12 and noting
that we must choose the positive sign in Eq 10 as the
particle is propagating from inside to outside the event
horizon then we have

We see that r  r
 is a single pole in Eq 14 The in-
tegral can be evaluated by deforming the contour around
the pole so as to ensure that positive energy solution
decay in time In this way we nish the r integral and

Completing the integration nally yields

In terms of the entropy expression SBH  r2
the tunneling rate is then expressible as 5
  a2
  e2Im S  eSBH 
where SBH  SBH M    SBH M  is the dier-
ence of Bekenstein-Hawking entropies of the Kerr black
hole before and after the emission of the particle The
derived emission spectrum actually deviates from pure
thermality
To conclude this section we nd that in order to
properly extend the semi-classical tunneling formalism
5 6 to the case of a Kerr black hole we must adopt
the Painleve-Kerr metric which neatly generalizes the
Painleve-Gullstrand line element Nevertheless we must
further transform it to the dragged Painleve-Kerr coordi-
nate system so that an explicit tunneling analysis can be
made Moreover when the energy conservation and the
angular momentum conservation as well as the particles
self-gravitation are taken into account the tunneling rate
is related to the change of black hole entropy during the
process of the particles emission and the radiant spec-
trum is not precisely thermal Furthermore it should
be pointed out that our discussion made in this section
can be directly generalized to deal with the Hawking ra-
diation of uncharged particles tunneling from the Kerr-
Newman black hole with a simple replacement of 2M r
by 2M r  Q2 The result is the same as that obtained
above generalizing those given in Refs
next section we will focus on a semi-classical treatment
of the tunneling characters of charged massive particles
from a charged Kerr black hole

IV RADIATION OF CHARGED PARTICLES AS
TUNNELING FROM THE KERR-NEWMAN
BLACK HOLE
As mentioned in the last section the analysis of
uncharged massless particles tunneling from a Kerr-
Newman black hole completely parallels to the case that
made for a Kerr black hole
In this section we shall
investigate the tunneling behavior of a charged massive
particle and calculate its emission rate from a charged
rotating black hole
It should be noted that one must
overcome two additional diculties The rst is that one
has to decide the equation of motion of a charged test
particle since the radial null geodesics is only applicable
to describe the tunneling behavior of the uncharged ra-
diation from the event horizon Dierent from the null
geodesics of an uncharged particle the trajectory fol-
lowed by a charged massive particle is not light-like but
subject to Lorentz forces Here we will decide it approx-
imately by the phase velocity The second is how to take
into account the eect of the electro-magnetic eld when
the charged particle tunnels out from the event horizon
Apart from the conservation of energy and angular mo-
mentum the electric charge conservation must be con-
sidered also In the following discussion we shall adopt
a slightly modied tunneling picture that is we consider
the charged massive particle as a charged conducting el-
lipsoid shell carrying energy  angular momentum a
and electric charge q To account for the eect of the
electro-magnetic eld we shall consider a matter-gravity
system that consists of the black hole and the electro-
magnetic eld outside the hole Taking into account the
particles self-gravitation the conservation of energy and
angular momentum as well as electric charge we must
x the total mass total angular momentum and total
electric charge of the spacetime but allow those of the
black hole to vary also
Before seeking for the equation of motion of a charged
massive particle we must rst deal with how the electro-
magnetic vector potential changes under two steps of co-
ordinate transformations To this end recall that the
Kerr-Newman black hole solution 15 can be expressed
in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate system as
ds2  dt2 
2M r  Q2
cid16dt  a sin2 d cid172
d2  r2  a2 sin2 d 2 
 cid16dt  a sin2 d cid17 
where   r2  a2 cos2  and   r2  a2  Q2 2M r in
which the parameters M  Q and J  M a are the mass
the electric charge and the angular momentum of the
black hole respectively
A generalized Painleve-type coordinate transformation
dt  dt  p2M r  Q2r2  a2
d   d

r2  a2 dr 
sends the metric 18 and the vector potential 19 to
By the denition of the group velocity we have
therefore the phase velocity is

ds2  dt2  d2 hr 2M r  Q2
cid0dt  a sin2 dcid1
 r2  a2 sin2 d2 
r2  a2 dri2
 cid0dt  a sin2 dcid1 
Here the form of vector potential remains unchanged up
to a gauge transformation To make the event horizon
coincide with the innite red-shift surface we further in-
troduce the dragging coordinate transformation
ar2  a2  
r2  a22  a2 sin2 
under which the desired 3-dimensional dragged Painleve-
Kerr-Newman line element and the relevant electro-
magnetic vector potential can be obtained as follows

As before the radial null geodesics are given by Eq
9 with 2M r replaced by 2M r  Q2 But we are con-
sidering the tunneling process of charged particles from
a rotating charged black hole the trajectory followed by
a charged test particle is not light-like it does not follow
the radially light-like geodesics when it tunnels across
the horizon Because the calculations are more involved
by the fact that the trajectory is now also subject to
Lorentz forces for the sake of simplicity here it is ap-
proximately determined by the phase velocity Accord-
ing to de Broglies hypothesis and the denition of the
phase group velocity the outgoing particle that can be
considered as a massive shell corresponds to a kind of
s-wave whose phase velocity vp and group velocity vg
have the following relationship
where rc denotes the radial position of the particle
Since the tunneling process across the barrier is an in-
stantaneous eect there are two events that take place si-
multaneously in dierent places during the process One
is the particle tunneling into the barrier another is the
particle tunneling out the barrier Because the dragged
Painleve-Kerr-Newman metric 24 satises Landaus
condition of the coordinate clock synchronization 17
the coordinate time dierence of these two events is
dt  
d  0
To include the particles self-interaction eect after the
charged particle emission the mass and charge parame-
ters in Eqs 24 25 and 29 should be replaced with
M  M   and Q  Q  q when a charged test parti-
cle of energy  and electric charge q tunnels out Based
on a similar discussion to that made in the last section
it is obvious that we must accordingly modify the radial
trajectory of the charged massive particle to account for
the particles self-gravitation which is described by
2r2  a2s1 
r2  a2 
where   r2  a2  2M  r  Q q2 is the horizon
equation after the emission of the particle with energy 
and electric charge q
When we investigate the tunneling process of a charged
particle the eect of the electro-magnetic eld should be
taken into account So we must consider the matter-
gravity system that consists of the black hole and the
electro-magnetic eld outside the black hole As the
Lagrangian function of the electro-magnetic eld corre-
sponding to the generalized coordinates described by A
is 14FF  we can nd that the generalized co-
ordinate At in Eq 25 is an ignorable coordinate In
addition the coordinate  is also a cyclic one In order
to eliminate these two degrees of freedom completely the
action of the charged massive particle should be written

We would like to emphasize that by keeping the mass

energy and angular momentum as well as electric charge
will be enforced in a natural fashion Substituting Eqs

To end this section
it is necessary to reveal that
the reason why the Kraus-Parikh-Wilczeks semi-classical
tunneling formalism is so successful is in that its eective-
ness to a large extent relies on the well-known thermo-
dynamic properties of a charged rotating black hole A
rigorous check on the prescribed method allows us to con-
rm that it is closely related to the rst law of black hole
thermodynamics
In fact it is easily observed that all
the radial trajectories whether or not they are charged
share the common near-horizon behavior

Keeping the mass M and electric charge Q xed Eq
39 indicates that the black hole could be in thermal
equilibrium with the radiation outside the hole and the
detailed equilibrium condition is essentially equivalent to
the conservation laws established elsewhere 18
Substituting Eq 39 into 33 then the imaginary
part of the action can be rewritten as

which is equal to half of the dierence of the initial and

V CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper we have presented a neat extension of
the semi-classical tunneling framework 5 6 in the spher-
ically symmetric black hole cases to deal with Hawk-
ing radiation of massless particles as a tunneling process
through the event horizon of a Kerr black hole and that of
charged particles from a Kerr-Newman black hole The
new form of the Kerr solution found by Doran 16 is espe-
cially appropriate for us to do an explicit tunneling calcu-
lation when transformed into the dragged Painleve-Kerr
coordinate system By treating the background space-
time as dynamical the energy conservation and the angu-
lar momentum conservation as well as the electric charge
conservation are enforced in a nature way when the par-
ticles self-gravitation is taken into account Adapting
this tunneling picture we were able to compute the tun-
neling rate and the radiant spectrum of a Kerr and Kerr-
Newman black hole The resulting probability of particle
emission is proportional to a phase space factor depend-
ing on the initial and nal entropy of the system which
multiplies the square of the quantum mechanical tunnel-
ing amplitude for the process Meanwhile this implies
that the emission spectrum actually deviates from per-
fect thermality but is in agreement with an underlying
unitary theory which is presumably String Theory but
that is beyond the scope of this paper
Before concluding some remarks are in order First
our analysis made here strictly followed the approach
5 6 that visualizes the source of Hawking radiation as a
tunneling process The pertinent point of this approach
is that black hole radiance is a dynamical mechanism for
which conservation laws must be enforced The eective-
ness of the prescribed method is closely related to the
rst law of black hole thermodynamics For a stationary
radiation process where a black hole is in thermal equilib-
rium with the outside radiation the detailed equilibrium
condition suggests quantum conservation laws hold true
18 If the evaporation can stabilize with the end point
of the system being a stable remnant in thermal equilib-
rium with radiation the information could be preserved
Second we would like to stress that the preceding study
is still a semi-classical analysis formally analogous to a
WKB approximation which means that the radiation
should be treated as point particles Such an approxima-
tion can only be valid in the low energy regime If we are
to properly address the information loss problem then a
better understanding of physics at the Planck scale is a
necessary prerequisite especially that of the last stages
or the endpoint of Hawking evaporation
Finally in a separate work 20 the extension made here
has satisfactorily been examined in the case of a 2  1-
dimensional rotating black hole Further application to
the case of rotating black holes in higher dimensions is
in progress
Note added After we nished this work the pa-
per 21 appeared discussing the charged particles tun-
nelling from the Kerr-Newman black hole
