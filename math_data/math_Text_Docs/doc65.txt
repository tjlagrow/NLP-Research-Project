Abstract 
Dendritic cells are known to be activated by a wide range of microbial products leading to 
cytokine production and increased levels of membrane markers such as MHC Class II 
molecules Such activated dendritic cells possess the capacity to activate nave T cells We 
demonstrate here that immature dendritic cells secrete both the YM1 lectin and lipocalin2 By 
testing the ligands of these two poteins respectively chitosan and siderophores we also 
demonstrate that chitosan a degradation product of various fungal and protozoal cell walls  
induce an activation of dendritic cells at the membrane level as shown by the upregulation of 
membrane proteins such as class II molecules CD80 and CD86 via a TLR4-dependent 
mechanism but is not able to induce cytokine production This leads to the production of 
activated dendritic cells unable to stimulate T cells However costimulation with other microbial 
products overcomes this partial activation and restore the capacity of these activated dendritic 
cells to stimulate T cells In addition successive stimulation with chitosan and then by LPS 
induced a dose-dependent change in the cytokinic IL-12IL-10 balance produced by the dendritic 
cells  
1 Introduction 
Appropriate sensing of pathogens is a critical step in launching an adequate immune response 
The  immune  system  has  evolved  to  elaborate  a  complex  system  of  pathogen  surveillance  in 
which specialized molecules called pathogen recognition receptors and specialized cell types 
eg  dendritic  cells  play  important  roles  Dendritic  cells  DCs  are  very  potent  antigen-
presenting cells Upon stimulation by danger signals 1 including signals produced by external 
pathogens but also signals derived from abnormal cells 2 DC undergo activationmaturation to 
an active antigen-presenting phenotype This phenotype includes transfer to the cell surface of 
antigen-laden  MHC  class  II  molecules  also  called  signal  1  up-regulation  of  co-stimulatory 
membrane proteins such as CD80 and CD86 also called signal 2 as well as secretion of pro-
inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa IL6 or IL12 also called signal 3 Recent evidence has 
shown that all three signals are needed to induce T lymphocyte activation 3  
Most  danger  signals  are  sensed  through  receptors  belonging  to  the  Toll-like  receptors  TLR 
family  4  These  receptors  are  able  to  bind  a  wide  range  of  ligands  and  most  of  the  known 
ligands  are  bacterial  products  eg  glycolipids  lipopolysaccharides or  viral ones  eg  double 
stranded RNA However a few endogenous  TLR ligands such as anionic polysaccharides 5-7 
are  also  known  and  may  explain  part  of  the  behavior  of  dendritic  cells  toward  endogenous 
activation signals 2 However little is known about the danger signals coming from eukaryotic 
pathogens  eg  fungi  protozoa  etc  that  are  sensed  by  dendritic  cells  TLR  have  been 
implicated in the sensing of fungal polysaccharides by monocytes 8 9 and dendritic cells 10 
However there are only very few examples in which the TLR involved in fungal polysaccharide 
recognition  has  been  characterized  11  Moreover  there  seems  to  be  several  pathways  for 
polysaccharides sensing leading to different DC phenotypes 12 13  
Moreover sensing of danger signals sometimes involves other molecules than the ligand and the 
TLR as shown by the complex sensing of LPS in which protein mediators such as CD14 14 
and MD2 15 are also implicated 
To gain insights into danger sensing by DC we decided to perform proteomics experiments on 
proteins  secreted  by  immature  dendritic  cells  looking  for  secreted  proteins  binding  putative 
danger signals We found proteins able to bind bacterial siderophores and chitosans and further 
characterized the effects of these ligands on dendritic cells  
2 Material and methods 
21 Cell cultures for proteomics experiments 
Murine  dendritic  cells  were  produced  from  bone  marrow  progenitors  C57BL6  mice  were 
purchased  from  Charles  River  larbresle  France  DC  were  generated  from  bone  marrow  as 
described    16  17  Briefly  bone  marrow  cells  were  isolated  by  flushing  from  the  femurs 
Erythrocytes  and  GR1  positives  cells  were  removed  by  magnetic  cell  sorting  The  remaining 
negatively sorted 
cells  were  resuspended  at  5x105  cellsml  in  complete  Iscoves  modified  Dubelccos  medium 
IMDM supplemented with 1 of GM-CSF-transfected J558cell line supernatant This cell line 
was a generous gift of Dr David Gray London 40ngml of mouse recombinant FLT-3L and 
5ngml of mouse recombinant Il6 At Day 3 the cellular supernatant was removed and the cells 
resuspended in the same conditions From day 6 to day 11 IL6 was removed and FLT3-L was 
reduced to 20ngml At day 11 the bone marrow cells are differentiated in DC and ready for the 
various experiments  In some control experiments dendritic cells were produced without FLT3-
L resulting in a much lower yield of cells The resulting cells are essentially CD8 positive and 
their cytokinic profile upon LPS activation is IL6IL12TNF-high IL10IFN-low 18 In 
some  control  experiments  dendritic  cells  were  cultured  without  FLT3-L  leading  to  a  much 
lower yield of cells However these cells had similar membrane markers and the same capacity 
to secrete cytokines  The cells were washed three times in PBS and then three times in serum-
free  DMEM  and transferred to serum- and phenol red-free medium1 million cells ml When 
needed the dendritic cells were activated by the addition of  1 g of E coli lipopolysaccharide or 
40g of chitosan per ml of culture medium for 24 hours The cell supernates were then aspirated 
collected and centrifuged at 1000g for 5 minutes 4C to pellet detached cells and large debris 
The supernatant was collected and then centrifuged for 1 hour at 100000g 4C to pellet smaller 
debris and vesicles The final supernatant was saved and kept frozen -80C until use 
For protein concentration 18  20 ml of conditioned medium were first cooled on ice in a high 
speed centrifuge tube Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate  was then added to a final concentration of 
01  After  mixing  TCA  was  added  to  a  final  75  concentration  and  the  solution  was 
precipitated  on  ice  for  2  hours  The  mixed  protein-detergent  precipitate  was  collected  by 
centrifugation  10000g  10  minutes  at  4C  The  supernatant  was  carefully  removed  2  ml  of 
tetrahydrofuran precooled in ice  were added to the pellet and vortexing was carried out until 
the pellet unstuck from the bottom of the tube and dissolved almost completely Centrifugation 
was carried out as described above The supernatant was removed and the nearly invisible pellet 
was  washed  again  with  2ml  of  THF  Finally  the  pellet  was  redissolved  in  04  ml  extraction

All experiments were performed at least three times arising from different culture batches  
Chitin from crab shells chitosan 85 deacetylated and oligochitosan lactate were purchased 
from  Sigma-Adrich  The  E  coli  siderophore  was  prepared  from  a  culture  supernatant  as 
described previously 19 starting from a fur- coli strain to maximize siderophore production To 
take into account possible contaminants of the siderophore preparation a control preparation was 
made from a wild type coli strain with very low siderophore production

3 Results  
Immature dendritic cells secrete extracellular sensors 
Activated dendritic cells are known to synthetize many different proteins In addition to the well 
known  cytokine  expression  which  is  even  a  test  to  check  for  dendritic  cell  activation  with 
various  stimuli  14  6  7  recent  work  has  also  shown  that  activated dendritic  cells  secrete 
many other proteins such as proteases or complement proteins 18 28 
Conversely immature dendritic cells secrete very few proteins as shown on figure 1 Among 
those some proteins were quite not surprising as the metalloproteases eg MMP12 18 which 
are likely used by the DC to make their way in and out the peripheral tissues However we were 
quite  surprised  to  detect  some  proteins  which  can  be  viewed  as  extracellular  sensors  such  as 
lipocalin 2 and the YM1 protein Figure 2  shows the mass spectrometry spectra securing these 
identifications detailed data are shown on table 1   Lipocalin 2 is known to bind iron-loaded 
bacterial siderophores 29 while the YM1 protein is known to bind chitin and its derivatives as 
well as heparan sulfates 30 31 We reasoned that these proteins could be synthetized to act as 
extracellular  sensors  of  microbial  products  using  the  same  mechanism  as  soluble  CD14  with 
LPS  To  test  this  hypothesis  we  checked  the  activation  of  DC  by  the  ligands  of  these  two 
proteins namely bacterial siderophores and chitosan 
Chitosan but not bacterial siderophores induce partial activation of dendritic cells 
To test this hypothesis immature dendritic cells produced in culture were put in contact either 
with bacterial siderophores or with chitin degradation products and the activation was measured 
by increased membrane expression of MHC class II molecules stimulation with LPS being used 
as a positive control Initial results not shown were obtained by co-culturing the DC with chitin 
powder and a chitinase thereby mimicking the situation existing in vivo with fungi and protozoa 
In  order  to  gain  further  insight  into  this  action  we  also  used  various  commercially-available 
chitin degradation products chitosans The results shown on figure 3  clearly demonstrate that 
siderophores do not induce any DC activation while chitin degradation products could induce 
this activation We also tested whether a combination of siderophores and LPS also offering a 
better mimick of the situation occurring with Gram-negative bacteria  
This combination of LPS and siderophores tested in various quantitative ratios did not induce 
any  modulation  of  differentiation  compared  to  LPS  alone  neither  at  the  level  of  membrane 
activation nor at the cytokine levels data not shown  
Conversely chitosan of medium molecular mass greater than 40 kDa but neither chitin alone 
nor oligochitosan  lower than 10 kDa was able to induce activation at the membrane level This 
is  in  contrast  with  other  polysaccharides  5  for  which  even  oligosaccharides  are  efficient 
activators of DC  
To gain further insight into this dendritic cell activation we tested the membrane expression of 
the  coreceptors  such  as  CD  80  and  CD  86  The  results  shown  on  figure  4  demonstrate  that 
chitosan is able to induce a complete membrane activation of DC including both the MHC class 
II  and  the  coreceptors  molecules  This  remained  true  whether  we  used  DC  produced  or  not 
within the presence of or without FLT3-L 
Activation of DC by chitosan uses TLR4 
As chitosan is fairly different in its structure from other well-known activators of dendritic cells 
for example it is strongly cationic while most other DC activators are strongly anionic it was 
of interest to determine whether the DC activation proceeded via a TLR-dependent mechanism 
or not and if yes which TLR was implicated From the structure of chitosan we selected TLR4 
as  a  primary  candidate  TLR4  was  of  special  interest  as  heparan  sulfate  which  is  the  other 
ligand  of  YM1  is  known  to  activate  DC  via  a  TLR4-dependent  mechanism  7  To  test  this 
hypothesis DC derived from TLR4-deficent mice were incubated in the presence of chitosan 
LPS or pansorbin The results shown on figure 5 demonstrate that chitosan induced activation is 
impaired in TLR4 -- DC 
Activation of DC by chitosan does not induce cytokine production 
Classical  activators  of  DC  induce  both  membrane  activation  and  cytokine  release  32  We 
therefore  tested  the  release  of  various  cytokines  upon  activation  with  chitosan  As  shown  on 
figure  6  none  of  the  tested  cytokines  were  secreted  upon  chitosan  treatment  even  when  the 
incubation was prolonged to 48 hours and whether we used DC produced or not in the presence 
ofwith or without FLT3-L Figure 7 ajouter aussi sur la figure les temps longs de stimulation 
requete du referee This showed in turn that the activation induced by chitosan cannot be due to 
bacterial  products  contaminating  the  preparation  eg  LPS  or  glycolipids  as  these  products 
would  induce  both  membrane  activation  and  cytokine  release  To  cross  check  whether  this 
absence of detected cytokines could be an immunological artefact  induced by the presence of 
chitosan in the culture medium we added chitosan to the supernatant of LPS-activated dendritic 
cells  just  before  the  immunoassay  for  cytokines  secretion  The  results  were  similar  with  and 
without added chitosan indicating that chitosan did not impair the measurement of the cytokines 
Further  crosscheck  was  made  by  proteomics  techniques  which  do  not  use  antibodies  The 
results shown on figure 8 indicate the presence of TNF spots in LPS-activated cells only but 
neither  in  unstimulated  cells  nor  in  chitosan-stimulated  cells    This  absence  of  cytokine 
production turned us to check the functionality of chitosan-activated dendritic cells 
Chitosan-activated DC do not stimulate T cells 
In  order  to  check  the  functionality  of  chitosan-activated  DC  we  decided  to  use  the  mixed 
lymphocyte reaction Figure 9 shows that chitosan-activated dendritic cells as well as immature 
DC are unable to stimulate T cells while LPS-activated dendritic cells stimulate T cells In the 
case of double stimulation by both chitosan and LPS the activated dendritic cells were able to 
stimulate T cells showing that the chitosan-stimulated cells are not really anergic cells At this 
stage we decided to test the cytokine profile of such mixed T lymphocyte-DC cultures This was 
intended  to  detect  a  partial  activation  of  T  cells  resulting  in  cytokine  production  but  not  cell 
proliferation As shown in figure 10 mixed cultures of T lymphocytes with LPS-activated DC 
cells produced Il-10 IL-6 interferon gamma and IL-2 showing the typical activation of T cells 
IL2  production  with  the  expected  Th1  profile  interferon  gamma  producing  Oppositely 
mixed cultures of T lymphocytes with chitosan-activated T cells produced neither TGF beta nor 
IL-10 IL-4 IL-12  and IL-6 and both interferon gamma and IL-2 secretion remained at a very 
low level although higher than the one obtained when using unstimulated cells 
As DCs  are not described to produce IL-2 nor interferon gamma it can be reasonably inferred 
that these cytokines arise from the T cells In this case the low production of these cytokines in 
mixed cultures of T cells with chitosan-activated T cells suggests that the T cells are not really 
anergic  under  these  conditions  However  the  lack  of  proliferation  and  of  CD69  activation 
suggests that T cells are at most very weakly stimulated  by chitosan-activated T cells 
Chitosan does not prevent restimulation of DCs but reorient it 
At this point it could be argued that chitosan when present alone on dendritic cells induces a 
general block in cytokine production or even a general block in the secretory pathway To test 
this hypothesis we treated dendritic cells first for 24 hours with various doses of chitosan then 
with  LPS  The  results  displayed    on  figure  11  show  that  chitosan  does  not  block  cytokine 
production  Surprisingly  we  also  observed  a  chitosan-dependent  change  in  the  IL10IL12 
balance in the cytokinic profile of stimulated dendritic cells  
4 Discussion 
A very active area of research aims to understand how dendritic cells are activated or made silent 
by  various  signals  Most  of  the  research  effort  has  been  devoted  to  the  identification  of  DC-
activators or danger signals 1 2 and it is only recently that some insights have been given on 
how dendritic cells keep immunologically silent when facing apoptotic bodies 33  
With the multiplicity of exogenous and endogenous danger signals identified to date it appears 
that dendritic cells are very easily activated and able to trigger an efficient immune response 
This poses in turn the question on how pathogens can still be successful While acute bacterial 
infections can be seen as the result of a speed race between pathogen multiplication and immune 
response the persistence of chronic infections with slowly-dividing pathogens sets the question 
on  how  the  pathogens  can  control  the  immune  response  down  to  a  level  where  the  chronic 
infectious state is reached While many of such pathogens hide themselves inside the host cells 
some  eg  fungi  some  protozoans  do  not  and  have  to  face  the  immune  system  during  their 
lifetime in the host organism Perturbing the DC differentiation andor maturation is a strategy 
that is obviously followed by some slowly-dividing pathogens as shown by the examples of M 
leprae  34  and  P  falciparum 35  While the mechanism  used by M  leprae is  still not  clear 
recent work has shown that red blood cells infected by P Falciparum are able to prevent both DC 
activation and the triggering of a Th1 response 35 It has been shown that this effect can be 
mediated  by  the  binding  of  an  endogenous  glycan  chondroitin  sulfate  A  to  the  surface  of 
infected red blood cells 35  
Our  results  on  chitosan  stand  clearly  in  the  same  trend  although  they  are  slightly  different 
While  RBC-bound  chondroitin  sulfate  suppresses  both  membrane  activation  and  cytokine 
production  by  DC  chitosan  does  induce  membrane  activation  but  no  cytokine  production 
resulting in inefficient T-cell priming  
Such  uncoupling  of  membrane  activation  and  cytokine  production  by  DC  is  not  common 
however it has been described on a DC cell line 36 suggesting that the two events are not fully 
linked and can be uncoupled More recently it has been described that complement receptors are 
able to achieve such a partial activation and this has been advocated to result into DC anergy  
33  While  our  T-cell  activation  experiments  show  that  this  is  not  real  anergy  in  our  case 
activation-induced DC death by apoptosis also suggests that such a partial activation will shift 
the balance toward a less efficient immune system just by decreasing the number of DC able to 
present antigens efficiently  
On  a  more  mechanistic  point  of  view  the  situation  of  complex  glycans  as  DC  modulators 
appears quite complex Lipid-containing glycans eg LPS Lipoteichoic acids are well known 
fully potent DC activators following the hydrophobic activator theory 37 However lipid-free 
complex glycans appear to induce very various phenotypes on DC and this seems to depend on 
several parameters 
The first one seems to be the type and size of the potential activating complex eg particle of 
various sizes vs soluble glucide For example large chitin particles have no effect on DC while 
medium-size  chitin  particles  have  a  stimulatory  effect  38  and  soluble  chitosan  has  either  an 
inhibitory  effect  at  medium  size  or  no  effect  at  all  at  low  size  our  present  work  Another 
example of such an effect is represented by chondroitin sulfate but in the reverse order Soluble 
chondroitin  sulfate  mediates  at  least  a  membrane  activation  on  DC  6  during  a  long  term 
exposure but not during a short exposure 7 while the presentation of chondroitin sulfate at the 
surface of a red blood cell induces DC inhibition 35 
While keeping with soluble glycans only the length of the sugar also appears to be a critical 
activation parameter For example short chains of hyaluronan have been shown to fully activate 
DC while longer chain do not 5 This has led to the theory in which only fragments of these 
complex saccharides can act as DC activators and this has been interpreted as a mechanism for 
sensing tissue damage 7 This theory has been extended to several glucan-containing activators 
including bacterial products 37 leading to the idea that partial degradation of the cell walls or 
extracellular  matrix  complex glucans  will  increase  the reaction of DC  The  chitosan  example 
however is a clear exception to this rule Chitosan is produced during the degradation andor 
remodeling of the chitin exoskeleton and our work shows that this degradation product induces 
an incomplete and therefore inefficient DC reaction  
Taken together with the literature our results show that subtle differences in the glycans can lead 
to fairly different DC responses For example related anionic glucides eg chondroitin sulfate 
hyaluronic acid and heparan sulfate have quite different effects on DC It could be argued that 
this  could  be  due  to  differences  in  the  membrane  receptors  andor  soluble  co-receptors 
analogous to TLR4  CD14 for LPS sensing the various glucans However the situation seems 
more complex than that as heparan sulfate LMW hyaluronan full DC activators and chitosan 
partial activator share a common membrane receptor TLR4 while heparan sulfate and chitosan 
share in addition a common soluble binding protein YM1 30 31 It is not known at the present 
time whether YM1 is an obligatory co-receptor for these ligands but it appears quite likely that 
YM1  by  itself  does  not  orient  the  fate  of  dendritic  cells  As  a  matter  of  facts  various  YM1 
ligands  induce  different  fates  for  dendritic  cells  heparan  sulfate  leads  to  a  Th1  response7 
simvastatin a Th2 response 39 and chitosan an inefficient response this work However even 
if the precise role of YM1 in the response of dendritic cells to sugar ligands is unclear so far the 
rationale of YM1 as a co-receptor led us to investigate the response of DC to chitosan and to find 
this peculiar partial activation Maybe the most intriguing feature of this  chitosan response is its 
sensitivity to the context While LPS alone induces the classical Th1 response chitosan alone 
induces  a  phenotypic  activationpartia  without  secretion  of  cytokine  thusl  and  inefficient  to 
stimulate T cells effectively at least at the scale of a immune system responseactivation  
When integrating those results at a higher level it must be kept in mind that we tested CD8 
dendritic  cells  The  results  obtained  on  a  whole  organism  upon  chitosan  administration  40 
showing high IL10 levels may result at least in part from the response of CD8- dendritic cells 
41 Another fungal cell wall component zymosan 42 also induces a weak Th2 response of 
dendritic cells As zymosan engages TLR2 and chitosan TLR4 which are known to be the major 
TLR engaged by fungi 43 this may explain at least in part the fair resistance of fungi to the 
immune system
