Abstract
A diusion equation for a black hole is derived from the Bunster-
Carlip equations
Its solution has the standard form of a Gaus-
sian distribution The second moment of the distribution determines
the quantum of black hole area The entropy of diusion process is
the same apart from the logarithmic corrections as the Bekenstein-
Hawking entropy
Bunster Teitelboim and Carlip showed 1 that the wave function of
a black hole with the Arnowitt-Deser- Misner ADM mass M and area A
evolves according to the Schrodinger-type equations
 M  0

where t is the lapse of asymptotic proper time at spatial innity and  is the
lapse of the hyperbolic angle at the horizon Under Euclidean continuation

continuation E  i and IE  iI
The derivative IEE is just a generalized momentum corresponding to the
angle of rotation about one of the axes say the zth for a mechanical system
Therefore the operator A8G is what corresponds in quantum mechanics
to the z component of angular momentum Lz Quantization of Lz gives the
equidistant area spectrum of a black hole

Medved 3 found this value immediately from the Bunster-Carlip action

area Later on the value 7 was obtained using dierent approaches and
techniques 5
In this note I derive a diusion equation for a black hole from the Bunster-
Carlip equations and show that the black hole motion in Euclidean space
exhibits a diusion process Moreover I nd that the entropy of the process is
the same apart from the logarithmic corrections as the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy
I begin with the Bunster-Carlip equations 1 and 2 Analytically con-
tinuing  and t to the real values of E  i and tE  it we obtain

In the spherical polar coordinates ie in terms of E the z component of the
internal angular momentum A8G is not a product of operators Therefore


where   tE E2 is the probability density of nding the black hole
at point tE E in the Euclidean manifold On the other hand for a
Schwarzschild black hole
 2GM 2
Since according to 8
the equation 13 reads
M 2  h2 2
This is an one-dimensional diusion equation in the temporal E and spatial
tE coordinates with the diusion coecient D  2Gh The solution to the
equation is
4DE
E4DE
which is normalized such that
tE EdtE  1
It follows that the black hole spreads out with increasing time E The
mean square value of tE is given by
Ei  Z 
EtE EdtE  2DE
This result shows that the width of distribution increases as 12
E  which
is a general characteristic of diusion and random walk problems in one
dimension Since regularity of the Euclidean manifold at the horizon imposes
the xed Euclidean angle E  2 we get
Ei  8l2
This value coincides with 7 But 7 is a result of a true quantum-mechanical
quantization of area it arises due to the periodicity of E In contrast 20
can be viewed as a result of discreteness of E in a random walk model In
the model ht2
0 where l0 is the length of each step of a random walk
and N is the number of steps The quantum of area 8l2
P arises if we let 2
be the duration of a step then ht2
0 which being combined with
19 gives l2
P in 20 the quantum
of area Therefore the motion of a black hole in Euclidean space exhibits a
diusion process Thus the elementary act which changes the size of a black
hole is the gain or loss by it of one quantum of area 8l2

Analytical continuation to the cyclic imaginary time E means that we
deal with a quantum system at a nite temperature In this case the system
is described not by the probability density x but by the density matrix
x x  where x is a spatial coordinate and   T 1 is the inverse tem-
perature The partition function Z is the trace of the density matrix
Z  Z x x dx
In 16 tE plays the role of the spatial coordinate The temporal coordinate
E  ktE where k  14GM is the surface gravity Since E has the
interpretation as an angular coordinate with periodicity 2 tE itself has
then periodicity 8GM which when set equal to hTH gives the Hawking
temperature TH Since tE  tE  8GM we have

It is the same apart from a term of order of the Hawking temperature as

I thank an anonymous referee for drawing my attention to a mistake in
deriving the diusion equation in the previous version of the paper
