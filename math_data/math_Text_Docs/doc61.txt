Biological cells are able to accurately sense chemicals with receptors at their surfaces allowing cells
to move towards sources of attractant and away from sources of repellent The accuracy of sensing
chemical concentration is ultimately limited by the random arrival of particles at the receptors by
diusion This fundamental physical limit is generally considered to be the Berg  Purcell limit
HC Berg and EM Purcell Biophys J 20 193 1977 Here we derive a lower limit by applying
maximum likelihood to the time series of receptor occupancy The increased accuracy stems from
solely considering the unoccupied time intervals - disregarding the occupied time intervals as these
do not contain any information about the external particle concentration and only decrease the
accuracy of the concentration estimate Receptors which minimize the bound time intervals achieve
the highest possible accuracy We discuss how a cell could implement such an optimal sensing
strategy by absorbing or degrading bound particles

Single cells can sense external chemical concentrations
with extremely high accuracy For instance the chemo-
tactic bacterium Escherichia coli can detect 32 nM of
the attractant aspartate 1 which corresponds to only
about 3 attractant particles in the volume of the cell
Single eukaryotic cells such as Dictyostelium discoideum
2 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3 budding yeast are
well known to measure and respond to extremely shallow
gradients of chemical signals 4 These observations
raise the question how close do cells operate to the fun-
damental physical limit of sensing accuracy set by the
random arrival of particles by diusion at the receptors
This question was addressed in a seminal work by Berg
 Purcell 5 and recently reinvestigated by Bialek and
Setayeshgar 6 7 Today it is generally accepted that
the limit derived by Berg  Purcell is a fundamental
physical limit which cannot be exceeded In this Letter
we show for a single receptor how this limit can be
improved using maximum likelihood estimation and
discuss how cells could implement this improved sensing
strategy in practice
Berg  Purcell calculated the accuracy of concentra-
tion sensing by a single receptor which binds particles
of concentration c0 with rate kc0 and unbinds particles
with rate k see Fig 1a Specically they considered
a binary time series of total length T composed of bound
and unbound time intervals see Fig 1b Berg  Pur-
cell estimated concentration directly from the fraction
of time T that a particle is bound By considering the
time correlations of particles bound to the receptor they
found the variance c2 in the estimated concentration
to be 5

occupied receptor can bind a particle with rate kc0 and an
occupied receptor can unbind a bound particle with rate k
b Binary time series of receptor occupancy
duration of bound intervals s describes the receptor
dimension and p is the true equilibrium probability for
the receptor to be bound The last equality in Eq 1 is
obtained using detailed balance ie at equilibrium the
rate of unbinding transitions pb must equal the rate of
binding transitions 1  pu where u is the average
duration of unbound intervals For diusion-limited
binding 1u  4Dsc0 yielding the RHS of Eq 1 In
the following we revisit the Berg  Purcell limit on the
accuracy of concentration sensing from the perspective
of maximum likelihood estimation
Maximum likelihood estimation is a statistical method
used for tting a mathematical model to data 8 For a
xed set of data and an underlying parameterized model
maximum likelihood picks the values of the model param-
eters that make the data more likely than they would
be for any other values of the parameters Here the cells
best estimate of concentration can be obtained from max-
imum likelihood applied to the time series t t of du-
ration T with particle binding events at times ti and
unbinding events at times ti see Fig 1b Following
Berg  Purcell we disregard potential rebinding of pre-
viously bound particles assuming diusion is suciently
fast to remove recently unbound particles from the vicin-
ity of the receptor but following 6 7 we address the
more general case in the appendix
The probability for a time series to occur given a par-
ticle concentration c is
P t t c 
pbti tiptiputi ti1pti1
where the probability for a particle to remain bound from
ti to ti is
pbti ti  pbti  ti  ektiti
and the probability for a receptor to remain unbound
from ti to ti1 is
puti ti1  puti1  ti  ekcti1ti
pti  kc and the probability of unbinding at time
ti is pti  k Combining all the bound and all
the unbound time intervals we obtain
2 the probability of binding at time ti
P ti ti c  ekTb  ekcTu  kn
  kcn
where n is the number of binding or unbinding events
which can dier by at most 1 and are therefore approx-
i bui is the
total bound unbound time interval with bi  titi
ui  ti1  ti
imately equal for n  1 and Tbu  Pn
We maximize P t t c over c via
 kTuP 
and obtain for the maximum likelihood estimate of the
particle concentration
Hence the best estimate of the concentration comes only
from the unbound intervals Specically kcML is the
inverse of the average duration of unbound intervals u 
Tun That is kcML is just the average binding rate
estimated from the data
How accurate is the concentration estimate cML To
obtain the uncertainty of the maximum likelihood esti-
mate we require the variance cML2 For a given du-
ration T the last interval possibly an unbound interval
gets interrupted To avoid this complication we consider
a xed number of intervals n and consequently a vari-
able duration T  in Eq 7 We proceed by using a general
relation for the variance of the model parameter here lig-
and concentration c in maximum likelihood estimation
An upper limit of the variance is given by the inverse of
the Fisher information Cramer-Rao bound9 10
our case the Fisher information can be calculated as a
simple second derivative of the probability P of the data
with respect to c averaged over the probability distribu-
tion of the time series at c0 Furthermore in the limit
of a long time series the Cramer-Rao bound becomes an
equality and we obtain for the normalized variance
cML2
dc2 Ec0
0D d2 lnP 
where we used P from Eq 5 11 Hence the normalized
variance of the maximum likelihood estimate of the true
concentration c0 is exactly the inverse of the number of
unbound intervals
In contrast to our result Eq B6 Berg  Purcell found
5 Eq 1
cBP2
where nb is the average number of bound intervals in the
observation time T  Over a long measurement time the
average number of bound and unbound intervals must be
the same so the Berg  Purcell result has exactly twice
the variance of the maximum likelihood result
Why is the maximum likelihood estimate more accu-
rate than the Berg  Purcell estimate Berg  Purcell
assumed that concentration is inferred from the average
bound time eg
as obtained by time averaging the
occupancy of a single receptor or by spatial averaging
over many receptors However as evident from our max-
imum likelihood estimate only the durations of unbound
intervals contain information about the concentration
In contrast the average bound time or equivalently
the average unbound time includes the durations of
the bound intervals which add to the uncertainty in
estimating the concentration
Our result Eq B6
for the variance in the esti-
mate of the concentration c0 also predicts optimal
binding parameters k and k Clearly the more
bindingunbinding events the lower the variance
1 For a given duration T the number of bind-
ingunbinding events is maximized for diusion-limited
binding kmax
  4Ds obtained from the diusive ux
Jmax  4Dsc0 to an absorbing circular patch of radius s
2 Similarly
to maximize the number of bind-
ingunbinding events the unbinding rate k should be
maximized This implies albeit unrealistically that
k  
Under assumptions 1 and 2 the maximum number
of intervals in an observation time T is given by
nmax 
 min
 c0T  4Dsc0T
leading to a variance
According to Eq 14 the derivative dcestdn is given by
cML2
nmax 
est 
n2 c2
This result can be generalized to the more realistic case
of nite k
cML2
4Dsc01  pT
where p  11  k4Dsc0 is the equilibrium probabil-
ity for the receptor to be bound Eq 12 can readily be
compared with the original Berg  Purcell result Eq
1 showing again that the maximum likelihood estimate
is better by a factor 2
The result for a single receptor Eq
extended to M independent
B6 can
receptors
easily be
cM 2c2
0  1M n ie the variance in the estimated
concentration is the inverse of the total number of
unbound intervals for all M receptors However the
concentration estimate cannot become arbitrarily precise
with increasing receptor number since the binding of
particles is ultimately limited by the arrival of particles
by diusion For an absorbing circular patch of radius
s particles arrive by diusion at a rate 4Dsc0
individual receptors of eective radius s bind particles
at the diusion-limited rate 4Dsc0 then the number of
receptors sucient to bind all particles incident on the
patch is M  ss Hence cM 2
0  1ssn
implying that the variance in the concentration estimate
decreases at most linearly with the dimension of the
detecting surface 5
The maximum likelihood concentration estimate Eq
7 is obtained solely from the duration of unbound inter-
vals thus avoiding the additional uncertainty from the
bound intervals What about the alternative scheme of
estimating the concentration from the number of binding
events during a time T  similar to photon counting by
photoreceptors As shown below this estimation scheme
approaches the maximum likelihood limit as the bound
intervals become short
The average number of binding events or equivalently
bound or unbound intervals during a time T is given by
u  b
which provides a concentration estimate cest for c0 in
terms of the observed n
n  1
From the standard deviation of n we obtain the standard
deviation of cest via
cest 
To obtain n for a xed duration T  we note that this
is proportional to the standard deviation T for xed
n via n  dndT T  Using T  nu  b yields
dT dn  u  b
leading to dndT  1u  b
Based on the variance of unbound bound intervals

This variance interpolates between the maximum like-
lihood and the Berg  Purcell results for b  u and
exceeds the Berg  Purcell limit for b  u To pro-
vide some intuition for this result we consider two limits
1 b  u In this regime the brief bound intervals do
not contribute appreciably to T  As a result counting
the number of binding events in a time T is the same as
estimating the mean unbound time interval u This is
exactly the maximum likelihood estimator Eq 7
2 b  u
In this regime the bulk of the time T
is accounted for by the bound intervals Therefore
the number of binding events measures the duration of
the bound intervals not the duration of the unbound
intervals which contain all the information about the
concentration
The Berg  Purcell estimate is more
accurate in this regime because the fraction of time
spent bound eectively measures the ratio of the bound
to unbound time and therefore captures information
about the duration of unbound intervals
Our analysis has neglected additional noise in the con-
centration estimate due to ligand rebinding 6 also see
Appendix A However cells have mechanisms for elim-
inating ligands which could suppress this noise 12 13
Examples include ligand-receptor internalization 14 15
and enzymatic degradation of ligands eg
of cAMP
ligand by membrane bound phosphodiesterases in Dic-
tyostelium discoideum 16 In fact internalization can
be very ecient the transferrin receptor TfR and the
low-density lipoprotein receptor LDLR are internalized
respectively 67 and 49 times faster than their specic
ligands can unbind 17
With or without ligand rebinding to what extent can
real cells exploit any of the above maximum likelihood
schemes
to improve the accuracy of concentration
sensing
It is not clear mechanistically how cells
could sense and respond exclusively to the durations
of unbound intervals Eq
7 The potentially more
practical scheme in Eq 14 of counting the number of
binding events in a time T can approach the maximum
likelihood limit for b  u though too short a bound
interval b might imply low ligand specicity 18 and
potential signaling crosstalk Eective counting can
be achieved by receptor adaptation or desensitization
following ligand binding
An intriguing alternative
is that receptors could bind ligand once and then be
internalized before ligand is released While it is an
open question whether cells actually implement this
optimal strategy we hope the perspective provided
by maximum likelihood will prove useful in interpret-
ing some of the complexities of cellular signaling systems

APPENDIX A MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD
ESTIMATE WITH REBINDING
Following Berg  Purcell our derivation neglected the
rebinding of already measured particles Such rebinding
increases the uncertainty in estimating the concentration
6 12 As rebinding noise can be avoided by ligand-
receptor internalization or ligand degradation on cell sur-
faces 12 13 it does not contribute to the fundamental
physical limit However in practice many receptors do
release and potentially rebind their ligands
The eect of local particle diusion and hence possi-
ble rebinding is to make the instantaneous rate of bind-
ing a functional of the previous binding and unbinding
events see Ref
6 for details The binding rate can
thus be written as kct t t The rate of unbind-
ing remains k so the maximum likelihood estimate of
concentration still comes entirely from the durations of
the unbound intervals
What is the maximum likelihood estimate cML The
probability for a time series is still given by Eq 2 with
the change due to diusion and rebinding occurring in
p  kc  ci and pu
puti ti1  ekcti1tik Ri ctdt
where we have expressed the particle concentration as
ct t t  c  ct t t
 c  ct  ti t  ti A2
dt ct 
and used the notation Ri dt  R ti1
ct t t and ci  cti
The terms can be gathered as before leading to
P t t c  ekTb  ekcTu  kn
c  ciek Ri ctdt
  kn
Importantly all the cs depend only on the times of
events not the value of c so dcdc  0 yielding
 kTuP Xi
c  ci
Setting the above derivative to zero yields an implicit
equation for the maximum likelihood estimate cML
cML  ci
 kTu
where the sum is over all binding events but each ci
depends deterministically on all previous binding and un-
binding events Using again that the variance of a max-
imum likelihood estimator is given by the inverse of the
Fisher information 9 10 we obtain

APPENDIX B ALTERNATIVE DERIVATION
OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATE
WITHOUT PARTICLE REBINDING
Here we obtain the uncertainty of the maximum likeli-
hood estimate cML of the single receptor without particle
rebinding by directly calculating the variance cML2 ex-
plicitly not using the inverse of the Fisher information
As in the main text we consider a xed number of inter-
vals n and consequently a variable duration T 
The ensemble average of Eq 7 in the main text is
simply given by
