LIMIT THEOREMS FOR A COX-INGERSOLL-ROSS PROCESS
WITH HAWKES JUMPS
LINGJIONG ZHU
Abstract In this paper we propose a stochastic process which is a Cox-
Ingersoll-Ross process with Hawkes jumps It can be seen as a generalization
of the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process and the classical Hawkes process
with exponential exciting function Our model is a special case of the ane
point processes Laplace transforms and limit theorems have been obtained
including law of large numbers central limit theorems and large deviations
1 Introduction and Main Results
11 Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Process A Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process is a stochastic
process rt satisfying the following stochastic dierential equation

where Wt is a standard Brownian motion b c   0 and 2bc  2 The pro-

The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process has been widely applied in nance mostly in
short term interest rate see eg Cox et al 5 and the Heston stochastic volatility
model see eg Heston 14 Other applications include the modelling of mortality
intensities see eg extended Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process used by Dahl 6 and of
default intensities in credit risk models see eg as a special case of ane process

A natural generalization of the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process takes into
account the jumps ie
drt  bc  rtdt  rtdWt  adNt
where Nt is a homogeneous Poisson process with constant intensity   0 But
in the real world the occurence of events may not be time-homogeneous and it
should have dependence over time Errais et al
9 pointed out The collapse of
Lehman Brothers brought the nancial system to the brink of a breakdown The
dramatic repercussions point to the exisence of feedback phenomena that are chan-
neled through the complex web of informational and contractual relationships in
the economy This and related episodes motivate the design of models of corre-
lated default timing that incorporate the feedback phenomena that plague credit
markets According to Kou and Peng 15 We need better models to incorporate
the default clustering eect ie one default event tends to trigger more default
In this respect it is natural to replace Poisson process by a simple point process
which can describe the time dependence in a natural way The Hawkes process a
simple point process that has self-exciting property and clustering eect becomes
a natural choice
12 Hawkes Process A Hawkes process is a simple point process N admitting
an intensity

where   R  R is locally integrable left continuous h  R  R and we
always assume that khkL1  R 
ht  sN ds stands
forRt ht sN ds P t ht   where  are the occurences of the points
In the literature h and  are often referred to as exciting function and
rate function respectively An important observation is that a Hawkes process is
Markovian if and only if h is an exponential function One usually assumes that
 is increasing and h is decreasing
A Hawkes process is linear if  is linear and it is nonlinear otherwise Linear
Hawkes process ie the classical Hawkes process is named after Hawkes who rst
invented the model in Hawkes 12 Nonlinear Hawkes process was rst introduced
by Bremaud and Massoulie 4
By the denition of Hawkes process it has the self-exciting property ie the
intensity t increases when you witness a jump It therefore creates a clustering
eect which is to model the default clustering in nance When you do not witness
new jumps the intensity t decreases as h decays
The law of large numbers and central limit theorems for linear Hawkes process
have been obtained in Hawkes and Oakes 13 The law of large numbers and
central limit theorem have also been studied in Bacry et al
1 as a special case
of multivariate Hawkes processes The large deviation principle for linear Hawkes
process was obtained in Bordenave and Torrisi 3 The moderate deviation principle
for linear Hawkes process was obtained in Zhu 21 For nonlinear Hawkes process
the central limit thereom was obtained in Zhu 20 and the large deviations have
been studied in Zhu 18 and Zhu 19
A CIR PROCESS WITH HAWKES JUMPS
The central limit theorem of Hawkes process has been applied to study the high
frequency trading and the microstructure in nance see eg Bacry et al 1 and
Bacry et al 2 and the large deviations result has been applied to study the ruin
probabilities in insurance see eg Stabile and Torrisi 16 and Zhu 22
13 A Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Process with Hawkes Jumps In this paper we
propose a stochastic process rt that satises the following stochastic dierential
equation
drt  bc  rtdt  adNt  rtdWt
where Wt is a standard Brownian motion and Nt is a simple point process with
intensity t    rt at time t We assume that a b c     0 and
stationary process r which satises the dynamics 16
 b  a This condition is needed to guarantee that there exists a unique
 2bc  2 This condition is needed to guarantee that rt  0 with probability
Indeed we know that rt stochastically dominates the classical Cox-
Ingersoll-Ross process and hence 2bc  2 is enough to guarantee rt  0
On the other hand on any given time interval the probability that there
is no jump is always positive which implies that 2bc  2 is needed to
guarantee positivity
The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process with Hawkes jumps preserves the mean-reverting
and non-negative properties of the classical Cox-Intersoll-Ross process In addition
it contains the Hawkes jumps which have the self-exciting property create a clus-
tering eect
Clearly the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process we proposed in 16 includes the classical
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process and the classical linear Hawkes process with exponential
exciting function We summarize this in the following
1 When a  0 or     0 it reduces to the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross
process ie
drt  bc  rtdt  rtdWt
2 When   0 and a   0 it reduces to the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process with
Poisson jumps ie
drt  bc  rtdt  rtdWt  adNt
where Nt is a homogeneous Poisson process with intensity 
3 When c  0 and   0 Nt reduces to a Hawkes process with intensity
t    rt where
and it is easy to see that the intensity t indeed satises

14 Main Results In this section we will summarize the main results of this
paper We will start with conditional rst and second moments of rt and then move
onto the limit theorems ie the law of large numbers central limit theorems and
large deviations Next we show that there exists a unique stationary probability
measure for rt and we obtain the Laplace transform of rt and r Finally we
consider a short rate interest model
The proofs will be given in Section 2

A CIR PROCESS WITH HAWKES JUMPS

and central limit theorem results for linear Hawkes process with exponential exciting
function as in Bacry et al

Remark 10 A natural way to generalize the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process with
Hawkes jumps is to allow the jump size to be random ie

the past history and follows a probability distribution Qda Nt is a simple point

All the results in this paper can be generalized to this model after a careful analysis

We can write down the generator as
r  br
Remark 11 Another possibility to generalize the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process with
Hawkes jumps is to allow the jumps to follow a nonlinear Hawkes process ie rt
satises the dynamics 16 and Nt is a simple point process with intensity rt
where   R  R is in general a nonlinear function This can be considered as
a generalization to the classical nonlinear Hawkes process with exponential exciting
function Because of the nonlinearity we will not be able to get a closed expression
in the limit for the limit theorems or a set of ordinary dierential equations which
are related to the Laplace transform of the process

Proof of Proposition 7 The lecture notes 11 by Hairer gives the criterion for the
existence and uniqueness of the invariant probability measure for Markov processes
Suppose we have a jump diusion process with generator A If we can nd u such
that u  0 Au  C1  C2u for some constants C1 C2  0 then there exists an
invariant probability measure In our problem recall that

Au  C2u  bc  br  a  ar  C2r
 bc  a  a  b  C2r
 bc  a  C1
Next we will prove the uniqueness of the invariant probability measure To get
the uniqueness of the invariant probability measure it is sucient to prove that
for any x y  0 there exists some T  0 such that P xT and P yT are not
mutually singular Here P xT  Prx
T is rT starting at r0  x
For any x y  0 conditional on the event that rx
t have no jumps during
the time interval 0 T  which has a positive probability the law of P xT and
P yT are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on R
which implies that P xT and P yT are not mutually singular
