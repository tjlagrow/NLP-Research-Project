Abstract
In this paper we study Hawking radiation as a massless particles tunneling process
across the event horizon from the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes
pierced by an innitely long spinning cosmic string and a global monopole Applying
the WKB approximation and using a generalized Painleve line element for stationary
axisymmetric spacetimes also by taking into account that the ADM mass of the black
hole decreases due to the presence of topological defects it is shown that the Hawking
temperature remains unchanged for these black holes The tunneling of charged massive
particles from Reissner-Nordstrom black holes is also studied in both cases the tunneling
rate is related to the change of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy The results extend the
work of Parikh and Wilczek and are consistent with an underlying unitary theory
Introduction
Combining the principles of quantum eld and general relativity leads to the emission of thermal
radiation from a black hole known as Hawking radiation This amazing discovery by Steven
Hawking 1 suggest that black holes could lose energy shrink and as a consequence evaporate
completely Stated in other words one can start with some pure quantum state falling into a
black hole and end up after the evaporation with a thermal state which is a mixed state This
implies the loss of information also known as the information loss paradox which continues
to be unsolved
Although many derivations of this radiation have been made 14 recently Perkih and
Wilczek treated Hawking radiation as a tunneling process using a semi classical WKB approxi-
mation 3 According to this picture a particle-antiparticle pair is formed close to the horizon
the particle with positive energy can quantum mechanically tunnel through the horizon and it
is observed at innity as the Hawking ux A number of spherically symmetric and stationary
black holes have been studied for scalar as well as for Dirac particles In particular the Kerr
black hole Kerr-Newman black hole 69 black hole in spacetime with topological defects 78

The aim of this paper is to extend the results presented here 7 and investigate the tunnel-
ing process and the Hawking temperature for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black
holes spacetimes with an innitely long spinning cosmic string and a global monopole In order
to calculate the Hawking temperature we need to remove the coordinate singularity at the
horizon Fortunately there exists a generalization of the Painleve coordinates to stationary
axisymmetric space-times 6 which will be used in this paper
Cosmic strings are one dimensional object that may have been produced by the phase
transition in the early universe The spinning cosmic string is characterized by the rational
parameter a and the angular parameter J given by a  4J The space-time of a cosmic string
has some quite surprising features the spacetime is locally at but globally is conical One
can think about this as locally at space-time with a wedge removed given by the decit angle
  8  G  On the other hand the spacetime geometry of a global monopole of the surface
  2 is conical similar to a cosmic string with decit angle   82G2
The structure of this article is therefore as follows
In Section 2 we briey review and
introduce analogue Painleve-Schwarzschild line element in spacetime with a spinning cosmic
string and a global monopole In Section 3 we calculate the tunneling rate of massless particles
and derive the Hawking temperature for Schwarzschild black hole In Section 4 we derive the
tunneling rate and Hawking temperature for Reissner-Nordstrom cosmic string black holes In
section 5 we derive the tunneling rate of charged massive particles for Reissner-Nordstrom
cosmic string black holes In Section 6 we comment on our results We assume natural units
in which c    k  G  1 and metric signature     throughout the paper
2 Painleve coordinates for a cosmic string black hole
Let us begin by writing the line element of a black hole pierced by an innitely long cosmic
string and a global monopole in spherical coordinates 14
ds2  2dts  ad2  2dr2  r2p2d2  b2 sin2 d2
where   p1  2Mr is the redshift factor b  1  4  the cosmic string parameter which
belongs to the interval 0 1 p2  1  82 encodes the presence of a global monopole and
a  4 J is the rational parameter of cosmic string The metric 21 has a coordinate singularity
at rH  2M which can be removed Starting from the general form of the spacetime metric
21 and taking into account the dragging angular velocity bp    g03g33 than the
stationary spacetime metric 21 can be rewritten as
ds2  
s  2dr2  r2d2
r2b2p2 sin2  2
r2b2p2 sin2   a22
This metric represents a three-dimensional hypersurface in the four-dimensional cosmic string
black hole spacetime Performing a further appropriate coordinate transformation such that
the event horizon to coincide with the innite red-shift surface given by
dts  dt  F r dr  Gr d
where F r  and Gr  are two functions to be determined and satisfying the integrability
conditions F r   Gr r Next by demanding that constant-time slices are at
Euclidean space in radial by impossing the following condition g11  g00F 2r   1 where
g00  g00  g032g33 than one can nd a general axisymmetric Painlieve line element 11
ds2  g00dt2  2pg001  g11dt dr  dr2
 cid2g00Gr 2  g22cid3 d2  2g00Gr dt d
 2pg001  g11Gr dt d 
This metric has several attractive properties It is well behaved at the event horizon rH  2M
the coordinate t represent the local proper time for radially free falling obsorver constant-time
slices are just at Euclidian space in radial and nally this metric satises Landaus condition
of coordinate clock synchronization see eg 6 Using the metric 21 and 24 it follows
that the Painleve-Schwarzschild cosmic string black hole line element for constant   2 is
given by
ds2  
r2b2p2 2
r2b2p2  a22 dt2  2s 2Mrb2p2
r2b2p2  a22 dt dr  dr2
Solving for the radial null geodesics d  ds2  0 one can show that
r 
qr2b2p2  a21  2M
r  1 r 2M
where the  sign correspondts to an outgoning ingoing geodesics respectively
particular case b  1 p  1 and a  0 Eq25 reduces to Painleve- Schwarzschild line
element without topological defects
3 Particles tunneling from Schwarzschild black hole
The tunneling rate is related to the imaginary part of the action in the classically forbidden
  e2 Im S
Since the metric 24 is independent of the coordinate  we can completely eliminate this
degree of freedom by writing the action in the form
S Z tf
L  P  dt
by taking the imaginary part of the action it follows
Im S  ImZ rout
 ImZ rout
Pr r  P 
rin  Z PrP
r dP 
r   dP 
These equations are modied when the particles self-gravitation is taken into account 5
Fixing the ADM mass of the total background spacetime and allowing them to uctuate when
a particle with a shell of energy  is tunneld out the mass of the black hole and angular
momentum will be reduced to M   M   and J   M  a respectively On the other
hand due to the presence of a cosmic string the ADM mass Mbp energy Ebp and angular
momentum Jbp of black hole are decreased by a factor of b p2 7 8
Mbp  p2 b M Ebp  p2 b E Jbp  p2 b J
Of course the energy of the shell  should be also replaced by p2 b  So when the particle
tunnels out the ADM mass becomes bp2M   and the angular momentum bp2aM  
respectively We can now use the Hamiltons equation
 bp2 dM  
 bp2 dM

where dHrPr  
of the particle at the horizon vanishes
HdJ  bp2 a
H dM   On the other hand the dragging angular velocity
where 2  1  2M  r Therefore we only have to work out the radial part of the action
given by
a 2rH
r2b2p2  a2 2rH cid12cid12cid12cid12rH 2M 
Im S  ImZ bp2M 
Now since the particles tunnel out the energy will be dH  b p2 dM    b p2 dM 
which implies that we must choose the positive sign in Eq25 than the action reads
Im S  Im Z bp2M

here we regard  as a constant and M  as a variable Using the Feynmans prescription i for
positive energy solution     i we obtain M  M  i so that the last equation can be
rewritten as
and the functions f M  is given by

rin  2M to rout  2M   Than Eq310 can be written as
Here the mass ranges from bp2M to bp2M   wile the radial coordinates ranges from
Im S  ImZ rout

where P stands for the principal value Since we are interested only for the imagionary part
we can ignore the rst term because it is real and nd

Substituting this result into the Eq31 the tunneling probability of outgoing particles in
terms of the change of the entropy of the black hole will be
  e2 Im S  exph8bp2Mcid161 
2Mcid17i  exp SBHbp 
where SBHbp  SBHbpM    SBHbpM is the change of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
before and after the emission Although the entropy and surface area depend on the parameters
bp2 their relation remains unchanged Neglecting the quadratic term in Eq
314 since
M   it follows
The energy of the particles in this spacetime also decreases by a factor of bp2 and therefore
the Boltzmann factor will be   exp H bp2 where H  1T  The Hawking temperature
will be
  expcid08 b p2 Mcid1 
As a result we have shown that the Hawking temperature for Schwarzschild black hole in
spacetime with a spinning cosmic string and a global monopole remains unchanged as seen at
innity
4 Tunneling from Reissner-Nordstrom black hole
Recall that line element for the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole pierced by an inntly long cosmic
string and a global monopole reads
ds2  dt  a d2  1dr2  r2p2d2  b2 sin2 d2
where the function r is given by
 r  1 
r  rr  r
where r  M pM 2  Q2 gives the distance from the center of the black hole to the horizon
Using Eqs
simply by replacing 2Mr with 2Mr  Q2 yielding
24 and 41 one can easy nd the corresponding Painleve type coordinates
ds2  
r2b2p2r
r2b2p2  a2r
dt2  2s b2p2 2Mr  Q2
r2b2p2  a2r
dt dr  dr2
This metric is well behaved at r  M pM 2  Q2 Solving for the radial null geodesics
for an outgoing massless particle d  ds2  0 yields
pr2b2p2  a2r 1 r 2M
setting b  1 a  0 and p  1 into the 44 we recover the Painleve line element for the
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole without topological defects 3 Again these equations are
modied when the particles self-gravitation is taken into account It is not dicult to see that
the dragging angular velocity of the particle at the horizon vanishes
where   1  2M  r  Q2r2 and r
action using Eq 44 with positive sign it follows that

  M   pM  2  Q2 In terms of the
qr2b2p2  a2

We can solve this integral by using the Feynmans prescription i for positive energy solution
    i and obtain M  M  i with f M  given by
f M   qr2b2p2  a2   bpr p2M r2  Q2
qr2b2p2  a2 
Using the fact that the radial coordinates ranges from rin  M pM 2  Q2 to rout 
M   pM  2  Q2 solving the integral we nd

We can now use this result and calculate the tunneling probability of outgoing particles

The outgoing particle starts from just inside the horizon rin  M pM 2  Q2   and
traverses just outside the horizon rout  M   pM  2  Q2   We can rewrite the
last result in terms of the change of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy before and after the emission

Which is the Hawking temperature for Reissner-Nordstrom black hole without a topological
defects in full agreement with Parikhs results 3 Furthermore the emission spectrum is no
longer purely thermal but has some corrections due to the energy conservation law
5 Tunneling of massive particles from Reissner-Nordstrom
black holes
In the case of tunneling process of massive particles it is clear that the trajectory of a massive
particle cannot be described by light-like geodesics This problem was solved using the de
Broglies hypothesis 10 We can consider the outgoing particle as a massive shell whose phase
velocity vphase and group velocity vg are given by
vphase 
vg vphase 
here rc denotes the radial position of the particle described by the weave packet r t Since
the tunneling process is an instantaneous eect the dragged Reissner-Nordstrom cosmic string
black hole metric 43 satises Landaus condition of the coordinate clock synchronization
with the coordinate time dierence of these two events given by
dt  
d  0
This metric is well behaved at r  M pM 2  Q2 and satisfy Landaus condition of
coordinate clock synchronization The phase velocity is given by
qcid01  
r2cid1 r4b2p2  a2
where   r2  2Mr  Q2 The group velocity on the other hand is given by
2qcid01  
r2cid1 r4b2p2  a2
When a charged particle with energy  and charge q is tunneld out the mass angular
momentum and the charge of the black hole will be reduced to M   M  a and Q  q
respectively The corresponding Komars charge of the black hole also decreases by a factor of
bp2 due to the presence of topological defects Qbp  bp2Q And clearly when a particle tunnels
out from the black hole the charge of the black hole reduces to bp2Q  q However in this
scenario we also have to take into account the eect of the electromagnetic eld 14FF 
described by A Therefore the Hamiltons equation reads
dPrcid12cid12cid12cid12rPAtPAt

When the particles self-gravitation is taken into account and make use of the fact that the
dragging angular velocity 
therefore the electric potential at the event horizon in the dragging coordinate system will be
 vanishes at the horizon r

Since the metric 43 is independent of the coordinate  and At we can complitly eliminate
these two degrees of freedom by writing the action of the charged massive particle in the form

Using the Feynmans prescription i for positive energy solution     i and charge

Using the determinant of the metric 41 and the corresponding surface area of the Reissner-
Nordstrom black hole before and after the emission of the particle one can check that the
tunneling rate in terms of the change of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy SBHbp  SBHbpM

Setting q  0 and doing a Taylor series expansion of 511 to the rst order in  and using
the Boltzmann factor   exp Hbp2 we recover the correct Hawking temperature 410
for massive particles
6 Conclusion
In this paper we have investigated the Hawking radiation of massless particles using a semi-
classical WKB approximation for the case of Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes
with topological defects By introducing a Painleve type coordinates and taking into account
that the ADM mass energy and angular momentum shifts due to the presence of a cosmic
string and a global monopole we have calculated the tunneling probability of outgoing par-
ticles By comparing the tunneling rate with the Boltzmann factor we have calculated the
Hawking temperature for these black holes As a result we have shown that the Hawking ra-
diation remains uneected by the presence of topological defects in both cases For the case of
charged massive particles we have also recovered the same Hawking temperature for Reissner-
Nordstrom black hole here the radial trajectory can be determined by using the de Broglies
hypothesis Finally the results in this paper extend the Perkihs work and are consistent with
an underlying unitary theory
