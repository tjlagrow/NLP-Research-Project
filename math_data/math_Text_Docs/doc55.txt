Abstract
When a ligand that is bound to an integral membrane receptor is pulled
the membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton can deform before either the
membrane delaminates from the cytoskeleton or the ligand detaches from the
receptor If the membrane delaminates from the cytoskeleton it may be further
extruded and form a membrane tether We develop a phenomenological model for
this processes by assuming that deformations obey Hookes law up to a critical
force at which the cell membrane locally detaches from the cytoskeleton and a
membrane tether forms We compute the probability of tether formation and show
that they can be extruded only within an intermediate range of force loading rates
and pulling velocities The mean tether length that arises at the moment of ligand
detachment is computed as are the force loading rates and pulling velocities that
yield the longest tethers

1 INTRODUCTION
Adhesion between cells plays an important role in a number of biological processes
involving cell motility and cell-cell communication Cell-cell adhesion is mediated by
integral membrane proteins on the surfaces of interacting cells Cadherins which
mediate binding between cells of the same type within a tissue bind to themselves
while integrins which mediate binding between dierent cell types bind to Inter-
Cellular Adhesion Molecules ICAMs or Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecules VCAMs
1 Understanding the physics of this adhesive interaction requires an understanding
of both the protein-protein bond as well as the cells mechanical response when these
bonds become stressed If forces act to pull the two cells apart either of the cells
cytoskeletons and plasma membranes may deform Under certain conditions the lipid
membranes can delaminate from the underlying cytoskeleton and be pulled into long
tethers At any time during this process the bonds holding the two cells together may
also break arresting tether extraction
A specic biological process in which bond dissociation and membrane
deformation must be considered simultaneously is leukocyte extravasation which is
part of the process by which leukocytes are recruited to inamed or infected tissue
Endothelial cells that make up blood vessels preferentially express cellular adhesion
Pulling Membrane Tethers
molecules including selectins near wounded tissue Leukocytes circulating in the
blood can then bind to the endothelial cells via their own cell surface proteins Bonds
between the leukocytes and the endothelial tissue are transiently made and broken as
a shear ow in the blood vessel pushes the leukocyte rolling it across the endothelial
layer 2 The rolling leukocytes contain microvilli that are enriched in adhesion
molecules that preferentially attach to endothelial cells During rolling these microvilli
tethers can extend under the hydrodynamic shear force of blood ow in the vessel 3
At the same time forces imposed on the endothelial membrane via the adhesion
molecule can cause the endothelial membrane to form a tether 4 Tether formation
and extension of microvilli can decrease the force that the adhesive bond feels from
the shear blood ow
Both the physics of cell membrane deformation and the mechanics of ligand-
receptor bonds have been studied extensively Micropipette atomic force microscope
AFM optical trap and magnetic bead techniques have been used to pull membrane
tethers from cells and probe the properties of the cell membrane 5 The diameter of
the extracted tether depends on the membrane surface tension and bending rigidity
and if the tether is being extended at a constant velocity the membrane viscosity 6 7
Therefore these quantities can be inferred from tether pulling or poking experiments
8 Theoretically Euler-Lagrange methods have been used to compute equilibrium
tether shapes and the force-extension curve for a tether pulled quasi-statically from a
lipid vesicle 9 10 These theoretical models of pure lipid bilayers show only a  10
overshoot or barrier in the force-extension curve before a tether is extracted from
an asymptotically at membrane 9 10 some experiments show a signicant force
barrier to tether formation 11 12 13 These large force barriers to membrane tether
formation arise in living cells and is attributed to membrane adhesion to the underlying
actin cytoskeleton 11 14 When tethers are pulled from giant articial vesicles the
size of the force barrier can increase only when the area on which the pulling force is
exerted is increased 12 For smaller vesicles area and volume constraints may also
inuence the tether force-extension relationship 15 These may arise from nonlocal
terms in the functional describing the lipid membrane energetics For example area-
dierence elasticity can give rise to a restoring forces that continually increase as
tether length increases 16 17 Such nonlocal eects will be important only when the
tether comprises an appreciable fraction of the total membrane area Force curves that
do not saturate at long tether extensions can also arise when part of the membrane
reservoir adheres to a substrate 13 The relative importance of nonequilibrium forces
arising from the viscosity of both the membrane lipids and surrounding solution have
also been estimated 18
During tether pulling experiments and in their corresponding theoretical models
the molecular bond attaching the pulling device to the membrane is assumed to
always remain intact However a typical ligand-receptor bond used to connect the
pulling device to the lipid membrane and possibly the underlying cytoskeleton can
rupture upon pulling Although the details of a bonds energy landscape can be
probed using dynamic force spectroscopy 19 20 21 22 one can usually assume
that bond rupturing is dominated by a single activation barrier that can be lowered
by an externally applied pulling force Most AFM studies of molecular strength
are performed on proteins that have been isolated from cells However recent
 The barrier represents the energy that must be overcome before a lipid tether can be drawn out
The  10 energy barrier arises from the Helfrich free-energy-minimizing geometry of an incipient
lipid membrane tether in the absence any cytoskeletal attachments9 10 cf dashed curve in Fig 2
Pulling Membrane Tethers
studies have probed bond strengths between proteins still embedded in a live cell
membrane 23 24 While using live cells has the advantage that the post-translational
modications of membrane proteins are preserved the mechanical deformation of the
cells cytoskeleton and membrane must also be taken into account To model this
system a viscoelastic Kelvin model was used to t experimental measurements of the
force-extension relationship to determine eective cellular adhesion 24
In this paper we develop a dynamic model that incorporates phenomenological
theories of membrane and cytoskeleton deformation tether extraction and the kinetics
of ligand-receptor detachment In contrast to an equilibrium model determining tether
extraction and detachment from an adhered vesicle 15 we nd relationships that
dene when tether extraction is likely and the typical length of the tether pulled
before the ligand-receptor bond ruptures In the next section we motivate a simple
mechanical model using phenomenological forms for the force-extension relationship of
the membrane Given the large bending energies of lipid bilayer membranes and the
relatively strong attachment of membranes to cytoskeleton we will neglect thermal
uctuations of the membrane but implicitly include thermally-driven ligand-receptor
bond dissociation Dynamical equations are written for two commonly employed
experimental protocols a linear force loading rate and a constant bond pulling speed
In the Results and Discussion we compute the probability of tether formation and
plot universal curves that delineate regimes where tethers are likely to form Mean
tether lengths are also plotted for both pulling protocols
2 Mathematical Model
Consider the system depicted in Figure 1 A ligand is bound to an integral membrane
protein which may also be directly associated with the cytoskeleton The ligand may
be attached to a pulling device via a cantilever spring and is pulled with either a xed
speed or a force that increases linearly in time
As the ligand is pulled the cytoskeleton rst deforms and eventually can detach
from the membrane At this point the lipid membrane may ow into a tether At
any point during the cytoskeletal or membrane deformation before or after membrane-
cytoskeleton delamination and tether formation the ligand axed to the pulling device
may detach from the membrane receptor protein
21 Membrane Mechanics
We rst consider the response of the membrane-cytoskeleton system to an externally
applied pulling force Fpt The rate at which the receptor-ligand complex moves will
be described by
  U x
x cid12cid12cid12cid12xxt  Fpt
where  is a mobility that is inversely related to the viscosity of the membrane lipid
In general although  depends on the conguration of the system dened
predominantly by xt we neglect the details of this dependence and assume it to
be constant
The term U x represents the energetic cost associated with deforming the cell
membrane and underlying cytoskeleton when the receptor is displaced a distance x
normal to the at membrane This phenomenological energy can be derived from
Pulling Membrane Tethers
cantilever
cell membrane
cytoskeleton
Figure 1 a A cell membrane can be pulled by a device such as a cantilever
The device can be moved at xed velocity V  or at a specied force Fpt Under
specied force conditions the transduction of force through the device is assumed
instantaneous such that Fpt is always acting across the ligand-receptor bond
Before membrane delamination from the underlying cytoskeleton the pulling
results in small membrane and cytoskeletal deformations b After membrane
delamination the pulling device can extrude long lipid tethers without deforming
the cytoskeleton The total system length z is the sum of the displacement x of
the membrane protein from its initial position and  the increase in the length of
the cantilever spring from its unstretched length
a detailed consideration of the membrane-cytoskeletal mechanics For simplicity we
will assume the membrane mechanics are governed by a Helfrich free-energy 25 that
includes a lipid bilayer bending rigidity and an eective thermally-derived entropic
membrane tension We will assume that the membrane reservoir is large enough such
that an extruded tether negligibly depletes the reservoir Hence global contributions
to the membrane energetics such as area-dierence elasticity can be neglected
Experiments in which tethers were pulled from live cells found a signicant force
barrier to tether formation 11 14 While a smaller force barrier can also arise in
pure lipid membranes 9 we will assume that the plasma membrane is attached to an
underlying cytoskeleton with anchoring molecules which we model as a linear elastic
material provided the deformation is small The receptor that binds the ligand that is
attached to the pulling device can also be a transmembrane receptor that is directly
attached to the cytoskeleton As the membrane is initially pulled the cytoskeleton
will elastically deform as a Hookean spring The receptor or anchoring molecules
will break at a deformation x0 and the lipid membrane will be drawn into a tether
This occurs at a critical delamination force Fc Thus for displacements x  x0
where the Hookean approximation for the membrane-cytoskeleton assembly is valid
the membrane-cytoskeleton carries an eective spring constant Fcx0 where Fc is the
critical delamination force Experimentally the cytoskeleton typically detaches from
the membrane where the lament-free tether forms 26 27 therefore we can assume
a linear force extension relationship of the form
x  x0
Pulling Membrane Tethers
At a displacement x  x0 the membrane delaminates from the cytoskeleton and
a lipid membrane tether forms Under the innite reservoir and simple Helfrich
free-energy assumption the tether can then elongate indenitely under a constant
force Ux  F0 that is intrinsic to the lipid tether and is determined by the
membrane bending rigidity  and entropic surface tension  9 10 F0  22
The phenomenological membrane force-displacement relationship for both attached
Figure 2 We assume that when the receptor is initially associated with the
cytoskeleton xU x increases linearly until some maximum force Fc in the barrier
to tether formation is reached after which the tether extends with constant force
F0 solid curve The qualitative features of this force-extension curve is observed
in numerous systems 7 11 12 13 14 For reference we show xU x as a
function of x when the only contributions to U x come from membrane surface
tension and bending rigidity dashed curve This curve was calculated using the
method described in 9 assuming a membrane bending rigidity of 20kB T and a
surface tension of 00076 dynescm
solid curve and free dashed curve membranes are shown in Figure 2 The barrier
Fc to tether formation is larger for receptors or membranes that are attached to the
underlying cytoskeleton than for the free lipid membrane case
In order to close the equations of our basic model we must specify Fpt
Henceforth we will consider two cases typically realized in experiments a linearly
increasing in time pulling force and a xed pulling speed

For a force linearly increasing in time Fpt  t where  is the rate with which the
force increases Eq 1 becomes

23 Constant Pulling Speed
In the case of constant pulling speed we must include the dynamics of the device
deformation t Since the velocity of the pulling device is xed we note that the
total displacement zt  xt  t obeys
This equation holds only when the ligand is attached to the membrane-bound receptor
Let us assume that the pulling device has an internal response that is modeled by a
simple spring so that the force Fpt that the spring exerts on the ligand is
Fpt  Kt
where K is the spring constant of the pulling device Since the pulling force is
proportional to t it will ultimately depend on the pulling rate V and the physical
properties of the pulling device represented by an elastic cantilever in Figure 1 and
cell membrane through Eq 7 Upon integrating Eq 7 and using the initial conditions

24 Ligand-Receptor Dissociation
The dynamics described above for the membrane and pulling device deformations
assume that the pulling device remains attached to the membrane through an unbroken
ligand-receptor bond Since all external forces are transduced through the ligand-
receptor bond the pulling force Fpt on the membrane cf Eq 1 vanishes once
the ligand-receptor bond ruptures However the probability of ligand-receptor bond
dissociation itself depends on the applied force Fpt We can model the breaking
of the ligand-receptor bond by a Poisson process and dene a ligand-receptor bond
survival probability Qt that obeys
 krtQt
where krt is the force-dependent rupture or dissociation rate of the ligand from
the receptor We assume that krt takes a simple Arrenhius form 28
krt  k0eFptdkB T 
where d is the length of the ligand-receptor bond and kBT is the thermal energy The
solution to Eq 14 is explicitly
Qt  expcid20k0Z t

More complex models of dynamics bond rupturing can be derived 29 30 Here
for simplicity molecular details such as the thermally-induced bond-breaking attempt
frequency and the intrinsic free energy of the unstressed ligand-receptor bond are
subsumed in the eective rate parameter k0
Since wt  dQtdt  krtQt is the bond rupture time distribution
the mean membrane displacement at the time of ligand-receptor rupture the mean
maximum displacement is given by

In our subsequent analysis we will combine bond rupturing statistics with
membrane tether dynamics and explore as a function of the physical parameters
the probability of tether formation and the length of pulled tethers should they form
To be concrete we will use typical parameter values listed in Table I found from the
relevant literature to guide our analysis

The bond survival probability evaluated at the time of tether formation t0 found
numerically from Eq 6 Qt0  PT determines the likelihood that a tether is
extracted and is plotted in Fig 3a as a function of force loading rate  Note
that PT rst increases with the force loading rate  before decreasing again at very
high loading rates Large critical delamination forces Fc increase the probability
that ligand-receptor bonds detach before membrane-cytoskeleton delamination occurs
Membrane-cytoskeleton combinations that have weaker delamination forces Fc yield
a larger range of force loading rates that lead to tether formation Moreover since
the pulling force is specied Qt is independent of the free tether restoring force F0

the cytoskeleton-free membrane restoring force does not aect tether formation

delamination force fc as shown in Fig 4a but the value of  at which hX i is
maximized decreases as fc is raised Since tether extrusion is a competition between
the rate of climb against the restoring force Fcxx0 and ligand-receptor dissociation
as fc is increased higher ramp rates are required to cross the delamination barrier
faster relative to the bond rupturing Although the free membrane restoring force
f0  F0k0x0 does not come into play in the tether formation probability it does
inuence the mean length of lipid tether that is extruded before the ligand detaches
from the membrane-bound receptor Note that in the constant loading rate protocol
the force is specied and all results are independent of the pulling device rigidity K

this ensemble will depend on the will depend on the pulling device rigidity K The

where t is given by Eqs 11 and 12 Initially while the membrane and cytoskeleton
are attached to each other and constant speed pulling is applied the ligand-receptor
bond survival probability Qt rst decreases rapidly After delamination the force
on the ligand-receptor are xed arising only from F0 and the viscous drag 1 The
subsequent decay of Qt arises from a slower single exponential
Fig 5a shows the corresponding PT as a function of pulling speed V  and as in
the force ramp case reveals an optimal pulling speed that maximizes the likelihood
of pulling a tether In the V  0 limit xt  0 from Eqs 9 and 12 and we expect
PT  0 because when the ligand-receptor bond detaches the membrane has not been
suciently deformed In the fast pulling limit the detachment rate increases quickly
and ligands detach at very short times t such that tether formation cannot occur

suppress tether formation at low speeds since the forces are not immediately felt by
the membrane allowing the ligand more time to detach However softer pulling
devices greatly enhance tether formation at large pull speeds because the accelerated
delamination more than compensates for the drag-mediated acceleration of ligand-
receptor dissociation

Finally consider the mean receptor displacement at the moment of ligand
detachment hX i  hxix0 found from Eq 17 with Xt  v  tx0 and
the appropriate Qt and krt The same arguments that explain the non-monotonic
behavior of PT as a function of V apply here and the mean dimensionless receptor
displacement at the moment of ligand detachment hX i is a non-monotonic function
of V Fig 7 When the pulling velocity is small the receptor moves slowly and the
term xt in Eq 17 will be small rendering integral in Eq 17 small On the other
hand when V is suciently large the viscosity 1 allows a large force to be reached
accelerating ligand-receptor bond rupturing Thus Qt quickly decreases and the
mean receptor displacement when the ligand detaches hxi will be small
Pulling Membrane Tethers
Figure 7 a The mean system length at ligand detachment hX i is a non-
monotonic function of the dimensionless pulling velocity v and increases with
decreasing fc The qualitative dependence of hX i on f0 is similar to that shown
in Fig 4 b The mean maximum tether length as a function of v for various
dimensionless pulling device stinesses 
Both constant force load rate and constant pulling speed protocols give
qualitatively similar tether extraction probabilities and maximum delamination forces
 This is not surprising since in the two protocols are physically equivalent in
both the innitely sti and innitely soft pulling device limits prior to delamination
In the large   K limit a constant pulling speed forces the ligand to have the
trajectory xt  V t Because we assume a linear force-extension relationship before
delamination this protocol is equivalent to a high constant force loading rate of
  KV or   v In the extremely soft pulling device limit the elastic pulling
device absorbs most of the extension and the force at which it acts on the ligand also
increases linearly in time   FcV x0 or   vfc
However we do nd a qualitative dierence in the mean tether length extracted
due to dierence in the post-delamination forces between the two protocols As
functions of load rate and pulling speed the maximum mean tether lengths attainable
via linear force ramp are typically less than half of those achieved through constant
pulling speed all else being equal This feature can be understood by considering
how the receptor displacement xt and the ligand dissociation rate krt depend on
time in each case When the pulling speed is constant after the tether forms xt
increases linearly in time and krt is constant When we apply a force ramp to the
system xt increases quadratically in time once tether formation occurs This would
seem to imply longer tethers under the force ramp protocol however in this case the
dissociation rate krt also increases exponentially in time Thus ligand detachment is
much faster in the force ramp case resulting in shorter observed mean tether lengths
4 Summary and Conclusions
We modeled membrane-cytoskeleton delamination in series with a ligand-receptor
bond and a deformable pulling device and determined the parameter regimes within
which lipid tether extrusion is likely Results from our model can be directly used to
propose and analyse experiments in which cell or lipid vesicle membranes are pulled by
Pulling Membrane Tethers
a breakable bond For example in 11 tethers are pulled from endothelial cells when
large force barriers are overcome but detachment of the pulling device from the tether
is not considered Performing such experiments with breakable ligand-receptor binds
would provide the necessary data with which to test our predictions on the likelihood
of tether formation and on the dierences between xed load rate and pulling speed
protocols
For both linear force ramp and constant pulling speed protocols we nd a wide
window of ramp rates and pulling speeds that likely lead to tether extraction However
we also nd critical values of a dimensionless membrane-cytoskeleton delamination
force and a dimensionless spontaneous ligand-receptor dissociation rate beyond which
tether formation is unlikely regardless of all other parameters We assumed in all of
our analysis that the tether force-extension curve can be derived from local interactions
with a Helfrich free-energy model Finite-size membrane reservoirs and nonlocal
energies such as area-dierence elasticity would give rise to increasing forces as the
tether is extended thereby increasing the probability of ligand-receptor dissociation
and decreasing expected tether lengths hX i
Both linear force ramp and constant pulling speed protocols yield intermediate
tether formation regimes with a specic pulling speed v and specic linear ramp rate
 that maximizes the mean tether length hX i in the respective protocol However
they present dierent tether dynamics after delamination leading to dierent expected
tether lengths hxi Using both protocols and our results it may be possible to
characterize membrane-cytoskeleton properties provided sucent information about
the ligand-receptor binding energy and pulling device response are known In general
such inverse problems are very ill-posed but restricting the force-extension relationship
to simple forms as we have done one may be able to use the onset of tether formation
as a way to estimate force parameters such as F0 Fc and x0
While we have framed our analysis in terms of AFM experiments in which the
strength of a ligand-receptor bond is probed while the receptor is in the membrane of
a live cell our basic model is relevant to leukocyte rolling as well In leukocyte rolling
a bond between protein on a leukocyte microvilli and a protein in the membrane of
an endothelial cell becomes stressed Because the microvilli act like Hookean springs
when pulled 3 and simultaneous extension of microvilli and tether extraction from
the endothelial cells has been observed 4 our analysis is directly applicable to this
system with the cantilever replaced with a microvilli
Finally we note that we have treated the ligand-receptor bond rupturing as a
stochastic Poisson process while the deformation of membrane and cytoskeleton was
considered deterministic This approximation is good as long as x0  d However
if the experiment is repeated each region of membrane may have highly variable
attachments to the cytoskeleton In this case a distribution of delamination forces
Fc should be considered Another source of stochasticity may arise when multiple
adhesion points are being pulled possibly leading to multiple tethers 36 If the entire
system is treated as a single eective tether the force-extension of this super-tether
will rely on the statistics of how many individual tethers are still attached during the
dynamics
