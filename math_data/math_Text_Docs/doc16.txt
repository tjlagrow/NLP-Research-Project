Summary  
With  the  development  of  high  throughput  sequencing  technology  it  becomes  possible  to  directly  analyze 
mutation distribution in a genome-wide fashion dissociating mutation rate  measurements from the traditional 
underlying assumptions Here we sequenced several genomes of Escherichia coli from colonies obtained after 
chemical mutagenesis and observed a strikingly nonrandom distribution of the induced mutations These include 
long stretches of exclusively G to A or C to T transitions along the genome and orders of magnitude intra- and 
inter-genomic  differences  in  mutation  density  Whereas  most  of  these  observations  can  be  explained  by  the 
known features of enzymatic processes the others could reflect stochasticity in the molecular processes at the 
single-cell  level  Our  results  demonstrate  how  analysis  of  the  molecular  records  left  in  the  genomes  of  the 
descendants of an individual mutagenized cell allows for genome-scale observations of fixation and segregation 
of mutations as well as recombination events in the single genome of their progenitor  
Introduction  
Cells can copy their genetic material with exceptional accuracy the spontaneous mutation frequency in E coli 
being as low as 410-10 base substitution mutations per base pair bp per generation The robust amplification 
of the effects of an individual molecular event resulting from such accuracy has long set genetics apart from 
biochemistry as a discipline able to study individual events such as mutations or recombinations at the level of 
a single organism Yet until recently the studies of genetic variability in living cells had been limited to very 
few genetic systems and typically relied on various selection screens 1 Making genome-scale inferences from 
these experiments requires the assumption of uniform event distribution which is highly questionable due to the 
phenomenon  of  mutation  hot  spots  12  Also  in  light  of  the  phenomenon  of  adaptive  mutations  3-5  it  is 
preferable  to  study  genetic  variability  with  methods  that  do  not  depend  on  environmental  context  as  the 
emergence of mutations can be influenced by the selection conditions in a still poorly understood fashion  
In  addition  both  mutation  and  recombination  events  could  arise  from  the  same  set  of  circumstances  For 
example  a  mutagen  often  also  induces  DNA  lesions  that  obstruct  DNA  synthesis  and  cause  collapse  of  the 
replication fork which has to be repaired by homologous recombination 6 However to study both of these 
effects of mutagenic treatment with conventional genetic methods in a single experiment is complicated  
Recent  advances  in  high  throughput  genomic  analysis  open  up  new  opportunities  for  analysis  of  genome 
variability  7-10  In  particular  by  expanding  mutation  analysis  to  the  genome-wide  scale  modern  high-
throughput  sequencing  technology  permits  us  to  detect  correlations  between  individual  molecular  events  in  a 
single organism independent of enhancement schemes In our work we set out to explore how this analysis can 
help  in observing  at  the  single-cell  level the  contributions  and  interactions between  the  molecular  processes 
contributing to mutation generation and segregation  
Results 
Ethyl methanesulfonate EMS was chosen as an efficient mutagen with excellent preservation of viability 11 
The K-12 CC102 strain was chosen as a widely used model for mutagenesis studies for consistency of analysis 
12  Bacteria  were  mutagenized  according  to  a  standard  protocol  12  but  in  order  to  minimize  the  loss  of 
slightly deleterious mutations the cells were grown for only 2 hours in rich medium before plating on LB agar 
The next day several colonies were picked at random and grown in LB for two more hours to obtain amounts of 
DNA sufficient for high-throughput sequencing analysis  
Illumina GA sequencing uses four fluorescently-labeled modified nucleotides to sequence by synthesis the tens 
of  millions  of  clonal  clusters  generated  by  fragmentation  of  DNA  and  amplification  of  the  fragments  via 
ligation-mediated PCR see Materials and Methods 13 First we describe general features of the data obtained 
from  the  sequencing  of  six  clones  of  mutagenized  CC102  cells  Consistent  with  the  fact  that  the  cells  were 
proliferating at the moment of harvest we observed a gradient in the sequencing coverage Figure 1A for every 
DNA sample with the replication terminus Ter noticeably underrepresented compared to the replication origin 
OriC Another global genomic feature can also be inferred from this simple analysis of coverage the region 
including the proAB and lacZ loci shows strong variability in coverage between different sequenced colonies 
Figure 1A shows the coverage for one of the colonies reflecting its independent replication as a part of the 
F128 episome 14  
The single nucleotide differences between the parental CC102 strain and the K12 MG1655 reference strain are 
described below see Figure 1B for an example of mutation identification and the supplementary table ST1 left 
column for counts As expected the following mutations were found consistent with the genetic background of 
the CC102 strain stop codon in the araC gene lacZ GAG to GTG Glu to Gly in the 461 position of the lacZ 
gene and a promoter mutation in the lacI gene All possible nucleotide replacements are present reflecting the 
complicated laboratory histories of these strains after their divergence  
Sequence  comparisons  between  the  un-mutagenized  parental  CC102  strain  and  six  descendants  from  the 
individual  colonies  after  EMS  mutagenesis  revealed  a  picture  dramatically  dissimilar  to  the  MG1655  versus 
CC102 comparison table ST1 central and right columns On average 70 mutations per genome were observed 
The overwhelming majority of the changes are GC  AT transitions well in accord with the known mutagenic 
specificity of EMS 15-19 The genome-wide distribution of the newly acquired mutations induced by EMS in 
the  CC102  strain  is  strikingly  nonrandom  and  exhibits  several  prominent  features  present  in  all  six  DNA 
samples that were sequenced  
The first feature is the presence of long stretches of genome where either only G  A or only C  T transitions 
are observed Fig2A B S1 The asymmetric stretches span up to 2 Mb and often are switched to a stretch of 
the opposite kind on average 8-10 times per genome sequenced including very short switches within a stretch 
The positions of the asymmetric stretches and how they switch vary between the six DNA samples sequenced 
and do not manifest any regularity or correlation with a known genomic feature We refer to these features as 
asymmetric stretches and switches respectively  
The second feature is a number of positions having a mixture of a mutated and wild type sequences in different 
reads  an  example  of  such  a  position  is  shown  on  Figure  1B  bottom  and  the  genome-wide  distribution  on 
Figure  2B  and  S1  A  particularly  high  number  of  these  positions  was  observed  for  the  colony  H1  Two 
arguments  suggest  that  this  observation  is  not  an  artifact  of  the  sequencing  methodology  the  sequencing 
coverage is high and no such mixtures are detected when the MG1655 and the parental strain CC102 strain are 
compared We will call this feature mixed states  
The  third  feature  of  the  mutation  distribution  is  a  striking  difference  between  mutation  densities  in  different 
regions of the genome In fact we detected two separate aspects of the uneven distribution The regions of the 
genome positioned at two axes  the Ori-Ter axis and its orthogonal axis  consistently displayed lower mutation 
density with up to an order of magnitude difference in all colonies sequenced Figure 2C However we also 
detected  regions  examples  are  indicated  in  Figure  2B  that  showed  dramatic  and  statistically  significant 
individual variations from one sequenced colony to another Figure 2D We term this aspect of uneven mutation 
distribution mutation bunching 
How might these striking inter-genome and intra-genome irregularities in mutation distribution be explained 
Albeit  somewhat  surprising  and  strongly  deviating  from  the  unbiased  genome-scale  distribution  naively 
expected from a mutagenic process asymmetric stretches and switching can be accounted for by the following 
fixation and segregation model based on the semiconservative model of DNA replication and knowledge of 
how DNA lesions are converted into mutations or induce recombination events  
1 The asymmetric stretches of G  A or C  T transitions are straightforward to explain Figure 3A top 
shows the standard model of the EMS-induced O6 alkyl guanine specifically mispairing with thymine resulting 
in a G to A replacement upon the second round of replication 15-19 Considering now a continuous stretch of 
DNA and assuming that each strand in the original DNA is randomly affected by EMS one would expect that 
the segregation between daughter strands into different cells after replication will lead to each descendant cell 
having exclusively G  A or C  T conversions Figure 3A bottom Thus the elementary explanation of the 
observed  asymmetric  stretches  of  G    A  or  C    T  transitions  is  fixation  of  random  mutations  by  DNA 
polymerase due to erroneous recognition of O6 alkyl guanine and subsequent segregation of daughter strands 
between individual cells  
2 Given this simple explanation of the observed asymmetric stretches of G  A versus C  T transitions what 
is the cause of the observed switches between the alternative stretches As the most parsimonious mechanism 
we considered sister-strand exchange during replication It is well known that DNA lesions most notably EMS-
induced 3-methyl adenine 1-methyl adenine and 3-methyl cytosine 20 cause collapse of replication forks and 
their repair often involves sister-strand exchange 621 A hybrid DNA molecule resulting from this process will 
contain parts of both daughter strands separated by the site of recombination and thus will carry the molecular 
records of lesions that have occurred on both parental DNA strands The resulting switches between the G  A 
and  C    T  stretches  would  constitute  a  different  kind  of  mutation  segregation  event  that  we  observe  in  our 
system  
To test if homologous recombination is involved in this phenomenon we next used a recA mutant of E coli for 
EMS  mutagenesis  The  effect  of  EMS  on  viability  of  the  recA  mutant  was  significantly  more  pronounced 
compared to a wild type strain 10 survival versus 50-60 survival respectively as expected from the known 
contribution  of  homologous  recombination  to  the  repair  of  desintegrated  replication  forks  induced  by  DNA 
lesions Sequences of DNA extracted from three independent colonies confirm the hypothesis of recombination 
contributing to the phenomenon of switching Strikingly in one colony Figure 3B top the number of switches 
was  dramatically  reduced  from  an  average  of  8-10  to  2  whereas  in  two  other  colonies  no  switches  were 
observed and accordingly only one kind of transition G  A or C  T spanned the entire genome Figure 3B 
bottom left and right correspondingly  
The above data strongly argue for involvement of homologous recombination in the generation of the switches 
On the other hand explained in this simple way our observation of asymmetric stretches provides independent 
and  transparent  genetic  evidence  for  semiconservative  DNA  replication  complementary  to  the  classic 
biophysical evidence 22 
3  Mixed  states  are  most  economically  explained  by  the  presence  of  a  mutagenic  DNA  lesion  O6  alkyl 
guanine in the cell-founder of the colony Figure S2 That a lesion-containing strand could be expected among 
the  cells  at  the  moment  of  plating  is  consistent  with  the  fact  that  the  EMS-treated  cells  underwent  around  2 
divisions during this period Figure S3 hence the original mutagenized DNA strands could not be significantly 
diluted by the newly synthesized DNA in the cell population at this time Thus the observation of the mixed 
states was not surprising given our aim to limit the number of divisions to a minimum in order to avoid the loss 
of slightly deleterious mutations 
4 Concerning the unequal genome-wide distribution of mutations the presence of impressive mutation bunching 
in  recA  colonies  indicated  in  Figure  3B  and  for  the  statistical  significance  see  Figure  2D  suggests  that 
although recombination could partially account for this phenomenon in the recombination-positive CC102 strain 
it cannot be the only cause of bunching On the other hand this feature is also reminiscent of transcription bursts 
a  phenomenon  observed  over  the  last  decade  in  studies  of  individual  cells  23-27  The  rate  of  mutation 
generation is determined by competition between repair and replication Given that the molecular physics that 
underlies these processes is fundamentally the same as that of transcription these processes could be subject to 
similar stochastic fluctuations Therefore one may expect that the balance between the rate of DNA synthesis 
and  the  efficiency  of  repair  might  also  fluctuate  significantly  between  different  positions  of  genome  in  an 
individual cell thus providing an explanation for the observed mutation bunching Moreover the scale of this 
bunching can surpass the size of the E coli genome for example when the number andor size of bunches varies 
between  cells  This  should result  in  a non-normal  distribution of  mutation numbers between  cells  sequenced 
This  is  in  fact  what  we  observe  in  our  experiments  Figures  2BD  the  number  of  mutations  in  the  CC102-
derived colonies H1 41  and H2 34 is unusually far from the mean value 7125 with the p values of non-
normality  1e-4  and  1e-6  correspondingly  whereas  the  recA-derived  genome  R1  has  49  mutations  which 
deviates from the Poisson distribution with p value 1e-3  
To confirm the importance of the balance between repair and replication as the determining factor in mutation 
frequency we kept mutagenized CC102 in a non-replicating state PBS solution overnight before plating Three 
colonies  were  sequenced  and  showed  dramatic  deviation  from  the  pattern  previously  observed  One  colony 
showed  a  significant  decrease  2  orders  of  magnitude  in  the  number  of  mutations  Figure  4A  Two  other 
colonies had a strong preference for mutations near the replication terminus This is consistent with the notion 
that  the  balance  between  repair  and  replication  kinetics  contributes  to  the  genome-wide  differences  in  the 
mutation density Figure 4B Given that we were treating exponentially growing cultures most of the cells had 
the regions around the OriC already replicated When put into the nutrient-lacking medium after EMS treatment 
the cells can complete replication of the area close to the terminus thus giving a chance for the lesions in this 
area to be converted to mutations before repair In contrast the area around the OriC has less chance to replicate 
again and there the lesions are more likely to be repaired before replication and mutation fixation  
The  phenomenon  defying  an  easy  explanation  is  the  consistently  low  mutation  density  in  the  regions  of  the 
genome posed at the OriC-Ter axis and its orthogonal axis Figure 2C We do not favor the explanation of this 
feature by a negative selection of lethal mutations as the genome-wide profile of the differences between two 
wild strains of E coli MG1655 and O157 shows no preference for conserved positions in these regions Figure 
S4  The  explanation  for  the  consistent  deviation  from  a  random  distribution  in  these  areas  of  genome  most 
likely resides elsewhere eg in some transient aspects of the cellular response to EMS treatment First the DNA 
in these regions might be differentially protected from EMS eg due to DNA folding and intracellular location 
2829  Second  the  regions  could  differ  in  the  efficiency  of  repair  of  the  EMS-induced  lesions  Further 
research will be required to clarify this issue  
Discussion 
The main novelty of the present study is in initiating genome-wide analysis of induced mutagenesis at the level 
of  the  individual  cell  The  traditional  approaches  which  typically  rely  on  selection  screens  are  limited  to 
analysis  of  few  genetic  loci  and  often  the  results  obtained  with  two  different  systems  do  not  agree  1  The 
advantage of the modern high throughput technology is in allowing for the selection independent observation of 
mutations and recombination events and of their distribution throughout the genome by direct sequencing of 
several bacterial colonies and obtaining a mutation profile separately for individual genomes  
Non-randomness of mutation distribution is usually discussed in terms of mutational hot spots first observed by 
Benzer on the T4 rII locus 2 Later the mutation distributions were shown to have both hot-spot and random 
components 30 However the use of selection limited these studies to comparisons between positions within a 
model gene With our approach we were able to observe several new types of non-uniform distribution patterns 
now on a truly genomic scale strong correlation between the C to T or G to A transitions between adjacent 
positions  in  the  genome  as  well  as  strong  genome-scale  variations  in  mutation  density  either  consistent  for 
different genomes or else genome specific  
Whereas  most  of  the  observed  distribution  patterns  can  be  explained  by  the  known  features  of  enzymatic 
processes semiconservative DNA replication homologous recombination competition between replication and 
repair the source of others remains to be elucidated In this respect mutation bunching represents a particular 
interest Most of the bunching events in the wild type cells CC102 could be due to homologous recombination 
however  their  observation  in  the  recA  mutants  suggests  an  additional  mechanism  reflecting  the  stochastic 
nature of genome dynamics at the single-cell level As far as the repair efficiency is concerned the fluctuations 
in  the  amounts  of  repair  enzymes  in  individual  cells  eg  a  single  cell  of  Ecoli  could  contain  as  few  as  20 
molecules  of  the  methyltransferase  MGMT  which  removes  alkyl  groups  from  the  modified  guanine  3132 
have been proposed previously as a source of transiently hypermutable phenotypes 33 We can now extend this 
notion  to  account  for  the  mutation  bunching  ie  local  variations  in  the  numbers  of  repair  proteins  could  be 
responsible for position-dependent variations in mutation density inside individual genomes Consistently we 
also observe non-normal distribution of mutation numbers between individual genomes sequenced On the other 
hand  we  cannot  exclude  another  source  of  this  cell-cell  heterogeneity    the  physiological  state  of  E  coli 
growing  in  Luria-Bertani  broth  changes  at  an  OD600  of  03  34  which  could  contribute  to  the  differences 
between individual cells in their response to EMS treatment at this cell density  
Aside from DNA repair could the local variations in the rate of DNA synthesis also contribute to the mutation 
bunching A position-dependent fluctuation in DNA replication rate in vivo is practically impossible to observe 
on large cell populations On the other hand some crucial components of the replication machinery are present 
in limiting amounts in the bacterial cell  it has only 10-20 molecules of DNA-polymerase III and no more than 
4 copies of functional hexamers of DnaB helicase 35 crucial for replisome assembly and function Thus a 
possible role for fluctuating rates of DNA synthesis in mutation bunching cannot be discarded outright  
Several other phenomena should be mentioned In addition to the consistent genome-scale variations in mutation 
density  discussed  in  the  Results  section  Figure  2C  we  are  also  intrigued  by  1  the  peculiar  mutation 
enrichment around OriC in the recA cells Figure 3B 2 occurrence for every experimental group analyzed of 
an outsider colony ie L1 H1 and R1 having a distribution pattern different from the rest of the group  
Concerning the first feature the negative selection of mutation bunches in the context of exponentially growing 
cultures  might  be  responsible  for  the  observed  mutation  enrichment  around  the  OriC  in  the  recA  cells  The 
location of lethal DNA damage might correlate with the mutagenic damage In order for the cell to survive at 
least  one  chromosome  should  survive  the  treatment  Since  in exponentially  growing cultures  there  are  more 
DNA  copies  near  OriC  compared  to  the Ter  region Figure 1A  and  S5  for  a  recA  colony  cells  that  have  a 
bunch near OriC will have a higher survival rate than those that have a bunch near Ter thus increasing the 
chance to observe colonies with the OriC region enriched in mutations  
As  far  as  the  outsiders  are  concerned  establishing  their  noteworthiness  would  require  accumulation  of 
sequencing information that is beyond the scope of the present study Their existence might also indicate the 
need in future studies of using better controlled physiological conditions eg the cell cycle state could be an 
important factor For example the immediate ancestors of the L1 and H1 colonies might have been caught at the 
end  of  the  replication  cycle  during  the  EMS  treatment  leading  to  the  repair  process  outperforming  mutation 
fixation in the case of colony L1 and to preservation of a large portion of the damaged parental DNA strand in 
the  case  of  colony  H1  The  half-replicated  genome  could  be  a  factor  in  the  case  of  the  R1  colony  but 
additionally  recA-independent  illegitimate  recombination  might  be  involved  Overall  the  occurrence  of  the 
outsiders  illustrates  that  given  the  somewhat  unique  prehistory  of  every  individual  colony  the  study  of 
genome dynamics with our approach  in addition to the search for universal patterns and explanations  will 
also  require  an  element  of  historic  reconstruction  already  familiar  to  biologists  although  in  a  different   
evolutionary  setting  
Our  work  can  be  put  into  the  perspective  of  the  methodological  transition  that  modern  biology  is  currently 
undergoing  Increasingly  popular omics  approaches  aim  to  measure  all  relevant  characteristics  of  the object 
studied  But  concerning  an  individual  cell  how  far  can  the  omics  methodology  reach  Technological 
limitations  restrict  studies  of  individual  cells  to  measurement  of  only  a  few  of  their  properties  eg  by  flow 
cytometry and related methods In this respect DNA sequencing provides the largest amount of information 
about  an  individual  cell  46  Mb  in  the  E coli  genome  as  compared  to  any  of  its  other  observable 
characteristics Alas DNA sequence barely varies among the descendants of a single bacterial cell limiting the 
value of genome sequencing in the studies of dynamical processes in individual cells Induced mutagenesis is a 
way to perturb and thus introduce more dynamics into the otherwise static object thus allowing one to take full 
advantage of the high-throughput sequencing in studying processes other than transcription such as replication 
repair recombination and their complicated interactions at level of the individual cell Our results demonstrate 
the value of new genomic technologies in addressing various aspects of intracellular dynamics at the single cell 
level  a  topic  that  is  becoming  increasingly  important  in  the  light  of  recent  advances  in  the  studies  of  the 
stochastic  nature  of  intracellular  dynamics  and  cell  individuality  They  also  pave  the  way  for  independent 
verification of the traditional assumptions that underlie studies of genetic variability

Library preparation for Illumina sequencing  
10-500  ng  of  E coli  genomic  DNA  was  processed  according  to  the  recommended  Illumina  protocol  see 
Supporting Materials and Methods Two generations of Illumina technology were used in this work GA1 was 
used to sequence the clones H1 H3 H4 H5 R1 R2 R3 and L1 GA2 was used to sequence H1 H2 H3 H6 L2 
and L3 GA2 is more advanced technology in that is yields 3 times more coverage average 80 reads covering a

Mutations calling 
For  the  details  of  sequence  alignment  and  the  filtering  criteria  for  the  search  of  mismatches  see  Supporting 
Materials  and  Methods  Each  mutation  was  attributed  a  mixed  state  parameter  r    ratio  of  numbers  of 
fragments carrying the mismatch versus total number of fragments covering this position We found that to avoid 
significant contribution of false positive calls this parameters must be larger than 05 Notably false positive calls 
appear first in different from G  A and C  T mutation types as seen in H4 H5 L1 and R1 samples

Whole genome sequencing of individual colonies and mutation identification  
A   An example of genome-wide coverage The sequence fragments obtained from the sequencing of DNA 
of an individual colony were aligned to the reference genome of the MG1655 strain Abscissa position along 
MG1655 genomic sequence Ordinate number of fragments per every 23198 bp 1200 of the genome The 
positions of the replication origin OriC terminus region Ter and F 128 episome are indicated The F 128 
episome is a plasmid that contains the chromosomal proB-lacZ region and independent replication origin hence 
the discontinuity in the otherwise smooth gradient of genome coverage The coverage and correspondingly the 
amount of DNA at Ter was about twofold smaller than that at OriC for all genomes sequenced Thus there is 
one pair of replication forks per cell in average exponentially growing cell  
B   An example of identification of individual mutations Reads of 23-32 bases were aligned with the 
reference sequence parental CC102 strain Differences with respect to the reference sequence are indicated by

show a consistent difference throughout all reads top or through a significant part of the reads mixed

The pure or mixed state for every mutation is also indicated The mutations with the 100 single nucleotide 
state are placed at the solid circle The distance from the solid circle is proportional to the percent of wild type

increased mutation density that vary between different colonies are indicated by  
C   Genome-wide distribution of mutation density Shown are the mutation densities obtained by 
averaging of data for the 6 genomes of the mutagenized CC102 strain sequenced The genome was divided to 20 
bins of  232 Kb size coarse grained distribution outer curve or to 100 bins of 46 Kb size fine grained inner 
curve and the mutation numbers in percent of total are plotted along the genome Values closer to the center 
correspond to the regions of lowest mutation density  
Mutation bunching The term bunching and antibunching is generally used to describe stochastic 
behavior which deviates from a random Poisson distribution when successive events are not realized randomly 
but depend on neighboring events 3637 Such behavior is widely observed in diverse settings from photon 
counting experiments to statistics of neuron firings The departure from the normal distribution can be quantified 
by the variance to mean ratio VMR Fano factor Here the statistics of distances between successive mutations 
in experimental samples is compared with simulated random mutations The VMR distribution for 20 black 
and 80 gray random mutations in the E coli genome was obtained by simulating half a million randomized 
mutagenesis acts The distribution of  distances between random mutations is binomial thus its VMR is less than 
one The experimental VMR values for different samples are shown by arrows where H1-H6 corresponds to the 
mutagenized CC102 strain and R1-R3 to the mutagenized recA strain All our samples fell into the right tail of 
the distribution some of them displaying VMR values highly unlikely for random mutations P-value 1e-4 
Figure 3 Models and experimental verifications  
A   Asymmetric stretches  
Top Scheme of the O6 alkyl guanine O6-aG specifically mis-pairing with thymine T which should result in 
GC  AT replacement after a second round of replication  
Bottom Model of generation of asymmetric stretches For simplicity the original sequence is depicted as 
consisting of G and C only each G being alkylated by EMS treatment After the first replication round two 
daughter strands are generated both carrying T paired with O6-aG After the second replication round the DNA 
molecules with both newly synthesized strands carry exclusively either G  A left or C  T right 
replacements Repair for example via removal of alkyl groups by methyltransferase MGMT is also shown as 
conversion of G back into G

and C  T closed triangle mutations for three colonies of recA mutant subjected to EMS treatment and

indicated by  Mutations that are different from the GC  AT type are indicated by circle Most of these

Role of competition between replication and repair in generation of mutations 
PBS overnight after EMS treatment before plating Three sequenced genomes are shown with the mutation 
positions indicated as in Fig 3B  
B   Model of competition between replication and repair Most of the cells in exponential culture have the 
regions around the OriC replicated When put in the nutrient-lacking medium after EMS treatment the cells can 
complete replication of the area close to the terminus thus giving a chance for the O6-aG in this area to be 
converted to mutations before repair In contrast the area around the OriC has less chance to replicate again and 
there the O6-aG are more likely to be repaired before replication thus avoiding mutation fixation

Origin of mixed state  
We consider two simplified scenarios which a assume that every O6-aG leads to T pairing 
during replication and b do not take into account selection bias both in vivo or during 
sequencing manipulations Top If no replication occurred between EMS treatment and 
plating the founder cell of the colony will contain an O6-aGC pair Assuming certain level of 
repair more than 50 of the cells in the colony will contain the wild type sequence Bottom 
If only one replication round occurred between EMS treatment and plating the founder cell of 
the colony will contain an O6-aGT pair Assuming certain level of repair the colony will 
contain between 50 to 100 of mutant sequences  
Slow growth after EMS treatment 100 ul of cells were added to 2ml of LB medium and 
incubated at 370C Aliquots were taken out of the growing cultures at the times indicated on
