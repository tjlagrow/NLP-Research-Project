Abstract
The radial motion of massive particles in the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole is considered
Screening of the Hawking radiation and shielding of the Penrose process are examined both
inside and outside the ergosphere and their effect on the evaporation of the black hole is studied
In particular the locus and width of a classically forbidden region and their dependance on
the particles angular momentum and energy is analysed Tunneling of particles between the
boundaries of this region is considered and the transmission coefcient determined

1 Introduction
Dimopoulos and Landsberg 1 and Giddings and Thomas 2 suggested that as a con-
sequence of TeV-scale quantum gravity the production of microscopic black holes at the
LHC might be possible These black holes would decay rapidly into charged leptons and
photons with a clean signature and low background Microscopic black holes offer the
possibility of gaining insights into quantum gravity and contribute to efforts to reconcile
general relativity and quantum theory Once the energy threshold is crossed Planck mass
 1 TeV  the production of black holes is possible However at this scale unknown
quantum effects play an important role and the black holes become stringy and com-
plex In the present analysis quantum gravity effects are ignored in favour of classical
arguments Black holes decay in four distinct phases the balding phase the spin down
phase the Schwarzschild phase and the Planck phase In this work the spin-down phase
is only consideredthis is the phase in which case the Kerr black hole evolves into a
Schwarzschild black hole by losing mass through Hawking radiation 3 4 and angular
momentum through the Penrose process5 Radial motion is characterised by a distinct
region with negative kinetic energy for particles with certain angular momentum and en-
ergy Classically a particle cannot be in such a region thus the boundaries of this forbid-
den region are turning points This paper studies the effects of the negative kinetic energy
region on the spin-down phase of a Kerr black hole
Decay processes in macroscopic black holes were rst studied by Hawking and led
to the prediction of Hawking radiation Parikh and Wilczek 6 developed this idea as
a quantum tunneling process across a classically forbidden region at the horizon Pro-
danov 7 has recently examined the screening of such evaporation in the Schwarschild
and Reissner-Nordstrom cases
The reduction of the mass of a black hole is in part due to Hawking radiation Emit-
ted particles with certain ranges of energies and angular momenta may be reected back
into the black hole by a turning point outside the event horizon thus screening of the
evaporation takes place The screening however is offset by a competing process quan-
tum tunneling across the forbidden region This tunneling reduces the screening effect
on the evaporation The overall effect is the damping of a range of Hawking radiation
spectral modes For particles with lower angular momentum the screening effect is less
pronounced and tunneling is more likely Therefore the Hawking radiation spectrum is
dominated by low angular momentum modes and high energy modes
The Penrose process is responsible for the loss of angular momentum of a rotating
black hole Particles entering the ergosphere may be scattered and ejected with greater
energy This process is shielded by the negative kinetic energy region for particles with
certain ranges of their energies and angular momenta For particles with large angular
momentum and low energy this region extends beyond the static limit and swallows the
ergosphere The black hole is completely shielded from such particles and the Penrose
process is eliminated If the negative energy region does not extend to the static limit only
partial shielding takes place In both cases particles can tunnel across the forbidden region
in the ergosphere and may or may not contribute to energy extraction If particle splitting
occurs between the event horizon and the lower boundary of the forbidden regionwhich
is never between the horizons energy extraction can only take place if the particle tunnels
back across the potential barrier For higher angular momentum modes the potential barrier
moves ever closer to the event horizon making this effect more and more unlikely
Since Penrose proposed his process for energy extraction from a Kerr black hole many
authors have suggested alternative mechanisms The efciency of the original process was
estimated by Wald to be in the region of 120 8 Banados Silk and West BSW9
have demonstrated that colliding particles near the event horizon of an extremal black hole
can result in higher energy extraction efciency due to the high centre-of-mass energy of
the collision However several authors subsequently have shown that the efciency of this
process is limited to 130  More recently a new limit of energy extraction efciency
has been demonstrated by Schnittman For Compton scattering between a photon and a
massive particle the efciency can reach 1400 10 High centre-of-mass collisions can
produce very energetic particles making Kerr black holes act as natural particles accelera-
The current work concerns trajectories of particles inside and outside the ergosphere of
a rotating black hole This involves a detailed study of radial motion of particles in the Kerr
metric in particular the effect of the angular momentum and energy of the particles on
the shielding process is studied Tunneling of such particles between the boundaries of the
classically forbidden region is examined and an analytical expression for the transmission
coefcient across the barrier is determined

The Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates is given by 11

where 2  r2a2 cos2    r22M ra2 with a  the specic angular momentum
of the black hole and M  the mass of the black hole
The Lagrangian for a particle of mass m and charge q in the presence of a gravitational
and electromagnetic eld A is given by 11
where  is the proper time  per unit mass m    m and A  the electromagnetic
potential given by

In Boyer-Lindquist coordinates the Lagranian becomes

The motion of the particle is completely determined by the geodesic equation 11
d 2  i
where F  dA is Maxwells electromagnetic tensor and i
This results in four equations of motion for the test particle 12

where K is a conserved quantity called Carters constant given by

In the above equation E  1mL t is the conserved energy of the particle J 
1mL  is the conserved projection of the particles angular momentum on the axis
of rotation and p  1mL  is the -component of the particles four-momentum
For the present analysis only radial motion in the equatorial plane is considered

To determine the boundaries of the classically forbidden region which is characterised by
negative kinetic energy one needs to locate the roots of the equation Rr  r4 r2  0 It
is instructive to consider this equation from different perspectives Firstly consider Carters
equation 6 in the equatorial plane
Rr  er2  a2  ja2  r2  j  ae2
In the Kerr black hole the time-like Killing vector t becomes null at the static limit
with boundary given by
gtt  1  2M r
cid112
rs  M 
M 2  a2cos2
The region between the event horizon r and the static limit rs is called the ergosphere
In this region all particles must rotate with the black hole due to frame dragging In this
region negative energy states are possible aswell because at the static limit t becomes
space-like and can be positive or negative Hence the conserved energy E  1mL t
can be positive or negative
r and the event horizon r are r  M  
In the equatorial plane the static limit rs is 2M The location of the Cauchy horizon
M 2  a2 respectively From 12 it is
evident that there can be no region of negative energy between the horizons the term
  r2  2M r  a2 is always negative between the horizons and hence Rr is strictly
positive A forbidden region therefore cannot exist between the horizons  forbidden
regions if they exist lie to the right of r or to the left of r
If   1 the particle cannot escape and the trajectory is bound If   1 the particle is
marginally bound ie falling towards the hole from a state of rest at innity and if   1
the particle is unbound In this work unbound particles   1 are considered only Such
particles with certain values of j and  undergo scattering by the negative kinetic energy
region outside of the black hole or tunnel across it
Consider Rr as a cubic in r ie
Rr  Ar3  M r2

where A  2  12  0
Firstly if a2A  j22 the coefcient of the r term in equation 15 is positive All
other terms in the equation are positive as well     and so there are no sign
changes By Descartes rule of signs there can only be two situations either one negative
root and two complex roots or three negative roots Vietas relations result in r1  r2 
r3  MA r1r2  r2r3  r1r3 cid0a2A  j22cid1A r1r2r3  Mcid0j  acid12
this scenario the centre is a boundary of a forbidden region if j  a
Secondly when a2A  j22 the coefcient of the linear term in equation 15 is
negative with all others positive and one of the terms in the equation being negative
   leads to two sign changes There can be three situations one negative
root and two positive roots one negative root and two complex roots or three negative
roots The last situation cannot arise due to Vietas restriction r1r2  r2r3  r1r3 
cid0a2A  j22cid1A  for three negative roots the left hand side is positive while the right
hand side is negative
Consider next the kinetic energy equation 12 as a quadratic in  and j separately both
above the static limit r  2M  and then below it r  r  2M  Any r except r 
r  r can lie in a forbidden region depending on the energy and angular momentum of
the particle
Firstly for r  2M as a quadratic in j the kinetic energy equation
Rj cid02M  rcid1j2  4M aj  r  2r3  a2r  2a2M 
cid02r3  r  a22r  2M cid12M  r
leads to a negative kinetic energy region for values of j between the roots

The location of these roots is determined by considering the sign changes in 16 The
quadratic term is always negative the linear term can be positive or negative depending
on the sign of aj   0 always and the constant term can also be positive or negative
depending on r If aj is positive co-rotating probe and centre then the signs are 
or   and there is either one positive and one negative root or two complex roots If
aj is negative counter-rotating probe and centre then all possibilities may arise
Furthermore for real roots to exist the kinetic energy of the particle must be above the
threshold energy

r  2M
  T 
Only then the discriminant of 16 is positiveFig 1a For particles with energy greater
than T and angular momentum in the range j j there is no forbidden region For
particles with   T and angular momentum outside the interval j j or with   T
and any j only circular motion is possible since the forbidden region extends for all
r  2M
Next consider the kinetic energy equation 12 as a quadratic in  for r  2M
R  r3  a2r  2a2M 2  4ajM   r  r  2M j2
A negative kinetic energy region exists for energies between the roots

cid0  r  j2cid0r  2Mcid1cid1cid2r3  a2r  2M cid3
r3  a2r  2M 
cid21
In this equation the quadratic term is always positive as is the constant term r  2M
The linear term is positive or negative depending on the sign of aj The signs of the terms
are therefore either   or  so there is only one sign change in each case As
the discriminant is positive for all values of j the only possible roots are one positive and
one negative Fig 2a
Particles with kinetic energy in the range 0  1 and any angular momentum experi-
ence a negative kinetic energy region R  0 and their radial motion is restricted For
   and any j then R  0 and there is no forbidden region
Secondly below the static limit r  2M  consider the sign changes of the kinetic
energy equation 16 In this case the quadratic term is always positive while the signs of
the other terms can be positive or negative For aj  0 the possible signs of the terms are
  and  There are three possibilities two positive roots one positive root
and one negative root or two negative roots When aj  0 the possible signs of the terms
are    and   In this case there is either one positive root and one negative
root or two negative roots The expression for the roots is the same as the case where
r  2M 17 The discriminant is positive for all  in this case So in the ergosphere for
any  and for angular momentum outside the range j j Rj  0 and a forbidden
region does not existsFig 1b
Now consider again the kinetic equation as a quadratic in  19 The signs of the
coefcients of the quadratic and linear terms are the same as in the previous case r 
2M  However the constant term can now be positive or negative depending on r For
positive values of aj the signs are   and  For negative values of aj the
signs are    and   The possibilities are two positive roots or one positive and
one negative root j  0 or one positive and one negative or two negative root no complex
roots are possible in this case since the discriminant is positive aj  0 Therefore in
the ergosphere a negative kinetic region R  0 exists for particles with energies in the
range   and any angular momentumFig 2b
Particles with kinetic energy and angular momentum within the ranges outlined above
experience a negative kinetic energy region and their radial motion is restricted Outside
these ranges of energies angular momentum Hawking radiation particles will escape to
innity and incoming particles will fall into the black holeFig 3

To summarise for values of j and  a forbidden region exists to the right of the event
horizon r For a forbidden region to exist above the event horizon r and within the
ergosphere below the static limit 2M the particles kinetic energy should be in the range
  for any angular momentum or its angular momentum should be in the range
j j for any energy For a particular value of energy and angular momentum a double
root appears just above r As j increases further two real roots r2 and r3 appear forming
the boundaries of the forbidden region
The rst of these above the event horizon r occurs for particular values of j and 
at r2  r   From equation 12 the condition under which the root approaches the
event horizon   0 can be determined by requiring
er2  a2  ja  0
or j  2M ra as a root approaches the horizon from above and j  2M ra as a
root approaches the Cauchy horizon from below   0
The other boundary of the forbidden region is given by the root r3 As the angular
momentum of the particle increases or as the energy decreases this boundary extends
above the static limit r  2M Here a forbidden region exists for a particle with angular
momentum in the interval  j  j and for kinetic energies above a threshold
energy T  For particles with energy less that T and any angular momentum no radial
motion is possible since any r   could be in a forbidden region for certain values of

The root r3 can be determined in terms of r2 by eliminating r1 using Vietas relations

Two forbidden regions may exist depending on the values of j and  The region
outside the event horizon screens the Hawking radiation and shields the Penrose process
Classically this is a barrier to particles escaping the black hole or entering the ergosphere
and contributing to the decay of the black hole However particles may tunnel across
quantum mechanically and offset these effect
3 Hawking radiation Screening reduction
Particle pairs are produced due to vacuum uctuations inside the event horizon at r 
2M   where  is small One of them the ingoing particle moves towards the centre of
the black hole The other the outgoing particle tunnels across the horizon and materialises
outside at r  2M    6

Depending on the spin and the mass of the black hole the angular momentum and energy
of the emitted particles screening of such particles may take place

Figure 4
b Energy v r a  095
Here the effect of the angular momentum on Hawking screening is demonstrated Hawk-
ing particles with energy E 055 and j  04 are screened while lower angular modes at
this energy will escape the event horizon Fig 4a For higher spin a  095 the energy
of the Hawking particles is E  002 and screening of all but j  0 angular momentum
modes takes place Fig4b
A negative kinetic energy region exists outside the horizon for particles with energies in
the range   20 and angular momenta in the range j j 17 Emitted particles
with such energies and angular momenta are reected back into the black hole at the lower
boundary r2 of the forbidden region and screening takes place This is evident for black
holes with spin a  05 Particles with energy E  0055 and angular momentum less
than j  04 will escape the event horizon while particles with greater angular momentum
will be reected back into the horizon Fig 4 5 The energy for various angular momenta
are given in the table Table 1
Some particles however may tunnel across this potential barrier and escape the black
hole This reduction in screening depends on the width w  r3  r2 of the forbidden
region As the angular momentum grows or as the energy decreases this region widens
The effect alters the spectrum of the Hawking radiation and dampens higher angular mo-
mentum spectral modes and low energy modes Hawking radiation is therefore dominated
by low angular momentum modes

The screening of Hawking particles with energy E  0055 from a Kerr black hole  spin
a  05 takes place in the green region between the two surfaces Fig5a The effect is
greatly enhanced for higher spin value a  095 and lower energy E  002 Fig 5b
Penrose process Shielding
According to Penrose 5 it is possible to extract from a rotating black hole Consider a
particle falling from innity into a Kerr black hole and splitting into two fragments The
Penrose process occurs when a particle with negative energy is absorbed by the black hole
As a result the holes mass and angular momentum decrease If the process continues
eventually the Kerr black hole would turn into a Schwarzschild black hole The process
depends on negative energy geodesics in the ergosphere Consider a particle P0 with
energy E0 entering the ergosphere and splitting into two with the rst particle P1 having
energy E1 and the second particle P2 having energy E2 The two particles will y off in
opposite directions P1 going in the direction of rotation of the black hole and P2 going in
the opposing direction P1 goes into a negative energy orbit and falls into the black hole
and P2 emerges form the ergosphere with increased energy E2
Effectively P2 gains energy from the ergosphere E2  E0  a transfer of energy
from the hole to P2 Chandrasekhar determined the efciency of the process the ratio
of the maximum energy out to the energy in to be 207 15 Increased energy extrac-
tion efciency has been demonstrated in recent years by considering modications to the
process Banados Silk and West BSW9 considered colliding particles near the event
horizon of an extremal black hole resulting in higher energy extraction efciency due to
the high centre-of-mass energy of the collision They proposed that Kerr black holes can
act as natural particle accelerators More recently Schnittman 10 has demonstrated a
new limit of energy extraction efciency for Compton scattering between a photon and a
massive particle In this mechanism the efciency can reach 1400
The effectiveness of the Penrose process is reduced for particles with energies  
  T  20 and angular momenta within the range j j 17 for r  2M For
particles with energies   T  and angular momenta outside the range j j the entire
ergosphere is in the forbidden region r  2M and there is no Penrose process Three
scenarios are relevant
Firstly for particles with energies     T  20 and for angular momenta

event horizon at 1866 and E  0055 Hawking energy All but the very lowest angular
momentum modes are screened
within the range j j 17 the boundary of the forbidden region is below the static
limit r3  rs and partial shielding occurs Particles may enter the ergosphere and energy
extraction or particle acceleration can take place As the angular momentum increases or
the energy decreases the boundary r3 approaches the static limit rs and the area available
for energy extraction decreases
Secondly however tunneling can take place across the potential barrier and the nar-
rower the forbidden region the more likely the tunnelling Some of the particles tunneling
across continue on through the event horizon r and will not take part in the process
Other particles however may still undergo the Penrose process between the event horizon
r and the forbidden region r2  r  r3 The negative energy particle falls into the event
horizon and slows down the black hole The particle gaining energy from the ergosphere
may tunnel back across the potential barrier exit the black hole and contribute to the spin-
down process The exiting particle may not tunnel across the potential barrier but may be
reected back at the boundary r2 into the event horizon and thus spin the hole up
Finally for particles with   T  or for particles with j outside j j when T 
the negative kinetic energy region extends beyond the static limit r3  rs and the black
hole is completely shielded
It becomes invisible to these particles and the Penrose
process cannot take place However particles can still tunnel across the potential barrier
and enter the region above the event horizon and below the forbidden region r  r  r2
In a repeat of the above scenario a greatly reduced Penrose process takes place
The shielding effect of a maximal rotating kerr black hole on a freely falling particle
at the staic limit is demonstrated in gure 6a The shielding effect beyond the static limit
is illustrated in terms of the impact parameter Fig6b and in terms of negative kinetic
energy regions for various values of angular momentum and energy Table 2

In Fig 6a particles with energies and angular momenta in the the yellow region are

limit particles in the yellow region will be shielded from the black hole for values of j
outside the intervalj j

where w is the width of the potential barrier
The Gamow factor e2 is directly related to the width w of the potential barrier and
also the angular momentum and energy of the tunnelling particle  increases with the
square of the barrier width In the limit w   the tunnelling probability which is
proportional to e2 diminishes exponentially As the width of the potential barrier de-
creases w  0   0 and the likelihood of tunnelling is increased
6 Conclusions
Restrictions to the Hawking and Penrose decay processes in the Kerr black hole occur
due to screening of particles with a range of energies and a range angular momenta The
effect takes place at the boundaries of a negative kinetic energy region which may exist
outside the event horizon and affects both the Hawking radiation and the Penrose process
The locations of these boundaries are determined and found to depend on the angular
momentum and energy of the particles Tunneling across this region or potential barrier
may take place however resulting in reducing these effects
The screening of Hawking radiation particles results in the attenuation of parts of
the energy spectrum and of the angular momentum spectrum In a competing process
tunnelling offsets the screening and allows a fraction of these particles to be transmitted
through the potential barrier This tunneling is reduced when the angular momentum of the
particles increases or the energy decreases and the width of the forbidden region widens
As a result the Hawking radiation signature is predominantly made up of low angular
momentum modes or high energy modes
The Penrose process is reduced for particles with low energies and high angular mo-
menta due to the shielding effect of the forbidden region and hence the reduction of energy
extraction As the angular momentum of the particles increases or their energy decreases
the black hole becomes completely shielded Some particles can still tunnel across the
barrier offsetting the shielding process
It is intended also to extend the study to the Kerr-Newman and Kerr-de Sitter cases
Future work will involve a more quantitative approach to these decay processes with a
comparative study of black holes from the microscopic to the astronomical
