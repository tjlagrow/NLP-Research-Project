Abstract
During the HIV infection several quasispecies of the virus arise which are able to
use dierent coreceptors in particular the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors R5 and
X4 phenotypes respectively The switch in coreceptor usage has been correlated
with a faster progression of the disease to the AIDS phase As several pharmaceu-
tical companies are starting large phase III trials for R5 and X4 drugs models are
needed to predict the co-evolutionary and competitive dynamics of virus strains
We present a model of HIV early infection which describes the dynamics of R5 qua-
sispecies and a model of HIV late infection which describes the R5 to X4 switch
We report the following ndings after superinfection or coinfection quasispecies
dynamics has time scales of several months and becomes even slower at low number
of CD4 T cells The curve of CD4 T cells decreases during AIDS late stage and
can be described taking into account the X4 related Tumor Necrosis Factor dynam-
ics Phylogenetic inference of chemokine receptors suggests that viral mutational
pathway may generate R5 variants able to interact with chemokine receptors dier-
ent from CXCR4 This may explain the massive signaling disruptions in the immune
system observed during AIDS late stages and may have relevance for vaccination
and therapy

1 Introduction
Human immunodeciency virus type 1 HIV-1 infection is characterized by the pro-
gressive loss of CD4 T cells Infection by most strains of HIV-1 requires interaction
with CD4 and a chemokine receptor either CXCR4 or CCR5 During early stages of
HIV-1 infection viral isolates most often use CCR5 to enter cells and are known as
R5 HIV-1 Later in the course of HIV-1 infection viruses that use CXCR4 in addi-
tion to CCR5 R5X4 or CXCR4 alone X4 variants emerge in about 50 patients
switch virus patients 3022 These strains are syncytium-inducing and are capa-
ble of infecting not only memory T lymphocytes but also nave CD4 T cells and
thymocytes through the CXCR4 coreceptor The switch to use of CXCR4 has been
linked to an increased virulence and with progression to AIDS probably through
the formation of cell syncytia and killing of T cell precursors X4 HIV strains are
rarely if ever transmitted even when the donor predominantly carries X4 virus
CXCR4 is expressed on a majority of CD4 T cells and thymocytes whereas only
about 5 to 25 of mature T cells and 1 to 5 of thymocytes express detectable
levels of CCR5 on the cell surface 23 It is noteworthy that X4 HIV strains stimu-
late the production of cellular factor called Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF which is
associated with immune hyperstimulation a state often implicated in T-cell deple-
tion 25 TNF seems able to both inhibit the replication of R5 HIV strains while
having no eect on X4 HIV and to down regulate the number of CCR5 co-receptors
that appear on the surface of T-cells 41
A powerful concept in understanding HIV variability and its consequences is that
of quasispecies 17 Quasispecies are the combined result of mutations and recom-
bination that originate variability and of co-infection simultaneous infection su-
perinfection delayed secondary infection and selection that keep variability low
HIV-1-infected individuals show heterogeneous viral populations of related genomes
best described as viral quasispecies 7 Infact the infection capacity of mutants may
vary and also their speed of replication 39 Moreover since the number of targets
the substrate is limited tter clones tend to eliminate less t mutants which are
subsequently regenerated by the mutation mechanism 16 While mutations are an
essential ingredient for exploring the genetic space in the search for the tness max-
imum they also lowers the average tness of the strain that generally is formed by
a cloud of mutants around the tness maximum the quasispecies Its worth noting
that for a given tness landscape there is a maximum tolerable mutation rate above
which the quasispecies structure is lost error threshold 17
The use of mathematical models is an insightful and essential complement to in vivo
and in vitro experimental design and interpretation Indeed mathematical models of
HIV dynamics have proven valuable in understanding the mechanisms of many of
the observed features of the progression of the HIV infection 271091555425451
With the incorporation of accurate stoichiometries gene expression levels and de-
tailed kinetic information from bioinformatics of sequence analysis and molecular
dynamics mathematical models will be even more eective in predicting time and
space patterns and the eects of drug therapy
Here we address the issue of studying the coevolutive and competitive dynamics of
dierent strains of HIV-1 virus also leading to the R5 to X4 phenotype switching
In doing this in the next section we introduce two models a quasispecies model for
R5 phase in which several R5 strains appear by mutations co-infection and super-
infection In the limit of 1 quasispecies we are able to nd the same values observed
experimentally and in other models most notably Perelsons standard model We
test the model in the scenarios of co-infection and superinfection using parameters
derived from biological literature The second model focuses on the R5 to X4 shift
and the hyperstimulation of T cell precursors through TNF We are able to describe
the decreasing dynamics of CD4 after the appearance of X4 strains and make
predictions on the HAART results in coinfection and superinfection scenarios at dif-
ferent times of the disease progression We make use of phylogenetic models of the
amino acid sequences of the human and mice chemokine receptor families to inves-
tigate the mutational pathway underlying the switching from dierent chemokine
receptors Finally we nd that the switch from R5 to X4 may allow the HIV to bind
to other chemokine receptors
2 Models
21 A model of the early R5 phase
In someone who is newly infected by HIV several variants of the virus called R5
are often the only kind of virus that can be found A meaningful way to model
strain mutations coinfection and superinfection is to extend Perelsons standard
model 42 to multiple strains and incorporate immune response to R5 quasi species
amplication in the following termed QSR5 model The R5 quasispecies dynamics
can be described by the following set of equations
ik IkTi 1 
Ti   i Xk
Ik   Xk
Vk  Ik  c Xi
kkkVk Xi
Ti  I Xi
ki Ti Vk
Ti  T Xk
ki Ti Ik
kVk Ti
The following cell types are considered T-helper CD4 cells carrying the CCR5
co-receptor responding to virus strain i Ti T cells infected by virus strain k Ik
k strains of R5 virus Vk We have thus assumed that viral strain k are identied
by just one epitope which is then displayed on the surface of the T cell of class k
and that a T cell of class i can be activated at least by one CD4 T cell carrying
the epitope k which is specic of the viral strain k The indices i k range from 1
to Ni Nk and in the following we have used Ni  Nk  N
In Equation 1 T cells are generated through two mechanisms the bone-marrow
source and selection in the thymus and the duplication of T cell strains activated
upon the recognition with an antigen carrying cell that may be even an infected
one We modeled T cells activation as a logistic term mimicking the global carrying
capacity of immune system 5
The death-rate term is composed by a natural death rate proportional to the popula-
tion and by the infection rate of T cells due to any viral strain The term Pk kVkTi
and the sum over Ti in the I cell birth rate reproduce the infection probability that
is the same irrespective of the T class As a cell become infected it does no more
contribute to the immune response
Equation 2 describes the infection dynamics The two death rate parameters ac-
count for the decrease of the infected cells due to cellular death and after the action
of T-killer cells CD8 Even if there are clear experimental evidences that CD4
cells decrease during the late HIV infection stages and in the AIDS state as far
as the asymptomatic phase of the infection is concerned the parameter I may be
assumed as a constant medical literature referred value
The kk term is responsible of the mutation process aecting the phenotype essen-
tial for the formation of new quasispecies The choice of a mutation rate of the order
of 105 is based on considering only those non-synonymous mutations that alter the
phenotype protein structure 5
In Equation 3 the virus replicative dynamics is described The birth rate term is
proportional to the virus budding numerosity while the viral death rate parameters
depend on the rate of natural death and accounts for the recognition of virus by B
Its worth noting that B-cells and T-killer cells are only implicitly included in the
model in order to reduce the dimensionality without loosing too many details We
assume that these responses are fast enough to be at equilibrium and they are just
proportional to the abundance of cognate T helper cells
The three  parameters T  I and V  are matrices describing the interactions
between cells andor cells and viruses ie who will interact with whom in terms of
geometry and strength of the interaction It is thus possible to consider which strains
of the virus are recognized and with which accuracy and the same for the action
of T-killer cells and B-cells It is also worth noting that T 
is the most important
determinant of the viral tness 5
Fig 1 Schematic description of the model for the switching from R5 to X4 viral phenotype
Naive T-cells U  are generated at constant rate NU and removed at rate U  They give
birth to dierentiated uninfected T-cells T  These in turn are removed at constant rate
T and become infected as they interact with the virus Infected T-cells I die at rate
I and contribute to the budding of viral particles V  that are cleared out at rate c As
soon as the X4 phenotype arise the production of the TNF starts proportional to the X4
concentration and contribute to the clearance of naive T-cells via the U
F parameter
22 Modeling the transition R5 to X4
In about half of the people who develop advanced HIV disease the virus begins
to use another co-receptor called CXCR4 X4 viral phenotype The shift to using
CXCR4 is considered a bad sign because it is often accompanied by a dramatic
increase in the rate of T-cell depletion The inability of the thymus to eciently
compensate for even a relatively small loss of nave T cells may be a key factor for
CD4 T cells depletion and AIDS progression We hypothesize that it may not be
exhaustion of homeostatic responses but rather thymic homeostatic inability along
with gradual wasting of T cell supplies through hyperactivation of the immune
system that lead to CD4 depletion in HIV-1 infection We here introduce a modied
version of the previous model that considers only CD4 dynamics Neither B nor
CD8 T cells are explicitly modeled and the space that now is considered is that of
dierent phenotypes of the virus we term this model R5toX4 model Under those

In the equations above the variables modeled are the pool of immature CD4 T
cells U the dierent strains of uninfected and infected T cells T and I respec-
tively HIV virus V  and the concentration of TNF F  A schematic view of the
model is depicted in Fig1 The value of the parameters introduced with respect to
the R5 model are summarized in Table 22
In particular Equation 4 describes the constant production of immature T cells
by the thymus NU and their turning into mature T cells at rate U  If X4 viruses
are present upon the interaction with TNF immature T-cells are cleared at xed
rate U
Equation 5 describes how uninfected mature T cells of strain i are produced at
xed rate U by the pool of immature T cells Those cells upon the interaction with
any strain of the virus Vk become infected at rate k   k The infectiousness
parameter  is not constant over time but depends on the interplay between R5
and X4 viruses In particular due to the presence of TNF the infectivity of R5
strains is reduced R5t    kR5F t while the one of X4 viruses increases
with constant of proportionality kX4 X4t    kX4 F t mimicking the cell
syncytium eect induced by the TNF molecule
Equation 6 describes the infection of mature T-cells Infected T-cells of strain k
arise upon the interaction of a virus of strain k with any of the mature T-cell strains
The infected cells in turn are cleared out at a rate I When TNF is released this
value increases linearly with constant I
X4 It  I  I
X4 F t
Equation 7 is close to that in the R5 quasispecies model a part from dierent viral
phenotypes being here considered
Finally in Equation 8 we model the dynamics of accumulation of TNF by assum-
ing the increase in TNF level to be proportional via the constant kF  to the total
concentration of X4 viruses present
23 Investigating the mutational pathway from R5 to X4
In our model we represent the dierent phenotypes by using a linear strain space see
for instance 2034 for similar assumptions The strain space is ordered in terms of
phenotype similarity This assumption is justied if the phenotypes are determined
by few viral protein functional determinants which are both independent and dier
only few DNA bases ie few mutations can change one determinant into another
Although we are aware of the several recent works on HIV mutational dynamics
and phylogenetic assessments we thought that a meaningful way to estimate the
mutational pathways between R5 and X4 seen is to use phylogenetic inference on
chemokine receptor families The assessment of phylogenies using likelihood frame-
work depends on the choice of an evolutionary model 53 We computed the maxi-
mum likelihood ML analysis of the CRs data set under dierent models of evolu-
tion 12 JTT 29 WAG 52 We used these models considering the incorporation
of the amino acid frequencies of the chemokine data sets F  and the heterogene-
ity of the rates of evolution implemented using a gamma distribution  5657
3 Results
We have rst extended Perelsons standard model 42 to incorporate dierent anti-
gen recognition abilities by the immune system and coexistence dynamics of dierent
R5 strains of HIV virus Our approach is a mean eld one ie we investigate the
average quantities of these molecular species 433224119 Then we have modied
the model to describe features of the latent phase of the infection ie the R5 to X4
switch and the hyperstimulation of the T cell precursors through the TNF

31 Amplication of R5 strains mutation co-infection and super-infection
Recent works have shown that HIV quasispecies may compete 11 and cooperate 59
and that persistence of the initial or ancestor quasispecies is a good indicator for dis-
ease progression 4 Burch and Chao 8 have stressed that the evolution of an RNA
virus is determined by its mutational neighborhood As the phenotype divergence
among viral strains arises from dierences in selection pressure these dierences
may lead for instance to a higher infection rate Since the competition is through
the immune system response and given that the phase space of antigen recognition
is not homogeneously covered 14 the HIV high mutation rate allows the quasis-
pecies to nd regions with weak immune response This competition may lead to
speciation of viral strains
If we consider the model of the early phase of the infection the evolution of T cells
abundances in a scenario of quasispecies is shown in Fig 2a As the asymptotic
state of our model is a xed point the asymptotic distribution is insensitive of the
initial conditions and the strains corresponding to higher tness are more abundant
see inset of Fig 2b However one should consider that this asymptotic state may
be reached after such a long time that it may be outside any practical scenario of
the progression of a disease The role of mutations in the transitory regime is quite
particular First of all starting from the rst inoculum at time t  0 on the zeroth
phenotype mutations are necessary to populate the other strains of the virus see
also Fig 2 Moreover in the presence of coupling among strains due to competition
or to a global constraints the K parameter the specic form of mutations does
not play a fundamental role see also Ref 3
Figs 3a and 3b report the results of short time and long term viral coevolution after
superinfection respectively We considered the rst viral inoculum to happen at time
t  0 with the superinfection event occurring at time t  20 when the immune
response to the rst inoculum has completed and the virus has established a chronic

considered thus 0 a A slow mounting of the second viral infection 2 having time
scale of several months is observed In b a compromised immune system is considered
The time for the second strain to reach the same abundance of the rst-infecting strain
3 is greater than in a
infection After the second inoculum the model exhibits a short transient followed by
a slow mounting of the second infection Due to the resulting low dynamics the time
needed by the second quasispecies to reach the same level of the other amounts to
several months Fig 3a and represents another example of a slow relaxation toward
a xed-point equilibrium We may also take into consideration the progression of
the disease characterized by a compromised immune system assuming as a rst
approximation a lower number of T cells ie a lower value of  with respect to
the previous scenario In this case the strain corresponding to the second inoculum
requires much longer time to reach the same abundances of the rst strain Fig 3b
If we consider HAART therapy is interesting to address the question of what hap-
pens if a patient suddenly stops the drugs treatment During HAART virus load in
blood declines but the virus is not denitively eradicated At the same time T cells
recover and their concentration arise towards the stationary state corresponding to
the low-level concentration of the virus As the treatment is interrupted virus level
begins to increase again Something similar to a second delayed infection occurs
Its worth noting that if more than one viral strain is present as in the case of
a coinfected or superinfected patient the second infection may lead to a dierent
asymptotic dominant strain Infact the growth velocities of the dierent phenotypes
of the virus depend both on the concentration of uninfected T cells and on the tness
of the dierent strains Thus a more aggressive strain or one with a weaker recog-
nition by the immune system may take advantage of the interruption of the drugs
treatment and of the renewed infection leading to an acceleration of the disease

Finally we have studied how the co-evolutionary and competitive dynamics of viral
strains mediated by the immune response may lead to the formation of new viral
quasispecies In Fig 4 we consider a phenotypic space of 25 strains and the rst in-
oculum is at phenotype 15 Fig 4a followed by a delayed inoculum at phenotype 5
at time t  1 We account for the dierences in recognition ability of viral anti-
gens by T cells by using a non-uniform interaction strength which favor the central
phenotypes The immune system does not discriminate among similar phenotypes
thus inducing a competition among neighboring strains The result of this induced
competition is the separation of the original quasispecies into two clusters quasi-
speciation Fig 4b However the immune system response continues to change in
time Figs 4c-d resulting into a complex coevolution with viral populations
32 R5 to X4 switch
We studied the coevolutive dynamics leading to X4 strain appearance by successive
mutations of the ancestor R5 strain The stimulated production of TNF regulate
the interactions between immune response and the virus and between the dierent
strains of HIV virus The results of these interactions are a decline in T-cells level
leading to the AIDS phase of the disease and the decline in levels of viruses using
the R5 coreceptor In Fig 5 the temporal evolution of the infection is shown with
the appearance of the X4 strain and the successive decline in T-cells abundances
         
Time days

strains depends on the mutation rate and on the phenotypic distance between R5 and X4
viruses After the appearance of the X4 phenotype a continuous slow decline in CD4
T-cells level leads to AIDS phase CD4 counts below 200cellsml We set   0001 and

The time at which the phenotypic switch occurs depends both on the mutation rate
 and on the phenotypic distance between R5 and X4 strains dP  Once experimental
data are known its possible to tune the model parameters to their corresponding
biological values Moreover to get a better insight on the range of variability of the
time of appearance of X4 phenotype a sensitivity analysis for varying values of the
 and dP parameters is still possible
In Fig 6 we considered HAART treatment which is usually able to decrease the
concentration of the virus in the blood and delay the X4 appearance The use of
this model suggests a possible scenario in the case of a sudden interruption in the

therapy If the dierent R5 strains experience the same selection pressure as soon as
the therapy is stopped the X4 strain may appear sooner Infact during the treatment
the concentration of the dierent strains of R5 viruses is kept to a very low level
while T-cell abundances increase As the therapy is interrupted all the strains give
rise to a renewed infection but now also the strains closer to the X4 co-receptor
using viruses are populated and a mutation leading to an X4 strain occurs sooner
We have nally studied the inuence of switching co-receptor usage in superinfection
dynamics In Fig 7 we show T-cells dynamics for dierent times of the superinfection
event We may observe that if the superinfection occurs after the appearance of
the X4 the new R5 strain does not have any eect on T-cells behavior On the
other hand is worth noting that if the new R5 inoculum take place before the X4
appearance this may speed up the switching to the X4 phenotype if the new strain
is mutationally close to the X4
33 Investigating the mutational pathway between R5 and X4
Research into HIV dynamics has much to gain from investigating the evolution of
chemokine co-receptor usage Although CCR5 and CXCR4 are the major coreceptors
used by HIV-1 a number of chemokine receptors display coreceptor activities in vitro
Several other chemokine receptors possibly not present on the T cell membrane may
act as targets To date a number of human receptors specic for these chemokine
subfamilies have been described though many receptors are still unassigned Several
viruses for example Epstein-Barr Cytomegalovirus and Herpes Samiri contain

Fundamental to the evolutionary approach is the representation of the evolution
of sequences along lineages of evolutionary trees as these trees describe the com-
plex patterns of dependence amongst sequences that are caused by their common
ancestry 524821
The ML tree obtained using the JTTF  model of evolution is shown in Figure 8
The topology clearly shows that the CCR family is not homogeneous CCR6 CCR7
CCR9 and CCR10 are separated from the other CCRs in particular CCR10 clusters
with CXCRs CXCR4 and CXCR6 do not cluster with the CXCRs The tree shows
that there are many mutational steps between CCR5 and CXCR4 The phylogeny
suggests that the mutations that allow the virus env to cover a wide phenotypic
distance from R5 to X4 may also lead to visit other receptors Since the external
loops of CRs contain the binding specicities and have higher rates of evolution than
internal loops and transmembrane segments

longer mutational pathway between CCR5 and CXCR4 with respect to pathway
linking CCR5 to other receptors
4 Discussion
The worldwide presence of several strains of the HIV virus and their often simultane-
ous presence within a patient due to the increased frequency of multiple infections
are the remarkable features of HIV pandemia For example HIV-1 exists as several
groups subdivided in growing number of subtypes which are slightly predominant in
dierent geographical regions 58 HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells isolated from the
spleens of two individuals were recently shown to harbor anywhere between one and
eight proviruses with an average of three to four proviruses per cell 13 Mutations
recombinations and selection pressure cause the appearance of quasispecies 17
The interest in HIV quasispecies is motivated by concern about developing strain
specic drugs Quasispecies are likely the key for understanding the emerging in-
fectious diseases and has implications for transmission public health counseling
treatment and vaccine development Moreover the observed co-evolutionary dy-
namics of virus and immune response opens the way to the challenging possibility
of the introduction or modulation of a quasispecies to be used in therapy against an
already present aggressive strain as experimented by Snell and colleagues 47 The
authors showed that the introduction of an engineered virus can achieve HIV load
reduction of 92 and recovery of host cells to 17 of their normal levels see also
the mathematical model in Ref 44
Dierent drug treatments can alter the population of quasispecies Will R5 blocking
drugs cause HIV to start using X4 And will that be worse than letting the R5-using
virus stay around along at its own slower but no less dangerous activity
We rst presented a model of the within-patience persistence of HIV quasispecies by
extending to multiple strain the Perelsons standard model 42 This approach allows
to incorporate coevolutive and competitive dynamics resulting from the dierent
strains of HIV virus and dierent antigen recognition abilities by the immune system
considered Our model shows that the time evolution of the competition between
quasispecies is slow and has time scales of several months
Recent works show that TNF is a prognostic marker for the progression of HIV
disease 2526 We focused on both the inability of the thymus to eciently com-
pensate for even a relatively small loss of T cells precursors and on the role of TNF
in regulating the interactions between the dierent strains of HIV virus The second
model we have introduced shows that keeping low the concentration of TNF both
the depletion of T-cells precursors repertoire and the R5 overcome by X4 strains
slow down
Phylogenetic inference of chemokine receptors shows that there are several muta-
tional patterns linking CCR5 to several receptors that have the same branch length
of that from CCR5 to CXCR4 There is a massive abundance of signaling disruptions
in the immune systems during AIDS progression particularly after the transition
R5 to X4 These disruptions may be due to variants of the virus which bind other
chemokine receptors This hypothesis also suggests that R5-late strains in not-X4
AIDS which are known to be dierent from R5 early strains may have accumulated
mutations enabling them to interact with other chemokine receptors Therefore our
model suggests the sooner the HAART the better because the presence of a large
number of R5 will increase the mutational spectra in R5 strains late R5 and the
probability of getting closer to the binding specicities of other chemokine receptors
The large eect of TNF on T cells dynamics described by our model suggests the
benet of a TNF buering therapy It is known that the dynamics of TNF is related
to the dynamics of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL In this model
we consider constant the concentration of TRAIL 26 and we do not consider many
other important players such as Rantes
Our models represent also a general framework to investigate intermittency or
switching dominance of strains and the arising of new dominant strains during dif-
ferent phases of therapy how superinfection will evolve in case of replacement of
drug-resistant virus with a drug-sensitive virus and acquisition of highly divergent
viruses of dierent strains to investigate whether antiviral treatment may increase
susceptibility to superinfection by decreasing antigen load
Work in progress focuses on rening the R5toX4 model by incorporating the
dynamics for TRAIL and comparing our results with those of Ribeiro and col-
leagues 45 who have presented a model of R5 to X4 switch based on the hypothesis
that X4 and R5 viruses have a preferential tropism for nave and memory T cells
respectively
