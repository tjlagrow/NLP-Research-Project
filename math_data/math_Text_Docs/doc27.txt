Abstract
We revisit the tunneling process from a Schwarzschild black hole in the noncommutative space-
time and obtain the non-thermal tunneling probability In such non-thermal spectrum the corre-
lations are discovered which can carry the information about the noncommutativity Thus this
enlightens a way to nd the noncommutative information in the Hawking radiation The entropy
is also shown to be conserved in the whole radiation process which implies that the unitarity is
held even for the Hawking radiation from noncommutative black holes

INTRODUCTION
Hawkings semiclassical analysis 1 2 of the black hole radiation suggests that the infor-
mation collapsed into the black hole will lose for ever since the thermal radiation can not
carry any information This means that the unitarity as required by quantum mechanics
is violated However it is found that the background geometry is considered xed and
the energy conservation is not enforced during the radiation process in Hawking method
Recently Parikh and Wilczek suggested 3 a method based on energy conservation by cal-
culating the particle ux in Painleve coordinates from the tunneling picture Their result
recovered the Hawkings original result in leading order and gave the consistent tempera-
ture expression and the entropy relation The method had also been discussed generally in
dierent situations 48 and showed the formula was self consistent even when checked by
using thermodynamic relation 913 Another important aspect is to give the non-thermal
spectrum as shown in Ref
14 that there exist information-carrying correlation in the
radiation spectrum and the entropy is conserved in the sequential tunneling process Along
this line the extention has been made in Ref 1518
It is noted that the noncommutativity had been introduced into the investigation of
Hawking radiation as tunneling 11 The noncommutativity 1922 can provide the mini-
mal length scale upon the generalized uncertainty principle since the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle may not be satised when quantum gravitational eects become important More-
over the noncommutativity also provides a totally dierent black hole and the noncom-
mutative black hole thermodynamics is also investigated in the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling
picture 11 Particularly the noncommutativity leads to the only remnant result of black
hole radiation since it can remove the so-called Hawking paradox where the temperature di-
verges as the radius of a standard black hole shrinks to zero This is advantageous over the
standard Schwarzschild black hole whose nal radiation will lead to divergence of the tem-
perature and over the quantum corrected black hole whose nal radiation is dependent on
the quantum corrected parameter which may be dierent in string theory and loop quantum
gravity theory 5 In the paper we will show there exist correlations among the radiated
particles in the situation of noncommutative black holes and these correlations could carry
the information about noncommutativity hidden in spacetime We also check the entropy
conservation in the radiation process which is consistent with the unitarity of quantum
mechanics
The organization of the paper is as follows
In the second section we revisit the tun-
neling through the noncommutative black hole and discuss its thermodynamics The third
section is devoted to investigation of correlation and entropy conservation for the radiation
of noncommutative black hole Finally we summarize our results in the fourth section
In this paper we take the unit convention k    c  G  1
II TUNNELING IN NONCOMMUTATIVE SPACE AND THERMODYNAMICS
In the section we will recalculate the particles tunneling probability from the
Schwarzschild black hole in noncommutative space along the line presented in Ref
In order to include the noncommutative eect in gravity we can change the mass of grav-
itating object The usual denition of mass density in commutative space is expressed in
terms of Dirac delta function but in noncommutative space the form breaks down due
to position-position uncertainty relation
It is shown that noncommutativity eliminates
point-like structures in favor of smeared objects in at spacetime The eect of smearing
is implemented by redening the mass density by a Gaussian distribution of minimal width
 instead of the Dirac delta function Here  is the noncommutative parameter which is
considered to be a small Planck length positive number and comes from the noncommu-
tator of x x  i with   diagcid21    D2cid3 It is noted the constancy of  is
related to a consistent treatment of Lorentz invariance and unitarity For the purpose of
noncommutativity the mass density is chosen as
which plays the role of a matter source and the mass is smeared around the region 
instead of locating at a point To nd a solution of Einstein equation G  8T with

so the pressure is again isotropic and the Schwarzschild vacuum solution is well applicable

In what follows in order to describe cross-horizon phenomena of tunneling particles we
have to change the coordinates 2 to quasi-Painleve coordinates which are regular and not
singular at the horizon Doing the time Painleve coordinate transformation we obtain the
new coordinates as

where   cid16 3

where the upper lower sign can be identied with the outgoing incoming radial motion
under the implicit assumption that time t increases towards the future
Let us consider a positive energy shell to cross the horizon in the outward direction from
ri to rf  Along the method given by Parikh and Wilczek the imaginary part of the action
for that shell is given by
Im I  ImZ rf
prdr  ImZ rf
ri Z pr
rdr  ImZ H
Moreover if the self-gravitation is included we have to make the replacement M 
M  E in Eqs 4 and 5 where E is the outgoing particles energy Thus the expression
6 is modied as
Im I  ImZ ME
drd M  E
  ImZ E
where we have changed the integration variable from H  to E  Then inserting the Eq 5
into the expression of the imaginary part of the action we have

where the result is obtained up to the leading order 1

In what follows we will check the thermodynamics for tunneling from noncommutative
black hole Generally we can obtain the temperature from the tunneling probability by
comparing it with the thermal Boltzmann relation Here it is dicult to expanding the
expression 9 to obtain the leading term However we could also consider the rst law of
thermodynamics to check whether the radiation temperature given by thermodynamic rela-
dM is equal to 
2 where  is the surface gravity of the black hole Since the metric
2 is static the surface gravity can be calculated as   1
Thus one can get the temperature

When the noncommutative parameter   0 the temperature decays into the standard
form TH  1
8M  Note that for standard form of black hole temperature in the limit
M  0 the temperature will be innite But the consideration of noncommutative black
hole radiation will avoid the divergence problem From the expression 10 we obtain that
the temperature will fall down to zero at some denite value ie rh  r0 As a result
the noncommutativity restricts evaporation process to a remnant In the region of rh  r0
there is no black hole since the temperature can not be dened 20 22
On the other hand we can obtain the entropy of the noncommutative black hole by
deforming the Bekenstein-Hawking relation

One can check easily that the temperature given by 1
dM is equivalent to that given by

factor eET and nd that the tunneling probability 9 gives a non-thermal spectrum
Moreover a detailed calculation shows that SN  SN f  SN i  2 Im I with ri  2M1

So we have

which shows the tunneling probability is related to the change of noncommutative black hole
entropy
III CORRELATION AND ENTROPY CONSERVATION IN THE RADIATION
PROCESS
In the previous section it has been shown that the tunneling probability satised the
relation   eS and gave a non-thermal spectrum for the noncommutative black hole
Such a spectrum is intriguing and could give some suggestions for the black hole information
loss paradox In the section along the line outlined by us earlier 14 we will show that
there exists correlation between the tunneling particles and the entropy is conserved in the
tunneling process
Considering two emissions with energies E1 and E2 and using the expression 9 we have

where the tunneling probability for the second radiation is a conditional probability given
the occurrence of tunneling of the particle with energy E1 According to the denition of
joint probability in statistical theory 23 we get
N E1 E2  N E1 N E2E1

We can check that N E1 E2  N E1  E2 which is the emission of particle with the
energy E1  E2
In order to evaluate the statistical correlation which says that two events are correlated
if the probability of the two events arising simultaneously is not equal to the product prob-
abilities of each event occurring independently we have to integrate the E1 variable in
N E1 E2 to attain the independent probability N E2

where  is the normalized factor which is the function of the black hole mass M stemmed
from the normalization of tunneling probability R N E dE  1 Now we can calculate
the statistical correlation between the two radiations
C E1 E2   ln E1  E2  ln E1 E2 6 0
Thus the adoption of a non-commutative spacetime does not change our statement that a
non-thermal spectrum arms the existence of correlation as is illustrated for a Schwarzschild
black hole We nd that the information associated with noncommutativity is factored out
in the correlation even in the early stage of Hawking radiation Thus even though non-
commutativity only exists at the small scale we can still test its eect through correlations
contained in the non-thermal spectrum of Hawking radiation Especially the LHC ex-
periment could produce the micro black hole 24 and the analogous black hole radiation
experiment has been realized through the laser 25 or BEC 26 so one can observe such
radiations to check whether there is the information about noncommutativity in them
For tunneling of two particles with energies E1 and E2 we nd the entropy

It is seen easily that they satisfy the denition for conditional entropy SE1 E2 
 ln E1  E2  SE1  SE2E1 A detailed calculation conrms that the amount
14 and this
of correlation is exactly equal to the mutual information described in Ref
shows that it is the correlation that carries away the information
If we count the total
entropy carried away by the outgoing particles we nd
SN E1 E2    En 
SN EiE1 E2    Ei1
Thus we show that entropy is conserved in Hawking radiation for a Schwarzschild black
hole in a noncommutative spacetime Note that the temperature will be zero before black
hole vanishes that is the black hole will evolve into a remnant which is in a high-entropy
state with entropy SN C  4E2

SN B  SN E1 E2    En  SN C

Using the same method as above we can also show that there exists correlations among
radiations and the entropy is conserved in the tunneling radiation process Our method
for this case however does not solve the remaining problem of whether the black hole
will evaporate to exhaustion or will halt at some value of a critical mass because of the
reaction eect or the use of a noncommutative spacetime As we discussed before when the
quantum reaction parameter  is negative a black hole will leave behind a remnant instead
of radiating into exhaustion 27 If noncommutative spacetime is introduced however the
parameter  cannot be negative in order to avoid a divergent temperature at the end of
radiation That is to say when the non-commutative parameter  6 0 a reasonable value
for  would be positive and thus when the mass of the black hole is reduced to a certain
value the temperature will drastically decrease to zero to form an extreme black hole 11
Despite these subtleties we have shown in this section that the entropy is conserved in the
tunneling process and so the information could not be lost even for the noncommutative
Schwarzschild black hole by taking into account information carried away by correlations in
emitted particles
IV CONCLUSION
Using the tunneling method and considering the noncommutative eect in Schwarzschild
spacetime the modied tunneling probability is derived Based on this probability we have
shown that the adoption of a noncommutative spacetime supports that there exist correla-
tions in non-thermal spectrum and the correlation can carry all information even including
the information about the noncommutativity which may be observed in the future LHC
experiment or simulating experiment in laboratory The entropy conservation is also inves-
tigated which implies that the radiation process of black hole is unitary in the background
of noncommutative spacetime
