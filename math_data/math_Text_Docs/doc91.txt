We develop the quantization of a macroscopic string which extends radially from a
Schwarzschild black hole The Hawking process excites a thermal bath of string modes
that causes the black hole to lose mass The resulting typical string conguration is a ran-
dom walk in the angular coordinates We show that the energy ux in string excitations
is approximately that of spacetime eld modes

1 Introduction
The collision of quantum mechanics and black hole physics has captured the interest
of the theoretical physics community The discovery of two-dimensional model systems 1
sharing many of the features of the Hawking problem has spurred the hope that one might
learn something about information storage and retrieval in black holes and perhaps about
some essential features of quantum gravity Before this hope evaporates with or without
a remnant we would like to point out another context in which such two-dimensional
systems crop up the quantization of the collective modes of a macroscopic string trapped
by a black hole
Often one ties two-dimensional model systems to four-dimensional physics when at
the core of a spherically symmetric object all but S-wave modes of the four-dimensional
system are eectively massive 2 3 and may be integrated out For a macroscopic string
a somewhat dierent mechanism occurs The internal excitations of the string core are
irrelevant to the physics of the Nambu-Goldstone transverse oscillation modes for a macro-
scopic fundamental string there are no such core excitations The dominant dynamical
eects come from the projection of the spacetime geometry onto the world sheet of the
propagating string When the string is trapped by the event horizon of a black hole the
event horizon is projected onto the world sheet Hence one expects Hawking radiation of
transverse string oscillations to occur upon quantization Since the essence of the Hawking
paradox is whether information follows energy it would seem that one ought to understand
it in this somewhat simpler two-dimensional context Any remnant scenario would entail a
huge expansion of the string density of states since the remnant would be threaded by the
string although such remnants might be hard to produce as may be the case for recently
considered species of remnant 4 If black holes violate quantum mechanical unitarity
we will have to face the problem already in the quantization of a single string
Hawking radiation along the string leads to a number of interesting questions of
which we shall address two which involve eects of the radiation on the string and its
back-reaction on spacetime We will show that the thermal bath of emitted string modes
causes the mean square transverse extent of the string to grow linearly with its length or
some other infrared cuto L
and that the power radiated in the string Hawking process is

where rh is the horizon radius This is to be compared with eg the total radiated power
a spacetime massless scalar eld in the presence of a black hole which is the same within
numerical factors
We begin in section 2 with the analysis of the small uctuations of a single straight
innitely long bosonic string in a Schwarzschild black hole background in the critical
dimension of string theory by expanding the -model action to quadratic order in Rie-
mannian normal coordinates
In section 3 we discuss the linearized classical equations
of motion and show that the physical solutions are stable to this order In section 4 we
quantize the transverse uctuations in a physical gauge demonstrating both through this
gauge xing and through path integral techniques in conformal gauge that there are dcr2
independent physical coordinates in the critical dimension We choose the Unruh vacuum
as the string state and construct the Bogolubov transformations used to describe Hawking
radiation Those who are familiar with this material may wish to skip directly to section
5 where we compute some observable manifestations of the Hawking process the mean
square deviation from the equilibrium position and the radiation of spacetime energy onto
the string both characteristic of a string thermally excited at the Hawking temperature
2 The string action in a Schwarzschild background
21 The background and the -model action
The metric of the Schwarzschild black hole in D dimensions is derivable in the same
fashion as the 4-dimensional case and diers only in the power of the radial coordinate
dependence of the metric for the r  t plane see for example 5

Figure 1 shows the standard Penrose diagram for the r-t or x-y plane of the black
hole labelled with our notational conventions
We wish to study an innitely long string uctuating in this background we will
assume that the string and its uctuations have a negligible eect on the spacetime We
will also assume that the black hole has a large mass or equivalently a large horizon radius
rh which will allow us to expand the action out in inverse powers of rh in addition
since the Hawking temperature goes as the inverse of the horizon radius we may treat
adiabatically the change in the background metric due to the shrinking of the black hole
The action may be written as the -model action1

The ghost action will arise from xing to conformal gauge with some ducial metric h
multiplied by an arbitrary conformal factor  The ghost action will be the same as that
of a string in Minkowski spacetime it arises purely from the worldsheet geometry and will
depend explicitly on the ducial metic and implicitly through ultraviolet regulation on
 Note that since the space-time metric is Ricci-at this theory is free of the conformal
anomaly in 26 dimensions 7 The generalization to the supersymmetric -model in this
background is straightforward
22 Normal coordinate expansion
We would like to examine small uctuations around an equilibrium position of the
string ie about some solution to the classical equations of motion thus we want some

ding denes a one-to-one mapping between the x  y plane of spacetime and the classical
worldsheet of the string We may also pull back the metric for the spacetime x  y plane

Riemannian normal coordinates are a standard and natural way to carry out a Taylor
expansion of the -model action in a manifestly coordinate invariant fashion see 8 for an
explanation of this expansion in the bosonic and supersymmetric -models In particular
it is an expansion in derivatives of the metric one nds that a term in the action of
order n in small uctuations is accompanied by geometric coecients derivatives of and
combinations of derivatives of the Riemann tensor containing n derivatives of the metric
Since the only dimensionful quantity in the metric is rh we may regard this expansion
as an expansion in the uctuation size divided by rh then the expansion is good if the
uctuations are small on the scale of the black hole or if one is in the asymptotic region
Classically this means simply that we wish to perturb the string shake it with small
amplitude Quantum mechanically the strength of worldsheet uctuations is given by 12
which appears in front of the nonlinear -model action thus perturbations to expectation
values coming from nonlinear terms will be of higher order in srh
Following 8 let us expand the coordinate elds and the spacetime metric in normal
coordinates which are contravariant vectors  in spacetime We may rewrite these as
spacetime tangent frame quantities

 Xcl 
where em
 Xcl is the vielbein eld of the spacetime manifold at the spacetime coordinate
Xcl By working with these vielbein elds we will have a more standard kinetic term
and thus a more standard propagator The nal form of the action for small coordinate

In fact if we let   X u

term for the transverse coordinates in general the curvature terms will be some nite
r-dependent piece vanishing as a power of rhr asymptotically times a factor of 1r2
Hence the kinetic term dominates the action far from the horizon On the other hand
near the horizon the modes relevant to Hawking radiation are highly blue-shifted and also
dominate the curvature terms

again with r  rx   y   It is easy to see that 32 vanishes for large r For
r close to rh we may substitute in 27 and 23 and use 25 to nd that the zero
in  cancels the zero in 1  rhrD3 and that the result is a nite number As
we shall see all the modes will be blueshifted innitely at the horizon so that the kinetic
term will then dominate close to the horizon Thus we will after ensuring stability use
the zeroth-order approximation that the transverse modes satisfy the 2-d massless Klein-
Gordon equation for the purpose of computing Bogolubov transformations between mode
bases The inaccuracy of this procedure lies in the fact that there is mixing between
left- and right-moving modes due to scattering o the background curvature Hence the
Bogolubov coecients will mix left- and right-moving creation and annihilation operators
We were unable to solve 31 exactly but one can nd solutions that work asymp-
totically as r   r  rh and as r r   To do this transform the variables as
follows

Note that these coordinates are only dened in one or the other regions of Figure I which
are outside the horizon we will dene an appropriate analytic continuation below

where  should be real for stable solutions Solutions to this approximate equation are

for any  Translated back into Kruskal coordinates the solutions become
k  i
i 
These mode solutions are standard in Hawking radiation calculations 9 10 and
following Unruh and Birrell and Davies we put the logarithmic branch cut for 38 in the
upper half plane by making the choice
1  ei 
With this choice the solutions in 38 are analytic in the lower half plane of x and
thus their Fourier transforms vanish for   0 so that the modes shown are positive
frequency in  for all  Note also that for r   these look like plane wave solutions
in Schwarzchild coordinates
The equations of motion for the longitudinal modes are most easily solved in their
coordinate vector form The equations are

y 
f
x  0
y  0 
x  x Z 
y  y Z

f  
where xy and xy are arbitrary functions
The actual classical solutions to this equation should include the satisfaction of the
Virasoro constraints If the gradients of the coordinate uctuation elds are moderate as
they are asymptotically the constraints will be self-consistently solved by equating the
linear term in longitudinal modes to the quadratic term in transverse modes the terms
quadratic in longitudinal modes will be of fourth order in the uctuation size and should
be dealt with in the next order of the calculation Thus we nd that in the asymptotic
region where k  i
x 2i2
x 2i
r   
As r approaches rh however f x will become large and the term in 218 which is second
order in derivatives of longitudinal uctuations will become even larger and will become
the dominant contribution to the longitudinal stress tensor Thus near the horizon we
should equate this quadratic term with kk Specically the piece of the stress
tensor quadratic in derivatives of longitudinal uctuations is
f xy 
y  x y Z 
d y
r cid17D2cid21 
As r  rh we can nd by writing out  in terms of r and t that f f vanishes as
r  rh as we approach the horizon thus in this limit

f cid19 y  xy 
and similarly for x  y    Matching these forms to kk  2i2 we
can solve the constraints to lowest order by setting
xy  i1
xy  i
r  rh 
Note that with this solution the term quadratic in the derivatives of longitudinal uctu-
ations indeed diverges faster than both the term linear in the derivatives and the non-
derivative quadratic term
32 Classical linear stability
Before we quantize the quadratic theory 216 we need to know whether it is clas-
sically consistent  that is if small uctuations stay small over time We should note
that simply looking at the size of  over space and time is incorrect since the metric is
invariably singular in some region of spacetime for whatever coordinate system we might
choose  in H  for Schwarzschild coordinates and in I  for Kruskal coordinates The
natural quantity to look at is the scalar product of the uctuations

For the transverse uctuations in the absence of exact solutions to 35 we shall try
to cast the equations of motion into a Sturm-Liouville form where stability is obvious If
we make an additional change of variables

with r used as an implicit function of R Roughly 318 is the Klein-Gordon equation
with a spatially varying mass term Since the mass squared gR is always positive the
normalizable transverse solutions are stable
Knowing this we may use i for real  as a complete set of asymptotic solutions
for the transverse equations of motion and we may then use the results of the previous
subsection to examine the form of the longitudinal solutions in the asymptotic regions
For the r   region

so that the scalar product of the longitudinal uctuations is

For the r  rh region f is a regular nite quantity the zero in 1 cancelling the
zero in 1  rrhD3 The form of xy near the horizon will be
x  i Z

and similarly for x  y    Naive power counting tells us that the second term
should be regular near the horizon so that gxyxy is also regular near the horizon
4 Quantization
In this section we would like to address two separate issues the imposition of the Vi-
rasoro constraints on the theory dened by 216 and the problems of selecting physically
motivated in and out states We will rst discuss in general the conformal invariance
of the system and argue that the angular uctuations are a good representation of the
physical Hilbert space of the string by showing that the partition function depends only on
the determinants of the transverse uctuation operators We will then discuss the possible
denitions of the positive frequency modes of the transverse uctuations and construct
the desired vacuum states and their Bogolubov transformations Finally we shall argue
that the Hawking radiation does not include unphysical modes if the BRST cohomology
theorem holds for this system
41 Path integral quantization
Now the full nonlinear -model action 29 satises the -function equations of 7
in the standard critical dimensions to rst order in  since the metric coupling satises
Einsteins equations Thus we should be able to use the conformal invariance to decouple
the negative-norm states in the Hilbert space of coordinates plus ghosts and we expect
that in principle one should be able to embark upon a standard covariant quantization
program by imposing the Virasoro conditions or the corresponding BRST condition We
have not been able to successfully use this formalism to prove a no-ghost theorem due to
the subtleties of constructing the vacuum which involves correlating the uctuations of
the string near the horizon and in the asymptotic region
If the spectrum is free of negative norm states and conformal invariance may be
imposed on the quantum level then the only physical degrees of freedom are the transverse
oscillations of the string as in at space We will support this supposition by showing that
the partition function depends only on the determinants of the transverse uctuations
upon integrating out the conformal ghosts and at quadratic order the longitudinal bosonic
coordinates we will nd that determinants from these integrals will formally cancel each
other leaving only the partition function for the transverse coordinates
Consider the longitudinal 0 1 part of 216 and integrate it by parts to put the
lagrangian in the form L  mDmnn The result is

where m and n are restricted to 0 and 1 which the vielbeins map back to the x y plane
Integrating over 0 and 1 leads to the determinant of the above quadratic operator On
the other hand Polyakov11 showed that in writing an arbitrary metric as
h  h     
where  is the worldsheet covariant derivative the functional integration measure is
Dg  DD detL 
L    h  
If we change variables from the coordinate vectors  to the tangent space vectors
 is the zweibein for the worldsheet with metric h then we get
a  ea
43 with the indices on the right hand side changed to tangent space indices and the
 where ea
tangent space operator Lab identical to the operator in 41 so that the Fadeev-Popov
determinant formally cancels the determinant arising from integrating out the longitudinal
In performing the normal coordinate expansion the elds became contravariant vec-
tors in spacetime and so the kinetic terms were endowed with a spin connection induced
by the spacetime geometry This allowed us to use the determinants which arose from inte-
grating out the longitudinal uctuations to cancel the Fadeev-Popov determinant written
with worldsheet covariant derivatives acting on worldsheet vectors and spinors the world-
sheet metric is pulled back from the spacetime metric so it is reasonable to state that
the worldsheet tangent space structure and thus the spin connection is induced by the
spacetime tangent space structure Thus this cancellation is a consequence of our choice
of equilibrium classical solution and of the particluar choice of ducial metric shown in
equation 211
It is important to keep straight in the above argument the distinction between the
intrinsic metric h and the induced metric   X X G X The determinants
that arise at quadratic order in the functional integral have the structure
detF P Labh det1
X Lmn det1
X 0G
where 0 is the quadratic uctuation operator of the transverse modes The arguments of
the dierential operators indicate their explicit dependences of course each determinant
implicitly depends on h through the regulator Since we are in the critical dimension the
derivative of this product of determinants with respect to h vanishes On the other hand
if we are interested in the value of the determinants at the point h   then the above
treatment shows that the rst two determinants cancel and the partition function will be
the determinant of the transverse uctuation operator regulated with the induced metric
42 Operator quantization vacuum states and Bogolubov transformations
In constructing the Hilbert space of the transverse uctuations we are faced with the
well-known problem of nding a reasonable physical vacuum state see for example 10 for
a general discussion given curved worldsheet and spacetime manifolds In the absence of
an exact quantization we are restricted to constructing this vacuum perturbatively in the
normal coordinate expansion Based on the analysis of the previous section this expansion
is consistent with the solution of the Virasoro constraints in conformal gauge Moreover
we expect to be able to dress any state in the Hilbert space of the transverse modes into
a physical state whose dependence on the longitudinal coordinates is a small deviation
from the classical identication   X x   X y which may be corrected for system-
atically order by order In particular we may use the classical worldsheet  spacetime
correspondence to ask what worldsheet uctuations might be positive frequency with re-
spect to a spacetime observer Here we will assume that the aforementioned solution to
the Virasoro constraints may be arrived at quantum mechanically in xing to a physical
light-cone-like gauge along the lines of section 31 The problem then reduces in lowest
order to that of considering the transverse uctuations in 216 as a eld theory in a 2d
spacetime corresponding to the r - t or x - y plane of a Schwarzschild black hole scalar eld
theories in this 2-D spacetime have been well studied see for example 910and references
therein
We wish to assume that the in vacuum consists of no excitations in the far past in
Schwarzschild time On the Kruskal manifold this corresponds to asking that there are
no eld excitations leaving H  and I  in region I of gure 1 and no excitations leaving
H  and I in region II of gure 1 An observer at I 
I  living in an asymptotically at
region will be a Schwarzschild observer and thus will dene positive frequency modes with
respect to the Schwarzschild time t An observer leaving or falling into the horizon or
at least one for whom the horizon is a nite time away will be a Kruskal observer and
thus will dene positive frequency modes with respect to a characteristic Kruskal time
in particular on H  and I  the timelike Killing vector becomes lightlike so that the
characteristic Kruskal time will be  or  depending on the surface Thus the in
vacuum is in region I annihilated by left-moving modes which are positive-frequency with
respect to t and right-moving modes which are positive frequency with respect to Kruskal
time We are only asking questions about observers in region I of our Kruskal diagram so
we have chosen the modes in region II for mathematical convenience  phenomena in region
I will not depend on how we treat region II This vacuum is the Unruh vacuum used to
mock up gravitational collapse 91012 We might use other vacuums for example by
asking that there is no radiation entering or leaving the horizon H 
I  the Hartle-
Hawking vacuum 10  but the Unruh vacuum is physically compelling and at any rate
I  H 
the extension of our calculations to the Kruskal vacuum is not dicult
The out vacuum we choose corresponds to an observer in the far future I
I  who
living in an asymptotically at region will dene positive frequency modes in terms of
Schwarzschild time thus the out vacuum is that annihilated by all modes which are
positive frequency with respect to t This is known as the Schwarzschild vacuum
For the right-moving modes used to dene the Unruh vacuum we use the solutions
i which are as we have stated below 39 are positive frequency for all real 
Negative frequency modes are dened by taking the complex conjugate which is most
easily computed by writing xi properly in terms of Schwarzschild modes in region I and
xia  ea eiuI x  eiuI I x
y1a  eivI y  eaeivI I y
D  3
where uI and uII are the Schwarzschild null coordinates in region I and II respectively of
gure I and  is the Heaviside function Note that due to the real exponential factor the
complex conjugate of xi is dierent from xi More formally complex conjugation will
move the logarithmic branch cut in xi from the upper half plane as dened in 39 to
the lower half plane so that the complex conjugate is upper half plane analytic and thus
is composed of negative frequency modes
The transverse uctuation operators may now be written in terms of the two dierent
mode decompositions The frequency-dependent coecients in the sums over modes arise
from requiring that the single-particle wavefunction in front of each operator is normalized
to a delta function under the Klein-Gordon norm 10 9 These decompositions are
in the modes by which we dene the Unruh vacuum and

We shall use these transformations in the next section to compute the Hawking radi-

43 Physical states and Hawking radiation
One of the original motivations of this work was to gure out whether the Virasoro
constraints could be consistently imposed in the covariant formalism in the presence of
Hawking radiation one might think that the Hawking radiation would populate all modes
 ghosts longitudinal modes etc  thermally and so there is no way to guarantee that an
asymptotic observer would not see unphysical modes radiated by the black hole However
in order to ask physical questions one must either work in a physical gauge or work with
physical operators in a covariant gauge and dene the vacuum in a physical fashion
The rst question that should be asked is whether one may legitimately x to the
physical gauge we have chosen or in covariant language whether one may consistently
impose the BRST condition
QBRSTphysicali  0
and nd an appropriate representation for the BRST cohomology classes We have not
been able to rigorously prove either but given that classically one may x a physical
gauge that the theory is anomaly free to one loop since the one-loop -model beta
functional vanishes and that the longitudinal vacuum uctuations explicitly cancel o
the ghost vacuum uctuations in the partition function again to one loop it seems that
we have sucient circumstantial evidence that the constraints may be solved explicitly
and consistently
Given a consistent physical gauge we may simply work with the transverse oscillators
and solve for the longitudinal oscillators order by order This is ne for computing quanti-
ties such the size of transverse uctuations h2i or the expectation value of the transverse
stress tensor at least to lowest order in the normal coordinate expansion as we shall be-
low Alternatively if BRST quantization is consistent we expect that we can represent
the BRST cohomology classes by building states with DDF-like operators13141516
This also amounts to dressing the transverse oscillators with longitudinal modes to make
a physical state In building such states we are faced with questions of what a physical
spacetime observer sees as positive frequency the worldsheet coordinates have no mean-
ing in covariant gauge so in particular the question of what is a positive frequency mode
on the worldsheet has no inherent spacetime meaning However since the frequency of a
DDF operator is a spacetime quantity we use it to dene the vacuum directly with these
manifestly physical operators This is exactly what Schoutens etal 17 have done for
their model of 2-D black hole evaporation We see why our original fear was naive a
proper formulation of the theory avoids any question of unphysical modes before Hawking
radiation ever becomes an issue
This argument can be recast in terms of more physical or heuristic descriptions of
Hawking radiation
If one considers Hawking radiation as due to pair production near
the horizon 10 then the argument means essentially that pair production involves only
physical modes so that only physical states are radiated to I Similarly if one describes
Hawking radiation via a density matrix due to a summation over states at or behind the
horizon hidden from our asymptotic observer at I then one will sum only over states in
the physical Hilbert space  the full Hilbert space including negative norm states being in
some sense a ction arising from the gauge freedom remaining after passing to a covariant
5 Physical manifestations of the Hawking process
Having discussed quantization and the dierence between the in and out vacuums
one may begin to ask some physical questions about the string The Hawking radiation
in the 2d worldsheet eld theory will manifest itself in some thermal population of the
transverse modes in the out basis which means that an asymptotic Schwarzschild
observer will see the string uctuating as if it was thermally excited with the worldsheet
temperature equal to the Hawking temperature
hcD  3
The three most apparent to us detectable manifestations of this radiation are the thermal
wandering of the string the energy that is radiated in string uctuations out of the black
hole towards I and the production of physical spacetime modes microscopic strings
due to transitions of the excited string We discuss the rst two of these for the bosonic
string in the following subsections
51 Wandering of the string in the Schwarzschild background
As an estimation of the wandering of the string we may calculate the mean square
deviation from the classical background solution

i we take to
We need to x both the state i and the normal ordering prescription
be the Unruh vacuum but we wish to normal order this expression with respect to the
Schwarzschild modes on the assumption that normal ordering is a function of the observer
This means that we begin by expanding the operators k according to 48 pushing
the Schwarzschild creation operators to the left of the destruction operators and then
using 410 to expand out ck in terms of bk so as to be able to calculate the expectation
value in the in state which is annihilated by ak and bk The normal ordered correlator

where we have put in a factor of 2
to give h2i the correct dimensions We note immediately that the normal ordering has
removed the ultraviolet divergences but a nasty infrared divergence remains Eq 53
has the form R dDhn THi with D being the density of states of a 2d Bose gas of
D  2 massless particles where kBTH  1  12a The IR divergences arising from
the density of states and from the Planck distribution function are characteristic of this
general statistical mechanical system in the innite volume limit and are entirely physical
Also note that the transverse stress tensor  is infrared nite at this order To make
sense of 53 we need a physically motivated nite-size or nite-time cuto  an example
of the latter is the nite lifetime of the black hole
Thus if one regulates 53 with an infrared momentum cuto at momentum  one
nds that h2i diverges linearly with the cuto
h2i 
D  22
2
The deviation then goes as the square root of the nite-size or nite-time cuto 1 so that
the average string conguration is that of a random walk This is a result we might have
expected from studies of average string congurations at nite temperature in particular
Mitchell and Turok 19 found that for closed bosonic strings at nite temperature the
mean square radius of the string scaled as the length L of the string
hr2i  L 
Nevertheless the angular variation   r is well-behaved so although the string uc-
tuates far from its center of mass it does not cover a large solid angle of the black hole
The presence of this infrared catastrophe indicates that although the equations of
motion derived from 213 are stable we expect that quantum uctuations will require us
to include some nonlinear eects in the worldsheet eective action One might worry that
since the thermal propagator for the transverse string uctuations is quadratically infrared
divergent that higher order corrections to eg the stress tensor will be much larger than
the eects we have calculated see below We believe that what is breaking down is not the
order of magnitude of the radiated Hawking ux but rather the Taylor expansion of certain
quantities in the action For example part of the small uctuation expansion involves the
Taylor expansion of terms like GXcl   which has a radius of convergence of order
rcl So instead of treating perturbatively the quantum uctuations of all the modes we
should introduce an infrared cuto and treat the low frequency oscillations adiabatically
and classically since they have large occupation numbers while quantizing all the higher
frequency modes This scheme should work quite well if we stay far from the horizon
52 Energy radiated onto the string
We would like some idea of the energy radiated onto the string in the Hawking process
The world-sheet stress tensor measures the world-sheet energy radiated out along the
string so a denite relation between world-sheet and spacetime time coordinates will relate
world-sheet and spacetime energy densities and uxes Such a relation is provided by the
classical solution 210 hence we expect that the spacetime and world-sheet energy uxes
should coincide
We shall work entirely in the asymptotically at regime of spacetime in Schwartzchild
null coordinates In this region the Lagrangian 29 is manifestly approximately Lorentz
invariant and so there is an asymptotically well dened Noether current

Expanding in normal coordinates we nd that

The second term on the left hand side should vanish since we are looking at oscillating

string tension so that converting energy density to energy ux

In order to compute the Hawking radiation we wish to take the vacuum expectation value
of  T   in the Unruh vacuum with normal ordering performed as before with respect to
the Schwarzchild vacuum With this vacuum and normal ordering prescription only T 
will be non-zero and we nd that to lowest order

The mass per unit time radiated out onto the string is thus found to be
energy ux 
time 
where we have put all of the physical constants back in
We may ask when the energy radiated onto the string modes is larger than the radi-
ation into spacetime modes The energy ux into for example a scalar eld such as the
string dilaton is essentially the same as calculated above since the radiation is mostly into
S-wave states
Thus the energy ux of radiation onto string modes is proportional to the energy ux of
spacetime scalars
In fact both the world-sheet and spacetime eld energy uxes dier from the esti-
mates 514 and 515 in several ways Both the spacetime eld modes and the angular
string uctuations will suer backscattering from the gravitational eld near the horizon
This backscattering will be frequency-dependent and for energies typical of the Hawk-
ing radiation leads to a non-negligible fraction of the radiation to be reabsorbed by the
black hole Curiously although the shape of this barrier is in general dierent for space-
time S-waves and string angular uctuations the two barriers are identical in D  4 The
spacetime eld modes of nonzero angular momentum also contribute some ux decreasing
exponentially in the angular momentum which does not signicantly alter the total ux
Finally it should be emphasized that the string is generally propagating in a spacetime
schw Kdcr D the product of the D-dimensional Schwarzschild geometry we have been
discussing and an unspecied internal manifold K that together with Mschw makes up the
total eective central charge dcr of the sigma model in which the string propagates The
string coordinates of this internal space will also Hawking radiate and in this case there
is no barrier from the Schwarzschild curvature The corrections to the ux in internal
coordinates come from the dierence between the density of states of the sigma model
on K and that of free elds If the sigma model on K is weakly coupled in the normal
coordinate expansion the corrections to the stress tensor will be down by powers of srK
where rK is the typical radius of curvature of K Thus the total ux in spacetime modes
will be roughly proportional to the number of massless spacetime elds remembering to
count polarization states and correct for the angular momentum barrier in case of intrinsic
spin while the ux in string modes will be roughly proportional to dcr  2
Finally one should remember that when the black hole entraps the macroscopic string
two semi-innite pieces protrude from the horizon This doubles the ux into string modes
 or does it For chirally asymmetric strings one of the two pieces propagates left-moving
string modes in the radially outward direction the other piece propagates right-moving
string modes radially outward Thus the energy-momentum ux in general diers for the
two halves This eect is most pronounced for the heterotic string in the critical dimension
where the left-moving bosonic string ux is that of 24 bosons while that of the right-
moving fermionic string ux is eectively that of 12 bosons eg by bosonizing the eight
transverse fermions Curiously the back-reaction of the Hawking radiation will not only
evaporate the black hole but due to the asymmetric radiation pressure will accelerate the
black hole down the string
6 Discussion
One issue we have not really settled is how to restrict the string functional integral to
the region of eld space outside the horizon In principle the string uctuates away from
the classical solution in such a way that part of the string dips into the black hole If we
take seriously the ultraviolet uctuations of the world-sheet these dips are ubiquitous
and indeed extend to the singularity although incoherent A bit of averaging over short
distances replaces such uctuations by a renormalized wandering of order the renormal-
ization scale We leave a detailed investigation of the structure of physical states near the
horizon to future work
Another issue is the relation between the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as measured
by the world sheet in comparison to that measured by spacetime physics The former
will be either log M or constant as in the two-dimensional model system of 1 whereas
the latter will be proportional to the D  2-dimensional area of the event horizon what
states of the black hole does the string have access to The naive calculation would
suggest only the states near the horizon where the string is attached to the black hole
It has been claimed recently that the divergent quantum corrections to the entropy are
cut o in string theory 20 because of string theorys soft spacetime high energy behavior
However string theory still has divergences on the world sheet and those presumably still
contribute a logarithmic divergence to the macroscopic strings entropy unless there is
a relation between the world sheet cuto and the spacetime cuto provided by the soft
high-energy behavior of strings But how does such a relation come about Again it is not
A logical extension of the present work currently being contemplated involves the
construction of the physical vacuum According to our discussion of section 43 this
vacuum is not an incoherent superposition of all modes but rather of a thermal distribution
of transverse modes which are coherently dressed by ghosts and longitudinal modes We
intend to build such a state out of DDF-style operators for the dressed transverse oscillation
modes with the ultimate goal of calculating the amplitudes for emission and scattering of
microscopic strings
One may also contemplate a number of other model calculations which go beyond the
scope of the present work One would like to study not just the evaporation problem but
also the formation of black holes in the macroscopic string model as in the two-dimensional
system of Callan etal1 This might be achieved by an appropriate calculation of the grav-
itational eld back-reaction of a macroscopic string Naively the left- and right-moving
modes of a fundamental string in at space are free elds However we expect two counter-
propagating pulses shock waves to interact gravitationally and if suciently energetic
to form a black hole upon collision Generally one must also take into account the other
long-range elds carried by the string eg the axion and dilaton charge per unit length
carried by macroscopic fundamental strings 21 The appropriate starting point for such
a calculation might be the family of exact string solutions of Garnkle 2223
The proper relation between the string and spacetime elds were only partially ad-
dressed here It would be interesting to exhibit a self-consistent world-sheet calculation
that would incorporate the back-reaction of the macroscopic string dynamics on the space-
time elds for instance to show in a world-sheet beta function calculation how the energy
radiated along the string contributes to a decrease in the black hole mass We imagine
such eects should appear in a term of the Polyakov type  logf X2 in the world-sheet
eective action which then couples to the spacetime eective action in the manner de-
scribed in 23 This mechanism is somewhat confusing in that the macroscopic string is a
single quantum from the point of view of the string eld theory and we do not ordinarily
incorporate the classical eld of a single quantum in the classical background eg we do
not treat single electrons as small black holes or background Coulomb charges Presum-
ably one needs to resum the emission of soft gravitons from the world sheet into an eective
classical eld and such nearly on-shell gravitons will give logarithmic almost-divergences
in the world-sheet theory which resum to a modied classical eld potential From the
worlsheet point of view these microscopic strings that dress the spacetime geometry are a
resummation of baby universe processes It would be nice to understand the details
