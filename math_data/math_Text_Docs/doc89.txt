Micron-sized black holes do not necessarily have a constant horizon temperature distribu-
tion The black hole remote-sensing problem means to nd out the surface temperature
distribution of a small black hole from the spectral measurement of its Hawking grey
pulse This problem has been previously considered by Rosu who used Chens modied
Mobius inverse transform Here we hint on a Ramanujan generalization of Chens mod-
ied Mobius inverse transform that may be considered as a special wavelet processing of
the remote-sensed grey signal coming from a black hole or any other distant grey source
Keywords Mobius transform Ramanujan sums grey-body Hawking radiation black
1 INTRODUCTION
There may exist black holes in the micron size range carrying on some external dis-
tribution of matter Theoretical examples are i down-scaled Weyl black holes1 for
which the metric potentials are solutions of polar Laplace equations ii black holes
with Einstein shells2 iii primordial black holes PBH andor any mini black hole
hovering through the universe and carrying on some matter distributions iv hairy
black holes3 with additional conserved quantum numbers beyond those allowed by
the classical no hair theorems and dirty black holes in the sense of Visser4 ie black
holes in interaction with various classical elds for which the Hawking temperature
appears to be supressed relative to the vacuum black holes of equal area In some
cases for small enough black holes the external distribution of matter can be of
such a kind as to disturb only slightly the pure horizon Hawking radiation and
consequently from the praxis standpoint we have a grey-body radiation problem
Hawking radiation by itself is distorted with respect to a pure black-body spec-
trum especially in the low frequency regime due to a grey-body factor usually
identied with the square of the absorption amplitude for the mode5 A useful work
on the nature of the grey body problem for black holes has been written by Schier6
In this letter we rst review the grey body inverse problem and the modied
Mobius inverse transform Chens transform in sections 2 and 3 respectively7
In section 4 we hint on a possible Ramanujan extension of Chens transform with
possible application to small black holes and the cosmological background radiation
2 INVERSE GREY-BODY PROBLEM
Plancks law provides the analytical formula for the emitted power spectrum from
black body sources In laboratory physics the emitted power spectrum is also called
spectral brightness or spectral radiance of the black body radiation The latter
notion is used in radiometry to characterize the spectral properties of the source as
a function of position and direction from the source For point ie far away grey
sources the total radiated power spectrum also called radiant spectral intensity is
W   Z 
AT B T dT 
AT  is the area temperature distribution of the grey body
B T  is the Boltzmann-Planck occupation factor
Finding out AT  at given W  is known as the inverse grey-body problem8 W 
may be known either experimentally or within some theoretical model This in-
verse problem was solved in principle by Bojarski9 by means of a thermodynamic
coldness parameter u  hkT  and an area coldness distribution au as more
convenient variables than T and AT  to get an inverse Laplace transform of the
total radiated power The coldness distribution is obtained as an expansion in this
Laplace transform Explicitly the total grey power spectrum is rewritten as an
integral over the coldness variable
W  
c2 Z 
expu  1
and furthermore as
W  
c2 Z 
expuh
1naunidu 
Therefore the sum under the integral that we shall denote by f u is the Laplace
transform of g  c2
2h 3 W  and the inverse Laplace transform of g will provide
the sought coldness distribution
Despite the formal mathematical solution the inverse grey body problem is un-
stable for most numerical implementations ie it belongs to the broad class of
ill-posed inverse problems10
3 MODIFIED M OBIUS TRANSFORM MMT
Chen11 obtained au by means of the so-called modied Mobius transform  MMT
of f u
f un 
To understand Eq 4 we recall a few basic results from the theory of numbers12
The Mobius expansion refers to special sums over prime factor divisors d-sums
running over all the prime factors of n 1 and n included of any function f n
dened on the positive integers
Sf n 
f d 
The remarkable fact in this case is that the last term of the sum can be written
in turn as a sum over the Sf arithmetical functions The latter sum is called the
inverse Mobius transform or the Mobius d-sum of f
f n 
dSf nd 
in which the d-sum Sf n becomes the rst term of the Mobius d-sum and where
d is the famous Mobius function Since at the left hand side of 6 one has
only a term of a d-sum whereas on the right hand side there is a sum of d-sums
there is clear overcounting unless the Mobius function is sometimes either naught
or negative The partition of the prime factors of n implied by the Mobius function
is such that by denition 1 is 1 n is 1r if n includes r distinct prime
factors and n is naught in all the other cases In particular all the squares have
no contribution to the inverse Mobius transforms That is why the integers selected
by the Mobius function are also called square-free integers
Chens MMT means to apply such an inversion of nite sums to innite summa-
tions and to ordinary functions of real continuous variables MMT means that
y1x 
y2xn 
y2x 
ny1xn 
For the inverse grey-body problem y1u  uf u and y2u  uau So one
can get the coldness distribution by multiplying the Laplace transform of the total
power spectrum by the coldness parameter and then applying the MMT
4 RAMANUJAN GENERALIZATION OF CHENS TRANSFORM
Ramanujan sums are well known in number theory but only recently some physical
applications have been suggested13 They are of the form
cqm 
cos2mpq 
with irreducible fractions pq The sums are quasiperiodic in m and aperiodic
in the denominator q They are a generalization of the Mobius function since
cqm  q whenever q and m are coprimes The MMT for black holes in the
Ramanujan notation will be
uau1 
cq1uf uq 
but the point is that many other Ramanujan inverse transforms can be introduced
through
uaui 
cqiuf uq 
 lncid161  eh h 1
for integers i  1 and q i  1 One can see that a sequence of two-dimensional
analyses i q of the signal are available in this approach similarly to the time-
frequency analysis that is so characteristic to wavelets
As an example for micron-sized Schwarzschild black holes M  1024 g no known
massive particles are thermally emitted and according to the calculations of Page14
about 16 of the Hawking ux goes into photons the rest being neutrino emission
Let us consider these black holes as grey objects of the following two classes i by
their own5 and ii of the Weyl type The coldness parameter will be in the rst case
 cid17 where h is the horizon inverse temperature parameter
and  is the penetration factor of the curvature and angular momentum barrier
around the black hole5 whereas in the latter case uS  hkTd where Td can be
considered as an eective horizon temperature of the distorted black holes Td 
8M 1 exp2U where U is given in the work of Geroch and Hartle With the
coldness parameter at hand one can apply the aforementioned number methods for
the black hole emissivity problem
Before closing we mention that an alternative viewpoint on MMT developed by
Hughes et al15 in terms of Mellin transform and Riemanns  function is also ex-
tremely interesting if one takes into account that the Bekenstein-Mukhanov spectrum16
could be considered as the eigenvalue problem of relativistic Schroedinger equations
in nite dierences17
Thus it appears that a richer information content of the spectrum of important
astrophysical signals that may reveal hidden discrete features can be obtained by
extensive use of number theoretical techniques The cosmological background radi-
ation signal can be studied by the same approach and with the same aim There
are claims by Hogan18 that inationary perturbations display discreteness not pre-
dicted by the standard eld theory and that this discreteness may be observable in
cosmic background anisotropy
