LARGE DEVIATIONS FOR MARKOVIAN NONLINEAR
HAWKES PROCESSES
By Lingjiong Zhu1
New York University
Hawkes process is a class of simple point processes that is self-
exciting and has clustering eect The intensity of this point process
depends on its entire past history It has wide applications in nance
neuroscience and many other elds In this paper we study the large
deviations for nonlinear Hawkes processes The large deviations for
linear Hawkes processes has been studied by Bordenave and Torrisi
In this paper we prove rst a large deviation principle for a special
class of nonlinear Hawkes processes that is a Markovian Hawkes pro-
cess with nonlinear rate and exponential exciting function and then
generalize it to get the result for sum of exponentials exciting func-
tions We then provide an alternative proof for the large deviation
principle for a linear Hawkes process Finally we use an approxima-
tion approach to prove the large deviation principle for a special class
of nonlinear Hawkes processes with general exciting functions

R and we always assume that khkL1 R 0 ht dt   The notation
0 ht  sN ds stands forR0t ht  sN ds Local integrability assump-
tion of  ensures that the process is nonexplosive and left continuity as-
sumption ensures that t is Ft-predictable
In the literature h and  are usually referred to as exciting function
and rate function respectively
Let Zt P0j t ht j where j is the jth arrival time of the process
for j  1 Thus we can write t  Zt
This is known as the nonlinear Hawkes process see Bremaud and Mas-
soulie 3 When the exciting function h is exponential or a sum of expo-
nentials the process is Markovian and we name it a Markovian nonlinear
Hawkes process
When  is linear this is known as the linear Hawkes process which
was introduced in Hawkes 12 If  is linear and h is exponential or a
sum of exponentials the linear Markovian Hawkes process is sometimes
referred to as Markovian self-exciting processes see for example Oakes 20
You can think of the arrival times j as bad events which can be the ar-
rivals of claims in insurance literature or the time of defaults of big rms
in the real world Hawkes process captures both the self-exciting property
and the clustering eect which explains why it has wide applications in cos-
mology ecology epidemiology seismology neuroscience and DNA modeling
For a list of references to these applications see Bordenave and Torrisi 2
Hawkes process has also been applied in nance Empirical comparisons
suggest that Hawkes processes have some of the typical characteristics of a
nancial time series Financial data have been analyzed using Hawkes pro-
cesses Self-exciting processes are used for the calculation of conditional risk
measures such as the value-at-risk Another area of nance where Hawkes
processes have been considered is credit default modeling Hawkes processes
have been proposed as models for the arrival of company defaults in a bond
portfolio For a list of references to the applications in nance see Liniger
18 and Zhu 26
For a short history of Hawkes process we refer to Liniger 18 For a sur-
vey on Hawkes processes and related self-exciting processes Poisson cluster
processes marked point processes etc we refer to Daley and Vere-Jones
When  is linear say z    z then one can use immigration-birth
representation also known as GaltonWatson theory to study it Under
the immigration-birth representation if the immigrants are distributed as
Poisson process with intensity  and each immigrant generates a cluster
whose number of points is denoted by S then Nt is the total number of

See Dembo and Zeitouni 7 for general background regarding large devia-
tions and the applications Also Varadhan 23 has an excellent survey article
on this subject
In a recent paper Zhu 24 studied the limit theorems for a CoxIngersoll
Ross process with Hawkes jumps an extension of the linear Hawkes pro-
cesses Karabash and Zhu 16 obtained to the limit theorems for linear
marked Hawkes processes another extension of the classical Hawkes pro-
cesses
The large deviations result for Ntt   is helpful to study the ruin
probabilities of a risk process when the claims arrivals follow a Hawkes
process Stabile and Torrisi 21 considered risk processes with nonstationary
Hawkes claims arrivals and studied the asymptotic behavior of innite and
nite horizon ruin probabilities under light-tailed conditions on the claims
The corresponding result for heavy-tailed claims was obtained by Zhu 27
In this paper we are interested in Hawkes processes with general nonlinear
 If  is nonlinear then the usual GaltonWatson theory approach no
longer works If the exciting function h is exponential or a sum of exponen-
tials the process is Markovian and there exists a generator of the process
The diculty arises when h is not exponential or a sum of exponentials in
which case the process is non-Markovian Another possible generalization is
to consider h to be random Then we will get a marked point process For
a discussion on marked point processes see Cox and Isham 4
When  is nonlinear Bremaud and Massoulie 3 proves that under
certain conditions there exists a unique stationary version of the nonlinear
Hawkes process and Bremaud and Massoulie 3 also proves the convergence
to equilibrium of a nonstationary version both in distribution and in vari-
In this paper we will prove the large deviation when h is exponential
and  is nonlinear rst Then we will generalize the proof to the case when
h is a sum of exponentials We will use that to recover the result proved in
Bordenave and Torrisi 2 Finally we will prove the result for a special class
of nonlinear  and general h
2 An ergodic lemma
In this section we prove an ergodic theorem for a
class of Markovian processes with jumps more general than the Markovian
nonlinear Hawkes processes
Let Zit Pj t aiebitj  1  i  d where bi  0 ai 6 0 might be
negative and js are the arrivals of the simple point process with intensity
Z1t     Zdt at time t where  Z  R and Z  R1    Rd
is the domain for Z1t     Zdt where Ri  R or R depending on
whether i  1 or 1 where i  1 if ai  0 and i  1 otherwise If we
assume the exciting function to be ht Pd
i1 aiebit then a Markovian
nonlinear Hawkes process is a simple point process with intensity of the form
The generator A for Z1t     Zdt is given by

 z1     zdf z1  a1     zd  ad  f z1     zd
For a reference to generators for Markov processes with jumps see Davis
We want to prove the existence and uniqueness of the invariant probability
measure for Z1t     Zdt Here the invariance is in time

T is ZT starting at Z0  x that is Z x
Next we will prove the uniqueness of the invariant probability measure
It is sucient to prove that for any x y  Zd there exist times T1 T2  0
such that P xT1 and P yT2 are not mutually singular Here P xT 
T   where Z x

Pj T aebTj  To see this let us prove by contradiction If there were
two distinct invariant probability measures 1 and 2 then there exist two
disjoints sets E1 and E2 such that 1  E1  E1 and 2  E2  E2 see for
example Varadhan 22 Now we can choose x1  E1 and x2  E2 So that
P x1T1 and P x2T2 are supported on E1 and E2 respectively for any
T1 T2  0 which implies that P x1T1 and P x2T2 are mutually singular
This leads to a contradiction
Consider the simplest case ht  aebt Let us assume that x  y  0
Conditioning on the event that Z x
t have exactly one jump during
the time interval 0 T  respectively the laws of P xT and P yT have
positive densities on the sets

which implies that P xT and P yT are not mutually singular
Similarly one can show the uniqueness of the invariant probability mea-
sure for the multidimensional case Indeed it is easy to see that for any

   Qe We can easily check the conditions in Echevrra 8 Eg G is

5 Large deviations for linear Hawkes processes An alternative proof
In this section we use our method to recover the result proved in Bordenave
and Torrisi 2 We prove the existence of the limit of logarithmic moment
generating function rst The strategy is to use the tilting method to prove
the lower bound This requires an ergodic lemma which we state as Lemma
9 For the upper bound we can opitimize over a special class of testing
functions for the linear rate with the sum of exponential exciting function
hn Any continuous and integrable h can be approximated by a sequence hn
By a coupling argument we can use that to approximate the upper bound
for the logarithmic moment generating function when the exciting function
is h Finally by a tilting argument for the lower bound and the Gartner
Ellis theorem for the upper bound we can prove the large deviations for the
linear Hawkes processes
then there exists a stationary and ergodic probability measure  for Zt and

In Lemma 9 we assumed that z    z and khkL1

Theorem 12 we assume that z    z since z    z is equivalent to
the case z    z if we change h to h The reason we used z 
  z in Lemma 9 is because we need to use it when we tilt z    z

Proof The StoneWeierstrass theorem says that if X is a compact
Hausdor space and suppose A is a subspace of CX with the following
properties i If f g  A then f  g  A ii 1  A iii If x y  X then
we can nd an f  A such that f x 6 f y then A is dense in CX in L
norm Consider X  R0    0 that is compactied and C0
consists of continuous functions vanishing at  and the constant function 1
By the StoneWeierstrass theorem the linear combination of 1 et e2t
etc is dense in C0 In other words for any continuous function h on
C0 we have
In fact since h  0 we get a0   Thus

Indeed we can approximate ht by the sum of exponentials in L1 norm

n   Thus we can nd a sequence n  0 such that n  0 as n 
by dominated convergence theorem for any   0 R h  hnet dt  0 as
 and R h  hnent dt  0 By dominated convergence theorem again
R h1 ent dt  0 Hence we haveR h hnent dt  0 as n   where
hnent is a sum of exponentials
We will show that hnent converges to h in L as well

Remark 21 The class of nonlinear Hawkes processes with general ex-
citing function h for which we proved the large deviation principle here is
unfortunately a bit too special It works for the rate function like z 
logc  z  for example but does not work for  that has sublinear
power law growth In fact by the coupling argument we used in the proof
of the case of linear  in Theorem 12 we can prove that in the case
when limz
z  0 and  is -Lipshcitz and   c  0  
limn n for     1  log  where  R 0 ht dt and  and n
are the limit of logarithmic moment generating functions when the excit-
ing functions are h and hn respectively and hn  h in L1 For the linear
case since    for     1  log  the coupling argument is good
enough However for the sublinear     for any  and the cou-
pling argument is not enough In fact it will appear in Zhu 25 that under
z  0  is positive increasing -Lipshcitz
the condition that limz
is a level-3 large deviation principle from which we can use the contraction
principle to get the level-1 large deviation principle for Ntt   There-
fore we conjecture that in the sublinear case   limn n for any
and   c  0 and h is positive decreasing and R 0 ht dt   there
 and Ntt   satises the large deviation principle with rate function
Ix  supRx  The advantage of approximating the general case
by the case when h is a sum of exponentials is that n can be evaluated
by an optimization problem which should be computable by some numerical
scheme
