Detecting concentration changes with
cooperative receptors
Received date  Accepted date
Abstract Cells constantly need to monitor the state of the environment to
detect changes and timely respond The detection of concentration changes of
a ligand by a set of receptors can be cast as a problem of hypothesis testing
and the cell viewed as a Neyman-Pearson detector Within this framework
we investigate the role of receptor cooperativity in improving the cells abil-
ity to detect changes We nd that cooperativity decreases the probability of
missing an occurred change This becomes especially benecial when dicult
detections have to be made Concerning the inuence of cooperativity on how
fast a desired detection power is achieved we nd in general that there is an
optimal value at nite levels of cooperation even though easy discrimination
tasks can be performed more rapidly by noncooperative receptors

1 Introduction
The ability to acquire process and stock information is crucial for living
beings Already at the level of a single cell the external environment is chem-
ically sensed and the acquired information is processed to prepare a suitable
response All the steps involved in these processes are permeated with noise

the arrival of the external stimulus through diusion is a stochastic process
and so is the interaction with the receptors The successive biochemical steps
for the signal transduction usually involve a limited amount of proteins so
that uctuations play a prominent role In other words cells need to extract
useful information from noisy inputs through noisy mechanisms a seemingly
daunting task Despite these hurdles cells are able to sense the environment
and make decisions with remarkable precision For a proper investigation of
sensing it is fundamental to precisely characterize it and to assess its per-
formance The rst step towards a quantitative understanding of this issue
was taken by Berg and Purcell in their seminal paper in 1977 6 addressing
the question of how precise can a cell be in determining the concentration
of an external ligand Several studies have followed their line of reasoning
and considered signal to noise ratios as a measure of the quality of sensing

approach within the framework of information theory has been taken in-
vestigating the ability of signaling networks to acquire information about
the environment and transmit it downstream see Ref 7 for a general dis-
cussion 1128 for recent reviews and 101316 29 31353945525455

been studied see eg

tative comparison with its costs 34519202126 27 30333637404143
444957 This contributes to the understanding of the trade-os which un-
der evolutionary pressure may have shaped the signaling and transcriptional
strategies which are presently observed
Here we focus on a dierent task rather than precisely inferring the value
of an external concentration cells have to eciently detect changes from a
reference level Such systems include for instance the ones involved in en-
forcing homeostasis which must monitor deviations from the physiological
conditions the early stages of the immune response with the detection of
an antigen and more generally signaling pathways downstream of receptors
that undergo adaptation to the external stimuli The problem of detecting
a change can be cast in terms of hypothesis testing Namely one tests the
hypothesis that a change has occurred vs the null one This problem has
been thoroughly studied in Ref 47 where it has been shown how the oc-
cupation history of a single receptor can be used to perform a sequential
probability ratio test In such dynamic formulation they derived how quickly
a decision between two hypotheses can be made given an error threshold To
carry out a statistical test exploiting the history of a receptor cells need to
devise molecular strategies to record it and analyze it Refs 2547 suggested
some possible mechanisms to encode statistical analysis in the level of some
readout molecules which can be used to make decisions At variance with this
approach which focuses on sequential testing and considers a single receptor
here we study the case of parallel testing through the instantaneous occupa-
tion state of a large pool of independent receptors This static approach no
longer requires the presence of additional molecular layers as the receptors
state at a given time can be used directly as a readout As a shortcoming
restricting to the instantaneous receptors occupation provides a less powerful
test than the one exploiting the full receptor history
We then view the cell as a Neyman-Pearson detector which compares
the likelihood of the observed receptor occupancy distribution under the
two hypotheses the environment has not changed vs a change occurred
Within this framework we quantify the detection performance in terms of
the probability of missing the detection of a change
The specic question that we address is whether cooperativity between
the binding sites of a given receptor can be benecial for eectively detecting
changes We nd that cooperativity indeed increases the detection sensitiv-
ity making it the preferable mechanism when dicult detections have to be
performed When considering the time needed to achieve a certain statistical
power we unveil a trade-o which results in an optimal nite level of coopera-
tivity which depends on the required sensitivity and on the number of binding
sites present in each receptor In summary we nd that easy detections are
often achieved more rapidly by receptors with low levels of cooperativity or
even noncooperative binding sites whereas for dicult discrimination tasks
a high cooperativity is mandatory
2 Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing for concentration
discrimination
To illustrate the main ideas of our approach let us start with a simple ex-
ample Consider the case in which a cell has to determine whether the con-
centration of a given ligand has changed or not by means of the occupation
state of its receptors Such problem can be addressed in terms of testing
the null hypothesis that no change occurred vs the alternative one that the
concentration has changed For the sake of simplicity let us restrict to the
specic case in which the concentration has been constant for a long time
and the change is an instantaneous switch from a value c to ccid48 taking place
at time t  0 If a cell is equipped with N cid29 1 independent receptors each
with L dierent binding sites see gure 1 the state of the system at a
given time is specied by L  l1 l2    lN where each ln  0 1    L denotes
the number of occupied binding sites in receptor n Since the receptors are
independent we have that L is a collection of N independent identically dis-
tributed variables drawn from the probability of the occupation number of a
single receptor ptl Inferring if the concentration of the external ligand has
changed corresponds to choosing between two hypothesis

where pc
eql is the equilibrium probability of a receptor having l occupied
binding sites when the concentration is c and pccid48
t l is the time dependent one
for a system that started in equilibrium with c but for which the concentration
switched to ccid48 at t  0 Neyman-Pearson lemma ensures that for a given
signicance  probability of mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis when

The divergence and consequently the test sensitivity changes with time see
g 2 At the very beginning the two distributions are equal and discrim-
ination is therefore impossible For short times the likelihoods of the two
hypotheses are still very similar and the Kullback-Leibler divergence grows
quadratically in time due to probability conservation there is no linear con-
tribution For long times the probability of the alternate hypothesis ap-
proaches the equilibrium value limt pccid48

3 Pauling model of cooperative receptors
Let us now take a closer look at the probability distribution of the occupation
level of an individual receptor and study its dependence on the external
concentration We consider each receptor to consist of L binding sites and its
read-out to be given by its number of occupied binding sites l  0 1    L
To investigate the role of cooperativity we choose the Pauling model in which
each binding site of the receptor interacts with all the other ones 38 A given
binding site i  1    L can be occupied i  0 1 with a probability that
depends on the external concentration of the ligand on its binding energy
and through cooperativity on the number of other sites of the receptor
which are bound The system can be described in terms of an Ising model
with Hamiltonian

where for the sake of simplicity we have encoded in h both the contribution
of the binding energy and the one of the chemical potential which is aected
by the ligand concentration

where Kd is the dissociation constant for the noncooperative receptor and
we have set kBT to unity for the rest of the paper We refer to 38 for a
detailed connection between the statistical mechanical and the chemical de-
scription of the systems Notice that in this system cooperativity is encoded
in the fact that the probability of binding increases with the number of bound
sites Such cooperativity grows with the number of interacting binding sites
and with the coupling parameter J Setting J  0 corresponds to consider-
ing the noncooperative case of independent binding sites The energy of a
conguration depends only on the occupation number l cid80L

The cooperativity of the system allows to have sharp changes in the occupa-
tion probability as the external concentration is varied The system is then
said to be ultrasensitive around the value of the external eld for which half
of the binding sites are bound on average h12 which we refer to as the tran-
sition point Such value depends on the number of total binding sites L and

To proceed to a meaningful comparison between dierent cooperativities
we need to consider systems that have to detect changes of the same rel-
ative amplitude cc12 In general cooperative receptors with dierent num-
bers of binding sites or cooperative strengths can set their transition point
at the same concentration by tuning their dissociation constant This is a
simple mechanism that implements sensorial adaptation Indeed by letting

around a given concentration the receptor has to compensate for a higher co-
operativity by evolving towards a higher dissociation constant lower anity

31 Cooperativity and discrimination
As discussed above around the transition point the distribution of the occu-
pation number of the receptor exhibits a stronger dependence on concentra-
tion as cooperativity is increased Such sharper dependence makes it easier
to tell if the concentration has changed from the reference value set at the
transition point Intuitively then cooperativity improves the discrimination
ability of the receptor To check this intuition let us consider the behavior
of the Kullback-Leibler distance between the equilibrium probability at the
transition point and the one of a dierent concentration and its dependence
on the degree of cooperativity see gure 3 We start by considering the
asymptotic value of the divergence which corresponds to the largest possible
discrimination Due to Steins lemma the Kullback-Leibler divergence de-
scribes how the probability of missing a change in concentration decreases
with the number of independent measurements N in the limit N   For
instance to achieve a miss probability  cid39 5 we need a divergence between
the two distributions of

For a given number of independent receptors N the Kullback-Leibler diver-
gence then sets the miss probability

The full purple line is the divergence in the limit of innite coupling J  
discussed in eq 17 and the full blue one is the noncooperative case J  0
discussed in eq 15 The shaded blue area depicts the values of precision reachable
with noncooperative binding sites the purple shaded one the values achievable by
cooperative receptors The white area above the purple line refers to precisions
which cannot be reached for the given number of binding sites The cyan points are
numerically evaluated results for J  3 already approaching the innite coupling
limit The red points refer to the case with J  1 and the green ones to J  05
Let us start by considering the noncooperative case J  0 The system
then simplies greatly and is just a collection of L independent two states

In the limit of large coupling J   we can roughly estimate the occupa-
tion probability by inspecting equation 9 around h12  JL  12 and
observing that only states with l  0 and l  L will have a nite probability
which for L  1 is larger than its noncooperative equivalent Hence for a
xed L having a cooperative receptor allows to reach values of the Kullback-
Leibler that cannot be approached by means of noncooperative binding
sites resulting in higher detection sensitivities However the limit in eq 17
cannot be exceeded and this sets an upper bound on the performance of a
cooperative receptor following Pauling model
311 Small concentration change limit
The hypotheses we are testing have probability distributions that dier be-
cause of the parameter c and ccid48 Obviously when the two concentrations
are equal the Kullback-Leibler divergence is zero and is at a minimum since
it is non-negative by denition Then for small concentration dierences
cc cid28 1 the divergence is quadratic in the concentration dierence It is
known that curvature of the divergence in c  ccid48 is equal to the Fisher infor-
mation of the probability distribution with respect to the parameter c which
is dened as

Then by Taylor expansion the Kullback-Leibler for small concentration
changes around c reads

The strongly cooperative case displays a quadratic dependence on the num-
ber of binding sites as opposed to the linear one of the noncooperative model
The miss probability of the test then decreases exponentially with L2N for
the cooperative case and simply as LN for the noncooperative one For nite
couplings the variance has to be computed directly from the distribution and

and the magnetization variance for ferromagnetic systems
Fig 4 Hill coecient as a function of binding sites per receptor L for dierent
values of the coupling J For the noncooperative case the Hill coecient is 1 whereas
it is L in the limit of strong cooperativity The parameters and color code are the
same as for gure 3
We can then write

As we have seen in eq 19 for small concentration changes the Kullback-
Leibler divergence is proportional to the Fisher information which for the
system we are considering is itself proportional to the variance of the dis-
tribution I  varlc2 Hence for small concentration changes around the
transition point we have that

linking the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hill coecient The Hill co-
ecient ranges from 1 for noncooperative binding to a maximum of L ap-
proached in the limit of innite cooperativity see g 4 This oers some
insight on the scaling behavior of the Kullback-Leibler divergence for nite
couplings Indeed for small concentration changes the Kullback-Leibler di-
vergence scales as LnH where nH is the Hill coecient of the receptor
32 How long does it take to detect a change
From gure 2 we know that at the moment in which the concentration
changes it is not possible yet to detect the change as the distributions of
NoncooperativeCooperative2345678L2468nh12
the two hypotheses are still equal Detection becomes possible as the like-
lihood of the alternative hypothesis evolves in time We are interested in
studying how long it takes before the distributions of the two hypotheses
are dierent enough to allow a detection with a given sensitivity In order to
do so let us now consider the kinetic behavior of a receptor whose binding
sites follow the Pauling model In general the occupation probability evolves
according to a master equation

There is freedom in how to choose the individual rates still satisfying detailed
balance We consider the case in which the rates are exponential in the energy
dierence associated with the transition and to make contact with the non-
cooperative binding we set them to
kl  l  1  L  lku
kl  l  1  l kue J
2 l L1
c12J L
2 l L1
where ku is the unbinding rate for noncooperative binding sites We can
then proceed to the numerical solution of the master equation and obtain
the time evolution of the system We shall focus on the case in which the
system starts in equilibrium with the concentration at the transition point
c12 and the concentration is switched to a dierent value ccid48 The most re-
markable feature is that for xed ccid48c12 as cooperativity is increased both
by having more binding sites or by a higher coupling J the system slows
down The slowing down is more severe for small concentration changes
This phenomenon is related to the critical slowing down discussed also in
Ref 48 and is due to the fact that a system with strong interactions is
locked into a conguration due to cooperativity and reacts more slowly to
a change in the external eld
Let us now investigate how this impacts on the time required by the pool
of receptors to reach a certain detection sensitivity We need to consider the
dynamic behavior of the Kullback-Leibler divergence during equilibration to
the new concentration ccid48 and how rapidly it manages to reach the threshold
associated with the desired sensitivity as sketched in gure 2 As we have
Fig 5 Time needed to achieve a desired sensitivity in detecting a concentration
change to ccid48  09  c12 for dierent numbers of binding sites and cooperativity
pccid48
This corresponds to time needed by the Kullback Leibler divergence DKLp
to cross a given threshold a miss probability of 5 which for N  1000 recep-
tors corresponds to DKL  0003 For J  081 the receptor with L  2 binding
sites cannot reach a divergence of 0003 For L  3 the shortest time is obtained
at nite coupling whereas for L  5  8 for the noncooperative case Notice the
exponential slowing down observed for L  8 b miss probability of 01 corre-
sponding for N  1000 receptors to DKL cid39 00069 Now the required sensitivity is
unattainable with L  2 binding sites It requires a coupling J  137 for L  3
and a weak J  01 for L  5 For the shown number of binding sites the desired
precision is fastest reached for nite level of cooperativity Time is expressed in

ccid48c12
discussed in the previous section and shown in gure 3 the divergence be-
tween the equilibrium distribution in c12 and in ccid48 is higher for cooperative
receptors consequently allowing to reach levels of sensitivity which are unfea-
sible for noncooperative binding sites However a larger cooperativity slows
down the dynamics When considering how fast a certain level is reached we
are then facing a trade-o as shown in gure 5

To obtain some insight let us study a specic example Consider for in-
stance the case in which we have N  1000 receptors the concentration
decreases of about 10 from its transition value ccid48  09  c12 and we want
to achieve a miss probability of  cid39 5 This sets the Kullback Leibler dis-
tance between the equilibrium receptor distribution at the transition point
and the evolving one at DKLp
t   0003 From eq 15 we know that
such sensitivity cannot be achieved by a receptor with 2 binding sites unless
they operate in a cooperative fashion Then for small couplings a receptor
with 2 binding sites will never reach the threshold As the coupling is in-
creased the threshold becomes attainable and it progressively takes shorter
times to approach it until an optimal value is reached When several binding
sites can be employed the situation is quite the opposite as the threshold is
largely exceeded also in the noncooperative case so that the main eect of
cooperativity is the exponential slowing down of the dynamics In such case
the required sensitivity is reached earlier by noncooperative binding sites
For intermediate scenarios as for example with 3 binding sites the nonco-
operative case is sucient to cross the threshold but its asymptotic value is
not much larger Then a weak cooperativity is slightly faster as a result of
the trade-o between a higher equilibrium limit and slower overall dynamics
The representative cases of L  2 3 5  8 are plotted in gure 5 Let us study
how requiring a higher sensitivity with a miss probability as low as  cid39 01
impacts the trade-o We rst notice that such low miss probability is not
achievable if each receptor has only 2 binding sites since N  1000 noncoop-
erative such receptors can at most reach a miss probability of  cid39 07 For
L  3 5 the required sensitivity can be attained only by cooperative recep-
tors and it is most rapidly reached for intermediate coupling values Finally
employing 8 binding sites cooperativity is no longer necessary to reach the
threshold However a small coupling J cid39 014 allows to cross the desired
value at slightly shorter times
In general considering how cooperativity aects the time need for a sensi-
tive detection we can identify three main classes which are determined by the
level of desired sensitivity and the number of available binding sites Namely
what matters is how large the long-time asymptotic discrimination power
of the noncooperative receptors eq 15 is compared to the one we want
to obtain If the required sensitivity is easily achievable by noncooperative
receptors threshold much lower than the equilibrium value for the noncoop-
erative receptors cooperativity is detrimental for a rapid decision see eg
the case of L  8 binding sites and   5 depicted in cyan in gure 5a
For more sensitive detections which are barely attainable by noncoopera-
tive binding sites a small degree of cooperativity can slightly speed up the
system as shown for instance for L  3 and   5 in blue in gure 5a For
hard detections desired sensitivity higher than the one provided by nonco-
operative receptors the system must be cooperative There is a large but
nite coupling minimizing the time needed to achieved the threshold as re-
ported for L  3 and L  5 for a miss probability of   01 in gure 5b
respectively blue and green line
So far we have considered the time needed to reach a certain level of
precision as a function of the coupling intensity J for the case in which the
reference concentration is set at the transition point c  c12 This is the value

with L  3 and the bottom ones to L  5 For each value the concentration
change to be detected is such that ccid48c  09 corresponding to h  01 Time is

for which the system is most sensitive to concentration changes In order to
extend our reasonings to cases in which the system is not optimally tuned let
us consider how the detection time depends on the reference concentration
or equivalently on the dissociation constant The results are reported in
g 6 For each level of concentration it is possible to determine the range
of cooperativity that allows for a given sensitivity and the coupling intensity
J that reaches it in the shortest time The fastest detections are achieved
for combinations of concentration and coupling such that the system is close
to the transition point but higher concentrations are favored This reects

the fact that the concentration change has to be within the dynamic range
of the receptor and that higher concentrations imply a faster ligand binding
consequently accelerating the dynamics
33 Non-homogeneous coupling strength and ligand anity across the
receptors
In the previous sections we have considered the case in which each receptor
has the same coupling strength and ligand anity In general it is possible
that dierent receptors have dierent J and Kd Let us consider the case in
which the J and Kd of each receptor are drawn from a distribution J Kd
If the number of receptors N is large enough so that each value of the pair
J Kd is sampled several times we can still exploit Steins lemma for each
receptors subpopulation The overall miss probability is then an average over
the dierent receptors subpopulations reading

As a specic example consider the case where the receptors are a mixture
of two dierent subpopulations characterized by two dierent couplings Jw
2 L1 so that the
and Js with the respective Kd tuned as KdJ  K 0
transition point is for both populations at c12  K 0
Let us denote the probability of drawing the strongly cooperative Js
receptor as q so that we have on average N q strongly cooperative receptors
The miss probability then obeys

resulting in a linear combination of the two Kullback-Leibler divergences By
varying the parameter q from 0 to 1 the curve smoothly varies between the
weakly and the strongly cooperative cases In general such mixture of recep-
tors displays a faster initial response compared to the strongly cooperative
case and a higher asymptotic precision with respect to the weakly cooperative
case see g 7 This allows for intermediate behaviors which can be tuned
to satisfy dierent requirements by changing the sizes of the subpopulations
4 Conclusions and discussion
We have studied the problem of detecting a change in concentration of a
ligand by means of a pool of receptors To investigate the detection perfor-
mance we have addressed the problem in terms of hypothesis testing making
use of the instantaneous occupancy We have focused on the probability of
missing the detection of a change that actually occurred and employed it as
a measure of the quality of the sensing system With this formalism we have
considered the inuence of cooperativity on the sensing performance We
Fig 7 In the case of non-homogeneous coupling strength across the receptors the
miss probability is given by a linear combination of the various couplings The plot
refers to the case in which a receptor is cooperative with J  1 with probability
q  12 and is noncooperative with probability 1  q  12 with L  3 and

have identied a twofold eect of cooperativity a markedly improved sensi-
tivity in the long time limit and a signicant slowing down of the receptors
dynamics This is consistent with the ndings of Ref 48 in which the sensing
performance of locally cooperative receptors was considered in terms of the
precision with which they are able to determine a concentration change by
time averaging their history We stress here that both the higher asymptotic
sensitivity and the slowing down are separately relevant Most notably coop-
erativity enables to detect changes with sensitivities that are not attainable
by noncooperative receptors When considering the time from the concentra-
tion change needed before the instantaneous receptor occupancy state can
provide a given detection sensitivity the two eects of cooperativity trade
o In the framework adopted by the authors of 48 the eect of the slow-
down due to cooperativity on the time averaging procedure dominates the
additional sensitivity and the authors concluded that noncooperative recep-
tors perform better than cooperative ones On the contrary we have seen
that casting the detection problem in terms of hypothesis testing by means
of the instantaneous occupancy of a pool of receptors cooperativity can be
benecial We have found that there is an optimal degree of cooperativity
which depends on the required sensitivity level and on the number of binding

sites present in each receptor At given number of binding sites we can iden-
tify three general scenarios depending on the required detection power For
hard detections the system must be cooperative and the desired sensitivity
is reached earlier at nite but large levels of cooperativity For intermediate
cases the system can achieve the needed statistical power by noncooperative
binding sites but moderately cooperative receptors are faster at approaching
it Easy detections are performed more rapidly by noncooperative receptors
It is interesting to consider how the cells detection ability scales with the
numbers of receptors and binding sites For noncooperative binding sites the
probability of missing the detection decreases exponentially with the total
number of binding sites present in all the receptors N L We have shown
that for cooperative receptors in the long-time limit the exponential decrease
is more marked and in the innite coupling limit for small concentration
changes depends quadratically on the number of binding sites present in
each receptor N L2 Since it is costly to produce proteins see Refs15 19
sensing mechanisms that improve the performances without increasing the
number of required components may represent an advantage The dierent
scaling in N and L can then impact on how to invest the limited resources
favoring either solutions involving few receptors with many binding sites or
the opposite The characterisation of the ensuing trade-os is an issue that
surely deserves further study in the near future
