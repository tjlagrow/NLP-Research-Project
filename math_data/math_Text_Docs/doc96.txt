We study the evolution of a ve-dimensional rotating black hole emitting scalar eld
radiation via the Hawking process for arbitrary initial values of the two rotation parameters
a and b It is found that any such black hole whose initial rotation parameters are both
nonzero evolves toward an asymptotic state aM 12  bM 12  const6 0 where this
constant is independent of the initial values of a and b
The conventional view of black hole evaporation is that regardless of its initial
state Hawking radiation will cause a black hole to approach an uncharged zero
angular momentum state long before all its mass has been lost For this reason in
some works it is assumed that as a black hole evaporates close to the Planck scale
where quantum gravity is required to determine its evolution the nal asymptotic
state is described by Schwarzschild solution
However Chambers Hiscock and Taylor1 investigated in some detail the evo-
lution of a Kerr black hole emitting scalar eld radiation via the Hawking process
and showed that the ratio of the black holes specic angular momentum to its mass
a  aM  evolves toward a stable nonzero value a  0555 This means that a
rotating black hole will evolve toward a nal state with non-zero angular momentum
if there is a scalar eld In this Letter we shall extend the analysis of Chambers
Hiscock and Taylor to a higher-dimensional case for the reasons described below
Considering the ve-dimensional case specically we investigate the evolution of a
ve-dimensional rotating Myers-Perry MP black hole2 with two rotation parame-
ters through scalar eld radiation
Recently black holes in N  4 dimensions have attracted much attention This
is due to interest in the brane world scenario3 4 From a phenomenological point
of view the most exciting possibility for the brane world scenario is that it might be
possible to produce higher-dimensional mini-black holes in particle colliders such as
the CERN Large Hadron Collider LHC or to nd them in cosmic ray events5 A
black hole produced in this manner would evaporate rapidly and emit many stan-

dard particles Hence it would lese most of its mass and angular momenta through
Hawking radiation6 or superradiance which is intrinsic to a rotating or charged
black hole7 8 A few hot quanta emitted in the nal Planck phase which cannot be
treated semiclassically would not consist of the main part of the decay products9
In most of the literature the spin-down phase of black hole evolution in which a
black hole loses its angular momenta is simply ignored and a Schwarzschild black
hole is assumed
In generic particle collisions however the impact parameter will be non-zero
Therefore most black holes produced in a collider would be rotating and could be
described by a higher-dimensional MP solution2 or other rotating objects such as a
black ring10 For this reason we focus on a spin-down phase through scalar eld
radiation A ve-dimensional rotating black hole possesses three Killing vectors t
 and  Therefore a ve-dimensional black hole has two rotation parameters
For a ve-dimensional MP black hole with one rotation parameter Ida Oda and
Park11 found the formulae for the black body factor in a low-frequency expansion
and the power spectra of the Hawking radiation However if a brane is not innitely
thin but rather has a thickness in the order of a fundamental scale  TeV we
expect to exist a second component of angular momentum We therefore study the
case of two rotation parameters Frolov and Stojkovic rst derived expressions for
the energy and angular momentum uxes from a ve-dimensional rotating black
hole with two rotation parameters12
In this work we numerically evaluated the
quantum radiation from a ve-dimensional rotating black hole with two rotation
parameters a and b which we assume to be positive without loss of generality We
found that such a black hole evolves toward an asymptotic state characterized by a
stable values a  b  01975 8M312  where M is the mass of the black hole We
also show that the asymptotic state can be described by a  01183 8M312 and
b  0 if one of the initial rotation parameters is exactly zero
We start with the quantum radiation of a massless scalar eld  which is min-
imally coupled for a ve-dimensional MP black hole with two rotation parame-
ters12 see also Ref 13 for details To quantize the scalar eld we expand it
as   Rreimeineit For the vacuum state we adopt the past Unruh
vacuum state U i which mimics the state of collapse of a star to a black hole7
Calculating the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of the
scalar eld we can evaluate the emission rates of the total energy and angular mo-
menta which give the changes of the black hole mass M and angular momenta J
and J as

2M r l is the eigenvalue of the
angular function  and lmn is the greybody factor which is identical to the
absorption probability of the incoming wave of the corresponding mode The values
r and r represent the event horizon and the inner horizon of the black hole
respectively The quantities   ar2

angular velocities at the horizon r The superradiance modes are given by the
condition 0    m  n From this condition we nd the interesting feature
that a counter-rotating particle can be created by superradiance ie

Using the above formula for the quantum creation of a scalar eld we investigate
the evolution of a ve-dimensional MP black hole with two rotation parameters
From the condition for the existence of horizons we obtain the condition a  b  rs

to the gravitational mass M of the black hole as r2

As shown by Page14 it is convenient to introduce scale invariant rates of change
for the mass and angular momenta of an evaporating black hole as
f  r2

where a  ars and b  brs In terms of the scale invariant functions f  ga and
gb the time evolution equations for a and b are given by
where the dimensionless functions ha and hb are dened as
d ln a
2 cid18 ga

d ln b

We now discuss the evolution of a and b as determined through the numerical
evaluation of f  ga and gb Henceforth we use units such that rs  1
dynamical system 5 a xed point plays an important role It is dened by ha  0
and hb  0 Note that f is positive denite
If ha hb is positive then a b
decreases while if ha hb negative then a b increases Because ha hb depends
not only on a b but also on b a ha  0 hb  0 gives a curve in the a-
b plane Since there is symmetry between a and b the xed point should be
symmetrical too
We rst discuss the behavior of the mass and angular momentum loss rates in
the case a  b and hence a  b Fig 1 displays the mass loss rate f a in terms
of a  b The mass loss rate through the scalar radiation is more eective at
smaller values of a We depict the angular momentum loss rate gaa  gba

the function haa  haa in Fig 3 We nd haa  0 at a  acr

which a  b  1 is forbidden because
there is no horizon the black region in Figs 4 and 5 In Fig 4 there are two bright
regions one for large a and small b and one for small a and large b where f
becomes large This means that the creation rate is high in these regions In Fig
5 there is only one bright region for large a and small b Therefore the angular
momentum J is emitted eectively only in this region This is the superradiance
eect For the angular momentum J if b is large we nd eective emission This
means that the superradiance modes give a dominant contribution to the particle
creation
There is one interesting observation here If the two rotation parameters are
equal ie a  b the emission rates are suppressed even if the black hole is in

seems to happen and the system behaves like a spherically symmetric black hole
In fact the angular equation for  in this case is exactly the same as that for
the Schwarzschild black hole12 This may suppress the superradiance eect This is
consistent with the result given in Ref 15 the eciency of energy extraction for a
MP black hole is very small in the case that the rotation parameters are equal
Fig 6 The vector eld describes the direc-
tion in which a and b evolve ie  a b
For any initial values of a and b the sys-
tem evolves toward a  b  01975 the
black spot which is a stable xed point
The shaded region is forbidden
In order to see the evolution of a
black hole in the a-b plane we plot
the vector eld  a b with arrows in
Fig 6 From this gure we see how the
values of a and b evolve toward the
xed point We can also prove that the
xed point is a stable attractor see Ref
13 for details
In Fig 6 the arrows far from the
symmetry line of a  b are very large
Then if the initial value of a b is
large while that of b a is small a
and b rst approach the same value
Near the xed point acr
 the ar-
rows are very small which means that
the evolution toward the xed point is
slow We thus nd that after reaching a
state with a  b a and b eventually
evolve together toward the xed point

non-zero rotation parameters will evolve toward a nal state with the same specic
angular momenta a  b  acr
  01975 For a black hole with only one non-
trivial rotation parameter ie a 6 0 and b  0 exactly we obtain the stable xed
point from the equation haa 0  0 which yields a  01183
Finally consider the evaporation time of the black hole In the above analysis we
showed that our dynamical system 5 has one stable attractor which can be reached
through quantum particle production However the black hole may evaporate away
before this xed point is reached Whether this happens depends on the evaporation
time and the evolution time in the a-b plane We can evaluate the evaporation
time scale M using the emission rate of the black hole mass as M  M M  and
we can evaluate the evolution time scale a using the evolution equation 5 as
a  a a
We thus nd that M a  8ha3  O1 However this does not mean
that the black hole will evaporate away before reaching the xed point
integrated evaporation time which depends on the initial mass of the black hole
is much longer than the evolution time we have enough time to realize the nal
state described by the xed point Therefore we conclude that if a black hole has a
mass that is larger than the fundamental Planck mass scale its two specic angular
momenta will eventually become equal when it evaporates away
