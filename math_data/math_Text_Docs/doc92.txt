1 INTRODUCTION
11 Introduction
It has been a long-standing challege for theoretical physics to construct a
theory of quantum gravity String theory is the leading candidate for a quantum
theory of gravity General Relativity has the seeds of its own destruction in it
since smooth initial data can evolve into singular eld congurations 1 Classi-
cally this is not a problem if the singularities are hidden behind event horizons
2 since this means that nothing can come out from the region containing the
singularity However Hawking showed under very general assumptions that
quantum mechanics implies that black holes emit particles 3 In his approxima-
tion this radiation is exactly thermal and contains no information about the state
of the black hole This leads to the problem of information loss since particles
can fall in carrying information but what comes out is featureless thermal radia-
tion 4 Hawking argued that this would lead to non-unitary evolution so that
one of the basic principles of quantum mechanics would have to be modied
Black holes are thermal systems that obey the laws of thermodynamics 5
In fact they have an entropy proportional to the area of the event horizon The
area of the horizon is just a property of the classical solution it always increases
in classical processes like the collision of two black holes In most physical systems
the thermodynamic entropy has a statistical interpretation in terms of counting
microscopic congurations with the same macroscopic properties and in most
cases this counting requires an understanding of the quantum degrees of freedom
of the system For black holes this has been a long-standing puzzle what are
the degrees of freedom that the Hawking-Beckenstein entropy is counting
String theory being a theory of quantum gravity 6 should be able to de-
scribe black holes Diculties were very soon encountered because black holes
involve strong coupling and therefore one will have to go beyond simple perturba-
tive string theory to describe them Recently there has been remarkable progress
in understanding some string solitons called D-branes 789 They account
for some non-perturbative eects in string theory and they have a very simple
description
Charged black holes in General Relativity are characterized by their mass
M and charge Q The condition that the singularity is hidden behind a horizon
implies that M  Q The case of M  Q is called extremal 10 These black
holes have smooth geometries at the horizon and a free-falling observer would
not feel anything as he falls through the horizon The horizon area and thus the
entropy are nonzero both for the extremal and non-extremal cases The Hawk-
ing temperature vanishes for the extremal case and it increases as we increase
the mass moving away from extremality keeping Q xed For very large mass
it decreases again
We will be considering black holes in a theory called N8 supergravity 11
that is not precisely usual General Relativity but that is very similar for the
kind of problems we are interested in The dierence with General Relativity is
that it contains many extra massless elds U1 gauge elds scalar elds and
various fermionic elds Despite this dierent eld content there is a charged
black hole solution that is exactly like the one in General Relativity the metric
is exactly the same there is only one gauge eld excited which is a particular
combination of the original ones and the rest of the elds including the scalars
are all zero This implies as in General Relativity that the geometry at the
horizon is smooth N  8 supergravity in four dimensions is the low energy
limit of type II string theory compactied on a six-torus T 6 String theory con-
tains D-brane solitons that are extended membranes of various possible spatial
dimensions 8 9 When these extended branes are wrapped around the com-
pact directions they appear to the four-dimensional observer as localized objects
as charged particles There is a symmetry called U-duality that interchanges
all these objects 12 Superimposing many of these objects of dierent dimen-
sions we obtain a string soliton that has many of the properties of a black hole
131415161718192021 There is a large degeneracy which gives
a statistical interpretation to the thermodynamic entropy One great virtue of
considering this supergravity theory is that the extremal black holes become su-
persymmetric congurations so that certain quantities can be calculated at weak
coupling and are then valid for all values of the coupling This has been the key
to providing a precise calculation of extremal black hole entropy The entropy
calculated using the D-brane method agrees precisely including the numerical
coecient with the classical Hawking-Beckenstein area law 13151920
The near-extremal black holes can also be considered from this point of view and
they correspond to excited states of the solitons These excited states result from
attaching open strings to the D-branes 78 Hawking radiation is described by
open strings colliding and forming a closed string that leaves the soliton 14
Doing an average over the initial state of the black hole we get thermal Hawking
radiation with the correct value for the temperature and the radiation rate is
proportional to the area of the black hole 14 These near-extremal calculations
stand on a more shaky ground since one does not have supersymmetry to pro-
tect the calculations from strong coupling problems The successful calculation
of the entropy gives evidence in favor of the proposed physical picture Unfortu-
nately these uncontrolled approximations for the near-extremal case will prevent
us from saying anything about the information loss problem but deeper analysis
of this model might lead to an answer to this elusive problem
In the rest of this chapter we review some general facts about string theory
and we introduce the string solitons called D-branes In chapter 2 we describe
the classical black hole supergravity solutions Using some string theory infor-
mation about the quantization and nature of the various charges we rewrite the
entropy formulas in a very suggestive form in terms of basic constituents
chapter 3 we will show how to derive these entropy formulas for the extremal
case and then consider near-extremal black holes suggesting a physical picture
for black holes in terms of D-branes We conclude with a discussion on the
results
12 Perturbative string theory
String theory is a quantum theory of interacting relativistic strings Much of
what we can presently do involves treating this interaction in perturbation theory
6 But before we say anything about interactions let us review some properties
of free string theory We will be considering the theory of closed oriented strings
The free string action is
4 Z d2cid2X X   6cid3
2
where T  1
is the string tension We also have to impose the additional
constraint that the two dimensional supercurrent and stress tensor associated
to 11 vanish 22
In this fashion the bosonic part of the action which in-
volves the ten spacetime coordinates X  is just proportional to the area of the
worldsheet embedded in ten dimensional space The string contains fermionic
degrees of freedom living on the worldsheet  Depending on the boundary
conditions of the fermions when they go around the loop there are four sectors
which correspond to whether the left and right moving fermions are periodic
or anti periodic as we go around the loop The spacetime bosons come from
the sectors where the boundary conditions for the fermions are the same both
for left and right moving strings They are the NSNS and the RR sectors
NS stands for Neveu-Schwarz and R for Ramond The NSNS sector contains
massless elds corresponding to a graviton a two form or antisymmetric tensor
B and a scalar the dilaton  The RR sector contains antisymmetric tensor
elds of various number of indices ie p  1 forms Ap1
Spacetime symmetries correspond to symmetries in the worldsheet conformal
eld theory In some cases the symmetry comes from a primary eld conserved
current This is the case for translations and for supersymmetry transformations
The translations are associated to the primary elds X  and the supersymme-
tries to the fermion vertex operators at zero momentum Vz This is the
operator that in CFT switches between Ramond and NS sectors as a space-
time supersymmetry should do The left and right moving spinors on the world
sheet can have the same or opposite ten dimensional chiralities giving the IIB
or IIA theory respectively
It will be interesting to consider strings on compact spaces We will concen-
trate on the simplest compactication which is called toroidal and is obtained by
identifying one the coordinates as X 9  X 9  2R 22 In this case the momen-
tum P 9 becomes quantized in units of 1R P 9  nR The string can also wind
along this compact direction so that when we go around the string the coordinate
has to satisfy the condition X 9  X 9  2Rm The two integers n m are the
momentum and winding numbers of the string The Virasoro constraints are
E2  P 2 cid18 n
E2  P 2 cid18 n

where P is the momentum in the directions 1  8 and NLR are the total net
oscillator level of the string2 Combining both equations in 12 we get the level

where P9LR  n
 are the left and right moving momenta in the direction
9 Momentum and winding are conserved and appear as charges in the extended
R  mR
dimensions 0  8 In fact from the 1  8 dimensional point of view they are cen-
tral charges because they appear in the supersymmetry algebra The reason they
appear in the supersymmetry algebra is that they appear in the ten dimensional
algebra as the left and right moving momenta

The supersymmetry algebra implies that P 0   PL P 0   PR These are the
If any of these bounds is saturated we can see
so called Bogomolny bounds
from 14 that some supersymmetries annihilate the state If both bounds are
saturated then we have pure momentum or pure winding NL  NR  0 and
half of the supersymmetries are broken If only one bound let us say the one
involving PR is saturated then NR  0 NL is given by 13 and only 14 of
the supersymmetries are left unbroken
We can see from 12 that the spectrum is left invariant under the change
of R  R This turns out to be a symmetry of the whole string theory also
of the interactions and we expect that it will be valid even non-perturbatively
This very important symmetry of string theory is called T-duality In fact in
order for it to be a symmetry of the interactions also we need to change the
coupling constant together with the radius as 23

The change in the coupling constant is such that the d dimensional Newton
constant stays invariant

Since string theory contains some massless particles separated by a large
mass gap 1 from the massive states of the string it is natural to study the
eective low energy action describing the interacting string theory
It has to
have the symmetries of the theory N2 local supersymmetry in ten dimensions
To lowest order in string perturbation theory and long distances we keep only
second derivative terms this Lagrangian is that of type II ten dimensional super-
gravity It is called type II because we have two supersymmetries Depending on
the relative chirality of the supersymmetry generators we have the type IIA or
IIB theories which are the limits the IIA or IIB string theories Let us start with
the ten dimensional type IIA supergravity action 24 This theory contains the
elds coming from the NSNS sector which are the metric G  a two form B
and a scalar  called the dilaton The elds coming from the RR sector are
a one form A and a three form C It also has the supersymmetic fermionic
partners of all these elds The bosonic part of the action is
N Z d10xGcid20e2R  42 
16G10
H 2  G2 
110F1234 F5678 B910cid21
where G  dA H  dB F  dC and F   dC  2A  H are the eld
strengths associated with each of the dierential forms3 The supersymmetries
are generated by two spinors LR of opposite chirality The gravitational part
3 In components G  2A H  3B F 
  4C8AH
of the action can be put in the standard form S  R gR by dening a new
metric called the Einstein metric by gE  e2G where G is the so called
string metric in 16
The type IIB action contains the same elds coming from the NSNS sector
and it contains therefore the rst three terms in the action 16 The RR elds
are a scalar  or zero form a two form B and and four form A whose
eld strength is self dual F  dA  F  Due to this condition it is not possible
to write a covariant action for the IIB theory however the equations of motion
and the supersymmetry variations are known We can also truncate the theory
setting F  0 and then we have a covariant action for the rest of the elds
Type IIB supergravity 25 has the interesting property that it is S-dual
under changing    and interchanging the two antisymmetric tensor elds
B  B 26 In fact the classical symmetry is SL2R once one includes shifts
in the other scalar  In string theory an SL2Z subgroup of this symmetry is
expected to survive 12 We will later make use of this S-duality symmetry to
generate solutions and relate them to each other This S-duality transformation
leaves the Einstein metric invariant but it changes the string metric This means
in particular that if we have a compactied theory and the radii are measured in
string metric as in 12 then under an S-duality transformation they all change

We will dene throughout this thesis the ten dimensional coupling constant g 
e to be such that it transforms as 17 under S-duality We will see in section
24 that this xes the ten dimensional Newton constant in 16 to be G10
86g24 In compactied theories the S-duality and T-duality groups combine
to form a bigger group called U-duality 12
13 String solitons and D-branes
The low energy supergravity action contains p  1 forms Ap1 coming from
the RR sector p is even in IIA and odd in IIB There are no objects in per-
turbative string theory that carry charge under these elds all vertex operators
involve the eld strength of these forms The objects that would carry charge
under a p  1 form are extended p branes The coupling is
pZVp1
which naturally generalizes the electromagnetic coupling to an electric charge In
addition if we assume that the spectrum of electric p brane charges is quantized
we would expect also magnetic 6  p branes that couple to the Dirac dual
A7p form dened through equations of the type d A7p  dAp1 the details
are slightly more complicated 27
In fact type II supergravities contain extended black p brane solutions which
carry this charge 28 The extremal limit of these p branes saturates the BPS
bound for these charges These solutions will be presented in chapter 2
In string theory these solutions appear as some very special solitons 78
They are extended objects with p spatial dimensions and are called D-branes
Their description is very simple and it amounts to the following denition D-
branes are p-dimensional extended surfaces in spacetime where strings can end A
D-brane is the string theory solution it is described by a CFT whose low energy
limit is a supergravity extremal p brane In type II theory we had only closed
strings in the vacuum In the presence of a D-brane there are also open strings
which interact with the closed strings by usual splitting and joining interactions
22 These D-branes have the peculiar property that their mass tension goes
like 1g and in fact they would lead to non-perturbative eects of order eO1g
Eects of this magnitude were observed in string theory specially in matrix
models 29 They also carry RR charges with the values predicted by U-duality
An open string has a worldsheet that is topologically a strip One has to
specify some boundary conditions on the boundaries of the strip that is at the
end of the string The boundary conditions describing an open string attached
to a p brane sitting at xp1      x9  0 are
X  0
X  0
for   0  p 
for   p  1  9 
These are Neumann boundary conditions on the directions parallel to the brane
and Dirichlet conditions on the directions perpendicular to the brane This
is the reason they are called Dirichlet-branes These open strings have the
characteristic spectrum P 2  4
 Nopen with the momentum P  P 0  P p
being parallel to the brane These open strings represent excitations of the
branes In general an excited brane corresponds to having a gas of these open
strings on the brane Of particular interest to us will be the massless bosonic
open strings those for which Nopen  0 The massless open strings have a vector
index If the index lies in the directions parallel to the brane they describe gauge
elds living on the brane and if the index is perpendicular to the brane they
describe oscillations of the brane in the perpendicular directions As an example
let us take a D-string consider it winding once around the compact direction 9
Note that S-duality interchanges this D-string with a fundamental string 1230
The open strings attached to the D-string can have momentum in the direction
9 which is quantized in units of 1R9 The energy of a D-brane containing a gas
of massless open strings is
i  E0 
NL  NR
For each momentum n we have eight bosonic and eight fermionic modes There
can be a number Nn of strings with momentum n and
NR  Xn0
NL  Xn0
We see that the spectrum is the same as the one we would obtain for a superstring
winding around the 9th direction with tension TD  1
2g if we expand 12 in
powers of R9 Note that the statistics and number of excitations corresponds
precisely with that of the fundamental string In this fashion we can see that the
massless open strings describe oscillations of D-branes Actually for p  1 not
only oscillations but also uctuations in the world-brane gauge elds

FIGURE 2 D-branes winding around a compact direction with open strings attached
Only closed strings exist between widely separated D-branes Open strings
carry UN Chan Paton factors when we have several D-branes
If one considers many D-branes of the same type sitting on top of each other
the open strings carry Chan-Paton indices i j specifying the starting and ending
point of the string 931 The interactions of these massless open strings can be
described by a UN Yang-Mills action Since T-duality transformations change
the dimensionality of D-branes the simplest way to obtain this action is to do a
T-duality transformation into 9-branes lling the space and we have an N1 ten
dimensional YM Lagrangian
4g Z d10xT rFF    fermions 
This Lagrangian describes the low energy limit of open string amplitudes If we
perform T-duality transformations the amplitudes will not change The massless
vertex operators change a little the vertex operators for coordinates with Neu-
mann boundary conditions involve the derivative along the boundary tX while
the ones for coordinates with Dirichlet conditions involve the normal derivative
nX T-duality interchanges the normal and tangential derivative Another dif-
ference is that the momentum perpendicular to the branes vanishes Otherwise
the amplitudes are exactly the same So we conclude that the low energy action
describing the interaction of the massless modes on a D-brane is just the dimen-
sional reduction of 111 to p  1 dimensions So we replace dx10  dp1x the
elds A   0  p are gauge elds on the D-brane and AI  I  p  1  10 are
related to the motion of the D-brane in the transverse dimensions Separating
the branes corresponds to breaking the symmetry down to U1N by giving an
expectation value to the elds AI I  p1  10 These expectation values have
to be commuting diagonal matrices up to gauge transformations the elements
on the diagonal represent the position of the branes 731 In the case of a fun-
damental string we can have many dierent congurations depending on how the
string is wound in the compact direction We could have a single string wound
N times or N strings each winding only once For D-branes we have a similar
situation Dierent windings correspond to dierent boundary conditions along
the compact direction The physics will be dierent depending on how they are
wound For example if we have a single D-string winding Q times all the elds
will satisfy the boundary condition Ax9  2R9  U Ax9U1 where U is
the transformation that cyclically permutes the Chan-Paton indices i  i  1
Now we are interested in nding states of the system corresponding to oscillating
D-strings Naively we might think that Q D-strings have a set of Q2 indepen-
dent massless excitations corresponding to the dierent components of the gauge
eld However we should be more careful because there are interactions so if
we consider for example a conguration with waves along the diagonal Q direc-
tions corresponding to separating the D-strings then the other components of
the gauge eld become massive In other words in the worldbrane gauge theory
there are 8 scalars in the adjoint AI and there is a potential for these scalars
coming from the commutator terms in the YM action V PIJ T rAI AJ 2 In
order to see this more explicitly let us take diagonal matrices
I u v
AI 
I u v
where v u  x9  x0 If we insert this ansatz in the equations of motion we nd
that f m
I obey the massless wave equation Now consider on this background a
small o diagonal component AImn 6 0 where m 6 n are some xed indices
and all other components of A are zero The equation of motion will be of the
4uvAImn  f n
J  f m
J 2AImn  0 
We see that the oscillating background acts like a mass term for this o diagonal
component The eect of this mass term is more clear if we consider purely
left moving excitations Then we see that the maximum number of independent
oscillations is 8Q corresponding to diagonal matrices AI  since the equation
113 cannot be solved with purely left moving excitations if f n
J are arbitrary
In the case that the f n
J contain both left and right moving waves it is reasonable
to assume that for generic fs we are not going to have any resonances and that
o diagonal excitations will be eectively massive
In the case the D-string is multiply wound these diagonal elements f n
cyclically permuted in going around the compact direction f n
I x9  2R9 
x9 so that we could think that the momentum is quantized in units of
1QR9 This correctly reproduces the energy levels of a multiply wound string
NL  NR
The total physical momentum still has to be quantized in units of 1R so P 
NL  NRQR9  NR9 This is the condition analogous to 13 Here we
have assumed that R9 is very big so that we can neglect interactions and massive
open strings
The states with NR  0 are BPS and supersymmetry ensures that 114
is precisely right This conguration is related by S duality to a fundamental
string of winding number Q carrying left moving oscillations We can see that
the degeneracies are precisely the same since we have eight bosonic and fermionic
excitations with momenta quantized in units of 1RQ It was crucial to obtain
the reduction of the independent degrees of freedom from Q2  Q We will see
this mechanism working again for the black hole case
It is quite straightforward to compute the interactions of these open strings
33 the interactions of closed strings and open strings 34 and the scattering of
closed strings from the D-brane 353637 To lowest order in string perturba-
tion theory they reduce to calculations on the disc with vertex insertions at the
boundary associated with open strings and insertions in the interior of the disc
associated to closed string states In this way we can compute the scattering of
closed strings from the D-brane and we indeed nd that in the low energy limit
the stringy amplitudes agree with those calculated purely in the supergravity
p-brane solutions 3634

The second process is the relevant one for Hawking radiation
In the presence of a D-brane it is easy to see how supersymmetries are bro-
ken We said before that the right and left ten dimensional supersymmetries are
generated by the right and left moving spinors on the worldsheet The presence of
a boundary in the world sheet relates the left and right moving spinors through a
boundary condition This is something familiar from open string theories which
have only one supersymmetry in ten dimensions Type I As argued in 369
the boundary condition for the spinors is
SRz  0    pSLzcid12cid12zz 
The two choices of sign in 115 corresponds to opposite D-brane orientations
and therefore opposite D-brane charges Note that in the type IIA theory we
have p even and therefore dierent chiralities for the worldsheet spinors while
for IIB theory we have odd p and the same chirality for both spinors This in
turn translates into the following condition for the parameters that generate the
unbroken supersymmetries in the presence of a p brane
R  0    pL 
s  g which is much smaller than  for small g
Since the BPS p-brane solution is the extremal limit of a black p-brane
we would expect that D-branes provide a quantum description for these black
branes This naive expectation is not quite so because the Schwarschild radius
of a D-brane is of order r7p
So the strings are typically much larger than the black hole radius 9 We might
try to solve this by considering many D-branes in that case the Schwarschild
radius would grow like r7p
s  Qg However in any process we consider there will
be open string loop corrections which will be of order gQ the extra factor of Q
comes from the sum over the Chan Paton index If we compactify the D-brane
to make a black hole we see that the supergravity solution already shows that
there are scalar elds that are blowing up as we approach the horizon this also
indicates that near the brane the strings are not free any more and also that these
black holes are very dierent than the ones we are used to in General Relativity
Of course the size of loop corrections depends on where the Q D-branes are
if they are sitting on top of each other the corrections are big but if they are
separated in space the corrections are small From the point of view of string
theory separating the branes in space means giving an expectation value to the
translational zero modes of the brane which means putting many open strings
on the D-brane
We will show in what follows that there are some properties of black holes
that are correctly described by D-branes But in order to describe those black
holes we need congurations with more than one type of D-branes
If we introduce another type of D-brane we have even more types of open
strings We would like to choose p-brane and p-brane superpositions in such
a way that some supersymmetries are still preserved The additional boundary
will introduce a new condition on the spinors of the type 116 with p  p
We can see that if p  p  4 8 we can have a supersymmetric conguration
preserving 14 of the supersymmetries if the p-brane is parallel to the p-brane
38 Other congurations with non-parallel D-branes can be obtained from this
one by applying T-duality transformations The dierent branes need not be
on top of each other and wherever the branes are we have a supersymmetric
conguration that saturates the BPS bound M  cpQp  cp4Qp4 where cs
If p  p  2 6 then two conditions of the type
are some xed coecients
116 seem to be in conict because they impose chirality conditions that cannot
be satised for real spinors Nevertheless BPS congurations carrying p  2
and p brane charges are predicted by U-duality this basically comes from the
fact that fundamental strings can be bound to D-strings 31 But the BPS
with nonzero binding energy and suggests that we indeed should not be able to
see this conguration as two separate D-branes in equilibrium at weak coupling
If we have Q coinciding D-p-branes there are instanton solutions of the
UQ world-brane-volume gauge theory with dimension p  4 which carry RR
p 4 brane charge In fact the D-p 4-brane corresponds to the zero size limit
of these instantons 38
formula for this case 31 has a dierent structure M  qcpQ2
p  cp2Q2
Intersecting D-brane congurations with p p  1 5 and 2 6 will ap-
pear when we describe ve and four dimensional black holes In these cases the
low energy worldbrane eld theory describing the interactions of the massless
modes is the dimensional reduction of an N  1 theory in six dimensions corre-
sponding to the case p p  9 5 38 In chapter 3 we will study this case in
more detail
2 CLASSICAL BLACK HOLE SOLUTIONS
In general relativity plus electromagnetism there are charged black hole so-
lutions They are the most general spherically symmetric stationary solutions
and are characterized by the charge Q and the mass M  The cosmic censorship
hypothesis 2 which says that gravitational collapse does not lead to naked sin-
gularities implies that in physical situations only M  Q black holes will form
since the solution would otherwise contain a naked singularity The case M  Q
is called extremal since it has the minimum possible mass for a given charge
This charged black holes are given by the Reissner-Nordstrom solution 10

pactied down to d  4 5 dimensions For d  4 this leads to N  8 supergravity
The familiar solution 21 will be indeed one particular case of the black holes
we consider Of course the theory in which it is embedded is dierent but the
metric is the same and the gauge eld will be a particular linear combination of
the ones appearing in N  8 supergravity These black holes can be thought of
as extended membranes wrapping around internal dimensions We will therefore
start by studying the extended brane solutions in ten dimensions In the following
section we will show how to construct oscillating BPS solutions this section could
be skiped in a quick reading Then we show how lower dimensional black holes
are obtained from the ten dimensional solutions We discuss the role of U-duality
and Dirac duality for quantizing the charges We nally consider extremal and
non-extremal black hole solutions in ve and four dimensions We will dene
new variables identied with the number of some hypothetical non-interacting
constituents in terms of which the entropy takes a surprisingly simple form
21 Extended p-brane solutions
We will now consider solutions to type II supergravity theories in ten di-
mensions We will concentrate rst with solutions that preserve some supersym-
metries the so called BPS solutions We start with one of the simplest which is
the solution corresponding to the elds outside a long fundamental string 39 It
only has elds in the rst three terms in 16 excited and it is a solution in both
type II theories and also in the heterotic string theory It carries charge under the
NSNS B eld this charge appears as a central charge in the supersymmetry
algebra The solution with the minimum mass for a given charge will then be
BPS The simplest way to nd this BPS solution is the following Start with a
SO11SO8 symmetric ansatz for the metric in string frame

ds2  hcid2f1
dt2  dx2

We also allow the dilaton  and the component B09 of the antisymmetric tensor
to be nonzero and we set all other elds to zero Now we try to nd Killing
spinors which generate innitesimal local supersymmetry transformations that
leave the solution invariant
In order to be denite we consider the type IIA
theory a similar treatment goes through for the IIB and heterotic theories The
existence of unbroken supersymmetry implies that the gravitino and dilatino

should vanish for appropriate values of the spinor  where   R  L is the
sum the a possitive and negative chirality spinor Greek letters label coordinate

indices are related by the zehnbeins ea

tion a are the at space gamma matrices satisfying a b  2ab   e
and 1n is the antisymmetrized product with unit weight ie dividing by
the number of terms
In order for the equations 24 to have solutions the
 and ab

other and take the form 39

where ff is a function of the transverse coordinates x1  x8 and the rest of the
elds are zero With this ansatz 25 the supersymmetry variations 24 vanish
if the spinors satisfy the conditions

where the spinors 0
RL are independent of position and are the asymptotic values
of the Killing spinors So we see that the solution preserves half of the super-
symmetries for any function ff  Actually the equations of motion of the theory
related to the closure of the supersymmetry algebra imply that ff is a har-
monic function 2ff  0 where 2 is the at Laplacian in the directions 1     8

we get a solution that looks like a long string
It is singular at r  0 but in
fact one can see from the metric that it is a so called null singularity there is
a horizon at the singularity and we do not have a naked singularity
In this
classical solution the constant Qf is arbitrary However this long string solution
carries a charge under the B eld this charge is carried in string theory by
the fundamental strings The charge that the fundamental strings carry is their
winding number and it is not continuous it is a multiple of some minimum
value An easy way to see this is to consider this theory compactied on a circle
by periodically identifying the direction 9 by x9  x9  2R In that case the
B9 components of the antisymmetric tensor eld become a gauge eld in the
extended dimensions The electric charge associated with this gauge eld is the
winding number along the direction 9 which counts how many strings are wound
along this circle In string theory this number is an integer there is a geometric
quantization condition This is why we say that the fundamental strings can carry
only integer multiples of this charge We conclude that Qf  c10
f m with m an
integer representing the winding number One can determine c10
f by comparing
the charge of 25 with that of a fundamental string with winding number m
This is equivalent due to the fact that both are BPS solutions to comparing the
masses The ADM mass is determined from 25 from the g00 component of the
Einstein metric of the extended 1  8 dimensional theory This gives
67
where d  2d2
d2 is the volume of the sphere in d dimensions Sd1
Since this supergravity solution carries the same charge and mass as the
fundamental string and has the same supersymmetry properties it is natural
to regard 252728 as describing the long range elds produced by a long
fundamental string This is analogous to saying in quantum electrodynamics
that the electric eld of a point charge describes the elds far from an electron
Actually in 39 this coecient 28 was determined by matching the solution
25 to a fundamental string source of the form 11
harmonic function Taking it to be ff Pi c10
It is interesting that the equations of motion just demand that ff in 25 is a
f rri6 we describe a collection
of strings sitting at positions ri in static equilibrium The gravitational attraction
and the dilation force cancel against the electric repulsion This superposition
principle is a generic property of BPS solutions and will appear several times
in the construction of BPS black holes We indeed expect to have no force since
the energy of a BPS conguration with charge m as given by the BPS formula
does not depend on the position of the charges
Now we turn to other ten dimensional solutions that preserve 12 of the
supersymmetries The fundamental string solutions carried electric charge
under the B eld The corresponding eld strength H  dB is dual to a seven
index eld strength F7  H and can be written in terms of a six form F7  d B6
This six form couples naturally to a ve-brane The supergravity solution called
solitonic symmetric vebrane is again determined in terms of a single harmonic
function 40 In string frame it reads

and all other elds are zero
ijkl is just the at space epsilon tensor The
harmonic function fs5 depends on the coordinates transverse to the vebrane
4  The
x1    x4 and for a single vebrane takes the form fs5  1 
constant cs5 is determined from the Dirac quantization condition That is to
say the B eld that results from 29 cannot be dened over all space and
will have have some discontinuities These discontinuities will be invisible to
fundamental strings if the vebrane charge obeys the condition analogous to the
Dirac quantization condition for electric and magnetic charges This condition
implies that cs
5   40 so that the mass of the vebrane goes as 1g2 showing a
typical solitonic behavior what is more the string metric 29 shows a geometry
with a long throat at r  0 so that it has some size The Killing spinors that
generate the unbroken supersymmetries are determined as in the case of the
fundamental string 26 by some constant spinors at innity which satisfy the
conditions

R  12340
Even though we have presented these solutions just as supergravity solutions it
is possible to show that they dene conformal eld theories which implies that
they are solutions to the full string classical action and not just to the low energy
supergravity
In type II theories it is natural to look for supergravity solutions describing
the long range elds away from a D-brane They will be extended branes of p spa-
tial dimensions carrying electric charge under the Ap1 forms or magnetic
under the A7p forms
These solutions have the form in string frame 28

where fp is again a harmonic function of the transverse coordinates xp1  x9
All these solutions are BPS and break half of the supersymmetries through the
conditions 116 They correspond to the extremal limit of charged black p-
branes when the harmonic function is fp  1  nc10
p r7p where n is an integer
and c10
is related to the minimum charge of a D-brane and will be calculated
later using U-duality In the type IIA we will have only solutions like 211 for p
even and in the type IIB only for p odd In type IIB theory there are two kinds of
strings the fundamental strings and the D-strings Similarly there are two kinds
of vebranes the solitonic vebrane and the D-vebrane the dierence between
them is whether they carry charge under the antisymmetric tensor eld B or
B  The dilaton and the string metric are also dierent in both solutions but
they transform into each other under S duality The three brane is self dual
under S-duality
Note that all these extremal solutions are boost invariant for boosts along
the brane in that sense they are relativistic branes like the fundamental string
This property is related to the fact that they preserve some supersymmetries
The extremal branes therefore cannot carry momentum in the longitudinal direc-
tions by just moving in a rigid fashion but of course they can carry transverse
momentum In order to carry longitudinal momentum they have to oscillate in
some way that is the topic of the next section These oscillations propagate at
the velocity of light since the tension is equal to the mass per unit brane-volume
22 Oscillating strings and branes
This section is aimed at providing a more direct correspondence between
It can be skipped in a
BPS oscillating strings and fundamental string states
rst quick reading
As discussed in section 12 a fundamental string containing only left moving
oscillations is a BPS state breaking 14 of the supersymmetries It is natural
to look for supergravity solutions that describe the long distance behaviour of
these oscillating strings We can take R9 to be large and we can make coher-
ent states with the string oscillators leading to macroscopic classical oscillations
Therefore we expect the supergravity solutions to exhibit these oscillations which
describe traveling waves on a fundamental string The general method to con-
struct these solutions was developed by 41 In the case of fundamental strings
the oscillating solutions take the form 42

212 arises from the chiral null models studied in 43 Since this metric is not
manifestly asymptotically at we prefer to make the simple change of coordinates

the physical momentum per unit length carried by the string The metric is now
manifestly asymptotically at and in the limit F iu  0 it reduces to the
static solution 25
This oscillating string solution 212 preserves 14 of the supersymmetries
The spinors that generate the unbroken supersymmetries satisfy
R  090
L  0 
As a check on our understanding of the physics of these solutions we should
verify that the excited strings do indeed transport physical momentum and angu-
lar momentum Since we have written the metric in a gauge where it approaches
the Minkowski metric at spatial innity we can use standard ADM or Bondi mass
techniques to read o kinetic quantities from surface integrals over the deviations
of the metric from Minkowski form Following 3944 we pass to the physical
Einstein metric gE  e2Gstring expand it at innity as gE    h
and use standard methods to construct conserved quantities from surface inte-
grals linear in h  We nd that the transverse momentum per unit length on a
slice of constant u is

bances on strings Similarly the net longitudinaltime energy-momentum per
unit length     0 9 in a constant u slice is

Finally we consider angular momenta For the string in ten dimensions there are
four independent spatial planes and thus four independent angular momenta
M ij per unit length Evaluating as an example M 12 we obtain 42
M 12  f1f 2  f2f 1u 
There are no surprises here just a useful consistency check
Note that a single fundamental string satises the level matching condition
13 so we might wonder if there is an analogous condition in the supergravity
solution One way to nd this condition is to demand that the solution matches
to a fundamental string source 45 Another way is to demand that the singu-
larity when we approach the string is not naked but null 42 This amounts to
demanding that the function k in 212 vanishes which leads to
22 F iu2 
There are also BPS multiple string solutions where the dierent strings are oscil-
lating independently They are described in 42 and they involve new conformal
eld theories which are a generalization of the chiral null models considered by
43 If we have such a superposition the condition 218 need not be satised
Actually one has to eectively average over functions F iu 42 For a general
ensemble of functions F iu will be uncorrelated with F ju and the gi Bi
components of the metric and antisymmetric tensor will vanish leaving just the
function k in 212 Note that this is not the case if they are carrying some net
angular momentum 217

23 d  9 Black Holes From d  10 strings or branes
Since all the BPS solutions treated in the previous section depend on
some harmonic function f one can make multiple brane solutions by taking
f  1  Pi cpr  ri7p which describes a set of branes at positions ri in
static equilibrium The gravitational attraction is balanced by the repulsion due
to their charges
In this section the word brane will indicate any of the BPS solutions
discussed above We will now consider the type IIB theory compactied to d
dimensions on a torus T 10d identifying the coordinates by xi  xi  2Ri
choosing periodic boundary conditions on this 10  d dimensional box Fields
that vary over the box will acquire masses of the order m  1R where R is
the typical compactication size The easiest way to see this is by expanding
the elds in Fourier components along the internal dimensions So if we are
interested in the low energy physics in d extended dimensions the elds will be
independent of the internal coordinates of the torus If we want to nd solutions
to this d dimensional supergravity theory does it help us to know the solutions
in ten dimensions Yes it does The key point to observe is that if we have any
solution in ten dimensions which is periodic under xi  xi  2Ri then it will
also be a solution of the compactied theory For any p-brane the solution is
automatically translational invariant in the directions parallel to the brane In
order to produce a periodic solution we superimpose BPS solutions forming a
lattice in the transverse directions producing a harmonic function
f  1  XnLattice
r  2Rin7p 
We can view this as solving the Laplace equation with the method of images in a
periodic box It is this nice superposition principle for BPS solutions that enables
us to nd a very direct correspondence between ten dimensional objects and the d
dimensional ones We will be interested in solutions where the brane is completely
wrapped along the internal directions so that from the point of view of the
observer in d dimensions one has a localized spherically symmetric solution
These solutions will correspond to extremal limits of charged black hole solutions
The rst point to notice that if the brane wraps p of the torus dimensions then
the sum in 220 runs over a 10  d  p dimensional lattice If we are looking
at the solutions at distances much bigger than the compactication scale then
we are allowed to replace the sum in 220 by an integral This integral would
naturally appear also if we average over the position of the brane on the internal
torus The net eect of the integral will be to give the function f  1 cd
P rd3
where r is the distance in the extended d dimensional coordinates Note that the
power of r is independent of p and is the appropriate one to be the spherically
symmetric solution to Laplaces equation in d  1 spatial dimensions So when
we are in the d dimensional theory the only way we have to tell that the black
hole contains a particular type of p brane is by looking at the gauge elds that
it excites The nal result is that the d dimensional solutions are given again by
25 29 and 211 but now in terms of d dimensional harmonic functions
As a particular example we will consider the black holes resulting from com-
pactifying the oscillating strings treated in the previous section The oscillation
will be along a compact direction and we average over them We could think
that we are looking at distances larger than the compactication radius or that
we do an average over the phase of the oscillation
It is important that this
average is done at the level of the harmonic function that species the solu-
tion and not on the individual components of the elds which are non-linear in
terms of the harmonic functions This procedure produces a solution of the d
dimensional supergravity theory To be more precise we build a periodic 9 d
dimensional array of strings by taking the harmonic function as in 220 For
large distances  in the extended dimensions we can ignore the dependence on
the internal dimensions and nd
f  1 
d3 
d  3d2
and d is the area of the d dimensional unit sphere and m is the total winding
number We could have taken directly f d
as a solution of the Laplace equation
in the uncompactied dimensions but we obtained it from superimposing solu-
tions to clarify the connection to underlying string states As we will now show
the result of this procedure can be interpreted as a lower-dimensional extremal
black hole The general idea that ten-dimensional string solutions can be used
to generate four-dimensional black holes is not new and has been explored in
4647484942
We now look in more detail at the d-dimensional elds generated by this
compactication Using the dimensional reduction procedure of 50  we nd
that the d-dimensional elds obtained from wrapping a string with oscillations
are in d-dimensional Einstein metric
e2d e210pG99 qf d
1  kd
dt2 hf d
1  kdi
E  
1  kdi
This and all the other elds obtained by dimensional reduction turn out to be the
type II analogs of Sens four-dimensional black holes and their higher-dimensional
generalizations 51 52 The Einstein metric of the d dimensional solution has
the same form if we consider any other oscillating brane completely wrapped
around the internal torus since the Einstein metric is invariant under U-duality
We can check that for these black holes 222 the area of the horizon which is
at   0 is zero so that the classical entropy is zero It is possible to dene
a nonzero classical entropy at the stretched horizon which agrees up to a
numerical constant with the counting of states 53
24 U-duality and quantization of the charges
We will show in this section how to quantize the charges using U-duality
12 There has been some disagreement in the literature concerning the precise
quantization condition so we have decided for completeness to explain it in
detail Since the quantum of charge will depend on the normalization chosen for
the gauge eld we nd it more convenient to nd the quantum of mass This
quantity has a well dened meaning since the solution is BPS and the mass is
proportional to the charge and protected from quantum corrections so that it
can be calculated using the weakly coupled theory When we perform S-duality
transformations we should remember that the mass measured in the Einstein
metric gE  e2G which includes a power of g stays invariant This is not
how we normally measure masses we normally leave a power of g in the Newton
constant The masses we are going to calculate are dened in terms of a modied
Einstein metric which is gE  e 
2 G  g12gE which agrees with the string
metric at innity All we are saying is that we keep the factor of g2 in the Newton
constant Masses measured in the two metrics dier by ME  g14M  where M
is the mass measured in the metric gE which is the one we are going to use
here The d dimensional Newton constant is Gd
N V10d where V10d is
the volume of the internal torus We start with the minimum mass of a winding
string which is 12
N  G10
Similarly the minimum mass for momentum states is M  1R Now we want
to calculate the mass of a D-string with unit winding using ten dimensional S-
duality We know that the Einstein metric is invariant under S-duality so that
ME is invariant this implies
g14M  ME  ME  g14 R9
so that the mass of the D-string is
where we took into account the change in R9 as in 17 Applying T-duality
transformations 15 along a direction perpendicular to the D-string we turn it
into a D-twobrane with mass
R9R8
g32 
Proceeding in this fashion we nd the minimum mass for any D-brane
R10p    R9
gp12
Doing now an S-duality transformation on the D-vebrane as in 224 we get
the mass of the solitonic vebrane
R5    R9
g23
Our objective is to determine the coecients that appear in the harmonic func-
tions specifying the solutions 2529211 Since we will be mainly interested
in four and ve dimensional black holes we are interested in the coecient that
appears in the d dimensional harmonic functions as in 221222 Actually
from 222 by setting kd  0 we can read o the mass of these objects in terms
of the coecients in the harmonic function f d The mass is calculated from the
behaviour of gE 00 of the metric at innity 54

where n is the volume of the unit sphere Sn n  2n2
n2  This determines the
coecients for all excitations We still have to express GN in terms of g remem-
ber that we dened g to be such that it goes to 1g under S-duality 17 In
order to do that we use Dirac duality of the fundamental string and the solitonic
vebrane The fundamental string carries electric charge under the NSNS B
eld while the solitonic vebrane carries magnetic charge It is not possible to
dene globally the B eld of the vebrane 29 This eld will contain a sin-
gularity analogous to the Dirac string for a monopole in electrodynamics The
condition that this singularity is invisible for the fundamental strings xes the
coecient of the vebrane harmonic function as c5
s5   404 Comparing this
value with the one resulting from 229 and 228 we nd the ten dimensional
Newton constant
N  86g24 
In string theory one can independently calculate the mass of D-branes from
virtual closed string exchange diagrams in a similar fashion as one calculates the
force between two charges in quantum electrodynamics The string miracle 8
is that this string theory calculation of masses of D-branes agrees with the masses
predicted by U-duality as above
Now for later convenience let us quote the results which are obtained from
227229230 for the D-onebrane D-vebranes and momentum in ve ex-
tended dimensions which we will need for the ve dimensional black holes

We will also need the corresponding coecients for D-twobranes D-

where we have used the value of the Newton constant 230

denition of the string tension as in 11
25 Black hole solutions in ve dimensions
In section 23 we considered black holes coming from wrapping just one type
of branes on the torus or at most one type of branes with oscillations All those
black holes have zero horizon area and are singular at the horizon since there
are scalar elds diverging at the horizon By looking at the classical solutions
we see that in almost all of them the dilaton is going to plus or minus innity
Also the physical longitudinal size goes to zero measured in Einstein metric for
all the branes with no oscillations Adding momentum in the internal directions
does not help we still have some diverging scalar The three brane 211 has
constant dilaton but suers of this problem about the physical size
Our goal is to construct solutions with well dened geometries at the horizon
like the ones appearing in General Relativity The key principle is that we need to
balance the scalars at the horizon Dierent branes have dierent scalar charges
which can be interpreted as pressures or tensions in the compact direction Note
that even the dilaton falls in this category when we think of it as the size of the
11th dimension in M-theory If a scalar diverges when we approach the horizon
the d dimensional character of the solution is lost This forces us to consider
more than one type of branes We need three dierent types for black holes
in ve dimensions and four dierent types for black holes in d  4 here two
non-parallel p-branes count as being of dierent type
251 Extremal black holes in ve dimensions
We construct the ve dimensional black hole with nonzero area by superpos-
ing a number Q5 of D-vebranes Q1 D-onebranes and Kaluza-Klein momentum
We consider type IIB compactied on T 5 We wrap a number Q5 of D-vebranes
on T 5 Then we wrap Q1 D-strings along one of the directions of the torus let us
pick the 9th direction In addition we put some momentum P9  NR9 along the
string ie in the direction 9 The solution is given by three harmonic functions
f5 f1 and k We start writing the solution in terms of the ten dimensional string
metric so that the relation to 211 becomes more apparent 5514

the Ramond-Ramond antisymmetric tensor eld BRR
  that are excited behave
as gauge elds when we dimensionally reduce to ve dimensions The three
independent charges arise as follows Q1 is a RR electric charge coming from
and counts the 1D-branes Q5 is a magnetic charge for the three form
eld strength HRR
 which is dual in ve dimensions to a gauge eld
F2  5HRR
 Q5 is thus an electric charge for the gauge eld F2 and it counts the
number of 5D-branes The third charge N  corresponds to the total momentum
along the branes in the direction 9 and it is associated to the ve dimensional
Kaluza-Klein gauge eld coming from the G09 component of the metric

Let us understand what happens to the supersymmetries In the ten dimen-
sional type IIB theory the supersymmetries are generated by two independent
chiral spinors R and L  11RL  RL The presence of the D-strings and the
D-vebranes imposes additional conditions on the surviving supersymmetries
R  09L 
R  056789L 
where the rst condition is due to the presence of the string and the second to the
presence of the vebrane 116 When we put momentum we break additional
supersymmetries through the conditions
09R  R 
09L  L
Taken together with 235 we get the following decomposition of the spinor
under the group S011SO4ESO4I  which is the subgroup of Lorentz
transformations that leaves the ten dimensional solution 233 invariant
L  R  
SO11
SO4
SO4 
The positive chirality SO4 spinor is pseudoreal and has two independent com-
ponents so that 18 4 out of the original 32 supersymmetries are preserved
by this conguration The rst SO4E corresponds to spatial rotations in 41
dimensions SO4I corresponds to rotations in the internal directions 5 6 7 8
and is broken by the compactication The solution is supersymmetric and has
the same energy independent on whether all the branes are sitting at the same
point or not so in principle we can separate the dierent constituents of the black
hole The resulting black hole will have lower entropy so this process violates the
second law of thermodynamics
Now we dimensionally reduce 233 to ve dimensions in order to read o
black hole properties The standard method of 56 yields a ve-dimensional
Einstein metric g5

which describes a ve dimensional extremal charged supersymmetric black hole
with nonzero horizon area Calculating the horizon area in this metric 238 we
get the entropy

In this form the entropy does not depend on any of the continuous parameters like
the coupling constant or the sizes of the internal circles etc This topological
character of the entropy was emphasized in 57 58 55 It is also symmetric
under interchange of N Q1 Q5 In fact U duality 12 59 60 interchanges the
three charges To show it in a more specic fashion let us dene Ti to be the
usual T-duality that inverts the compactication radius in the direction i and S
the ten dimensional S duality of type IIB theory Then a transformation that
sends N Q1 Q5 to Q1 Q5 N  is U T8T7T6T5ST6T9 Note however that
this transformation changes the coupling constant and the sizes of the T 5
The standard ve-dimensional extremal Reissner-Nordstrom solution 54 is
recovered when the charges are chosen such that
cP N  c1Q1  c5Q5  r2
The crucial point is that for this ratio of charges the dilaton eld and the in-
ternal compactication geometry are independent of position and the distinction
between the ten-dimensional and ve-dimensional geometries evaporates What
is at issue is not so much the charges as the dierent types of energy-momentum
densities with which they are associated An intuitive picture of what goes on
is this 14 a p-brane produces a dilaton eld of the form e210  f
fp a harmonic function 28 A superposition of branes produces a product of
such functions and one sees how 1-branes can cancel 5-branes in their eect on
the dilaton A similar thing is true for the compactication volume For any
p-brane the string metric is such that as we get closer to the brane the volume
parallel to the brane shrinks due to the brane tension and the volume perpen-
dicular to it expands due to the pressure of the electric eld lines It is easy to
see how superposing 1-branes and 5-branes can stabilize the volume in the di-
rections 6 7 8 9 since they are perpendicular to the 1-brane and parallel to the
5-brane The volume in the direction 5 would still seem to shrink due to the ten-
sion of the branes This is indeed why we put momentum along the 1-branes to
balance the tension and produce a stable radius in the 5 direction If we balance
the charges precisely 240 we can always do this for large charges the moduli
scalar elds associated with the compactied dimensions are not excited at all
which is what we need to get the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole Of course if
we do not balance them precisely we still have a black hole with nonzero area
as long as the three charges are nonzero
252 Non-extremal black holes in ve dimensions
The ve dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is a solution of the ve
dimensional Einstein plus Maxwell action The metric reads 54

There is a horizon at r  r mass and charge are given by
rr 
The extremal solution is obtained by taking r  r  re and reduces to 238
with the charges related by 240 after doing the coordinate transformation
r2  x2  r2
Now we would like to construct the non-extremal ve dimensional black
holes with arbitrary values of the charges The method is very simple 1817
First we start with the non-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom 241 which has some
constraints on the charges 240 then we lift up this conguration to ten dimen-
sions That is done by inverting the standard dimensional reduction procedure
56 and we nd the ten dimensional form of the various elds This gives a
non-extremal conguration where the charges are related by 240 We will
apply some transformations which remove the constraints of 240 We start
by boosting the solution along the direction of the onebranes we called it 9
This introduces some extra momentum so that now the RR charges are con-
strained but the momentum is arbitrary The result is a solution which can be
viewed as a black string in six dimensions 18 Now we need to remove the
constraint on the RR charges To that eect we do a U duality transforma-
tion that interchanges the three dierent charges More precisely we perform the
transformation UT8T7T6T5ST6T9 that sends N Q1 Q5 to Q1 Q5 N  This
transformed one RR charge into momentum so that we can boost the solution
to produce a solution with arbitrary value of this RR charge After doing all
these transformations and choosing some appropriate coordinates the resulting
ten dimensional solution is in string metric

This is just the ve-dimensional Schwarzschild metric with the time and space
components rescaled by dierent powers of  The factored form of  was known
to hold for extremal solutions 238 49 It is surprising that it continues to
hold even in the non-extremal case The solution is manifestly invariant under
permutations of the three boost parameters as required by U-duality The event
horizon is clearly at r  r0 The coordinates we have used present the solution in
a simple and symmetric form but they do not always cover the entire spacetime
When all three charges are nonzero the surface r  0 is a smooth inner horizon
This is analogous to the situation in four dimensions with four charges 61
When at least one of the charges is zero the surface r  0 becomes singular
Several thermodynamic quantities can be associated to this solution They can
be computed in either the ten dimensional or ve dimensional metrics and yield
the same answer For example the ADM energy is
2g2 cosh 2  cosh 2  cosh 2 
The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is
2RV r3
cosh  cosh  cosh 
where A is the area of the horizon and we have used the value 230 for the
Newton constant The Hawking temperature is
2r0 cosh  cosh  cosh 
In ten dimensions the black hole is characterized by pressures which describe how
the energy changes for isentropic variations in R and V  In ve dimensions these
are charges associated with the two scalar elds coming from the components
G99 and G55 in 244 which can be interpreted as the pressures in the directions
9 and 5 respectively and they read
2g2 cid20cosh 2

cosh 2  cosh 2cid21 
The extremal limit corresponds to the limit r0  0 with at least one of the
boost parameters      keeping R V and the associated charges 245
xed If we keep all three charges nonzero in this limit one obtains

The rst equation is the saturated Bogomolnyi bound for this theory
We now show that there is a formal sense in which the entire family of
solutions discussed above can be viewed as built up of branes anti-branes and
momentum The extremal limits with only one type of excitation are obtained
by letting r0 go to zero and taking a boost parameter go to innity keeping only
one charge xed These extremal metrics represent a D-onebrane wrapping the
S1 or a D-vebrane wrapping the T 5 or the momentum modes around the S1
From 248 and 251 we see that a single onebrane or anti-onebrane has mass
and pressures

Of course a onebrane has Q1  1 while an anti-onebrane has Q1  1 A single
vebrane or anti-vebrane has

For left- or right-moving momentum
Given 253 - 255 and the relations 245 248 and 251
possible to trade the six parameters of the general solution for the six quan-
tities N1 N1 N5 N5 NR NL which are the numbers of onebranes
anti-onebranes vebranes anti-vebranes right-moving momentum and left-
moving momentum respectively This is accomplished by equating the total
mass pressures and charges of the black hole with those of a collection of
N1 N1 N5 N5 NR NL non-interacting constituent branes antibranes
and momentum By non-interacting we mean that the masses and pressures are
simply the sums of the masses and pressures of the constituents The resulting
expression for the N s are

e2 
256 is the denition of the N s but we will refer to them as the numbers of
branes antibranes and momentum because as will be seen they reduce to those
numbers in certain limits where these concepts are well dened
In terms of the numbers 256 the charges are simply Q1  N1  N1 Q5 
N5  N5 N  NR  NL the total energy is

and the volume and radius are

R cid18 g2NRNL
From 252 we see that the extremal solutions correspond to including either
branes or anti-branes but not both Notice that for the general Reissner-
Nordstrom solutions      the contribution to the total energy from
onebranes vebranes and momentum are all equal
N1  N1 
N5  N5 
NR  NL
The actual number of branes of each type depends on R and V and can be very
dierent
Of course there seems to be no reason for neglecting interactions between
collections of branes and momentum modes composing a highly non-extremal
black hole at strong or intermediate coupling Hence the denitions 256 would
seem to be inappropriate for describing a generic black hole However the utility
of these denitions can be seen when we reexpress the black hole entropy 249
in terms of the N s It takes the remarkably simple form
S  2pN1 pN1pN5 pN5pNL pNR 
In the next chapter we will compute this formula in string theory in some special
limits An interesting property of this entropy formula 261 is that if one takes
the brane-antibrane numbers to be free variables and then one maximases the
entropy 261 subject to the constraints that the charges and the total energy
257 are xed then one gets the relations 259258 and hence 256 for the
brane-antibrane numbers So in this very specic sense the black hole solution
represents a system of branes and antibranes in thermodynamic equilibrium
A puzzling feature of 261 is that it only involves onebranes vebranes and
momentum This is understandable for extremal solutions with these charges
but when one moves away from extremality one might expect pairs of threebranes
and anti-threebranes or fundamental string winding modes to contribute to the
entropy To understand the roles of these other objects one should start with
the full Type II string theory compactied on T 5 The low energy limit of this
theory is N  8 supergravity in ve dimensions we measure N in four d terms
ie by the amount of supersymmetry that it has reduced to d  4 This theory
has 27 gauge elds 42 scalars and a global E6 symmetry Since only the scalar
elds which couple to the gauge elds are nontrivial in a black hole background
we expect the general solution to be characterized by 27 scalars in addition to
the 27 charges One can interpret the 27 scalar parameters as 26 scalars plus
the ADM energy Each charge corresponds to a type of soliton or string Thus
we expect the solution to again be characterized by the number of solitons and
anti-solitons For an extremal black hole the entropy can be written in the E6
invariant form 62 63
S  2TABCV AV BV C12 
where V A is the 27 dimensional charge vector and TABC is a symmetric cubic
invariant in E6 For the non-extremal black holes the above argument suggests
that one can introduce two vectors V A
i  1 2 which represent the number of
solitons and anti-solitons Although we have not done the calculation the general
black hole entropy might take the E6 invariant form
S  2Xijk
TABCV A
k 12 
indicates the number of charges and V A
where i j k  1 2 V A
the number of
anticharges each is a vector in the 27 of E6 The entropy of non-extremal black
holes can be represented in terms of charges and anti-charges in many dierent
equivalent ways which are related by E6 transformations Now we see that our
choice of D-onebranes D-vebranes and momentum was like a choice of basis
and other congurations are related by E6Z U-duality transformations
One can similarly construct rotating black holes in ve dimensions The
spatial rotation group is SO4E  SU2RSU2L We we can view the an-
gular momentum as a 44 antisymmetric matrix We can choose a basis such
that it reduces to 22 blocks each block corresponds to a rotation on a plane
and there are two orthogonal planes The angular momentum is characterized
by the angular momentum eigenvalues J1 J2 on these two planes Also the an-
gular momenta are characterized by the U1 charges FR2 FL2 which are two
eigenvalues of the SU2s we dene FRL to have integer eigenvalues We have
FR  FL
FR  FL 
The solution with angular momentum can be found in 15 16 64 we will be
just interested in the entropy of that solution in the extremal limit for which the
mass is the minimum consistent with a given angular momentum and charges
The entropy is then
For J1  J2 the solution is also BPS 15

26 Black hole solutions in four dimensions
Now we turn to the more realistic case of four dimensional black holes It
is still not totally realistic since the compactication we will consider is on T 6
which is not the one that describes our four dimensional world The supergravity
theory however contains black hole solutions which are exactly those of General
Relativity The dierence between the two theories is that the N8 supergravity
theory one obtains by compactifying on T 6 has many more gauge elds 28 of
them and massless scalars 70 of them Black hole solutions are characterized
by 56 charges 28 electric and 28 magnetic One hopes that the general features
of black hole physics will not depend too much on the content of the theory as
long as it includes gravity and one is studying black holes with the same metric
as the ones appearing in General Relativity In fact some of the solutions we
study are also solutions in general relativity
261 Extremal black holes in four dimensions
Let us start with the extremal black holes 19 20 Taking the congura-
tion of 1D-branes 5D-branes and momentum that we had in d  5 and putting it
on T 6 we obtain a black hole solution that preserves 18 of the supersymmetries
In order to put it on T 6 one has to form a lattice of the extremal ve dimensional
black holes 233 and dene new harmonic functions as in 220 This makes
all harmonic functions to depend on 1r where now r is the spatial distance in
13 dimensions The unbroken supersymmetries are given by 237 Now we do
a T duality transformation along the direction 4 to the IIA theory and we get
a system of 2D-branes 6D-branes and momentum In addition we ip the chi-
rality of the ten dimensional spinor R We will have IIA
R  so that the
chirality that is ipped in R is that of the external SO4E Of course only
the SO3 subgroup corresponding to spatial rotations in the directions 1 2 3 is
a symmetry of the solution However this black hole has zero area and has a
singular geometry at the horizon The reason is that some of the scalar elds are
unbalanced for example we can see from 211 that the dilaton eld will not
go to a constant as we approach the horizon e2  f12
 It is interesting
that one can put an additional type of charge without breaking any additional
supersymmetry This charge has to be a solitonic vebrane it is the only one al-
lowed by supersymmetry that is not just a U-duality tranformation of the others
R  4IIB
This in a sense is analogous to putting left moving oscillations on a macroscopic
heterotic string 42 which does not break any additional supersymmetry It also
has the virtue of balancing all the scalars for example the dilaton now behaves
as e2  f12
s5  In order to be more precise let us say that our torus is
T 6  T 4  S1  S1 and we have the 6D-branes wrapping all T 6 the 2D-branes
wrap S1  S1 directions 4 9 the solitonic vebranes wrap T 4  S1 directions
5 6 7 8 9 and the momentum is owing along S1 direction 9 Notice that the
momentum ows parallel to the vebranes and the two D-branes
6 f1
We can see from 116219 and 210 that the vebrane does not break
any additional supersymmetry The nal conguration still preserves 18 of
the original supersymmetries Decomposing the surviving spinor in terms of
SO11SO4ESO4I we nd

This metric is parameterized by the ve independent quantities 2 5 6 p
and r0 The event horizon lies at r  r0 The special case 2  5  6  p
corresponds to the Reissner-Nordstrom metric 21 so that we see that as we
promised the General Relativity solution is among the cases studied The overall
solution contains three additional parameters which are related to the asymptotic
values of the three scalars From the ten-dimensional viewpoint these are the
product of the radii of T 4 V  R5R6R7R8 and the radii of S1 and S1 R9
and R4 and they appear in the quantization condition for the charges There
are in addition U1 gauge elds excited corresponding to the four physical
charges One is the Kaluza Klein gauge eld coming from the component G09
of the metric which carries the momentum charge N  Then we have a RR
gauge eld coming from the component C049 of the three form RR potential
which carries the 2D-brane charge Q2 The 6D brane charge Q6 appears as
magnetic charge for the one form RR potential A and nally the vebrane
charge Q5 also appears as magnetic charge for the gauge eld coming from the
NS antisymmetric tensor with one index along the direction 4 B4

the charges derived in section 24

As we did for the ve dimensional black hole in section 25 we calculate the
values for the mass and scalar charges of each type of brane or string This can be
calculated from the solution we have presented by taking the four extremal limits
r0  0 i   with Qi and j j 6 i xed We nd that D-twobranes have

and for the momentum we nd

of the solution for the eight quantities NR NL N2 N2 N5 N5 N6 N6 which are
the numbers of rightleft-moving momentum modes twobranes anti-twobranes
vebranes anti-vebranes sixbranes and anti-sixbranes We do this by match-
ing the mass 272 pressures 274 and gauge charges 271 with those of a

The entropy 273 then takes the surprisingly simple form
S  2pNR pNLpN2 pN2pN5 pN5pN6 pN6 
This is the analog of 261 for four-dimensional black holes When one term
in each factor vanishes the black hole is extremal 269 Although we cannot
derive the general formula from counting string states we will do so in certain
limits corresponding to near-extremal black holes
Since the full theory should be E7 invariant we should be able to write
the 56-

the general entropy formula in an invariant way If we denote by V A
dimensional vector giving the number of solitons and by V A
solitons the formula for the entropy takes the form 6566

where TABCD is the E7 quartic invariant
We now consider adding rotation to the black holes discussed above Since
the rotation dependent terms in the solution fall o faster at innity than the
charges the denition of the brane numbers 279 is unchanged If we take nearly
extremal black holes with N2  N5  N6  0 and R1 large the Bekenstein-

3 D-BRANE DESCRIPTION OF BLACK HOLES
In this chapter we will describe some properties of the black holes that we
studied in chap 2 in terms of the D-brane string solitons described in chap 1
The black holes we study have non-zero horizon area and contain as special cases
the charged black holes of general relativity The description that will emerge
depends on some detailed properties of the string theory D-brane solitons which
are obvious from just the supergravity theory The key property that will be
used is that when many D-branes sit at the same point there is a large number of
massless states coming from open strings with ends attached to dierent branes
We will start with the ve dimensional black hole which is simpler because it
involves only three dierent kinds of charge Then we treat the four dimensional
case In both cases we will start with the BPS extremal black holes where the
calculation of the entropy can be justied on the basis of supersymmetry and
then we will explore the near-extremal limits
4 Extremal Five dimensional black holes
We consider the type IIB theory on T 5  T 4  S1 We consider a cong-
uration of Q5 D-vebranes wrapping the whole T 5 Q1 D-strings wrapping the
S1 and momentum NR9 along the S1 choosing this S1 to be in the direction
9 All charges N Q1 Q5 are integers 238
Since extremal D-branes are boost invariant along the directions parallel to
the branes they cannot carry momentum along S1 by just moving rigidly Our
rst task will be to identify the D-brane excitations that carry the momentum In
the discussion of the oscillating fundamental string in sec 22 the momentum
was carried by the oscillations However just oscillations of the branes do not
have enough entropy to match the classical result As we saw in the D-brane sec-
tion oscillations of the branes are described by massless open strings with both
ends attached to the same brane There are many types of open strings to con-
sider those that go from one 1-brane to another 1-brane which we denote as 11
strings as well as the corresponding 55 15 and 51 strings the last two
being dierent because the strings are oriented We want to excite these strings
and put some momentum on them As it was shown for oscillating D-branes in
section 13 exciting some of them makes others massive so we have to see what is
the way to excite the stings so that a maximum number remains massless since
this conguration will have the highest entropy Let us work out the properties
of 15 and 51 strings The string is described by the action 11 where two
of the coordinates have Neumann-Neumann boundary conditions X 0 X 9 four
coordinates have Dirichlet-Dirichlet boundary conditions X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 and
the other four have Neumann-Dirichlet conditions X 5 X 6 X 7 X 8 The vac-
uum energy of the worldsheet bosons is E  4124  148 Consider the NS
sector for the worldsheet fermions the 4 that are in the ND directions will end
up having R-type quantization conditions The net fermionic vacuum energy is
E  4124148 and exactly cancels the bosonic one This vacuum is a spinor
under SO4I  is acted on by 5 6 7 8 and obeys the GSO chirality condi-
tion 5678   What remains is a two dimensional representation There
are two possible orientations and they can be attached to any of the dierent
branes of each type This gives a total of 4Q1Q5 dierent possible states for these
strings Now consider the Ramond sector the four internal fermions transverse
to the string will have NS type boundary conditions The vacuum again has
zero energy and is an SO15 spinor and a spacetime fermion Again the GSO
condition implies that only the positive chirality representation of SO15 sur-
vives When it is also left moving only the 2
 under SO11SO4E survives
This gives the same number of states as for the bosons Note that the fermionic
15 or 51 strings carry angular momentum under the spatial rotation group
SO4E but the bosonic 15 or 51 strings do not carry angular momentum

FIGURE 5 Conguration of intersecting D-branes We show two of the internal
dimensions and several types of open strings The open strings going between
1 and 5 branes are the most relevant for the black holes that we analyze
In order to be more denite about the number of massless degrees of freedom
it is necessary to know something about the interactions of these open strings
It was shown in 38 that this interaction Lagrangian is determined by super-
symmetry and gauge symmetry The 11 dimensional eld theory is a 44
supersymmetric theory which has the same amount of supersymmetry as N  2
in four dimensions or N  1 in six dimensions For simplicity we will discuss just
the bosonic part of the Lagrangian We saw in chapter 1 that the Lagrangian for
the 11 or 55 strings is the dimensional reduction of the d  10 Yang Mills
Lagrangian and a way to see this was to do T-duality transformations so that
the p-branes became 9-branes In the same spirit we do T-duality transforma-
tions that map our 1D and 5D branes into 5D and 9D branes Now we have a
six dimensional theory on the vebrane Let us denote by    0 1 2 3 4 9
the indices along the vebrane by I J  5 8 the indices perpedicular to the
vebranes and by    0  9 the full ten dimensional indices For simplicity
we will concentrate only on the bosonic part of the Lagrangian and we will give
only the bosonic part of the supermultiplets We have N1 supersymmetry in
six dimensions There are two possible supermultiplets the vector multiplet and
the hypermultiplet The vector contains a six dimensional vector eld A and
its spin 12 superpartner The hypermultiplet contains four scalar elds and the
spin 12 superpartners The ten dimensional vector A describing 55 strings
decomposes into a six dimensional vector A plus a hypermultiplet containing
the four scalars AI representing the transverse motion of the vebranes Both of
these elds are in the adjoint of the UQ1 gauge group6 The YM Lagrangian
111 has N2 supersymmetry in six dimensions and it can of course be thought
of as an N1 Lagrangian The 59 and 95 strings together form a hypermulti-
plet with elds which transform as the product of the fundamental of UQ1 and
the anti-fundamental of UQ5 and their complex conjugate These are the elds
a discussed above  was a 2 spinor under the SO4I and a and B represent
U Q1 U Q5 Chan Paton factors The other two components of this hypermul-
tiplet are their complex conjugate  a
B  The interaction Lagrangian is determined
largely by supersymmetry The only allowed coupling between vector and hyper-
multiplets is the gauge coupling The hypermultiplets could in principle have a
metric in the kinetic term but to lowest order in the string coupling this metric is
at Supersymmetry requires however some potential for the hypermultiplets
this is given by the so called D-terms no relation to D-branes They arise
when we have gauge symmetries there are three D-terms for each gauge gener-
ator One way to think about them is through the SO4I language as self dual
antisymmetric tensors DIJ  1
2 IJKLDKL such a tensor has three independent
components The potential is given by V Pa Da2
14  D-terms have
the structure Da  T a where  are components of the hypermultiplets and
T a are the gauge group generators As an example of D-terms let us consider
the pure YM Lagrangian dimensionally reduced to six dimensions The potential

In checking 41 with 42 one should use the Jacobi identity for the commuta-
tors We would have obtained the same result if we had taken the antiself dual
part of AI AJ  in 42 this a reection that the YM Lagrangian 111 really
has N2 supersymmetry as a six dimensional theory
Now let us consider the D-terms for the full theory they have the form
IJ  f a

L  T aIJ 
V XaIJ
where the index a runs over the gauge group generators rst of UQ1 and then
of UQ5 Note that the rst term involves 55 or 99 elds depending on
which generator we consider The second term is automatically self dual due to
the chirality condition of the spinor  We have not been very careful with the
precise numerical normalization of these two terms because we will not need it
in what follows The full action has the form up to numerical normalizations

where we denoted by A A the gauge elds of UQ1 and UQ5 respectively
The index a in the D-terms runs over both gauge groups
Now that we understand better the Lagrangian let us do a T-duality trans-
formation back to the 1D and 5D branes Now we have an N4 theory in two
dimensions the supermultiplets are just the dimensional reduction of the six di-
mensional ones and therefore recieve the same name Some of the components of
the six dimensional vector multiplet become scalars and they represent the mo-
tion of the D-string or the D-vebrane transverse to the vebrane The motion
of the D-string on the vebrane as well as the vebrane gauge elds transverse
to the string are hypermultiplets in this language
The BPS states that we are considering have only left moving excitations
One can view these states classically as traveling waves propagating along S1 In
order to have traveling wave solutions the mass terms have to vanish exactly If
we set all the elds in the Lagrangian to zero then we can have traveling waves for
any eld However once we have a wave for one eld the potential terms in 44
in the case of hypermultiplets or gauge couplings in the case of vector multiplets
imply that there will be mass terms for other waves as in 113 One should nd
which is the way to excite the system in such a way that a maximum number
of particles remains massless For determining the mass terms as in 113 it is
the same to consider congurations that are u  x9  t dependent or not The
problem is analogous to nding the sector of the moduli space of vacua with the
largest number of massless particles If we give some expectation value to the
scalars coming from the six dimensional vector elds then we see that we are
eectively separating the strings and vebranes and we expect a small number
of massless particles proportional to Q1  Q5 Indeed there are mass terms for
the hypermultiplets in the fundamental due to the gauge couplings AA
44 This mass term also implies that if the 15 strings condense then there
is a mass term for the transverse motion In fact a conguration with a large
number of massless particles is achieved by exciting the hypermultiplets both
the ones in the fundamental and the ones in the adjoint This gives mass to
the scalars describing the transverse motion of the branes which means that we
have a bound state The total number of components of the hypermultiplets is
54Q1Q5 In order to preserve supersymmetry we must set the potential
to zero which also minimizes the energy This implies that the D-terms 43
should vanish imposing 3Q2
5 constraints In addition we should identify
gauge equivalent congurations The number of possible gauge transformations is
5 This implies that the remaining number of massless degrees of freedom
is 4Q1Q5 The counting as we have done it here is correct for large charges
up to possible subleading corrections One can think that what we did was to
determine the dimension of the classical moduli space of vacua of this theory and
then considered oscillations around a given vacuum
1  3Q2
Let us remark for later use that in this picture the momentum is carried by
the hypermultiplets The bosonic components of the hypermultiplets do not carry
angular momentum under SO4E of the external rotations while the fermions
do indeed carry it In fact the SO4E SU2LSU2R symmetry appears as
an R-symmetry of the theory and left or right moving fermions carry spin under
SU2LR respectively 15
The state counting is the same as that of the left moving oscillator modes of
4Q1Q5 superconformal elds These modes will be carrying purely left moving
momentum In order to calculate the entropy we notice that we have a gas of
left moving particles with NBF  4Q1Q5 bosonic and fermionic species with
energy E  NR9 on a compact one dimensional space of length L  2R9 The
standard entropy formula gives 1314

in perfect agreement including the numerical coecient with 239
It is interesting to understand the relation of this description in terms of
open strings and the approach taken in the original derivation 13 In 13 the
D-strings were viewed as intantons on the UQ5 vebrane gauge theory 3867
Due to some Chern Simons couplings these instantons carry RR 1D-brane charge
38 The moduli space of these instantons is given by a 44 superconformal
eld theory with central charge c  6Q1Q5 The Q5 factor comes basically from
all the possible orientations of the instanton and this is where the entropy comes
from for large Q5 These instantons live on the vebrane and it is only when
they shrink to zero size that they become a D-string and are allowed to leave the
vebrane Note that the steps followed in determining the number of massless
open string modes above is very similar to calculations of instanton moduli spaces
in 68
In our previous argument we implicitly took the D-strings and the vebranes
to be singly wound For large N  N  Q1Q5 the entropy 45 is the same no
matter how we the branes are wound However for N  Q1 the winding starts
to matter The reason is that in order for the asymptotic formula to be correct
for low N we need to have enough states with small energies 50 Let us study
the eect of dierent wrappings We begin with an analogy from elementary
quantum mechanics Consider a circular loop of wire of unit radius whose center
is at the origin of the r  plane A bead of unit mass moves on the wire and
for obvious reasons the angular momentum of the bead is quantized in integer
multiples of h The energy spectrum is given by
for all integer l Now consider a wire which is wrapped n times around the same
circle Eq 46 still gives the energy levels if we allow l to be an integer multiple
of 1n The system simulates fractional angular momentum The real physical
system of wire plus bead must of course have integer angular momentum but the
energy spectrum may be expressed in terms of a psuedo-angular momentum
which is not the true generator of spatial rotations but rather the generator of
rotations of the bead relative to the physical wire
Next let us consider a set of Q1 1-branes wrapped on S1 ignoring for the
time being the 5-branes We may distinguish the various ways the branes inter-
connect For example they may connect up so as to form one long brane of total
length R  RQ1 At the opposite extreme they might form Q1 disconnected
loops The spectra of open strings is dierent in each case For the latter case
the open strings behave like Q1 species of 1 dimensional particles each with en-
ergy spectrum given by integer multiples of 1R In the former case they behave
more like a single species of 1 dimensional particle living on a space of length
Q1R The result 32 is a spectrum of single particle energies given by integer
Q1R  In other words the system simulates a spectrum of fractional
multiples of
charges For consistency the total charge must add up to an integer multiple of
1R but it can do so by adding up fractional charges Note that in this case as
opposed to the bead and wire example the branes by themselves cannot carry
any momentum since they are invariant under boosts along directions parallel to
the branes
Now let us return to the case of both 1 and 5 branes By suppressing
reference to the four compact directions orthogonal to x9 we may think of the
5 branes as another kind of 1 brane wrapped on S1 The 5-branes may also be
connected to form a single multiply wound brane or several singly wound branes
Let us consider the spectrum of 15 type strings strings which connect a 1-
brane to a ve-brane when both the 1 and 5 branes each form a single long
brane The 1-brane has total length Q1R and the 5-brane has length Q5R A
given open string can be indexed by a pair of indices i j labelling which loop of
1-brane and 5-brane it ends on As a simple example choose Q1  2 and Q5  3
Now start with the 1 1 string which connects the rst loop of 1-brane to the
rst loop of 5-brane Let us transport this string around the S1 When it comes
back to the starting point it is a 2 2 string Transport it again and it becomes a
1 3 string It must be cycled 6 times before returning to the 1 1 conguration
It follows that such a string has a spectrum of a single species living on a circle of
size 6R More generally if Q1 and Q5 are relatively prime the system simulates
a single species on a circle of size Q1Q5R If the Qs are not relatively prime the
situation is slightly more complicated but the result is the same For example
suppose Q1  Q5  Q again assume the 5 and 1-branes each form a single long
brane then a string will return to its original conguration after cycling around
Q times This time the system simulates Q species living on a circle of length Q
But it is also possible to remove one loop from either the 1 or 5 brane and allow
it to form a separate disconnected loop In this case we have a system consisting
of a brane of length QR one of length Q  1R and a short loop of length R
Since Q and Q  1 are relatively prime the open strings which connect them live
on an eective brane of length QQ 1R Thus there is always a way of hooking
up branes so that the eective length is of order Q1Q5R In fact we will argue
that this type of congurations give the largest entropy and will therefore be
dominant 50
It can also be seen from the original derivation of the black hole entropy
by Vafa and Strominger 13 that the system should have low energy modes
with energy of order 1RQ1Q5 In this derivation the degrees of freedom that
carry the momentum were described by a superconformal eld theory on the
orbifold T 4Q1Q5 SQ1Q5 A careful analysis of this theory shows that low
energy modes are present For example excitations with angular momentum
are associated to energies E  J 2RQ1Q5 1516 so that for small angular
momentum we are having a gap of the correct magnitude
We can easily see that this way of wrapping the branes gives the correct
value for the extremal entropy Let us consider the case where Q1 and Q5 are
relatively prime As in 14 the open strings have 4 bosonic and 4 fermionic
degrees of freedom and carry total momentum NR This time the quantization
length is R  Q1Q5R and the momentum is quantized in units of Q1Q5R1
Thus instead of being at level N the system is at level N  N Q1Q5 In place
of the original Q1Q5 species we now have a single species The result is
S  2N  2pN Q1Q5
The picture is very reminiscent of that proposed in 58 although the details
dier
The case we have been considering so far corresponds to black holes in
N  8 supergravity With these methods we can also calculate the entropy for
black holes in N  4 supergravity This theory is the low energy limit of the
heterotic string compactied on T 5 These are the dyonic black holes considered
by various authors 58 55 69 70
In that case the analogous D-brane
description takes place in the type I theory which is S-dual to the heterotic
theory Type I string theory indeed contains D-strings and D-vebranes but no
other D-branes These two D-branes correspond to the fundamental string and
the solitonic vebrane on the heterotic side 71 The D-brane counting can also
be done and it is interesting to notice that to get the correct result one must
include the 5D-brane SU2 degrees of freedom found in 68
Something remarkable has happened here We started with some congu-
ration of D-branes sitting at r  0 a point in 5-dimensional space To start
with this is a point with nothing inside it However having put all these
open strings on the branes we nd that the conguration matches a solution of
the classical low energy action such that r  0 is really a 3-sphere with non-zero
area What happened Well the ten dimensional classical solutions for D-branes
show that as we get closer to the D-brane the transverse space expands and the
longitudinal space shrinks This conguration has expanded the transverse space
in such great way that what previously was a point is now a sphere The most
exciting aspect of this is that the classical solution continues beyond the horizon
into the black hole singularity whereas according to the D-brane picture space
simply stops at r  0 States inside the horizon would have to be described by
the massless modes on the D-brane The basic horizon degrees of freedom are
denumerated by three integers the momentum the index labeling the 1-brane
and the index labeling the 5-brane When a string falls into the black hole and
crosses the horizon it turns into open strings traveling on the D-branes see g-
ure 2 There should be a mapping between the closed string degrees of freedom
like the angle on S3 where the infalling particle hit the horizon and the open
string states Of course the transformation of physical space coordinates and
open strings on the D-brane could be very complicated All of this is reminiscent
of the holographic principle 72 as well as the membrane paradigm 7374
in that dynamics occurring inside the black hole would be described as occurring
on the horizon

41 Near-Extremal 5 d Black Holes and Hawking Radiation
We now turn to a discussion of nearly extremal ve-dimensional black holes
246 Since the coupling constant 243 in these solutions is bounded in space
we can choose it to be weak everywhere This should be a favorable case for
examining the non-BPS states of the D-brane doing perturbative computations
of their interactions and comparing to the canonical expectations for the non-
extremal black holes 246 We will see that for the near-extremal case the
agreement between the two approaches is just as impressive as in the extremal
case There is however a hitch the presence of a large number of D-branes
Q1 Q5  1 amplies the eective open string coupling constant and in princi-
ple renders any perturbative analysis of horizon dynamics unreliable 13189
We think the situation may not be so desperate and will present a non-rigorous
argument that open string loop corrections might not in fact change the essen-
tial physics The near-extremal entropy was also calculated for D-branes that do
not excite the dilaton for example the three brane but the factors do not quite
agree 7576
In those cases the corresponding black holes have scalar elds
blowing up as we approach the horizon For the cases we consider the agree-
ment is precise It will be interesting to understand the origin of the numerical
disagreement for the calculations in 7576
We perturb away from the BPS limit in a macroscopically small but mi-
croscopically large fashion M  M  mass of typical excitations There
are many ways to do this by adding stringy excitations to the basic D-brane
conguration We are interested in those excitations which cause the entropy
to increase most rapidly with added energy One could add fundamental string
modes traveling on the torus but they have too small a central charge to be
relevant Massive open or closed string excitations also give a subleading contri-
bution since the entropy of a gas of these excitations increases at most as M 23
and we will nd a leading contribution going as M 12 One could have ve
p1 for a
brane excitations in any direction but that entropy increases as M
membrane of p dimensions So we conclude that the most important will be the
ones along the string There are various modes associated to the open strings
going between the various branes Some of these are massive due to the pres-
ence of a large number of left movers The ones that are massless will give the
dominant contribution and correspond as in the case of left movers to oscilla-
tions on the moduli space of vacua We are saying that the rst right moving
strings to be excited will be the ones that continue keeping the D-terms 43
zero Note the very important fact that if the branes are multiply wrapped as we
argued they had to be these excitations will be very light with masses of order
1RQ1Q5 This alone will favor these excitations over the ones we listed above
If we perturb away from a purely left-moving extremal background by adding
NR right-moving oscillations we also have to add NL  NR left-moving os-
cillations to keep the total N  NL  NR charge xed These oscillations have
4 bosons and 4 fermions so the central charge is the same as it was before The
change in left-moving entropy is proportional to N  NRN and is of order
NRNL The change in right-moving entropy is however of order pNRNL
and dominates More specically we nd that

This result agrees with 261 when the number of antibranes is zero N1  N5 
0 We can make these numbers to be zero by taking R9 to be very large 256
In that case we have the long string limit considered in 18 Notice that we are
using here the number of branes and antibranes obtained in 256
If we want to consider more general near-extremal black holes we need to
nd the contribution to the entropy due to the addition of a small amount of
antibranes We have already calculated the increase in entropy due to a small
amount of rightmovers 48 we need to nd the corresponding increments due to
N1 N5 They are presumably independent and should be added to get the total
entropy increment We have already calculated the increase due to the right and
left movers but it is not obvious what the entropy increase due to the anti-branes
will be There is however a U-duality transformation 12596760 that for
example turns anti-1-branes into right moving momentum states at the price of
some transformation of coupling and compactication radii Since the entropy
increase is independent of the coupling constant and the compactication radii
we will take the duality argument as telling us that the counting of the brane-
antibrane states is just the same as the counting of the left- and right-moving
oscillator states The net result for the entropy increment is
S cid12cid12cid12cid12anti1branes
s N1
Since the same argument applies to N5 These increments were calculated ex-
plicitly in limit in which they are dominant for small R9 or small V  in 17 The
nontrivial not completely justied assumption is that we can extrapolate those
results to a regime there the three contributions are comparable Making this
naive extrapolation we nd that the total entropy of the non-extremal solution

which agrees with the classical formula 261 when the antibrane numbers are all

This is the standard Bekenstein-Hawking result for the strict ve-dimensional
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole with the correct normalization and functional
dependence on mass Although the arguments that led us here are less than
rigorous especially the duality argument for entropies associated with branes and
antibranes the simple end result gives us some condence in the intermediate
These non-BPS states will decay The simplest decay process is a collision
of a right moving string excitation with a left moving one to give a closed string
that leaves the brane We will calculate the emission rate for chargeless particles
so that the basic process is a right moving open string with momentum p9 
nR9Q1Q5 colliding with a left moving one of momentum p9  nR9Q1Q5 to
give a closed string of energy k0  2nRQ1Q5 Notice that we are considering the
branes to be multiply wound since that is the conguration that had the highest
entropy
If the momenta are not exactly opposite the outgoing string carries
some momentum in the 9th direction and we get a charged particle Notice that
the momentum in the 9th direction of the outgoing particle has to be quantized
in units of 1R9 This means that outgoing charged particles have a very large
mass and we see that they will be thermally suppressed All charged particles
will have a masses of at least the compactication scale

We will calculate the rate for this process according to the usual rules of rel-
ativistic quantum mechanics and show that the radiation has a thermal spectrum
if we do not know the initial microscopic state of the black hole
The state of the black hole is specied by giving the left and right moving
occupation numbers of each of the bosonic and fermionic oscillators In fact the
nearly extremal black holes live in a subsector of the total Hilbert space that is
isomorphic to the Hilbert space of a one dimensional gas of massless particles of 4
dierent types either bosons or fermions This state ii can then emit a closed
string and become fi The rate averaged over initial states and summed over
nal states as one would do for calculating the decay rate of an unpolarized

We have included the factor due to the compactied volume RV  The relevant
string amplitude for this process is given by a correlation function on the disc
with two insertions on the boundary corresponding to the two open string states
and an insertion in the interior corresponding to the closed string state see
gure 3 The boundary vertex operators change boundary conditions for four
of the coordinates when we are dealing with a 15 or 51 string We consider
the case when the outgoing closed string is a spin zero boson in ve dimensions
so that it corresponds to the dilaton the internal metric internal B elds
or internal components of RR gauge elds This disc amplitude call it A is
proportional to the string coupling constant g and to k2
0 34 The reason for this
last fact is that it has to vanish when we go to zero momentum otherwise it would
indicate that there is a mass term for the open strings since one can vary the
vacuum expectation value of the corresponding closed string elds continuosly
It cannot be linear either since the amplitude is symmetric under k0  k0 and
X0  X0 at least for these polarizations of the vertex operators In conclusion
up to numerical factors
Note that performing the average over initial and sum over nal states will
just produce a factor of the form LnRn with
A  gk2
Rn 
hiaRn aR
where Ni is the total number of initial states and aR
n is the creation operator
for one of the 4 bosonic open string states The factor Ln is similar Since
we are just averaging over all possible initial states with given value of NR
this corresponds to taking the expectation value of anan in the microcanonical
ensemble with total energy ER  NRR9  NRR9Q1Q5 of a one dimensional
gas Because NR is large compared to one but still much smaller than NL we
can calculate 414 in the canonical ensemble Writing the partition function as

Now using 256 we nd

gas of left movers and the gas of right movers They are dierent because the gas
carries some net momentum Since TR  TL the typical energy of the outgoing

which exactly matches the classical result 250 It is an interesting result that
the area appeared correctly in 419 Actually the coupling constant coming
from the string amplitude A is hidden in the expression for the area area 
N S Of course it will be very interesting to calculate the coecient in
419 to see whether it exactly matches the absorbtion coecient of a large
classical black hole However it is easy to see that the absorbtion coecient is
proportional to the area for energies higher than the inverse of the Schwarschild
radius where one can calculate the cross section just from the behaviour of clas-
sical geodesics The coecient in 419 involves the cross section at energies
much lower than the inverse of the Schwarschild radius which is basically re-
lated to the temperature of the left movers This means that calculating the
absorbtion coecient for this energy requires solving the Klein Gordon equation
on the black hole background In fact the result should not depend on the inter-
nal polarizations of the outgoing particles7 The string theory calculation for 15
strings could be done using techniques similar to those in 80 Note that the gas
of antibranes is also at the temperature 420 and they also seem to contribute
to Hawking radiation Notice that if we were emitting a spacetime fermion then
the left moving string could be a boson and the right moving string a fermion
this produces the correct thermal factor for a spacetime fermion The opposite
possibility gives a much lower rate since we do not have the enhancement due
to the large L 417 Notice also that when separation from extremality is very
small then the number of right movers is small and the statistical arguments
used to derive 419 fail Classically this should happen when the temperature
is so low that the emission of one quantum at temperature T causes the tem-
perature to change by a large amount This occurs when the specic heat is of
order one corresponding to a mass dierence from extremality 81

7 Recently this question was addressed in 7778 79 They calculated 78 the
precise numerical coecient in 419 and they found that the two calculations agree
when R is very large
the classical black hole interpretation to hold this area has to be much larger
than  so g2N  1 Since we want g to be small N is very large This seems
to invalidate the perturbative D-brane picture since open string loop corrections
are of order gQ  g2N  and due to the large number Q of D-branes they are
likely to be large 13 18 9  We will try to argue that open string corrections
might in fact be suppressed We note that the loop will be in a nontrivial
background of open strings
In fact this background was crucial to obtain a
small ve dimensional coupling constant and non-zero area which implies that
somehow the D-branes might be separated from each other We suspect that
this background of open strings suppresses open string loops enabling us to get
results o extremality This is of course something to be checked in detail It is
clear however that there are some circumstances where open string backgrounds
suppress loop contributions For example compare loop contributions of n D-
branes on top of each other and n widely separated D-branes The dierence is
just a background of open string translational zero modes It could be that the
modes related to the entropy and Hawking radiation are weakly interacting while
higher energy modes might indeed recieve large corrections In this respect we
might recall an entirely dierent but apparently analogous physical situation
electrons and nuclei in a metal The low energy thermodynamics can be fairly
well reproduced by considering the electrons to be free though there are lots of
charges present In that case we have a better understanding as to which physical
questions can be answered by regarding the electrons as free and which require
taking into account the interactions Hopefully further studies of these models
will provide a similar understanding for the black hole case
Finally the fact that the perturbative D-brane treatment of non-extremal
physics gives the right results strongly suggests that there is more than a grain of
truth here We think it quite possible that open string quantum corrections are
not as large as suggested by naive estimates The skeptic is entitled to disagree
42 Extremal and Near-Extremal Four Dimensional Black Holes
The extremal black hole solution of type IIA compactied on T 6  T 4S1
S1 is constructed by wrapping Q6 D-sixbranes on the whole T 6 Q2 D-twobranes
on S1  S1 Q5 solitonic vebranes along T 4  S1 and momentum NR owing
along S1 All charges Q2 Q5 Q6 N are integers 19 The supergravity solution
was given in 267 Note that if we momentarily set Q5  0 we just simply have
a conguration which is T-dual to the one we had for the ve dimensional black
hole so that the entropy is Q2Q6N and is calculated as before in terms of open
strings going between the D-twobranes and the D-sixbranes Alternatively as in
13 we could view the D-twobranes as instantons on the D-sixbrane and then
the entropy comes from putting some left moving momentum along one direction
in the 21 dimensional eld theory whose target space is the moduli space of
these instantons T 4Q2Q6SQ2Q6 where Sq is the permutation group of q

FIGURE 8 Brane picture of a four dimensional black hole showing
how the branes are wrapped in the compact dimensions
Let us see what happens when we introduce the vebranes The vebranes
intersect the two branes along the S1 Dierent vebranes will be at dierent
positions along the S1 The two branes can break and the ends separate in T 4
when it crosses the vebrane This was derived in 8283 and it follows using
U-duality from the fact that fundamental strings can end on D-branes Hence
the Q2 toroidal twobranes break up into Q5Q2 cylindrical twobranes each of
which is bounded by a pair of vebranes The momentum-carrying open strings
now carry an extra label describing which pair of vebranes they lie in between
The number of species becomes NB  NF  4Q2Q5Q6 The number of BPS-
saturated states of this system as a function of Q2 Q5 Q6 and N follows from
the standard 1  1-dimensional entropy formula for a gas of massless particles
S  2r 2NB  NF ER9
where NB NF  is the number of species of right-moving bosons fermions E is
the total energy and 2R9 is the size of the box Using NB  NF  4Q2Q5Q6 and
E  NR9 we nd the R9-independent result for the large N thermodynamic
Sstat  2pQ2Q5Q6N 
which indeed reproduces the classical result 269 This formula can be justied
using the usual BPS arguments
This result can also be extended to black hole solutions in N  4 super-
gravity by replacing T 4 in the previous argument by K3 50 The entropy is the
same as for the N  8 case 424
Again as in the ve dimensional case the calculation leading to 424
implicitly assumed that the branes were singly wound and it is valid when N is
very large N  Q2Q5Q6 For not so big values of N the entropy comes from
In a fashion analogous
congurations where the branes are multiply wound
to the ve dimensional case this leads to just 4 species of fermions and bosons
propagating on a circle of radius RQ2Q5Q6 with the same result 424 for the
entropy Indeed the classical energy gap for an extremal black hole is 81
M 
RQ2Q5Q6
which agrees with the multiply wound D-brane result
Now we consider near-extremal four dimensional black holes 21 The sim-
plest case to consider is when the size R9 is much bigger than the rest of the
compact dimensions This corresponds to taking N2  N5  N6  0 Note that
these antibrane excitations are very massive when R9 is large When we have
both left and right movers using the above arguments we nd the entropy
S  2pN2N5N6pNR pNL
which is the classical result 282 in the limit we are considering
Now we consider the case with angular momentum again in the limit of
large R9 With just twobranes and sixbranes present the D-brane excitations of
this system are described by a 11-dimensional eld theory which turns out to be
a 4 4 superconformal sigma model 15 The vebrane breaks the right-moving
supersymmetry 84 leaving us with 0 4 superconformal symmetry The N 
4 superconformal algebra gives rise to a left-moving SU2L symmetry Since
fermionic states in the sigma model become spinors in spacetime the action of
O3 spatial rotations has a natural action on this SU2L The charge FL under
one U1 subgroup of this SU2L will then be related to the four-dimensional
angular momentum along one of the three axes carried by the left movers
by J  FL2 Due to the presence of the vebrane the right-moving SU2R
symmetry of the original 4 4 superconformal eld theory is broken and the right
movers cannot carry macroscopic angular momentum The number of states with
xed NL NR FL  1 may be computed as in 1516 to yield the entropy
S  2r c
pNR q NL 
where nL  nL  6J 2c is the eective number of left movers that one is free
to change once one has demanded that we have a given macroscopic angular
momentum For our problem the central charge is c  6N2N5N6 19 thus the
entropy 284 agrees with the D-brane formula 427
It is interesting to take the extremal limit of these rotating black holes when
the mass takes the minimum value consistent with given angular momentum and
charges This happens when nL  0 so the left movers are constrained to just
carry the angular momentum and do not contribute to the entropy When the
angular momentum is nonzero even the extremal black hole is not supersym-
metric Using 427 and writing the result in terms of the charge N  NR  NL
we nd
S  2pJ 2  N Q2Q5Q6 
which indeed agrees with the entropy of an extremal charged rotating black hole
64 Notice the surprising fact that although we derived this formula in the large
R1 regime and JM 2  1 it continues to be valid for arbitrary values of the
parameters Since this is far from the BPS state we had no reason to expect the
weak-coupling counting to continue to agree with the black hole entropy
All the worries we had about possible strong coupling eects in ve dimen-
sions are also a source of concern for these four dimensional black holes but the
successful calculation for the entropies encourages us to take this picture more
seriously The discussion on Hawking radiation also carries over with almost no
modication giving the correct Hawking temperature
5 DISCUSSION
We have studied black holes in type II supergravity compactied to ve and
four dimensions These theories have several U1 charges and we considered
black holes that carry several of these charges The extremal black holes have a
direct correspondence with a superposition of string solitons and they preserve
some of the supersymmetries For extremal black holes the entropy does not
depend on any of the continuous parameters and it is given just in terms of
the integer values of the quantized charges In addition we constructed the non-
extremal versions of these black holes This construction can be done by applying
U-duality symmetries and boosts to the standard Reissner-Nordstrom solution
in four or ve dimensions We have shown how U-duality relates the dierent
quantization conditions on the charges Black holes have some scalar charges
which are determined due to the no hair theorem by the U1 charges and the
mass If we compare the U1 charges the scalar charges and the mass with the
corresponding values for a non-interacting collection of branes and antibranes we
can calculate the number of hypothetical non-interacting constituents of the
black hole The entropy formula has a very suggestive form when it is written in
terms of these numbers
We then viewed the same collection of branes and strings from the point
of view of string theory Applying the rules for quantizing D-brane solitons we
were able to count the number of microscopic states of such congurations In
the extremal case this counting can be justied rigorously by using the standard
BPS arguments
In the near-extremal case one can certainly do the counting
on the string theory side when the coupling is very weak However in order
to compare to the black hole answer we need to make the coupling bigger It
turns out that the necesary size of the coupling is such that one might expect
large corrections However the near extremal entropy is precisely accounted for
by this weak coupling argument D-branes account for some non-perturbative
eects so the question is whether they account for all the necessary ones to
describe black holes The answer is that they seem to be doing that at least
as far as entropy calculations is concerned8 These near-extremal black holes
8 See also 777879 regarding the comparison of scattering amplitudes between
the classical approach and the D-brane approach
have many free paramenters in fact one can also consider solutions with angular
momentum For all these cases it is possible to account for the entropy indicating
that the understanding of the black hole degrees of freedom seems to be not too
far from reality The energy gap for excitations of an extremal black hole also
agrees using both methods classical and D-brane
Hawking radiation is viewed in this approach as the collision of two op-
positely moving open strings attached to the branes that decay into a closed
string that leaves the brane As expected from thermodynamics arguments the
Hawking temperature is precisely the classical result Furthermore the Hawking
radiation rate shows that the D-brane calculation knows about the geometry
since the rate is proportional to the area of the black hole The overall coe-
cient in this rate is proportional to the absorbtion cross section of the black hole
for that particular mode It will be interesting to study these more dynamical
questions to understand better whether this object really represents a black hole
or not
One might worry that we are not considering a realistic conpactication since
our world is not described by N  8 supergravity at least at small energies It
will be indeed very interesting to extend these results for the case of N  2 1 0
and see how much of this description carries over From a purely theoretical point
of view the problem of black hole entropy is as puzzling in N  8 supergravity
as it is in General Relativity but it is easier to analyse in N  8 supergravity
All our results carry over to the N  4 theory both in their type II version type
II on K3 as in the heterotic theory type I compactied on a torus
On a more speculative note we would say that if this picture were qualita-
tively right there would be no information loss the information would stay on
the open strings that live on the branes which sit at the horizon for an extremal
black hole In this picture the classical region inside the horizon would be an ef-
fective description of the dynamics of these open strings What would happen is
that an observer made of closed strings that falls through the horizon is turned
into open strings together with all his measuring apparatus so it seems plausible
that he would not notice the dierence There should be a way to describe the
subsequent dynamics in terms of some eective closed strings that falled through
the horizon Note that the problem of information loss could be analysed in
terms of near-extremal black holes Because of our lack of control on the strong
coupling problem we cannot say anything denite about information loss This
D-brane description is the description of the physics as seen by the asymptotic
observer It is for this observer that evolution should be unitary since he sees
the black hole formation and evaporation process
Let us end by saying that black holes are an excellent theoretical laboratory
for understanding some features of quantum gravity One could say that they
are the Hydrogen atom of quantum gravity It will be interesting to see what
string theory will say about this in the future
