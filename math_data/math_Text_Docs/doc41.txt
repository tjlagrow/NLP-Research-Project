Abstract Hawkings prediction of blackhole evaporation depends
on the application of known physics to fantastically high energies 
well beyond the Planck scale Here I show that before these extreme
regimes are reached another physical eect will intervene the quantum
backreaction on the collapsing matter and its eect on the geometry
through which the quantum elds propagate These eects are estimated
by a simple thought experiment When this is done it appears that there
are no matrix elements allowing the emission of Hawking quanta black
holes do not radiate

Letter to the Editor
Hawking 1974 1975 famously studied quantum elds in the presence of a
gravitationally collapsing object and predicted that black holes are not in fact black
but radiate with thermal spectra and eventually explode This work raised many
issues and forced the development of far deeper understandings of quantum eld
theory in curved spacetime than had previously been achieved Whether black holes
radiate or not these deeper foundations seem secure It is no exaggeration to say that
almost every important paper in the past twentyve years on quantum eld theory
in curved spacetime has Hawkings papers as antecedents
The strength of the argument for blackhole evaporation is at best dubious
The main diculty which was recognized almost from the outset is that Hawkings
analysis relies on the application of known physics to fantastically high energies well
beyond the Planck scale In spite of this the prediction of blackhole evaporation has
often been regarded as a cornerstone of the theory to such an extent that attempts
to quantize gravity have been judged by whether they can reproduce Hawkings
prediction in appropriate regimes Rovelli 1996 Strominger and Vafa 1996 Balbinot
and Fabbri 1999 Kummer and Vassilevich 1999 see however Belinski 1995 for another
view So it is worthwhile reconsidering Hawkings argument not just for itself but
for its implications for more ambitious theories
The kernel of the transPlanckian problem is this The predicted spectrum
corresponds to a temperature TH  hc38Gm where m is the mass and so to
wavelengths of characteristic size  8Gmc2 However the eld modes from which
these arise have been exponentially redshifted as the modes propagate away from
the collapsed object so that the original wavelengths they corresponded to in the
distant past are  Gmc2 expu4m where u is the retarded time For a solar
mass black hole the scale 4Gmc3 is on the order of milliseconds so in a fraction of
a second the energies of the modes have passed any known physical scale  including
the mass of the universe
No resolution of the transPlanckian problem is known There have been a number
of ingenious investigations which have supposed that the eect of transPlanckian
frequencies on the eld theory might be modeled by a dispersive propagation of the
quantum eld Jacobson 1991 1993 Brout et al 1995 Unruh 1995 However all of
these are guesses at what physics at very high energies will be all signicantly alter
the propagation assumed by Hawking and none seems able to reproduce Hawkings
result without introducing transPlanckian wavenumbers
It has also sometimes
been suggested that because of the very beautiful form of Hawkings results there
ought to be some sort of general invariance arguments leading to them independent
of transPlanckian physics However at present no such argument is known
In this letter I will show that before the transPlanckian regime is reached
another physical eect will have to be considered the quantum backreaction on
the collapsing matter and its eect on the spacetime geometry through which the
quantum eld propagates That this should need to be considered is at rst surprising
since for almost all purposes gravitational elds can be adequately computed by
Letter to the Editor
considering their sources as classical objects But the Hawking mechanism is not
ordinary physics It is a tiny quantum eect and it turns out to be crucially inuenced
by quantum complementarity issues involving the geometry and the collapsing matter
In what follows I shall consider only the case of spherical symmetry explicitly
but it will be evident that the physical arguments are quite general and should apply
more broadly The conventions are those of Penrose and Rindler 19846 and of
Schweber 1961 The metric has signature      For the most part factors of
G h and c are given explicitly but these are omitted where the expressions become
too cumbersome
In the spacetime exterior to the collapsing body we have the Schwarzschild metric
in the familar form
ds2  1  2mrdt2  1  2mr1dr2  r2d2  r2 sin2 d2 
and we also make use of the advanced and retarded time coordinates
v  t  r
u  t  r 
where r  r  2m  2m logr  2m2m
The general scheme of Hawkings computation is this A massless quantum eld
 is to be investigated on the spacetime corresponding to a gravitationally collapsing
object The state of the eld in the far past is quiescent say vacuum for simplicity
In principle then one should work out the eld operators in the far future in terms of
those in the far past and from this one can read o the particlecontent stressenergy
etc of the state in the far future
The leading contribution to the eld operators in the future far from the object and
after collapse has substantially occurred will be the geometricoptics approximation
We may write this as
f u  0
pvu 
where the subscripts f p stand for future and past the superscript indicates that the
elds have been conformally rescaled to attain nite limits at I  and u 7 vu is the
mapping of surfaces of constant phase from u  const in the future to v  vu in
the past
Equation 3 is remarkable in that it has the same form as a moving mirror
model a massless eld propagating in twodimensional Minkowski space and reecting
from a perfect mirror whose trajectory is given by v  vu in null coordinates Fulling
and Davies 1976 Davies and Fulling 1977 The moving mirror models were developed
after Hawkings work however and in part to help understand it Using standard
formulas from these models we may read o the particlecontent and stressenergy

Note that the key quantity that enters is the fractional acceleration vv This is
the center of the Hawking mechanism The aspect of the spacetime geometry which
controls the Hawking mechanism is vv and measurements of Hawking quanta are
essentially probes of this geometric quantity
According to classical collapse theory one has at late retarded times
vu  Gmc3 expu4m 
where the prefactor Gmc3 has been inserted for dimensional reasons only one has
no control over the constant in front of the exponential at this level of analysis From
uu i  48r21hc34Gm2
this relation and equation 4 one immediately has hbT ren
This is one of Hawkings predictions and others can be similarly recovered
The relation 5 is the one which gives rise to the transPlanckian problems But
exponential relations like 5 are never accepted unreservedly in physics While they
may apply within a particular model no model holds at arbitrarily small scales and
eventually one must ask what aspect of the model breaks down Here we shall see
that there are quantum limitations
We shall show that it is necessary to consider the quantum backreaction on the
collapsing matter and the spacetime geometry Since this is precisely a question of
how geometry is aected by quantization and we have at present no reliable theory
of quantum gravity any investigation along these lines involves some speculation
However here we are not concerned with gravitational elds which are locally very
strong in any invariant sense nor it will turn out with Planckscale physics so it
seems reasonable that we should be able to apply conventional physical principles to
understand them
Accordingly we shall consider a simple thoughtexperiment to measure vv
The idea is direct We imagine sending massless particles of a given frequency into
the collapsing body slightly before the point where they would inevitably be captured
The particles emerge and we measure their redshifts or more precisely certain ratios
of these to compute vv See gure 1
In this experiment and in any real experiment one does not measure vv at an
instant one measures an average of it over some nite time For our present purposes
the time scale of interest is  Gmc3 the characteristic time for the emission of a
Hawking quantum If vv is to be measured over such a time then the quanta used
must on arrival have frequencies 
 c3Gm However this means that the initial
quanta must have had frequencies of order 
 c3Gmv1  c3Gm exp u4m
We thus very quickly pass a point where
hc3Gmv1 
that is where the energies of the incoming quanta must exceed that of the collapsing
object By this point measurements of vv of sucient precision to correspond to
the geometry determining the Hawking phenomenon would require disturbances of the
Letter to the Editor
energy of the same order as the energy of the collapsing object itself and the whole
notion of probing a background geometry has clearly broken down
It is precisely the exponential increase in the redshift which signals the approach
to the horizon So this quantum limitation seems to probe the limits of distant
experiments to reveal the geometry of a black hole
This argument suggests that there is a quantum complementarity between a
measurements of vv to the precision which detection of Hawking quanta would
imply and b the total energy of the collapsed object Analyzing a thought
experiment can never prove
a complementarity of course but in this case the
experiment is so natural and seems so much to go to the heart of blackhole formation
that we consider the suggestion a very strong one
It is also possible to give a
mathematical corroboration of this using canonical quantization This will be done
elsewhere
This argument implies that black holes do not radiate This is because detection
of Hawking quanta would be equivalent to a measurement of vv which could not
be accomplished without giving rise to a large spread in the energy of the hole a
macroscopically large spread Hawking radiation is then forbidden by conservation
of energy there are no matrix elements available for transition from the state of
the collapsing hole to a state with emitted quanta as that nal state must involve a
toolarge spread in the energy of the hole
Erms  hH2i  hHi2 since it is an Heigenstate
This state of aairs is parallel to the familiar one for transitions in elementary
quantum systems If a Hamiltonian H0 is perturbed by a term H which is considered
to give rise to transitions then the nal H0width is typically of the order of
In the present case
because the collapsed object is very nearly at the blackhole state there is no way of
mining enough energy from it to give it a width sucient to accomodate the production
of a Hawking quantum All of the internal energy of the object is redshifted almost
innitely relative to innity and since the object is very nearly a black hole the
potential energy available to innity is nearly exhausted
These considerations are essentially new and are not addressed by earlier analyses
on conservation of energy in the Hawking process Those have been of two sorts First
as Hawking pointed out quantum eld theory predicts a negative ux of energy across
the event horizon which counterbalances the energy carried o by Hawking quanta
While true this simply does not address what accomodation the quantum state of the
collapsing matter must make to the emission of the radiation In the analogy of the
previous paragraph it is the statement that hHi  0
classical approximation Rab  12Rgab  8Gcid16T classical
The second sort of energy conservation which has been considered has been a semi
approximations have as their hypothesis that the quantum character of corrections
can be ignored

To summarize We have used a simple physical model to investigate the nature

strongly suggests that there is a quantum complementarity forbidding simultaneous
measurement of a that aspect of the geometry of spacetime controlling the
production of Hawking quanta and revealed by their detection and b the energy
of the collapsing object This complementarity becomes signicant at a scale
v  mPlm2 
where vu is the redshift factor for massless particles arriving at retarded time u
from equation 6 This point is rapidly reached in the collapse process and beyond
it the emission of Hawking quanta is forbidden by energy conservation
In this Letter I have doubted that Hawkings prediction of thermal radiation from
black holes is correct Yet I hope that I have made my debt to and admiration for
his work clear
I thank Ted Jacobson for bringing the problem of transPlanckian modes to my
attention and for patient answers to questions
