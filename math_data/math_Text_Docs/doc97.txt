Almost Certain Escape from Black Holes

Abstract Recent models of the black-hole nal state suggest that quantum information
can escape from a black hole by a process akin to teleportation These models require a
specic nal state and restrictions on the interaction between the collapsing matter and the
incoming Hawking radiation for quantum information to escape This paper investigates
escape from black holes for arbitrary nal states and for generic interactions between matter
and Hawking radiation Classical information including the result of any computation
performed by the matter inside the hole escapes from the hole with certainty Quantum
information escapes with delity  832 only half a bit of quantum information is lost
on average independent of the number of bits that escape from the hole
It has been proposed that black holes could function as quantum computers 1-2
the computational capacity of black holes can be calculated in terms of their mass and
lifetime 1-3 In order to function as a useful computer however a black hole must permit
information to escape as the black hole evaporates Recently Horowitz and Maldacena
proposed a model of black hole evaporation that imposes a nal state boundary condition
at the black-hole singularity 4 The result is a nonlinear time evolution for the quantum
states in and outside of the black hole which permits quantum information to escape
from the black hole by a process akin to teleportation Because it allows information to
escape such a model naturally allows the black hole to function as a computer whose
output is written in the outgoing Hawking radiation produced during evaporation as
envisioned in 1 The Horowitz-Maldacena model requires a specic nal state which
is perfectly entangled between the matter that formed the black hole and the incoming
Hawking radiation Whether or not quantum gravity supports such a nal state remains
to be seen In addition even with the proper nal state interactions between the incoming
Hawking radiation and the collapsing matter can spoil the unitary nature of the black-hole
evaporation 5 destroying some or all of the quantum information inside the hole 6-7
The purpose of this paper is to examine the robustness of the escape of quantum
information during black hole evaporation in nal state projection models In particular
I show that for projection onto any nal state at the singularity independent of the
exact details of quantum gravity and for almost all interactions between the matter and
incoming Hawking radiation properly encoded classical information escapes from the hole
with certainty Of the quantum information that escapes from the hole only one half a
qubit is lost on average regardless of the number of bits of quantum information in the
hole to begin with More precisely the state of the matter that formed the hole is preserved
under black hole evaporation with a delity of f  832  85 This is the delity of
escape of the entire state of the collapsing matter individual quantum bits escape with
a delity that approaches one as the number of bits in the hole becomes large Since
the delity is above the threshold for the use of quantum-error correcting codes properly
encoded quantum information can escape from the hole with delity arbitrarily close to 1
The Horowitz-Maldacena model 4 is described concisely in 5 Black holes evapo-
rate by absorbing negative-energy incoming Hawking radiation and by emitting positive-
energy outgoing Hawking radiation Let the dimension of the Hilbert space for the
collapsing matter inside the black hole be N  In the ordinary semi-classical treatment of
black-hole evaporation the incoming and outgoing Hawking radiation is in the maximally
entangled state
iinout 
Xj1 jiin  jiout
where jiin is an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space Hin of the incoming Hawking
radiation and jiout is an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space Hout of the outgoing
Hawking radiation
Let imatterin  Hmatter  Hin be the nal state onto which the collapsing matter
together with the incoming Hawking radiation is projected at the singularity Horowitz
and Maldacena postulated a form for this state of
imatterin 
Skimatter  kiin
where S is a unitary transformation acting on the matter states alone The usual analysis
of quantum teleportation shows that for states of this form the transformation from the
state of the collapsing matter to the state of the outgoing Hawking radiation is
T  matterinhiinout  SN
The factor 1N reects the fact that if this were conventional teleportation then this
particular nal state would occur only with probability 1N 2
In nal-state projection
however only one nal state can occur accordingly the nal transformation from col-
lapsing matter to outgoing Hawking radiation is renormalized and the net result is the
unitary transformation S
In the H-M model nal-state projection leads to a unitary
transformation between collapsing matter and the outgoing Hawking radiation
Comparing nal-state projection to conventional teleportation we see that the main
dierence is that nal-state projection mandates a single outcome while teleportation
allows N 2 outcomes In teleportation log2 N 2 bits must be sent from the input of the
teleporter to its output in order to reconstruct the input state In nal-state projection
log2 1  0 bits must be sent from inside the black hole to outside the black hole to
reconstruct the input state
Final state projection is an intrinsically nonlinear process and shares the virtues and
vices of other proposals for nonlinear quantum mechanical processes Escape of quantum
information from black holes via nal state projection is similar to the use of nonlinear
quantum mechanics to provide superluminal communication as described and rejected
in 8-10 to violate the second law of thermodynamics 11 or to solve NP-complete prob-
lems 12 Such nonlinear quantum eects have been investigated experimentally under
non-Planckian conditions and ruled out to a high degree of accuracy 13-16 6-7 pro-
poses similar tests of such nonlinear quantum eects in a normal environment In fact
the nonlinearity that arises from projection onto a state is a particularly powerful type
capable of allowing superluminal communication and time travel if it occurs under normal
conditions Indeed this nonlinearity must allow information to propagate over spacelike
intervals if the information is to escape from a black hole Because it occurs at a singularity
beyond an event horizon however nal state projection does not obviously allow causal
paradoxes such as time travel
Despite its somewhat dubious provenance nonlinear quantum mechanics including
nal state projection might hold sway in extreme Planckian regimes such as the black-hole
singularity At any rate in the absence of a full theory of quantum gravity we are certainly
free to postulate such an eect and to investigate its consequences
Even in the presence of nal-state projection without further assurances that go
beyond the H-M model the escape of quantum information from a black hole is by no means
certain Gottesman and Preskill 5 point out that if the incoming Hawking radiation
interacts with the collapsing matter within the black hole as is likely then the H-M
model no longer preserves quantum information In particular let the interaction between
incoming Hawking radiation and matter be given by a unitary transformation U  The
transformation between the state of the collapsing matter and the state of the outgoing
Hawking radiation is then
T  matterinhUiinout
Gottesman and Preskill note that if all U s are allowed T can be any matrix satisfying
Pmn hmTni2  1 including transformations that completely destroy the quantum
information in the matter leading to purely thermal Hawking radiation
In general if
the state Uimatterin is not perfectly entangled then some quantum information in the
matter is lost
For the purposes of using a black hole as a quantum computer the key question is
how much quantum information is lost on average due to such interactions Ill now show
that for any nal state not just the special H-M states and for almost any U  classical
information escapes from the hole with certainty and quantum information escapes from
the hole with delity  832  85 Essentially all but half a qubit of the quantum
information escapes This delity holds in the limit N  1 and is independent of the
exact number of bits escaping from the hole
it is the delity of escape for the entire
state of the collapsing matter Individual quantum bits inside the hole escape with higher
delity In the limit N  1 individual quantum bits escape from the hole with delity
arbitrarily close to 1
Let imatterin be any nal state including a product state and let U be a random
unitary transformation on the matter and incoming Hawking radiation selected according
to the Haar measure The Haar measure is the unique measure over U n that is invariant
with respect to unitary transformation In particular the nal state could be the as yet
unknown correct nal state specied by the as yet unknown correct theory of quantum
gravity Because U is selected according to the Haar measure the state
imatterin  Uimatterin
is a random pure state of the matter and incoming Hawking radiation ie a pure state
selected according to the uniform measure on the sphere in N 2 dimensions That is it is
a random state selected according to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure The random nature of
U implies that the escape of quantum information from a black hole does not depend on
details of the nal state
Because imatterin is random it is not perfectly entangled As a result black hole
evaporation will not preserve all the quantum information in the collapsing matter But
by the same token because imatterin is random it is almost perfectly entangled for
In particular a typical random state is within one half a qubit of maximum
large N 
entanglement
More precisely a random state in Hmatter  Hin can be written in Schmidt form as
imatterin  X
i
matter  i
The distribution of the Schmidt coecients  for random states is known 17-19 A
random state is almost perfectly entangled 20-21 the average entropy of entanglement
P 2
 log2 2
  is within one half bit of its maximum possible value log2 N  It is the high
entanglement of random states that leads to the escape of information from the hole
We now can calculate the average delity with which a state for the collapsing matter
elds
imatter  X
i
is transferred to the outgoing Hawking radiation
First look at what happens to the information inside the hole under nal state pro-
jection Action of U on i together with the incoming Hawking radiation followed by
projection onto the nal state imatterin yields a transformation from the matter to the
outgoing Hawking radiation
The unnormalized state of the outgoing Hawking radiation is
T  matterinhiinout
iout 
N X
i
where i
out is a basis for the Hilbert space of outgoing Hawking radiation related to the
basis i
matter for the Hilbert space for the collapsing matter via a unitary transformation
T  Because the normalization of this state depends in a nonlinear fashion on the  this
is a nonlinear transformation of the input state of the matter
Now that we know what happens to quantum states under nal state projection we
can determine what happens to the information inside the hole Start by looking at the
escape of classical information from the hole If this information is encoded in the states
i
matter then the perfect correlation embodied in the Schmidt decomposition combined
with the nonlinear eect of the nal state projection implies that all classical information
escapes from the hole down to the last bit Interestingly the complete escape of classical
information from the hole does not depend on the precise distribution of the Schmidt
coecients 
it only requires that they all be non-zero which occurs with probability
equal to 1 Properly encoded classical information escapes from the hole with certainty
Now look at how quantum information escapes from the hole Comparing the nor-
malized outgoing state of the Hawking radiation with T  times the state of the collapsing
matter we obtain
outhT imatter2  N X
22
Since a typical state has 2  1N  the state of the collapsing matter is transferred to
the state of the outgoing Hawking radiation with a delity
f  
N X

This approximate result can be conrmed using standard treatments of teleportation
with imperfectly entangled states 22 The maximum mean teleportation delity attain-
able using imperfectly entangled states with Schmidt coecients  is
N  1cid201 cid0X
2cid21
This delity is attained for the standard teleportation protocols Because escape from a
black hole via nal state projection is equivalent to teleportation with a xed measurement
outcome this is also the mean delity for escape from a black hole
The techniques of 19 now allow us to estimate the value of f  for N  1 we have
i  N

As a result for N  1 we have
f  cid0
3cid12
 85 
Quantum information escapes from the hole with delity  85 Note that in this estimate
we are approximating hcid0P 2i by hcid0P i2 in the limit that N  1
This delity is the delity for escape of the entire state of the collapsing matter The
delity of escape of individual quantum bits is higher and approaches 1 asymptotically as
N becomes large Because the escape delity lies above the threshold required for quantum
error correction 23 suitably encoded quantum information escapes from the black hole
with delity arbitrarily close to 1 Given nal-state projection escape from a black hole
is almost certain
Note that in the above demonstration of almost certain escape from a black hole via
nal state projection relies on a random interaction between the collapsing matter and the
incoming Hawking radiation As only a nite proper time exists for interaction between the
matter and the incoming Hawking radiation this interaction is not truly random What is
important for the escape of the quantum information is not true randomness however but
entanglement We have recently demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that
pseudorandom states and transformations implemented by quantum logic circuits with
O2n gates for n  log2 N qubits exhibit the same Schmidt coecient statistics as true
random states and transformations 24 Accordingly we may reasonably hope that the
nal state projection whatever it is is suciently entangled to give high delity transfer
of the state of the matter within the hole to the state of the outgoing Hawking radiation
The results of this paper suggest that if black holes evaporate via nal state projection
they might make good quantum computers The delity of transfer of quantum information
is better than what is required for robust quantum computation Indeed if all one wants is
a YesNo answer from the computation ie a classical bit then the black hole can deliver
the answer with certainty
Note however that for information to escape from the hole under the nal state
projection model the time evolution apart from the nal projection must remain unitary
as the densities of matter and energy approach the Planck scale near the singularity That
is the strategy for escaping from a black hole presented here assumes that the only source
of nonlinearity is the nal state projection Even if the time evolution apart from the
projection is unitary a person outside the hole must know the exact interaction that
occurred between the collapsing matter and the incoming Hawking radiation in order
to reconstruct the information escaping from the hole Final state projection will have to
await experimental and theoretical conrmation before black holes can be used as quantum
computers It would be premature to jump into a black hole just now
