Cells use surface receptors to estimate the concentration of external ligands Limits on the accu-
racy of such estimations have been well studied for pairs of ligand and receptor species However the
environment typically contains many ligands which can bind to the same receptors with dierent
anities resulting in cross-talk In traditional rate models such cross-talk prevents accurate infer-
ence of individual ligand concentrations In contrast here we show that knowing the precise timing
sequence of stochastic binding and unbinding events allows one receptor to provide information
about multiple ligands simultaneously and with a high accuracy We argue that such high-accuracy
estimation of multiple concentrations can be realized by the familiar kinetic proofreading mechanism
Introduction Cells obtain information about their en-
vironment by capturing ligand molecules with receptors
on their surface and estimating the ligand concentration
from the receptor activity Limits on the accuracy of such
estimation have been a subject of interest since the semi-
nal work of Berg and Purcell 1 with several substantial
extensions found recently 28 All of these assume one
ligand species coupled to one receptor species However
cells carry many types of receptors and have many species
of ligands around them The same ligands can bind to
many receptors albeit with dierent anities and vice
versa This is commonly referred to as cross-talk
In traditional deterministic chemical kinetics one can-
not estimate concentrations of more ligands than there
are receptor types Further even a weak cross-talk pre-
vents determination of concentrations of individual chem-
ical species since activity of a receptor is a function of a
weighted sum of concentrations of all ligands that can
bind to it In contrast here we argue that with cross-
talk concentration of more than one chemical species
can be inferred from the activity of one receptor pro-
vided that the entire stochastic temporal sequence of
receptor binding and unbinding events is accessible in-
stead of its mean occupancy This surprising result can
be understood by noting that a typical duration of time
that a ligand remains bound to the receptors depends on
its unbinding rate Thus observing the statistics of the
receptors unbound time durations allows estimation of
a weighted average of all chemical species that interact
with it 5 and then observing the statistics of the bound
time durations allows to tell how common each ligand is
In this article we derive these results for the simplest
problem of the class namely one receptor interacting
with two ligand species While the exact solution of the
inference problem for nding both ligand concentrations
is hard to implement using common biochemical machin-
ery we show that an accurate approximation is possible
using the familiar kinetic proofreading mechanism 9 10
The Model Consider a single receptor estimating con-
centrations of a cognate and a non-cognate ligand Fig 1
The ligands bind to the receptor with on-rates kc and
knc These are proportional to the ligand concentra-
FIG 1 The model a Two lignads cognate and non-
cognate bind to a receptor R with binding rates kc and knc
respectively The cognate unbinding rate is dened as lower
than the non-cognate one rc  rnc b Time series of re-
ceptor occupancy is used to determine both on-rates
i  and unbinding tu
tions with known coecients of proportionality Thus
estimating kcnc is equivalent to estimating the concen-
trations themselves The unbinding or o-rates rc and
rnc distinguish the two ligands rnc  rc and a cog-
nate molecule typically stays bound for longer Follow-
ing Ref 5 we estimate kc and knc from the time-series
of binding tb
i  events of a total
duration T using Maximum Likelihood techniques The
numbers of binding and unbinding events are dierent
by at most one which is insignicant since we consider
T   Thus without loss of generality we assume that
the rst event was a binding event at tb
1 and the last
one was the unbinding at tu
n We write the probability
distribution of observing the sequence tb

Finally Z is the normalization Note that here we dene
n so that the nth unbound interval
includes the incomplete unbound intervals before the
rst binding and after the last unbinding
The log-likelihood of kcnc is the logarithm of P

w r t kc and knc and setting them to zero gives the

which determines the sum of the two concentrations
showing that the estimates are negatively correlated As
in Ref 5 the total on-rate the weighted average of the
external concentrations is determined only by the aver-
age duration of the unbound interval nT u1 because
no binding is possible when the receptor is already bound
In general the ML equations cannot be solved analyt-
ically requiring numerical approaches However as all
ML estimators they are unbiased to the leading order
in n The standard errors of the ML estimates can be
obtained by inverting the Hessian matrix

evant for detection of a rare but highly specic ligand
11 12 can be investigated as well Instead we focus on
how the receptor estimates rather than detects concen-
trations of both ligands simultaneously which requires us
to investigate the full range of on-rates
To study the variability of the ML estimator we dene
its error as Ecnc  n2k
cnc the squared coe-
cient of variation multiplied by n which has a nite limit

receptor measuring a single ligand would obtain 5 We
show log10 E for dierent on- and o-rates in Fig 2
If the two ligands are readily distinguishable rc cid28 rnc
then the ligand with the dominant k has E  1 When
kc  knc E  4    5 and it grows to 10    30 for a lig-
and with a very small relative on-rate Emphasizing the
importance of the time scale separation E  100 if the
ligands are hard to distinguish rc  rnc Here in ad-
dition the correlation coecient  of the two estimates
reaches 1 because the same binding event can be at-
tributed to either ligand Finally the asymmetry of the
plots w r t the exchange of kc and knc is because the
cognate ligand can generate short binding events while
long events from the noncognate ligand are exponentially
unlikely In summary it is possible to infer two ligand
concentrations from one receptor with the error of only
1    10 times larger than for ligand-receptor pairs with no
cross talk as long as the two o-rates are substantially
dierent
Approximate solution Solving Eqs 2 3 to nd the
ML on-rates would be hard for the cell Luckily an ap-
proximate solution exists To nd it we notice that most
of the long binding events come from the cognate ligand
since the noncognate one dissociates faster Dening long
events as  b

Finally since nl cid28 n using Eq 4 we get
The variance obviously grows with T c

In other words the approximate cognate ligand concen-
tration is proportional to the number of long events

We can estimate the bias and the variance of ka

a limiting case If rc and rnc are not very dierent from
each other then T c must be much larger than the in-
verse of either of them T c cid29 r1

Then most of the variance of ka
cnc in Eqs 11 12 comes
ccid105 
from variability of nl but not T u Thus we write cid104ka

Combining these expressions we get

cid104ka
ccid105  kc  kncerncrcT c
Thus for large T c the bias of the approximate estima-
tor kncerncrcT c
 grows with the relative number of
noncognate long bindings events In turn the latter is
proportional to knc but decreases exponentially with T c
Within the same approximation the variance of the es-
timator is 2ka
 But long binding events
are rare independent of each other and hence obey the
Poisson statistics Thus 2nl  cid104nlcid105 so that

Knowing that the bias and the variance of the approx-
imation change in opposite directions with T c we can
nd the optimal cuto by minimizing the overall error
or in other words solving the bias-variance tradeo
T c  arg min

where L is the sum of the squared bias and the variance
of the estimator Near the optimal cuto the bias is
small and we use kc instead of ka

estimator Eq 14 Then solving Eq 15 gives

Plugging this into Eqs 13 14 we can get the minimal
error of the estimator which we omit here for brevity
The optimal cuto is  1rnc if rnc cid29 rc and it grows
with rc allowing for better disambiguation of cognate
and noncognate events Crucially the o-rates are spec-
ied with the ligand identities In contrast the on-rates
kcnc are what the receptors measures Therefore it is
encouraging that T c depends only logarithmically on the
on-rates and also on the duration of the measurement
T u xing T c as T c at some xed values of kcnc re-
mains near-optimal for a broad range of on-rates To
illustrate this we use T c  T c kc  knc  12  T0

ML solution is bad cf Fig 2 Note also that both Lc

cause our main assumption that almost all long events
are cognate holds better when cognate ligands dominate
Finally the correlation coecient between the approxi-
mate estimates a right panel reaches -1 earlier than
in Fig 2 This is a direct consequence of Eqs 11 12
Kinetic Proofreading for approximate estimation The
approximate solution can be computed by cells using
the well-known kinetic proofreading KPR mechanism
9 10 13 14 In the simplest model of KPR 15 inter-
mediate states between an inactive and an active state of
a receptor delay the activation Thus bound ligands can
dissociate before the receptor activates at which point
it quickly reverts to the inactive state Since rc  rnc
cognate ligands dominate among bindings that actually
lead to activation The resulting increase in specicity
in various KPR schemes has led to their exploration in
the context of detection of rare ligands 11 12 14 and
here we extend them to measurement of concentration of
cognate and noncognate ligands simultaneously
Consider a biochemical network in Fig 4 the receptor
R activates two messenger molecules A and B The
rst one is activated with the rate kA whenever the re-
ceptor is bound The second one is activated only if the
receptor stays bound for longer than a certain T c with
the delay achieved using the KPR intermediate states
The activation rate after the delay is kB The molecules
deactivate with the rates rA and rB respectively and all
FIG 4 Kinetic Proofreading for estimating multiple
concentrations Molecules A and B are produced when the
receptor is bound but A is produced only for long bindings
Another chemical species C subtracts A from B so that A
approximates kc and C approxiates knc

cause bindings only happen to unbound receptors as
emphasized in Ref 5 However these nonlinear rela-
tions are still hard to implement with simple biochem-
ical components We solve this by further assuming
  AkArA cid28 1 which is true if the receptor is
mostly unbound both on-rates are small compared to
the respective o-rates This gives

These equations are analogous to Eqs 11 12 They are
easy to realize biochemically cf Fig 4 kc is related to
the concentration of the proofread species B by a rescal-
ing and knc comes from subtracting rescaled versions of
A and B from each other The subtraction can be done
by the third species C activated by A and suppressed
by B Since  cid28 1 then A and B are small and many
such activation-suppression schemes are linearized as the
subtraction 8

The bias of ka
erc T c 1
cnc due to long but noncognate binding
events Eq 13 carries over to kKPR
cnc  However there
is an additional contribution since the time to traverse
the intermediate states is random Thus T c has some
variance 2
T c 15 16 This variability changes the rate of
occurence of long biding events but they are still rare
nearly independent and Poisson-distributed Denoting
by cid104cid105 the averaging at a xed T c and by  the averaging
over T c we get
cid104nlcid105
T c eectively renormalizes the cuto to T c 
Thus 2
2 rc2
T c  which is independent of the on-rates Replac-
ing T c in Eqs 21 22 by its renormalized value which
is an easy change in the scaling factors removes this ad-
ditional bias due to the random T c in the KPR scheme
Since long bindings are rare the variance of the KPR
estimator is dominated again generally by B but not A
The intrinsic stochasticity in production of molecules of
B contributes to the variance However this contribution
can be made arbitrarily small by increasing kB and we
neglect it here A larger contribution comes from the
random number of long bound intervals and a random
duration of each of them To calculate this in the limit
of rare long binding events we use well-known results in
the theory of noise propagation in chemical networks 17

Discussion The realization of Refs 5 18 and oth-
ers that the detailed temporal sequence of binding and
unbinding events carries more information about the lig-
and concentration than the mean receptor occupancy is
a conceptual breakthrough
It parallels the realization
in the computational neuroscience community that pre-
cise timing of spikes carries more information about the
stimulus than the mean neural ring rate 1924 and it
has a potential to be equally impactful This extra in-
formation when measuring one ligand concentration with
one receptor 5 amounted to increasing the sensing ac-
curacy by a constant prefactor or equivalently getting
only a nite number of additional bits from even a very
long measurement 25 In contrast here we show that
two concentrations can be measured with one receptor
with the variance that decreases inversely proportionally
to the number of observations n Eq 14 or to the inte-
gration time 1rB Eq 24 so that the accuracy is only
a small prefactor lower than would be possible with one
receptor per ligand species Asymptotically this doubles
the information obtained by the receptor 25
In principle one can measure more than two concen-
trations similarly as long as all species have suciently
distinct o-rates While the error the variance for the
ML estimator and both the bias and the variance for
the approximate and the KPR estimators would grow
with a larger number of ligand species this would still
represent a dramatic increase in the information gained
by the receptor that keeps track of its precise temporal
dynamics rather than just the average binding state
Crucially such improvement would not be possible
without the cross-talk or binding among noncognate lig-
ands and receptors Normally the cross-talk is consid-
ered a nuisance that must be suppressed 26 27
stead we argue that cross-talk can be benecial by re-
cruiting more receptor types to measure concentration
of the same ligand
In particular this allows having
fewer receptor than ligand species potentially illuminat-
ing how cells function reliably in chemically complex en-
vironments with few receptor types Further the cross-
talk can increase the dynamic range of the entire system
a ligand may saturate its cognate receptor preventing
accurate measurement of its high concentration but
it may be in the sensitive range of non-cognate recep-
tors at the same time Finally the increased bandwidth
may lead to improvements in sensing a time-dependent
ligand concentration 11 18 We will explore such many-
to-many sensory schemes extending ideas of Ref 28 to
tracking temporal sequences of activation of receptor and
to varying environments in forthcoming publications
While the exact maximum likelihood inference of mul-
tiple concentrations from a temporal binding-unbinding
sequence is rather complex we showed that when the
cognate and the non-cognate o-rates are substantially
dierent there is a simpler approximate but accurate
inference procedure
In various immune system prob-
lems rncrc  5 which would allow the approximation
to work Moreover when the receptor is not saturated
and spends most of its time unbound this inference can
be performed by biochemical motifs readily available to
the cell Namely one needs two branches of activation
downstream of the receptor with one of them having a
kinetic proofreading KPR time delay and then an esti-
mate of the dierence of activities of the branches This
suggests a possible signal estimation role for the KPR
scheme in addition to the more traditional signal detec-
tion one 11 12 18 Such branching and merging of
signaling pathways downstreams of a receptor is com-
mon in signaling 27 29 Thus exploring the function of
such complex organization in the context of estimation
of multiple signals with cross-talk is in order
In summary monitoring precise temporal sequences of
receptor activationdeactivation opens up new and excit-
ing possibilities for environment sensing by cells
