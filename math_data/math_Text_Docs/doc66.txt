Single receptor-ligand bonds have nite lifetimes so that biological systems can dynamically
react to changes in their environment In cell adhesion adhesion bonds usually act cooperatively
in adhesion clusters Outside the cellular context adhesion clusters can be probed quantitatively
by attaching receptors and ligands to opposing surfaces Here we present a detailed theoretical
analysis of the stochastic dynamics of a cluster of parallel bonds under shared constant loading and
with rebinding Analytical solutions for the appropriate one-step master equation are presented for
special cases while the general case is treated with exact stochastic simulations If the completely
dissociated state is modeled as an absorbing boundary mean cluster lifetime is nite and can be
calculated exactly We also present a detailed analysis of uctuation eects and discuss various
approximations to the full stochastic description
INTRODUCTION
Cells in a multicellular organism adhere to each other and to the extracellular matrix through a large variety of
dierent receptor-ligand bonds 1 Although not probed this way in traditional anity experiments adhesion bonds
in physiological situations usually have to function under mechanical load For example cell-matrix adhesion in con-
nective tissue is mainly provided by focal adhesions which are based on transmembrane receptors from the integrin
family connecting the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix Focal adhesions of broblasts the main cell
type in connective tissue are usually loaded by actomyosin contractility in particular during tissue maintenance and
wound healing An important class of adhesion contacts in endothelial sheets are adherens junctions which are based
on transmembrane receptors from the cadherin family connecting the actin cytoskeletons of dierent cells Endothe-
lial tissue often is subjected to considerable external stress and strain for example in lung and blood capillaries
Leukocytes circulating with the blood ow tether to and roll on vessel walls through transmembrane receptors from
the selectin family connecting the actin cytoskeleton to carbohydrate ligands on the opposing surface Here contact
dissociation is accelerated due to the shear ow pulling on the cells In general there are many more physiological
conditions in which adhesion clusters are subject to forces arising from intra- or extracellular processes including cell
motility development and angiogenesis
During recent years the behavior of dierent adhesion bonds under force has been investigated extensively on the
level of single molecules by dynamic force spectroscopy 2 3 4 This eld has been pioneered by AFM-experiments
by the Gaub group 5 and later put onto a rm theoretical basis by Evans and Ritchie 6 Because bond rupture
can be modeled in the framework of Kramers theory as thermally assisted escape over one or several transition
state barriers bond strength is a dynamic quantity which depends on loading rate Experimentally this prediction
has been impressively conrmed for dierent molecular systems 7 8 9 10 Dynamic force spectroscopy has been
implemented with dierent experimental techniques including atomic force microscopy 7 laser optical tweezers
8 and the biomembrane force probe 9 10 The behavior of molecular bonds under force can also be probed in
parallel plate ow chambers Here usually the loading process is much faster than bond dissociation which therefore
eectively occurs under constant load 11 12 By now dynamic force spectroscopy has shown that adhesion bonds
feature a much more complicated behavior under force than suggested by the traditional anity experiments in
solution 13 Using concepts from the theory of stochastic dynamics 6 14 15 16 17 a binding energy landscape
can be reconstructed from the experimental data During recent years this has been accomplished for many dierent
adhesion receptors including integrins 18 19 cadherins 20 and selectins 21 22 However while dynamic force
spectroscopy up to now has mainly been applied to single bonds in physiological settings adhesion receptors usually
operate cooperatively within clusters 23 Therefore the physical description of single adhesion bonds under force
now has to be extended to clusters of adhesion bonds under force Clusters also open up the possibility of rebinding of
broken bonds which is known to be essential to achieve physiological lifetimes of adhesion clusters For single bonds
rebinding usually cannot be studied due to elastic recoil of the force transducer after bond rupture 2 In contrast
for adhesion clusters open bonds can rebind as long as other bonds are closed thus keeping the spatial proximity
required for rebinding Only if the completely dissociated state is reached rebinding becomes impossible and the
cluster disintegrates as a whole
Although it is clear that force leads to accelerated cluster dissociation it is usually not known how it is distributed
over the dierent closed bonds in dierent situations of interest In many cases most prominently in rolling adhesion
only few of the dierent bonds are loaded to an appreciable degree thus dissociation occurs in a peeling fashion
24 25 26 However due to geometrical reasons even in this case there will be a subset of bonds which are loaded
to a similar extend In the same vein the loading situation at focal adhesions can also be expected to be rather
complicated For the case of homogeneous loading one further has to distinguish between loading through soft and
sti springs 27 In the latter case all bonds are equivalent and a mean eld description can be applied 28 In the
rst case force is shared equally between all closed bonds and the coupling between the dierent bonds in the adhesion
cluster is non-trivial Recently dynamic force spectroscopy has been applied to this case for the rst time 29 Here
a vesicle functionalized with appropriate ligands is sucked into a micropipette and pressed onto a cell On retraction
the vesicle is peeled o from the outside to the inside of the contact region However due to rotational symmetry
around the micropipette axis all bonds in a ring around the periphery of the contact area share the homogeneous
loading
The equilibrium properties of adhesion clusters has been theoretically studied before 23 30 31 32 mainly in
reference to experiments on vesicle adhesion through specic ligand-receptor pairs 33 34 35 For the non-equilibrium
dissociation of adhesion clusters under force a deterministic model has been introduced in a seminal paper by Bell
23 This model has been mainly used to study more specic problems for example leukocyte rolling in shear ow
36 Recently the deterministic Bell-model has also been extended to treat linear loading of a cluster of adhesion
bonds which usually is applied in dynamic force spectroscopy 27 28 A stochastic version of the Bell-model has
been introduced but studied only in the large system limit and for specic parameter values 37 Later the stochastic
model has been treated with reliability theory in the special case of vanishing rebinding 38 Other special cases of
the stochastic model have been treated in order to evaluate specic experiments for example the binding probability
between ligands and receptors on opposing surfaces as a function of contact time 34 39
In this paper we use the stochastic version of the Bell-model to study the case of constant shared loading in
comprehensive detail In contrast to applications to specic experiments we focus on generic features of the stochastic
dynamics of a cluster of parallel bonds under shared constant loading and with rebinding A short report on our main
results has been given before 40 As shown elsewhere the same stochastic framework as used here for the case of
constant loading can also be used to study the case of linear loading 41 Compared with the deterministic model the
stochastic model has several advantages rst only the stochastic model allows to treat the experimental situation that
rebinding becomes impossible once the completely dissociated state has been reached Second it includes uctuations
and non-linear eects which are important for small adhesion clusters Third using the well-developed theory on
master equations the stochastic model allows to derive analytical results for cluster lifetime as a function of cluster
size rebinding rate and force which are very helpful in evaluating adhesion experiments including rolling adhesion
In the following we consider the situation in which a certain number of bound adhesion receptors has been clustered
and connected to some force-bearing structure We then ask how strongly the force accelerates dissociation and in
which sense dissociation can be balanced by rebinding Since we are concerned with generic features of contact
stability our model does not consider spatial or concentration degrees of freedom In Sec II we dene the stochastic
variant of the deterministic Bell-model which has three dimensionless parameters Next we introduce the appropriate
one-step master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of an adhesion cluster under shared constant force and
with rebinding We also explain how this master equation can be solved numerically with the Gillespie algorithm
for exact stochastic simulations In the two following sections we discuss two special cases of the model in which
considerable analytical progress can be made In each case we rst discuss deterministic results and then turn to
the full stochastic model In Sec III we discuss the case of vanishing rebinding In this case broken bonds cannot be
reformed and the number of closed bonds in the adhesion clusters decreases in a unique sequence of rupture events
This can be used to construct a solution for the master equation and to derive an expression for the average lifetime
of an adhesion clusters In Sec IV we discuss the case of vanishing force In this case we deal with a linear problem
and analytical solutions of the master equation can be derived for a reecting boundary They can be used in turn
to derive an approximation for the case with an absorbing boundary Cluster lifetime can be calculated exactly as
mean rst passage time using Laplace techniques In Sec V we consider the general case with nite rebinding and
nite force Although full analytical solutions are only feasible in the case of small clusters cluster lifetime can be
calculated exactly for arbitrary cluster size For larger clusters full solutions of the master equation are obtained
by exact stochastic simulations Simulations are also essential to characterize single unbinding trajecories and to
understand the role of uctuations We close in Sec VI with a discussion of experimental issues

II MASTER EQUATION
A Derivation
The rupture of molecular bonds can be modelled in the framework of Kramers theory as thermally activated escape
over a transition state barrier 6 14 15 Assuming an innitely sharp transition state barrier leads to the so-called
Bell equation for the single molecule dissociation rate as a function of force k  k0eFFb 23 Here the force scale
Fb  kBT xb is set by thermal energy kBT and the distance xb between the potential minimum and the transition
state barrier along the reaction coordinate of rupture For a typical value xb  1 nm and physiological temperature
T  300 K we nd the typical force scale Fb  4 pN Physiological loading has indeed been found to be in the pN-
range both for cell-matrix adhesion 43 44 45 and rolling adhesion 11 46 Values for k0 and Fb have been measured
during recent years with dynamic force spectroscopy for dierent receptor-ligand systems including integrins 18 19
cadherins 20 and selectins 21 22 While the dissociation rate k depends mainly on the internal structure of a
bond the association rate kon includes the formation of an encouter complex and therefore depends on the details
of the situation under consideration It is very dicult to determine kon experimentally especially in the case of
cell adhesion when the interacting molecules are anchored to opposing surfaces 34 39 47 In order to focus on
the generic features of cluster stability here we assume that kon is a force-independent constant in accordance with
earlier theoretical work 23 27 36 37 Future modelling might rene this assumption considering for example the
eect of ligand-receptor separation controlled by polymeric tethers 48 49 50
For the following it is convenient to use dimensionless quantities We dene dimensionless time   k0t dimen-
sionless force f  FFb and dimensionless rebinding rate   konk0 The dimensionless single molecule dissociation
rate is kk0  ef  We consider a cluster with a constant number of Nt bonds which initially are all closed and
then undergo rupture and rebinding according to the appropriate rates Since bond rupture is a discrete process the
stochastic dynamics of the bond cluster can be described by the one-step master equation 51
 ri1pi1  gi1pi1  ri  gipi 
where pi  is the probability that i bonds are closed at time   Here the ri and gi are the reverse and forward rates
between the possible states i 0  i  Nt They follow from dissociation and association rates of single bonds as
ri  ri  ief i
and gi  gi  Nt  i 
Our model has three parameters namely cluster size Nt rebinding rate  and force f  Since i  0 should be
guaranteed at any time r0  0 has to be set for f  0 in addition to the denitions in Eq 2 Moreover Eq 2
implies g0  0 that is after rupture of the last closed bond new bonds are allowed to form This corresponds to
a reecting boundary of the master equation at i  0 As explained above in biological and biomimetic situations
rebinding of the completely dissociated state is usually prevented by elastic recoil of the transducer Therefore in the
following we set g0  0 in order to model an absorbing boundary at i  0 Because the values for r0 and g0 do not
follow the general form given in Eq 2 the boundary at i  0 is an articial boundary Concerning the upper end
of the set of states at i  Nt the form gNt  0 represents a reecting boundary and guarantees i  Nt Thus the
upper boundary is a natural boundary of the master equation
A quantity of large interest is the average number of closed bonds N    hii  PNt
equation Eq 1 one can derive 52
i1 ipi  From the master
 hrii  hgii 
If ri and gi were both linear functions in i Eq 3 would become an ordinary dierential equation for N  This
suggests to study the deterministic equation
 rhii  ghii  N ef N  Nt  N 
as has been done by Bell 23 Below we will see that the analysis of this equation gives valuable insight into the
generic features of our model However it is important to note that for f  0 the reverse rate ri in Eq 2 is
non-linear in i and the average in Eq 3 cannot be taken Instead lower moments are related to higher moments and
one arrives at a complicated hierarchy of coupled dierential equations The solution of the deterministic equation
Eq 4 will therefore deviate from the average number of closed bonds obtained from the solution of the master
equation Eq 1 The same problem arises for the higher moments For example for the variance 2
N  hi2i  hii2
one can derive 52
 hgi  rii  2hi  hiigi  rii 
where again the average cannot be taken As an approximate treatment one can expand ri in a Taylor series around
the average for i hii  N 51 Restricting the expansion to second order thus assuming a Gaussian distribution
leads to the following equations
 N ef N  Nt  N   2
 N ef N  Nt  N   2
N ef N f 2
Ncid18ef Ncid182 
2N 3cid19  cid19 
In principle these equations can be solved by numerical integration However it is much more instructive to consider
the original master equation Moreover the deterministic equation Eq 4 and its improved version Eq 6 cannot
describe the eect of an absorbing boundary at i  0 In order to consider this experimentally relevant case one has
to study the master equation Eq 1 with the rates given in Eq 2 Finally only the full stochastic analysis reveals
the detailed eect of uctuations
B Numerical solution
Below we will present analytical solutions for several special cases of the master equation In the general case
we numerically solve the master equation by Monte Carlo methods In detail for each set of parameter values Nt
f and  we generate between 104 and 106 trajectories with the help of the Gillespie algorithm for exact stochastic
simulations 53 54 By averaging for given time  over the dierent simulation trajectories we obtain the desired
probability distributions pi Nt
i0 In general it is also rather instructive to study single simulation trajectories
because their specic features are expected to be characteristic also for experimental trajectories
The Gillespie algorithm was originally developed for exact simulation of the stochastic dynamics of coupled chemical
reactions Applied to our case open and closed bonds correspond to two dierent species of molecules and the
transition between these two species that is rupture and rebinding correspond to chemical reactions The Gillespie
algorithm is very ecient because rather than discretizing time in small steps it generates jumps between subsequent
reactions The basic quantity of the Gillespie algorithm is the probability P   0 Xd that the next reaction
occurs in the time interval 0   0    d  and is of type  under the condition that at time 0 the system is in
state X In our case  has only two values corresponding to rupture and rebinding and the state X of the system
is completely described by the number of closed bonds i Since the rupture and rebinding rates from Eq 2 are
constant between subsequent events P does not depend on absolute time 0 In fact it reads
where P0 is the probability that no reaction occurs in the time interval 0   and a is the reaction rate for reaction
 P0 satises the dierential equation
P   0 X  P   i  P0 ia
  X
a P0 
and the initial condition P00  1 therefore P0 i  eP  a  P   i is properly normalised to unity as can
be shown by integrating over time and summing over reactions The Gillespie algorithm generates trajectories in
which subsequent reactions are separated by the following rule In the absence of other reactions the probability for
a reaction  in the time interval    d  is given by
The integral
p   aea d 
F  Z 
p d   1  ea
is the probability for a reaction occuring until time   It increases strictly monotonically from 0 to unity and thus
can be inverted In order to generate a random variable  which is distributed according to Eq 10 one generates
a random number  which is uniformly distributed over the interval 0 1 and inserts it into the formula
  
This is done for each type of reaction leading to a set of times  The time for the next reaction is then chosen as the
smallest  that is   min As shown in 53 54 this rule generates trajectories with the correct distribution
of times and types of subsequent reactions With the forward and reverse rates Eq 2 for rebinding and unbinding
of molecular bonds in the cluster the random times are determined by the functions
f  
Nt  i
and r  
ief i 
This algorithm is exact in the sense that the only sources of inaccuracy lie in the choice of the random number
generator and the nite number of trajectories used to calculate probability distribution
III VANISHING REBINDING
A Deterministic analysis
We start our analysis with the case of vanishing rebinding   0 Then the deterministic equation Eq 4 reads
In principle the total number of bonds Nt is irrelevant in this case However it is reintroduced through the initial
condition N 0  Nt Then Eq 14 is solved implicitly by 23

z is the exponential integral Unfortunately the inversion for N   is not possible in
where Ez  R

z dzez
In the deterministic description cluster lifetime Tdet can be identied with the time  at which only one last bond
exists Setting N Tdet  1 in Eq 15 gives
Tdet  Ecid18 f
Ntcid19  E f  
From this result we can extract three dierent scaling regimes For small force f  1 we use the small argument
expansion of the exponential integral Ez    lnz where   0577 is the Euler constant and nd
This corresponds to the familiar case of radioactive decay when the dierential equation dNd  N leads to
exponential decay N  Nte 
For intermediate force 1  f  Nt we can rewrite Eq 16 for the cluster lifetime as the sum of two integrals
Tdet  ln Nt 
Tdet Z 1
1 dzezz  R f
The second integral can be estimated to be R f
can expand the integrand for small arguments leading to R 1

Nt  f  the second integral can be neglected and we have
f cid19 
1 dzez  e1  ef  e1 For the rst integral we
dz1  zz  lnNtf  Since
dzezz  R 1
For the time evolution of the cluster both exponential integrals in Eq 15 can be replaced by the small argument
approximation as long as N  f and hence the exponential decay proceeds until the force per bond is f N  1
Thereafter the decay will be faster than exponential due to the destabilizing eect of force
For large force f  Nt the second term in Eq 16 can be neglected and we can use the large argument approxi-
mation for the exponential integral Ez  ez1  z leading to 23
Tdet 
ef Nt
1  f Nt
Therefore cluster lifetime decays faster than exponential with f Nt in this regime Now the small argument approxi-
mation is not applicable to either of the two terms in Eq 15 and the decrease in N will be faster than exponential
over the whole range of time
In summary the analysis of the deterministic equation Eq 14 allows to identify three scaling regimes of small
intermediate and large force This analysis also shows that f Nt is an important scaling variable which we will
therefore use to analyse also the stochastic case
B Stochastic analysis
For nite force f  0 the reverse rate ri in Eq 2 is non-linear in i and the boundary at i  0 is articial
Therefore the master equation in general cannot be solved with standard techniques However in the case of vanishing
rebinding   0 one can use the fact that the decay of the cluster corresponds to a unique sequence of events with
the number of closed bonds decreasing monotonously from Nt to 0 The transition from state i with i closed bonds
present to the state i  1 with one more broken bond is a Poisson process with the time-independent rate ri If i
bonds are present at time   the probability that the next bond ruptures at time     is given by
pii1   rieri 
The state probability pi1 is related to the state probability pi and the transition probability pii1 by the recursive
expression

FIG 2 The state probability pi  is the probability that i bonds are closed at time  0  i  Nt Here the pi are plotted
as a function of time  for a cluster of initial size Nt  10 for   0 and a f  0 b f  1 c f  10 and d f  50
which uses the fact that the state i  1 can be reached only through the state i This scheme is solved by

as can be shown by induction The properties of this expression follow from the properties of the reverse rate
ri  ief i which for nite force f  0 is a non-monotonous function of i It diverges for i  0 has a minimum
at i  f  the integer closest to f  and grows as i for i   In the unlikely case that the value of f is such that
rj  rk for j 6 k the limit of the expression in Eq 23 for rk  rj has to be taken carefully In order to
treat this case properly one has to replace Eq 23 by

equation that is the state probabilities pi  from Eq 23 for Nt  10 and four dierent values of force f  For small

force all states are appreciably occupied during the decay that is each of the curves is a maximum of the set of curves
during a certain period of time In the long run p0 approaches unity and all other pi disappear because without
rebinding the cluster has to dissociate eventually For increasing force the shape of the curves changes considerably
Now the lower states with small number of closed bonds i hardly become occupied during the decay process For
very large force the maximum occupancy changes directly from the initial state Nt over to the detached state 0
With the help of the exact solution Eq 23 any quantitiy of interest can now be calculated One quantity of large

For increasing Nt the corresponding expressions become increasingly cumbersome In general N t is a sum of Nt
exponentials with the dierent relaxation rates ri with 1  i  Nt For small force f  1 ri  i and the smallest
rate corresponds to i  1 that is N  e on large time scales In this case clusters of any size decay with the
same slope as single bonds and the dierence between single and multiple bond rupture lies in the prefactor not in
the time-scale of average decay For intermediate force 1  f  Nt and large time scales decay is dominated by
i  f  that is N  ef e  Thus the absolute value of force governs the long time behavior with dierent sizes
FIG 4 Average number of closed bonds N as a function of time  for Nt  8 and 16 and a f Nt  01 and b f Nt  1
Solid and dashed lines are stochastic and deterministic results respectively
FIG 5 Single simulation trajectories solid lines compared with the average number of closed bonds N   dashed lines for
Nt  10 and 25 and a f Nt  01 and b f Nt  1 In b in addition the deterministic results are plotted as dotted lines
showing up only in the prefactor For large force f  Nt decay at large time scales is dominated by i  Nt that
is N  eNtef Nt   This implies that for a given force f  the largest clusters show the slowest decays in the long
run However if one controls f Nt rather than f  the cluster with the smallest size will decay the slowest since it is
subject to the smallest absolute force In Fig 3 we plot log N as a function of time  for dierent values of cluster
size Nt and force per initial bond f Nt All curves initially show an exponential decay with the rate of a single bond
For small forces decay stays exponential for almost all times The larger force the earlier decay crosses over to the
late stage regime of super-exponential decay
As noted in Sec II due to the non-linear form of ri  ief i for f  0 the rst moment N   of the stochastic
solution Eq 23 is not identical with the function N   obtainted from the deterministic equation Eq 14 In Fig 4
results for N   derived from the deterministic and the stochastic description are compared to each other For a small
but non-zero force the non-linearity is small and the agreement between the two results is good in the initial phase of
the decay Towards the end of the decay strong deviations are observed Here the force on each bond grows strongly
and the non-linearity of the transition rates is large For increasing force uctuations become less relevant and the
deviation between deterministic and stochastic results is increasingly restricted to the very end of the decay process
In Fig 5a and b the result for the mean number of closed bonds N   is compared to single simulation trajectories
for small and large forces respectively The single simulation trajectories are expected to resemble experimental
realizations for the time evolution of the number of closed bonds The gure shows that for small force the trajectories
decay in a similar way as does the average For large force the trajectories decay in a more abrupt way than the
FIG 6 Probability for dissociation of the whole cluster D as a function of time  for Nt  1 2 4 8 and 16 for a f Nt  00
b 01 c 10 and d 50
averages that is they appear to run along the average for most of the time but then decay rather abruptly towards
the completely dissociated state In this case uctuations do not so much aect the typical shape of the rupture
trajectory but rather the timepoint of rupture The reason for this typical behavior is that a large uctuation towards
the absorbing boundary inevitably leads to a runaway process since force is increasingly focused on less and less bonds
due to shared loading This type of rupture process is similar to avalanches or cascading failures in highly connected
systems Although rupture is rather abrupt its timepoint is widely distributed leading to the smooth decrease of
N   observed in the average In the large force case in Fig 5b we also show the deterministic results for N   for
the small force case in Fig 5a they hardly dier from the stochastic results These curves show that the abrupt
decay of single simulation trajectories at large force is somehow predicted by the deterministic description compare
Fig 4 This had to be expected because the deterministic equation describes a representative yet single trajectory
The probability for dissociation of the overall cluster that is for rupture of the last bond is dened by D  
p0   r1p1  and follows from Eq 23 with the reverse rate r1 from Eq 2 The resulting formula has been given
before in Ref 38 For a single bond it is simply D   ef eef   For Nt  2 we have
In the special case f  2 ln 2 the two rates r1 and r2 are equal and we have

D   16 e4 
In general as for N   D  is a sum of exponentials eri and the decrease on long time scales is governed by the
exponential which decreases the slowest In Fig 6 we plot D  for dierent values of Nt and f Nt by controlling f Nt

horizontal curves are the harmonic numbers which are good approximations in the small force regime f  1 The dotted
curve is the approximation T  ln 061Ntf  for the intermediate force regime 1  f  Nt
rather than f  the curves have comparable averages The case Nt  1 is a Poisson process with simple exponential
decay For Nt  1 D0  0 because instantaneous rupture of all bonds at   0 is a higher order process For large
times all curves decay exponentially For vanishing force f  0 the curves are very similar with the same slope at
large times The maxima of the cluster dissociation rates for f  0 are described by Tmax  ln Nt in agreement with
the result Eq 17 from the deterministic description For small f Nt the distributions are Gauss-like with small
asymmetry and variance For large f Nt they became Poisson-like that is they develop a strong asymmetry with
a maximum close to zero and a pronounced long-time tail The reason is that in this case decay is dominated by
rupture of the rst bond that is we are eectively back to a single bond system except that D0  0 as always for
multiple bonds
The average cluster lifetime can in principle be calculated as the rst moment of the overall dissociation rate

In practice it has a simple form which can be derived without using the probability distribution Eq 23 The waiting
time spent in state i before the transition into state i  1 is a stochastic variable characterised by the distribution
function Eq 21 Its average is given by the inverse transition rate 1ri Since the decay process is a sequence of
such independent Poisson processes we simply have
For f  0 we get 38 55
which are the harmonic numbers The lifetime of a two-bond cluster is increased by a factor 32  15 with respect
to the single bond that of the three-bond cluster by 116  18 and so on For large Nt one can write 55

where   0577 is the Euler constant In fact this approximation is very good already for small values of Nt The
weak logarithmic dependence for large Nt means that for large adhesion clusters size matters little since the bonds
decay independently of each other and on the same time-scale This result diers from the deterministic one for small
force Eq 17 by the constant  and the additional contribution 12Nt which vanishes for large clusters For small
force f  1 Eq 32 is a good approximation for cluster lifetime T  For intermediate force 1  f  Nt the reverse
rate grows rapidly for states with i  f  whereas for states with i  f  ri remains close to i Therefore we can
approximate the average lifetime of a cluster as HNt  Hf  Using Eq 32 we get
T  ln Ntf  
Thus cluster size Nt is now replaced by an eective size Ntf  as we have already found in the deterministic framework
compare Eq 19 For large force f  Nt the only term which contributes to Eq 30 is the one for the rupture of
the rst bond Then
ef Nt
and we deal essentially with a single bond eect if the rst bond breaks all remaining bonds follow within no time
domino eect This eect is also evident from the dissociation rate D  which for very large force approaches a
Poisson distribution compare Fig 6d In Eq 34 the numerator represents the probability for single bond rupture
under force while the denominator represents the probability that any one out of Nt identical bonds breaks rst
Since f  Nt in this regime the rst eect dominates and T increases with Nt For a given f Nt on the other hand
the lifetime decreases with increasing Nt due to the increase in absolute force In contrast to the deterministic result
Eq 20 the stochastic result Eq 34 does not scale with f Nt In Fig 7 we plot the average cluster lifetime T
from Eq 30 as a function of f Nt for dierent values of Nt For small force f  1 T plateaus at the value given
by the harmonic number HNt according to Eq 31 In the regime of intermediate force 1  f  Nt all curves fall
on the master curve T  ln 061Ntf  as predicted by Eq 33 For large force f  Nt the scaling with f Nt is
lost as predicted by Eq 34 Although deterministic and stochastic predictions for cluster lifetime T have similar
overall features the deterministic result underestimates the plateau at small force and predicts an incorrect scaling
with f Nt at large force
Higher cumulants of the various distributions provide information about the eect of uctuations For the number
of closed bonds at time   the width of the distribution is described by the variance dened by 2
N    hi2i  hii2
In Fig 8a we plot the relative standard deviation N  N   for cluster sizes Nt  8 and Nt  16 It it zero
initially due to the initial condition and diverges for large times In regard to the distribution of cluster lifetime
the variance T can be calculated in the same way as the average lifetime because for a sequence of independent
stochastic processes all cumulants simply add up The variance of the Poisson process Eq 21 is 1r2i Therefore
the variance for cluster lifetime is
For vanishing force this expression reads
i2  2  1Nt  1 
where 1Nt  1 is the trigamma function and  the Riemannian -function For increasing Nt the variance
converges to a nite value For zero force this limit is given by
i2  2 
because the trigamma function vanishes in this limit This result is an upper limit for the variance in general because
the reverse rate increases with increasing force ri  i The relative standard deviation T T of cluster dissociation
is always smaller than unity since P x2  P x2 For single bond rupture we have a single Poisson process and
it becomes exactly unity For vanishing force and large clusters it scales as  1 ln Nt Although it decreases with
increasing NT  it does so in a dierent way than the Gauss process which decreases as  1N 12
 The reason is
that the contributions from the dierent subprocesses are not constant but decrease as rupture proceeds For large
forces f  Nt cluster dissociation becomes a Poisson process governed by the rupture of the rst bond Then the
rst term dominates in Eq 30 and Eq 35 Therefore the relative standard deviation T T  1 again Moreover
now T T  1N 12
 because now only the rst Nt  f subprocesses contribute with roughly similar values like in a
Gauss-distribution In Fig 8b we plot T T as a function of f Nt as it crosses over between the cases of vanishing and
very large force with a minimum around f Nt  03 that is in the intermediate force range The narrow distribution
at intermediate force is also evident in Fig 6 Fig 8b also shows how the relative standard deviation decreases with
increasing cluster size Nt In general the agreement between deterministic and stochastic descriptions is best for
large cluster size Nt and intermediate force 1  f  Nt However it should also be noted that the denition of
deterministic lifetime is somehow arbitrary because a discrete cuto has to be introduced in a continuum description
Especially for small clusters the choice of the cluster size at which dissociation occurs will have a large inuence on
IV VANISHING FORCE
A Deterministic analysis
We now turn to the case of vanishing force f  0 Then the deterministic equation Eq 4 reads
For the initial condition N 0  Nt its solution is
 N  Nt  N  
N   
  e1
Nt cid201 
e1cid21 Neq 
Thus there is an exponentially fast relaxation from Nt to the equilibrium state with Neq  Nt1   closed bonds
Neq increases linearly with the rebinding constant  from Neq  0 for   0 and saturates at Nt for   1 In the
deterministic description the lifetime of the cluster is innite because the completely dissociated state N  0 is never
reached
In the case f  0 the reverse rates dened in Eq 2 are linear in i and r0  0 at i  0 Natural boundary
conditions imply g0  Nt that is a reecting boundary condition at i  0 A linear system with natural boundary
B Stochastic analysis

One can easily check that by setting   0 in Eq 41 one obtains the same result as by setting f  0 in Eq 23
Eq 41 shows that the systems relaxes to the stationary state on a dimensionless time scale 11   thus the
larger rebinding the faster the system equilibrates In the stationary state the state probabilities follow a binomial
distribution

because the bonds are independent and each bond is closed and open with probabilities 1   and 11  
respectively
The generating function also allows to calculate all moments of the distribution

Since now ri is linear in i the rst moment N    hii is identical to the solution Eq 39 of the deterministic

The relative standard deviation N N essentially scales as N 12 for all times thus uctuation eects decrease with
increasing bond number in the usual way The stationary state value is lim  N  N    1  Neq12 
Nt12 Therefore larger rebinding does not only increase the equilibrium number of bonds but also decreases the
size of the uctuations around Neq This leads to a narrow distribution for large cluster under strong rebinding with
a small probability of coming close to the lower boundary
In Fig 9a we plot the state probabilities pi from Eq 41 for cluster size Nt  10 and rebinding constant   1
The system quickly relaxes to the equilibrium state The only dierence for dierent initial conditions is in the initial
transient In particular for N0  Neq the average does not change in time although the distribution initially spreads
to the binomial one For   1 the stationary distribution is symmetric around the average The width of the
distribution for dierent  is illustrated in Fig 9b which shows the average number of closed bonds normalised by
the equilibrium number of bonds that is NNeq together with the relative standard deviation N N  for dierent
values of the rebinding constant  The curves for N are independent of Nt due to the normalization Fig 9b shows
that with increasing  relaxation becomes faster and the width of the distribution decreases
For the biologically important case of an absorbing boundary at i  0 it seems to be rather dicult to nd a
closed-form analytical solution for arbitrary cluster sizes For the case Nt  2 we will present such a solution in
the next section For arbitrary Nt we use Monte Carlo simulations as described in Sec II In Fig 10 we show
individual simulation trajectories for dierent parameter values of interest in comparision to the average number of
closed bonds for reecting and absorbing boundaries at i  0 The plots show that the number of closed bonds in
a cluster rst relaxes towards the steady state value for which rupture and rebinding balance each other Although
for the absorbing boundary the number of closed bonds decreases with time in average for individual realizations it
stays roughly constant until a large uctuation towards the absorbing boundary leads to loss of this realization The
time-scale for the decrease in N is thus determined by the probability for uctuations from the steady state to the
absorbing boundary
Because a full analytical solution is not available for the case of an absorbing boundary we now introduce an
approximation for this case
It is similar to the local thermal equilibrium description introduced by Zwanzig for
modelling protein folding dynamics 57 Our starting point is that for large clusters and strong rebinding the

absorbing boundary is a small perturbation to the solution for the reecting boundary Eq 41 which in the following
we will denote by piNt
p0  r1p1 with r1  1 and probability will
only accumulate in the completely dissociated state Since p0 is slaved to the other state probabilities and since we
expect only a small perturbation for the states with i  1 we assume that here the dierent boundary only leads to
a simple renormalization caused by the leakage into the absorbing boundary

Since relaxation to the steady state is faster than decay to the absorbing boundary pi  can be taken to be the
0 1  p0 d  which is
stationary value that is the constant pi according to Eq 42 Then p0   p1R

We conclude that the solution decays exponentially on the time scale 1p1
In Fig 11 we plot Monte Carlo
solutions for the state probabilities in comparison to the approximation For   1 the approximation does not
work well for Nt  5 but it does so already for Nt  10 For   5 the approximation works well for both cluster
i0 pi  1 This
is a small error for large clusters and strong rebinding In order to assess the validity of Eq 46 we note that it
presupposes that the time scale for relaxation to the steady state 11   is smaller than the time scale for decay
to the absorbing boundary 1p1  1  NtNt Therefore  should be larger than Neq1Nt  1
sizes Note that in this approximation a term p0e p1 is missing for proper normalization PNt
It follows from Eq 46 that the mean number of closed bonds decay in an exponential way N    Neqe p1 
This is conrmed by Fig 12a which shows the corresponding simulation results For Nt  2 5 and 10 we have
p1  05 016 and 97  103 Numerically we nd 06 013 and 001 thus the approximation is rather good
In Fig 12b we plot numerical results for the standard deviation N  The initial increase of N is well described
by Eq 44 for the reecting boundary thus the boundary has little inuence here Large clusters stay close to the
steady state during the time shown and the approximation is applicable For small clusters the variance grows larger
than the steady state value before is decreases exponentially while the cluster size N approaches zero The variance

Nt  1 2 5 10 and 100 b Variance N of the cluster size distribution for the same parameters as in a
contains two time-scales The second moment of the distribution decreases on the same timescale as the average while
the square of the rst moment decreases twice as fast The long time exponential decrease of N is thus described by
twice the relaxation time as is was found for the average number of bonds
Although an exact solution for the state probabilities seems to be impossible for the case of an absorbing boundary
more analytical progress can be made if one is only interested in the probability that the cluster dissociates as a
whole For the absorbing boundary the cluster dissociation rate has been denoted by D  before For the reecting
boundary D  can be identied as the probability that the state i  0 is reached for the rst time at time  if the
system has started in the state i  Nt at time   0 This is a rst passage problem which can be treated with Laplace
techniques Since the transition rates do not depend on absolute time one can decompose the state probability for
i  0 into two parts
p0  Z 
D p00   d 
where p00  is the state probability for state i  0 with initial condition pi0  i0 p00  can also be interpreted
as the probability for having returned to the boundary after time   A Laplace transform of the equation leads to an
algebraic relation between the Laplace transforms of the three functions

This equation is a polynomial of order Nt  1 in  The zero order term is the harmonic number HNt so for   0
we recover the result from Eq 31 In Fig 13 we plot Eq 54 as a function of cluster size Nt and rebinding rate
 As long as   1 cluster lifetime grows only weakly logarithmically with cluster size at least for not too large
clusters For   1 the higher order terms in  take over and the increase in T becomes eectively exponential as
shown in Fig 13a In Fig 13b it is shown explicitly that increasing  to values larger than unity leads to a strong
increase in lifetime This eect is larger for larger clusters since the number of rebinding events in the dissociation
path is larger
V FINITE FORCE AND FINITE REBINDING
A Deterministic analysis
Force destabilizes the cluster while rebinding stabilizes it again It has been shown by Bell that in the framework
of the deterministic equation Eq 4 the cluster remains stable up to a critical force fc 23 For the following it is
helpful to revisit his stability analysis In equilibrium we have
Neqef Neq  Nt  Neq 
At small force f  this equation has two roots with the larger one corresponding to a stable equilibrium As force
increases a saddle-node bifurcation occurs Above the critical force no roots exist and the cluster becomes unstable

value at the critical force fc
Exactly at critical loading the two roots collapse and the slopes of the two terms become equal This gives an
additional equation

where the product logarithm ploga is dened as the solution x of xex  a For small forces the unstable xed point
is very close to zero This implies that the stable xed point is an attractor for most initial conditions Close to the
critical force the unstable xed point is close to the stable one and only the initial conditions above Nc will reach
the stable xed point Eq 57 scales in a trivial way with Nt but in a complicated way with  For   1 we have
fc  Nte Thus the critical force vanishes with  because the cluster decays by itself with no rebinding For   1
and up to   100 we have fc  05Nt ln  This weak dependence on  shows that the single bond force scale set by
Fb also determines the force scale on which the cluster as a whole disintegrates Fig 14a shows how fc crosses over
from linear to logarithmic scaling with 
Eq 55 is an implicit equation which cannot be inverted to give Neq as a function of the model parameters Nt f
and  In general Neq decreases from Nt1   for f  0 to Nc for fc For small forces we can nd an approximate
solution by rst expanding the exponential function in Eq 55 to second order in f Neq and then expanding the
resulting quadratic function for Neq to second order in f Nt

In the deterministic framework cluster lifetime is innite for f  fc because a stationary state exists at Neq For
f  fc cluster lifetime is nite but strongly varies as a function of Nt f and  For f  fc we can neglect rebinding
and use the results from Sec III where we found for cluster lifetime

again and cluster lifetime diverges To understand this limit we note that here the system will evolve very slowly

In this limit the lifetime will be dominated by the time spent close to the critical state The time for a signicant
change N  1 in N is

Therefore T diverges like the inverse of f  fc Fig 15 shows the lifetime of an adhesion cluster derived from
numerical integration of the deterministic equation for   1 and Nt  100 as a function of the force-size ratio f Nt
The numerical results are compared to the approximation Eq 59 for large forces and Eq 61 for the divergence
close to the critical point Obviously both approximations work well for their respective limits For dierent cluster
sizes Nt the plot remains basically unchanged not shown because the forces above fc are already in the range
where Eq 16 predicts scaling with f Nt alone For dierent rebinding constants  the results are qualitatively the
same only that the critical force is shifted to dierent values
B Stochastic analysis
In general it seems to be dicult to nd a closed-form analytical solution for the state probabilities pi  for
general values of  f and Nt In the following we will derive such an analytical solution for the case Nt  2 with an
absorbing boundary In principle solutions can be constructed in the same way for a reecting boundary or larger
clusters but for increasing cluster size the analytical procedure quickly becomes intractable For this reason we will
later use simulations to deal with the general case
We start by rewriting the master equation Eq 1 in matrix form
For the case Nt  2 with an absorbing boundary p  p0 p1 p2T and
p  W  p 
Eq 62 is solved by 52
0 r1  g1
p   eW   p0 X
ce p
where  and p are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of W  respectively The coecients c have to be determined
from the initial condition
Since the absorbing state p0  1 0 0T is a stationary state the corresponding eigenvalue 0  0 The other two
eigenvalues are negative and correspond to transient states

  r1  r2  g12 and  p2  r1r2 
 and p2 
2  r1

The three eigenstates p are linearly independent and form a basis of the state space of the cluster With the initial
condition pi  iNt  that is p0  0 0 1T  the coecients c follow from Eq 65 as
c0  1

and c2

There is a competition between the hyperbolic terms which grow on the time-scale 1 and the exponential terms
which decrease on the time-scale 1 Since    the exponential terms will win and only the stationary state
survives

As shown in the preceding sections for special cases force leads to exponentially decreased lifetimes while rebinding
leads to polynomial terms in  up to order Nt  1
Although the eigenvalue analysis can be used also for the general case of arbitrary cluster size in this case it is
more ecient to use exact stochastic simulations as described in Sec II B In Fig 16 numerical solutions of the state
occupancy probabilities piNt
i0 are plotted for Nt  10 with   1 for four dierent forces f  01 1 3 and 50 This
gure corresponds to Fig 2 for vanishing rebinding and Fig 11 for vanishing force For small force the numerical
solutions compare well with the approximation Eq 46 introduced for vanishing force For larger force but still below
the critical force the state probabilities still decrease exponentially for large times but the approximation Eq 46
breaks down because the reference distribution piNt
i0 now had to be replaced by the unknown steady state for
the case of nite force If force is increased beyond the critical force fc  278 for   1 a simple description is
not available because equilibration and decay occur on the same timescale For very large force the behavior of the
adhesion cluster approaches that for vanishing rebinding with the analytical solution Eq 23
Fig 17 demonstrates that the decay process changes dramatically as force is increased above the critical value It
displays trajectories of individual clusters with initially Nt  N0  10 100 and 1000 closed bonds in comparison with
the average number of bonds derived from a large number of these trajectories Since fc  0278Nt for   1 Fig 17a
with f  025Nt is below the critical value For the largest cluster the system equilibrates towards the steady state
and then uctuate around this value with very rare encounters of the absorbing boundary For the smaller clusters

a the numerical results are compared to exponentially decaying curves  ea dashed lines with a  128 052 0072 and
00009 for increasing bond number
however uctuations towards the absorbing boundary frequently lead to loss of individiual realizations As a result
the average number of closed bonds decays exponentially on a much faster timescale Fig 17a with f  Nt is above
the critical force and the behavior is changed qualitatively A steady state does not exist anymore and the clusters
do not decay by uctuations but the size of each adhesion cluster is continuously reduced Clusters of dierent size
now decay on the same timescale and rebinding events are very rare in comparison to rupture events
Fig 18 plots numerical results for the average number of closed bonds N as function of time  for two dierent
values of f Nt and for cluster sizes Nt  1 10 102 and 103 For f  025Nt  fc after initial relaxation all curves
decay exponentially For f  Nt  fc the larger clusters show a steep decrease in average cluster size at the end of
the decay due to the eects of shared loading For the small clusters the average cluster size decreases slowly since
cooperative eects are small
Fig 19 plots the variance N   of the distribution pi for the two force values used in the two previous gures
Below the critical force the behavior is similar to that for vanishing force depicted in Fig 12 The variance decreases
exponentially after having traversed a maximum For forces above the critical force a dierent behavior arises After
growing as expected in the initial phase the variance displays a sharp peak This eects becomes more pronounced

In Fig 20 a comparison of the average number of closed bonds in the stochastic and the determinsitic description
is shown N   is plotted for cluster sizes Nt  10 100 and 1000 for the forces f Nt  01 and 10 and the rebinding
rate   10 For small forces f  fc the average number of closed bonds equilibrates towards the steady state
and remains constant thereafter The uctuations occuring in the stochastic description lead to a slow decrease of
N  Above the critical force the deterministic clusters decay as well and in a more abrupt way than the stochastic
average
We now turn to the dissociation rate of the overall cluster as a function of the model parameters For   1 and
f  025Nt and Nt that is below and above the critical force numerical results are plotted in Fig 21 For a single
bond dissociation is a Poisson process with the maximum at   0 and an exponentially decreasing dissociation
rate D  r1p1  ef eef   For larger clusters and below the critical force uctuations to the absorbing boundary
determine the rate of dissociation which vanishes at   0 goes through a maximum and then decreases exponentially
with time As explained above the exponential decay follows because decay proceeds by rare uctuations from the
steady state towards the absorbing boundary Above the critical force the dissociation rate for Nt  1 becomes more
sharply peaked and cannot be described with single exponential curves A steady state does not exist anymore and
dissociation does not proceed by uctuations The trajectories in Fig 17 have shown that adhesion clusters decay
fairly abrupt towards the end of the decay as a consequence of shared loading This cooperative instability is the
FIG 21 Dissociation rate D of the overall cluster for   1 and Nt  1 5 10 25 100 and 1000 a f  025Nt and b f  Nt
reason for the sharp dissociation distribution for large clusters under super-critical loading The single bond that
lacks these cooperativity still shows the exponential dissociation rate which is now the slowest decaying for the given
force size ratio
Whereas results for the dissociation rate have to be obtained numerically the average lifetime can be calculated
analytically 51 The basic idea here is to sum the average times for any possible pathway leading from the initial
cluster size N0 towards dissociation at the absorbing boundary i  0 with its appropriate statistical weight One can
show that the lifetime TNtN0 of a cluster with a total of Nt molecular bonds of which N0 are closed initially satises

expressions are polynomials of order Nt  1 in  but in the general case from Eq 75 the coecients depend on

For Nt  2 and 3 T can also be derived by explicitly summing over all possible dissociation paths For larger Nt
direct summation becomes intractable and the results following from the general formula Eq 75 become rather
lengthy In general force always aects most strongly those terms of highest order in  thus for   1 application
of force is therefore an ecient way to reduce average lifetime T  For   1 T is dominated by those terms of lowest
order in  thus here the reduction of lifetime with increasing force is not modulated by rebinding

ratio f Nt for the rebinding constants   01 and   10 For small forces f  1 the average lifetime plateaus at
the value given by Eq 54 For large forces f  Nt that is when the force on each single bond is larger than the
intrinsic force scale the limit of vanishing rebinding applies for Nt  1 lifetime is independent of  compare also
Fig 15 The critical forces for the given rebinding rates are fc  00355Nt and fc  0278Nt In the intermediate
force range roughly around fc the lifetime is reduced from the zero force to the zero rebinding limit This reduction
is dramatic for large clusters Nt  10 with appreciable rebinding   1 where the lifetime is reduced by orders
of magnitude We also show the lifetime following from the deterministic framework which provides a lower limit
for the lifetime at large forces because here the largest clusters have the shortest lifetimes for a given force size ratio

Fig 23a demonstrates the inuence of rebinding on the average lifetime at dierent levels of force Here we show
average lifetime T as function of  for Nt  10 and for increasing values of force For f  0 the curves are as depicted
in Fig 13
Increasing force reduces the lifetime strongly and leads to an almost constant lifetime for dierent 
compared the strong increase for f  0 Only when rebinding is suciently strong that force is smaller than the
critical force f  fc lifetime begins to grow The increase observed then is similar to that for vanishing force only
that the absolute value of lifetime is smaller For example for f  06Nt the cluster grows strongly for g  5 where
the critical force is fc  082Nt for f  Nt the strong increase is observed for g  10 for which the critical force is
fc  115Nt A similar eect is observed for the dependence of average lifetime on cluster size see Fig 23b At small
Nt cluster lifetime grows strongly at large forces according to Eq 30 due to shared loading For larger Nt lifetime
grows slowly until Nt is large enough that fc  f is reached Above this size T grows on a rate comparable to that
for vanishing or small force For   01 the increase of T with Nt is slow throughout the shown range of Nt
VI DISCUSSION
In this paper we have presented a detailed analysis of the stochastic dynamics of an adhesion cluster of size Nt
under shared loading f and with rebinding rate  The corresponding master equation has been solved exactly for
several special cases For vanishing rebinding   0 the exact solution Eq 24 could be constructed because cluster
decay is a sequence of Poisson processes For vanishing force f  0 we deal with a linear problem which can be
treated with standard techniques In the case of natural boundaries that is for a reecting boundary at i  0 the
exact solution Eq 41 follows with the help of a generating function In the general case of nite force f and nite
rebinding rate  for the case Nt  2 and an absorbing boundary we used an eigenvalue analysis to derived the exact
solution Eq 70 In principle the same method can also be applied for a reecting boundary or for larger clusters
but this does not lead to simple analytical results
For vanishing force f  0 and an absorbing boundary at i  0 we introduced the leakage approximation
also known as local thermal equilibrium description in the theory of protein folding which treats the absorbing
boundary as a small perturbation to the exactly solved case of the reecting boundary The resulting formulae given
in Eq 46 work well if average cluster lifetime T is much larger than the internal time scale 11   that is for
large clusters or strong rebinding All other cases have been treated with exact stochastic simulations using the
Gillespie algorithm which for large clusters is more ecient than the eigenvalue analysis Moreover the study of
single simulation trajectories oers valuable insight into the typical nature of unbinding trajectories expected for
experiments
Once the master equation is solved either exactly or numerically all quantities of interest can be calculated In
this paper we focused on the mean number of closed bonds as a function of time N   and the dissociation rate for
the overall cluster D  The rst moment of D  then gives the mean cluster lifetime T  In this paper we derived
an exact solution T  T Nt f  from the adjoint master equation see Eq 75 For the special cases of vanishing
rebinding and vanishing force we also showed how the exact formulae for T can be derived via completely dierent
routes The result for T  T Nt f  from Eq 30 follows from the unique dissociation path without rebinding while
the result for T  T Nt  from Eq 54 can be derived with Laplace techniques as a mean rst passage time for the
case of a reecting boundary In order to assess the role of uctuations we also calculated the standard deviations
N and T for the distributions of the number of closed bonds and cluster lifetimes respectively
A special focus of this paper was a detailed comparision between the stochastic and determinstic treatment Re-
garding mean cluster lifetime the deterministic treatment is rather good in the case of vanishing rebinding although
it underestimates the plateau value for cluster lifetime at small force In the presence of rebinding the deterministic
treatment fails because it includes neither the eect of uctuations nor the eect of an absorbing boundary
particular the deterministic treatment does not predict nite lifetime below the critical force fc when clusters decay
due to uctuations towards the absorbing boundary Only at very large force when rebinding becomes irrelevant
does the deterministic treatment work well again Regarding the average number of closed bonds the deterministic
model fails because it does not correctly treat the non-linearity in the rupture rate This eect is most evident for
small clusters and at late stage of rupture In general the mean number of closed bonds in the stochastic model decay
in a smoother way than in the deterministic model which typically shows an abrupt decay in late stage This abrupt
decay in fact is typical for shared loading and shows up in the stochastic model when one studies single simulation
trajectories In this sense the deterministic model makes an interesting prediction which should be conrmed in
experiment albeit not on the level of the rst moment as suggested by the deterministic model but rather on the
level of single trajectories as suggested by the stochastic model
Our results can now be used to evaluate a large range of dierent experimental situations The stochastic dynamics
of adhesion clusters under force can be quantitatively studied with many dierent techniques including atomic force
microscopy optical tweezers magnetic tweezers the biomembrane force probe ow chambers and the surface force
apparatus In all of these cases by measuring cluster lifetime T and two out of the three parameters Nt f and 
the third parameter can be estimated with the help of our exact results In general our exact results nicely show
how mean cluster lifetime T varies with cluster size Nt force f and rebinding rate  For example if the single bond
lifetime was one second k0  1s for f  0 and   0 a cluster lifetime T of one minute could only be achieved with
1026 bonds because in this case cluster lifetime scales only logarithmically with cluster size However for a rebinding
rate   1 kon  k0 only Nt  10 bonds are necessary because lifetime scales strongly with rebinding T  Nt1
Increasing force to f  10 would decrease lifetime to T  005 s because T is exponentially decreased by f  To
reach one minute again cluster size or rebinding rate had to be increased such that f  fc This implies Nt  50 or
  10 It is important to note that these predictions are based on the assumption of rigid force transducers In many
experimental situations of interest the force transducer will be subject to elastic deformations or even to viscous
relaxation processes like for example when pulling on cells 59 In order to focus on generic aspects of adhesion
clusters here we only studied the minimal model for stochastic dynamics under force
Our results can also be applied to experiments in cell adhesion For example the biomembrane force probe
with linear loading has recently been used to study the decay of  3-integrin clusters induced on the surface of
endothelial cells 29 41 If one makes sure that the clusters do not actively grow during the time of dissociation
similar experiments could now be done also for constant loading Because in these kinds of experiments the exact
cluster size is usually unknown one had to convolute our results with a Poisson distribution for an estimated average
number of bonds 34 39 Recently our result for the average cluster lifetime of two bonds under shared force and with
rebinding Eq 73 has been applied to the analysis of ow chamber data on leukocyte tethering through L-selectin
42 Since in this case force can be calculated as a function of shear ow our formula can be used to the estimate
rebinding rate which in this case turns out to be surprisingly large This in turn explains why dissociation dynamics
in L-selectin mediated leukocyte tethering appears to be rst order for large rebinding the leakage approximation is
rather good and decay is exponential
Our results can not be directly applied to adhesion clusters which compensate for force-induced decay by active
growth as it has been found experimentally for focal adhesions 60 Yet there are also interesting lessons for focal
adhesions which can be learned from our model For example our stochastic analysis conrms the prediction from
the deterministic stability analysis that cluster stability changes strongly around the critial value fc although small
clusters tend to decay also at smaller force due to uctuations towards the absorbing boundary It is interesting to
note that recent experiments measuring internally generated force at single focal adhesions suggest that f Nt the
most important scaling variable of our analysis is roughly constant for dierent cell types 43 45 It is therefore
tempting to speculate that focal adhesions or subsets of focal adhesions are regulated to be loaded close to the
critical value fcNt  ploge from Eq 57 In this way cells could quickly increase force on single bonds by small
changes in actomyosin contractility Large force on single closed bonds in turn might trigger certain signaling events
in focal adhesions possibly by mechanically opening up certain signaling domains 61 Our speculation provides a
simple way to estimate the rebinding rate which is very hard to measure experimentally Using compliant substrates
it has been found that focal adhesions are characterized by a stress constant  55 nNm2 43 45 We do not
know which of the many dierent proteins in focal adhesions denes the weak link which most likely ruptures under
force but we expect that it will have a similar area density as the integrin receptors which are expected to have a
typical distance between 10 and 30 nm corresponding to 104 and 103 molecules per m2 respectively To obtain a
lower estimate for  we therefore use Fc  55 nN and Nt  104 For activated 51-integrin binding to bronectin
recent single molecule experiments obtained for the molecular parameter values k0  0012 Hz and Fb  9 pN 19
Therefore the rebinding rate can be estimated to be at least   02 that is kon  0002 Hz in dimensional units
Based on future experimental input it would be interesting to extend our model of passive decay to active processes
resulting in cluster growth under force
Finally we want to comment that our model might also be applied to situations in materials science which are
not directly related to biomolecular receptor-ligand pairs One example is sliding friction which recently has been
modeled as dynamic formation and rupture of bonds under force 62 In general we expect that many more cohesion
phenomena in materials can be successfully modeled as dynamic interplay between rupture and rebinding
