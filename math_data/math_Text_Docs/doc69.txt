The retrieval of black hole information was recently presented in two interesting propos-
als in the Hawking Radiation conference a revised version by G t Hooft of a proposal he
initially suggested 20 years ago and a new proposal by S Hawking Both proposals address
the problem of black hole information loss at the classical level and derive an expression for
the scattering matrix The former uses gravitation back reaction of incoming particles that
imprints its information on the outgoing modes The latter uses supertranslation symmetry
of horizons to relate a phase delay of the outgoing wave packet compared to their incom-
ing wave partners The difculty in both proposals is that the entropy obtained from them
appears to be innite
By including quantum effects into the Hawking and t Hoofts proposals I show that

INTRODUCTION
The mystery of black hole information loss was recently addressed by S Hawkings new pro-
posal 2 presented at the Hawking Radiation conference I organized in Sweden and by G t
Hoofts diagonalized brick wall model 1 Although the two models differ in their approaches
they both treat the black hole information retrieval problem classically SHawking proposes the
surface of the black hole to be like a hologram and uses supertranslation symmetry from the BMS
group to gain information about the phase delay of a wavepacket scattered from the horizon 2 G

t Hooft uses the gravitational barrier to postulate an imaginary surface near the horizon a brick
wall from which incoming waves scatter off as if bouncing from an invisible hard wall 1 and
the outgoing modes contain the information of near horizon scattering in their phase
Both models aim to extrapolate a scattering matrix relating the in and out going waves While
successfully constructing the Smatrix elements both models run into a serious difculty the
black hole entropy diverges which implies an innite number of microstates The phase delay for
the outgoing wavepackets in both proposals depends on momenta and the transverse coordinates
The divergence at the classical level is to be expected since the number of modes being scattered is
unbound and their energies are unbound becoming worse near the horizon due to blueshifting
These lead to a quadratic divergence in the transverse momenta as well as a logarithmic divergence
Achieving an S matrix description to relate the incoming and outgoing wavepackets makes
these proposals the most promising solution to a 45 years old outstanding problem So it is
reasonable to consider these models seriously and hope that when quantum effects are incorporated
in the two proposals the entropy of the black hole derived from them will recover the celebrated
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy area lawA remaining alternative to the information loss puzzle is
that singularities and event horizons may not exist as considered in 3 a question that will soon
be settled observationally by the Event Horizon Tracer EHT
The main emphasis in both models 1 2 is on the information encapsulated in the phase of the
outgoing wavepackets about the incoming modes scattered near the horizon
Here I am interested in the quantum aspects of the problem specically an additional subtlety
related to quantum measurement When the scattering is treated at the quantum level then the set
of incoming and outgoing modes are inevitably subjected to measurement processes by the black
holes occuring during their scattering off or near the horizon Let us consider the black hole with
mass M as a classical measuring device a detector watching over that is performing random
measurements onto the incoming quantum modes to determine their state The frequency of mea-
surement depends on the frequency of the wavepacket If we ignore the effect of measurement
then the evolution of the scattered modes is given in 1 2
For the sake of illustrating the effect of measurement I will consider the t Hooft model 1 as
a working example since the details of the S Hawkings proposal 2 presented at the Hawking
Radiation conference are not yet available to the public However without loss of generality the
effect of measurement on the entropy and probability discussed here in the context of 1 would
apply in the same manner to model for information retrieval of 2
II ENTROPY OF THE INFORMATION RETRIEVED AND QUANTUM ZENO EFFECT
A G t Hoofts Brick Wall model
Lets briey review the key ndings and notation of 1 needed for the next section The reader
is referred to the original papers 1 for the model and for the steps of derivation of formulas used
The transverse coordinates  are denoted by x and the longitudinal ones by z  1
zt
The at metric is written in terms of u   xz The author of 1 showed that if a particle A for
example with a momentum p  00 p0 travels through a reference point 0000 it will
induce a shift along the p direction to some test particle B sitting at  x00 by displacing it to
a new position  x4GpLog x
C 0 where G is Newtons constant and C a constant Note that
the shift depends on the transverse coordinates One can think of this effect as the shock wave of
the fast moving particle A being produced near the horizon hits particle B and displaces it by the
above amount
In 1 a scattering matrix is derived by using the shift of the outgoing modes that a particle going
in to the black hole induces then generalizing it to a distribution of in and outgoing particles from
which the in  and out  states of the black hole with the added inout particles are constructed
 outSin  out0Sin0  e4iGcid82 d2 xLog xcid48 xCpout  xcid48 pin x
In this expression 21 p
out x describe the total momentum distribution on the horizon of
in and out going particles
Using Rindler coordinates  after diagonalizing for the scattered modes 1 a hard wall
boundary condition is imposed at   0 where the mode bounces This boundary condition gives
a relation between the in and the outgoing mode that bounced off the wall at location 0 near
the horizonThe relation between the diagonalized Fourier transformed in and out going modes i
becomes
ikout  AikeikLogikin
where k is the Fourier parameter Aik the coefcient and   8G
l2  where l is the transverse
momenta The exchange of the transverse momentum l is assumed to be small and ignored The
system is now placed in a box with size 1  12Log cid39 LogM2 and the boundary conditions
in the box provide the energy levels kn by
n  kn1  0 cid39 knLog 12Log 12Logk  1
From here assuming the size of the box is large and ignoring the transverse momentum the
density matrix or partition function in this classical picture becomes

2Log  Log   Log
Here   8M is the Hawking inverse temperature  is the Euler Gamma coefcient Log is
roughly the size of the box taken to recover Hawking radiation at innity  cid39 M2 and the reason
for the sum over states being cid39 rather than equal to the sum over the energy levels kn is due to the
transverse momentum not being included in the above sum
B Black Hole Entropy in the context of the Quantum Zeno Effect
Each mode with an energy level kn will have a 2 j  1 degeneracy due to angular momen-
tum j that needs to be summed So the sum over states would normally include a  j j j  1
Equivalently in the continuum limit we need to integrate with respect to the transverse momenta l
Then Eq 24 contains a double integralcid82 ldl and the integral over kn in  The problem is that the
integration over the transverse momentum l makes the expression quadratically divergent besides
the logarithmic divergence coming from the Log already present in Eq24
An ingoing particle will continue its typical infalling trajectory into a black hole while the
bounce at the horizon or the hard wall refers only to the information carried by the outgoing
mode as emphasized in 1 Therefore both the hologram and brick wall models allow us to
continue alternate between a description of Hawking radiation as vacuum pair creation of entan-
gled particles in the exterior of the black hole or the alternative description of Hawking radiation
as a tunneling process 4 which is useful for illustrating the quantum effects here Seen as a
tunneling process black hole radiance is obtained either by outgoing positive energy particles tun-
neling outside the gravitational barrier or as a pair creation outside the black hole with the negative
energy particle in the pair tunneling into the black hole We are dealing at the quantum level with
unstable quantum systems since particles can tunnel in or out the gravitational potential
We would now like to show that with the measurement process the black hole performs on the
in and out going modes high energy modes are trapped while low energy ones decohere What
this means in the tunneling view is the tunneling lifetime of the high energy particles becomes
very long due to their frequent measurement by the black hole These pairs keep returning to their
intial state every time they are monitored So quantum entaglement of the high energy pair is
preserved but the particle carrying the entanglement information cannot tunnel out to contribute
to Hawking radiation
To proceed let us start with the basics Assume we start with a coherent incoming wavepacket
The scattering matrix element connecting the in and out going states and its survival probability
are related up to a factor
Pinout cid39   outSin  2
Since we are interested on the quantum aspect of scattering we have to take into account
the monitoring of the incoming and outgoing modes by the black hole near the bounce point
Let us take a black hole with mass M as a classical detector monitoring the quantum particles
The random measurement the black hole performs on these modes is inevitable and its frequency
depends on the frequency of the mode as explained above The measurement gives rise to the
quantum Zeno effect QZE a fact well known in literature 5 straightforward to derive and
conrmed experimentally for a variety of quantum systems  for conning tunneling potentials
similar to the one here see 6 and other types of potentials see 7 and references therein
QZE leads to three regimes short time frequent measurement intermediate time and long
time measurement The regime is determined by the frequency of measurements compared to the
Zeno dened below For example modes with inverse frequencies that are shorter than the Zeno
time fall under short time measurement behaviour but modes with inverse frequencies that are
much longer than the Zeno time fall under the long time measurement regime and so on A short
time expansion of the probability with the QZE included leads to a modication of the exponential
tunneling probability by a quadratic behaviour in time
Pt cid39 1 2

cid39 e
Here z is the Zeno time The Fourier transform of 26 gives the characteristic function ie the
probability weights for each mode in momentum space Due to the relation of the probability to
scattering given by Eq25 the scattering matrix in Eq21 also needs to be modied by multiplying
it with the square root of Eq27 for the QZE to be taken into account
The intermediate time regime allows for the typical exponential tunneling decay and the long
term regime modies the exponential with a power law tail
The regime is determined by the Zeno time for example the short time measurements are the
ones performed during time intervals less the Z  If we denote by Hint the interaction Hamiltonian
of the detector with the quantum particles in our case the interaction of the black hole hard wall
intin 
with the in and out going particles then the Zeno time can be calculated from 2
Both models we are interested in here 1 2 consider the scattering surface from which the
incoming modes bounce as a hard wall located at R cid39 2M or near   0 Then the interaction
of the black hole hard wall with these modes can well be approximated by the hard sphere
potential It follows that in the hard sphere approximation the Zeno time becomes z cid39 M Then
the characteristic function obtained from Eq 26 results in probability weights for each mode
kl that is modied by the QZE quadratic factor given below

with l the transverse momenta and k the longitudinal momenta The frequency of measurement
is determined by the frequency of the particles  in the sense that their monitoring by the black
 For massless particles 2  k2  l2 and since z cid39 M then a short
hole occurs during a time  cid39 1
time regime for the massless modes is valid for those modes with   M1
Incorporating the QZE modication to probability of Eq 27 that arises from the black hole
measurement in the density matrix of Eq24 is now straightforward as shown next
Our goal is to estimate the entropy by including the effect of measurement in the density matrix
and summing over all states including the transverse momenta l in the continuum limit It follows
that 24 now reads

Equipped with the result in Eq29 we proceed to estimate the entropy S from it

Although easy to obtain from Eq 29 and 210 the entropy expression is algebraically te-
dious so instead we show the plot of S in Fig1 using Mathematica in order to compare it to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy area law plotted in the same gure It can be seen that the black
hole entropy is quite close to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy The reason for the resemblance is
that the high momenta modes are trapped by the black hole monitoring thus their contribution to
the entropy is highly dampened
Physically both models collect the information about the vacuum pairs entanglement in the
Hawking radiation With the QZE included this process is modied The high energy pairs are
stuck in their initial quantum entangled state their frequent measurement halts decoherence pro-
tects their entanglement so information can not be carried away by an outgoing particle and these
pairs not contribute signicantly to Hawking radiation As an aside the QZE seems to provide a
natural mechanism for addressing the transplanckian problem of black holes On the other hand
the lower energy pairs with wavelengths of order M or longer undergo a different dynamics their
initial pair entanglement is destroyed information about their infalling partner is carried away
by the outgoing partner in the pair by the mechanisms proposed in 1 2 Thus modes with
wavelengths of order M or longer provide the dominant contribution to the entropy and Hawking
radiation The loss of entanglement in the lower energy pairs is due to their infrequent monitoring
by the black hole which triggers decoherence
The overall result is a mixed state of mainly lower energy particles of wavelengths of order
M or so seen as thermal radiation away from the black hole but which transferred their near the
horizon information onto Hawking radiation Black hole monitoring plays an insignicant effect
on these wavepackets due to the fact that their measurement is not frequent occuring at times of
order or larger than M These modes follow the nearly normal scattering and evolution described
in 2  with the only consequence being a memory loss of their initial entanglement as the
result of the measurement process Their contribution provides the dominant channel for Hawking
radiation
We should emphasize that if we start say with coherent incoming wavepackets it is not surpris-
ing that due to QZE we end up with an incoherent contribution added to the coherent states another
way of stating that the outgoing wavepackets are in a mixed state while unitarity for the whole sys-
tem of quantum particle pairs and the black hole is not violated as is clear from the derivation here
Information about the whole system is not lost but the nite number of microstates Fig1 is due
to the QZE of measurement
