We model the arrival of mid-price changes in the E-Mini SP futures contract as a self-exciting
Hawkes process Using several estimation methods we nd that the Hawkes kernel is power-law with
a decay exponent close to 115 at short times less than  103 seconds and crosses over to a second
power-law regime with a larger decay exponent  145 for longer times scales in the range 103 106
seconds More importantly we nd that the Hawkes kernel integrates to unity independently of the
analysed period from 1998 to 2011 This suggests that markets are and have always been close to
criticality challenging a recent study which indicates that reexivity endogeneity has increased in
recent years as a result of increased automation of trading However we note that the scale over
which market events are correlated has decreased steadily over time with the emergence of higher
frequency trading
INTRODUCTION
The excess volatility puzzle is the name coined to
describe Shillers 1 and LeRoy and Porters 2 obser-
vation that stock prices move too much to be justied by
changes in subsequent dividends in contradiction with
the Ecient Market Hypothesis Although hotly debated
ever since among theorists see 3 for a short review
many empirical studies have conrmed that a large frac-
tion of the volatility of asset prices cannot be explained
by changes in their fundamental value For example
most large price jumps seem to be endogenously gen-
erated rather than related to the arrival of news in the
market place 46 Although excess volatility crises and
crashes seem to be as old as nancial markets themselves
7 8 the debate has recently been stoked by the rise
of High Frequency Trading which is blamed for having
made markets more volatile and prone to large magni-
tude events such as ash-crashes without the need for
exogenous triggers Another closely related debate con-
cerns the nancial transaction tax as a tool to curb the
excessive volatility of markets Most academic studies
however suggest that such a tax would in fact increase
volatility 9
Keynes 10 Soros 11 and others see eg
12 13
have argued that a substantial part of market activity is
of endogenous reexive origin However real progress
has been hobbled by the lack of statistical tools that
would enable one to dene and measure precisely the
degree of reexivity in nancial markets Recently Fil-
imonov and Sornette FS 14 have applied the so-called
self-exciting Hawkes process formalism to market events
with the aim of quantifying precisely the level of endo-
geneity and exogeneity in the market Hawkes processes
originally found applications in modelling the clustered
occurrences of earthquakes Intuitively earthquakes re-

lax accumulated stresses between tectonic plates  but by
doing so other regions are brought closer to their yield
stress leading to an inter-twined pattern of foreshocks
and aftershocks Hawkes processes describe the arrival
of these seismic events as a Poisson point process but
with a history dependent intensity which increases when
an event has just occurred The same picture lends it-
self naturally to the arrival of events in the market place
Not surprisingly the Hawkes formalism has generated a
urry of activity as a means of modelling volatility and
market dynamics 1518
The results of Filimonov and Sornette are twofold
First their Hawkes process analysis over the period 1998-
2010 on the E-mini SP futures contract suggests that
the degree of reexivity has increased steadily in the last
decade an eect they attribute to the increased deploy-
ment of high-frequency and algorithmic trading Second
when studied over much shorter time intervals 10 min-
utes the Hawkes process analysis is found to be able
to detect precursors of the ash-crash that happened on
May 6th 2010 Devising such early warning tools is ev-
idently benecial in particular for market regulators
The work of FS is in this respect in a similar vein to
that of Easley OHara and Lopez de Prado who devel-
oped their VPIN indicator 19
The aim of the present paper is to revisit the rst claim
of FS that concerns the secular increase of reexivity in
nancial markets Although for the moment we reserve
judgement on the second claim which is of course of high
interest as well We nd in agreement with the recent
work of Bacry et al
17 that the inuence kernel
of the Hawkes process see below for a precise deni-
tion decays as a power-law in time but with two dif-
ferent regimes and a crossover time of around ve min-
utes When we calibrate the power-law kernel to mid-
price changes in the SP futures contract in much the
same way as FS but on longer time periods we nd that
the total degree of reexivity has been extremely stable
over time and in fact equal to the critical value beyond
with the Hawkes process becomes ill-dened This is the
main explanation for the discrepancy between our own
analysis and that of FS who calibrate an exponentially
decaying kernel on 30-minute windows In doing so they
only pick up short-term reexivity which we agree has
increased in recent years
We consider our result very plausible as they t well
with results previously reported in the literature For
example as we show in the next section the power-
law decay of the inuence kernel is related to long-range
memory of the event rate which for mid-price changes
should be strongly correlated with volatility The fact
that measures of market activity such as trading vol-
ume and volatility exhibit long-range dependence is one
of the best documented stylized facts of nancial mar-
kets Furthermore that markets operate in the vicin-
ity of a critical point has been repeatedly emphasized
in the econophysics literature see eg
6 13 2025
Within a Hawkes process description criticality is re-
lated to both long-range memory and the prevalence of
endogeneity over exogeneity in a precise manner Finally
many studies conclude that the statistics of nancial mar-
kets have been remarkably stable over time and assets
see eg 13 26 and refs therein  a result that would
have been hard to reconcile with the strong increase of
reexivity reported by FS
II HAWKES PROCESSES DEFINITION AND
SOME USEFUL RESULTS
A The general case
A one-dimensional Hawkes process
homogeneous Poisson process N t with an intensity
be mapped into the well known branching processes 27
exogenous mother events occur with intensity  and
give rise to endogenous child events which themselves
give birth to more child events The quantity n is the
branching ratio of the process ie the expected number
of additional events that any single event triggers As
is well known branching processes become critical when
n reaches unity and give rise to innite families with
strictly positive probability when n  1
The functional form of   further denes the type of
Hawkes process A popular form chosen by FS in their
analysis of market data is the exponential kernel
   e  n 
Note that 1 denes the memory time of the Hawkes
process beyond which past events have a negligible in-
uence on the instantaneous event rate However other
forms are possible too For example a power-law kernel
with a short-time cuto 0
     00

  0
where  is the Heaviside function
branching ratio is n  0
In this case the
A quantity that can easily be measured empirically is
the auto-covariance of the process dened as

It can be shown that the Fourier transforms of  and
 are related through the following equation 17 28 29

 and a self-exciting term that is a weighted sum over
previous events

The inuence kernel    0 describes the eect on
the instantaneous event rate t of a past event that took
place at time t    Assuming stationarity and taking
the expectation of both sides of Eq 1 allows one to
compute the average intensity  which is the solution

a homogeneous Poisson process with intensity  For
n  1 the intensity of the process dened by Eq 1

cial and will be discussed below Hawkes processes can

As long as n  1 the average event rate  is nite
and the autocovariance must integrate to a nite con-
stant All stationary processes with short-range inte-
grable correlations therefore satisfy the condition n  1
28 For n  1 on the other hand the process is non-
stationary with innite mean and the autocovariance of
the process is trivially non-integrable because the vari-
ance is innite as well But a Hawkes process that is
stationary with a nite mean  and variance but with
long-range dependence of the event rate ie with a di-
verging integral of the autocovariance 30must neces-
sarily be critical The mathematical existence of such a
stationary critical n  1 Hawkes process was proven by
Bremaud and Massoulie 28 and it is this process that
we nd ts well to our empirical data
B The critical case
Let us study this critical case in more detail Assuming
that the Hawkes kernel is a power-law as above with
an exponent 0    1 one nds that the small 0
expansion of  reads
  n  A0
where A is a complex number related to 0 We have
factored out 0 to make A a dimensionless constant
Note that when   1 the rst term of the expansion
of  becomes regular ie   Similarly for an auto-
covariance   which decays asymptotically as a power-
law    for some 0    1 one nds
  B01
with some real constant B Note that   1 corresponds
to long-range memory and   0   necessarily
leading to n  1 as alluded to above Inserting these
expressions into Eq 6 we obtain for   0
leading to
B01  A202
  1  2
B  A2
The above relation implies that  must in fact lie in the
restricted interval 0 1
2  for  to be in the range 0 1
as assumed But since   1  n the limiting case
n  1 only makes sense if simultaneously   0 ie the
total number of exogenous events grows sub-linearly with
the sample length
Another way to think about this limit which may be
more appropriate for nancial applications is to assume
that n  1     1 The autocorrelation function then
decays as a power-law    up to a long crossover
time    1 beyond which it decays much faster in
order to make   integrable
What happens when   1
2 but 0   such that n  1
see Eq 4 Naively the above analysis predicts   0
ie an autocorrelation that increases without bound as
   This is of course impossible and signals that in
this case the critical Hawkes process is non-stationary
Such a process can be simulated by providing some past
history with a constant average event rate  for t  0
its variance is then found to increase as t21 for t  0
The reason we have focused so much attention on this
critical case is that as we will show below the empirical
data clearly suggests that the relevant Hawkes process is
indeed critical and stationary ie precisely the Hawkes
processes without ancestors considered by Bremaud 
Massoulie 28
SP Futures contract in the period 1998-2010 assuming
an exponential kernel However this choice can only be
justied if the dynamics of the market can be charac-
terized by a single time scale 1 This is at variance
with many empirical studies that clearly elicit a scale-
free long-memory of measurements of market activity
such as trading volume and volatility This strongly
suggest the use of a power-law inuence kernel As a
matter of fact Bacry et al
17 have developed a non-
parametric estimation technique that yields a power-law
kernel over several decades for incoming market orders
on both the Bund and the Dax futures contracts They
nd that the exponent  dened by Eq 4 is small
We will revisit this non-parametric determination of
the kernel in Sect IV but for now we wish to repeat the
analysis of 14 with the hypothesis of a simple power-law
kernel as given by Eq 4 To allow for changes to the
high frequency end of the Hawkes kernel over time result-
ing from improved temporal resolution of market events
and reduced trading latency we consider a power-law
kernel with a smooth exponential cut-o for short lags
Furthermore to expedite the calculation of the likelihood
of the Hawkes process we approximate the power-law as
a sum of exponential functions with power-law weights 1

The parameter Z is chosen such thatR 
0  d  n and
S such that 0  0 since we cannot expect market par-
ticipants to react to events in zero seconds We can vary
the precision and extent of our power-law approximation
by varying the parameters m and M  For our calibra-
tion to the empirical data we have chosen m  5 and
M  15 but we found our results to be robust with re-
spect to variations in these parameters For values of 
in the ranges we expect the resulting function describes
closely a power-law form with tail exponent  1 but
the negative exponential term provides a smooth drop to
zero at lags shorter than approximately 0
Given observations of empirical market events mid-
point changes at times t1 t2     tn in an interval 0 T

ratio n appears to change little and uctuates around the critical value n  1 for the 14-year period studied Top-Right The

The data we use consists of a sequence of times in the
period 1998-2011 when the mid-point of the bid and ask
price of the E-mini SP contract was observed to change
Changes in this mid-point may have been the result of
executed market orders or limit orders that have been
placed or cancelled Our data is time-stamped to the
millisecond but since sometimes multiple events occur
during the same millisecond - the limit of our temporal
resolution - we employ a randomisation procedure We
give each event a real number time-stamp distributed
randomly and uniformly within the millisecond that it
was reported A similar operation is performed in 14
but within the second resolution that they have
In tting the model we only consider market events oc-
curring during Regular Trading Hours 0930 to 1615
Furthermore we take account of the U-shape intra-day
activity prole Without appropriate detrending the
tting procedure would interpret the slow variation in
event rate during the day as arising from the shape of
the Hawkes kernel To this end we consider a detrended
Hawkes process model

where wt is a periodic function dened over the trad-
ing day that dictates the weight to be appropriated to

less weight to events occurring during the morning and
late afternoon when high activity is to be expected The
weights are chosen to be the reciprocal of the empiri-
cal average daily event rate at that moment of the day

The model parameters as a function of time are cal-
culated between 1998 and 2011 on non overlapping two-
month periods using an estimate of the function Rt
made for each year All regular trading hours in each
two-month period are concatenated to form a single con-
tinuous point-process for which the log-likelihood of Eq
14 and Eq 15 is maximised with respect to the four
parameters    n  0 The results are shown in
Fig 1
Our key observation is that the branching ratio ap-
pears to change little over the course of the fourteen years
studied but uctuates about the critical value nc  1 cor-
responding to the onset of stationarity This means that
within the Hawkes framework the majority of events ob-
served in the market can be attributed to the long-range
inuence kernel both now and in 1998 However we
see that the short lag cut-o of the kernel has decreased
exponentially over time This can be attributed to the
steady emergence of higher frequency trading despite lit-
tle change in the event rate It may surprise the reader
that the event rate has not increased signicantly in the
14-year period the event rate for example in 2009 is
comparable with that in 1999 despite the growth of the
electronic futures market but understand that the events
studied are mid-point changes not trades or order-book
events and as such it is a better proxy for volatility than
transaction quantity or volume
Note that for the stationary critical Hawkes process
with n  1 described in Sect
II B the base intensity
 must be zero The small excess base intensity ob-
served in our results can be explained as arising from
the contribution of the part of the power-law kernel that
extends beyond the two-month window on which the t
is performed The integral of this remainder is approxi-
where T  2 months Indeed since each
two month period is tted independently without prior
event history there must be some non-zero base intensity
to explain the observation of any event at all

FIG 2 The analysis of 14 on a critical power-law Hawkes
processes We generate synthetic power-law Hawkes processes
with parameters   n  002 015 10 but with a cut-
o 0 drawn from Fig 1 and attempt to t these generated
processes to a model with an exponential kernel on 30-minute
windows Furthermore we also impose the intra-second ran-
domisation procedure employed in 14 Despite the fact that
the generated datasets represent critical Hawkes processes
with n  10 the analysis incorrectly reveals a sub-critical
branching ratio which has been steadily increasing since 1998
as reported in 14 Fig 4-D
Why is our result n  1 over the whole period so dier-
ent from the one presented in FS 14 To reconcile our
result with theirs we propose that a sub-critical branch-
ing ratio n  1 which increases over time can arise from
the choice of an exponential short-memory model to t
a critical power-law Hawkes process with a time depen-
dent high-frequency cut-o 0 on 30-minute windows To
this end we have performed MLE ts of the exponen-
tial kernel model to synthetic data that we have gener-
ated using the power-law kernel hypothesis We xed
  n  002 015 10 values which are approxi-
mately representative of the full fourteen years studied
but allowed the cut-o parameter 0 to vary according to
the MLE results of Fig 1 For each two-month time pe-
riod we generated an ensemble of 100 power-law Hawkes
processes from which following FSs procedure we drew
a 30-minute window After randomising the time-stamps
within the second as in 14 the window was t to the
exponential kernel model in the same way as FS The
resulting branching ratio 
 was then averaged over all
100 windows in each ensemble The results of this anal-
ysis are shown in Fig 2 and resemble much the data
presented in FS see their Fig 4 panel D
Despite the fact that the dataset is generated from
a critical Hawkes process with n  10 the analysis
with the exponential kernel model on 30-minute windows
reveals a sub-critical branching ratio which increases
steadily over time In 1998 since the market dynamics
operated at a lower frequency much of the contribution
to n from the integral of the power-law kernel lies outside
the range of a 30-minute window therefore the analysis
with an exponential kernel on these xed time windows
only picks up the short-term  30min reexivity which
has increased in the past 14 years due to advancements
in algorithmic and high frequency trading
IV NON-PARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF THE
HAWKES KERNEL
To complement and back up the results presented in
Section III we also estimate the shape of the Hawkes
kernel for several times in the 14-year period using non-
parametric means In 17 the authors present a method-
ology for estimating the kernel of multivariate Hawkes
process based on Eq 6 and the determination of the
empirical auto-covariance of the event rate Eq 5 We
have repeated their analysis in the monovariate case for
our data set choosing h  0001s for 2009 the maximum
temporal resolution of our data h  001s for 2005 and
h  01s for 1998 Following 17 the auto-covariance is
also discretely sampled at a rate   h and the Fourier
transform is performed in practice with DFT The result-
ing kernel estimate is subsequently averaged with loga-
rithmic bins to reduce noise for presentation
To minimise the eects of intra-day seasonality event
rates are again detrended by dividing by the daily event
rate as averaged for 5-minute bins over each year studied
Furthermore the empirical auto-covariance is estimated
on 45-minute windows during which we can expect the
event rate to be relatively stationary anyway The auto-
covariance estimate used to produce the kernel in the
range 1 ms  1000s in Fig 3 is based on an average over
all such 45-minute windows in a full year 1998 2006 or
duced from the inter-arrival times of the residual process
for all points in the given two month periods The kernel
parameters used in the analysis are extracted from the
MLE results of Fig 1 These gures show that one can
satisfactorily account for all events occurring in each two
month period with a single exogenous intensity term and
a three parameter kernel which we consider in itself a re-
markable fact But even if the kernel shape and Hawkes
dynamics were constant throughout each two month pe-
riod any deviation from the true kernel no matter how
small would fail the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test due to the
enormous number of points in our dataset

FIG 3 Non-parametric kernel estimation of the Hawkes ker-
nel in 1998 2006 and 2009 The power-law form with decay
exponent   015 is reproduced in all three years However
the high frequency cut-o of the kernels are considerably dif-
ferent The kernel estimates match well with the MLE ts
solid lines using the average parameter estimates for each
year as taken from Fig 1
The non-parametric procedure conrms the MLE re-
sults and also captures the change in the high-frequency
cut-o between the two years Note that the strong os-
cillations in the 1998 kernel estimate for   1s are not
random noise but the result of a spurious correlation in
how the data although time-stamped to the millisecond
is collected or aggregated However the MLE estimation
of the kernel shape seems robust to these data anomalies
As an additional check of the goodness of t of the
power-law Hawkes process we consider the residual pro-
cess 33 We re-express the point process in terms of
a transformed time t  t which is the integral of the

the transformed process N t should be Poisson with

times between events in the transformed time t which
if unit variance Poisson should be described by the law

Poisson expectation is 0011 in 1998 and 0031 in 2009
V THE SHAPE OF THE HAWKES KERNEL AT
LARGE LAGS
The results in the previous section demonstrate that
a Hawkes process described by a power-law kernel with
an exponent   015 is indeed a good t to the data in
the millisecond to 5-minute region We will now show
that there is a marked regime change in the nature of
the correlations for larger time horizons To see this we
use Detrended Fluctuation Analysis DFA 34 a com-
monly used tool for detecting long-range correlations in
the presence of trends and non-stationarity More pre-
cisely we compute
F L vuut
N t  fLt2
where N t is the empirical event counting process
formed by concatenating all regular trading hour peri-
ods in 1998-2011 N t is discretised into T 01 second
bins and fLt is a piecewise function formed by the lin-
ear regression to the points N t in non-overlapping win-
dows of length L which cover the period studied If N t
behaved as a Brownian motion with uncorrelated uctu-
ations as for a simple Poisson process we would expect
F L  LH with a Hurst exponent H  1

ence of long-ranged correlations induced by a power-law
Hawkes kernel one nds

Note that this result is not intuitive since the larger the
value of  the faster the decay of the Hawkes kernel but
the stronger the deviation from the Poisson result H  1
This paradoxical behaviour was in fact already apparent
in the relation   1  2 derived in Sect II B above
Fig 5 clearly shows two regions For small time win-
dows L  1000s the Hurst exponent is found to be H 
063 consistent with the observation of   015 in the
previous section For longer time windows L  1000s
the diusion of the integrated event rate becomes more
super-diusive and leads to a stronger Hurst exponent
of H  095 Such a change to a more super-diusive
regime has been observed before for measures of market
volatility 35 36 However these previous studies have
reported the cross-over at the scale of one day whereas
in our dataset for event rate it is happening much faster
10 - 20 minutes We have repeated the same analysis
for absolute value of ve-minute returns and conrmed
that the cross-over time is indeed longer in that case on
the scale of a day
We attribute the dierence to the fact that the distri-
bution of ve-minute returns is well known to have fat-
tails much fatter than the distribution of the number of
price changes over ve minutes The extra noise brought
about by these tails reduce short-time correlations and
therefore bring the value of H closer to 12
The critical power-law Hawkes kernel implied by the
stronger autocorrelation H  095 corresponds to a
larger decay exponent of   045 To visualise the shape
of the Hawkes kernel at these large time scales we es-
timate the auto-covariance of event rate but now using
5-minute binned data over the full 14-year period To do
this we again treat the event rate dataset as one large
continuous time series by concatenating all regular trad-
ing periods The resulting kernel estimate is shown in
Fig 6 Two results can be read from this gure a
again the Hawkes kernel indeed integrates to unity con-
rming the critical nature of the process implied by the
long-memory of event rates as discussed in Sect II b
the exponent   045 extracted from the DFA analysis
correctly describes the time dependence of the Hawkes
kernel in the region  1000 seconds  106 seconds 40
days The value   045 leads to   01 which is
indeed similar to the value of the exponent for the decay
of volatility correlations found in the literature see eg

frequency activity in nancial markets However con-
trary to Filimonov  Sornette 14 but in agreement with
Bacry et al 17 we have found that the Hawkes kernel
that describes how past events inuence future activity
decays as a power-law rather than exponentially The
branching ratio we extract from the calibration of our
model to the mid-point changes in the E-mini SP over
14 years is close to critical and has remained constant
over time contrary to the claim of Filimonov  Sornette
that reexivity has substantially increased since 1998
Nonetheless we uncover that the short lag cut-o of the
power-law kernel which we t has signicantly decreased
over time with the emergence of higher frequency trad-
ing and higher temporal resolution in the market We
have argued that this explains the discrepancy between
our results and those of Filimonov  Sornette Using
both a non-parametric method and Detrended Fluctu-
ation Analysis we have found that the Hawkes kernel
must in fact be described by two power-laws one decay-
ing as   115 for short time scales   1000 seconds
crossing over to a faster decay   145 for longer time
scales This long time regime is consistent with the slow
decay of volatility correlations reported in the literature
The picture which emerges from our analysis is one in
which bursts of diverging trading activity are just as in-
evitable now as they were in 1998 and probably as far
back as nancial markets existed but that the time-scale
over which they may occur has substantially shortened in
the last decade We have shown that the Hawkes kernel
must indeed be critical whenever the event arrival is a
long-memory process Based on this observation and on
the results of Bacry et al 17 on the Bund and the DAX
futures we conjecture that our critical market scenario
is common to most actively traded markets
Interest-
ingly nancial markets appear to be well described by a
critical Hawkes process without ancestors a theoreti-
cal scenario put forth by Bremaud  Massoulie 28 In
non-technical terms this means that the rate of endoge-
nous events in nancial markets is overwhelming com-
pared to that of exogenous news related events A de-
tailed mechanism explaining why markets are precisely
poised at criticality is however still lacking
