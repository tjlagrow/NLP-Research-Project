It is shown that rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes are characterized by the dimensionless ratio
gapemission  O1 where gap is the average time gap between the emission of successive Hawking
quanta and emission is the characteristic timescale required for an individual Hawking quantum to
be emitted from the black hole This relation implies that the Hawking cascade from rapidly-
rotating black holes has an almost continuous character Our results correct some inaccurate claims
that recently appeared in the literature regarding the nature of the Hawking black-hole evaporation
process
INTRODUCTION
Working within the framework of semi-classical general relativity Hawking 1 has revealed that black holes are ac-
tually not completely black In particular it was shown 1 that black holes are characterized by thermally distributed
emission spectra 2 This intriguing nding is certainly one of the most important theoretical predictions of modern
physics
It has recently been pointed out 3 that the Hawking radiation ux out of spherically-symmetric non-rotating
Schwarzschild black holes is extremely sparse see 46 for earlier discussions of this black-hole property In particular
denoting by gap the average time gap between the emissions of successive black-hole quanta and by emission the
characteristic timescale required for an individual Hawking quantum to be emitted from the black hole one nds the
characteristic dimensionless ratio 36

for Schwarzschild black holes
The relation 1 implies that the quantum radiation ux of Schwarzschild black holes is indeed sparse Namely the
average time gap between the emissions of successive Hawking quanta out of a Schwarzschild black hole is very large
on the timescale 2 see Eq 8 below set by the characteristic energy frequency of these emitted quanta Thus
one may safely conclude that the Hawking quanta of an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole are typically emitted
from the black hole one at a time 36
It was also claimed in 3 that adding angular momentum to the black hole makes the dimensionless ratio  even
larger thus making the Hawking emission spectra of rotating Kerr black holes even more sparse than the corresponding
emission spectrum 1 of the non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole Namely it was claimed in 3 that

As we shall show in this paper the claim 2 of 3 is actually erroneous In particular explicit calculations to
be carried below reveal that for rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes a is a decreasing function of the dimensionless
black-hole angular momentum a 7 Moreover as we shall show below near-extremal Kerr black holes are actually
characterized by the relation a  1  O1
II THE HAWKING EVAPORATION PROCESS OF RAPIDLY-ROTATING KERR BLACK HOLES
We study the Hawking emission of gravitational quanta by rotating Kerr black holes The Bekenstein-Hawking
temperature of a Kerr black hole and the angular velocity of its horizon are respectively given by the relations 8

and H 
where r  M  M 2  a212 are the inner and outer horizon radii of the black hole
The Hawking emission rate that is the number of quanta emitted per unit of time out of a rotating Kerr black
hole is given by the Hawking relation 1 9

where x  h  mHTBH Here l and m with l  m are respectively the spheroidal harmonic index and the
azimuthal harmonic index of the emitted quanta and   lm a are the frequency-dependent gray-body factors
9 These dimensionless absorption probabilities quantify the imprint of passage of the emitted black-hole quanta
through the eective curvature potential which characterizes the black-hole spacetime
The Hawking emission rate N a see Eq 4 can be computed along the lines of the numerical procedure described
in 9 In particular one nds that for rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes the Hawking emission spectrum is greatly
dominated by gravitational quanta with the angular indices 9 10

Moreover the characteristic thermal factor that appears in the denominator of 4 implies that for rapidly-rotating
near-extremal TBH  0 black holes the emission of high energy quanta with   mH is exponentially suppressed
Thus for rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes the Hawking emission spectra are eectively restricted to the regime

determines the average time gap between the emissions of successive Hawking quanta On the other hand the
characteristic timescale required for each individual Hawking quantum to be emitted from the black hole emission

oscillation cycle That is 11

momentum a In particular near-extremal Kerr black holes are characterized by the relation a  1  O1
III SUMMARY
It has long been known 36 that the Hawking radiation ux out of Schwarzschild black holes is extremely
sparse
In particular these spherically-symmetric black holes are characterized by the large dimensionless ratio
  gapemission  O102 see Eq 1 As recently pointed out in 3 this relation implies that the individual
Hawking quanta emitted from a Schwarzschild black hole are well separated in time
It was recently claimed in 3 that adding angular momentum to the emitting black hole makes the dimensionless
ratio  even larger see Eq 2 thus making the Hawking radiation spectra of rotating Kerr black holes even sparser
than the corresponding emission spectrum of the non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole
In this brief report we have explicitly shown that the claim 2 made in 3 is actually erroneous In particular
explicit calculations reveal that for rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes a is actually a decreasing function of the
dimensionless black-hole angular momentum a Moreover we have shown that near-extremal Kerr black holes are
characterized by the relation a  1  O1
The relation gapemission  O1 see Eq 9 implies that the Hawking cascade of gravitons from rapidly rotating
Kerr black holes has an almost continuous character Stated in a more picturesque way we can say that on average
there is a gravitational quantum leaving the rapidly-rotating black hole at any given moment of time

10 The last equality in 5 refers to gravitational quanta which are characterized by the spin parameter s  2
11 Note that there is a factor 2 dierence between our denition of oscillation and the corresponding denition used in 3
We believe that the time period 2 required by the emitted wave eld to complete a full oscillation cycle see Eq 8
provides a natural lower bound on the characteristic emission timescale emission of the corresponding Hawking quantum
12 Using in 8 the peak frequency peak of the Hawking emission spectrum instead of the average frequency  of the Hawking
emission spectrum would merely change the dimensionless ratio  by a factor of order unity
13 It is worth emphasizing again that this ratio provides an upper bound on the actual value of a  gapemission see Eq
