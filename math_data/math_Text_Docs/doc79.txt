Viral infection requires the binding of receptors on the target cell membrane to glycoproteins or
spikes on the viral membrane The initial entry is usually classied as fusogenic or endocytotic
However binding of viral spikes to cell surface receptors not only initiates the viral adhesion and the
wrapping process necessary for internalization but can simultaneously initiate direct fusion with the
cell membrane Both fusion and internalization have been observed to be viable pathways for many
viruses We develop a stochastic model for viral entry that incorporates a competition between
receptor mediated fusion and endocytosis The relative probabilities of fusion and endocytosis of a
virus particle initially nonspecically adsorbed on the host cell membrane are computed as functions
of receptor concentration binding strength and number of spikes We nd dierent parameter
regimes where the entry pathway probabilities can be analytically expressed Experimental tests of
our mechanistic hypotheses are proposed and discussed
INTRODUCTION
Viral entry mechanisms are typically classied as either
endocytotic or as fusogenic 1
In the latter the virus
membrane after association with the surface of the host
cell fuses and becomes contiguous with the cell membrane
This process is mediated by the binding of cell surface recep-
tors to glycoprotein spikes on the viral membrane surface
forming fusion competent complexes spanning the viral and
cell membranes
In endocytosis the host cell rst inter-
nalizes the virus particle wrapping it in a vesicle before
acidication-induced fusion with the endosomal membrane
can occur Wrapping can occur only after cell surface recep-
tors that also act as attachment factors bind to the viral
spikes Experimentally both fusion with the cell membrane
and internalization can be observed and distinguished using
microscopy 2 3
Many viruses such as inuenza and hepatitis B use endo-
cytosis as their primary mode of entry 4 5 The surface of
an inuenza virus is coated with  400 hemagglutinin HA
protein spikes 6 The HA adheres to sialic acid-containing
glycoproteins and lipids on the cell surface leading to wrap-
ping of the virus particle Particle wrapping may also be me-
diated by the recruitment of pit-forming clathrincaveolin
compounds 7 Cell membrane pinch-o leading to inter-
nalization of the virus usually requires additional enzymes
such as dynamin and endophilin 9 Endosomal acidica-
tion oligomerizes the HA priming them to fuse with the
endosomal membrane Direct fusion of the inuenza virus
with the host cell membrane is precluded since HA is acti-
vated only in the acidic endosomal environment However
low pH conditions have also been shown to induce the direct
fusion of inuenza virus with certain cells 10
Recent experiments on the avian leukosis retrovirus
ALV have provided evidence both for a pH-dependent di-
rect fusion mechanism 11 12 and an endocytotic pathway
13 Moreover the entry pathway of some viruses such as
Semliki Forest Virus SFV can be shifted from endocyto-
sis to fusion by acid treatment but only in certain host cell
types 14 In this case low pH triggering of receptor-primed
envelope glycoproteins can initiate fusion before the virus
can be wrapped and endocytosed Vaccinia and HIV typi-
cally infecting cells via direct fusion have also been shown
to exploit both entry mechanisms 7 15 16 17 For exam-
ple fusion-independent mechanisms of HIV-1 capture and
internalization in mature dendritic cells mediated by DC-
SIGN 18 can be a signicant mode of HIV transmission
through dendritic cells and lymphatic tissue 19 Capture
by DC-SIGN and CLEC-2 adhesion molecules also internal-
izes HIV in platelets 20 Thus depending upon physical
conditions and cell type both entry pathways are potentially
accessible to certain viruses The choice seems to depend on
the type of receptors the viruses engages whether they are
receptorscoreceptors that induce fusion perhaps triggered
by low pH or simply attachment factors such as sialic acid-
rich glycoproteins that do not induce fusion In this latter
case complete wrapping before an irreversible fusion event
is more likely to occur and internalization is favored
It is not surprising that subtle changes in the interactions
between viral membrane proteins and cell receptors dramat-
ically aect the infectivity of a virus as recently demon-
strated for the 1918 inuenza virus 21 In this paper we
model virus-receptor kinetics and propose a mechanism con-
sistent with the above experimental observations and that
describes viral entry by incorporating both fusion and en-
docytosis entry pathways in a probabilistic manner In the
next section we develop a stochastic one-species receptor
model for the binding of receptors necessary to start the
virus wrapping process These receptors upon binding can
induce membrane fusion at each receptor-spike complex In
the Results we nd parameter regimes in which each of
the entry mechanisms dominate Explicit expressions for
the entry pathway probabilities as functions of the relevant
kinetic rates are given in the Appendix
In the Discus-
sion and Summary we explore the connection between our
parameters and experimentally controllable physical condi-
tions such as receptorcoreceptor density spike density and
cell membrane rigidity Experimental tests are proposed and
extensions of our analysis to more realistically incorporate
biological features are discussed

II SINGLE RECEPTOR KINETIC MODEL
The basic features of our proposed mechanism are shown
in Fig 1 A virus particle initially nonspecically adsorbed
on the cell membrane without any bound receptors can
spontaneously dissociate with rate kd Alternatively mo-
bile receptors in the cell membrane can bind specically to
the glycoprotein spikes assumed here to be uniformly dis-
tributed on the viral surface Successive addition of re-
ceptors to the viral ligands when n are already attached
occurs with rate pn Thus the binding of the rst receptor
occurs with rate p0 Similarly desorption of the nth recep-
tor occurs at rate qn We consider the adsorption of a single
eective receptor or attachment factor to a spike lumping
together the eects of multiple receptorcoreceptor types
This approximation is valid when for example coreceptor
binding is highly cooperative such as suggested in the HIV
infection process where CD4 binding to the gp120 protein
spike induces rapid CCR5 coreceptor binding 22
Receptors not only adhere the cell membrane to the vi-
ral membrane but can also initiate local membrane fusion
at each receptor-spike complex with rate kf  Fusion can
occur at any time during the receptor recruitment process
and is more likely to occur per unit time with more bound
receptors Receptor-spike complexes that are unable to ini-
tiate fusion are described by a vanishing fusion rate kf  0
However if receptors have high fusogenicity kf  the virus
might fuse only after a single receptor has attached Only
if the system reaches a fully wrapped state with N bound
receptors Fig 1f before any fusion event occurs can
pinch-o and endocytosis occur with rate ke The num-
ber of spikes N is typically large varying among viruses
such as HIV N  1523 SIV N  7023 and Inuenza
N  4006 The path to endocytosis is thus a race be-
tween fusion and complete wrapping of a relatively large
number N of viral spikes

receptor-spike complex can initiate membrane fusion with rate

creases linearly The irreversible pinch-o and endocytosis rate
is denoted ke

plexes Starting from a nonspecically adsorbed virus parti-
cle denoted by state n  0 the system progresses along the
chain with the appropriate transition rates corresponding
to attachment and detachment of cell membrane receptors

tachment factors at time t obeys the master equation

Although we describe the general viral entry process in
terms of recruitment and binding of a single type of re-
ceptor our model encompasses processes involving clathrin
or calveolin aggregation and pit formation typically lead-
ing to endocytosis All of these biologically distinct but
physically similar mechanisms can be analyzed by appropri-
ately interpreting the rates For example the nucleation of
a clathrin-coated pit can be modeled by eective binding
and unbinding rates pn and qn that describe the rates of
clathrin addition and removal from the pit Since individual
clathrin molecules are not known to induce membrane fu-
sion the fusion rate kf  0 and only endocytosis or virus
dissociation from the cell surface would occur The fusion
rate is also negligible if the receptor is a simple attachment
factor that adheres the membranes but does not facilitate
fusion
The receptor binding and unbinding rates pn and qn are
related to the cell surface receptor density and the receptor-
spike binding strength respectively The Markov process
shown in Fig 2 implicitly assumes that the receptor re-
cruitment is not diusion-limited  the rate of addition of
successive receptors is independent of the history of previous
receptor bindings
Approximate forms for pn qn can be physically motivated
by considering the number of ways additional receptors can
bind or unbind given that there already exist n receptor-
spike complexes As the membrane progressively wraps
around the virus particle the rate of addition of the next re-
ceptor is proportional to the number np of unattached spikes
bordering the virus-cell membrane contact line L as shown
in Fig 3
For a large number N of uniformly distributed spikes
on a virus particle of radius R the contact area Ac 
4R2nN  2R21  cos n where n  cos1 1  2nN 
is the angle subtended by the contact line when n receptors
are attached Since the area per spike is as  4R2N  the
number of spikes near the contact perimeter L  2R sin n
is found from np  Las Upon using the explicit form for
n we nd the number np of periphery spikes as a function of
Nq1  1  2nN 2
n  1 receptor-bound spikes np 
At a stage where n  1 receptors have bound approximately
np spikes are accessible for additional binding of receptors
Similarly there are approximately np receptor-spike com-
plexes available for dissociation Combinatorically the re-
ceptor binding and unbinding rates take the form 24
FIG 3 Schematic of a partially wrapped virus particle The
unbound spikes above the contact region are represented by open
circles while the receptor-bound spikes in the contact region are
represented by the red-lled circles The number np of spikes
or spike-receptor complexes near the contact perimeter used to
compute pn or qn via Eqs 2 are shown as black dots

where 1  n  N  1 p0 is the intrinsic rate of binding the
rst receptor and q1  qN is the dissociation rate of an in-
dividual receptor-spike complex Since q1 is a spontaneous
receptor-spike dissociation rate it is independent of receptor
density and spike number If the receptor-spike binding en-
ergy is at least a few kBT  we also expect qn to be relatively
insensitive to the cell membrane bending rigidity
A number of physical attributes and biological interme-
diates can be incorporated into the rate parameters to ad-
dress more complicated microscopic processes For example
if thermal uctuations are rate-limiting there would be an
additional factor in pn reecting the probability per unit
time that a patch of membrane uctuates to within a dis-
tance of the virus surface spike that allows receptor-spike
binding The dynamics of this process depends on the cell
membrane tension and rigidity the typical spike spacing
and potentially the viscosity of the extracellular environ-
ment For sti membranes under tension the wrapping of
spherical particles encounters an energy barrier near half-
wrapping 25 which can be incorporated into the dynamics
by assuming an additional factor in pn that has a minimum
near n  N2 Thus the energy barrier associated with
membrane bending will tend to atten the n-dependence of
Particular aspects of the entry process can also inuence
estimates of the other rates If the viral spikes are mobile
and can aggregate to the initial focal point of adhesion the
target cell membrane is not able to fully wrap and endocy-
tosis is prevented The overall kinetic scheme remains un-
changed except with ke  0 Finally the recruitment of sec-
ondary coreceptors that occurs in eg HIV fusion can also
be developed within our current framework and is discussed
in the Discussion and Summary section Although some of
the physical details described above inuence the specic
values of pn we will show that for large N  the qualitative
behavior of our model can be summarized by distinct pa-

When kf  102 the sum of fusion probabilities over all

Therefore only for a particularly small fusion rate kf  and
nonnegligible endocytosis rate ke is internalization possible
We show in the Appendix that generally if pn  qn the
eective drift of the stochastic system towards the wrapped
state renders the partitioning between fusion and endocy-
tosis controlled by the fusion rate kf 
If this is the case
the transition from endocytosis to fusion occurs at approxi-
mately kf  pn  qnN 2 as is conrmed by the numerical
solution for N  20 shown in Fig 5b
Although we have chosen N  20 as a repreentative
spike number dierent viruses and their variants can have
a widely varying number of active spikes In Fig 6 we show
how the entry pathway probabilities depend on the number
N of active viral spikes As N is increased the probabil-
ity for fusion increases at the expense of endocytosis For

receptor-bound the membrane has an appreciable distance
to bend and before full wrapping and endocytosis can oc-
cur Eectively the fusion rate ke starts to decrease if N
gets small such that the rate of membrane uctuations over
a typical interspike distance decreases

kf pn  qn  1N  the probability of reaching a com-
pletely wrapped n  N  state is exponentially small and

entirely partitioned between dissociation and fusion as in-
dicated by the asymptotic expressions for Qi given by Eqs

IV DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
Fusion can be directly distinguished from endocytosis by
imaging uorescent markers loaded into viruses or model
vesicles Upon fusion one expects to see an immediate re-
lease of marker into the periphery of the target cell Simi-
larly single-liposome uorescence imaging experiments that
label and detect vesicle lipids and as they mix with a sup-
ported bilayer upon fusion 26 can be used as in vitro model
systems for virus fusion
In such experiments the model
parameters pn qn kf  ke kd can be tuned by controlling cer-
tain physical chemical properties enabling one to dissect the
mechanism of viral entry The entry pathways delineated
by the dierent parameter regimes described in the previ-
ous section and by the asymptotic formulae given in the
Appendix provide a framework for analyzing and designing
viral entry experiments
The receptor density plays the rst critical role via the
binding rate parameter pn For low receptor densities and
proportionately lower pn but xed spontaneous detachment
rate qn the virus particle can only dissociate or fuse Al-
though lowering receptor concentration decreases the overall
entry probability it can increase Qf Qe the fusion probabil-
ity relative to endocytosis probability see Fig 5a Only
for pn  qn  O1N  can the receptor spike complex fusion
rate kf become important in determining whether fusion or
endocytosis occurs In order for endocytosis to occur the
fusion rates must be small such that kf pn  qn  1N 2
The rate pn can also be substantially decreased by increas-
ing the target membrane surface tension thereby suppress-
ing the thermal uctuations of the membrane required to
bring cell receptors and viral spikes into proximity
The rapid drop-o in endocytosis predicted as the fusion
rate is increased from kf pn  qn  1N 2 to kf pn 
qn  1N 2 especially for large N  shows that tuning
physical conditions such as pH or temperature that af-
fect the fusogenicity of receptor-spike complexes kf  can
have a large eect on the viral entry pathway Recent ex-
periments by Melikyan et al
27 Henderson and Hope
28 and others have shown a rate-limiting intermediate in
the HIV fusion process that can be arrested by lowering
temperature Since CD4 binding was not the rate limiting
step lowering the temperature decreases kf to a degree pre-
sumably much less that pn  qnN 2 preventing fusion
If these systems have the necessary endocytotic machinery
and support pinch-o lowering temperature and arresting
the receptor-spike fusion complex while retaining the adhe-
sive wrapping of receptor-spike binding would enhance the
endocytotic pathway The eective rate kf can also be low-
ered by cross-linking with eg defensins membrane glyco-
proteins rendering their complexes with viral spikes fusion
incompetent 29 However if the cross-linked glycoproteins
retain their attraction for the viral surface the probability
of wrapping and internalization would increase If an inde-
pendent measurement or estimate of pn  qn is available the
dependence of kf on temperature pH and chemical modi-
cation can be probed
Finally pathways to fusion and endocytosis can diverge
for systems that require both primary receptors and sec-
ondary receptors coreceptors If two species are required
one for adhering cell and viral membranes and another
to induce fusion endocytosis will be favored all else be-
ing equal
In this case the initial receptor binding only
causes the cell membrane to wrap around the virus parti-
cle An additional coreceptor must diuse and bind to the
spike-receptor adhesion complex to induce fusion A highly
cooperative receptor-coreceptor interaction such as in HIV
fusion involving CD4 and CCR5CXCR4 is still modeled by
Eq 1 but with the binding rates pn interpreted as an eec-
tive binding rate for both classes of receptor proportional
to the product of their surface concentrations However
if the coreceptor density andor mobility is limiting 17
the binding of receptors occur rst with coreceptor priming
and formation of a fusion competent receptor-spike complex
occurring slowly This allows time for receptor adhesion
molecule mediated membrane wrapping of the entire virus
enhancing the likelihood of endocytosis Thus by main-
taining a high adhesion receptor density and lowering the
fusion-enabling coreceptor density one enhances the endo-
cytotic pathway
