Abstract We study Coleman-de Luccia tunneling in some detail We show that for a
single scalar eld potential with a true and a false vacuum there are four types of tunnel-
ing depending on the properties of the potential A general tunneling process involves a
combination of thermal Gibbons-Hawking temperature uctuation part way up the bar-
rier followed by quantum tunneling The thin-wall approximation is a special limit of the
case of only quantum tunneling where inside the nucleation bubble is the true vacuum
while the outside reaches the false vacuum Hawking-Moss tunneling is the only thermal
uctuation limit of the case where the inside of the bubble does not reach the true vacuum
at the moment of its creation and the outside is cut o by the de Sitter horizon before
it reaches the false vacuum We estimate the tunneling rate for this case and nd that
the corrections to the Hawking-Moss formula can be large In all cases we see that the
bounce of the Euclidean action decreases rapidly as the vacuum energy density increases
signaling that the tunneling is not exponentially suppressed This phenomenon may be
interpreted as a nite temperature eect due to the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the
de Sitter space As an application we discuss the implication of this tunneling property to
the cosmic landscape

1 Introduction
Tunneling in the presence of gravity was rst beautifully analyzed by Coleman and de
Luccia CDL 1 This problem emerges in the study of the early universe in relation to
the inationary epoch and more recently in relation to the cosmic landscape as suggested
by superstring theory However there are properties of the CDL tunneling that remain to
be better understood
Consider a simplied theory of a single scalar eld with potential V  and a canonical
kinetic term in the presence of gravity The potential V  has a false vacuum V at  and
a true vacuum V at  so the energy density dierence between them is   V V  0
The potential barrier between these two local minima has height VT  as shown in Figure 1

Figure 1 Potential V 
In the semiclassical approximation the tunneling rate per unit volume is given by
  AeB
B  SE  SE
where SE is the Euclidean action for the bounce solution and SE is the Euclidean
action evaluated at the false vacuum at  In the thin-wall approximation   0 when
the vacuum energy density is negligible compared to the Planck scale B recovers the result
in the absence of gravity 2 as expected On the other hand as we increase V  V
while still in the thin-wall approximation 3 B takes a dierent form

p  Note that the rst form when V is small is independent of V while the second
form is independent of   V  V We see that for xed   B decreases rapidly as H
increases It seems that we can easily have a situation where B  1 in which case the
tunneling is not exponentially suppressed at all and the evaluation of the prefactor A in
11 as well as sub-dominant contributions to  becomes important
A similar phenomenon seems to be happening in the Hawking-Moss HM tunneling

where V  VT  V Note that if we move V  up without changing its shape that is
keeping   and V xed B decreases like H 3 or H 4 depending on which formula ie
thin wall or HM is applicable In this paper we like to see if and under what conditions
this phenomenon is real More precisely we examine the CDL tunneling more generally to
see when the thin-wall approximation or the HM formula 14 is valid
 2 
CDL tunneling concerns quantum uctuations in the false vacuum of a nucleation
bubble which subsequently grows classically The following picture emerges Depending on
the properties of V  there are four regions in the parameter space yielding four dierent
situations how the nucleation bubble is created 
I The center of the nucleation bubble is in the true vacuum V while the outside of
the bubble reaches the false vacuum V The thin-wall approximation is a special limit
  0 in this case
II The outside of the bubble reaches the false vacuum V but the inside of the
nucleation bubble never reaches the true vacuum V in the Euclidean solution After the
creation of the bubble its inside falls towards the true vacuum V as the bubble grows
III The inside of the bubble reaches V but the outside of the bubble does not reach
the false vacuum in the Euclidean action due to the presence of the de Sitter horizon
IV Not only does the inside of the bubble not reach V the outside of the bubble
does not reach the false vacuum in the Euclidean action due to the presence of the de
Sitter horizon HM tunneling is a special limit in this case
In the absence of gravity regions faraway from the bubble are by denition in the false
vacuum so we have only case I and II In the presence of gravity the de Sitter horizon
cut o the scalar eld  as it tries to reach the false vacuum at large distance from the nu-
cleation bubble 5 That is why case III and IV are possible This phenomenon of cases
III and IV may be interpreted as a Gibbons-Hawking GH temperature TH  H2 ef-
fect This point was recently made by Brown and Weinberg 6 who show that tunneling in
the presence of gravity may be interpreted as a combination of thermal Gibbons-Hawking
temperature uctuation plus quantum tunneling We agree with this picture That is 
thermally uctuates from the false vacuum at  part way up the potential to f  before
quantum tunneling to the other side of the barrier In the Hawking-Moss limit it uctuates
all the way to the top of the barrier at VT  Here our explicit calculations in particular
the determination of f  allow us to estimate in some detail for a given potential the
individual contribution of the thermal uctuation versus that of the quantum tunneling in
the tunneling rate We also evaluate the back-reaction eect on the background geometry
and show that it can be very important
There are a few other properties that are worth mentioning here
 The thin-wall approximation is valid only when the tunneling belongs to case I In
addition to the case I conditions to be specied we see that M 4
P  VT  V  
As we increase VT with a generic xed shape of V  with   0 the tunneling goes over
to case IV via case II andor case III
 For large VT and   0 case IV is generic where HM tunneling is a special limit
Here we estimate the accuracy of the HM formula 14 and its correction We see that the
HM formula for B is an over-estimate by as much as a factor of three That is the actual
decay is a combination of thermal tunneling and quantum tunneling whose rate can be
much faster
 Another interesting point is that tunneling in the absence of gravity is always down-
wards while gravitational eects allow tunneling upwards

Figure 2 The log-log plot of the tunneling exponent B as a function of the Hubble parameter H
for a xed potential V  except for its overall height as measured by H G  1 The three cases
are separated by the two solid vertical lines As H  VT increases the tunneling behavior goes
from case I to case IV via case II that is it goes from the CDL thin-wall approximation to
the left in case I with slope  3 as given by Eq13 to the HM tunneling to the right of
case IV with slope  4 as given by Eq14 For this particular potential the slope case IV
 374 never quite reaches the HM value due to corrections The specic potential used here is
described in Sec 6 Case III does not appear for this potential
 With an overall picture we see that the fast drop o of B as H increases is real This
is illustrated in Figure 2 where case III does not appear due to the particular choice of
the potential used
 Strictly speaking for a general smooth potential with varying parameters the
above four cases may reduce to case IV only However within case IV it contains
regions that resemble the various cases discussed above The triangular potential has four
dierent cases so it actually demonstrates the change from thin wall to HM case more
dramatically but does not change the physics qualitatively
 As B decreases multi-nucleation bubbles will form and the phase transition involves
bubble collisions Once B is small say B  1 Eq11 is no longer valid The prefactor
and sub-leading terms will become important All we can say is that tunneling is no longer
exponentially suppressed The rate of transition depends on the details We do expect
that O4 nucleation bubbles no longer dominate That is bubbles of other shapes as well
as bubble collisions become important The transition can be complicated and is at a fast
time scale Something analogous to spinodal decomposition may happen
In terms of pure thermal Gibbons-Hawking GH temperature tunneling the sup-
pression of the tunneling is interpreted as due to the Boltzmann factor where the bubble
is a 3-sphere and the inverse temperature is treated as an imaginary time with period
 4 
1TH  In case I and II we see that the quantum tunneling is dominant ie has a
smaller value due to the O4 symmetry that is lacking in the nite temperature eect
So strictly speaking the enhancement of the tunneling rate due to a large vacuum energy
density is a pure gravitational eect In de Sitter-like vacua we may interpret this as a
GH temperature eect in the presence of an enhanced here O4 symmetry In case III
and IV the GH temperature starts to play a more prominent role
The same GH temperature will also contribute to the nite temperature eect on the
potential V   V  TH  7 8 This contribution is perturbative in the couplings while
its eect in tunneling is non-perturbative In the nite temperature formalism this leads to
a term of the form T 2
H2 into the nite temperature potential In the gravity perspective
this is simply a coupling of the form R2 where R is the Ricci scalar One an also interpret
this as a nite volume eect due to Gausss law H 22 where H 1 is the horizon size
The overall picture is self-consistent and clear
We shall comment on the impact of the GH temperature on the cosmic landscape both
on the shape of the eective potential of the landscape and on the tunneling rate Because
of fast tunneling when the wavefunction of the universe is high up in the landscape it is
likely that the universe is quite mobile there
For a general potential V  the coupled equations of  and the cosmic scale factor
r are too complicated to solve even in the absence of the gravity except in the thin-wall
approximation However for some special potentials say the triangular potential V 
Figure 3 the bounce B can be obtained analytically 9 So it is natural to consider the
tunneling rates for such a potential in the presence of gravity Unlike Ref9 we cannot get
an exact analytic formula for B in the presence of gravity but the resulting analytic study
gives a very good approximation and does simplify enough for us to see the overall picture
Here the absolute height of the potential which corresponds to the vacuum energy density
is important for tunneling with gravity To be specic we shall adopt this triangular
potential in this paper
The rest of the paper is organized as follows In Sec 2 we briey review the overall
framework of tunneling in de Sitter space This framework is the CDL tunneling formalism
In Sec 3 we go back to tunneling in the absence of gravity
In particular we review
the special case of tunneling in a triangular potential studied by Duncan and Jensen 9
Here we emphasize the formulation that is suitable in the extension of their analysis to
include gravity Sec 4 presents the setup for tunneling in de Sitter space again using the
triangular potential As  varies the tunneling is not happening in pure de Sitter space and
the back-reacrtion is estimated Sec 5 presents the main result of this paper The above
four cases and their conditions are discussed The meaning and implications of the results
are discussed in Sec 6 We then discuss thermal tunneling in Sec 7 Here we are referring
to the treatment of the de Sitter horizon eect as a Gibbons-Hawking temperature eect
In Sec 8 we point out that the Gibbons-Hawking temperature should also modify the
potential via nite temperature eect on potentials We then consider the implication of
the Gibbons-Hawking temperature on the cosmic landscape Sec 9 contains the summary
and some remarks

2 Coleman-de Luccia Tunneling
Let us consider the theory of a single scalar eld  with a potential V  in the presence
of gravity given by
S Z d4xgcid201
g    V  
2cid21 
where   8G  1M 2
The potential V  has a false vacuum V at  and a true vacuum V at  There is
a potential barrier between these two local minima as shown in Figure 1 Let the height of
the barrier at T be VT  We have chosen   T   Let the energy density dierence
between the false and the true vacua be   V  V  0
In the presence of gravity the CDL tunneling rate per unit volume is given by Eq
1112 in term of the coecient B  SE  SE where SE is the Euclidean
action for the bounce solution and SE is the Euclidean action evaluated at the false
vacuum Since a Euclidean solution with a O4 symmetry has an etremum action B is in
general dominated by the bounce solution with O4 symmetry This solution has the
Euclidean metric
ds2  d2  r2d2
where d2
solution is determined by the minimum value of the Euclidean action
s is the metric of a unit 3-sphere The Euclidean equation for the bounce
 
 
pcid18 1
2  Vcid19
r2  1 
where the prime is derivative with respect to  Here the Einstein equation yields one
non-trivial equation since the equation of motion for r follows from Eqs 2324 We
can choose r0  0 Using Eq24 to simplify the Euclidean action one obtains
SE  42Z dcid20r3V 
 cid21
The CDL instanton is a unique solution with the topology of a four sphere S4 in
Euclidean space 10 The geometry after bubble nucleation is described by the analytic
continuation of the CDL instanton to Lorentzian signature The radial coordinate  is
continued to   it and the metric in Lorentzian frame is
ds2  dt2  r2itd2
here the metric is multiplied by an overall minus sign and dH 3 is the element of length for
a unit hyperboloid with timelike normal The metric within the spherical bubble describes
a spatially open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe
As we shall see a qualitative picture emerges depending on the properties of the
potential there are four dierent cases how the nucleation bubble is created 
 6 
I The center of the nucleation bubble reaches the true vacuum V while the outside
of the bubble reaches the false vacuum V The thin-wall approximation is a special limit
  0 in this case
II The outside of the bubble reaches the false vacuum V but the inside of the
nucleation bubble never reaches the true vacuum V in the Euclidean solution After the
creation of the bubble its inside will fall towards the true vacuum V as the bubble grows
III The inside of the bubble reaches V but the outside of the bubble does not reach
the false vacuum V in the Euclidean action due to the presence of the de Sitter horizon
This case and the next case never happen in the absence of gravity since we start with
the false vacuum everywhere Far from the bubble  approaches the false vacuum by
denition However when the vacuum energy is not negligible there is a de Sitter horizon
so it is possible that  hits the horizon before it reaches the false vacuum
IV Not only does the inside of the bubble not reach V the outside of the bubble
does not reach the false vacuum in the Euclidean action The HM tunneling is the limit in
this case Here we are able to estimate the accuracy of the Hawking-Moss formula and its
correction which can be substantial
For a general potential V  the coupled equations 23 24 are complicated to solve
In the absence of the gravity for some simple potentials say the triangular potential V 
Figure 3 the bounce B can be obtained analytically 9 Then it is natural to consider
the tunneling rates for such potentials in the presence of the gravity Unlike Ref9 we
cannot get an analytical formula for B in the presence of gravity but the analysis does
simplify enough for us to see the overall picture Here the absolute height of the potential
which corresponds to the vacuum energy density is important for tunneling with gravity
To be specic we shall adopt this triangular potential in this paper
The triangular potential may be parametrized in the following way Let the height
of the barrier of V  at T be VT  which also provides a measure of the overall vacuum
energy density Let V  VT  V Both   T   and     T are
dened to be positive so the slopes gradients  of V  are given by

Note that in general  6  Since the   V  V  0 we have
 s V

p1  V
  and  Here to simplify the solution we set L  R  
3 Tunneling Without Gravity
When gravity is negligible Eq 24 reduces to r  1 This happens if we set   0
Alternatively this is a very good approximation when the overall height of the potential is
much smaller than the Planck scale
 7 
Figure 3 Triangular potential V  The false vacuum is at V  V  and the true vacuum is
at V  V  with the top of the barrier at VT  V T  Here  and  are the gradients
With r  0  0 we have r   so tunneling reduces to the simple case without
gravity The solution must satisfy the boundary condition
0  0
which is necessary for  to make sense at the center of the nucleation bubble At large
radius we expect
  
  
As we shall see this condition may be modied when gravity is important
Let us rst review the solution to the triangular potential without gravity the case
worked out by Duncan and Jenson 9 For      Eq23 becomes
The general solution is
 
 
 
  a  b2  28
where the constant a and b are determined by the boundary conditions and by matching
the eld values and their derivatives at the top of the barrier which occurs at some radius
T to be determined
It is easy to see that  will reach its false vacuum value at nite radius  to be
determined and then stay there The above boundary condition 32 is replaced by
   
  0
while there are two possibilities to satisfy the condition 31 The rst case namely case
I is when  stays close to  until at radius  when  starts to decrease under Eq33
 8 
The boundary conditions in this case are
   
  0
0    
The other possibility namely case II happens when at the time of creation the inside
of the bubble never reaches the true vacuum In this case the boundary conditions are
 0  0
0  0
where the initial value 0 is to be determined This case only happens if 0 is to the right
side of the barrier ie near  and 0   Also we expect V  V 0  V
31 Case II
Let us consider case II rst On the right and left sides of the barrier we have
 R  0

Now that the unknowns T   and 0 are determined in terms of properties of the potential
V  we simply insert the solution 38 into the Euclidean action and integrate it from
  0 to    The bounce 12 is given by

Let V0  VT  V0  VT  V 0 so using Eq310

which implies that tunneling is always downward and VV0  14
Recall that case II holds only if V0  V or 0   which translates to the above
condition 312 or equivalently   1 where
 s V

In general  is semi-positive If   1 then 0   and one can rewrite the bounce
311 in the following form

32 Case I
If   1 the inside of the bubble reaches the true vacuum V that is 0   At
certain radius   begins to decrease until it reaches  at radius  The region for
   stays at the false vacuum Now the solution  contains four pieces

so T   and  can be solved in terms of the properties of V  Once again one can
insert these solutions of the parameters into the  solution 315 and evaluate the bounce
We nd that it is convenient to introduce the tension to be
    
  Z T

After some algebra B can be written in terms of these values
323 1  1  1  33  1  3  1
where   V  V and 2  VV  1 28 In the limit   1 B in 319 reduces
to B in 314 that is it agrees with B in case II
Here  in Eq 318 should be treated as a convenient denition The value of  as
dened should be very close to the actual domain wall tension For more general potentials
the coecient 23 in Eq 318 will have order one variations Note that V  1 2
In the thin-wall approximation   1 as V becomes small and B reduces to the
usual thin-wall formula for B
23  4
So we see that the thin-wall approximation is inside the region of case I Comparing the
small V case to that in case I Eq312 we see that there is a sizable parameter
region where the thin-wall approximation is not valid For case II since the inside
of the bubble never reaches the true vacuum value  the wall tension does not carry
much physical signicance here The non thin-wall approximation has also been studied in
Ref11
 10 
In summary the regions I and II are divided by the value of  313 case I if
0    1 and case II 0  0   if   1 For   1 only the center of the
bubble reaches the true vacuum
In the absence of gravity the overall height of the potential is not important so the
triangular potential is parameterized by a set of four parameters namely V 
This set can be replaced by an equivalent set V  c The bounce B in Eq311
is expressed in terms of this set where we see that V does not enter since the inside
of the bubble never reaches V In Eq319 we express B in terms of an equivalent set
   which is more convenient when we want to take the thin-wall limit Here we
also see how B behaves as we move away from the triangular potential the leading order
correction is automatically incorporated into the two tension components  by varying
appropriately the 23 coecient in Eq318
If    we see that  simplies somewhat
1  
where 0    1 is given in Eq28 so the dividing point is at c  2  12  017
Often times in our analysis below we shall restrict ourselves to this special case
4 Turning on Gravity
Let us now turn on gravity 1 so the triangular potential has ve parameters namely
V  VT  As noted above at times it may be convenient to choose an alternative
but equivalent set of parameters
To emphasize the eect of gravity let us consider the situation where
VT  V  VT  V
where VT M 4
semi-classical approximation is still valid
P  1 so gravitational eects can be important for the tunneling while the
The equation 23 now reads
r2  1 
L  VT 
where L  22  V  VT is the shifted Euclidean energy By 41 for large VT  we use
the approximation
r2  1 
VT  1  H 2r2
H 2  VT 3M 2
is the Hubble constant of the de Sitter space with vacuum energy VT  So we have
r  H 1 sinH
 11 
where r0  rH  0 That is the range of  is bounded 0    H
It is easy to check that this approximation is self-consistent ie cid12cid12Lcid12cid12  VT  For a
tunneling solution     so
Using Eq23

When   0 2H L  0 and if   2H H L  0 Therefore max L 
maxL0 LH  V So L  VT  and Eq45 is valid to the leading order
in VVT  For later purposes we note that
SE  
242M 4
The equations 23 24 are now decoupled and
  3H cotH 
and can be solved with appropriate boundary conditions This we shall do in the next
section
The bounce solution  will modify the geometric background used ie r in
45 As we shall see it is important to include this back-reaction Inserting  back
into Eq42 we get a rst-order dierential equation of the leading-order correction of r
namely r

sin2H
The formal solution for r is

where the supercial singularity at   2H can be regularized as
r  cosH Z

H 1 sinH   cosH

Notice that by 47 L2H  0 and the integral is well dened Now we can consider

We separate the result into three parts The rst part 413 is 242M 4
p VT  the de-Sitter
space Euclidean action The second part 414 is suppressed by a small factor VVT
comparing with the rst part because by 412 the magnitude of r is of H 1VVT 
and the magnitude V   VT is at most V We will explicitly see that the two terms
in the second part which correspond to r and  contribution are of the same order and
therefore the computation of r in Eq 412 is important The last part represents all
the high order terms of VVT  Notice that by the perturbation r max is no longer
H However the action change induced by max  
H  is of the second order of the
VVT and hence is included in 415
In conclusion if we can get the analytic solution of 49 then the leading order of r
is immediately given by the integral in 412 It then follows that 413 and 414 give
the leading order Euclidean action Subtracting SE given by48 from it we get the
factor B
5 The Four Scenarios of Tunneling in de Sitter Space
In general Eq 51 is still too dicult to solve in a way that the physics is transparent
However for the triangle potential we can solve 51 analytically For the dierent choices
of the ve parameters VT     we nd here are four dierent kinds of Euclidean
solutions for  shown in Figure 4 
in Figure 6
 Case I  reaches both  and  This happens when H 2  1 and
H 2Icid0H 2cid1   where   04 and Ix is a monotonic function shown
 Case II  reaches  but not  That is  reaches  and t where T 
t   This happens when both H 2  1 and H 2Icid0H 2cid1 
 Case III  reaches  but not  That is  reaches f  where T  f  
 This case can happen only when the gradient towards the true vacuum is steeper
than that towards the false vacuum
 are satised
 13 
 Case IV  reaches neither  nor  That is  reaches only f  and t
This case happens when H 2  1 is satised
In the absence of gravity the triangle potential just has two kinds of bounce solutions
9 the cases I and II Here including gravity we have a new bounce solution either
case III or case IV because here there is a cut-o max of the radius coordination  due
to the Hubble radius of de Sitter space So in the nite range 0    H the bounce
solution may reach neither  nor  We will see that case IV is like HM tunneling
the case I is like thin-wall CDL tunneling and case II is an intermediate case between
the two limits By adjusting the ve parameters of the potential we get a transition from
HM tunneling to thin-wall CDL tunneling

To simplify the discussion let us rst consider the symmetric case      so
the analytical solution has a symmetry about   2H and the solution is particularly
simple T  2H It is easy to check that  is a monotonic decreasing function For
this case IV we require that  does not reach  or  in terms of the solution 56

In conclusion if the parameters of the potential satisfy 511 then the
bounce solution is case IV
Before computing r and SE we estimate the magnitude of  By 56
  T 
When  is small and H is large  is conned in a small region which centers at T 
Because   T is the Hawking-Moss bounce solution case IV tunneling is like a uctu-
ation around HM tunneling and will approach the Hawking-Moss solution when H 2 is

Hence LVT  2H 2VT  By the condition 41 and 511 the ratio 2H 2VT   1
and hence LVT  1 and the expansion 412 and 414 works for case IV The only
new issue is that for case IV the small expansion factor is 2H 2VT not VVT  simply
because the bounce solution 56 does not feel  The integral 412 is carried out
analytically and by 413414 and 415 we nd that the two terms in the leading
order correction have the same form

where C  C1  C2  6549 is a positive constant C1  19647 corresponds to the r
contribution and C2  26196 is from  So we see explicitly that the two terms in Eq
414 are comparable That is the back-reaction is important The above result has a
simple interpretation that we shall describe in Sec 6
Since the Hawking-Moss scenario is a special limit in this case let us treat this decay
as a HM transition with a correction to the HM formula that can be explicitly evaluated
So B is given by

The rst term is just the Hawking-Moss bounce BHM 14 while the second term correc-
tion from this bounce solution lowers B and therefore the actual tunneling rate is larger
than that given by the HM formula
For VT  V the rst term in the bounce 515 is largely cancelled by S so the
corrections can be important Rewriting the bounce formula as

Figure 5 The function gc
Since both   1 511 and VVT  1 we see that the correction to the HM formula is
at most 23 1
The picture of case IV is consistent with the interpretation proposed in 12 13
14 HM tunneling should be interpreted as a quantum uctuation up the potential barrier
Here we see that the eld will thermally uctuate from V at  up to V LH  VT
at LH   tunnel to R0   and then classically roll down to 
limit where VVT  0 VT is simply reached via the thermal uctuations alone Here
we see that the correction is typically not very big and the HM formula is quite good in
general On the other hand as   1  251 LH   the outside of the bubble
can reach the false vacuum within the horizon When this happens the HM formula is no
longer accurate

action not the HM tunneling exponential factor BHM  So the correction though large compared to BHM 
is still much smaller than the zero order de-Sitter space Euclidean action Hence the leading correction
yields a very good approximation here That is the last term in Eq515 or 516 is negligible

which means that the leading order correction is at most about 64 We see that the HM
formula is an over estimate of the value of B by as much as a factor of three
52 Case III
Here we shall simply show that this case where  reaches  but not  in the Euclidean
solution exists for some choice of the potential Following the above solution 56 we have

For V  VR and V  VL we have still have the case IV Now we can consider
potentials where

decreasing  while keeping other parameters xed which belongs to case III This
demonstrates that case III exists for some types of potential Here is an explicit example
when   0005   0004   1  107   05  107 VT  077  106 the
bounce solution which is plotted in Figure4 does reach  but not 
On the other hand for c  1 that is when the gradient towards the false vacuum
is steeper than that towards the true vacuum the Euclidean solution has VR  VL
This means the tunneling is from VL  VT  VL going up to VR  VT  VR As noted
earlier this tunneling up phenomenon does not happen in the absence of gravity So this
possibility is a gravitational eect This phenomenon has been studied in 15
Note that this case which reaches  but not  does not exist for the symmetric
     case In this case c  1 so that VR  VL and the above condition
530 cannot be satised unless VR  V  VL which means that  does reach
the false vacuum value This corresponds to the cases we shall now turn to in the next
subsection
53 Case II
To see the existence of this case we may restrict ourselves to the symmetric   
case Since   we can have the situation where
 
H 2  
That is the condition 511 does not hold Instead we now have
  
H 2  1
In this case  reaches the false vacuum V at  outside the bubble within the
horizon but the bubble inside never reaches the true vacuum V at  at the moment of
creation In this case the solution of 51 contains three pieces

x   H

We have ve parameters to determine C1 C2 A T   and also ve equation from 535

Because the functions f1 and f2 contain only pure number coecients the dimensionless
parameters A HT  H are determined just by the combination   H 2 So we
may rewrite them as functions of 1 which can be obtained numerically Then we can
insert A HT  H back into 535 we will get all the parameters

Equation 539 together with 532 is the condition for case II The function Ix is a
monotonic function which is plotted in Figure6 Notice that Ix  x therefore
0  T  
which means the quantum tunneling is from the false vacuum V to someplace lower than
V but not exactly at V After the realization of quantum tunneling V will continue to
drop classically until reaching V the true vacuum After getting the solution  one uses
the formulae 412 413 and 414 to get the factor B for the case II Notice here
 does not reach  so actually the small expansion factor is not VVT but an even
smaller factor VVT

So we have seven parameters to determine C1 C2 A1 A2  T   and also seven equa-
tions from 544 Like case II we can reduce the number of both the parameters and
the equations and then solve it The solution looks like the thin-wall tunneling solution
in 1 The reason is by the condition 541  cannot be very small comparing with
 so the energy dierence of the two vacua   V  V cannot be large and the
thin-wall approximation may apply Again after getting the solution of  we can get
the Euclidean action and B by 412 413 and 414
It is clear that the thin-wall approximation belongs to case I since the inside of the
bubble reaches  while the outside reaches  see Figure 4 The thin-wall approximation
requires a rapid transition of  from  to  This case has been analyzed in Ref3

vacuum This is reasonable otherwise the bubble cannot be generated causally

In the other limit of R  R which corresponds to V  V  V  Vs  223 2 
3 28 This happens at the high energy scale in the landscape and the bubble radius is
given by R p3V  Now B is dominated by the rst term in Eq550 namely
Btw  632 V 32 
In the units where Mp  1 or equivalently   1 the tension of the bubble satises   1
In Planck region V  1 B  1 and   1 At low energy scale the background curvature
radius is quite large and the bubble size is relatively small and then the tunneling rate is
insensitive to the vacuum energy of the false vacuum
The familiar CDL thin-wall approximation occurs in case I however a solution
of the case I is not necessarily the thin-wall solution ie the tunneling factor Btw
determined by the thin-wall approximation may not be very accurate To illustrate this
point we compare the values of Btw with our computation for case I
We x G  1   1  107 T  0   0005 and vary the variables  and VT 
We dene
V  V
VT  V
  
 23 
which is always positive and we may expect that when  is close to 0 the thin-wall ap-
proximation is accurate We reserve B for our result for the tunneling exponential factor
from Eq412 Eq413 and Eq414 while Btw denotes the counterpart of the thin-wall
approximation formula 552 given in Ref3 We plot the relative deviation of the two
methods Btw  BB as a function of r and VT in the contours of Figure 7
In the contour gure we draw the range 001    02 and 5108  VT  75107
The reason for the VT range choice is that if VT is too small then our expansion is not good
and if VT is too large case I will turn into case II From the gure we can see
 The contour lines are roughly vertical and the relative dierence Btw  BB in-
creases from the left to right It means that when  is small the thin-wall approxima-
tion coincides with our computation and so veries that the thin-wall appoximation
is good when  is small
 However the contour lines are not completely vertical but tilt from the top left
to the bottom right It means when  is xed and VT is increasing the dierence
is getting larger and larger An immediate explanation is
in this situation the
solution is moving toward case II and nally when tunneling becomes case II
the dierence is very large since the solution does not reach  in contrast to the
thin-wall approximation Or by the Euclidean equation of motion if VT is large H
which serves as a damping term is also large and slows the evolution of the Euclidean
solution So the wall is not thin as before
Although unlike case IV it is hard to get the analytic form of B for case I because of
the transcendental Eq544 However it is helpful to look at the numerical computation
For example for a potential with small   V  V like   1  107 VT  02  106
  0005 and   00055 the zero-order of the SE by Eq413
is SE0 
187500000  106 Eq414 gives the leading order correction SE1  SE1r  SE1
where SE1r  478705 is the rst term in 414 from r contribution and SE1 
769197 is the second term induced by  Therefore we explicitly see that the leading-
order corrections SE1r and SE1 are much smaller than the zero order SE0 and the
perturbation series for SE is valid To get the factor B we needs to compute S which
is 18796992  106 so
B  SE  S  SE0  SE1r  SE1  S
 179432
which is quite close to the thin-wall approximation result Btw  184876 by Eq550
We see that it is crucial to include the back-reaction eect due to r here In fact if we
drop the contribution from r in Eq414 then Br-excluded  SE0  SE1 S 
2992 which is negative and has no physical meaning The importance of the r term in
Eq414 cannot be over-emphasized
 24 
6 Discussion
Let us comment on the physical meaning of the cases other than case I For case II
after the realization of quantum tunneling the eld will evolve by the classical equation
Coleman 2 points out that instead of going back to solve the Minkowski Lorentz equa-
tion we can get the classical solution directly from the Euclidean solution by analytical
continuation For 9 we can verify that after the quantum tunneling the eld will con-
tinue to roll down until reaching the true vacuum This also happens in de Sitter space
After the creation of the nucleation bubble with radius R at time t  0 the evolution of the
surface of the bubble is described by the Lorentzian action where 2  R2  r2  t2 The
center of the bubble starts at   0 and as t increases 2  t2 becomes negative at the
center By analytic continuation starting with r  0 t  0   0 t falls towards
 It may overshoot and oscillates about the true vacuum at  With Hubble or any
additional damping it will eventually settle at the true vacuum as the nucleation bubble
continues to grow In case III and case IV  at the bubble outside is also expected
to follow classical motion and roll down towards the false vacuum at  while in a GH
thermal bath However since the bubble is growing rapidly at the same time the true
vacuum may be reached before  has time to roll to the false vacuum
Let us show the dierent features of the tunneling by an explicit example The type
of tunneling is determined by the parameters of the potential VT     and 
First we want to see the dependence of the exponent B on H for large H We set G  1
and x T  0   0007   0005   1  107 so the shape of the potential
is xed We can move the potential up and down by varying VT hence H to see the
dependence of B on H
 The condition for case IV   1 reads VT  949476 107 For example we can
plot the solution of r for VT  2  106 in the last picture of Figure 4 and it is
clear that neither  nor  is reached The exponential factor B can be obtained
by Eq516 B  417301 The HM tunneling exponential factor for this potential
is BHM  468867 hence the case V tunneling rate is close to the HM tunneling
but faster than it The relative dierence of B is about 11
 When   1 we need to consider the condition
H 2 Icid18 H 2
cid19  
which reads 949476  107  VT  646586  107 If it is satised the tunneling
is of case II For example we plot the solution for VT  90  107 in Figure 4 and
nd that  reaches  but not 
 If this condition is also violated ie VT  646586  107 the tunneling is case I
2 For example the solution of VT  30  107 is plotted in Figure 4 and  reaches
both  and  Eq414 gives B  928714 while the thin-wall approximation
2Notice that our approximation works for VT  V which reads VT  7  1010
 25 
Eq552 gives Btw  101982 The relative dierence is about 98 due to the nite
dierence of V and V So the bubble wall is not thin enough for this potential
As H is decreased from a large value the tunneling type goes from case IV to case
II and nally to case I The corresponding exponent B for dierent cases are plotted
in Figure 2 as a function of H It is straightforward to see the dependence on the shape of
potential say by varying    and xing   0007   0005 VT  8  107
we can also see the transition among the three cases Notice the combination xI1x is
monotonically increasing function of x so the conditions can be solved easily in 
 For   84257  108 we have case IV
 For 84257  108    123727  107 we have case II
 for   123727  107 we have case I
Therefore case IV which is close to HM tunneling happens for a atter barrier small
 while case I of which thin-wall tunneling is a special case happens for a sharper
barrier large 
We may write the factor B 12 as composed of two terms
B  SEf   SE  SEbounce  SEf 
where T  f    For cases I and II we have f    so the rst term vanishes
For cases III and IV f    so both terms contribute In the limit f   T 
  T  so the second term vanishes and the resulting formula reduces to the HM
limit The picture is consistent with the interpretation in 12 13 14 However as we
have pointed out corrections and back-reaction can introduce large corrections to the HM
formula
Brown and Weinberg 6 showed that the CDL tunneling rate can be derived by treating
the eld theory on a static patch of de Sitter space as a thermal system In this thermal
system tunneling does not need to occur from the bottom of the false potential well
Instead tunneling proceeds by a combination of thermal excitation part way up the barrier
followed by quantum tunneling through the barrier The tunneling rate is a thermal average
of the energy-dependent quantum tunneling rates 19
 Z dEeEET eJE
where E is the energy of the eld conguration Here the quantum tunneling rate is given
by WKB approximation JE  2R t
Euclidean path from one classical turning point f  to the other classical turning point

since the integral is along a solution to the Euclidean equations of motion Fixing T  TH
determines E and so f  and t This yields JE  SEbounce  SEf  This
result also implies that the tunneling takes a Euclidean time   12TH and

That is ETH  SEf  and ETH  SE Using this result in the saddle-point
approximation to 63 one nds
  eSE f SEeSE bounceSE f 
which reproduces the standard CDL tunneling rate So our result 62 agrees with this
result of Ref6 the rst term in 62 corresponds to a thermal ie Gibbons-Hawking
temperature uctuation from the false vacuum at  part way up the barrier to f  and
the second term in 62 corresponds to a quantum tunneling Note that the derivation of
Ref6 assumes a xed de Sitter background while the back-reaction which can be large
is included in our derivation In this sense our result is a big improvement In Sec 51
we calculated the SEbounce and determined f  for a given triangular potential This
allows us to compare quantitatively the contribution from the GH thermal eect to the
contribution from the quantum eect in such a tunneling
7 Thermal Tunneling
At nite temperature the transition from V to V can also occur via thermal uctuations
21 So there is another contribution due entirely to the GH temperature uctuation The
dominant thermal tunneling process is the formation of O3 symmetric bubbles of V that
minimize the change in entropy S Let us evaluate the rate of this process and compare
it to the above tunneling process The thermal tunneling rate is given by
eS  eFT
where F is the change in the free energy We can think of the free energy as a three-
dimensional action

for a scalar eld with a standard kinetic term In this case the equations of motion are

We restrict our attention to the symmetric triangle potential as before In the large
VT limit considered above the general solution to 74 is

H 2cid0A 
Like the Euclidean case discussed above there are also four types of thermal tunneling
solutions
 Case I  reaches both  and 
 Case II  reaches  but not 
 Case III  reaches  but not 
 Case IV  reaches neither  nor 
We will begin our discussion with case IV as it is the simplest
71 Case IV
In this case we need to solve 73 with the boundary conditions 55 The solution to
these equations is
cotH
H 2cid18 H
cotH 
cotHcid19

This solution is valid if
H 2
Comparing 79 to 511 we see that the existence of a case IV Euclidean tunneling
solution implies the existence of a case IV thermal tunneling solution and that some poten-
tials will admit a case IV thermal tunneling solution and a case II Euclidean tunneling
solution
Evaluating 72 using 78 we nd that for a specic background temperature
S3TH

To compare to the HM bounce 14 we nd the ratio at leading order
S3TH  1
Based on the discussion in the last section this result is expected and consistent with
18 One should compare this thermal tunneling to the stochastic tunneling process of
12 13 14
72 Case II
Case III tunneling only occurs when  6  as in the Euclidean case Since it does not
show any special new feature we shall skip this case
In case II we need to solve 73 with the boundary conditions 535 Imposing the

 We can then use

Numerically we nd that IS3 H 2
V to some VF where V  VF  V as we saw above in case II Euclidean tunneling
so case II thermal tunneling is always from
  H 2
73 Case I
When 79 and 718 are both violated we have case I thermal tunneling Here we need to
solve 73 with the boundary conditions 544 numerically if the thin-wall approximation is
not valid In general the solutions have the same qualitative features as in case I Euclidean
tunneling but the Euclidean bounce B is smaller than S3TH 
Thin-wall CDL tunneling is a special case of I The thin-wall approximation greatly
simplies calculations so for the remainder of this section we consider a general potential
 29 
that satises the thin-wall conditions The dierence between the CDL and thermal tun-
neling rates has to do with R4 space in CDL versus R3  S1 space in the thermal case
where S1 corresponds to   1T  2H In the thin-wall approximation we can divide
the integration in 72 into three parts For a bubble of radius r we have S3out  0 and

Since R  R we see that the Euclidean S4 bounce B is smaller so it dominates
For large R  R

It is easy to understand the origin of this factor of four In CDL we have S3 with size 22
versus S2  S1 with size 4  2  82 in the thermal case This just shows that the O4
symmetry lowers the Euclidean action B and so yields the correct answer
Note that this is true only for B  1 Recall that

If this condition is not satised say when B  1 then this factor of four dierence may
be overcome by the dierence in the prefactors A0 and AT  Callan and Coleman 20 show
that for bounce B

where the prime on the determinant implies that the four zero modes are removed yielding
the rst factor This prefactor is dicult to evaluate in general so here we shall use
dimensional arguments to nd an order of magnitude estimate

The dierence is that here the temperature T is the Gibbons-Hawking temperature TH
which strictly speaking is a gravitational not thermal eect
This means that the potential V should now include the nite temperature eect
V i  V i TH  The eective potential in de Sitter space has been calculated for some
simple potentials in 7 8 As expected based on the GH temperature interpretation the
eective potential for scalar electrodynamics in de Sitter space calculated in 7 shows the
same behavior as one varies the inverse radius of de Sitter space as the eective potential
in Minkowski space as one varies the temperature For a phenomenological potential as in
a slow-roll inationary scenario one may assume this nite temperature eect and other
quantum eects is already built into the potential However in string theory applica-
tions to cosmology where the eective potential can be calculated given a specic model
such nite GH temperature eects should be included Here let us consider some specic
examples
8 Tunneling in the Cosmic Landscape
We consider a type IIB compactication with the moduli stablized by a combination of
uxes and a nonperturbative superpotential as in 22 These compactications typically
have a large number of axions i corresponding to integrals of the four-form potential
over each of the independent four-cycles Independent nonperturbative eects in the ux-
induced superpotential give rise to a periodic potential

where fi is the decay constant M is a natural mass scale say the string scale and
the ith instanton has action Si
inst V  contains the potential coming from the moduli
and includes D-term contributions The shift symmetries associated with these axions are
broken by nonperturbative eects Including the eect of a single Euclidean D3-brane for
each independent four-cycle the axion potential becomes 23

CDL tunneling has an exponentially faster rate than thermal tunneling We see that B varies by
25 orders of magnitude Tunneling is exponentially enhanced when the wavefunction is higher up
ie larger VT  in the landscape
where V0i is a smooth function of i due to D-terms Here typical i are exponentially
small compared to the string scale It is easy to estimate i along the i direction Let
i  i Pj6i ij so the height of the potential barrier in the i direction is 2i Then

Tunneling can be fast if the axion decay constant f is suciently small Cosmological
upper bounds on the amount of axionic dark matter constrain f to be below 1012 GeV and
astrophysical measurements of the cooling of red giants constrain f to be at least 109 GeV
24 For example if we take fi  1010 GeV within this observationally preferred region
and choose i  2  107Mp4 then   1 for H  107Mp and N  10 For smaller f
the tunneling rate  can be order one for even smaller H For model-independent axions
in heterotic string theory f is generically between 11  1016 GeV and the reduced Planck
mass 24 If we choose fi  11  1016 GeV for N  100 there is no choice of i   and

For relatively large H or T  we have instead

V it2eSi3T
where it is the value of i at the top of the barrier
So it is reasonable to expect that the wavefunction of the universe tends to spread
along some of the axionic directions This what we expect for the QCD vacuum that is
the wavefunction is a Bloch wave with angle QCD As we go up in the cosmic landscape
say turning on D-terms tunneling will be faster and so the wavefunction will be Bloch
wave-like in more of the axionic directions If we start with the wavefeunction localized as
a classically stable vacuum site it will take time for the wavefunction to spread This time
will be shorter when we are higher up in the landscape and when there are more axionic
directions present
However here V i should be replaced by V i T  Instead of calculating this we can
make another estimate In quantum mechanics tunneling through a barrier becomes less
suppressed when the energy of the particle increases This happens when the particle is in a
thermal bath with rising temperature In quantum eld theory thermal eects typically lift
the potential in a way such that the tunneling becomes faster until the barrier disappears
ie the tunneling probability approaches unity
For 4 theory with

we have for high temperature T

so the eective mass term is no longer tachyonic for T  Tc where the critical temperature

For any direction in the moduli space if

Expanding the above potential about a maximum top of a barrier we have
V   
2f 2 2

we see that if in any direction
then there is no barrier in that direction so the wavefunction is coherent along that di-
rection Even if this condition is not satised we see that the nite TH eect will enable
i  T 2

to wavefunction to be coherent along some direction quickly approaching a wavefunction
similar to a Bloch wave
In fact compactication and moduli stabilization usually introduces a term like H 22
which will tend to remove a lot of barriers This term arises from Gauss Law Actually
this is the term that causes the  problem for slow-roll ination
In a single dimension at low scales these eects are probably negligible without a large
degree of ne-tuning For example consider a de Sitter vacuum in ux compactication
in string theory with all moduli xed
In the KKLT model 22 a highly warped type
IIB compactication with nontrivial uxes is stabilized using non-perturbative eects from
Euclidean D-branes and gaugino condensation The resulting anti-de Sitter minimum for
the imaginary part of the volume modulus  is uplifted to a de Sitter minimum by adding
a small number of D3 branes The presence of the D3 branes induces a term D3 where
D depends on the warp factor and the number of D3 branes The potential is

In this model if one tunes the parameters to have the de Sitter minimum be the cosmological
constant observed today the tunneling rate is exponentially long
The Gibbons-Hawking temperature eects are unimportant in the KKLT model be-
cause in the regime where the calculation is under control   1 the de Sitter vacuum
is necessarily exponentially suppressed compared to the Planck scale Increasing D both
increases the false vacuum and decreases the barrier The de Sitter vacuum disappears
classically if the D-term uplifting is too large Since the true vacuum is always Minkowski
in this model HM tunneling dominates if the de Sitter vacuum is large The HM bounce is
BHM  242M 4
p VT  1 in this model and VVT  1 only when
the barrier is about to disappear classically the GH temperature corrections are small in
this case Numerical calculations approximating the maximum with a quartic potential
and computing the nite temperature corrections using the GH temperature also show
that the region of parameter space in which the de Sitter minimum is present classically
but unstable quantum mechanically is extremely small

9 Summary and Remarks
In this paper we discuss the relation between CDL thin-wall tunneling and HM tunneling
The picture is in agreement with the qualitative understanding one has already but the
details allow us to obtain a quantitative understanding of the validity of each approximation
and the sizes of the corrections This result does allow us to say something about the stringy
cosmic landscape Here are a few comments that may be relevant in no particular order
 When we are high up in the cosmic landscape gravitational eects exponentially
enhance the tunneling rate Qualitatively one may interpret this as a GH temperature
eect but the actually enhancement is exponentially larger than a naive estimate based on
the usual temperature eect due to the enhanced O4 symmetry of the Euclidean action
versus the SO3  U 1 symmetry in the nite temperature case
 34 
 Above the GUT scale quantum gravity eects become important and we have noth-
ing to say in this case Around or slightly below the GUT scale the tunneling can easily
be enhanced by so much that there is simply no exponential suppression at all and the
semi-classical formula simply breaks down This is in the single eld case with only one
tunneling direction In the multi-eld d  1 case as we expect to be the situation in the
cosmic landscape there are typically many tunneling directions for any false vacuum so
one expects fast tunneling to take place
 As is well known see Appendix A in Ref
3 for a generic spherical potential in
d  3 spatial dimensions the extra dimensions acts as an angular momentum like repulsive
potential with angular momentum l  d  32 So it is harder to form a bound state
in higher dimensions as is the case in the cosmic landscape Instead of having a bound
wavefunction that has to tunnel out we may have a resonance like situation where the
decay time can be very short Even if the wavefunction is trapped it is more likely to be
weakly trapped so the wavefunction has a long tail outside the classically allowed region
rendering less suppressed tunneling
 It is again well known that the nite temperature eect on the eective potential
In fact compactication and
tends to decrease the barrier allowing faster tunneling
moduli stabilization usually introduces a term like H 22 which will tend to remove a lot
of barriers This term a nite volume eect arises from the equivalent of the Gausss
Law Actually this is the term that causes the  problem for slow-roll ination 25 Here
a similar term arises due to the nite temperature eect on the potential One may re-
interpret this eect as a nite volume eect due to the presence of the Gibbons-Hawking
horizon 1H
 Even if the barriers are still present that is not completely lifted we see that
the nite TH eect will enable the wavefunction to be coherent along some direction more
quickly This is particularly likely along the axionic directions since the eective potential
is periodic or close to being periodic and the heights of the barriers can be very low In this
situation the wavefunction approaches a Bloch wave Presumably the QCD  vacuum we
live in today is described by such a Bloch wave
 Since there are many vacua in the stringy landscape resonance tunneling eects
should play an important role in the landscape 26 This also enhances the tunneling
among the vacua in the landscape Such enhancement can be substantial In particular
its role in the development of the Bloch wave is well known
 With all these observations one suspects that the wavefunction of the universe in
the cosmic landscape may be quite mobile that is it does not stay at any particular
vacuum site long enough to allow eternal ination However without a detailed knowledge
of the structure of the landscape vacuum sites and their nearby neighbors as well as the
barriers between them it is dicult to make denitive statements As we just pointed out
the wavefunction most likely is spread out along the periodic directions ie the axionic
directions as Bloch waves so what happens to the aperiodic directions If we treat such
directions randomly ie as a random potential one may borrow the insight obtained in
condensed matter physics to argue that the wavefunction should be fully mobile along these
directions as well 27 This implies that eternal ination in the landscape is very unlikely
 35 
This argument is based on the large dimensionality of the landscape and does not use
the gravitational eects discussed in this paper so it should apply all the way to very low
vacuum energy density sites
