Abstract 
Receptor-ligand binding is a critical first step in signal transduction and the duration of 
the interaction can impact signal generation In mammalian cells clustering of receptors 
may  be  facilitated  by  heterogeneous  zones  of  lipids  known  as  lipid  rafts  In  vitro 
experiments show that disruption of rafts significantly alters the dissociation of fibroblast 
growth  factor-2  FGF-2  from  heparan  sulfate  proteoglycans  HSPG  co-receptors  for 
FGF-2 In this paper we develop a continuum stochastic formalism in order to address 
how  receptor  clustering  might  influence  ligand  rebinding  We  find  that  clusters  reduce 
the  effective  dissociation  rate  dramatically  when  the  clusters  are  dense  and  the  overall 
surface  density  of  receptors  is  low   The  effect  is  much  less  pronounced  in  the  case  of 
high  receptor  density  and  shows  non-monotonic  behavior  with  time  These  predictions 
are  verified  via  lattice  Monte  Carlo  simulations    Comparison  with  FGF-2-HSPG 
experimental results is made and suggests that the theory could be used to analyze similar 
biological systems  We further present an analysis of an additional co-operative internal 
diffusion model that might be used by other systems to increase ligand retention when 
simple rebinding is insufficient 
I INTRODUCTION 
The  cell  membrane  is  composed  of  many  different  types  of  lipid  species  This 
heterogeneity  leads  to  the  possibility  of  organization  of  different  species  into  distinct 
domains 1 Such domains are especially suited and designed for specialized functions 
such as signal transduction nutrient adsorption and endocytosis They can link specific 
cellular  machinery  and  physical  features  and  are  equipped  with  mechanisms  for 
maintenance  addition  and  removal  of  specific  molecules  for  a  certain  period  of  time 
during which the domains may diffuse as single entities 2 Lipid rafts which are micro-
domains rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol represent one of the most interesting but 
insufficiently understood lipid domains 3 Various estimates are available for raft sizes 
and diameters in the range 25-200 nm have been reported using various methods 4 A 
limitation  in  this  area  remains  that  the  definition  of  lipid  rafts  is  rather  broad  and 
currently includes a wide range of what will likely prove to be distinct domains that may 
be  distinguished  by  the  particular  protein  and  lipid  compositions  245  Operational 
definitions  of  rafts  based  on  resistance  to  detergent  solubilization  and  sensitivity  to 
cholesterol removal are limited by artifacts of the various procedures used to define rafts 
and  on  difficulties  in  relating  model  membranes  to  cell  membranes  Nonetheless  it  is 
clear that cell membranes are not homogeneous and that protein-protein protein-lipid and 
lipid-lipid  interactions  all  participate  in  regulating  raft  size  dynamics  and  function  
Consequently a myriad of functions have been prescribed to lipid rafts one possibility 
being  that  lipid  rafts  may  serve  as  mediators  of  signal  transduction  for  several  growth 
factors including fibroblast growth factor-2 FGF-2 6-8 
         
Growth factors act as triggers for many cellular processes and their actions are typically 
mediated  by  binding  of  ligand  to  the  extracellular  domain  of  transmembrane  receptor 
proteins  For  many  receptors  signal  transduction  requires  dimerization  or  clustering 
whereby  two  or  more  receptors  following  ligand  binding  interact  directly  to  facilitate 
signal transduction While ligand binding is generally specific to members of a family of 
transmembrane receptor proteins heparin-binding growth factors such as FGF-2 interact 
with  both  specific  members  of  the  FGF  receptor  family  and  heparan  sulfate 
glycosaminoglycan  chains  of  cell  surface  proteoglycans  HSPG  HSPG  represent  a 
varied  class  of  molecules  including  the  transmembrane  syndecans  the  glycosyl-
phosphotidylinositol  anchored  glypicans  and  extracellular  proteoglycans  such  as 
perlecan reviewed in 910 The interaction of FGF-2 with HSPG is of a lower affinity 
than to the cell surface signaling receptor CSR but has been shown to stabilize FGF-2-
CSR  binding  and  activation  of  CSR  1112  Moreover  HSPG  have  recently  been 
demonstrated  to  function  directly  as  signaling  receptors  in  response  to  FGF-2  binding 
leading to the activation of protein kinase C alpha 12 and Erk12 6  
There is evidence that cell surface HSPG are not distributed uniformly but are instead 
localized in lipid rafts 614-16 and this association may be facilitated by FGF-2 binding 
and  clustering  17  This  localization  and  clustering  may  further  have  a  dramatic 
influence on signaling through both persistence of signaling complexes and localization 
with  intracellular  signaling  partners  For  example  FGF-2  dissociation  kinetics  from 
HSPG  were  significantly  altered  when  cells  were  treated  with  the  lipid  raft-disrupting 
agents methyl- -cyclodextrin Mb CD Fig 1 Retention of FGF-2 even at long times 
was significantly greater in the untreated state suggesting that rafts regulate this process 
These experiments suggest that clustering of HSPG in lipid rafts effectively slows down 
dissociation by increasing the rebinding of released FGF-2  If this is indeed true then the 
localization of binding sites to micro-domains on the cell surface could be an important 
mechanism employed by receptors to boost signal transduction via increased persistence 
The relation between the apparent association and dissociation rates of ligands interacting 
with receptors on a spherical cell surface with the corresponding intrinsic rates has been 
studied previously by several authors 18-23  Berg and Purcell 18 demonstrated that 
for  ligands  irreversibly  binding  to  N  receptors  on  a  spherical  cell  of  radius  a   the 
effective  forward  rate  constant  becomes  a  non-linear  function  of  N  assuming  the  form 
 where  k  is the association rate for a single receptor in 
close  proximity  to  the ligands  ie  the intrinsic  binding  rate  The  quantity  in  brackets 
was  termed  the  capture  probability by  Shoup  and  Szabo  19  The  effective 
dissociation  rate  was  analogously  defined  as  the  product  of  the  intrinsic  rate  and  the 
escape probability 1-

-k   is  the  intrinsic  dissociation  rate  and  Dk    Da
  for  a  spherical  completely 
absorbing  surface  represents  the  diffusion-limited  association  rate  illustrating  how 
increasing receptor numbers lead in general to a decrease in apparent dissociation rate 
This result was later extended to include the presence of solution receptors by Goldstein 
et al 24 Association of ligands to a cluster of receptors on a planar surface which also 
includes the surface diffusion of ligands inside the cluster was investigated by Potanin et 
al 26 This study predicted a non-monotonic variation of the forward rate constant with 
cluster size that was found to fit better with some experimental results 
In general the effective dissociation rate of ligands from a set of receptors depends on the 
frequency of rebinding whereby a dissociated ligand wanders around in the solution for 
some  time  and  reattaches  to  the  binding  surface  upon  contact  This  is  only  implicitly 
included  in  the  above  approaches  A  systematic  mathematical  study  of  the  rebinding 
probability  of  a  single  ligand  was  undertaken  by  Lagerholm  and  Thompson  27  An 
independent self-consistent mean-field model of rebinding of ligands bound to receptors 
in an infinite two-dimensional plane was recently presented by us 28 in the context of 
analyzing Surface Plasmon Resonance SPR experiments  
In  the  present  paper  we  generalize  our  earlier  discrete  model  28  to  incorporate  a 
continuum description for the receptor distribution as well as the ligand motion The self-
consistent  stochastic  mean-field  theory  of  rebinding  thus  developed  is  then  used  as  the 
basis for extending our investigation to include non-uniformity in the spatial distribution 
of receptors In particular we study how rebinding is affected by the presence of receptor 
clusters  on  the  cell  surface  Our  broad  conclusions  from  this  study  are  as  follows  i 
Receptor  clustering  dramatically  reduces  the  effective  dissociation  rate  through 
enhancing rebinding if the overall receptor density is small enough that the effect would 
have been negligible without clustering ii When the overall receptor density is high the 
effect of clustering is smaller but the frequent rebinding events render the dissociation 
non-exponential in the case of a planar surface 
In  the  remainder  of  this  paper  we  first  develop  the  theoretical  formalism  to  study 
rebinding of ligands to an infinite plane of uniformly distributed receptors Motivated by 
recent experimental observations of the effect of lipid rafts on ligand rebinding 6 the 
formalism  is  then  extended  to  include  receptor  clusters  Subsequently  our  theoretical 
predictions  are  compared  to  Monte  Carlo  simulation  data  Finally  we  comment  on 
possible  applications  including  a  possible  internal  diffusion  model  extension  and 
discuss consequences for the analysis of experimental results 
II THEORY 
i REBINDING ON A PLANAR SURFACE 
In this section we present a generalization of our recently introduced lattice random walk 
based theory of rebinding to a continuum distribution of receptors on a two-dimensional 
infinite  surface  Let  us  consider  a  homogeneous  distribution  of  receptors  on  an  infinite 
planar  surface  with  constant  mean  surface  density 
0R   per  unit  area  The  intrinsic 
dissociation and association rates are denoted by 
-k  and  k  respectively We denote by 
 tR  the density of receptors bound to the ligand at any time t and its dynamical equation 
has the form 
       2 
where  t   represents  the  ligand  density  in  the  vicinity  of  the  surface  Let  us  now 
consider a dissociation experiment for which the density of receptors that are bound to 
 and the ligand density in the bulk volume is taken to 
ligands at time 
be  zero  at 
  is  entirely  due  to 
ligands released from bound receptors at previous times 
 Taking this previous 
 t  in the concise 
history carefully into account we may write down an expression for 
following form 
  It  then  follows  that  a  non-zero  t   at  time

dimension of 1length of a random walk returning to its point of origin at time  t  given 
that  the  origin  constitutes  a  partially  absorbing  barrier  with  a  density 
absorbing points per unit area and 
probability density for finding a diffusing particle at distance  r from the origin at time t  
  represents  the  normalized  two-dimensional 
In  order  to  eliminate  the  time  dependence  of  the  boundary  condition  in  i  we  choose 
 be the fraction of receptors bound to ligands at time  t  so 
  When  the  spatial  integration  in 
Eq3 is extended to infinity Eq2 is thus reduced to

We  note  that  the  rebinding  problem  as  defined  by  Eq4  is  effectively  one-dimensional 
ie the two in-plane dimensions have disappeared upon spatial integration This feature 
enables  many  important  simplifications  as  will  be  obvious  from  the  following 
discussions  
The  quantity 
  is  now  calculated  from  the  frequency  of  first  passage  events  Let 
 denote the probability density of ligands that at time  return to the surface for the 
first time following dissociation At this point in time the ligands may be either absorbed 
 could then 
or reflected back to the solution and subsequently return at a later time 
be calculated by summing over of all such events 
In order to proceed with our formalism it is useful to imagine the available space to be 
divided into cubic elements ie coarse-grain the space each with volume  3  Here 
is  a  coarse-grained  length  scale  which  we  assume  to  be  of  the  order  of  the  size  of  a 
single ligand molecule The ligand diffusion may now be viewed effectively as transfer of 
its center of mass between such elements When a ligand occupies an element of volume 
adjacent to the surface it may become bound to a receptor and the probability for this to 
is the probability of non-absorption of the ligand upon 
occur is denoted 
 thus satisfies the integral equation

ligand and the solvent molecule which for simplicity we assume to be a non-fluctuating 
constant which cause the ligand to move away from the surface 6 In order to solve the 
integral  equation  5  we  express  it  in  terms  of  the  Laplace-transformed  variables

Throughout this paper we will define  D  to be the diffusion coefficient of the random 
walk projected onto the z-axis perpendicular to the plane containing receptors Its 
relation to the complete three-dimensional diffusion coefficient 
The Laplace-transformed version of Eq4 after all the above substitutions reads

Let us now seek to extract the time dependence of the fraction 
 from this expression 
Clearly  at  short  times  ie  when  s   is  sufficiently  large  namely 
 and the decay is purely exponential with the intrinsic rate constant

 is the equilibrium dissociation constant Our self-
consistent mean-field analysis thus yields that the ligand dissociation curve for a planar 
surface  is  always  non-exponential  for  sufficiently  late  times  However  for  small 
association  rate  or  surface  coverage  the  initial  transient  regime  showing  exponential 
decay could well last for substantial durations 
The non-exponential decay in Eq11 was also predicted in a previous lattice model of the 
problem developed to model SPR experiments 28 Indeed one can show that with the 
appropriate  mapping  the  time  constants  c  of  the  continuum  and  the  lattice  models 
coincide In the discrete variant the receptors are distributed on a lattice with unit length

ii EXTENSION TO RECEPTOR CLUSTERS 
In  this  section  we  adapt  the  stochastic  self-consistent  mean-field  theory  for  ligand 
rebinding presented above to incorporate non-uniform spatial receptor distributions We 
consider receptors distributed in clusters of radius  0r  such that the density of receptors 
0R  0R  where the latter represents the mean density of receptors on 
inside the clusters is 
the surface  
In order to generalize the previous theory to incorporate receptor clusters we adopt the 
following approximation Any rebinding event where the originating and the final points 
are separated by a distance  r
 is assumed to take place in a local environment with 
receptor density 
 to rebind is 
R0  that we assume to be of the order of 
assumed to sense only a smaller receptor density 
the mean density 0R  In order for this approximation to be useful we need to identify 
with a physical length scale here we simply assume that 
 It must be noted that no 
strict spatial segregation exists between the two classes of rebinding events in the actual 
0R  whereas any ligand that travels a lateral distance

system  However  it  will  be  seen  later  in  comparison  with  numerical  results  that  this 
approximation  is  remarkably  successful  in  predicting  the  different  temporal  decay 
regimes in the presence of receptor clusters 
We shall now quantify these ideas using the previously developed formalism as a basis 
The complete expression describing the dynamics of the bound fraction which obviously 
generalizes Eq4 becomes

 where 
where  according  to  our  earlier  assumptions  the  distance-dependent  coverage  function 
 rR  assumes the step function form 
 x  denotes

the Heaviside step function with the properties 
Let us consider two special cases of interest  
Case 1  Dense isolated clusters on a planar or spherical surface 
This  situation  is  realized  when  the  clusters  are  tightly  packed  with  receptors  but  the 
number of clusters themselves is small so that the mean surface coverage of receptors is 
a negligible fraction In this case the homogeneous part of the rebinding term in Eq12 is 
vanishingly small and the equation reduces to 
 large

It  is  important  to  note  that  Eq13  is  valid  also  for  receptor  clusters  on  a  spherical  cell 
surface  provided  the  size  of  the  cluster  x   is  much  smaller  than  the  radius  of  the  cell 
itself The Laplace transform of

the  concise  notation 
     14 
introduced 
where  we  have 
  and  similarly 
  in  future  calculations  In  order  to  evaluate  the  Laplace  transform  of  the 
function 
for the limiting forms of the function 
 we apply the following trick Using EqB2 in Appendix B 
 we approximate it as  
      15 
    where 
 tC
 again is the Heaviside step function 
We  now  substitute  this  expression  into  Eq14  and  use  it  to  evaluate  the 
-dependent 
term in the brackets The first term gives 
 see Eq9 After inserting the

 ie times much larger 
In particular we are interested in the long-time limit 
than  the  typical  time  scale  for  ligand  diffusion  across  a  cluster  corresponding  to 
  In  this  limit  the  rebinding  term  has  the  form

Let us now assume that the clusters are very densely packed with receptors ie 
sufficiently large  so  that

  In this case  the  contributions  in Eq17a  that involve 
  30  Therefore 
 After substitution in Eq8 we see that 
              
incomplete  Gamma  functions  are  small

0   or  more  precisely
  may  be  understood  as  the 
From  Eq19  the  length  scale 
threshold size a cluster needs to have in order to appreciably affect the dissociation  
We  thus  reach  an  intriguing  conclusion  When  the  mean  surface  density  is  sufficiently 
small  clustering  of  receptors  has  over  sufficiently  long  time  scales  the  effect  of 
reducing  the  effective  dissociation  rate  of  ligands  by  a  factor  that  is  inversely 
proportional to the size of the cluster It should also be borne in mind that the very late 
time regime for any small but non-zero mean density should display the non-exponential 
behavior of Eq11b However the characteristic time scale for entry into this regime for 
  is  sufficiently  large  
  there  is  also  another  intermediate 
-R  and is likely to be masked by other effects eg 
a uniform distribution grows as 
finite-size effects non-specific binding in experiments 
In  order  to  view  this  result  in  the  context  of  the  previous  findings  of  Berg  and  Purcell 
18 and Shoup and Szabo 19 we may compare Eq19 with the analogous result in Eq1 
obtained via very different arguments Let us imagine that the density of receptors inside 
a  cluster  is  so  high  consistent  with  our  own  assumptions  in  reaching  Eq19  that  the 
cluster effectively acts like an absorbing disk for which the diffusion-limited onward rate 
constant is 
 31 where  r  is the radius of the cluster Let  N  be the number of 
receptors  inside  a  cluster  which  we  assume  to  be  so  large  that 
  in  the 
denominator  of  Eq1  After  re-expressing  N   in  terms  of  the  receptor  surface  density 
  we  find  that  within  this  approximation  the  reduction  factor  for  the 
association  rate  in  Eq1  is  identical  to  that  in  Eq19  with 
  an  aesthetically 
pleasing  result  It  should  however  be  emphasized  that  the  framework  of  our  theory  is 
more general and provides a broader perspective 
When  the  radius 
time regime 
 for which the last term in Eq16 is small and the 
first term dominates since again the incomplete Gamma functions vanish in the limit of 
  specified  above  In  this  regime  we  hence  recover  the  non-exponential 
dissociation  encountered  earlier  in  the  section  Rebinding  on  a  planar  surface  in  the 
context of a homogeneous receptor distribution see Eq11b 
        20  
In this intermediate time regime the ligand behaves as if diffusing in the presence of an 
infinite substrate with receptor density 
The preceding calculations in particular Eq17-19 show that the clusters have to be of a 
  if  they  are  to  produce  a  significant  effect  on  the 
minimum  size  
dissociation  It  is  therefore  important  to  know  how  this  cut-off  size  compares  with 
independent estimates for the size of lipid rafts  The total number of proteins likely to 
be contained inside a raft of area 
2100nm has been estimated to be in the range 55-65 
32  assuming  very  close  packing  or  close  to  20  33  assuming  the  same  density  of 
packing inside the raft and the surrounding membrane The number of specific proteins 
like  HSPG  is  possibly  less  As  a  conservative  estimate  we  assume  that  there  are 
 where r is the raft radius The 
condition  that  clusters  affect  dissociation  substantially  is 
  from  our  previous 
analysis Let us now make the identification 
 which combined with the previous 
estimate for the receptor density gives the condition 
nm  as  a  rough  estimate  for  the  size  of  a  lipid  raft  34  which  then  gives 
 if we assume a diffusion coefficient 
HSPG inside a raft which gives
 Let us use 
     when  
0R   
Our conclusion therefore is that rafts of extensions in the range 25-50 nm should be 
capable of producing a measurable effect on ligand dissociation purely by a diffusion-
controlled  mechanism  provided  the  association  rate  of  the  specific  protein  is  large 
enough  It  must  however  be  remarked  that  this  conclusion  strictly  applies  to 
monovalent  ligands  interacting  with  a  monovalent  single  receptor  only  If  as  in  the 
specific case of FGF-2 there is more than one receptor that can bind the ligand and the 
possibility of higher order complexes exists then the inclusion of surface biochemical 
coupling  reactions  needs  to  be  taken  into  account  In  the  section  Comparison  with 
experiments we provide a more detailed discussion of these aspects in the context of 
experiments with HSPG 
Case 2  High mean surface density perturbation theory for small rafts 
When the mean surface density of receptors is high one might expect that rebinding has 
significant effect on dissociation even without any additional clustering mechanisms and 
that any effect of rafts on dissociation would be confined to sufficiently small time scales 
This argument is in fact supported by numerical simulations that we present below Yet 
here we aim to quantify the effect of clustering on ligand rebinding in the case of high 
mean surface density For this purpose Eq12 is conveniently rewritten in the form

 The second term inside the brackets is the homogeneous rebinding term 
whereas the third term is the correction term arising from clustering We observe that for 
any fixed 
 the latter term gets progressively smaller at sufficiently large times which 
implies that the late time behavior must be dominated by the homogeneous term In order 
to make further analytic progress let us now focus on the regime of small clusters with

where  the  last  term  is  the  correction  due  to  the  presence  of  clusters  Note  that  the

larger times This equation is also solved using the Laplace transform technique and the

After substituting in Eq8 we obtain  for

cluster-correction  term  that  is  determined  by  inverting  the  second  term  in  Eq25  The 
complete expression is 
where  the  constant  c  was  defined  following  Eq11  Eq26  provides  the  first  correction 
term  in  the  bound  fraction  for  small  clusters  As  will  be  seen  in  the  next  section  this 
expression reproduces the cluster correction term in simulations approximately but only 
at early times which is consistent with our own assumption that t should be sufficiently 
small 
To  summarize  this  section  the  theoretical  formalism  we  have  presented  predicts  a 
number of interesting regimes for the effective dissociation of ligand from receptors on 
cell  surfaces  For  a  uniformly  distributed  set  of  receptors  on  a  plane  we  find  that  the 
decay is exponential with the intrinsic dissociation rate initially Eq11a but crosses over 
to  a  non-exponential  decay  at  later  times  Eq11b  owing  to  multiple  rebinding  events 
When the receptors are clustered the effects of rebinding depend on the mean receptor 
density  When  the  mean  density  is  low  so  that  no  appreciable  rebinding  occurs  with  a 
uniform  distribution  clustering  is  predicted  to  have  the  effect  of  producing  an 
exponential  decay  at  intermediate  times  with  a  reduced  decay  coefficient  that  is  a 
function of the cluster size and the other parameters Eq19 The very late time behavior 
is still presumably non-exponential although a full characterization of this crossover has 
not  yet  been  performed  When  the  mean  density  is  sufficiently  high  the  effect  of 
clustering was found to be non-monotonic small at early and late times and reaching a 
maximum at a certain intermediate time 
In order to check our analytical results in particular Eqs19 and 26 we have performed 
lattice Monte Carlo simulations which will be the subject of the next section

III  RESULTS 
i LATTICE MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS 
The hopping between elements picture of ligand diffusion we presented in the section 
Rebinding  on  a  planar  surface  is  easily  implemented  in  numerical  simulations  The 
substrate surface is envisioned as a two-dimensional square lattice with the length scale 
 the time scale of 
hopping between elements We use a different symbol here to distinguish from the more 
introduced  in  the  section  Rebinding  on  a  planar  surface 
fundamental  time  scale 
Using these units all quantities we discussed above may be expressed in dimensionless 
form see Table 2 The ligand motion is modeled as a three-dimensional random walk 
between elements in the space above the substrate 
In the simulations we choose the association rate to be 
 With this choice the 
 and the probability of 
binding rate of the ligand close to a receptor is 
binding  over  a  single  Monte  Carlo  time  step  for  a  ligand  close  to  the  surface  is 
  ie  the  binding  is  purely  diffusion-limited  In  real  units  this  choice 
 A smaller value of  k  
corresponds to an association rate of 
involves  only  a  trivial  modification  of  the  algorithm  The  probability  of  binding  is 
reduced  to 
  in  simulations  this  factor  may  be  simply  absorbed  into  the 
dimensionless surface coverage while keeping the binding purely diffusion-limited but 
a  larger  association  rate  would  require  a  more  microscopic  simulation  and  is  not 
addressed in this paper 
We next discuss our choice for the dissociation rate A realistic value of 
the range of 
very small number For 
 we estimate 
order of 
be  at  least  of  the  order  of 
Monte Carlo steps For computational efficiency therefore we choose

The surface density of receptors

dimensionless  version  is  denoted  by 
receptor extracellular binding domains are not significantly different in size the range of 
allowed  values  for  this  parameter  is

Our  strategy  is  as  follows  Keeping  the  overall  density 
 Because of lattice constraints 
receptors into N clusters of dimensionless radius 
it is not possible to ensure that all the receptors are contained in such clusters Rather our 
criterion is that for a certain value of   0r  N be selected such that the number of receptors 
outside  clusters  is  kept  a  minimum  The  simulations  are  done  with  reasonably  large 
lattices  
  so  that  small  surface  coverage  could  be  explored  Fig2  shows  two 
typical receptor configurations used in our simulations All the data was averaged over 
100 different initial realizations of the receptor configuration 
The ligand diffusion is governed by periodic boundary conditions on the four borders of 
the lattice so that a ligand that exits at one boundary reenters from the opposite side The 
direction perpendicular to the plane of the lattice shall be referred to as the z-axis and the 
surface  itself  is  located  at  z0  The  ligand  diffusion  in  the  z-direction  is  not  upper 
bounded We also neglect surface diffusion of the receptor proteins irrespective of their 
being  clustered  or  isolated  and  treat  them  as  static  objects  throughout  this  paper  see 
however the discussion at the end of this section At the beginning of the dynamics a 
fraction 
  of  all  the  receptor  sites  are  bound  to  a  single  ligand  each  Although  the 
precise value of p0 is unlikely to have a large impact on the late-time decay we chose 
p0025 in all the simulations so that we are not too far from the approximation p0  
1 made in the set-up of the theory 
There are three main dynamical processes in the simulation i Dissociation of a ligand 
t   This 
from  a  bound  receptor  takes  place  with  probability 
move updates the position of the ligand from z0 to z2 in units of the lattice spacing 
We  use  z2  instead  of  z1  in  order  to  prevent  immediate  rebinding  to  the  same 
receptor  ii  Diffusion  of  the  released  ligands  in  solution  A  free  ligand  moves  a 
distance equal to one lattice spacing in one of the six directions with probability 16 per 
time  step  iii  Re-adsorption  of  free  ligands  to  free  receptors  A  free  ligand  at  z1  is 
absorbed by a free receptor below it if there is one with probability 1  
Our  initial  simulations  were  done  at  two  values  of  the  surface  coverage  
 and we find that the surface density has a dramatic impact on the dissociation 
 corresponds to very sparsely distributed receptors 
rate Fig3 The first case 
 As shown the decay 
whereas the distribution is quite dense in the second case 
at the low density appears exponential and has a measured decay constant of 
approximately  reflective  of  the  true  dissociation  rate  
    For  the  more  dense 
system a distinctly non-exponential decay is evident  However a closer look shows that 
at  early  times  t    200  Monte  Carlo  steps  an  exponential  decay  for  the  high  coverage 
case  also  in  accordance  with  Eq11a  Fig3  -  inset  can  be  found  The  decay  constant 
measured in the simulations by fitting this early part t  400 Monte Carlo steps from Eq 
11a to an exponential curve is close but somewhat lower than the intrinsic rate used for 
 which we believe is simply an artifact of the discrete algorithm 
the simulations 
used in the simulations In Appendix C we show that the effective decay constant in the 
  per  time  step 
310  or 
case of even a single isolated receptor and a ligand in a three-dimensional cubic lattice 
such as used in our simulations is less than the intrinsic rate on account of the non-zero 
return  probability  of  the  lattice  random  walk  The  non-exponential  curve  for  the  high-
density  case  fits  well  with  the  theoretical  prediction  in  Eq11b  which  has  also  been 
supported by dissociation data from surface plasmon resonance experiments in a recent 
study 27  Note that in both the low and high mean density cases the simulations were 
set up so that the clusters were completely full of receptors ie with the highest density 
possible in those regions  Also as noted above the low mean surface density could also 
correspond to the case where the association rate is low 
We  next  addressed  how  clusters  might  impact  dissociation  focusing  first  on  the  low-
 in terms of distribution over the 
coverage regime The coverage we chose was 
410  receptors per cell for an 
cellular surface this would roughly correspond to  
 respectively and we compared a 
association rate of   
homogeneous  receptor  distribution  with  a  single  cluster  with  
  and  multiple 
clusters 
 Fig4 We chose the clusters to be distributed randomly on the surface 
but  simulations  with  smaller  lattices  have  shown  that  the  dissociation  curve  is  not 
significantly  different  for  a  regular  periodic  arrangement  of  clusters  also  In  the  real 
system  these  clusters  would  have  radii  of  approximately  25-90  nm  respectively 
Simulations  were  carried  out  with  two  levels  of  receptor  density  inside  clusters  in  the 
 and in the second 
first case rafts were occupied by receptors to saturation 
10R
case  the  packing  density  was  lowered  to  01
  Clear  differences  despite 
each system having the same actual density of receptors and surface coverage are evident 
when  clustering  is  present  In  both  the  cases  there  is  clear  evidence  of  a  significant 
intermediate exponential regime Figs 4A and 4B which subsequently crosses over to a 
slower decay at later times However the effect of clustering on the dissociation rate is 
much more noticeable in the first case where the packing density of receptors is high Fig 
4C  Moreover  we  see  that  for  the  high  packing  density  case  the  dependence  of  the 
effective rate defined in the figure legend on the cluster size observes the inverse linear 
relationship predicted by the theoretical analysis Eq19 Fig 4D 
The  numerical  results  for  the  effective  dissociation  rates  for  the  two  cases  discussed 
above may be put together in a single plot by expressing the effective dissociation rate as 
a function of the ratio 
 raft radius the threshold 
0R  Eq17b In 
radius  0  is different for the two cases due to the inverse relationship to 
  it  is 
fact  by  substituting  the  numerical  values  of  the  simulation  parameters  
easily seen that 
We  may  also  use  the  equivalence  with  the  Shoup-Szabo  result  Eq1  to  express 
 from the previous discussion In Fig 5 we plot 
terms of the cluster radius  0
the  ratio  of  the  effective  dissociation  rate  defined  as  the  exponential  fit  to  the  initial 
straight portion of the data t  10 to the intrinsic rate 
 after correcting for the 
lattice effects which shows that this ratio is a smooth monotonically decreasing function

 is given 
by Eq17b and is plotted as the smooth line in Fig5 It is clear that the data points agree 
very  well  with  our  theoretical  prediction  in  the  regime 
  which  is  also  the 
regime where clustering  significantly alters the dissociation 
Fig6  shows  the  effect  of  clustering  in  the  high  mean  density  case  with 
receptors per cell and cluster radii of 
 A noticeable upward shift 
decreased dissociationincreased binding retention in the dissociation curve is observed 
but  the  effect  is  non-monotonic  and  vanishes  for  small  and  large  times  in  both  cases  
This is illustrated more clearly in Fig7 where we plot the difference between the bound 
fractions  for  clustered  versus  homogeneous  receptor  distributions  as  a  function  of  time 
for  the  two  values  of  the  cluster  radii    For  the  parameters  used  in  the  simulations 
respectively  the 
parameter 
therefore  we  also  compared  the  simulation  results  with  the  approximate  theoretical 
prediction in Eq26 smooth line in Fig7 expected to be valid in the early-time regime  
We observe that although the theoretical expression approximates the observed difference 
rather  well  at  early  times  for  small  cluster  size  it  fails  to  capture  the  non-monotonous 
behavior  at somewhat  late  times    It  is  likely that  this  dense  mean  receptor  regime  lies 
outside  the  applicability  range  of  the  expression  in  Eq26  Clearly  a  more  systematic 
method to study the crossover from small to large receptor density would be desirable 
but eludes us at this stage 
We now present a theoretical argument which suggests that over sufficiently long time 
scales receptor clustering should have no effect on ligand dissociation as found for the 
high  density  receptor  case  Let  us  consider  two  different  scenarios  i  a  homogeneous 
0R   and  ii  a  clustered  configuration  where 
receptor  distribution  with  a  mean  density 
the  clusters  have  mean  area  density 
  where  n   is  the  average  number  of 
receptors per cluster The first case was already studied in Sec2 where we showed that 
 the threshold cluster size is 
the dissociation is characterized by a single time scale

  Let us now map

case ii into case i and imagine the clusters as effectively single receptors with mean 
k  respectively The 
density 
effective  rates  may  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  intrinsic  rates  using  the  Berg-Purcell-
Shoup-Szabo relations which give

primed  quantities  and  the  cluster  density  we  see  that 
  ie  the  clusters  have  no 
effect on the decay at all  This analysis however is not exact and numerical simulations

did show a significant effect of clustering in the strong rebinding case particularly at early 
times insert Figure 6 Thus for the simple one-to-one ligand-receptor binding case it is 
conceivable  that  the  effects  of  clustering  are  only  transient  but  could  still  have  a 
significant impact over a biologically relevant time scale  
ii COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS 
Having compared the theoretical formulation in sufficient detail with lattice simulations 
we  turn  to  the  question  How  do  the  predictions  of  our  simple  model  fit  with 
experimental  observations  We  focus  on  the  results  of  FGF-2  dissociation  from  HSPG 
obtained by Chu et al 6 shown in Fig 1 FGF-2 binds to a high-affinity receptor FGFR 
as well as the HSPG we discuss here and higher order clusters including both FGFR and 
HSPG are possible 12 Therefore any quantitative analysis of FGF-2 binding has to be 
done  with  care  because  of  the  presence  of  competing  interactions  In  spite  of  this  and 
because of a lack of availability of experimental dissociation data with other raft proteins 
we choose this system for our analysis 
The  experiments  reported  in  6  were  done  with  intact  cells  either  in  the  absence  or 
presence of the lipid raft-disrupting agents Mb CD and filipin filipin data is not shown in 
Fig 1  Both lipid raft-disrupting agents were demonstrated to have a significant effect on 
the  dissociation  rate  but  we  focus  here  on  the  Mb CD  data  set  since  the  mechanism  of 
action  is  simpler  and  more  straightforward    Briefly  a 
minError Objects cannot be created from editing field codes  was  obtained  for  the 
control  cells  whereas  treatment  with  Mb CD  increased  the  dissociation  rate  to 
approximately  0023  minError  Objects  cannot  be  created  from  editing  field 
codeswith simple exponential fitting If the Mb CD treatment resulted in a completely 
homogeneous HSPG distribution we arrive at a ratio of  575 for the reduction in the 
dissociation rate due to raft-associated clustering 
The first question then is whether the present estimates of the HSPG surface density in 
these cells would allow for a significant exponential regime for the temporal decay of the 
dissociation  curve  Using  Eq11b  we  may  compute  the  length  of  this  time  interval  et  
estimates 
  is  a 
rough estimate for the cell radius After substitution in the expression in Eq11a these 
values  give 
  This  time  scale  is  very  small  for  typical  dissociation 
measurements and suggests that the observed mode of decay in Fig 1 is more likely to be 
the  non-exponential  function  predicted  in  Eq  11b  More  evidence  for  the  presence  of 
strong rebinding in the experiments shown in Fig 1 is seen when rebinding was prevented 
by the addition of heparin Fig 1 which act as solution receptors for the released FGF-2  
The dissociation in the presence of heparin was found to be increased compared to both 
untreated  and  Mb CD  treated  and  essentially  the  same  with  and  without  lipid  raft 
disruptors  Fig  1  Further  although  limited  the  data  points  suggest  that  dissociation 
could  be  exponential    To  summarize  the  difference  between  Mb CD  treated  and 
exponential  Let  us  use 
following 
  where 
the  decay 
-k   value  of 
 where  
 is the typical cellular dimension and 
untreated without heparin indicates an effect on dissociation by clustering and the heparin 
data suggests that rebinding is still an issue even in the absence of rafts   
It is important to note that because of the slow non-exponential decay of the dissociation 
curve in the presence of strong rebinding this function cannot be accurately characterized 
by a single rate valid over a well-defined time regime unlike the weak-rebinding case 
Rather  the  effective  rates  obtained  by  fitting  the  experimental  curves  to  exponential 
functions  are  only  a  simplified  characterization  of  the  decay  valid  over  a  limited  time 
scale  Keeping these caveats in mind we tried to see whether the observed experimental 
data  with  and  without  raft  disrupters  is  reproduced  by  the  theoretical  functions  of 
Eq11b  homogeneous  distribution  and  Eq26  raft-correction  The  curves  that  were 
judged to be closest to the experimental data in Fig 1 by comparing with the exponential 
fit  functions  used  to  estimate  the  dissociation  rates  in  Fig  1  are  shown  in  Fig  8  The 
 Eq11b and Eq26 were tuned for the best fit and the optimal 
parameters  c  and 
numerical  values  found  were 
  Let  us  now 
 obtained from the 
substitute for the following parameters
heparin  data  in  Fig  1 
11  We  treat  the  surface  densities 
unknowns where  N  is the total number of HSPG per cell and 
 is roughly the radius of 
a raft Upon solving for the unknowns  N  and 
Both values are within reasonable limits of the known estimates of these parameters and 
the  resemblance  between  Fig  8  and  Fig  1  supports  the  FGF2-HSPG  system  analysis 
under the strong rebinding category discussed in Sec 2 case 2 The implications of this 
observation are i the effective dissociation rate measured in experiments with such high 
coverage receptors such as HSPG is best treated as a phenomenological parameter valid 
for a limited time range ii  the theory can be used with the experimental observations in 
order to determine the true dissociation rate and iii the signaling events where rafts are 
expected  to  play  a  role  may  be  expected  to  occur  over  time  scales  where  the  transient 
effects of clustering are still relevant   
Suppose  however  as  an  aside  that  Sec  2  case  1  low  surface  coverage  would  have 
applied to this experimental system  From Fig 5 we note that a reduction in the effective 
dissociation  rate  by  a  factor  575  or  a  ratio  of  017  for  a  low  density  system  would 
 should be around 287 Let us now use Eq17b to express this 
require that the ratio 
result  in  terms  of  the  raft  radius  r   by  means  of  the  substitutions 
 is a rough estimate of the number of HSPG per raft The 
  the  association  rate  for 
condition  that 
FGF2-HSPG  should  be  nearly 
respectively we allow some flexibility in D because by definition D is actually 13 of 
the real three-dimensional diffusion coefficient This value is an order of magnitude or 
for  HSPG 
10  However  it  must  be  noted  that  although  the  above 
 where 
  now  demands  that  for 
larger 
experimental 
available 
 we find 
number 
theoretical  estimate  is  somewhat  high  for  FGF-2-HSPG  it  is  still  within  the  range  of 
association  rates  typically  reported  in  the  literature  We  believe  that  therefore  there 
could  well  be  other  low-density  raft  proteins  that  could  use  the  enhanced-rebinding 
mechanism  in  order  to  retain  ligands  longer  near  the  surface  and  for  which  our  theory 
could be useful 
Let us now address the following question Is there likely to be a long-term effect of rafts 
on  ligand  dissociation  for  FGF-2-HSPG  based  on  the  analysis  of  the  system  The 
numerical  simulations  coupled  with  the  theoretical  argument  presented  in  the  previous 
section showed that the effect of clustering for our model system was present only in a 
limited time range and vanished at late times  Experiments however did not support this 
for the FGF-2-HSPG-lipid raft system  This system however is much more complex than 
the model system our theoretical and numerical analysis were based on primarily due to 
the multiplicity of receptors ie FGF receptors and HSPG competing for FGF-2 binding 
as  well  as  forming  higher  order  complexes    That  being  said  our  systematic  study  of 
diffusion-controlled  rebinding  in  the  presence  of  receptor  clusters  indicates  the 
limitations  of  this  mechanism  the  surface  coverage  or  the  association  rate  of  the 
receptors have to be sufficiently large in order to have a measurable impact of clustering  
It is therefore worthwhile to explore alternative mechanisms that might be employed by 
the cell to increase ligand retention inside rafts In the last part of this section we will 
discuss one such plausible mechanism whereby the ligands may be retained longer inside 
a  cluster  ie  internal  diffusion  of  ligands  inside  a  cluster  of  receptors  We  emphasize 
that the model is a theoretical idea and not strictly based on experimental observations  
iii INTERNAL DIFFUSION MODEL 
An alternative model for ligand dissociation in the presence of clusters is now proposed 
by invoking a co-operative rebinding  mechanism for ligand retention inside a cluster 
For  example  FGF-2  and  other  heparin-binding  growth  factors  bind  HSPG  through  the 
glycosaminoglycan GAG side-chains In this model we would propose that there might 
be  overlap  of  the  GAG  chains  on  neighboring  HSPG  clustered  in  rafts  resulting  in  a 
preferential  path  whereby  a  ligand  following  its  release  from  one  GAG  binding  site 
might find it energetically more favorable to bind to a neighboring binding site belonging 
to  another  HSPG  The  ligand  would  therefore  perform  a  surface  diffusion  inside  the 
cluster and likely be released into the solution only upon reaching the edge of the cluster 
Clearly this internal diffusion would significantly reduce the effective dissociation rate 
of the ligand as we show now more quantitatively 
For  simplicity  let  us  imagine  the  binding  site  inside  a  raft  as  occupying  the  sites  of  a 
lattice with spacing  d  which is the typical separation between two molecules A cluster 
of radius  r  has 
 molecules inside it Let us now assume that the hopping of 
  Then  the 
the  ligand  from  one  site  to  another takes  place over  a  mean  time  interval 
diffusion  coefficient  for  the  surface  diffusion  of  the  ligand  inside  the  cluster  is 
 The total time it takes the ligand to reach the edge of the cluster by internal 
diffusion is therefore 
    28  
    27 
The  ligand  is  likely  to  fully  dissociate  from  the  cluster  once  it  reaches  the  edge  since 
there is less likelihood of finding a neighboring site to bind to Thus the mean effective 
dissociation rate is given by 
where we have also defined the internal hopping rate 
  it  appears  reasonable to 
Although  it is  difficult to  have  an  independent estimate  for 
assume that this is of the same order as the intrinsic dissociation rate 
-k  for individual 
receptors In this case if the number of HSPG per cluster is  n  then the dissociation rate 
is roughly reduced by a factor of 
 which could then account for the experimentally 
observed ratio of 16  
In Fig9A we show some numerical simulation results done with this internal diffusion 
  The 
model  These  simulations  were  done  with  a  mean  surface  coverage  of 
main  figure  shows  the  comparison  between  the  dissociation  curves  obtained  with  the 
 whereas the 
rebinding model and the internal diffusion model for cluster radius 
inset  shows  the  same  for 
  The  figures  show  a  much  more  dramatic  effect  of 
clustering  on  dissociation  as  compared  to  the  purely  diffusion-limited  rebinding  model 
  the  rebinding 
which  has  been  the  main  subject  of  this  paper  For  instance  for 
model  results  in  a  reduction  in  the  effective  dissociation  rate  by  a  factor  of    021 
whereas in the internal diffusion model the corresponding number is  00019 ie lower 
by two orders of magnitude Similar trends were seen for other values of the cluster radii 
also Fig 9B shows the effective dissociation rate found by fitting the data in Fig8A to 
exponential curves in the model plotted as a function of the number of proteins n inside 
a cluster In accordance with our arguments we see a sharp drop of the decay rate with 
n  but  the  curve  is  non-linear  and  does  not  fit  completely  with  the  simple  1n 
dependence  predicted  in  Eq28  Nevertheless  it  is  obvious  that  such  co-operative 
mechanisms  could  greatly  augment  the  effect  of  receptor  clustering  and  we  speculate 
that  lipid rafts  possibly use  a  combination  of  both  enhanced  rebinding as  well  as  more 
specific ligand retention mechanisms to slow down the dissociation 
Although  there  is  no  direct  experimental  evidence  for  any  effective  confinement  of 
FGF-2 within the HSPG clusters it is possible that such additional mechanisms could be 
present  in  this  or  other  systems  to  enhance  the  purely  diffusion-controlled  rebinding 
described earlier Models of surface diffusion of ligands on receptor clusters have been 
discussed in the literature in other contexts as well eg molecular brachiation of CheR 
molecules on a cluster of its receptor proteins 35  A later model of ligand association to 
a  cell  surface  containing  receptor  clusters  incorporating  such  an  internal  diffusion 
mechanism  26  had  been  found  to  explain  experimental data  35  better  than  previous 
models 18 19 that did not explicitly contain such mechanisms  
Finally what could be the possible advantage of the internal diffusion mechanism over 
simple enhanced rebinding due to clustering We believe that it is primarily the effect on 
time scales The increased rebinding due to clustering leads to a significant effect on the 
effective  dissociation  rate  but  only  over  certain  limited  time  scales  as  we  showed  in 
detail  in  the  preceding  section  By  contrast  the  internal  diffusiontrapping  mechanism 
could cause a permanent reduction in the dissociation rate as long as clusters are present 
The limitation of course is that the receptors have to be packed rather tightly inside a 
raft for this mechanism to take effect  
 IV  DISCUSSION 
It is generally understood that lipid rafts are capable of confining several kinds of large 
proteins  inside  them  for  time  scales  up  to  several  minutes  2  HSPG  are  among  the 
proteins  shown  to  localize  to  lipid  rafts  and  they  are  also  co-receptors  for  heparin-
binding growth factors such as FGF-2  We therefore sought to determine theoretically 
whether the confinement and clustering of HSPG inside lipid rafts could affect binding of 
FGF-2  either  via  promoting  rebinding  of  dissociated  ligands  andor  via  reduced 
dissociation through some co-operative interactions between HSPG in close proximity to 
each other Work by Chu et al 2004 indicated that lipid rafts play a significant role in 
controlling the dissociation of FGF-2 from HSPG but the mechanism behind this effect 
is speculative 6 
In  this  paper  we  present  a  rigorous  mathematical  formalism  to  study  the  rebinding  of 
ligands to receptors on an infinite plane as an approximation of the surface of a tissue 
culture plated cell In contrast to work by Lagerholm and Thompson 27 who employed 
partial differential equations to describe the time evolution of the space-averaged ligand 
density we have adopted a stochastic formalism and described the dynamics in terms of 
the  return-to-the-origin  characteristics  of  the  Brownian  trajectories  of  the  ligands 
However  the  theory  is  constructed  entirely  in  terms  of  coarse-grained  continuum 
variables  which  constitutes  an  improvement  over  our  previous  model  28  which  was 
based on a lattice random walk We predict that the long-time decay of the bound fraction 
always assumes a non-exponential form for the planar surface studied here irrespective 
of any parameter values However the entry into this regime depends on the association 
rate  and  the  surface  density  of  receptors  The  theory  also  recovers  the  existence  of  an 
exponential  regime  at  early  times  We  have  checked  and  confirmed  these  analytical 
results through numerical simulations 
The principal aim of this paper was to utilize this formalism to study the effect of large-
scale receptor clustering on the cell surface as appears to occur for example inside lipid 
rafts  We  have  quantified  the  reduction  in  the  effective  dissociation  rate  due  to  such 
clustering in  various  cases  of  interest  In  the  regime  of  low  mean  receptor  density  our 
predictions  agree  with  earlier  results  obtained  by  means  of  different  arguments  19 
Monte Carlo simulations provide excellent support for our model A direct comparison 
with experimental results for the high mean receptor density case was also done noting 
that there is a lack of experimental data currently available in the literature for systems 
which might better be described by our theoretical model ie small monovalent ligand 
interacting  with  a  single  transmembrane  receptor  which  does  not  dimerized  or  form 
higher  order  complexes  With  further  refinements  our  theory  could  provide  an 
independent  method  to  check  for  spatial  non-uniformity  in  receptor  distribution  on  the 
cellular surface This is intimately related to the much larger question of cell membrane 
organization a subject of much debate and discussion in recent times 3 37 38 Even 
so as a first attempt to explicitly study the impact of enhanced rebinding due to large-
scale  assembly  of  receptors  on  the  dissociation  rate  of  ligands  we  believe  that  our 
findings are of value to both experimentalists and modelers interested in lipid rafts and 
their role in cell signaling  
Our theoretical formalism was developed for the case of a planar substrate and most of 
our results are specific to this geometry with the exception of the section Extension to 
receptor  clusters  Case  1  which  also  applies  to  other  geometries  eg  spherical  cells 
provided  the  mean  surface  density  of  receptors  is  small  Apart  from  the  obvious 
suitability  of  this  geometry  to  many  experimental  situations  the  calculations  could  be 
effectively reduced to one dimension which greatly simplified the analysis It would be 
interesting albeit challenging on account of the angular dependence of the probabilities 
to extend the theory presented in this paper to the case of receptors on a spherical cell 
surface  Numerical  studies  in  this  direction  are  currently  being  carried  out  A  better 
characterization of the different crossover regimes in the present theory is also desirable  
We have assumed that receptors are stationary and do not exit clustered zones  How 
stable  is  the  association  of  a  protein  to  the  raft    Single-particle  tracking  experiments 
have shown that the diffusion of a raft-associated protein is unchanged over times scales 
of up to 10 min indicating that the proteins can remain with the raft during this period 
32 However since the dissociation measurements typically extend considerably longer 
on  the  order  of  hours  the  possibility  of  the  proteoglycans  exiting  the  raft  during  this 
period  cannot  be  ruled  out  It  would  be  interesting  to  see  in  a  future  study  if  such 
dissociation  events  could  have  any  impact  on  the  rebinding  process  by  rendering  the 
surface coverage factor time-dependent inside rafts Other relevant issues that would be 
worthwhile  investigating  in  this  context  include  the  effects  of  raft  diffusion  and  their 
stability  It  is  also  straightforward  to  pose  questions  about  noise  within  our  formalism 
For example characterization of fluctuations of receptor occupancy including temporal 
correlations would be relatively easy to address in our model being based on individual 
ligand histories and could provide insight into the much broader question of how well 
does the cell sense its environment 
In conclusion we have presented a novel theoretical framework to study the problem of 
ligand rebinding to receptors on the cellular surface and how the rebinding and effective 
dissociation  of  ligands  are  regulated  by  the  spatial  organization  of  receptor  proteins 
Although many specific results in this paper are restricted to ligand binding to a planar 
surface  the  framework  itself  is  more  general  and  could  be  generalized  to  other  cases 
eg isolated spherical cells which are more suitable for some situations eg the immune 
system

Appendix A 
In  this  appendix  we  briefly  outline  the  calculation  of  the  probability  density  of  first 
returns  to  the  origin  As  is  conventional  we  consider  a  one-dimensional  random  walk 
 tQ  be the probability density at the origin at 
starting from the origin at time 
time  t  and let furthermore 
 denote the density of walkers that return to the origin for 
the first time at time  t  
As  in  the  section  Rebinding  on  a  planar  surface  we  compartmentalize  the  available 
3   and  approximate  the  continuum  diffusion  as  hopping 
space  into  cells  of  volume 
between adjacent cells Then the first passage probability itself is simply 
 and the 
two probability densities are therefore related in the following way 
cid7
    A1 
  factors  are  written  explicitly  for  the  sake  of  clarity  The  difference  of  2  in  the 
measure of length arises because the first passage events by definition cannot cross the 
origin  
In terms of Laplace transforms in the limit 
 the relation becomes 
    A2 
 and it follows that  
      
                A3 
Given that

Clearly  two  distinct  time  regimes  may  be  identified  here  When 
  is  small 
absorption by the surface becomes rare and the first term dominates in the expression at 
 is the same as for a 
sufficiently small times In this case the probability density 
perfectly  reflecting  surface  39  In  the  converse  limit  absorption  is  dominant  and  the 
temporal behavior exhibits the 
 dependence characteristic of the probability density 
for a perfectly absorbing surface 39 
Appendix C 
In this appendix we estimate the effect of rebinding on ligand dissociation from a single 
isolated receptor in an infinite cubic lattice The ligand dissociates from the receptor with 
  and  performs  a  random  walk  on  the  lattice  until  the  walk  hits  the 
probability 
stationary receptor again and binds to it We are interested in estimating the probability 
 that the ligand is bound to the receptor after  N time steps One time step is the 
time required for the ligand to move one lattice spacing 
The general equation for 
    C1 
      
cid21
  is  the  probability  of  return  to  origin  of  a  three-dimensional  random  walk 
Polya walk after  k time steps  
Let  us  now  make  the  reasonable  assumption  that  the  function 
decreasing with  N  in which case 
cid21
 in EqC1 This means that  
  is  monotonically 
    C2 
We  next  consider  the  limit  of  large  N   in  which  case  the  sum  in  EqC2  becomes  the 
probability  that  the  random  walk  will  ever  return  to  the  origin  which  is  nearly  03403 
39 In this limit we may also treat  N  as a continuous variable and make use of the 
approximate replacement 
which means that  
If the late-time behavior is characterized by an effective exponent
this exponent is bounded by the relation 
    C4  
eff  EqC4 shows that

indicates  that  the  limit  of  applicability  of  the  perturbation  theory  has  been  reached  and  that 
higher order terms in the perturbation series have to be taken into account 
  in  Eq11b  and
