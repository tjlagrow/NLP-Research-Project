Abstract
Afnity maturation of antibodies during immune responses is achieved by
multiple rounds of somatic hypermutation and subsequent preferential se-
lection of those B cells that express B cell receptors with improved binding
characteristics for the antigen The mechanism underlying B cell selection has
not yet been dened By employing an agent-based model we show that for
physiologically reasonable parameter values afnity maturation can neither
be driven by competition for binding sites nor antigen  even in the pres-
ence of competing secreted antibodies Within the tested mechanisms only
clonal competition for T cell help or a refractory time for the interaction of
centrocytes with follicular dendritic cells are found to enable afnity matura-
tion while generating the experimentally observed germinal center character-
istics and tolerating large variations in the initial antigen density
1 Introduction
During the course of an immune response antibodies evolve that bind with increased afnity to
an antigen Jerne 1951 Eisen  Siskind 1964 This phenomenon termed afnity maturation
is based on multiple rounds of somatic hypermutation targeted to the antibody genes and sub-
sequent selection for increased binding afnity MacLennan et al 2000 Both the latter pro-
cesses are in general conned to germinal centres GCs Jacob et al 1991b Selection acts on
B cells which express as B cell receptor the rearranged and possibly mutated antibody gene
Recent experiments suggest that B cells are selected in a clonal competition since low afn-
ity B cells can persist in the GC reaction when competition is reduced Dal Porto et al 2002
Shih et al 2002 Although the key cellular dynamics of the GC reaction are by now well-
characterized Liu et al 1991 Hollowood  Macartney 1992 MacLennan 1994 the mecha-
nism enabling clonal competition and thus B cell selection has not yet been dened and is the
subject of this paper
GCs are initially seeded by a small number of proliferating B cells that bind the antigen
with at least low afnity Kroese et al 1987 Jacob et al 1991a Liu et al 1991 After a

phase of B cell expansion somatic hypermutation is initiated in so-called centroblasts CBs
which are characterized by a low expression of surface IgM Upon differentiation into so-called
centrocytes CCs the IgM expression increases and CCs are selected according to the quality
of antigen binding CCs are in a state of activated apoptosis Liu  Arpin 1997 and in order
to survive they need to acquire antigen and present it to antigen-specic T cells that most prob-
ably have entered the GCs together with the antigen specic B cells MacLennan et al 2000
Aydar et al 2005
Whether antigen trapped on FDCs as opposed to soluble antigen is critical in the selection
process is currently controversial Aydar et al 2005 Haberman  Shlomchik 2003 Kosco-Vilbois 2003
Selected CCs either differentiate into memory cells or plasma cells or recycle ie differentiate
back into CBs which enables them to go through multiple rounds of mutation and selection
Early models of afnity maturation have focused on the selective effect of clonal competi-
tion for FDC-presented antigen Siskind  Benacerraf 1969 This view has been challenged
by the recently observed robustness of afnity maturation towards large variation in the amount
of initially deposited antigen Vora et al 1997 Hannum et al 2000 Manser 2004 Given
that secreted antibodies appear to be dispensable for afnity maturation Hannum et al 2000
this robustness is unlikely to derive from a competition with emerging serum antibodies Vora et al 1997
Tarlinton  Smith 2000 Iber  Maini 2002
The alternative model of a clonal competition for binding sites instead of antigen Kesmir  De Boer 2003
requires afnity maturation to strictly depend on antigen being encountered membrane-bound
which is the subject of controversy Haberman  Shlomchik 2003 Also antigen localization
would have to be restricted to a small number of places within the large dendritic network De-
spite many electron microscopy studies such localization restriction has not yet been reported
Without competition for access to antigen or FDCs higher afnity B cell clones could be
favoured on the level of antigen binding either because of differential signaling of B cells in
response to different afnities of binding Kouskoff et al 1998 or because high afnity B cells
require fewer encounters with the FDC to establish an immunological synapse and to extract
antigen Batista et al 2001 Meyer-Hermann 2002b Here immunological synapse refers to
the supramolecular segregation of proteins in lymphoid cell-cell contact zones Kupfer  Kupfer 2003
which enable long-term signalling and effector functions Huppa et al 2003
Finally recruitment of T cell help may be competitive In vitro assays show that higher
afnity B cells are more able to recruit T cell help Batista  Neuberger 1998 which may be
crucial in the GC environment where T cells constitute only 5-10 of the GC cell population
Kelsoe 1996
While experiments have addressed the various hypotheses they have not yet succeeded
in ruling out any of the above mechanisms This is largely due to the experimental difcul-
ties that are associated with the investigation of such complex systems We therefore em-
ployed an extended version of a previously described agent based model for GC reactions
Meyer-Hermann 2002b Meyer-Hermann  Maini 2005b which allowed us to investigate
the impact of each factor separately Model assumptions are based on experimental data mostly
stemming from lymph nodes of mice or rats and the results are robust against physiologically
conceivable variations in the parameter values
We nd that both a competition for access to FDCs as well as a competition for antigen even
in the presence of antibodies does not enable afnity maturation to the experimentally observed
degree On the other hand both a CC refractory time for interaction with FDCs and competition
for T cell help can drive afnity maturation  especially when the acquisition of antigen and
survival signals from the FDCs is uncompetitive Given that both selection mechanisms enable
afnity maturation over a wide range of antigen densities even if antigen is encountered in
soluble form we suggest either one or both of these to be the physiological mechanism of B
cell selection Experiments are suggested to test this unexpected model prediction
2 Model
21 In silico germinal center simulations
We employ in silico simulations of the GC reaction to analyse the B cell selection mecha-
nisms The simulations are performed using a previously described stochastic hybrid agent-
based model Meyer-Hermann 2002b Meyer-Hermann  Maini 2005b which has been ex-
tended to test the different selection mechanisms The basic idea is to rebuild a GC in silico
and to study how its spatial organization dynamics and output depend on the assumptions
that are made about the comprised cells and their interactions The GC is represented by a
lattice whose nodes represent cells With the exception of pre-plasma and memory cells the
GC cells are conned to the area of the GC as dened by the mantle zone The cell-lattice is
supplemented by a second grid for soluble signals These satisfy reaction-diffusion-equations
which are solved numerically Given that the analysis of three-dimensional models leads to
similar results Meyer-Hermann  Beyer 2002 we restrict our analysis to two dimensions in
order to gain better statistics because of substantially shorter computation times We include
centroblasts centrocytes FDCs and output cells such as plasma and memory cells in all our
simulations and study the effect of T helper cells on centrocyte selection in an additional set of
simulations The different cell types are encoded in the simulation by dening differently sized
objects that are associated with distinct sets of rules which reect their biological properties
The rules determine the cellular dynamics by dening motility cell-cell interactions cell-cycle
times cellular lifetimes and similar properties A comprehensive list of these properties is given
below Despite the complexity of the GC reaction only a limited set of parameters is required
to respect commonly accepted GC properties and to capture available quantitative experimental
data Reasonable estimates can be obtained for most of the parameters Table 1 and the few
exceptions are studied in detail While most of the experimental data stem from lymph nodes of
mice or rats the model applies to all GCs that exhibit similar GC morphology and cell dynamics
22 Antibody representation
In order to analyse B cell afnity maturation we need to dene the afnity and thus quality of an-
tibodies Antibodies are represented in a four-dimensional shape space Perelson  Oster 1979
According to the principle of complementarity the antigen denes the position of the antibody
of maximum afnity to it in the shape space The distance of an arbitrary antibody to this op-
timal clone is calculated as a 1-norm in the shape space the minimum number of mutations to
reach the optimal clone and is assumed to be a measure for its afnity to the antigen The latter
is calculated as a Gaussian function with the distance as argument and a width of 28 mutations
The power and the width of the afnity function is calculated on the basis of experimental data

23 Cell motility
In agreement with recent two-photon imaging data collected in vivo from mice lymph nodes
Miller et al 2002 cells are assumed to perform an undirected and active movement Unless
stated otherwise every cell is attributed to a single node All cell states include a mean speed
vcell a polarity pcell and a persistence time tcell where cell denotes the different cell types The
probability of displacement of a cell to a next neighbour node is determined by vcell The direc-
tion of movement is set by pcell and the polarity changes with a rate according to tcell The
new polarity is chosen randomly ie without any memory effect The values of these motility
parameters are taken from experiment Miller et al 2002 and are given in the subsequent list
of cell types and in Table 1 However the two-photon experiment does not necessarily apply to
GC reactions such that this has to be considered as an assumption Note that the actual move-
ment of the cells may be less than expected from vcell when contact inhibition by other cells
suppresses the movement
24 Cell types
The following list provides a comprehensive description of all cells and their specicities All
parameters without explicitly given value are of importance for the selection process and are
discussed within the results section
FDC The soma of each FDC is represented as a single lattice node Each FDC is assumed
to have four two per space dimension dendrites Every dendrite is attached to the soma and
extends to neighbouring nodes Given that dendrites are exible the lattice nodes to which den-
drites are attributed are not exclusive ie other cells can move onto these nodes This is not
possible for other cell types or the FDC soma FDCs are assumed to produce a differentiation
signal for centroblasts CBs with a rate rsignal see below In order to reduce computational
efforts FDCs are assumed to be immobile This is a sufcient approximation because the in-
teraction frequency with centrocytes is dominantly determined by the typical distance between
FDC binding sites and CCs This corresponds to the density of the FDC network which is deter-
mined by the number of FDCs NFDC and the length of the dendrites dFDC A suitable quantity
to measure the density of the FDC network is the number of nodes XFDC from which access
to FDC sites is possible in the GC area We assume access points to be at the position of the
dendrites and on all neighbour lattice points This yields
XFDC  NFDC
with D the dimension of the lattice and x  10m the resolution of the lattice chosen as the
average B cell diameter The physiological range is 48  XFDC  144 this corresponds to
100 FDCs per GC Kesmir  De Boer 1999 NFDC  4 in the two-dimensional simulation
with a total length of dendrites of each FDC 2DdFDC  40  120m The FDC number in two
dimensions is calculated by comparing the FDC density of a spherical GC in three dimensions
to the FDC density in a GC slice of thickness x  10m
Centroblasts CBs are a subpopulation of B cells in the GC CBs divide with a cycle time
of 6 hours Liu et al 1991 ie 9 hours in two dimensions and owing to somatic hypermu-
tation acquire in each cell division non-silent mutations with probability 05 Nossal 1992
Mutations are modelled by a jump to a next neighbour in the shape space in an arbitrary di-
rection wider jumps are excluded The transcription factors for susceptibility to apoptosis are
already up-regulated in CB Klein et al 2003 We assume CBs not to be affected by these
before they differentiate to CCs Equally CBs are assumed not to interact with FDCs or T cells
thus neglecting possible rescue mechanisms acting directly on CBs CBs differentiate to CCs
at rate rdi once the local concentration of differentiation signal which is produced by FDCs
and diffuses over the lattice exceeds a threshold value Given that neither the exact signal
nor its threshold concentration are known the signal production rate by FDC is given in units
of this threshold Because of their larger size we expect CBs to move at a lower mean speed
vCB  15mmin and tCB  2min than measured for naive B cells Miller et al 2002
Assuming that the mean speed scales according to Stokes friction law ie with the inverse
ratio of the radii of CBs and naive B cells we obtain a realistic approximation of real motility
properties This assumption might be wrong in view of observed rather motile large B cells
Gunzer et al 2004 However the motility of centroblasts has no important inuence for the
selection mechanisms which are primarily related to the centrocyte motility
Centrocytes CCs differentiate from CBs and neither divide nor mutate CCs are in an activated
state of apoptosis and they have a lifetime of 10 hours Liu et al 1994 within which they
need to receive a rescue signal to avoid death Dead CCs are rapidly removed from the lattice
assuming a fast clearance of apoptotic bodies The exact nature of the rescue signal depends on
the selection mechanism CCs can be in one of the following states unselected in contact with
FDC selected by FDC in contact with T cell selected Thus the subpopulation of CCs is rather
heterogeneous Klein et al 2003
Unselected CCs need to nd one of the XFDC sites Once they have access to an FDC site
they try to bind the antigen The binding probability is proportional to the antibody-antigen
afnity Unsuccessful CCs have to wait for 6 minutes before they can try binding again This
short refractory time ensures independence of the binding process from the time resolution
in the simulations Note that one investigated selection mechanism consists in a prolonga-
tion of this refractory time see results section Successful CCs switch to the state in contact
with FDC and are rescued from apoptosis The CC remains bound to the FDC for two hours
Lindhout et al 1995 During this time the rescue signals are thought to be provided by the
FDC and the CCs turn into the state selected by FDC Note that the FDCs are assumed to pro-
vide rescue signals and not to negatively select unsuccessful CCs via for example the FasL-Fas
pathway Verbeke et al 1999
All investigated selection mechanisms act on CCs and dene how CCs in the state selected
by FDC reach the state selected This process is described when the different selection mecha-
nisms are introduced in the results section
Selected CCs further differentiate within 7 hours to pre-plasma cells or memory cells both
summarised as output cells in the following or they alternatively recycle back to CBs No data
yet exists to relate the relative receptor quality of the CC to its probability of entering either dif-
ferentiation path In fact available experimental data Han et al 1995b can be reproduced by
assuming that this probability does not depend on receptor quality Meyer-Hermann et al 2001
and as in Meyer-Hermann et al 2001 we therefore assume that selected CCs recycle with
probability 08 and differentiate to output cells with probability 02
CC motility characteristics are assumed to be identical to those of naive B cells Miller et al 2002
and to be the same in all states ie vCC  5mmin and tCC  2min
T cells T cells are only included in one set of simulations in which they are part of the se-
lection process of CC As the relative amount of specic and unspecic T cells is not known
only T cells that are specic for the antigen are included such that all NTC T cells will be
able to interact with CCs selected by FDC Consequently the number of included T cells may
underestimate the total number of T cells present in the GC The error introduced by this sim-
plication is restricted to spatial effects of T cells which can be assumed to be small in view
of the comparably small total number of T cells in GCs When T cells interact with CC that
have encountered antigen on FDC they develop a polarity towards the CC If more than one CC
selected by FDC simultaneously interact with a T cell the T cell is assumed to polarize towards
the CC with highest afnity to the antigen Without CC the polarity of the T cell is random The
T cell motility characteristics are vTC  108mmin and tTC  2min Miller et al 2002
Output cells Pre-plasma cells and memory B cells are collected in a cell pool denoted by
output cells These cells are assumed to have the same motility characteristics as CCs
contrast to CCs output cells can leave the GC environment when reaching the border of the
GC These cells may be thought of as crossing the mantle zone and entering the marginal zone
The total number of output cells produced will be taken as a measure of GC success independent
of their presence in the GC at the end of the reaction
25 Diffusion of molecular signals and soluble antibodies
The model includes diffusing CB differentiation signals as well as soluble antibodies The
discretised diffusion equation is solved on the lattice with Dirichlet boundary conditions and
with constant diffusion coefcient Note that the diffusion coefcients Ddi  200m2hr and
Dab  2000m2hr are chosen to be very small in order to respect the high cell density in
GC that act as obstacles for free diffusion of molecules However the results are robust against
different choices of parameter values Numerically the Crank-Nicholson and the alternating
direction implicit ADI method are used in two and three dimensions respectively
In one selection mechanism antigen masking by antibodies is considered Antibodies b are
produced by output cells at some rate rab diffuse on the lattice and locally bind to antigen a on
FDCs to form immune complexes c according to the rate equation
 katbt  kct
While the afnity of the secreted antibodies will increase during the course of the immune
response we simplied the simulation by using binding rates characteristic of high afnity an-
tibodies eg k  106Ms and k  103s Batista  Neuberger 1998 Fersht 1998
This simplication is appropriate as we show that even under such conditions antibody produc-
tion at a physiological rate does not sufciently increase afnity maturation The total amount
of antigen and of antibody is conserved in reaction 2 but these will nonetheless not remain
constant since free antigen is consumed by CCs that bind to FDC and antibodies are produced
by output cells This equation is solved using a simple Euler method at every node
26 Initial configuration
The GC reaction is seeded by a small number of activated B cells that expand rapidly and ll the
GC with about 104 B cells before somatic hypermutation starts McHeyzer-Williams et al 1993
Toellner et al 2002 and enables the evolution of higher afnity antibodies In general a small
number of clones dominate the reaction after this expansion We start the GC simulation after
this expansion phase with 1100 CBs which correspond to the 104 B cells in three dimensions
that stem from three different low afnity clones binding probability 004 The antibodies of
these clones all have a distance of 5 mutations to the optimal clone in the shape space that is
they require a minimum of 5 mutations to gain the optimal afnity However most sequences
of mutations will not follow such an optimal antibody afnity evolution path In fact we ob-
serve about 9 mutations in most output cells which is in agreement with experimental data
Kueppers et al 1993 The CBs are distributed randomly within the GC We assume a po-
larised morphology of the GC in the sense that the FDCs are placed at arbitrary nodes on 23 of
the total GC volume Camacho et al 1998 Fig 1cd If T cells are included then they are
distributed randomly within the GC Note however that the bias of BC-ow from dark to light
zone induces an inhomogeneous TC distribution which are then concentrated in the outer light
zone as observed in experiment Hardie et al 1993 without additional assumptions
27 Simulations and analysis of the results
In order to achieve comparability between the different selection mechanisms two parameters
that affect CB to CC differentiation were varied within physiological limits while all other pa-
rameters are kept constant throughout all simulations see Table 1 such that the experimentally
determined GC kinetics and dark zone duration were reproduced These two GC characteristics
were chosen since both are well established by experiments and variations of these strongly
affect the output of the reaction Meyer-Hermann 2002b
We assume the differentiation of CB to CC to be initiated by an FDC-derived signal A
signal for CB to CC differentiation has not yet been identied experimentally However this
mechanism  unlike other mechanisms  gives rise to the experimentally observed GC zoning
Meyer-Hermann  Maini 2005b and a realistic GC morphology is important for a realistic
investigation of selection mechanisms Beyond the effects stemming from the spatial organ-
isation of the GC this parameter does not affect B cell selection The differentiation signal
production rate per FDC rsignal widely determines the duration of the dark zone and is ad-
justed such that the dark zone vanishes between day 8 and 9  200 hours  full line in Fig-
ure 1F and in panel C in Figures 2-11 in the Supplementary Information after immunization
Camacho et al 1998
The second adjusted parameter the duration of CB-CC differentiation tdi governs the
total population dynamics and is chosen such that GC kinetic data Liu et al 1991 Hollowood  Macartney 1992
are reproduced with sufcient accuracy Figure 1D The deviation  from the data is calculated

than 03 Figure 1E and panel B of Figures 2-11 in the Supplementary Information Note that
tdi must be less than 7 hours since CBs are found in the light zone as CCs within 6-7 hours
Liu et al 1991 A minimal value is not known
The GC reaction is expected to end after 21 days Given that the simulation was tuned to
reproduce the GC kinetics the cell number within the GC decreases below 100 cells after 300-
400 hours for all analysed selection mechanisms Figure 1F dotted line and panel C in Figures
2-11 in the Supplementary Information The nal cell numbers at day 21 vary for different
selection regimes between almost zero and less than 100 see the same gures dashed dotted
lines
There are further characteristics of GC reactions to which the simulation was not tted
but which had to be reproduced by the simulation in order to ensure the models physiological
relevance Thus the ratio of CCs to CBs at day 12 after immunization needs to be larger than
2 in order to agree with the experimental observation that CCs greatly outnumber CBs during
6 of produced output cells ie pre-
the GC reaction MacLennan et al 1990 and the ratio q12
plasma and memory B cells at day 12 to day 6 after immunization should be the order of 6
Han et al 1995a Figure 1C and panel D of Figures 2-11 in the Supplementary Information
The factor q12
6 can be interpreted as a measure for the steepness of the output production
Unless stated otherwise all simulations remain in agreement with the aforementioned exper-
imental constraints compare gures in the Supplementary Information where the full data sets
are shown The selection mechanisms that rescue CCs from apoptosis have to rely on some
afnity dependent competition between different CCs to achieve afnity maturation Therefore
the success of a GC reaction is measured by the afnity of the output cells averaged over all
cells produced during the reaction panel B of Figures 124-6 and panel E of Figures 2-11 in
the Supplementary Information This quantity is an indicator of the entire GC reaction and is
not restricted to arbitrary time points of the reaction The total number of output cells produced
is monitored since a stable population will need to be formed to enable robust antibody produc-
tion Note that the full datasets are shown only in the case of site competition For all other
scenarios we show only the most important data and refer to the Supplementary Information for
the full datasets
3 Results
31 Competition for binding sites on FDCs
According to the simplest of all suggested models B cells are selected only in a competition
for access to antigen andor survival factors that are provided by the FDCs other potentially
limiting factors are ignored Figure 1A in the Supplementary Information Accordingly the
number of FDC sites XFDC see Eq 1 on which antigen is presented would be the limiting
factor for which different clones would compete As described in the Model section we assume
that CC bind antigen held on FDC with a probability proportional to the afnity of the antibody
Given that no further limiting resources are considered in this very simple model CC that
have been selected by FDCs eg CC selected by FDC in the language of the model see Model
section do not need any further steps to be positively selected and can follow the differentiation
paths of successfully selected CC
By variation of the site number XFDC the simulation indeed reveals that afnity maturation
is enforced when the number of FDC sites is low Figure 1B Afnity maturation can be ob-
served for a physiological number of FDC sites 48  XFDC  144  see Eq 1 the extent
of the process less than 50 high afnity output cells is however rather low compared to other
selection mechanisms investigated here and not robust to changes in the number of accessible
The GC characteristics are reproduced in silico Thus the CC to CB ratio at day 12 as well
as the output ratio at day 12 to day 6 are in agreement with experimental data for the entire
physiological range Figure 1C The duration of CB-CC differentiation tdi which decreases

range for the physiological FDC site numbers Short CB to CC differentiation times had to be
employed in order to reproduce the experimentally observed GC kinetics because the selection
method is not stringent enough to reduce the volume of the GC reaction considerably
We conclude that whilst B cell competition for access to FDCs can give rise to the observed
GC kinetics and properties afnity maturation is relatively poor and not robust against small
variations in the number of binding sites
32 Limiting the interactions with FDCs by introducing a refractory time
If CCs can reinitiate binding to FDCs every 6 minutes as assumed in our analysis of site com-
petition then the total number of encounters is considerable during a CC lifetime of 10 hours
Any mechanism that limits the total number of encounters will lower the probability of a suc-
cessful interaction within a CC lifetime and will favour higher afnity clones because they have
a higher chance of binding successfully in an early attempt We therefore speculate that an in-
crease in the refractory time tdelay  the time during which B cells that failed to bind during
a previous contact with a FDC are unable to bind again will increase the selection pressure see
also Figure 1B in the Supplementary Information
Increasing the refractory time from 6 minutes to 4 hours we nd that a refractory time as
low as 05 hours is sufcient to induce afnity maturation of extent similar to that with site
competition but for a wide range of FDC site numbers Thus at XFDC  120 Figure 2
when competition for antigen presenting FDC sites is weak afnity maturation reaches a level
previously only seen at low XFDC  40 site numbers compare full lines in Figure 1B and
2B A refractory time of 4 hours leads to rather efcient afnity maturation 60-70 of all
output cells are of high afnity while allowing an even better reproduction of the other GC
characteristics kinetics dark zone duration ratio of CC to CB at day 12 and output ratio at
day 12 to day 6 Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information than competition for FDC sites
Figure 1
Given that the binding probability depends on both the afnity dependent binding proba-
bility per encounter as well as the number of encounters per CC lifetime afnity maturation
can also be fostered by reducing the binding probability per encounter by a certain factor for
all afnities However the effect is smaller than in the case of an increased CC refractory time
since such a general reduction in the binding probability also strongly reduces the selection
probability for high afnity clones These are little affected by a reduction in the number of
encounters since they will bind with high probability on their rst or second trial A combi-
nation of both effects can however reduce the refractory time required to gain good afnity
maturation to more reasonable physiological values Figure 2B dashed line and Figure 3 in the
Supplementary Information
The agreement with general GC properties the efcient afnity maturation and the robust-
ness to variations in the antigen presenting FDC site number make this a candidate mechanism
for B cell selection in vivo
33 Competition for antigen presented on FDCs
In the two previous scenarios antigen is presented by FDCs on a limited number of sites where
it is available in limitless supply Instead it has been proposed that antigen is widely spread
Figure 2 A limitation of CC-FDC interaction allows for robust affinity maturation

but that the total amount is limiting such that antigen consumption can drive afnity maturation
Sidman  Unanue 1975 Using a sufciently dense FDC network XFDC  120 to avoid site
competition we can study this selection mechanism in silico by homogeneously distributing a
number of antigen portions Nag on all FDC sites and by removing one portion from each site
on which CCs have successfully interacted with the FDC see also Figure 1C in the Supplemen-
tary Information The binding probability is expected to decrease with decreasing amounts of
antigen remaining on the FDC sites As a simple approximation we assume a linear decrease
of the CC-binding probability for antigen amounts below some threshold ag For larger anti-
gen amounts the binding probability is constant and solely determined by the antibody-antigen
afnity This assumption corresponds to a saturation of the binding probability when antigen is
abundant
While the selection pressure indeed increases over time as a result of this Figure 3B the
extent of afnity maturation is rather worse than for site competition alone compare Figure 1B
for XFDC  120 and Figure 4B This is due to the initial abundance of antigen and the inferred
low selection pressure which in turn results in the production of a large number of low afnity
output cells before antigen consumption can increase the selection pressure compare Figure
3A and B
If the size of the removed antigen portions per CC-FDC interaction is constant antigen
consumption is insufcient to increase the selection pressure in the case of large initial antigen
densities more than 80 antigen portions per FDC site compare Figures 1B and 4B at lower
antigen density antigen is rapidly consumed and the GC reaction declines early before high
afnity clones are found Figure 4 and Figure 4 in the Supplementary Information In the case
of antigen consumption proportional to the level of presented antigen a scenario comparable to
antigen masking by antibodies arises see next section
Figure 3 The time course of affinity maturation The fraction of high afnity cells dened as
cells with antigen binding probability of more than 03 is shown for CB CCs and the accumu-
lated sum of output cells separately In A selection is based on a refractory time for CC-FDC
interaction of 2 hours taken from Figure 2 while in B selection is based on competition for
antigen with 40 antigen portions per FDC site taken from Figure 4 In C the time course of
free and total antigen on FDC and soluble antibody is shown for the same experiment as in B
but including soluble antibody taken from Figure 5 Soluble antibody induces an early reduction
of free antigen and thereby increases competition for antigen as compared to B The shaded area
denotes one standard deviation in 50 simulations
Experiments have revealed a high robustness to variations in the initial antigen density
Vora et al 1997 Hannum et al 2000 If in the simulation the antigen-threshold to the max-
imum binding probability ag is xed and not scaled with the amount of initially deposited
antigen ag  Nag then such robustness can be observed on a low level see Figures 5 and
6 in the Supplementary Information It should be noted that successful afnity maturation
at lower antigen densities results from a reduced binding probability for all afnities as dis-
cussed in the previous section such that the observed robustness is the result of two different
mechanisms acting in different antigen density ranges
We conclude that in silico antigen consumption does not improve afnity maturation over
site competition alone At low antigen densities the general properties of the GC reaction can
no longer be reproduced Afnity maturation is therefore unlikely to be driven by antigen
Figure 4 Affinity maturation is not induced by competiton for antigen In silico GC exper-
iments with 120 FDC sites The antigen binding probability of CC is linearly reduced with the
amount of remaining antigen on FDCs see Figure 4 in the Supplementary Information for the full
dataset A Parameter adaptation duration of CB differentiation and differentiation signal pro-
duction rate per FDC B extent of afnity maturation measured as average binding probability

consumption even when combined with site competition
34 The impact of antigen masking by competing antibodies
Plasma cells outside the GC produce antibodies at rates of up to rab  2  103 antibody
molecules per second Randall et al 1992 These antibodies may mask antigen in the GCs and
thereby increase the selection pressure on B cells and simultaneously provide a feedback mech-
anism that enables robustness towards alterations in the initial antigen density Vora et al 1997
Tarlinton  Smith 2000 Iber  Maini 2002 see also Figure 1D in the Supplementary Infor-
mation Assuming that plasma cells produce high afnity antibodies in the GC at a rate of
rab  102 per output cell thus overestimating a realistic production of soluble antibody in
GCs we nd that the above considerations do indeed hold true A physiological GC kinetic
can be obtained for antigen amounts between 20 and 200 antigen portions per FDC site Figure
7 in the Supplementary Information A small improvement in afnity maturation is observed
relative to site and antigen competition alone Figure 5 As before afnity maturation ap-
proaches the site competition value for 120 sites when antigen is abundant Figure 5B and 1B
The effect of strong antibody production is an early reduction in free antigen and thus an
early increase in the selection pressure Figure 3C For example in the case of 40 antigen
portions per FDC site ie for optimal afnity maturation only 25 of the antigen is used
during the GC reaction but free antigen is kept in the limiting regime throughout the reaction
Figure 3C In that way the inefcient time course of afnity maturation found in the case of
antigen consumption without soluble antibodies Figure 3B is restored to some extend
While antigen masking leads to the correct kinetics and a small improvement of afnity
maturation the number of produced output cells is rather small Figure 5B as is the ratio of
6  6 Figure 5B in the Supplementary Information We conclude that
CC to CB and q12
Figure 5 Antigen masking by soluble antibodies increases competition for antigen in the
early phase of GC reaction In silico GC experiments as in Figure 4 with antibody production
of 102 antibodies per second and per plasma cell see Figure 7 in the Supplementary Information
for the full dataset A Parameter adaptation duration of CB differentiation and differentiation
signal production rate per FDC B extent of afnity maturation measured as average binding
probability and number of output cells
antigen masking resolves some of the problems in the antigen competition scenario but some
major GC properties are still not reproduced In addition this mechanism is not robust to a
substantial 10-fold decrease in the antibody production rate which is more realistic than the
rate assumed in the present in silico experiment
35 Competition for T cell help
Interactions between antigen specic CCs and T cells are necessary for CC survival and dif-
ferentiation de Vinuesa et al 2000 Given that T cells only constitute 5-10 of the GC cell
population Kelsoe 1996 this interaction may be competitive While T cells can bind to several
B cells simultaneously they can only polarize to one Kupfer et al 1994 which we assume to
be the CC that has previously bound antigen with highest afnity see also Figure 1E in the Sup-
plementary Information In our simulation polarization has to be maintained for a minimum
time trescue to rescue a B cell Cells that bind to T cells for longer than tapop  trescue
and do not receive rescue signals for at least trescue are doomed to apoptosis Note that all CCs
need to be selected by FDCs before they can compete for T cell help
We nd that the extent of afnity maturation is only slightly enhanced as compared to site
competition alone XFDC  120 sites if 5-10 of all GC cells are antigen-specic T cells
50-100 T cells per GC in the two-dimensional simulation to which antigen-presenting CCs
can bind Figure 6B full line However given that each antigen-specic T cell only recognizes
a certain antigen epitope and different CCs will process the antigen differently and therefore
present different epitopes only a small fraction of GC T cells will be reactive to a given CC The
simulation reveals that afnity maturation is strongest 60-70 of all output cells are of high
afnity when only about 05-1 of all GC cells 5-10 T cells per GC in the two-dimensional
simulation can rescue a given antigen presenting CC Figure 6B full line The GC char-
acteristics are reproduced Figure 6A and Figure 8 in the Supplementary Information The
mechanism is robust to large variations in antigen availability and may still work when antigen
is encountered in soluble form since the simulations were performed in a regime where antigen
acquisition and interactions with FDCs are uncompetitive
Figure 6 Competition for T cell help allows for robust affinity maturation In silico GC ex-
periments with 120 FDC sites abundant antigen and T cells as indicated on the axis trescue  2
hours and tapop  21 hours see Figure 8 in the Supplementary Information for the full
dataset A Parameter adaptation duration of CB differentiation and differentiation signal pro-
duction rate per FDC B extent of afnity maturation measured as average binding probability
and number of output cells Combining competition for T cell help with a CC refractory time of
05 hours and a reduction of the binding probability to 05 leads to more robust afnity maturation
squares and diamonds and Figure 11 in the Supplementary Information than in the standard case
circles and triangles
The time span tapop for which CCs can survive while binding to T cells without receiving
rescue signals has a major impact on the level of afnity maturation Thus a small increase
in tapop from 21 to 4 hours already reduces afnity maturation to a level comparable to
site competition see Figure 9 in the Supplementary Information A combination of T cell
competition with a general reduction of the binding probability to 50 of its value see above
has no major effect on the result see Figure 10 in Supplementary Information However a
combination of competition for T cell help with a longer CC refractory time makes afnity
maturation more robust against changes in the T cell density Figure 6B dashed line
4 Discussion
The simulation results presented here reveal current models of B cell selection competition
for access to FDCs or antigen to be incompatible with available experimental information
We propose two novel mechanisms a refractory time between CC-FDC engagements as well
as competition for T cell help Both mechanisms enable strong afnity maturation in silico
while reproducing all available experimental information on GC dynamics In agreement with
experiments Vora et al 1997 Hannum et al 2000 the mechanisms are robust to variations
in the amount of initially deposited antigen As competition for antigen held on FDC is as-
sumed to be non-limiting in both mechanisms it is likely that these mechanisms also work with
soluble antigen which would be in agreement with results from recent experiments that call
into question the concept that antigen presentation by FDCs is essential Hannum et al 2000
Haberman  Shlomchik 2003 However in the present simulations an FDC-independent pre-
selection of CCs with soluble antigen has not been tested Note that this in silico simulation
is not able to cover all possible cellular interactions that might serve as suitable mechanism
for afnity maturation Thus the two highlighted novel mechanisms have to be considered as
propositions
Competition for access to FDCs or antigen does not provide a sufcient selection pressure
to enable a high level of afnity maturation in the simulation While antigen consumption does
lead to an increase in the selection pressure this increase comes too late so that many low
afnity output cells have already been produced and the remaining cell numbers are insufcient
for successful afnity maturation Moreover for low antigen densities the GC reaction ends
prematurely since antigen consumption then removes too much antigen While antigen masking
by emerging antibodies can in principle increase the selection pressure earlier the antibody
production rate would need to be unphysiologically high Even then the available data on GCs
could not be reproduced and in addition afnity maturation is not as strong as that produced
by the alternative mechanism Given that evolution tends to optimise performance this latter
limitation may also be interpreted as an argument against these mechanisms
At rst sight less than 200 output cells that is less than 8000 cells in three dimensions may
seem low Given the efcient expansion of output cells the success of an immune response can
however be expected to primarily depend on the size of the high afnity fraction this is there-
fore a physiologically realistic result Note that the level of afnity maturation that is achieved
in the simulations 60-70 of all output cells are of high afnity is in qualitative agreement
with the experimentally observed domination of high afnity clones Smith et al 1997 We
had to restrict ourselves to two-dimensional simulations to generate the results with sufcient
statistics which prevents us from a quantitative comparison of this result
To our knowledge this theoretical investigation is the rst systematic comparison of different
B cell selection mechanisms in GC reactions as well as the rst theoretical work to investigate a
possible role of T cells in the selection process Previous models have concentrated on single se-
lection mechanisms Iber  Maini 2002 Meyer-Hermann 2002b Meyer-Hermann  Maini 2005b
Oprea  Perelson 1997 Oprea et al 2000 Beyer et al 2002 Kesmir  De Boer 1999 Meyer-Hermann et al 2001
and have in general described them only phenomenologically ie without including details of
cell interactions The impact of the spatial cell distribution has only been investigated in a few
models Kesmir  De Boer 2003 Meyer-Hermann 2002b Meyer-Hermann  Maini 2005b
Beyer et al 2002 The present model is based on available GC kinetics and cell motility data
see Model section and the parameters have been evaluated carefully using data from mice and
rat lymph nodes see Table 1 We did not nd any experimentally uncertain parameter which
would change our results qualitatively
The only critical assumption is the shape space concept combined with a smooth afnity
function Changes of the width of the function for the afnity dependent selection probability
in the shape space has important consequences for GC development For small variations of
the width all constraints from experiment can be respected by a corresponding adaption of
other parameters However this becomes impossible when the width is strongly varied This
shows that our choice for the width is well-dened While the suitability of the shape space
concept for antigen-antibody afnity may be questioned insufcient molecular information on
antigen-antibody interaction is currently available to allow a more accurate model of mutation-
dependent increases in antibody-antigen afnity
Autoreactive BC have not been considered in the present simulations because under normal
circumstances they are not positively selected by T cells and are therefore eliminated by apop-
tosis similar to other antigen-unspecic CCs We therefore assumed autoreactive BC to be part
of the pool of low afnity BC that emerge from the seeder cells by disadvantageous mutations
This may shift the proportion of advantageous and disadvantageous mutations However we
believe that this approximation remains within the error introduced by the shape space concept
itself which most likely will inaccurately reproduce this proportion
The CC refractory time and the competition for T cell help are equally attractive selection
mechanisms to explain antibody afnity maturation in GCs and are both likely to play a role in B
cell selection The CC refractory time limits the number of selection trials per CC lifespan such
that only high afnity B cells which bind with high probability on the rst or second trial are ef-
ciently selected The CC refractory time will be a consequence of IgM-independent interactions
between CCs and FDCs While the exact duration of such interactions still has to be determined
in studies that employ CCs and FDCs a refractory time between two CC-FDC encounters as
long as 4 hours appears to be unlikely However we have also shown that an additional general
ie afnity independent reduction of the CC-FDC binding probability to 05 may reduce the
necessary refractory time to 15-30 minutes One may speculate that integrin interactions may
result in such a refractory time LFA-1ICAM-1 and VLA-4VCAM-1 have been described to
mediate adhesion of B cells to FDCs Koopman et al 1991 Even though unspecic contacts
are dissolved in the range of minutes Gunzer et al 2004 experiments with lipid bilayers have
also shown that especially at low to medium afnity antigen binding may fail to induce the for-
mation of an immunological synapse but can still result in a rm integrin-dependent attachment
of B cells Carrasco et al 2004 The speed at which these integrin-dependent contacts form
and dissolve if B cells fail to establish an immunological synapse which is generally believed
to enable B cell activation and antigen extraction Batista et al 2001 may determine the re-
fractory time A different possibility is a reduced CC motility after an unsuccessful binding
event This might reduce the subsequent interaction frequency of CCs with FDCs2
An additional competition for T cell help further reduces the necessary CC refractory time
It has been shown in vitro that specic T cell help is essential for afnity maturation in the
case of NP 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl Aydar et al 2005 and more generally the role
of T cells in the selection process has been highlighted de Vinuesa et al 2000 While there
is as yet neither direct experimental evidence for competition for T cell help nor have antigen-
specic T helper cells in the GC so far been suggested as a limiting factor for afnity matu-
ration what is known about B cell-T cell interactions strongly supports such a model Thus
T cells have been observed to interact with several B cells at a time but to only activate the
B cell towards which the microtubule organizing center MTOC and the colocalized Golgi
apparatus are reorganized Kupfer et al 1994 Poo et al 1988 Kupfer et al 1991 Reorien-
tation of the MTOC is dependent on and directed towards the site of T cell receptor signaling
Sedwick et al 1991 and when interacting with several B cells T cells polarize to the B cell
with the highest density of specic pMHC Depoil et al 2005 We propose that a higher afn-
ity of interaction results in increased pMHC presentation such that only the highest afnity-CC
interacting with a T cell is rescued Such causal relationship is in agreement with the earlier
observations that T cell responsiveness to B cells depends on both the antigen concentration and

afnity Batista  Neuberger 1998 as well as on the antigen availability dependent number
of MHC class II loaded with antigenic peptidepMHC that are presented on the B cell surface
Harding  Unanue 1990 Grakoui et al 1999 It is not an essential element of the present
model but a plausible hypothesis that apoptosis is induced in all other B cells to which the T
cell does not sufciently polarise This negative selection by T helper cells could in principle
be mediated by FasL-Fas as interactions which can be expected to form in all contact zones in-
dependent of T cell polarization Whether FasL is at all upregulated on GC T cells is however
currently unclear since the spatial distribution of FasL in GCs from patients with lymphofol-
licular hyperplasia correlates with the FDC network rather than with the distribution of CD4
positive T cells Verbeke et al 1999
While simultaneous interactions of T cells with several B cells in a lymph node environment
have been reported as transient Okada et al 2005 all B cells and T cells used in that study
were of the same specicity and T cells rather than B cells were abundant It will be important
to repeat these studies under conditions that are more representative of GC reactions and to
access the afnity dependence of T cell-B cell interactions in far greater detail Imaging of T
cell interactions with B cells that have recognized antigen with different afnity should help to
clarify whether the MTOC does indeed reorganize to the highest afnity B cell and whether Fas-
FasL accumulate in the contact zones to induce apoptosis in the outcompeted CC Moreover it
will be interesting to test whether an articial expansion of antigen-specic GC T cell clones
can hamper antibody afnity maturation
B cell selection in competition for T cell help challenges the presently held view that FDCs
play a pivotal role in B cell selection In this novel mechanistic framework FDCs only play a
role in supporting fragile CCs with general survival and differentiation signals but do not drive
afnity maturation by negatively selecting B cells
A competition for T cell help and a long CC refractory time both enable afnity maturation
under conditions when acquisition of FDC signals is uncompetitive such as for a wide range
of antigen concentrations Accordingly these mechanisms are in agreement with experiments
that show that a reduction of antigen densities on FDCs by at least 400-fold does not prevent
antibody afnity maturation Hannum et al 2000
We conclude that within the selection mechanisms tested thus using a restricted set of pos-
sible interaction mechanisms a combination of T cell competition together with slow CC-FDC
interactions and a sub-optimal binding probability of high afnity clones can drive B cell selec-
tion in GCs under the experimentally established conditions Further insight into GC dynamics
and afnity maturation should be gained by combining the powerful predictions of these agent
based simulations with the latest imaging techniques
