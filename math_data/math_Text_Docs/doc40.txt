Abstract 
NMDA receptors are ion channels activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate in the mammalian 
brain and are important in synaptic function and plasticity but also influence neuronal excitability 
and mediate dendritic action potentials NMDA spikes There are different NMDA receptor 
subtypes which differ in their single-channel conductance Here NMDA receptors were studied in 
mouse barrel cortex the primary sensory cortex for input from the animals whiskers Using patch-
clamp single NMDA receptor currents were recorded from spiny stellate neurons of cortical layer 4 
and pyramidal neurons of layer 23 and both cell types were found to contain high-conductance as 
well as low-conductance NMDA receptors The results are consistent with previous pharmacological 
studies of synaptic plasticity at synapses from layer 4 spiny stellate neurons to layer 23 pyramidal 
neurons and at synapses between layer 23 pyramidal neurons They are also consistent with previous 
claims of a prominent role of low-conductance NMDA receptors in layer 4 spiny stellate neurons 
including broad integration amplification and distribution of excitation within the barrel in response 
to whisker stimulation as well as modulation of excitability by ambient glutamate However layer 4 
cells also expressed high-conductance NMDA receptors The presence of low-conductance NMDA 
receptors in layer 23 pyramidal neurons suggests that some of these functions may be shared with 
layer 4 spiny stellate neurons The mix of high- and low-conductance NMDA receptors in the two 
cell types may be relevant to threshold properties of dendritic NMDA spikes

Introduction 
NMDAR subtypes in barrel cortex 
N-Methyl-D-aspartate NMDA receptors constitute a major class of glutamate receptors in the 
mammalian brain Traynelis et al 2010 They contribute to the excitatory postsynaptic current 
EPSC Bekkers and Stevens 1989 and are crucial in synaptic plasticity Citri and Malenka 2008 
but also subserve other neuronal processes for example dendritic NMDA spikes Schiller et al 
2000 review Major et al 2013 or the sensing of ambient Sah et al 1989 and synaptic spill-over 
glutamate Kullmann et al 1996 and they can be present in synaptic and extrasynaptic locations 
Stocca and Vicini 1998 Thomas et al 2006 Hardingham and Bading 2010 
A number of NMDA receptor NMDAR subtypes are known with different properties Cull-Candy 
and Leszkiewicz 2004 presumably adapted to the roles they play in different systems NMDARs 
are tetramers typically consisting of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits The four known GluN2 
subunits A B C and D endow the receptor with distinctive properties For brevity one can refer to 
NMDARs containing two GluN2A subunits as GluN2A receptors GluN2ARs and likewise for B C 
and D GluN2A and GluN2B receptors have a higher single channel conductance than GluN2C or 
GluN2D receptors NMDARs with conductances in the higher range are therefore called high-
conductance NMDARs and if their conductances are in the lower range they are called low-
conductance NMDARs Beside these diheteromeric NMDARs with two GluN1 and two identical 
GluN2 subunits triheteromeric assemblies have been described for example with one GluN2A and 
one GluN2B subunit Paoletti et al 2013 and there are two further subunit types GluN3A and 
GluN3B Low and Wee 2010 Pachernegg et al 2012 activated by glycine 
Barrel cortex Fox 2008 the primary sensory cortex of the whiskers of rodents is one of the most 
intensively-studied regions of the mammalian neocortex Sensory input from the whiskers is received 
via the thalamus and the thalamo-cortical input fibers project to spiny stellate neurons of layer 4 L4 
of barrel cortex L4 spiny stellate cells make vertical connections to pyramidal neurons of layer 23 
L23 These cells in turn project horizontally to other L23 pyramidal neurons 
NMDARs are crucial to synaptic plasticity both at the L4-L23 vertical synapse and the L23-L23 
horizontal synapse but the plasticity mechanisms the NMDAR subtypes involved and their location 
seem to be different at these two synapses and also to depend on the type of plasticity When spike 
timing dependent plasticity Markram et al 1997 is studied at the L4-L23 synapse timing-
dependent long-term potentiation t-LTP requires postsynaptic but not presynaptic NMDARs 
whereas timing-dependent long-term depression t-LTD requires presynaptic but not postsynaptic 
NMDARs Rodriguez-Moreno and Paulsen 2008 In contrast t-LTD at the L23-L23 synapse 
requires postsynaptic but not presynaptic NMDARs Banerjee et al 2014 Furthermore the subunit 
composition of the NMDARs involved has been studied using pharmacological blockers Banerjee et 
al 2009 review Rodriguez-Moreno et al 2010 The presynaptic NMDARs involved in t-LTD at 
the L4-L23 synapse may contain GluN2C or GluN2D subunits while the postsynaptic NMDARs 
involved in t-LTP may contain the GluN2A subunit In contrast postsynaptic GluN2B receptors 
seem to be necessary for t-LTD at the L23-L23 synapse

NMDAR subtypes in barrel cortex 
Beside their role in synaptic plasticity NMDARs have other important roles in L4 spiny stellate cells 
of barrel cortex Apart from receiving the thalamic input these cells also form strong excitatory 
connections to other L4 spiny stellate cells of the same barrel thereby amplifying and distributing the 
afferent thalamic activity within the barrel Feldmeyer et al 1999 The EPSC has a relatively large 
NMDAR component even at potentials around rest which has been attributed either to a large 
number of GluN2A- or GluN2B-containing NMDARs at the synapse ibid or to the presence of 
GluN2C containing NMDARs which are less susceptible to block by Mg2 Fleidervish et al 1998 
Binshtok et al 2006 Furthermore tonic NMDAR stimulation by ambient glutamate has been 
shown to influence the resting potential and hence excitability of L4 spiny stellate neurons Binshtok 
et al 2006 Finally their dendrites exhibit NMDA spikes which contribute to the angular tuning of 
L4 spiny stellate cells when responding to whisker deflections Lavzin et al 2012 
Here to shed further light on the NMDAR subtypes expressed in different neuron types in barrel 
cortex single NMDAR channels in L23 pyramidal and L4 spiny stellate neurons were recorded with 
the patch-clamp method From histological expression studies Monyer et al 1994 one would 
generally expect to find GluN2A- or GluN2B-containing NMDARs in cortical excitatory neurons 
the presence of other subtypes would be surprising A pharmacological study of synaptic plasticity in 
barrel cortex by Banerjee et al 2009 suggests the expression of low-conductance GluN2C- or 
GluN2D-containing NMDARs in L4 spiny stellate cells but of high-conductance GluN2A- and 
GluN2B-containing NMDARs in L23 pyramidal neurons The involvement of GluN2C-containing 
NMDARs in the EPSCs from connections between L4 spiny stellate cells has been controversial 
Feldmeyer et al 1999 Fleidervish et al 1998 Binshtok et al 2006 Binshtok et al 2006 further 
corroborate the presence of GluN2C-containing receptors reporting single-channel recordings from 
L4 cells and histological data on the expression of the GluN2C subunit see also Suchanek et al 
1997 Hence in this study it was investigated whether the NMDAR subtypes encountered in L23 
pyramidal and L4 spiny stellate cells are consistent with the suggested plasticity mechanisms and 
whether the suggested high expression of GluN2C and the associated mechanisms in L4 spiny 
stellate cells are unique to these cells Both high- and low-conductance NMDARs were found in L23 
pyramidal and L4 spiny stellate neurons which is compatible with the proposed plasticity 
mechanisms but suggests that L4 spiny stellate neurons show considerable expression of functional 
high-conductance NMDARs in addition to GluN2C and that expression of low-conductance 
NMDARs is not unique to L4 in barrel cortex

23  Pipettes 
Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries Harvard Apparatus 15 mm outer 
diameter 086 mm inner diameter filamented glass Narishige gravity puller two-stage pull first 
drop about 7 mm and fire-polished The pipette size was estimated by measuring the bubble number 
Sakmann and Neher 1983 p 66f Bubble numbers were between 35 and 45 corresponding to tip 
resistances with the extracellular pipette solution between 18 and 14 M 
24  Setup recording 
Slices were viewed under an Olympus BX50WI fixed stage upright microscope with a x60 objective 
or a x10 objective for visualizing the barrels with infrared IR or visible light differential 
interference contrast DIC optics and a camera To assist orientation in the slice the current position 
in the slicing plane was monitored with an optical position encoder Renishaw Cell-attached patch-
clamp recordings were established with typical seal resistances around 15 G Voltage clamp data 
were collected with a MultiClamp 700B Axon Instruments amplifier with a feedback resistor of 50 
G and a 10 kHz 4-pole Bessel filter and digitized at a sampling frequency of 50 kHz The amplifier 
was controlled and the data acquired with a custom Matlab program written by H Robinson During 
the experiment perfusion with extracellular solution was maintained in the recording chamber with a 
gravity-fed inlet and a suction outlet All experiments were performed at room temperature 20-

In thalamocortical slices the barrel cortex is cut perpendicular to the brain surface such that all six 
cortical layers are present in the slice and the barrels at cortical layer 4 are visible under the 
microscope Barrel cortex was visually identified under x10 magnification Layer 4 was marked by 
the extent of the barrel L23 pyramidal neurons and L4 spiny stellate neurons were identified by their 
location in the slice as well as the distinctive shapes of their cell bodies L23 pyramidal neurons are 
triangular-shaped and polar with a clear apical dendrite pointing towards the cortex surface whereas 
L4 spiny stellate neurons appear apolar and spherical granular

26  Stimuli 
NMDAR currents were recorded in cell-attached mode in voltage-clamp holding the outside of the 
membrane at constant voltages cycling through 30 mV 20 mV  30 mV Steps to these test 
voltages were 900 ms in duration with 450 ms intervals at 0 mV between them 
27  Data analysis 
Analysis was done in Matlab with a custom program written by C Scheppach using a database 
SQLite for book-keeping of the data and analysis results All current traces were digitally filtered 
with a Gaussian filter at fc  1 kHz Leak subtraction of current traces was done manually identifying 
and specifying putative points of the baseline current for example in stretches without channel 
activity and interpolating between them spline interpolation or smoothing spline interpolation see 
Matlab function csaps Amplitude histograms of current traces were obtained by first subtracting the 
leak current and then computing the histogram with a bin width of 001 pA Gaussian functions were 
fitted to the histogram peaks using the Matlab function fminsearch least squares fit 
28  Statistics 
Statistical significance of differences in patch counts was tested with chi-squared tests contingency 
tables see Howell 2010 If the counts in two situations are compared and there is one fitted 
parameter the hit probability one can obtain a 2 value which is chi-squared distributed with 1 
degree of freedom dof The integrated chi-squared distribution corresponding to the 2 value 
yields the p-value If p was smaller than a significance level of 5 the difference of counts was 
called statistically significant 
Results 
31  Channel identification 
Single channel recordings of NMDA receptors were obtained from L23 pyramidal neurons and L4 
spiny stellate neurons of mouse barrel cortex The aim was to obtain information about the NMDAR 
subtypes present in these cells The strategy to differentiate between NMDAR subtypes was based on 
their difference in single channel conductance 
GluN2A and GluN2BRs both have a main conductance level of 50 pS and a subconductance level of 
40 pS Stern et al 1992 review Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz 2004 whereas GluN2CRs have 
conductance levels of 35 pS and 22 pS Stern et al 1992 review Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz 
2004 and GluN2DRs conduct at 35 pS and 16 pS Wyllie et al 1996 Momiyama et al 1996 
review Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz 2004 These values hold for an extracellular calcium 
concentration of 1 mM but the present experiments were performed at Ca2o  2 mM and 
NMDAR single-channel currents decrease with increasing Ca2o Ascher and Nowak 1988 by 
about 10 when going from Ca2o  1 mM to 2 mM Gibb and Colquhoun 1992 Wyllie et al 
1996 Therefore conductances  36 pS are expected for high-conductance NMDARs but  31 pS 
for low-conductance NMDARs allowing for a distinction between these two NMDAR classes 
For each neuron studied a cell-attached patch-clamp recording was established To activate NMDA 
receptors glutamate or NMDA was added to the pipette solution Current traces were collected with 
NMDAR subtypes in barrel cortex 
a voltage-clamp protocol holding the outside of the membrane at constant voltages cycling through 
30 mV 20 mV  30 mV to obtain a sufficient number of single-channel openings at a range of 
voltages to be able to measure the slope conductance and reversal potential Patches were usually 
stable for about 5 minutes before the noise level increased and during this time current traces were 
collected Figure 1 panels A C and D show examples of the obtained traces containing well-resolved 
channel openings

traces at RP  10 mV and 1 trace for each of the other 6 voltages Black line straight line fit yielding 
a slope conductance of 460  15 pS and a reversal potential of RP  73 mV The red lines indicate

same reversal potential as the straight line fit to the experimental data black line On the basis of the 
slope conductance this channel was identified as a high-conductance NMDAR F IV plot for the 
channel from which openings are shown in panel C Black squares measured single channel currents

mV Red and green lines as for D The observed slope conductance falls into the range for low-
conductance NMDARs 
In analysis for each patch the available current traces were searched for single-channel openings 
The single-channel currents were measured by visually-guided cursor selection fig 1 A and C red 
crosses and collected in current-voltage IV plots fig 1 E F Criteria to attribute openings in 
different traces to the same type of channel were 1 a consistent I-V relationship of the openings 2 
proximity in time of the traces in which the openings were observed and 3 similar further kinetic 
characteristics like typical opening time or burst duration Only when such openings were frequent 
enough to be observed at a wide range of test voltages was the channel further analyzed Slope 
conductance and reversal potential of the putative channels were calculated from the IV plots by 
straight-line fits fig 1 E F 
NMDA receptors were identified by their expected linear current-voltage relationship for the chosen 
range of test voltages a slope conductance between 14 pS and 45 pS and a reversal potential around 
0 mV Identification was also aided by factors like typical channel open durations of the order of 1-5 
ms Stern et al 1992 and Wyllie et al 1996 find mean open times between 06 and 3 ms for the 
different conductance levels of GluN2A B C and D receptors and the expected pattern of 
subconductance levels but these factors were not quantified 
Figure 1 A shows a current trace from a L23 cell in which only high-conductance NMDARs were 
observed and panel E shows the IV-curve corresponding to the channel openings seen in panel A 
Figure 1 C shows data from a L4 cell in which only low-conductance NMDARs could be seen and 
panel F shows the corresponding single-channel IV-curve In a number of patches both channel 
types were present Figure 1 D shows a trace where a high- and a low-conductance NMDAR are 
active simultaneously In about half of the patches with high-conductance NMDAR activity multiple 
high-conductance openings could be observed see fig 1 A initial part of the trace while the 
remainder seemed to contain only a single high-conductance NMDAR 
The range of test voltages 30 mV around resting potential RP and the pipette solution glutamate 
or NMDA to activate NMDARs AMPA and kainate receptors blocked by CNQX were intended to 
make sure that mostly NMDA receptors are the only channels active These voltages are too 
hyperpolarized for recruitment of typical potassium channels in addition potassium channels would 
be distinguishable by producing an outward current whereas NMDAR currents are inward Sodium 
channels should either not activate or deactivate soon after the beginning of a depolarizing voltage 
step The activity of chloride or calcium channels would still be possible but can be distinguished by 
their different reversal potentials As a control 3 patches were measured without glutamate and 
CNQX in the pipette None of those patches showed any channel activity These considerations lead 
to the conclusion that the observed channel activity was due to NMDA receptors 
NMDAR subtypes in barrel cortex 
To validate the cursor-by-eye method to measure single NMDAR channel currents fig 1 A C a 
more formal method based on amplitude histograms fig 1 B was used for comparison In two 
example traces all-point amplitude histograms see Sakmann and Neher 1995 p 527f were 
computed see methods Gaussian functions were fitted to the histogram peaks yielding center 
values for the peaks and hence measurements of the single-channel current The values obtained like 
this were in agreement with the cursor-by-eye values at an accuracy of 01 pA 
32  Overall patch statistics 
Patches from L23 and L4 cells were obtained and sorted into four categories according to whether 
no channels only high-conductance NMDARs only low-conductance NMDARs or both high- and 
low-conductance NMDARs could be identified in the patch Most data were obtained at a pipette 
glutamate concentration of 100 nM see table 1 Figure 2 shows the data as percentages of patches 
with high- or low-conductance NMDAR activity For example of the 23 patches from L23 cells 6 
contained lc NMDARs ie 26 fig 2 A right bar 10 of the 23 patches ie 43 contained either 
high- or low-conductance NMDARs fig 2 A dashed line Looking only at the patches with 
NMDAR activity both in L23 and in L4 cells all patches contained high-conductance NMDARs 
fig 2 A and B left bars Low-conductance NMDARs were found in 8989 of active L4 patches 
but only in 61060 of active L23 patches fig 2 C However this difference was not statistically 
significant chi-squared test 1 dof 2204 p15

Discussion 
NMDAR subtypes in barrel cortex 
NMDARs were studied in L4 spiny stellate and L23 pyramidal neurons of barrel cortex with cell-
attached patch-clamp single-channel recordings and NMDAR subtypes were distinguished by their 
single channel conductance In both cell types high-conductance NMDARs eg GluN2A or 
GluN2BRs as well as low-conductance NMDARs eg GluN2C or GluN2DRs were found 
41  NMDARs in subcellular compartments of neurons 
NMDAR recordings were obtained from somatic membrane therefore the relationship to the 
NMDAR subtypes expressed at the presynapse postsynapse and in the dendrites is only indirect 
Pyramidal and spiny stellate cells generally do not receive excitatory synapses at the soma but spines 
are limited to the dendrites while the soma is targeted by inhibitory synapses Hence the NMDARs 
observed are unlikely to be of direct synaptic origin NMDARs are synthesized in the somatic 
endoplasmic reticulum and trafficked along the dendrites to synaptic sites where many NMDARs are 
not fixed but move between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites diffusing along the membrane Groc et 
al 2009 Bard and Groc 2011 From this dynamic picture of receptor localization Choquet and 
Triller 2013 if a cell expresses a certain NMDAR subtype in considerable quantity one should be 
able to detect at least a small density at the soma as well 
42  Synaptic plasticity in barrel cortex 
Pharmacological studies of spike-timing dependent plasticity t-LTP and t-LTD at the L4-L23 
synapse and the L23-L23 synapse Rodriguez-Moreno and Paulsen 2008 Banerjee et al 2009 
Rodriguez-Moreno et al 2010 Banerjee et al 2014 suggest that L4 spiny stellate neurons express 
low-conductance GluN2C- or GluN2D-containing NMDARs but L23 pyramidal neurons express 
high-conductance GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs Therefore the question arose 
whether these NMDAR subtypes can also be found electrophysiologically in the respective cell 
types This could be confirmed although high-conductance NMDARs were also found in L4 cells 
and low-conductance NMDARs also in L23 cells providing some complementary corroboration for 
the suggested plasticity mechanisms 
43  NMDARs in L4 spiny stellate neurons 
In L4 spiny stellate cells both high- and low-conductance NMDARs were observed which is in 
agreement with Binshtok et al 2006 although the present data suggest a rather higher density of 
high-conductance NMDARs Out of 9 patches with channel activity at 100 nM glutamate 8 
contained both high- and low-conductance NMDARs and 1 contained only high-conductance 
NMDARs table 1 figure 2 whereas Binshtok et al report 11 patches with only low-conductance 
NMDARs and 4 patches with both low- and high-conductance NMDARs out of 15 patches showing 
channel activity In the present study at lower glutamate concentrations the distribution appeared to 
shift in favor of low-conductance NMDARs table 2 figure 3 indicating a possible agonist 
concentration effect 
The data are compatible with GluN2C-containing NMDARs at the postsynapse of connections 
between L4 spiny stellate neurons as well as at extrasynaptic sites Binshtok et al 2006 but also 
highlight the presence of high-conductance NMDARs in these cells The thalamocortical synapses to 
L4 spiny stellate neurons are thought to have postsynaptic GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing 
NMDARs Lu et al 2001 Barth and Malenka 2001 and spontaneous miniature EPSCs in L4 spiny 
NMDAR subtypes in barrel cortex 
stellate cells in thalamocortical slices have an NMDAR component which was found to be consistent 
with canonical GluN2A or GluN2B receptors Espinosa and Kavalali 2009 
44  NMDARs in L23 pyramidal neurons 
In L23 pyramidal neurons of barrel cortex likewise both high- and low-conductance NMDARs were 
found To our knowledge there are no previous reports of electrophysiological evidence for low-
conductance NMDARs in this cell type Generally their presence in cortical excitatory neurons is 
unusual histological expression study by Monyer et al 1994 and contrasts for example with L5 
pyramidal neurons of barrel cortex where only high-conductance NMDARs could be found 
Binshtok et al 2006 However this is consistent with histological data reported by Binshtok et al 
where expression of GluN2C was seen not only in L4 but also in L23 but no expression was seen in 
L5 pyramidal neurons 
Functional consequences of GluN2C-containing receptors have been discussed in L4 spiny stellate 
neurons At synapses between these cells the slow deactivation of GluN2C receptors and the 
resulting slow EPSC time-course would lead to strong and broad integration of inputs rather than 
sharp coincidence detection Hence the initial processing of sensory whisker input would be based 
on recurrent excitation amplification and distribution of activity within the barrel Feldmeyer et al 
1999 Fleidervish et al 1998 Binshtok et al 2006 Excessive GluN2C expression in L4 spiny 
stellate cells and in L23 pyramidal neurons has been linked to seizure generation in a mouse model 
of epilepsy Lozovaya et al 2014 Extrasynaptically the lower sensitivity of GluN2C receptors to 
block by Mg2 and their higher glutamate sensitivity make them suitable to detect even low levels of 
ambient glutamate even when the membrane potential is near rest leading to changes of the resting 
potential and hence a modulation of neuronal excitability Binshtok et al 2006 The results of this 
study on low-conductance NMDARs being also present in L23 pyramidal neurons suggest that 
similar mechanisms may operate in these cells as well 
45  Dendritic NMDA spikes 
Dendritic NMDA spikes have been reported in L4 spiny stellate neurons of barrel cortex Lavzin et 
al 2012 and in L23 pyramidal neurons of visual cortex Smith et al 2013 and somatosensory 
cortex Palmer et al 2014 Unlike in L5 pyramidal neurons where GluN2A-containing receptors 
are thought to underlie dendritic NMDA spikes Polsky et al 2009 in L4 spiny stellate neurons 
blocker experiments suggest that the current flows mainly through low-conductance NMDARs 
Lavzin et al 2012 One may suspect that the subtype-specific NMDAR kinetics influence the 
NMDA spike shape but the spike duration appears similar in L5 pyramidal neurons Schiller et al 
2000 and L4 spiny stellate neurons Lavzin et al 2012 so the NMDA spike shutdown may not be 
governed by NMDA receptor deactivation but by other conductances for example repolarizing K 
channels Still the low Mg2 block sensitivity and high glutamate sensitivity of low-conductance 
NMDARs may lead to a lower threshold for NMDA spike generation The present 
electrophysiological results suggest that a mixture of high- and low-conductance NMDARs underlies 
dendritic NMDA spikes both in L4 spiny stellate and in L23 pyramidal neurons of barrel cortex 
In summary the results provide complementary electrophysiological evidence for proposed synaptic 
plasticity mechanisms in barrel cortex The data are consistent with a prominent role of low-
conductance NMDARs in L4 spiny stellate cells but high-conductance NMDARs were equally 
present Likewise L23 pyramidal neurons of barrel cortex contained both high- and low-
conductance NMDARs suggesting that the mechanism of broad integration amplification and

NMDAR subtypes in barrel cortex 
distribution of excitation in response to sensory whisker input may apply not only to L4 but also to 
L23 neurons The NMDAR subtype mix of high- and low-conductance NMDARs in the two cell 
types may be relevant to threshold properties of dendritic NMDA spikes
