Abstract Blackbody radiation contains on average an entropy of 3925 bits per
photon This applies not only to the proverbial case of burning a lump of coal but
also to the Hawking radiation from both analogue black holes and general relativistic
black holes The ip side of this observation is the information budget If the emission
process is unitary as it certainly is for normal physicalchemical burning and also
for the Hawking emission from analogue black holes then this entropy is exactly com-
pensated by the hidden information in the correlations We shall now extend this
argument to the Hawking radiation from general relativistic black holes where pre-
vious discussion is both heated and inconclusive demonstrating that the assumption
of unitarity leads to a perfectly reasonable entropyinformation budget without any
hint of a rewall The assumption of unitarity instead has a dierent implication 
the horizon if present cannot be an event horizon it must be an apparenttrapping
horizon or some variant thereof The key technical aspect of our calculation is the
average subsystem approach but applied to a tripartite pure system consisting of

Introduction
The information puzzle 117 nominally associated with the Hawking evaporation
of general relativistic black holes continues to provoke much heated discussion and
debate On the other hand there simply is no information puzzle associated with
chemical burning 18 nor with the Hawking radiation from analogue black holes 19
40 where all the physics is manifestly unitary And horizons if present at all are
apparenttrapping horizons and denitely not event horizons 4143 In a previous
article 18 we have carefully analyzed the blackbody radiation from a blackbody
furnace while in the current article we focus on Hawking radiation from both analogue
and general relativistic black holes We shall argue notwithstanding many claims to the
contrary that assuming unitarity and complete evaporation the Hawking evaporation
process is relatively benign no worse than burning a lump of coal
2 Entropyinformation in blackbody radiation
When burning a lump of coal or an encyclopaedia for that matter in a blackbody
furnace the resulting blackbody radiation carries on average an entropyinformation
content of 18
with a standard deviation of 18

Here and subsequently we will use S to denote physical entropy S  SkB for the
dimensionless entropy measured in natural units nats and S2  S ln 2 for the
dimensionless entropy measured in bits 44 45
This entropyinformation burden is compactly summarized as 3925 bitsphoton
Ultimately these results really only depend on the Planckian spectrum of blackbody
radiation coupled with the most elementary features of the Clausius entropy dS 
dQT  where dQ    is simply the energy that each individual photon transfers from
the source to the outgoing radiation eld If the spectrum is not exactly Planckian
then one must resort to the more general but still quite useful result

3 Hawking evaporation of an analogue black hole
Analogue black holes 1928 are particularly important because they currently provide
the only experimental evidence for the reality of Hawking radiation 2935 Indeed the
experimental evidence based on both surface waves encountering a blocking horizon
and BEC phonons encountering acoustic horizons is now close to conclusive 2935
Another experiment involving photons excited by an optical soliton propagating in
glass is also highly suggestive but perhaps less conclusive 3640
There is clear evidence that in these analogue situations at least the Hawking ux
is denitely unitary and that the relevant blockingacoustic horizons are some form of
apparenttrapping horizons they are certainly not event horizons so the key features
of the analysis presented in reference 18 fully applies The individual Hawking quanta
simply deliver a thermodynamic entropy S   T to the radiation eld this is a
coarse-graining entropy which is exactly compensated by information hidden in the
correlations between the Hawking quanta 18 The only slightly messy feature of the
physics is that the greybody factors for analogue black holes are no longer given by the
usual ReggeWheeler equation but can depend on the experimental setup in a much
more complicated manner So in view of possibly large deviations from a pure Planck
spectrum equation 23 is more relevant than equation 22 nevertheless we would
expect qualitatively similar behaviour
The importance of this observation cannot be over-emphasized In the only physical
situations where we have any experimental evidence for the reality of the Hawking
evaporation process we also have quite standard unitary preserving quantum physics
and we have absolutely no reason to believe that there is any information puzzle
involved Therefore if there is any information puzzle for general relativity black
holes it is not the Hawking radiation per se that is the central issue  the issues lie
elsewhere presumably in the semiclassical dynamics of horizons in general relativistic
black holes
4 Hawking evaporation of a general relativity black hole
In counterpoint what now is dierent for general relativistic black holes It is the
assumed existence of event horizons as opposed to apparenttrapping horizons that
is now key Note that the mere existence of Hawking radiation per se is not the central
issue in the information puzzle since Hawking radiation in analogue black holes is
perfectly well behaved
It is instead the assumption that general relativistic event
horizons which certainly do exist in the classical limit continue to survive in the
semiclassical quantum realm that is the source of the potential diculties
 3 
The genesis of the information puzzle can be traced back to Hawkings 1976
article 1 where he introduced the concept of hidden surface which was to be under-
stood as a synonym for absolute causal horizon That is slightly more general than
an event horizon Hidden surfaces include event horizons plus other oddities such as
baby universes and in a more modern language would potentially even include chrono-
logical horizons It should be noted that subsequently Hawking has twice abjured the
existence of semiclassical event horizons Initially he did so at the Dublin meeting in
2004 46
The way the information gets out seems to be that a true event horizon
never forms just an apparent horizon
More recently in 2014 Hawking asserted 47
The absence of event horizons means that there are no black holes  in
the sense of regimes from which light cant escape to innity There are
however apparent horizons which persist for a period of time
Even more recently in 2015 Hawking has argued for the relevance of super-translations
of the horizon as a mechanism for encoding correlations 48 For current purposes we
shall mostly be interested in the event horizon versus apparenttrapping horizon dis-
tinction 49 in a semiclassical setting with a view to tracking the entropyinformation
ux with a minimum of technical fuss It cannot be suciently emphasized that event
horizons are simply not physically observable in any nite size laboratory whereas
apparenttrapping horizons certainly are physically observable 49 Furthermore even
in a general relativity context event horizons are simply not essential for generating a
Hawking-like ux 5052
41 Thermodynamic entropy in the Hawking ux from a GR black hole
When considering the Hawking evaporation of a general relativistic black hole we shall
argue that perhaps unexpectedly the thermodynamic entropy uxes stay exactly the
same as for burning a lump of coal or for the case of an analogue black hole The
quantum entanglement entropy uxes might in principle dier depending on unitary
evolution versus non-unitary evolution that is essentially what all the arguing is about
To hopefully clarify the issues involved we shall compare and contrast the behaviour
of the classical thermodynamic Clausius entropy with the quantum entanglement
von Neumann entropy of suitably dened subsystems

411 Loss of Bekenstein entropy of the GR black hole
Let us rst estimate the Bekenstein entropy loss of the black hole per emitted quanta
We assume for simplicity an exact Planck spectrum at the Hawking temperature
this being a good zeroth-order approximation to the actual physics 53 54 For a
Schwarzschild black hole we have

where so far we have only used the denition of Bekenstein entropy and the conservation
of energy Thus for a Planck spectrum 18

This then simplies to
30 3
4rHc2 
This is Bekenstein entropy loss of the black hole per emitted massless boson
412 Gain of thermodynamic entropy of the radiation eld
Let us now contrast this with the thermodynamic entropy gain Clausius entropy gain
of the external radiation eld per emitted quanta We have
cid104cid105 dN
cid104cid105
30 3

SM  cid82 M
This is thermodynamic entropy gain of the Hawking ux These two simple calculations
agree as of course they must After all running this same argument in reverse by using
0 d M TH M  was how the Bekenstein entropy was originally quantied
The Hawking radiation is essentially adiabatically transferring Bekenstein entropy
from the black hole into Clausius entropy of the radiation eld

Notice that there are no signicant qualications or limitations to this result  if
Hawking radiation occurs and is approximately thermal then each emitted massless
bosonic quanta transfers approximately 3896976153 bits of Bekenstein entropy from
the black hole to the Clausius entropy of the Hawking ux Indeed throughout the
evaporation process in terms of the initial Bekenstein entropy SBekenstein0 we have
SBekensteint  SClausiust  SBekenstein0
See gure 6 for a graphical summary of this result We shall soon see that a very closely
related statement can be made for the quantum von Neumann entropy of suitably
dened subsystems of the universe
Figure 1 Clausius thermodynamic entropy balance
As the black hole Bekenstein entropy dened in terms of the area of the horizon decreases
the Clausius entropy of the radiation increases to keep total entropy constant and equal to
the initial Bekenstein entropy

So semi-classically everything holds together very well the total number of massless
quanta emitted over the life of the black hole is comparable to the initial dimensionless
Bekenstein entropy
43 Entanglement entropy in the Hawking ux from GR black holes
Now we come to the heart of the matter  how do these essentially classicalsemi-
classical and purely thermodynamic entropy arguments match with quantum entropy
arguments based on the von Neumann entropy S  tr ln  At a minimum to
preserve unitarity then over the lifetime of the black hole we will have to encode
approximately 39  25 bits per photon of hidden information into the Hawking ux
But can we implement this purication process continuously or is it all hidden
in a non-perturbative burst of information atnear total evaporation Or after the
so-called Page time When the black hole entropy has dropped to half its initial
value 55
Is purication a steady process or is it limited to late times We
shall argue assuming unitarity complete evaporation and the average subsystem
argument that the purication process is continuous and ongoing
 7 
431 Entanglement Subsystem entropies
In reference 56 Page established a number of interesting results regarding average
subsystem entropies The basic idea is this Consider a Hilbert space that factorizes
HAB  HA  HB and on that Hilbert space consider a pure state AB  cid105cid104
Now dene subsystem density matrices via the partial traces A  trBcid105cid104 and
B  trAcid105cid104 Then the subsystem von Neumann entanglement entropies SA 
trA ln A and SB  trB ln B satisfy
SA  SB  ln mindimHA dimHB
This particular equality and inequality hold before any averaging is enforced Page then
considered the eect of taking a uniform average over all pure states on HAB Taking
n1  dimHA and n2  dimHB with m  minn1 n2 and M  maxn1 n2 he
dened the equivalent of
Sn1n2  cid104 SAcid105  cid104 SBcid105  ln m
The central result of reference 56 is that the average subsystem entropy is extremely
close to its maximum possible value So that the average subsystem is eectively
very close to being maximally mixed When combined with the exact result derived
by Sen in reference 57 where he provided a formal analytic proof of an exact result
conjectured by Page and the discussion of Appendix A this can be strengthened to a
strict bound
Sn1n2  cid104 SAcid105  cid104 SBcid105 cid0ln m  1
2 ln mcid1 
So the average subsystem entropy is within 1
4 of a bit of its
maximum possible value Even stronger statements can be made but this is more than
sucient for current purposes

432 Bipartite entanglement GR black hole  Hawking radiation
In reference 55 Page applies the average subsystem formalism to the bipartite system
consisting of general relativity black holeHawking radiation and nothing else
This is essentially a closed box argument but we shall soon see that we need an
environment to better understand the physics In the bipartite HR system initially
there is not yet any Hawking radiation so HHawking radiation  HR is trivial so it is 1-
dimensional while Hblack hole  HH is enormous But it is the minimum dimensionality
that dominates the average subsystem entropy and so
 SnHnR0  0
 8 
We shall use a subscript 0 to denote time zero t  0 Likewise a subscript  will
denote time innity t   Sometimes when from context it is safe to do so we will
suppress explicit occurrences of the argument t for intermediate times After the black
hole has by assumption completely evaporated it is Hblack hole  HH that is trivial
1-dimensional and so
 SnHnR  0
At intermediate times both HH and HR are nontrivial dimensionality greater than
unity so the average subsystem entropy is non-zero This is enough to guarantee the
basic symmetric sawtooth shape of the so-called Page curve the subsystem entropy
rises from zero to some maximum and then descends back to zero See gure 2 for
details
Figure 2 Page curve for bipartite entanglement entropy
Under the average subsystem assumption applied to a pure-state bipartite system consisting
of black hole plus Hawking radiation the entanglement entropy rises from zero to one half
the initial Bekenstein entropy before dropping back to zero We argue that this model misses
much of the relevant physics
Since the evolution is assumed unitary the dimensionality of the total Hilbert space
is constant so
nHt nRt  nH0  nR
On the other hand combining this with the argument of the previous subsection the
subsystem entropy is always within 1

It is the symmetric sawtooth shape of the Page curve see gure 2 that underlies
much of the modern discussion surrounding the information puzzle and in particular
the asserted and much debated existence of rewalls 29 But is there some way of
evading the current argument
One particularly disturbing feature of the current argument is that the subsystem
entropy is initially zero because there is not yet any Hawking radiation for the black
hole to be entangled with But this observation is in marked tension with the fact
that the Bekenstein entropy of the black hole is initially enormous and this Bekenstein
entropy is ususally attributed to some form of entanglement entropy So if as in
this bipartite model the black hole cannot be entangled with the as yet nonexistent
Hawking radiation it must be entangled with something else  the rest of the universe
But then the bipartite general relativity black holeHawking radiation system is
not in a pure state and Pages subsystem argument cannot be applied at least not as
it currently stands We shall instead argue that it is more appropriate to consider a
tripartite system
general relativity black hole  Hawking radiation  rest of universe
and that the average subsystem entropy argument applied to this pure state tripartite
system yields much more acceptable and hopefully noncontroversial physics
433 Bipartite entanglement Asymmetric subsystem information
In reference 55 Page denes a novel asymmetric version of subsystem information
whereas the subsystem information of reference 56 is symmetric see Appendix B
In1n2  ln n1  Sn1n2
In2n1  ln n2  Sn1n2
This denition of asymmetric subsystem information is not entirely standard and we
shall see that its physical interpretation is not entirely clear Then approximately to
within 1

This quickly leads to the subsystem information version of the Page curve see gure 3
for details
Figure 3 Page curve for asymmetric subsystem information
Under the average subsystem assumption applied to a pure-state bipartite system consisting
of black hole plus Hawking radiation the asymmetric subsystem information exhibits
kinked behaviour We argue that this model misses much of the relevant physics
If one only considers the bipartite system of black hole and Hawking radiation
ignoring the rest of the universe then assuming the black hole is initially in some
unknown pure state the asymmetric subsystem information exhibits odd features as
sketched in gure 3 The asymmetric subsystem information attributed to the black
hole descends from a value equal to the original Bekenstein entropy to approximately
zero at the Page time and subsequently remains approximately zero The asymmetric
subsystem information attributed to the Hawking radiation remains approximately
zero from time zero up to the Page time and then climbs to up to the original value
of Bekenstein entropy By construction this bipartite system satises the sum rule
cid104 IHRcid105  cid104 IRHcid105  2cid104 SHcid105  SBekenstein0
See gure 4 for details
Nevertheless this bipartite model has some odd features The entropy of the black
hole at time zero is zero because it is assumed to be in an unknown pure state In
this model the Bekenstein entropy is never the entropy of the black hole it is instead
the maximum entropy that the black hole could have had given the size of the Hilbert
space used to describe the bipartite HR system The hole subsystem information in
this model does not have a direct physical interpretation  is the defect between the

Note that the sum rule cid104 IHRcid105  cid104 IRHcid105  2cid104 SHcid105  SBekenstein0 is satised Nevertheless we
argue that this model misses much of the relevant physics
maximum entropy that the black hole could have had given the time dependent size of
the black hole Hilbert space and the entanglement entropy In counterpoint we argue
that a tripartite analysis including black hole Hawking radiation and the rest of the
universe the environment is a more useful approach
434 Bipartite entanglement Mutual information
It should be emphasized that mutual information is certainly not the same as what Page
calls the subsystem information See Appendices B and C and references 55 56 for
details In general one has
IAB  SA  SB  SAB
For the bipartite HR system considered by Page where HR is in a pure state one has

GR black hole  Hawking radiation  rest of universe
Let us consider the tripartite system
general relativity black hole  Hawking radiation  rest of universe
modelled by the Hilbert space H  Hblack hole  HHawking radiation  Hrest of universe
For compactness write this as HHRE  HH  HR  HE with subscripts denoting hole
radiation and environment Let us rst see how far we can get without making any
averaging assumptions Take the entire universe be in a pure state so at all times
SHREt  0 and the subsystem entropies satisfy
SHt  SREt
SRt  SHEt
SEt  SHRt
At time zero the Hawking radiation has not yet had a chance to be emitted so at that
stage HHawking radiation0  HH0 is trivial 1-dimensional We shall again use a subscript
0 to denote time zero t  0 before evaporation starts Likewise a subscript  will
denote time innity t   by which stage the black hole has completely evaporated
Once the black hole has by assumption completely evaporated then it is Hblack hole 
HH that is trivial 1-dimensional Then
SR0  0  SHE0
SH0  SE0
SH  0  SRE
SR  SE
But because the evolution is assumed unitary at all times the total dimensionality of
the Hilbert space must be xed
nHt nRt nEt  nH0 nE0  nR nE
Now the role of the environment E the rest of universe is simply to give the HR
subsystem black holeHawking radiation something to be entangled with  the
environment does not itself directly participate in the Hawking evaporation process
 so the unitary time evolution operator factorizes as UHREt  UHRt  UEt
Therefore
nE0  nEt  nE  nE
and also
nHt nRt  nH0  nR
 14 
That is during the evaporation process the dimensionality of the black hole Hilbert
space is being transferred to the Hawking radiation Hilbert space So far we have not
invoked any averaging assumption
To quantify things we now make an additional assumption That the Bekenstein
entropy can be identied with the average entanglement entropy In dimensionless units
at time zero we have
SBekenstein0  cid104 SH0cid105  ln minnH0 nE
to within 1
the black hole not on its environment so we must have
2 nat But the Bekenstein entropy depends only on intrinsic properties of
minnH0 nE  nH0
nH0  nE
Subsequently at later times we would still assert
SBekensteint  cid104 SHtcid105  ln minnHt nRt nE
to within 1
2 nat But now note
nHt  nH0  nE  nRt nE
Therefore as one would expect
SBekensteint  cid104 SHtcid105  ln nHt
throughout the entire evolution
Conversely for the average entanglement entropy of the radiation with the HE
subsystem we have
cid104 SRtcid105  ln minnRt nHt nE
Therefore
nRt  nRtnHt  nH0  nE  nHt nE
cid104 SRtcid105  ln nRt
throughout the entire evolution
Combining these two results
cid104 SHtcid105  cid104 SRtcid105  ln nHt  ln nRt  lnnHt nRt  ln nH0
 15 
Here the approximation is valid to within at worst 1 nat In view of earlier assumptions
we can rephrase this to within 1 nat as
SBekensteint  cid104 SHawking radiationtcid105  SBekenstein0
This now is the quantum von Neumann entropy version of the result we previously
obtained using classical Clausius entropy arguments Compare with equation 47
Note the only signicant change is that the equality now holds only to within 1 nat
Figure 6 Tripartite quantum von Neumann entropy balance
Under the average subsystem assumption now applied to a pure-state tripartite system
consisting of black hole plus Hawking radiation plus rest of universe the quantum
von Neumann analysis reproduces the Clausius thermodynamic analysis As the black hole
Bekenstein entropy now interpreted as entanglement entropy decreases the entanglement
entropy of the radiation increases to keep total entropy approximately constant at least to
within 1 nat In the limit where the environment rest of universe becomes arbitrarily large
the correspondence is exact

That is cid104 SEtcid105 is not the total entropy of the rest of the universe it is merely the
extent to which the rest of the universe is entangled with the black hole  Hawking
radiation subsystem which in turn is equal to the initial Bekenstein entropy of the
black hole before the black hole starts evaporating While cid104 SEtcid105 is by construction
xed and time independent the fact of its existence is nevertheless crucial to a deeper
understanding of entropy uxes
437 Tripartite entanglement Mutual information
For the tripartite HRE system we are advocating here the situation is more interesting
than for the bipartite HR system For the tripartite system SHR  SE and SH cid54 SR
in general so
IHR  SH  SR  SHR  SH  SR  SE
Now averaging over the pure states in HRE and working with dimensionless entropies
we have at all times the argument t is suppressed for clarity
cid104 IHRcid105  SnHnRnE  SnRnHnE  SnEnHnR
nR  nHnE
So in dimensionless units we have the exact result
nH  nRnE
cid20
cid21
HnHnRnE  HnRnE  nH  1
cid20
HnHnRnE  HnE  nHnR  1
cid21
cid104 IHRcid105 
nHnR  nE
HnHnRnE  HnHnE  nR  1
cid21
cid20
Then after a little simplication
cid104 IHRcid105  HnHnRnE  HnE  HnRnE  HnHnE 
nH  1nR  1nHnR  nH  nR
2nHnRnE
It is now relatively easy to see details relegated to Appendix C that
cid104 IHRcid105  nHnR
So the average mutual information between H and R in the tripartite BRE system
never exceeds 1
2 nat throughout the entire evaporation process
 17 
438 Tripartite entanglement Innite-dimensional environment
For the bipartite HR system the whole point is to keep the total dimensionality xed
For the tripartite HRE system however the environment E the rest of universe is used
to initially entangle the black hole with the rest of the universe but then largely comes
along for the ride There is no real loss of generality in taking the limit nE   This
is not making any assumptions concerning the actual thermodynamic entropy of the
rest of the universe it is a much milder statement that the rest of the universe could
in principle have an arbitrarily high dimensional Hilbert space Under these conditions
details relegated to Appendix D we have at all times the following limits
nEcid104 SHcid105  ln nH
nEcid104 SRcid105  ln nR
nEcid104 SEcid105  lnnHnR  ln nH0
cid16cid104SHcid105  cid104SRcid105cid17
In this limit we therefore have the equality
nE
nEcid104SEcid105
an equality which in this limit reproduces the classical thermodynamic arguments
balancing Bekenstein entropy versus Clausius entropy that we started with An
immediate consequence of this result is
nEcid104IHRcid105  0
That is for an innite dimensional environment the mutual information between the
subsystems H and R in a pure-state HRE system is zero The fact that things simplify so
nicely for an innite dimensional environment should perhaps not be all that surprising
in view of the fact that even in purely classical thermodynamics an innite volume
limit innite degrees of freedom is necessary for the existence of phase transitions In
counterpoint an innite dimensional environment is also necessary if for some reason
one wishes to drive the Shannon entropy to innity 59

5 Discussion
So what is the relevance of these computations
Since we know that there is no
information puzzle in burning a lump of coal 18 or in the Hawking emission from
analogue black holes 1940 we use this as a starting point to understand what happens
in a general relativistic black hole system In the two situations where we have good
understanding of the relevant physics the key feature seems to be that there are no
event horizons absolute horizons a situation that increasingly seems to be the case for
general relativistic black holes Apparenttrapping horizons and their variants are not
problematic when it comes to the information puzzle See for instance references 14
16 4648 5052 and many other sources
First we explicitly calculated the classical thermodynamic Clausius entropy and
the Bekenstein entropy We found that they compensate perfectly summing to the
initial Bekenstein entropy of the hole As of course they must given how Bekenstein
entropy was originally dened Once we had the classical behaviour under control
we proceeded with a quantum entropy argument based on the von Neumann entropy
realizing that on average we need to encode 39  25 bits of information per emitted
quantum to preserve unitarity We found a way to calculate this quantum entropy by
means of a tripartite system with results that completely agree with the classically
expected results to within 1 nat Physically it could be said that although when we
restrict attention to a particular subsystem we perceive an amount of entanglement
entropy a loss of information there exists a complementary amount of entropy that
is codied in the correlations between the subsystems
Assuming unitarity of the evolution of the black hole  Hawking radiation
subsystem we showed that as long as it is suitably embedded in a tripartite system
providing an environment to entangle with there are no weird physical eects That
consideration of the rest of the universe is necessary for making sensible statements
about unitarity has also been argued in a dierent context in reference 62 63
In contrast the results previously obtained by Page correspond to the choice of a
closed box model which never interacts with or even notices the rest of the uni-
verse In that model the consideration of a simplied bipartite system gives rise to
non well-understood physics such as a zero initial Bekenstein entropy and an odd en-
tropyinformation balance that is part of the motivation for rewalls 29 On the
contrary in our system the purication process can occur continuously We also show
that in the limit of innite dimension of the environment there is no loss of generality
in our argument It is interesting to note that in this case the sum rule connecting
subsystem information with the initial Bekenstein entropy holds exactly This result
can be related with the fact that in classical thermodynamics we need an innite volume
limit for the existence of phase transitions
 19 
In summary we have seen that assuming unitarity  complete evaporation  the
subsystem argument when properly applied to a suitable tripartite system implies
continuous purication of the Hawking radiation Specically the mutual information
between the black hole and the Hawking radiation when properly interpreted as part
of a tripartite system entangled with an environment the rest of the universe never
exceeds 1
2 nat Overall this leads to noncontroversial and relatively boring physics 
quite similar to burning a lump of coal 18  one obtains a simple cascade of Hawking
quanta 53 58

A Bound on bipartite subsystem entropy
Page conjectured 56 and Sen proved 57 under certain technical assumptions and
with minor change of their notation that when measured in nats the average dimen-
sionless entropy of a subsystem is given by
Sn1n2  cid104 SAcid105  cid104 SBcid105  HmM  HM  m  1
m  minn1 n2
M  maxn1 n2
and Hn is the nth harmonic number 60 For example
S1n  0
S2n  H2n1  Hn
S3n  H3n  Hn  1
arise in many situations where one is extremizing the Shannon entropy cid80
nite-space models for Zipfs law where pi  1iHn andcid80n
That the harmonic numbers show up here should perhaps not be so surprising  they
i pi ln pi
subject to external constraints  for example the harmonic numbers also show up in
i1 pi  1 61 For some
purposes such as the discussion in this article simple bounds are more useful than
more complex exact results For instance
Theorem
Sn1n2  ln m  mM 
mM cid0 m
2M  m1

Page says something somewhat similar in reference 56 but only as an estimate this
is now a rigorous bound
 20

cid18
cid19
Corollary In particular
Sn1n2 cid0ln m  1
That is the average subsystem entropy is always within half nat of the maximum
possible value it can take
Proof To establish this we note the standard mathematical result 60
Hn    ln n  n
2n  1
In addition we know that n tends monotonically to zero We now write
Sn1n2  ln m  mM 
mM  mM  M  m  1
Now since n is monotonically decreasing we certainly have
mM  M  m  1
 m  1
But we also have an absolute lower bound
mM M  m  1
2mM  1
 m  1
That is
Sn1n2  ln m  mM 
This is the result we were seeking
2mM  1

B Bound on bipartite subsystem information
In terms of the symmetric average subsystem information as dened by Page in
reference 56 we have
In1n2  Smaxn1n2  Sn1n2
 ln m  Sn1n2
 mM 
We then have the rigorous bounds
In1n2 cid0 m1
cid1 cid00 1
cid1 
That is the average subsystem information is always less than 1
2 ln 2  3
of a bit This symmetric denition of average subsystem information leads to very
tight bounds
2 nat less than 1
 21 
In contrast in reference 55 Page redenes the average subsystem information in
an asymmetrical manner
In1n2  Smaxn1  Sn1n2  ln n1  Sn1n2  lnn1m  In1n2
In2n1  Smaxn2  Sn1n2  ln n2  Sn1n2  lnn2m  In1n2
cid16 In1n2  In2n1
cid17
In1n2  In2n1  lnn1n2
In1n2 
 lnM   In1n2
We note that the average In1n2  ln M is symmetric and since In1n2  0 1
2 it is
utterly dominated by the dimensionality of the larger Hilbert space In view of the
very tight bound on In1n2 this means that to within 1
2 nat for all practical purposes

cid16n1
cid16n2

In1n2  ln

That is the modied average subsystem information In1n2 cid54 In2n1 really says nothing
much about the subsystem beyond specifying the dimensionalities of the two Hilbert
sub-spaces See gure 3 for details
minn1 n2
C Bound on tripartite mutual information
As noted in the main text above the mutual information is really only interesting in
the tripartite BHE system
Theorem
We start from
and again use
cid104 IHRcid105  nHnR
cid104 IHRcid105  HnHnRnE  HnE  HnRnE  HnHnE
nH  1nR  1nHnR  nH  nR
2nHnRnE
cid18
cid19
2n  1
Hn    ln n  n
 22 
Then the lns and s cancel and
cid104 IHRcid105  nHnRnE  nE  nRnE  nHnE 
nH  1nR  1nHnR  nH  nR
2nHnRnE
But then
That is
cid104 IHRcid105 
2nHnRnE
nH  1nR  1nHnR  nH  nR
2nHnRnE
cid104 IHRcid105  n2
R  n2
H  n2
2nHnRnE
R  nH  nR  1
We can rewrite this as
cid104 IHRcid105  n2
2nHnRnE
R  nH  nR  1
2nHnRnE
R  nH  nR  1
2nHnRnE
cid104 IHRcid105  nHnR
cid104 IHRcid105  nHnR
 nHnH  1  nRnR  1  1
2nHnRnE
that is
Now consider two cases
 If both nH  1 and nR  1 then nHnH  1  nRnR  1  1  0 and so
cid104 IHRcid105  nHnR
 If either one of m  minnH nR  1 which occurs at both time t  0 and time
t   then setting M  maxnH nR we have the exact result
cid104 IHRcid105  HM nE  HnE  HM nE  HnE  M M  1  M M  1
In either case we certainly have
cid104 IHRcid105  nHnR
So the average mutual information between H and R in the tripartite pure-state BRE
system is zero both initially and nally but never exceeds 1
2 nat throughout the entire
evaporation process
 23 
What can we say about cid104IHEcid105 and cid104IREcid105 the mutual information with the envi-
ronment We note that as long as HRE is a pure state we have even before averaging
IHE  SH  SE  SHE
IRE  SR  SE  SRE
Therefore
IHE  SH  SE  SR
But we already know that after averaging
IRE  SR  SE  SE
cid104 SHcid105  cid104 SRcid105  cid104 SEcid105
to within 1 nat so we see
cid104 IHEcid105  2cid104 SHcid105
cid104 IREcid105  2cid104 SRcid105
to within 1 nat So these particular mutual information scenarios do not yield any
extra useful insight
D Limits Bipartite and tripartite systems
We now consider some useful limits
Theorem
We note
M
Sn1n2  ln m
Sn1n2  HmM  HM  m  1
M
A standard mathematical result is
M HmM  HM  ln m
The claimed result is immediate
cid3
Corollaries This theorem is not particularly useful when applied to the bipartite HR
system since we want nHE  nH0 to be a constant When applied to the tripartite
HRE system however we can safely take the limit nE   without disturbing the HR
subsystem Consequently
nEcid104 SHcid105  ln nH
nEcid104 SRcid105  ln nR
nEcid104 SEcid105  lnnHnR  ln nH0
nEcid104 IHRcid105  0
This has the eect of reproducing classical physics in terms of the Clausius entropy
