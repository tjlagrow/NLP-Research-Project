1 Introduction
Since Stephen Hawking proved black holes could radiate thermally1 people
have attempt to provide several dierent methods to correctly derive Hawk-
ing temperatures of black holes In these modes a semi-classical tunnelling
one rst put forward by Kruas and Wilczek 2 and then formulated by vari-
ous researchers345 recently attracts many peoples attention 6 Here the
derivation of Hawking temperature mainly depends on the computation of
the imaginary part of the action for the classically forbidden process of s-wave
emission across the horizon Normally there are two approaches to obtain
the imaginary part of the action One rst used by Parikh and Wilczek3
and later broadly discussed by many papers6 is called as the Null Geodesic
Method where the contribution to the imaginary part of the action only comes
from the integration of the radial momentum pr for the emitted particles The
other method regards the action of the emitted particles satises the rela-
tivistic Hamilton-Jacobi equation and solving it yields the imaginary part of
the action4 which is an extension of the complex path analysis proposed by
Padmanabhan et al5
Since the tunnelling method has been successfully applied to deal with Hawk-
ing radiation of black holes a lot of work shows its validity6 But most of
them are focus on studying Hawking radiation of scalar particles tunnelling
from dierent-type black holes In fact a black hole can radiate all types of
particles and Hawking radiation contains contributions of both scalar par-
ticles and fermions with all spins Recently Kerner and Mann have stud-
ied Hawking radiation of spin 12 fermions for Rindler space-time and that
for the uncharged spherically symmetric black holes via quantum tunnelling
method7 The result shows that Hawking temperature can also be exactly
obtained by fermions tunnelling from black hole horizon In this paper we
improve Kerner and Manns method to deal with Hawking radiation of Dirac
particles via tunnelling from rotating black holes in de Sitter space specically
including that from Kerr de Sitter black hole and Kerr-Newman de Sitter black
hole The result shows that Hawking temperatures at the EH and the CH can
well be recovered Dirac particles via tunnelling from Kerr de Sitter black hole
and Kerr-Newman de Sitter black hole Subsequently this method appears in
many papers to discuss Hawking radiation from black holes8171819
Researches on black holes with a positive cosmological constant become im-
portant due to the following reasons iThe recent observed accelerating ex-
pansion of our universe indicates the cosmological constant might be a pos-
itive one 9 ii Conjecture about de Sitterconformal eld theory CFT
correspondence10 For black holes in de Sitter spaces particles can be cre-
ated at both the event horizon EH and the cosmological horizon CH where
however exists dierent tunnelling behaviors At the EH outgoing particles
tunnel from black hole horizon to form Hawking radiation and incoming par-
ticles can fall into the horizon along classically permitted trajectories At the
CH outgoing particles can fall classically out of the horizon and incoming
particles tunnel into the horizon to form Hawking radiation
The remainders of this paper are outlined as follows In Sec2 Hawking ra-
diation of Dirac particles from Kerr de Sitter black hole has been studied by
improving Kerner and Mans method and the temperatures at the event hori-
zonEH and that at the cosmological horizonCH are both well recovered
Sec3 takes Kerr-Newman de Sitter black hole as an example to once again
check the validity of fermions tunnelling model Sect4 ends up with some
discussions and conclusions
2 Dirac particles tunnelling from Kerr-de Sitter black hole
In this section we develop Kerner and Mans fermion tunnelling method to
study Hawking radiation of Dirac particles via tunnelling from rotating Kerr-
de Sitter black hole The metric of Kerr black hole in de Sitter spaces Kerr
de Sitter black hole is given by 11

Here a is rotational angular momentum parameter and l is a constant related
to the cosmological factor as   3l2 There are four roots for   0 and
the largest positive root rc corresponds to the cosmological horizonCH of
the black hole the minimal positive root ri denotes the Cauchy horizon of the
black hole the intermediate rh is the event horizonEH of the black hole and
r is the negative root For simplicity to choose the approximate metrics 
we carry out the dragging coordinate transformation as     t where

The line element 4 has many superior properties i the metric is regular
at the EH and the CH ii the EH and the CH are respectively coincident
with its innite red-shift surface iii it satises Landaus condition of the
coordinate clock synchronization All these features are very helpful to study
Hawking radiation from the rotating Kerr de Sitter black hole via quantum
tunnelling method proposed by Parikh and Wilczek3 In our case this coor-
dinate transformation would provide us much more simplicity to choose the
matrices  To view Hawking radiation of Dirac particles we must rst in-
troduce its motion equation For Dirac particles in black hole space-time its
motion equation can be written as
i     
  0
where   i
2g  I There are many dierent ways to choose the  matrices and for
simplicity our choice is
4h i and the matrices  satisfy   
2 
 P P  i
 

 
K r

H r
 
 
where ii  1 2 3 is Pauli matrices Being Dirac particles with spin 12 the
wave function must be well described with both spin up  and spin down
 Here we choose the wave functions with spin up  and spin down 
taking the form as

Ct r  
Dt r  


expcid18 i
It r  cid19

Here I and I respectively denote the action of Dirac particles with spin
up  and spin down  tunnelling across black hole horizons Inserting the
wave function with spin up  into Dirac equation 6 the spin down case 
proceeding in a manner fully analogous to the spin up case then dividing by
the exponential term and multiplying by  the resulting equations to leading
order in  are
tI  BqG rrI  mA  0

tI  AqG rrI  mB  0
B  1
A  1
I  0
I  0

It is dicult to directly get the value of the action From the above equations
we can nd the action can be separated Considering the symmetries of Kerr
de Sitter black hole we carry out separation of variables as
I    jt  W r  j    
where  is the energy of the emitted particles measured by the observer at
the innity and j denotes the angular quantum number about  Inserting
Eq13 into Eqs9 10 11 and 12  we have
  j  BqG rrW r  mA  0
  j  AqG rrW r  mB  0

B  1
A  1
  
  
j  0
j  0
From Eqs16 and 17   must be a complex function which means in
computing the imaginary part of the action it yields a contribution However
further studying indicates that the contribution from   is completely same
for both the outgoing and ingoing solutions So when dividing the outgoing
probability by the incoming probability the contribution of   to the imag-
inary part of the action is cancelled out Although there are four equations
we are only interested in the rst two for the imaginary part of the action can
be produced here Now the tunnelling rate is directly related to the solutions
of Eqs14 and 15 When m  0 the above equations describe Hawking ra-
diation for massless particles and Eqs14 and 15 decouple While m 6 0
they describe Hawking radiation for massive particles and Eqs14 and 15
couple In fact whatever Eqs14 and 15 couple or not it doesnt aect the
result we want Eqs14 and 15 have a non-trivial solution for A and B only
if the determinant of the coecient matrix vanishes which results
W r  Z vuut   j2  m2F r
F r G r
where  sign corresponds to the outgoingingoing wave of the particles
Now we focus on considering Hawking radiation at the EH of the black hole
At the EH solving Eq18 yields
Wh r  i
 i
  jh
qF  rh G rh
h  a2   jh
2 rh  2r3
hl2  rha2l2  M 
and h  rh  ar2
h  a2 is the angular velocity at the event hori-
zonEH of the black hole Then the tunnelling probability for Dirac particles
with spin up  across the EH takes the form as
P emission
P absorption
 exp 2
exp 2ImI
exp 2ImI
h  a2   jh
hl2  rha2l2  M 
rh  2r3
exp 2ImWh
exp 2ImWh
This is the Boltzmann factor with Hawking temperature at the EH of Kerr de
Sitter black hole taking
rh  2r3
hl2  rha2l2  M
2 r2
h  a2
which is fully in accordance with that obtained by other methods 12 When
  3l2  0 from Eq21 Hawking temperature of Kerr black hole is
recovered15 When a  0 and   3l2  0 the temperature reads as
18M which is exactly Hawking temperature of Schwarzschild black hole
Beyond particles tunnelling from the EH particles can also tunnel from the
CH Dierent from the tunnelling behavior across the EH the emitted particle
is found to tunnel into the CH Next our focus is on computing the emission
rate of Dirac particles via tunnelling from the cosmological horizonCH At
the CH according to Eq18 the radial wave function Wc r satises
Wc r  i

qF  rc G rc
c  a2   jc
2 rc  2r3
c l2  rca2l2  M 
where rc determines the location of the CH and c  rc  ar2
c  a2
is the angular velocity at the CH of the black hole Considering particles
tunnelling into the CH the emission rate for Dirac particles with spin up 
across the CH is
P absorption
P emission
 exp 2
rc  2r3
c  a2   jc
c l2  rca2l2  M 
exp 2ImI
exp 2ImI
exp 2ImWc
exp 2ImWc
Here to let Eq23 taken the form as the Boltzmann factor that is  
exp cE where c is the inverse temperature at the CH  two choices may
appear to us One choice is taking the negative inverse temperature c and
the other considering E     jc However the negative temperature
seems to be unphysical So we only choose to change the sign of the posi-
tive frequency that is to say when measured an emitted particle taking a
positive frequency its energy becomes negative in de Sitter spaces This is
similar to the case that in de Sitter spaces the positive mass m is measured as
the negative energy by E  m This new interpretation of the emission rate
recently appears in Ref13 As a result Hawking temperature at the CH of
Kerr de Sitter black hole can be written as
rc  2r3
c l2  rca2l2  M
2 r2
c  a2
This result is consistent with that in Ref12 Obviously Hawking tempera-
tures of Dirac particles tunnelling from the EH and the CH of Kerr de Sitter
black hole are well described via fermions tunnelling method In our case we
only consider tunnelling particles with spin up but for spin down case we can
also adopt the same procedure to get the same result
3 Charged Dirac particles tunnelling from Kerr-Newman de Sitter
black hole
In this section to further develop Kerner and Mans fermion tunnelling method
taking a charged rotating Kerr-Newman black black hole in de Sitter space
as an example we study Hawking radiation of charged Dirac particles tun-
nelling from the EH and the CH The metric of Kerr-Newman de Sitter black
hole 14 can be given by Eqs1 and 2 by replacing 2Mr with 2Mr  Q2
Correspondingly its electromagnetic potential takes the following form as
A  Atdt  Ad 
r2  a2 cos2 
Qra sin2 
r2  a2 cos2  
As mentioned in Sec2 for simplicity we suppose all the observers are dragged
with the rotating black hole which means carrying out the dragging coordinate
transformation     t where
  h r2  a2  ei a
 r2  a22  ea2 sin2 
is the angular velocity of the black hole After performing this transforma-
tion the new metric takes the same form as Eq4 only replacing  with
e  r2  a2 1  r2l2  2Mr  Q2 and the electromagnetic potential cor-
respondingly changes as
A  AtdtAd 
Qr r2  a2
 r2  a22  ea2 sin2 
Qra sin2 
r2  a2 cos2  
d 27
When dealing with charged Dirac particles tunnelling from black holes we
must rst introduce its motion equation In the curved spaces charged Dirac
particles satisfy Dirac equation as
icid18   
eAcid19  
  0
where e is the electric charge of the tunnelling particle and A represents the
electromagnetic potential of the black hole Considering the metrics in Sec2
and 3 sharing the similar forms here we choose the matrices  taking the
form as Eq7 and the wave functions with spin up  and spin down 
as Eq8 For simplicity in our discussion we only consider the tunnelling
particles taking spin up  Substituting the wave function with spin up 
into Dirac equation 28 we have
tI  eAt  BqG rrI  mA  0
tI  eAt  AqG rrI  mB  0

B  1
A  1
I 
I 
I  eA  0
I  eA  0
Due to the presence of the electric charge for the emitted particles the above
equations are dierent from those in Sec2 but the action can also be sep-
arated Our interest is still the rst two Being taken the same symmetries
between Kerr de Sitter black hole and Kerr-Newman de Sitter black hole we
carry out separation of variables as Eq13 to Eqs29 and 30 which yields

  eAt  j  BqG rrW r  mA  0
  eAt  j  AqG rrW r  mB  0
As in Sec2 here we do not consider the contribution of the angular part to
the imaginary part of the action To demand Eqs33 and 34 solvable the
determinant of the coecient matrix must be vanished that is
W r  Z vuut   eAt  j2  m2F r
F r G r
where  correspond to the outgoingingoing solutions At the EH of the
black hole solving Eq35 we have
Wh r  i
 i
  eAtrh  jh
qF  rh G rh
2 rh  2r3
h  a2   eAtrh  jh
hl2  rha2l2  M 
where h  rh  a r2
h  a2 is the angular velocity at the EH of Kerr-
Newman de Sitter black hole So the tunnelling probability of Dirac particles
across the event horizonEH is
P emission
P absorption
 exp 2
h  a2   eAtrh  jh
rh  2r3
hl2  rha2l2  M  
exp 2ImI
exp 2ImI
exp 2ImWh
exp 2ImWh
And Hawking temperature at the EH of Kerr-Newman de Sitter black hole is
recovered as
rh  2r3
hl2  rha2l2  M
This result is consistent with that in Ref14 When   3l2  0 from
Eq38 Hawking temperature of Kerr-Newman black hole is recovered1516
When a  0 Q  0 and   3l2  0 Kerr-Newman de Sitter black hole
is reduced to Schwarzschild black hole and the temperature is recovered as
18M
As in Sec2 Hawking radiation can also be produced at the cosmological
horizonCH At the CH outgoing particles can fall out of the horizon along
classically permitted trajectories and incoming particles tunnel from it to
form Hawking radiation This tunnelling behavior is dierent from that at the
EH where incoming particles fall behind the horizon along classically per-
mitted trajectories and Hawking radiation is produced by outgoing particles
tunnelling from the horizon As a result taking the same procedure as Sec2
Hawking temperature at the CH of Kerr-Newman de Sitter black hole is
rc  2r3
c l2  rca2l2  M
This result takes the same form as that in Ref14 So Hawking temperature
of Kerr-Newman de Sitter black hole can also be recovered by charged Dirac
particles tunnelling from the EH and the CH As before here we only consider
the tunnelling Dirac particles with spin up for the spin down case the same
result can be recovered
4 Conclusion and Discussion
In this paper considering Dirac particles tunnelling from the event hori-
zonEH and the cosmological horizonCH we have studied Hawking radia-
tion from rotating black holes in de Sitter spaces which includes that from
Kerr de Sitter black hole and Kerr-Newman de Sitter black hole As a result
Hawking temperatures at the EH and the CH of the two rotating black holes
are successfully recovered These results promote Kerner and Mans fermion
tunnelling method to the cases of Dirac particles tunnelling from the EH and
the CH of rotating black holes in de Sitter spaces and once again prove its
validity and universality
Dierent from the tunnelling behavior at the EH at the CH outgoing par-
ticles can fall out of the horizon along classically permitted trajectories and
incoming particles tunnel from it to form Hawking radiation So the tun-
nelling rate should be expressed by dividing the incoming probability by the
outgoing probability as Eq23 On the other hand when doing de Sitter
radiation to set the tunnelling rate taken as the Boltzmann factor we con-
sider E     j which means an emitted particle taking a positive
frequency its energy becomes negative in de Sitter spaces This new inter-
pretation of the emission rate can be recently seen in Ref13
When carrying on separation of variables for the action we only concern
ourselves with positive frequency contributions And when considering Dirac
particles tunnelling from the EH and the CH of black holes we only refer
to those with spin up In fact these two hypothesis would not stop fermion
tunnelling method from losing its generality
