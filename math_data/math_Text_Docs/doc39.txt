Abstract Turing mechanisms can yield a large variety of patterns from noisy homogenous initial
conditions and have been proposed as patterning mechanism for many developmental processes
However the molecular components that give rise to Turing patterns have remained elusive and
the small size of the parameter space that permits Turing patterns to emerge makes it dicult to
explain how Turing patterns could evolve We have recently shown that Turing patterns can be
obtained with a single ligand if the ligand-receptor interaction is taken into account Here we show
that the general properties of ligand-receptor systems result in very large Turing spaces Thus the
restriction of receptors to single cells negative feedbacks regulatory interactions between dierent
ligand-receptor systems and the clustering of receptors on the cell surface all greatly enlarge the
Turing space We further show that the feedbacks that occur in the FGF10SHH network that
controls lung branching morphogenesis are sucient to result in large Turing spaces We conclude
that the cellular restriction of receptors provides a mechanism to suciently increase the size
of the Turing space to make the evolution of Turing patterns likely Additional feedbacks may
then have further enlarged the Turing space Given their robustness and exibility we propose
that receptor-ligand based Turing mechanisms present a general mechanism for patterning in biology
Popular Summary Turing mechanisms can yield a large variety of patterns from noisy homoge-
nous initial conditions and have been proposed to underlie many of the patterning phenomena in
biology However the molecular components are elusive and the small size of the parameter space
that permits Turing patterns makes their evolution unlikely We show that Turing patterns that
arise from ligand-receptor interactions have very large Turing spaces because receptors are restricted
to single cells The Turing space can be further enlarged by additional negative feedbacks if sev-
eral receptor-ligand based Turing modules are coupled and by the clustering of receptors on the
cell surface Given their robustness and exibility we propose that receptor-ligand based Turing
mechanisms present a general mechanism for patterning in biology

INTRODUCTION
The development of complex organisms requires the
repeated reliable emergence of pattern in a cell or tis-
sue from a homogenous noisy distribution of compo-
nents also in the absence of any polarizing queues
is a long-standing question how stereotyped patterns can
emerge during development Alan Turing proposed a
simple reaction-diusion-based mechanism 1 that has
since been shown to have the potential to give rise to a
large variety of patterns from noisy homogenous starting
conditions 24
Mathematical analysis reveals the types of interactions
between the molecular components that can give rise to
Turing patterns 3 57 While many dierent Turing
mechanisms have been proposed to explain pattern for-
mation in biology it has remained dicult to identify the
molecular components 2 The suggested Turing compo-
nents are typically two diusible extracellular proteins
810 However one of the requirements for Turing pat-
terns is a large dierence in the diusion coecient be-
tween the two Turing components While a number of
chemical systems have been engineered where the diu-
sion speed of one of the components of the Turing sys-
tem is strongly reduced eg the BelousovZhabotinsky
reaction in water-in-oil aerosol microelmulsion 4 or in a
system with a low-mobility complexing agent 11 these
setups do not readily translate to biological systems For
biological systems it has been suggested that dierences
in diusion speed may arise from transient dierences
in the interactions with the extracellular matrix 12 A
number of theoretical studies seek to overcome the re-
quirement of a large dierence in diusivity of Turing
components and an emergence of Turing pattern has
been shown to be possible also in the presence of a sin-
gle diusive specie coupled to a quenched oscillator 13

a Turing mechanism can result from cooperative receptor-ligand interactions where m receptors R and n ligand molecules
L form an active complex that upregulates the receptor concentration by increasing its expression limiting its turn-over
or similar Importantly the highest receptor and ligand concentrations are observed in dierent places B In case of the
standard network panel A Turing patterns emerge only for a small subset of the parameter range of the receptor and ligand
production rates a and b amax denotes the maximal value of the receptor production rate while bmin and bmax denote the
minimal and maximal ligand production rates C Additional feedbacks red and dashed blue arrows can be mediated by
the ligand-receptor complex R2L  indicates receptor-ligand interactions cid97 inhibitory interactions and  up-regulating
interactions D The negative feedbacks in panel C network U5 in Fig S1 result in a larger Turing space when the response
threshold p is lowered from p  1 blue shaded area to p  01 yellow area E The size of the Turing space for the
network in panel C network U5 in Fig S1 increases as the response threshold p is lowered As a measure for the size of the
Turing space we record the maximum of the receptor production rate amax and the ratio of the maximal and minimal ligand
production rates bratio  bmax
 for which Turing patterns can emerge a  0 is part of the Turing space and negative values of
a have no physiological interpretation
cell migration rather than diusion has been proposed
to result in Turing instabilities 14 15 Finally cross-
diusion and non-linear diusion have been shown to
support the formation of Turing-type patterns such that
Turing patterns can arise for any ratio of the main diu-
sivities 1621 Cross-diusion has been shown to arise
in crowded environments with nite carrying capacity
if diusion is limited when local concentrations or
densities reach the carrying capacity 20 22
Another problem with the applicability of Turing
mechanisms to biological pattern formation concerns the
size of the parameter space that gives rise to Turing pat-
terns the Turing space This parameter space is small
for all known Turing mechanisms in the sense that kinetic
parameters can be varied only a few fold as long as phys-
iological constraints on the kinetic constants and relative
diusion constants are respected 23 It is therefore un-
clear how nature could have evolved such mechanism in
the rst place and how it could have been re-used in dif-
ferent settings during the evolution of new species More-
over biological systems are noisy and time delays as may
arise from the multi-step nature of protein expression as
well as domain growth and the resulting changes in source
and sink terms may severely aect the existence and type
of Turing patterns though some of these eects as well
as further regulatory interactions may somewhat increase
the size of the Turing space 2431
We recently noticed that ligand-receptor interactions
of the form shown in Fig 1A can give rise to Turing
patterns 3235 as long as the following constraints are
met by the the receptor-ligand interaction
 Ligands must diuse much faster than receptors
d cid29 1 as is generally the case 3639
 Receptor-dependent ligand removal must dominate
over receptor-independent ligand decay as is gen-
erally the case because unspecic decay is typically
much slower than active protein turn-over
 Ligands and receptors must bind cooperatively as
is the case for many ligand-receptor pairs 4048
 Ligand-receptor complex formation must be fast
ABDamaxamaxbmaxbmaxbminp01p1p1p01EamaxbmaxbminCLR2L2Rcompared to the other processes such that we have
a quasi-steady state for the ligand-receptor complex
concentration This is the case if the on-rate is very
high ie binding is diusion limited as is the case
for many ligand-receptor pairs 49
 The receptor-ligand complex must upregulate the
receptor concentration as has been observed for
several receptor systems 5056 This positive
feedback needs to operate far from saturation ie if
we describe the positive regulation by a Hill func-
tion of the form R2L
Thus this positive feedback must be rather ine-
R2LK  we require R2L cid28 K
If these conditions are met the interactions between the
receptor R and the ligand L result in Schnakenberg-
type kinetics 57 of the form
 R  f R L with f R L  a  R  R2L 1
 dL  gR L with gR L  b  R2L
which correspond to the so-called activator-depleted sub-
strate Turing kinetics rst described by Gierer and Mein-
hardt 5 and which are very similar to the chemi-
cal Turing system rst described by Prigogine and co-
workers 7 The detailed derivation of these equations
for receptor-ligand interactions can be found in previous
publications 3235 and in the Appendix I The R and
dL terms represent the diusion terms where d is the
relative diusion constant of ligand and receptor Lig-
ands typically diuse faster than their receptors d cid29 1
5860 thus naturally meeting the Turing condition of
dierent diusivities Receptor diusion is restricted to
single cells and we have previously shown that patterns
also emerge on such cellularized domains 34 The con-
stants a and b are the receptor and ligand production
rates The R term describes the ligand-independent de-
cay of the receptor at a rate proportional to the available
receptor concentration so-called linear decay The term
R2L represents the quasi-steady state concentration of
the receptor-ligand complex Signaling complexes with a
dierent stochiometry also result in Turing patterns 34
The minus term in Eq 2 then reects the receptor-
dependent ligand removal rate while the plus term in
Eq 1 reects the combined eects of ligand-induced
receptor removal and ligand-induced receptor accumula-
tion on the cell membrane by increased transcription
translation recycling less constitutive removal or simi-
lar The  term arises in the non-dimensionalization of
the model Eq 16 and is useful as it is proportional to
the domain area and it gives the relative strength of the
reaction and diusion terms 3
A number of ligand-receptor systems meet the above
conditions including Hedgehog and its receptor PTCH
33 34 46 54 55 BMPs and their BMP receptors 35
47 48 56 GDNF and its receptor RET 32 40 41 50
51 as well as FGFs and their FGF receptors 4245 52
53 Thus all of these proteins are multimers and by
a range of mechanisms the formation of the multimeric
ligand-receptor complexes enhances the concentration of
receptors on the membrane as recently reviewed 61 We
further showed that models based on these proteins could
recapitulate the relevant wildtype and mutant expression
patterns in the respective developmental systems 3235
Here we show that ligand-receptor based Turing mech-
anisms can have signicantly enlarged Turing spaces if
we include negative feedbacks or couple several Turing
modules as generally found in biological systems Simi-
larly the restriction of receptors to single cells and their
clustering further increases the size of the Turing space
We conclude that a receptor-ligand based Turing mecha-
nism oers a realistic mechanism to implement the Tur-
ing mechanism in a biological setting The observation
that the restriction of receptors to cells is sucient to
massively increase the Turing space oers an explana-
tion of how Turing patterns may have rst evolved in
nature additional feedbacks could then further enlarge
the Turing space
II RESULTS
The Turing mechanism has been analysed extensively
and the parameter space that permits Turing patterns
to emerge can easiest be determined with the help of a
linear stability analysis 3 see the Appendix II To keep
the analysis feasible it is advisable to consider as simple
models as possible and to restrict the number of parame-
ters to a minimum The non-dimensional ligand-receptor
based Turing model Eq 1-2 has four parameters
the relative ligandreceptor diusion constant d the re-
ceptor production rate a the ligand production rate b
and the scaling factor  The parameters a b d de-
termine whether Turing patterns can emerge while the
scaling factor  determines whether the domain is su-
ciently large for Turing patterns to emerge We therefore
do not need to analyse  here The relative diusion con-
stant of ligands and receptors d aects the size of the
Turing space in that a larger d results in a larger Turing
space 3 Since this eect is well documented but lim-
ited by the physiological dierence between the diusion
constants of ligands and receptors we xed the relative
diusion constant in our analysis For a simple receptor-
ligand based Turing system in which receptor and ligand
bind cooperatively and upregulate the receptor concen-
tration Fig 1A both parameter values a and b produce
Turing patterns only within a small range Fig 1B ie
the ligand production rate can at most be halved or dou-
bled without leaving the Turing space The Turing space
is thus very small even though the relative diusion con-
stant d  50 between ligands and receptors was chosen
to be rather large compared to what could be justied
for two soluble ligands We will now analyse the impact
of feedbacks receptor clustering and the restriction of
pact of feedbacks on the Turing space for the regulatory
system with two additional negative feedbacks shown in
Fig 1C For a large response threshold p  1 the Turing
space is similar in size to the non-feedback case compare
the blue shaded area in Fig 1D to the Turing space in
Fig 1B As we lower the response threshold to p  01
and thus increase the strength of the negative feedbacks
the Turing space increases in size ie both the maxi-
mal receptor production rate amax as well as the range
of ligand expression rates bmin bmax increases yellow
area in Fig 1D the minimum of a is negative and amax
thus denes the size of the physiological parameter range
0 amax As the response threshold p is lowered further
the size of the Turing space further increases Fig 1E
We next systematically analysed eleven positive neg-
ative and mixed feedback architectures that were ob-
tained by including feedbacks of the receptor-ligand com-
plex R2L on the receptor a andor ligand production
rates b as well as on the rate of receptor up-regulation
upon receptor-ligand binding for details see Appendix
II Fig S1 Figure 2AB shows the three cases with the
largest Turing space out of the eleven cases analyzed For
better readability we only record the maximal receptor
production rate amax as well as the ratio bratio  bmax
of the maximal and minimal ligand production rates that
permit Turing patterns to emerge We note that the ra-
tio bratio  bmax
is biologically more relevant than the
absolute size of the Turing space b  bmax  bmin be-
cause in biology relative changes in regulatory control
and thus in production rates are particularly relevant
the absolute values are typically very dicult to mea-
sure The largest Turing spaces are obtained with nega-
tive feedbacks When the negative feedback is applied to
the constitutive receptor expression a blue the max-
imal value of a increases relative to the standard model
black spot as the response threshold p is lowered the
minimum of a is negative and amax thus denes the size
of the physiological parameter range 0 amax If a feed-
back is applied to the ligand expression rate b then
as the response threshold p is lowered the range of b
increases red compared to the standard model black
spot The largest Turing spaces expanded both along
the a and b axes are observed when negative feedbacks
are applied to both the receptor and ligand expression
rates green The impact of the negative feedbacks can
be observed for a wide range of the new parameters p
and becomes stronger the smaller the value of the re-
sponse threshold p Fig 2B As the response threshold
p is increased the maximal values of a and the range
of b all attain the value of the standard receptor-ligand
model and thus all converge in the black spot in Fig 2B
In summary substantially enlarged Turing spaces are ob-
served when signaling by the the receptor-ligand complex
lowers the receptor production rate Fig 2B blue or the

of a single receptor-ligand based Turing Module
Feedbacks are ubiquitous in biological signaling sys-
In the framework of receptor-ligand-based Tur-
ing mechanisms feedbacks result from regulatory inter-
actions of the receptor-ligand complex R2L Fig 1C
To encode feedbacks mediated by receptor-ligand signal-
ing we modied the reaction terms f R L and gR L
in the Turing model Eq 1-2 See Supplemental Ma-
terial 91 for the list of all tested models with additional
feedbacks Thus a positive feedback on receptor or ligand
expression would be obtained by adding a term pR2L to
the respective equation andor by multiplying the consti-
tutive receptor and ligand production rates a and b with
the factor R2L

by multiplying the constitutive receptor and ligand ex-

B Coupled Turing Modules
In patterning processes several receptor-ligand sys-
tems often interact eg SHH FGF10 and BMP together
with their receptors regulate branching morphogenesis of
the lung and several glands while GDNF FGF10 and
WNT and their receptors regulate kidney branching mor-
phogenesis as recently reviewed 61 We were there-
fore interested how the interaction of several such Turing
modules would aect the Turing space
To that end we carried out a systematic analysis
of possible feedback interactions between two separate
receptor-ligand-based Turing systems for details see the
Appendix II E The studied network architectures sys-
tems of equations and Turing spaces are shown in Fig
S1 Figure 3A summarizes the coupled Turing modules
with the largest Turing spaces Here similar as for un-
coupled modules Fig 2 the largest Turing space is ob-
served when a negative feedback acts on the production
rates Fig 3 We notice that coupling of the two Turing
systems via a negative feedback on the constitutive re-
ceptor expression rates a results mainly in an increase
in the parameter space of a Fig 3B blue while cou-
pling the two Turing systems via a negative feedback on
the constitutive ligand production rate b results mainly
FIG 4 Negative Feedbacks enlarge the Turing space
by limiting the eective production rates The plot of
the A eective receptor production rate ae 
maxR2Lp1
versus the receptor production rate a and B the plot of the
eective ligand production rate be 
maxR2Lp1 versus b
show that as a result of the negative feedbacks the eective
production rates remain in a narrow range even as a and
b are greatly changed The calculation was carried out for
the symmetrically coupled Turing system shown in green in
Figure 3B
in an increase in the parameter space for b Fig 3B red
The asymmetrically coupled modules with one feedback
on a and one on b have a very large possibly innitely
large parameter space Fig S1 panels C6 C8 and C10
However the parameter range is very narrow and ex-
tends towards innity only along the b-axis while it is
bounded above on the a-axis A massive increase in the
size of the Turing space is observed when the two Tur-
ing modules are coupled by four negative feedbacks such
that all constitutive receptor and ligand expression rates
are regulated by negative feedbacks Fig 3B green and
Fig S1 panel C11 In this case the parameter space
dramatically increases in both directions as p is lowered
such that already for p  01 the parameter ranges of
both a and b expand by more than four orders of magni-
tude compared to a single receptor-ligand based Turing
model and further increase as p is lowered Fig 3B green
and Fig S1 panel C11
C Negative Feedbacks enlarge the Turing space by
limiting the eective production rates
We wondered why negative feedbacks would enlarge
the Turing space To this end we plotted the eec-
maxR2Lp1 and be 
tive production rates ae 
maxR2Lp1 for the coupled Turing systems with the
largest Turing space Fig 3B green versus a and b re-
spectively Fig 4 We nd that the eective production
rates are much smaller than what the parameter values a
and b would suggest and almost lie within the standard
small Turing space Thus the negative feedback eec-
tively corrects the receptor and ligand production rates
and thereby enables the Turing mechanism to tolerate a
much wider range of production rates
L2L12R1R12L1R22L2R2ABp decreasesABD The restriction of receptors to single cells
enlarges the Turing space
So far we have treated receptors in the same way as
the ligand just with a smaller diusion coecient How-
ever receptors are conned to single cells and thus cannot
diuse from one cell to the next Moreover they often
cluster on the cell surface We therefore next studied
Turing patterns on cellular domains where receptors are
conned to single cells while ligands can diuse within
the tissue Fig 5A The computational details of the
implementation have previously been described 63 and
details of the implementation are given in Appendix III
In brief to restrict diusion of receptors to a single cell
in 1D and 2D models Fig 5 B left and middle panel
respectively we set no-ux boundary conditions for re-
ceptor at the pseudo-cell boundary while ligand was free
to diuse in the entire domain In the 3D model the cell
surfaces were approximated as spheres Fig 5B right
panel and both ligands and receptors were produced
on the spheres surfaces Diusion of receptors was re-
stricted to the surface of each sphere while ligand was
free to diuse also in the intercellular space the details of
the implementation have been previously described 64
We observe the emergence of patterns on 1D 2D and
3D cellularized domains Fig 5B and as a tissue do-
main of a given size is divided into more and thus
smaller cells to which the receptors are restricted the
Turing space increases Fig 5C Interestingly however
cells with a high level of receptor-ligand complexes occur
only as isolated spots Fig 5B red spots while clusters
of such active cells are not observed To obtain clusters of
active cells we have to include a second diusively com-
ponent T  that is secreted by the active cells and that
activates neighboring cells Fig 5D
E Receptor clustering enlarges the Turing space
Receptors often cluster on cell membranes either as
pre-clusters or induced by multimeric ligand Clustered
receptor-ligand complexes may cooperate 65 such that
regulation is not mediated by a single ligand-receptor
complex but by the cluster We then have R2Lpn
with n  1 in Eq 1-2 instead of R2Lp As we
increase n we observe a further increase in the size of
the Turing space Fig6AB In summary both receptor
clustering and the cellular restriction of receptors greatly
increase the Turing space
F Physiological Turing Models
Physiological networks harbour many feedbacks and
we wondered by how much the size of the Turing space
would be increased in physiological settings Here we
considered the network that controls branching morpho-
genesis in the lung Fig 7A similar networks also op-

III DISCUSSION
Turing mechanisms can reproduce a wide range of bio-
logical patterning phenomena However it has remained
unclear how they may be implemented on the molecular
scale and how they could evolve in spite of the small sizes
of their Turing spaces We propose that ligand-receptor
interactions give rise to Turing patterns and we show
that negative feedbacks the coupling of Turing modules
and the restriction of receptors to single cells can greatly
increase the size of the Turing space Fig 2 3 5 and
thus increase the range of parameter values for which
Turing patterns will emerge in biological systems

sion of its own receptor FGFR2b 71 while SHH signal-
ing downregulates Fgf10 expression72 and upregulates
the expression of its own receptor Ptch1 73 Fig7A
We have previously shown that the SHH-PTCH kinetics
can be described by Eq1-2 33 34 similar equations can
also be derived for the FGF10-FGFR2b kinetics see Ap-
pendix I for a general derivation of the ligand-receptor
kinetics The particular stoichiometry in Eq 1-2 as-
sumes the binding of one ligand dimer to two receptor
monomers In case of FGF10 monomeric binding of one
FGF10 dimer to its trivalent FGFR2b receptor triggers
dimerization of the FGF10-receptor complex 74 SHH is
a multimer that may form higher order complexes with
its receptor PTCH1 75 We have previously shown that
similar Turing patterns can be observed also with such
very dierent stochiometries 34 For ease of compari-
son we stick to the standard model Eq 1-2 for the
FGF10 and SHH modules though we note that larger
SHHPTCH1 clusters would further increase the Turing
space Fig 5EF The two signalling factors interact in
that FGF10 upregulates Shh expression 66 while SHH
signaling downregulates Fgf10 expression72 The equa-

The conditions for ligand-receptor based Turing mech-
anisms as summarised in the Introduction are met by
many dierent ligand-receptor pairs and we have pre-
viously shown that receptor-ligand based Turing mech-
anisms can indeed well describe the patterning pro-
cesses for a range of developmental systems 3235 61
Equally negative feedbacks are prevalent in biological
regulation and have previously been shown to enable ro-
bustness to noise 77 and transient responsiveness 78
We now propose that negative feedbacks enable robust
patterning also for receptor-ligand based Turing mecha-
nisms Interestingly also the restriction of receptors to
single cells can further increase the size of the Turing
space Fig 5 This suggests a way of how Turing mech-
anisms may have rst evolved Cooperative interactions
in receptor clusters and the introduction of feedbacks as
well as the coupling of several Turing modules may then
have further increased the size of the Turing space
It will be important to test our theoretical insights
by synthetically constructing such ligand-receptor-based
Turing mechanism and by establishing the key pa-
rameter values rates of production decay diusion
coecients endogenous concentrations etc
living systems The Turing space of ligand-receptor
systems with additional negative feedbacks should be
suciently large that synthetic biology approaches can
now obtain Turing patterns in spite of the diculties
to accurately control kinetic rates in synthetic biology
approaches Given their robustness and exibility we
propose that receptor-ligand based Turing mechanisms
are the likely standard way how Turing mechanisms are
implemented in Nature

We note that the linear response of the receptor pro-

crease the size of the Turing space Based on the re-
sults in Fig S1 case U6 we expect that a saturation of
the response for higher ligand-receptor concentrations
as could be described by a Hill function of the form

shrinking of the Turing space
Equations 10-11 converge to the classical Schnaken-

A Derivation of the Non-Dimensional Set of
Equations for the Receptor-Ligand based Turing
Mechanism
In the following we will adopt the standard notation
that is used to describe Turing models and we write U for
the receptor concentration and V for the ligand concen-
tration U mV n represents the quasi-steady state concen-
tration of the receptor-ligand complex We have previ-
ously shown that a wide range of stochiometries can yield
Turing patters 81 Using m  2 n  1 ie one ligand
dimer V binds to two monomeric receptors U  equations
10-11 can be written as
 DUU  k1  k2U  k5  2k3U 2V
 DVV  k4  k6V  k3U 2V
where U  U  X and V  V  X are the un-
known functions depending on the time variable  and
space variable X The coecient k1 then represents
the constitutive receptor production rate while k4 repre-
sents the constitutive ligand production rate The term
k2U reects the ligand-independent receptor turn-over
rate while k6V reects the receptor-independent lig-
and turn-over rate k3U 2V reects the turn-over of
the receptor-ligand complex which leads to the removal
of one ligand dimer V  and two receptor monomers
U  Most ligand is typically removed by this receptor-
dependent process and we can therefore make the sim-
plifying approximation k6  0 Finally k5U 2V reects
the signalling-dependent increase in receptor emergence
which can happen by a wide range of mechanisms we
will set k5  3k3 in the following to recover the classical
Schnakenberg equations Equations 12-13 then read
 DUU  k1  k2U  k3U 2V
 DVV  k4  k3U 2V
These equations can be rewritten in dimensionless form

The function u then represents the receptor v rep-
resents the ligand and u2v represents the quasi-steady
state concentration of the receptor-ligand complex As
before one ligand dimer v binds to two monomeric re-
ceptors u We have previously shown that also other
combinations umvn result in Turing patterns 81 The
constant a then represents the constitutive receptor pro-
duction rate while b represents the constitutive lig-
and production rate The term u reects the ligand-
independent receptor turn-over rate while u2v reects
the receptor-dependent ligand removal rate Finally
u2v represents the net result of ligand-dependent re-
ceptor turn-over and the signalling-dependent increase in
receptor emergence where the latter dominates thus the
positive term
APPENDIX II DETERMINATION OF TURING
B The Turing Mechanism
In this section we summarize briey the criteria for
the emergence of Turing pattern for reaction-diusion
systems with two species We consider systems of the
 F U V   DU U
 GU V   DV V
dened on 0   with a given spatial domain  
Rn subject to boundary and initial conditions where the
space and time-dependent functions U and V represent
concentrations and the reaction kinetic terms F and G
are generally nonlinear functions After suitable changes
of variables and nondimensionalization Eq 17 can be
transformed into the dimensionless system
ut  f u v  u
vt  gu v  dv
where t is the rescaled time variable d denotes or is pro-
portional to the quotient of the diusion coecients DU
and DV and   const  L2 where L is a typical length
scale of the domain To ensure the uniqueness of the so-
lution we endow system 18 with initial and boundary
conditions We will use homogeneous Neumann bound-
ary condition of the form
cid18u
cid19
n  
on 0  
u0 x  u0x v0 x  v0x
because they are easy to handle and have a biological
interpretation impermeable boundary We note how-
ever that other boundary conditions would not greatly
alter the following analysis A Turing instability appears
when a reaction-diusion system has a stable steady state
in the absence of diusion which loses its stability in the
presence of diusion such that spatial patterns emerge
C Linear stability in the absence of diusion
Let u0 and v0 denote the steady state of the diusion-
free system of ordinary dierential equations ODEs
ut  f u v
vt  gu v
and linearize the system about u0 v0 by introducing
the translated function w  w1 w2T with w1  u 
u0 w2  v  v0 Then the linearized system becomes

guu0 v0 gvu0 v0
is the Jacobian evaluated at the point u0 v0 From
now on we write the partial derivatives evaluated at the
steady state without their arguments for brevity The
steady state of the linearized system is stable ie the
steady state of system 19 is linearly stable if cid60J  0
for all eigenvalues of J see any textbook on ODEs
which for a 2-component system is ensured by the con-
ditions
trJ  fu  gv  0
detJ  fugv  fvgu  0 20
D Diusion-driven instability
Now let us add diusion to our system of ODEs and
consider the reaction-diusion system linearized about
the steady state w  0 0T  which has the form
wt  Jw  Dw
cid88
where D  diag1 d is a diagonal matrix containing the
diusion coecients of the nondimensionalized system
18 We look for a solution of the form
wt x 
CkektWkx
where the exponents k determine the temporal growth
of the solution and the time-independent functions Wk
are the solutions of the elliptic eigenvalue problem
Wk  k2Wk  0
n  Wk  0
k  C 2
conditions
k T are the Fourier-coecients of the initial
Inserting equation 22 into equation 23 and using
the fact that the set of eigenfunctions of the Laplace op-
erator Wk forms a complete orthonormal system we
obtain as linearized system
wt  Jw  Dk2w
for each wavenumber k Writing
detI  J  k2D  0
in one dimension on the interval
For instance
the eigenvalues are k  nL n  0 1 2   
also called wavenumbers and the eigenfunctions are
W x  cosnxL  coskx The constants Ck 
where I  I2 is the 2-by-2 identity matrix we obtain
the eigenvalues   k of the matrix M  J  k2D
Expanding the above determinant we obtain that k is
the root of the second order polynomial equation
2  cid0k21  d  fu  gvcid1  dk4  dfu  gvk2  2fugv  fvgu  0
Since we look for unstable solutions we require that
cid60k  0 for some k cid54 0 This means that either the
coecient of  andor the constant term must be neg-
ative Since the steady state is required to be linearly
stable in the absence of diusion which corresponds to
the case k  0 we must have k21  d fu  gv  0
Hence to obtain a  with positive real part in the pres-
ence of diusion we require
hk2  dk4  dfu  gvk2  2fugv  fvgu  0
for some nonzero wavenumber k Since we require fugv
fvgu  0 for linear stability in the absence of diusion
k  0 20 it follows that dfu  gv  0 must hold
This condition is not sucient to ensure the negativity
of the function h an elementary calculation shows that
the minimum of h is attained at the point
dfu  gv
cid20
and the minimum value of h is
hmin  hk2
m  2
fugv  fvgu  dfu  gv2
cid21
which is negative if the expression in the bracket is neg-
In summary the well-known conditions see 83 Sec
23 for which a reaction-diusion system with two
species exhibits a Turing instability are as follows
dfu  gv  0
fu  gv  0
fugv  fvgu  0
dfu  gv2  4dfu  gv  fvgu  0
where all partial derivatives are evaluated at the steady
state u0 v0 We note that it is possible that these con-
ditions are satised but that no pattern emerges This
is the case when h is not negative for any k within the
discrete set of wavenumbers and only takes a negative
value in between two of these discrete wavenumbers The
distance between wavenumbers shrinks as  is increased
and in the limit of innite  the spectrum of k is continu-
ous Since  is related to the size of the spatial domain it
follows that on small domains pattern formation may not
happen while on a suciently increased domain patterns
may be observed
E Turing instability in interacting systems
We now consider two identical reaction-diusion sys-
tems which we couple with each other in several ways
When the couplings are of the same type ie when the
rst 2-component Turing system based on u and v is cou-
pled with the second Turing system that is based on cid101u
andcid101v via the same functions f and g then we can derive
exact conditions for the Turing instability as an exten-
sion of the classical results that were presented in Section
V B see 83 Sec 23 for more details For this let us
consider systems of the form
ut  f u vcid101ucid101v  u
vt  gu vcid101ucid101v  dv
cid101ut  f cid101ucid101v u v  cid101u
cid101vt  gcid101ucid101v u v  dcid101v
where the functions f and g describe the chemical re-
actions   0 is a constant depending on the size of
the domain and d  0 is a diusion parameter Let
u0 v0cid101u0cid101v0 denote the steady state assuming that
symmetry u0 cid101u0 and v0 cid101v0 and  just as in the un-
there is only one or at least they are isolated of this
system in the absence of diusion note that due to the
coupled case 19  linearize the system about the steady
state The linearized system has the form
wt  Jw
is the Jacobian matrix Note the symmetry in J that
arises for this particular coupling In this linearized sys-
tem the steady state is stable if cid60J  0 for all eigen-
values of J The eigenvalues are the roots of the char-
acteristic polynomial kJ  of J which is now a fourth
order polynomial for the coupled system Due to the very
special form of the coupling and the resulting symmetries
in J the polynomial kJ can be factorized as

fu fv fcid101u fcid101v
kJ  cid22  fu  gv  fcid101u  gcid101v  fugv  fvgu  fugcid101v  fcid101vgu  fcid101ugv  fvgcid101u  fcid101ugcid101v  fcid101vgcid101u
cid22  fu  gv  fcid101u  gcid101v  fugv  fvgu  fugcid101v  fcid101vgu  fcid101ugv  fvgcid101u  fcid101ugcid101v  fcid101vgcid101u
gu gv gcid101u gcid101v
fcid101u fcid101v fu fv
gcid101u gcid101v gu gv
cid3
cid3 
Hence cid60J  0 holds for all the four eigenvalues of J
that is the steady state of 25 is linearly stable if both
of the factors in 26 have only roots with negative real
part ie
fu  gv  fcid101u  gcid101v
fugv  fvgu  fcid101ugcid101v  fcid101vgcid101u  fugcid101v  fcid101vgu  fcid101ugv  fvgcid101u
Following the course of the uncoupled case by adding
diusion we again arrive at Eq 23 now with the dif-
fusion matrix D  diag1 d 1 d As before we look for
a solution of the form of Eq 22 To this end we de-
termine the eigenvalues   k for M  J  k2D The
characteristic polynomial of this matrix  given the spe-
cial forms of J and D  can be factorized as the product
of two second order polynomials
kM  cid22  cid0k21  d  fu  gv  fcid101u  gcid101vcid1  dk4  k2dfu  gv  dfcid101u  gcid101v

To obtain a Turing instability at least one of the roots of
kM has to have positive real part for some k cid54 0 ie one
of the factors of kM must have a root with cid60M   0
The rst factor of 28 has a root with positive real part
if the coecient of  is negative or the constant term
is negative But since the steady state is stable in the
absence of diusion linear stability conditions 27 the
coecient of  is always positive ie k21  d  fu 
gv  fcid101u  gcid101v  0 Hence we require that
h1k2  dk4  k2dfu  gv  dfcid101u  gcid101v  2fugv  fvgu  fugcid101v  fcid101vgu  fcid101ugv  fvgcid101u  fcid101ugcid101v  fcid101vgcid101u  0
is positive ie fugv  fvgu  fugcid101v  fcid101vgu  fcid101ugv  fvgcid101u 
holds for some wavenumber k cid54 0 Since we know from
the linear stability conditions 27 that the constant term
fcid101ugcid101vfcid101vgcid101u  0 it follows that dfugvdfcid101ugcid101v  0 must
hold We further need to ensure that the function h1
attains a negative value for some of the wave numbers
The minimum of h1 is attained at
1m  
dfu  gv  dfcid101u  gcid101v
and the minimum value of h1 is
min  h1k2
1m  2
cid20
fugv  fvgu  fugcid101v  fcid101vgu  fcid101ugv  fvgcid101u  fcid101ugcid101v  fcid101vgcid101u  dfu  gv  dfcid101u  gcid101v2
cid21
The minimum value of h1 is thus negative if the expres-
sion in the bracket is negative If the rst factor of 28
does not have roots with positive real part the second
factor has to have at least one root with positive real
part to obtain a Turing instability By similar reasoning
as before we know from 27 that the coecient of  is
again always positive k21dfu gvfcid101ugcid101v  0
Hence it is required that
h2k2  dk4  k2dfu  gv  dfcid101u  gcid101v  2fugv  fvgu  fugcid101v  fcid101vgu  fcid101ugv  fvgcid101u  fcid101ugcid101v  fcid101vgcid101u  0
dfu  gv  dfcid101u  gcid101v  0 since the constant term in h2
holds for some k cid54 0 A necessary condition for this is
is positive again by 27 To obtain a sucient condition
we have to calculate the minimum of h2 as before ie
The minimum value of h2 is
2m  
min  h2k2
2m  2
dfu  gv  dfcid101u  gcid101v

fugv  fvgu  fugcid101v  fcid101vgu  fcid101ugv  fvgcid101u  fcid101ugcid101v  fcid101vgcid101u  dfu  gv  dfcid101u  gcid101v2
cid21
In summary the steady state has to be linearly stable
if no diusion is present which means that all roots of
26 have negative real part but instability appears when
diusion is added which means that the polynomial in
28 has to have at least one root with positive real part
Hence for Turing instability in the coupled system 25
one of the following sets of conditions has to be satised
29a or 29b

where the rst line comes from the linear stability con-
dition hence they are the same in both cases and the
other two lines are derived from the diusion-driven in-
stability conditions
APPENDIX III CELLULAR MODELS
Here we present the details of the implementation of
the cellular models presented in Figure 5 We consider
1D 2D and 3D cellular models In all cases we solved
Eqs 1-2 but with some terms restricted to certain
subdomains as specied below All equations were solved
on the same mesh
1D Cellular Models
We use a 1D domain comprising N subdomains of
equal length Fig 5b On every subdomain the set
of Eqs
1-2 is solved Ligand L can diuse freely
in the entire domain while receptor R is restricted to
each subdomain by no-ux boundary conditions Ligand
exchange between subdomains is obtained by enforcing
continuous ligand proles across the borders of the sub-
domains ie by requiring that the ligand value L on
the right hand side boundary of subdomain i is the same
as the ligand value L on the left hand side boundary of
subdomain i  1
2D Cellular Models
We use a 2D square domain containing N  N equal
sized subdomains of square shape The subdomains nei-
ther intersect nor overlap Fig 5b The following set of
PDEs is dened on this 2D domain

where C represents the N  N array of rectangular cel-
lular subdomains and EC refers to the rest of the 2D
domain representing the extracellular space
3D Cellular Models
We use a 3D domain Fig
5b containing N 
N  1 non-overlapping spheres that are embedded into
a cuboid The following set of PDEs describes the lig-
and and receptor dynamics on the surface of the spheres
referred to as C

where cid126n is the outward normal vector The volume inside
the spheres ie the cell interior is not included in the
simulations because we do not consider ligand or receptor

APPENDIX IV NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF
PDES WITH COMSOL
The partial dierential equations were solved in COM-
SOL Multiphysics 4x as described previously 63 64 79
COMSOL Multiphysics has previously been used to ac-
curately solve a variety of reaction-diusion equations
which originate from chemical biological and engineering
applications 32 8490 In the following we present two
tests for the numerical accuracy of the solution of Turing
type models obtained with COMSOL Multiphysics
F Accuracy of the Turing space
We rst test whether we obtain the same Turing space
numerically and analytically To this end we use Eq
region or an unstable steady state both in the presence
and absence of diusion blue region

a range of nite element meshes with the maximum size
of the mesh size in the range from 001 to 01 Figure 9B
shows that the maximum deviation in the solution de-
creases quadratically with respect to the maximum mesh
size or equivalently decreases linearly with respect to the
maximum mesh edge as expected for FEM with rst or-
der Lagrange elements These tests support the previous
observations by others that COMSOL Multyphysics can
solve Turing-type equations accurately
