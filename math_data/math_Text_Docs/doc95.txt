Abstract
We study the thermodynamic consequences of a recently proposed description
for a Schwarzschild black hole based on Euclidean D3 D3  D3 D3 brane pairs
described in terms of chain-like excitations A discrete mass-spectrum of Bekenstein-
type is inferred and upon identication of the black hole mass with the chains energy
the leading corrections to both Hawking-temperature and specic heat of the black
hole are obtained The results indicate that for small black holes the evaporation
process will be considerably altered

1 Introduction
It has been argued 1 quite early that Quantum Gravity should give an equidistant dis-
crete spectrum for the horizon area of a black hole The logic being that the horizon area
represents an adiabatic invariant which leads to a discrete spectrum upon quantisation
with Bohr-Sommerfeld rules Using the fact that for a neutral non-rotating Schwarzschild
black hole the horizon area AH is related to its mass MBH via its Schwarzschild radius
rS  2G4MBH  one obtains consequently the discrete Bekenstein mass-spectrum
MBH 
N  N  N
for the black hole Such a spectrum has now been discussed and derived in many dierent
ways 2 3 4 In some approaches to a quantum treatment of black holes like eg the
reduced phase space quantisation method 4 5 this mass-spectrum gets augmented by
an additional zero-point energy This becomes important if one addresses the ultimate
fate of the evaporating black hole but otherwise can safely be ignored for macroscopic
black holes for which N will be extremely large
The discreteness of the mass-spectrum implies a drastic departure from the thermal
Hawking radiation spectrum 3 Indeed energy can only be radiated o a macroscopic
black hole at frequencies which are integer multiples of   M 2
P lMBH and are thus in
principle observable at energies much lower than the Planck-scale By detecting such
quanta at various energies one might be able to distinguish experimentally between dif-
ferent approaches on how to quantise gravity For instance Loop Quantum Gravity 6
predicts also a discrete area-spectrum which is however not equispaced 7
Here we want to focus on a recent approach which has its roots in String-Theory and
in which the microscopic black hole states get identied with long chains living on the
worldvolume of two dual Euclidean brane pairs 8 9 We will show that this approach
leads directly to a discrete Bekenstein mass-spectrum for the D4 Schwarzschild black
hole as well Moreover upon identication of the chains energy with the black holes
mass we will be able to derive within this approach the leading corrections to the black
holes Hawking temperature and its specic heat while the leading terms will coincide
with the standard results for Hawking-temperature and specic heat known from black
hole thermodynamics For this coincidence it is important that in the chain approach the
chains entropy is determined unambiguously in terms of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
ie there is no ambiguity resulting from an undetermined proportionality constant in this
relation
Following the proposal of 8 for the counting of microstates of D4 spacetimes pos-
sessing event horizons with spherical boundary S2
H more precisely the boundary of the
black hole S2
H is dened as the intersection of the future event horizon H with a partial
Cauchy surface ending at spatial innity I 0 one has to introduce a doublet of Euclidean
In each pair Ei and Mi are orthogonal to each
dual brane pairs E1 M1  E2 M2
other and wrap together S2
H plus the whole internal compact space 6-dimensional for
type II String-Theory resp 7-dimensional for M-Theory In the low-energy limit where
supergravity is valid E1 M1E2 M2 acting as sources lead to a unique D1011 back-
ground solution of D1011 supergravity The D4 spacetime mentioned above is then
identied with the D4 external part of the D1011 background solution Thus starting
from type II String-Theory it was argued in 10 that for uncharged Schwarzschild black
holes one needs a doublet E1 M1  E1 M 1 consisting of a dual brane pair and its anti-
brane equivalent This conguration has no charges Moreover to get a non-dilatonic
black hole one should take E1  M1  D3 which is the only non-dilatonic Dp-brane
Further evidence for the identication of the doublet D3 D3  D3 D3 with a D4
Schwarzschild black hole was given in 10
2 Chains From Branes
H  We will next wrap a Euclidean D3 around S2
Let us now explain as a specic example of the more general proposal made in 8 the
connection between the aforementioned Euclidean branes chain states and the entropy of
the D4 Schwarzschild black hole We will start with type IIB String-Theory on a ten-
dimensional Lorentzian manifold M13T 6 ie a torus compactication from ten to four
dimensions It will be convenient to think of the T 6 as the product T 2  T 4 Moreover we
will choose for M13 the standard Schwarzschild metric solution and denote the boundary
H  T 2 and
of the D4 black hole by S2
another one around the remaining internal T 4 For technical reasons in order to avoid a
mismatch overall factor of two in the derivation of the entropy and for physical reasons
neutral ie uncharged black holes can only be obtained from brane-antibrane pairs whose
Ramond-Ramond RR charge cancels we have to wrap in exactly the same way another
D3 around S2
H  T 2 and a second D3 around T 4 Evidence that indeed the backreaction
of this Euclidean brane pair doublet can generate a D10 background including in its
external part the D4 Schwarzschild metric was given in 10 The background as well as
the brane conguration breaks all supersymmetry and can alternatively be characterized
as a black D6-brane in its ultra non-extreme limit
In this limit the black D6-brane
looses its magnetic RR 2-form charge while the dilaton becomes constant thus giving a
non-dilatonic vacuum solution
Following 8
it is then easy to see that for this set-up of Euclidean branes the
Bekenstein-Hawking BH entropy of the D4 Schwarzschild black hole can be expressed
purely in terms of the Nambu-Goto actions SD3 SD3 of the two brane pairs as
SBH 
 SD3S 2T 2SD3T 4  SD3S 2T 2SD3T 4 
The crucial point now is to think of the tension D3 of a Euclidean D3-brane as the
inverse of a fundamental smallest volume unit vD3
which is an interpretation more adapt to a Euclidean brane as it treats all worldvolume
dimensions equally as opposed to an interpretation as a mass per unit volume which
allocates a special role to the time-direction This interpretation of a branes tension
follows also from the brane worldvolume uncertainty relation 13 as explained in 14
15 Consequently a Euclidean D3-brane or likewise the D3-antibrane can be thought
of as a lattice made out of cells with volume vD3 The number ND3 of such cells is then
precisely measured by the branes Nambu-Goto action
ND3  D3Z d4xpdet g 
Volume of Euclidean D3
and similarly for ND3 Therefore the D4 Schwarzschild black holes BH-entropy becomes
simply an integer N  N
SBH  ND3S 2T 2ND3T 4  ND3S 2T 2ND3T 4  N
which stands for the total number of cells contained in the combined worldvolume of the
D3 D3  D3 D3 doublet
In order to derive the black holes BH-entropy by counting an appropriate set of
microstates it was then proposed in 8 to consider long chains2 composed out of N  1
links on the N cell worldvolume lattice formed by the D3 D3  D3 D3 doublet A
quantum-mechanical a Gibbs-correction factor was included to account for the quantum

model elds in warped backgrounds 17
mechanical indistinguishability of the bosonic cells counting then delivered an entropy
for the chains

By virtue of the identication 5 the chains living on the black holes horizon thus exhibit
an entropy

and are therefore good candidates to explain both the black holes BH-entropy and the
known logarithmic corrections 11 12 thereof Note that the factor multiplying the
logarithm is 12 in accordance with the results of 12
3 Bekenstein Mass Spectrum and Temperature
Let us now see what black hole mass spectrum follows from this proposal By expressing
SBH for a Schwarzschild black hole in terms of its mass MBH
SBH  4G4M 2
one infers from the discreteness of the entropy 5 that the black holes mass-spectrum
becomes discrete quantized as well
MBH N 
4G4
and turns out to be precisely of Bekenstein-type This coincidence is interesting because
to arrive at this result we have only used the geometrical interpretation of the branes
tension as the inverse of a smallest volume unit while its standard derivation uses the
argument that the black holes horizon area behaves as an adiabatic invariant and can
therefore be quantized according to the Bohr-Sommerfeld rule 1 Notice also that our
derivation did not require the notion of the chains yet
Before proceeding let us note that there is a very interesting observation related to the
Bekenstein spectrum 9 As pointed out rst in 3 this type of mass-spectrum oers an
experimental verication well below the Planck-scale For microscopically small Planck-
sized black holes with N not much bigger than one the energy radiated o the hole when
jumping down from one energy level to the next is of order the Planck-scale
EN  MBH N  MBH N  1 
4G4  MP l 
However when one considers macroscopically large black holes for which N  1 then a
level jump is accompanied by an energy-loss M denotes the mass of the sun
EN 
4G4N
 13  1010 M
which can be considerably smaller than Planck-scale and therefore possibly detectable
For instance primordial black holes with a lifetime of order the present age of the universe
have a mass MBH  25  1019M and would emit quanta at an energy of EN  05
Let us now come to the chains and examine their temperature in a microcanonical
ensemble approach To this end we have to determine the chains energy which would
ideally follow from a microscopic Hamiltonian governing its dynamics As this is still
largely unknown we will proceed dierently Since we know that at a microscopic level
in the approach proposed in 8 the black hole resolves into a chain what an observer at
spacelike innity measures as the black holes mass MBH is nothing else but the chains
energy Ec We are therefore led to identify Ec with MBH at leading order in 1N
Moreover we expect that there could be subleading corrections in this identication at
relative level 1N For instance we know that a fundamental string at very high excitation
level n  1 can be thought of as a random walk 18 and becomes therefore very similar to
a chain Therefore as for the string whose energy E  n  c  n1  c2n O1n2
c being a constant of O1 depending on the type of string one is considering receives
subleading corrections at order 1n we would expect that also the chain energy might
receive similar corrections3 We will therefore write a being a constant

Knowing the energy and entropy for the chain then allows us to determine the chains
temperature Tc in a microcanonical ensemble approach

where we regard N as a quasi-continuous parameter By using the Bekenstein mass-
spectrum for the black hole the chain temperature can be expressed through the holes
3Corrections of relative order 1n n  N are also known to arise in other approaches which treat
the black holes area like a harmonic oscillator and consequently obtain a zero-point correction AH 
n  12 for the horizon area which translates into a 14n correction for MBH 
mass as

is the Hawking-temperature of the Schwarzschild black hole Thus the chains temperature
will equal the Hawking temperature for large N which was actually clear from the fact
that at leading order the chains energy and entropy coincide with the standard black
hole entities but will in general deviate from it the more the smaller N becomes and
therefore the smaller the black holes mass MBH becomes This clearly indicates that the
black holes evaporation process will be considerably altered as compared to the standard
view once the black hole becomes suciently small
Indeed the rst and the second
term on the rhs of 14 show opposing dependences on MBH such that if a  12 the
chains temperature will diverge already at some nite MBH value as opposed to MBH  0
predicted by the Hawking-temperature formula alone As long as this feature is not altered
but sustained by even higher order corrections notice that the second term in 14 is of
order M 2
BH as compared to the 1TH term and therefore shows that it becomes
important close to the Planck regime where all the higher order contributions suppressed
so far become important as well it indicates that the chains free energy Fc  Ec  TcSc
actually diverges at this nite MBH value as well thus signalling a phase transition This
nourishes hope that puzzles like the black hole information puzzle might be completely
avoided in this framework if one takes corrections to the standard black hole results into
account

4 The Specic Heat
Let us now similarly explore the black holes specic heat It is a characteristic feature of
the Schwarzschild black hole to possess a negative specic heat From the laws of black
hole thermodynamics this is known to be
CBH  8G4M 2
Once more we expect to reproduce this result at leading order as here the chain and
the black hole energy and temperature coincide However again there will be non-trivial
corrections to the leading order standard black hole result
For a microcanonical ensemble of chains one obtains with 12 and 13 the specic
 2N  3  4a  Ocid16 1
Ncid17 
Using 9 this can be expressed in terms of the black holes mass as
Cc  8
 3  4a  Ocid16 M 2
BHcid17 
P lM 2
Again the chains specic heat coincides with the standard black hole result at leading
order but deviates from it at rather small black hole masses as the rst correction term
3  4a is of order M 2
BH relative to the leading order term Depending on whether
a  34 or a  34 the specic heat would either be negative for all masses thus pointing
towards some unstoppable instability or would become zero already at some nite mass
value MBH close to the Planck scale under the premise that even higher order corrections
do not spoil this result Therefore in contrast to the leading order result 16 which
implies an instability down to the last stages of the black hole evaporation process the
inclusion of the correction term indicates in the case of a  34 that at some small but
nite mass the black holes evaporation might cease and a stable state be reached as the
specic heat becomes positive here It would therefore be clearly interesting to understand
the dynamics of the chain in detail in order to get a rigorous understanding of the nal
stages of the black hole evaporation
