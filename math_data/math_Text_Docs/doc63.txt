Abstract
Hawking radiation emanating from two-dimensional charged and uncharged dila-
tonic black holes - dimensionally reduced from 2  1 spinning and spinless re-
spectively BTZ black holes - is viewed as a tunnelling process Two dimensional
dilatonic black holes AdS2 included are treated as dynamical backgrounds in con-
trast to the standard methodology where the background geometry is xed when
evaluating Hawking radiation This modication to the geometry gives rise to a
nonthermal part in the radiation spectrum Nonzero temperature of the extremal
two-dimensional charged black hole is found The Bekenstein-Hawking area formula
is easily derived for these dynamical geometries

Introduction
In 1992 Banados Teitelboim and Zanelli BTZ 1 2 showed that 2  1-dimensional
gravity has a black hole solution This black hole is described by two parameters its
mass M and its angular momentum spin J It is locally anti-de-Sitter space and thus
it diers from Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions in that it is asymptotically anti-de-Sitter
instead of at Additionally it has no curvature singularity at the origin AdS black holes
which are members of the two-parametric family of BTZ black holes play a central role
in AdSCFT conjecture 3 4 and also in brane-world scenarios 5 6 Specically AdS2
black hole is most interesting in the context of string theory and black hole physics 7 8
In this paper motivated by this recent interest in two-dimensional black hole backgrounds
we treat the two-dimensional charged and uncharged dilatonic black holes including
AdS2 as radiating sources
Concerning the quantum process called Hawking eect 9 much work has been done
using a xed background during the emission process The idea of Keski-Vakkuri Kraus
and Wilczek KKW 10 11 12 13 is to view the black hole background as dynamical
by treating the Hawking radiation as a tunnelling process The energy conservation is
the key to this description The total ADM mass is kept xed while the mass of the
two-dimensional dilatonic black hole decreases due to the emitted radiation The eect
of this modication gives rise to additional terms in the formulae concerning the known
results for the two-dimensional charged and uncharged black holes these additions are
analogous to those found in 14 15 16 17 for the respective geometries a nonthermal
partner to the thermal spectrum of the Hawking radiation shows up We explore the
consequences to vacuum states of two-dimensional black holes extremal black holes since
black holes are in general regarded as highly excited states The extremality of the two-
dimensional charged black holes is now shifted since the charge J of the charged black hole
is approached by the mass M earlier This alteration produces a non -frozen extremal
two-dimensional charged black hole characterized by a constant Hawking temperature
H 6 0  KKW method provides an easy way to derive the entropy of the two-dimensional
charged and uncharged black holes
In section 1 we make a short review of the two-dimensional charged and uncharged dila-
tonic black holes and their properties We present for the two-dimensional charged black
hole expressions for its temperature area and entropy The extremal two-dimensional
charged black hole is derived and its zero temperature is veried In section 2 we imple-
ment the KKW method Using the imaginary part of the action of an outgoing positive-
energy particle the temperature of the two-dimensional charged black hole is evaluated
and its dependence on the energy of the emitted massless particle is explicitly shown This
modied temperature due to the self-gravitation eect leads to a nonthermal spectrum
The extremal vacuum state two-dimensional charged black hole is no more frozen Its
temperature is nonzero Corresponding results for the two-dimensional uncharged black
holes and for the AdS2 spacetime are deduced In section 3 we calculate the entropy of
two-dimensional charged and uncharged black holes Finally in section 4 we summarize
our results and give our conclusions
1 1  1 Dilatonic Black Holes
The black hole solutions of Banados Teitelboim and Zanelli in 2  1 spacetime dimen-
sions are derived from a three dimensional theory of gravity
S Z dx3g 3R  2
with a negative cosmological constant   0 The corresponding line element is

4r2cid19 dt2 
cid0M  r2  J 2

dtcid192
There are many ways to reduce the three dimensional BTZ black hole solutions to the
two dimensional charged and uncharged dilatonic black holes 18 19 The Kaluza-Klein
reduction of the 2  1-dimensional metric 2 yields a two-dimensional line element

with M the ADM mass J the charge of the two-dimensional charged black hole a U1

and a dilaton eld
At  
For the positive mass black hole spectrum with charge J 6 0 the line element 3 has
two horizons

with r r the outer and inner horizon respectively The area AH and Hawking temper-
ature TH of the event outer horizon are 20 21

The entropy of the two-dimensional charged black hole is
and if we reinstate the Planck units 8G  1 we get
Sbh  4r
4GAH  SBH
which is the well-known Bekenstein-Hawking area formula for the entropy SBH  23 24
25 or 26 by counting excited states
Concerning the extremality of the two-dimensional charged black hole

the inner and outer horizon coincide r  r This two-dimensional charged black hole
can be viewed as the vacuum state of the positive mass spectrum of two-dimensional
charged black holes which saturates the bound
M 2  J 2  0  M

imposed in 7 Obviously the extremal two-dimensional charged black hole has zero
temperature T ext
The two-dimensional uncharged black hole may be obtained by a similar Kaluza-Klein
reduction for a covariantly constant electric eld and the resulting metric is
H  0
which has an horizon at
ds2  cid0M  r2cid1 dt2 cid0M  r2cid11
and is similar to Schwarzschild black hole with the important dierence that it is not
asymptotically at but it has constant negative curvature The temperature of the two-
dimensional uncharged black hole is 22
Two-dimensional charged black holes with M  J are discarded since they contain
a naked singularity and for the same reason two-dimensional uncharged black holes with
M  0 have not been treated above The only exception is the two-dimensional uncharged
black hole with M  1 and J  0 which is the ordinary anti-de Sitter spacetime AdS2
black hole
2 KKW Methodology
In order to apply the idea of Keski-Vakkuri Kraus and Wilczek KKW 10 11 12 13 to
the two-dimensional charged black hole 3-4 we have to make a coordinate transforma-
tion We choose the Painleve coordinates 27 utilized for black hole backgrounds recently
in 28 which are non-singular on the outer horizon r Thus we will be able to deal
with phenomena whose main contributions come from the outer horizon We introduce
the time coordinate P by imposing the ansatz
pgr dt pgr dP r1  M  r2 
The line element 3-4 is now written as 
ds2  cid18M  r2 
4r2cid19 d 2
P  2r1  M  r2 
dP dr  dr2
It is obvious from the above expression that there is no singularity at the points r and
r The null ds2  0 geodesics followed by a massless particle are
r 
 1 r1  M  r2 
where the signs  and  correspond to the outgoing and ingoing geodesics respectively
under the assumption that P increases towards future
We x the total ADM mass and we let the mass M of the two-dimensional charged black
hole vary If a shell of energy mass  is radiated outwards the outer horizon then the
two-dimensional charged black hole mass will be reduced to M   and the shell of energy
will travel on the modied geodesics
r  1 r1  M    r2 
produced by the modied line element
ds2  cid18M    r2 
4r2cid19 d 2
P 2r1  M    r2 
dP drdr2 21
It is known that the emission rate from a radiating source can be expressed in terms of
the imaginary part of the action for an outgoing positive-energy particle as
  e2ImS
but also in terms of the temperature and the entropy of the radiating source which in our
case will be a two-dimensional charged black hole
  e  eS bh
where  is the inverse temperature of the two-dimensional charged black hole and S bh
is the change the entropy of the two-dimensional charged black hole before and after the
emission of the shell of energy  outgoing massless particle It is clear that if we evaluate
the action then we will know the temperature andor the change in the entropy of the
two-dimensional charged black hole We therefore evaluate the imaginary part of the
action for an outgoing positive-energy particle which crosses the event horizon outwards

The imaginary part of the action is

where the minus sign is due to the Hamiltonian being equal to the modied mass H

Apparently the emission rate depends not only on the mass M and charge J of the two-
dimensional charged black hole but also on the energy  of the emitted massless particle

Comparing 23 and 29 we deduce that the modied temperature due to the self-
gravitation of the two-dimensional charged black hole is

We see that there are modications to the result previously mentioned 9 for a xed two-
dimensional charged black hole background The temperature of the two-dimensional
charged black hole is no longer the Hawking temperature TH 
1  1 Charged Black Hole
Concerning the extremal vacuum solution two-dimensional charged black hole the con-
dition for extremality now satised will be
M    J 
This modication indicates that the mass M of the two-dimensional charged black hole
cannot be less than the charge J since   M  J  0 and the temperature of the
extremal two-dimensional charged black hole will not be zero but

The modied temperature 30 for the two-dimensional uncharged black hole becomes

in agreement to what was shown in 15
For the case M  1 which may be recognized as the ordinary anti-de-Sitter space
AdS2 spacetime the modied temperature is

3 Entropy Calculation via KKW Method
It is obvious that we can have a short and direct derivation of the entropy of two-
dimensional charged black hole up to a constant using equations 22 and 23 where
Indeed if we combine 22 23 and 30 we get
S bh  SbhM   J  SbhM J
Sbh M J  4M   pM  2  J 2
where S0 is the arbitrary constant and which to rst order in  will give the known
expression 10 up to a constant for the entropy of the two-dimensional charged black
SbhM J  4cid20 M  M 2  J 2
cid21
For the two-dimensional uncharged black hole the entropy is
SbhM  4r M  
 S 
where S 
0 is also an arbitrary constant and which will give to rst order in 
SbhM  4rM
 S 
If we adopt the conjecture that the entropy of an excited state tends to the entropy of its
vacuum state 29 then the additive constants are set to zero 
and S 
0  0 
Discussion
In this work we have viewed the Hawking radiation as a quantum tunnelling process The
self-gravitation of the radiation was included and this treatment introduced a nonthermal
part for the radiation spectrum of the two-dimensional charged and uncharged dilatonic
black holes The temperature of the two-dimensional charged black hole is no more
the Hawking temperature and the greybody factor showing up declares explicitly the
dependence of the temperature on the emitted particles energy  The leading term in
 gives the thermal Boltzmann factor while the higher order terms represent corrections
emanating from the response of the background geometry to the emission of a quantum
The extremal two-dimensional charged black hole is no more frozen but it carries a
background Hawking temperature T ext
H 6 0 ensuring the validity of the third law of black
hole thermodynamics 30 Therefore it is obvious that we again have a strong evidence to
believe that black holes constitute excited states while the extremal black holes correspond
to ground vacuum states
The above-mentioned treatment for incorporating the eects of the emission of a
shell of energy for the case of two-dimensional uncharged dilatonic black holes including
AdS2 black hole yields the corresponding modied temperature with the leading term
in  again being the thermal Boltzmann factor
Additionally the imaginary part of the action of the outgoing positive-energy particle is
linear in the change of the entropy We derive in a short and direct way the modied
entropy for the two-dimensional charged and uncharged dilatonic black holes due to the
specic modelling of the self-gravitation eect A welcomed but not unexpected result is
that the expressions for the entropy of the two-dimensional dilatonic black holes obtained
to rst order in  are in agreement with those for the corresponding xed two-dimensional
black hole backgrounds
