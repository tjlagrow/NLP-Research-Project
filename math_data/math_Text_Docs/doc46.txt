The recent work of Nation et al in which Hawking radiation energy and entropy ow from a black hole can be
regarded as a one-dimensional 1D Landauer transport process is extended to the case of a Reissner-Nordstrom
RN black hole It is found that the ow of charge current can also be transported via a 1D quantum channel
except the current of Hawking radiation The maximum entropy current which is shown to be particle statistics
independence is also obtained

INTRODUCTION
Hawking radiation from a black hole is an eternal topic in theoretical physics because it provides not only a clue to detect
black holes but also a platform to research the quantum gravity Since the rst proposal of Hawking 1 2 that a black hole
can emit radiation in the curved space time background there are many methods to derive it 39 Now it is believed that
Hawking radiation arises from the production of virtual particle pairs spontaneously near the inner of horizon due to the vacuum
uctuation When the negative energy virtual particle tunnels inwards the positive energy virtual particle materializes as a real
particle and escapes to innity 1021 But how does the positive energy particle run Recently Nation et al 22 gave a model
where the positive energy particle escapes to innity via a 1D quantum channel The key idea there was that the black hole
and vacuum can be viewed as two thermal reservoirs connected by a single 1D quantum channel As the scattering eect was
ignored Hawking radiation ow rate was obtained using Landauer transport model which is shown to be equal to the energy-
momentum tensor expectation value of an innite observer as the left and right are regarded as the black hole and the thermal
environment with absolute temperature zero surrounding the black hole They also found that the upper limits of entropy current
were same for both bosons or fermions
In this letter we would like to extend this idea to study Hawking radiation of charged particles from a RN black hole When
the near horizon conformal symmetry is considered the expectation value of electric current ow must be investigated except
the ow of energy-momentum tensor due to the existence of electromagnetic eld In Landauer transport model the ow of
charge current must also be considered besides the energy and entropy ows In the letter we use the units G    c  kB  1

The concrete values of above equations have been given in Refs25 26 where the boundary conditions are invoked
order to get Hawking radiation ux we must use boundary conditions as Unruh eect in the Unruh vacuum In the advanced
Eddington coordinate there is a nite mount of ux at the horizon while no ux at innity Meanwhile in the retarded Eddington
coordinate there is no ux at the horizon while a nite mount of ux at innity For observers in the Kruskal coordinate the
relation JU

III HAWKING RADIATION FROM LANDAUER TRANSPORT MODEL
The Landauer transport model was rst proposed to study electrical transport in mesoscopic circuits and subsequently used
to describe thermal transport In 2000 the phononic quantized thermal conductance counterpart was measured for the rst time
29 For the 1D quantum channel of thermal conductance it is supposed that there are two thermal reservoirs characterized by
the temperatures TL TR and chemical potentials uL uR where subscripts L and R denote the left and right thermal reservoirs
respectively They are coupled adiabatically through an eective 1D connection Because of the temperature dierence the
thermal transportation will happen Typically a wire will provide several available parallel channels for the given values of
chemical potential and temperature For the sake of simplicity in the present investigation we restrict only to ballistic transport
which means the channel currents do not interfere with each other 22 Universally there are several distribution functions and
here we adopt the Haldanes statistics 30
where the function x satises the relation

in which g  0 g  1 correspond bosons and fermions respectively

 As done in Ref22 we dene the zero level of energy with respect to the longitudinal component of
the kinetic energy The total energy and entropy currents are then just E  EL  ER S  S L  S R We rst consider the case of
fermions namely g  1 According to the viewpoint of Landauer the maximum energy ow rate of fermions can be treated as
the combination of fermionic particle and antiparticle single channel currents As x 
are dened the ow of
energy therefore can be expressed as

To get the nal value we rst vary the lower limit of integral that is

According to the technique of Landau 31 the convergence rate of
be changed as innity So we get the nal value of the energy current

hence can

As the left and right are regarded as the RN black hole and the thermal environment with absolute temperature zero surrounding
the black hole respectively we nd

in which uR  0 and uL 
conformal symmetry
are used Obviously this result agrees with the energy-momentum tensor ux obtained by
For the entropy ow in Eq22 the value is independent on the chemical potential and it depends only on the lower limit of
integral We can get its maximum value after calculating S  Th
TL   As the maximum energy
and entropy current expressions are combined by eliminating TL the relation S 2   E
3  which was proved to be universal for
1D quantum channels with arbitrary reservoir temperatures chemical potentials and particle statistics 22 32 33 also can be
reproduced

Thinking of the transportation of charge via the 1D quantum channel the current ow from left with higher chemical potential
u to right without scattering can be expressed as 32

For the case of fermions the contribution of antiparticle also should be considered we have

Th  1 is the radiation spectrum of fermions at the event horizon Finishing the integral we obtain
I

which is consistent with the value of charge current ow at the event horizon in Eq15 Namely the gauge ux with respect to
electric charge of the RN space time also can be transported via the 1D quantum channel
Now we check whether the Landauer transport model is valid for the bosons Putting g  0 into Eq19 and Eq20 the
energy current can be expressed as
After varying the lower limit of integral and adopting

Adopting the similar technique as done in the case of fermions where uLR
TLR  0 can be produced the second term of above
equation can be integrated easily When the the left and right are treated as the RN black hole and thermal environment with
absolute temperature zero we nd
t rh
This result also agrees with the energy-momentum tensor ux observed by the innite observers in Eq17 For a boson the
maximum value of entropy ow S  Th
6  and the charge current ow can also be reproduced by adopting similar skills as the
case of fermions
IV DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Flows of Hawking radiation energy and charge current from a RN black hole are investigated using a 1D quantum transport
model which are shown to be consistent with the vacuum expectation values of energy-momentum tensor and gauge ux
The maximum value of entropy ow in dierent degeneration is obtained and the result is independent on the statistics For
ows of energy and charge current of fermions we get the same result as that of bosons when the contribution of antiparticle
is considered which conrms the viewpoint of Davies 33 that the fermionic eld describing a massless particle plus its
antiparticle is equivalent to a single massless bosonic eld in a 11-dimensional curved spacetime
Note that when we investigate the ow of fermions and bosons using Landauer transport model the condition uLR
TLR  0 should
be imposed in both of them In statistics physics this condition should be satised in order to avoid the degeneration of boson
distribution and fermion distribution to the Boltzmann distribution
As the rst law of black hole thermodynamics and energy conservation are considered one also can get the net entropy
34 in the two dimensional space time Because of the existence of electromagnetic eld
production rate dened as R  dS
we nd the production rate of RN black hole is smaller than the case of Schwarzschild black hole with R  2
