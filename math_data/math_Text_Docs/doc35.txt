Scaling limits for Hawkes processes and application
to nancial statistics
E Bacry S Delattre M Homann and JF Muzy
Abstract
We prove a law of large numbers and a functional central limit
theorem for multivariate Hawkes processes observed over a time in-
terval 0 T  in the limit T   We further exhibit the asymptotic
behaviour of the covariation of the increments of the components of
a multivariate Hawkes process when the observations are imposed by
a discrete scheme with mesh  over 0 T  up to some further time
shift   The behaviour of this functional depends on the relative size
of  and  with respect to T and enables to give a full account of
the second-order structure As an application we develop our results
in the context of nancial statistics We introduced in 17 a micro-
scopic stochastic model for the variations of a multivariate nancial
asset based on Hawkes processes and that is conned to live on a tick
grid We derive and characterise the exact macroscopic diusion limit
of this model and show in particular its ability to reproduce important
empirical stylised fact such as the Epps eect and the lead-lag eect
Moreover our approach enable to track these eects across scales in
rigorous mathematical terms

Introduction
11 Motivation and setting
Point processes have long served as a representative model for event-time
based stochastic phenomena that evolve in continuous time A compre-
hensive mathematical development of the theory of point processes can be
found in the celebrated textbook of Daley and Vere-Jones 8 see also the
references therein In this context mutually exciting processes form a spe-
cic but quite important class of point processes that are mathematically
tractable and widely used in practice They were rst described by Hawkes
in 1971 13 12 and according to 8 Hawkes processes gure widely in
applications of point processes to seismology neurophysiology epidemiol-
ogy and reliability One reason for their versatility and popularity is that
they combine in one model both a cluster process representation and a sim-
ple conditional intensity representation which is moreover linear It comes
closest to fullling for point processes the kind of role that the autoregres-
sive model plays for conventional time series Informally to a multivariate
d-dimensional counting process N  N1     Nd with values in Nd is asso-
ciated an intensity function 1     d dened by
where P stands for probability and Ft is the sigma-eld generated by N up
to present time t A multivariate Hawkes process has intensity

and is specied by i  R  0 and for i  1     d the ij are
functions from R to R More in Section 2 below for rigorous denitions
The properties of Hawkes processes are fairly well known from a prob-
abilistic point a view the aforementioned book of Daley and Vere-Jones 8
gives a concise synthesis of earlier results published by Hawkes 13 12 14
that focus on spectral analysis following Bartlett 4 and cluster representa-
tion see Hawkes and Oakes 15 From a statistical perspective Ogata stud-
ied in 25 the maximum likelihood estimator and showed that parametric
experiments generated by the observation of Hawkes processes are regular
in the sense of Fisher information see for instance 9 for a modern formu-
lation of statistical regularity Ogata also studied the numerical issue of
exact simulation of Hawkes processes 26 and this topic has known several
developments since see 22 for a review Recently the nonparametric esti-
mation of the intensity functions has been investigated by Reynaud-Bouret
and Schbath 27 and Al Dayri et al 3 in dimension d  1
However in all these papers and the references therein the focus is on
the microscopic properties of Hawkes processes ie their innitesimal
evolution possibly under a stationary regime or for a large time horizon
0 T  in order to guarantee a large number of jumps for statistical inference
purposes In the present work we are rather interested in the macroscopic
properties of Hawkes processes in the sense of obtaining a limit behaviour
for the multivariate process NT vv01 as T   for a suitable normal-
isation Our interest originates in nancial data modelling in 17 we in-
troduced a stochastic model for the price S  S1     Sn of a multivariate
asset based on a d  2n dimensional Hawkes process of the form 1 with
representation
S1  N1  N2 S2  N3  N4     Sn  Nd1  Nd
In this context the fact that the Si take values on Z accounts for the discret-
ness of the price formation under a limit order book If we take 2i1  2i
for every 1  i  d the process S is centred and the mutually exciting
properties of the intensity processes i under 1 allow to reproduce em-
pirically microstructure noise and the Epps eect as demonstrated in 17
Microstructure noise  a major stylised fact in high frequency nancial data
see eg 10 23 24 28 29 21  is characterised by the property that in
microscopic scales1 an upward change of price for the component Si is more
likely to be followed by a downward jumps of Si and vice versa Similarly
a jump of a component N2i1 or N2i of Si at time t will increase the con-
ditional probability given the history up to time t that a jump occurs for
the component N2j1 or N2j of Sj through the exciting eect of the kernels
2i12j1 2i12j 2i2j1 or 2i2i thus creating a certain dependence
structure and the Epps eect another well-document stylised fact implying
that the empirical correlation bewteen two assets vanishes on microscopic
scales 11 However both microstructure noise and the Epps eect vanish
at coarser scales where a standard diusion regime dominates Thus a cer-
tain macroscopic stability property is desirable namely the property that
S behaves like a continuous diusion on coarse scales Also one would like
to be able to track the aforementioned microscopic eects produced by the
kernels ij in the diusion limit of S This is the main topic of the paper
1when the data are sampled every few seconds or less
and also its novelty as far as the modelling angle is concerned
The importance of mutually exciting processes has expanded in nancial
econometrics over the last years see 7 5 20 16 among others From a
wider perspective however a mathematical analysis of the limiting behaviour
of Hawkes processes has a relevance beyond nance apart from the interest
of such a study for its own sake one could also presumably apply asymptotic
results in other application elds These include seismology of course for
which Hawkes processes were originally introduced see 31 for instance and
also the citation we used above from the monograph 8 in a more speculative
or prospective way one could mention recent related areas such as trac
networks 6 or genomic analysis 27 where mutually exciting processes take
a growing importance
12 Main results and organisation of the paper
Because of this versatility in the use of Hawkes processes we present our
results in a fairly general setting in Sections 2 3 and 4 with relatively mini-
mal assumptions It is only in the subsequent Section 5 that we consistently
apply our results to the multivariate price model S described by 1-2 for
nancial data modelling
In Section 2 we recall the construction of Hawkes processes in a rigourous
and general setting We state in particular the fact that as soon as the
kernels ij that dene the intensity process  are locally integrable the ex-
istence of N with uniqueness in law is guaranteed on a rich enough space
as follows from the theory of predictable projection of integer-valued ran-
dom measures of Jacod 18 We state in Section 3 a law of large numbers
Theorem 1 and a functional central limit theorem Theorem 2 The law
of large numbers takes the form
v01cid13cid13T 1NT v  v Id  K1cid13cid13  0 as T  
almost surely and in L2P  We set kk for the Euclidean norm on Rd The
limit is described by   1     d identied with a column vector and
the d  d matrix K R 
0 t dt where   ij is a matrix of functions
from R to R The convergence 3 holds under the assumption that the
spectral radius of K is strictly less than 1 which guarantees in particular all
the desirable integrability properties for N  As for a central limit theorem
under the additional condition that t12t is integrable componentwise a
consequence of Theorem 2 is the convergence of the processes

in law for the Skorokod topology The limit is described by a standard d-
dimensional Brownian motion Wvv01 and the d  d diagonal matrix 
dened by ii  cid0Id  K1cid1i The proof of Theorems 1 and 2 relies
on the intensity theory of point processes using that Nt R t
0 s ds is a
d-dimensional martingale if we set Xt  Nt  ENt with E denoting
expectation we then have the fundamental representation
Xt  Mt Z t
t  sXs ds
of X as a sum of a martingale and a convolution product of  with X itself
Separating the two components we can then take advantage of the powerful
theory of limit theorems of semimartingales as exposed in the comprehen-
sive book of Jacod and Shiryaev 19
In Section 4 we consider yet another angle of study that is useful for
applications Given two square integrable point processes N and N  with
value in Nd setting Xt  Nt  ENt and X 
t one can dene
the empirical cross-correlation of N and N  at scale  over 0 T  as

where Xt and X 
t are identied as column vectors and  denotes trans-
position in Rd In rigorous terms VT N N  shall rather be called the
empirical correlation matrix of the increments of X and X  sampled at scale
 over 0 T  This object is of major importance in practice viewed as a
function of  it reveals the correlation structure across scales between N
and N  It is crucial for the understanding of the transition of NT vv01
from a microscopic regime of a point process to the macroscopic behaviour of
a Brownian diusion up to appropriate normalisation as T   More pre-
cisely given a time shift   T  R we focus in the paper on the  -shifted
empirical correlation matrix of N at scale  namely2 VT N N  We

uct of  This apparently cumbersome formula paves the way to explicit
computations that yield crucial information about the dependence structure
of functionals of N  as later developed in the paper

study of the multivariate price model S described by 1-2 for nancial data
modelling We elaborate on particular examples the insight given by v

for d  2 we derive in Proposition 1 the limiting variance of the rescaled

and 11  22  0 This oversimplication enables to focus on the phe-
nomenon of microstructure noise and reveals the macroscopic trace of  in
the variance of the limiting Brownian motion We discuss the theoretical
implications of the obtained formulas in statistical nance In the same way
we explicit in Proposition 2 the macroscopic correlation structure obtained
with a bivariate price process S  S1 S2  N1  N2 N3  N4 when only
cross-excitations 13  31 and 24  24 are considered the other com-
ponents ij being set to 0 for simplicity Again we obtain an illuminating
formula that characterises the inuence of the microscopic dynamics on the
macroscopic correlation of the Brownian limit This enables in particular in
Proposition 3 to demonstrate how Hawkes process can account for the Epps
eect 11 and also the lead-lag eect between two nancial assets that has
been given some attention in the literature recently 30 2 1
Section 6 develops some preliminary tools for the proofs Section 7 8
and 9 are devoted to the proof of Theorems 1 2 and 3 respectively Some
technical results and computations of the application Section 5 are delayed

On a rich enough probability space  F  P  we consider a Hawkes process
N  Ntt0 according to Denition 1 satisfying 5 and specied by the
  1     d
and the d  d-matrix valued function

Note that in this setting we do not assume a stationary regime for N 
Consider the assumption
For all i j we haveR

First we have a law of large numbers in the following sense
Theorem 1 Assume that A1 holds Then Nt  L2P  for all t  0 and
we have
v01cid13cid13T 1NT v  v Id  K1cid13cid13  0 as T  
almost-surely and in L2P 
Next we have an associated functional central-limit theorem Introduce
the functions n dened on R and with values in the set of d d-matrices
with entries in 0 by

Under A1 we haveR

and  is the diagonal matrix such that ii  Id  K1i
Consider now the following restriction on

The empirical covariation across time scales of N and N  is the process
VT N N  T  0   0 taking values in the set of d  d matrices and
dened as

i  X 
i1cid1
wherecid0XiXi1cid1 is identied as a column vector andcid0XiXi1cid1
denotes its transpose and we set Xt  0 for t  0 More precisely given a
time shift   R we are interested in the behaviour of VT N N  In
essence VT N N  can be viewed as a multivariate cross-correlogram
across scales  of N  it can be consistently measured from empirical data
and its limiting behaviour as T   plays a key tool in understanding the
second-order structure of linear functions of N across scales

This convergence simply expresses the fact that the two processes N and
N  cannot jump at the same time producing a at autocorrelogram for
suciently small sampling mesh

5 Application to nancial statistics
51 The macroscopic trace of microstructure noise
Following 17 we introduce a univariate price process S  Stt0 by setting
S  N1  N2
where N1 N2 is a Hawkes process in the case d  2 with

1t   R0t t  sdN2s
2t   R0t t  sdN1s
 cid180 
 0cid19
for some   R and   R  R With our notation this corresponds to
having     and
If   0 we nd back a compund Poisson process with intensity  and
symmetric Bernoulli jumps This corresponds to the simplest model for a
random walk in continuous time constrained to live on a lattice the tick-grid
in nancial statistics accounting for the discreteness of price at n scales
Microstructure noise corresponds to the property that an upward jump of
S will be more likely followed by a downward jump and vice versa This
phenomenon lays its roots in microeconomic analysis of price manipulation
of agents 10 23 24 28 29 21 In our simple phenomenological setting
it will be reproduced by the introduction of the kernel  as empirically
demonstrated in 17 The question we can now address is the macroscopic
stability of the model Do we retrieve a standard diusion in the limit
T   for an approriate scaling of S and how does the eect of  inuence
the macroscopic volatility By Theorems 1 and 2 we readily obtain an
explicit anwser

of a compound Poisson process with symmetric jump to a Brownian motion
Remark 5 By assumption 0  kkL1  1 and a closer inspection of the

for small microstructure eect namely if
x  kkL1 less than 13 the eect of microstructure tends to stabilise the
macroscopic variance in the sense that  x2   02 whereas beyond
a critical value x  061 we have  x2   02 and even  x2

52 Macroscopic correlations for bivariate assets
We now turn to a bivariate price model S  S1 S2 obtained from a Hawkes
process in dimension d  4 of the form
S1 S2  N1  N2 N3  N4
with   1 2 3 4 such that
1  2 and 3  4
together with
 
0 0 h 0
0 0 0 h
0 g 0 0

The upward jumps of S1 excite the intensity of the upward jumps of S2 and
in a symmetric way the downward jumps of S1 excite the downward jumps
of S2 via the kernel g  R  R Likewise the upward jumps of S2 excite
the upward jumps of S1 and the downward jumps of S2 excite the downward
jumps of S1 via the kernel h  R  R For simplicity we ignore other
cross terms that could produce microstructure noise within the inner jumps
of S1 and S2 This relativeley simple dependence structure at a microscopic
level enables to obtain a non-trivial form of the macroscopic correlation of
the diusion limits of S1 and S2
Proposition 2 Assume that khkL1kgkL1  1 The 2-dimensional processes

The proof is a consequence of Theorems 1 and 2 and is given in appendix

53 Lead-lag and Epps eect through the cross correlations
across-scales
We keep up with the model and the notation of Section 52 but we now
study the quantities
VT S1 S1  VT S2 S2  VT S1 S2 
In particular the quantity VT S1 S2  is a powerful tool for the statisti-
cal study of lead-lag eects ie the fact that the jumps of S1 can anticipate
on those of S2 and vice-versa see for instance 1 30 The Epps eect  ie
the stylised fact statement that the correlation between the increments of
two assets vanishes at ne scales  can be tracked down likewise Theorem
3 enables to characterise in principle the limiting behaviour of these func-
tionals This is described in details in Proposition 3 below
We consider g and h as functions dened on R by setting gt  ht  0

C12    0 as   0 for every   R
and this characterises the Epps eect The same argument together with
0  1 yields the convergence

Remark 8 The Lead-Lag eect Following 17 and as a consensus in the
literature we say that a lead-lag eect is present between S1 and S2 if there
exists   0 and  6 0 such that
C12   6 C12 
Therefore an absence of any lead-lag eect is obtained if and only if the
function cid00  F  F  F  Fcid1 cid02h  1gcid1 is even This is the case if
1g  2h Now let   0 If g  h   and 1  3 then
C12   C12    for every   0   R
This particular choice for h and g models in particular the property that S1
acts on S2 in the same manner as S2 acts on S1 with an extra temporal shift
of  Since we always have
 
C12    0
there exists 0 such that C12 0   6 C12 0 or in other words we
have a lead-lag eect
