Abstract
In this paper we extend Parikh work to the non-stationary black hole
As an example of the non-stationary black hole we study the tunnelling
eect and Hawking radiation from a Vaidya black hole whose Bondi mass
is identical to its mass parameter We view Hawking radiation as a tun-
nelling process across the event horizon and calculate the tunnelling prob-
ability We nd that the result is dierent from Parikhs work because
dv is the function of Bondi mass m v

1 Introduction
Steven Hawking made a striking discovery that basic principles of quantum
eld theory lead to the emission of thermal radiation from a classical black
hole1 in the 1970s With the emission of Hawking radiation black holes could
lose energy shrink and eventually evaporate completely Because black holes
radiate thermally it sets up a disturbing and dicult problem
information
loss paradox Moreover when Hawking rst proved the existence of black hole
radiation he described it as tunnelling triggered by vacuum uctuations near
the horizon The idea is that when a virtual particle pair is created just inside
the horizon the positive energy virtual particle can tunnel out  no classical
escape route exists  where it materializes as a real particle The negative energy
particle is absorbed by the black hole resulting in a decrease in the mass of the
black hole while the positive energy particle escapes to innity appearing as
Hawking radiation But actual derivation of Hawking radiation did not proceed
in this way at all There were two diculties to overcome The rst was that in
order to do a tunnelling computation one needed to nd a coordinate system
which was well-behaved at the event horizon The second was that there did
not seem to be any barrier

Recently a method to describe Hawking radiation as a tunnelling process
where a particle moves in dynamic geometry was developed by Kraus and
Wilczek2 and elaborated upon by Parikh and Wilczek345 In their method
they take the self-gravitation into account and it is the tunnelling particle itself
that denes the barrier5 And they also give a leading correction to the emis-
sion rate arising from loss of mass of the black hole corresponding to the energy
carried by the radiated quantum Following this method Hemming and Keski-
Vakkuri have investigated the radiation from Ads black holes6 and Medved
has studied those from a de Sitter cosmology7
In all these investigations
however all the black holes are static
In this paper we will extend the in-
vestigation to a nonstationary black hole  the Vaidya black hole There are
two crucial points First the Vaidya black hole radiates energy continuously
and there is a problem how to use the condition of the energy conservation
In quantum mechanics particle tunnelling a barrier is a instantaneous process
so the metric in the coordinates should satisfy Landau coordinate clock syn-
chronization condition Although not all the nonstationary black holes satisfy
Landau condition the Vaidya black hole does satisfy it8 Consequently we
could x a certain Bondi time v and at this time v the Bondi energy of the
Vaidya black hole is conserved Second although the components of the metric
in the advanced Eddington coordinate system are not singular the event hori-
zon and the time like limit surface do not locate at the same place which causes
diculty in the calculation of the emission rate We have to introduce a new
coordinate R  r  rH v In the new coordinate system the event horizon
and the time like limit surface do locate at the same place After calculation
the result is dierent from Parikhs work because rH is the function of mv
We emphasize that although the calculation has been employed at the moment
v v is chosen arbitrarily So our results reveal the dynamical change of the
non-stationary black hole Throughout the paper the units G  c    1 are
2 New coordinates
The metric of a Vaidya black hole can be written as
ds2  cid201 
cid21 dv2  2dvdr  r2d2  sin2 d2
From g00  0 we get r  2mv which is the time like limit surface not the
event horizon If we dene a new radical coordinate R  r  rH v the line
element1 can be rewritten as
ds2  cid201 
r  2 rHcid21 dv2  2dvdR  r2d2  sin2 d2
 g00dv2  2g01dvdR  g22d2  g33d2
The event horizon is910
1  2 rH
where rH  drH
In the new coordinates from g00  0 we can obtain the
equation of event horizon rH  2mv
 So the event horizon and the time like
12 rH
limit surface locate at the same place in the new coordinates The reason why
we must adopt the new coordinates will be explained in Sec3 Because particle
tunnelling a barrier is a instantaneous process we will verify that the met-
ric in new coordinate system satisfy Landau coordinate clock synchronization
condition as follows
According to Landau coordinate clock synchronization theory in a space-
of two events
time decomposed in 3  1 the dierence of coordinate times
taking place simultaneously in dierent place is
T  Z g0i
where i  1 2 3 If the simultaneity of coordinate clocks can be transmitted
from one place to another and have nothing to do with the integration path
components of the metric should satisfy
xj cid18 g0i
g00cid19 
xi cid18 g0j
g00cid19 
In this case x1  r x2   x3   so we can obtain
i j  1 2 3
x2 cid18 g01
g00cid19 
x1 cid18 g02
g00cid19 
x3 cid18 g01
g00cid19 
x1 cid18 g03
g00cid19  0
That is to say we can dene coordinate clock synchronization although the
space-time is non-stationary This feature of the coordinates is very important
for us to discuss the tunnelling process The area of the event horizon AH  the
entropy9 of the black hole are given by
AH  ZrH

To describe across-horizon phenomena it is necessary to choose coordinates
which are not singular at the horizon fortunately the line element2 is no
singular at the horizon rH  2mv

 The radial null geodesics are given by
R 
2 cid201 
r  2 rHcid21
corresponding to outgoing geodesics where v increases towards the future
These equations are modied when the particles self-gravitation is taken into
account We can consider the particle as a shell of energy We x the total
mass Bondi mass and allow the hole mass to uctuate When the shell of
energy  travels on the geodesics we should replace m v with m v   in
the geodesic Eq8 to describe the moving of the shell5 However there is a
problem that in the nonstationary space-time the energy of a particle travelling
on the geodesics is not conserved because of the space-time without a time-like
killing vecter eld So the energy of shell  will vary when v increases towards
the future The crucial point is that particle tunnelling a barrier is a instanta-
neous process So we can x a certain time v and the energy of the black hole
is m v at the time v When the positive energy virtual particle with energy
 just inside the event horizon tunnels just outside the event horizon where it
materializes as a real particle its energy is also  At the same time the total
energy of the black hole changes to m v  and the black hole shrinks a little
The line element2 should be rewritten as

3 tunnelling across the horizon
In our picture a point particle description is appropriate Because of the innite
blue shift near the horizon the characteristic wavelength of any wave packet is
always arbitrarily small there so that the geometrical optics limit becomes an
especially reliable approximation The geometrical limit allows us to obtain
rigorous results directly in the language of particles rather than having to use
the second-quantized Bogolubov method When the black hole varies slowly
in the semiclassical limit we can apply the WKB formula This relates the
tunnelling amplitude to the imaginary part of the particle action at stationary
phase The emission rate  is the square of the tunnelling amplitude4
The imaginary part of the action for an outgoing positive energy particle
which crosses the horizon outwards from rin to rout can be expressed as
  exp 2 Im S 
Im S  ImZ Rout
pRdR  ImZ Rout
Rin Z pR
where pR is canonical momentum conjugate to R In the coordinates v R  
Rin  r rH rH  0 is the initial radius of the black hole and Rout  rHrH 
 is the nal radius of the hole where rH  rH m v   We substitute
Hamilton equation R  dH
dpR R into Eq11 change variable from momentum
to energy and switch the order of integration to obtain
1  2mv
Im S  ImZ m
dH  ImZ 
0 Z Rout
d  
We have used the modied Eq8 and H is the Bondi energy of the space-
time4 The radiative eld do not radiate energy in the tunnelling process
because a certain moment v is xed to study the tunnelling process while the
dierence of the Bondi energy of the black hole of two dierent moments v1 and
v2 is the energy radiated from the black hole during v2  v1 So we could get
dH  d m v    d and the minus sign appears Now let us explain the
problem why we must adopt the new coordinates If we do not adopt the new
coordinates the Eq12 will be
 2 rH

The integral singularitythe rst order pole is at r  2 m v    where is
time like limit surface not event horizon This means that the particle tunnels
out of the time like limit surface not of the event horizon However it is well
known that Hawking radiation comes from the event horizon not from the time
like limit surface In Eq12 1
 2 rH equals zero at event horizon
So we adopt the new coordinate and obtain Eq12 in order that the integral
singularity is at r  r
H  rH m v    We integrate over R
rstly The integral can be done by deforming the contour so as to ensure that
positive energy solutions decay in time that is  into the lower half   plane4
In this way we obtain
H  where r

Because rH is the function of   to the non-stationary black hole the integral
could not be worked out However we could make the physical meaning clear

It is obvious that the term of the left-hand side of Eq16 is just 2 Im S in
Eq14 and the rst term of the right-hand side of Eq16 is just SBH 
SBH m v    SBH m v So the term of the left side of Eq16 corre-
sponds to the exponent of  and on the right-hand side of Eq16 there is a
remainder R mv

4 conclusion and discussion
The tunnelling rate obtained in this paper is the function of time v which
describes the black hole itself Moreover when m is a constant it could come
back to the result of the static Schwarzschild black hole So our results reect
the dynamical change of the Vaidya black hole
In our opinion this result
is reasonable and anticipatory When we study the tunnelling eect from a
black hole there exists thermal equilibrium between the black hole and its
environment in the case of the static and stationary space-time So Parikh
get the result   exp SBH  5 However because of the radiation of the
black holes the non-stationary black holes exist more generally In the Vaidya
space-time the black hole is non-stationary and it is impossible that the black
hole keeps thermal equilibrium between the black hole and its environment In
addition an important dierence between stationary and non-stationary black
holes is whether rH is the function of time Due to non-stationary black holes
the event horizon rH and the entropy of the black hole are related not only to
the Bondi energy but also to rH  Consequently the variation of rH and the
entropy also depends on rH when m v changes
