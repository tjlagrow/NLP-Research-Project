Abstract Poor groups of galaxies are the repositories of most of the
baryons in the local Universe and are environments in which galaxy evo-
lution is likely to be both more recent and simpler than in the cores of
rich clusters Yet we know little about groups outside of our own Local
Group We discuss recent results from optical X-ray and radio observa-
tions of nearby poor groups that focus on the evolution of gas and galaxies
in these common environments
Introduction
Poor groups are both typical environments for galaxies and relatively simple
environments for galaxy evolution especially in contrast to the complex mecha-
nisms that might drive galaxy evolution in hotter denser clusters of galaxies We
dene poor groups as systems with ve or fewer L or brighter galaxies Many
galaxies including our own Milky Way lie in poor groups which can be roughly
divided into three major classes based on their X-ray and galaxy morphologies
The rst class includes the NGC 533 group Figure 1 which is marked by a
large fraction of early type galaxies and by luminous symmetric diuse X-ray
emission coincident with the central giant elliptical Groups of the second class
are like Hickson Compact Group 90 Figure 1 which has a lower fraction of
early types and an apparently unrelaxed X-ray halo not clearly associated with
particular galaxies In HCG 90 we observe several interacting galaxies in the
core instead of a giant elliptical The third class of poor groups includes our own
Local Group which consists of two giant late type galaxies and their satellite
populations apparently falling together for the rst time These groups have few
or no early type members have little or no diuse X-ray emission and while
bound are not necessarily virialized
A classic problem in the study of poor groups has been that with ve
or fewer known members it is dicult to dierentiate true bound systems
from chance superpositions of galaxies along the line-of-sight Furthermore
even in bound groups the small number of known members has prevented an
accurate calculation of the group kinematics We use multi-object spectroscopy
to determine whether there are members further down the luminosity function
and nd a surprising result groups of the rst class those with X-ray luminous
halos can have 5060 members down to M 5 projected within  05h1 Mpc
their virial radii Figure 2 These newly discovered galaxies conrm such groups
as bound systems and provide a means for assessing the groups dynamical state
Groups of the second and third classes which have at most marginally detected

In this group the X-ray emission is not smooth symmetric or even
apparently associated with the galaxies
Instead of one dominant central
elliptical there are several interacting galaxies including late types in the
X-ray emission are not as easy to identify as real The populations of dwarf
galaxies present in the X-ray luminous groups are not observed in X-ray faint
groups Figure 2 Deeper spectroscopy is required to establish whether these
poorer groups have fainter dwarfs analogs to those galaxies in the Local Group
fainter than the Small Magellanic Cloud
2 Why Study Poor Groups
Poor groups are important to studies of cosmology and galaxy evolution for
reasons that include the ubiquity of the group environment the fact that clusters
of galaxies evolve hierarchically from the accretion of groups and the likelihood
of tidal interactions and mergers among group members First let us consider
the prevalence of groups More than half of the baryons in the nearby universe lie
in groups Fukugita et al 1998 the intergroup medium may contribute to the
population of high redshift absorption line systems Mulchaey et al 1996 and
group environment plays a critical if poorly-dened role in the degree to which
gravitational lens galaxies distort the light of background objects In this last
case it is possible to estimate the fraction of lensing galaxies that lie in groups
Keeton Christlein  Zabludo 2000 The best lenses are the most massive
galaxies which tend to be early types and to lie in the densest regions However
the increase in the dwarf-to-giant galaxy ratio with environment density 3
compensates for the morphology-density relation causing the distribution of
environments of lens and non-lens galaxies to be similar We estimate that at
least 25 of strong lensing galaxies are group or rich cluster members As a
consequence the extended dark halo of groups and the individual halos of other

Galaxy velocity histograms for six poor groups The rst four
have diuse luminous X-ray halos the last two are not detected in X-rays
The non-detected groups also have fewer members and thus we are unable to
conrm that they are real bound systems instead of chance superpositions of
galaxies along the line-of-sight We note however that the properties of the
Local Group which is bound but not virialized are consistent with those
of the non-detected groups

The dashed and solid lines are weighted and unweighted ts respectively
group galaxies will signicantly aect the lensing models and the constraints
they place on halo shapes and cosmological parameters like H0 and 
Second the accretion of groups by rich clusters provides an opportunity to
test the eects of cluster environment on galaxy evolution by comparing groups
in the eld to groups subclusters that have recently fallen into clusters By
comparing the galaxy morphologies and recent star formation histories for group
galaxies in and out of clusters it is possible to quantify the degree to which
mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping or galaxy harassment  which are
not as ecient in group environments  aect the evolution of cluster galaxies
Preliminary evidence suggests that the fraction and star formation histories of
early types do not dier signicantly from eld groups to subclusters suggesting
that any external forces that drive galaxy evolution are not cluster-dependent
but group-dependent Zabludo  Mulchaey 1998 One such mechanism is
galaxy-galaxy tidal encounters and mergers which are more ecient in poor
groups than in clusters because the velocity dispersion of a group is similar to
that of an individual galaxy
Third as likely sites for interaction-driven galaxy evolution groups espe-
cially the most dynamically young systems are good places to look for galaxies
evolving at z  0 While evidence suggests that the cores of rich clusters have
old mostly unevolving galaxy populations the beautiful HI map of the M81
group on the conference T-shirt Yun et al 1994 clearly shows that trans-
forming interactions among galaxies can occur in poor groups today Even
though galaxy morphologies are frequently less revealing at optical wavelengths
optical imaging is abundant and worth examining for disturbed galaxies
Tran et al 2001 we obtain quantitative optical morphologies for galaxies in
evolved X-ray luminous groups by tting the bulge and disk subtracting the
best model and determining the asymmetric component of the residual light

Figure 3 shows that  15 of these galaxies including both early and late
types are signicantly asymmetric The presence of obvious tidal features in
some of these galaxies suggests that morphologically-disruptive interactions can
take place even in dynamically older groups
While such interactions may be more common in lower velocity dispersion
less evolved groups like the Local Group and the M81 system there is indirect
evidence that interactions have played a role in most groups at some time For
example Figure 3 shows a strong correlation between the early type fraction
and velocity dispersion of poor groups Either both quantities increase as groups
evolve or the initial size of the group potential determines the early type fraction
for all time Some support for the former scenario comes from the saturation
point in early type fraction beyond which the morphological compositions of
groups and clusters are similar This saturation point is about 500 km s1 the
velocity dispersion that a group must have such that an L galaxy would have
merged with another member within a Hubble time
3 The Group Galaxy Luminosity Function
If interactions can alter the morphology of group galaxies they can also aect
galaxy luminosity We might expect the ratio of dwarf-to-giant galaxies DG
to be dependent on both the initial luminosity distribution when most galaxies
formed and the subsequent evolution of galaxy luminosity and number density
Zabludo
In both cases the environment may play a role For example standard biased
galaxy formation models White et al 1987 predict that giant galaxies are more
likely than dwarfs to form in dense regions Subsequent evolution via galaxy-
galaxy mergers tidal interactions ram pressure stripping or other factors would
alter DG in a direction and to a degree that are dependent on the dominant
mechanism To test the dependence of DG on environment we investigate
whether DG varies among poor groups with dierent galaxy number densities
within groups with radius and from the eld to groups to rich clusters
We nd that the galaxy luminosity function is not universal  the group
with the faintest X-ray emission and lowest galaxy number density has a sig-
nicantly lower DG than the other six systems in our sample Furthermore
the average DG for the ve X-ray luminous groups is larger than that derived
from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey eld Lin et al 1996 and consistent
with that of rich clusters cf Trentham 19971 Within the composite group
DG drops signicantly with increasing radius and thus decreasing density
These three trends are in the same sense and suggest that at least in some
environments dwarfs are more biased than giants with respect to dark matter
Thus more than just standard biased galaxy formation is at work Zabludo 
Mulchaey 2000
Evidence that the group dwarf and giant populations formed at dierent
times is presented in Figure 4 The phase-space diagram shows that the dwarfs
and giants have not mixed ie lie on dierent orbits Possible explanations for
this result and the trends in DG summarized above include inecient galaxy
formation eg giants form less eciently in denser environments increases in
the satellite-to-primary ratio through the mergers of giant galaxies and dwarf
formation in the tidal tails of giant merger remnants Barnes  Hernquist 1992
Additional support that DG evolves comes from X-ray and optical obser-
vations of the isolated elliptical NGC 1132 Figure 4 Numerical simulations
predict that some poor groups of galaxies have merged by the present epoch
into giant ellipticals Barnes 1989 The extent  250 kpc h1 temperature
 1 keV metallicity  025 solar and luminosity  25  1042 h2 ergs
s1 of NGC 1132s X-ray halo are comparable with those of poor group halos
The total mass inferred from the X-ray emission  19  1013 h1 M is also
like that of an X-ray detected group Optical imaging uncovers a dwarf galaxy
population clustered about NGC 1132 that is consistent in number density and
projected radial distribution with that of an X-ray group The similarities of
NGC 1132 to poor groups in both the X-ray band and at the faint end of the
galaxy luminosity function combined with the decit of luminous galaxies in the
NGC 1132 eld are compatible with the merged group picture Another possi-
bility is that the NGC 1132 system is a failed group ie a local overdensity
in which other bright galaxies never formed
1The similarity of DG for groups and clusters once groups reach a large enough gravitational
well depth is reminiscent of the saturation of the early type fraction-velocity dispersion relation
noted in the previous section

4 Cold Gas in Groups
In the previous sections we discussed the galaxies and hot gas in poor groups
but what about the cold gas HI studies of groups can tell us both about
interactions among galaxies  witness the M81 group  and about galaxy
formation eciency in groups Our on-going HI survey with the VLA Zabludo
with van Gorkom Wilcots  Mulchaey targets not just group members but
the entire 15  15 square degree eld of each group with 36 pointed mosaic
tiles Of the two groups examined so far we have made  15 HI detections of
galaxies with a range of optical types and luminosities Figure 5
Our preliminary results include an increase in the HI extent of galaxies with
projected radius from the group center However this trend might be due to the
increasing spiral fraction with projected radius  we are currently comparing
the magnitudes of these two eects Most of our detections are near the  107
M limit of the survey so many other detections may be possible at fainter
limits We observe no obvious galaxy-galaxy interactions like those in M81 but
fewer HI-rich interactions are expected in these more dynamically evolved X-ray
detected high early type fraction groups All HI clouds lie at the positions of
galaxies ie there are no free clouds down to our detection limit that could
be associated with evolution of group as whole cf Blitz et al 1999 instead of
individual galaxies

5 Conclusions
Groups are where a lot of the action is or was in galaxy evolution There
are optical and HI signatures of on-going galaxy-galaxy interactions not only in
M81 but also to a lesser degree in more dynamically evolved X-ray luminous
groups There is also indirect evidence that groups and the mergers and tidal
encounters likely to occur in such low velocity dispersion systems played an
important role in the past evolution of galaxies The galaxy populations of X-
ray luminous poor groups and rich clusters including the early type fraction
fraction of early types forming stars and dwarf-to-giant ratio are surprisingly
similar These results suggest that group-dependent not cluster-dependent
mechanisms like galaxy-galaxy interactions drive the evolution of those galaxies
that begin as members of groups accreted by clusters2
Additional evidence for environment-dependent evolution is the increase
in the dwarf-to-giant ratio with density at least up to the densities of X-ray
luminous groups and clusters indicating that more than standard biased galaxy
formation is at work The dwarf and giant galaxies in groups have not mixed
suggesting that one population formed later This evolution in DG might
be due to galaxy-galaxy interactions a compelling example is NGC 1132 an
isolated giant elliptical with all the hallmarks of a merged group On-going
HI studies with the VLA have the potential to place critical constraints on the
interaction history and galaxy formation eciency in such groups

2Even the  400 km s1 upper limit on the velocity dispersion of a giant elliptical galaxy is
consistent with the velocity dispersion of a group  is this limit due to the initial formation of
such galaxies in group not cluster environments Further support for this idea comes from the
tendency of the brightest giant ellipticals to lie in the spatial and kinematic centers of groups
and subclusters not clusters Beers  Geller 1983 Zabludo  Mulchaey 1998
