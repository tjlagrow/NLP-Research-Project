ABSTRACT
We present the B-band TullyFisher relation TFR of 60 latetype galaxies with redshifts 01- 1 The galaxies
were selected from the FORS Deep Field with a limiting magnitude of R  23 Spatially resolved rotation curves
were derived from spectra obtained with FORS2 at the VLT High-mass galaxies with vmax  150 kms show little
evolution whereas the least massive systems in our sample are brighter by  1 - 2 mag compared to their local
counterparts For the entire distant sample the TFR slope is atter than for local eld galaxies - 577  045
versus - 792  018 Thus we nd evidence for evolution of the slope of the TFR with redshift on the 3  level
This is still true when we subdivide the sample into three redshift bins We speculate that the atter tilt of our
sample is caused by the evolution of luminosities and an additional population of blue galaxies at z  02 The
mass dependence of the TFR evolution also leads to variations for different galaxy types in magnitude-limited
samples suggesting that selection effects can account for the discrepant results of previous TFR studies on the
luminosity evolution of latetype galaxies

1 INTRODUCTION
Tully and Fisher 1977 found a remarkable correlation be-
tween the stellar content and the kinematics of disk galaxies
linking tightly the luminosity to the maximum rotational veloc-
ity of latetype galaxies This TullyFisher Relation TFR
can therefore be exploited to study both the dynamical evolu-
tion and the star formation history of disk galaxies Observed
local TFR samples eg Mathewson and Ford 1996 with their
very small scatter already served as important constraints for
galaxy evolution models eg Eisenstein and Loeb 1996 But
the redshift evolution of the TFR is an even more powerful tool
to investigate galaxy evolution and cosmological structure for-
mation
On the observational side recent studies of spiral galaxy
kinematics at intermediate redshift produced rather discrepant
results mainly due to different sample selection methods While
Vogt et al 1996 nd only a modest increase in luminosity
of MB  05 at hzi  05 the results of Rix et al 1997
and Simard and Pritchet 1998 imply a strong brightening of
roughly 2 mag in absolute B-band luminosity
Theoretical simulations have to consider the temporal growth
of galaxies in size and mass as well as the evolution of the
star formation rates Mao et al 1998 for example combine
the dynamical evolution as traced by Cold Dark Matter CDM
hierarchical-merging models with a simple scaling relation be-
tween mass and luminosity Steinmetz and Navarro 1999 in
addition introduce star formation phenomena via semianalyti-
cal recipes These kind of studies predict zeropoint offsets in lu-
minosity for distant TFR samples depending both on observed
wavelength and cosmology
2 SAMPLE AND OBSERVATIONS
Our galaxy sample is based on the FORS Deep Field FDF
a deep multi-color study UBgRIzJK of an  6  6 eld with
limiting blue and visual magnitudes comparable to the HST
Deep Fields Appenzeller et al 2000 Heidt et al 2001 Photo-
metric redshifts and spectrophotometric galaxy types were de-
termined for an I-band selected catalogue of  3800 objects
Bender et al 2001 From this list late-type galaxies were
drawn primarily on the basis of their brightness with a limit-
ing magnitude of R  23m as determined by the SExtractor
package Bertin and Arnouts 1996 Additional criteria have
been that the inclination was i  40 and zphot  12 so that any
O II3727 emission-line doublet would fall onto our observed
wavelength range The nal sample comprised 79 spirals of all
Hubble types Sa  Irr with 01  z  10 peaking at z  035
and 075 see Fig 1 Their absolute B magnitudes cover the
range - 224  MB  - 158 the scale lengths range from 06 kpc
to 48 kpc H0  75 km s- 1Mpc- 1 and q0  0 assumed throughout

ing them to 05 FWHM The disc inclinations we measured
in these frames were then compared with the values given by
Marleau and Simard 1998 based on the original images For
objects with BT04 the differences were limited to a few de-
grees Estimated errors on the inclinations range from 7 for
i  40 to 3 for i  80 in some cases they may be as high
as up to 12 In the next step the inclined velocity eld was
folded with the luminosity prole and convolved to account for
the seeing during spectroscopy A simulated RC was extracted
from the 2D velocity eld by integrating over the slit aperture
At last we variied vmax the only remaining free parameter in
these simulations until the best reproduction of the observed
RC was achieved In that manner we were able to quantify the
maximum rotation velocity of 60 spirals in our sample with es-
timated errors between 10 and 40 kms depending on galaxy
size and RC quality The remaining 19 objects showed either a
solidbody rotation highly disturbed RCs or no rotation at all
Examples of RCs are given in Fig 2

The B-band luminosities of the FDF galaxies were deter-
mined in the following way we took SExtractors MAGISO
values as the total magnitudes in the BgRI FORS2 lters which
were then transformed onto the JohnsonCousins photometric
system One origin of uncertainty in the derivation of the rest
frame B-band luminosity is the k-correction see eg Ziegler
et al 1999 For early-type spirals at z  10 transformation
from comoving to restframe B-band magnitude amounts to
 2 mag To keep the k-corrections small we therefore used
that lter which best matches the restframe B Depending on
the galaxies redshift this was either the B- g- R- or I-band
leading to a typical correction of 05 mag For the calculation
of the respective k-corrections we used template spectra cre-
ated by the chemically consistent evolutionary synthesis mod-
els of Mller et al 2001 Observed galaxy colors of different
Hubble types eg Frei and Gunn 1994 are reproduced with
these spectra to within 015 mag over the whole covered red-
shift range Corrections for inclination-dependent intrinsic ab-
sorption due to dust were applied following Tully and Fouque
1985

Spectroscopy was carried out with the Focal Reducer and
Spectrograph 2 FORS2 mounted onto the Very Large Tele-
scope VLT Unit 2 Using the grism 600R with the order
separation lter GG435 the typical wavelength range for the
case of a chip-centered slit was   5250 - 7450  With a
slit width of 1 the dispersion was 108 pixel and the resolu-
tion R  1230 Observations were done in MOS Multi Object
Spectroscopy mode in which FORS2 provides 19 slitlets of
 22 length in a vertical array Targets for the different setups
were selected in a way to minimize the misalignment between
slit direction and position angle of the galaxy The maximal de-
viation was 15 The exposures for each setup were split into
3  3000 s the mean DIMM seeing was 066 FWHM for a
spatial scale of 02pixel A detailed description of the reduc-
tion process will be given in Bhm et al 2002
3 DETERMINATION OF vmax AND Mb
To derive the rotation velocities of the galaxies as a func-
tion of radius Gaussian proles were tted to the visible emis-
sion lines For the objects with high redshift 04  z  10
the O II3727 doublet was used while for objects with 01 
z  05 the O III5007 andor H lines were measured To in-
crease the SN a boxcar lter of 06 was applied ie
neighbouring rows of the spectra were averaged before each
Gaussian t
In contrast to studies of local spirals these straightforward
measurements of vrotr cannot be used to directly derive the
maximum rotation velocity vmax Simard and Pritchet 1999
Because the size of the visible disks of spirals at z  05 with
typical apparent scale lengths of rd  05 is comparable to
the slit width of 1 the spectroscopy is an integration over
the galaxies intrinsic velocity elds
To tackle this problem a synthetic rotation curve RC was
generated for each galaxy assuming a linearly rising rotation
velocity in the innermost galaxy regions and a constant rota-
tion vmax at large radii eg Courteau 1997 The radius at
which this intrinsic RC attens was computed from the scale
length rd measured in the I-band taking into account that its
value depends on the rest frame wavelength because the scale
length of the young star population is larger than that of the
older population Ryder and Dopita 1994 This intrinsic one-
dimensional RC was then used to generate the 2D velocity eld
taking into account inclination and position angle The struc-
tural parameters were derived from two-dimensional luminos-
ity prole ts based on a coadded I-band image with an FWHM
of 05 These ts considered the possible dependence of the
Point Spread Function on CCD position
If a bulge was de-
tectable the ts included two components To test our pro-
cedure we performed a VLT simulation based on the driz-
zled HDF images by rebinning them to 02pixel and convolv-
Evolution of the TullyFisher relation
4 THE TULLYFISHER RELATION AT z  05
For the comparison to local data we chose the large sample
of 1196 eld Sbc and Sc galaxies of Haynes et al 1999 To
be able to better compare our results with previous studies we
construct the B-band TFR in this letter for the I-band and NIR
TFR see Bhm et al 2002 Therefore the observed I magni-
tudes given by Haynes et al were transformed to B using the
type-dependent B -
I colors of Frei and Gunn 1994 and cor-
rected for intrinsic absorption the same way as our sample This
transformation was tested on our sample for which we both
have B and I magnitudes showing that on average the accu-
racy is within 01 mag independent of galaxy type The result-
ing absolute magnitudes cover - 225  MB  - 151 For use in
the TFR we further corrected the derived MB magnitudes for
morphological and incompleteness bias following Giovanelli
et al 1997 The authors pointed out that an incompleteness
bias arises from the differences between the luminosity function
of a magnitude limited sample and the Schechter luminosity
function At low rotation velocities low absolute magnitudes
galaxies falling below the detection limit do not contribute to
the observed TFR resulting in an underestimated slope Sim-
ulating this a synthetic unbiased TFR is transformed into the
observed relation using the measured values of vmax the ob-
served scatter as a function of vmax and the completeness limit
The effect can then be counter-balanced by decreasing the ob-
served luminosities accordingly
The magnitudes of the distant galaxies were de-biased with
the same procedure adopting the parameterization of the scatter
given by Giovanelli et al but taking into account that the scatter
in the FDF sample is on the mean 15 times larger To account
for the variation in the luminosity function with redshift we
subdivided our full FDF sample into three z bins for which we
constructed the observed luminosity functions separately At
the faint end of our sample the correction for incompleteness
amounts to maximal 14 mag The morphological bias as a
similar effect originates in the different luminosity functions
for different morphological classes and leads to a slightly in-
creased luminosity for early types  - 03 - 01 mag If not
accounted for the combination of these two biases leads to an
underestimate of both slope and scatter of the TFR We sub-
divided the 60 galaxies into 3 classes corresponding to SaSb
Sc and SdIrr This was done on the basis of spectrophotomet-
ric types from our photometric redshift catalog and by compar-
ing our spectra to the catalog of template spectra of Kennicutt
1992 There are 10 Sab 32 Sc and 18 SdIrr galaxies in our
sample
We present the distant B-band TFR in Fig 3 in comparison
to the local TFR The FDF spirals follow a atter relation than
their local counterparts While the most massive galaxies are
indistinguishable on average from the local sample the less
massive galaxies show large deviations from the local t For
the full FDF sample we nd a slope of - 577  045 by repeat-
ing bisector ts eg Ziegler et al 2001 to the data centered
on the median value of the logvmax-distribution hlogvmaxi 
208 100 times using a bootstrap method For the local sam-
ple hlogvmaxi  2182 the same method yields a slope of
- 792  018 The last value is consistent with slopes derived
for other local eld samples We derive for example a slope of
- 740 for the BBFNRC3 sample not de-biased Burstein et al
1997 and - 750 for the Pierce and Tully 1992 sample Sakai
et al 2000 nd a slope of - 807  072 in the B-band using
HST-based calibrators Thus the slopes of the local samples
and the FDF sample differ on the 3  level This is conrmed
by a 2D KolmogorovSmirnov test which limits the probabil-
ity that our sample originates from the same distribution as the
Haynes et al sample to 0001 We also performed a simple
MonteCarlo simulation extracting randomly 60 galaxies from
the local sample Neither of 200 iterations resulted in a TFR
slope as at as for the FDF galaxies If we subdivide our sam-
ple according to galaxy type Sab Sc and SdIrr or redshift
the resulting slopes and zero-points are compatible with each
other within their 1 errors see Table 1

Can the observed change of slope be caused by systematic
errors Any overestimate of i would both lead to an underes-
timate of vmax and too large a luminosity after correcting for
intrinsic absorption But to introduce a signicant effect on the
slope the errors on i would have to be large assuming eg an
inclination of 60 instead of 40 for an object the shift in the
TFR with a slope of - 6 would amount to - 093 mag Such mea-
surement errors are unlikely as our inclinations do not show
any dependence on rotation velocity nor apparent scale length
Ziegler et al
nor type For that reason we are also condent that morpho-
logically irregular objects in our sample are unlikely to have
introduced a signicant bias in the inclinations
5 DISCUSSION
Our intermediate-z TFR indicates a change in the slope with
lookback time Most previous studies of the kinematics of
spirals in this regime were restricted to small data sets N  20
and had to assume a constant slope In the ongoing study of
Vogt 2000 of  100 distant disk galaxies it was also assumed
that the slope of the local TFR of Pierce and Tully 1992 holds
valid at all redshifts
CDM-based simulations predict a slight brightening of the
B-band TFR up to z  1 eg Steinmetz and Navarro 1999 In
this model the decrease in mass is more than balanced by an
increase in luminosity due to younger stellar populations Any
mass-dependent evolution of the star formation rate or other TF
parameters that would cause an evolving TFR slope are yet not
implemented in these models
A change in the TFR slope as we observed makes it impos-
sible to give a single number for the luminosity evolution of
distant galaxies since it depends on the galaxy mass The FDF
galaxies with vmax  150 kms fall into the same magnitude re-
gion as those of the local sample and show no signicant lumi-
nosity evolution whereas the less massive distant galaxies are
brighter by  1 - 2 mag
A mass dependence of the TFR evolution also introduces
a dependence on galaxy type since the various sub-classes of
disk galaxies have different distributions in mass logvmax for
a magnitudelimited sample Thus a natural explanation of the
discrepant results in luminosity evolution of previous observa-
tional studies is suggested For example studies based on sam-
ples with galaxies selected to be blue like Rix et al 1997 or
showing strong emission lines like Simard and Pritchet 1998
are biased towards later types of spirals de Vaucouleurs 1961
Kennicutt and Kent 1983 resulting in a large luminosity in-
crease On the other hand studies using mainly galaxies with
large disks like Vogt et al 1996 may contain a larger fraction
of early and luminous spirals leading to a more modest lumi-
nosity evolution
At last we speculate on the possible origin of the atter tilt
in all three redshift bins z  0303  z  05z  05 A
plausible scenario would be that we not only trace a pure lu-
minosity evolution but also observe a population of blue dwarf
galaxies with MB  - 20 underrepresented in the local Universe
This would be consistent with blue number counts that suggest
a higher number density of bursting dwarfs at z  05 eg El-
lis 1997 These objects may have too low a rotation for their
luminosity as observed by Rix et al 1997 On the other hand
the star formation rates of all FDF galaxies 02 - 18 Myr
fall well below the local regime of starburst galaxies Kennicutt
1998 If we exclude the low-mass objects with vmax  80 kms
and MB  - 18 N  16 from the local and distant sample we
derive slopes of - 729  015 and - 508  050 respectively
conrming the change of tilt with 3  condence
6 SUMMARY
We have presented the B-band TullyFisher relation of 60
disk galaxies at intermediate redshifts The galaxies comprise
a magnitude-limited sample within the FORS Deep Field We
observe a signicant 3  change of slope in comparison to
the local sample The larger FDF spirals vmax  150 kms fall
into a region of the logvmax  luminosity diagram consistent
with modest or no luminosity evolution On the contrary the
smaller distant galaxies are offset from the local TFR by order
