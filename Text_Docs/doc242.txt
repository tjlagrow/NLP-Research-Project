ABSTRACT
We analyze the recent released HST WFC3 IR images in the GOODS-N region to study the
formation and evolution of Quiescent galaxies QGs After examining the reliability with articial
galaxies we obtain the morphological parameters with Sersic prole of 299 QGs and 1083 star-forming
galaxies SFGs at z  0530 nding the evolution of re and n of massive M  10105 M QGs
while weaker evolution of SFGs and less massive M  10105 M QGs The regression of the size
evolution of massive QGs follows re  1  zre with re  106  019 a factor of  22 increase
from z  25 to  05 which is consistent with the general picture of the signicant size growth For
the further understanding of the evolution scenario we study the evolution of Sersic index n and
nd that of massive QGs to signicantly evolve as n  1  zn with n  074  023 n  1 at
z  25 to n  4 at z  05 while those of the other populations are unchanged n  1 over the
redshift range The results in the present study are consistent with both of observation and numerical
simulations where gas-poor minor merger is believed to be the main evolution scenario By taking
account of the connection with less massive QGs and SFGs we discuss the formation and evolution
of the massive QGs overCosmic High Noon or the peak of star-formation in the universe

1 INTRODUCTION
The study of the high-redshift high-z early-type
galaxies ETGs provides us clues to understanding the
formation and evolution of massive galaxies in the local
universe Their star-formation activity peaked during
the cosmological epoch at 1  z  3 eg Dickinson
et al 2003 Heavens et al 2004 Papovich et al 2006
Hopkins  Beacom 2006 and galaxy morphologies have
changed dramatically Kajisawa  Yamada 2006 For
galaxy sizes many studies have corroborated that mas-
sive galaxies at high-z were much smaller than local
galaxies with comparable mass Daddi et al 2005 Tru-
jillo et al 2006 2007 Cimatti et al 2008 van Dokkum et
al 2008 Akiyama et al 2008 Franx et al 2008 Szomoru
et al 2010 2012 van der Wel et al 2011 Barro et
al 2013a At a xed stellar mass ETGs are claimed
to have been signicantly compact at high-z and have
evolved with rapid increase of their eective radius by
a factor of  4 or even larger from z  2 Buitrago et
al 2008 Carrasco et al 2010 and by a factor  2 from
z  1 van der Wel et al 2008 Trujillo et al 2011 To
reach the size of local ETGs rapid and violent evolutions
by major merger Hopkins et al 2009 or minor merger
Bezanson et al 2009 Naab et al 2009 have been de-
manded
Recent very deep infrared observations of high spatial
resolution with the Hubble Space T elescope HST  have
shed light on morphological details and shapes of galax-
ies at high-z Bruce et al 2012 studied over 200 mas-

sive galaxies at 1  z  3 in the CANDELS-UDS eld
and found that these galaxies had much smaller size at a
given mass than that of local ETGs On the other hand
it has also been argued that the compact galaxies have
apparent smaller eective radii because of low signal to
noise ratio SN eg Ryan et al 2012 The lack of
the consideration for AGN component would also make
the radius smaller Yoshino  Ichikawa 2008 Pierce et
al 2010 In addition the best-t morphological outputs
with for example GALFIT Peng et al 2002 which is one
of the most frequently used tting codes for galaxy mor-
phology could be signicantly changed with small dif-
ferences of tting inputs eg initial guess point spread
function PSF weight image and the image properties
eg size of postage stamp sky background noise Al-
though GALFIT are frequently used it sometimes gives
inappropriate results mostly when used without care-
ful considerations to image quality of galaxies and to
the contamination by neighboring objects Hauler et
al 2007 hereafter H07 Barden et al 2012
Some previous studies eg Trujillo et al 2006 H07
Carollo et al 2013 Mosleh et al 2013 estimated the
errors in eective radius re and Sersic index n us-
ing articial galaxies AGs and derived simple rela-
tions between the original and output values Szomoru
et al 2010 contrived to compensate the faint extended
wings of galaxies They estimated the limit of surface
brightness and tted the Sersic prole to the galaxy
images above the surface brightness limit with GALFIT
Then they corrected the result re by calculating the
residual counts between the original and model images
MORISHITA ICHIKAWA  KAJISAWA
Based on a careful study of the bias of image quality
and PSF proles van der Wel et al 2012 presented
global structural parameters of more than 100000 galax-
ies in the CANDELS survey Bruce et al 2012 applied
GALFIT to three-component tting bulge disk and cen-
tral components for high-z galaxies with a careful at-
tention to the background noise and PSF convolution
In addition we should take account of the dierent
analysis for local galaxies when comparing the morpho-
logical properties at high-z The half-light radii of the
SDSS local galaxies used in Shen et al 2003 hereafter
S03 were claimed to be underestimated Guo et al 2009
hereafter G09 Simard et al 2011 The comparison of
the size-stellar mass relations between the dierent def-
initions of stellar mass would also lead to inappropriate
results Mosleh et al 2013 The comparison of the struc-
tural parameters for high-z galaxies with those in the lo-
cal universe should be based on the consistent denition
and analysis of galaxy data
In this paper we investigate the reliability and limit of
GALFIT to obtain the morphological properties of high-z
galaxies Then using deep near infrared NIR observa-
tions with Wide Field Camera 3 WFC3 instrument in-
stalled on HST  we apply GALFIT to galaxies in the Great
Observatories Origins Deep Surveys-North GOODS-N
region in which Ichikawa et al 2012 hereafter Ic12
studied the size evolution of galaxies in a non-parametric
way with Ks-band ground-based images of MOIRCS
Deep Survey MODS The ground-based images were
not reliable enough for the morphological study of galax-
ies at z  1 with GALFIT Konishi et al 2011 As
such Ic12 obtained the size-stellar mass relations based
on half- and 90 percent light radii On the other hand
deep images by WFC3 with much higher spatial reso-
lution will allow us to apply GALFIT to high-z galaxies
including compact galaxies for the morphological study
An outline of the paper is as follows In Section 2 we
describe the samples of massive galaxies in the GOODS-
N Using the background noise and PSF of WFC3 im-
ages we make AGs with various shape parameters We
analyze them with GALFIT and compare the results with
the original parameters in Section 3 We examine the re-
liability and the systematic errors of re and n of the AGs
obtained with GALFIT under some conditions After ex-
amining the validity of the results we apply the tting
method to massive galaxies in the GOODS-N The re-
sults are described in Section 4 and Section 5 Finally
we discuss our results in comparison with those of previ-
ous parametric and non-parametric studies in Section 6
Throughout this paper we assume m  03   07
and H0  70 kms1Mpc1 We use the AB magnitude

GOODS-N region We use the full data of the observa-
tions through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes

maximums FWHMs of the PSF are  015 and 018

mated by median stacked unsaturated stars The PSF
for H160 image is consistent with that of the GOODS-
S images though that of J125 is slightly larger As the
PSF prole is one of the most important parameters for
the morphological analysis of galaxies we investigate it
carefully in Section 42
We make use of the Ks-band selected catalog of
the MODS in the GOODS-N region Kajisawa et

From MODS sample we select quiescent galaxies
QGs and star-forming galaxies SFGs based on rest

completeness in redshift bins for the two galaxy popu-
lations are dierent we set the redshift limit M

ples of QGs and SFGs in redshift-stellar mass diagrams
with the completeness are shown in Fig 1b where we
see that over 90 of the MODS galaxies are included in
the present sample see Section 33 about the selection

3 MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
Many studies for galaxy morphologies are based on
nding the best-t 2D surface brightness prole of Sersic
1968 which is written as
Ir  Ie expbn cid18 r
recid191n
 1 
where n is Sersic index re eective radius and Ie surface
brightness at re bn is dened as a function of n To t
galaxies with Sersic prole we use GALFIT considering
the eect of PSF background noise and frame size of
tting for the morphological parameters GALFIT some-
times returns unpleasant or biased results when used
without much care to for example sky subtraction ini-
tial guess and weight images To examine the bias and
uncertainties of the results we prepare AGs and apply
GALFIT to them Another concern is neighboring galax-
ies or stars For the galaxies with neighbors we apply
GALFIT after masking the neighboring objects as done
by many studies1
31 Fitting with GALFIT
GALFIT is a 2D tting code which calculates 2 for
model galaxies and nds the model with minimum 2
It is frequently used for the discussion on morpholo-
gies Trujillo et al 2006 used GALFIT for AGs and
estimated errors in re and n Comparing GALFIT and
GIM2D Simard 2002 H07 concluded that the former
gave better results for faint galaxies In addition Ravin-
dranath et al 2006 and Cimatti et al 2008 showed
that GALFIT returned unbiased estimates of re and n for
galaxies with SN  10 and re  003 at any redshifts of
the sources Szomoru et al 2012 used masks on outer
faint part of galaxies in order to exclude the sky back-
ground noise at the extend wings
As described above GALFIT is widely used for morpho-
logical analyses of galaxies In the following sections we
examine the reliability in a similar context to the meth-
ods of previous studies eg H07 We use the newest
version of GALFIT 305 which is improved in creating
weight images The revision makes results more reliable
for faint objects C Peng private communication

32 The Initial Guess for Input Parameters
To perform morphological tting with GALFIT we
should provide an appropriate set of initial morphologi-
cal parameters which leads to more reliable parameters
and saves CPU cost As done in previous studies we
use SExtractor version 250 Bertin  Arnouts 1996
to estimate galaxy properties of position magnitude ra-
dius axis ratio and position angle of the target To-
tal magnitude MAG AUTO mAUTO and half-light ra-
dius FLUX RADIUS 50 r50 which encircles half the
light emitted from galaxies are the initial guess of mag-
nitude and eective radius respectively No constraints
are imposed on the parameters during tting
One problem still remains how can we set the initial n
To avoid the problem we use the initial n from 05 to 8
by step of 05 and iterate GALFIT 16 times for each galaxy
to derive more reliable parameter sets as employed by
Bruce et al 2012 After getting results we compare at
most 16 of best-t parameter sets based on their re-
duced chi square 2 where  is the number of degrees
of freedom for tting though we discard the results with
unrealistic parameters see Section 33 for the details If
a galaxy has dierent parameter sets with similar 2
we adopt the set which has the model magnitude nearest
to mAUTO because the selection based on mAUTO which
is independent of the parametric prole gives more reli-
able parameter sets
33 Fitting Test for AGs in the WFC3 Images
As we mentioned above we should scrutinize the relia-
bility GALFIT with AGs before applying to the real galax-
ies in the GOODS-N region AGs are prepared by GALFIT
with random sets of re n total magnitude m ba and
position angle P A see Table 1 re is circularized as
re  aepba where ae is the eective radius along the
semi-major axis derived by GALFIT The images are con-
volved with a Moat-prole PSF of FWHM  016 and
  25 GALFIT precisely returns the original parame-
ters if images have no noise We also make AGs using
IRAF packages gallist and mkobjects with the same pa-
rameter sets and PSF GALFIT works well again on them
if there is no noise It is noted however that AGs made
by IRAF are dierent from those by GALFIT especially in
the center part when they are convolved with PSF The
dierence could originate from the systematic inconsis-
tency of the convolution method as noted in GALFIT
QA2 while templates of GALFIT convolved with PSF
are in good agreement with those of GIM2D Therefore
we use AGs made by GALFIT throughout this paper
After making PSF-convolved AGs with poisson noise
IRAFmknoise we bury them in the WFC3 images
at random positions Although WFC3 images are sky-
subtracted through the drizzle tasks we repeat the sky
subtraction for each postage stamp to remove the local
sky anomaly evaluated with IRAFimstat
In order to
estimate the sky background and to create the sigma im-
age GALFIT demands larger postage stamps for larger
galaxies Therefore for each galaxy we cut a square im-
age from the mosaic images with a side of rt in pixel

is large enough for applying
GALFIT to the present samples rt  500 pixels The
contamination by the neighbors easily aects the result
of GALFIT H07 and therefore it should be removed
The neighboring objects around the target galaxies are
masked out with SEGMENTATION IMAGE obtained
by SExtractor The results that GALFIT does not con-
verge or with inconsistent magnitudes between GALFIT
and SExtractor m  mGALFIT  mAUTO  10 are
discarded If neighboring objects are detected within 10
pixels from the target galaxy we also discard the tar-
get from nal results to avoid possible biases Hauler
et al 2013 We refer to the rate of galaxies for which
GALFIT converges and fullls the above criteria as success
rate It is noted that masking images sometimes cause
systematic errors in the result The errors are however
much less signicant than those due to the disturbance
by neighboring objects On top of it masking the neigh-
bors enables GALFIT to increase the successful rate The
results of GALFIT for PSF-convolved AGs with noise are
shown in Figs 2a and 2b In Fig 2a we show the input
parameters for successful and failed results The success
rate tends to be smaller for faint galaxies mainly because
of the disturbance by neighboring objects Since GALFIT
returns unbiased results for AGs with HAUTO  25 as
found in Fig 2b we set the limit magnitude HAUTO  25
for the analysis of real galaxies in the GOODS-N region
This limit covers over 90 for our sample at redshift
bins of z  30 see Fig 1b
If AGs are buried in a
clean postage stamp without any bright neighbors not
at random place in the GOODS-N images GALFIT re-
turns a higher success rate and less biased results even
at fainter magnitudes
It is noted that we use the sigma image dened by
GALFIT to estimate 2 values because the sigma image
created by the drizzle task is questionable for the present
analysis as mentioned by Gonzaga et al 2011 Using
the sigma images of GALFIT also keeps the consistency
between the simulation of AGs and the analysis of real
galaxies As described in GALFIT manual we use the
image in a unit of count rather than countsecond to
properly create sigma images The usage of images in
countsecond would give biased results see GALFIT
4 ANALYSES FOR MODS GALAXIES IN THE
GOODS-N REGION
41 Comparisons with Dierent PSFs
A PSF prole is one of the most important parameters
to be carefully treated for the morphological tting by
GALFIT Since a small change of the PSF prole some-
times leads to incorrect estimates of re and n an ap-
propriate PSF for each image should be used In that

context we estimate how dierent PSFs aect the best
t morphological parameters for galaxies In the previ-
ous studies of morphology with GALFIT there have been
two stars used median stacked stars and Tiny Tim PSF
In order to see the eect we prepare two PSF images
Firstly we stack unsaturated stars in the GOODS-N im-
age to make a PSF image FWHM  018 The sky
background of the image is subtracted Since the PSFs
of stars varies in proles on the WFC3 detector position
we choose the stars near the detector center The eect
of the PSF change is discussed below Another PSF is
Tiny Tim PSF Krist 1995 which simulates PSFs for
the HST images Since Tiny Tim PSF is not designed
for the drizzled image we drizzle it in the same manner
for the science images The self-drizzled Tiny Tim PSF
was also used in van der Wel et al 2012 where they
replaced the central pixels of the median stacked star
by Tiny Tim model PSF to make a hybrid PSF The
GALFIT results with the median stacked PSF and the
drizzled Tiny Tim PSF are compared in the left panel
of Fig 3a Although the derived m values show good
consistency re and n show non-negligible dierence es-
pecially at smaller re and larger n which also suggests a
strong correlation between re and n Bruce et al 2012
found that the Tiny Tim PSF gave galaxy sizes systemat-
ically 510 larger than those determined with a median
stacked star To investigate the origin of the inconsis-
tency we compare the proles of those PSFs in Fig 3b
The original Tiny Tim PSF diers from the other PSFs
even though the original Tiny Tim PSF is re-sampled
into the pixel scale of the drizzled PSFs The Drizzled
Tiny Tim PSF and median stacked stars look similar at
a glance In fact the FWHM of the drizzled Tiny Tim
PSF is  018 which is in good agreement with those
of stacked stars However the inner prole shows non-
negligible dierence which may causes the discrepancy
in re and n derived with those PSFs Therefore since
both of the original and drizzled Tiny Tim PSF do not
well simulate the observed PSF we adopt the median
stacked star in the following analysis It is noted that
the sub pixel osets of real PSF stars can broaden the

FWHMs of unsaturated stars in our H160 image are
found to be in the range of  018021 which are
sightly larger than those obtained by the ground test of
the instruments Bond et al 2007 and previous stud-
ies in other regions eg van der Wel et al 2012 This
could aect the morphological measurements

detector aects the nal results we stack stars on dif-
ferent positions of the detector to make two PSF images
with FWHMs  018 MedianStar1 and  021 Me-
dianStar2 The results with the PSFs are shown in the
right panel of Fig 3a where we see no signicant dif-
ference which is consistent with Akiyama et al 2008
who studied Sersic proles derived with PSFs of FWHMs
 013-021 for AO imaged high-z galaxies and found
that there was little dierence in re though they found
non-negligible dierence in n n  1 As such in what
follow we adopt the median stacked stars with FWHM
 019 for the following analysis It is noted that the
variance of FWHMs of stars are independent of their
position in the mosaic images This is reasonable for
the CANDELS observations because stacked images are
shifted and rotated each other averaging the instrumen-
tal aberrations
42 Color Eect on Galaxy Sizes
To examine the color eect on re we compare the sizes
of the galaxies obtained on two dierent images J125
and H160 of WFC3 J125 and H160 lters correspond to
the rest-frame V -band image at z  1018 and 18
30 respectively while the H160 band corresponds to the
rest-frame NIR wavelengths  0812 m at z  05
10 We examine if there are any signicant dierences
in the sizes obtained at the rest-frame optical and NIR
wavelengths In the same manner for AGs in Section 3
we analyze 1646 MODS galaxies with M  1010M at
05  z  30 in J125 and H160 bands independently We
provide the median stacked stars as a PSF image for each
lter following the previous section The comparison of
the results for 1071 common galaxies successfully tted
with GALFIT in both images is shown in Fig 4 Although
there is oset for small galaxies we see no dierence
between the radii of the galaxies at z  18 and z  18
The focus on one band could avoid extra concerns such
as PSFs and image quality Therefore in what follows
we adopt the H160 image for the analysis of the galaxies
at z  0530 in the GOODS-N region
43 Stellar Mass Correction for the Galaxies in
MODS Catalog
Before we obtain the size-stellar mass relations for
the present sample we should correct the stellar mass
of each galaxy because the ux measured through non-
parametric method would be dierent from that based
on parametric GALFIT Since the stellar masses of the

same comparison as the left panel but with two median stacked stars MedianStar1 and MedianStar2 of FWHM021
MODS galaxies were derived by using non-parametric
magnitude of Ks-band images measured by SExtractor
KAUTO we correct them into those by the model mag-
nitude of GALFIT The correction is made with a following
equation
  1004HGALFITHAUTOM
where HGALFIT is the model magnitude obtained with
GALFIT on H160 image As MODS catalog does not give
H-band non-parametric magnitude due to the shallower
observation we use those derived with H160 image The
small oset due to galaxy colors is irrelevant to magni-
tude as seen in the upper panel of Fig 5 In addition
we compare HAUTO and HGALFIT in the middle panel
where we nd no systematic dierence between the two
magnitudes non-parametric and parametric The com-
parison of M cor
and M are shown in the bottom panel of
the gure with median values for QGs and SFGs where
the dierence is found to be negligible Although the
sample selection is made based on M the size-stellar
mass relations in the following section are obtained us-

51 Size-Stellar Mass Relations for Two Galaxy
Populations
Before we derive the size-stellar mass relations we sep-
arate the present sample into QGs and SFGs in upper
panel of Fig 6 following the color selection criteria de-
scribed by Williams et al 2009 which used rest-frame
U  V and V  J colors as follows
U  V   088V  J  c
where U  V and V  J in the rest frame were obtained
with the SED-model t to galaxies The oset c is
059 and 049 for 05  z  10 and 10  z  20
respectively Additional criteria of U  V  13 and
V  J  16 are imposed on QGs at all redshifts to
exclude obscured and dusty SFGs respectively For z 
20 galaxies Williams et al 2009 concluded that there
were no visible two sequence and applied the oset for
10  z  20 which would be less reliable As such we
modied the criteria for QGs and SFGs at z  2 To
see the bimodality we use specic star-formation rate
sSF R which is derived from UV and IR-luminosity
Kennicutt 1998 see also Kajisawa et al 2010 In the
lower panel of Fig 6 we show the histograms of the two
population as a function of sSF R where we can see clear
bimodality even at z  20 We adopt the criteria for
QGs at z  20 so that the overlap of two population on
sSF R become minimum

It is noted that the average values of sSF R raise as red-
shift increases eg Daddi et al 2007 Peng et al 2010
and adopting xed sSF R for the selection of QGs is not
appropriate for our purpose It should be also noted that
adopting dierent criteria for U V J color selection eg
Whitaker et al 2011 would not change our nal results
Moreover 24 QGs detected at 24m by SpitzerMIPS
are included in SFGs Our results are hardly changed
even if we discard the dust-obscured SFGs Based on
the color selection we obtain 299 QGs and 1083 SFGs
The redshift bins are dened as in Ic12 to facilitate the
comparison We also exclude 24 galaxies with ba  01
because real galaxies have ba  01 eg Binney  de
Vauclouleurs 1981 Since the single component Sersic
t by GALFIT in the present study does not take ac-
count of the inclination the surface brightness prole
of inclined spheroidal or disk galaxies may not be pre-
sented by the prole To derive the exact light prole
for inclined galaxies we need to calculate the integrated
light prole combined with the opacity for each wave-

the present scope
The size-stellar mass relations are plotted in Figs 7
for QGs and SFGs respectively S03 obtained the rela-
tions for ETGs and late-type galaxies LTGs in the local
universe which is often compared with those at high-z
In addition we plot the relations for the central galax-
ies CENs of galaxy groups and clusters in the SDSS by
G09 though most of the galaxies in the present study are
in eld environment G09 reanalyzed the SDSS galaxies
with GALFIT and derived the relation of the stellar mass
with re whereas S03 was based on a non-parametric ra-
dius As noted in Section 6 the non-parametric radius
is systematically dierent from parametric re The stel-
lar masses for SDSS data are converted to those which
would be obtained with BC03 models Bruzual  Char-
lot 2003 and Salpeter IMF using the relations in Cimatti
et al 2008
It is clear in Figs 7 that the sizes of QGs and massive
SFGs at higher redshift are smaller than those of the
galaxies in the local universe at a given mass There
are also some massive compact galaxies whose sizes are
a factor of  5 smaller than those of typical local ETGs
The sizes of the compact galaxies are comparable to those
found by the previous studies To see the evolution of the
size-stellar mass relation we then obtain the least square
t with a following linear regression
logre  aM logM cor
 Mc  bM
where Mc is the characteristic mass for the massive galax-
ies here set to 10105 M The best t slope aM and
oset bM are shown in Fig 8 for QGs and SFGs aM for
the SFGs remains unchanged over the redshifts For QGs
at higher redshift z  20 aM is slightly higher value
with the large error because the number of the sample is
very small and incomplete The slope is consistent within
the error with those of previous studies eg Williams
et al 2010 Cimatti et al 2012

We show the size evolution of the present sample as a
function of redshift in Fig 9 In Table 3 we summarize
the median size hrei and the median absolute deviation
MAD for each redshift bin To see the dependence of
the evolution on the stellar mass we divide the sample
into the massive and less massive groups as above We
plot the local sample of early-type n  25 and late-
type n  25 CENs and their median sizes to compare
with our results the stellar masses for CENs sample are
converted into those of Salpeter IMF as done in the pre-
vious section As shown in the gure the median size for
the massive QGs is smaller than that of the local galax-
ies which evolves to the size of local galaxies over the
redshifts The larger median size of the sample at the
highest redshift bin of 25  z  30 is less reliable due
to the small sample number
We derived the regressions for the sizes of galaxies with
re  1  zre  and obtained re  106  019 for
massive QGs at 05  z  25 increase by a factor of
 25 in size over the redshift and re  056  009
 17 for massive SFGs at 05  z  30 For less
massive QGs the sizes seem to be unchanged over the
redshifts though they are not statistically robust due to
the small sample number and dierence in the range of
redshift It is noted that the local SDSS galaxies are not
included in the regression The best t values with their
errors are summarized in Table 4
Ic12 showed the weak size evolution in half-light radius
r50 for the present sample based on the ground-based
images in Ks-band The result of the weak size evolution
of Ic12 a factor  13 from z  25 to z  03 con-
tradicts with the signicant size evolution of the present
study and many other previous ones which presented the
size evolutions by a factor of  25 for the similar redshift
ranges We investigate the inconsistency of the present
results with Ic12 in Appendix A mainly focusing on the
two dierent method of size measurement of re and r50
Although Newman et al 2010 obtained a relatively
weaker evolution re  075010 for massive Mden 
1011 M eld spheroid over 0  z  16 most of
other previous study based on GALFIT have presented
the signicant evolution for QGs Franx et al 2008
re  109  007 for M  4  1010 M QGs at
05  z  35 Cimatti et al 2012 re  124  015
for ETGs at 0  z  30 Although Damjanov et
al 2011 obtained the highest value of re  162  034
for M  1010 M QGs at 02  z  27 they obtained
the regression for the sizes normalized by stellar masses
051 and their e should not be compared with
reM
SFGs in the present study weakly evolve their sizes for
both mass bins which is inconsistent with the previous
studies eg Williams et al 2010 re  077  008 and
re  132  015 for less massive and massive SFGs re-
spectively at z  20 Mosleh et al 2011 re  111013
for UV bright galaxies at 05  z  35 However
there are some dierences in analysis between the present
study and the previous two studies Firstly Williams
et al 2010 used imaging data obtained by a ground-
based telescope As discussed in Konishi et al 2011
the morphological proles for smaller galaxies were sig-
nicantly aected by seeing FWHM 05 for their Ks-
band imaging which made them unable to obtain the
reliable Sersic prole for the galaxies at z  1 It is also
noted that Williams et al 2010 constrained the out-
put Sersic index within 1  n  4 which could aect
the output re because they are strongly correlated see
Fig 3a for example while we let n down to 01 and
up to 10 and this may cause the inconsistency in e of
SFGs It turned out that however our results for SFGs
hardly changed when we constrained the output Sersic
index within 1  n  4 In Mosleh et al 2011 they
used MODS Ks-band image for the size estimation of
the U V -bright galaxies at 05  z  35 whereas most
of our sample consist of normal SFGs In addition their
U V -bright galaxies consisted of amorphous and irregular
galaxies such as submillemeter and Lyman-break galax-
ies which have been excluded in our analysis see Sec-
tion 3 and their results could not be directly compared
with ours
53 Evolution of Surface Density Proles with Redshift
As we see the size evolution of the galaxies we here
study the evolution of Sersic index n in 05  z  30
Since n represents the shape of galaxies n  1 for disk
galaxies n  4 for ellipticals its evolution would give
us clues to the formation of local galaxies In Fig 10
we show the distribution of n for each redshift bin The
gure reads the correlations among stellar mass n and
galaxy types QG and SFG On average SFGs have
constant n  1 over the redshifts irrespective of their
stellar masses while QGs have larger value though n for
both groups are widely distributed Interestingly enough
we see dierent evolution of n of the massive and less
massive QGs signicant evolution of n of the massive
QGs and no evolution of the less massive To conrm
the trend we derive the regression for n in Fig 11 with
n  1  zn for both groups In the gure we see
that median n for SFGs seems unchanged n  004
01 over z  0525 while that of n of massive QGs
signicantly increases as redshift decreases n  074
except for the highest redshift bin with the signicant er-
ror The studies for n were also done by van Dokkum et
al 2010 n  095  0015 and Patel et al 2013
n  09  01 However both of the studies se-
lected the sample irrespective of the populations QGs
and SFGs of galaxies In addition the sample were se-
lected based on a constant cumulative number density
in which the stellar mass of galaxies increases as redshift
decreases Therefore the direct comparison with those
studies would be dicult The dierent evolution of n
depending on the galaxy types and stellar masses should
be stressed especially in the view of the evolution sce-
nario which is discussed in the following section The
best t n with their errors are summarized in Table 4
6 DISCUSSION
We have obtained the size and shape of the massive
galaxies using MODS and HST WFC3 CANDELS data
in the GOODS-N region Thanks to the high image qual-
ity and depth we were allowed to analyze as faint ob-
jects as with HAUTO  25 which reaches less massive
 1010 M SFGs at z  25 QGs at z  15 and mas-
sive  10105 M SFGs at z  30 QGs at z  25
With a careful test of GALFIT analysis applying magni-
tude criteria to AGs we obtained unbiased morphologi-
cal results for the samples The tests for dierent PSFs
and color eect also improved the reliability
First we discuss the evolution of re As shown in
Fig 6 and Fig 8 we found a number of compact QGs
re  1 kpc or less at 15  z  25 which is consis-
tent with the previous studies van Dokkum et al 2009
Szomoru et al 2012 The size for massive QGs from
z  25 to  05 is represented as re  1  zre with
re  106 or a factor of  25 increase from z  25 to
 05 at a given stellar mass which is consistent with
the previous results of re  0715 a factor of  1836
size increase It is noted that SFGs have weaker size evo-
lution re  05 irrespective of their stellar mass bins
which is inconsistent with previous studies eg Mosleh
et al 2011 However the sample denition of SFGs in
the studies are dierent U V -bright galaxies in Mosleh
et al and their results could not be compared with the
present results The scenario of the size evolution for
QGs is in dispute for a decade both in theoretical eg
Fan et al 2008 Hopkins et al 2009 Naab et al 2009
Oser et al 2012 and observational studies Newman et
al 2010 van Dokkum et al 2010 According to Eq 4
in Naab et al 2009 it takes  4  2 minor merger
events with 110 310 mass ratio to explain the size evo-
lution of the massive QGs see also Bezanson et al 2009
In a merger scenario however about 10 of the massive
galaxies at z  2 are expected to have survived without
equal-mass merging Hopkins et al 2009 which leaves
the superdense QGs morphologically unchanged to the
local universe
In the SDSS and other surveys for the
local galaxies however there is not enough number of
such a superdense relic S03 Taylor et al 2010 Marmol-
Queralto et al 2012 These facts suggest that the ob-
served size evolution is hard to be explained only by the
merger scenario see also van der Wel et al 2009 Barro
et al 2013a
Secondly we discuss the shapes of the galaxies by using
n As the shape of galaxy is believed to exhibit the evo-
lution trace irrespective of the galaxy masses we discuss
the evolution of n In Fig 10 we see that the typical n of
QGs is larger than that of SFGs There is also dierence
between the evolution of n of massive and less massive
QGs though the latter are limited to z  15 due to the
completeness limit We found that n of massive QGs sig-
nicantly evolved with n  074 of n  1zn while
those of less massive QGs and SFGs were unchanged on
average n  017 and  0 respectively The nd-
ings of the evolution in n would give us a clue to un-
derstanding the morphological evolution of high-z galax-
ies One of the most favorable scenarios is the inside-
out mass growth where the mass accretion in the outer
parts of compact galaxies increase re and n toward low-z
van Dokkum et al 2010 In van Dokkum et al they
showed the evolution of n n  4 to  2 from z  2
to  05 as well as the size evolution re  3 kpc to
8 kpc over the same redshift range
In addition to the
observational results numerical simulation by Naab et
al 2009 explained the evolution of n by minor merging
of satellite galaxies As done in Chevance et al 2012
the investigation for the distribution and evolution in of
ba over the redshift range may help our understandings
for the low-n QGs which could be the progenitor of local
bulges see also Trujillo Carrasco  Ferre-Mateu 2012
though the small sample in the present study would not
give the robust conclusion
Based on the results of re and n in the present study

Note  Sample in the incomplete redshift and stellar mass bins are not included
in the regressions
we then discuss the formation and evolution of massive
QGs taking account of the evolution of less massive QGs
and SFGs as well First focusing on n less massive
SFGs at the whole redshift range 05  z  25 are
thought to be the progenitor of the less massive QGs af-
ter exhausting their gas and passively evolve with little
change in size and shape In the context the progeni-
tors of comparatively less massive QGs at high-z could
be small or amorphous SFGs located at higher redshift
z  30 Kajisawa  Yamada 2001 most of which are
not included in the present study due to our detection
limit While the sizes of QGs are smaller than those of
SFGs at the whole redshift it is believed that there are
shrinkage of extended SFGs when they transform into
QGs Barro et al 2013b The shrinkage of SFGs is also
investigated by Dekel et al 2013 in which migration
of star-forming clumps forms the blue compact galax-
ies or blue nuggets then quench into red nuggets see
also Noguchi 1999 We need more detailed investiga-
tion whether the compact galaxies keep n lower after
the migration of star-forming clumps while Williams et
al 2014 showed that blue nuggets had hni  2-3 and
red nuggets hni  3-4 Whitaker et al 2012 found very
little dierence in the sizes of young and old quenched
galaxies
After the birth of low-n red QGs in the later epoch
z  15 major or minor mergers of those dry gas-poor
QGs dominates the evolution of massive QGs enlarging
their size rapidly over the cosmic time Gao et al 2004
The dry merger is also consistent with the evolution of n
because it is eciently change the light prole of galaxy
Barnes 1992 Hernquist 1992 Naab et al 2009 while
wet gas-rich merger would reproduce disk-like galaxies
Steinmetz  Navarro 2002 Springel  Hernquist 2005
Robertson et al 2006 Cox et al 2006 On the other
hand we found no signicant evolution in re and n of
less massive QGs To explain this we might need to
consider the environmental eect on their formation or
halo mass size Dekel et al 2013 However we avoid
discussing this because of the small sample and limited
redshift range of the less massive QGs in the present
It should be noted that the argument above see also
Carollo et al 2013 is complicated by the fact that
samples of massive galaxies not separated into star-
forming and quiescent have been demonstrated to grow
smoothly with time eg van Dokkum et al 2010 Pa-
tel et al 2013 To corroborate the evolution scenario
avobe the discussion based on comoving number den-
sity for each group of galaxies would be helpful Patel
et al 2013 studied the structural evolution of massive
galaxies by linking progenitors and descendants at a con-

Fig 12 Mass-normalized size evolution for QGs top and
SFGs bottom Black dotted lines represent the regressions of
renorm  1  zre 
stant cumulative number density However small num-
ber of samples in the present study would not be enough
for the robust discussion in statistical sense The eld
variance in a small eld would also hamper the reliable
conclusion In addition the present study investigated
the evolution of re at given two mass bins while those pre-
vious studies investigated the evolution taking account
of the stellar mass evolution dierential size evolution
by using the constant number density method or mass-
normalized size The mass-normalized size is useful not
only to see the dierential size evolution but also to com-
pensate the weak completeness which could give rise to
In Fig 12 we
the biased or spurious size evolution
show the mass-normalized size evolution for QGs and
SFGs renorm is derived as renorm  reM cor
 McM 
where M is the linear slope of the size-stellar mass re-
lation for each redshift bin see Section 51 It is noted
that the relations are derived only using the sample
within the completeness limits Then we see the size evo-
lution with re  1zre nding that re  107015
for QGs and re  059  005 for SFGs which is consis-
tent with the results of massive QGs and SFGs at xed
mass bins The results ensure our results of the size
evolution over the redshift ranges while we need more
sample to investigate the weak evolution of re and n of
less massive QGs
Finally we should refer to the scatters in size at whole
redshift range comparable to that of the local populations
Fig 9 This suggests that there had already been mas-
sive QGs at z  153 whose morphological properties
were similar to that of the local ones This is encouraged
by the fact that the velocity dispersion of QGs at z  16
were found to be comparable to those of the local galax-
ies Onodera et al 2012 It should be noted however
that a single Sersic prole may not be appropriate to t
galaxies at high-z even if they seem to be well-virialized
Bruce et al 2012 applied GALFIT with two compo-
nents bulge disk massive galaxies M  1011 M
at 1  z  3 and found many bulgedisk systems In
the local universe Huang et al 2013 found the elliptical
galaxies were well tted by three components However
multi-component tting for our sample is too compli-
cated because we of the small apparent size of in partic-
ular galaxies with M  1010 M at z  1 making it
hard to nd the best-t results while we adopted a sin-
gle component Sersic t in the present study To discuss
the origin of the scatters in size we need further investi-
gation with for example mass-normalized size which is
beyond the present study

APPENDIX
A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RE AND R50
In this section we refer to the discrepant results based on non-parametric half-light radius
Ic12 obtained non-
parametric r50K by SExtractor with the ground-based Ks-band images to study the mass-size relation and claimed
much weaker size evolution for massive galaxies in the present region irrelevant to galaxy populations Since their
results would be concerned for seeing eect  05 we obtained again the half-light radius r50H  on WFC3 H160
image with smaller PSF The PSF eect is corrected for with
r50H qr50Horiginal
2  rPSF
where r50Horiginal is SExtractors original output and rPSF is the PSF radius here set to 255 pixels for the H160
image following the same process as in Ic12 In Fig A1a we compare the results of re and r50H  Such a comparison
is also reported in Fig 4 of GALFIT QA As shown in panels a and b r50H and re are biased at smaller radius
where PSF would signicantly aect The dependence on other parameters such as ba and n are clearly seen in
panel c and d of Fig A1a The dependence on ba in c is reasonably understood by the denition of two radii
in SExtractor r50 is dened as the radius of circular aperture which encircles half HAUTO while GALFIT calculates

SExtractor The symbols represents SFGs and QGs with n  25 lled blue triangles and red circles respectively and those with n  25
open blue triangles and red circles respectively a Comparison of re and r50H with a regression of r50H  arb

cd Same comparisons as b but as a function of ba and n respectively
We further investigate the discrepancy between r50 and re using the AGs in Section 33 of which results are shown
in Fig A1b We here prepare three types of AGs without convolution and sky background noise with convolution
and without sky background noise and with convolution and sky background noise r50 of convolved AGs is corrected
with Eq A1 The bottom panels in Fig A1b show the comparison of observed eective radius reobserved where we
nd no strong dependence of reobservedre on the other parameters These tests suggest that the biased results come
from not only PSF convolution but also from the other morphological parameters
To conrm the consistency in r50 of the present study and Ic12 we compare r50H  which is corrected with Eq A1
and r50K of Ic12 in Fig A2 We see no signicant dierence between them irrespective of the PSF dierence except
for the galaxies with large apparent radius which GALFIT failed to t because of large chance to be contaminated by
neighbors Figure A2 also includes the GALFIT-failed samples
In Fig A3 we show the size-stellar mass relation in r50H  Since r50H was measured based on HAUTO we use M
as the stellar mass rather than M cor
In the gures we see no signicant dierence among samples which would
deny the bias against compact galaxies although r50 would not represent re of GALFIT At a given mass the size
evolution is as mild as shown in Ic12 with Ks-band image The size evolution with re  1  zre for massive QGs
r50H is re  064  019 while that of the samples not including GALFIT-failed galaxies is re  101  019 Visual
inspection of GALFIT-failed galaxies in H160 often shows neighbors or clumps while those in ground-based Ks-images
are considered as a single object The weak size-mass relations with non-parametric radius could be originated from
those galaxies with neighbors or substructures However it is noted again that we should take into account of the
dierence of size denitions between re and r50 SExtractor denes r50 as an observed half-light radius of circular
aperture while GALFIT calculates re by assuming model galaxies with innite size Calloro et al 2013 stressed the
possible biases in both re and r50 of galaxies due to eg seeing eects and faint surface brightness As discussed
above the sizes of r50 are found to be consistent between grand-based Ks and WFC3 H160 irrespective of the large
PSF dierence In the present study the galaxies were chosen so as to have no bias in re Therefore we also found no

Fig A3 Left  Stellar mass-size relations for half-light radius r50H of QGs obtained by SExtractor including tted lled circles
and untted open circles samples by GALFIT Right  Same as the left panel but for SFGs
bias on the surface brightness r50 of galaxies with larger n would be prone to be observed smaller than the real size
eg Ichikawa et al 2010 Ic12 Calloro et al 2013 If we correct the possible bias in r50 to make them larger the
size-mass relation for r50 would lead to less size evolution which is more contradict to the signicant size evolution in
re We see the evolution of both n and re for QGs though re could be biased if there is bias in n It should be noted
that HAUTO and HGALFIT are consistent Probing the origin of the discrepancy would be beyond the present scope
