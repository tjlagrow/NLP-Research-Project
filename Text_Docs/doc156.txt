Halo clouds have been found about the three largest galaxies of
Abstract
the Local Group and in the halos of nearby spirals This suggests they are a
relatively generic feature of the galaxy evolution process and a source of fuel
for galaxy disks In this review two main sources of disk star formation fuel
satellite material and clouds condensing from the hot halo medium are discussed
and their contribution to fueling the Galaxy quantied The origin of the halo
gas of M31 and M33 is also discussed
Introduction
Beautiful stellar disks only come to be with the accretion of gaseous clouds
of star formation fuel There are several reasons why this fuel is thought to
be gradually accreted from a galaxys halo The rst is that halo gas exists
around our Galaxy and other spiral galaxies eg Oort 1970 Thilker et al
2004 Oosterloo Fraternali  Sancisi 2007 Halo gas therefore appears to be
a relatively common phenomenon and the gas velocities indicate it will not
escape from the galaxy but rather eventually fall towards the disk The second
reason is the metallicity distribution of the long-lived stars in the Galactic disk
which indicates low metallicity fuel must be continually accreted ie the G-
dwarf problem The metallicity distribution of the G and K dwarfs in the solar
neighborhood cannot be reproduced with simple closed box models and the
need for gaseous inow for the majority of the life of the disk has persisted with
further observations and increasingly complex chemical evolution models eg
Larson 1972 Fenner  Gibson 2003 Kotoneva et al 2002 Chiappini Matteucci
 Romano 2001 Magrini Corbelli  Galli 2007 Worthey et al 2005 A third
reason to bring in star formation fuel from the halo is the lack of radial gaseous
inow observed in the disk of spiral galaxies Wong et al 2004 Bringing the
outer relatively unenriched gas to the inner regions of the disk would potentially
provide a fresh source of star formation fuel
There are two main potential sources of gaseous fuel in a galaxy halo gas-
rich satellites and condensed material from the hot diuse halo The latter may
be a combination of material left from the initial collapse of baryons into the
dark matter halo stripped material from the satellites that was integrated into
this hot halo and some level of galactic fountain material at low latitudes In
this review we discuss these two reservoirs of disk star formation fuel with a
focus on the Milky Way given this is where we have the most information on the
satellite distribution and the low column density halo gas We will also discuss
the halo gas of M31 and M33 in the context of its origin and fate

or may not be associated
2 Accretion of Gas-Rich Satellites
The number of satellites in the Local Group has increased substantially recently
with the results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS eg Willman et
al 2005 Zucker et al 2006 Belokurov et al 2006 and surveys of the M31
environment eg Ibata et al 2007 The new satellites have typical V-band
luminosities of 1035 L and total masses in the 1067 M range Simon 
Geha 2007 They are found at a range of distances about both the Galaxy and
M31 Gas from satellites is generally the rst thing to be stripped as it passes
through the diuse halo medium of the larger galaxy The stripped gas will fuel
or has fueled the Galaxy and M31
Figure 1 shows the distribution of Galactic and M31 satellites in distance
and HI mass Grcevich  Putman 2008 This plot is similar to Blitz  Robishaw
2000 but is updated to incorporate new HI data optical velocities and all
of the known Local Group dwarf galaxies The majority of the dwarf galaxies
in the Local Group that still have neutral hydrogen are beyond 300 kpc from
the Galaxy and M311 In general those galaxies still with gas lie towards the
outskirts of the Local Group The gaseous detection of the new SDSS galaxy Leo

of the new SDSS gas-rich dwarf galaxy Leo T at  35 km s1 and the emission
from the Galaxy
is shown in Figure 2 see also Ryan-Weber et al 2008 The majority of the
galaxies that do not have neutral hydrogen are within  300 kpc with the
exception of Tucana and Cetus There could be a SDSS sensitivity eect for why
there are not more gas-less galaxies at large radii Koposov et al 2007 but the
result of having all of the galaxies with HI beyond 300 kpc does not change The
galaxies without gas have most likely been subjected to ram pressure stripping
eg Mayer et al 2006 but halo densities high enough to eectively strip dwarf
galaxies are not expected at radii of 150-300 kpc see Grcevich  Putman 2008
for details
The amount of gas brought into the Milky Way from the accretion of satel-
lite galaxy material can be estimated by presuming that all of its currently
gas-less satellites had their fuel assimilated into the Galactic disk Known stel-
lar streams around the Milky Way can also be included though obviously we
cannot account for the dwarfs that have also had their stellar component com-
pletely assimilated in the disk The gas-less dwarf galaxies in Figure 1 most
likely once had a similar gas mass to the dwarf galaxies with gas or  1057
M The gas-less dwarf galaxies and 4 other destroyed dwarfs traced by stellar
streams Newberg et al 2007 Belokurov et al 2007 would therefore have
contributed  1068 M of HI to fuel the Galaxy This value would increase
with the inclusion of the satellites molecular and ionized gas but it is unlikely
to increase by more than a factor of two eg Leroy et al 2007 Chemical
evolution models of the Galactic disk typically require an average infall rate of
1 Myr over the past 5-7 Gyr Chiappini et al 2001 and therefore the dwarf
galaxies appear to provide sucient fuel for only  108 years
It should be
noted that the 1 Myr is an average rate of infall and it should be closer to
half that value today Chiappini this proceedings In any case to accomplish
the average of 1 Myr from only the accretion of gas from small dwarf galaxies
would require an average of 300 accretion events per Gyr This is extremely
high compared to the predictions of CDM models Zentner et al 2005 and
the number of satellites we currently see in the halo
Putman Grcevich Peek
There is a source of gaseous fuel associated with Galactic satellites that has
not yet been discussed the Magellanic System This system is currently at  55
kpc and consists of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds and the Magellanic
Stream and Leading Arm that are being stripped from the Clouds Putman et
al 2003 The Magellanic System will eventually contribute  109 M of fuel
just in neutral hydrogen to the Galaxy Galaxies such as the Magellanic Clouds
and larger bodies may have contributed to fueling the Galaxy and M31 in the
past In this case only an average of 1 accretion event per gigayear would be
required however the stability of the disk would most likely be an issue Stewart
et al 2007
3 Condensing Halo Clouds
In the discussion of satellite galaxy material above the focus was on the accretion
of gas directly in the cold form Another method a galaxy can obtain star
formation fuel is by accreting clouds that have condensed within the hot halo
medium This hot halo is predicted to originate from the initial collapse of
baryons into the dark matter potential well but currently it would be a mixture
of this material stripped satellite gas that was integrated into the halo before
reaching the disk and galactic fountain material or hot gas rising into the halo
from the cumulative eect of supernovae in the disk Recent galaxy formation
and evolution models have the hot halo gas gradually cool over time with halo
clouds forming from thermal instabilities Maller  Bullock 2004 Lin  Murray
2000 This is in contrast to the original models that have all of the hot halo gas
cool and fall in at early times White  Rees 1978 White  Frenk 1991 The
recent models predict at z  0 the existence of both a hot halo medium that
hides a large percentage of a galaxys baryons and cool halo clouds that will
gradually fuel the disk Maller  Bullock 2004 Sommer-Larsen 2006 Kaufmann
et al 2006 Fukugita  Peebles 2006 Connors et al 2006
Both cool halo clouds and a hot diuse medium are found in the Galactic
halo The cool halo clouds are the high-velocity clouds HVCs  neutral hydro-
gen clouds with velocities that are inconsistent with simple models of Galactic
disk rotation Wakker  van Woerden 1997 Putman et al 2002 The hot
diuse halo medium is largely detected indirectly through the structure of halo
clouds eg Peek et al 2007 and the detection of high-velocity O VI absorption
associated with the interaction of the halo clouds and this medium Sembach
et al 2003 There are also constraints on the properties of the diuse halo
medium from x-ray absorption line detections Fang et al 2006 Wang et al
2005 Williams et al 2005 Figure 3 shows examples of head-tail clouds formed
in the Galactic halo as HVCs move through the diuse halo medium With
Fabian Heitsch we are simulating this process to reproduce the structure of the
observed head-tail clouds and probe the properties of the diuse halo medium
In Peek Putman  Sommer-Larsen 2008 we examined the link between
the observed HVCs and the clouds produced in a high-resolution SPH cosmo-
logical simulation of galaxy formation The simulation includes chemical evolu-
tion supernova feedback and radiative cooling with an extragalactic UV eld
see Sommer-Larsen Gotz  Portinari 2003 for more details A resolution of
3  105 M for halo clouds was reached by nding a Milky Way Vc  220 km

s1 M 1012 M in a lower resolution simulation and then tracing it back and
replacing one particle with 12 at z  04 and then one particle with 8 particles
 02 Gyr later The simulation was then run for another 05 Gyr and the halo
cloud population examined at several timesteps
The simulated and observed halo clouds are found throughout the Galactic
sky at distances below 60 kpc There has been substantial recent progress
on constraining the distances to the observed HVCs using direct and indirect
methods eg Thom et al 2007 Westmeier et al 2007 The simulated
clouds have an average Galactic Standard of Rest velocity of VGSR  65
to 85 km s1 depending on the location of the Sun in the simulation which
is comparable to the observed HVC average velocity of VGSR  85 km s1 
The mass of the simulated clouds can be converted to an observed ux with
the known distance and by assuming a sensible ionized component  50
ionized The simulated cloud uxes individual and total are also found to
be comparable to the observed HVCs A large percentage of the ux from the
simulated clouds comes from a few nearby complexes which is also the case for
the Galactic HVCs ie Complex C Peek et al 2008 present the gures that
support the comparisons discussed in this paragraph
Putman Grcevich Peek
The observed and simulated halo clouds show many similarities indicating
many HVCs may represent clouds condensing from a hot halo medium The
accretion rate of these clouds can be determined from the simulation and is
found to be  02 Myr onto the galaxys disk Figure 4 shows the infall rate of
simulated clouds onto subsequent galactic radii The gradually increasing infall
rate shows that clouds are created andor grow at all radii The convergence of
the infall rate at 02 Myr is at z  0 and this accretion rate is predicted to be
much greater at higher redshifts consistent with the higher star formation rate
Sommer-Larsen et al 2003

simulation The dotted line represents where the accretion rate can no long
be accurately determined because the clouds are merging with the disk See
Peek et al 2008 for details
4 Halo Gas of other Spiral Galaxies
The previous sections focus on the accretion of gas onto the Galactic disk Up
until recently the Milky Way was the only galaxy with a known halo cloud
population with the exception of some detections of large halo features similar
to the Magellanic Stream  108 M in nearby galaxies eg Ryder et al
2001 Hibbard et al 2001 New receivers and larger allocations of telescope
time have allowed deep HI surveys of nearby spiral galaxies to be completed and
these surveys are beginning to indicate cold halo clouds are a common property
of spiral galaxies The Local Group spirals are discussed here but see also the
deep HI observations of other nearby spirals where additional halo clouds are
observed eg Fraternali et al 2001 Oosterloo et al 2007 Heald et al this
proceedings Battaglia et al 2006 Boomsma et al 2005
M31 is our closest spiral of similar size to the Milky Way and was found to
have numerous halo clouds by Thilker et al 2004 The population of clouds
detected is within 50 kpc of M31 and has a total HI mass of a few 107 M
Westmeier et al 2007 later showed there are no additional clouds at larger
radii Several of the M31 halo clouds are in the vicinity of the giant stellar
stream to the south of M31 and NGC 205 while others appear to be completely

isolated The clouds in the vicinity of satellites may be remnants of their gaseous
components but they may also represent clouds formed in instabilities in the
hot halo medium created by the passage of the satellite The isolated M31 halo
clouds are most likely condensed clouds although they could also represent the
remnants of clouds stripped from satellites at earlier times The velocities of the
clouds relative to M31 and the known satellites may cast some light on the most
likely origin eg see gure 3 of Peek et al 2008 The total mass in M31s HI
halo clouds is within a factor of three of the Galaxys population if you adopt
the distance constraint of  60 kpc for the Galactic halo clouds and exclude the
Magellanic Stream Putman 2006
M33 also has clouds in its halo Figure 5 shows the preliminary GALFA
channel maps of M33 Two main halo features can be noted in this gure
though additional clouds at lower contour levels are evident in the data cube
The rst feature is most predominant at  d  1h31m 315 and -240 to -260
km s1 but continues beyond this velocity range and spatially wraps around
to join the northern side of M33s warped disk The second halo feature is a
small cloud with a lament to the main galaxy at  d  1h325m 295 which
is most evident at -148 km s1 see also Westmeier et al 2005 The rst
halo cloud feature potentially has an interesting link to what may be a stellar
overdensity in the maps of Ibata et al 2007 but given the limited coverage
of their current survey it is unclear if this is actually a distinct stellar feature
The potential continuation of this northern HI emission towards M31 Braun 
Thilker 2004 appears to be due to contamination by a cloud that merges with
Galactic emission in the GALFA data The GALFA data extends up to d 
345 and with its sensitivity 3  4  1018 cm2 in the 11 km s1 channels
shown in Figure 5 and resolution 35 and 02 km s1 reveals the detailed
kinematic and spatial structure of numerous low velocity clouds that continue
into the Galactic disk This link to Galactic emission would have been partially
obscured in the Braun  Thilker data with the smoothing and exclusion of
examining Galactic emission
The nding of halo clouds around M33 is somewhat surprising given M33
is only 110 the mass of the Milky Way 5  1010 M Corbelli 2003 Models
do not generally expect a galaxy of this size to have a large amount of mass
locked up in its halo at z  0 Maller  Bullock 2004 The clouds in the halo
of M33 may represent the cold accretion mode that is expected to dominate
for galaxies of this mass Keres et al 2005 or the structures may represent
the gradual destruction of M33 by M31 which is now  200 kpc away The
recent proper motion measurements of M33 by Brunthaler et al 2005 have
been used by several authors to put constraints on the motion of M31 and
its impact on M33 Loeb et al
2005 rule out a large region in parameter
space because of the lack of disruption evident in the stellar component of M33
van der Marel  Guhathakurta 2007 use the motion of M33 along with the
motions of other Local Group satellites to calculate the most likely motion of
M31 The most likely transverse velocity for M31 has M33 on a tightly bound
orbit and signatures of disruption are therefore likely Muratov and Gnedin
at the University of Michigan are completing more detailed orbit calculations
and nding similar results The HI features discussed here are most likely the
beginning of this disruption process and the disruption is currently only evident
in the extended gaseous component similar to the Magellanic Clouds
Putman Grcevich Peek
possible M33 will eventually form giant HI features akin to those found in the
Magellanic System as it approaches perigalacticon Both of these systems have
a similar total HI mass 1  2  109 M and will provide a substantial amount
of fuel to the galaxies

is labeled in the upper left Contours are 02 04 08 16 32 K The lowest
velocity channel shows some of the Galactic emission that overlaps with the
emission from M33
5 Conclusions
There is growing evidence that gas clouds in galaxy halos are a common phe-
nomenon and a natural part of the galaxy evolution process This halo gas is
part of accreting satellites in some cases but some of the clouds are consistent
with a condensing cloud model The hot material the clouds condense out of
at z  0 most likely consists of a mixture of materials that has been gradually
enriched over time Since the medium is thought to be responsible for much
of the stripping of dwarf galaxies Mayer et al 2006 and extends out to at
least 55 kpc as evident from the observations of clouds in the Magellanic Stream
Stanimirovic et al 2002 Putman et al 2003 Sembach et al 2003 it is un-
likely to all originate from feedback from the Galaxy itself In fountain scenarios
the hot gas generally rises to only  10 kpc Booth  Theuns 2007 de Avillez
Disk Fuel
2000 One plausible scenario is the hot halo is created with the initial collapse
of baryons into the dark matter potential well and is supplemented through time
with fountain material and stripped gas from satellite galaxies
In terms of the Local Group galaxies the three largest galaxies all show
evidence for HI halo clouds with a total mass in clouds of  10785 M This is
not a large reservoir of gas in the context of the chemical evolution models but
with a continual new supply through incoming gas-rich satellites and condensing
clouds it may be sucient at z  0 Presumably both of these sources were more
abundant at higher redshift The future may be bright for both the Milky Way
and M31 in the context of future star formation fuel with the accretion of gas
from the Magellanic System for the Milky Way and possibly M33s gas for M31
There may also be additional Leo Ts sitting at the outskirts of the Local Group
that will serve as future Galactic and M31 morsels The role of the diuse halo
of these galaxies will be further probed with observations and simulations of the
head-tail clouds and new results from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
