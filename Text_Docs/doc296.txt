Nut goddess of the sky in ancient Egyptian religion Contrary to most other religions the
sky was feminine and her brother Geb personied the Earth At dusk Nut would swallow
the sun god Ra who would pass through her belly during the night and be reborn at dawn
Sometimes she was depicted as a cow but most of the time as a star-covered nude woman
arching over and protecting the Earth

GALAXY EVOLUTION
ABSTRACT
It remains a quest for modern astronomy to answer what main mechanisms set the star forma-
tion rate SFR of galaxies Massive galaxies present a good starting point for such a quest due
to their relatively easy detection at every redshift Since stars form out of cold and dense gas a
comprehensive model for galaxy evolution should explain any observed connection between
SFR and the amount and properties of the molecular gas of the interstellar medium ISM In
proposed models of that kind an active galactic nucleus AGN phase is often invoked as the
cause for the decrease or cease of star formation This thesis consists of models and observa-
tions of gas and AGNs in massive galaxies at z  2 and how they may affect the overall SFR
and the subsequent evolutionary trajectory of massive galaxies to z  0
For an improved understanding of how observed gas emission lines link to the under-
lying ISM physics a new code is presented SImulator of GAlaxy Millimetersubmillimeter
Emission SGAME By post-processing the outputs of cosmological simulations of galaxy for-
mation with sub-grid physics recipes SGAME divides the ISM into different gas phases and
derives density and temperature structure with locally resolved radiation elds In the rst
study SGAME is combined with the radiative transfer code LIME to model the spectral line
energy distribution SLED of CO A CO SLED close to that of the Milky Way is found for nor-
mal star-forming massive galaxies at z  2 but with CO-H2 conversion factors about 3 times
smaller and decreasing towards the center of each model galaxy In a second study SGAME
is adapted to model the ne-structure line of singly ionized carbon CII at 158 m the most
powerful emission line of neutral ISM Applying SGAME to the same type of galaxies most
CII emission can be traced back to the PDRs Photodissociation Regions of their ISM but at
higher SFR the molecular component starts to dominate while the contribution from HII gas
is always negligible The relation between CII luminosity and SFR of the simulated galaxies
displays a steeper slope than that observed for galaxies at z  05 A corresponding relation is
also established on kpc scales for the rst time theoretically
A third study uncovers the presence of AGNs among massive galaxies at z  2 and sheds
light on the AGN-host co-evolution by connecting the fraction and luminosity of AGNs with
galaxy properties By analyzing a large survey in X-ray AGNs of high and low X-ray luminos-
ity are extracted among massive galaxies at z  2 via AGN classication methods and stacking
techniques in X-ray It is found that about every fth massive galaxy quenched or not contains
an X-ray luminous AGN Interestingly an even higher fraction of low-luminosity AGNs reside
in the X-ray undetected galaxies and preferentially in the quenched ones lending support to
the importance of AGNs in impeding star formation during galaxy evolution

BACKGROUND
Do not feel lonely the entire Universe is inside you - Rumi1
While Europeans were taking their medieval nap Arabs carried astronomy forward Not
only did they collect and combine the astronomy from eg Greece Egypt and India into one
mathematical language they also made contributions to the Ptolemaic system and created in-
struments such as celestial globes astrolabs and large observatories Their motivation was
mostly a practical one of wanting to determine prayer times and the direction to Mecca to high
accuracy But what might the Arabs have thought for themselves while looking up at the stars
While this will remain unknown we now know that most of that twinkling in the sky comes
from our home the Milky Way Stars in the Milky Way are organized in a slowly rotating disk
of spiral arms embraced by an additional spheroidal component the bulge If you are lucky
you can even see a diffuse and milky band which is the combined light from millions of un-
resolved stars in this disk What you cant see with your naked eye is all the gas and dust
out of which new stars are born Nor can you see the dark matter emitting no light at all and
believed to inhabit a large sphere embracing the Milky Way entirely We call such an assembly
of baryonic and dark matter a galaxy and the Universe is full of them Understanding how
these galaxies form and evolve while making room for us2 is one of the fundamental aims
of modern astronomy This thesis is about the gas and the black hole component in galaxies
A theoretical model is developed to simulate the amount and state of gas in galaxies as well
as its emission A separate study uncovers the fraction of massive galaxies dominated by the
powerful energetics created by their central black hole during an important cosmic epoch To-
gether these projects offer a better view of galaxy evolution and will be useful for predicting
and interpreting future observations
101 SETTING THE SCALE
The nite speed of light is of great value to astronomers because it allows us to look back
in time In fact astronomical distances both within and between galaxies are measured in
light years ly the distance light can travel in 1 year or parsecs 1 pc  326 ly On top of
that the expansion of the Universe causes light to stretch as it traverses the great expanses
between galaxies The amount of stretching serves as a label on every photon saying how
far it has been traveling We call this the redshift of light z and often use it as a measure of
1Persian poet and Su mystic of the 13th century
2In at least one case
distance from us or age of the Universe Fig 11 provides a quick callibration between age of
the Universe and redshift
Figure 11 A scale comparing age of the Universe with redshift across its total lifespan of  138 Gyr Note that
the redshift drops with age in a exponential-like behaviour meaning that the Universe reached half its age at quite
low redshift z  07 Photons decoupled from matter at z  1100 only  378000 yr after the Big Bang and that
is as far back as we can observe The ages have been calculated according to the now generally accepted spatially at
CDM cosmology model that describes the composition of the Universe with just six parameters xed here to the
most recent results by the Planck Collaboration et al 2015
102 THE COSMIC WEB OF GALAXIES
Galaxies are not evenly distributed in space but rather follow the underlying cosmic web of
dark matter that attracts the gas via gravitation Fig 12 is a map carried out by Colless et al
2001 of galaxies close to the MW and out to z  03 over a total sky area of 2000 deg2 or
almost 5  of the total sky Like a Swiss cheese there are regions with very low density of
galaxies so-called voids and other regions with many galaxies living close together clusters
connected by laments and sheets It has been conrmed by observations that in the latter
highly concentrated regions galaxies are prone to interact and possibly merge into even bigger
ones Galaxies are therefore not isolated systems that go about their own business but are
constantly inuenced by their surroundings via eg mergers tidal strippings and gas inow
from the Intra Cluster Medium ICM In some of the following sections we will describe their
internal components and inner workings treating them as isolated systems but one should
never forget that galaxies in general interact with their surroundings
NORMAL STAR-FORMING GALAXIES
Galaxies come in a great variety from containing few stars dwarf galaxies to containing many
stars massive galaxies from compact to extended from star-forming to inactive quiescent in
the following and with different compositions of stars gas dust and dark matter That said
most of them follow a basic rule The more stars they have the more stars they form In other
words plotted in a star formation rate SFR vs stellar mass M diagram most galaxies fall
on a power law relation called the main sequence MS The evolution of this sequence with
cosmic time has been investigated recently by Speagle et al 2014 who compiled 25 studies
from the existing literature to nd that the MS evolves towards higher SFR as we look back in
time This is shown in Fig 13 with best ts to the observations at different redshifts without
plotting individual galaxies for the sake of simplicity
Figure 12 Map of galaxies around us and out to z  03 from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey by Colless et al
2001 who studied two strips on the sky one in the northern left and one in the southern right hemisphere
Figure 13 Main sequence evolution Power law ts to star-forming galaxies in different redshift bins from the
compilation study of Speagle et al 2014 Shaded areas show an estimated true scatter of 02 dex
Hence like in crazy adolescent years back in the day galaxies used to produce stars at much
higher rates The slope of the SFR-M relations shown in Fig 13 is also called the specic star
formation rate SSFR  SFRM and with very few galaxies at high-redshift it is still hard
to say whether the SSFR continues to rise with redshift or reaches a plateau Behroozi et al
2013 Speagle et al 2014
111 THE TURNING POINT AT z  2
If one measures SFR per volume there is a maximum in cosmic SFR density SFRD at z  2
after which it starts to decline again as shown in Fig 14 The epoch around z  2 or about 10
billion years ago is therefore an interesting one of phase change and one that we are just now
beginning to uncover with modern telescopes see Section 15
Figure 14 The evolution of cosmic SFR density SFRD with redshift from the review of Madau  Dickinson 2014
112 THE CASE OF MASSIVE GALAXIES
To understand how galaxies evolved since their formation some million years after the Big
Bang we need observations of all types of galaxies from high redshift until now This task
is impeded by the difculty of resolving a galaxy very far away because galaxies start to ap-
pear very dim and small The degree at which a large survey such as the 2dF Survey in
Fig 12 is capturing all galaxies of a certain mass is referred to as completeness The state-of-
the-art Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey CANDELS carried out
with the Hubble Space Telescope HST looks all the way back to the high-redshift universe
z  8 with observations of different exposure time depth But even in the deep elds of
GOODS-SouthNorth a typical lower mass limit of 1010 Mcid12 must be adopted to ensure 100 
completeness for studies going out to z  25 see eg Wuyts et al 2012 In the smaller Ultra
Deep Fields UDFs CANDELS can reach the same mass out to z  3 due to longer exposure
times3 Hartley et al 2013 But galaxies with stellar masses below these limits may exist that
these surveys are incapable of detecting with available telescopes and integration time For this
reason massive ie with high stellar mass galaxies represent a convenient sample because
3see httpcandelsucolickorgsurveyfilesfergusonSTUC1102v2pdf
they are relatively easy to detect at all redshifts My work concerns mainly massive galaxies
so this denomination will occur frequently in the present dissertation and the exact mass range
will always be dened for each particular study
12 THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM ISM
Lets return for a moment to the sparkling stars
that you may observe on a clear night What
you cant see with your naked eye is all the
material lling out the vast spaces in between
those stars the Interstellar Medium or ISM But
it is out of this mixture of gas and dust that
stars are born the stars that expel heavier el-
ements during their explosive deaths thereby
providing the universe with the atoms that we
are ultimately made of Carl Sagan once said
that we are made of starstuff yet stars would
never have been formed had it not been for the
gas that was already there Fig 15 shows an
example of what surprises lie in wait once tele-
scopes are tuned to the frequencies at which
the gas lights up in the ISM The blue image
is made of stellar light emission from the An-
tennae Galaxies  two colliding spiral galaxies
about 70 million ly away from us  and the red
image is a composite of observations with the interferometric array ALMA to be described in

Whether a cloud of gas in a galaxy can fragment and collapse to a density that allows fusion
ie the ignition of a new star depends on the properties of that gas The efciency by which
the gas forms stars is characterised by the gas depletion time tdep
tdep  mgasSFR
that is the time it would take to use up a cloud of mass mgas if the current SFR stayed constant
Naively one might expect that tdep would be close to the time it takes a cloud to collapse onto
itself under the inuence of gravity only also called the free-fall time t But observations
show that tdep is typically 1-3 orders of magnitude longer than t requiring the existence of
processes that slow down the star formation rate resulting from pure gravitation These pro-
cesses are broadly gathered under the term feedback from either nearby star formation see
review by Krumholz et al 2014 or the powerful radiation from an Active Galactic Nucleus
see Section 131
Feedback on star formation is a whole topic in itself under erce exploration with obser-
vations and theoretical models An example of one strong type of feedback is the ionizing
eld from young stars Stars of masses  10 M emit large quantities of ionizing photons cre-
ating large bubbles of expanding hot ionized gas that can hit nearby cold clouds and prevent
them from collapsing in a type of explosive feedback Krumholz et al 2014 Dale et al 2012
However recent simulations by Dale et al 2012 show that the effect of expanding regions of
ionized gas in turbulent clouds depends strongly on the escape velocities in the gas Fig 16
illustrates with snapshots from their simulations how photoionization only has a signicant
impact in clouds of escape velocities as set by the cloud mass and size below about 10 km s1
This example shows that feedback from star formation involves many intercoupled processes
Other types of stellar feedback include those of protostellar outows radiation pressure from
massive stars winds from hot stars supernovae explosions and the mere thermal energy in-
jected into the gas as gravitational potential energy is released during the collapse In addition
nature most likely combines these mechanisms with the inuence of magnetic elds eg Price
 Bate 2009
Figure 16 Left Column density map of a simulation of star cluster formation in a gas cloud with escape velocity
 10 km s1 White dots represent individual stars Right The same but for an escape velocity of  10 km s1 in
which case star formation is supressed Adapted from Krumholz et al 2014
In principle being able to observe the composition turbulence temperature density and
magnetic elds of the same gas cloud to high angular precision would provide the building
blocks for uniquely dening star formation on small  50 pc scales Therefore being able to
characterise the gas in terms of these properties will help explain why some massive galaxies at z  2
are quiescent while others are even more star-forming than their local counterparts
121 CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
Before galaxies formed the universe was pervaded by a primordial gas of only 4 atomic species
hydrogen H helium He and a trace of lithium Li and beryllium Be as well as a few of
their isotopes These were created from about 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang4 but
any elements heavier than Lithium and Beryllium had to wait for the formation of the rst stars
a few hundreds of million years later in order to be produced Today hydrogen and helium
continue to be the dominant species found in the local ISM of the MW with gas mass fractions
4see httpwwwastrouclaeduwrightBBNShtml
of  715  and  271  respectively compared to only 14  of heavier elements denoted
metals eg Przybilla et al 2008
All atoms in the ISM can exist in atomic form or be ionized to several degrees or be com-
bined in molecules of increasing complexity see Tielens 2013 for an overview of just how com-
plicated these molecules can get For the general life of a galaxy however only a subset of
these species needs to be considered for the structure and thermal state of the ISM relevant for
star formation as we shall see in the next subsections
122 DISTRIBUTION AND DENSITY
Stars form generally in clusters as the simulated one depicted in Fig 16 Krumholz et al 2014
Such constructions of dense knots and long laments are collectively called Giant Molecular
Clouds GMCs and are observed to have radii from about 5 to  100 pc in the MW and local
galaxies Blitz et al 2007 From measuring the broadening of emission lines from the gas and
converting those into velocity dispersions one can get an estimate of the mass by assuming
the cloud to be in virial equilibirum Roman-Duval et al 2010

This was done by for example Blitz et al 2007 who found the mass spectrum shown to the
left in Fig 17 the data of which can be tted with a power law of slope 171 in the outer MW

of the chemical stratication taking place in the PDR of a GMC from Papadopoulos  Thi 2013
The reason why all gas in the galaxy is not neutral and forming molecules is mainly the
strong far-ultraviolet FUV radiation eld from young stars which ionizes the gas and creates
a stratication of the ISM as illustrated on the right-hand side of Fig 17 The region of stratied
layers is also referred to as the Photodissociation Region PDR In addition to ionizing the FUV
radiation penetrates into the gas and determines its thermal and chemical state This results
in a set of distinct phases of the ISM that have been observationally identied and are listed
in Table 11 After the dense molecular gas comes the warm and cold neutral medium often
collectively named WCNM and nally the least dense ionized gas HII
If we take a look at the densities listed in Table 11 it is clear that the ISM is in general very

density nH  106 cm3 in order to have the same gas mass as present in 1 cm3 of air at sea
level on Earth with density   12 kg m3
Gas mass and SFR are related via the Kennicutt-Schmidt KS law which is an observed
tight relation between surface density of SFR SFR and gas gas As will be explained in
further detail in Part I the line emission from the CO molecule is particularly well suited for
estimating the total gas mass The KS-law for low and high-z star-forming galaxies was esti-
mated by Genzel et al 2010 using a large data base of CO line observations and SFRs based
on several SFR indicators
log SFR Mcid12 yr1 kpc
2  117  log gas Mcid12 pc2  348
However recent observations show that this correlation might break down already on scales
of  100 pc Xu et al 2015
123 THERMAL STATE
The thermal state of the ISM is complicated by the fact that the ISM is never in thermodynamic
equilibrium but rather always subject to a ow of energy It is constantly being heated pri-
marily by FUV radiation from young stars while radiating away the heat via dust emission in
the infrared and mostly FIR gas emission lines see Section 14 for more on the spectrum of
a galaxy To derive the gas kinetic temperature Tk one must therefore consider all relevant
heating and cooling mechanisms calculate their energy rates and search for an equilibrium
temperature
Out in the hot ionized HII regions see Table 11 gas is heated by photo-ionization of HI
gas FUV photons ionize the hydrogen atoms and the free electrons convert their kinetic en-
ergy to heat via collisions with other gas particles Cosmic rays are very energetic protons
most likely produced in supernovae Ackermann et al 2013 and they represent a second ra-
diation eld that can heat the gas and penetrate even further into it than FUV photons due
to their high energies  GeV Like FUV photons cosmic rays can ionize the atomic gas and
release electrons with kinetic energy but cosmic rays can also interact with the free electrons
transferring kinetic energy directly via Coulomb interactions
As for cooling the gas has several options First of all emission lines from hydrogen and
heavier elements in their atomic and ionized states can remove a great deal of energy espe-
cially at Tk  104 K The cooling rates as function of Tk for the most important elements are
shown in Fig 18 The sudden rise in cooling rate at Tk  104 K makes sure that the temperature
of the HII gas hardly ever exceeds 104 K
Figure 18 Cooling rates of all black and individual atoms and ions in the hot ISM as function of temperature Made
with the publicly available code of Wiersma et al 2009 which includes both collisional- and photo-ionization though
collisional ionization equilibrium CIE has been used for this plot The code takes Tk and nH as input of which nH is
set to 001 cm3 here and solar abundances are adopted
In addition to these emission lines electron recombination with ions can cool the gas as
recombining electrons take away kinetic energy from the plasma a process which is important
at temperatures  103 K Wolre et al 2003 At similar high temperatures another important
cooling mechanism is the scattering of free electrons off of other free ions whereby free-free
emission removes energy from the gas Draine 2011
Combining all of the above heating and cooling mechanisms we arrive at one equation that
describes the balance between the energy rates of heating and cooling
PI  CRHI  ionsatoms  rec  ff
where PI and CRHI are the heating rates for photo-ionization and cosmic ray ionization
respectively whereas ionsatoms is the combined cooling rate from the elements shown in
Fig 18 Finally rec and ff are the cooling rates due to recombination and free-free interac-
tions as described above
In the denser and colder Tk  104 K WCNM other heating and cooling mechanisms take
over Rather than photo-ionizing the gas FUV photons now heat the gas more efciently via
the photo-electric effect consisting of a FUV photon knocking loose an electron from the surface
of a dust grain with the same net result The escaping electron can deposit its kinetic energy
as heat in the surrounding gas The dominating cooling mechanisms in neutral gas are ne-
structure line emission from ioinised carbon CII to be discussed in more detail in Section 51
in Part I and from neutral atomic oxygen OI leading to the following energy rate equation
PE  CRHI  CII  OI
where PE is the heating rate due to the photo-electric effect on dust grains CII is the cooling
rate due to CII line emission and OI is the cooling rate due to OI line emission In addition
the Lyman alpha Ly- line of hydrogen at 1216  is important in the warm part of the WCNM
In molecular gas most of the FUV radiation will be attenuated by dust and self-shielding
molecules leaving in some cases cosmic rays as the dominant source of heating Indeed it
has been suggested that cosmic rays control the initial conditions for star formation in regions
of high SFR density where the sites for star formation might be completely UV-shielded Pa-
padopoulos et al 2011 Papadopoulos  Thi 2013 The prescription for cosmic ray heating
per hydrogen atom in molecular gas is in principle different from its form in neutral gas but
the two turn out to be very similar Stahler  Palla 2005 though see Glassgold et al 2012
who nd higher heating rates in molecular gas by a factor 2-3 At increasingly higher temper-
ature CII line cooling gives way for CO line cooling and at very high densities  104 cm3
cooling by interactions between gas and dust particles can become dominating as the gas ap-
proaches the dust temperature In molecular gas line cooling from molecular hydrogen and
atomic oxygen also contributes to the cooling rate with typically smaller amounts Summa-
rized in one equation the thermal equilibrium in molecular gas can hence be approximated
PE  CRH2  H2  CO  OI  CII  gasdust

13 THE ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEUS AGN
Apart from the gas dust stars and dark matter that I mentioned in the beginning of this in-
troduction there is a fth component in the MW black holes A particularly big one or su-
permassive black hole SMBH is hiding at the very center of the MW and most likely every
galaxy as it became clear in the 90s Magorrian et al 1998
The strong gravitational pull from a SMBH creates a rotating accretion disk of matter yel-
low part in Fig 110 from its host galaxy As gravitational energy is converted into mechanical
and electromagnetic energy gas in the accretion disk is heated to very high temperatures and
starts to radiate ercefully over a broad range of energies from radio to X-ray see Krawczynski
 Treister 2013 for a review of the inner workings of these central engines
Galaxies in which the spectra are dominated by this type of central energy source are called
Active Galactic Nuclei AGNs Observationally AGNs have been classied into two main
groups Seyfert type I and type II based on the width of their optical emission lines Type I
AGNs show strong broad emission lines while type II AGNs have relatively narrow emission
lines and softer X-ray emission In some cases relativistic jets are produced perpendicularly
to the accretion disk and their strong synchroton radiation in radio has led to the classication
radio-loud AGNs AGNs for which the optical light from the host galaxy is outshined by the
central disk itself are dubbed quasars QSOs
131 UNIFICATION MODELS
Over the past two decades observations have led to the Standard Unied Model suggesting
that type I and type II AGNs are intrinsically the same class of objects but viewed from dif-
ferent angles as pictured in Fig 110 Bianchi et al 2012 In this picture the accretion disk
is surrounded by a clumpy torus of gas and dust and outow is mainly allowed within the
ionization cone encircling the relativistic jets A type I AGN is a galaxy inclined so that we see
the inner parts of the accretion disk where high orbital speeds result in relatively broad lines
A type II AGN is orientated so that the inner accretion disk is obscured by the clumpy torus
and only narrow lines from more distant cold material can be observed
A tight correlation between optical and X-ray emission of unobscured quasars suggest that
all luminous AGNs are intrinsically also X-ray bright eg Steffen et al 2006 Gibson et al
2008 But high amounts of obscuring gas and dust in the torus and elsewhere in the host
galaxy can decrease the X-ray luminosity or change the spectral slope of the X-ray emission
that actually escapes the galaxy to be discussed further in Section 131 Alternative sources
for strong X-ray emission in a galaxy are High-Mass X-ray Binary systems HMXBs which
may be signicant in case of high SFR Ranalli et al 2003 and halos of hot gas Mulchaey

14 THE SPECTRAL FINGERPRINT OF A GALAXY
The best way to measure the condi-
tions of gas in the ISM is by taking
a spectral ngerprint
Fig 111 is a
cartoon version of the spectral energy
distribution SED of a galaxy if we
were able to measure its emission from
the smallest wavelengths x-ray to the
longest  1 cm of interest for the ISM
Furthermore the SED is shown in the
rest frame of the galaxy rather than in
the observers frame in which the SED
would be red-shifted to longer wave-
lengths if the galaxy happened to be at
high redshift The unit is Jansky 
Jy  1026 W
m2Hz which is a typical
ux unit in radio astronomy The SED
shown in Fig 111 is that of a typical
star-forming spiral galaxy taken from
the publicly available SED templates of
Kirkpatrick et al 2012 with an addi-
tional imaginative X-ray ux measure-
ment corresponding to an X-ray lumi-

edupopeKirkpatrick2012
First noticeable are the two bumps at wavelengths around 1 m and 100 m The rst one
is dominated by direct stellar light at ultraviolet UV to near-infrared NIR wavelengths The
UV light is mainly produced by young massive stars recently formed and therefore traces the
current SFR well since massive stars have relatively short lifetimes On the other hand the
NIR ux is primarily consisting of light from old less massive stars making NIR luminosity a
good tracer of total stellar mass Good estimates of SFR and M can be made simultaneously
by tting the entire SED with stellar population synthesis models typically only requiring
assumptions about the initial mass function IMF of stars as they are born the SFR history
and the metallicity For example the SFRs in Fig 14 were created assuming a Salpeter IMF
Salpeter 1955
The second bump is caused by dust that absorbs light at many wavelengths but it is a
particularly powerful absorber of far-ultraviolet FUV  100-200 nm radiation which is re-
emitted again in the infrared IR  1-1000 m thus reprocessing the emitted starlight The
shape of the dust bump can most of the time be approximated by a combination of a modied
blackbody a greybody xed at the temperature of the dust and a power law in the mid-
infrared MIR as described in detail by Casey 2012 and shown with an example in Fig 112
On top of the dust peak a few important gas emission lines are shown namely the CO blue
and CII red lines that will be described in detail in Part I
Figure 112 Examples of how the spectra in MIR to FIR caused by dust in a galaxy can be approximated by either
several greybodies of different dust temperature left or one greybody combined with a power law at high energies
right Adapted from Casey 2012 who presented the latter simplied FIR SED tting technique
In order to analyze the gas component of a galaxy there are basically two relevant regimes
in wavelength both of which are indicated with grey areas in the gure
X-ray regime Thermal emission from galactic and extra-galactic hot ionized gas
Sub-mm regime Gas emission lines from colder more neutral gas
This thesis implements observational and theoretical techniques in both of these regimes as
will be summarized in Section 22
15 AN EXCITING TIME FOR OBSERVATIONS
Facilities for observing gas and dust in galaxies accross cosmic time are experiencing a true
revolution that is gradually opening our eyes towards normal galaxies at high redshifts Here
I will briey go through the most important radio and X-ray telescopes in use or preparation
151 RADIO TELESCOPES
Probably the most impressive effort in this regard has been the Atacama Large Millimeter Ar-
ray ALMA even if still under contruction For an idea of its capabilities already in 2011 when
the rst scientic observations with ALMA began see the image in Fig 15 made with only 12
antennas When completed ALMA will comprise 50 antennas of 12 metres in diameter acting
as a single telescope and with a very high spatial resolution thanks to the art of interferometry
An additional 4 12-m and 12 7-m antennas will create a compact array in the centre Together
the 66 antennas each weighing  100 tons can be moved with special designed vehicles into
different congurations with maximum antenna distances from 150 m to an astonishing 16 km
A more extended conguration corresponds to
a higher spatial resolution but also a lower
sensitivity towards larger more extended
sources on the sky a trade-off that must be
considered when planning observations With
bands of high spectral resolution from 312 m
to 356 mm and 2 extra bands going down to
about 74 mm possibly added in the future
ALMA will be able to detect CII and CO lines
in a normal galaxy at z  3 in a matter of
hours For the next cycle of observations Cy-
cle 3 starting in October 2015 ALMA is antic-
ipated to encompass a total of 48 antennas with
most receiver bands available

stood ready for the ALMA Early Science cycle The ar-
ray is located on the Chajnantor Plateu at 5000 m above
sea level in Atacama desert of northern Chile Credit
ALMA ESONAOJNRAOW Garnier ALMA
In the Northern Hemisphere The NOrth-
ern Extended Millimeter Array NOEMA5 for-
mer PdBI will be upon completion in 2019 the
facility in the Northen Hemisphere that comes closest to the capabilities of ALMA with bands
for observing in the 808 m-37 mm range At longer wavelengths the Jansky Very Large Ar-
ray JVLA is currently the superior radio interferometer covering from 06 to 30 cm with 27
antennas of diameter 25 m Napier 2006 A number of single-dish radio telescopes can also
target gas and dust emission at high redshifts the LMT IRAM-30m GBT Onsala 2025m
ARO NMA and APEX to name a few
An overview of ALMA EVLA and NOEMA is intended with Fig 114 comparing the po-
sition of their frequency bands with the SED including CII and CO lines of a typical star-
forming galaxy at z  2

radio interferometers shown in color The SED has been scaled to 30 Jy at 3 mm corresponding to typical massive
disk galaxies at z  2 Dannerbauer et al 2009 The dashed lines in the ALMA bands correspond to 3 after 5 hrs
integration time with the full ALMA

The James Webb Space Telescope JWST scheduled to launch in 2018 will be an improved
version of the famous Hubble Space Telescope HST expected to stay in operation until 2020
covering 06 to 28 m with the same resolution in NIR as HST has in the optical
Between the long wavelength range of EVLAALMA and the shorter of JWST ground-
based observations are hampered by atmospheric absorption but new space missions are
awaiting approval for adventuring into the MIR 28-312 m regime FIRSPEX is a satellite mis-
sion to continue the success of the Herschel Space Observatory Herschel that ran out of fuel
in 2013 The primary goal of FIRSPEX is to carry out a wide survey of the MW in CII NII
CI and CO6  56 possibly detecting nearby galaxies as well that are redshifted into these
bands SPICA is a similar mission of  2 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity in the FIR
than Herschel and wavelength coverage from 5 to  210 m Goicoechea  Nakagawa 2011
152 X-RAY TELESCOPES
To observe an AGN in X-ray one has to escape the ob-
scuring atmosphere of the Earth which has led to many
space missions since the beginnings of the 1980s
The Chandra X-ray 0110 keV observatory has been
in orbit around the Earth since 1999 and has dedicated 2
and 4 Ms to observing the Chandra Deep Field North and
South respectively CDF-N and CDF-S The large cov-
ering areas of roughly 450 arcmin2 for each have proven
ideal for detecting AGNs at redshifts z  01 52 Bauer
et al 2004 Xue et al 2011 Similar missions though
of lower spatial resolution include the XMM-Newton
ROSAT and Suzaku At higher energies the nuclear
spectroscopic telescope array Nustar has been observing
from space at 3  79 keV since 2012

ing ASTRO-H when in orbit at an altitude

The ASTRO-H mission see Fig 115 is the latest in a
long row of Japanese X-ray satellites though ASTRO-H
is being developed in a collaboration between Japanese
ISASJAXA and US NASAGSFC institutions
will among other things investigate the X-ray reection
signatures of AGN with increased sensitivity for the soft X-rays as compared to Chandra
Reynolds et al 2014 Astrosat is Indias rst dedicated astronomy satellite and has the advan-
tage of allowing simultaneous multi-wavelength observations at UV and X-ray wavelengths
It will have two bands for detecting X-rays 3-80 keV and 10-150 keV and a large effective area
in the hard X-ray band to facilitate studies of highly variable sources such as AGN Paul 2013

16 GALAXY SIMULATIONS
With so many coupled mechanisms in a galaxy
on scales from sub-parsecs to kilo-parsecs the
advantage of running numerical simulations
of galaxy evolution has proven tremendous
Galaxy simulations can be roughly divided
into two kinds Cosmological simulations that
start out with the small density pertubations
of dark matter shortly after the Big Bang and
more idealized disk simulations that start out
with an analytical density prole for the galaxy
and allow gravitational and electromagnetic
forces to perturb the galaxy in time I will focus
on the former kind as that is what my theoreti-
cal projects build on see Parts I and II
The series of images in Fig 116 illustrate
how a cosmological simulation works with
snapshots from high redshift z  4 and un-
til now z  0 of the dark matter structures
and the resulting gas mass distribution In the
present CDM cosmological model dark mat-
ter formed structures or minihalos before
baryonic gas could cool and collapse Cosmo-
logical simulations therefore focus on model-
ing an underlying dark matter structure left-
hand side of Fig 116 at the same time as
the baryonic component of the universe is al-
lowed to condense in these structures via grav-
ity dissipation and radiation right-hand side
of Fig 116 As the universe ages laments
and knots in the dark matter density distri-
bution become more pronounced and infalling
gas cools enough to form stars and galaxies in
regions of high concentration
Figure 116 1065 Mpc wide on each side column den-
sity maps are shown of simulated dark matter left and
gas column densities right from z  4 until now bot-
tom to top Brightest colors in the column density plot
correspond to a density of  104 Mcid12kpc3 The im-
ages are from the Illustris Project  one of the most com-
prehensive cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of
galaxy formation to date Vogelsberger et al 2014 The
recently developed moving-mesh code AREPO Springel
2010 was used to follow DM and gas dynamics
The universe is then believed to have pro-
ceeded via hierarchical structure formation in
which small gravitationally bound structures
such as stars and galaxies form rst followed by groups clusters and superclusters of galax-
ies not to mention the cosmic web in between them cf Fig 12
It was soon realized though that these large-scale simulations with resolutions going down
to kpc-scales could not capture the actual physics inside galaxies where the most important
processes take place on  1 pc scales In particular simulations on smaller scales proved that
localized feedback is needed in order to avoid overpredicting the star formation rate and to
agree with the observed IMF of star clusters Tasker 2011 Krumholz et al 2011 Hopkins
et al 2011 Made possible by an increasing computing power and technology cosmological
galaxy simulations have seen two big revolutions since their beginning in the early 90s as
illustrated in Fig 117 of which we are in the middle of the last one the zoom-in simulations
ZOOM-IN SIMULATIONS
The concept behind zoom-in simulations is to select a galaxy at low redshift in a cosmological
simulation of low resolution cid38 1 kpc and trace the particles or cells comprising it back in
time to the beginning of the simulation A re-simulation is then initiated with much higher
resolution but only following the particlescells that end up in the galaxy of interest This
re-simulation may take days or months but provides the opportunity to follow star formation
on realistic scales while staying in agreement with the overall large scale structure Two com-
putational techniques exist for treating the gas hydrodynamically at the necessary resolution
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic SPH simulations The gas is represented by particles
with properties such as mass density and temperature in addition to a smoothing kernel that
roughly speaking smears the particles out across a volume in space Resolution is increased
simply by increasing the number of particles while reducing their mass in order to keep mass
conservation
Adaptive Mesh Renement AMR simulations The gas is divided into cells that can be sub-
divided in areas where higher resolution is needed All interactions between gas cells take
place as masstemperaturepressure exchange through the cell partition walls
Examples of SPH codes include GA D G E T and GA S O L I N E whereas AR T EN Z O and RA M S E S
are AMR codes Kim et al 2014 presented with the AGORA project a comparison of these in
terms of resolution physics of the ISM feedback and galactic outows But see also Springel
2010 for a novel combination of the two methods
162 THE CALIBRATION TO z  0
While the initial conditions for galaxy formation and evolution are relatively strict by eg mea-
surements of the Cosmic Microwave Background CMB and the nal endpoint is anchored
with z  0 observations what goes on in between is less well-dened by observations Com-
mon tests for the evaluation of a cosmological simulation focus on how well it can reproduce
the observed main sequence and luminosity functions at low- to high-z Although simulations
on the whole agree with observations a discrepancy still persists at the time of maximum cos-
mic star formation 1 cid46 z cid46 3 where the simulated main sequence is a factor  2  3 below
the observed one eg Furlong et al 2014 Possible explanations include an IMF that changes
with redshift and galaxy properties rather than staying xed to the locally observed one as
most simulations assume or feedback from stellar winds supernovae and AGN that is not
properly accounted for in simulations eg Dav 2008 Narayanan  Dav 2012 Sparre et al
2015 Until more resolved observations of ISM at z cid38 2 are obtained simulations of galaxy
evolution are forced to make and be inhibitted by extrapolations to high-z of local ISM physics
and star-formation laws Some of these restrictions will be discussed in Part I

INTRODUCTION TO THIS THESIS
21 EVOLUTION OF MASSIVE GALAXIES ACROSS COSMIC TIME
With the previous brief description of the internal composition of galaxies and the observa-
tional and theoretical tools used for characterising them we are now ready to take a look at the
populations of massive galaxies so far uncovered and the current status on creating a consistent
picture for their evolution with cosmic time
211 HIGH-REDSHIFT MASSIVE GALAXY POPULATIONS
An important fact to bear in mind when studying galaxy evolution is that we are never observ-
ing the same galaxy at various epochs in the life of the universe At each redshift the most we
can do is observe galaxies in a snapshot of their lifetime and often any evolutionary connection
between galaxies observed at different redshifts is hampered by different selection techniques
and incompleteness we cannot detect all galaxies at every redshift cf Section 112
The ideal way of classifying galaxies at all redshifts would be to measure their entire SED
like the one shown in Fig 111 via spectroscopy But since this would be very time-consuming
clever methods have been developed to rst select a candidate group of the galaxies that might
be of interest and then perform high-resolution spectroscopy on these Such methods typically
build on photometry  measuring the total ux through a limited set of photometric bands
by applying lters that only allow certain ranges in wavelength For selecting galaxies of a
certain mass the K-band centered on 22 m in the NIR is particularly useful since it captures
light from primarily old stellar populations that dominate the mass budget of most galaxies
Therefore a lower cut in K-band luminosity directly translates into a minimum stellar mass
Cimatti 2003 Follow-up spectroscopy can then determine the redshift stellar mass and SFR
to higher precision with SED tting methods see Man et al 2012 Cimatti et al 2004 for
applications of this method This method works out to z  4 where the K-band starts to trace
rest-frame UV light which unlike NIR or optical is dominated by the strong radiation from
young stars and is therefore a tracer of the amount of current star formation rather than stellar
At z cid38 3 another way to classify galaxies is typically via their current amount of star
formation This star formation can be either un-obscured as revealed in rest-frame UV or  in
galaxies of high dust amount  obscured resulting in high FIR luminosities dust continuum
bump in Fig 111 or a combination of the two Two examples of the rst approach are the
Lyman Break Galaxies LBGs and BzK-selected galaxies whereas the second approach has
revealed a group of very dusty galaxies the Sub-mm Galaxies SMGs or nowadays Dusty
Star-forming Galaxies DSFGs Casey et al 2014
LBGs are selected to have a strong break and reduced ux at the wavelength    912 
This break is caused by neutral hydrogen gas residing inside the galaxy and in the Inter Galactic
Medium IGM absorbing light at wavelengths below 912  the threshold for ionizing hydro-
gen The LBG technique requires that the galaxy be UV bright relatively star-forming and
not dust-obscured Steidel et al 2003 The advantage of the LBG technique is that it makes a
preselection of not only SFR but also redshift by restricting the location of the break Carilli
et al 2008 used a method called stacking see application of this in X-ray in Part II to nd
that LBGs at z  3 have SFRs of 31 7 Mcid12 yr1 that is not very high on the MS at that redshift
cf Fig 13
The BzK-selection takes advantage of absorption in stellar atmospheres creating a strong
break at  4000  so that three photometric bands B z and K can effectively be used to
select galaxies at 14 cid46 z cid46 25 and roughly estimate their SFR Daddi et al 2004 Similar
groups of color-selected galaxies are those of BX and BM galaxies selected via their color in
the three UV and optical lters Un G and R Adelberger et al 2004 Steidel et al 2004 The
color criteria for BX galaxies restricts them to lie at 20  z  25 while the BM galaxies lie at
15  z  20 Both techniques give rise to slightly higher SFRs than the BzK-selection would
as shown by Reddy et al 2005 using X-ray inferred bolometric SFRs
SMGs on the other hand are selected for
having a strong rest-frame NIR emission and
were rst detected with the ground-based in-
strument SCUBA at 850 m eg Smail et al
1997 Hughes et al 1998 Barger et al 1999
soon followed by surveys including the use of
instruments such as MAMBO at 12 mm and
AzTEC at 11 mm Coppin et al 2005 Chap-
man et al 2005 Greve et al 2008 Perera et al
2008 The advantage of looking in the rest-
frame 1  3 mm wavelength range at high red-
shift is that the ux stays roughly the same
owing to the effect of negative K-correction
as illustrated in Fig 21 Due to this effect
SMGs have been identied mainly at z  2
but with a tail extending up to z  5 Chap-
man et al 2005 Wardlow et al 2011 Simp-
son et al 2014 Converting the high IR lumi-
nosities to dust-obscured SFRs implies SFRs of
 100  1000 Mcid12 yr1 Karim et al 2013 For
the most part SMGs display disturbed stellar morpohologies andor kinematics as compared
to normal non-interacting rotating disks suggesting recent or ongoing merger events eg Con-
selice et al 2003 Chen et al 2015 The disturbed signatures are backed up by molecular emis-
sion line observations of clumps of dense and highly star-forming gas in SMGs eg Tacconi
et al 2008 Riechers et al 2011 Hodge et al 2012
Figure 21 Observed ux densities for a typical dusty
star-forming galaxy as presented in the review by Casey
et al 2014 Note the nearly-constant ux density in the
 1 mm bands accross 1 cid46 z cid46 10 redshift range
212 OBSERVING GALAXIES AT z  4 VIA THEIR GAS EMISSION LINES
In the early z  4 universe very few normal star-forming galaxies have so far been detected
typically via the LBG technique see Behroozi et al 2013 for a compilation and even fewer
quiescent galaxies have been discovered at z cid38 25 with the most distant ones at z  3 Gobat
et al 2012 Fan et al 2013 Only one galaxy at z  7 has so far had its redshift determined from
spectroscopy of its stellar continuum But the galaxy A1689-zD1 at z  75 02 has now been
detected in dust emission with ALMA resulting in a combined UVIR SFR of  12 Mcid12 yr1
Watson et al 2015 ie a normal star-forming galaxy In addition to dust continuum ALMA
can also detect line emission from the gas thereby determining redshifts and characterizing the
ISM at the same time for normal star-forming galaxies see more on this in the Outlook section
of Part I An example of such an emission line is CII from singly ionized carbon which is
expected to be the most luminous cooling line in neutral gas We return with a more detailed
description of CII in Chapter 6 but mention here that at z  5-7 the CII line falls in bands
6-7 of ALMA currently the most sensitive millimeter interferometer by an order of magnitude
and therefore a promising tool for detecting CII in normal star-forming galaxies at z  6
Indeed it has been detected in and around normal star-forming galaxies at z  5 7 Maiolino
et al 2015 Capak et al 2015 Our only way of characterizing the ISM of high-z galaxies might very
well be to observe emission lines from the gas
213 THE RED AND BLUE GALAXIES
The local galaxy population is bimodal in terms of UV-to-optical color with a distinct group of
blue star-forming galaxies and another of red quiescent galaxies Strateva et al 2001 Schaw-
inski et al 2014 This is shown with color-mass diagrams in Fig 22 for low redshift galaxies
The connection between color and star formation activity is a result of younger stars having
relatively bluer colors than old stars which emit their light predominantly at longer opti-
cal and NIR wavelengths Historically the red and blue galaxies are also called early and
late-type galaxies from the morphological classication of Hubble 1926 In general late type
galaxies display stellar disks with spiral arms and exponential light proles whereas the stellar
light from early-type galaxies or sometimes named ellipticals is more concentrated with even
structures and no clear sign of spiral arms But detailed observations or their stellar popula-
tions have later shown that this naming makes sense since the nearby red galaxies most likely
formed much earlier than the blue ones eg Kartaltepe et al 2014 As always dust plays
an important role and can make star-forming galaxies appear red by absorbing the blue light
and re-emitting it in the FIR Indeed Sodr et al 2013 showed that some local galaxies with
extremely red colors are reddened by dust more than by older redder stellar populations
But the diagrams in Fig 22 have been corrected for reddening by dust by measuring the dust
extinction in optical light
In between the red and the blue group lies the green valley with very few galaxies There
is a discussion about how many of these green galaxies are actually late-type galaxies being
quenched Pan et al 2013 Schawinski et al 2007 and how many are early-type galaxies with
star formation initiated recently in a sort of rejuvenation Fang et al 2012 In Section 11
the main sequence MS of star formation was introduced and Fig 13 showed how the MS
grows towards higher SFR with redshift Blue galaxies lie on the MS relation whereas red
galaxies lie below and typically at high stellar mass One of the biggest quest in astronomy for
understanding galaxy evolution is Why did blue galaxies form more stars at higher redshift
Figure 22 The UV-optical color bimodality of 002  z  005 galaxies as measured by Schawinski et al 2014
using the SDSSGALEXGalaxy Zoo data The 00 in 00u refers to the K-correction of the observed color to z  0
see Section 211 Green lines indicate the green valley in between the two galaxy populations
By now the division into quiescent or star-forming has been observationally conrmed out
to z  3 Kriek et al 2008 Williams et al 2009 Viero et al 2013 Man et al 2014 leading to
a second equally important question When did the onset of the red sequence take place and what
caused it
214 QUENCHING STAR FORMATION
AGNs are one of the preferred hypothesized mechanisms for quenching star formation as
radiation winds and jets from the central accreting black hole can remove the gas or heat it
so that contraction of molecular clouds cannot take place see Fabian 2012 and McNamara 
Nulsen 2007 for a reviews on models and observational evidence A distinction is made be-
tween quasar mode by which feedback from an AGN ejects all gas from the galaxies Granato
et al 2004 and radio mode during which powerful jets heat the circumgalactic medium to
such high temperatures that further accretion of cold gas onto the galaxy is prevented Croton
et al 2006 Semi-analytical simulations by eg Di Matteo et al 2005 show how reasonable
descriptions of the AGN feedback on star formation in elliptical galaxies can reproduce the
observed local mass function
In addition to quenching by AGNs possibly ignited by a major merger the environment
in which the galaxy lives is believed to raise further quenching mechanisms This suspicion
came from observations showing that galaxies in clusters are in general more quenched and
passive than eld galaxies Verdugo et al 2008 Similar to AGNs most of these proposed
internalexternal mechanisms have to do with the removal distribution or heating of gas ie
the fuel for further star formation This can happen via galaxy-galaxy interactions or inuence
by the Intra Cluster Medium ICM itself The following are some of the more popular environ-
mental quenching mechanisms but see reviews by eg Boselli  Gavazzi 2006 and Blanton 
Moustakas 2009 for a much more complete overview i Harassment when during close en-
counters or direct mergers galaxies alter each others morphology Moore et al 1998 ii Ram
pressure stripping where galaxies traveling through the ICM at high speed have their ISM
shock-heated and eventually stripped off ending up in the cluster as seen in observations of
individual cases and proposed by several simulations eg Steinhauser et al 2012 Bsch et al
2013 Ebeling et al 2014 iii Tidal stripping by which galaxies passing through the ICM feel
the global tidal eld of their host signicantly altering their morphologies Villalobos et al
2014 iv Cosmological starvation or strangulation when the hot gas halo around a galaxy
is removed due to hydrodynamical interactions with the ICM and further infall of gas is pre-
vented causing the galaxy to slowly run out of fuel on time scales of a few Gyr Balogh et al
2000 Bekki et al 2002 Feldmann  Mayer 2015 v Compactness quenching as suggested
by observations of satellites in the outskirts of haloes that show a strong correlation between
quenching and compactness of the galaxy Woo et al 2015
These last types of quenching mechanisms are also referred to collectively as satellite quench-
ing because they primarily happen to satellite galaxies in a cluster However it has been
hypothesized that satellite quenching and that of AGN also called mass-quenching are ac-
tually manifestations of the same underlying process Carollo et al 2014 Knobel et al 2015
215 CONNECTING THE DOTS
The fact that the red sequence is already in place at z  2 means that we have to push even
further out in redshift in order to nd the onset of this dead population and with that hope-
fully also the murder weapon In addition half of the most massive galaxies M  1011 Mcid12
at z  2 are already compact and quiescent galaxies CQGs with old stellar populations eg
Toft et al 2007 van Dokkum et al 2008 Szomoru et al 2012 The stellar spectra suggest that
major starburst events took place in CQGs some 1-2 Gyr prior to the time of observation but
were quenched by mechanisms either internal or external or both to the galaxy eg Gobat
et al 2012 Whitaker et al 2013 van de Sande et al 2013 So far very few have CQGs have
been found in the present-day universe eg Trujillo et al 2009 Taylor et al 2010 though see
also Graham et al 2015 who suggest that CQGs could be hiding in the local universe as the
bulges of spheroidal galaxies having grown an additional 2D disk over the past 9-11 Gyr
It is still an open question what kind of galaxy evolution leads to the CQGs observed at
z  2 and how they increased in size without increasing their SFR signicantly down to
z  0 for which a size increase by a factor of  3  6 is required eg Trujillo et al 2006
Toft et al 2007 Szomoru et al 2012 Basically three formation scenarios have been put forth
i Massive CQGs formed in a monolithic way assembling most of their mass at z  2  3
and then puffed up by adiabatic expansion into the big red ellipticals we see today eg
Bezanson et al 2009 Damjanov et al 2009
ii A similar scenario to i but CQGs enhanced their size from z  2 to 0 by inside-out growth
most likely due to merging with other small galaxies minor merging following a type of
hierarchical structure formation like the dark matter Naab et al 2009 Oser et al 2012 The
minor merging scenario is in good agreement with the observed metallicity gradients Kim 
Im 2013 and stellar kinematics eg van de Sande et al 2013 Arnold et al 2014 in z  0
quiescent galaxies
iii The third possibility requires a bit more thought Compared to star-forming galaxies local
quiescent galaxies are more massive at the same SFR but also slightly smaller at the same mass
for redshifts out to z  2 This can be seen in Fig 23 which shows the main sequence of
galaxies including the quiescent ones below it from z  0 to z  2 The average size of the
quiescent population could grow with time simply if recently quenched larger star-forming
galaxies are constantly being added to the sample as time moves forward Trujillo et al 2012
Poggianti et al 2013 Krogager et al 2014 eg This hypothesis also goes under the name
progenitor bias However Belli et al 2015 argued that for at least half of all CQGs at z  2
the increase in size until z  15 must have taken place via growth rather than additions of
increasingly larger galaxies to the sample
Figure 23 Galaxy SFR-mass diagrams in three redshift bins colorcoded by size which is expressed as a circularized
effective radius from tting a Srsic prole to the rest frame visible or NIR depending on redshift From Wuyts et al
2011 who study galaxies from various large samples including CANDELS see Section 112
The potential quenching by AGNs has led to the
idea of a fast evolutionary path from compact star-
bursting galaxy at z  3 to a galaxy quenched by AGN
feedback some 1 2 Gyr later and via size-growth to a
larger however still quiescent galaxy at z  0 This is il-
lustrated in Fig 24 as an early-track route Barro et al
2013 In addition Barro et al 2013 suggest a late-track
evolutionary path by which larger z  2 star-forming
galaxies slowly turn off star formation between z  2
and z  0 without passing through a compact phase
This idea was expanded upon by Williams et al 2014
who suggest that massive compact galaxies take the
fast route and quench sooner than the normally-sized
LBGs at z  2  3
Galaxy mergers present the kind of violent events
that are required for the early-track route In partic-
ular simulations have shown that gas-rich wet merg-
ers can lead to bursts of star formation but that gas is
driven towards the center via dissipation and may ignite an AGN Wet mergers can increase
the stellar mass but leave a more compact remnant whereas gas-poor dry mergers can build
up a galaxy in mass and size without altering star formation too much see Lin et al 2008
Figure 24 Two suggested evolutionary
paths from star-forming galaxies at z  2  3
to quiescent galaxies at z  0 Barro et al
and references therein In addition major mergers are those between galaxies of similar mass
whereas minor mergers are those in which the stellar masses differ by a factor of at least  4
Man et al 2014
In order to nd the actual progenitors and descendants for that matter of the CQGs we
have to look outside the MS consisting of normal galaxies Fig 25 illustrates an evolutionary
sequence connecting z cid38 3 SMGs through compact quiescent z  2 galaxies to local elliptical
ones Hopkins et al 2006 Ricciardelli et al 2010 Toft et al 2014 Marchesini et al 2014
Here gas-rich major mergers in the early universe trigger a short time period 4240
29 Myr of
high SFR in the form of a nuclear dust-enshrouded starbursts that we observe as an SMG
That star formation is subsequently quenched either due to gas exhaustion feedback from the
starburst itself or the ignition of an AGN What is left behind is a compact stellar remnant
that is observed as a CQG about a Gyr after at z  2 Finally the CQGs grow gradually and
primarily through minor merging into the elliptical galaxies that we observe today
Figure 25 The proposed evolutionary sequence by Toft et al 2014 going from major gas-rich mergers at high
redshift left to local elliptical quiescent galaxies right
But observations of merger rates in massive galaxies at z  3  0 show that major and
minor merging is not enough to bring the CQGs to the sizes of locally observed early-type
galaxies suggesting that other mechanisms are needed for the size growth Man et al 2014
And as summarized in Section 214 there are many alternative ways to quench star formation
in addition to the powerful feedback of an AGN In order to understand evolution of massive
galaxies at high redshifts it is fundamental to nd out which of these mechanisms dominate
and when
22 THIS THESIS
The two fundamental questions about galaxy evolution that were posed in the beginning of
this chapter in Section 213 could both be related to the observed main sequence of star for-
mation MS see Section 11
1 Why does the MS evolve towards higher SFR with redshift
2 What causes some galaxies to be outliers to the MS or quiescent galaxies
These issues are illustrated in Fig 26 and compose the focus of this thesis Stars form out
of gas and it would therefore seem natural that these questions translate into At what rate did
galaxies acquire and use up their gas mass The larger part of my thesis focuses on the gas content
of galaxies on which the following subsection expands upon
Figure 26 Plots showing the MS at various redshifts from Speagle et al 2014 illustrating the two open questions
that need to be answered in order to understand galaxy evolution across cosmic time 1 Why the MS evolves towards
higher SFR with redshift and 2 Why some galaxies are hardly forming stars creating a group of red quiescent galaxies
observed all the way out to redshift 3 Contours in the left-hand plot show the position of star-forming galaxies at
14  z25 from the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey Whitaker et al 2011
221 ALL EYES ON THE GAS
Most of the above-mentioned mechanisms depend in one way or another on gas amount as
summarized below
 The gas content together with the amount of inoutow of gas sets the fuel available for star
formation and thereby a 1st order estimate of how long the galaxy can continue producing
stars at the current SFR
 Removal or heating of this gas is what quenches star formation and is an important mile-
stone in the life of massive galaxies
 Mergers and the resulting triggering of an AGN are often invoked as a quenching mech-
anism but the outcome of a merger depends critically on how gas-rich the merging galaxies
As mentioned in section 11 typical galaxies spend 95  of their lifetime since z  1 within
a factor 4 of their average SFR at a given M Noeske et al 2007 In light of this most of the
evolution in the MS where galaxies spend most of their lives might be due to a rising gas mass
fraction with redshift The general consensus is that galaxies at higher redshift were denitely
more gas-rich but the very few observations at z  3 make this statement hard to quantify as
Fig 27 illustrates This gure shows the gas mass fraction dened as fgas  MgasMgas  M
as a function of redshift and reveals the uncertainty in its evolution at z cid38 2
Another topic related to the gas and under current debate is whether the KS law intro-
duced in Section 122 might be different in normal galaxies compared to starburst galaxies or
mergers as shown in Fig 28 though such conclusions depend critically on how the gas mass
is determined a topic we return to in Part I
A huge missing piece to the puzzle is therefore knowledge of the gas and dust in massive
galaxies especially at z cid38 2 The premonition shared by several research groups is that future
observations of the gas and dust content morphology and dynamics in high-z MS and quies-
cent galaxies will solve the puzzle Carilli  Walter 2013 Blain 2015 As put by Glazebrook
2013 we need to consider the fuel as well as the re As mentioned in 15 it is now possible
with radio telescopes such as ALMA JVLA and NOEMA to access the high-redshift domain

carried out resolved CO2-1 observations of the z  405 SMG GN20 shown with cyan squares GN20 lies signif-
icantly above the relation for local MS galaxies contours together with two other strongly lensed resolved SMGs
magenta diamonds and green triangles unresolved SMGs blue crosses and red plus-signs and local ultraluminous
infrared galaxies ULIRGs black plus-signs Close to the local MS galaxies are z  12 massive star-forming galaxies
yellow upside-down triangles z  1  3 color-selected galaxies black open circles and z  15 BzK galaxies green
crosses See references for these observations in Hodge et al 2015
where the red sequence must have formed
To answer the above questions we not only need to observe the gas at high redshift in more
detail we also need to know how to interpret those observations better
222 QUICK SUMMARY OF MY PROJECTS
I have worked on improving our knowledge of the evolutionary state of massive galaxies at
z  2 with regard to 3 aspects
 Amount and distribution of molecular gas in the ISM
A key species for studying the gas in the ISM was already introduced in Chapter 1 Sec-
tion 122 and will be described in detail in Part I carbonmonoxide CO I used galaxy
simulations and developed sub-grid procedures that could be combined with radiative
transfer calculations in order to improve predictions for the use of CO lines to estimate
the amount and distribution of molecular gas in the ISM of normal star-forming galaxies
at z  2 SGAME see Part I Chapter 3
 Tracing SFR on local and global scales
The line emission of C has been used to trace SFR and various phases of the ISM in-
cluding neutral and ionized gas but it holds many mysteries with its exact origin still un-
known Combining galaxy simulations with sub-grid procedures I developed a method
for modeling CII line emission in order to study its origin in the ISM and make predic-
tions for its use as a star formation tracer at z  2 SGAME see Part I Chapter 5
 Importance of AGNs in massive galaxies at z  2
By analyzing Chandra X-ray data from a sample of galaxies at 15 cid46 z cid46 25 including
the stacked signal from low-luminosity sources I derive the fraction of luminous and
low-luminosity AGNs in star-forming as well as in quiescent massive galaxies see Part
At the beginning of the following chapters some additional background is provided on the
specic techniques used in the above listed project and each chapter will be followed by a list
of references

Part I
Modeling the ISM of z  2 galaxies
with SGAME
CO EMISSION LINES FROM GALAXIES
31 PROBING THE MOLECULAR GAS
Due to the high abundance of hydrogen the most common molecule to nd in the ISM is by
far H2 But in terms of observing cold molecular gas H2 is practically invisible because the
lack of an electric dipole moment means that the lowest possible rotational transitions of H2
are electric quadrupole moments with very high energy The rst rotational transition S0 is
at 510 K meaning that even the lowest roational transitions can only be excited in shock waves
FUV-rich PDRs or regions affected by turbulent dissipation Ingalls et al 2011
The second most abundant molecule is car-
bonmonoxide CO consisting of one carbon
and one oxygen atom The abundance relative
to H2 COH2 is roughly 104 in MW ISM as
has been determined via observations of early
cold cores in the MW Glover  Mac Low 2011
Liu et al 2013 and simulations of molecular
clouds with nH cid38 1000 cm3 Glover  Mac
Low 2011
CO is the most used molecule for observing
molecular gas since its rotational transitions
conveniently sample the typical densities and
temperatures inside GMCs To prope the very
densest parts of GMCs other molecular trac-
ers exist with higher critical densities again see
Tielens 2013 for an overview of most detected
molecules and Aalto 2013 for a subset of the
denser gas tracers but the low CO lines have
proven excellent for capturing the mayority of
the molecular gas
Fig 31 provides an illustration of the rotat-
Figure 31 Illustration of the rotating CO molecules to-
gether with the frequencies of the rst 5 rotational lines
of the CO molecular are shown Below are the corre-
sponding critical densities ncrit  Aulicid54uCui as cal-
culated by Greve et al 2014 for a kinetic temperature
of Tk  40 K and assuming H2 to be the main collision
partner
ing CO molecule together with the frequencies and critical densities of the rst 5 transitions
Also the positions of the rst 5 transitions on a typical SED can be seen in Fig 111 In GMCs
the excitation of CO molecules to higher rotational levels is believed to come mainly from
collisions with H2 molecules The population of the various rotional levels are therefore deter-
mined by density and temperature how fast the molecules are moving of the gas The amount
of ux in each rotational transition creates a CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution SLED or
CO ladder which can take on different shapes depending on the gas properties
32 OBSERVATIONS OF CO LINE EMISSION FROM DIFFERENT
TYPES OF GALAXIES AT z cid38 2
At z  2 the vast majority of CO observations have been of extreme galaxies such as submil-
limeter galaxies SMGs with very high SFRs or quasi-stellar objects QSOs containing pow-
erful AGNs Only a few galaxies on the main sequence of star formation MS eg Wuyts
et al 2011 have been observed in CO These are typically massive 1010  1011 Mcid12 galaxies
selected by the BzK technique to be moderately star-forming with SFRcid39 10  500 Mcid12 yr1
ie specic SFR SSFR of around 05 Gyr1 The molecular gas of SMGs and QSOs is highly
excited with peak uxes at the CO5-4 and CO6-5 transitions which is evidence of dense and
possibly warm gas Papadopoulos et al 2012 but little is known for the normal star-forming
galaxies observed in CO to date The only such galaxies with 4 observed CO transitions are
the BzK-selected galaxies BzK4171 BzK16000 and BzK21000 Daddi et al 2014 These
galaxies were previously believed to contain mainly gas reminiscent to that of the Milky Way
MW Dannerbauer et al 2009 Aravena et al 2014 but new CO54 observations by Daddi
et al 2014 require a second component of higher density and possibly higher temperature
With instruments of high spatial resolution it has recently become possible to resolve galax-
ies at z cid38 2 on kiloparsec scales as shown with the VLA by eg Walter et al 2007 when ob-
serving low-J CO transitions Scales of 1 kpc require a resolution of  01 at z  2 achievable
with ALMA for higher CO lines that are not redshifted below its bands
When measuring the CO ladder of galaxies with different compositions SFR and AGN
activity a huge variety emerges Fig 32 compares the rather low-excitation ladder of the MW
to the CO ladders of SMGs and QSOs which peak at increasingly higher J-values An upper
limit as to how steep the ladder can be is reached if the gas is in Local Thermal Equilibrium
LTE in which case the level populations just follow a Boltzmann distribution set by the gas
kinetic temperature and no radiative transitions are considered For gas in LTE and of kinetic
temperature above that of the upper level transition level the CO ladder would grow as J 2 as
indicated in Fig 32 in blue But in general this upper limit is not reached by the local kinetic
temperature and the high J-levels are less populated
321 THE XCO FACTOR
Probably the widest use of CO emission lines is the estimation of total molecular gas mass The
low critical density  300 cm3 of the rst CO1-0 transition makes it a tracer of most gas in
a GMC In order to convert from CO1-0 line intensity and column density of H2 the CO-H2
conversion factor XCO or X-factor gives the H2 column density per CO1-0 intensity unit
XCO cm2K km s11  NH2WCO10
A similar conversion factor exists between total H2 gas mass amount and CO line luminosity
CO Mcid12K km pc
21  MH2LCO10
Figure 32 Observed CO ladders for different galaxies normalized to the CO1-0 transition From the review of
Casey et al 2014
The most common way of inferring their values is to estimate the gas mass from either i
the CO line width assuming the GMCs are in virial equilibrium cf eq 12 ii the dust mass
assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio or iii -ray emission from cosmic ray interactions with
H2 see references in Narayanan et al 2012 In the inner disk of the MW they are relatively
constant at XCO  2  1020 cm2K km s11 and CO  43 Mcid12K km pc21 from the
comprehensive review on the X-factor by Bolatto et al 2013
But recent observations at low and high redshift show that XCO must be lower in galaxies
of high-surface density environments and larger in low-metallicity environments This has
led to the belief that maybe there exists two versions of the KS star formation relation one for
gas-rich mergers and another for star-forming normal disk galaxies Genzel et al 2010 Based
on detailed modeling Narayanan et al 2012 came up with a function for XCO that depends
on CO line luminosity and metallicity With this prescription for XCO a single continous KS
star formation relation can be drawn for starbursts and normal disk galaxies at low and high
redshift as shown in Fig 33 However see the work of Hodge et al 2015 implying that
SMGs really can have more efcient star formation on small scales regardless of the choice of
conversion factor
33 MODELING OF CO EMISSION LINES
The CO ladder of a galaxy can be modeled by combining galaxy simulations either zoom-in
versions of cosmological simulations or isolated galaxy models cf Section 16 with sub-grid
prescriptions for the GMC structure and radiative transfer codes or LVG models for the trans-
port of CO line emission through the ISM Over the past decade in particular detailed modeling
of CO emission has been developed the basic spdf of which can be summarised as follows 1
Simulate a galaxy with dark matter stars and atomic gas if possible with a multiphase molec-

ular gas 2 Apply semi-analytical physical recipes to estimate the amount and state of dust
and molecular gas 3 Calculate the radiative transfer of selected CO lines A full description
of such a process can be found in Narayanan et al 2008b who investigated the signatures
in CO morphology and line prole of outows created by active galactic nuclei AGNs and
starbursts The same method has been used to study other aspects of the ISM such as the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and the XCO factor which relates velocity-integrated CO line in-
tensity to H2 column density in low- and high-redshift galaxies eg Narayanan et al 2011
Narayanan  Hopkins 2013 By running smoothed particle hydrodynamical SPH simula-
tions with the GADGET-3 code Narayanan et al 2011 were able to follow the evolution with
time of a multiphase ISM in isolated disk galaxies undergoing a merger allowing the gas to cool
down to temperatures of  10 K Lagos et al 2012 simulated the CO emission of quiescently
star-forming as well as starburst galaxies at redshifts ranging from z  0 to z  6 by coupling
cosmological galaxy formation simulations with the tabulated output of a code describing pho-
ton dominated regions PDRs Lagos et al 2012 found that the global velocity-integrated CO
line intensity peaks at higher rotational transitions with increasing infrared IR luminosity J-
level 4 to 5 when median LIR of the sample goes from about 13  109 to 8  1012 Lcid12 In a
similar study Popping et al 2014 found that models of normal star-forming galaxies at high
redshift have much higher rotational transitions than their local counterparts Finally the mod-
eling of CO lines from a large set of simulated disk galaxies recently carried out by Narayanan
 Krumholz 2014 showed that the CO line energy distribution can be parameterised better
with respect to SFR surface density compared to total SFR Simulated CO SLEDs in in Fig 34
provide examples of these previous works However simulations of resolved CO line emission
have been lacking
SIMULATING CO LINE EMISSION FROM
MASSIVE STAR-FORMING GALAXIES AT
z  2 PAPER I
41 AIM OF THIS PROJECT
We1 wanted to expand on previous modeling done by other groups of CO emission lines from
galaxies at high redshift by developing a method that focuses on radial gradients of the XCO
factor and CO line ratios This would provide a preview for what instruments might one day
observe in normal star-forming galaxies at z  2
With this project we present a new numerical framework for simulating the line emission
of normal star-forming galaxies The code  SImulator of GAlaxy Millimetersubmillimeter
Emission SGAME2  combines non-cosmological SPH or grid-based simulations of galaxy
formation with subgrid prescriptions for the H2HI fraction and thermal balance throughout
the ISM down to parsec scales SGAME accounts for a FUV and cosmic ray intensity eld that
vary with local SFR density within the galaxy SGAME can be applied to any galaxy simulated
in the SPH formalism though currently restricted to galaxies dominated by star formation
processes rather than AGN and with mean metallicities above about 001Zcid12 Here we adapt
the code to cosmological SPH simulations of three massive normal star-forming galaxies at
z  2 ie so-called main-sequence galaxies and model their CO rotational line spectrum
using a publically available 3D radiative transfer code We show that SGAME reproduces
observed low-J CO line luminosities and provides new estimates of the XCO factor for main-
sequence galaxies at z  2 while at the same time predicting their CO line luminosities at
high-J Jup  6 transitions where observations are yet to be made
The structure of this chapter is as follows Section 42 describes the cosmological SPH sim-
ulations used along with the basic properties of the three star-forming galaxies extracted from
the simulations A detailed description of SGAME is presented in Section 43 The CO emission
maps and spectra obtained after applying SGAME to the three simulated galaxies are presented
in Section 44 where we also compare to actual CO observations of similar galaxies at z  2

2SGAME in Spanish translates as follow me - which in this context refers to the pursue of line emission through a
drew Zirm
galaxy
Section 46 discusses the strengths and weaknesses of SGAME in the context of other molecu-
lar line CO simulations and recent observations Finally in Section 47 I summarise the main
spdf of SGAME and list its main ndings and predictions regarding the CO line emission from
massive star-forming galaxies at z cid39 2 We adopt a at cold dark matter CDM scenario with
m  03   07 and h  065
42 COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS
421 SPH SIMULATIONS
We employ a cosmological TreeSPH code for simulating galaxy formation and evolution though
in principle grid-based hydrodynamic simulations could be incorporated equally well The
TreeSPH code used for the simulations is in most respects similar to the one described in
Sommer-Larsen et al 2005 and Romeo et al 2006 A cosmic baryon fraction of fb  015
is assumed and simulations are initiated at a redshift of z  39 The implementation of star
formation and stellar feedback however has been manifestly changed
Star formation is assumed to take place in cold gas Tk cid46 104 K at densities nH  1 cm3
The star formation efciency or probability that a gas particle will form stars is formally set
to 01 but is due to effects of self-regulation considerably lower Star formation takes place in
a stochastic way and in a star formation event 1 SPH gas particle is converted completely into
1 stellar SPH particle representing the instantaneous birth of a population of stars according
to a Chabrier 2003 stellar initial mass function IMF Chabrier 2003  see further below
The implementation of stellar feedback is based on a subgrid super-wind model somewhat
similar to the high-feedback models by Stinson et al 2006 These models though build on
a supernova blast-wave approach rather than super-wind models Both types of models in-
voke a Chabrier 2003 IMF which is somewhat more top-heavy in terms of energy and heavy-
element feedback than eg the standard Salpeter IMF The present models result in galaxies
characterized by reasonable z  0 cold gas fractions abundances and circum-galactic medium
abundance properties They also improve considerably on the angular momentum problem
relative to the models presented in eg Sommer-Larsen et al 2003 The models will be de-
scribed in detail in a forthcoming paper Sommer-Larsen et al 2015 in prep
422 THE MODEL GALAXIES
Three model galaxies hereafter referred to as G1 G2 and G3 in order of increasing SFR were
extracted from the above SPH simulation and re-simulated using the zoom-in technique de-
scribed in eg Sommer-Larsen et al 2003 The emphasis in this study is on massive M cid38
5  1010 Mcid12 galaxies and the three galaxies analyzed are therefore larger rescaled versions of
galaxies formed in the 10h Mpc cosmological simulation described in Sommer-Larsen et al
2003 The linear scale-factor is of the order 15 and since the CDM power spectrum is fairly
constant over this limited mass range the rescaling is a reasonable approximation
Galaxy G1 was simulated at fairly high resolution using a total of 12  106 SPH and dark
matter particles while about 9  105 and 11  106 particles were used in the simulations of G2
and G3 respectively For the G1 simulation the masses of individual SPH gas stellar and dark
matter particles are mSPH  m  63  105 h1Mcid12 and mDM35  106 h1Mcid12 respectively
Gravitational cubic spline softening lengths of 310 310 and 560 h1pc respectively were
employed Minimum gas smoothing lengths were about 50 h1pc For the lower resolution
Figure 41 SPH gas surface density maps of the three model galaxies G1 top G2 middle
and G3 bottom viewed face-on The stellar masses and SFRs of each galaxy are indicated see
also Table 41 The maps have been rendered with the visualization tool SPLASH version 240
Price 2007 using the gas smoothing lengths provided by the simulations
simulations of galaxies G2 and G3 the corresponding particle masses are mSPH  m  47 
106 h1Mcid12 and mDM  26  107 h1Mcid12 respectively and the gravitational softening lengths
were 610 610 and 1090 h1pc Minimum gas smoothing lengths were about 100 h1pc
Due to effects of gravitational softening typical velocities in the innermost parts of the
galaxies typically at radii less than about 2pdf ilonSPH where pdf ilonSPH is the SPH and

Notes All quantities are determined within a radius Rcut which is the radius where the cumulative radial stellar
mass function of each galaxy becomes at The gas mass MSPH is the total SPH gas mass within Rcut The
metallicity Zcid48  ZZcid12 is the mean of all SPH gas particles within Rcut
Sommer-Larsen et al 1998 The dynamical velocities will be of the order vdyn cid112GM RR
star particle gravitational softening length are somewhat below dynamical values see eg
where G is the gravitational constant R is the radial distance from the centre of the galaxy and
M R is the total mass located inside of R Indeed it turns out that for the simulated galaxies
considered here SPH particle velocities inside of 2pdf ilonSPH are only about 60-70 of what
should be expected from dynamics To coarsely correct for this adverse numerical effect for
SPH particles inside of 2pdf ilonSPH the velocities are corrected as follows For SPH particles of
total velocity less than vdyn the tangential component of the velocity is increased such that the
total velocity becomes equal to vdyn Only the tangential component is increased in order not
to create spurious signatures of merging With this correction implemented the average ratio
of total space velocity to dynamical velocity of all SPH particles inside of 2pdf ilonSPH equals
Figure 41 shows surface density maps of the SPH gas in G1 G2 and G3 ie prior to any
post-processing by SGAME The gas is seen to be strongly concentrated towards the centre of
each galaxy and structured in spiral arms containing clumps of denser gas The spiral arms
reach out to a radius of about 20 kpc in G1 and G3 with G2 showing a more compact structure
that does not exceed R  15 kpc Table 41 lists key properties of these galaxies namely SFR
stellar mass M SPH gas mass MSPH SPH gas mass fraction fSPH  MSPHM  MSPH
and metallicity Zcid48 These quantities were measured within a radius Rcut also given in Ta-
ble 41 corresponding to where the radial cumulative stellar mass function has attened out
The metallicity is in units of solar metallicity and is calculated from the abundances of C N O
Mg Si S Ca and Fe in the SPH simulations and adjusted for the fact that not all heavy metals
have been included according to the solar element abundancies measured by Asplund et al
2009
The location of our three model galaxies in the SFR-M diagram is shown in Figure 42
along with a sample of 3754 14  z  25 main-sequence galaxies selected in near-IR from the
NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey Whitaker et al 2011 The latter used a Kroupa IMF but
given its similarity with a Chabrier IMF no conversion in the stellar mass and SFR was made
cf Papovich et al 2011 and Zahid et al 2012 who use conversion factors of 106 and 113
respectively Also shown are recent determinations of the main-sequence relation at z  1
Daddi et al 2007 Elbaz et al 2007 Rodighiero et al 2010 When comparing to the relation
at z  2 of Daddi et al 2007 G1 G2 and G3 are seen to lie at the massive end of the sequence
albeit somewhat on its lower ie passive side This latter tendency is also found among
a subset of CO-detected BXBM galaxies at z  2  25 Tacconi et al 2013 highlighted in
Figure 42 along with a handful of z  15 BzK galaxies also detected in CO Daddi et al 2010
The BXBM galaxies are selected by a UGR colour criteria Adelberger et al 2004 while the
BzK galaxies are selected by the BzK colour criteria Daddi et al 2004 Based on the above we
conclude that in terms of stellar mass and SFR our three model galaxies are representative of
the star-forming galaxy population detected in CO at z  2

43 MODELING THE ISM WITH SGAME
431 METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW
What follows in this section is an overview of the major spdf that go into SGAME along with
a brief description of each The full details of each step are given in subsequent sections and in
appendices A1 through A3 We stress that SGAME operates entirely in the post-processing
stage of an SPH simulation and can in principle easily be adapted to any given SPH galaxy
simulation as long as certain basic quantities are known for each SPH particle in the simula-
tion namely position cid126r velocity cid126v atomic hydrogen density nH metallicity Zcid48 kinetic
temperature Tk smoothing length h and star formation rate SFR The key spdf involved
in SGAME are
1 Cooling of the SPH gas The initially hot Tk  1037 K SPH gas particles are cooled to
temperatures typical of the warm neutral medium cid46 104 K by atomic and ionic cooling
lines primarily
2 Inference of the molecular gas mass fraction fcid48
mol  mH2mSPH of each SPH particle
after the initial cooling in step 1 fcid48
mol for a given SPH particle is calculated by taking
into account its temperature metallicity and the local cosmic ray and FUV radiation eld
impinging on it
3 Distribution of the molecular gas into GMCs Cloud masses and sizes are obtained from
random sampling of the observed GMC mass-spectrum in nearby quiescent galaxies and
applying the local GMC mass-size relation
4 GMC thermal structure A radial density prole is adopted for each GMC and used to
calculate the temperature structure throughout individual clouds taking into account
heating and cooling mechanisms relevant for neutral and molecular gas when exposed
to the local cosmic ray and attenuated FUV elds
5 Radiative transport of CO lines Finally the CO line spectra are calculated separately for
each GMC with a radiative transfer code and accumulated on a common velocity axis for
the entire galaxy
Determining the temperature step i and the molecular gas mass fraction step ii of a warm
neutral gas SPH particle cannot be done independently of each other but must be solved for
simultaneously in an iterative fashion see Sections 432 and 433 As already mentioned we
shall apply SGAME to the SPH simulations of galaxies G1 G2 and G3 described in Section 42
and in doing so we will use them to illustrate the workings of the code
432 THE WARM AND COLD NEUTRAL MEDIUM
In SPH simulations of galaxies the gas is typically not cooled to temperatures below a few
thousand Kelvin Springel  Hernquist 2003 This is illustrated in Figure 43 which shows
the SPH gas temperature distribution dashed histogram in G1 for clarity we have not shown
the corresponding temperature distributions for G2 and G3 both of which are similar to that
of G1 Minimum SPH gas temperatures in G1 G2 and G3 are about 1200 K 3100 K and 3200 K
respectively and while temperatures span the range  1037 K the bulk  80  90 of the
gas mass in all three galaxies is at Tk cid46 105 K
At such temperatures all gas will be in atomic or ionised form and H atoms that attach to
grain surfaces via chemical bonds chemisorbed will evaporate from dust grains before H2 can
be formed H2 can effectively only exist at temperatures below  103 K assuming a realistic
desorption energy of 3  104 K for chemisorbed H atoms see Cazaux  Spaans 2004 The
rst step of SGAME is therefore to cool some portion of the hot SPH gas down to Tk cid46 103 K
ie a temperature range characteristic of a warm and cold neutral medium for which we can
meaningfully employ a prescription for the formation of H2
SGAME employs the standard cooling and heating mechanisms pertaining to a hot par-
tially ionised gas Cooling occurs primarily via emission lines from H He C O N Ne Mg Si
S Ca and Fe in their atomic and ionised states with the relative importance of these radiative
cooling lines depending on the temperature Wiersma et al 2009 In addition to these emis-
sion lines electron recombination with ions can cool the gas as recombining electrons take
away kinetic energy from the plasma a process which is important at temperatures  103 K
Wolre et al 2003 At similar high temperatures another important cooling mechanism is
the scattering of free electrons off other free ions whereby free-free emission removes energy
from the gas Draine 2011 Working against the cooling is heating caused by cosmic rays via
the expulsion of bound electrons from atoms or the direct kinetic transfer to free electrons via
Coulomb interactions Simnett  McDonald 1969 Since this cooling step is targeted towards
the hot ionised gas we shall ignore photo-ionization as a heating process but include it in the
subsequent temperature calculations see Section 434
We arrive at a rst estimate of the temperature of the neutral medium by requiring energy
rate equilibrium between the above mentioned heating and cooling mechanisms

the cooling rates from recombination processes and free-free emission as described above and
CRHI is the cosmic ray heating rate in atomic partly ionised gas The detailed analytical
expressions employed by SGAME for these heating and cooling rates are given in appendix
The abundances of the atoms and ions listed above entering the ionsatoms cooling term
either have to be calculated in a self-consistent manner as part of the SPH simulation or set by
hand For our set of galaxies the SPH simulations follow the abundances of H C N O Mg Si
S Ca and Fe while for the abundances of He and Ne we adopt solar mass fractions of 02806
and 104 respectively as used in Wiersma et al 2009
CRHI depends on the primary cosmic ray ionization rate CR a quantity that is set by the
number density of supernovae since they are thought to be the main source of CRs Ackermann
et al 2013 In SGAME this is accounted for by parameterizing CR as a function of the local
star formation rate density SFRD as it varies across the simulated galaxy The details of this
parameterization are deferred to Section 434
It is important to emphasize that the ionization fraction of the gas depends on the total
cosmic ray ionization rate ie CR corrected for secondary ionizations of H and He the gas
temperature Tk and H I density nHI with a procedure kindly provided by I Pelupessy see
also Pelupessy 2005 and these quantities are interdependent The mayor drawback of this
method is that it does not depend on the free electrons from ionization of carbon which renders
the method less suitable for the CNM compared to the WNM In the following application of
Figure 43 The distributions of gas kinetic temperature before dashed histogram and after solid histogram apply-
ing the heating and cooling mechanisms of eq 41 to galaxy G1 The original hot SPH gas is seen to span a temperature
range from about 103 K up to  107 K while once the gas has been cooled the temperature distribution only barely
exceeds  104 K
SGAME we changed this method to rely on results with the chemical evolution code CLOUDY
see Chapter 5 Returning to eq 41 all terms depend on Tk nHI and the electron density ne
for a xed CR see appendix A1 The latter is calculated taking into account the ionization of
H and He  and is a function of both Tk and CR Since nHI is set by the molecular gas mass
fraction fcid48
mol is calculated
eq 41 has to be solved in an iterative fashion until consistent values for Tk ne and fcid48
mol are
reached Example solutions are given in Figure A1 in Appendix A1
mol which in turn also depends on Tk see Section 433 on how fcid48
The temperature distribution that results from solving eq 41 for every SPH particle in the
G1 simulation is shown in Figure 43 very similar distributions are obtained for G2 and G3
The gas has been cooled to Tk cid46 104 K with temperatures extending down to 25 30 and 27 K
respectively for G1 G2 and G3 We identify this gas as the warm neutral medium WNM
and the cold neutral medium CNM and it is from this gas phase that we shall construct our
molecular gas phase in the subsequent sections
433 HI TO H2 CONVERSION
For the determination of the molecular gas mass fraction associated with each SPH gas parti-
cle we use the prescription of Pelupessy et al 2006 inferred by equating the formation rate
of H2 on dust grains with the photodissociation rate of H2 by Lyman-Werner band photons
and taking into account the self-shielding capacity of H2 and dust extinction We ignore H2
production in the gas phase cf Christensen et al 2012 since only in diffuse low metallicity
cid46 01Zcid12 gas is this thought to be the dominant formation route Norman  Spaans 1997
and so should not be relevant in our model galaxies that have mean metallicities Zcid48  1 see
Table 41 and very little gas exists at Zcid48  01 see Figure A3 in Appendix A3 We adopt a
steady-state for the H IH2 transition meaning that we ignore any time dependence owing
to temporal changes in the UV eld strength andor disruptions of GMCs both of which can
occur on similar time scales as the H2 formation This has been shown to be a reasonable as-
sumption for environments with metallicities cid38 001 Zcid12 Narayanan et al 2011 Krumholz 
Gnedin 2011
The rst step is to derive the FUV eld strength G0 which sets the H IH2 equilibrium In
SGAME G0 consists of a spatially varying component that scales with the local SFRD SFRDlocal
in different parts of the galaxy on top of a constant component set by the total stellar mass of
the galaxy This is motivated by Seon et al 2011 who measured the average FUV eld strength
in the MW G0 MW and found that about half comes from star light directly with the remain-
der coming from diffuse background light We shall assume that in the MW the direct stellar
contribution to G0 MW is determined by the average SFRD SFRDMW while the diffuse com-
ponent is xed by the stellar mass MMW From this assumption ie by calibrating to MW
values we derive the desired scaling relation for G0 in our simulations

10 kpc of the MW 03 Mcid12 yr1 Heiderman et al 2010 and within a column of height equal to
the scale height of the young stellar disk 02 kpc Bovy et al 2012 of the MW disk SFRDlocal
is the SFRD ascribed to a given SPH particle and is calculated as the volume-averaged SFR of
all SPH particles within a 5 kpc radius the latter chosen in order to resolve the galaxies and
at the same time not going to scales where different stellar populations must be considered
Note that the stellar mass sets a lower limit on G0 which for G1 G2 and G3 are 022 062 and
088 Habing respectively
Next the gas upon which the FUV eld impinges is assumed to reside in logotropic clouds

on the environment eg G0 Zcid48 Tk Pext the fraction of the SPH gas converted into H2 can

Overall the total mass fraction of the SPH gas in G1 G2 and G3 ie within Rcut that is
converted to molecular gas is 29  52  and 34  respectively
434 STRUCTURE OF THE MOLECULAR GAS
Molecular gas is known to clump on scales cid46 100 pc signicantly below the typical resolution
in simulations of galaxy evolution thus posing a general problem when modelling molecular
emission lines Narayanan et al 2011 Popping et al 2014 Narayanan  Krumholz 2014

solid line histogram Similar distributions are found for G2 and G3 The lower limit on fcid48
mol dened as described in
Section 434 is indicated by the dashed vertical line
In relatively undisturbed moderately star-forming galaxies molecular gas is believed to be
distributed in giant molecular clouds GMCs of sizes  6  60 pc with internal substructures
similar to those observed in the MW Kauffmann et al 2010 and as suggested by simulations
eg Vzquez-Semadeni et al 2010 Having determined the molecular gas mass fractions
SGAME proceeds by distributing the molecular gas into GMCs and calculates the masses and
sizes along with the internal density and temperature structure for each GMC as described in
the following
GMC masses and sizes
The molecular gas associated with a given SPH particle is divided into a number of GMCs the
masses of which are assumed to follow a power-law spectrum of the form
 mGMC
For the MW disk and Local Group galaxies  cid39 18 Blitz et al 2007 and this will be our
default choice unless otherwise stated Lower and upper mass cut-offs at 104 Mcid12 and 106 Mcid12
respectively are enforced in order to span the mass range observed by Blitz et al 2007 A
similar approach was adopted by Narayanan et al 2008ba Note in the case of G1 the upper
cut-off on the GMC masses is in fact set by the mass resolution of the SPH simulation 63 
105 h1 Mcid12 For G1 typically cid46 30 GMCs are created in this way per SPH particle while
for G2 and G3 which were run with SPH gas particles masses almost an order of magnitude
higher as much as  100 GMCs can be extracted from a given SPH particle for   18 Figure
Figure 45 The distribution of GMC masses in G1 obtained by applying eq 48 with   18 solid histogram
and   15 dash-dotted histogram to the total molecular gas masses associated with SPH particles distribution
shown as dotted histogram The dashed vertical line indicates the SPH gas mass resolution of the simulation 
63  105 h1 Mcid12 in the case of G1
45 shows the resulting mass distribution of all the GMCs in G1 along with the distribution
of molecular mass associated with the SPH gas particles prior to it being divided into GMCs
The net effect of re-distributing the H2 mass into GMCs is a mass distribution dominated by
relatively low cloud masses which is in contrast to the relatively at SPH H2 mass distribution
Note the lower cut-off at mGMC  104 Mcid12 implies that if the molecular gas mass associated
with an SPH particle ie mmol  fcid48
molmSPH is less than this lower limit it will not be re-
distributed into GMCs Since mSPH is constant in our simulations 63 105 h1 Mcid12 for G1 and
47  106 h1 Mcid12 for G2 and G3 the lower limit imposed on mGMC translates directly into a
lower limit on fcid48
mol 0016 for G1 and 0002 for G2 and G3 shown as a dashed vertical line for
G1 in Figure 44 As a consequence 02 0005 and 001  of the molecular gas in G1 G2 and
G3 respectively does not end up in GMCs These are negligible fractions and the molecular
gas they represent can therefore be safely ignored
The sizes Re of the GMCs are derived via application of the virial theorem by which Re
depends on the GMC mass and the external pressure Pext

see eg Elmegreen 1989 Swinbank et al 2011 Figure 46 shows the resulting distribution
of GMC sizes Re for G1 for the two GMC mass spectra investigated here see beginning of
this Section Upper and lower limits on cloud sizes of  007 pc and  60 pc respectively are
set by the maximum and minimum GMC masses and pressure in G1
Since observations have indicated that the shape of the GMC mass spectrum might be dif-
ferent at high redshift in particular in gas-rich systems harbouring a high-pressure ISM and
massive star-forming clumps of molecular gas eg Swinbank et al 2011 Leroy et al 2015
ized v  
we examined the effects of adopting a different index namely   15 corresponding to virial-
R clouds Padoan  Nordlund 2002 The mass distribution resulting from this
lower value of  is more top-heavy than our adopted spectrum see Figure 45 and as a result
there are more clouds with sizes RGMC cid38 10 pc and fewer clouds at smaller radii Figure 46
Yet the total amount of molecular gas in our galaxies does not change signicantly between
  18 and   15 and we therefore conclude that our simulation results are robust against
reasonable changes in the mass-spectrum
As the nal step the GMCs are placed randomly around the position of their parent SPH
particle albeit with an inverse proportionality between radial displacement and mass of the
GMC The latter is done in order to retain the mass distribution of the original galaxy simula-
tion as best as possible The GMCs are assigned the same bulk velocity v Zcid48 G0 and CR as
their parent SPH particle

is Rcloud  59 pc eq 49 The vertical dotted line marks the Plummer radius  01RGMC and the horizontal
dotted line the nH2 value 50 cm3 below which CO is assumed to photo-dissociate in our simulations
GMC density structure
In order to ensure a nite central density in our GMCs SGAME adopts a Plummer radial
density prole eg Gieles et al 2006 Miettinen et al 2009
cid18
cid1952
nH2 Rcm3  2023
3mGMCMcid12
4136Rp pc3
where Rp is the so-called Plummer radius which we set to Rp  01Re The latter allows
for a broad range in gas densities throughout the clouds from  106 cm3 in the central parts
to a few 10 cm3 further out The factor 136 in the denominator accounts for the presence of
helium in the GMC We test the effects of a steeper GMC density prole on our nal results
by adopting an exponent of 72 in eq 411 and re-running our simulations Plummer proles
with exponents 52 and 72 are shown in Figure 47 for a GMC with mass of 104 Mcid12 and
external pressure 104 K cm3
GMC thermal structure
Having established the masses sizes and density structure of the GMCs SGAME next solves
for the kinetic temperature throughout the clouds This means balancing the relevant heating
and cooling mechanisms as a function of cloud radius
GMCs are predominantly heated by FUV photons via the photo-electric effect and cosmic
rays For the strength of the FUV eld impinging on the GMCs we take the previously cal-
culated values at the SPH gas particle position eq 42 We shall assume that the cosmic ray
ionization rate scales in a similar manner having its origin in supernovae and therefore also
being closely related to nearby star formation and the total stellar mass of the galaxy

CR  CRMW
SFRDlocal
MMW
where SFRDlocal SFRDMW and MMW are as described in Section 433 and CR is scaled to the
canonical MW value of CR MW  3 1017 s1 eg Webber 1998 While the FUV radiation
is attenuated by dust and therefore does not heat the GMC centres signicantly cosmic rays
can penetrate these dense regions and heat the gas there Papadopoulos et al 2011 For this
reason we will attenuate the FUV eld but not the cosmic ray eld assuming that the latter
kpdf the same intensity throughout the GMCs The extinction of the FUV eld at a certain
point within a GMC is derived by integrating the Plummer density prole from that point and
out to the cloud surface which is taken to be Re This H column density is converted into a
visual extinction AV  NH22  1021 cm2 so that attenuated FUV eld becomes
G0att  G0e18AV 
where the factor of 18 is the adopted conversion from visual to FUV extinction Black  Dal-
garno 1977 We calculate the temperature throughout each GMC via the following heating
and cooling rate balance
PE  CRH2  H2  CO  OI  CII  gasdust
PE is the photo-electric heating by FUV photons and CRH2 is the cosmic ray heating in
molecular gas H2 is the cooling rate of the two lowest H2 rotational lines S0 and S1
and CO is the cooling rate of the combined CO rotational ladder gasdust is the cooling rate
due to interactions between gas molecules and dust particles which only becomes important
at densities above 104 cm3 eg Goldsmith 2001 Glover  Clark 2012 CII and OI are the
cooling rates due to CII  and OI  line emission respectively the strongest cooling lines in
neutral ISM The abundances of carbon and oxygen used in the prescriptions for their cooling
rates scale with the cloud metallicity while the CO cooling scales with the relative CO to
neutral carbon abundance ratio set by the molecular density see Appendix A2
The dust temperature Tdust used for gasdust in eq 414 is set by the equilibrium between
absorption of FUV and the emission of IR radiation by the dust grains We adopt the approxi-
mation given by Tielens 2005
cid18 a
cid1902cid18 G0att
cid1902
cid39 335
104 Habing
where G0att is the dust-attenuated FUV eld eq 413 and a is the grain size which we set
to 1 m for simplicity Values for Tdust using eq 415 range from 0 to 89 K but we enforce a
lower limit on Tdust equal to the z  2 CMB temperature of 8175 K Tdust is therefore essentially
constant  8  9 K throughout the inner region of the GMC models similar to the value of
Tdust  8 K adopted by Papadopoulos  Thi 2013 for CR-dominated cores However due to a
re-radiated IR component Tdust can easily be  50 K even when the FUV eld is extinguished
due to high optical depth see Krumholz 2014 Analytical expressions for all of the above
heating and cooling rates are given in Appendix A2 which also shows their relative strengths
as a function of density for two example GMCs Figure A2
Figure A4 in Appendix A3 shows the resulting Tk versus nH2 behaviour for 80 GMCs
spanning a broad range of GMC masses metallicities and star formation rate densities As
seen in the displayed GMC models some general trends can be inferred from the Tk  nH2
diagrams At xed metallicity and mass an increase in FUV radiation eld G0 and therefore
also CR ionization rate CR leads to higher temperatures throughout the models In the outer
regions this is due primarily to the increased photoelectric heating while in the inner regions
heating by the unattenuated cosmic rays takes over as the dominating heating mechanism
Figure A2 Keeping G0 and CR xed lower Tk-levels and shallower Tk  nH2 gradients are
found in GMCs with higher metallicities Zcid48 Both these trends are explained by the fact that
the CII  and OI  cooling rates scale linearly with Zcid48 see Appendix A2
Moving from the outskirts and inward towards the GMC centres ie towards higher den-
sities Tk drops as the attenuation of G0 reduces the photoelectric heating However the tran-
sition from the cooling by CII  to the less efcient cooling mechanism by CO lines causes
a local increase in Tk at nH2  103  1045 cm3 as also seen in the detailed GMC simulations
by Glover  Clark 2012 The exact density at which this bump in Tk depends strongly on
the mass of the GMC which is an effect of the chosen mass distribution within the GMCs Our
choice of the Plummer model for the radial density prole means that the extinction AV at
a certain density increases with GMC mass This in turn decreases the FUV heating and as a
result the Tk  nH2 curve moves to lower densities with increasing GMC mass
As the density increases towards the cloud centres ie nH2
cid38 1045 cm3 molecular line
cooling and also gas-dust interactions become increasingly efcient and start to dominate the
cooling budget The Tk  nH2 curves are seen to be insensitive to changes in Zcid48 which is
expected since the dominant heating and cooling mechanisms in these regions do not depend
on Zcid48 Eventually in the very central regions of the clouds the gas reaches temperatures close
to that of the ambient CMB radiation eld irrespective of the overall GMC properties and the
conditions at the surface Figure A2
GMC grid models
The Tk  nH2 curve for a given GMC is determined by the following basic quantities
 The FUV radiation G0 and with that the cosmic ray eld strength CR proportional to
G0 together governing the heating of the gas
 The GMC mass mGMC which together with Pext determines the effective radius of a
cloud eq 49 and thus its density prole eq 411
 The local metallicity Zcid48 which inuences the fraction of H2 gas and plays an important
role in cooling the gas
 The external pressure Pext which determines the mGMC-Re and v-Re relations
Of these G0 and CR are set by the local star formation rate density SFRDlocal and the
total stellar mass M according to eqs 42 and 412 Zcid48 is is taken directly from the simulations
while mGMC is extracted randomly from a probability distribution as explained in Section 434
The distributions of mGMC Zcid48 G0 CR and PextkB for each of the galaxies G1 G2 and G3 are
shown in Figure A3

There are more than 100 000 GMCs in a single model galaxy and as Figure A3 shows they
span a wide range in G0 mGMC Zcid48 and PextkB Thus in order to shorten the computing time
we calculated nH2 and Tk proles for a set of 630 GMCs chosen to appropriately sample the
distributions in G0 mGMC and Zcid48 at certain grid values listed in Table 42 and marked by ver-
tical black lines in Figure A3 Our default for PextkB will be a MW-like value of 104 K cm3
but we also constructed the above grid for PextkB  1055 K cm3 and 1065 K cm3 In addi-
tion we test the two radial GMC density proles dened in Section 434 Tk  nH2 curves were
calculated for each possible combination of the parameter grid values listed in Table 42 giving
us a total of 3  2  630  3780 GMC grid models Every GMC in our simulations was subse-
quently assigned the Tk  nH2 curve of the GMC grid model closest to it in our G0 mGMC Zcid48
parameter space
435 RADIATIVE TRANSFER OF CO LINES
SGAME assumes the density of CO follows that of the H2 gas with a xed CO abundance equal
to the Galactic value of COH2  2  104 Lee et al 1996 Soa et al 2004 and see Section
46 for a justication of this value everywhere in the GMCs except for nH2  50 cm3 where
CO is no expected to survive photo-dissociation processes eg Narayanan et al 2008a This
was chosen for simplicity as a cut in Av would be more physical but we have left this exercise
for a future study Now we are ready to solve the radiative transfer for each GMC individually
and derive the emerging CO line emission from the entire galaxy
Individual GMCs
For the CO radiative transfer calculations we use a slightly modied version of the LIne Mod-
eling Engine LIME ver 14 Brinch  Hogerheijde 2010 - a 3D molecular excitation and ra-
diative transfer code LIME has been modied in order to take into account the redshift de-
pendence of the CMB temperature which is used as boundary condition for the radiation eld
during photon transport and we have also introduced a redshift correction in the calculation
of physical sizes as a function of distance We use collision rates for CO assuming H2 as the
main collision partner from Yang et al 2010 In LIME photons are propagated along grid
lines dened by Delaunay triangulation around a set of appropriately chosen sample points in
the gas each of which contain information on nH2 Tk v COH2 and v SGAME constructs
such a set of sample points throughout each GMC about 5000 points distributed randomly out
to a radius of 40 pc ie beyond the effective radius of all GMCs in G1 G2 and G3 Figure 46
and in a density regime below the threshold density of 50 cm3 adopted for CO survival see
previous paragraph The concentration of sample points is set to increase towards the centre
of each GMC where the density and temperature vary more drastically
For each GMC LIME generates a CO line data cube ie a series of CO intensity maps as a
function of velocity The velocity-axis consists of 50 channels each with a spectral resolution of
10 km s1 thus covering the velocity range v  25 25 km s1 The maps are 100 pc on a
side and split into 200 pixels corresponding to a linear resolution of 05 pcpixel or an angular
resolution of 59  105 pixel at z  2 Intensities are corrected for arrival time delay and
redshifting of photons
Figure A5 shows the area- and velocity-integrated CO Spectral Line Energy Distributions
SLEDs for the same 80 GMCs used in Section 434 to highlight the Tk nH2 proles Figure
A4 The rst thing to note is that the CO line uxes increase with mGMC which is due to the
increase in size ie surface area of the emitting gas with cloud mass Section 434 Turning
to the shape of the CO SLEDs a stronger G0 and CR increases the gas temperature and thus
drives the SLEDs to peak at higher J-transitions Only the higher Jup  4 transitions are also
affected by metallicity displaying increased ux with increased Zcid48 for Zcid48 cid38 1 and G0 cid38 1 For
GMCs with high G0 the high metallicity levels thus cause the CO SLED to peak at Jup  8
The effects of dust
Dust absorbs the UV light from young O and B stars and re-emits in the far-IR leading to pos-
sible IR pumping of molecular infrared sources However due to the large vibrational level
spacing of CO the molecular gas has to be at a temperature of at least 159 K for signicant
IR pumping of the CO rotational lines to take place when assuming a maximum lling fac-
tor of 1 as shown by Carroll  Goldsmith 1981 Most of the gas in our GMC models is at
temperatures below 100 K with only a small fraction of the gas in the very outskirts of the
GMCs reach Tk  159 K as seen in Figure A4 in Appendix A3 This happens only if the
metallicity is low Zcid48  01 or in case of a combination between high FUV eld G0  4 and
moderate metallicity On the other hand the CO emission lines could be subject to dust extinc-
tion which is however only important in extremely dust-enshrouded sources such as Arp 220
Papadopoulos et al 2010 and therefore not signicant for our set of normal galaxies
Upon these reections we have chosen not to include dust in the radiative transfer cal-
culations of each GMC although we mention that LIME is fully capable of including a dust
component provided that a table of dust opacities as function of wavelength be supplied to-
gether with the input model
436 COMBINING THE GMC LINE PROFILES IN A GALAXY
The CO emission line prole is derived for each galaxy GMC by assigning to it the GMC
model that corresponds to the nearest grid point in log space for mGMC and Zcid48 The total
line proles of the galaxies are derived by adding the line proles of individual GMCs to a
common velocity axis at their respective projected velocities within each galaxy This assumes
that the molecular line emission from each GMC is radiatively decoupled from all other GMCs
which is a reasonable assumption due to the large velocity gradients through the galaxies v
of  200  500 km s1 in our model galaxies and the relatively small internal turbulent line
widths expected for the GMC typically  1  3 km s1 for Galactic GMCs Heyer et al 2009
CO moment 0 maps are constructed by overlaying a grid of 500  500 pixels on each galaxy
and adding the area-integrated CO line proles from all GMCs within each pixel to a common
velocity axis and integrating this line prole in velocity This way we create maps with a xed
width of 20 kpc and a resolution of  80 pc By integrating in area instead of velocity we create
total line proles and by further integrating these line proles in velocity space the CO SLED
for the entire galaxy can be derived All this will be examined in the following section and the
results discussed further in Section 46
44 SIMULATING MASSIVE z  2 MAIN SEQUENCE GALAXIES
In this section we examine the H2 surface density and CO emission maps resulting from apply-
ing SGAME to the three SPH galaxy simulations G1 G2 and G3 Section 42 and we compare
with existing CO observations of main sequence galaxies at z  1  25 As mentioned in pre-
vious sections our default grid will be that corresponding to a Plummer density prole and
a pressure of PextkB  104 cm3 K combined with a GMC mass spectrum of slope   18

441 TOTAL MOLECULAR GAS CONTENT AND H2 SURFACE DENSITY MAPS
The total molecular gas masses of G1 G2 and G3  obtained by summing up the GMC masses
molmSPH
 are 71  109 17  1010 and 21  1010 Mcid12 respectively corresponding to about 34 59 and
45  of the original total SPH gas masses of the galaxies within Rcut  20 kpc4 The global
molecular gas mass fractions ie fmol  MmolM  Mmol are 118 98 and 91  for G1 G2
and G3 respectively
For the high-redshift samples we use for comparison in Figure 410 fmol assumes mean
values of 59  23  for the z  1  13 SFGs of Magnelli et al 2012 57  6  for the z  15
BzKs of Daddi et al 2010 48  14  for the z  1  22 SFGs of Tacconi et al 2013 and
52  20  for the z  2  25 BXBM galaxies of Tacconi et al 2013 The mean for all these
galaxies is  47 or  4 5 times above that of our galaxies In comparison local star-forming
galaxies are relatively gas-poor as shown by Saintonge et al 2011 who estimated molecular
masses for a sample of nearby star-forming galaxies by applying a MW-like CO factor to 119
detections in CO1 0 and to a stack of 103 non-detections Correcting their molecular masses
for the contribution from helium 136 the mean fmol is only  67  45  While our model
galaxies have molecular gas mass fractions about a factor 4  5 below z  1  25 star-forming
galaxies they are within the observed range for the local counterparts The main cause for this
discrepancy between our model galaxies and observations made at z  2 is most likely the
relatively low SPH gas mass fractions to begin with ie fSPH  MSPHM MSPH  926 
restricting fmol to be below these values
The molecular surface density mol maps of G1 G2 and G3 depicting the average mol
within pixels 80 pc  80 pc in size are shown in Figure 48 top panels The pixel size was
chosen in order to avoid resolving the GMCs which have typical sizes of Re  07 30 pc see
Section 434
Some molecular gas is seen to extend out to radii of  10 kpc and beyond but generally the
molecular gas concentrates within the inner regions of each galaxy Thus the distribution of
molecular gas broadly follows the central disk and spiral arms where the SPH surface density
SPH is also the highest Figure 41 The correspondence is far from one-to-one however as
4These global molecular-to-SPH gas mass fractions are calculated as MmolMSPH cid80 mGMCcid80 mSPH where
the sums are over all SPH particles
Figure 48 Top row Molecular surface density maps of our model galaxies seen face-on The maps have been
smoothed using a circular Gaussian with full width at half maximum FWHM of 3 pixels corresponding to 024 kpc
Comparing to the SPH gas density maps in Figure 41 the molecular gas surface density maps are seen to trace the
same spiral arms and inner disk as well as a few dense clumps further out Bottom row azimuthally averaged radial
proles of the HI HII dashed curve and molecular solid curve gas surface densities of the mean metallicity dotted
curve and of G0 dot-dashed curve  determined from 50 radial bins stretching from 0 to 15 kpc from the centre of
each galaxy The molecular gas is the result of applying the recipes in Section 433 to the SPH simulations presented
in Section 422 while the HI HII gas is the initial SPH gas mass minus the derived molecular gas mass including a
contribution from heavier elements We estimate G0 by averaging over the FUV elds impinging on all GMCs in each
radial bin
seen by the much larger extent of the SPH gas ie regions where H2 has not formed despite the
presence of atomic and ionized gas This point is further corroborated in the bottom panels of
Figure 48 which show azimuthally-averaged radial surface density proles of the molecular
gas and of the HI HII gas both including a contribution from heavier elements In order to
compare values of HIHIIand mol with observations we set the radial bin width to 05 kpc 
the typical radial bin size used for nearby spirals in the work of Leroy et al 20085 The radially
binned mol reaches  800  1000 Mcid12 pc2 in the central regions of our simulated galaxies
which is comparable to observational estimates of mol of several 100 Mcid12 pc2 towards the
centres of nearby spirals Leroy et al 2008 In all three galaxies the HI HII surface density
dips within the central  1  2 kpc coinciding with a strong peak in mol Thus despite the
marked increase in the FUV radiation eld towards the centre the radial prole of G0 is shown
as dash-dotted line in Figure 48 the formation of H2 driven by the increase in gas pressure
is able to overcome photo-dissociative destruction of H2 by FUV photons The central H2
surface densities are similar for all galaxies and is a direct consequence of very similar SPH
gas surface densities in the centre combined with molecular gas mass fractions approaching
5The H2 surface density maps in Fig 48 are averaged over areas 80  80 pc in size and therefore give higher peak
surface densities than the radial proles which are averaged over  05 kpc wide annuli
1 From R  2 kpc and out to  10 kpc the HI HII surface density remains roughly constant
with values of  40  70 and  100 Mcid12 pc2 for G1 G2 and G3 respectively
Radial proles of the HI and molecular gas surface density that are qualitatively very sim-
ilar to our simulations have been observed in several nearby star-forming disk galaxies eg
Leroy et al 2008 Bigiel et al 2008 In local galaxies however the HI surface density includ-
ing helium rarely exceeds  10 Mcid12 pc2 while in our simulations we nd HI HII surface
densities that are 4  10higher indicating that there is a substantial fraction of ionised gas in
our model galaxies
442 CO LINE EMISSION MAPS AND RESOLVED EXCITATION CONDITIONS
Moment zero maps of the CO10 CO32 and CO76 emission from G1 G2 and G3
are shown in Figure 49 Comparing with the H2 surface density maps in Figure 48 both
the CO10 and CO32 emission are seen to trace the H2 gas distribution well while the
CO76 emission is restricted to the central  7 kpc of the galaxies
Also shown in Figure 49 bottom row are the azimuthally averaged CO 3210 and
7610 brightness temperature line ratios denoted r32 and r76 respectively as a function of
radius for G1 G2 and G3 The proles show that the gas is clearly more excited in the central
 5 kpc where typical values of r32 and r76 are  055  065 and  002  008 respectively
compared to r32  05 and r76  001 further out in the disk This radial behaviour of the line
ratios does not reect the H2 gas surface density which peaks towards the centre rather than
attens and gradually trails off out to R  12 kpc instead of dropping sharply at R  4 6 kpc
Figure 49 Rather r32 and r76 seem to follow closely the behaviour of G0 and thus CR
which makes sense since G0 and CR are the most important factors for the internal GMC
temperature distribution Figure A4 The central values for r32 and r76 increase when going
from G1 to G3 as expected from the elevated levels of star formation density and of G0 and
CR accordingly towards the centre Beyond  6 kpc the line ratios are constant  05 and
 001 and the same for all three galaxies due to relatively similar FUV elds here
At high-z resolved observations of single CO lines are starting to appear eg Genzel et al
2013 Hodge et al 2014 but since resolved excitation studies using multiple lines have so far
not been obtained we instead compare our results to local quiescent and extreme galaxies The
increase in r32 towards the centres are in agreement with observations of nearby galaxies as
those carried out by Dumke 2000 Geach  Papadopoulos 2012 modeled two extreme cases
of gas conditions and found that while r32 might only be  013 in quiescent environments it is
typically  088 in denser gas Mao et al 2010 observed 125 nearby galaxies of different types
and found r32 to be 061  016 in normal galaxies but  089 in starbursts and ULIRGs Iono
et al 2009 and Papadopoulos et al 2012 nds slightly lower r32 in their samples of ULIRGs
with mean values of 048  026 and 067  062 respectively In light of these observations the
r32 radial proles of our model galaxies suggest a denser ULIRG-like environment in the
central R  5 kpc region together with a more quiescent and diffuse gas phase further out in
the disk of z  2 normal star-forming galaxies
Figure 49 The top three rows show the moment zero maps of the CO10 CO32 and CO76 emission from
G1 G2 and G3 The CO maps have been smoothed using a circular Gaussian with full width at half maximum FWHM
of 3 pixels corresponding to 024 kpc and as with the SPH and molecular gas surface density maps a logarithmic scale
has been applied in order to better display extended emission The bottom row shows the azimuthally averaged CO
3210 and 7610 brightness temperature line ratios denoted r32 and r76 respectively as functions of projected
radius for each of the three galaxies A radial bin-size of 05 kpc was used Also shown are the azimuthally averaged

443 THE CO-TO-H2 CONVERSION FACTOR
The CO-to-H2 conversion factor CO connects CO10 line luminosity in surface brightness
temperature units with the molecular gas mass Mmol as follows
Lcid48
CO10
From the CO1  0 surface brightness and H2 surface density maps of our model galaxies we
calculate CO in radial bins surrounding the galaxy centres Figure 49 The resulting radial
CO factors for our model galaxies lie in the range of  3  4 Mcid12 pc2 K km s11 and
show a clear transition from lower CO-values inside the central R  5 kpc to higher values
at R cid38 6 kpc The drop in CO from the disk average to the central value is about a factor
 16  17 similar to the drop in observed CO proles Recently Blanc et al 2013 measured
a drop in CO by a factor of two when going from R  7 kpc to the centre of the Sc galaxy
NGC 628 by using a constant gas depletion timescale in order to convert SFR surface densities
into gas masses Similarly Sandstrom et al 2013 found a drop by a factor of on average  2
from CO averaged across the galaxy disks to CO of the central R  1 kpc in 26 nearby spiral
galaxies by converting inferred dust masses into gas masses
One could expect CO to be correlated with Zcid48 as higher metallicity means higher C and O
abundances as well as more dust that help shielding H2 formation sites from FUV radiation
and thereby increase the amount of CO possibly lowering CO On the other hand although
a higher FUV eld leads to more ionization and photo-dissociation it also increases the gas
temperatures which translates into more excited CO molecules and again a lower CO factor
Comparison of the CO radial proles with those of G0 and Zcid48 in the bottom panel of Figure 48
suggests that the transition in CO is caused by a change in G0 rather than a change in Zcid48 since
CO and G0 generally start to drop at around R  6 kpc while Zcid48 already drops drastically at
1 kpc from the centre Our modeling therefore implies that CO is controlled by G0 rather than
Zcid48 in normal star-forming galaxies at z  2 in agreement with the observations by Sandstrom
et al 2013 who do not nd a strong correlation with Zcid48
From the total molecular gas masses and CO1  0 luminosities of our galaxies we derive
their global CO factors this gives global values of CO  16 15 and 14 Mcid12 pc2 K km s11
for G1 G2 and G3 respectively In Section 45 we investigate the effect on CO of differ-
ent prescriptions for the GMC modeling but for now stick to the default choices as specied
above These values are lower by a factor  3 than the global MW value of COMW cid39 44 
09 Mcid12 pc2 K km s11 calibrated from dynamical dust and -ray studies eg Strong 
Mattox 1996 Dame et al 2001 Pineda et al 2008 but closer to the typical mergersstarburst
CO-values  02  COMW inferred from CO dynamical studies of local ULIRGs eg
Solomon et al 1997 Downes  Solomon 1998 Bryant  Scoville 1999 and z  2 SMGs eg
Tacconi et al 2008 Our CO-values are also below those inferred from dynamical modeling
of z  15 BzKs CO  36  08 Mcid12 pc2 K km s11 Daddi et al 2010
On the other hand the CO factors of the z  1  13 star-forming galaxies studied by
Magnelli et al 2012 occupy the same region of the M SFR plan as our model galaxies but
have CO factors at least a factor  6 higher Their CO are  5  20 Mcid12 pc2 K km s11
when converting dust masses to gas masses using a metallicity-dependent gas-to-dust ratio
and Magnelli et al 2012 further nd that the same galaxies have relatively low dust tempera-
tures of cid46 28 K compared to the galaxies further above the main sequence of Rodighiero et al
2010 The fact that the main-sequence galaxies of Magnelli et al 2012 are all of near-solar
metallicity as ours cf Table 41 suggests that other factors such as dust temperature caused
by strong FUV radition can be more important than metallicity in regulating CO in line with
our study of the CO radial proles

CO observations of normal star-forming galaxies at z  1  3 to date in order to facilitate a
comparison with our simulated CO SLEDs of such galaxies Samples are the same as in Figure
42 but including an additional 7 star-forming galaxies SFGs at z  12 Magnelli et al 2012
and another 39 SFGs at z  1  15 Tacconi et al 2013 The rst sample of galaxies are all
detected in CO21 as well as in HerschelPACS bands and have log M  1036  1131 and
SFR 2974 Mcid12 yr1 The sample from Tacconi et al 2013 comes from the Extended Growth
Strip International Survey EGS is covered by the CANDELS and 3D-HST programs J  H
bands and H respectively and has log M  1040  1123 and SFR 28  630 Mcid12 yr1
First we compare the total CO32 luminosities of our model galaxies with those of the
z  2 25 BXBM galaxies of Tacconi et al 2013 which are not only closest in redshift to our
model galaxies but also occupy the same region of the SFRM plane see Figure 42 We nd
that G2 and G3 the two most massive M  1011 Mcid12 and star-forming SFR cid38 80 Mcid12 yr1
galaxies of our simulations have CO32 luminosities of  07 1 1010 K km s1 pc2 which
is in the range of CO32 luminosities of the BXBM galaxies at an average of  12  09 
1010 K km s1 pc2 The more quiescent G1 is about a factor 4 below the average Lcid48
CO32 of
BXBM galaxies and the offset from the BzK galaxies is even bigger Our G2 and G3 simula-
tions however are able to reproduce the CO luminosities of the z cid39 1  15 SFGs observed by
Magnelli et al 2012 and Tacconi et al 2013 which span a range in CO21 and CO32
luminosities of 36125109 and 14413109 K km s1 pc2 respectively In general the
BzK galaxies are more luminous than our model galaxies with the exception of BzK16000 at
a SFR of 152 Mcid12 yr1 only slightly above our G2 model galaxy 142 Mcid12 yr1 As mentioned
in Section 441 the molecular gas mass fractions of our galaxies is about a factor 6 below the
mean of the observed galaxies at z  1  25 with which we compare and we propose this as
the main reason for the comparatively low CO luminosities
Differences in the global CO excitation conditions between G1 G2 and G3 are best seen
in the CO10 normalized luminosity and intensity ratios ie middle and bottom panel
in Figure 410 The CO SLEDs of all three galaxies follow each other quite closely up to the
J  3  2 transition where the SLEDs all peak at 3  Jup  7 the SLEDs gradually diverge
While the metallicity distributions in G1 G2 and G3 are similar see Figure A3 the rise in G0
presents a likely cause to the increasing high-J ux when going from G1 to G3 as higher G0
leads to more ux primarily in the J  4 transitions see Figure A5
Our simulated galaxies are seen to have CO 2110 3210 and 5410 brightness
temperature ratios of r21 cid39 1 r32 cid39 055 and r54 cid39 015 respectively The rst two ratios

2014 and suggest that our simulations are able to emulate the typical gas excitation conditions
responsible for the excitation of the low-J lines in normal z  1  3 SFGs In contrast r54 
03  04 observed in BzK4171 and BzK21000 Daddi et al 2014 is nearly 2 higher than
our model predictions Daddi et al 2014 argue that this is evidence for a component of denser
and possibly warmer molecular gas not probed by the low-J lines In this picture we would
expect CO43 to probe both the cold low-excitation gas as well as the dense and possibly
warm star-forming gas traced by the CO54 line and we would expect CO65 to be arising
purely from this more highly excited phase and thus departing even further from our models
However signicant scatter in the CO line ratios of main-sequence galaxies is to be ex-
pected as demonstrated by the signicantly lower line ratios observed towards BzK16000
r21 cid39 04 r32 cid39 03 and r54 cid39 01 Aravena et al 2010 Daddi et al 2010 2014 and in fact
the average r54 for all three BzK galaxies above cid39 02 Daddi et al 2014 is consistent with
our models It may be that G2 and G3 and perhaps even G1 are more consistent with the CO
SLEDs of the bulk z  1  3 main-sequence galaxies We stress that to date no z  1  3 main
sequence galaxies have been observed in the J  4  3 nor the 6  5 transitions and observa-
tions of these lines along with low- and high-J lines in many more BzK and main-sequence
z cid39 1  3 galaxies are needed in order to fully delineate the global CO SLEDs in a statistically
robust way
45 TESTING DIFFERENT ISM MODELS
In this section we investigate the effects on our simulation results when adopting i a shallower
GMC mass spectrum slope of   15 ii a steeper GMC density prole ie a Plummer prole
exponent of 72 and iii GMC model grid that includes a the external cloud pressure Pext
as a fourth parameter In order to carry out option iii the GMC model grid was produced
for pressures of PextkB  104 cm3 K default 1055 cm3 K and 1065 cm3 K allowing for a
look-up table of CO SLEDs in G0 mGMC Zcid48 Pext parameter space We examine the effects
that options i-iii have on the global CO SLED of galaxy G2 Figure 411 and how combina-
tions of option i and ii change the values of the global CO-to-H2 conversion factor Table 43
Also we show the impact changes ii and iii have on the CO SLEDs of the individual GMC
grid models in Figures A6 and A7
Changing the GMC mass spectrum from   18 to 15 leaves the CO SLED virtually un-
changed dotted and dot-dashed curves in the top panel of Figure 411 with only a marginal
increase in the line ratio for Jup  4
Adopting the modied Plummer density prole with a power-law exponent of 72 in-
stead of 52 leads to signicantly higher line intensity ratios ie ICOICO10 for Jup  3
see dotted vs dashed curve and dot-dashed vs solid curves in top panel of Figure 411 This
increase in line intensity comes from an increase in central densities as shown in Fig 47 lead-
ing to the excitation of higher J lines
Including external pressures of PextkB  1055 cm3 K and 1065 cm3 K to the GMC model
grid leads to more compact GMCs with decreased velocity dispersions see eqs 49 and 410
both of which act to surpress the CO luminosity at high transitions via increased optical depths
The effect of employing these high pressure grids on the global CO SLED is depicted in the
bottom panel of Figure 411 The most noticable change in the global CO SLEDs is a steeper
decline at high Jup  4 transitions
In Table 43 we compare the global CO factors pertaining to different choices for the GMC
mass spectrum and density prole As evident from Fig A5 higher GMC mass leads to an

increase in CO1  0 luminosity for individual GMC models Using the shallower slope of
  15 for the GMC mass spectrum results in an increase in the fraction of massive GMCs at
the expense of low-mass GMCs This fractional increase in massive GMCs produces a smaller
CO1  0 luminosity contribution than the low-mass GMCs removed and the net effect of
adopting   15 is therefore a reduction in the global CO1  0 luminosity
In terms of
CO changing  from 18 to 15 therefore leads to the sligthly larger CO factors provided
in Table 43 Similarly despite the increasing line ratios at Jup  3 a steeper GMC density
prole decreases the CO1  0 luminosity of our GMC models as evident in Fig A6 thereby
increasing CO In both cases though CO is still keept below the standard MW-value From
the numbers in Table 43 CO for normal star-forming z  2 galaxies is predicted to lie in the
range  14  40 Mcid12 pc2 K km s11 or  03  09 times the MW value
46 COMPARISON WITH OTHER MODELS
SGAME relies on subgrid physics to describe the molecular gas in high-z galaxies eg cloud
masses their density and temperature structure etc It is assumed that the scaling and thermal
balance equations that have been established and calibrated to GMC complexes in our own
Galaxy can be extrapolated to the ISM conditions in high-z galaxies Similarly all other numer-
ical simulations made to date of the molecular gas in galaxies and their CO line emission rely to
smaller or larger degree on subgrid physics eg Narayanan et al 2006 Pelupessy et al 2006
Greve  Sommer-Larsen 2008 Christensen et al 2012 Lagos et al 2012 Muoz  Furlanetto
2013 Narayanan  Krumholz 2014 Lagos et al 2012 Popping et al 2014 In this section we
will highlight and discuss some of the differences in the subgrid physics between SGAME and
other simulations
First however we compare the SGAME CO SLEDs of G1 G2 and G3 with those predicted
by other CO emission simulations of similar main-sequence galaxies A direct comparison
with SGAME can be made in the case of the models presented by Narayanan  Krumholz
2014 where the global CO SLED is parametrised as a function of the SFR surface density
SFR Using the SFR surface densities averaged over the inner 5 kpc of our model galaxies
the corresponding CO SLEDs inferred from the Narayanan  Krumholz 2014 parametrisa-
tion are shown as dash-dotted lines in Figure 410 bottom panel The SLEDs of Narayanan
 Krumholz 2014 all peak at J  4  3 and not 3  2 as our SLEDs and the line ux
ratios are signicantly higher at transitions between J  3  2 and 6  5 While a direct
comparison is not possible we note that Lagos et al 2012 provide CO SLED predictions
for z  2 main-sequence galaxies are in agreement with those of Narayanan  Krumholz
2014 when comparing galaxies of similar infrared luminosities as ours Converting SFRs to

LIRLcid12  SFRMcid12 yr1 1010 see Daddi et al 2010 our simulated galaxies G1 G2 and G3
have LIR of 040 080 and 14  1012 Lcid12 respectively which is in the bottom of the range typi-
cally observed for BzK galaxies LIR from 06 to 40  1012 Lcid12 Daddi et al 2010 For galaxies
with infrared luminosities LIR  101125  1012 Lcid12 corresponding to the range of LIR in our
simulated galaxies Lagos et al 2012 predict CO SLEDs that peak in the CO4  3 transition
that is again implying slightly more excited gas than SGAME does Popping et al 2014 nd
an interesting trend with redshift in their semi-analytical study of MS galaxies at z  0 12 and
2 Galaxies with far-infrared FIR luminosities of log LFIRLcid12  11 12 peak at CO3 2 or
CO4 3 at z  0 but at CO6 5 at z  2 Our galaxies lie in the same FIR luminosity range
log LFIRLcid12  114  119 when converting LIR to LFIR by dividing by 17 Chapman et al
2000 but again SGAME predicts less excited gas when comparing to the z  2 MS galaxies of
Popping et al 2014
 Implementation of G0 and CR
SGAME stands out from most other simulations to date in the way the FUV radiation eld
and the CR ux that impinge on the molecular clouds are modelled and implemented Most
simulations adopt a xed galaxy-wide value of G0 and CR scaled by the total SFR or average
gas surface density across the galaxy eg Lagos et al 2012 Narayanan  Krumholz 2014
SGAME renes this scheme by determining a spatially varying G0 and CR set by the local
SFRD as described in Section 433 By doing so we ensure that the molecular gas in our simu-
lations is calorimetrically coupled to the star formation in their vicinity If we adopt the method
of Narayanan  Krumholz 2014 and calculate a global value for G0 by calibrating to the MW
value using SFRMW  2 Mcid12 yr1 and G0MW  06 Habing our galaxies would have G0 rang-
ing from about 12 to 42 whereas with the SFR surface density scaling of Lagos et al 2012
global G0 values would lie between about 6 and 9 For comparison the locally determined
G0 in our model galaxies spans a larger range from 03 to 27 see Figure A3 Narayanan 
Krumholz 2014 determines the global value of CR as 21017Zcid48s1 corresponding to values
of 37  62  1017s1 in our model galaxies when using the mass-weighted mean of Zcid48 in
each galaxy Typical values adopted in studies of ISM conditions are around 1 2 1017s1
Wolre et al 2010 Glover  Clark 2012 but again the local values of CR in our galaxies
span a larger range from 13  1017 to 13  1015 s1
 The molecular gas mass fraction
In SGAME the molecular gas mass fraction fcid48
mol is calculated following the work by Pelupessy
et al 2006 in which fcid48
mol depends on temperature metallicity local FUV eld and boundary
pressure on the gas cloud in question Other methods exist such as those of Blitz  Rosolowsky
2006 and Krumholz et al 2009 K09 Most recently Narayanan  Krumholz 2014 applied
the K09 model in order to derive the H2 gas mass and we compare this method to that of
Pelupessy et al 2006 P06 used by SGAME in Figure 412 The gas surface density that enters
in the K09 method was estimated within 1 kpc of each SPH particle as used in our calculation
of Pext see Section 433 Both methods produce higher fcid48
mol for increasingly more metal-
rich gas as expected since higher metallicity leads to more dust onto which the H2 molecules
can form As shown in Fig 412 the two methods agree overall albeit with increasing scatter
towards lower metallicity For high metallicity the P06 method tends to give larger values
of fcid48
mol than the K09 method This leads to systematically lower total molecular gas masses
when using the method of K09 instead of P06 In particular the molecular gas mass fractions
fmol  MmolM  Mmol of G1 G2 and G3 decrease from 85 78 and 68  to 98 103 and
95  respectively
A common feature of the above HI H2 prescriptions is that they assume an instanta-
neous HI to H2 conversion once the conditions for H2 formation are met By actually incorpo-
rating their HI H2 subgrid model in an N-bodySPH dwarf galaxy simulation Pelupessy

done in this work abscissa and that of Krumholz et al 2009 ordinate used by eg Narayanan  Krumholz 2014
color-coded by metallicity
et al 2006 nd that typical timescales for H2 cloud formation are of order  107 yr Such
timescales are comparable to a wide variety of processes that can potentially alter or even fully
disrupt typical molecular clouds leading to the conclusion that modeling of the HI H2
transition should be time-dependent in order to embrace such phenomena as clump-clump
collisions and star formation which can drive H2 formation in both directions Relying on the
ndings of Narayanan et al 2011 and Krumholz  Gnedin 2011 the static solution for H2
formation is a valid approximation for Zcid48  001 which is the case for the three model galaxies
studied here but restricts SGAME to the domain of galaxies with at least Zcid48  001
 CO abundance
For the density of CO we assumed that CO follows the structure of H2 gas and adopted a
constant Galactic abundance of COH2  2  104 In reality H2 gas can self-shield better
than the CO gas creating an outer region or envelope of CO-dark gas Bolatto et al 2008
Observations in the MW by Pineda et al 2013 indicate that the amount of dark gas grows with
decreasing metallicity and the resulting absence of CO molecules By modeling a dynamically
evolving ISM with cooling physics and chemistry incorporated on small scales Smith et al
2014 showed that in a typical MW-like disk of gas the dark gas mass fraction fDG dened
as having WCO  01 K km s1 is about 42  but up to 62  in a radiation eld ten times that
of the solar neighbourhood While Smith et al 2014 keept metallicity constant throughout
the disk Wolre et al 2010 found fDG values of about 05  07 for the low metallicity cases
with Zcid48  05 however using a 1D PDR model only Recently Bisbas et al 2015 showed
how relatively modest CR ionization rates of 10  50  CRMW can effectively destroy most
CO in GMCs Such studies show that COH2 is lower in regions of low metallicity andor
intense FUV elds effectively leading to underestimates of the CO conversion factor when
not accounted for in models Since in this paper we have restricted our simulations to main-
sequence galaxies with solar or higher than solar metallicities adopting a constant Galactic
COH2 seems a reasonable choice but see Lagos et al 2012 Narayanan et al 2012 and
Narayanan  Krumholz 2014 for alternative approaches
 GMC density and thermal structure
When solving for the temperature structure of each GMC SGAME includes only the most
dominant atomic and molecular species in terms of heating and cooling efciencies In this ap-
proximation we also neglect X-ray irradiation and turbulence leaving these for a future study
We have however checked our Tk nH2 curves in Figure A4 against those of Glover  Clark
2012 who performed time-resolved high-resolution m cid39 00505 Mcid12 SPH simulations of
individual FUV irradiated molecular clouds using a chemical network of 32 species see their
Figure 2 Overall there is great similarity in the Tk vs nH2 behaviour of the two sets of simula-
tions This includes the same main trend of decreasing temperature with increasing hydrogen
density as well as the local increase in Tk at  103  104 cm3 and the subsequent decrease
to Tk  10 K at nH2  1055 cm3 Thus our GMCs models despite their simplied density
proles and chemistry seem to agree well with much more detailed simulations and we take
this as an indication that they also mimic the conditions in real molecular clouds well
47 CONCLUSIONS
In this chapter SGAME has been presented a code that simulates the molecular line emission
of galaxies via a detailed post-processing of the outputs from cosmological SPH simulations
A sequence of subgrid prescriptions are applied to a simulation snapshot in order to derive
the molecular gas density and temperature from the SPH particle information such as SFR gas
density temperature and metallicity SGAME stands out from other methods of its kind by
combining cosmological galaxy simulations with the following aspects
1 Local FUV eld and cosmic ray ionization rate
In SGAME the energetics of the ISM are driven by the local star formation rate density
which is what sets the local FUV and cosmic ray eld ie G0 and CR respectively and
thus the heating and ionization of the gas Unlike other simulations SGAME can there-
fore be used to study resolved properties within a galaxy as for example line ratios and
CO factors
2 Multiphase ISM
The partly ionised gas in the SPH simulation is rst cooled down to a cold neutral phase
by including only heating by cosmic rays counter-balanced by cooling via metal line
emission recombination processes and free-free emission In a second cooling step SGAME
determines the internal radial temperature prole of each GMC by considering cosmic
ray heating and photo-electric heating by FUV photons as wells as cooling by H2 CO
OI CII lines in addition to gas-dust interactions
3 Radiative transfer on sub-parsec scales
We constructed a grid of GMC models that probe a large range in mGMC Zcid48 and G0 On
each model the novel radiative transfer code LIME was employed for determining the
CO line emission so that SGAME can interpolate in mGMCZcid48G0  - space and sum up
the emission in several CO lines for an entire galaxy in a few minutes
We have used SGAME to create line emission velocity-cubes of the full CO rotational ladder
for three cosmological N-bodySPH simulations of massive M cid38 10105 Mcid12 main-sequence
galaxies at z  2
Molecular gas is produced more efciently towards the centre of each galaxy and while HI
surface gas densities including helium do not exceed  100 Mcid12 pc2 anywhere in the disk
central molecular gas surface densities reach  1000 Mcid12 pc2 on spatial scales of 80 pc 80 pc
in good agreement with observations made at similar spatial resolution This strong increase
in molecular surface density is brought on by a similar increase in total gas surface density
overcoming the increase in photo-dissociating FUV eld towards the centre of each galaxy
Turning to the CO emission the velocity-integrated moment 0 maps reveal distinct differ-
ences in the various transitions as molecular gas tracers The morphology of molecular gas in
our model galaxies is well reproduced in CO1-0 but going to higher transitions the region
of CO emitting gas shrinks towards the galaxy centres The global CO SLEDs of our simulated
galaxies all peak at J  3  2 indicating a dominating low-excitation gas Recent CO5  4
observations of z  15 BzK galaxies seem to suggest that these galaxies actually peak at higher
J presenting an important test case that we will be following closely in the future in order to
benchmark SGAME fully at z  2 before moving to eg higher redshifts The CO3  2 line
luminosities of our model galaxies are within the range of corresponding observed samples at
redshifts z  1 25 however on the low side In particular the model galaxies are below or at
the CO luminosities of BzK-selected galaxies of comparable mass and SFR but at z  15 The
low luminosities are most likely a consequence of molecular gas mass fractions in our galaxies
about 6 times below the observed values in the star-forming galaxies at z  1  25 used to
compare with
Combining the derived H2 gas masses with the CO1  0 line emission found we inves-
tigate local variations in the CO-H2 conversion factor CO The radial CO proles all show a
decrease towards the galaxy centres dropping by a factor of  1617 in the central R  1 kpc
region compared to the disk average and the main driver being the FUV eld rather than a gra-
dient in density or metallicity Global CO factors range from 14 to 16 Mcid12 pc2 K km s11
or about 03 times the MW value but closer to values for z  15 normal star-forming galaxies
identied with the BzK colour criteria
The CO luminosity ratios of CO 3210 and 7610 r32 and r76 respectively drop off
in radius about where the FUV radiation drops in intensity and thus likely controlled by FUV
eld as CO The global ratios of r21 cid39 14 and r32 cid39 07 agree very well with observations of
BzK galaxies while the r54 of about 08 is low compared to recent observations in BzK4171
and BzK21000 However more observations of Jup  3 lines towards high-z main-sequence
galaxies such as the BzKs are still needed in order to determine the turn-over in their CO
SLEDs and better constrain the gas excitation
Finally it is noted that SGAME in principle is able to simulate the emission from a broad
range of molecular and atomic lines in the far-IRmm wavelength regime provided measured
collision rates exist such as those found in the LAMDA database7 are available For more on
future applications of SGAME see the Outlook chapter after the following chapter

CII LINE EMISSION FROM GALAXIES
51 PROBING THE NEUTRAL AND IONIZED GAS
Being the fourth most common element after hydro-
gen in the Milky Way MW it comes as no surprise
that carbon is nearly ubiquitous thoughout the var-
ious phases of the ISM in star-forming galaxies eg
Dartois  Muoz-Caro 2007 Esteban et al 2014
James et al 2014 Much of that carbon is ionized
by the ultraviolet UV radiation permeating the ISM
due to the low ionization potential of carbon 113 eV
cf 136 eV for hydrogen As a result singly ionized
carbon CII is found in regions of ionized as well
as neutral gas In both regions the 2P32-2P12 ne
structure transition of CII can be collisionally excited
by electrons e atoms HI or molecules H2 de-
pending on the gas phase resulting in an emission
line at 157714 m or 19005369 GHz hereafter CII
The critical densities of CII are only 16 cm3 2400 cm3 and 4800 cm3 for collisions with
e HI and H2 respectively at a temperature of 500 K Goldsmith et al 2012 Together these
facts are what makes CII one of the strongest cooling lines of the ISM with a line luminosity
equivalent to  01  1 of the far-infrared FIR luminosity of galaxies eg Stacey et al 1991
Brauher et al 2008
Figure 51 The two level system of ionized car-
bon leading to the line emission at  158 m
The excitation happens via collisions with either
electrons atoms or molecules
52 OBSERVATIONS OF CII EMISSION IN GALAXIES AT HIGH
AND LOW REDSHIFT
Due to high atmospheric opacity at these frequencies observations of CII in the local Universe
must be done at high altitudes or in space Indeed the very rst detections of CII towards
Galactic objects Russell et al 1980 Stacey et al 1983 Kurtz et al 1983 and other galaxies
Crawford et al 1985 Stacey et al 1991 Madden et al 1992 were done with airborne obser-
vatories such as the NASA Lear Jet and the Kuiper Airborne Observatory The advent of the
Infrared Space Observatory ISO allowed for the rst systematic CII surveys of local galaxies
eg Malhotra et al 1997 Luhman et al 1998 2003 Detections of CII at high-z have also
become feasible over recent years with ground-based facilities Hailey-Dunsheath et al 2010
Stacey et al 2010 as well as the Herschel Space Observatory see the recent review by Casey
et al 2014
521 THE CII DEFICIT
Early observations and modeling suggested that CII is predominantly associated with Pho-
todissociation Regions PDRs in the outskirts of molecular clouds exposed to intense far-
ultraviolet FUV ratiation hence predicting a strong correlation between CII luminosity
LCII and that of reprocessed FUV light as measured in far-infrared FIR LFIR Tielens 
Hollenbach 1985 Crawford et al 1985 However a decit in LCII relative to LFIR was soon
observed towards local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ULIRGs and high-z galaxies domi-
nated by an AGN eg Malhotra et al 1997 Luhman et al 1998 Malhotra et al 2001 Luhman
et al 2003 Daz-Santos et al 2013 Farrah et al 2013 Some indications suggest that this
CII decit persists at high-z with the ratio extending to other FIR lines eg Graci-Carpio
et al 2011 though the existence of a high-z decit is debated Hailey-Dunsheath et al 2010
Wagg et al 2010 De Breuck et al 2011 Ferkinhoff et al 2011 Swinbank et al 2012 Magdis
et al 2014 nd that intermediate z  03 ULIRGs actually fall on the relation for local normal
galaxies measured by Malhotra et al 2001 suggesting that high-z ULIRGs are in fact scaled-
up versions of local star-forming galaxies rather than the disturbed systems resulting from
mergers that are typically associated with local z  02 ULIRGs The CII decit increases
with higher dust temperatures on both global and resolved scales in local galaxies eg Croxall
et al 2012 Daz-Santos et al 2013 Herrera-Camus et al 2015 shown with an example in
Fig 52 suggesting that dust plays a crucial role in controlling the LCIILFIR ratio
Figure 52 The CII decit as investigated and plotted by Daz-Santos et al 2013 for local luminous infrared galax-
ies LIRGs Deviation from the global CII-FIR relation increases with dust temperature corresponding to increasing
60100 m color
Various scenarios have been put forward as causing the CII decit see a summary of these
in eg Malhotra et al 2001 Herrera-Camus et al 2015 but a consesus has not been achieved
with observations and models so far Favoured scenarios causing the CII decit are ones in
which the efciency of the FUV light to heat the gas is decreased or obscuring dust absorbs the
FUV radiation before it reaches the potential sources of CII emission Such scenarios include
i large HII regions created by high ionization parameters where most of the FUV radiation
is absorbed by dust rather than goes to heating the gas via photo-ionization eg Tielens 
Hollenbach 1985 Abel et al 2009 Graci-Carpio et al 2011 Croxall et al 2012 ii high levels
of grain charging primarily in PDRs which decrease the efciency of photoelectric heating of
the gas by FUV radiation eg Malhotra et al 2001 Croxall et al 2012 Ibar et al 2015 and iii
dust-bounded clouds or PDRs in ULIRGs where high dust masses in the HII regions absorb
most FUV light before it reaches regions with more ionized carbon Luhman et al 2003 Farrah
et al 2013 Abel et al 2009
522 CONTRIBUTING GAS PHASES TO THE CII EMISSION
Knowing the relative contributions to LCII from different gas phases in the ISM would help
sorting out in the possible causes for the CII decit But observations of CII emission alone
will not readily give away information on the different ISM phases contributing unless com-
bined with some other gas tracer such as NII 122 m Malhotra et al 2001 or HI 21 cm
as well as CO line emission as done by Pineda et al 2013 for the MW in order to separate
contributions from ionized neutral and molecular gas Updated in Pineda et al 2014 the
ISM phases considered are found to contribute with rougly amounts to the total LCII with
30  from dense PDRs 25  from cold HI 25  from CO-dark H2 gas and 20  from ionized
gas Observing 60 normal star-forming galaxies in CII and NII Malhotra et al 2001 es-
timated that a rough mean of 50  of LCII comes from ionized gas and the rest from PDRs
Even larger PDR contributions were found in the giant HII region N11 in the Large Magellanic
Cloud LMC by Lebouteiller et al 2012 who conclude from comparison of CII with NII
that 95  of LCII arises in diffuse PDRs whereas dense PDRs are better traced by OI also
considered the second most important cooling line in neutral gas
CII AS A STAR FORMATION RATE TRACER
Since CII is sensitive to the local FUV eld which itself probes OB star formation activity
it was early on suggested that LCII correlates with SFR of a galaxy and observations soon
revealed a LCII-SFR correlation for nearby galaxies Stacey et al 1991 Leech et al 1999 Boselli
et al 2002 More comprehensive studies were performed by de Looze et al 2011 De Looze
et al 2014 and Farrah et al 2013 for modest star-forming galaxies and ULIRGs in the local
Universe The scatter in the LCII-SFR relation is substantial though apparently regardless of
the overall galaxy classication Sargsyan et al 2012 and increasing towards low metallicity
warm dust temperatures and large lling factors of ionized diffuse gas De Looze et al 2014
With the Photodetector Array Camera  Spectrometer PACS on board Herschel resolved
observations of CII in local galaxies became possiple eg De Looze et al 2014 Herrera-
Camus et al 2015 Kapala et al 2015 and the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array
ALMA promises to make such detections and observations relatively routine even at high-z
eg Wang et al 2013 The LCII-SFR relation has now also observed on kpc-scales in local
galaxies as a kind CII KS relation between surface density of SFR SFR and that of CII
luminosity CII eg De Looze et al 2014 Herrera-Camus et al 2015 Kapala et al 2015
Kapala et al 2015 concluded that CII traces SFR in the spiral arms of the Andromeda Galaxy
M31 similarly to what is seen in larger samples of more distant galaxies although with a
signicant contribution to CII from outside star-forming regions and a shallower slope of the
CII-SFR relation on  50 pc scales than on kpc scales For the MW Pineda et al 2014 nd
that only the combined emission of all gas phases leads to a slope of the CII-SFR relation in
agreement with extragalactic observations But the CII-SFR relation for local galaxies also
suffers from a great deal of scatter De Looze et al 2014 nd when observing 32 local dwarf
galaxies on kpc-scales that this scatter is most likely due to internal ISM conditions rather than
large variations within individual galaxies Analyzing 46 nearby mostly spiral galaxies from
the Herschel KINGFISH sample Herrera-Camus et al 2015 succeeded in reducing the scatter
on the CII-SFR relation at warm IR colors by deriving a set of IR color adjustments that can
be applied to normal star-forming galaxies in the absence of strong AGNs But a rm physical
reason for the scatter is still missing
Metallicity is a potentially important factor for the LCII-SFR as an increase in metallicity
translates into a higher mass fraction of carbon and dust both of which affect the LCII-SFR
relation Similar to De Looze et al 2014 Herrera-Camus et al 2015 found an increased
scatter around the LCII-SFR relation at low metallicities implying that at low metallicities a
non-negligible fraction of the neutral gas cooling takes place via the OI  63 m cooling line
instead the CII line In M31 Kapala et al 2015 see an increasing trend in LCIILTIR with
radius as expected if LCII itself dependeded strongly on metallicity since M31 excibits a clearly
decreasing metallicity with radius Sanders et al 2012 However Kapala et al 2015 cannot
rule out other factors such as stellar density and radiation eld strength Kramer et al 2013
found a sharp increase in LCIILFIR at R  45 kpc in M33 but dismiss metallicity as the
sole cause due to the rather shallow metallicity gradient in M33 Magrini et al 2010 The
effect of low metallicity together with the disruption of molecular clouds is also becoming
an important subject for studies of the Epoch of Reionization EoR at z  6 as a possible
explanation for several non-detections of normal star-forming galaxies Examples include the
lensed Ly emitter at z  656 and the Himiko galaxy at z  65 forming stars at a rate of  10
and  100 Mcid12 yr1 respectively Kanekar et al 2013 Ouchi et al 2013 and more recently 3
Lyman Break Galaxies at z  7 of SFR  10 Mcid12 yr1 Maiolino et al 2015
53 MODELING CII EMISSION
With the CII line increasingly being used as a tracer of gas and star formation at high redshifts
efforts have also recently been made to simulate the CII emission from galaxies Various sub-
grid gas physics approaches have been applied to both semi-analytical Popping et al 2014a
Muoz  Furlanetto 2013 and hydrodynamical Nagamine et al 2006 Vallini et al 2013
2015 simulations of galaxies The simulations by Nagamine et al 2006 focus on the CII
detectability of lyman break galaxies at z  3 while Vallini et al 2013 apply their simulations
to observed upper limits on the CII emission from the z  66 Ly emitter LAE Himiko
Ouchi et al 2013 nding that its metallicity must be subsolar Both set of simulations consider
a two-phase ISM consisting of a cold and a warm neutral in pressure equilibrium and both
nd that the the CII emission is dominated by the cold gas Most recently Vallini et al 2015
combined a z  7 galaxy simulated with GADGET-2 with different SFRs to show that most
CII emission originates in the PDRs irregardless of the SFR due a strong coupling between
the neutral gas and the CMB at z  7 For SFRs ranging from 01 to 100 Mcid12 yr1 the authors
predict a LCII-SFR relation slightly below the locally observed ones for dwarfs and starburst
galaxies however differing the inclusion of stellar feedback in the model for a future work
UNDERSTANDING THE LCII-SFR
RELATION WITH SIMULATIONS PAPER II
61 AIM OF THIS PROJECT
As described in the previous chapter simulations hold promise in aiding interpretation of the
CII emission In this chapter an expansion and improvement of SGAME is presented en-
abling the simulation of CII emission from galaxies with the principle goal of understanding
the dominant sites of origin of CII emission in modestly star-forming galaxies and how the
LCII-SFR relation is created on global and resolved scales Much of the formalism and method-
ology of SGAME stay unchanged and the reader is referred to the previous Chapter I for those
details However instead of making use of a radiative transfer code the CII emission is cal-
culated analytically for each ISM phase separately SGAME in its new form is then applied to a
cosmological SPH simulation of 7 massive star-forming galaxies on the main sequence at z  2
in order to simulate their CII emission By modeling the internal structure of the molecular
gas on scales down to about  05 pc as well as the ionized gas we1 investigate the origin of
the LCII-SFR relation on global and resolved scales and how metallicity affects the LCIISFR
radial gradient for normal galaxies of different SFR at z  2 Throughout a at cosmology is
adopted with M  027   073 and h  071 Spergel et al 2003
62 METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW
SGAME is the method that I created for post-processing of an SPH simulation with the aim
of predicting line emission from the ISM using subgrid physics prescriptions see also Chap-
ter I For the application towards predicting CII the following quantities associated with
each SPH particle are required the position x y z velocity vx vy vz smoothing length
h gas mass mSPH hydrogen density nH gas kinetic temperature Tk electron fraction
xe  nenH star formation rate SFR metallicity Z as well as the relative abundances of
carbon CH and oxygen OH The key spdf involved in the post-processing are illus-
trated in Fig 61 and briey listed below with details given in subsequent sections

electron fraction provided by the GADGET-3 simulations

Figure 61 Schematic illustrating the sub-grid procedures applied to the SPH simulation in post-processing Each
SPH particle is a hybrid of neutral and ionized gas The neutral gas associated with each SPH gas particle is divided
into GMCs with masses and sizes following the Galactic mass-spectrum and mass-size relation for GMCs Each GMC
has an onion-layer structure set by the stratication of the impinging FUV-eld which consist of an outer atomic PDR
layer of HI and CII and an inner molecular region where carbon is found in its single ionized state and in neutral form
further in Section 641 The ionized gas associated with each SPH particle is assumed to reside in spherical clouds
with radii and temperatures given by the SPH smoothing length and gas temperature Section 642
2 The neutral gas is divided into giant molecular clouds GMCs according to the observed
mass function of GMCs in the Milky Way MW and nearby quiescent galaxies The
GMCs are modelled as logotropic spheres with their sizes and internal velocity disper-
sions derived according to pressure-normalized scaling relations
3 Each GMC is assumed to consist of three spherically symmetric regions 1 a FUV-shielded
molecular core region where all carbon is locked up in CI and CO 2 an outer molecular
region where both CI and CII can exist and 3 a largely neutral atomic layer of HI HII and
CII The last region mimics the FUV-stratied PDRs observed at the surfaces of molecu-
lar clouds Hollenbach  Tielens 1999 The relative extent of these regions within each
cloud and thus the densities at which they occur ultimately depends on the strength of
the impinging FUV-eld and CR ionization rate The latter are set to scale with the local
SFR volume density and by requiring thermal balance with the cooling from line emis-
sion from CII OI and H2 determine the temperatures of the molecular and atomic gas
phases
4 The remaining ionized gas of the SPH simulation is divided into HII clouds of radius
equal to the smoothing lengths temperature equal to that of the SPH simulation and
constant density
5 The CII emission from the molecular atomicPDR and diffuse ionized gas is calculated
separately and summed to arrive at the total CII emission from the galaxy In doing so
it is assumed that there is no radiative coupling between the clouds in the galaxy
The SPH simulations used in this project and the galaxies extracted from them are described
in the following section
63 SPH SIMULATIONS
Our simulations are evolved with an updated version of the public GADGET-3 cosmological
SPH code Springel 2005 and Huang et al 2015 in prep It includes cooling processes us-
ing the primordial abundances as described in Katz et al 1996 with additional cooling from
metal lines assuming photo-ionization equilibrium from Wiersma et al 2009 We use the
more recent pressure-entropy formulation of SPH which resolves mixing issues when com-
pared with standard density-entropy SPH algorithms see Saitoh  Makino 2013 Hopkins
2013 for further details Our code additionally implements the time-step limiter of Saitoh 
Makino 2009 Durier  Dalla Vecchia 2012 which improves the accuracy of the time inte-
gration scheme in situations where there are sudden changes to a particles internal energy To
prevent articial fragmentation Schaye  Dalla Vecchia 2008 Robertson  Kravtsov 2008
we prohibit gas particles from cooling below their effective Jeans temperature which ensures
that we are always resolving at least one Jeans mass within a particles smoothing length This
is very similar to adding pressure to the interstellar medium as in Springel  Hernquist 2003
Schaye  Dalla Vecchia 2008 except instead of directly pressurizing the gas we prevent it
from cooling and fragmenting below the Jeans scale
We stochastically form stars within the simulation from molecular gas following a Schmidt
1959 law with an efciency of 1 per local free-fall time Krumholz  Tan 2007 Lada et al
2010 The molecular content of each gas particle is calculated via the equilibrium analytic
model of Krumholz et al 2008 2009 McKee  Krumholz 2010 This model allows us to
regulate star formation by the local abundance of H2 rather than the total gas density which
connes star formation to the densest peaks of the interstellar medium Further implementa-
tion details can be found in Thompson et al 2014 Galactic outows are implemented using
the hybrid energymomentum-driven wind ezw model fully described in Dav et al 2013
Ford et al 2015 We also account for metal enrichment from Type II supernovae SNe Type
Ia SNe and AGB stars as described in Oppenheimer  Dav 2008
631 SPH SIMULATIONS OF z  2 MAIN SEQUENCE GALAXIES
We use the cosmological zoom-in simulations presented in Thompson et al 2015 and briey
summarized here
Initial conditions were generated using the MUSIC code Hahn  Abel
2011 assuming cosmological parameters consistent with constraints from the Planck Planck
Collaboration et al 2013 results namely m  03   07 H0  70 8  08 ns  096 Six
target halos were selected at z  2 from a low-resolution N-body simulation consisting of 2563
dark-matter particles in a 16h1Mpc3 volume with an effective comoving spatial resolution
of pdf ilon  125 h1 kpc Each target halo is populated with higher resolution particles at
z  249 with the size of each high resolution region chosen to be 25 times the maximum
radius of the original low-resolution halo The majority of halos in our sample are initialized
with a single additional level of renement pdf ilon  0625 h1kpc while the two smallest
halos are initialized with two additional levels of renement pdf ilon  03125 h1kpc

Mionized the gas masses in neutral and ionized form respectively see Section 64 The metallicity Zcid48  ZZcid12 is the
mean of all SPH gas particles within Rcut
64 MODELING THE ISM
As illustrated in Fig 61 the rst step in modelling the ISM is to split each SPH particle into an
ionized and a neutral gas component This is done using the electron fraction xe associated
with each SPH particle ie
mneutral  1  xemSPH
mionized  xemSPH
The electron fraction from GADGET-3 gives the density of electrons relative to that of hydrogen
nenH and can therefore reach values of  116 in the case where helium is also ionized As a
result we re-normalized the distribution of xe values to a maximal xe of 1 so as to not exceed
the total gas mass in the simulation Fig 63 shows the distribution of SPH gas particles masses
in G4  chosen for its position near the center of the stellar and gas mass ranges of G1  G7
 along with the mass distributions of the neutral and ionized gas components obtained from
eqs 61 and 62
The ionized gas is seen to have a relatively at distribution spanning the mass range 
1043  1058 Mcid12 The neutral gas however peaks at two characteristic masses  1055 Mcid12
and  1058 Mcid12 where the lower mass peak represents gas particles left over from the rst
generation of stars in the simulation

Masses sizes and velocity dispersion
The neutral gas mass mneutral associated with a given SPH particle is divided into GMCs by
randomly sampling the GMC mass spectrum as observed in the Galactic disk and Local Group

galaxies
a lower and upper cut in mass of 104 Mcid12 and 106 Mcid12 respectively are enforced in order to
ensure the GMC masses stay within the range observed by Blitz et al 2007 Up to 40 GMCs
are created per SPH particle but typically most  90 of the SPH particles are split into
four GMCs or less While mneutral never exceeds the upper GMC mass limit 106 Mcid12 there are
instances where mneutral is below the lower GMC mass limit 104 Mcid12 In those cases we simply
Figure 63 The distribution of SPH gas particle masses solid histogram in G4 The distribution peaks at two char-
acteristic masses  1055 Mcid12 and  1058 Mcid12 where the lower mass peak represents gas particles left over from the
rst generation of stars in the simulation Splitting the gas into its neutral and ionized components according to eqs
61 and 62 results in the mass distribution given by the dotted and dashed histograms respectively
discard the gas ie remove it from any further sub-grid processing For the highest resolution
simulations in our sample G1 and G2 the discarded neutral gas amounts to  6  of the total
neutral gas mass and  002  in the remaining ve galaxies We shall therefore assume that it
does not affect our results signicantly
The GMCs are randomly distributed within 02 the smoothing length of the original SPH
particle but with the radial displacement scaling inversely with GMC mass in order to retain
the original gas mass distribution as closely as possible To preserve the overall gas kinematics
as best possible all GMCs associated with a given SPH particle are given the same velocity as
that of the SPH particle
GMC sizes are obtained from the pressure-normalized scaling relations for virialized molec-
ular clouds which relate cloud radius Rcloud with mass mGMC and external pressure Pext

where gas and  are the local surface densities of gas and stars respectively and gas
and  their local velocity dispersions measured perpendicular to the mid-plane see eg
Elmegreen 1989 Swinbank et al 2011 For each SPH particle all of these quantities are
calculated directly from the simulation output using a radius of R  1 kpc from each SPH
particle and it is assumed that the resulting Pext is the external pressure experienced by all
of the GMCs generated by the SPH particle We nd that GMCs in our simulated galaxies are
subjected to a wide range of external pressures PextkB  102  107 cm3 K For comparison
the range of pressures experienced by clouds in our Galaxy and in Local Group galaxies is
PextkB  103  107 cm3 K with an average of PextkB  104 cm3 K in Galactic clouds
Elmegreen 1989 Blitz et al 2007 This results in GMC sizes in our simulations ranging from
Rcloud  1  300 pc
The internal velocity dispersion v of the GMCs is inferred from the virial theorem which
provides us with a pressure-normalized v  RGMC relation

While the total hydrogen density follows a logotropic prole the transition from H2HIHII
is assumed to be sharp Similarly for the transition from CICII This is illustrated in Fig 64
which shows an example density prole of a GMC from our simulations From the center of
the GMC and out to RH2 hydrogen is in molecular form Beyond RH2 hydrogen is found as
HI and HII out to Rcloud

for the very inner region R  RCI indicated in brown with the CI to CII transition happening instantaneously at

CII emission from RH2  R  RGMC indicated in orange is referred to as atomic or PDR emission The relative

 The metallicity Zcid48 of the GMC which is inherited from its parent SPH particle and assumed
constant throughout the cloud
 The kinetic temperature of the gas at the GMC surface TkRGMC This quantity is calculated
in an iterative process together with fcid48
mol by solving the following thermal balance equation
PE  CRHI  CII  OI
where PE is the heating rate associated with the photoelectric ejection of electrons from dust
grains by the FUV eld and CRHI is the heating rate by cosmic rays in atomic gas The main
cooling agents are assumed to be due to CII and OI63 m and 145 m line emission ie
CII and OI respectively PE CRHI and CII all depend on the electron fraction at RGMC
which is determined by the degree of HI ionization by the local FUV radiation eld and CR
ionization rate see below for how these quantities are derived For analytical expressions for
the heating rates we refer to Olsen et al submitted For OI we use the expressions given in
Rllig et al 2006 The calculation of CII at the GMC surface is detailed in Section 65 and
Appendix A3
 The strength of the local FUV radiation eld G0 and the CR ionization rate CR imping-
ing on the GMCs These quantities do not come out from the simulation directly and instead
they are calculated by scaling the Galactic FUV eld G0MW and CR ionization rate CRMW
with the local SFR volume density in the simulations ie G0  G0MW SFRDlocalSFRDMW
and CR  CRMW SFRDlocalSFRDMW where SFRDlocal is estimated for each SPH parti-
cle as the volume averaged SFR within a 2 kpc radius2 We have adopted Milky Way values
of G0MW  06 Habing Seon et al 2011 and CRMW  3  1017 s1 Webber 1998 For
SFRDMW we adopt 00024 Mcid12 yr1 kpc3 inferred from the average Galactic SFR 03 Mcid12 yr1
within a disk 10 kpc in radius and 02 kpc in height Heiderman et al 2010 Bovy et al 2012
 The electron fraction at the cloud boundary This fraction is not the previously introduced
xe which was inherent to the SPH simulations and used to split the SPH gas into a neutral
and ionized gas phase Instead it is the electron fraction given by the degree of ionization
of HI caused by the G0 and CR impinging on the cloud This fraction and thus the HIHII
ratio is calculated with CLOUDY v1303 Ferland et al 2013 given the hydrogen density and
temperature at the cloud boundary and assuming an unattenuated G0 and CR at RGMC
The CII emitting region in each of our GMCs is dened as the layer between the surface
of the cloud and the depth at which the abundances of C and C are equal Hence if the latter
occurs at a radius RCI from the cloud center the thickness of the layer is Rcloud  RCI Fig 64
At radii  RCI all carbon atoms are for simplicity assumed to be in neutral form In order
to determine the fractional radius rCI  RCIRGMC we follow the work of Rllig et al 2006

the thermal balance

where CRH2
is the cosmic ray heating in molecular gas and H2 is the cooling due to the
S0 and S1 rotational lines of H2 Papadopoulos et al 2014 see also Olsen et al submitted
CRH2 depends on xe which is calculated with CLOUDY for the local CR ionization rate and the
attenuated FUV eld at rH2 ie G0eFUVAVrH2  AVrH2  corresponds the extinction through
the outer atomic transition layer of each GMC
The temperature of the atomicPDR gas ie from the gas between RH2 and Rcloud is as-
sumed to be constant and equal to the temperature at Rcloud
For each GMC we solve in an iterative manner simultaneously for RH2 eq 610 and RCI
eq 615 as well as for the gas temperature at Rcloud and at RH2 eqs 611 and 616 respec-
tively
The resulting distributions of RH2 and RCI for the GMC population in G4 are shown in
Fig 65 middle panel along with the distribution of RGMC obtained from eq 63 In GMCs
in general we expect RCI  RH2 due to efcient H2 selfshielding However as Fig 65 shows
some of the GMCs in our simulations have very small RH2 due to them having virtually zero
molecular gas fractions and in those cases RCI can be equal to or even exceed RH2 The latter
implies that the CII emission is only coming from the atomicPDR phase with no contribu-
tion from the molecular gas
The distributions of the kinetic temperature of the gas at RH2 and Rcloud for the GMC pop-
ulation in G4 are also shown in Fig 65 bottom panel The temperatures at the cloud surfaces
range from  8 K to  1055 K and the temperatures at RH2 lies between  8  1800 K
With RH2 and RCI determined for each GMC we can calculate the gas masses associated
with the molecular and atomicPDR gas phase respectively The resulting mass distribu-
tions are shown in the top panel of Fig 65 along with the distribution of total GMC masses
mGMC as determined by the adopted GMC mass spectrum Section 641 We see that most
of the molecular and atomicPDR gas masses follow the total GMC mass spectrum There is
however a fraction of GMCs with extremely small molecular gas masses corresponding to
mol  0 On the other hand there are some GMCs with small atomicPDR gas masses ie
fcid48

642 THE IONIZED GAS
The ionized gas in our simulations see eq 62 is assumed to be distributed in spherical clouds
of uniform densities and with radii RHII equal to the smoothing lengths of the original SPH
particles These ionized regions in our simulations are furthermore assumed to be isothermal
with the temperatures equal to that of the SPH gas Fig 66 shows the size top and temper-
ature bottom distribution for the ionized clouds in G4 Cloud sizes range from  01 kpc to
 10 kpc with more than 60  of the ionized gas mass residing in clouds of size  1000 pc For
comparison the range of observed sizes of HII clouds in nearby galaxies is 10  1000 pc Oey

bulk of the ionized gas having temperatures  1045 K

by radiative processes and collisional deexcitation see Appendix A3 The latter can occur
via collisions with e HI or H2 depending on the state of the gas In our simulations the
collisional partner is H2 in the molecular phase HI and e in the PDR regions and e in
the ionized gas Analytical expressions for the corresponding collision rate coefcients as a
function of temperature are given in Appendix A3 nCII is the number density of singly ionized
carbon and is given by nCII  XCfCIInH where fCII is the fraction of carbon atoms in the singly

in temperature hydrogen density FUV eld strength and cosmic ray ionization rate
We calculate the integral in eq 618 numerically by splitting the R2  R1 region up into 100
radial bins In each bin nH is set to be constant and  in the case of the molecular and PDR
regions  given by the logotropic density prole at the radius of the given bin Fig 64 For
the ionized clouds nH is constant throughout Section 642 For the PDR regions ie from
RH2 to RGMC we assume that the temperature electron fraction and G0 are kept xed to the
outer boundary value at RGMC ie no attenuation of the FUV eld This implies that the
CII luminosity from the PDR gas is an upper limit Similar for the CII emission from the
molecular region ie from RCI to RH2 where we assume that the temperature throughout
this region is xed to its values at RH2 Also throughout this region we adopt the attenuated
FUV eld at RH2

66 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Having divided the ISM in our galaxies into molecular atomic and ionized gas phases and
having devised a methodology for calculating their CII emission we are now in a position
to quantify the relative contributions from the aforementioned gas phases to the total CII
emission and examine their relationship to the on-going star formation
661 RADIAL CII LUMINOSITY PROFILES
First however to get a sense of the distribution of gas and star formation in our simulated
galaxies we show in Fig 67 surface density maps of the total SPH gas left column and star
formation rate middle column when viewed face-on The maps reveal spiral galaxy mor-
phologies albeit with some variety some G1 G2 and G3 show perturbed spiral arms due
to on-going mergers with satellite galaxies others G4 G5 G6 and G7 have seemingly undis-
turbed grand-design spiral arms a central bar-like structure is also seen in some G2 G4 G5
and G7 Overall the star formation is seen to be much more centrally concentrated than the
SPH gas This is especially true for G1 and G2 which have very centrally peaked star forma-
tion The radial SFR and CII luminosity proles of G1  G7  derived by summing up the
SFR and the CII luminosity within concentric rings of xed width 02 kpc  are also shown
in Fig 67 We have inferred the radial CII luminosity distribution for the full ISM as well as
for the individual gas phases
The radial SFR proles of our model galaxies typically peak at R  05 kpc in G1 at
R  05 kpc and then tail off with radius In some cases local peaks in the star formation
activity occur at galactocentric distances  2 kpc corresponding to the locations of either satel-
lite galaxies G2 and G3 or very dense spiral arms G5 and G7 In terms of the total CII
luminosity proles grey histograms tracing the star formation there is a broad agreement in
that the former also tends to peak at R  05 kpc In fact for R  15 kpc there is in general
a good correspondence between the CII emission and the star formation rate This is due
to the fact that the molecular gas dominates the CII emission in the central regions and that
within this region the radial CII emission prole from this gas phase follows that of the SFR
relatively well At larger galactocentric distances R  2 however the CII emission from the
molecular gas not only falls off more quickly than the radial SFR but local enhancements in the
latter are not matched by increased CII emission from the molecular gas eg G1 G2 and G3
These SFR enhancements are however reected in the CII emission prole of the ionized gas
which is the component that best follows the SFR radial prole although it never contributes
by more than a fraction of the total CII emission budget The PDRs start to dominant the CII
luminosity already at  15 kpc and remain dominant out to R  8 kpc
Fig 68 displays the fractional CII luminosity coming from the different ISM phases in the
top panel for the entire disk R  10 kpc in the mid panel only within R  1 kpc and in the
bottom panel for the outer disk R  2 kpc
In the bottom right panel of Fig 67 we show the Galactic SFR and CII luminosity radial
proles from Pineda et al 2014 who observed the CII emission from 1 CO-dark H2 gas
and dense PDRs 2 cold neutral HI gas and 3 hot ionized gas in our own Galaxy In order
to facilitate an approximate comparison with our simulations we identify these three Galactic
ISM phases with the molecular atomic and ionized gas in our simulations It is important to
keep in mind however that the ISM in our simulations has a higher pressure is kinematically
more violent and is more actively forming stars than is the case in our Galaxy
Figure 67 Gas and SFR surface density maps left and middle columns respectively of our SPH simulated galaxies
viewed face-on see also Thompson et al 2015 The horizontal white bars correspond to a physical scale of 5 kpc
The radial proles of the total CII luminosity grey histogram and the contributions from molecular gas red PDRs
orange and ionized gas blue are shown in the righthand column Also shown is the radial SFR prole black curve
inferred from the 14 GHz intensity distribution Pineda et al 2014
Figure 67 Continued Bottom panel shows as a reference the radial LCII prole of the Galaxy grey histogram
along with the contributions from CO-dark H2 gas and dense PDRs red curve cold H I orange curve and ionized
gas blue curve Pineda et al 2014
The SFR and CII proles in our Galaxy peak at larger radii R  4  5 kpc than in our
simulated galaxies This is not surprising given the low content of star formation and gas in
the Galactic bulge and the fact that the bulk of star formation in our Galaxy takes place in the
disk In contrast gas is still being funneled towards the centre in our simulations where it is
converted into stars Thus the SFR level in our simulated galaxies is much higher by  10
and more centrally concentrated than in our Galaxy where stars form at a rate of 01 Mcid12 yr1
out to R  8 kpc Remarkably signicant levels of CII emission extend out to R  20 kpc
in our Galaxy well beyond the point where star formation has ceased Here the emission
is completely dominated by CO-dark H2 gas and dense PDR regions This is similar to the
picture seen in our simulated galaxies where the CII emission at large radii is dominated by a
neutral gas phase  designated PDR gas in our simulations dubbed CO-dark H2  dense PDR
gas in Pineda et al 2014  that is seemingly uncoupled from star formation The radial CII
prole of the ionized gas in the Galaxy roughly follows the SFR prole as is the case in our
simulations
662 THE INTEGRATED LCII-SFR RELATION
Karen Moved this paragraph down here from previous section  In terms of integrated
luminosities ie within R  10 kpc the molecular gas can constitute from  32 G1 to
 91  G7 of the total CII luminosity for the PDR gas the range is  8 G7 to  68
G1 the contribution from the ionized gas is  1 Fig 68 In the Galaxy however the this
phase seems to be a more important contributor to the overall CII budget Pineda et al 2014
estimates that 55  of the total Galactic CII luminosity is from molecular gas and dense PDRs
25  from cold HI and 20  from the ionized gas
Fig 69 shows the integrated LCII  SFR relations for our model galaxies rst for their
entire ISM in the top panel and in separate panels below for each of the three ISM phases
considered in our simulations
When considering the entire ISM a tight correlation between LCII and SFR emerges which
is well t in log-log space by a straight line with slope 127  017 solid line in the top panel
This relation is largely set by the molecular and PDR gas phases The molecular gas phase
itself exhibiting a strong correlation between CII and SFR with slope 172  022 drives the
slope of the total correlation The PDR gas on the other hand exhibits a weak dependence on
CII with a slope of 043  020 but contributes signicantly to the overall normalization of
the total CII  SFR relation especially at the low SFR end see Fig 69 The CII emission
from the ionized gas also shows a weak dependancy on SFR slope 044  030 compared to
the molecular gas but again does not contribute signicantly to the total CII emission its
normalization factor being  10 below that of both the PDR and molecular gas at the low SFR
end of our sample Fig 69 bottom panel
In the top panel of Fig 69 we compare the LCII  SFR relation obtained from our simu-
lated galaxies with various samples compiled from the literature of CII detected galaxies in
the redshift range z  065 In terms of the slope of the LCII  SFR relation our model galax-
ies display a steeper slope 127  017 than do z  0 normal star-forming spiral galaxies with
similar levels of SFR  02  100 Mcid12 yr1 Malhotra et al 2001 which have a slope of unity
The latter is obtained from a power-law t to the CII and FIR 425  1225 m luminosities
in units of Lcid12 of the Malhotra et al 2001 sample LC II  10251LFIR Magdis et al 2014
which we then convert to LC II  105107SFR using SFR  LFIR34109 This relationship
is shown as the dotted line in Fig 69 While the slope of our model galaxies differ by  1 
from the z  0 sample spirals and ULIRGs their luminosities agree at least on the low SFR
Figure 68 Contributions to the total CII luminosity from the molecular red PDR yellow and ionized blue gas
phases for each of our simulated galaxies ranked according to their total SFRs The three panels show the relative
contributions within R  10 kpc top for R  1 kpc middle and for R  2 kpc bottom The horizontal dashed
lines and the percentages given indicate the relative contributions to the total CII luminosity of our own Galaxy from
CO-dark H2  dense PDR gas red 55 cold atomic gas yellow 25 and ionized gas blue 20 Pineda et al
side where the two relations cross at SFR 10 Mcid12 yr1
A direct comparison with CII detected galaxies at high redshifts is complicated by the
fact that the latter typically have signicantly larger SFRs than our model galaxies Further-
more high-z samples are often heterogeneous eg signicant AGN contribution cf Gullberg
et al 2015
It is clear from Fig 69 however that the observed high-z galaxies lie signi-
cantly below the trend dened by our model galaxies extended to higher SFRs For example
a power-law t to the z  1 star-forming galaxies with SFR cid38 300 Mcid12 yr1 compiled by D14
yields LC II  17  107SFR085 D14 shown as the dashed line in Fig 69 ie  1  below
our slope 127  017 However restricting our ndings to the CII emission of moderately
star-forming galaxies we nd that the global LCII  SFR relation matches extragalactic obser-
vations but only when the CII emission from all ISM phases is included in concurrence with
the conclusions of Pineda et al 2014
Finally we note that the scatter of our simulated galaxies around their best-t relation is
014 dex which is signicantly lower than the observed scatter of typically 02  04 dex eg

and listed again for convenience in the bottom panel From top to bottom panel we show the CII luminosity from the
full ISM grey the molecular gas red PDRs orange and ionized gas blue For comparison we show individual
CII observations of 54 z  0 spirals purple lled circles Malhotra et al 2001 with the best t to this sample given
by the dotted line see main text for details Also shown are 240 z  0 ULIRGs purple open circles Daz-Santos
et al 2013 Farrah et al 2013 and 12 z  03 ULIRGs red triangles Magdis et al 2014 The high-z comparison
samples include 25 1  z  6 star-forming galaxies cyan squares D14 and the dashed line indicate the best t to
this sample Also shown are 16 z  4  7 QSOs green triangles Iono et al 2006 Walter et al 2009 Wagg et al 2010
Gallerani et al 2012 Wang et al 2013 Venemans et al 2012 Carilli et al 2013 Willott et al 2013 and 10 normal
star-forming z  5  6 galaxies magenta stars observed by Capak et al 2015 The Galaxy is shown for reference
with a grey cross Pineda et al 2014
D14 We attribute this to the fact that our simulated galaxies constitute a fairly homogeneous
and small sample spanning a rather small range in for example SFR LCII and Zcid48 unlike
the observed samples with which we are comparing
663 THE RESOLVED CII  SFR RELATION
In Fig 610 we show the combined CII  SFR relation of all seven simulated galaxies in
their face-on conguration for the entire ISM top panel and for each of the separate gas
phases bottom three panels Surface densities were determined within 1 kpc  1 kpc regions
Contours reect the number of regions at a given SFRCII-combination and are given as
percentages of the peak number of regions
Given the variations in the local star formation conditions within our model galaxies we
can explore the relationship between CII and star formation over a much wider range of star
formation intensities than is possible with the integrated quantities A CII  SFR correlation
spanning more than ve decades in SFR is seen for the entire ISM as well as for the individual
ISM phases Similar to the integrated CII vs SFR relations in the previous section the molec-
ular and PDR phases dominate the resolved CII emission budget at all star formation rate
surface densities and with the molecular relation being steeper and exhibiting a larger degree
of scatter Again the contribution from the ionized phase while clearly depending on SFR is
largely negligible at all star formation densities
We compare the CII  SFR relation for our simulated galaxies to that of three resolved
surveys of nearby galaxies 1 the  50 pc-scale relation derived from ve 3cid48  3cid48 elds towards
M 31 K15 shown as green points in Fig 610 2 the kpc-scale relation obtained for 48 local
dwarf galaxies covering a wide range in metallicities ZZcid12  002  1 D14 cyan crosses
and 3 the kpc-scale relations for mostly spiral galaxies H15 magenta contours The data
from these surveys have been converted to the Chabrier IMF assumed by our simulations by
multiplying SFR with a factor 094 when a Kroupa IMF was adopted D14 K15 or 092 when
a truncated Salpeter IMF was used H15 following Calzetti et al 2007 and Speagle et al
2014 Regarding the observations by H15 we adopt the raw CII measurements rather than
the IR-color-corrected ones From Fig 610 it is clear that over the range in SFR  0001 
1 Mcid12 yr1 kpc2 spanned by these three surveys the CII  SFR relation dened by our
simulations is shallower than the observations with a slope of slope 060  002 compared to
slopes in the range 067  076 found by K15 for the ve elds in M 31 with an average of 077
In addition the CII- SFR relation of our model galaxies overshoots the observations which
could be either an issue with the model or an actual difference between typical ISM locally and
at z  2
Beyond the above SFR-range a comparison with the observations has to rely on extrapo-
lations of the simple power-law ts to the observed CII  SFR relations shown as dashed
dotted and dash-dotted lines for D14 H15 and K15 respectively See Fig 610 At low SFR
cid46 0001 Mcid12 yr1 kpc2 our simulations predict CII emission levels  10 higher than the
survey-based extrapolations This excess CII emission is driven by the PDR gas in our simu-
lations second panel in Fig 610 and its very shallow nearly constant CII  SFR relation-
ship Interestingly in at least two of the ve elds in M 31 studied by K15 green dots a similar
 albeit much less severe  CII-excess relative to the power-law t dashed line is observed
at SFR  0001 Mcid12 yr1 kpc2 see also Fig 7 in K15 K15 argues that the excess is due to a
contribution from diffuse ionized gas HII although they cannot discount the possibility that
the larger dispersion is at least partly due to being close to the sensitivity limit of their survey
at such low CII Our simulations however clearly show no signicant contribution from the
diffuse HII gas phase at low SFR
At high SFR  01 Mcid12 yr1 kpc2 our z  2 simulations predict less CII emission than
do the locally observed relation due to the dominating PDR gas which attens out at low SFR
and sets the shallow slope of our model galaxies But reassuringly the contours of our models
incorporate the few observations so far made at SFR  01 Mcid12 yr1 kpc2 ie the sample
from D14 cyan points in Fig 610 and the z  476 galaxy observed last year by red cross De
Breuck et al 2014
The aforementioned studies of local galaxies typically measure both obscured eg from
24 m and un-obscured from either FUV or H SFRs in order to estimate the total SFR
and while intrinsic uncertainties are inherent in the empirical 24 mFUVH  SFR calibra-
tions the SFR values should therefore be directly comparable to those from our simulations
Nonetheless some caution is called for when comparing our simulations to resolved observa-
tions primarily regarding the determination of SFR on cid46 kpc-scales In particular as pointed
out by D14 the emission from old stellar populations in diffuse regions with no ongoing star
formation can lead to overestimates of the SFR when using the above empirical SFR calibra-
tions Both K15 and H15 account for this by subtracting the expected cirrus emission from old
stars in 24 m using the method presented in Leroy et al 2012 although on scales cid28 1 kpc
this correction for 24 m cirrus emission becomes particularly challenging as it was calibrated
on  1 kpc scales K15 further points to the problem arising from the possibility of photons
leaking between neighboring stellar populations meaning that average estimates of the SFR
on scales  50 pc might not represent the true underlying SFR
664 PHYSICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE LCII-SFR RELATION
It is well-known that both at low and high redshifts the star formation rate of galaxies is
strongly correlated with their molecular gas content as traced by CO eg Kennicutt 1998
Daddi et al 2010 Genzel et al 2010 Narayanan et al 2012 This SFR H2 dependency is di-
rectly incorporated into the SPH simulations see Section 63 and it is therefore natural to ask
whether the integrated CII  SFR relation examined in Section 662 might simply be a case
of galaxies with higher star formation rates having larger molecular gas masses with higher
associated CII luminosities To investigate this we show in Fig 611 CII luminosity vs gas
mass for the full ISM in our simulated galaxies and for their gas phases separately For the
molecular gas we see a strong luminositymass scaling red curve which would explain the
strong LCIISFR relation for this phase and at least in part the LCIISFR relation for the full
ISM Clearly the atomic PDR gas and the ionized gas do not exhibit a similar luminositymass
scaling Since on average signicantly more mass resides in each of these two phases than in
the molecular phase this has the effect of weakening the LCII  SFR relation for the full ISM
In their
study of low-metallicity dwarf galaxies D14 compared total IRUV SFRs to SFRs derived
using the best-t LCII  SFR relation to their entire sample They found an increase in the
SFRIRUVSFRCII fraction corresponding to weaker CII emission towards lower metallici-
ties In Fig 612 we show SFRLCII as a function of ZOH  12log OH for our simulated
galaxies as well as for the dwarf galaxy sample of D14 As D14 points out ZOH does not take
into account potential decits of carbon relative to the OH abundance potentially obscur-
The abundances of metals in the ISM is expected to affect the CII emission
Figure 610 CII luminosity surface density CII vs SFR surface density SFR for the full ISM in our simulated

et al 2014
Figure 611 CII luminosity versus mass for the total ISM back line the molecular red line PDR orange line and
HII blue line gas phase The CII emission from the molecular gas is seen to increase with the amount of molecular
gas available whereas this is not the case for gas associated with PDRs and HII regions
ing any potential correlation between CII luminosity and actual carbon abundance In Fig
612 we therefore also plot SFRLCII as a function of ZCH  12  log CH No trend in
SFRLCII is seen for our model galaxies This is not surprising since they span a limited range
in ZOH 803896 and as we saw in Section 662 form a tight 01 dex CII  SFR relation
To better understand how the metallicity and also the ISM pressure affects the CII emis-
sion we dene a CII emission efciency pdf ilonCII of a given gas phase as the CII
luminosity of the gas phase divided by its mass and examine how it depends on Zcid48 and
PextkB Specically we create a grid of Zcid48 PextkB values and in each grid point the me-
dian pdf ilonCII of all clouds in our simulated galaxies is calculated The resulting pdf ilonCII
contours as a function of Zcid48 and PextkB are shown in Fig 613 for the molecular top PDR
middle and HII bottom phases For comparison we also show the median Zcid48- and PextkB-
values for each of our galaxies
The molecular phase in our simulations is seen to radiate most efciently in CII at rela-
tively high metallicities log Zcid48  05 and cloud external pressures PextkB  106 cm3 K
The PDR and ionized phases however have their maximal pdf ilonCII at log Zcid48  0 and
Pext  104 cm3 K ie at  100 lower pressures than the molecular phase and can main-
tain a signicant CII efciency  20 even at PextkB  102 cm3 K provided log Zcid48  0
This is consistent with our nding in Section 661 that the molecular phase dominates the
CII emission in the central high-pressure regions while the PDR gas dominates further out
in the galaxy where the ISM pressure is less extreme In all three panels G6 and G7 lie in re-
gions of high pdf ilonCII  50 for the molecular and PDR gas Thus the reason why these
two galaxies have the highest total CII luminosities is in part due to the fact that they have
Figure 612 SFRLCII as a function of metallicity for our model galaxies The metallicity is parametrized both
relative to the oxygen circles and the carbon crosses abundance The galaxies are color coded in the usual manner
For comparison we show SFRLCII for the local dwarf galaxy sample of D14 where SFRs are from combined UV
and 24 m measurements
the highest molecular gas masses by nearly an order of magnitude see Fig 611 and in part
due to the bulk of their cloud population GMCs or ionized clouds having sufciently high
metallicities on average  5 higher than G2 and experiencing external pressures  100
higher on average than the remaining galaxies which drives their CII efciencies up
67 COMPARING WITH OTHER CII SIMULATIONS
A direct quantitative comparison with other CII emission simulation studies in the literature
Nagamine et al 2006 Vallini et al 2013 2015 Popping et al 2014a Muoz  Furlanetto
2013 is complicated by the fact that there is not always overlap in the masses andor red-
shifts of the galaxies simulated by the aforementioned studies and our model galaxies Fur-
thermore there are fundamental differences in the simulation approach with some adopting
semi-analytical models Popping et al 2014a Muoz  Furlanetto 2013 and others adopt-
ing SPH simulations Nagamine et al 2006 Vallini et al 2013 2015 Also differences in the
numerical resolution of both types of simulations and in the specics of the sub-grid physics
implemented can lead to diverging results and make comparisons difcult
The method presented here for estimating CII emission in galaxies combines cosmological
galaxy simulations with a sub-grid treatment of a multi-phase ISM that is locally heated by FUV
radiation and cosmic rays in a manner that depends on the local star formation rate density
within the galaxies We have applied our method to a high resolution mSPH cid39 17  104 Mcid12
cosmological SPH simulation of z  2 star-forming galaxies ie baryonic mass resolution
mSPH cid39 17  104 Mcid12 and gravitational softening length cid39 06 h1 kpc see Section 63 In

for the molecular top PDR middle and HII bottom gas phases in our model galaxies In each panel the contours
indicate 001 1 2 5 10 20 50 70 and 90 percentages of the maximum efciency For reference the maximum
median pdf ilonCII for the molecular PDR and ionized gas phases are 37 66 and 002 Lcid12Mcid12 respectively
Median values of Zcid48 and PextkB and for the GMC and ionized cloud population in each model galaxies are indicated
as colored circles error bars are the 1 dispersion of the distributions
our simulations molecular neutral and ionized ISM phases are considered simultaneously as
contributors to the CII emission for the rst time in the history of CII simulations Another
unique feature of our model is the inclusion of CRs as a route to produce C deep inside the
GMCs where UV photons cannot penetrate see Section 65
Our simulations probably come closest  both in terms of methodology and galaxies sim-
ulated  to those of Nagamine et al 2006 and Vallini et al 2015 who both employed cos-
mological simulations with GADGET-2 the precursor for GADGET-3 used here to predict total
CII luminosities Nagamine et al 2006 used their modeling to calculate the CII emission
from dark matter halos associated with z cid39 3 lyman break galaxies LBGs with M  1010 Mcid12
and SFR  30 Mcid12 yr1 see also Nagamine et al 2004 Their simulations employed gas mass
resolutions in the range mSPH cid39 3  1058 Mcid12 and gravitational softening lengths of typi-
cally  1h1 kpc In their simulations the ISM consist of a cold neutral medium T  80 K
and n  10 cm3 and a warm neutral medium T  8000 K and n  01 cm3 in pressure-
equilibrium and the assumption is made that the CII emission only originates from the for-
mer phase The thermal balance calculation of the ISM includes heating by grain photo-electric
effect cosmic rays X-rays and photo-ionization of C I  all of which are assumed to scale on
the local SFR surface density Their simulations predict LCII  03  1  108 Lcid12 for their
brightest LBGs SFR  30 Mcid12 yr1 which is slightly below the prediction of our integrated
CII  SFR namely about LCII  6  108 Lcid12 Fig 69 Vallini et al 2015 improve on their
2013 model by implementing a density-dependent prescription for the metallicity of the gas
as opposed to a single xed value as well as including the contribution from PDRs in addi-
tion to a previous two-phased CNMWNM model and accounting for the effect of the Cosmic
Microwave Background CMB on the CII luminosity With a cosmological SPH simulation of
mass resolution mSPH  132  105 Mcid12 Vallini et al 2015 predict the CII emission coming
from the ISM of a z  7 galaxy By adopting a range of different SFRs the authors nd that the
CII emission is dominated by the PDRs with  10 coming from the CNM This is qualita-
tively consistent with the results from our simulations at z  2 where the PDR gas dominates
the total CII emission at least at the low SFR end cid46 10 Mcid12 yr1 However our model does
not incorporate the CNM to the same extent as that of Vallini et al 2015 as the PDR gas ex-
pected to contain the CNM of our model is at relatively high densities with distributions that
peak at  100  10 000 cm3 well above typical CNM densities It is therefore reassuring that
Vallini et al 2015 nd the CNM to be an insignicant contributor at least at high-z
The work of Muoz  Furlanetto 2013 also focuses on z  6 galaxies however with the
help of semi-analytical galaxy models adopting different inow models In their study they
consider only the PDRs as contributors to the CII emission and keep the metallicity xed to
solar Zcid48 1 making a comparison to this work difcult However contrary to the extrapola-
tion of our model galaxies at z  2 to high-z Muoz  Furlanetto 2013 arrive at relatively
low CII luminosities compared to high-z observations At the same time the authors overpre-
dict the CO line emission which is taken as a hint of lacking amount of singly ionized carbon
as opposed to CO or H2 in the model galaxies hence demonstrating the force of combining
modeling of atomic and molecular emission
Employing a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation Popping et al 2014a made pre-
dictions of the integrated CII luminosity from galaxies at z  2 with M  108  1012 Mcid12
and SFR  01  100 Mcid12 yr1 see also Popping et al 2014b The galaxies are assumed to
have exponential disk gas density proles with randomly placed over-densities mimicking
GMCs constituting  1 of the total volume The gas is embedded in a background UV ra-
diation eld of 1 Habing with local variations in the radiation eld set to scale with the local
SFR surface density A xed C abundance relative to H2 of 104 is assumed The excitation
of CII occurs via collisions with e H and H2 and the line emission is calculated with a 3D
radiative transfer code that takes into account the kinematics and optical depth effects of the
gas For galaxies with SFRs similar to our model galaxies  5  50 Mcid12 yr1 their simulations
predict ensemble-median CII luminosities of  1  6  107 Lcid124 This is lower than the CII
luminosities predicted by our simulations and also somewhat on the low side of the observed
z  0 LCII  SFR relation Fig 69 Allowing for the 2 deviation from the median of the
Popping et al 2014a models results in LCII  2  30  107 Lcid12 for SFR  5  50 Mcid12 yr1
which matches the observed LCII  SFR relation
68 CONCLUSION
SGAME is a novel numerical framework here manipulated to simulate the CII emission from
galaxies capable of separately tracing the CII emission from the molecular atomic and ion-
ized gas in the ISM The method was applied to SPH simulations of seven star-forming galax-
ies at z  2 with stellar masses in the range  03  5  1010 Mcid12 and star formation rates
 5  60 Mcid12 yr1 in order to make predictions of the CII line emission from main-sequence
galaxies during the peak of the cosmic star formation history
A key result of our simulations is that the total CII emission budget from our galaxies is
dominated by the molecular gas phase  70 in the central regions R  1 kpc where the
bulk of the star formation occurs and is most intense and by PDR regions further out R 
1  2 kpc where the molecular CII emission has dropped by at least an order of magnitude
compared to their central values The atomic partly ionized phase of the PDR regions while
rarely able to produce CII emission as intense as the molecular gas in the central regions is
nonetheless able to maintain signicant levels of CII emission from R  2 kpc all the way out
to  8 kpc from the center The net effect of this is that on global scales the atomic PDR gas can
produce between 8 and 67 of the total CII luminosity with the molecular gas responsible
for the remaining emission We see a trend in which galaxies with higher star formation rates
also have a higher fraction of their total CII luminosity coming from the molecular phase
Our simulations consistently show that the ionized gas contribution to the CII luminosity is
negligible  1 despite the fact that this ISM phase is dominant in terms of mass see Fig
611 This shows that the ionized gas is an inefcient CII line emitter as also underlined by
its low CII values Fig 610
The integrated CII luminosities of our simulated galaxies are found to be higher and fol-
low a steeper LCIISFR relation slope 127017 in better agreement with CII observations
of z  5  6 galaxies with similar SFRs Capak et al 2015 than the relation observed for local
and other high-z galaxies
We have also examined the relationship between the 1 kpc-averaged surface densities of
LCII and SFR across our simulated galaxies The resulting CII  SFR relation spans more
than six orders of magnitude in SFR  105  10 Lcid12 kpc2 extending beyond the observed
ranges at both the low and high end of the relation Over most of this range we nd that the
CIISFR relation is well-described by a power-law ie similar to the observed relation from
4Since Popping et al 2014a plots LCII against LIR and not SFR we have converted our SFRs to LIR in order to
crudely estimate their predicted CII luminosities see their Fig 11 For the SFR  LIR conversion we have used
Bell 2003 Not all the star formation will be obscured and so the IR luminosities and thereby the CII luminosities
given here will be upper limits
local spirals and dwarf galaxies D14 H15 K15 but with a shallower slope 060  002 and a
higher normalization versus from observations
The correlation between CII and SFR  in the integrated as well as the resolved incarnation
 is found to be strongest ie exhibiting the steepest slope for the molecular gas phase We
argue that this is due to the fact that the CII luminosity scales with the amount of molecular
gas present in our simulated galaxies which again is closely related to the amount of star
formation going on For the atomic and ionized gas phases we do not nd a similar scaling
relationship between the CII luminosity and gas mass
Our work therefore supports the notion that for normal star-forming galaxies CII is a bona
de tracer of molecular gas and star formation Furthermore we hypothesize that galaxies in
which a large fraction of the ISM is in the molecular phase and actively forming stars will dis-
play a steeper CII  SFR relationship than galaxies with ISM dominated by atomicionized
gas See the following Outlook chapter for future work that will extend the present study
OUTLOOK
IMPROVEMENTS ON SGAME
The aim of SGAME is to model line emission from the ISM of galaxies at any redshift Such
a code has to be as true as possible to the observations of gas and dust on small and large
scale At high-z and assuming that physical laws do not change in time this turns into a
limitation in how well we can resolve the ISM spatially or spectroscopically sometimes leading
to rather crude assumptions based on what can be observed locally As a recently developed
code SGAME has several such assumptions with room for improvement of which three are
listed below
711 DUST TEMPERATURES WITH A RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODE
With SGAME we have demonstrated a new method that takes into account local FUV elds
and CR intensities in galaxies However our method of scaling these elds to the local SFR
and total stellar mass can be made much more realistic with the inclusion of an actual dust
radiative transfer RT code One such code developed recently is Hyperion1 Robitaille 2011
for which Powderday2 can be used as an interface between Hyperion and galaxy formation
simulations And many alternatives exist as evident from the review by Steinacker et al 2013
Implementing one of these would allow us to self-consistently derive dust temperatures taking
into account anisotropic scattering absorption and re-emission by interstellar dust all based
on the distribution of stars and dust in the galaxy
712 MODELING OF ASYMMETRIC GMCS
At present there exists a gap between simulations of the ISM on galaxy-scales and those on
scales relevant for the formation of individual stars On galaxy-scales simulations are typically
restricted to model star formation using empirical correlations between gas density and star
formation rate However more detailed simulations are emerging following dense gas from
kpc-scales down to  01 pc where star clusters are formed Butler et al 2014 Dobbs 2015
With modications SGAME could be applied to resolved simulations of single star formation
such as those of Vzquez-Semadeni et al 2010 2011 and Dale et al 2013 in order to make
a more precise grid in CO line intensities as a function of more global parameters The move

2httpsbitbucketorgdesikapowderday
from spherically symmetric GMC models towards the clumpy lamentary clouds observed is
an important step forward for SGAME
INCLUDING HEATING BY X-RAYS AND TURBULENT DISSIPATION
Particularly towards the Galactic center observations demand the presence of non-photon
driven heating such as cosmic rays and turbulent dissipation Ao et al 2014 But also in nor-
mal star-forming GMCs turbulent dissipation has been suggested as a cause for most of the
observed excess in CO lines at Jupper  6 Pon et al 2012 2014 In AGNs the circum-nuclear
disks can act like an X-ray Dominated Region XDR and X-ray heating is therefore important
when modeling these central regions eg Aalto et al 2007 Garca-Burillo et al 2010 We have
focused our research projects on normal star-forming galaxies but if SGAME is to work more
generally on starburst and AGNs turbulent dissipation and X-ray heating must be included in
the model
72 GOING TO HIGHER REDSHIFT
721 THE EVOLUTION OF XCO WITH REDSHIFT
Gas mass estimates depend crucially on the dust-to-gas mass ratio or the X-factor XCO At z 
2 SGAME predicts XCO factors about half that of the MW for massive star-forming galaxies
and applying the same method to simulations at higher redshift we could investigate how XCO
changes with redshift Such predictions will be important for future observational campaigns
trying to pin down the evolution of fgas with redshift XCO could also readily be applied to
observations of any CO line if we knew the shape of the CO ladder beforehand Narayanan
 Hopkins 2012 developed a parametrization of the CO ladder with SFR that SGAME can
now improve on by seeing how it changes at z  2 for normal star-forming galaxies
722 THE FULL CALIBRATION TO NORMAL GALAXIES AT z  2
As evident from the study of CO and CII line emission in normal star-forming z  2 galax-
ies we are in need of more observations in particular of the full CO SLED in order to test
models such as SGAME and use them to their fullest I plan to continue my involvement in
the HELLO Herschel Extreme Lensing Line Observations project which takes advantage of
powerful lensing by eg foreground groups of galaxies in order to detect CII line emission
from normal galaxies at z  2 With the high spectral resolution of Herschel kinematic stud-
ies of the line proles are used to estimate rotation speed and gas velocity dispertion Rhoads
et al 2014 Follow-up observations of CO lines with JVLA and ALMA make these galaxies
excellent callibrators for SGAME which itself will help in the interpretation of these future line
observations
723 GALAXIES DURING THE EPOCH OF RE-IONIZATION
In the early universe at redshifts above 7 spectroscopic obervations in the FIR might be our
only way to characterize the modest MS galaxies responsible for most star formation that are
otherwise proving difcult to capture in rest-frame UV with existing spectrographs Observing
and modeling the gas conditions during the Epoch of Re-ionization EoR will enable us to
answer questions such as How did galaxies rst aquire their gas masses When did the gas become
enriched by the rst supernovae What role did the gas play in setting the SFR
Observing with band 7 of ALMA Capak et al 2015 found  3 detections of CII in
a sample of 9 normal SFR  3 to  170 Mcid12 yr1 galaxies at z  5  6 of which only 4
are detected in dust continuum underlining the importance of CII as a tracer of the ISM
at high redshift However many attempts with ALMA and PdBI pointing at z  7 star-
forming MS galaxies for hours have only resulted in upper limits on both CII line emission
and dust continuum Ouchi et al 2013 Maiolino et al 2015 Ota et al 2014 Schaerer et al
2015 Gonzlez-Lpez et al 2014 One preferred explanation is low metallicity because the
galaxies might not have had enough time to enrich the primordial gas with metallicities to a
degree that their line emission is strong enough for detection Ouchi et al 2013 Ota et al
2014 Gonzlez-Lpez et al 2014 Schaerer et al 2015 Another explanation based on recent
simulations is that molecular clouds in these primeval systems are destroyed and dispersed by
strong stellar feedback pushing most of the carbon to higher ionization states Maiolino et al
2015 Vallini et al 2013 A difference in PDR structure or physical states of the ISM between
star-forming galaxies at high-redshift and local ones might also be enough to explain the low
luminosity in CII and FIR Ota et al 2014
Interestingly Maiolino et al 2015 detect a
strong 7 CII signal from a position which
is offset from the actual galaxy BDF3299 at
z  7109 as shown in Fig 71 This is in-
terpreted as an accretingsatellite gas clump
of neutral gas about 4 kpc from the galaxy
itself At slightly higher redshift Watson
et al 2015 managed to detect dust contin-
uum emission from the galaxy A1689-zD1 of
SFR 10 Mcid12 yr1 Such observations nourish
the hope that we are but few spdf away from
using CII observations to charaterise the gas
in normal galaxies andor the mass assembly
from the Circumgalactic Medium CGM in the
early universe

Green contours show the levels of 2 3 and 4 times the
noise per beam in the CII map The detected clump

With this motivation I have recently made
preliminary attempts at simulating CII emis-
sion from halos at high redshift in collabora-
tion with Kristian Finlator here at the Dark
Cosmology Centre As a simple test we
adopted a NFW prole for the radial halo den-
sity prole and since little is known about the
metal abundance at these redshifts assumed
three values for the abundance of carbon going from pessimistic to optimistic Zcid48
1045 104 1035 The resulting rough estimate of CII luminosity as a function of halo
mass at z  6 is shown in Fig 72 together with a surface brightness map for a halo mass of
5  109 Mcid12 With the use of actual cosmological simulations rather than simple spherically
symmetric halo models or constant metallicity and temperature we can make much more pre-
cise predictions for the detectability of the CGM

The AGN-galaxy co-evolution at
z  2
HOW TO DETECT AN AGN
A general concern when estimating the SFR by tting the broadband SED of a galaxy with
stellar population synthesis models is the relative dominance of AGN versus star formation
The dominant contributor to the mid-infrared MIR light is from UV-light reprocessed by dust
but the UV light can be emitted by either young stars or an AGN At z  2 it is not clear without
the aid of high spatial and spectral resolution what is causing the observed MIR emission from
massive galaxies is dust in the central regions being heated by AGN activity is dust across a
larger region of the galaxy being heated by star formation or is a combination of the two
scenarios taking place
X-ray emission on the other hand does not suffer from strong dust obscuration Observing
in X-ray can thus lift the apparent degeneracy in interpreting the origin of the MIR light and
thereby help to give the true AGN fraction of a sample of galaxies A galaxy dominated by
AGN activity can be distinguished from a galaxy dominated by star formation by having a
harder X-ray spectrum if the AGN is obscured by dust or by simply having a very high X-
ray luminosity L05-8 keV The most heavily obscured Compton-thick AGNs with column
densities NH  1024 cm2 might be missed by X-ray selection but can instead be identied via
an excess of MIR emission over that expected from purely star-forming galaxies eg Daddi
et al 2007 Treister et al 2009
The shape of the MIR spectrum can also reveal AGNs as the intense nuclear emission re-
emitted by dust leads to a power-law spectrum in the MIR For this purpose color cuts have
been devised using the Spitzer data eg Stern et al 2005 Donley et al 2012 While this
technique has the capability of detecting even Compton-thick AGNs otherwise missed in X-
ray it has a low efciency for low- to moderate-luminosity AGNs and its robustness has yet to
be veried at z cid38 2 Cardamone et al 2008
In a galaxy where star formation is dominant the total hard band X-ray luminosity L2-10 keV
can be used to estimate the SFR eg Grimm et al 2003 Ranalli et al 2003 Lehmer et al
2010 An AGN will reveal itself if the X-ray SFR inferred this way is much larger than the
SFR derived from other tracers such as H UV or MIR luminosity Also if star formation
dominates the radiation output the Lx  SFR conversion will give an upper limit on the SFR
as has been obtained for sub-mm galaxies Laird et al 2010 and for massive star-forming
galaxies at 12  z  32 Kurczynski et al 2012
At redshifts around 2 high-ionization lines in the rest-frame UV can be used as AGN in-
dicators but X-ray observations remain a more efcient way of identifying AGNs Lamareille
81 DISSECTING THE X-RAY EMISSION FROM AN AGN
I will focus this section on X-ray emission generated by the accretion of matter onto a SMBH
as described in Section 131 since it is this characteristic that I use for detecting AGN in my
study of the presence of AGN at high-z Part II
Fig 81 shows the X-ray part of the SED of a type I AGN together with individual contri-
butions from its components the nature of which is elaborated on below

component green Compton hump and a soft excess cyan Also shown is iron K emission  the most relevant
narrow feature red arising in the inner parts of the accretion disk Figure from the review by Risaliti  Elvis 2004
At high X-ray energies  30 keV the SED is dominated by reection component Comp-
ton hump consisting of primary emission from the accretion disk being scattered by ionized
gas ie electrons This component will be largest if the reector is Compton-thick but smaller
in the Compton-thin case in which case some of the incident radiation escapes without interac-
tion Risaliti  Elvis 2004 An additional hard component is sometimes present most likely
caused by inverse-Compton scattering of the radio-synchroton photons off of electrons in the
relaticistic jet itself At lower energies cid46 2 keV with an almost universal effective tempera-
ture of  01  02 keV a soft excess is often observed but less understood Models suggest
that the strongest soft excesses are found in AGNs with low mass accretion rates Done et al
2012 and typically atomic processes are invoked to explain the soft excess via either ionized
reectioni with light bending or the remaining part of a high-energy power law subject to ion-
ized absorption Vasudevan et al 2014 But also comptonization models have been proposed
in which the soft excess consists of UVsoft-X-ray photons by a population of hot electrons
Matt et al 2014 The joint NuSTARXMM program as well as future X-ray missions such as
ASTRO-H and ASTROSAT to be launched this year are likely to break the degeneracy be-
tween these models see Section 15 Finally a warm ionized absorber exists that reects the
incident continuum without changing its spectral shape
To rst order though the intrinsic or primary emission from the central engine is a power
law extending from 1 to 100 keV with the slope determined by the different components de-
scribed The slope of the power law can be used to determine the amount of obscuration in the
AGN as more obscuration will result in a steeper power law harder In order to estimate the
column density of obscuring material one has to take a guess at the spectral slope  of the

The high angular resolution  05 of Chandra combined with the high sensitivity in the
deep elds CDF-N and CDF-S see Section 14 makes these elds advategous for searches of
AGN at low and high redshift Bauer et al 2004 Xue et al 2011 Treister et al 2009 Alexander
et al 2011 For those studies the observed X-ray spectra of Chandra are typically divided into
a full 05  8 keV a soft 05  2 keV and a hard 2  8 keV band A proxy for the powerlaw
slope is the hardness ratio HR dened as
HR  H  SH  S
where H and S are the counts in hard and soft band respectively Hardness ratio has the advan-
tage in comparison to  of avoiding any assumptions regarding the shape of the spectrum
Assuming an intrinsic obscured power law with   19 HR converts into a column density
that increases with the hardness of the spectrum as shown in the right-hand plot of Fig 83

The criteria for nding an AGN are a high full-band X-ray luminosity cid38 2  1042 ergss of a
hard spectrum with HR  02 for sources of lower luminosity These criteria are meant to rule
out galaxies with SEDs consisten with star formation processes only However a third possible
origin of a bright X-ray component in the area-integrated SED is a hot gas halo embracing the
galaxy Mulchaey  Jeltema 2010 Souch a component can be ruled out if the observed X-ray
source is predominantly point-like rather than extended
811 THE AGN FRACTION AT z cid38 2 FROM OBSERVATIONS IN X-RAY
Several studies of massive z  2 galaxies have been made with the aim of uncovering AGN
fractions using the Chandra X-ray observatory Rubin et al 2004 performed a study of 40
massive M  1-5  1011Mcid12 red Js  Ks  23 galaxies at z cid38 2 by analyzing a 91 ks
Chandra exposure Roughly 5 of these were found to host an AGN with intrinsic L2-10 keV 
121043 erg s1 Assuming that the stacked X-ray signal from the remaining X-ray undetected
galaxies in X-ray comes from star formation alone they derived a mean SFR broadly consistent
with the typical mean SFRs estimated from SED ts Alexander et al 2011 analyzed the 4Ms
Chandra observations of 222 z  2 star-forming BzK galaxies M  1010-1011Mcid12 Daddi et al
2007 in the Chandra Deep Field-South CDF-S 1023 showed X-ray emission consistent
with AGN dominance of which 511 were found to contain heavily obscured AGNs 49
to have luminous unobscured AGNs and 3 out of 27 low-luminosity systems showed excess
variability over that expected from star formation processes indicating that at least some low-
luminosity rest-frame L2-10keV  1043 erg s1 systems may contain AGNs

PAPER III
91 AIM OF THIS PROJECT
The aim of this project was to determine the AGN fraction in massive z  2 galaxies and reveal
any differences between quiescent and star-forming galaxies
92 OUR METHOD AND GALAXY SAMPLE
We addressed the matter by analyzing the X-ray emission from a mass-complete M  5 
1010Mcid12 sample of 15  z  25 galaxies residing in the CDF-S The CDF-S observed for 4 Ms
is currently the deepest X-ray view of the universe and so provides the best opportunity to
study high-z galaxies across a relatively large area 4645 arcmin2
We selected our galaxies from the FIREWORKS1 catalog Wuyts et al 2008 which covers
a eld situated within the CDF-S and contains photometry in 17 bands from the U band to
the MIR For this study we extracted a mass-complete sample of M  5  1010Mcid12 galaxies
at 15  z  25 in a way similar to that of Franx et al 2008 and Toft et al 2009 We used
spectroscopic redshifts when available Vanzella et al 2008 Xue et al 2011 and photometric
redshifts from the FIREWORKS catalog otherwise In order to maximize the signal-to-noise
SN on results from X-ray stacking Zheng et al 2012 and ensure a relatively homogeneous
PSF across the Chandra eld employed we considered only galaxies that lie within 6 of the
average Chandra aimpoint
We adopted galaxy stellar masses from the SED tting results of Franx et al 2008 and Toft
et al 2009 In short the SED ts were carried out with models by Bruzual  Charlot 2003
choosing the best t from adopting three different star formation histories a single stellar pop-
ulation with no dust an exponentially declining star formation history of timescale 300 Myr
with dust and a constant star formation history with dust In cases where the spectroscopic
redshift differed by more than 01 from the original FIREWORKS photometric redshift we re-
did the SED ts in FAST2 using an exponentially declining star formation history with a range
of possible timescales from 10 Myr to  1 Gyr As a quality parameter of the SED modeling
we demanded an upper limit on the reduced 2
 of 10 on the best-t model The SED ts pro-

vide SFR estimates but we used SFRs derived from rest-frame UVIR luminosities see Section
923 as these include obscured star formation and are subject to less assumptions From the
observed photometry rest-frame uxes in U V  J band and at 2800  have been derived using
InterRest3 Taylor et al 2009
We divided the resulting sample of 123 galaxies into quiescent and star-forming galaxies
using the rest-frame U V and J falling roughly into the observed J K and IRAC 45 m
bands at z  2 colors Dust-free but quiescent galaxies differ from dust-obscured starburst
galaxies in that they obey the following criteria by Williams et al 2009
U  V  13
V  J  16
U  V   088  V  J  049
The fraction of quiescent galaxies identied within our sample using this method is 22 
527123 This is rather low compared to the 3050 found by Toft et al 2009 for the
same redshift and mass limit but under the requirement that the sSFR SFRM from SED
tting is less than 003 Gyr1 If applying this criterion we would have arrived at a fraction
of 42  751123 A possible reason for the discrepancy between the two methods may be
that we were using the U V J criterion in the limits of the redshift range in which it has so far
been established As the redshift approaches 2 the quiescent population moves to bluer U  V
colors possibly crossing the boundaries of Equation 93 However we preferred the U V J
selection technique in contrast to a cut in sSFR because rest-frame colors are more robustly
determined than star formation rates from SED ts
921 X-RAY DATA AND STACKING ANALYSIS
The raw X-ray data from the CDF-S survey consist of 54 individual observations taken be-
tween 1999 October and 2010 July We build our analysis on the work of Xue et al 2011 who
combined the observations and reprojected all images They did so in observed full band 05
8 keV soft band 052 keV and hard band 28 keV and the resulting images and exposure
maps are publicly available4
We extracted source and background count rates in the X-ray maps for all galaxies using the
method of Cowie et al 2012 Source counts were determined within a circular aperture of
xed radii 075 and 125 at off-axis angles of   3 and   3 respectively Background
counts were estimated within an annulus 822 from the source excluding nearby X-ray
sources from the catalog of Xue et al 2011
Each galaxy was classied as X-ray detected if detected in at least one band at  3 sig-
nicance thereby creating 4 subsamples containing 8 quiescent and detected 19 quiescent and
undetected 43 star-forming and detected and 53 star-forming and undetected galaxies
While the X-ray detected galaxies could be analyzed individually we stacked the X-ray
non-detected galaxies in order to constrain the typical X-ray ux from these Stacked X-ray
images of the 4 subsamples are shown in Figure 91 with all galaxies aligned to their Ks band
galaxy center positions from FIREWORKS Representative count rates and associated errors
for these stacks were calculated using the optimally weighted mean procedure of Cowie et al

We quantied the hardness of the X-ray spectra using the hardness ratio see eq 82 As-
suming a power-law spectrum we also derived a photon index  with the online mission
count rate simulator WebPIMMS5 using a Galactic H 1 column density of 881019 cm2 Stark
et al 1992 and not including intrinsic absorption Whenever the SN in either soft or hard
band was below 2 we used the corresponding 2 upper limit on the count rate to calculate a
limit on both HR and  leading to a limit on the luminosity as well When neither a hard- nor
a soft-band ux was detected with an SN above 2 a typical faint source value of   14 Xue
et al 2011 was assumed corresponding to HR 03 for an intrinsic powerlaw spectrum of
  19 Wang et al 2004
We derived the unabsorbed ux from the count rate by again using the WebPIMMS tool
now with the  tied to the observed value of either the individually detected galaxy or the stack
in question With this method a count rate of  105 counts s1 corresponds to a ux of nearly
1016 erg cm2 s1 in full band at a typical value of   08 Finally the ux was converted
into luminosity in the desired rest-frame bands using XSPEC version 1207 Arnaud 1996
922 LUMINOUS AGN IDENTIFICATION
In the top panel of Figure 92 are shown the rest-frame X-ray full band luminosities L058 keV
not corrected for intrinsic absorption versus observed hardness ratio HR for all X-ray detected
galaxies as well as stacked non-detections A typical detection limit on L058 keV has been indi-
cated with a dotted line in Figure 92 calculated as two times the background noise averaged
over all source positions A few detected galaxies were found below this limit due to these re-
siding at relatively low z andor in regions of lower-than-average background Galaxies with
L058 keV  3  1042 erg s1 were selected as luminous AGN since star-forming galaxies are
rarely found at these luminosities Bauer et al 2004 In addition we adopted the HR criteria
in Table 92 in order to identify obscured and unobscured AGNs
About 532751 of the X-ray detected galaxies were identied as luminous AGNs with
22 moderately to heavily obscured 02  HR  08 and 5 unobscured HR  02 AGNs
5httpheasarcnasagovToolsw3pimmshtml
The rest had X-ray emission consistent with either low-luminosity AGNs or star formation We
did not identify any Compton-thick AGNs directly but three galaxies had lower limits on their
hardness ratios just below HR  08 thus potentially consistent with Compton-thick emission
see Table 92 In total we detected a luminous AGN fraction of 22  527123 a fraction
which is 23  52296 for the star-forming and 19  9527 for the quiescent galaxies
Stacking the non-detections resulted in average X-ray source properties that exclude high
luminosity AGNs However the inferred limits on their HR were consistent with a contribution
from low-luminosity AGNs the importance of which cannot be determined from this plot
923 X-RAY INFERRED SFR
From the rest-frame hard band luminosity L210 keV it is possible to derive estimates of the SFR
as the number of high-mass X-ray binaries HMXBs is proportional to the SFR Ranalli et al
2003 Kurczynski et al 2012 made a comparison of different SFR indicators by applying three
different Lx  SFR conversions to 510 star-forming BzK galaxies at 12  z  32 selected as
having L210 keV  1043 erg s1 While relations by Persic et al 2004 and Lehmer et al 2010
overestimated the true SFR from rest-frame UV and IR light by a factor of  5 the relation
by Ranalli et al 2003 provided a good agreement at 15  z  32 But as pointed out by
Kurczynski et al 2012 all relations might lead to an overestimation due to contamination by
obscured AGNs in the sample of SF galaxies As we did not know the exact amount of obscured
AGN contamination in the stacks we chose to use the following relation by Ranalli et al 2003
as a conservative estimate of the SFR
SFR210 keV  20  1040 L210 keV
with SFR measured in Mcid12 yr1 and L210 keV in erg s1 Another reason for not using the more
recent relation by Lehmer et al 2010 is that this relation was constructed for galaxies with SFR
 9 Mcid12 yr1 only whereas a large part of our sample had very low SFRs as inferred from SED
tting  1 Mcid12 yr1 Following Kurczynski et al 2012 we used the observed soft band ux
to probe the rest-frame hard band luminosity The uncertainty on the SFR is estimated from
the error on the observed soft-band ux together with a systematic error in the relation itself of
029 dex as given by Ranalli et al 2003
For comparison the true SFR is inferred from rest-frame UV and IR light SFRUVIR fol-
lowing the method of Papovich et al 2006
SFRUVIR  18  1010LIR  33L2800Lcid12
where LIR is the total infrared luminosity and L2800 is the monochromatic luminosity at rest-
frame 2800  L2800 comes from the rest-frame UV ux f2800 and in this context the errors
on f2800 are negligible We derived LIR from the observed 24 m ux f24m using redshift-
dependent multiplicative factors az from the work of Wuyts et al 2008 Section 82 in that
paper
LIRLcid1281000m  10az  f24m
The errorbars on LIR derive from the errors on f24m and we further assume an uncertainty

of 03 dex in the relation of Papovich et al 2006 as found by Bell 2003 when comparing to

SN  3 in 24 m either except in one case leading to a mean ux of 12 17Jy of which we
adopted a 2 upper limit for the remaining analysis
In the bottom panel of Figure 92 SFR210 keV is compared to SFRUVIR with the dashed line
indicating equality It is no surprise that nearly all of the individual X-ray detections have very
high SFR210 keV as compared to SFRUVIR as we were largely insensitive to individual purely
star-forming galaxies given the detection limits in the top panel of Figure 92 and the criteria
in Table 92
For the star-forming stack the X-ray inferred SFR of 71  51Mcid12 yr1 is consistent with the
IRUV inferred SFR of 46  33Mcid12 yr1 whereas the quiescent stack shows an SFR210 keV of

93 AN OVERWHELMINGLY LARGE AGN POPULATION

In total 22 X-ray detected galaxies have emission consistent with containing a luminous rest-
frame L058keV  3  1042 erg s1 and obscured 1022  NH  1024 cm2 AGN and a further
ve have emission consistent with a luminous unobscured NH  1022 cm2 AGN This leads
to a luminous AGN fraction of the full sample of 22527123 and of the detected galaxies
only 53  132751 The AGN fraction among both quiescent and star-forming galaxies
according to their X-ray spectra is measured to be around 20 as Table 93 shows meaning
that AGNs in massive z  2 galaxies even quiescent ones are common as proposed by Kriek
et al 2009 who studied the near-IR spectrum of one quiescent galaxy

Table 93 X-Ray derived AGN Numbers and Fractions for Quiescent and Star-forming Galaxies
Divided into Luminous AGNs and Detected and Non-detected Low-luminosity AGNs
This luminous AGN fraction is high when compared to the 5 found by Rubin et al 2004
see the introduction but this is likely a consequence of their 4 detection limit of 12 
1043 erg s1 in rest-frame 210 keV being about twice as high as our limit of 551042 erg s1 at
  14 as calculated from the average background noise in the observed soft band Adopting
the detection limit of Rubin et al 2004 and requiring an SN of at least 4 we reduce our frac-
tion of luminous AGN to 8  310123 consistent with the results of Rubin et al 2004
Alexander et al 2011 using also the 4 Ms CDF-S data found a much lower X-ray detection
fraction of 21  3 as compared to ours 53  7 and a luminous AGN fraction of only
9 220222 We believe that the discrepancies have several reasons the main ones being
1 our use of a mass-complete sample whereas the BzK selection technique used by Alexan-
der et al 2011 includes galaxies down to M  1010Mcid12 for which the total AGN fraction
assuming a xed Eddington ratio is expected to be lower above our detection limit6 2 our
updated source count extraction and stacking method leading to higher SN and 3 the use
of  instead of HR in the AGN identication conducted by Alexander et al 2011 For com-
parison Tanaka et al 2012 recently discovered a group of quiescent galaxies at z  16 with
only one main-sequence star-forming galaxy This group differed from local groups in having a
remarkably high AGN fraction of 382320 consistent with our result and which they interpret
as possible evidence for AGN activity quenching star formation
IMPORTANCE OF LOW-LUMINOSITY AGNS
As seen in Figure 92 the X-ray-identied luminous AGNs in general show an excess in SFR
compared to that inferred from IRUV emission Among the galaxies classied as being dom-
inated by either low-luminosity AGN or star formation about  902124 have SFR210 keV
more than 1 above SFRUVIR
Surprisingly the quiescent stack also has a much larger SFR210 keV than SFRIRUV Even
when removing the marginally undetected galaxies with 2 SN 3 the resulting SFR210 keV 
62  19Mcid12 yr1 is still more than 3 above SFRIRUV This discrepancy is only further aggra-
vated if instead assuming the SFRLX relation of Lehmer et al 2010 If caused by obscured
star formation we would have expected an average 24 m ux of 90 Jy for the individual
galaxies in order to match the lower limit on SFR210 keV This is far above the upper limit of
34 Jy for the stack suggesting that the X-ray ux of this stack is instead dominated by low-
luminosity AGNs but that their contribution to the 24 m ux remains undetectable in the
SpitzerMIPS data
We derived a lower limit on the low-luminosity AGN contribution for this stack of 19 objects
by constructing a mock sample of the same size and with the same redshifts but containing N
low-luminosity AGNs with luminosities L058 keV  1042 erg s1 just below the detection limit
and 19  N galaxies with L058 keV  1041 erg s1 all of them with   14 From random
realizations of this mock sample we found that at least N  12 low-luminosity AGNs are re-
quired to match the observed rest-frame 210 keV luminosity of the stack Similarly we found
that by removing at least 12 randomly selected galaxies it is possible to match the low SFR pre-
dicted by IRUV emission though only with a small probability  1 of 200 bootstrappings
We therefore adopted 63 1219 as a conservative lower limit on the low-luminosity AGN
fraction among quiescent X-ray non-detections but we note that the data were consistent with
all the quiescent galaxies hosting low-luminosity AGNs if the luminosity of these was assumed
to be only L058 keV  7  1041 erg s1
Interestingly the quiescent stack was only detected in the soft band cf Table 91 whereas
one might expect a signicant contribution to the hard band ux from a low-luminosity AGN
population as the one proposed above The lack of a hard band detection can be explained by
the fact that the sensitivity of the CDF-S observations drops about a factor of six from the soft
to the hard band Xue et al 2011 meaning that the low-luminosity AGN population must
be relatively unobscured   1 consistent with the value of 14 assumed here as it would
otherwise have been detected in the hard band with an SN  2
The SFR210 keV of the star-forming stack was consistent with its SFRUVIR meaning that a
strict lower limit to the low-luminosity AGN fraction here is zero However performing the
6For a xed Eddington ratio and assuming that galaxy bulge mass increases with total stellar mass the AGN X-ray
luminosity is expected to scale with galaxy stellar mass according to the MbhMbulge relation Hring  Rix 2004
test above with the same model parameters a maximum of 402153 low-luminosity AGNs
is possible before the X-ray inferred SFR exceeds the upper limit on SFRUVIR
It should be mentioned that the 24 m ux especially at these high redshifts is an uncer-
tain estimator of the total rest-frame infrared luminosity ie the entire dust peak used in the
conversion to SFR As shown by Bell 2003 one should ideally use the entire 81000 m range
eg by taking advantage of Herschel data which can lead to systematic downward correction
factors up to  25 for galaxies with LIR  1011Lcid12 similar to the inferred IR luminosities of
our sample galaxies detected in 24 m showing a median of LIR  10115Lcid12 as demonstrated
by Elbaz et al 2010 However using the same conversion from f24m to LIR as the one imple-
mented in this study Wuyts et al 2011 showed that the resulting LIR for galaxies out to z  3
are consistent with those derived from PACS photometry with a scatter of 025 dex Hence we
do not expect the inclusion of Herschel photometry in the this study to signicantly impact any
of our results and we leave any such analysis for future work
Table 93 gives an overview of the derived AGN fractions both at high and low X-ray lumi-
nosity Adding the numbers of luminous AGN X-ray-detected low-luminosity AGNs as well
as the estimated lower limit on the low-luminosity AGN fraction among non-detections we
arrive at a lower limit on the total AGN fraction of
fAGN  27  21  06  19  0  53
for all massive galaxies at z  2 While for the star-forming galaxies this fraction lies in the
range from 4365 it must be 70 and potentially 100 for the quiescent galaxies Using
the upper limits on these numbers a tentative upper limit on the total AGN fraction is 072
933 CONTRIBUTION FROM HOT GAS HALOS
We have so far considered star formation and AGN activity as causes of the X-ray emission
observed but a third possibility is an extended hot gas halo as seen around many nearby early-
type galaxies in the same mass-range as our sample galaxies Mulchaey  Jeltema 2010 and
predictedobserved around similar spirals Toft et al 2002 Rasmussen et al 2009 Anderson
 Bregman 2011 Dai et al 2012 AGN X-ray emission is expected to come from a very small
R  1 pc accretion disk surrounding the central black hole of the host galaxy Lobanov  Zen-
sus 2007 whereas very extended star formation in the galaxy or a hot gas halo surrounding it
would lead to more extended emission We investigated the possibilities for these latter cases
by comparing radial surface brightness proles of the 51 individually X-ray detected galaxies
out to a radius of 8 in both the stacked observed image and a correspondingly stacked PSF
The proles were calculated in full band only because of the high SN here as compared to
the other bands cf Figure 91 For each galaxy we extracted the background subtracted source
count per pixel within 10 concentric rings of width 08 around the galaxy center positions from
the FIREWORKS catalog and each prole was normalized to the mean count rate in all rings
The same procedure was applied to the corresponding PSF images extracted with the library
and tools that come with CIAO7 allowing for extraction at the exact source positions on the
detector We veried the robustness of using PSF models from the CIAO calibration database

Figure 93 Comparison of the radial surface brightness proles in PSF images vs observed images in full band for
all detected galaxies Black stacked observed image centered on K-band positions from FIREWORKS for all detected
galaxies solid line and if excluding the three X-ray brightest sources dashed line Grey line stacked PSF image
Red stack of halo model images with   05 Rc  25 kpc dashed and   1 Rc  1 kpc dot-dashed
for this purpose by repeating the above procedure for 51 known X-ray bright point-like sources
from the catalog of Xue et al 2011 and conrming that the resulting mean prole was fully
consistent with that of the corresponding model PSFs
As can be observed in Figure 93 the combined radial prole of our X-ray detected galaxies
in the full band is consistent with the PSF of point sources stacked at the same detector loca-
tions A Kolmogorov-Smirnov K-S test yields a statistic of 02 and allow us to rule out the
null hypothesis that the two proles were drawn from the same parent sample with a p value
of 09996
Omitting the three sources with L058 keV  1044 erg s1 cf Figure 92 leads to a more
extended prole dashed black line in Figure 93 but the result still shows a high correspond-
ing K-S probability of 70 We also compared the proles while recentering the images on the
center of the X-ray emission as derived using WAVDETECT8 instead of the K-band center po-
sitions listed in the FIREWORKS catalog in order to test for the impact of any off-set between
the X-ray and optical centroids However the recentering only resulted in small variations
within the errorbars on the original prole The same conclusions applied to the subsample of
X-ray detected star-forming galaxies only whereas the SN was too low to perform a similar
study on the quiescent X-ray detected sample alone
For comparison we also simulated the stacked prole of extended hot gas halos using
for the surface brightness prole the -model rst introduced by Cavaliere  Fusco-Femiano
1976 With default parameters of   05 and core radius Rc  25 kpc both taken from
the study of z cid46 005 early-type galaxies by OSullivan et al 2003 the stacked prole of the
halos convolved with the corresponding PSFs is well outside the errorbars of the measured
8WAVDETECT is part of the CIAO software
prole Only if assuming an extremely compact case of   1 and Rc  1 kpc does the halo
emission become sufciently compact to mimic that of the PSF prole see dash-dotted line
in Figure 93 but the halo model then overpredicts the observed surface brightness on scales
smaller than 1 In conclusion a hot gas halo alone described by a -model cannot explain the
emission unless one chooses model parameters that render the prole indistinguishable from
a point-like source
934 QUENCHING OF STAR FORMATION BY AGNS
It remains debated whether the presence of AGN is connected with internal galaxy properties
associated with secular evolution or to a higher degree with external processes Darg et al
2010 For example the cosmic star formation rate density and the number density of AGN
share a common growth history with a peak in activity around z  23 Treister  Urry 2012
Dunlop 2011 hinting at a co-evolution between SFR and supermassive black hole SMBH
accretion Schawinski 2011 We investigated the correlation if any between the presence
of AGNs and internalexternal processes treating luminous and low-luminosity AGNs sepa-
rately As typical internal properties governing secular evolution we focused on stellar mass
M and SFR Peng et al 2010 while major mergers were taken as a likely case of external
processes and as a phenomenon often associated with luminous AGNs Treister et al 2012
Starting with our X-ray identied luminous AGNs we found that the fraction of these does
not correlate with star formation in our sample cf Table 93 In addition the distribution
of luminous AGNs and that of the rest with regards to their SFRIRUV are similar with a K-S
test yielding a statistic of 021 with a probability of 59 Similarly Harrison et al 2012 found
no correlation between AGN luminosity and quenching of star formation albeit at a higher
luminosity L28 keV  1044erg s1 than probed here Dividing the sample according to M
instead by constructing two bins around the median mass of 11  1011 Mcid12 we arrived at
similar luminous AGN fractions above and below this mass limit namely 21  71361
and 23  71462 respectively We thus nd no clear evidence for the luminous AGN
fraction of our sample to correlate with internal properties suggesting that an external factor
is of larger importance
An alternative is that luminous AGNs are primarily triggered by non-secular processes
such as major mergers Treister et al 2012 found that major mergers are the only processes
capable of triggering luminous Lbol cid38 1045 erg s1 AGN at 0  z  3 Our luminous AGN
fraction is consistent with the major merger fraction of massive M  1011Mcid12 galaxies at
17  z  3 found by Man et al 2012 to be 15  8 compared to a luminous AGN fraction
of 11  313123 when excluding galaxies with M  1011Mcid12 This is consistent with the
idea that our luminous AGNs are triggered by major mergers but a more direct test of this
scenario would be to search for major mergers using the imaging data available in CDF-S In-
deed Newman et al 2012 used HST CANDELS imaging in the GOODS-South eld residing
within CDF-S along with the UKIRT Ultra Deep Survey to arrive at roughly equal pair frac-
tions when comparing massive M  10107Mcid12 quiescent to massive star-forming galaxies at
04  z  2 Again this is in agreement with our result that the luminous AGN fraction does
not vary between quiescent and star-forming galaxies A detailed morphological study of our
X-ray identied luminous AGN using the HSTWFC3 data to search for evidence of merging
is an interesting extension to the work presented here which we leave for a future study
Turning toward our low-luminosity AGNs we do see X-ray evidence for an enhanced pop-
ulation among the quiescent galaxies when compared to their star-forming equivalents The
mean masses of our non-detected samples of quiescent and star-forming galaxies are similar
146  16 and 127  10  1010 Mcid12 respectively suggesting that the relevant factor here is
SFR At 001  z  007 Schawinski et al 2009 found that massive M cid38 1010Mcid12 host
galaxies of low-luminosity AGNs all lie in the green valley that is at some intermediate state
after star formation quenching has taken place and before the SED is truly dominated by old
stellar populations The observation that these host galaxies had been quiescent for  100 Myr
ruled out the possibility that one short-lived luminous AGN suppressed star formation and
at the same time made it unlikely that the same AGN quenching star formation was still ac-
tive given current AGN lifetime estimates of  107108 yr Di Matteo et al 2005 Rather the
authors favored a scenario in which a low-luminosity AGN already shut down star formation
followed by a rise in luminosity making the AGN detectable At z  2 SED ts of massive
M  1011Mcid12 quiescent galaxies show that the quenching typically took place  1 Gyr before
the time of observation Toft et al 2012 Krogager J-K et al in preparation demanding an
even longer delay or an episodic AGN activity as frequently applied in models Croton et al
2006 Episodic AGN activity could explain why we see evidence for a higher low-luminosity
AGN fraction among quiescent as compared to star-forming galaxies but it would also require
the low-luminosity AGN phase in quiescent galaxies to last at least as long as the dormant
phase Future modeling and observations will show whether this is in fact possible
We conclude that our data are consistent with a scenario in which luminous AGNs in mas-
sive galaxies at z  2 are connected with major mergers or other non-secular processes while
the presence of low-luminosity AGNs in the majority of quiescent galaxies suggests that these
AGNs present an important mechanism for quenching star formation and keeping it at a low
level Ultimately what happens at z  2 has to agree with the subsequent evolution that
changes size and morphology of quiescent galaxies Barro et al 2013
94 CONCLUSIONS
Our main conclusions are on the following two topics
1 Luminous AGN fraction
We nd a luminous AGN fraction of 225 among massive M  51010Mcid12 galaxies
at redshifts 15  z  25 using their X-ray properties extracted from the 4 Ms Chandra
Deep Field South observations Among the X-ray detected galaxies 53  13 harbor
high-luminosity AGNs while stacking the galaxies not detected in X-ray leads to mean
detections consistent with low-luminosity AGNs or pure star formation processes The
luminous AGN fraction among quiescent and star-forming galaxies is similar 19  9
and 23  5 respectively and does not depend on galaxy M
We conrmed that extended X-ray emission from a hot gaseous halo is not a viable ex-
planation for the observed X-ray emission of the X-ray detected galaxies
2 Limits on total AGN fraction
We convert the rest-frame hard band X-ray luminosity into an upper limit on the star
formation rate SFR210 keV and compare to that derived from the rest-frame IRUV emis-
sion SFRIRUV All luminous AGNs show an excess in SFR210 keV as expected and so
does a large fraction  90 of the remaining detected galaxies While the star-forming
galaxies not detected in X-ray have a mean X-ray inferred SFR of 71 51Mcid12 yr1 consis-
tent with their SFRIRUV the stack of quiescent galaxies shows an excess in SFR210 keV of
a factor  10 above the upper limit on SFRIRUV For these galaxies we nd that a mini-
mum fraction of  60 must contain low-luminosity L058 keV  1042 erg s1 AGNs if
the SFR estimates from X-ray are to be explained and that low-luminosity AGNs might
be present in all of them On the other hand for the star-forming stack we derive a low-
luminosity AGN fraction of 040
Gathering all low- and high-luminosity AGNs we derive a lower limit to the total AGN
fraction of 48 with a tentative upper limit of 72
Our study was the rst to present observational evidence that at z  2 the majority of qui-
escent galaxies host a low- to a high-luminosity AGN while the AGN fraction is signicantly
lower in star-forming galaxies These ndings are consistent with an evolutionary scenario in
which low-luminosity AGN quench star formation via the energetic output from SMBH accre-
tion which if believed to continue in an episodic fashion as often invoked by models would
need to have dormant phases at least as long as active phases
We nd that the high-luminosity AGNs are likely related to non-secular processes such as
major mergers In the future examining the X-ray properties of galaxies in a larger sample
cross-correlated with signs of major mergers may shed further light on the co-evolution of
AGNs and host galaxy
OUTLOOK
Since we published these results in 2013 many additional observational studies have been
carried out with the aim of shedding light on AGN-galaxy co-evolution at z  2 A short
summary is provided here together with future directions in this eld
101 THE AGN-MORPHOLOGY CONNECTION
First of all we found no clear evidence for a correlation between the presence of a luminous
AGN and the internal properties of massive galaxies at z  2 This was interpreted as an
argument for the need of external factors triggering the luminous AGN phase rather than
events associated with secular evolution However we only considered stellar mass and SFR
whereas more recent observations have established a clear correlation between the presence
and strength of AGN and the morphology of its host galaxy
cid1 below 103 Mcid12 kpc
galaxies cSFGs dened as having logcid0Mr15
In this regard Barro et al 2013 analysed the morphologies and SFRs of M  1010 Mcid12
galaxies at z  14  3 in the GOODS-S and CANDELS UDS elds for comparison with AGN
activity as a function of redshift Barro et al 2013 found a population of compact star-forming
15 at z  26  30 that
dissappears before the compact quiescent galaxies CQGs of similar structural properties ap-
pear at lower redshifts At the same time the AGN fraction among cSFGs is higher at z  2
than at lower redshifts and X-ray luminous L28 keV  1043 erg s1 AGNs are found  30 
more frequently in cSFGs than in non-compact ones at z  2 This was interpreted as a sign
that at least some cSFGs evolve directly into the CQGs observed at z  2 via the evolutionary
path described in Section 215 whereas non-compact quiescent galaxies formed later on are
the result of normal SFGs that are quenched by other mechanisms which partially preserve the
structural properties
Deriving the total IR luminosity directly from the 24 m ux only is a rough approximation
that could possibly affect our results and those of Barro et al 2013 as the possible contribu-
tion from an AGN to the FIR luminosity can lead to overestimates of the SFR Mancini et al
2015 did a more careful estimate of LIR with SpitzerHerschel photometry from 24 m to
250 m of 56 M  1011 Mcid12 galaxies at 14  z  2 in the GOODS-S eld for a better es-
timate of SFRIRUV Dening AGN as those with excess X-ray andor radio VLA 14 GHz
luminosity with respect to the expected SFRIRUV or SFRSED and classifying galaxies as star-
formingquiescent based on sSFR as well as U V J color the authors found relatively high AGN
fractions of  40  10  and  22  7  for star-forming and quiescent galaxies respectively
though fractions very close to ours when adopting the same criteria In agreement with Barro
et al 2013 Mancini et al 2015 also found that the presence of an AGN correlates with com-
pactness as probed by a steep radial surface brightness prole in rest-frame optical Over a
wider redshift range 14  z  3 but with a similar method Rangel et al 2014 concluded that
compact galaxies both quiscent and star-forming display higher intrinsic 2  8 keV luminosi-
ties and levels of obscuration that in extended galaxies
These studies show that of out massive galaxies at z  2 compact ones contain the most powerful
AGN and that when studying quiescentstar-forming galaxy samples across redshift observations seem
to promote a picture in which cSFGs evolve directly into CQGs via a relatively obscured AGN phase
albeit of high absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity
102 DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF AGN FEEDBACK
Direct evidence for the radiative and quasar mode of AGN feedback is now existing for a
few mostly nearby objects see review by Fabian 2012 For example in a study of the UV
absorption line proles of 226 M  1011 Mcid12 galaxies at 1  z  3 Cimatti et al 2013
found possible gas outow velocities of up to  500 km s1 but only in galaxies classied as
luminous AGNs with L28 keV  10423 ergs s1 This indicates that the gas here is moving
faster than the escape velocity of active galaxies resulting in the ejection of part of the ISM
possible decrease in SFR With the X-ray satellite Nustar sensitive to high energy X-rays of
3  79 keV it is also possible to see such outows in X-ray absorption and emission lines as
demonstrated by Nardini et al 2015 Likewise but at high redshift Nesvadba et al 2011
observed evidence for outows of turbulent gas traced by narrow-line emission in the rest-
frame UV and optical of two quasars at z  34 and  39 In addition to observations in
UV AGN feedback has been conrmed with radio and sub-mm observations in particular in
the form of strong molecular outows eg Feruglio et al 2010 Cicone et al 2014 Tombesi
et al 2015 Comparing the mass outow or inow rates of ionized or molecular gas to
the accretion rate to the AGN hints at the effect that these might have on the global SFR as
summarized by eg Bergmann 2012 and Storchi-Bergmann 2014 However more observations
of both jets and outows observationally conrmed in at least some AGNs at redshifts out to almost
z  4 are needed in order to settle how they affect the ISM of their host galaxies as a whole
103 FUTURE DIRECTIONS DISCERNING VARIABILITY WITH
In particular the arrival of new oberving facilities will open up this eld towards high redshift
by studying both individual cases and global properties of large samples
Seeing the strong connection between compactness and AGN activity at high-z as revealed
over recent years this eld will benet tremendously from the arrival of JWST that will en-
able rest-frame optical imaging out to z  10 with 3 times better angular resolution than HST
at 16m Beichman et al 2012 That means being able to see whether AGNs are associ-
ated with compact galaxies all the way out to Epoch of Re-ionization EoR With the high
NIR spectral resolution of JWST the absence of poly-aromatic hydrocarbon PAH emission
at  6  11 m can also be used to select possibile AGN candidates without the need of X-
ray observations Windhorst et al 2009 Hanami et al 2011 The combined forces of JVLA
JWST and ALMA will also allow detections of molecular outows at high-z by measuring gas
kinematics as traced by molecular and ne structure lines Fabian 2012
Figure 101 Illustration of AGN variability from Hickox et al 2014 who took the Eddington ratio a measure of
BHAR as a function of time from a hydrodynamic simulation presented by Novak et al 2011 bottom Depending
on the time of observation the same galaxy can happen to be in an inactive state or a bright AGN state
A potentially very important factor but not completely revealed in any of the above stud-
ies is time variation As mentioned in Section 934 major mergers at 0  z  3 have been
associated with the most luminous AGNs Treister et al 2012 whereas moderate-luminosity
L05-8 keV  104244 ergs s1 AGNs at z  2 are not associated with disturbed morphologies
indicative of recent mergers any more than non-active galaxies are Kocevski et al 2012 This
said the apparent lack of merger signatures in AGNs cannot rule out a connection between
AGNs and mergers First of all if mergers in the initial phase generally produce obscured
AGNs then these will be harder to detect in X-rays unless one has access to the hard X-rays
that penetrate the obscuring gas better than the soft ones One would then expect moder-
ate AGNs to be primarily observed in post-starburst galaxies in agreement with our stacking
of un-detected X-ray sources that revealed a higher signal from quiescent galaxies than from
SFGs Another exception would be if there exists a time delay between the merger and the
actual onset of the luminous AGN phase With JWST and upcoming X-ray observatories see
Section 15 we can start to piece together the redshift distribution of AGNs and mergerspairs
to look for a possible delay A second time-related issue possibly blurring the observable re-
lationship between AGNs and their hosts is variability of the AGN luminosity as shown in
Fig 101 Models show that when reasonable variability for the AGN luminosity is assumed
the weak correlations between SFR and LAGN can be reproduced even if there is a tight under-
lying correlation between SFR and BHAR Novak et al 2012 Hickox et al 2014
In conclusion new observatories can explore the presence of AGNs at z  2 with particu-
lar focus on compactness jets and inoutows that are crucial for the overall SFR of the host
galaxy We also need to understand the time domain of AGNs in more detail and as Fig 101
illustrates such observations of AGN variability will be aided by a wealth of emerging simu-
lations attempting to model the AGN-host co-evolution eg Vogelsberger et al 2013 Gabor

SUMMARY
Piecing together the puzzle of galaxy evolution precise knowledge about the shape of the pieces
to the puzzle ie the physical conditions of the galaxies not just of the stellar component but of
the interstellar medium ISM and black hole as well This thesis focuses on deriving the actual
shape of those puzzle pieces with particular focus on characterising the ISM as well as the gas
accretion onto the central black hole in order to better understand their effects on the SFR and
general evolution of massive galaxies With this aim in mind the following three studies were
carried out
Amount and distribution of molecular gas in the ISM
A combination of density and temperature is the main agent shaping the CO spectral line en-
ergy distribution SLED and observations thereof can consequently be used to probe the con-
ditions of the star-forming molecular gas in the ISM However detailed modeling is needed in
order to interpret observations For that purpose a new method is constructed and presented
here SImulator of GAlaxy Millimetersubmillimeter Emission SGAME The method is com-
bined with the radiative transfer code LIME in order to simulate CO line emission and by
applying SGAME to three galaxies from cosmological simulations the following conclusions
are drawn for simulated massive galaxies at z  2
 The CO SLED resembles the low-excitation one of the Milky Way MW in that it peaks
at CO3  2 but also with signicant line intensity at higher transitions not seen in the
 Global CO factors range from 14 to 16 Mcid12 pc2 K km s11 or about a third of the
typically assumed MW values
 Total CO3  2 luminosities are within the range of observations of corresponding z 
1  25 star-forming galaxies
 Radial proles of line ratios within each galaxy reveal more excited gas towards the cen-
ter in agreement with observations of nearby galaxies and suggesting ULIRG-like envi-
ronments in the central R  5 kpc regions
 The CO factor displays a decrease towards the center of each model galaxy however
slightly lower than what is observed in local spiral galaxies
Tracing SFR on local and global scales
SGAME is expanded and adapted in order to model CII  the ne-structure line of singly
ionized carbon C thereby being the rst code to simulate the CII emission reliably on kpc-
scales in normal star-forming galaxies CII is typically the strongest cooling line in neutral
ISM and correlates strongly with SFR on global and local scales but its origin is so far unclear
These are the major ndings from applying SGAME to seven z  2 star-forming galaxies from
another simulation
 SGAME predicts a LCII-SFR relation of normal z  2 galaxies which is steeper than that
observed for corresponding galaxies at z  05
 The CII emission that originates in PDRs tends to dominate the total CII luminosity at
low SFR but at higher SFR the molecular component takes over while the HII regions
contribute with negligible amounts
 On resolved 1 kpc scales an expression is provided for the CII-SFR relation
 The low scatter around the modelled LCII-SFR relation in molecular gas owes to a tight
correlation between molecular gas amount and SFR whereas the larger scatter in PDRs
and ionized gas is caused by a combination of SFR density and metallicity of the gas
 No metallicity dependency is found in the scatter around the LCII-SFR relation but
SFRLCII does increase towards the center of each galaxy together with metallicity as
also observed in local spiral galaxies
Importance of AGNs in massive galaxies at z  2
The deep Chandra X-ray survey CDF-S is analysed and AGNs of high and low X-ray luminosity
are extracted via AGN classication methods and stacking techniques of non-detections in X-
ray The galaxies investigated come from a mass-complete at M  5  1010 Mcid12 sample at
15  z  25 with stellar masses from ts of stellar population synthesis models to their
spectral energy distribution By statistical analysis the following results are obtained
 Among both star-forming and quiescent galaxies a similar fraction of 22 5  is found to
have rest-frame X-ray luminosities L05-8 keV  3  1042 erg s1 consistent with hosting
luminous AGNs
 An excess in X-ray-inferred SFR compared to that from infrared and ultraviolet emis-
sion for the stacked non-detections converts into even higher fractions of low- or high-
luminosity AGNs among these This fraction is higher 70  100  among quiescent
galaxies than among star-forming ones 43  65 
 Hot gas halos are rejected as potential sources for the strong X-ray emission in the de-
tected galaxies based on the very limited spatial extent of their X-ray emission
 The fraction of luminous AGNs does not depend on SFR nor stellar mass suggesting that
external effects are triggering the AGNs
SAMMENFATNING
Det er et sandt puslespil at stykke galakse-udviklingen sammen ud fra observationer ved
forskellige rdforskydninger For at lse puslespillet er det frst of fremmest afgrende at
kende formen af brikkerne dvs den fysiske tilstand af galakserne  ikke bare af deres stellare
del men ogs af deres interstellare medium ISM og centrale sorte hul Med dette ml for je
bestr denne afhandling af flgende tre projekter
Mngde og fordeling af molekylr gas i ISM af galakser
Den spektrale linie energi fordeling SLED Spectral Line Energy Distribution for CO molekylet
er bestemt af hovedsagelig tthed og temperatur af den gas hvor linien udsendes fra og ob-
servationer af CO SLEDs kan derfor bruges til at bestemme tilstanden af den stjernedannende
molekylre gas i ISM af galakser For at kunne overstte observationer af SLEDen til s-
danne gas tilstande er detaljeret modellering ndvendig Til det forml bliver en ny metode
skabt og prsenteret her SImulator of GAlaxy Millimetersubmillimeter Emission SGAME
Denne metode kombineres med en kode for strlingstransport af millimeter of infrard strling
LIME for at kunne simulere CO linie emission og ved at anvende SGAME p tre galakser fra
kosmologiske simulationer bliver de flgende konklusioner draget for massive galakser ved
z  2
 CO SLEDen minder om den lavt eksiterede SLED i Mlkevejen i og med at den har
maksimum i CO3 2 men de har ogs signikant linie intensitet ved hjere overgange
hvilket ikke ses i Mlkevejen
 Globale CO faktorer ligger p omkring 50  af Mlkevejens nemlig fra 226 til 261 Mcid12
pc2 K km s11
 De totale CO3  2 luminositeter er alle omkring 1  2  under middel af observationer
af sammenlignelige z  1  25 stjernedannende galakser hjst sandsynlig pga relativt
lave molekylre gas masser i vores model galakser
 Radielle proler af CO linie forhold viser at hver model galakse indeholder mere eksiteret
gas i de centrale dele sammenlignet med lngere ude i disken Dette er i overensstem-
melse med observationer af lokale galakser og antyder at de centrale R  5 kpc omrder
minder om de forhold man nder i ULIRGs Ultra-Luminse Infrarde Galakser
 CO faktoren aftager mod centrum i galakserne som ogs observeret dog med et mindre
relativt fald ift til det man typisk oberverer i lokale spiral-galakser
Afdkning af SFR p sm og store skalaer
SGAME udvides og adapteres til at modellere CII n-struktur linien fra enkelt-ioniseret car-
bon C og er dermed den frste kode til trovrdigt at simulere CII emission p kpc-skala i
normale stjernedannende galakser CII er typisk den linie der kraftigst kler neutral ISM og
den skalerer med SFR p globale svel som p lokale skalaer Men dens fysiske oprindelse i
gassen er stadig uklar Disse er de fr ste konklusioner som SGAME indtil nu har frt til p det
omrde
 SGAME forudsiger at relationen mellem LCII og SFR for kan for normale galakser flger
er mere stejl end den for tilsvarende galakser ved z  05
 CII emission udspringer hovedsageligt fra PDRs Photon Dominated Regions for lave
SFR vrdier men molekylr gas overtager ved hjere SFR HII gas bidrager derimod
med neglicibel CII intensitet
 P oplste 1 kpc skalaer opstilles et udtryk for CII som funktion af SFR
 Den lave spredning i LCII-SFR relationen for molekylr gas skyldes en tt sammenhng
mellem molekylr gas masse of total SFR I PDRs og ioniseret gas skyldes den strre
spredning derimod en kombination af SFR tthed of metallicitet i gassen
 Der ses ikke nogen metallicitets-afhngighed for spredningen omkring LCII-SFR relatio-
nen men SFRLCII raten stiger imod centrum af galakserne sammen med metalliciteten
hvilket ogs er blevet observeret i lokale spiral-galakser
En vigtig rolle af AGNs i massive galakser ved s  2

 En brkdel p 22  5  blandt stjerne-dannende svel som blandt passive galakser har
X-ray lystyrker svarende til lysstrke AGNs
 En endnu strre brkdel blandt de ikke-detekterede galakser viser tegn p at indeholde
AGNs af lav til hj luminositet med hjere brkdel 70  100  blandt passive galakser
sammenlignet med de stjerne-dannende 43  65 
 Grundet den rumligt koncentrerede X-ray emission fra de undersgte galakser kan en ek-
stremt varm gas halo udelukkes som rsag til X-ray emissionen i de detekterede galakser
 Brkdelen af lysstrke AGNs afhnger ikke af SFR eller stellar masse hvilket tyder p at
eksterne faktorer spiller ind p antndelsen af deres AGNs

where CRHI is the primary CR ionization rate of HI atoms determined locally in our sim-
ulations according to eq 412 and xe is the hydrogen ionization fraction calculated with a
procedure kindly provided by I Pelupessy see also Pelupessy 2005 The term containing
xe in eq A1 above accounts for the fact that in gas of high ionization the electron created by
the primary CR ionization has a high probability of transferring its kinetic energy into heat
via long-range Coulomb scattering off free electrons In the case of low ionization this term
becomes insignicant as a higher fraction of its energy will go to secondary ionizations or ex-
citation of bound states in stead of heating

Tk nH and the abundances of the above elements as input Wiersma et al 2009 compute the
cooling rates with the photoionization package CLOUDY under the assumption of CIE They
also adopt a value for the meta-galactic UV and X-ray eld equal to that expected at z  2
Haardt  Madau 2001 At z  2 the emission rate of HI ionizing radiation is higher by a
factor of about  30 than at z  0 Puchwein et al 2014 and thus plays an important role in

A3 GMC MODELS
Each SPH particle is divided into several GMCs as described in  434 and we derive the
molecular gas density and temperature within each from three basic parameters which are SFR
density GMC mass mGMC and metallicity Zcid48Zcid12 Derived from these basic parameters are
the far-UV and cosmic ray eld strengths the H2 gas mass fraction of each SPH particles as
well as the GMC properties used to derive the CO excitation and emission H2 density and
temperature Histograms of the basic parameters are shown in Figure A3 while properties
derived thereof can be found in Figure A4

GMC models Each GMC in the galaxies is assigned the Tk  nH2 curve of the GMC model at the closest grid point

curve in the highlighted panel and corresponds to G0  70 CR  35  1016 s1 log mGMCMcid12  425 and
Zcid48  32 In general higher metallicity from top to bottom leads to more cooling via emission lines of ions atoms
and molecules and hence lower temperatures On the other hand higher UV and CR elds from left to right cause
more heating and therefore higher Tk The decreasing trend of Tk with higher values of nH2 is mainly caused by the
gradual attenuation of the UV eld as one moves into the cloud The bump at nH2  103  104 cm3 corresponds
to the transition from CII line cooling to the less efcient CO line cooling at higher densities At densities above
nH2  104 cm3 gas-dust interactions set in and eventually cools the gas down to the CMB temperature in all GMC
cores In areas with very high SFRD this will not happen in reality but our moderately star-forming galaxies rarely
reach such high SFRD values

pressure environments are seen to lead to a decrease in luminosity for all transitions
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 6
B1 DENSITY OF SINGLY IONIZED CARBON
The strength of the CII emission from any gas phase depends on the fraction of total carbon
atoms that are singly ionized fCII For calculating fCII we chose to employ the microphysics
code CLOUDY v1303 that simultaneously solves the equations for statistical and thermal equi-
librium for a wide range of optional elements We set up CLOUDY to work on a small parcel of
gas with a single temperature and a constant density across its volume The incident radiation
eld on the gas parcel is set to the local interstellar radiation eld as provided by CLOUDY but
scaled by a factor in practice our G0 In addition a cosmic ray ionization rate can be specied
in units of s1
As a test to judge whether we are using CLOUDY correctly the fraction of CIV fCIV as
a function of density and temperature was compared to the work of Oppenheimer  Schaye
2013 by reproducing their CIV fractions at z  1 for a Haardt  Madau 2001 background
radiation eld This comparison is shown in Fig B1 with plots of the CIV abundance rela-
Figure B1 A comparison of fCIV as calculated by Oppenheimer  Schaye 2013 using CLOUDY v1000 left and by
SGAME using CLOUDY v1303 right In both cases a Haardt  Madau 2005 background radiation eld embedded in
CLOUDY at z  1 was used together with solar abundances A good agreement is seen in particular with decreasing
fCIV towards high densities and low temperatures where carbon exists in lower ionizational states such as CII see
Fig B2 below
Figure B2 Maps of fCII as function of gas temperature and hydrogen density made with CLOUDY v1303 as part of
the grid used in SGAME to derive xe and fCII in the ISM Top row For three values of G0 and CR xed at 1017 s1
Bottom row For three values of CR with G0 xed to 1 Habing Note how fCII drops at Tk cid38 105 K in all cases and
depends on CR while being largely insensitive to changes in G0
tive to the total number of carbon atoms as a function of hydrogen density and kinetic gas
temperature A good agreement with the gure of Oppenheimer  Schaye 2013 is achieved
when using the build-in Haardt  Madau 2005 background of CLOUDY HM05 command in
CLOUDY including galaxies and quasars but not the CMB at z  1 together with default solar
abundances
In order to keep the computing time of SGAME low we set up a grid in nH Tk CR
G0  and calculated fCII with CLOUDY for each grid point Though metallicity and element
abundances of C O Si and Fe are followed in our simulated galaxies we chose the default
solar composition that comes with CLOUDY for the sake of having fewer parameters in the
grid Visualizations of this grid are shown in Fig B2 for three values of G0 and CR xed at
1017 s1 close to the adopted CRMW  1017 s1 in the top row and three values of CR
with G0 xed to 1 Habing close to G0MW  06 Habing in the bottom row As can be seen
fCII does not seem to depend at all on G0 but much more on the intensity of cosmic rays
Figure B3 A comparison of CLOUDY and the method described in Pelupessy 2005 for deriving xe as a function of
electron temperature T e at a density of nH  2  105 cm3 The two methods agree about the shape of increasing
xe with T e including the sharp rise at Tk  104 K due to Balmer lines The P05 method does not include ionization
by the FUV radiation eld meaning that it takes the same shape in each panel Note that xe rises above 1 due to the
inclusion of other elements than hydrogen that can contribute to the electron number
B2 ELECTRON FRACTION
In order to be consistent with the calculation of fCII we also decided to calculate the electron
fraction xe with CLOUDY v1303 rather than the method of Pelupessy 2005 P05 used in the
previous project Chapter 4 Fig B3 shows how CLOUDY and the P05 method compare as a
function of electron temperature at a density of nH  2105 cm3 for different combinations of
interstellar radiation eld G0 and cosmic ray ionization rate CR The P05 method is aimed
for application in the interior of GMCs and therefore only considers ionization by cosmic rays
that are expected to dominate the ionization of hydrogen whereas CLOUDY takes G0 and CR
as separate variables
Furthermore P05 method does not depend on density whereas the calculation with CLOUDY
does Fig B4 gives the same comparison as the previous gure but for a lower density of
nH  100 cm3 where CLOUDY derives much larger electron fractions than the P05 model
This is expected since at low densities the gas is less shielded from the incident radiation
eld We therefore consider the inclusion of the CLOUDY with its sensitivity towards G0 and
nH an improvement of SGAME with respect to the electron fraction

B4 THE CII COOLING RATE IN GAS OF DIFFERENT CONDI-
For a two-level system such as CII embedded in a radiation eld with energy density U at the
transition frequency the general rate equation governing the population levels can be written
BluU  Clu
Aul  BulU  Cul
gBulU  gKCul
Aul  BulU  Cul
where Aul  23  106 s1 is the spontaneous emission rate and Bul and Blu are the stimu-
lated emission and absorption rate coefcients respectively Goldsmith et al 2012 Here we
have invoked detailed balance ie BluU  gBulU and Clu  gKCul where g  gugl is the
ratio of the statistical weights and K  ehkBTk  e9125 KTk We can then write the fraction
of C in the upper level fu as
nl  nu
gBulU  gKCul
Aul  1  gBulU  Cul  gKCul
gK  gBulUCul

In general U  1U TexU Tbg where U Tbg is the energy density from a background
eld eg CMB or radiation from dust and  is the escape probability fraction at the CII
frequency see also Goldsmith et al 2012 We shall ignore any background however in which
case we can write the stimulated downward rate as

see Goldsmith et al 2012 For the escape probability we assume a spherical geometry with a
radial velocity gradient proportional to radius such that   1  exp  In calculating
the integral in eq 618 we split the integral up into 100 radial bins of thickness R see Section
65 and we approximate the optical depth in each such bin with that of a homogeneous static
slab of gas of thickness R Draine 2011

where v is the gas velocity dispersion which is calculated according to eq 65 for the PDR
and molecular gas regions in the GMCs and is set to the local velocity dispersion in the SPH
simulation in the case of the ionized clouds We use eqs B2 B3 B4 and B5 to iteratively
solve for consistent values of fu and  in each R bin This is done by rst assuming optically
thin emission   1 in order to get an initial estimate of fu eq B2 which is subsequently
used to calculate  and  eq B5 and from that Tex and BulU eqs B4 and B3 etc Once
consistent values for fu and  have been reached we calculate the total cooling rate according
to eq 619 This cooling rate is used to determine the thermal balance at various points within
the GMCs as well as the CII emission from the ionized clouds as described in Section 65 We
emphasize that our methods assumes that the CII emission from the different R bins within
a cloud is radiatively de-coupled and that the total CII emission from a cloud is therefore the
sum of the emission from each bin
As explained in Section 65 CII is collisionally deexcited by H2 in the molecular phase
by e and HI in the PDR region and by e in the ionized gas For a single collision partner the
collision rates are equal to the density n of the collision partner times the rate coefcients ie
Cul  nRul and Clu  nRlu In case of two collision partners we have Cul  n1Rul1  n2Rul2
and Clu  n1Rlu1  n2Rlu2 Fig B5 shows the CII dexcitation rate coefcients that we
have adopted in our work for collisions with e H I and H2 as a function of temperature For
collisions with electrons we adopt the following expression for the deexcitation rate coefcient
as a function of electron temperature Te
Rule  87  108Te2000 K037 cm3 s1
which is applicable for temperatures from cid39 100 K to 20000 K Goldsmith et al 2012 At
temperatures  20000 K we set Rule  T 085

2015 For the PDR gas the electron density is calculated using CLOUDY and the electron
temperature is set to the kinetic temperature of the gas calculated according to eq 616 For
the ionized gas we assume ne  nHII ie xe  1 and the electron temperature gas is set to
the SPH gas kinetic temperature see Section 642 For the deexcitation rate coefcient for
collisions with H I we use the analytical expression provided by Barinovs et al 2005 and
shown as the dotted curve in Fig B5

While Barinovs et al 2005 cites an application range for the above expression of 15 K  Tk 
2000 K a comparison with RulH I-values found by Keenan et al 1986 over the temperature
range 10 K  Tk  100 000 K shows that eq B7 provides an excellent match over this larger
temperature range Fig B5 For collisions with H2 we follow Goldsmith et al 2012 and
assume that the collision rate coefcients are approximately half those for collisions with H
over the relevant temperature range for the molecular gas ie RulH2  05  RulH

over the temperature ranges where they are formally applicable The blue orange and red
rectangles indicate the temperature range encountered in the ionized atomic and molecular
phase in our simulated galaxies respectively see sections 641 and 642
