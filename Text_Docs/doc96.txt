Abstract We present the results of a survey of nearby quiescent non-
peculiar extremely isolated galaxies to search for the gaseous remnants of
galaxy formation Such remnants are predicted to persist around galax-
ies into the present day by galaxy formation models We nd low-mass
H i companions around 7 of 34 galaxies surveyed
In addition we nd
5 galaxies with lopsided H i distributions The implications for galaxy
formation and the nature of high velocity clouds are discussed
Introduction
What is the current state of galaxy formation in the local universe There
have been many recent detections of H i clouds near larger spiral galaxies in the
local universe Such detections include H i clouds around NGC 925 Pisano
Wilcots  Elmegreen 1998 IC 10 Wilcots  Miller 1998 four of ve barred
Magellanic spirals Wilcots Lehman  Miller 1996 four of 16 low surface
brightness dwarf galaxies and four of nine H ii galaxies Taylor et al 1993
1996 and high-velocity clouds HVCs around M101 Kamphuis 1993 NGC
628 Kamphuis  Briggs 1992 and in our own Local Group see Wakker 
van Woerden 1997 Blitz et al 1999 Typical clouds have 107-108M of H i
amounting to 1-50 of the mass of the primary galaxy
In numerous cases these H i clouds have been suggested to be remnant ma-
terial from the galaxy formation process eg NGC 925 IC 10 NGC 628 etc
Current models of cold dark matter galaxy formation in which disk galaxies were
built up via the accretion of smaller bodies in a hierarchical merging process
predict such remnant material to exist eg Navarro Frenk  White 1995
Unfortunately the serendipitous nature of these detections inhibit our ability to
divine the true origin of the H i clouds These H i clouds could be primordial
material but could also be material ejected via a galactic fountain or superwind
tidal debris from a recent interaction or simply a small dwarf galaxy companion
Therefore few if any of the H i clouds represent unambiguous detections of the
remnant reservoir of gas from which galaxies formed
To determine what the current state of galaxy formation is we have con-
ducted a systematic search for the remnant gas around a sample of extremely
Pisano  Wilcots
isolated and quiescent galaxies The results from the pilot survey of six galaxies
were reported in Pisano  Wilcots 1999 here we report of the current status of
the expanded survey
2 Sample
In order to determine the origin of H i clouds around other galaxies it is impor-
tant to have a well-dened sample We chose galaxies from the Nearby Galaxies
Catalog Tully 1988 The galaxies were classied as isolated such that they had
no known companions with MB -16 mag within 1 Mpc of them In addition
galaxies were chosen that were classied as non-peculiar These two conditions
minimize the chance of the galaxy having had a recent interaction or merger
so there should be no tidal debris around our sample galaxies Our galaxies
were also chosen to be quiescent ie not Seyferts or starbursts so that any gas
around these galaxies is unlikely to be galactic ejecta from a galactic fountain
or superwind
Finally galaxies were chosen such that they were large enough and close
enough to resolve with the VLA in D conguration and the ATCA 750 cong-
uration D25 1 R45 Mpc yet far enough away to probe out at least 90 kpc
R21 Mpc This left us with 60 galaxies in the entire sky we observed 34 of
those galaxies
3 Observations
Between November 1997 and February 2000 we observed a total of 34 galaxies
with the VLA and ATCA A total of 600 km s1 was covered at a resolution
of 52 km s1 for each observation The sample galaxies had distances between
21 Mpc and 45 Mpc allowing us to survey out to a radius of 92 - 192 kpc
at a resolution of 161-128 kpc The resulting observations have  05-
11019cm1 per channel for the column density The mass detection limits are
8335106M for a 5 detection over 2 channels 104 km s1 The range
of mass detection limits comes from varying sensitivity and distance for each
galaxy
4 Results
Of the 34 galaxies surveyed we detected gas-rich companions in H i around 7 of
them see gures 1  2 Another 5 galaxies have disturbed H i morphologies
gures 3  4 either severe warps or lopsided distributions possibly indicative
of a recent minor merger The remaining 22 galaxies are relatively normal with
all of the idiosyncrasies we typically see in galaxies such as small warps and
asymmetries
The detected companions have MH i between 108M and 109M which
corresponds to 3-30 of the primary galaxys mass in H i The companions
appear show signatures of rotation so based on the rotation widths and sizes
of the companions we determined their dynamical masses to be between 109M
and 1010M which is 05-10 of the main galaxys dynamical masses The

NGC 2708 an isolated galaxy interacting with a gas-rich
ratio of H i mass to dynamical mass for the companions range from 7-85 All
H i clouds detected have spatially coincident optical emission with the possible
exception of UGC 11152 All of these properties are consistent with the gas-rich
companions being typical dwarf galaxies
This does not however mean that we have not detected the gaseous rem-
nants of galaxy formation but simply that these gas clouds formed stars before
being accreted by the primary galaxy It is important to conrm however that
these gas-rich companions will eventually be accreted Our companions have
projected separations of 20-100 kpc 1-6 Rgal in radius and 20-100 km s1 in
velocity These numbers imply an orbit time which is roughly equal to the
dynamical friction timescale of 5-10 Gyr These companions turn out to be in
relatively stable orbits
Implications for the nature of High-Velocity Clouds
The Blitz et al 1999 model for the origin of HVCs in the Local Group sug-
gests that they are primordial material left over from the formation of the Lo-
cal Group
In this model HVCs are at large distances from the Milky Way
R750kpc-1Mpc and therefore have large masses MH i 107M
While our survey was not optimized to examine the origin of HVCs there
are some intriguing implications from its results We detected no objects that
resembled HVCs ie no gas-rich companions without stars Furthermore we
detected no companions smaller than 108M in H i down to our detection limit
at 107M This implies that if HVCs are associated with galaxy formation
they must either have masses lower than 107M andor be at projected separa-
tions greater than 140 kpc The former suggestion is somewhat unlikely because
we do detect larger companions and while one might expect more H i clouds at
lower masses we do not detect any down to our detection limit Another possi-
ble explanation for our non-detection of HVCs is that they are associated with
group formation and not with the formation of individual isolated galaxies
Either way any explanation for a primordial origin of HVCs in the Local Group
must account for our non-detection of them around isolated galaxies

Implications for Galaxy Formation
The main goal of this work was to assess the state of galaxy formation in the local
universe At this point in time this work has yielded three main implications
for galaxy formation
First galaxy formation appears to be an ecient process As discussed
above we found no companions with H i masses below 108M implying that
there is not a population of low mass H i clouds within 100 kpc of these
galaxies
Second galaxy formation has basically concluded Only 20 of isolated
galaxies have low-mass 10Mgal gas-rich companions which are in stable
orbits Therefore most of the gas must already be in the main galaxy The
mass outside of the main galaxy will take a long time 5 Gyr to be accreted
Third galaxy formation may have recently ended Another 15 of isolated
galaxies have disturbed H i morphologies suggesting that they may have recently
in the last 1 Gyr undergone a minor merger 10 Mgal
The accretion rates implied by this work 10 of Mgal over 6 Gyr for 40
of galaxies are consistent with those derived by Toth  Ostriker 1992 from
the scale height of the Milky Way Zaritsky  Rix 1997 from the frequency of
asymmetries and Navarro Frenk  White 1995 from galaxy formation simu-
lations Future work on this project will involve further increasing the number
of galaxies surveyed comparing the stellar properties of the main galaxies and
companions with their H i properties and more detailed comparisons of our de-
tection rates with theoretical predictions
