Abstract
Phagocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis are vitally important par-
ticle uptake mechanisms in many cell types ranging from single-cell organisms
to immune cells In both processes engulfment by the cell depends critically on
both particle shape and orientation However most previous theoretical work
has focused only on spherical particles and hence disregards the wide-ranging
particle shapes occurring in nature such as those of bacteria Here by imple-
menting a simple model in one and two dimensions we compare and contrast
receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis for a range of biologically rel-
evant shapes including spheres ellipsoids capped cylinders and hourglasses
We nd a whole range of dierent engulfment behaviors with some ellipsoids
engulng faster than spheres and that phagocytosis is able to engulf a greater
range of target shapes than other types of endocytosis Further the 2D model
can explain why some nonspherical particles engulf fastest not at all when
presented to the membrane tip-rst lying at Our work reveals how some
bacteria may avoid being internalized simply because of their shape and sug-
gests shapes for optimal drug delivery
Introduction
Cells are capable of ingesting a huge range of particle shapes from rod-shaped E
coli to doubly-lobed budding yeast from helical Borrelia to lamentous Legionella
1 2 3 Further the shape is critical in determining whether engulfment is possible
and if so how long it takes In fact it has been argued that the target shape plays an
even more critical role than size 4 5 In addition target orientation strongly aects
internalisation with ellipsoidal particles engulfed far easier when the highly-curved
tip is presented rst 4 6 Yet despite this there is relatively little work studying
shape and orientation dependence with the vast majority of previous papers both
experimental and theoretical involving only spherical targets
Endocytosis encompasses a number of dierent mechanisms of cellular internal-
isation including clathrin-mediated endocytosis caveolar-type endocytosis macro-
pinocytosis and phagocytosis 7 Whilst sharing some similarities these processes
often proceed in strikingly dierent manners For example phagocytosis is typi-
cally highly active and involves the membrane extending outwards with nger-like
protrusions surrounding the target in an actin-dependent process 8 9 Conversely
clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a more passive process with targets appearing to
sink into the cell 10 Here we focus on types of endocytosis that involve target
recognition via receptors We assume that receptors bind irreversibly to ligands on
the target so that engulfment proceeds monotonically 11 12 In particular we dis-
tinguish phagocytosis from other less active forms of receptor-driven internalisation
We refer to all these latter processes as receptor-mediated endocytosis including
clathrin-mediated endocytosis
Various mathematical models have attempted to understand the mechanism and
dynamics of engulfment All forms of endocytosis in particular phagocytosis are
extremely complex involving hundreds of dierent protein species in signalling cas-
cades and cytoskeleton remodelling 13 14 15 16 As a result overly-complicated
models that try to include every component are unlikely to be useful Instead more
progress can be made by considering simpler intuitive models that capture the es-
sential mechanisms For example viral engulfment has been modelled by examining
the free energy of membrane bending and adhesion 17 18 Similarly van Een-
terre et al used a thermodynamic approach that involved considering an ensemble
of target particles 19 Recently the role of actin during endocytosis in yeast was
addressed by using a variational approach and arguing that the nal pinch-o stage
is due to a pearling-like instability 20
There are also models that focus on phagocytosis For example van Zon et al
included simple dynamics for both actin and receptors which they used to under-
stand why engulfment normally either stalls before halfway or reaches completion
6 Herant et al
focussed on the forces required to explain the cup shape and
showed using a continuum mechanics approach the need for both repulsion at the
cup edge and attening within the cup 21 22 Various other approaches focus only
on energetic requirements such as those due to membrane bending and receptor-
ligand binding equating the phagocytic cup with some minimum energy state For
example Dasgupta et al used this approach to argue that ellipsoids are harder to
engulf than spheres 23 24 whereas Tollis et al found that an actin-driven ratchet
mechanism can lead to robust engulfment 25
One particularly elegant approach by Gao et al models endocytosis by consid-
ering only the motion of receptors within the membrane 26 They argued that the
essence of receptor-mediated endocytosis is related to the dynamics of the recep-
tors themselves which can be mapped to the supercooled Stefan problem a simple
physical model of how the boundary between ice and water moves during freez-
ing Although they were able to understand how particle radius aects the rate of
engulfment predicting an optimum radius corresponding to the quickest possible
engulfment time they only considered spherical particles Cylindrical ellipsoids
were considered in 27 but not in a consistent manner In 28 we extended the
Gao et al model to phagocytosis arguing that a similar mathematical model can
explain receptor motion in both cases This involved including receptor drift and
signalling and showed that the two distinct stages of engulfment an initial slow
stage followed by a much quicker second stage can be explained by dierent recep-
tor dynamics during dierent stages However again we almost exclusively focused
on only spherical particles
Here to address the role of particle shape during engulfment we extend these
models in three ways First by allowing nonconstant curvature we are able to study
Figure 1 Biologically relevant particle shapes A Spheres B Spheroids both
prolate left and oblate right C Capped cylinders consisting of a cylindrical region
capped by hemispheres which describe certain bacteria D Hourglasses made from
spherical caps and a narrow neck region which model cells during the division process
nonspherical particle shapes such as ellipsoids capped cylinders and hourglasses
Fig 1 All the shapes we consider are relevant for real biological systems such as
rod-shaped bacteria and dividing budding yeast Second we include signalling and
a role for actin in order to examine the dierent target shape dependence between
phagocytosis and other types of receptor-mediated endocytosis Third we extend
the formalism from a 1D to a 2D model which allows for the rst time to our
knowledge lower-symmetry shapes such as lying ellipsoids to be studied With
this model we are able to address how orientation aects engulfment nding an
explanation for why prolate spheroids engulf quickest when presented to the cell
tip-rst Finally we compare our model with known experimental results
Results
We rst study endocytosis in general and consider particles both with and with-
out circular symmetry Then we extend the model to apply to phagocytosis by
including signalling and actin By particle symmetry we mean the symmetry of the
particle looking from directly above the membrane For example a prolate spheroid
will have circular symmetry only when presented tip rst as in the shape on the
left in Fig 1B As we now show our model for circularly-symmetric particles be-
comes eectively 1D allowing easier analytic and numerical treatment Conversely
non-symmetric particles require a full 2D model introducing extra physical and nu-
merical issues We rst consider circularly-symmetric particlesspheres tip-rst
spheroids capped cylinders hourglassesand next examine non-symmetric parti-
cles for example ellipsoids that lie at as in the rst shape in Fig 1B lying on its
1D model for endocytosis of circularly-symmetric particles
We rst extend the model in Gao et al 26 to include nonspherical particles This
is a model of receptor motion with the inclusion of membrane bending and ligand-
receptor binding which focuses on the cup size as a function of time Consider a
particle whose cross section parallel to the membrane is circularly symmetric such
as all the shapes in Fig 1 Then receptor motion within the membrane and the
fraction of engulfment can be parameterised by just one spatial parameter r the
ABCDdistance from the centre of the cup Thus at time t the receptors are described
by a density r t and the engulfment by at which represents the engulfed arc
length measured from the centre of the cup Fig 2A
Initially  is assumed uniform and given by 0 which is also the value that
is imposed at r   at all times As the particle is engulfed receptors bind to
ligands on the bead and the density increases to L in the engulfed region Fig 2B
We assume for simplicity that receptors are never destroyed or created so that the
evolution of the receptor density  in the non-engulfed region r  a is governed
simply by diusion with diusion constant D At the cup boundary receptors ow
into the bound region increasing the engulfment a By considering the conservation
of receptors the rate of increase of a can be related to the ux of receptors so that
our 1D model is given in the non-engulfed region r  a by

where  is the receptor density at the cup edge Initial conditions are r 0  0
and a0  0 This is identical to the supercooled 1D Stefan problem studied in
physics as a model of the freezing of water
To nd a unique solution we impose one extra condition the value of  at the
edge of the cup  Since the boundary continually moves the position where this
extra condition is applied also continually moves such that t  at t As
in 26 we x t by requiring that there is no free-energy jump across the cup
ie that all energy from receptor-ligand binding is used for engulfment We consider
three contributions to the free energy receptor-ligand binding membrane curvature
and receptor entropy which leads to the condition
where E is the binding energy per receptor-ligand bond B is the bending modulus
and H is the mean curvature of the particle at the cup edge We ignore any contri-
bution from the Gaussian curvature since its eect is normally similar to that from
the mean curvature for biologically relevant target shapes
The original model in 26 only considered spherical particles so that the cur-
vature H is constant
In order to consider other particle shapes we allow H to
depend on the engulfment a This in turn means that  is now not constant in
time and that analytic solutions can no longer be found This same approach was
attempted in 27 for cylindrical particles but with a misunderstanding that we be-
lieve invalidates their results To make progress we numerically solve the system
see Materials and Methods and consider in turn spheroids capped cylinders and
hourglasses
Spheroids
A spheroid is an ellipsoid where two of the principal axes have the same length
Later in our 2D model we will be able to consider spheroids presented to the cell

the receptor density at innity and  the receptor density at the cup edge
both end-on and lying down However in the 1D model which requires circularly-
symmetric particles only standing spheroids can be examined A spheroid is char-
acterised by two radii R1 the radius of the semi-principal axis parallel to the
membrane and R2 the radius perpendicular to the membrane Fig 3A We
use a standard parameterisation of the surface of a spheroid given by x y z 
R1 sin v cos u R1 sin v sin uR2 cos v where u  0 2 and v  0  Here the
z-axis represents the perpendicular distance from the membrane so that v  0 is
the lowest point the point of the spheroid that rst touches the membrane and
is the rst to be engulfed
We must relate the mean curvature H to the arc length s measured from v  0
The curvature can be written in terms of v as

whereas the arc length is given by an incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind
1 cos2w  R2
2 sin2w dw
3 and 4 we proceed as
Since v cannot be directly eliminated between Eqs
follows for a given engulfment arc length a we numerically solve Eq 4 to nd
v and then use Eq 3 to nd the curvature
We nd that for R1 cid54 R2 engulfment no longer proceeds with the square root
of time Fig 3B The speed of engulfment now depends on the local curvature
at the cup edge Higher curvatures decrease the right hand side of Eq 2 and
increase  In turn a higher  decreases cid48 at the cup edge and tends to reduce
the engulfment rate Thus highly curved regions lead to slow engulfment whereas
atter regions engulf faster Regions which are too highly curved lead to stalling
where engulfment cannot proceed further Fig 3B In our mathematical model
this occurs when   0 so that the right-hand side of the second part of Eq 1
becomes negative which we interpret as a  0
To compare dierent spheroids we vary R1 whilst always choosing R2 to ensure
the same total surface area We nd similar results by instead xing the volume
Receptorsdensity ABLigandsdensity LraL0Cup size aor R2 As shown in Figs 3B and 3C we nd ve classes of behaviour depending
on the value of R1 First for suciently small R1 the initial curvature is so high
that engulfment can never begin and the particle simply sits on the cell membrane
Second for larger R1 we reach a slow-fast-slow mode of engulfment the initial high
curvature at the particle base leads to slow engulfment with quicker engulfment
in the smaller-curvature middle region before again a highly-curved slow stage
near the top of the particle Third as R1 is further increased the spherical case
is reached R1  R2 characterised by
t engulfment Fourth at still higher R1
a fast-slow-fast stage is encountered with engulfment quickest at the beginning
and end where the curvature is lowest Finally suciently high R1 again leads to
incomplete engulfment although now unlike for small R1 engulfment stalls around
halfway
To better understand the eect of changing R1 we study the half and full en-
gulfment times Fig 3D Spheroids with R1  R2 like those on the left in Fig
1B always take longer than the equivalent sphere to reach both half and full en-
gulfment Conversely spheroids with R1 slightly bigger than R2 engulf faster than
spheres This is interesting and suggests that rod-shaped bacteria can sometimes
be engulfed faster than coccus-shaped bacteria of the same surface area As R1 is
further increased a minimum is reached Beyond this the high curvature becomes a
dominant factor and causes both the half and full engulfment times to rise sharply
for larger values of R1
To study the orientation dependence of engulfment we compare ellipsoids with
R1 R2  R 1m to those with R1 R2  1m R where R is chosen so
that the surface area is the same for both cases Of course these two shapes do not
correspond to the same spheroid only later in our extended 2D model we will be
able to directly compare the same ellipsoid in dierent orientations In particular
we compare the dierence in total engulfment time for these two shapes Fig 3E
For R  1m we nd that the oblate spheroid with R1 R2  R 1m engulfs
quickest This is simply because the total engulfment length is smaller For the
same reason for R slightly smaller than 1m engulfment is also quickest for oblate
spheroids which are now those with R1 R2  1m R However for suciently
small R the required value of R is such that the curvature at the mid-point becomes
limiting slowing engulfment for the R1 R2  1m R spheroid so that prolate
spheroids are engulfed faster
Capped cylinders and hourglasses
We now briey consider two other circularly-symmetric shapes Capped cylinders
consisting of a cylinder with a hemisphere attached at either end are good models
for various rod-shaped bacteria such as E coli and Bacillus subtilis These display
a slow-fast-stall-slow engulfment behaviour related to the lower curvature found in
the neck region The stalling is caused by a jump in  at the top of the neck
By xing the surface area and varying the neck height we nd that the quickest
engulfment corresponds to a sphere Even though rods are not capped cylinders
Figure 3 Engulfment time for spheroids in 1D model A Cross section of a
spheroid dened by R1 the axis length parallel to the membrane and R2 the
perpendicular axis length The full shape is obtained by rotating around the z-axis thus
giving an ellipsoid with axis lengths R1 R1 R2 B Progression of engulfment for
spheroids with various R1 In each case R2 is chosen so that the surface area is the same as
for a sphere of radius 08m The spherical case red curve shows classic
Nonspherical spheroids show slower rates of engulfment in regions with high curvatures

this could explain the observation that for endocytosis spheres engulf in less time
than rod-shaped particles 29
Hourglasses are more complicated shapes but are useful for modelling cases
of dividing cells such as budding yeast during division 1 30 The engulfment
behaviour and the total engulfment time depend on exactly how narrow the neck is
compared to the spherical caps with the neck region engulfed sometimes faster and
sometimes slower than the caps Interestingly the quickest engulfed hourglass does
not correspond to the shape with the smallest neck curvature

Although actin plays a role in many types of endocytosis it seems to be far more
important for successful engulfment in phagocytosis 31 32 25 To this end we
extend our model to apply to phagocytosis by adding a simple role for actin Moti-
vated by our previous work 28 we achieve this by including a signalling molecule
S which recruits actin to push at the cup edge We assume that S is produced
only within the cup with rate L is degraded everywhere with lifetime   and
diuses with constant DS Then S is described by 28

 La  r  1S
where x is the Heaviside function
Even though the actin network provides a pushing force at the cup edge this
will not necessarily increase the engulfed target length a unless sucient receptors
are also present simply pushing the membrane further around the target without
a suitable zipper mechanism risks subsequent unwrapping 25 Thus the real eect
of actin at least as far as our model is concerned is in facilitating receptor motion
to the cup edge One way this could be achieved is by actin helping to bend the
membrane around the target thus eectively reducing the free energy needed for
membrane bending For example an actin network structure that matches the target
curvature would naturally encourage the membrane to bend in the same manner via
scaolding 33 We implement this mechanism by allowing the bending modulus B
to depend on the value of S at the cup edge S via B  B01B1S where Bi are
constants We identify B0 with the constant value of B in the non-phagocytic model
and call B1 the bending-actin constant Then B1  0 corresponds to non-phagocytic
endocytosis and B1  0 to phagocytosis Note that this mechanism does not require
that the membrane becomes softer only that bending becomes easier This could be
related for example to changes in lipid composition within the phagocytic cup as a
result of localised small GTPase recruitment 34 or to changes in the spontaneous
curvature
We rst examine the dierence between receptor-mediated endocytosis and phago-
cytosis for oblate spheroids R1  R2 Suciently eccentric spheroids cannot be
engulfed by receptor-mediated endocytosis since the curvature around half way is
too high Fig 3D However with the introduction of signalling and a role for actin
such ellipsoids can often be ingested by phagocytosis Fig 4A In these cases the
initial rate of engulfment when S is small is similar in both models However when
engulfment slows down around half way the recruitment of actin to the cup edge
provides an extra push If the bending-actin constant is large enough this then leads
to complete engulfment Fig 4A The situation is markedly dierent for prolate
spheroids R1  R2 for which the high curvature stalling occurs at the beginning of
engulfment when there are relatively few receptor-ligand bonds The lack of bound
receptors means that there is little signalling and so little recruitment of actin In
such cases often both models fail to engulf
Figure 4 Results for spheroids in phagocytosis model A Engulfment times for
both half and full engulfment as a function of the bending-actin constant B1 for a
spheroid with R1  098m and R2  045m B1  0 corresponds to non-phagocytic
endocytosis and B1  0 to phagocytosis B The range of spheroids grey region that can
be engulfed as a function of the bending-actin constant R2 is always chosen so that the
surface area is the same as that of a 08m-radius sphere The dashed line represents the

For oblate spheroids we can examine the eect of the bending-actin constant on
engulfment time in cases where non-phagocytic endocytosis stalls around half way
Fig 4A Initially as B1 is increased there is still no engulfment However at
a critical onset about B1  0315m2 with the parameters in Fig 4A complete
engulfment occurs As B1 is increased still further the engulfment time rapidly
drops For values near the critical B1 value engulfment takes a long time with
the majority of time spent around half engulfment waiting for enough actin to be
recruited to the cup edge This suggests that certain shapes that appear to stall
around half way will actually fully ingest given a sucient amount of time
Finally we examine how the range of ingestible spheroids changes as the bending-
actin constant increases Fig 4B For any xed value of B1 there is always a limit
on which ellipsoids can be engulfed particles that are too oblate or too prolate
will never be ingested However these limits correspond to progressively more and
more eccentric spheroids as B1 increases From experimental measurements of which
ellipsoids can and cannot be engulfed it should be possible to infer the value of the
bending-actin constant Thus phagocytosis B1  0 allows not only larger particles
but also more eccentric particles to be ingested compared to other types of receptor-
mediated endocytosis B1  0 However our model suggests that there are always
suciently eccentrically shaped targets that can evade engulfment
2D model for noncircularly-symmetric particles
A limitation of the 1D model is that only circularly-symmetric particles can be
studied In particular this excludes general ellipsoids with all the axes dierent
lengths and even spheroids that are not presented tip-rst To study such shapes
we extend the above model to two dimensions which involves studying a 2D Stefan
problem We parameterise the surface by polar coordinates r and  with r  0
and 0    2 The receptor density is now described by r  t whereas the

for r  a As before   L within the cup The evolution of a can be derived
from the conservation of receptors which leads to the second part of Eq 1 being
replaced by
D  n
L  
where n is a unit outward-pointing normal to the cup surface The nal boundary
condition xing  again follows from requiring no free-energy jump across the
cup edge Although the derivation is more involved the nal condition is the same
as in the 1D model Eq 2 To nd solutions we developed a numerical approach
that involves a 2D lattice that must be continually updated as the cup enlarges see
Materials and Methods To test our numerics we checked that spherical particles
with constant curvature H  R1 agree with the analytic results from the 1D
We focus on studying ellipsoids which are parameterised by their three semi-
principal axes R1 R2 and R3 Fig 5A Since the cup does not proceed in unison
around the particle dierent angles engulf at dierent rates there is now no unique
denition of half engulfment We consider two denitions half-area engulfment
when the engulfed area is half the ellipsoid surface area and half-circumference en-
gulfment when all points of the cup are over half way to the top of the particle Half-
area engulfment always occurs before or at the same time as half-circumference
engulfment
As an example of engulfment consider an ellipsoid with R1  R3  R2 which
is a lying-down prolate spheroid as in the rst gure in Fig 1B if it was lying on its
side see Video S1 The lack of circular symmetry when viewed from above means
that engulfment now proceeds at dierent rates at dierent angles In particular
consider   0 compared to   
2  corresponding to the two principal axes parallel
to the membrane Cup progression at   0 proceeds along a circle of radius R1
with constant curvature H0 Conversely the cup edge at   
2 follows an ellipse
with the curvature starting at H0 rising to a maximum at half-way and then
decreasing back to H0 In addition the total arc length along   
2 is longer
than that along   0 so that the   
2 direction must engulf more membrane to
reach full engulfment
As seen in Fig 5B and Video S1 the   
2 direction takes considerably longer to
engulf This is partly due to both the greater curvature along   
2 and the greater
arc length However there is another more important reason that slows engulfment
at   
2 compared to   0 which is only revealed in the full 2D simulation
Once   
2 starts to lag behind   0 due to higher curvature angular diusion
diusion in the  direction causes even more receptors to move away from   
and towards   0 This increases the ux at   0 so that the   
2 direction
slips even further behind   0 amplifying the eect This amplication explains
why engulfment takes so much longer at   
2  This eect may also explain the
asymmetric spreading over ellipsoidal particles in 4
For the rst time to our knowledge we are now able to compare spheroids
presented to the cell with dierent orientations To do this we compare spheroids
with radii R1 R2 R3   R R R to those with R1 R2 R3   R R R We
refer to the rst case as a symmetrically-presented spheroid since from above this
spheroid has circular symmetry and the second case as an asymmetrically-presented
spheroid For a given R we always choose R to keep constant surface area the surface
area of a sphere with radius 04m This allows us to directly compare spheroids
with dierent eccentricities Fig 5C shows the results for the total engulfment
time Both symmetrically- and asymmetrically-presented spheroids demonstrate
the expected characteristic behaviour with quickest engulfment corresponding to
some intermediate spheroid more squashed or more pointed ellipsoids take longer
to engulf with suciently eccentric shapes never reaching complete engulfment
Further the symmetrically-presented spheroid always engulfs rst both for prolate
and oblate spheroids This is due to the amplication of angular diusion described
above where the   
2 angle for asymmetrically-presented spheroids takes much
longer to engulf than   0
For symmetrically-presented spheroids we nd as we should similar results to
those for spheroids in the 1D model For xed surface area the sphere is not the
optimal shape Rather slightly oblate spheroids R  R engulf faster This is
true not only for the total engulfment time but also for the half-area and half-
circumference engulfment times which are always equal for such a shape Con-
versely for asymmetrically-presented spheroids the sphere always corresponds to
quickest total engulfment This again is caused by the amplication eect which
penalises non-symmetric shapes The half-circumference engulfment time which
requires all angles to have reached half-engulfment is also a minimum for spheres
Fig S5B However the situation is dierent for the half-area engulfment time
where prolate spheroids R  R reach half-area engulfment sooner than spheres
Fig S5A
Thus our 2D model leads to three important conclusions for spheroids First
prolate spheroids engulf quickest when presented to the membrane tip-rst which
agrees with previous phagocytic measurements 4 and is a prediction for other types
of endocytosis Suciently spherical targets will completely engulf in either orien-
tation whereas targets that are too eccentric are not engulfed in any orientation
This could well explain the observation in 4 where the membrane sometimes only
spreads along the target with no internalisation However there also exists an inter-
mediate regime where prolate spheroids are engulfed only when one of the highly-
curved tips is engulfed rst Although in phagocytosis this orientation dependence
can be explained by adding active processes and a second engulfment stage to the
1D model 28 our 2D model shows that this for all types of endocytosis can

also be understood simply by receptor diusion Second we predict that oblate
spheroids engulf quickest when presented at to the membrane This nding is
perhaps surprising since it is then the low curvature region that is engulfed rst
and last rather than the highly-curved tips as for prolate spheroids Hence oblate
and prolate spheroids have completely dierent engulfment behaviours even for su-
percially similar shapes such as the two standing spheroids in Fig 5C Further
experiments with spheroidal targets should help clarify this prediction Third the
2D model predicts that the absolute quickest engulfment for a spheroid with xed
surface area occurs for a slightly oblate spheroid that lies at with respect to the
membrane The last nding is conrmed by Sharma et al for macrophages 35
Discussion
In analogy with the freezing of water as described by the heat equation with a mov-
ing boundary we used a minimal model of receptor diusion and capture to study
shape and orientation dependence during endocytosis The process of engulfment is
then equivalent to a rst-order phase transition characterised by a transition from
mobile unbound receptors to immobile ligand-bound receptors By including sig-
nalling and a role of actin we were then able to adapt our model to phagocytosis
and examine the dierent role shape plays for receptor-mediated endocytosis and
phagocytosis
We both extended a previous 1D model to include nonspherical targets and de-
veloped a more realistic 2D version allowing lower-symmetry particles to be studied
The 1D model shows that a whole host of engulfment behaviours emerge from dif-
ferent particle types This supports the idea that the local curvature at the cup edge
is a crucial factor in determining whether and how quickly targets are engulfed

factors that at least partially drive the evolution of pathogen shapes We found
that for some shapes such as capped cylinders the more spherical the target the
quicker the engulfment whereas for other shapes such as spheroids nonspherical
particles can be engulfed faster Thus long narrow lamentous shapes could in some
situations be more benecial for pathogens that try to avoid ingestion Further our
hourglass-shaped particles also explain the observation that phagocytosis of budded
yeast can stall at half engulfment 1 30
The 2D model allowed for the rst time to our knowledge the orientation de-
pendence of engulfment to be probed We found that for nonspherical targets
engulfment can sometimes proceed at completely dierent rates in dierent direc-
tions with higher-curved directions engulng much slower This should be directly
observable with for example scanning electron microscopy Further we discov-
ered that this eect can explain the experimental observation that prolate spheroids
phagocytose quickest when presented to the cell tip-rst 4 In addition the 2D
model predicts both that oblate spheroids engulf fastest when presented at to the
cell and that slightly oblate spheroids can engulf even faster than the equivalent
sphere These perhaps counterintuitive results could readily be tested in the near
future
Although phagocytosis is distinct to other forms of receptor-mediated endocyto-
sis the role of receptors and their motion towards the cup is equally important 28
By adding signalling and a simple role for actin our models predict that all types
of endocytosis including phagocytosis have similar shape dependence In addition
we found that phagocytosis not only fulls its traditional role of allowing larger
particles to be ingested but also allows more highly-curved targets to be engulfed
It is important to point out the limitations of our models We have focussed only
on passive diusion of receptors neglecting more active receptor motion 15 16
Further in our phagocytosis model we have only included one signalling molecule
and have added actin in a highly-simplied manner without any attempt to model
the underlying structure of the cytoskeleton Although these simplications will not
capture many aspects of endocytosis it is likely that the interplay between target
and hence membrane curvature and the motion of receptors is correctly represented
even in our minimal models Our phagocytosis model also assumes that signalling
reduces the membrane bending modulus eectively making bending around highly
curved objects easier An alternative model representation could have focussed
on forces instead of receptor dynamics so that for example signalling and actin
polymerisation would lead to a membrane pushing force Taking spatial derivatives
of the cup energy would translate our energy-based model to a force-based model 6
Finally we have assumed that targets do not rotate during engulfment It would
be interesting to also include this in our models which would then allow further
questions such as the stability of dierent orientations to be addressed
Shape dependence is a fascinating aspect of endocytosis which is probably even
more important for successful engulfment than target size 4 Understanding the
role of shape may also have direct applications to for example how some pathogens
invade cells 36 how other pathogens avoid uptake the optimal design for drug
delivery carriers 37 38 and even cell behaviour 39 We have shown that there is
great variety in the uptake of dierent target shapes which is also heavily orientation
dependent Future work using dierently coated particles will need to address how
geometric mechanical and chemical signals are integrated to explain the wide range
of observed engulfment outcomes
Materials and Methods
1D numerical simulations
For nonspherical particles even the 1D model must be solved numerically We used
a grid with spacing r  01m and total length L  50m Eq 1 was solved
using the Euler method with time step t  1  103s At each time step we also
imposed the boundary condition at t   which involves rst calculating the
mean curvature at the cup edge and solving Eq 2 We checked convergence by
showing that smaller values of r and t did not noticeably change the results
2D numerical simulations
Our 2D numerical solutions were calculated on a 2D grid with r  25nm and
  8 The maximum radius was set at 20m The area of each lattice point
was no longer constant but depended on r a fact that had to be taken into account
We solved Eqs 6 and 7 with the usual Euler method using t  25 106s At
a given time t and angle  the normal to the cup surface was estimated from a t
and a   t Similarly  was estimated as a nite dierence Updating the
cup edge normally moved a away from the discrete -lattice points n Linear
interpolation was then performed to move them back Finally for each point on the
cup edge the mean curvature was calculated giving a value for  which was then
imposed as a boundary condition
