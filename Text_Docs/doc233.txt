ABSTRACT
Intrinsic emission and absorption lines of QSOs provide several independent probes of the
metal abundances in QSO environments They indicate that the metallicities are typically
solar or higher out to redshifts z  4 These results support models of galaxy evolution where
galactic nuclei or dense condensations that later become galactic nuclei form stars and evolve
quickly at redshifts higher than the QSOs themselves
Introduction
Measuring the heavy-element abundances near QSOs can provide unique constraints on
high-redshift star formation and galaxy evolution In particular QSO abundances reect the
evolution characteristics of galactic nuclei or dense proto-galactic condensations at high redshifts
 perhaps involving the rst generations of stars formed after the Big Bang The QSO results will
therefore complement other studies of high-redshift galaxies that probe more extended structures
andor rely on very dierent data and analyses techniques Combining the QSO abundance work
with the other studies involving for example the Lyman-break galaxies and damped-Ly
absorbers should yield a more complete picture of star formation and galaxy evolution at early
epochs
Three general independent probes of QSO abundances are readily observable at all redshifts
the broad emission lines BELs the broad absorption lines BALs and the intrinsic narrow
absorption lines NALs Each of these probes has its own theoretical and observational
uncertainties so it is essential to consider as many of them as possible I am now involved in
several projects to examine a wide range of abundance diagnostics in QSOs at dierent redshifts
and luminosities My principle collaborators are Drs T Barlow F Chaee G Ferland C Foltz

2 Results
BELs The broad emission lines have a major advantage in that they can be measured and
compared in large samples of QSOs using using moderate resolution spectra Line ratios involving
 2 
nitrogen are particularly valuable as tracers of the chemical enrichment because N is selectively
enhanced by secondary processing in stellar populations increasing roughly as Z 2 for at least
Z  02Z see 1019 Hamann  Ferland 9104 used extensive photoionization calculations to
show that the broad emission-line ratio NV 1240HeII 1640 provides lower limits on the NHe
abundances This abundance sensitivity occurs because the NV and HeII lines form together
within the He zone NV can be relatively weak for some nebular parameters eg gas density
ionizing ux and continuum shape etc but it is not possible to produce large NVHeII ratios
without increasing NHe The same calculations show that NVCIV 1549 can be an indicator of
Applying this analysis to observed NVHeII and NVCIV ratios in QSOs see also 8
together with simple considerations from galactic chemical evoltuion indicates that 1 QSOs out
to z  4 typically have solar or higher metallicities 2 the stellar initial mass function favors
massive stars slightly more than in the solar neighborhood and 3 the enrichment timescales
are 1 Gyr for at least the z  4 sources if o  1 Similar evolution characteristics have
been inferred from the old stellar populations in present-day elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges
vigorous star formation in those environments should produce gas-phase abundances above solar
at early cosmological epochs The present-day stellar populations represent an integral over all
previous gas-phase abundances and therefore have lower average metallicities There is also a
trend in the NV line ratios suggesting that more luminous QSOs have higher metal abundances
10 13 If QSO luminosities are tied to the mass of their host galaxies eg 12 this tentative
luminosity-metallicity trend could derive from a mass-metallicity relation among QSO hosts that
is analogous or identical to the well-known relationship in nearby galaxies
NALs Abundance estimates from QSO absorption lines are in principle more straightforward
than the emission lines because the line strengths are not sensitive to the gas densities or
temperatures Moreover absorption lines yield direct measures of the column densities in dierent
ions One has only to apply appropriate ionization corrections to convert the column densities
into relative abundances For example the abundance ratio for any two elements a and b can be
written as
bcid21  log  N ai
cid20 a
N bj  logcid18 f bj
f aicid19  logcid18 b
acid19
where ba is the solar abundance ratio and N and f are respectively the column densities
and ionization fractions of elements a and b in ion states i and j Ideally one has abundance-
independent constraints on the ionization fractions from the column densities of dierent ions of
the same element Otherwise we can also constrain the ionization by comparing column densities
in dierent elements with some assumption about their relative abundance If there is a range
of ionization states or a complete lack measured constraints eg
if only HI and CIV lines are
measured it is still possible to use minimum ionization correction factors to derive minimum
metal-to-hydrogen abundance ratios Hamann 5 plotted theoretical correction factors for a wide
variety of circumstances

A central issue in using NALs for abundance work is understanding the location of the
absorbing gas Some of the so-called associated or za  ze absorbers might reside very near
the QSOs perhaps in outows similar to BALs but others could form in the extended halo of the
host galaxy or in cosmologically intervening gas Every system must be examined individually
Several empirical tests have been developed to help identify NAL systems that are truly intrinsic
to QSO environments for example 1 time-variable line strengths 2 multiplet ratios that imply
partial line-of-sight coverage of the background light sources and 3 well-resolved line proles
that are smooth and broad compared to thermal line widths see 7 3 and references therein
I am in the midst of a program to identify intrinsic NALs and measure there abundances
In all three bonade intrinsic systems studied so far the metallicity is solar or higher see 7
8 This result agrees with the few other known cases of intrinsic NALs 14 20 and with the
preponderance of Z  Z results for general za  ze systems of uncertain origin 5171516
BALs The most surprising abundance results have come from studies of the BALs where
the strengths of the metal-lines compared to HI Ly seem to require metallicities for example
SiH from 20 to 100 times solar 185 The secure detections of broad PV 11181128
absorption in two BALQSOs 116 and tentative detections in two others suggest further that
phosphorus is highly overabundant with PC  60 and PH 1000 times solar see also 5 These
abundances particularly the high PC are not only in conict with the other diagnostics but
they are also incompatible with any enrichment scheme dominated by Types I or II supernovae or
CNO-processed material from stellar envelopes
Another possibility is that the BAL abundance estimates are simply incorrect Hamann 6
argued that the PV BAL has a signicant strength not because phosphorus is overabundant but
because the strong transitions like CIV NV and OVI are much more optically thick than they
appear Explicit calculations of the line optical depths assuming solar relative abundances show
that PV is the rst weak line to appear as the stronger transitions become more saturated The
strength of the PV BAL in PG 1254047 implies optical depths of for example 6 in Ly 25
in CIV and 80 in OVI for solar relative abundances These results indicate that the column
densities derived from the measured troughs are gross underestimates and consequently the true
abundances are unknown
BALs like CIV OVI and Ly might be optically thick while not reaching zero intensity
if the absorber covers just part of the continuum sources Furthermore dierent optically
thick lines can have dierent strengths and proles if their coverage fractions dier Note that
coverage fraction dierences between BALs that mimic simple optical depth or ionization eects
in observed spectra can occur naturally if the absorbing regions have a range of ionization states
or column densities There is already direct evidence for partial coverage and sometimes dierent
coverage fractions in dierent lines from the resolved multiplet ratios in the narrow components
of some BALs 2 21 and intrinsic NALs 3 5 7 and refs therein Partial coverage has also been
 4 
inferred from spectropolarimetry of BALQSOs We cannot measure the coverage fractions from
multiplet ratios in most BALs but I claim that the signicant strength of PV absorption signies
partial coverage and large line optical depths Strong support for this interpretation comes from
the only known NAL system with PV absorption where the resolved doublets clearly indicate
large optical depths and partial coverage in lines such as CIV NV and SiIV 1
Thus the true BAL abundances are unknown I am presently involved in a program to
obtain spectra of BALQSOs across a wide range of rest UV wavelengths Our goals are to 1
determine the general strength and frequency of PV absorption in BALQSOs and 2 see if some
BAL systems or some portions of BAL proles the high-velocity wings might still be useful for
abundance studies
3 Summary and Discussion
In spite of the null results from BALs a consensus is emerging from the BELs and intrinsic
NALs for typically solar or higher metallicities in high-redshift QSOs These results support models
of galaxy evolution wherein vigorous star formation in galactic nuclei or dense proto-galactic
condensations produces super-solar gas-phase metallicities at redshifts 4 High metal abundances
are a signature of deep gravitational potentials and thus massive galaxies or proto-galaxies because
only they can retain their gas long enough against the building thermal pressures from supernova
explosions The enriched gas might ultimately be ejected from the galaxy consumed by the black
hole or diluted by subsequent infall but the evidence for early-epoch high-Z gas remains in the
stars today In particular the mean stellar metallicities in the cores of nearby massive galaxies are
typically 1 to 3 Z The individual stars are distributed about these means with metallicities
reecting the gas-phase abundance at the time of their formation Only the most recently formed
stars at any epoch have metallicities as high as that in the gas Simple chemical evolution models
indicate that the gas-phase abundances in galactic nuclei should be 2 to 3 times larger than the
stellar means eg 2 to 9 Z near the end of the star-forming epoch see 10 5 and references
therein Therefore metallicities in the range 2  Z  9 Z can be expected in QSOs as long
as considerable star formation and enrichment occurs before the QSOs turn on or become
observable
