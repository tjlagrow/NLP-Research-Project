Abstract
Contradiction between Hawkings semi-classical arguments and the string theory on the evap-
oration of a black hole has been one of the most intriguing problems in fundamental physics A
nal-state boundary condition inside the black hole was proposed by Horowitz and Maldacena to
resolve this contradiction We point out that the original Hawking eect can also be regarded as a
separate boundary condition at the event horizon for this scenario Here we found that the change
of the Hawking boundary condition may aect the information transfer from the initial collaps-
ing matter to the outgoing Hawking radiation during the evaporation process and as a result the
evaporation process itself signicantly
The Hawking eect 1 2 on the information loss in a black hole has been a serious
challenge to modern physics because it contradicts the basic principles of quantum mechan-
ics Hawkings semi-classical argument predicts that a process of black hole formation and
evaporation is not unitary 3 On the other hand there is some evidence in string theory
that the formation and the evaporation of black hole is a unitary process 4 Nonetheless
the Hawking eect discovered nearly 30 years ago is generally accepted very credible and
considered as would be an essential ingredient of the yet unknown correct theory of quantum
gravity
Previously Horowitz and Maldacena HM proposed a nal-state boundary condition
4 to reconcile the unitarity of the black hole evaporation with Hawkings semi-classical
reasoning The essence of HM proposal is to impose a unique nal boundary condition at
the black hole singularity such that no information is absorbed by the singularity The nal
boundary state is a maximally entangled state of the collapsing matter and the infalling
Hawking radiation The projection of nal boundary state at the black hole singularity
collapses the state into one associated with the collapsing matter and transfer the information
to the outgoing Hawking radiation The HM model is further rened by including the
unitary interactions between the collapsing matter and the infalling Hawking radiation 5
with a random purication of the nal boundary state 6 One of the critical assumptions in
the HM proposal is that the internal quantum state of the black hole can be represented by a
maximally entangled state of the collapsing matter and the infalling Hawking radiation This
ansatz is important because the nal state boundary condition of the HM proposal is based
on this maximally entangled internal quantum state 4 5 Recently the author proved the
HM ansatz for the special case of a collapsing gravitational shell inside the Schwarzschild
black hole 7
In the HM model the boundary state outside the event horizon is assumed to be the
Unruh vacuum state 8 9 As a matter of fact Hawkings original discovery can be regarded
as imposing a boundary condition at the event horizon The author would like to denote it as
the Hawking boundary condition HBC in contrast with the nal-state boundary condition
FBC proposed by HM Fig 1 The HBC dictates that the quantum states inside and
outside the event horizon of the black hole are maximally entangled
Signicance of this
FIG 1 Penrose diagram of for the black hole formation and evaporation processes 9 The HBC
denotes the Hawking boundary conditions at the event horizon and the FBC denotes the nal-state
boundary condition inside the black hole J  and J  are the future and the past null innity
respectively
scenario is that the black hole formation and the evaporation process can be put into a
unied picture by combining the HBC together with the FBC
It would be an interesting question to ask whether the black hole evaporation process
will be aected by the boundary condition at the event horizon The boundary condition
on the event horizon would aect the nal state projection because the quantum states
inside and outside the event horizon are entangled by the HBC The purpose of this paper is
to demonstrate that the nal state boundary condition FBC of Horowitz and Maldacena
necessarily implies that the evaporation process depends on the boundary condition on the
horizon The author proceeds by assuming that a the original vacuum outside of a black
hole evolves into a maximally entangled state on Hin and Hout and then b the interior
state of the black hole is also a maximally entangled state on Hin and HM  where HM is
the Hilbert space for the collapsing matter The FBC is then applied to the latter state and
the outgoing radiation is obtained by projection of this onto the former state However if
one took a state in which a single boson is excited outside of the black hole as the Hawking
boundary condition then it too could be written as a maximally entangled state on Hin and
Hout - but the state of outgoing radiation that one would obtain via the FBC is dierent
from the state obtained from the vacuum state Hence one obtains the result that the nal
outgoing particle state for a black hole evaporation is dependent on the Hawking boundary
condition
We assume that the quantum state of the collapsing matter belongs to a Hilbert space
HM with dimension N and niM be the initial quantum state of the collapsing matter It is
also assumed that niM belongs to the set of orthonormal basis liM for HM  The Hilbert
space of uctuations on the background spacetime for black hole formation and evaporation
is separated into Hin and Hout which contain quantum states localized inside and outside the
event horizon respectively In HM proposal the HBC is assumed to be the Unruh vacuum
state 0iinout belonging to Hin  Hout
in a micro-canonical form 4 5 6 7
0iinout

where liin and liout are orthonormal bases for Hin and Hout  respectively The nal-
state boundary condition FBC imposed at the singularity requires a maximally entangled
quantum state in HM  Hin which is called the nal boundary state and is given by

Mhl  inhlS  I 
where S is a unitary transformation The initial matter state niM evolves into a state in
HM  Hin  Hout under HBC which is given by 0iM inout  niM  0iinout  Then
the transformation from the quantum state of collapsing matter to the state of outgoing
Hawking radiation is given by the following nal state projection 6

that outhiTniM  in  The quantum state of the collapsing matter is transferred to the

I would like to note that we can also regard T  as a tunnelling Hamiltonian 10 and the
evaporation rate will be proportional to 2

FIG 2 The Kruskal extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime 9 13
In the region I null
asymptotes H and H act as the future and the past horizon respectively The boundary lines
labeled J  and J  are the future and the past null innity respectively and i0 is the spacelike
innity
Now we consider the case of imposing the Unruh excited state as the HBC on the black
hole evaporation problem The Unruh vacuum state is evolved unitarity from the vacuum
state dened in the far past such as the past null innity J  4 Fig 2 Lets denote 0i
and a as the vacuum state and the annihilation operator of a particle respectively at the
past null innity 15 and V is the unitary operator responsible for the evolution of the
vacuum state 0i  Then we have
0iinout  V 0i
with a0i  0
We now dene the one-particle state with a nite energy at the past null innity by 1i
which is given by
Then the unitary evolution of this one-particle state at the future null innity is given by
1i  a0i
V 1i  V a0i
 V aV 1V 0i
 V aV 10iinout
The Unruh excited state at the future null innity is then obtained by applying the Bogoli-
ubov transformation 9 11 12 13 on the Unruh vacuum state and is given by

where b
out is the boson creation operator outside the black hole bin is the boson annihilation
operator inside the black hole and CN is the normalization factor At later times one
can choose a spacelike slice that goes through the future horizon The horizon divides this
spacelike hypersurface into two parts one inside and one outside the horizon 4 As a
result the Hilbert space can be separated into two parts Hin and Hout which contain wave
functions localized inside or ouside the horizon Here the operator b
out corresponds to the
operater b of Parkers work 15 which operates on a particle at the future null innity
On the other hand the operator bin annihilates a particle incoming at the future horizon
H  corresponding to the operator c of reference 15 In Eq 8 we assumed the density
operator 1 out  T rin1iinouth1 has a unit trace

the subscript K denotes the Kruskal spacetime  the postive frequency of the normal mode
and r denotes the squeezing parameter 16 In the latter the Bogoliubov transformation
was derived from an explicit wave packet basis and an analysis was carried out by taking into
account the real physical properties of the state One may regard the Bogoliubov transforma-
tion for the micro-canonical ensemble used in the paper as a limiting case of the Bogoliubov
transformation in the Schwarzschild-Kruskal spacetime for which a timelike Killing vector
associated with Kruskal coordinates is well dened for certain regions or boundary lines
But they are not unique For example 
u is a timelike Killing vector on H 13 In our
simplied model the momenta or the frequencies of the particles are not specied explicitly
but we assume that the Unruh excited state contains a particle of nite energy From the
above equation one can see that 1iinout
a state in which a particle is created outside the black hole Then the initial matter state
niM evolves into a state 1iM inout in HM  Hin  Hout under the HBC which is given
by 1iM inout  niM  1iin The nal state projection yields

Gottesman and Preskill considered the generalization of HM proposal by considering the
unitary interaction U acting on HM  Hin  ie the Hilbert space of the collapsing matter
and the infalling Hawking radiation 5 In their generalization the nal boundary state is
given by
M inh 
Mhl  inhlS  IU 
where the unitary transformation U takes into account the interactions of the collapsing
matter with the quantum eld uctuations after the horizon crossing but before the arrival
at the singularity Then one might ask the following question Is the Unruh excited state
given by eq 8 essentially a special case of what one would get upon the unitary interaction
between the collapsing matter and the Hawking radiation given by the generalized HM model
given by eq 11 Mathematically U is acting on HM  Hin and the HBC is prescribed on
Hin Hout so they are operating on dierent Hilbert spaces Moreover the HBC is prepared
in the innite past and logically U is supposed to be turned on after the HBC is prescribed
In order to answer this we consider the following transformations
T1  M inh1iinout
NN 2  1Xl
l  1l  1ioutMhlS
T2  M inh0iinout
iioutMhlSinhlUiiin
In eqs 12 and 13 two states belong to Hin are contracted with each other In order to
make T1 and T2 equivalent to each other the matrix U should be of the following form
U  IM  Uin
l1i
Uinli r 2Nl  1
N 2  1
Now the question is whether U is unitary or more specically Uin is unitary From
N 21 mn
inUinmn  nq 2N
 it is obvious both Uin and U are not unitary The Unruh
vacuum state 0iinout and the excited state 1iinout which comprise the HBCs in Hin 
Hout are not unitarily equivalent to each other and therefore the unitary transformation U
which makes T1 and T2 equivalent does not exist Exact calculations of f0 and f1 require
a detailed knowledge of the unitary transformation S so the direct comparison would be
dicult at present However we can make a rough estimation using a rened HM model
which employs a random pure state as the FBC 6
where l is the Schmidt coecient for random state whose distribution is presumed to be
iM in Xl
lliM  liin 
known 17 Random FBC also takes into account the stochastic interaction of the collapsing
matter and the infalling Hawking radiation 5 Substituting Eq 16 into Eq 3 yields
M inh0iM inout  Xlj
l Mhl  inhlniM
N jiin  jiout
nN niout
  0iout
By normalizing  0iout  we obtain the state of outgoing Hawking radiation which is given
Then the delity of information transfer for the Unruh vacuum state is given by
0iout 
pn2niout
f0  outh0T niM2  n2
n2  1
Likewise by substituting eq 16 into eq 8 we obtain
M inh1iM inout  Xlj
l Mhl  inhlniMr 2J  1
N 2  1 n  1iout
nr 2j  1
 
  1iout
N 2  1 jiin  j  1iout
By normalizing  1iout we obtain the state of outgoing Hawking radiation which is given
1iout 
which is orthogonal to 0iout
pn2n  1iout
The delity of information transfer for the Unruh excited state is then given by
f1  outh1T niM2  
2outhn  1T niM2  0
In Eq 19 and Eq 22 we assumed 0iinout and 1iinout respectively as the HBC
In this model the delity for the information transfer from the collapsing matter to the
outgoing Hawking radiation is zero As a result the evaporation rate may be also suppressed
when the Unruh excited state is taken as the HBC
In general the delity f1 would be in the range
0  f1

It would be interesting to consider if one could modify the HM proposal so that the informa-
tion loss does not occur for the Unruh excited state The answer could be yes but since the
Unruh vacuum state 0iinout and the excite state 1iinout are not unitarily equivalent to
each other then the information loss may occur for the Unruh vacuum state under a new
HM proposal ie the nal-state boundary condition
Now we would like to see whether the introduction of the Unruh excited state would cause
outbout0iinout and
any regularization problem In order to do that we calculate inouth0b
inouth1b
outbout1iinout  the latter is given by
By the way

Substituting eqs 25 and 26 into eq 24 we obtain
inouth1b
outbout1iinout

3N 2  1
Comparing eqs 25 and 27 we can see that the Unruh excited state does not cause any
additional regularization problem as compared with the Unruh vacuum state at least within
the mathematical frame we employed in this paper
Eqs 22 and 23 indicate that the presence of matter near the event horizon would
suppress the transfer of information from the collapsing matter to the outgoing Hawking
radiation As a result the evaporation of black hole may be aected by the boundary
condition as well
The Unruh vacuum state can be described by the condition that a free fall observer
crossing the horizon long after the black hole forms would presumably see no very high
positive free fall frequency excitations 18 On the other hand the Unruh excited state
turns out to be the nal state of the system corresponding to the state starting initially
with particles very near the instant of the black hole formation rst studied by Wald 19
The Unruh excited state dened by eq 8 is mathematically equivalent to eq212 of the
reference 19
From eqs 7 25 and 27 the Unruh excited state at the future null innity in a
micro-canonical form seems to contain a particle of nite energy Thus we can see that the
HM proposal especially the nal state boundary condition also allows the Unruh excited
state as a boundary condition and is consistent with the previous analysis 19 20
Unfortunately changing the Hawking boundary condition of a black hole from the Unruh
vacuum state to the Unruh excited state would be nontrivial and may require extremely
high-energy excitations nonetheless Certainly this is beyond the capability of near future
civilization On the other hand in quantum optics the excitation of the Unruh excited
state can be done by the single photon excitation of the two-mode squeezed state 16
The primordial black holes in the early universe submerged in a dense soup of high energy
particles might have the Unruh excited state as the HBC and as a result have longer lifetime
than the lifetime predicted by Hawking 2 Those surviving primordial black holes may
be part of the dark matter in our universe
It has not escaped the authors notice that
equations 4 and 9 also suggest the information exchange with a black hole 21 may not
be strictly forbidden in principle by modulating the HBC
