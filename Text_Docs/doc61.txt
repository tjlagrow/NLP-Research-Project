1Most of the background for this paper is drawn from experiences with the development of the Penman Upper
Model an ontology for supporting natural language generation The Upper Model has been under development
since 1985 and many have and continue to contribute to it The ideas I report on here would not have been possible
without that development Those responsible for the present form of the Upper Model include William Mann
Christian Matthiessen Robert Kasper Richard Whitney Johanna Moore Eduard Hovy Yigal Arens and myself
Introduction
The development of natural language process-
ing henceforth nlp systems has reached
the stage where concentrated eorts are nec-
essary in the area of representing more ab-
stract more knowledge-related bodies of in-
formation
It has been accepted that with-
out substantial bodies of background infor-
mation concerning commonsense everyday
knowledge about the world or detailed in-
formation concerning particular domains of
application
it will not be possible to con-
struct systems that can support the use of
natural
Systems need to repre-
sent concrete details of the worlds that their
texts describe for example the resolution of
anaphors the induction of text coherence by
recognizing regularities present in the world
and not in the text the recognition of plans
by knowing what kinds of plans make sense for
speakers and hearers in real situations etc all
require world modelling to various depths
language
This need creates two interrelated problem
areas The rst problem is how knowledge
of the world  be it general commonsense
knowledge or specialized knowledge concern-
ing some particular domain  is to be rep-
resented The second problem is how such
organizations of knowledge are to be related
to linguistic system levels of organization such
as grammar and lexis For both problem ar-
eas the concept of ontologies for nlp has
been suggested to be of potential value Very
generally an ontology oers a conceptual
framework for the representation of informa-
tion  a framework that is suciently gen-
eral but also suciently detailed to provide
a rich supportive scaolding for the construc-
tion of models of the world The design of
such ontologies constitutes an area of concern
that is coming to be known as ontological en-
gineering eg Nirenburg and Raskin 1987
Lenat and Guha 1988 Simmons 1991 As
we shall see below most systems that deal
currently with nlp already adopt some kind
of ontology for their more abstract levels of
information However theoretical principles
for the design and development of ontologies
meeting the goals of generality and detail re-
main weak This is due not only to a lack
of theoretical accounts at these more raried
abstract levels of information but also to the
co-existence of a range of sometimes poorly
dierentiated functions such bodies of infor-
mation are expected to fulll
The following list gives an idea of the range
of functions adopted in nlp Ontologies are
often expected to fulll at least one and often
more of
 organizing world knowledge
 organizing the world itself
 organizing meaning or semantics of
natural language expressions
 providing an interface between system
external components domain models
etc and nlp linguistic components
 ensuring expressability of input expres-
 oering an interlingua for machine trans-
lation
 supporting the construction of concep-
tual dictionaries
Moreover an ontology is seen as a very gen-
eral organizational device ie one that pro-
vides a classication system for whatever area
of application the ontology is applied to The
organizational resource oered by an ontology
has to be re-usable But it is an open issue as
to what extent the kinds of organization listed
here overlap It cannot be taken for granted
that they all refer to the same level of ab-
stract description
It can also not be taken
for granted that there is unity concerning the
tasks that are involved in such descriptions
This can be seen in the following statement
from Hobbs
Semantics is the attempted specica-
tion of the relation between language
and the world However this requires
a theory of the world There is a spec-
trum of choices one can make in this
regard At one end of the spectrum 
lets say the right end  one can adopt
the correct theory of the world the
one given by quantum mechanics and
the other sciences If one does this se-
mantics becomes impossible because it
is no less than all of science   Theres
too much of a mismatch between the
way we view the world and the way
the world really is At the left end
one can assume a theory of the world
that is isomorphic to the way we talk
about it
   Most activity in seman-
tics today is slightly to the right of
the extreme left end of this spectrum
   it fails to move far enough away
from language to represent signicant
progress towards the right end of the
spectrum Hobbs 1985 p68
It probably does not make sense therefore
to talk of a generalized classication system
without rst xing more precisely the nature
of its intended function A further problem is
that the rst of the desired functions above
organizing world knowledge is often taken to
be denitional for an ontology2 However the
world  ie psychological logical or philo-
sophical views of the world  has not proved
to be very constraining as to what knowledge
organizations it requires Ontologies built on
the basis of such constraints are as we shall
see below underconstrained and there has ac-
cordingly been no achievement of the large
scale resources necessary for re-use across nlp
systems
The main purpose of this paper is to add
a further round of discussion to that con-
cerning the design and construction of ontolo-
gies for nlp The paper is explicitly explo-
rative building on experience in the denition
and use of such ontologies for text generation
The paper is intended to stimulate discussion
rather than present solutions  although I
do conclude with suggestions for certain lines
of theoretically motivated methodological de-
velopment for future ontologies The basic
path taken in the paper will be to dierenti-
ate among the distinct functions that ontolo-
gies may serve in order to be better able to set
out principles and constraints for the design of
abstract levels of knowledge organization that
can serve as ontologies appropriate for nlp
Seen in more detail the paper is organized as
follows
First I discuss the role of language as a pos-
sible motivating force for designing and pop-
ulating ontologies Second I introduce sev-
eral of the most extensive ontologies that are
currently to be found in nlp systems char-
acterizing their precise function and motiva-
tion within their respective systems Third
I relate the distinct types of ontology discov-
2Or the second may be claimed to be the real task
 however as Hobbs points out this actually comes
closer to the rst position
ered to possible general linguistic theories that
would support them It is my contention that
many principles of organization follow directly
from the position of suggested bodies of infor-
mation in the linguistic system as a whole and
that recognizing this allows eorts in the def-
inition and construction of such bodies of or-
ganization to be directed more appropriately
than has hitherto been the case For any on-
tology that is proposed therefore it should
be possible to relate its properties back to a
motivating linguistic theory I argue that the
evidence that we now have from the more ex-
tensive attempts at ontology construction sug-
gests strongly that a richly stratied model
of the linguistic system is required in order
to achieve the degree of constraint that we
need for attacking large-scale re-usable on-
tology construction Fourth I show how the
ontology of the Penman text generation sys-
tem  that has been developed largely as
an instantiation of the highly stratied the-
ory of systemic-functional linguistics  al-
ready answers many of the criticisms that
have been raised against other ontologies I
argue that although these criticisms are of-
ten based on largely post hoc methodological
grounds the vast majority of them also fol-
low directly from the properties of the linguis-
tic system and so could and arguably should
have been made prior to attempting ontology
construction This can be seen in the proper-
ties of the Penman ontology whose very de-
sign avoids signicant criticisms levelled else-
where Finally I suggest how ontology de-
sign could be improved yet further by taking
into consideration more input from linguistic
theory The Penman ontology for example
is only a partial instantiation of the theoret-
ical principles underlying it and it is possible
to show that problems enter into the account
precisely where the ontology falls short of the
theoretical specication
In general then this paper is intended not
only to improve our understanding of what
kinds of bodies of information can stand as
ontologies of various kinds and how such bod-
ies of information relate to other resources in
the computational representation of the lin-
guistic system but also to make the point that
appropriate views of the rich dimensions of or-
ganization exhibited by the linguistic system
can go a long way to improving our initial
design specications for nlp systems They
should therefore always be considered very
early on in system construction and computa-
tional theory development
2 The role of language in
ontology justication
As mentioned above the move to consider nlp
systems that require information over and be-
yond that attributable to surface syntax has
raised two problems how to organize that in-
formation and how to relate that information
with the less abstract levels of the linguistic
system The rst problem is typically consid-
ered in more detail in approaches where the
operation of a system in some specied do-
main is the central goal the second usually
arises in systems which attempt to model the
linguistic system itself focusing less closely on
the embedding in any particular specied do-
main of application
One common source for knowledge con-
struction and representation that is found in
approaches to the rst problem is earlier work
in articial intelligence ai Even early ai
reasoning programs needed to represent the
state of the world in which the programs were
to operate This has given rise to the ar-
eas of domain modelling and common-
sense reasoning which are responsible for
representing concrete details of aspects of the
world The enterprise of world modelling
clearly has many similarities with the require-
ments of sophisticated nlp systems and there
has naturally been an inux of techniques and
attitudes concerning ontology design from the
ai context
This has proved most successful
cross-over of techniques of knowledge rep-
resentation in ai to techniques for repre-
senting linguistic information
The simi-
larity between structured inheritance knowl-
edge representation languages such as kl-
one Brachman and Schmolze 1985 and its
descendents and current typed feature logics
Smolka 1989
Smolka and Ait-Kaci 1989
Nebel et al 1991 is an active area of re-
search A basic model for the representation
of ontologies can now assume minimally that
a subsumption lattice over sorts is dened
probably with some mechanism correspond-
ing to the structured inheritance of role in-
formation associated with the sorts and pos-
sibly additional axioms or particular infer-
ences licenced by specied combinations of
sorts This will be the representational basis
for ontologies of all kinds that I will assume
throughout this paper
In contrast to this concensus attempts to
decide exactly which sorts make sense for
an ontology based on ai
knowledge engi-
neering principles have been less successful
Although the eort-intensive nature of do-
main modelling naturally calls for consider-
ation of the re-usability of components of
the knowledge represented across distinct do-
mains the ability of ai-centered approaches
to come up with such general organiza-
tions has been limited
Some of the ear-
liest work in this area was that on naive
physics
Hayes 1979 Hayes 1985
here the aim was to capture the under-
lying general knowledge that people have
about physical objects and substances in
the world similar investigations are reported
Hobbs and Moore 1985
Hobbs et al 1987 and there are naturally
also connections to be drawn with other work
in semantic and conceptual representation in
ai eg Schank and Abelson 1977 Further
good examples of systems that require de-
tailed real knowledge in particular domains
are expert systems here also there is still lit-
tle shareability across domain models The
detailed organization of such systems knowl-
edge is typically unique to particular applica-
tion domains and shows relatively little cross-
domain re-usability
for example
We can in part explain this by consider-
ing the relative importance assigned to the
distinct functions that such domain models
in ai are to fulll For example when con-
structing a knowledge source whose primary
function is to support the particular inferences
that a given system needs to draw it is log-
ical that the organization of that knowledge
be tailored with this goal in mind This usu-
ally leads however to nongeneralizeable rep-
resentational requirements because the infer-
ences that distinct systems are to draw have
not been related The relatively small scale of
most of this work to date has furthermore lim-
ited the eectiveness and urgency of investiga-
tions into re-usability the cost of construct-
ing domain models from scratch has not been
The most
scaolding for
extensive attempt
prohibitively high This cost-equation quickly
changes once more realistically sized bodies
of information are considered It quickly be-
comes much more important that detailed or-
ganizations of general knowledge applicable to
many domains are available so as to reduce the
work involved when moving to new domains
to cre-
ate a general
represent-
ing general background knowledge of the
world based on ai techniques is the cyc
project Lenat and Guha 1988 The size of
this project initial projections were for a base
level of 10000000 entries of necessity forces
a sharp awareness of the need to have an or-
ganization for knowledge that is detailed and
general enough to provide sucient scaold-
ing for supporting large-scale bodies of infor-
mation in accessible and usable ways With-
out clear principles both for the organiza-
tion of such knowledge and for the selection
of the information to be represented the re-
sult would be disastrous poorly organized
knowledge will be inadequate both theoreti-
cally in that it fails to capture signicant gen-
eralizations and practically in that it fails
to be usable as a resource The procedure
followed in cyc is to divide up types of en-
tities into categories that appear to behave
dierently ie concepts are classied accord-
ing to the kinds of inferences that they al-
low to be drawn about themselves Problem-
atic here therefore is precisely which kinds
of inferences are to be taken as denitional
This does not appear to have been made ex-
plicit and so the procedure does not provide a
particularly sound methodology The result-
ing domain-independent and hence re-usable
portion of the cyc ontology is accordingly not
very deep somewhat tangled and supports
limited inferences
It then becomes increas-
ingly necessary to raise questions concerning
the consistency of distinct areas of knowledge
represented and consequently how one can
use that knowledge
It needs to be recognized that it is essen-
tial to dene the purpose for which a body of
information is to be used in order to dene ap-
propriate organizations for that information
As long as the purposes are unclear or too
varied consistent organizations will be di-
cult to achieve The statement that a general
ontology of real-world knowledge should sim-
ply represent that knowledge is underspec-
ied It does not provide sucient guidance
for nding useful organizations for that knowl-
edge Given that we need a general organiza-
tion and that that organization will be deter-
mined by purpose we clearly need a very gen-
eral but still formally speciable task that
requires particular inferences to be performed
If it were possible to nd such a task then
it would be possible to use it as a guiding
methodology for constructing general organi-
zations of knowledge Precisely one such gen-
eral task is of course the expression of knowl-
edge in natural language whatever the knowl-
edge that is represented ie whatever do-
main and however generalspecic it should
be possible to express that knowledge linguis-
tically3 One additional set of constraints that
one can apply in the construction of organiza-
tions of knowledge that attempt maximal ap-
plicability across domains is then that oered
by language
This must be specied further For ex-
ample the acceptance of ways of talking
about categories as evidence for the existence
of those categories in an ontology is a very old
strategy eg Aristotle and is present even in
cyc This method of justication is however
limited to seeing what one can say and still
make sense about a category rather than any
more technical analysis of linguistic proper-
ties The precise inferences that are being re-
lied upon to shape the organization are there-
fore still not being given Thus there are ex-
amples of ontologies that are constructed in
nlp systems where there is a specied rela-
tionship between concepts and linguistic ex-
pression but the relationship is suciently
non-general so as not to provide strong con-
straints on ontology design
One such case is the ontology of kbmt
projects Carbonell and Tomita 1987 such as
translator Nirenburg and Raskin 1987
Work of this kind seeks a level of represen-
tation that is minimally dierent across dis-
tinct languages Moreover the value of or-
ganizations of information that are relevant
across distinct domains is clearly recognized
3This is overstated to the extent that some in-
formationknowledge is often maintained to be inex-
pressible linguistically  even if this is so it is still the
case that by far the widest and most generally appli-
cable form of expression that we know is language In
any case whether or not there exists knowledge that
is inexpressible linguistically will not aect the nal
outcome of the discussion below
and re-usable ontology portions are actively
sought However although the link to lan-
guage ensured by the machine translation
task increases the likelihood that this can be
achieved on a larger scale the re-usable por-
tions of the ontologies proposed until now re-
main small This can in part be attributed
to the fact that the appeal made to language
as a constraining force on ontology design is
undervalued4 The external-to-language at-
titude towards ontological constructs assumed
from ai promises to capture abstract models
of the world or of conceptions of the world 
a dierence that is not criterial at this point
and its organization independent of particu-
lar languages This appears a tempting di-
rection for achieving interlinguality But then
we nd motivations such as the following for
the categories that are to be adopted within
an interlingual ontology
Russian has no word that corresponds
exactly to the English word aord as
in I cant aord X or I cant aord to
Y In a multilingual processing envi-
roment there might be a concept cor-
responding to a sense of the English
word aord A Russian sentence Ja
ne mogu sebe etogo pozvolit I cant
allow myself this uttered in a con-
text of acquisition    should involve the
concept that represents aord This
means that if the units of the repre-
sentation language are chosen so that
they are based on Russian lexis the
meaning of aord will be missing But
this meaning seems suciently ba-
sic to be included in an ontology
Nirenburg and Levin 1991 bold my
emphasis
It is clear that this kind of argumentation
needs to be sharpened considerably it is also
clear that this can only be done when it has
been established exactly what function the
ontology is to serve
In general the more
detailed the linguistic constraints adopted on
ontology design are the more detailed and
explicitly justiable that ontology design be-
4This is also made problematic by the very mul-
tilinguality of possible linguistic constraints inherent
in machine translation system  without appropri-
ate ways of achieving linguistic generalizations across
languages cf eg Bateman et al 1991 for discus-
sion the application of linguistic constraints is very
much more dicult
comes5 However the relationship between
ontologies and nlp is interestingly reexive6
Ontologies appear necessary for the organiza-
tion of knowledge appropriately for use by nlp
systems and simultaneously the explicitness
of the necessary inferences that constitute an
nlp system provide an until now unrivalled
source of constraint for deciding on ontology
designs
This connection is described well in the fol-
lowing citation from Ewald Lang
   the structure of language plays a
dual role
It is properly allocated to
the parsing and generating components
a constitutive part of the object to be
modeled that is the system which is to
integrate linguistic and non-linguistic
knowledge But at the same time it
is also part of the device by means
of which this object is accessed that
is the categorization of lexical items
into nouns verbs etc provides an ap-
parently natural grid for establishing
corresponding sorts of entities in the
ontology which by denition
represent non-linguistic common sense
knowledge Given this the risk of con-
fusing linguistic and non-linguistic cat-
egories is latent moreover it is practi-
cally unavoidable as long as we are con-
ned or conne ourselves to looking at
common sense knowledge through the
window of language only ie without
a chance to draw on independent ev-
idence from non-linguistic say visual
or kinasthetic ways of accessing the
structure and contents of common sense
knowledge Lang 1991 p464
also one result of an extensive study of proposed on-
tologies reported upon in Skuce and Monarch 1990
Although there has also been at least one example of
development that has attempted movement in the op-
posite direction The abstraction structure of BBNs
natural
language and understanding project janus
was redesigned away from a linguistically oriented de-
scription in order to nd a more general ontological
style Weischedel 1989 200 that was not so strongly
connected with the linguistic realization of the con-
cepts dened However this very move was proba-
bly one contributing factor to the less than successful
outcome of the subsequent attempt to use the Long-
man Dictionary of Contempory English as the ba-
sis for dening a domain-independent taxonomy for
janus Reinhardt and Whipple 1988 The most sig-
nicant generalizations that would have helped orga-
nize the taxonomy for the purposes of natural lan-
guage processing had probably already been lost
6Or even circular as I shall mention below
Thus while linguistic patterns are probably
the richest source of organizational criteria
that are available to ontology design their use
is certainly not unproblematic Consequences
of this can be seen in the fact that although
the majority of recent and currently planned
natural language processing systems recognize
the necessity of some level of abstract seman-
tic organization similar to an ontology that
classies knowledge explicitly according to its
possibility for linguistic expression7 very few
have achieved ontologies of any size and mo-
tivations for inclusion of particular concepts
and distinctions in ontologies remain limited
or underspecied Thus the decision to use
linguistic evidence by itself is still unless fur-
ther restricted underspecied and leaves open
a range of positions These give rise to dier-
ing functionalities that the ontologies are to
serve which hence impacts on ontology de-
sign The positions and functionalities need
to be characterized more precisely and this I
attempt in the following section
3 Three kinds of ontologies
Although I have concentrated until now on
preliminaries to the rst problem area men-
tioned in the introduction  how knowledge
of the world is to be represented  the ap-
parent value of applying linguistic constraints
to this task renders the second problem area
 how that knowledge is related to language
 crucial If the ontology cannot be related
to language in an explicit formalized fash-
ion then the structures and functions of
language will be prevented from having a di-
rect constraining inuence on what gets rep-
resented in the ontology what not and how
the entire ontology is to be organized

the Functional Sen-
for example

Allgayer et al 1989
Dahlgren et al 1989 Emele 1989 the polygloss
project

translator
Relations of eurotra-d
Steiner et al 1987 the
janus project Weischedel 1989 and the ontologi-
cal types of the acord project Moens et al 1989
Moreover ontology-like organizations of informations
have also been found useful for parsing applications
Calder et al 1989 Chen and Cha 1988
by eg
Hinrichs et al 1987 Zajac 1989
There are no
doubt many other places where this kind of construct
now appears
There are at least two theoretically distinct
standpoints from which this second problem
area has been addressed in nlp systems One
possibility is to assume that real-world do-
main knowledge is more or less directly linked
to grammatical and lexical forms of expres-
sion The organization of the world knowledge
ontology should then ideally also be support-
ive of the use of that knowledge for linguistic
expression or for interpreting linguistic dis-
tinctions the problem of relating knowledge
to language is thus subordinated to the world
knowledge ontology design A second possibil-
ity is to assume that the relationship between
real-world domain knowledge and grammar
and lexis is itself complexly structured This
structuring may lean for its organization to-
wards the world knowledge ontology in which
case this would blend into the rst possibility
or towards the grammar and lexicon or al-
ternatively could rely on its own principles of
organization Each of these variants has been
adopted in some system where a concrete on-
tology has been attempted This gives rise to
three distinct kinds of ontology that can be
found in nlp work An ontology can be
 an abstract semantico-conceptual repre-
sentation of real-world knowledge that
also functions as a semantics for use of
grammar and lexis  this type I will term
a mixed ontology Om
 an abstract organization underlying our
use of grammar and lexis that is separate
from the conceptual world knowlege on-
tology but which acts as an interface be-
tween grammar and lexis and that ontol-
ogy  this type I will term an interface
ontology Oi
 an abstract organization of real-world
knowledge commonsense or otherwise
that is essentially non-linguistic  this
type I will term a conceptual ontology
The relationship involved here their embed-
ding in general architectures and the sub-
types of interface ontologies mentioned above
are depicted graphically in Figure 1

tics of Dahlgren et al 1989 and even some
aspects
ontology eg
Nirenburg and Raskin 1987
Nirenburg and Levin 1991  are attempts
to construct ontologies of the third type pure
maximally language independent ontologies
reecting the structure of the world I have
already discussed some of the diculties of
designing such ontologies without building up
through an account of language Psycholog-
ical research might oer another source of
evidence for such ontologies as would de-
tailed sociological work on the commonsense
It is however unclear whether any
such methodology will be able to avoid the
relationship to language observed above and
so I will now concentrate on ontologies which
are at least intended to be related explicitly
to language
32 Mixed ontologies
An example of a mixed ontology  ie one
where there is no extensive treatment of the
relation between the world knowledge ontol-
ogy and grammar and lexis maintained sepa-
rate to the ontology itself  is the approach
taken in the lilog natural language under-
ing project Herzog and Rollinger 1991 de-
tails of the ontology are given in for exam-
ple Klose and von Luck 1991 Pirlein 1991
Klose et al 1991 and details of the rela-
tion between linguistic forms and concep-
tual representations are given in for exam-
ple Gust 1991 Bosch 1991 It may at rst
glance appear strange to classify lilog here
since the approach to the relation between
linguistic form and world knowledge draws
heavily on Bierwisch 1982s theory of se-
mantics where to cite Gust 1991s state-
ment of Bierwischs position
   semantic
forms and conceptual structures belong to
dierent and strictly discriminated levels
Bosch 1991 also makes it very clear that
he holds this distinction to be crucial for
making progress in semantics and knowledge
representation However when the mod-
elling of the approach is examined we nd
that this distinction of levels comes under
attack For example both semantic forms
which are derivable from the lexicon and from
grammatical analysis and conceptual forms
are represented in a single language the se-
language
mantic language being a subset of the con-
ceptual
Bosch 1991 p248 and
are freely combinable moreover Gust 1991
p133 maintains that
there are continuous
variations between semantic forms and con-
ceptual structures This gives rise to lexi-
cal entries which directly contain categories of
an ontology which also contains categories of
real-world knowledge The relation between
conceptual knowledge and grammatical and
lexical form is thus handled by logically ma-
nipulating categories from a single ontology
until categories are found that possess links to
grammatical or lexical entries  this is pre-
cisely the architecture consistent with a mixed
ontology as shown in Figure 1
An illustration of the nonseparation of of
linguistic information and conceptual infor-
mation typical of ontologies of this type can be
seen in the following taken from Bosch 1991
p251 In order to nd the interpretation in
context of the lexeme school as it is used
arguably dierently in examples such as
a The school made a major donation
b The school has a at roof
A general lexical semantic entry for the lex-
eme is retrieved thus
SEMschool  X PURPOSE X
PROCESSES OF LEARNING AND TEACHING
This is then interpreted by applying a given
contextualizing function selected depending
on the basis of the semantic interpretation of
the predicate in the lexicogrammatical repre-
sentation Those for the example sentences
would be
a X INSTITUTION X  SEM X
b X BUILDING X  SEM X
Combining the semantic entry and the con-
textualizing function gives the required con-
ceptual concept that is the referent of the lex-
eme in context  ie that school is inter-
preted as either an institution or a building
All of the undened predicates found in these
logical expressions eg institution pur-
pose etc are sorts dened in the ontology
A direct link is therefore constructed from lex-
icogrammatical information and chunks of in-
formation appropriate for the conceptual level
of organization As we shall see in Section 42
this direct linking is a common property of
nlp systems based on the common notion of
semantics and arises out of a view of the lin-
guistic system that collapses together several
important distinctions
33 Interface ontologies
The second and third types of ontology 
the interface and conceptual types  usu-
ally occur at least theoretically
same architecture
Although it
is also
the case that some systems address them-
selves to the organization of the interface on-
tology without specifying how the concep-
tual ontology will
This latter po-
sition is common for systems that are in-
tended as general purpose nlp systems re-
usable across dierent domains and appli-
cations Examples of such systems include
both parsers and generators such as the Pen-
man system Mann and Matthiessen 1985

86 Meteer et al 1987 Here the problem of
how to organize the interface with external
applications where those applications are not
known in advance has naturally focused at-
tention on organizations of information appro-
priate for interfacing The approach to this
developed within the Penman project in terms
of the Upper Model has become more or less
typical of how this is achieved  although to
what extent this architecture has arisen inde-
pendently across systems is unclear The ini-
tial formulation of the Upper Model was based
on work by MAK Halliday Halliday 1982
William Mann and Christian Matthiessen8
The general statement of the interface prob-
lem for nlp systems is that machine-internal
information needs to be related to strategies
for expressing that information in some natu-
8The development of the Upper Model ontology
from its inception as the Upper structure of the
janus project of ISI and BBN up to its inclu-
sion as a standard component of the current Pen-
man text generation system is covered by the follow-
ing research reports Mann 1985 Mann et al 1985
Moore and Arens 1985 Bateman et al 1990 The
rst detailed theoretical precursor to the ontology was
set out in 1985 by Halliday and Matthiessen as a gen-
eral organization for an experiential semantics this
was called the Bloomington Lattice The sub-
sequent development of the Upper Model has devi-
ated somewhat from the purely linguistically moti-
vated work this will be discussed in more detail below
ral language This could be done in a domain-
specic way by coding how the application do-
main requires its information to appear This
is clearly problematic however it requires de-
tailed knowledge on the part of the system
builder both of how the generator controls
its output forms and the kinds of information
that the application domain contains A more
general solution to the problem of dening a
mapping between knowledge and its linguis-
tic expression is to provide a classication of
any particular instances of facts states of af-
fairs situations etc that occur in terms of a
set of general objects and relations of specied
types that behave systematically with respect
to their possible linguistic realizations This
classication has itself many of the properties
of an ontology eg it is a hierachical organi-
zation of sorts and roles  although by virtue
of its motivation in linguistic realization it
must be seen as a strictly linguistically mo-
tivated ontology Examples here include as-
pects of Meteer 1989s Text Structure Ob-
jects in the spokesman text generator
it is important to remember that Text
Structure objects reect the semantic
type of the expression of the informa-
tion in an object not some intrinsic
type of the object itselfMeteer 1989
linguistic distinctions that do not achieve
a qualitative increase in abstraction
 the ontology can be too deep
in that
it is no longer possible to draw any for-
mally speciable connection between the
constructs posited and the linguistic evi-
dence taken as motivating them
Both extreme situations occur and both re-
duce the value of the ontology as an eec-
tive interface medium The former problem
will be accompanied by an increased diculty
in linking the ontology to information of par-
ticular domains  regardless of whether this
information is considered as a separate kind
of information or as more specic details of
the same kind of information and the sec-
ond problem will be accompanied both by an
increased diculty in linking with grammar
and lexis and by the problems induced by
poorer linguistic constraints mentioned above
The latter situation then often places a heav-
ier reliance on internal or formal constraints
on organization cf eg Weischedel 1989
Horacek 1989 and what Lang 1991 p468
terms sortal restictions which while impor-
tant do not provide sucient grounds for de-
ducing very much detailed actual content by
themselves
also the ontology of the acord system
331 Interface ontologies that are not
   the aim of the sort system is not
to reect the characteristics of real
world objects and events referred to
by linguistic expressions but rather
to systematize the ontological struc-
ture evidenced by linguistic expres-
sions Moens et al 1989 p178
and of course the Upper Model of the Pen-
man system that I will describe in more detail
The position that such an interface ontology
holds between surface details of a language
and more abstract knowledge is however an
uneasy one As suggested above it is possi-
ble to dierentiate among such ontologies ac-
cording to whether they orientate themselves
more towards less abstract or towards more
abstract levels of representation This brings
with it two potential problems in ontology de-
 the ontology can be too shallow in that
its categories are a too direct recoding of
abstract enough
Interface ontologies exhibiting the former
problem are very common and so it is worth-
while giving a slightly more detailed exam-
ple of the problems that arise One such
ontology is that constituted by the seman-
tic relations used within the german compo-
nent of the eurotra project Steiner 1987
Steiner et al 1987
Steiner and Reuther 1989 These relations
are a further development of earlier work by
Fawcett  particularly his work on transitiv-
ity in English eg Fawcett 1987 Fawcett
proposes a semantically motivated taxonomy
of process types analogously to the approach
taken in Halliday 1985 but diering in the
actual categories adopted Each process type
has some distinctive set of possible partici-
pants  the approach thus diers from early
accounts of semantic participants such as
Case Grammar Fillmore 1968 where the
participant relationships were often dened
separately from the processes in which they
participate and further articulates concep-
tions of thematic relations such as those
found in Lexical-functional grammar cf
Hale and Keyser 1986
Levin 1987 and Government and Binding
theory Jackendo 1987 The eurotra-d
work has made renements to the proposed
taxonomy on the basis of multi-lingual ev-
idence particularly from German so as to
provide explicit syntactic tests for the assign-
ment of processes to each of the various pro-
cess types
It is then explicitly stated that
the resulting process types described are no
longer primarily semantic since their classi-
cation is based exclusively on dierentiation
by syntactic criteria Therefore although this
has produced a framework within which pro-
cesses can be classied according to the given
taxonomy with a high degree of inter-coder
consistency which is an important criterion
in large distributed projects such as euro-
its eectiveness as a step towards a
higher level of abstract information has been
restricted This can be seen in the follow-
ing example of process classication given in
Steiner and Reuther 1989 For the clause
That she gave no answer means that she
agrees with the proposal
both subject and object are realized by that-
clauses and the only possible classication ac-
cording to the syntactic tests is then one of
a mental process with two phenomena How-
ever semantically the process also has strong
elements of a relation between the proposi-
tions involved Similar examples in German
are the following the verb retten    vor
Da er gut schwimmen konnte rettete
ihn vor dem Ertrinken
That he could swim well saved him from
drowning
again resembles a relational process but has to
be assigned to mental according to the crite-
ria formulated the process reden to speak
talk which would intuitively seem to be some
kind of communication verb cannot enter into
constructions of the form
 Peter redet Karl kommt morgen
Peter speaks Karl is coming tomorrow
and so does not receive a communication verb
classication and the form
 Peter redet da Karl kommt
Peter speaks that Karl is coming
cannot occur so it may not even receive a men-
tal reading  the only acceptable forms pos-
sible eg
Peter redet Unsinn
Peter speaks nonsense
Peter redet mit Paul Peter speaks with Paul
require an action classication just as the cor-
responding English processes would These
problems provide evidence that the syntactic
tests need to be made more subtle or more
elaborate in order to be able to reveal se-
mantic distinctions more reliably In addition
there is no account suggested of how this level
of representation can link to more abstract
levels of representation such as a conceptual
ontology
A similar case of this probably contributes
to some of the diculties that arise with
the use of Lexical Semantic Structures lss
and Jackendo 1983s Lexical Conceptual
Structures lcs for translation  the for-
mer as described by Dorr 1991 the lat-
ter by Nirenburg and Levin 1991
structures are tightly bound to possible sur-
face forms by formally specied linking rules
eg Levin 1987 These rules partition the
lss or lcs into classes reecting the dierent
realizational behaviour of their categories Al-
though it is also then sometimes possible to
assign to these classes particular semantic
features this has still not yet been found to
be suciently abstract to support a motivated
construction of the corresponding conceptual
ontology  as the example of the motivation
for including the concept aord for Russian
that I cited above shows The nal selection of
conceptual ontological sorts in this case then
shows similarities both with that described for
lilog ie by applying a mixture of lexical
grammatical and domain knowledge criteria
and with the pure ai techniques of cyc and
others In the longer term therefore similar
problems will occur
As a nal example of the problems of lack
of abstraction I will mention some that have
arisen in our development and use of the the
Penman Upper Model The Upper Model
for reasons that I will describe below does
succeed in being more abstract than the se-
mantic relations adopted for example within
eurotra-d The organization of an Upper
Model achieves greater semantic coherence
grouping together distinctions that may be
used by a variety of distinct grammatical re-
sources in a grammar For example the re-
lationships between process and participants
may drive the organization of clauses but
they may equally drive the organization of
head and modiers in nominal groups The
nature of the process-participant relationships
is not arguably altered by their realizational
form Upper Model generalizations might
then express the commonality that unites the
following area of variation
A shoots B
B was shot at T
the shooting of B by A
As shooting of B
Bs shooting
the shooting at P
the P shooting
the T shooting
under a single specication9
process
shootmurdererAmurderedBtimeTplaceP
Categories in the Upper Model are then cap-
turing generalizations which are not appropri-
ately expressed within the grammar A fur-
ther example drawn from the 1989 version of
the Upper Model is the possible grammati-
cal realizations of the concept of generalized
possession This concept should be seen as
being realized by possible selections from all
the grammatical systems to do with posses-
sion Thus the semantics of the following
forms all make reference to this single Upper
Model concept
the doors handle
the handle of the door
the handle that the door has
the door handle
the handle is part of the door
For a more extensive sets of examples
lexico-grammatical variation that
is intended to support
the Upper Model
see Bateman 1989 Bateman 1990a
9Although the actual representation used in the
Upper Model reies both predicates and the re-
lations holding between predicates and their ar-
guments cf
Mann et al 1985 Hobbs et al 1987
Bateman et al 1990
This means that the Upper Model does suc-
ceed in achieving a suciently high degree
of abstraction as to be useful as an inter-
face medium This increase in abstraction
also makes the ontology better suited to link-
ing with more abstract levels of information10
The Penman system has been successfully in-
terfaced with a number of applications 
mostly expert systems but also text planners
 where domain knowledge is represented It
is then an example of an ontology that medi-
ates the relationship between lexico-grammar
and world knowledge without losing the neces-
sary formal connection with the grammar and
lexis Moreover it moves beyond problems
such as that recognized for the eurotra-d
classication of process types that11
The classication system proposed by
eurotra-d proceeds in a strictly syn-
tactic way
   From the standpoint
of generation this solution is problem-
it would be preferable to have
a semantic classication that general-
izes across such surface syntactic sub-
tleties Heid et al 1988 p158
To the extent that it is successful this is pre-
cisely what the Upper Model provides
achieves this by being based very closely not
only on a particular specied grammar  no
concepts are admitted into the Upper Model
for example unless they have a direct and
speciable consequence for the operation of the
grammar  but also on a grammar which is it-
self already more abstract than a constituency
grammar I shall describe this in more detail
The Upper Model thus stands as a signif-
icant step forward in dealing with the prob-
lem of interfacing with a general nlp system
The Upper Model decomposes the mapping
problem inherent in relating domain knowl-
edge with its possibilities for linguistic expres-
sion by establishing a level of linguistically
motivated knowledge organization specically
constructed as a reponse to the task of con-
straining linguistic realizations While it may
10So much so that it has sometimes been our ex-
perience that the domain model of some application
domains has been altered in the light of the consistent
organization that the Upper Model brings to bear
11This problem arose while attempting to interface
the level of input specication for an existing genera-
tor of German semsyn cf Rosner 1988 with the
eurotra-d semantic relations
not be reasonable to insist that application do-
mains organize their knowledge in terms that
respect linguistic realizations  as this may
not provide suitable organizations for eg
domain-internal reasoning  we have found
that it is reasonable indeed essential that do-
main knowledge be so organized if it is also
to support expression in natural language re-
lying on general natural language processing
capabilities
The general types constructed within the
Upper Model necessarily respect generaliza-
tions concerning how distinct semantic types
can be realized We then achieve the neces-
sary link between particular domain knowl-
edge and the Upper model by having an ap-
plication classify its knowledge organization
in terms of the general semantic categories
that the Upper Model provides This should
not require any expertise in grammar or in
the mapping between Upper Model and gram-
mar An application needs only to concern it-
self with the meaning of its own knowledge
and not with ne details of linguistic form
This classication functions solely as an in-
terface between domain knowledge and Up-
per Model it does not interfere with domain-
internal organization The text generation
system is then responsible for realizing the
semantic types of the level of meaning with
appropriate grammatical forms12 Further
when this classication has been established
for a given application application concepts
can be used freely in input specications since
their possibilities for linguistic realization are
then known Interfacing with such a system
is thus radically simplied on two counts
 much of the information specic to lan-
guage processing is factored out of the
input specications required and into the
relationship between Upper Model and
linguistic resources
 the need for domain-specic linguistic
processing rules is greatly reduced since
the Upper Model provides a domain-
independent general and reusable con-
ceptual organization that may be used
to classify all domain-specic knowledge
handled
penman system by the grammars inquiry semantics
which has been described and illustrated extensively
elsewhere cf Penman Project 1989 and see Sec-
tion 42 below
when linguistic processing is to be per-
formed
An example of the simplication that use
of the Upper Model oers for a text gener-
ation system interface language can be seen
by contrasting the input specication re-
quired for generators that work with realiza-
tion classes that are less abstract than those
of the Upper Model  such as eg mumble-
86 Meteer et al 1987 or unication-based
frameworks
such as McKeown and Paris 1987 and the
Lexical Functional Grammar LFG approach
of Momma and Dorre 1987  with the in-
put required for Penman13 Figure 2 shows
corresponding inputs for the generation of
the simple clause Fluy is chasing little
mice The appropriate classication of do-
main knowledge concepts such as chase dog
mouse and little in terms of the general se-
mantic types of the Upper Model in this case
directed-action object object and size respec-
tively  cf Bateman et al 1990 automati-
cally provides information about syntactic re-
alization that needs to be explicitly stated in
mumble-
86 input eg S-V-O two-explicit-args
np-common-noun
restrictive-modifier
adjective Thus for example the classi-
cation of a concept mouse as an object in the
Upper Model is sucient for the grammar to
consider a realization such as in mumble-
86 terms a general-np with a particular
np-common-noun and accessories of gender
neuter Similarly the classication of chase
as a directed-action opens up linguistic re-
alization possibilities including clauses with
a certain class of transitive verbs and char-
acteristic possibilities for participants cor-
responding nominalizations etc Such low-
level syntactic information is redundant for
the penman input14 Similar illustrative in-
13Note that this is not intended to single out these
approaches at all the problem is quite general and oc-
curs whenever there is no ontology available for orga-
nizing information at a more abstract level than that
imposed by the grammar Further as already noted
most current nlp developments are moving in a direc-
tion analogous to that taken in our work on the Upper
14Moreover when additional
information is re-
quired that information is supplied in semantic terms
rather than in terms of morphosyntactic labeling such
as number plural  in this case this is represented
puts forms can easily be imagined for other
types of syntactically oriented grammar and
lexis components
The further domain-independence of the
Upper Model is shown in the following ex-
ample of text generation control Consider
two rather dierent domains a navy database
of ships and an expert system for digital
circuit diagnosis15
The navy data base
contains information concerning ships sub-
marines ports geographical regions etc and
the kinds of activities that ships submarines
can take part in The digital circuit
diagnosis expert system contains information
about subcomponents of digital circuits the
kinds of connections between those subcom-
ponents their possible functions etc A typi-
cal sentence from each domain might be
circuit domain The faulty system is
connected to the input
navy domain The ship which was
inoperative is sailing to Sasebo
The input specications for both of these sen-
tences are shown in Figure 3 These spec-
ications freely intermix Upper Model roles
and concepts eg domain range property-
ascription and the respective domain roles
and concepts eg system faulty input des-
tination sail ship inoperative Both forms
are rendered interpretable by the subordi-
nation of the domain concepts to the sin-
gle generalized hierarchy of the Upper Model
This is illustrated graphically in Figure 4
Here we see the single hierarchy of the Up-
per Model being used to subordinate concepts
from the two domains The domain concept
system for example is subordinated to the
Upper Model concept object domain concept
inoperative to Upper Model concept qual-
ity etc By virtue of these subordinations
the grammar and semantics of the generator
can interpret the input specications in order
to produce appropriate linguistic realizations
the Upper Model concept object licenses a par-
ticular set of realizations as do the concepts
in inquiry semantics by the inquiry response pairs
multiplicity-q multiple and singularity-q nonsin-
gular This is also the case for tense but I have
abbreviated the semantic specication here For de-
scriptions of all these distinctions in detail see the
penman documentation Penman Project 1989
15These are in fact two domains with which we
have had experience generating texts using the Upper
quality material-process etc16
Despite the progress that has been made
with the Upper Model as a potential interface
ontology it is still the case that the mappings
between grammatical forms and the categories
of the Upper Model ontology are not yet rich
enough to ensure entirely appropriate seman-
tic classications  entirely anologously to
the case with the explicitly syntactically ori-
ented categories of the eurotra-d semantic
relations In an attempt to make the deni-
tions of the Upper Model concepts more acces-
sible to users of the Penman system these def-
initions have been pushed towards an intepre-
tation of the Upper Model as predominantly a
hierarchy of generalizations about possible lin-
guistic realizations in English This approach
permits a very straightforward control of the
grammar but compromises some of the seman-
tic integrity Some simple examples of this
may be seen in the following
In the then current version of the gram-
mar the following clause which is an ex-
ample that arose during development of Jo-
hanna Moores Program Enhancer Advisor
pea system Moore 198917
X is dened as Y
had to be constructed from a process dene
and an adjunct of role-playing to produce
the prepositional phrase as Y This contrasts
with a more semantically oriented discrimina-
tion of process types which could take per-
haps a process of dening with three neces-
sary participants a dener a dened and a
denition and state how these are realized di-
rectly In the realization class view as we have
it now the process of dening has to be ex-
plicitly decomposed semantically at the level
of the Upper Model into a process and a rela-
tionship of role-playing This is not intuitively
obvious indeed a user has to know how the
grammar generates as-prepositional phrases in
order to arrive at the correct Upper Model
classication in order to be able to generate
the clause This is dangerously close to the
amount of low-level syntactic detail that needs
to be provided for a Functional Unication
Grammar or Mumble-86

This is not an isolated case Other problem-
atic assignments in the pea domain include
 The process call as in The boy is called
John Presently call is classied as a
dispositive-material-action from UM-89
boy becomes the actee and the name
John becomes a recipient No actor
is specied and so a passive construction
appears due to a then current shortcut
dened for the textual reasoning that the
grammar initiates for selection of active-
passive clauses
 The process generalize to as in The re-
sult can be generalized to other cases
Here generalize is again a straightforward
nondirected-action and to other cases is
specied as a destination spatio-temporal
circumstance in UM-89 in order to gen-
erate the preposition
In all of these cases the role assignments
are only being used in order to achieve the
required syntactic pattern given by the par-
ticular state of the grammar of the Penman
system the Nigel grammar of English In the
rst example the model for the clause being
used is that of give since this class of verbs
is bitransitive in the second the technique
adopted is as with the case of dene as above
where a circumstantial role is selected purely
in order to guarantee the desired preposition
Although in these cases it is reasonably clear
that both grammar and Upper Model would
need to be extended to include the desired
process types in general the theoretical sta-
tus of using arbitrary assignments of concepts
to the Upper Model and selections of roles to
be expressed has not been made suciently
clear This technique is or rather should
only be employed when it is not possible to
extend the grammar and ontology appropri-
ately only when the grammar has to be taken
as xed eg because it is being applied by
a user that does not have access to the inter-
nal organization of the grammar is this kind
of strategy defensible As a general technique
the strategy has to be strongly rejected on the-
oretical grounds However note that without
a commitment to semantic coherence there
is little reason not to use the Upper Model
in this way we have already seen the similar
situation in the use of the eurotra-d sys-
tem of semantic relations where commitment

DOMAIN MODELS


































Figure 4 Upper Model organization reuse with diering domains
to semantic coherence has been explicitly re-
jected in favor of more readily operationalize-
able grammatical critera
Another set of related problems arises when
semantically similar processes have dierent
syntactic realization Consider for example
the two clause types
x is like y
x resembles y
features
Although a user might wish to place these
similarly in the Upper Model grammatically
they are rather dierent The former requires
the grammatical features circumstantial-
attribute manner-participant be-intensive
circumstantial-
the latter has
ascription circumstantial-process
present Nigel grammar
these are dis-
tinguished by the inquiry circumstantial-
ascription-q which would need to examine the
Upper Model Therefore in order to obtain
the diering syntactic structures a further dis-
tinction would need to be set up at the Upper
Model level
The realization class view therefore makes
it dicult for users to formulate their input
specication to the system unless they know
precisely the form of linguistic expression that
they require Since the realizational link be-
tween Upper Model categories and Nigel has
been made so tight for the very purposes
of achieving readily describable criteria it is
sometimes and increasingly once more users
attempt more varied modelling necessary to
subordinate a concept in a counter-intuitive
position simply in order for the language re-
quired to result This certainly undermines
the semantic integrity of the Upper Model as
an interface ontology and moves the entire
classication towards a less abstract level of
information It needs to be remembered how-
ever that only when the grammar is xed is
a specic determinate Upper Model required
 furthermore that Upper Model is even par-
tially determined by the particular grammar
that is specied
Finally one further problem with the in-
terface ontology instantiated by the Penman
Upper Model lies precisely in the simplicity of
the relationship constructed betweeen domain
model and Upper Model We have seen that
this is achieved by literally classifying in the
formal sense of adding into the subsumption
lattice domain model concepts in terms of the
categories from the Upper Model Following
this operation the Upper Model and the do-
main model form a single inheritance hierar-
chy and the domain concepts directly inherit
the possibilities for surface realization dened
for the Upper Model concepts This opera-
tion is currently performed only once for each
domain and while simplifying input expres-
sions it means that the relationship between
domain and Upper Model is not being han-
dled particularly exibly
In fact once the
classication is complete the complete ontol-
ogy can be interpreted as having collapsed
into a mixed ontology of the type described
for lilog both particular domain concepts
and general linguistically motivated concepts
occur in the same subsumption lattice This
treatment of the relationship between a po-
tential conceptual ontology containing detail
knowledge of a domain and the interface on-
tology containing a semantic classication of
possibilities for linguistic expression needs to
be made considerably more exible to avoid
the problems of mixed ontologies described
both above and below
332 Interface ontologies that are too
abstract
Interface ontologies exhibiting the problem of
being too abstract are more commonly found
in small scale systems the problem of not be-
ing able to specify the mapping down to gram-
mar and lexis in a convenient and expandable
form often prevents large-scale development
from getting very far Such projects eg
polygloss acord and many others begin
by adopting classes of categories developed
for example in analytical philosophy or nat-
ural language semantics  such as the event
types of Vendler 1967 temporal categories
such as those of Moens and Steedman 1988
the semantico-conceptual predicates pro-
posed by Jackendo 1983 Jackendo 1990
event structures of Pustejovsky 1988 and
many others As long as restricted grammat-
ical possibilities are entertained for example
to enable research on particular focused areas
of semantics-syntax then such ontologies are
adequate  even useful since the focusing al-
lows greater depth in the semantic account to
be achieved It should also be the case how-
ever that this work then feeds back into more
general and broader ontology work and this
happens much too rarely It is also sometimes
unclear what the relationship of these ontolo-
gies would be to a more abstract conceptual
ontology  this may be expressed formally
for example in terms of a model-semantic the-
ory but the details are often left for future
333 Brief discussion
It is clear that ontologies of the interface
type that are more closely bound to lan-
guage are nevertheless most useful for nlp
systems that want to deal with a wider va-
riety of actual language phenomena The in-
crease in abstraction may not be so very great
in comparison to a desired conceptual ontol-
ogy but it is nevertheless better than work-
ing with grammar and lexis directly Such
work is also much more likely to be sta-
ble in the face of changing theoretical posi-
tions and more justiable with respect to ac-
tual linguistic data It is then natural that
one further type of nlp projects attacking
the problem of large-scale ontology construc-
tion is that of dictionary-oriented projects
such as edr Matsukawa and Yokota 1991
and acquilex Calzolari 1991 The edr
project aims at producing a concept dictio-
nary containing 400000 word senses for En-
glish and Japanese and acquilex is con-
cerned with producing a re-usable lexical
knowledge base that classies entries accord-
ing to taxonomies of semantic categories and
relations between those categories
projects have constructed sizeable semantic
taxonomies relying strongly on dierences in
lexico-grammatical realization for the cate-
gories adopted The taxonomy organization
and categories found in acquilex have simi-
larities to the view of lexical semantics pro-
posed by Pustejovsky 1991 where again
oppositions in linguistic behavior are an es-
sential motivating criterion Another large
project partly leading up to this work and
now related to the kbmt work mentioned
above was the MIT Lexicon Project where
extensive classication of lexemes was under-
taken on the basis of the diering grammatical
patterns that the lexemes may enter into
Although the construction of large knowl-
edge bases at this level of abstraction is bound
to oer a denite improvement in our abil-
ity to rely on linguistic motivations in future
ontology design their availability will not of
itself bring about that design It is still neces-
sary to consider methodologies for using such
information so that appropriate ontologies for
general nlp use can be constructed There-
fore in the next section I will relate the kinds
of ontologies that we have seen in this section
to compatible linguistic theories Without a
broader view of what is being done linguisti-
cally when categories for a particular kind of
ontology are proposed I believe it is unlikely
that progress will be made As long as the
categories developed are suciently close to
the surface details of language to remain ob-
jectively veriable ie remain in the realms
of syntax and lexico-grammatically oriented
interface ontologies useful classications can
be constructed For more abstract levels how-
ever the support of theory become crucial for
dening methodologies questions and possi-
ble solutions
4 Linguistic
support
otherwise for the ontol-
ogy types
In this section I will follow the ordering of the
discussion of ontology types of the previous
section
ie rst linguistic theories compat-
ible with the design of mixed ontologies will
be mentioned followed by the kind of linguis-
tic theory that is more supportive of distinct
interface and conceptual ontologies I will not
raise the issue here of the relationship between
conceptual ontologies and possible linguistic
theories since one of the dening phrases that
is often used about this level of abstraction is
its very extra-linguisticness This does how-
ever depend on the view of the linguistic sys-
tem that is adopted and I will mention some-
thing about this later Finally in this section
I discuss some disadvantages of the former ap-
proaches when considered as a methodology
for developing the kinds of resources neces-
sary for nlp systems
Before beginning the discussion I should
however briey note the motivation for an
exclusion of forms of semantics such as sit-
uation semantics model-theoretic semantics
of various kinds etc below Such accounts
are not immediately relevant to the discus-
sion at hand precisely because they have not
been concerned with the construction of rep-
resentations that are directly supportive of
ontologies That is regardless of whether
the formal account of semantics proposed
in some particular framework contains sets
of predicates that are of mixed ontological
status or are purely conceptual or purely
linguistically semantic we nd one crucial
component of ontological engineering miss-
ing Those categories are not typically built
up into subsumption lattices of sorts shar-
ing various general properties of use for fur-
ther domain classication
It is clear that
many of these theoretical approaches could
easily move in this direction and with the
increased use of sorts in linguistic theory at
all levels of description some rst steps have
been taken eg
Sag and Pollard 1991
p78 Nerbonne 1992 However as pointed
out by Onyshvekych and Nirenburg 1991
The crucial point is that in order to
have an explanatory power the atoms
of a meaning representation language
must be interpreted in terms of an in-
dependently motivated model of the
world Moreover
if any realistic ex-
periments have to be performed with
such an nlp system this world model
sometimes called an ontology must be
actually built not only dened alge-
braically
Therefore until the problem of ontology con-
struction on a realistic scale itself becomes an
issue for an account that account remains of
less central concern for the current discussion
41 Mixed ontologies and lin-
guistic theory
The closest linguistic approaches to support
mixed ontology design such as that found in
lilog are perhaps surprisingly those com-
patible with the work of Jackendo 1983
Jackendo 1990 Jackendo adopts the po-
sition that the semantic level of representa-
tion with which he is concerned is also con-
ceptual ie common to modalities such as
language and vision Jackendo 1983 As
pointed out by Herweg 1991 approaches
that directly link syntax with conceptual in-
terpretation now occupy a rather standard po-
sition in mainstream linguistics and so there
are many approaches that could be described
That of Jackendo is probably one of the
most developed and well known in this di-
rection although there are also similarities
to be drawn with work in Cognitive Linguis-
tics Langacker 1987 Talmy 1987 and direc-
tions such as that of Wierzbicka 1988 All
of these approaches share an orientation to
language as an instrument for revealing facets
of conceptual organization This is stated
most clearly by Jackendo in terms of what
he terms the Grammatical Constraint
   it would be perverse not to take as
a working assumption that language is
a relatively ecient and accurate en-
coding of the information it conveys
To give up this assumption is to refuse
to look for systematicity in the rela-
tionship between syntax and semantics
A theorys deviations from ecient en-
coding must be rigorously justied for
what appears to be an irregular rela-
tionship between syntax and semantics
may turn out merely to be a bad theory
of one or the other Jackendo 1983
Given his equation of semantic structure and
conceptual structure this becomes largely
equivalent to statements such as the follow-
ing describing the basic claim of of cognitive
linguistics
 across the spectrum of languages
the grammatical elements that are en-
countered taken together specify a
crucial set of concepts This set is
highly restricted only certain concepts
appear in it and not others   This
set of grammatically specied notions
collectively constitutes the fundamental
conceptual structuring system of lan-
guage That is this cross-linguistically
select set of grammatically specied
concepts provides the basic schematic
framework for conceptual organization
within the cognitive domain of
guage Talmy 1987 p1656
This position also appears in the approach
of Pustejovsky to the relation between lex-
emes and their interpretation in context as
he writes
The meaning of words should somehow
reect the deeper conceptual struc-
tures in the system and the domain it
operates in This is tantamount to stat-
ing that the semantics of natural lan-
guage should be the image of nonlin-
guistic conceptual principles whatever
Pustejovsky 1991
structure
These approaches are all described by the rst
architecture depicted in the diagram of Fig-
ure 1 Each suggests that there is a portion
of the conceptual ontology that has a direct
linguistic connection and that that portion
should have just the same kind of organization
as the rest of the conceptual ontology A spec-
ication of the semantics of some expression
is simultaneously a possibly partial speci-
cation of a conceptual specication Again
this state of aairs receives a very explicit de-
scription from Jackendo
This account of the syntax-semantics
correspondence gives a principled ac-
count of the level of argument struc-
ture found in various versions of GB
and LFG  - a level of linguistic rep-
resentation that lists the arguments of
a verb with or without their -roles
Such a list can now be simply con-
structed from the set of indices in the
conceptual structure of the verb and
there is one index per syntactically ex-
pressed argument
In short argu-
ment structure can be thought of as
an abbreviation for the part of concep-
tual structure that is visible to the
syntax Jackendo 1983 p4045
By virtue of the Grammatical Constraint
therefore Jackendo adopts a very close bind-
ing of linguistic analysis and categories at
his semantico-conceptual
level of represen-
tation available linguistic realizations and
patternings lead directly to the positing of
corresponding categories and relationships
at the level of semanticconceptual struc-
ture In Jackendos case the linguistic ev-
idence admitted is organized in terms of X-
theory Chomsky 1980 Jackendo 1977 and
so close correspondences appear between cat-
egories of this theory and categories of the
semanticconceptual structure In particular
he states that
1  every major phrasal constituent in
the syntax of a sentence corresponds to
a conceptual constituent that belongs to
one of the major ontological categories
2  the lexical head X of a major phrasal
constituent corresponds to a function in
conceptual structure  a chunk of the
inner code with zero or more argument
places that must be lled in order to form
a complete conceptual constituent The
argument places are lled by the readings
of the major phrasal constituents strictly
subcategorized by X Jackendo 1983
Thus he suggests the following approxima-
tion to conceptual structure for the sen-
tence The man put the book on the table
Jackendo 1983 p68

putcid20 thing
oncid20 thing
the book cid21
the man cid21 cid20 thing
the table cid21 

This structure if we ignore the textual in-
formation represented abbreviated here with
the shows striking similarities with the in-
put specication described earlier for Penman
cf Figures 2 and 3 The structure may
be glossed as stating that a predicate put of
type event holds over three arguments the
rst two are of type thing the latter is an
on-relation of type place Each of the pred-
icates are taken to be dened as semantico-
conceptual categories motivated primarily by
linguistic patterning Further examples of the
motivation of semantico-conceptual categories
from linguistic evidence is the following list of
example categories oered by Jackendo
Interrogative probe
supports category
a What did you buy
b Where is my coat
c Where did they go
d What did you do
e What happened next
f How did you cook the eggs
g How long was the sh
thing
place
direction
action
event
manner
amount
Subsequently further categories of dierentia-
tions are made working from intuitions on the
meanings of sentences and their constituents
supported by example sentences Moreoever
analogously to the perceived relationship be-
tween syntactic structures and rules for their
well-formedness Jackendo takes the position
that the inter-relationships between the se-
manticconceptual categories will also be ex-
pressed in terms of well-formedness rules An
example for the category path is as follows

path 



away-from
The combination of a number of rules such
as these begins to dene a hierarchy of inter-
related categories analogous to the standard
hierarchical organization that I have assumed
appropriate for ontology construction
A comparison of Jackendos semantico-
conceptual categories with for example the
supercially very dierent categories arising
from cognitive linguistics is very illuminating
concerning the role that motivations from lan-
guage can play for ontology construction The
general methodology of proponents of cogni-
tive linguistics is to examine grammatical el-
ements  however these come to be dened 
in order to uncover the conceptual organiza-
tion they presuppose For example Talmy of-
fers the following break down of the thisthat
distinction in English
A closed-class element of this type
species the location of an indicated ob-
ject as being in eect on the speaker-
side or the non-speaker-side of a con-
ceptual partition drawn through space
or time or other qualitative dimen-
sion Talmy 1987 p168
This is summarized as
 a partition that divides a space into re-
gionssides
 the locatedness a particular relation of
a point or object idealizable as a point
within a region
 a side that is the same as or dierent
from
 a currently indicated object and a cur-
rently communicating entity
By sampling across a wide range of languages
the Cognitive Grammarian compiles a list of
such distinctions and attempts to provide in-
ternal organization and structure rooted in a
presumed linguistically relevant area of con-
ceptual organization The avor of this orga-
nization can be seen in the following examples
of proposed categories from Talmy
Dimension The category of
dimension has
two principal member notions space and
time The kind of entity that exists in space
is  in respectively continuous or discrete
form  matter or objects The kind of
entity existing in time is correspondingly
action or events    Talmy 1987 p174
This is schematized as
dimension
space 
continuous
discrete
objects
Plexity Plexity is a generalization of notions
such as singular and plural to cover actions
also For example
uniplex
b multiplex
A bird ew in He sighed once
Birds ew in
He kept sighing
Boundedness Boundedness is a generalization
of notions such as mass and count with re-
spect to nouns to include again actions in ad-
dition to objects This Talmy relates to im-
perfective and perfective and similar terms in
the treatment of verbs Essentially when
a quantity is specied as unbounded it is
conceived as continuing on indenitely with
no necessary characteristic of niteness in-
trinsic to it When a quantity is specied as
bounded it is conceived to be demarcated
as an individual unit entity Talmy 1987
p178 Similar far more formal expressions
of this idea can now be found in a number of
approaches eg Krifka 1989
Dividedness A quantity is
discrete
particulate
having breaks or interruptions
its composition
tity is
Talmy 1987 p180
is conceptualized as
through
the quan-
continuous
conceptualized as
Otherwise
These categories hold of a given quantity
simultaneously and so classify that quantity
along the dimensions described Moreover
dierent linguistic consequences are intended
to follow from each distinction Although
there are many interesting distinctions sug-
gested which could help enrich proposed on-
tologies along a number of dimensions the
lack of an accepted detailed grammatical
framework nevertheless limits the generaliza-
tions that can be found Langacker claims
   basic grammatical categories such
as noun verb adjective and ad-
verb are semantically denable The
entities referred to as nouns verbs etc
are symbolic units each with a seman-
tic and a phonological pole but it is
the former that determines the catego-
rization All members of a given class
share fundamental semantic properties
and their semantic poles thus instanti-
ate a single abstract schema subject to
reasonably explicit characterization A
noun for example is a symbolic struc-
ture whose semantic pole instantiates
the schema thing   In a similar fash-
ion a verb is said to designate a pro-
cess whereas adjectives and adverbs
designate dierent kinds of atemporal
relations Langacker 1987 p189
Although with the proposed conceptual cat-
egories restricted in this way to follow from
grammatical categories that are so directly
observable ie often inectional and word-
based such as singular and plural mass and
count nouns and verbs etc one would not
expect a particularly rich ontology in fact a
large number of nely dierentiated categories
are set up  primarily on the basis of con-
trastive examples that do not rely on detailed
syntactic analysis This shows conclusively
the value of examining a very wide range of
natural occuring examples in contrast to the
oft criticised eg Rohrer 1986 but nev-
ertheless still prominent tendency in main-
stream linguistics to study constructed ex-
amples in areas that illuminate the currently
fashionable linguistic phenomena Neverthe-
less the lack of a formally speciable mapping
between the categories proposed and linguistic
realization renders the consequences of estab-
lishing any particular set of categories almost
impossible to investigate and this is certainly
less of a problem in a contrasting account such
as that of Jackendo where the relation to a
detailed account of grammar and lexis is al-
ways clear The value noted above of being
able to test out and justify proposed categories
for ontologies formally applies here strongly
Jackendo is able therefore even on the basis
of rather limited linguistic breadth of motiva-
tion to suggest a more detailed set of cate-
gories and interrelationships The semantico-
conceptual representations are substantially
more abstract than syntactic classes as ev-
idenced by the generalizations that they per-
mit to be drawn but are nevertheless tied
reasonably precisely with possibilities for lin-
guistic expression An ideal situation would
therefore be to have a very broad detailed
and formally specied grammar capable of
describing very ne-grained grammatical and
lexical dierences
Even despite the lack of formally speci-
ed mappings to linguistic form within cog-
nitive linguistics
there has still been at
least one signicant application of its pro-
posed concepts in a computationally con-
text This is in their use to provide a sys-
tem of semantic features for stating mean-
ings to be preserved across languages in
machine translation Zelinsky-Wibbelt 1987
Zelinsky-Wibbelt 1988 Although the work
suers from the lack of explicit denition
that the conceptual categories have so far re-
ceived  making it dicult for coders us-
ing the semantic features reliably to clas-
sify the meanings that are involved  this
situation may be improved signicantly by
some current work in progress18 which is in-
tended to improve the necessary connection
between the semantic categories and their
linguistic realization The situation apply-
ing Jackendos categories in a computational
context has as would be expected been
more straightforward A number of proposals
have been made for such an application and
some have been implemented For example
Meteer 1988 comments on the possible or-
ganization of abstract linguistic terms at the
text message level for the sentence generator
Mumble-86 that a system such as Jackendos
could provide and we have already seen that
both Dorr 1987 Dorr 1990s work on the
unitran translation system and approaches
within kbmt Nirenburg and Levin 1991
have implemented aspects of the semantico-
conceptual structure19
18For example by Cornelia Zelinsky-Wibbelt and
Wiebke Ramm of IAIEurotra-D on syntactic tests
that coders could apply to resolve dicult cases
19Further analogous areas of research which often
fall somewhere between the explicit grammatical foun-
dation attempted by Jackendo and the until now
more impressionistic linguistic motivations of Lan-
gacker and others
include the large body of work
on the conceptualization and linguistic expression of
spatial-temporal information eg Herskovits 1986
Bierwisch and Lang 1989 and many others
42 Interface ontologies and lin-
guistic theory
In contrast to the accounts of the previous
section the separation of information found
in the interface ontology and a more abstract
conceptual ontology is consonant with theo-
retical positions that assume a higher degree
of stratication in the linguistic system The
mixed ontology view goes well with a stan-
dard syntax-semantics-pragmatics distinction
where semantics includes the conceptual rep-
resentation and pragmatics provides pro-
cedures that operate over the semantico-
conceptual representation to produce active
interpretations in context In this sense prag-
matics is not a further stratum in a linguis-
tic system and has a distinct theoretical sta-
tus to that of syntax or semantics
In con-
trast to this the interface ontology architec-
ture suggests at least a three-way stratica-
tion between lexico-grammatical information
semantic information and a contextualizing
level of conceptual
information Each of
these strata appears to have rather similar
formal properties most of the information of
each for example would appear to be repre-
sentable as a subsumption lattice dened over
sorts possibly augmented with structured in-
heritance20
I have already mentioned one view of the
linguistic system that seems compatible with
this stratication
the approach to seman-
tics and context proposed by Bierwisch 1982
Bierwisch and Lang 1989 that acted as one
inuence for the lilog design  even though
the nal specication of the ontology within
lilog does not seem to have remained in
the spirit of this theory Within the linguis-
tic model of Bierwisch conceptual represen-
tations are maintained strictly separate from
semantic representations and semantic ex-
pressions are used to constrain construction
of conceptual expressions during interpreta-
tion Thus words actually lexicogrammat-
ical patterns are related to semantic forms
which determine functions from contexts to
conceptual structures The distinction be-
tween the two levels in this kind of two-level
semantics is nicely summarized by Michael
Herweg as follows
20Current work in information-based syntax makes
this point for syntax Pollard and Sag 1987
Semantic representations are struc-
tured congurations of semantic units
which on the one hand are deter-
mined by the grammatical system of
the language in question and on the
other hand are grounded in  or
motivated by  the conceptual sys-
   Conceptual representations
are structured congurations of concep-
tual units which are mental representa-
tions of certain aspects of the external
world Herweg 1991 p1523
The two classes of categories  the semantic
and the conceptual  thus have very dierent
theoretical statuses and allow very dierent
kinds of motivations This is therefore pre-
cisely the kind of structuring of the linguistic
system that one requires to support the use of
interface and conceptual type ontologies
The most successful of the interface ontolo-
gies described in Section 33 the Penman Up-
per Model clearly has a natural relation to
the stratication found in this kind of two-
level semantics For example the sorts of the
Upper Model are determined by the gram-
matical system concretely the Nigel gram-
mar component of the Penman system as is
required Although there is also a relation-
ship to be drawn with accounts that are ex-
plicitly seeking semantic organizations closely
linked to language regardless of these organi-
zations further embedding at higher levels of
abstraction21 the relation between a proper
view of the Upper Model and two-level se-
mantics becomes even closer when we exam-
ine instead of the Upper Model rather the
theoretical position of which the Upper Model
is only a very partial instantiation ie that
of systemic-functional theory Halliday 1961
Halliday 1978
Matthiessen and Halliday forthcoming
Systemic-functional theory is a highly strat-
ied general linguistic theory with respect to
which the Penman text generation and its de-
scendents have been and continue to be de-
veloped
In some ways perhaps analogously
to the situation in lilog many aspects of the
current implementation of the Penman system
are not accurate instantiations of that theory
Of particular importance here is the very in-
stantiation of the concept of linguistic strata
21Or alternatively by seeking an embedding in an
account such as model-theoretic semantics to bottom
out in a formally speciable way
 since it is precisely this construct which
is necessary for motivating the kind of multi-
levelled representation that we nd in inter-
face ontologies and their contextualizing con-
ceptual ontologies
The notion of stratication in systemic-
functional theory is depicted diagrammati-
cally in Figure 5 The linguistic system
is broken down here into three strata
icogrammar semantics and context Be-
tween each stratum the same relationship
 that of realization  holds
Systemic-
functional theory is essentially a functional
theory ie one that is concerned crucially
with the functions that language fullls in
particular contexts and this informs the un-
derstanding of the realization relationship be-
tween strata as follows Each higher-level ie
more abstract stratum is seen as providing
the functional motivation for the next lower-
level stratum and each lower-level stratum is
seen as providing a resource that generalizes
across the possibilities of the next-higher stra-
tum Halliday 1978 This gives us a more de-
tailed view on how strata in the linguistic sys-
tem interact than that usually found in strat-
ied accounts Additionally each higher-level
stratum is seen as contextualizing the levels
beneath
The organization of the Penman-style ar-
chitecture version of systemic theory instan-
tiates the stratication as follows Near-
est the surface there are realization state-
ments of syntagmatic organization or syntac-
tic form These statements are classied in
terms of their potential for expressing commu-
nicative functions that are realized grammati-
cally such as assertingquestioningordering
activepassive etc
this denotes paradig-
matic organization and is represented in terms
of a grammatical system network This or-
ganization captures the possible alternatives
that are available given any choices that
have already been made
ie a collection
of paradigms of the form a linguistic unit
of type A is either an A of functional sub-
type X or an A of functional subtype Y    
or an A of functional subtype Z are given
At each level these subtypes are disjoint and
serve to successively classify linguistic units
along ever more nely discriminated dimen-
sions This formulation of classications in
terms of increasingly ne discrimination is
in systemic-functional linguistics termed the
principle of delicacy The grammatical com-
municative functions are then in turn moti-
vated by semantic distinctions that classify se-
mantic circumstances according to the gram-
matical features which are appropriate to ex-
press those situations this classication is the
combined responsibility of choosers and in-
quiries Mann 1983 Finally the possibili-
ties for classication that the inquiries have
are dened in terms of the abstract ontol-
ogy of the Upper Model In relation to Fig-
ure 5 then the Penman-style architecture
represents a computational instantiation only
for the lower two strata and the relationship
between them
While at a rather general level very simi-
lar to the breakdown proposed by Bierwisch
the systemic-functional account also goes into
more detail about the internal organization of
each stratum It is this feature which is largely
responsible both for the more abstract status
that has been achieved for the sorts of the Up-
per Model and for the early adoption of the
principle of motivating sources on the basis
of the grammar Not only is all grammati-
cal variation captured by abstract choices be-
tween minimal grammatical alternatives but
also all such abstract choices must have ex-
plicit motivations or semantic conditions de-
ned Only then is the grammar fully dened
as a resource for grammatical expression we
have to know what each grammatical possi-
bility is an expression of This has naturally
given rise to the notion of covering the gram-
mar in terms of a set of motivations for each
choice that the grammar oers This is de-
picted graphically in Figure 6 The categories
necessary for this motivational covering are
then organized into sorts in a subsumption
lattice  thus dening the Upper Model
It is worth noting that this provides a
very strong methodology for interface ontol-
ogy construction Until a grammar alterna-
tion is explicitly connected into a motivational
relationship the alternation is considered to
be only formally in the sense of linguistic
form dened The grammar in fact acts as
a highly structured list of phenomena that
require semantic motivation In addition the
functional organization of the grammar itself
goes a long way towards providing a useful
pre-classication of syntactic phenomena so
as to be amenable to systematic semantic in-
terpretation The extra boost in abstraction

Figure 6 Covering the grammar semantically
that the grammar oers is responsible for the
increased level of abstraction that the Upper
Model has already achieved
I have noted however that the Upper
Model does not instantiate the full organi-
zation required by the theory Some of the
consequences of this have already been men-
tioned For example the upwards relations
of the Upper Model to context has not been
modelled within Penman in terms of a real-
ization relationship domain models are di-
rectly subordinated to the Upper Model hi-
erarchy I will return to this and some other
problems below
Importantly since the full
input of the theory has not yet been taken
into account we have available a number of
possible directions for development that may
provide a far more sophisticated implementa-
tion of both interface and conceptual ontolo-
43 A comparative evaluation
In this section I will apply the possible lin-
guistic theoretical underpinnings that could
be provided for the dierent ontology types in
order to consider those ontology types more
critically
I will suggest here that there are
clear reasons for dispreferring accounts that
adopt a mixed ontology approach Subse-
quently
in the next section I will discuss
possible future developments for interface and
conceptual ontologies drawing further on the
connections to theory established
We have seen that the type of account based
on a style of argumentation such as that of
Jackendo manages to gain abstractness while
still maintaining contact with details of lin-
guistic realization I have noted that the in-
crease in abstraction is a generally necessary
property for improving the functionality of
nlp systems One of the principle dierences
between such an account and the linguistic
theories supportive of interface ontologies was
in the degree and explicitness of stratica-
tion One can ask the question therefore
is there any evidence for the more stratied
view of the linguistic system If it proves nec-
essary or benecial to dierentiate between
information that is particularly linguistic and
the kind of information sought in accounts of
real-world commonsense knowledge then a
mixed ontology will not be sensitive to this A
very important issue to address is therefore
whether the selection between a mixed ontol-
ogy and a more dierientiated set of interre-
lated ontologies is one which is still open to de-
bate or arbitrary  or are there grounds for
deciding for one architecture over the other
431 Populating a mixed ontology
If we assume that we have an account such
as that proposed by Jackendo possibly aug-
mented by a range of concepts from cognitive
linguistics with a more formally expressed re-
lationship to the lexicogrammar it is still the
case that there the resulting ontology is not
yet very large The number of general sorts
that occur in for example
Jackendo 1990
ie not the conceptual equivalents of lexical
items which seem to be introduced freely
is less than 40 these include predicates such
as event state be orient path go
with from to towards inchoative re-
act affect etc Most conceptual items are
decomposed into these primitives
not discuss whether or not these items are
good candidates psychologically for concep-
tual primitives but relying on this small set of
categories is unlikely to capture many general-
izations of linguistic expression when a broad
lexicogrammar is considered If we include ex-
perience such as that obtained within the de-
velopment of the lilog ontology or the Upper
Model many intermediate sorts will express
useful generalizations over distinct linguistic
patterns Relying on a smaller than neces-
sary set of categories either misses general-
izations or places more work on the mapping
with lexicogrammatical form The method-
ological question arises of how the sort hier-
archy is to be extended beyond the very gen-
eral categories that most attempts at ontol-
ogy construction assume as basic on intuitive
grounds
The primary source of evidence for exten-
sion is the classication of lexicogrammati-
cal patterns This posits semantic features
that co-occur with particular classes of Lex-
ical Conceptual Structures But these classes
are constructed on the purely syntactic lin-
guistic behaviour of the investigated lexemes
This while being the best methodology avail-
able and one I have defended throughout this
paper cannot itself be expected to give rise
to conceptual classes Only the assumption
that such semantic patterns are simultane-
ously conceptual makes this plausible there
is no obvious connection to be drawn between
aspects of domain and commonsense knowl-
edge and lexically derived categories The
latter are often subject to criticism for be-
ing too shallow even for an interface ontol-
they must appear very unlikely can-
didates for a conceptual ontology As we
have found with the problems with the Upper
Model Section 331 there is no guarantee
that particular domain-motivated categories
will choose lexically-motivated categories that
belong to a consistent more general ontologi-
cal type More often items belonging to very
dierent lexical classes are treated as seman-
tically equivalent for speakers expressive pur-
poses Representing this in a single ontology
then requires that concepts may be consis-
tently classied along the two dimensions si-
multaneously which complicates the formal
properties of the resulting ontology consid-
erably since exactly what may be inherited
where becomes unclear
This is shown concretely in the linguisti-
cally motivated evaluation that Lang 1991
undertakes for lilog There he examines the
sorts proposed for the ontology according to
the kinds of motivations accepted for their in-
clusion He nds the following dierentially
motivated sorts all combined in the single sub-
sumption lattice
 Conceptually based sorts which are in-
cluded on extra-linguistic conceptual
grounds
 Text base specic sorts which are con-
cepts corresponding to special vocabulary
items required by the particular domain
and text with which lilog as a project
was concerned
 Sorts projected from the grammar
which are notions found in the grammar
such as preposition transferred to the on-
tology
 Sorts of mixed origin which are concepts
where both extra-linguistic and linguistic
criteria are involved
This mixing of motivations organizes itself
loosely according to the vertical and horizon-
tal dimensions in the hierarchy Thus
The vertical structure of the sort hier-
archy which is based on the subsump-
tion relation draws mainly on the avail-
ability of corresponding linguistic la-
bels categorized as nouns    or as verbs
   However the horizontal dimension
of the sort hierarchy that is the selec-
tion of subsorts to be assigned to a com-
mon supersort is mainly determined by
features that emerge from our extra-
linguistic conceptual knowledge of ob-
jects and spatio-temporally speciable
events or situations    
Lang 1991
p4667
Lang shows the following problems for the
resulting organization in a single subsump-
tion lattice that this inconsistency or variety
of motivations for concepts in the hierarchy
creates First since extra-linguistic or con-
ceptual criteria are less than well understood
there is a degree of arbitrariness in the catego-
rizations that appear Second it is never clear
from the concepts that are found in the hier-
archy alone whether they are to be expected
to have a corresponding linguistic eect or
not Third the co-existence of distinct kinds
of concepts means that the precise meaning of
subsumption with respect to particular cases
is underspecied  dierent kinds of concepts
have dierent relations between their wholes
and their parts and until this is claried it
is unclear what kind of subsumption actually
holds These dierences entail dierent formal
properties so that dierent objects can call for
dierent inheritance properties Thus for ex-
ample a supposedly general part-whole re-
lation is intended sometimes as is a compo-
nent of sometimes as is spatially included
in somtimes as pertains to sometimes as
inalienable possession sometimes as alien-
able possession etc This range of possibil-
ities makes the inferences that in fact follow
from any statement in the ontology far more
dicult to foresee and substantially compli-
cates in any case any axioms for inference that
are designed
This can also be seen concretely in many
versions of semantics where a mixed on-
tology is relied upon  in order to han-
dle the very exibility of the relationship
between the concepts
that are to func-
tion for the linguistic expression and those
which are not complex and often uncon-
strained mechanisms are introduced
type
projective inheritance of Pustejovsky 1991
and many instances of
coercion
as used by
Sag and Pollard 1991
Pustejovsky 1991 are probably prime exam-
ples of this but there are many others A
mixed ontology is therefore a very weakly
constraining theoretical construct which does
not provide optimal assistance either for the-
ory construction or for system construction
432 Stratication
The just mentioned exibility of relationship
between conceptual categories and the cate-
gories that are determinative of their linguis-
tic realization is a very typical property of a
relationship between linguistic strata
this very exibility in fact which provides the
primary linguistic evidence for stratication
As an example of this consider the following
issue of ontological design
Regardless of whether a mixed ontology is
adopted or not some portion of some on-
tology is assumed which oers an expression
of the chunking that language expects and
demands of knowledge if it going to be ex-
pressible through the grammatical and lexi-
cal resources of the linguistic system One
question that can be asked therefore is
the information in a conceptual ontology that
will support this chunking already organized
in this way or not
If it is then it will
be straightforward to construct a mechanism
such as that suggested by Jackendo above
whereby one simply takes a view on some
conceptual structure and already has a spec-
ication of the semantic predicate-argument
structure which can in turn control the gram-
mar and lexis to produce appropriate results
If not however then some reorganization of
the structure will be necessary
In all ex-
amples that are presented of alleged concep-
tual structures that are already appropriate
for direct lexicogrammatical realization eg
by viewing as predicate-argument structure
we can make the following observations
First the lexical items and class of gram-
matical patterns appropriate is already so
highly constrained as to follow directly from
the expression for example
State orient Thing weathervane Path
north
ervane pointed north Jackendo 1990 p74
Certain variability in lexicogrammatical ex-
pression will be produced by the mapping
rules of syntax formation but other decisions
including the choice of word for the concept
weathervane given that the hearer might not
know what a weathervane is or that the sen-
tence may be uttered among world-experts
on the subject of weathervanes who would
normally select a far more restrictive descrip-
tion etc have already been built into the de-
scription Widely diering selections of pos-
sible expression according to text type reg-
formality situation time availability
cf Hovy 1988 Bateman and Paris 1 are
excluded
Second the granularity of the correspond-
ing language has also been built into the de-
scription For example we know that a sen-
tence is going to be produced or if the linking
rules are good enough a sentence or a nom-
inalization rather than a short discussion of
the winds eect on an object whose position
of equilibrium under the pressure of the wind
serves as an indication of the winds direction
A nice example22 of maximal exibility here
might be the dierence for example in the
language produced in response to the concep-
tual real-world category beer for the purposes
of a dictionary entry eg
Beer is a bitter alcoholic drink made
from grain There are a lot of dierent
kinds of beer
Collins cobuild En-
glish Language Dictionary 1987
and that produced for the purpose for an entry
in an industrial chemical encyclopedia which
goes on for 40 pages
The response to both of these problems
within the semantico-conceptual approach is
straightforward the dierences are expressed
beforehand in the semantico-conceptual orga-
nization and are produced by conceptual pro-
cesses for information organization and man-
agement But this misses the generalization
that regardless of the information to be ex-
pressed that same linguistic granularity is im-
posed there will be a set of descriptions of
some predicate with an argument structure
including specications of participants and
circumstances The two sentences concerning
beer in the dictionary and the hundreds in the
as one reading for the sentence The weath-
22Due to Karin Haenelt
encyclopedia all exhibit the same kind of orga-
nization Knowledge is variable scale but lan-
guage is predominantly xed-grain23 as de-
ned by the grammar This means that for
all the knowledge available in the semantico-
conceptual ontology there need to be con-
struction mechanisms available which convert
some selected fragment of the information of
any scale and produce an appropriate sized
chunk of semantico-conceptual structure for
motivating a sentence
With unconstrained inferencing across the
knowledge base
this may be achievable
by inheriting constraints back from the
grammar and checking the equivalence of
constructed semantico-conceptual structures
with the originally selected fragment But
crucially for all such selected fragments the
same class of
semantico-conceptual para-
phrases will be potentially available
those licensed by their grammatical express-
ability Furthermore also regardless of the
originally selected semantico-conceptual frag-
ment the lexico-grammatically licensed set
of semantico-conceptual specications gov-
ern speciable sets of inferences that oper-
ate only on such specications
for exam-
ple the inferences that determine the tex-
tual variations that are appropriate when
realizing the specication lexicogrammati-
cally Bateman and Matthiessen to appear
that certain abstract semantic classications
apply for which there is no conceptual ev-
idence Schriefers 1990 and others Thus
not representing this distinguished set sepa-
rately fails to capture a signicant generaliza-
tion about the organization of the linguistic
system as a whole24
23Apart from the resources for combining clauses
into complexes which are not
nominal groups etc
relevant to the current argument
24It is also engenders dubious nlp system design
factoring out the commonalities in a separate stratum
is analogous to the following application of object-
oriented programming
In an object-oriented application    the
system uses predened mappings from ob-
jects to the routines that know how to pro-
cess those objects or can choose among dif-
ferent routines depending on the context
The eciency of using predened mappings
for known types comes in drastically reduc-
ing or entirely eliminating search the onus
is put on the developer to dene the de-
cisions available to a type at each level
rather than presenting all options at all
times and letting a search procedure nd
Finally it is worth emphasizing that this
exibility between strata is typical and not
unique to the relation between semantics and
conceptual levels of representation The re-
lationship between for example the Upper
Model and the lexicogrammar already ex-
hibits much of the same kind of exibility For
example the expressive resources of the gram-
mar of nominal groups is not restricted to the
single grain-size of sorts that are subtypes of
an Upper Model sort object It is equally pos-
sible to realize Upper Model classied events
as nominal groups or congurations of events
as single clauses if the textual conditions are
appropriate
Bateman and Paris 1 present
other examples of this theoretical exibility
for other categories in the grammar It is not
at all surprising given the theoretical similar-
ity therefore to nd exactly this kind of ex-
ibility again between the sort lattice of the
semantic ontology and that of the conceptual
ontology
This discussion of stratication is summa-
rized in Figure 7 Here we see three strata and
the repeated variability in expression that any
selected semantic specication has Crucially
the common reoccuring coding possibilities
that are available for all elements from the
conceptual stratum are not repeated at that
level but are factored into a single statement
at the level of the semantic interface with a
mapping from sorts at the conceptual stra-
tum to sorts at the interface stratum Not
representing this generalization both guaran-
tees a complication of the theory and makes
a usable nlp system based on the theory un-
likely Again the power of the theory to bring
methodological and contentful constraints to
bear on system design is compromised

mer puzzles resolved

mixed ontologies on the basis that they are
internally inconsistent and has criticised the
non-staticational linguistic accounts under-
lying such mixed ontologies on the basis that

Figure 7 Capturing generalizations via stratication
they fail to capture theoretically important
and practically useful generalizations Both
weaknesses have one consequence in common
they provide a seriously reduced set of con-
straints for ontology design and construction
Since one purpose of this paper is to sug-
gest principles and methodologies for ontol-
ogy construction mixed ontologies and under-
stratied linguistic accounts are clearly to be
avoided The kinds of ontologies most appro-
priate for nlp systems and for which linguis-
tic support needs to be sought can now be
restricted to the following two types
 Type Oi an abstract semantic organiza-
tion underlying our use of grammar and
lexis that is motivated on essentially lin-
guistic grounds and that acts as a com-
plex interface between lexicogrammatical
resources and higher-level strata in the
linguistic system  the categories of this
interface should be maximally general
ie apply across distinct real-world situ-
ations but specic enough to maximally
constrain possible lexicogrammatical ex-
pression
 Type Oc an abstract organization of
real-world knowledge commonsense or
otherwise that relates downwards to the
interface to lexicogrammar
With these restrictions in place I will now
go further and suggest some particular guide-
lines for ontology construction
In order to
do this however it is also necessary to make
some further commitments to the kinds of in-
formation that will be made available at par-
ticular levels in the linguistic system The rea-
son for this is that the linguistic and particu-
larly lexico-grammatical constructs are essen-
tial for guiding ontology design This follows
the increasingly wide range of linguistic the-
ories that are returning to the position that
the relation between grammar and semantics
is not arbitrary we saw a selection of these
in Section 4 above eg
Langacker 1987
Wierzbicka 1988
Talmy 1987
Jackendo 1983 Halliday 1978
If we ac-
cept this then it is also to be accepted that
the selection of particular accounts of lexi-
cogrammar has consequences for the subse-
quent ontology design
Since such conse-
quences cannot be avoided it makes sense to
make selection decisions in ways which will
maximally help in the task of ontology con-
struction overall
I will distinguish between
decisions in the following two areas
domains25
 type of grammar
 contents of grammar
and will make some rm suggestions for the
former and discuss the consequences of dier-
ences that arise in the latter
First we can note that the most successful
interface ontology developed so far is prob-
ably that of the Upper Model The Upper
Model has achieved both a detailed account
and a generally applicable account We can
ask then what is it about its underlying the-
oretical organization that let this occur Sec-
ond we can further note that although the
Upper Model is the most detailed instantia-
tion of an ontology of type Oi that has been
developed is nevertheless not a full instan-
tiation of the theory on which it is based
It is therefore worthwhile considering briey
what additional constraints the theory could
bring to bear if it were to be more fully im-
plemented
is easily classied
The kind of grammar on which the ab-
stractions proposed in the Penman Up-
per Model
paradigmatic-functional grammar exhibiting
the standard Hallidayan metafunctional diver-
sication Halliday 1985 Matthiessen 1990
Matthiessen and Bateman 1991
This means that it is organized rstly around
choice  the paradigms of grammatical con-
structions that stand in functional opposition
 and second around a factorization of that
choice according to its semantic motivation
is the choice to do with the propositional con-
tent of the linguistic entity to be classied
ideational is the choice to do with the tex-
tual placing of the linguistic entity to be clas-
sied textual or is the choice to be classied
as to do with the interpersonal relationship
between speaker and hearer or with the atti-
tude of the speaker towards the information
expressed by the linguistic entity interper-
sonal The motivations for the choices pro-
vides hypotheses concerning the sorts neces-
sary for controlling those choices The Up-
per Model has been derived by considering
motivations for those choices exclusively as-
signed to the ideational metafunction there is
no mixing of categories across metafunctional
This builds into the design of an ontology
motivated in such a way as the Upper Model
the following features
First we require an ontology that is sig-
nicantly more abstract than syntactic real-
ization classes I have already suggested how
this has been achieved with the Upper Model
The grammar being organized in terms of a
functional classication of possible constraints
on constituency structure
is already more
abstract than constituency structure per se
Further classication across the paradigms
uncovered is then automatically more abstract
and achieves a generalization across particu-
lar lexico-grammatical contexts that supports
a greater exibility of expression of input
expressions The strict relationship to the
grammatical stratum also makes sure that the
kinds of mixed sorts that Lang 1991 nds
and criticises in the lilog hierarchy cannot
occur either an interface ie semantic on-
tological category has a specied consequence
for lexico-grammatical expression or it is not
accepted
Second given the stratication suggested
by the theory the Upper Model is automat-
ically only the next level up in the linguistic
system
it is an ontology strongly connected
to grammar below It does not by itself pro-
vide the necessary organization of higher level
ontologies Thus in short we see that an or-
ganization closely reminiscent of a two-level
semantics is automatically achieved and that
both levels require ontologies
Third we have seen that it is a design
goal that an ontology be as general as pos-
sible  that it helps with classication across
domains tasks and applications but also
be substantial enough to provide a rich scaf-
folding for domain description This raises
the question How can we guarantee that
a proposed ontology is as general as we re-
quire We can now see that ontologies such
as the Upper Model which are based on
motivations from grammar are guaranteed
to have the domain-independence required
25Although it is perfectly possible to imagine ap-
plying the same grammar-as-lter methodology on
underlying motivational ontologies as carried out for
the ideational metafunction  cf Bateman 1991 for
examples of this applied to the textual metafunction
and Matthiessen and Bateman 1991 for general dis-
cussion  the resulting organizations of information
have very dierent properties
of them
Since ontological categories are
motivated by the grammatical distinctions
and not by more arbitrary lexical collec-
tions found in a given domain those cate-
gories are forced to be at least as general as
the grammatical categories
It is therefore
very unlikely that Klose and von Luck 1991
p462s claim that the lilog ontology has a
more domain-independent status than the
early version of the Upper Model described
in Mann et al 1985 would apply to current
versions of the Upper Model
But we can go further and move beyond
the kind of generalizeability that refers sim-
ply to domain-independence  which is gen-
eralizeability upwards in the linguistic sys-
tem and beyond generalizeablity across the
lexicogrammar  which is generalizeability
downwards in the linguistic system When
we also consider the metafunctional organi-
zation of the linguistic system posited by
systemic-functional theory then we can see
that generalizations both across text in-
stances and across speech functions are also
guaranteed  ie generalizations horizon-
tally across the same stratum of the linguistic
system This is depicted graphically in Fig-
ure 8 These constraints rule out certain other
potential sorts from the ontology eg sorts
concerned with the particular appearance of
an entity at a given position in a text or with
the speakers attitude towards an event Cer-
tain of the sorts found in Meteer 1989s in-
terface ontology are good examples of the for-
mer kind Having such sorts requires reclas-
sication of domain information whenever a
domain object is used in a text since the tex-
tual statuses of domain objects changes over
the development of a text  ie from new to
given from theme to rheme etc This change
of course needs to be represented the point
is that representing such information in the
interface ontology again mixes very dierent
kinds of information  although this time on
a horizontal dimension across the linguistic
system rather than a vertical one
The kind of grammar that we employed as
the initial motivation for guiding the develop-
ment of the Upper Model has therefore gone
a long way towards ensuring that the prop-
erties desired of ontologies obtain But an
area of exibility in the description then arises
from the depth of grammatical description
ie the contents rather than the type Par-
ticularly within the systemic-functional ap-
proach lexical descriptions are seen as more
specic versions of grammatical descriptions
 there is no dierence in kind Thus if we
push lexicogrammatical description further in
the direction of lexis we automatically push
further the depth of motivating semantic on-
tology constructs that are needed This bi-
furcation in potential description needs more
theoretical work before we can make any rm
statements about whether it is more helpful
to pursue one at the expense of the other or
whether they should be pursued in parallel as
has been the case with the more general area
of the grammar
We can now also consider some possible im-
provements and explanations for some awk-
ward phenomenaintuitions that have previ-
ously hindered ontological engineering For
example if there is a stratication of the kind
argued for why is it that suggestions for con-
ceptual structure that have been put forward
in a number of approaches appear also to be
candidates for representation as sorts in the
interface ontology  When the categories of
the Upper Model for example are examined
many similar classes to the proposed concep-
tual ontology work are to be found
example of
To give a concrete
Lang 1991 p474 after careful discussion
concerning the problems of a mixed ontol-
ogy denes some basic assumptions con-
cerning the structure of the conceptual on-
tology drawn from earlier work
includ-
ing Bierwisch and Lang 1989 With respect
to these assumptions he outlines the following
set of conceptual domains which are to form
basic subsorts of the conceptual ontology
D1 objects
D4 time intervals D5 events
D2 substances D3 locations
D6 attitudes
We can also note here similarities with some
of the classes above from Jackendo 1983
Jackendo 1990
Langacker 1987
Talmy 1987 etc But these are also sorts
already found for example in the Penman
Upper Model where they have been entered
purely on the grounds that they are necessary
to directly constrain possible grammatical re-
alizations Is it the case that the claim we saw
above by Gust 1991 p133 that
there are
continuous variations between semantic forms
and conceptual structures is after all true
Can we introduce strict stratication and still

Figure 8 Capturing generalizations via metafunctionality
account for the intuition that these concepts
indeed function at dierent strata
Lang already suggests that there may be
certain genuinely linguistic
features that
function denitionally for features at the con-
ceptual stratum
   the representation of nouns like
Ofen oven Fahrzeug vehicle Boot
in the lexicon contains a spe-
cic component purpose hence an el-
ement of our linguistic knowledge by
means of which the sort Nutzgegenstand
article for practical use in the knowl-
edge base is being accessed This is but
one example of how linguistic aspects
of lexical representation can be made
use of in dening ontological sorts in the
knowledge base Lang 1991 p470
Other genuine linguistic features that Lang
suggests for the basis of the ontological dis-
tinctions include bounded object vs
non-
bounded object concrete object vs
stract object  both very similar to other
theoretical accounts We can now go further
and explain the relation between the linguistic
semantic ontology types and the conceptual
ontology types as follows
All of the reasoning that we have applied
to the development of the Upper Model ontol-
ogy with respect to its motivation in the lexi-
cogrammar can be applied precisely to the re-
lation between the Upper Model ontology and
some higher stratum ontology This follows as
a consequence from the theoretical statement
of the nature of realization within the strat-
ied linguistic account This means that we
will need to nd motivations for the seman-
tic interface ontology sorts
It also means
however that we can make use of the realiza-
tion relation starting from the standpoint of
the higher stratum and interpret the status of
the semantic interface ontology as generalizing
across dierent conceptual stratum situations
cf Figure 5 Thus for both the lexicogram-
mar with respect to the semantic interface on-
tology and for the semantic interface ontology
with respect to the conceptual ontology it is
likely that the more general intra-stratal or-
ganization of the lower stratum is likely to be
echoed in the overall intra-organization of the
higher stratum This gives us the observed
link between constructs that are motivateable
as general semantic concepts and constructs
that appear to organize the conceptual hier-
archy There is then no mixing of the cat-
egories of dierent strata there is just a res-
onance or echo of categories at one stratum
taken up at another
strata
the contents of
Given both this theoretical and practi-
the dif-
cal binding of
then a certain tension between strata 
Klose and von Luck 1991 p462 note
from their experience with the lilog ontol-
it clear why there
The tension between linguistic and in-
ferential demands on the modeling is
alive and forces compromises on both
sides
I have suggested that the kind of view of re-
alization between strata found in systemic-
functional linguistics where there is both a
practical and a theoretical pulling in both
directions  upwards to context and down-
wards to experiential lexicogrammar of-
fers an appropriate way of operating within
this tension between strata The resulting
methodology then uses the tension to help
constrain organization decisions for the con-
struction of interface ontologies that are use-
ful for nlp and to remove the need for genuine
compromises where an inappropriate cate-
gory is postulated at one level because that
is insuciently functionally dierenti-
ated from others
It is clear however that we know a great
deal more about possibilities for ontologies of
type Oi than we do about ontologies of type
Oc Moreover given the results of the last
section perhaps we know even less than we
thought  clearly conceptual categories are
now sometimes best reappropriated to a more
abstract semantic type This is a less than
ideal situation  particularly given the view
of stratication shown in Figure 5 and the es-
tablished dialectic between strata Because
the realization relationship between strata is
bi-directional we should be able to use a
higher-strata to constrain our accounts at a
lower-strata But the fact that we know very
little about the higher-strata in this case re-
moves one source of possible constraint
Finally here however I will draw atten-
tion to one interesting consequence for the
status of the higher-stratum ontology when
we take into account the bi-directionality of
the inter-stratal relationship Since there is
no dierence assumed in the theoretical sta-
tus of the levels related by the interstratal re-
lationship one might ask how it is that the
interface ontology is termed linguistic and
semantic whereas the higher-stratum ontol-
ogy is non-linguistic and conceptual I be-
lieve that a far more appropriate view of the
relationship is as depicted graphically in Fig-
ure 9 All strata that stand in an interstratal
relationship of the kind explored and used in
this paper should be seen as semiotic levels
of greater and lesser degrees of abstraction
The conceptual ontology thus becomes more
of a contextual ontology with context being
interpreted in the sense of a level of social
situation  closely in line with for exam-
ple Halliday 1978 There is then the ad-
ditional question of how this entire complex
of inter-related levels of semiotic descriptions
relates to the supporting conceptual system
of human psychology This is probably a very
dierent kind of relation than realization 
although it will probably again turn out to be
a dialectic relationship rather than a one-way
determination This puts us in the position
to criticise some of the conceptual sorts pro-
posed by Lang on exactly the same grounds
that he has criticised mixed ontologies For
example alongside the above mentioned do-
mains all of which may be more plausi-
bly ground in the conceptualperceptual sys-
tem Lang 1991 p474 places
social insti-
tutions law administration marriage edu-
cation and communicative behaviour eti-
quette conversation group dynamics Such
a mixed set of sorts is unlikely to form a very
stable or usable ontology it is probably cru-
cial to begin to rene further our levels of
ontology and their interactions so that the
mistakes made at the least abstract levels of
ontological engineering are not just repeated
again at the next level up More detailed
statements must however be left to future
research

Figure 9 The relationship between semiotic descriptions and conceptual representation
commonsense metaphysics and others  I
drew attention to the fact that such accounts
do not bring strong methodological and sub-
stantive constraints to bear on ontology con-
struction Also unclear is the relationship of
such ontologies to language The gap is of-
ten so large that this level is too abstract
to have any direct relationship to required
forms of expression Contrariwise this gap
also leads to a weakening of the discriminative
power of the constraints that can be brought
to bear by linguistic patternings Concretely
then one cannot for example generate nat-
ural language directly from such levels of de-
scription without resolving or xing an im-
mense number of degrees of freedom that re-
main unaddressed often quite rightly if this
is seen as a conceptual ontology in the on-
tology itself Much of the work that an nlp
system requires to be done is therefore sim-
ply not taken into consideration by the ab-
stract ontology Such ontologies are also be-
cause of their abstractness dicult to popu-
late reliably  if sizeable and potentially dis-
tributed resource construction is undertaken
as it increasingly is then this virtually guar-
antees poor intercoder consistency In short
such ontologies are of very limited value for
nlp work
These problems have been noted by some
of those who have sought principles for on-
tology design cf Skuce and Monarch 1990
and those who need real shareable resources
as for example in machine translation 
cf Steiner and Reuther 1989 The only so-
lution that has been found to this endeavor is
to place more reliance on language as a source
of constraint For this reason then views on
language and the organization of the linguis-
tic system become crucial for ontology design
that is appropriate for nlp Moreover only by
taking views on the linguistic system that are
maximally supportive of the functionalities re-
quired of ontologies can we avoid problems of
lack of abstractness ie being dominated by
linguistic form and problems of too much ab-
stractness ie being dominated by semantic
theories of particular areas that lack connec-
tion to linguistic form In short ontological
engineering faces the following dilemma
terface ontologies
 need to be abstract large-scale re-usable
information classication devices
 but they cannot be too abstract
 or too near syntax
 and need to be constrained from lan-
The theoretical assumptions and resulting or-
ganizational decisions that I have pursued in
this paper appear to oer a very practical way
of preceding within this state of aairs I have
also shown that several other benecial prop-
erties for nlp systems are derivable from the
abstract organization of the linguistic system
that systemic-functional theory posits
The paper has presented for broader debate
a round of discussion that begun in the con-
text of the developing ontology of the Penman
text generation system This work begin-
ning with the pre-computational descriptive
account called the Bloomington Lattice by
Halliday and Matthiessen has passed through
several instantiations in computational form
Now future work will have again consider
bringing together the linguistic descriptive
account  reworked to a new level of de-
tail in Halliday and Matthiessen to appear
 and the computational model It is to be
hoped that this approach will build on the for-
mer success of the Upper Model simultane-
ously moving us in some of the directions that
I raised as responses to problems with the Up-
per Model Thus I have not suggested that
the Upper Model we nd in Penman is the
general solution to ontological engineering 
there are many more criticisms to be made of
this ontology again mostly concerning the ex-
tent to which it succeeds as an instantiation of
the theoretical principles that underlie it The
function of the ontology is also more nely cir-
cumscribed than many others  but again
strictly according to the underlying theory
We are not yet at a stage where an ontology
can be accepted even pragmatically for the
needs of current nlp systems as complete
what is more at issue is the development of ap-
propriate methodologies for constructing on-
tologies and here again constraints oered by
the linguistic system are of paramount impor-
tance The linguistic system when viewed
appropriately gives a rich multidimensional
set of constraints on adequate and appropriate
designs for computational systems The prin-
ciple dimensions applied in this paper were
those of strata and metafunctions This by no
means exhausts the possible input of the the-
ory however For further dimensions of the
theory see Matthiessen and Bateman 1991
for additional examples of using these dimen-
sions to constrain computational system de-
sign see Bateman et al 1992 I hope that
the paper has suggested some of the benets
of employing such linguistic motivations and
that further attempts to apply wider sets of
motivations will help us in the future

1Most of the background for this paper is drawn from experiences with the development of the Penman Upper
Model an ontology for supporting natural language generation The Upper Model has been under development
since 1985 and many have and continue to contribute to it The ideas I report on here would not have been possible
without that development Those responsible for the present form of the Upper Model include William Mann
Christian Matthiessen Robert Kasper Richard Whitney Johanna Moore Eduard Hovy Yigal Arens and myself
Introduction
The development of natural language process-
ing henceforth nlp systems has reached
the stage where concentrated eorts are nec-
essary in the area of representing more ab-
stract more knowledge-related bodies of in-
formation
It has been accepted that with-
out substantial bodies of background infor-
mation concerning commonsense everyday
knowledge about the world or detailed in-
formation concerning particular domains of
application
it will not be possible to con-
struct systems that can support the use of
natural
Systems need to repre-
sent concrete details of the worlds that their
texts describe for example the resolution of
anaphors the induction of text coherence by
recognizing regularities present in the world
and not in the text the recognition of plans
by knowing what kinds of plans make sense for
speakers and hearers in real situations etc all
require world modelling to various depths
language
This need creates two interrelated problem
areas The rst problem is how knowledge
of the world  be it general commonsense
knowledge or specialized knowledge concern-
ing some particular domain  is to be rep-
resented The second problem is how such
organizations of knowledge are to be related
to linguistic system levels of organization such
as grammar and lexis For both problem ar-
eas the concept of ontologies for nlp has
been suggested to be of potential value Very
generally an ontology oers a conceptual
framework for the representation of informa-
tion  a framework that is suciently gen-
eral but also suciently detailed to provide
a rich supportive scaolding for the construc-
tion of models of the world The design of
such ontologies constitutes an area of concern
that is coming to be known as ontological en-
gineering eg Nirenburg and Raskin 1987
Lenat and Guha 1988 Simmons 1991 As
we shall see below most systems that deal
currently with nlp already adopt some kind
of ontology for their more abstract levels of
information However theoretical principles
for the design and development of ontologies
meeting the goals of generality and detail re-
main weak This is due not only to a lack
of theoretical accounts at these more raried
abstract levels of information but also to the
co-existence of a range of sometimes poorly
dierentiated functions such bodies of infor-
mation are expected to fulll
The following list gives an idea of the range
of functions adopted in nlp Ontologies are
often expected to fulll at least one and often
more of
 organizing world knowledge
 organizing the world itself
 organizing meaning or semantics of
natural language expressions
 providing an interface between system
external components domain models
etc and nlp linguistic components
 ensuring expressability of input expres-
 oering an interlingua for machine trans-
lation
 supporting the construction of concep-
tual dictionaries
Moreover an ontology is seen as a very gen-
eral organizational device ie one that pro-
vides a classication system for whatever area
of application the ontology is applied to The
organizational resource oered by an ontology
has to be re-usable But it is an open issue as
to what extent the kinds of organization listed
here overlap It cannot be taken for granted
that they all refer to the same level of ab-
stract description
It can also not be taken
for granted that there is unity concerning the
tasks that are involved in such descriptions
This can be seen in the following statement
from Hobbs
Semantics is the attempted specica-
tion of the relation between language
and the world However this requires
a theory of the world There is a spec-
trum of choices one can make in this
regard At one end of the spectrum 
lets say the right end  one can adopt
the correct theory of the world the
one given by quantum mechanics and
the other sciences If one does this se-
mantics becomes impossible because it
is no less than all of science   Theres
too much of a mismatch between the
way we view the world and the way
the world really is At the left end
one can assume a theory of the world
that is isomorphic to the way we talk
about it
   Most activity in seman-
tics today is slightly to the right of
the extreme left end of this spectrum
   it fails to move far enough away
from language to represent signicant
progress towards the right end of the
spectrum Hobbs 1985 p68
It probably does not make sense therefore
to talk of a generalized classication system
without rst xing more precisely the nature
of its intended function A further problem is
that the rst of the desired functions above
organizing world knowledge is often taken to
be denitional for an ontology2 However the
world  ie psychological logical or philo-
sophical views of the world  has not proved
to be very constraining as to what knowledge
organizations it requires Ontologies built on
the basis of such constraints are as we shall
see below underconstrained and there has ac-
cordingly been no achievement of the large
scale resources necessary for re-use across nlp
systems
The main purpose of this paper is to add
a further round of discussion to that con-
cerning the design and construction of ontolo-
gies for nlp The paper is explicitly explo-
rative building on experience in the denition
and use of such ontologies for text generation
The paper is intended to stimulate discussion
rather than present solutions  although I
do conclude with suggestions for certain lines
of theoretically motivated methodological de-
velopment for future ontologies The basic
path taken in the paper will be to dierenti-
ate among the distinct functions that ontolo-
gies may serve in order to be better able to set
out principles and constraints for the design of
abstract levels of knowledge organization that
can serve as ontologies appropriate for nlp
Seen in more detail the paper is organized as
follows
First I discuss the role of language as a pos-
sible motivating force for designing and pop-
ulating ontologies Second I introduce sev-
eral of the most extensive ontologies that are
currently to be found in nlp systems char-
acterizing their precise function and motiva-
tion within their respective systems Third
I relate the distinct types of ontology discov-
2Or the second may be claimed to be the real task
 however as Hobbs points out this actually comes
closer to the rst position
ered to possible general linguistic theories that
would support them It is my contention that
many principles of organization follow directly
from the position of suggested bodies of infor-
mation in the linguistic system as a whole and
that recognizing this allows eorts in the def-
inition and construction of such bodies of or-
ganization to be directed more appropriately
than has hitherto been the case For any on-
tology that is proposed therefore it should
be possible to relate its properties back to a
motivating linguistic theory I argue that the
evidence that we now have from the more ex-
tensive attempts at ontology construction sug-
gests strongly that a richly stratied model
of the linguistic system is required in order
to achieve the degree of constraint that we
need for attacking large-scale re-usable on-
tology construction Fourth I show how the
ontology of the Penman text generation sys-
tem  that has been developed largely as
an instantiation of the highly stratied the-
ory of systemic-functional linguistics  al-
ready answers many of the criticisms that
have been raised against other ontologies I
argue that although these criticisms are of-
ten based on largely post hoc methodological
grounds the vast majority of them also fol-
low directly from the properties of the linguis-
tic system and so could and arguably should
have been made prior to attempting ontology
construction This can be seen in the proper-
ties of the Penman ontology whose very de-
sign avoids signicant criticisms levelled else-
where Finally I suggest how ontology de-
sign could be improved yet further by taking
into consideration more input from linguistic
theory The Penman ontology for example
is only a partial instantiation of the theoret-
ical principles underlying it and it is possible
to show that problems enter into the account
precisely where the ontology falls short of the
theoretical specication
In general then this paper is intended not
only to improve our understanding of what
kinds of bodies of information can stand as
ontologies of various kinds and how such bod-
ies of information relate to other resources in
the computational representation of the lin-
guistic system but also to make the point that
appropriate views of the rich dimensions of or-
ganization exhibited by the linguistic system
can go a long way to improving our initial
design specications for nlp systems They
should therefore always be considered very
early on in system construction and computa-
tional theory development
2 The role of language in
ontology justication
As mentioned above the move to consider nlp
systems that require information over and be-
yond that attributable to surface syntax has
raised two problems how to organize that in-
formation and how to relate that information
with the less abstract levels of the linguistic
system The rst problem is typically consid-
ered in more detail in approaches where the
operation of a system in some specied do-
main is the central goal the second usually
arises in systems which attempt to model the
linguistic system itself focusing less closely on
the embedding in any particular specied do-
main of application
One common source for knowledge con-
struction and representation that is found in
approaches to the rst problem is earlier work
in articial intelligence ai Even early ai
reasoning programs needed to represent the
state of the world in which the programs were
to operate This has given rise to the ar-
eas of domain modelling and common-
sense reasoning which are responsible for
representing concrete details of aspects of the
world The enterprise of world modelling
clearly has many similarities with the require-
ments of sophisticated nlp systems and there
has naturally been an inux of techniques and
attitudes concerning ontology design from the
ai context
This has proved most successful
cross-over of techniques of knowledge rep-
resentation in ai to techniques for repre-
senting linguistic information
The simi-
larity between structured inheritance knowl-
edge representation languages such as kl-
one Brachman and Schmolze 1985 and its
descendents and current typed feature logics
Smolka 1989
Smolka and Ait-Kaci 1989
Nebel et al 1991 is an active area of re-
search A basic model for the representation
of ontologies can now assume minimally that
a subsumption lattice over sorts is dened
probably with some mechanism correspond-
ing to the structured inheritance of role in-
formation associated with the sorts and pos-
sibly additional axioms or particular infer-
ences licenced by specied combinations of
sorts This will be the representational basis
for ontologies of all kinds that I will assume
throughout this paper
In contrast to this concensus attempts to
decide exactly which sorts make sense for
an ontology based on ai
knowledge engi-
neering principles have been less successful
Although the eort-intensive nature of do-
main modelling naturally calls for consider-
ation of the re-usability of components of
the knowledge represented across distinct do-
mains the ability of ai-centered approaches
to come up with such general organiza-
tions has been limited
Some of the ear-
liest work in this area was that on naive
physics
Hayes 1979 Hayes 1985
here the aim was to capture the under-
lying general knowledge that people have
about physical objects and substances in
the world similar investigations are reported
Hobbs and Moore 1985
Hobbs et al 1987 and there are naturally
also connections to be drawn with other work
in semantic and conceptual representation in
ai eg Schank and Abelson 1977 Further
good examples of systems that require de-
tailed real knowledge in particular domains
are expert systems here also there is still lit-
tle shareability across domain models The
detailed organization of such systems knowl-
edge is typically unique to particular applica-
tion domains and shows relatively little cross-
domain re-usability
for example
We can in part explain this by consider-
ing the relative importance assigned to the
distinct functions that such domain models
in ai are to fulll For example when con-
structing a knowledge source whose primary
function is to support the particular inferences
that a given system needs to draw it is log-
ical that the organization of that knowledge
be tailored with this goal in mind This usu-
ally leads however to nongeneralizeable rep-
resentational requirements because the infer-
ences that distinct systems are to draw have
not been related The relatively small scale of
most of this work to date has furthermore lim-
ited the eectiveness and urgency of investiga-
tions into re-usability the cost of construct-
ing domain models from scratch has not been
The most
scaolding for
extensive attempt
prohibitively high This cost-equation quickly
changes once more realistically sized bodies
of information are considered It quickly be-
comes much more important that detailed or-
ganizations of general knowledge applicable to
many domains are available so as to reduce the
work involved when moving to new domains
to cre-
ate a general
represent-
ing general background knowledge of the
world based on ai techniques is the cyc
project Lenat and Guha 1988 The size of
this project initial projections were for a base
level of 10000000 entries of necessity forces
a sharp awareness of the need to have an or-
ganization for knowledge that is detailed and
general enough to provide sucient scaold-
ing for supporting large-scale bodies of infor-
mation in accessible and usable ways With-
out clear principles both for the organiza-
tion of such knowledge and for the selection
of the information to be represented the re-
sult would be disastrous poorly organized
knowledge will be inadequate both theoreti-
cally in that it fails to capture signicant gen-
eralizations and practically in that it fails
to be usable as a resource The procedure
followed in cyc is to divide up types of en-
tities into categories that appear to behave
dierently ie concepts are classied accord-
ing to the kinds of inferences that they al-
low to be drawn about themselves Problem-
atic here therefore is precisely which kinds
of inferences are to be taken as denitional
This does not appear to have been made ex-
plicit and so the procedure does not provide a
particularly sound methodology The result-
ing domain-independent and hence re-usable
portion of the cyc ontology is accordingly not
very deep somewhat tangled and supports
limited inferences
It then becomes increas-
ingly necessary to raise questions concerning
the consistency of distinct areas of knowledge
represented and consequently how one can
use that knowledge
It needs to be recognized that it is essen-
tial to dene the purpose for which a body of
information is to be used in order to dene ap-
propriate organizations for that information
As long as the purposes are unclear or too
varied consistent organizations will be di-
cult to achieve The statement that a general
ontology of real-world knowledge should sim-
ply represent that knowledge is underspec-
ied It does not provide sucient guidance
for nding useful organizations for that knowl-
edge Given that we need a general organiza-
tion and that that organization will be deter-
mined by purpose we clearly need a very gen-
eral but still formally speciable task that
requires particular inferences to be performed
If it were possible to nd such a task then
it would be possible to use it as a guiding
methodology for constructing general organi-
zations of knowledge Precisely one such gen-
eral task is of course the expression of knowl-
edge in natural language whatever the knowl-
edge that is represented ie whatever do-
main and however generalspecic it should
be possible to express that knowledge linguis-
tically3 One additional set of constraints that
one can apply in the construction of organiza-
tions of knowledge that attempt maximal ap-
plicability across domains is then that oered
by language
This must be specied further For ex-
ample the acceptance of ways of talking
about categories as evidence for the existence
of those categories in an ontology is a very old
strategy eg Aristotle and is present even in
cyc This method of justication is however
limited to seeing what one can say and still
make sense about a category rather than any
more technical analysis of linguistic proper-
ties The precise inferences that are being re-
lied upon to shape the organization are there-
fore still not being given Thus there are ex-
amples of ontologies that are constructed in
nlp systems where there is a specied rela-
tionship between concepts and linguistic ex-
pression but the relationship is suciently
non-general so as not to provide strong con-
straints on ontology design
One such case is the ontology of kbmt
projects Carbonell and Tomita 1987 such as
translator Nirenburg and Raskin 1987
Work of this kind seeks a level of represen-
tation that is minimally dierent across dis-
tinct languages Moreover the value of or-
ganizations of information that are relevant
across distinct domains is clearly recognized
3This is overstated to the extent that some in-
formationknowledge is often maintained to be inex-
pressible linguistically  even if this is so it is still the
case that by far the widest and most generally appli-
cable form of expression that we know is language In
any case whether or not there exists knowledge that
is inexpressible linguistically will not aect the nal
outcome of the discussion below
and re-usable ontology portions are actively
sought However although the link to lan-
guage ensured by the machine translation
task increases the likelihood that this can be
achieved on a larger scale the re-usable por-
tions of the ontologies proposed until now re-
main small This can in part be attributed
to the fact that the appeal made to language
as a constraining force on ontology design is
undervalued4 The external-to-language at-
titude towards ontological constructs assumed
from ai promises to capture abstract models
of the world or of conceptions of the world 
a dierence that is not criterial at this point
and its organization independent of particu-
lar languages This appears a tempting di-
rection for achieving interlinguality But then
we nd motivations such as the following for
the categories that are to be adopted within
an interlingual ontology
Russian has no word that corresponds
exactly to the English word aord as
in I cant aord X or I cant aord to
Y In a multilingual processing envi-
roment there might be a concept cor-
responding to a sense of the English
word aord A Russian sentence Ja
ne mogu sebe etogo pozvolit I cant
allow myself this uttered in a con-
text of acquisition    should involve the
concept that represents aord This
means that if the units of the repre-
sentation language are chosen so that
they are based on Russian lexis the
meaning of aord will be missing But
this meaning seems suciently ba-
sic to be included in an ontology
Nirenburg and Levin 1991 bold my
emphasis
It is clear that this kind of argumentation
needs to be sharpened considerably it is also
clear that this can only be done when it has
been established exactly what function the
ontology is to serve
In general the more
detailed the linguistic constraints adopted on
ontology design are the more detailed and
explicitly justiable that ontology design be-
4This is also made problematic by the very mul-
tilinguality of possible linguistic constraints inherent
in machine translation system  without appropri-
ate ways of achieving linguistic generalizations across
languages cf eg Bateman et al 1991 for discus-
sion the application of linguistic constraints is very
much more dicult
comes5 However the relationship between
ontologies and nlp is interestingly reexive6
Ontologies appear necessary for the organiza-
tion of knowledge appropriately for use by nlp
systems and simultaneously the explicitness
of the necessary inferences that constitute an
nlp system provide an until now unrivalled
source of constraint for deciding on ontology
designs
This connection is described well in the fol-
lowing citation from Ewald Lang
   the structure of language plays a
dual role
It is properly allocated to
the parsing and generating components
a constitutive part of the object to be
modeled that is the system which is to
integrate linguistic and non-linguistic
knowledge But at the same time it
is also part of the device by means
of which this object is accessed that
is the categorization of lexical items
into nouns verbs etc provides an ap-
parently natural grid for establishing
corresponding sorts of entities in the
ontology which by denition
represent non-linguistic common sense
knowledge Given this the risk of con-
fusing linguistic and non-linguistic cat-
egories is latent moreover it is practi-
cally unavoidable as long as we are con-
ned or conne ourselves to looking at
common sense knowledge through the
window of language only ie without
a chance to draw on independent ev-
idence from non-linguistic say visual
or kinasthetic ways of accessing the
structure and contents of common sense
knowledge Lang 1991 p464
also one result of an extensive study of proposed on-
tologies reported upon in Skuce and Monarch 1990
Although there has also been at least one example of
development that has attempted movement in the op-
posite direction The abstraction structure of BBNs
natural
language and understanding project janus
was redesigned away from a linguistically oriented de-
scription in order to nd a more general ontological
style Weischedel 1989 200 that was not so strongly
connected with the linguistic realization of the con-
cepts dened However this very move was proba-
bly one contributing factor to the less than successful
outcome of the subsequent attempt to use the Long-
man Dictionary of Contempory English as the ba-
sis for dening a domain-independent taxonomy for
janus Reinhardt and Whipple 1988 The most sig-
nicant generalizations that would have helped orga-
nize the taxonomy for the purposes of natural lan-
guage processing had probably already been lost
6Or even circular as I shall mention below
Thus while linguistic patterns are probably
the richest source of organizational criteria
that are available to ontology design their use
is certainly not unproblematic Consequences
of this can be seen in the fact that although
the majority of recent and currently planned
natural language processing systems recognize
the necessity of some level of abstract seman-
tic organization similar to an ontology that
classies knowledge explicitly according to its
possibility for linguistic expression7 very few
have achieved ontologies of any size and mo-
tivations for inclusion of particular concepts
and distinctions in ontologies remain limited
or underspecied Thus the decision to use
linguistic evidence by itself is still unless fur-
ther restricted underspecied and leaves open
a range of positions These give rise to dier-
ing functionalities that the ontologies are to
serve which hence impacts on ontology de-
sign The positions and functionalities need
to be characterized more precisely and this I
attempt in the following section
3 Three kinds of ontologies
Although I have concentrated until now on
preliminaries to the rst problem area men-
tioned in the introduction  how knowledge
of the world is to be represented  the ap-
parent value of applying linguistic constraints
to this task renders the second problem area
 how that knowledge is related to language
 crucial If the ontology cannot be related
to language in an explicit formalized fash-
ion then the structures and functions of
language will be prevented from having a di-
rect constraining inuence on what gets rep-
resented in the ontology what not and how
the entire ontology is to be organized

Steiner et al 1987 the
janus project Weischedel 1989 and the ontologi-
cal types of the acord project Moens et al 1989
Moreover ontology-like organizations of informations
have also been found useful for parsing applications
Calder et al 1989 Chen and Cha 1988
by eg
Hinrichs et al 1987 Zajac 1989
There are no
doubt many other places where this kind of construct
now appears
There are at least two theoretically distinct
standpoints from which this second problem
area has been addressed in nlp systems One
possibility is to assume that real-world do-
main knowledge is more or less directly linked
to grammatical and lexical forms of expres-
sion The organization of the world knowledge
ontology should then ideally also be support-
ive of the use of that knowledge for linguistic
expression or for interpreting linguistic dis-
tinctions the problem of relating knowledge
to language is thus subordinated to the world
knowledge ontology design A second possibil-
ity is to assume that the relationship between
real-world domain knowledge and grammar
and lexis is itself complexly structured This
structuring may lean for its organization to-
wards the world knowledge ontology in which
case this would blend into the rst possibility
or towards the grammar and lexicon or al-
ternatively could rely on its own principles of
organization Each of these variants has been
adopted in some system where a concrete on-
tology has been attempted This gives rise to
three distinct kinds of ontology that can be
found in nlp work An ontology can be
 an abstract semantico-conceptual repre-
sentation of real-world knowledge that
also functions as a semantics for use of
grammar and lexis  this type I will term
a mixed ontology Om
 an abstract organization underlying our
use of grammar and lexis that is separate
from the conceptual world knowlege on-
tology but which acts as an interface be-
tween grammar and lexis and that ontol-
ogy  this type I will term an interface
ontology Oi
 an abstract organization of real-world
knowledge commonsense or otherwise
that is essentially non-linguistic  this
type I will term a conceptual ontology
The relationship involved here their embed-
ding in general architectures and the sub-
types of interface ontologies mentioned above
are depicted graphically in Figure 1

aspects

Nirenburg and Raskin 1987
Nirenburg and Levin 1991  are attempts
to construct ontologies of the third type pure
maximally language independent ontologies
reecting the structure of the world I have
already discussed some of the diculties of
designing such ontologies without building up
through an account of language Psycholog-
ical research might oer another source of
evidence for such ontologies as would de-
tailed sociological work on the commonsense
It is however unclear whether any
such methodology will be able to avoid the
relationship to language observed above and
so I will now concentrate on ontologies which
are at least intended to be related explicitly
to language
32 Mixed ontologies
An example of a mixed ontology  ie one
where there is no extensive treatment of the
relation between the world knowledge ontol-
ogy and grammar and lexis maintained sepa-
rate to the ontology itself  is the approach
taken in the lilog natural language under-
ing project Herzog and Rollinger 1991 de-
tails of the ontology are given in for exam-
ple Klose and von Luck 1991 Pirlein 1991
Klose et al 1991 and details of the rela-
tion between linguistic forms and concep-
tual representations are given in for exam-
ple Gust 1991 Bosch 1991 It may at rst
glance appear strange to classify lilog here
since the approach to the relation between
linguistic form and world knowledge draws
heavily on Bierwisch 1982s theory of se-
mantics where to cite Gust 1991s state-
ment of Bierwischs position
   semantic
forms and conceptual structures belong to
dierent and strictly discriminated levels
Bosch 1991 also makes it very clear that
he holds this distinction to be crucial for
making progress in semantics and knowledge
representation However when the mod-
elling of the approach is examined we nd
that this distinction of levels comes under
attack For example both semantic forms
which are derivable from the lexicon and from
grammatical analysis and conceptual forms
are represented in a single language the se-
language
mantic language being a subset of the con-
ceptual
Bosch 1991 p248 and
are freely combinable moreover Gust 1991
p133 maintains that
there are continuous
variations between semantic forms and con-
ceptual structures This gives rise to lexi-
cal entries which directly contain categories of
an ontology which also contains categories of
real-world knowledge The relation between
conceptual knowledge and grammatical and
lexical form is thus handled by logically ma-
nipulating categories from a single ontology
until categories are found that possess links to
grammatical or lexical entries  this is pre-
cisely the architecture consistent with a mixed
ontology as shown in Figure 1
An illustration of the nonseparation of of
linguistic information and conceptual infor-
mation typical of ontologies of this type can be
seen in the following taken from Bosch 1991
p251 In order to nd the interpretation in
context of the lexeme school as it is used
arguably dierently in examples such as
a The school made a major donation
b The school has a at roof
A general lexical semantic entry for the lex-
eme is retrieved thus
SEMschool  X PURPOSE X
PROCESSES OF LEARNING AND TEACHING
This is then interpreted by applying a given
contextualizing function selected depending
on the basis of the semantic interpretation of
the predicate in the lexicogrammatical repre-
sentation Those for the example sentences
would be
a X INSTITUTION X  SEM X
b X BUILDING X  SEM X
Combining the semantic entry and the con-
textualizing function gives the required con-
ceptual concept that is the referent of the lex-
eme in context  ie that school is inter-
preted as either an institution or a building
All of the undened predicates found in these
logical expressions eg institution pur-
pose etc are sorts dened in the ontology
A direct link is therefore constructed from lex-
icogrammatical information and chunks of in-
formation appropriate for the conceptual level
of organization As we shall see in Section 42
this direct linking is a common property of
nlp systems based on the common notion of
semantics and arises out of a view of the lin-
guistic system that collapses together several
important distinctions
33 Interface ontologies
The second and third types of ontology 
the interface and conceptual types  usu-
ally occur at least theoretically
same architecture
Although it
is also
the case that some systems address them-
selves to the organization of the interface on-
tology without specifying how the concep-
tual ontology will
This latter po-
sition is common for systems that are in-
tended as general purpose nlp systems re-
usable across dierent domains and appli-
cations Examples of such systems include
both parsers and generators such as the Pen-
man system Mann and Matthiessen 1985
Penman Project 1989
Mumble-
86 Meteer et al 1987 Here the problem of
how to organize the interface with external
applications where those applications are not
known in advance has naturally focused at-
tention on organizations of information appro-
priate for interfacing The approach to this
developed within the Penman project in terms
of the Upper Model has become more or less
typical of how this is achieved  although to
what extent this architecture has arisen inde-
pendently across systems is unclear The ini-
tial formulation of the Upper Model was based
on work by MAK Halliday Halliday 1982
William Mann and Christian Matthiessen8
The general statement of the interface prob-
lem for nlp systems is that machine-internal
information needs to be related to strategies
for expressing that information in some natu-
8The development of the Upper Model ontology
from its inception as the Upper structure of the
janus project of ISI and BBN up to its inclu-
sion as a standard component of the current Pen-
man text generation system is covered by the follow-
ing research reports Mann 1985 Mann et al 1985
Moore and Arens 1985 Bateman et al 1990 The
rst detailed theoretical precursor to the ontology was
set out in 1985 by Halliday and Matthiessen as a gen-
eral organization for an experiential semantics this
was called the Bloomington Lattice The sub-
sequent development of the Upper Model has devi-
ated somewhat from the purely linguistically moti-
vated work this will be discussed in more detail below
ral language This could be done in a domain-
specic way by coding how the application do-
main requires its information to appear This
is clearly problematic however it requires de-
tailed knowledge on the part of the system
builder both of how the generator controls
its output forms and the kinds of information
that the application domain contains A more
general solution to the problem of dening a
mapping between knowledge and its linguis-
tic expression is to provide a classication of
any particular instances of facts states of af-
fairs situations etc that occur in terms of a
set of general objects and relations of specied
types that behave systematically with respect
to their possible linguistic realizations This
classication has itself many of the properties
of an ontology eg it is a hierachical organi-
zation of sorts and roles  although by virtue
of its motivation in linguistic realization it
must be seen as a strictly linguistically mo-
tivated ontology Examples here include as-
pects of Meteer 1989s Text Structure Ob-
jects in the spokesman text generator

linguistic distinctions that do not achieve
a qualitative increase in abstraction
 the ontology can be too deep
in that
it is no longer possible to draw any for-
mally speciable connection between the
constructs posited and the linguistic evi-
dence taken as motivating them
Both extreme situations occur and both re-
duce the value of the ontology as an eec-
tive interface medium The former problem
will be accompanied by an increased diculty
in linking the ontology to information of par-
ticular domains  regardless of whether this
information is considered as a separate kind
of information or as more specic details of
the same kind of information and the sec-
ond problem will be accompanied both by an
increased diculty in linking with grammar
and lexis and by the problems induced by
poorer linguistic constraints mentioned above
The latter situation then often places a heav-
ier reliance on internal or formal constraints
on organization cf eg Weischedel 1989
Horacek 1989 and what Lang 1991 p468
terms sortal restictions which while impor-
tant do not provide sucient grounds for de-
ducing very much detailed actual content by
themselves
also the ontology of the acord system
331 Interface ontologies that are not
   the aim of the sort system is not
to reect the characteristics of real
world objects and events referred to
by linguistic expressions but rather
to systematize the ontological struc-
ture evidenced by linguistic expres-
sions Moens et al 1989 p178
and of course the Upper Model of the Pen-
man system that I will describe in more detail
The position that such an interface ontology
holds between surface details of a language
and more abstract knowledge is however an
uneasy one As suggested above it is possi-
ble to dierentiate among such ontologies ac-
cording to whether they orientate themselves
more towards less abstract or towards more
abstract levels of representation This brings
with it two potential problems in ontology de-
 the ontology can be too shallow in that
its categories are a too direct recoding of
abstract enough
Interface ontologies exhibiting the former
problem are very common and so it is worth-
while giving a slightly more detailed exam-
ple of the problems that arise One such
ontology is that constituted by the seman-
tic relations used within the german compo-
nent of the eurotra project Steiner 1987
Steiner et al 1987
Steiner and Reuther 1989 These relations
are a further development of earlier work by
Fawcett  particularly his work on transitiv-
ity in English eg Fawcett 1987 Fawcett
proposes a semantically motivated taxonomy
of process types analogously to the approach
taken in Halliday 1985 but diering in the
actual categories adopted Each process type
has some distinctive set of possible partici-
pants  the approach thus diers from early
accounts of semantic participants such as
Case Grammar Fillmore 1968 where the
participant relationships were often dened
separately from the processes in which they
participate and further articulates concep-
tions of thematic relations such as those
found in Lexical-functional grammar cf
Hale and Keyser 1986
Levin 1987 and Government and Binding
theory Jackendo 1987 The eurotra-d
work has made renements to the proposed
taxonomy on the basis of multi-lingual ev-
idence particularly from German so as to
provide explicit syntactic tests for the assign-
ment of processes to each of the various pro-
cess types
It is then explicitly stated that
the resulting process types described are no
longer primarily semantic since their classi-
cation is based exclusively on dierentiation
by syntactic criteria Therefore although this
has produced a framework within which pro-
cesses can be classied according to the given
taxonomy with a high degree of inter-coder
consistency which is an important criterion
in large distributed projects such as euro-
its eectiveness as a step towards a
higher level of abstract information has been
restricted This can be seen in the follow-
ing example of process classication given in
Steiner and Reuther 1989 For the clause
That she gave no answer means that she
agrees with the proposal
both subject and object are realized by that-
clauses and the only possible classication ac-
cording to the syntactic tests is then one of
a mental process with two phenomena How-
ever semantically the process also has strong
elements of a relation between the proposi-
tions involved Similar examples in German
are the following the verb retten    vor
Da er gut schwimmen konnte rettete
ihn vor dem Ertrinken
That he could swim well saved him from
drowning
again resembles a relational process but has to
be assigned to mental according to the crite-
ria formulated the process reden to speak
talk which would intuitively seem to be some
kind of communication verb cannot enter into
constructions of the form
 Peter redet Karl kommt morgen
Peter speaks Karl is coming tomorrow
and so does not receive a communication verb
classication and the form
 Peter redet da Karl kommt
Peter speaks that Karl is coming
cannot occur so it may not even receive a men-
tal reading  the only acceptable forms pos-
sible eg
Peter redet Unsinn
Peter speaks nonsense
Peter redet mit Paul Peter speaks with Paul
require an action classication just as the cor-
responding English processes would These
problems provide evidence that the syntactic
tests need to be made more subtle or more
elaborate in order to be able to reveal se-
mantic distinctions more reliably In addition
there is no account suggested of how this level
of representation can link to more abstract
levels of representation such as a conceptual
ontology
A similar case of this probably contributes
to some of the diculties that arise with
the use of Lexical Semantic Structures lss
and Jackendo 1983s Lexical Conceptual
Structures lcs for translation  the for-
mer as described by Dorr 1991 the lat-
ter by Nirenburg and Levin 1991
structures are tightly bound to possible sur-
face forms by formally specied linking rules
eg Levin 1987 These rules partition the
lss or lcs into classes reecting the dierent
realizational behaviour of their categories Al-
though it is also then sometimes possible to
assign to these classes particular semantic
features this has still not yet been found to
be suciently abstract to support a motivated
construction of the corresponding conceptual
ontology  as the example of the motivation
for including the concept aord for Russian
that I cited above shows The nal selection of
conceptual ontological sorts in this case then
shows similarities both with that described for
lilog ie by applying a mixture of lexical
grammatical and domain knowledge criteria
and with the pure ai techniques of cyc and
others In the longer term therefore similar
problems will occur
As a nal example of the problems of lack
of abstraction I will mention some that have
arisen in our development and use of the the
Penman Upper Model The Upper Model
for reasons that I will describe below does
succeed in being more abstract than the se-
mantic relations adopted for example within
eurotra-d The organization of an Upper
Model achieves greater semantic coherence
grouping together distinctions that may be
used by a variety of distinct grammatical re-
sources in a grammar For example the re-
lationships between process and participants
may drive the organization of clauses but
they may equally drive the organization of
head and modiers in nominal groups The
nature of the process-participant relationships
is not arguably altered by their realizational
form Upper Model generalizations might
then express the commonality that unites the
following area of variation
A shoots B
B was shot at T
the shooting of B by A
As shooting of B
Bs shooting
the shooting at P
the P shooting
the T shooting
under a single specication9
process
shootmurdererAmurderedBtimeTplaceP
Categories in the Upper Model are then cap-
turing generalizations which are not appropri-
ately expressed within the grammar A fur-
ther example drawn from the 1989 version of
the Upper Model is the possible grammati-
cal realizations of the concept of generalized
possession This concept should be seen as
being realized by possible selections from all
the grammatical systems to do with posses-
sion Thus the semantics of the following
forms all make reference to this single Upper
Model concept
the doors handle
the handle of the door
the handle that the door has
the door handle
the handle is part of the door
For a more extensive sets of examples
lexico-grammatical variation that
is intended to support
the Upper Model
see Bateman 1989 Bateman 1990a
9Although the actual representation used in the
Upper Model reies both predicates and the re-
lations holding between predicates and their ar-
guments cf
Mann et al 1985 Hobbs et al 1987
Bateman et al 1990
This means that the Upper Model does suc-
ceed in achieving a suciently high degree
of abstraction as to be useful as an inter-
face medium This increase in abstraction
also makes the ontology better suited to link-
ing with more abstract levels of information10
The Penman system has been successfully in-
terfaced with a number of applications 
mostly expert systems but also text planners
 where domain knowledge is represented It
is then an example of an ontology that medi-
ates the relationship between lexico-grammar
and world knowledge without losing the neces-
sary formal connection with the grammar and
lexis Moreover it moves beyond problems
such as that recognized for the eurotra-d
classication of process types that11
The classication system proposed by
eurotra-d proceeds in a strictly syn-
tactic way
   From the standpoint
of generation this solution is problem-
it would be preferable to have
a semantic classication that general-
izes across such surface syntactic sub-
tleties Heid et al 1988 p158
To the extent that it is successful this is pre-
cisely what the Upper Model provides
achieves this by being based very closely not
only on a particular specied grammar  no
concepts are admitted into the Upper Model
for example unless they have a direct and
speciable consequence for the operation of the
grammar  but also on a grammar which is it-
self already more abstract than a constituency
grammar I shall describe this in more detail
The Upper Model thus stands as a signif-
icant step forward in dealing with the prob-
lem of interfacing with a general nlp system
The Upper Model decomposes the mapping
problem inherent in relating domain knowl-
edge with its possibilities for linguistic expres-
sion by establishing a level of linguistically
motivated knowledge organization specically
constructed as a reponse to the task of con-
straining linguistic realizations While it may
10So much so that it has sometimes been our ex-
perience that the domain model of some application
domains has been altered in the light of the consistent
organization that the Upper Model brings to bear
11This problem arose while attempting to interface
the level of input specication for an existing genera-
tor of German semsyn cf Rosner 1988 with the
eurotra-d semantic relations
not be reasonable to insist that application do-
mains organize their knowledge in terms that
respect linguistic realizations  as this may
not provide suitable organizations for eg
domain-internal reasoning  we have found
that it is reasonable indeed essential that do-
main knowledge be so organized if it is also
to support expression in natural language re-
lying on general natural language processing
capabilities
The general types constructed within the
Upper Model necessarily respect generaliza-
tions concerning how distinct semantic types
can be realized We then achieve the neces-
sary link between particular domain knowl-
edge and the Upper model by having an ap-
plication classify its knowledge organization
in terms of the general semantic categories
that the Upper Model provides This should
not require any expertise in grammar or in
the mapping between Upper Model and gram-
mar An application needs only to concern it-
self with the meaning of its own knowledge
and not with ne details of linguistic form
This classication functions solely as an in-
terface between domain knowledge and Up-
per Model it does not interfere with domain-
internal organization The text generation
system is then responsible for realizing the
semantic types of the level of meaning with
appropriate grammatical forms12 Further
when this classication has been established
for a given application application concepts
can be used freely in input specications since
their possibilities for linguistic realization are
then known Interfacing with such a system
is thus radically simplied on two counts
 much of the information specic to lan-
guage processing is factored out of the
input specications required and into the
relationship between Upper Model and
linguistic resources
 the need for domain-specic linguistic
processing rules is greatly reduced since
the Upper Model provides a domain-
independent general and reusable con-
ceptual organization that may be used
to classify all domain-specic knowledge
handled
penman system by the grammars inquiry semantics
which has been described and illustrated extensively
elsewhere cf Penman Project 1989 and see Sec-
tion 42 below
when linguistic processing is to be per-
formed
An example of the simplication that use
of the Upper Model oers for a text gener-
ation system interface language can be seen
by contrasting the input specication re-
quired for generators that work with realiza-
tion classes that are less abstract than those
of the Upper Model  such as eg mumble-
86 Meteer et al 1987 or unication-based
frameworks
such as McKeown and Paris 1987 and the
Lexical Functional Grammar LFG approach
of Momma and Dorre 1987  with the in-
put required for Penman13 Figure 2 shows
corresponding inputs for the generation of
the simple clause Fluy is chasing little
mice The appropriate classication of do-
main knowledge concepts such as chase dog
mouse and little in terms of the general se-
mantic types of the Upper Model in this case
directed-action object object and size respec-
tively  cf Bateman et al 1990 automati-
cally provides information about syntactic re-
alization that needs to be explicitly stated in
mumble-
86 input eg S-V-O two-explicit-args
np-common-noun
restrictive-modifier
adjective Thus for example the classi-
cation of a concept mouse as an object in the
Upper Model is sucient for the grammar to
consider a realization such as in mumble-
86 terms a general-np with a particular
np-common-noun and accessories of gender
neuter Similarly the classication of chase
as a directed-action opens up linguistic re-
alization possibilities including clauses with
a certain class of transitive verbs and char-
acteristic possibilities for participants cor-
responding nominalizations etc Such low-
level syntactic information is redundant for
the penman input14 Similar illustrative in-
13Note that this is not intended to single out these
approaches at all the problem is quite general and oc-
curs whenever there is no ontology available for orga-
nizing information at a more abstract level than that
imposed by the grammar Further as already noted
most current nlp developments are moving in a direc-
tion analogous to that taken in our work on the Upper
14Moreover when additional
information is re-
quired that information is supplied in semantic terms
rather than in terms of morphosyntactic labeling such
as number plural  in this case this is represented
puts forms can easily be imagined for other
types of syntactically oriented grammar and
lexis components
The further domain-independence of the
Upper Model is shown in the following ex-
ample of text generation control Consider
two rather dierent domains a navy database
of ships and an expert system for digital
circuit diagnosis15
The navy data base
contains information concerning ships sub-
marines ports geographical regions etc and
the kinds of activities that ships submarines
can take part in The digital circuit
diagnosis expert system contains information
about subcomponents of digital circuits the
kinds of connections between those subcom-
ponents their possible functions etc A typi-
cal sentence from each domain might be
circuit domain The faulty system is
connected to the input
navy domain The ship which was
inoperative is sailing to Sasebo
The input specications for both of these sen-
tences are shown in Figure 3 These spec-
ications freely intermix Upper Model roles
and concepts eg domain range property-
ascription and the respective domain roles
and concepts eg system faulty input des-
tination sail ship inoperative Both forms
are rendered interpretable by the subordi-
nation of the domain concepts to the sin-
gle generalized hierarchy of the Upper Model
This is illustrated graphically in Figure 4
Here we see the single hierarchy of the Up-
per Model being used to subordinate concepts
from the two domains The domain concept
system for example is subordinated to the
Upper Model concept object domain concept
inoperative to Upper Model concept qual-
ity etc By virtue of these subordinations
the grammar and semantics of the generator
can interpret the input specications in order
to produce appropriate linguistic realizations
the Upper Model concept object licenses a par-
ticular set of realizations as do the concepts
in inquiry semantics by the inquiry response pairs
multiplicity-q multiple and singularity-q nonsin-
gular This is also the case for tense but I have
abbreviated the semantic specication here For de-
scriptions of all these distinctions in detail see the
penman documentation Penman Project 1989
15These are in fact two domains with which we
have had experience generating texts using the Upper
quality material-process etc16
Despite the progress that has been made
with the Upper Model as a potential interface
ontology it is still the case that the mappings
between grammatical forms and the categories
of the Upper Model ontology are not yet rich
enough to ensure entirely appropriate seman-
tic classications  entirely anologously to
the case with the explicitly syntactically ori-
ented categories of the eurotra-d semantic
relations In an attempt to make the deni-
tions of the Upper Model concepts more acces-
sible to users of the Penman system these def-
initions have been pushed towards an intepre-
tation of the Upper Model as predominantly a
hierarchy of generalizations about possible lin-
guistic realizations in English This approach
permits a very straightforward control of the
grammar but compromises some of the seman-
tic integrity Some simple examples of this
may be seen in the following
In the then current version of the gram-
mar the following clause which is an ex-
ample that arose during development of Jo-
hanna Moores Program Enhancer Advisor
pea system Moore 198917
X is dened as Y
had to be constructed from a process dene
and an adjunct of role-playing to produce
the prepositional phrase as Y This contrasts
with a more semantically oriented discrimina-
tion of process types which could take per-
haps a process of dening with three neces-
sary participants a dener a dened and a
denition and state how these are realized di-
rectly In the realization class view as we have
it now the process of dening has to be ex-
plicitly decomposed semantically at the level
of the Upper Model into a process and a rela-
tionship of role-playing This is not intuitively
obvious indeed a user has to know how the
grammar generates as-prepositional phrases in
order to arrive at the correct Upper Model
classication in order to be able to generate
the clause This is dangerously close to the
amount of low-level syntactic detail that needs
to be provided for a Functional Unication
Grammar or Mumble-86

This is not an isolated case Other problem-
atic assignments in the pea domain include
 The process call as in The boy is called
John Presently call is classied as a
dispositive-material-action from UM-89
boy becomes the actee and the name
John becomes a recipient No actor
is specied and so a passive construction
appears due to a then current shortcut
dened for the textual reasoning that the
grammar initiates for selection of active-
passive clauses
 The process generalize to as in The re-
sult can be generalized to other cases
Here generalize is again a straightforward
nondirected-action and to other cases is
specied as a destination spatio-temporal
circumstance in UM-89 in order to gen-
erate the preposition
In all of these cases the role assignments
are only being used in order to achieve the
required syntactic pattern given by the par-
ticular state of the grammar of the Penman
system the Nigel grammar of English In the
rst example the model for the clause being
used is that of give since this class of verbs
is bitransitive in the second the technique
adopted is as with the case of dene as above
where a circumstantial role is selected purely
in order to guarantee the desired preposition
Although in these cases it is reasonably clear
that both grammar and Upper Model would
need to be extended to include the desired
process types in general the theoretical sta-
tus of using arbitrary assignments of concepts
to the Upper Model and selections of roles to
be expressed has not been made suciently
clear This technique is or rather should
only be employed when it is not possible to
extend the grammar and ontology appropri-
ately only when the grammar has to be taken
as xed eg because it is being applied by
a user that does not have access to the inter-
nal organization of the grammar is this kind
of strategy defensible As a general technique
the strategy has to be strongly rejected on the-
oretical grounds However note that without
a commitment to semantic coherence there
is little reason not to use the Upper Model
in this way we have already seen the similar
situation in the use of the eurotra-d sys-
tem of semantic relations where commitment

DOMAIN MODELS


































Figure 4 Upper Model organization reuse with diering domains
to semantic coherence has been explicitly re-
jected in favor of more readily operationalize-
able grammatical critera
Another set of related problems arises when
semantically similar processes have dierent
syntactic realization Consider for example
the two clause types
x is like y
x resembles y
features
Although a user might wish to place these
similarly in the Upper Model grammatically
they are rather dierent The former requires
the grammatical features circumstantial-
attribute manner-participant be-intensive
circumstantial-
the latter has
ascription circumstantial-process
present Nigel grammar
these are dis-
tinguished by the inquiry circumstantial-
ascription-q which would need to examine the
Upper Model Therefore in order to obtain
the diering syntactic structures a further dis-
tinction would need to be set up at the Upper
Model level
The realization class view therefore makes
it dicult for users to formulate their input
specication to the system unless they know
precisely the form of linguistic expression that
they require Since the realizational link be-
tween Upper Model categories and Nigel has
been made so tight for the very purposes
of achieving readily describable criteria it is
sometimes and increasingly once more users
attempt more varied modelling necessary to
subordinate a concept in a counter-intuitive
position simply in order for the language re-
quired to result This certainly undermines
the semantic integrity of the Upper Model as
an interface ontology and moves the entire
classication towards a less abstract level of
information It needs to be remembered how-
ever that only when the grammar is xed is
a specic determinate Upper Model required
 furthermore that Upper Model is even par-
tially determined by the particular grammar
that is specied
Finally one further problem with the in-
terface ontology instantiated by the Penman
Upper Model lies precisely in the simplicity of
the relationship constructed betweeen domain
model and Upper Model We have seen that
this is achieved by literally classifying in the
formal sense of adding into the subsumption
lattice domain model concepts in terms of the
categories from the Upper Model Following
this operation the Upper Model and the do-
main model form a single inheritance hierar-
chy and the domain concepts directly inherit
the possibilities for surface realization dened
for the Upper Model concepts This opera-
tion is currently performed only once for each
domain and while simplifying input expres-
sions it means that the relationship between
domain and Upper Model is not being han-
dled particularly exibly
In fact once the
classication is complete the complete ontol-
ogy can be interpreted as having collapsed
into a mixed ontology of the type described
for lilog both particular domain concepts
and general linguistically motivated concepts
occur in the same subsumption lattice This
treatment of the relationship between a po-
tential conceptual ontology containing detail
knowledge of a domain and the interface on-
tology containing a semantic classication of
possibilities for linguistic expression needs to
be made considerably more exible to avoid
the problems of mixed ontologies described
both above and below
332 Interface ontologies that are too
abstract
Interface ontologies exhibiting the problem of
being too abstract are more commonly found
in small scale systems the problem of not be-
ing able to specify the mapping down to gram-
mar and lexis in a convenient and expandable
form often prevents large-scale development
from getting very far Such projects eg
polygloss acord and many others begin
by adopting classes of categories developed
for example in analytical philosophy or nat-
ural language semantics  such as the event
types of Vendler 1967 temporal categories
such as those of Moens and Steedman 1988
the semantico-conceptual predicates pro-
posed by Jackendo 1983 Jackendo 1990
event structures of Pustejovsky 1988 and
many others As long as restricted grammat-
ical possibilities are entertained for example
to enable research on particular focused areas
of semantics-syntax then such ontologies are
adequate  even useful since the focusing al-
lows greater depth in the semantic account to
be achieved It should also be the case how-
ever that this work then feeds back into more
general and broader ontology work and this
happens much too rarely It is also sometimes
unclear what the relationship of these ontolo-
gies would be to a more abstract conceptual
ontology  this may be expressed formally
for example in terms of a model-semantic the-
ory but the details are often left for future
333 Brief discussion
It is clear that ontologies of the interface
type that are more closely bound to lan-
guage are nevertheless most useful for nlp
systems that want to deal with a wider va-
riety of actual language phenomena The in-
crease in abstraction may not be so very great
in comparison to a desired conceptual ontol-
ogy but it is nevertheless better than work-
ing with grammar and lexis directly Such
work is also much more likely to be sta-
ble in the face of changing theoretical posi-
tions and more justiable with respect to ac-
tual linguistic data It is then natural that
one further type of nlp projects attacking
the problem of large-scale ontology construc-
tion is that of dictionary-oriented projects
such as edr Matsukawa and Yokota 1991
and acquilex Calzolari 1991 The edr
project aims at producing a concept dictio-
nary containing 400000 word senses for En-
glish and Japanese and acquilex is con-
cerned with producing a re-usable lexical
knowledge base that classies entries accord-
ing to taxonomies of semantic categories and
relations between those categories
projects have constructed sizeable semantic
taxonomies relying strongly on dierences in
lexico-grammatical realization for the cate-
gories adopted The taxonomy organization
and categories found in acquilex have simi-
larities to the view of lexical semantics pro-
posed by Pustejovsky 1991 where again
oppositions in linguistic behavior are an es-
sential motivating criterion Another large
project partly leading up to this work and
now related to the kbmt work mentioned
above was the MIT Lexicon Project where
extensive classication of lexemes was under-
taken on the basis of the diering grammatical
patterns that the lexemes may enter into
Although the construction of large knowl-
edge bases at this level of abstraction is bound
to oer a denite improvement in our abil-
ity to rely on linguistic motivations in future
ontology design their availability will not of
itself bring about that design It is still neces-
sary to consider methodologies for using such
information so that appropriate ontologies for
general nlp use can be constructed There-
fore in the next section I will relate the kinds
of ontologies that we have seen in this section
to compatible linguistic theories Without a
broader view of what is being done linguisti-
cally when categories for a particular kind of
ontology are proposed I believe it is unlikely
that progress will be made As long as the
categories developed are suciently close to
the surface details of language to remain ob-
jectively veriable ie remain in the realms
of syntax and lexico-grammatically oriented
interface ontologies useful classications can
be constructed For more abstract levels how-
ever the support of theory become crucial for
dening methodologies questions and possi-
ble solutions
4 Linguistic
support
otherwise for the ontol-
ogy types
In this section I will follow the ordering of the
discussion of ontology types of the previous
section
ie rst linguistic theories compat-
ible with the design of mixed ontologies will
be mentioned followed by the kind of linguis-
tic theory that is more supportive of distinct
interface and conceptual ontologies I will not
raise the issue here of the relationship between
conceptual ontologies and possible linguistic
theories since one of the dening phrases that
is often used about this level of abstraction is
its very extra-linguisticness This does how-
ever depend on the view of the linguistic sys-
tem that is adopted and I will mention some-
thing about this later Finally in this section
I discuss some disadvantages of the former ap-
proaches when considered as a methodology
for developing the kinds of resources neces-
sary for nlp systems
Before beginning the discussion I should
however briey note the motivation for an
exclusion of forms of semantics such as sit-
uation semantics model-theoretic semantics
of various kinds etc below Such accounts
are not immediately relevant to the discus-
sion at hand precisely because they have not
been concerned with the construction of rep-
resentations that are directly supportive of
ontologies That is regardless of whether
the formal account of semantics proposed
in some particular framework contains sets
of predicates that are of mixed ontological
status or are purely conceptual or purely
linguistically semantic we nd one crucial
component of ontological engineering miss-
ing Those categories are not typically built
up into subsumption lattices of sorts shar-
ing various general properties of use for fur-
ther domain classication
It is clear that
many of these theoretical approaches could
easily move in this direction and with the
increased use of sorts in linguistic theory at
all levels of description some rst steps have
been taken eg
Sag and Pollard 1991
p78 Nerbonne 1992 However as pointed
out by Onyshvekych and Nirenburg 1991
The crucial point is that in order to
have an explanatory power the atoms
of a meaning representation language
must be interpreted in terms of an in-
dependently motivated model of the
world Moreover
if any realistic ex-
periments have to be performed with
such an nlp system this world model
sometimes called an ontology must be
actually built not only dened alge-
braically
Therefore until the problem of ontology con-
struction on a realistic scale itself becomes an
issue for an account that account remains of
less central concern for the current discussion
41 Mixed ontologies and lin-
guistic theory
The closest linguistic approaches to support
mixed ontology design such as that found in
lilog are perhaps surprisingly those com-
patible with the work of Jackendo 1983
Jackendo 1990 Jackendo adopts the po-
sition that the semantic level of representa-
tion with which he is concerned is also con-
ceptual ie common to modalities such as
language and vision Jackendo 1983 As
pointed out by Herweg 1991 approaches
that directly link syntax with conceptual in-
terpretation now occupy a rather standard po-
sition in mainstream linguistics and so there
are many approaches that could be described
That of Jackendo is probably one of the
most developed and well known in this di-
rection although there are also similarities
to be drawn with work in Cognitive Linguis-
tics Langacker 1987 Talmy 1987 and direc-
tions such as that of Wierzbicka 1988 All
of these approaches share an orientation to
language as an instrument for revealing facets
of conceptual organization This is stated
most clearly by Jackendo in terms of what
he terms the Grammatical Constraint
   it would be perverse not to take as
a working assumption that language is
a relatively ecient and accurate en-
coding of the information it conveys
To give up this assumption is to refuse
to look for systematicity in the rela-
tionship between syntax and semantics
A theorys deviations from ecient en-
coding must be rigorously justied for
what appears to be an irregular rela-
tionship between syntax and semantics
may turn out merely to be a bad theory
of one or the other Jackendo 1983
Given his equation of semantic structure and
conceptual structure this becomes largely
equivalent to statements such as the follow-
ing describing the basic claim of of cognitive
linguistics
 across the spectrum of languages
the grammatical elements that are en-
countered taken together specify a
crucial set of concepts This set is
highly restricted only certain concepts
appear in it and not others   This
set of grammatically specied notions
collectively constitutes the fundamental
conceptual structuring system of lan-
guage That is this cross-linguistically
select set of grammatically specied
concepts provides the basic schematic
framework for conceptual organization
within the cognitive domain of
guage Talmy 1987 p1656
This position also appears in the approach
of Pustejovsky to the relation between lex-
emes and their interpretation in context as
he writes
The meaning of words should somehow
reect the deeper conceptual struc-
tures in the system and the domain it
operates in This is tantamount to stat-
ing that the semantics of natural lan-
guage should be the image of nonlin-
guistic conceptual principles whatever
Pustejovsky 1991
structure
These approaches are all described by the rst
architecture depicted in the diagram of Fig-
ure 1 Each suggests that there is a portion
of the conceptual ontology that has a direct
linguistic connection and that that portion
should have just the same kind of organization
as the rest of the conceptual ontology A spec-
ication of the semantics of some expression
is simultaneously a possibly partial speci-
cation of a conceptual specication Again
this state of aairs receives a very explicit de-
scription from Jackendo
This account of the syntax-semantics
correspondence gives a principled ac-
count of the level of argument struc-
ture found in various versions of GB
and LFG  - a level of linguistic rep-
resentation that lists the arguments of
a verb with or without their -roles
Such a list can now be simply con-
structed from the set of indices in the
conceptual structure of the verb and
there is one index per syntactically ex-
pressed argument
In short argu-
ment structure can be thought of as
an abbreviation for the part of concep-
tual structure that is visible to the
syntax Jackendo 1983 p4045
By virtue of the Grammatical Constraint
therefore Jackendo adopts a very close bind-
ing of linguistic analysis and categories at
his semantico-conceptual
level of represen-
tation available linguistic realizations and
patternings lead directly to the positing of
corresponding categories and relationships
at the level of semanticconceptual struc-
ture In Jackendos case the linguistic ev-
idence admitted is organized in terms of X-
theory Chomsky 1980 Jackendo 1977 and
so close correspondences appear between cat-
egories of this theory and categories of the
semanticconceptual structure In particular
he states that
1  every major phrasal constituent in
the syntax of a sentence corresponds to
a conceptual constituent that belongs to
one of the major ontological categories
2  the lexical head X of a major phrasal
constituent corresponds to a function in
conceptual structure  a chunk of the
inner code with zero or more argument
places that must be lled in order to form
a complete conceptual constituent The
argument places are lled by the readings
of the major phrasal constituents strictly
subcategorized by X Jackendo 1983
Thus he suggests the following approxima-
tion to conceptual structure for the sen-
tence The man put the book on the table
Jackendo 1983 p68

putcid20 thing
oncid20 thing
the book cid21
the man cid21 cid20 thing
the table cid21 

This structure if we ignore the textual in-
formation represented abbreviated here with
the shows striking similarities with the in-
put specication described earlier for Penman
cf Figures 2 and 3 The structure may
be glossed as stating that a predicate put of
type event holds over three arguments the
rst two are of type thing the latter is an
on-relation of type place Each of the pred-
icates are taken to be dened as semantico-
conceptual categories motivated primarily by
linguistic patterning Further examples of the
motivation of semantico-conceptual categories
from linguistic evidence is the following list of
example categories oered by Jackendo
Interrogative probe
supports category
a What did you buy
b Where is my coat
c Where did they go
d What did you do
e What happened next
f How did you cook the eggs
g How long was the sh
thing
place
direction
action
event
manner
amount
Subsequently further categories of dierentia-
tions are made working from intuitions on the
meanings of sentences and their constituents
supported by example sentences Moreoever
analogously to the perceived relationship be-
tween syntactic structures and rules for their
well-formedness Jackendo takes the position
that the inter-relationships between the se-
manticconceptual categories will also be ex-
pressed in terms of well-formedness rules An
example for the category path is as follows

path 



away-from
The combination of a number of rules such
as these begins to dene a hierarchy of inter-
related categories analogous to the standard
hierarchical organization that I have assumed
appropriate for ontology construction
A comparison of Jackendos semantico-
conceptual categories with for example the
supercially very dierent categories arising
from cognitive linguistics is very illuminating
concerning the role that motivations from lan-
guage can play for ontology construction The
general methodology of proponents of cogni-
tive linguistics is to examine grammatical el-
ements  however these come to be dened 
in order to uncover the conceptual organiza-
tion they presuppose For example Talmy of-
fers the following break down of the thisthat
distinction in English
A closed-class element of this type
species the location of an indicated ob-
ject as being in eect on the speaker-
side or the non-speaker-side of a con-
ceptual partition drawn through space
or time or other qualitative dimen-
sion Talmy 1987 p168
This is summarized as
 a partition that divides a space into re-
gionssides
 the locatedness a particular relation of
a point or object idealizable as a point
within a region
 a side that is the same as or dierent
from
 a currently indicated object and a cur-
rently communicating entity
By sampling across a wide range of languages
the Cognitive Grammarian compiles a list of
such distinctions and attempts to provide in-
ternal organization and structure rooted in a
presumed linguistically relevant area of con-
ceptual organization The avor of this orga-
nization can be seen in the following examples
of proposed categories from Talmy
Dimension The category of
dimension has
two principal member notions space and
time The kind of entity that exists in space
is  in respectively continuous or discrete
form  matter or objects The kind of
entity existing in time is correspondingly
action or events    Talmy 1987 p174
This is schematized as
dimension
space 
continuous
discrete
objects
Plexity Plexity is a generalization of notions
such as singular and plural to cover actions
also For example
uniplex
b multiplex
A bird ew in He sighed once
Birds ew in
He kept sighing
Boundedness Boundedness is a generalization
of notions such as mass and count with re-
spect to nouns to include again actions in ad-
dition to objects This Talmy relates to im-
perfective and perfective and similar terms in
the treatment of verbs Essentially when
a quantity is specied as unbounded it is
conceived as continuing on indenitely with
no necessary characteristic of niteness in-
trinsic to it When a quantity is specied as
bounded it is conceived to be demarcated
as an individual unit entity Talmy 1987
p178 Similar far more formal expressions
of this idea can now be found in a number of
approaches eg Krifka 1989
Dividedness A quantity is
discrete
particulate
having breaks or interruptions
its composition
tity is
Talmy 1987 p180
is conceptualized as
through
the quan-
continuous
conceptualized as
Otherwise
These categories hold of a given quantity
simultaneously and so classify that quantity
along the dimensions described Moreover
dierent linguistic consequences are intended
to follow from each distinction Although
there are many interesting distinctions sug-
gested which could help enrich proposed on-
tologies along a number of dimensions the
lack of an accepted detailed grammatical
framework nevertheless limits the generaliza-
tions that can be found Langacker claims
   basic grammatical categories such
as noun verb adjective and ad-
verb are semantically denable The
entities referred to as nouns verbs etc
are symbolic units each with a seman-
tic and a phonological pole but it is
the former that determines the catego-
rization All members of a given class
share fundamental semantic properties
and their semantic poles thus instanti-
ate a single abstract schema subject to
reasonably explicit characterization A
noun for example is a symbolic struc-
ture whose semantic pole instantiates
the schema thing   In a similar fash-
ion a verb is said to designate a pro-
cess whereas adjectives and adverbs
designate dierent kinds of atemporal
relations Langacker 1987 p189
Although with the proposed conceptual cat-
egories restricted in this way to follow from
grammatical categories that are so directly
observable ie often inectional and word-
based such as singular and plural mass and
count nouns and verbs etc one would not
expect a particularly rich ontology in fact a
large number of nely dierentiated categories
are set up  primarily on the basis of con-
trastive examples that do not rely on detailed
syntactic analysis This shows conclusively
the value of examining a very wide range of
natural occuring examples in contrast to the
oft criticised eg Rohrer 1986 but nev-
ertheless still prominent tendency in main-
stream linguistics to study constructed ex-
amples in areas that illuminate the currently
fashionable linguistic phenomena Neverthe-
less the lack of a formally speciable mapping
between the categories proposed and linguistic
realization renders the consequences of estab-
lishing any particular set of categories almost
impossible to investigate and this is certainly
less of a problem in a contrasting account such
as that of Jackendo where the relation to a
detailed account of grammar and lexis is al-
ways clear The value noted above of being
able to test out and justify proposed categories
for ontologies formally applies here strongly
Jackendo is able therefore even on the basis
of rather limited linguistic breadth of motiva-
tion to suggest a more detailed set of cate-
gories and interrelationships The semantico-
conceptual representations are substantially
more abstract than syntactic classes as ev-
idenced by the generalizations that they per-
mit to be drawn but are nevertheless tied
reasonably precisely with possibilities for lin-
guistic expression An ideal situation would
therefore be to have a very broad detailed
and formally specied grammar capable of
describing very ne-grained grammatical and
lexical dierences
Even despite the lack of formally speci-
ed mappings to linguistic form within cog-
nitive linguistics
there has still been at
least one signicant application of its pro-
posed concepts in a computationally con-
text This is in their use to provide a sys-
tem of semantic features for stating mean-
ings to be preserved across languages in
machine translation Zelinsky-Wibbelt 1987
Zelinsky-Wibbelt 1988 Although the work
suers from the lack of explicit denition
that the conceptual categories have so far re-
ceived  making it dicult for coders us-
ing the semantic features reliably to clas-
sify the meanings that are involved  this
situation may be improved signicantly by
some current work in progress18 which is in-
tended to improve the necessary connection
between the semantic categories and their
linguistic realization The situation apply-
ing Jackendos categories in a computational
context has as would be expected been
more straightforward A number of proposals
have been made for such an application and
some have been implemented For example
Meteer 1988 comments on the possible or-
ganization of abstract linguistic terms at the
text message level for the sentence generator
Mumble-86 that a system such as Jackendos
could provide and we have already seen that
both Dorr 1987 Dorr 1990s work on the
unitran translation system and approaches
within kbmt Nirenburg and Levin 1991
have implemented aspects of the semantico-
conceptual structure19
18For example by Cornelia Zelinsky-Wibbelt and
Wiebke Ramm of IAIEurotra-D on syntactic tests
that coders could apply to resolve dicult cases
19Further analogous areas of research which often
fall somewhere between the explicit grammatical foun-
dation attempted by Jackendo and the until now
more impressionistic linguistic motivations of Lan-
gacker and others
include the large body of work
on the conceptualization and linguistic expression of
spatial-temporal information eg Herskovits 1986
Bierwisch and Lang 1989 and many others
42 Interface ontologies and lin-
guistic theory
In contrast to the accounts of the previous
section the separation of information found
in the interface ontology and a more abstract
conceptual ontology is consonant with theo-
retical positions that assume a higher degree
of stratication in the linguistic system The
mixed ontology view goes well with a stan-
dard syntax-semantics-pragmatics distinction
where semantics includes the conceptual rep-
resentation and pragmatics provides pro-
cedures that operate over the semantico-
conceptual representation to produce active
interpretations in context In this sense prag-
matics is not a further stratum in a linguis-
tic system and has a distinct theoretical sta-
tus to that of syntax or semantics
In con-
trast to this the interface ontology architec-
ture suggests at least a three-way stratica-
tion between lexico-grammatical information
semantic information and a contextualizing
level of conceptual
information Each of
these strata appears to have rather similar
formal properties most of the information of
each for example would appear to be repre-
sentable as a subsumption lattice dened over
sorts possibly augmented with structured in-
heritance20
I have already mentioned one view of the
linguistic system that seems compatible with
this stratication
the approach to seman-
tics and context proposed by Bierwisch 1982
Bierwisch and Lang 1989 that acted as one
inuence for the lilog design  even though
the nal specication of the ontology within
lilog does not seem to have remained in
the spirit of this theory Within the linguis-
tic model of Bierwisch conceptual represen-
tations are maintained strictly separate from
semantic representations and semantic ex-
pressions are used to constrain construction
of conceptual expressions during interpreta-
tion Thus words actually lexicogrammat-
ical patterns are related to semantic forms
which determine functions from contexts to
conceptual structures The distinction be-
tween the two levels in this kind of two-level
semantics is nicely summarized by Michael
Herweg as follows
20Current work in information-based syntax makes
this point for syntax Pollard and Sag 1987
Semantic representations are struc-
tured congurations of semantic units
which on the one hand are deter-
mined by the grammatical system of
the language in question and on the
other hand are grounded in  or
motivated by  the conceptual sys-
   Conceptual representations
are structured congurations of concep-
tual units which are mental representa-
tions of certain aspects of the external
world Herweg 1991 p1523
The two classes of categories  the semantic
and the conceptual  thus have very dierent
theoretical statuses and allow very dierent
kinds of motivations This is therefore pre-
cisely the kind of structuring of the linguistic
system that one requires to support the use of
interface and conceptual type ontologies
The most successful of the interface ontolo-
gies described in Section 33 the Penman Up-
per Model clearly has a natural relation to
the stratication found in this kind of two-
level semantics For example the sorts of the
Upper Model are determined by the gram-
matical system concretely the Nigel gram-
mar component of the Penman system as is
required Although there is also a relation-
ship to be drawn with accounts that are ex-
plicitly seeking semantic organizations closely
linked to language regardless of these organi-
zations further embedding at higher levels of
abstraction21 the relation between a proper
view of the Upper Model and two-level se-
mantics becomes even closer when we exam-
ine instead of the Upper Model rather the
theoretical position of which the Upper Model
is only a very partial instantiation ie that
of systemic-functional theory Halliday 1961
Halliday 1978
Matthiessen and Halliday forthcoming
Systemic-functional theory is a highly strat-
ied general linguistic theory with respect to
which the Penman text generation and its de-
scendents have been and continue to be de-
veloped
In some ways perhaps analogously
to the situation in lilog many aspects of the
current implementation of the Penman system
are not accurate instantiations of that theory
Of particular importance here is the very in-
stantiation of the concept of linguistic strata
21Or alternatively by seeking an embedding in an
account such as model-theoretic semantics to bottom
out in a formally speciable way
 since it is precisely this construct which
is necessary for motivating the kind of multi-
levelled representation that we nd in inter-
face ontologies and their contextualizing con-
ceptual ontologies
The notion of stratication in systemic-
functional theory is depicted diagrammati-
cally in Figure 5 The linguistic system
is broken down here into three strata
icogrammar semantics and context Be-
tween each stratum the same relationship
 that of realization  holds
Systemic-
functional theory is essentially a functional
theory ie one that is concerned crucially
with the functions that language fullls in
particular contexts and this informs the un-
derstanding of the realization relationship be-
tween strata as follows Each higher-level ie
more abstract stratum is seen as providing
the functional motivation for the next lower-
level stratum and each lower-level stratum is
seen as providing a resource that generalizes
across the possibilities of the next-higher stra-
tum Halliday 1978 This gives us a more de-
tailed view on how strata in the linguistic sys-
tem interact than that usually found in strat-
ied accounts Additionally each higher-level
stratum is seen as contextualizing the levels
beneath
The organization of the Penman-style ar-
chitecture version of systemic theory instan-
tiates the stratication as follows Near-
est the surface there are realization state-
ments of syntagmatic organization or syntac-
tic form These statements are classied in
terms of their potential for expressing commu-
nicative functions that are realized grammati-
cally such as assertingquestioningordering
activepassive etc
this denotes paradig-
matic organization and is represented in terms
of a grammatical system network This or-
ganization captures the possible alternatives
that are available given any choices that
have already been made
ie a collection
of paradigms of the form a linguistic unit
of type A is either an A of functional sub-
type X or an A of functional subtype Y    
or an A of functional subtype Z are given
At each level these subtypes are disjoint and
serve to successively classify linguistic units
along ever more nely discriminated dimen-
sions This formulation of classications in
terms of increasingly ne discrimination is
in systemic-functional linguistics termed the
principle of delicacy The grammatical com-
municative functions are then in turn moti-
vated by semantic distinctions that classify se-
mantic circumstances according to the gram-
matical features which are appropriate to ex-
press those situations this classication is the
combined responsibility of choosers and in-
quiries Mann 1983 Finally the possibili-
ties for classication that the inquiries have
are dened in terms of the abstract ontol-
ogy of the Upper Model In relation to Fig-
ure 5 then the Penman-style architecture
represents a computational instantiation only
for the lower two strata and the relationship
between them
While at a rather general level very simi-
lar to the breakdown proposed by Bierwisch
the systemic-functional account also goes into
more detail about the internal organization of
each stratum It is this feature which is largely
responsible both for the more abstract status
that has been achieved for the sorts of the Up-
per Model and for the early adoption of the
principle of motivating sources on the basis
of the grammar Not only is all grammati-
cal variation captured by abstract choices be-
tween minimal grammatical alternatives but
also all such abstract choices must have ex-
plicit motivations or semantic conditions de-
ned Only then is the grammar fully dened
as a resource for grammatical expression we
have to know what each grammatical possi-
bility is an expression of This has naturally
given rise to the notion of covering the gram-
mar in terms of a set of motivations for each
choice that the grammar oers This is de-
picted graphically in Figure 6 The categories
necessary for this motivational covering are
then organized into sorts in a subsumption
lattice  thus dening the Upper Model
It is worth noting that this provides a
very strong methodology for interface ontol-
ogy construction Until a grammar alterna-
tion is explicitly connected into a motivational
relationship the alternation is considered to
be only formally in the sense of linguistic
form dened The grammar in fact acts as
a highly structured list of phenomena that
require semantic motivation In addition the
functional organization of the grammar itself
goes a long way towards providing a useful
pre-classication of syntactic phenomena so
as to be amenable to systematic semantic in-
terpretation The extra boost in abstraction

Figure 6 Covering the grammar semantically
that the grammar oers is responsible for the
increased level of abstraction that the Upper
Model has already achieved
I have noted however that the Upper
Model does not instantiate the full organi-
zation required by the theory Some of the
consequences of this have already been men-
tioned For example the upwards relations
of the Upper Model to context has not been
modelled within Penman in terms of a real-
ization relationship domain models are di-
rectly subordinated to the Upper Model hi-
erarchy I will return to this and some other
problems below
Importantly since the full
input of the theory has not yet been taken
into account we have available a number of
possible directions for development that may
provide a far more sophisticated implementa-
tion of both interface and conceptual ontolo-
43 A comparative evaluation
In this section I will apply the possible lin-
guistic theoretical underpinnings that could
be provided for the dierent ontology types in
order to consider those ontology types more
critically
I will suggest here that there are
clear reasons for dispreferring accounts that
adopt a mixed ontology approach Subse-
quently
in the next section I will discuss
possible future developments for interface and
conceptual ontologies drawing further on the
connections to theory established
We have seen that the type of account based
on a style of argumentation such as that of
Jackendo manages to gain abstractness while
still maintaining contact with details of lin-
guistic realization I have noted that the in-
crease in abstraction is a generally necessary
property for improving the functionality of
nlp systems One of the principle dierences
between such an account and the linguistic
theories supportive of interface ontologies was
in the degree and explicitness of stratica-
tion One can ask the question therefore
is there any evidence for the more stratied
view of the linguistic system If it proves nec-
essary or benecial to dierentiate between
information that is particularly linguistic and
the kind of information sought in accounts of
real-world commonsense knowledge then a
mixed ontology will not be sensitive to this A
very important issue to address is therefore
whether the selection between a mixed ontol-
ogy and a more dierientiated set of interre-
lated ontologies is one which is still open to de-
bate or arbitrary  or are there grounds for
deciding for one architecture over the other
431 Populating a mixed ontology
If we assume that we have an account such
as that proposed by Jackendo possibly aug-
mented by a range of concepts from cognitive
linguistics with a more formally expressed re-
lationship to the lexicogrammar it is still the
case that there the resulting ontology is not
yet very large The number of general sorts
that occur in for example
Jackendo 1990
ie not the conceptual equivalents of lexical
items which seem to be introduced freely
is less than 40 these include predicates such
as event state be orient path go
with from to towards inchoative re-
act affect etc Most conceptual items are
decomposed into these primitives
not discuss whether or not these items are
good candidates psychologically for concep-
tual primitives but relying on this small set of
categories is unlikely to capture many general-
izations of linguistic expression when a broad
lexicogrammar is considered If we include ex-
perience such as that obtained within the de-
velopment of the lilog ontology or the Upper
Model many intermediate sorts will express
useful generalizations over distinct linguistic
patterns Relying on a smaller than neces-
sary set of categories either misses general-
izations or places more work on the mapping
with lexicogrammatical form The method-
ological question arises of how the sort hier-
archy is to be extended beyond the very gen-
eral categories that most attempts at ontol-
ogy construction assume as basic on intuitive
grounds
The primary source of evidence for exten-
sion is the classication of lexicogrammati-
cal patterns This posits semantic features
that co-occur with particular classes of Lex-
ical Conceptual Structures But these classes
are constructed on the purely syntactic lin-
guistic behaviour of the investigated lexemes
This while being the best methodology avail-
able and one I have defended throughout this
paper cannot itself be expected to give rise
to conceptual classes Only the assumption
that such semantic patterns are simultane-
ously conceptual makes this plausible there
is no obvious connection to be drawn between
aspects of domain and commonsense knowl-
edge and lexically derived categories The
latter are often subject to criticism for be-
ing too shallow even for an interface ontol-
they must appear very unlikely can-
didates for a conceptual ontology As we
have found with the problems with the Upper
Model Section 331 there is no guarantee
that particular domain-motivated categories
will choose lexically-motivated categories that
belong to a consistent more general ontologi-
cal type More often items belonging to very
dierent lexical classes are treated as seman-
tically equivalent for speakers expressive pur-
poses Representing this in a single ontology
then requires that concepts may be consis-
tently classied along the two dimensions si-
multaneously which complicates the formal
properties of the resulting ontology consid-
erably since exactly what may be inherited
where becomes unclear
This is shown concretely in the linguisti-
cally motivated evaluation that Lang 1991
undertakes for lilog There he examines the
sorts proposed for the ontology according to
the kinds of motivations accepted for their in-
clusion He nds the following dierentially
motivated sorts all combined in the single sub-
sumption lattice
 Conceptually based sorts which are in-
cluded on extra-linguistic conceptual
grounds
 Text base specic sorts which are con-
cepts corresponding to special vocabulary
items required by the particular domain
and text with which lilog as a project
was concerned
 Sorts projected from the grammar
which are notions found in the grammar
such as preposition transferred to the on-
tology
 Sorts of mixed origin which are concepts
where both extra-linguistic and linguistic
criteria are involved
This mixing of motivations organizes itself
loosely according to the vertical and horizon-
tal dimensions in the hierarchy Thus
The vertical structure of the sort hier-
archy which is based on the subsump-
tion relation draws mainly on the avail-
ability of corresponding linguistic la-
bels categorized as nouns    or as verbs
   However the horizontal dimension
of the sort hierarchy that is the selec-
tion of subsorts to be assigned to a com-
mon supersort is mainly determined by
features that emerge from our extra-
linguistic conceptual knowledge of ob-
jects and spatio-temporally speciable
events or situations    
Lang 1991
p4667
Lang shows the following problems for the
resulting organization in a single subsump-
tion lattice that this inconsistency or variety
of motivations for concepts in the hierarchy
creates First since extra-linguistic or con-
ceptual criteria are less than well understood
there is a degree of arbitrariness in the catego-
rizations that appear Second it is never clear
from the concepts that are found in the hier-
archy alone whether they are to be expected
to have a corresponding linguistic eect or
not Third the co-existence of distinct kinds
of concepts means that the precise meaning of
subsumption with respect to particular cases
is underspecied  dierent kinds of concepts
have dierent relations between their wholes
and their parts and until this is claried it
is unclear what kind of subsumption actually
holds These dierences entail dierent formal
properties so that dierent objects can call for
dierent inheritance properties Thus for ex-
ample a supposedly general part-whole re-
lation is intended sometimes as is a compo-
nent of sometimes as is spatially included
in somtimes as pertains to sometimes as
inalienable possession sometimes as alien-
able possession etc This range of possibil-
ities makes the inferences that in fact follow
from any statement in the ontology far more
dicult to foresee and substantially compli-
cates in any case any axioms for inference that
are designed
This can also be seen concretely in many
versions of semantics where a mixed on-
tology is relied upon  in order to han-
dle the very exibility of the relationship
between the concepts
that are to func-
tion for the linguistic expression and those
which are not complex and often uncon-
strained mechanisms are introduced
type
projective inheritance of Pustejovsky 1991
and many instances of
coercion
as used by
Sag and Pollard 1991
Pustejovsky 1991 are probably prime exam-
ples of this but there are many others A
mixed ontology is therefore a very weakly
constraining theoretical construct which does
not provide optimal assistance either for the-
ory construction or for system construction
432 Stratication
The just mentioned exibility of relationship
between conceptual categories and the cate-
gories that are determinative of their linguis-
tic realization is a very typical property of a
relationship between linguistic strata
this very exibility in fact which provides the
primary linguistic evidence for stratication
As an example of this consider the following
issue of ontological design
Regardless of whether a mixed ontology is
adopted or not some portion of some on-
tology is assumed which oers an expression
of the chunking that language expects and
demands of knowledge if it going to be ex-
pressible through the grammatical and lexi-
cal resources of the linguistic system One
question that can be asked therefore is
the information in a conceptual ontology that
will support this chunking already organized
in this way or not
If it is then it will
be straightforward to construct a mechanism
such as that suggested by Jackendo above
whereby one simply takes a view on some
conceptual structure and already has a spec-
ication of the semantic predicate-argument
structure which can in turn control the gram-
mar and lexis to produce appropriate results
If not however then some reorganization of
the structure will be necessary
In all ex-
amples that are presented of alleged concep-
tual structures that are already appropriate
for direct lexicogrammatical realization eg
by viewing as predicate-argument structure
we can make the following observations
First the lexical items and class of gram-
matical patterns appropriate is already so
highly constrained as to follow directly from
the expression for example
State orient Thing weathervane Path
north
ervane pointed north Jackendo 1990 p74
Certain variability in lexicogrammatical ex-
pression will be produced by the mapping
rules of syntax formation but other decisions
including the choice of word for the concept
weathervane given that the hearer might not
know what a weathervane is or that the sen-
tence may be uttered among world-experts
on the subject of weathervanes who would
normally select a far more restrictive descrip-
tion etc have already been built into the de-
scription Widely diering selections of pos-
sible expression according to text type reg-
formality situation time availability
cf Hovy 1988 Bateman and Paris 1 are
excluded
Second the granularity of the correspond-
ing language has also been built into the de-
scription For example we know that a sen-
tence is going to be produced or if the linking
rules are good enough a sentence or a nom-
inalization rather than a short discussion of
the winds eect on an object whose position
of equilibrium under the pressure of the wind
serves as an indication of the winds direction
A nice example22 of maximal exibility here
might be the dierence for example in the
language produced in response to the concep-
tual real-world category beer for the purposes
of a dictionary entry eg
Beer is a bitter alcoholic drink made
from grain There are a lot of dierent
kinds of beer
Collins cobuild En-
glish Language Dictionary 1987
and that produced for the purpose for an entry
in an industrial chemical encyclopedia which
goes on for 40 pages
The response to both of these problems
within the semantico-conceptual approach is
straightforward the dierences are expressed
beforehand in the semantico-conceptual orga-
nization and are produced by conceptual pro-
cesses for information organization and man-
agement But this misses the generalization
that regardless of the information to be ex-
pressed that same linguistic granularity is im-
posed there will be a set of descriptions of
some predicate with an argument structure
including specications of participants and
circumstances The two sentences concerning
beer in the dictionary and the hundreds in the
as one reading for the sentence The weath-
22Due to Karin Haenelt
encyclopedia all exhibit the same kind of orga-
nization Knowledge is variable scale but lan-
guage is predominantly xed-grain23 as de-
ned by the grammar This means that for
all the knowledge available in the semantico-
conceptual ontology there need to be con-
struction mechanisms available which convert
some selected fragment of the information of
any scale and produce an appropriate sized
chunk of semantico-conceptual structure for
motivating a sentence
With unconstrained inferencing across the
knowledge base
this may be achievable
by inheriting constraints back from the
grammar and checking the equivalence of
constructed semantico-conceptual structures
with the originally selected fragment But
crucially for all such selected fragments the
same class of
semantico-conceptual para-
phrases will be potentially available
those licensed by their grammatical express-
ability Furthermore also regardless of the
originally selected semantico-conceptual frag-
ment the lexico-grammatically licensed set
of semantico-conceptual specications gov-
ern speciable sets of inferences that oper-
ate only on such specications
for exam-
ple the inferences that determine the tex-
tual variations that are appropriate when
realizing the specication lexicogrammati-
cally Bateman and Matthiessen to appear
that certain abstract semantic classications
apply for which there is no conceptual ev-
idence Schriefers 1990 and others Thus
not representing this distinguished set sepa-
rately fails to capture a signicant generaliza-
tion about the organization of the linguistic
system as a whole24
23Apart from the resources for combining clauses
into complexes which are not
nominal groups etc
relevant to the current argument
24It is also engenders dubious nlp system design
factoring out the commonalities in a separate stratum
is analogous to the following application of object-
oriented programming
In an object-oriented application    the
system uses predened mappings from ob-
jects to the routines that know how to pro-
cess those objects or can choose among dif-
ferent routines depending on the context
The eciency of using predened mappings
for known types comes in drastically reduc-
ing or entirely eliminating search the onus
is put on the developer to dene the de-
cisions available to a type at each level
rather than presenting all options at all
times and letting a search procedure nd
Finally it is worth emphasizing that this
exibility between strata is typical and not
unique to the relation between semantics and
conceptual levels of representation The re-
lationship between for example the Upper
Model and the lexicogrammar already ex-
hibits much of the same kind of exibility For
example the expressive resources of the gram-
mar of nominal groups is not restricted to the
single grain-size of sorts that are subtypes of
an Upper Model sort object It is equally pos-
sible to realize Upper Model classied events
as nominal groups or congurations of events
as single clauses if the textual conditions are
appropriate
Bateman and Paris 1 present
other examples of this theoretical exibility
for other categories in the grammar It is not
at all surprising given the theoretical similar-
ity therefore to nd exactly this kind of ex-
ibility again between the sort lattice of the
semantic ontology and that of the conceptual
ontology
This discussion of stratication is summa-
rized in Figure 7 Here we see three strata and
the repeated variability in expression that any
selected semantic specication has Crucially
the common reoccuring coding possibilities
that are available for all elements from the
conceptual stratum are not repeated at that
level but are factored into a single statement
at the level of the semantic interface with a
mapping from sorts at the conceptual stra-
tum to sorts at the interface stratum Not
representing this generalization both guaran-
tees a complication of the theory and makes
a usable nlp system based on the theory un-
likely Again the power of the theory to bring
methodological and contentful constraints to
bear on system design is compromised
5 Some Principles
Methods and some for-
mer puzzles resolved
The discussion up to this point has attacked
mixed ontologies on the basis that they are
internally inconsistent and has criticised the
non-staticational linguistic accounts under-
lying such mixed ontologies on the basis that

Figure 7 Capturing generalizations via stratication
they fail to capture theoretically important
and practically useful generalizations Both
weaknesses have one consequence in common
they provide a seriously reduced set of con-
straints for ontology design and construction
Since one purpose of this paper is to sug-
gest principles and methodologies for ontol-
ogy construction mixed ontologies and under-
stratied linguistic accounts are clearly to be
avoided The kinds of ontologies most appro-
priate for nlp systems and for which linguis-
tic support needs to be sought can now be
restricted to the following two types
 Type Oi an abstract semantic organiza-
tion underlying our use of grammar and
lexis that is motivated on essentially lin-
guistic grounds and that acts as a com-
plex interface between lexicogrammatical
resources and higher-level strata in the
linguistic system  the categories of this
interface should be maximally general
ie apply across distinct real-world situ-
ations but specic enough to maximally
constrain possible lexicogrammatical ex-
pression
 Type Oc an abstract organization of
real-world knowledge commonsense or
otherwise that relates downwards to the
interface to lexicogrammar
With these restrictions in place I will now
go further and suggest some particular guide-
lines for ontology construction
In order to
do this however it is also necessary to make
some further commitments to the kinds of in-
formation that will be made available at par-
ticular levels in the linguistic system The rea-
son for this is that the linguistic and particu-
larly lexico-grammatical constructs are essen-
tial for guiding ontology design This follows
the increasingly wide range of linguistic the-
ories that are returning to the position that
the relation between grammar and semantics
is not arbitrary we saw a selection of these
in Section 4 above eg
Langacker 1987
Wierzbicka 1988
Talmy 1987
Jackendo 1983 Halliday 1978
If we ac-
cept this then it is also to be accepted that
the selection of particular accounts of lexi-
cogrammar has consequences for the subse-
quent ontology design
Since such conse-
quences cannot be avoided it makes sense to
make selection decisions in ways which will
maximally help in the task of ontology con-
struction overall
I will distinguish between
decisions in the following two areas
domains25
 type of grammar
 contents of grammar
and will make some rm suggestions for the
former and discuss the consequences of dier-
ences that arise in the latter
First we can note that the most successful
interface ontology developed so far is prob-
ably that of the Upper Model The Upper
Model has achieved both a detailed account
and a generally applicable account We can
ask then what is it about its underlying the-
oretical organization that let this occur Sec-
ond we can further note that although the
Upper Model is the most detailed instantia-
tion of an ontology of type Oi that has been
developed is nevertheless not a full instan-
tiation of the theory on which it is based
It is therefore worthwhile considering briey
what additional constraints the theory could
bring to bear if it were to be more fully im-
plemented
is easily classied
The kind of grammar on which the ab-
stractions proposed in the Penman Up-
per Model
paradigmatic-functional grammar exhibiting
the standard Hallidayan metafunctional diver-
sication Halliday 1985 Matthiessen 1990
Matthiessen and Bateman 1991
This means that it is organized rstly around
choice  the paradigms of grammatical con-
structions that stand in functional opposition
 and second around a factorization of that
choice according to its semantic motivation
is the choice to do with the propositional con-
tent of the linguistic entity to be classied
ideational is the choice to do with the tex-
tual placing of the linguistic entity to be clas-
sied textual or is the choice to be classied
as to do with the interpersonal relationship
between speaker and hearer or with the atti-
tude of the speaker towards the information
expressed by the linguistic entity interper-
sonal The motivations for the choices pro-
vides hypotheses concerning the sorts neces-
sary for controlling those choices The Up-
per Model has been derived by considering
motivations for those choices exclusively as-
signed to the ideational metafunction there is
no mixing of categories across metafunctional
This builds into the design of an ontology
motivated in such a way as the Upper Model
the following features
First we require an ontology that is sig-
nicantly more abstract than syntactic real-
ization classes I have already suggested how
this has been achieved with the Upper Model
The grammar being organized in terms of a
functional classication of possible constraints
on constituency structure
is already more
abstract than constituency structure per se
Further classication across the paradigms
uncovered is then automatically more abstract
and achieves a generalization across particu-
lar lexico-grammatical contexts that supports
a greater exibility of expression of input
expressions The strict relationship to the
grammatical stratum also makes sure that the
kinds of mixed sorts that Lang 1991 nds
and criticises in the lilog hierarchy cannot
occur either an interface ie semantic on-
tological category has a specied consequence
for lexico-grammatical expression or it is not
accepted
Second given the stratication suggested
by the theory the Upper Model is automat-
ically only the next level up in the linguistic
system
it is an ontology strongly connected
to grammar below It does not by itself pro-
vide the necessary organization of higher level
ontologies Thus in short we see that an or-
ganization closely reminiscent of a two-level
semantics is automatically achieved and that
both levels require ontologies
Third we have seen that it is a design
goal that an ontology be as general as pos-
sible  that it helps with classication across
domains tasks and applications but also
be substantial enough to provide a rich scaf-
folding for domain description This raises
the question How can we guarantee that
a proposed ontology is as general as we re-
quire We can now see that ontologies such
as the Upper Model which are based on
motivations from grammar are guaranteed
to have the domain-independence required
25Although it is perfectly possible to imagine ap-
plying the same grammar-as-lter methodology on
underlying motivational ontologies as carried out for
the ideational metafunction  cf Bateman 1991 for
examples of this applied to the textual metafunction
and Matthiessen and Bateman 1991 for general dis-
cussion  the resulting organizations of information
have very dierent properties
of them
Since ontological categories are
motivated by the grammatical distinctions
and not by more arbitrary lexical collec-
tions found in a given domain those cate-
gories are forced to be at least as general as
the grammatical categories
It is therefore
very unlikely that Klose and von Luck 1991
p462s claim that the lilog ontology has a
more domain-independent status than the
early version of the Upper Model described
in Mann et al 1985 would apply to current
versions of the Upper Model
But we can go further and move beyond
the kind of generalizeability that refers sim-
ply to domain-independence  which is gen-
eralizeability upwards in the linguistic sys-
tem and beyond generalizeablity across the
lexicogrammar  which is generalizeability
downwards in the linguistic system When
we also consider the metafunctional organi-
zation of the linguistic system posited by
systemic-functional theory then we can see
that generalizations both across text in-
stances and across speech functions are also
guaranteed  ie generalizations horizon-
tally across the same stratum of the linguistic
system This is depicted graphically in Fig-
ure 8 These constraints rule out certain other
potential sorts from the ontology eg sorts
concerned with the particular appearance of
an entity at a given position in a text or with
the speakers attitude towards an event Cer-
tain of the sorts found in Meteer 1989s in-
terface ontology are good examples of the for-
mer kind Having such sorts requires reclas-
sication of domain information whenever a
domain object is used in a text since the tex-
tual statuses of domain objects changes over
the development of a text  ie from new to
given from theme to rheme etc This change
of course needs to be represented the point
is that representing such information in the
interface ontology again mixes very dierent
kinds of information  although this time on
a horizontal dimension across the linguistic
system rather than a vertical one
The kind of grammar that we employed as
the initial motivation for guiding the develop-
ment of the Upper Model has therefore gone
a long way towards ensuring that the prop-
erties desired of ontologies obtain But an
area of exibility in the description then arises
from the depth of grammatical description
ie the contents rather than the type Par-
ticularly within the systemic-functional ap-
proach lexical descriptions are seen as more
specic versions of grammatical descriptions
 there is no dierence in kind Thus if we
push lexicogrammatical description further in
the direction of lexis we automatically push
further the depth of motivating semantic on-
tology constructs that are needed This bi-
furcation in potential description needs more
theoretical work before we can make any rm
statements about whether it is more helpful
to pursue one at the expense of the other or
whether they should be pursued in parallel as
has been the case with the more general area
of the grammar
We can now also consider some possible im-
provements and explanations for some awk-
ward phenomenaintuitions that have previ-
ously hindered ontological engineering For
example if there is a stratication of the kind
argued for why is it that suggestions for con-
ceptual structure that have been put forward
in a number of approaches appear also to be
candidates for representation as sorts in the
interface ontology  When the categories of
the Upper Model for example are examined
many similar classes to the proposed concep-
tual ontology work are to be found
example of
To give a concrete
Lang 1991 p474 after careful discussion
concerning the problems of a mixed ontol-
ogy denes some basic assumptions con-
cerning the structure of the conceptual on-
tology drawn from earlier work
includ-
ing Bierwisch and Lang 1989 With respect
to these assumptions he outlines the following
set of conceptual domains which are to form
basic subsorts of the conceptual ontology
D1 objects
D4 time intervals D5 events
D2 substances D3 locations
D6 attitudes
We can also note here similarities with some
of the classes above from Jackendo 1983
Jackendo 1990
Langacker 1987
Talmy 1987 etc But these are also sorts
already found for example in the Penman
Upper Model where they have been entered
purely on the grounds that they are necessary
to directly constrain possible grammatical re-
alizations Is it the case that the claim we saw
above by Gust 1991 p133 that
there are
continuous variations between semantic forms
and conceptual structures is after all true
Can we introduce strict stratication and still

Figure 8 Capturing generalizations via metafunctionality
account for the intuition that these concepts
indeed function at dierent strata
Lang already suggests that there may be
certain genuinely linguistic
features that
function denitionally for features at the con-
ceptual stratum
   the representation of nouns like
Ofen oven Fahrzeug vehicle Boot
in the lexicon contains a spe-
cic component purpose hence an el-
ement of our linguistic knowledge by
means of which the sort Nutzgegenstand
article for practical use in the knowl-
edge base is being accessed This is but
one example of how linguistic aspects
of lexical representation can be made
use of in dening ontological sorts in the
knowledge base Lang 1991 p470
Other genuine linguistic features that Lang
suggests for the basis of the ontological dis-
tinctions include bounded object vs
non-
bounded object concrete object vs
stract object  both very similar to other
theoretical accounts We can now go further
and explain the relation between the linguistic
semantic ontology types and the conceptual
ontology types as follows
All of the reasoning that we have applied
to the development of the Upper Model ontol-
ogy with respect to its motivation in the lexi-
cogrammar can be applied precisely to the re-
lation between the Upper Model ontology and
some higher stratum ontology This follows as
a consequence from the theoretical statement
of the nature of realization within the strat-
ied linguistic account This means that we
will need to nd motivations for the seman-
tic interface ontology sorts
It also means
however that we can make use of the realiza-
tion relation starting from the standpoint of
the higher stratum and interpret the status of
the semantic interface ontology as generalizing
across dierent conceptual stratum situations
cf Figure 5 Thus for both the lexicogram-
mar with respect to the semantic interface on-
tology and for the semantic interface ontology
with respect to the conceptual ontology it is
likely that the more general intra-stratal or-
ganization of the lower stratum is likely to be
echoed in the overall intra-organization of the
higher stratum This gives us the observed
link between constructs that are motivateable
as general semantic concepts and constructs
that appear to organize the conceptual hier-
archy There is then no mixing of the cat-
egories of dierent strata there is just a res-
onance or echo of categories at one stratum
taken up at another
strata
the contents of
Given both this theoretical and practi-
the dif-
cal binding of
then a certain tension between strata 
Klose and von Luck 1991 p462 note
from their experience with the lilog ontol-
it clear why there
The tension between linguistic and in-
ferential demands on the modeling is
alive and forces compromises on both
sides
I have suggested that the kind of view of re-
alization between strata found in systemic-
functional linguistics where there is both a
practical and a theoretical pulling in both
directions  upwards to context and down-
wards to experiential lexicogrammar of-
fers an appropriate way of operating within
this tension between strata The resulting
methodology then uses the tension to help
constrain organization decisions for the con-
struction of interface ontologies that are use-
ful for nlp and to remove the need for genuine
compromises where an inappropriate cate-
gory is postulated at one level because that
is insuciently functionally dierenti-
ated from others
It is clear however that we know a great
deal more about possibilities for ontologies of
type Oi than we do about ontologies of type
Oc Moreover given the results of the last
section perhaps we know even less than we
thought  clearly conceptual categories are
now sometimes best reappropriated to a more
abstract semantic type This is a less than
ideal situation  particularly given the view
of stratication shown in Figure 5 and the es-
tablished dialectic between strata Because
the realization relationship between strata is
bi-directional we should be able to use a
higher-strata to constrain our accounts at a
lower-strata But the fact that we know very
little about the higher-strata in this case re-
moves one source of possible constraint
Finally here however I will draw atten-
tion to one interesting consequence for the
status of the higher-stratum ontology when
we take into account the bi-directionality of
the inter-stratal relationship Since there is
no dierence assumed in the theoretical sta-
tus of the levels related by the interstratal re-
lationship one might ask how it is that the
interface ontology is termed linguistic and
semantic whereas the higher-stratum ontol-
ogy is non-linguistic and conceptual I be-
lieve that a far more appropriate view of the
relationship is as depicted graphically in Fig-
ure 9 All strata that stand in an interstratal
relationship of the kind explored and used in
this paper should be seen as semiotic levels
of greater and lesser degrees of abstraction
The conceptual ontology thus becomes more
of a contextual ontology with context being
interpreted in the sense of a level of social
situation  closely in line with for exam-
ple Halliday 1978 There is then the ad-
ditional question of how this entire complex
of inter-related levels of semiotic descriptions
relates to the supporting conceptual system
of human psychology This is probably a very
dierent kind of relation than realization 
although it will probably again turn out to be
a dialectic relationship rather than a one-way
determination This puts us in the position
to criticise some of the conceptual sorts pro-
posed by Lang on exactly the same grounds
that he has criticised mixed ontologies For
example alongside the above mentioned do-
mains all of which may be more plausi-
bly ground in the conceptualperceptual sys-
tem Lang 1991 p474 places
social insti-
tutions law administration marriage edu-
cation and communicative behaviour eti-
quette conversation group dynamics Such
a mixed set of sorts is unlikely to form a very
stable or usable ontology it is probably cru-
cial to begin to rene further our levels of
ontology and their interactions so that the
mistakes made at the least abstract levels of
ontological engineering are not just repeated
again at the next level up More detailed
statements must however be left to future
research

Figure 9 The relationship between semiotic descriptions and conceptual representation
commonsense metaphysics and others  I
drew attention to the fact that such accounts
do not bring strong methodological and sub-
stantive constraints to bear on ontology con-
struction Also unclear is the relationship of
such ontologies to language The gap is of-
ten so large that this level is too abstract
to have any direct relationship to required
forms of expression Contrariwise this gap
also leads to a weakening of the discriminative
power of the constraints that can be brought
to bear by linguistic patternings Concretely
then one cannot for example generate nat-
ural language directly from such levels of de-
scription without resolving or xing an im-
mense number of degrees of freedom that re-
main unaddressed often quite rightly if this
is seen as a conceptual ontology in the on-
tology itself Much of the work that an nlp
system requires to be done is therefore sim-
ply not taken into consideration by the ab-
stract ontology Such ontologies are also be-
cause of their abstractness dicult to popu-
late reliably  if sizeable and potentially dis-
tributed resource construction is undertaken
as it increasingly is then this virtually guar-
antees poor intercoder consistency In short
such ontologies are of very limited value for
nlp work
These problems have been noted by some
of those who have sought principles for on-
tology design cf Skuce and Monarch 1990
and those who need real shareable resources
as for example in machine translation 
cf Steiner and Reuther 1989 The only so-
lution that has been found to this endeavor is
to place more reliance on language as a source
of constraint For this reason then views on
language and the organization of the linguis-
tic system become crucial for ontology design
that is appropriate for nlp Moreover only by
taking views on the linguistic system that are
maximally supportive of the functionalities re-
quired of ontologies can we avoid problems of
lack of abstractness ie being dominated by
linguistic form and problems of too much ab-
stractness ie being dominated by semantic
theories of particular areas that lack connec-
tion to linguistic form In short ontological
engineering faces the following dilemma
terface ontologies
 need to be abstract large-scale re-usable
information classication devices
 but they cannot be too abstract
 or too near syntax
 and need to be constrained from lan-
The theoretical assumptions and resulting or-
ganizational decisions that I have pursued in
this paper appear to oer a very practical way
of preceding within this state of aairs I have
also shown that several other benecial prop-
erties for nlp systems are derivable from the
abstract organization of the linguistic system
that systemic-functional theory posits
The paper has presented for broader debate
a round of discussion that begun in the con-
text of the developing ontology of the Penman
text generation system This work begin-
ning with the pre-computational descriptive
account called the Bloomington Lattice by
Halliday and Matthiessen has passed through
several instantiations in computational form
Now future work will have again consider
bringing together the linguistic descriptive
account  reworked to a new level of de-
tail in Halliday and Matthiessen to appear
 and the computational model It is to be
hoped that this approach will build on the for-
mer success of the Upper Model simultane-
ously moving us in some of the directions that
I raised as responses to problems with the Up-
per Model Thus I have not suggested that
the Upper Model we nd in Penman is the
general solution to ontological engineering 
there are many more criticisms to be made of
this ontology again mostly concerning the ex-
tent to which it succeeds as an instantiation of
the theoretical principles that underlie it The
function of the ontology is also more nely cir-
cumscribed than many others  but again
strictly according to the underlying theory
We are not yet at a stage where an ontology
can be accepted even pragmatically for the
needs of current nlp systems as complete
what is more at issue is the development of ap-
propriate methodologies for constructing on-
tologies and here again constraints oered by
the linguistic system are of paramount impor-
tance The linguistic system when viewed
appropriately gives a rich multidimensional
set of constraints on adequate and appropriate
designs for computational systems The prin-
ciple dimensions applied in this paper were
those of strata and metafunctions This by no
means exhausts the possible input of the the-
ory however For further dimensions of the
theory see Matthiessen and Bateman 1991
for additional examples of using these dimen-
sions to constrain computational system de-
sign see Bateman et al 1992 I hope that
the paper has suggested some of the benets
of employing such linguistic motivations and
that further attempts to apply wider sets of
motivations will help us in the future
