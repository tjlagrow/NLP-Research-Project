ABSTRACT
ContextTo understand the formation and evolution of galaxies it is important to have a full comprehension of the role played by the
metallicity star formation rate SFR morphology and color The interplay of these parameters at dierent redshifts will substantially
aect the evolution of galaxies and as a consequence the evolution of them will provide important clues and constraints on the galaxy
evolution models In this work we focus on the evolution of the SFR metallicity of the gas and morphology of galaxies at low redshift
in search of signs of evolution
AimsTo analyze the S2N2 logHS ii vs logHN ii diagram as a possible segregator of starforming composite and AGN
galaxies to study the evolution of the Baldwin Phillips  Terlevich 1981 diagrams as well as the evolution of the SFR metallicity
and morphology through the massmetallicity luminositymetallicity SFRstellar mass and SFRmetallicity relationships of star
forming galaxies from SDSSDR5 Sloan Digital Sky SurveyData Release 5 using redshift intervals in bins of 01 from 0 to 04
Methods We used data processed with the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code correcting the uxes for dust extinction and esti-
mating metallicities using the R23 method We use the S2N2 diagnostic diagram as a tool to classify starforming composite and
AGN galaxies We analyzed the evolution of the three principal BPT diagrams estimating the SFR and specic SFR SSFR for our
samples of galaxies studying the luminosity and mass-metallicity relations and analyzing the morphology of our sample of galaxies
through the g  r color concentration index and SSFR
Results We found that the S2N2 is a reliable diagram to classify starforming composite and AGNs galaxies We demonstrate that
the three principal BPT diagrams show an evolution toward higher values of O iii 5007H due to a metallicity decrement We
found an evolution in the massmetallicity relation of  02 dex for the redshift range 03  z  04 compared to our local one
From the analysis of the evolution of the SFR and SSFR as a function of the stellar mass and metallicity we discovered a group of
galaxies with higher SFR and SSFR at all redshift samples whose morphology is consistent with those of latetype galaxies Finally
the comparison of our local 004  z  01 with our higher redshift sample 03  z  04 show that the metallicity the SFR and
morphology evolve toward lower values of metallicity higher SFRs and latetype morphologies for the redshift range 03  z  04

1 Introduction
Baldwin Phillips  Terlevich 1981 hereafter BPT were the
rst to propose diagnostic diagrams to classify galaxies into
starburst or active galactic nucleus AGN based on the dom-
inant energy source in emission-line galaxies since AGNs have
a much harder ionizing spectrum than hot stars Revised and re-
ned by Veilleux  Osterbrock 1987 the three BPT empirical
diagnostic diagrams use the optical line ratios O i 6300H
S ii 6717 6731H N ii 6583H and O iii 5007H
hereafter N ii will refer to N ii 6583 and S ii to S ii
6717 6731 The BPT diagrams are the most widely used
method to segregate between star-forming galaxies and AGNs
since the lines in starforming SF galaxies are emitted by H ii
regions which are ionized by massive stars while AGNs are
ionized by a harder radiation eld
Kewley et al 2001 hereafter Kew01 used a combination of
stellar population synthesis models and detailed self-consistent
photoionization models to create a theoretical maximum star-
burst line on the three BPT diagrams Kaumann et al 2003a
hereafter Kauf03 shifted this starburst limit to a lower and
more precise one in the N iiH diagram excluding Seyfert
H ii composite objects whose spectra contain signicant contri-
butions from both AGN and star formation from pure SF galax-
ies Galaxies between the Kauf03 and Kew01 divisions are con-
sidered as composite galaxies
There are more division criteria between SF galaxies and
AGNs in the N iiH vs O iii 5007H BPT diagram such
as the one of Stasinska et al 2006 which used a limit lower
than that of Kauf03 based on a more rigurous criterion and
the one of Lee et al 2007 which used an intermediate em-
pirical line between the Kauf03 and Kew01 divisions It is pos-
sible however to classify SF galaxies and AGNs using only the
N iiH ratio as discussed in Stasinska et al 2006 since the
left arm of the N iiH diagram see for example Fig 2 is a
measure of the combination of the metallicity and the ioniza-
tion parameter Then larger values of this ratio indicate that the
galaxy host an AGN Stasinska et al 2006 classify as SF galax-

ies those with logN iiH  -04 composite galaxies those
with -04  logN iiH  -02 and AGNs those galaxies with
logN iiH  -02
Following with the objective of segregate SF from compos-
ite and AGNs galaxies in this work we study the S2N2 dia-
gram as a reliable segregator of galaxies This logHS ii vs
logHN ii diagram was introduced by Sabbadin et al 1977
as a useful tool to separate galactic planetary nebula PNe
H ii regions and supernova remnants SNRs This diagram was
later applied to Herbig-Haro objects Canto 1981 Galactic PNe
Garca-Lario et al 1991 Riesgo  Lopez 2005 and extra-
galactic PNe Magrini et al 2003 The S2N2 diagram has been
used also as a metallicity and ionization parameter indicator for
extragalactic H ii regions by Viironen et al 2007
The S2N2 diagram has been also applied to galaxies by some
authors For example Moustakas  Kennicutt 2006 studied
whether there was a dierence between integrated spectra of
galaxies and the spectra of individual H ii regions Dopita et al
2006 used the S2N2 diagram among others for abundance di-
agnostics using photoionization models Nevertheless the S ii
ux shows always deciences when generated by photoioniza-
tion models eg Levesque et al 2010 Also Lamareille et al
2009 and Perez-Montero et al 2009 used the S2N2 diagram
as a segregator of SF from Seyfert 2 galaxies but using dierent
ratios logN iiH vs logS iiH However in their divi-
sion Lamareille et al 2009 do not distinguish between SF and
composite galaxies also they used equivalent widths instead of
emission line uxes which could aect the results Kobulnicky
 Kewley 2004
The formation and evolution of galaxies at dierent cosmo-
logical epochs are driven mainly by two linked processes the
star formation history and the metal enrichment Thus from an
observational point of view the star formation rate SFR the
metallicity and the stellar mass of the galaxies at dierent epochs
will give us important clues on the evolution of galaxies The
rst quantitative SFRs were derived from evolutionary synthe-
sis models of galaxy colors Tinsley 1968 1972 Searle et al
1973 conrming the trends in SFRs and star formation histo-
ries along the Hubble sequence and giving the rst predictions
of the evolution of the SFR with cosmic lookback time The de-
velopment of more precise direct SFR diagnostics includes the
integrated emissionline uxes Cohen 1976 Kennicutt 1983
near-ultraviolet continuum uxes Donas  Deharveng 1984
and infrared continuum uxes Harper  Low 1973 Rieke 
Lebofsky 1978 Telesco  Harper 1980 see Kennicutt 1998
for a review The hydrogen Balmer line H is currently the most
reliable tracer of star formation since in H ii regions and star-
forming galaxies the Balmer emission-line luminosity scales
directly with the total ionizing ux of the embedded stars A
widely known calibration of the H line as SFR tracer is the
one devised by Kennicutt 1998 However it is important to
take into account corrections for stellar absorption and redden-
ing to obtain SFRs in agreement with the ones derived using
other wavelengths eg Rosa-Gonzalez et al 2002 Charlot et al
2002 Dopita et al 2002 In parallel other diagnostics have been
developed using the oxygen doublet O ii 3726 3729 for the
redshift range z  04  15 eg Gallagher et al 1989 Kennicutt
1998 Rosa-Gonzalez et al 2002 Kewley et al 2004 Moreover
this diagnostic is usefull when the H line is not easily observ-
able at higher redshifts z  04 in the optical However the
O ii doublet presents problems in reddening and abundance de-
pendence Jansen Franx  Fabricant 2001 Charlot et al 2002
Alternatively it is possible to estimate the SFR from the soft X-
ray luminosity which is comparable to that determined from the
H luminosity Rosa Gonzalez et al 2009 Rovilos et al 2009
A strong dependence of the SFR and the stellar mass and its
evolution with redshift has been found with the bulk of star for-
mation occurring rst in massive galaxies and later in less mas-
sive systems eg Guzman et al 1997 Brinchmann  Ellis 2000
Juneau et al 2005 Bauer et al 2005 Bell et al 2005 Perez-
Gonzalez et al 2005 Feulner et al 2005 Papovich et al 2006
Caputi et al 2006 Reddy et al 2006 Erb et al 2006 Noeske et
al 2007a Buat et al 2008 In the local universe several stud-
ies have illustrated a relationship between the SFR and stellar
mass identifying two populations galaxies on a star-forming se-
quence and quenched galaxies with little or no detectable star
formation Brinchmann et al 2004 Salim et al 2005 Lee 2006
At higher redshift Noeske et al 2007a showed the existence of
a main sequence MS for SF galaxies in the SFRstellar mass
relation over the redshift range 02  z  11 From the galaxies
considered in this study it was shown that the slope of the MS
remains constant to z  1 while the MS as a whole moves to
higher SFR as z increases
Metallicity is another important property of galaxies and its
study is crucial for a deep understanding of galaxy formation
and evolution since it is related to the whole past history of the
galaxy Metallicity is a tracer of the fraction of baryonic mass
already converted into stars and is sensitive to the metal losses
due to stellar winds supernovae and active nuclei feedbacks A
detailed description of the dierent metallicity methods and cal-
ibrations are given in Lara-Lopez et al 2009ab
Stellar mass and metallicity are strongly correlated in SF
galaxies with massive galaxies showing higher metallicities
than less massive galaxies This relationship provides crucial in-
sight into galaxy formation and evolution The mass-metallicity
M  Z relation was rst observed by Lequeux et al 1979 has
been intensively studied Skillman et al 1989 Brodie  Huchra
1991 Zaritsky et al 1994 Richer  McCall 1995 Garnett et
al 1997 Pilyugin  Ferrini 2000 among others and it is well
established by the work of Tremonti et al 2004 hereafter T04
for the local universe z  01 using SDSS data The study of
the redshift evolution of the M  Z relation has provided us with
crucial information on the cosmic evolution of star formation
Regarding the evolution of the M  Z relation for SF galax-
ies at z  1 Savaglio et al 2005 have investigated the mass
metallicity relations using galaxies at 04  z  1 nding that
metallicity is lower at higher redshift by  015 dex Moreover
Maier at al 2005 Hammer et al 2005 and Liang et al 2006
found that emission line galaxies were poorer in metals at z 
07 than presentday spirals A study of Lamareille et al 2009
focused on the evolution of the M  Z relation up to z  09
suggesting that the M  Z relation is atter at higher redshifts
However Carollo  Lilly 2001 from emissionline ratios of
15 galaxies in a range of 05  z  1 found that their metallic-
ities appear to be remarkably similar to those of local galaxies
selected with the same criteria Also Lilly et al 2003 from a
sample of 66 SF galaxies with 047  z  092 claim a smaller
variation in metallicity of  008 dex compared with the metal-
licity observed locally showing only modest evolutionary eects
for more details about the M  Z relation see Lara-Lopez et al
2009b
In a recent study Calura et al 2009 have demonstrated the
importance on the morphology of galaxies when deriving the
M  Z relation since at any redshift elliptical galaxies present
the highest stellar masses and the highest metallicities whereas
the irregulars are the least massive galaxies characterised by the
lowest O abundances
MA Lara-Lopez et al Evolution from fundamental parameters in SDSS galaxies
We selected galaxies with an apparent Petrosian r magni-
tude of 145  r  1777 in the redshift samples z0 z1 and
z2 which yields 82884 44763 and 1802 galaxies respectively
corresponding to the magnitude completeness at these redshifts
see Fig 1 Galaxies of the z3 sample have a dierent complete-
ness range 169  r  188 as observed in Fig 1 giving 119
galaxies We used the z0 and z1 sample of galaxies with its re-
spective completeness but for galaxies of samples z2 and z3 we
used both those in the completeness range and those out of the
completeness range The reason for this is to improve the galaxy
statistics by increasing the number of them As we shown in the
next sections the main results are similar using galaxies in the
magnitude completeness and galaxies of the total sample
In this paper we consistently approach several topics start-
ing with the introduction of the S2N2 as a reliable diagram to
classify galaxies the analysis of the metallicity evolution of
galaxies in the three BPT diagrams and for a better understand-
ing of the processes involved in the observed evolution of galax-
ies at low redshift we studied the mass metallicity and SFR
relations such as the M Z metallicity-SFR and mass-SFR rela-
tions We also point out that the morphology of galaxies play an
important role when deriving conclusions since latetype galax-
ies will result in lower metallicity estimates and higher SFRs
than earlytype Calura et al 2009
This paper is structured as follows in Sect 2 we detail the
data used for this study the dust extinction correction and the
metallicity estimates for our sample of galaxies in Sect 3 we
introduce the S2N2 as a reliable diagram to segregate SF com-
posite and AGNs galaxies In Sect 4 we analyzed the evolu-
tion of the BPT diagrams In Sect 5 we investigate the evolu-
tion of the mass-metallicity and luminosity-metallicity relations
whereas in Sect 6 we discuss the relations between the SFR
and SSFR with stellar mass and metallicity as well as the mor-
phology of our galaxies using colors concentration index and
SSFRs Finally conclusions are given in Sect 7
2 Data processing and sample selection
We selected emission line galaxies from SDSSDR5 Adelman
McCarthy et al 2007 Data were taken with a 25 m telescope
located at Apache Point Observatory Gunn et al 2006 The
SDSS spectra were obtained using 3 arcsec diameter bres cov-
ering a wavelength range of 3800-9200  and with a mean
spectral resolution   1800 The SDSSDR5 spectroscopy
database contains spectra for  106 objects over  5700 deg2
Further technical details can be found in Stoughton et al 2002
We used the SDSSDR5 spectra from the STARLIGHT
database1 which were processed with the STARLIGHT spectral
synthesis code developed by Cid Fernandes and collaborators
Cid Fernandes et al 2005 2007 Mateus et al 2006 Asari et al
2007 From the spectra the STARLIGHT code subtracts the
continuum obtaining the emission lines uxes measurements
for each galaxy For each emission line the STARLIGHT code
returns the rest frame ux and its associated equivalent width
linewidth velocity displacement relative to the restframe wave-
length and the SN of the t In the case of Balmer lines the un-
derlying stellar absorption was corrected by the STARLIGHT
code using synthetic spectra obtained by tting an observed
spectrum with a combination of 150 simple stellar populations
SSPs from the evolutionary synthesis models of Bruzual 
Charlot 2003
From the full set of galaxies we only consider galaxies
whose spectra show in emission the H H N ii O ii 3727
O iii 4959 O iii 5007 O i 6300 S ii lines We selected
galaxies with a signaltonoise ratio higher than 3 for the H
H and N ii lines
In order to identify any evolution of galaxy parameters or
relations we divided our sample in four redshift intervals as
follow 004  z0  01 01  z1  02 02  z2  03
03  z3  04 The lower limit of z0 corresponds to an aper-
ture covering fraction of 20 which is the minimum required
to avoid domination of the spectrum by aperture eects Kewley
et al 2005 This classication give us 85931 galaxies for z0
48888 galaxies for z1 3278 galaxies for z2 and 199 galaxies for

21 SampleselectionforSection3
In Section 3 to study the S2N2 diagram as a segregator of dier-
ent types of galaxies we adopt the main galaxy sample eg
Strauss et al 2002 with Petrosian r magnitudes in the range
145  r  1777 and the redshift interval z0 taking into ac-
count all the emission lines and the signaltonoise ratio men-
tioned above which yields 82884 galaxies In this Section we
used AGN composite and SF galaxies
22 SampleselectionforSection4
In Section 4 we study the evolution of the three BPT diagrams
using the four redshift intervals magnitude intervals and the
signaltonoise restrictions mentioned above In this Section we
used AGN composite and SF galaxies Also to study the metal-
licity evolution of the SF galaxies of the BPT diagrams see Fig
6 we used the sample of Sections 5 and 6 mentioned below
MA Lara-Lopez et al Evolution from fundamental parameters in SDSS galaxies
23 SampleselectionforSections5and6
For Sections 5 and 6 we selected SF galaxies following the
criterion given by Kauf03 in the BPT empirical diagnostic di-
agram logO iii 5007H  061logN ii H-005  13
the same used by Veilleux  Osterbrock 1987 Kewley et al
2001 2006 and Stasinska et al 2006 among others After
all these selections the number of galaxies of each redshift bin
is reduced to 61921 SF galaxies for z0 27853 for z1 1671 for z2
and 67 H ii galaxies for z3
The extinction correction and metallicity estimates were cal-
culated as in Lara-Lopez et al 2009b Our extinction correc-
tion was derived using the Balmer decrements in order to ob-
tain the reddening coecient CH We used the Cardelli et al
1989 law with Rv  AvEB  V31 assuming case B recom-
bination with a density of 100 cm3 and a temperature of 104 K
with HH  286 Osterbrock 1989
We estimated metallicities using the R23 relation intro-
duced by Pagel et al 1979 R23O ii 3727O iii 4959
5007H and adopted the calibration given by Tremonti et al
2004 12  logOH  9185  0313x  0264x2  0321x3
where x  log R23 We selected the upper branch of the double
valued R23 in which the Tremonti et al 2004 calibration is
valid taking 12logOH  84 and logN iiO ii3727  
12 since the upper and lower branches of the R23 calibration
bifurcates at those values see Kewley  Ellison 2008
Applying this nal criterion we end with 58866 galaxies for
z0 24385 for z1 1631 for z2 from which 712 galaxies are in their
completeness magnitude interval and 62 galaxies for z3 from
which 41 galaxies are in their completeness magnitude interval
all of them in the upper branch of the R23 relation corresponding
to the 99  to the H ii classied galaxies Then we are not
introducing a bias selecting the upper branch for this samples
3 The S2N2 diagnostic diagram as a starforming
composite and AGN galaxies segregator
As mentioned in Section 1 BPT diagrams are the most used
method to segregate between star-forming and AGN galaxies
From the three BPT diagrams N iiH S iiH and O i
6300H vs O iii 5007H the most used is the N iiH vs
O iii 5007H one since it is the only one that can segregate
pure SF and composite galaxies as demonstrated by Kewley et
al 2006 and Perez-Montero et al 2009 The other two BPT
diagrams are not useful for segregating SF from composite ob-
Commonly known as the S2N2
the logHS ii vs
logHN ii diagram has been used to separate planetary neb-
ulae PNe H ii regions and supernova remnants SNRs see
Sabbadin et al 1977 Riesgo  Lopez 2006 Viironen et al
2007 We propose the S2N2 diagram to classify SF compos-
ite and AGN galaxies something until now only possible with
the N iiH vs O iii 5007H diagram However the S2N2
diagram use only the H N ii and S ii emission lines all of
them close in wavelength avoiding reddening corrections and
making possible its use for surveys limited in spectral range
From the main galaxy sample we consider SF galaxies as
those lying below the Kauf03 division composite galaxies as
those lying between the Kauf03 and Kew01 lines and AGNs
galaxies those above the Kew01 division see Fig 2 From the
total sample 82884 galaxies see Sect 2 the 714 19 and
96 correspond to SF composite and AGN galaxies respec-
tively Taking this classication as a reference we plotted the

In order to establish division lines to separate SF composite
and AGN galaxies in the S2N2 diagram we generated contour
plots for each category of galaxies see Fig 3 As our sample
of galaxies is larger for the SF and composite galaxies we
used contours enclosing 90 for those galaxies However as
AGN galaxies are less numerous we used contours enclosing
75 for composite and AGNs The contour plots shown in
Fig 3a delimit two tangent parallel lines generating with this
criterium division lines dened by Eqs 1 and 2 In order to
dene a division line between composite and AGN galaxies we

starforming and composite starforming and composite and composite and AGN galaxies respectively b Same diagram with

sampled the plot area with parallel lines of Eq 1 in bins of
002 dex generating in this way histograms for composite and
AGN galaxies where Eq 3 corresponds to the intersection of
both histograms
i Pure starforming galaxies are separated by
logHN ii  028 x logHS ii  051
988 of galaxies above this line are SF galaxies and correspond
to 88 of the SF sample
ii Starforming and composite galaxies are divided by
logHN ii  028 x logHS ii  040
998 of the SF sample lay above this line However from
all galaxies above this line 8 will correspond to composite
galaxies and the remaining 91 to SF galaxies
iii Composite and AGN galaxies are divided by
logHN ii  028 x logHS ii  025
746 of the galaxies below this line are AGNs Unfortunately
this diagram does not allow separating Seyfert from Liner galax-
ies see Fig 3 Composite galaxies are selected as those be-
tween the lines of Eq 1 and 3 From all galaxies between
both lines 612 332 and 56 correspond to composite
SF and AGN galaxies respectively
In table 1 we compare the N2 ratio considering the Stasinska
limits with the S2N2 diagram in order to test their respective
ability for segregating SF composite and AGN galaxies This
table shows the percentage of galaxies classied according to
each division line as well as its corresponding contamination
and percentage of missed galaxies taking as a reference the clas-
sication of the logN iiH vs logO iii 5007H diagram
As can be appreciated for the SF segregation the N2 division
miss the highest percentage of SF galaxies while our pure star
forming division Eq 1 although with the same contamination
from composite galaxies miss less SF galaxies Moreover our
SF limit Eq 2 enclose almost all SF galaxies with a small
contamination from composite galaxies This provides the ad-
ditional advantage with respect to the N2 diagram that the user
can choose between the possibilities of selecting either most SF
galaxies or galaxies with the smallest contamination from com-
posite galaxies The composite division for the N2 ratio shows
a similar percentage of composite and SF galaxies However
the S2N2 division allows obtaining a higher percentage of com-
posite galaxies missing less composite galaxies with a lower
contamination of SF galaxies and with only a quite small incre-
ment of AGN contamination For segregating AGNs while the
S2N2 diagram provides a lower contamination from composite
galaxies miss 6 more AGNs than using the N2 ratio
In Fig 4 we overplot the prerun photoionization grids
of Dopita et al 2000 and Kew01 for an instantaneous burst
model and for a continuous starburst model The best grid to
our SF galaxies for the S2N2 diagram is the corresponding to
an instantaneous burst model with an electronic density of 10
cm3 using the PEGASE code see Fig 4a As explained in
Dopita et al 2000 the high surface brightness isolated extra-
galactic H ii regions are in general excited by young clusters of
OB stars and that in this case the ionizing EUV spectra and
H ii region emission-line spectra predicted by the PEGASE and
STARBURST99 codes for an instantaneous zero-age star for-
mation model are essentially identical
In their work Dopita et al 2000 and Kew01 mod-
eled a large sample of infrared starburst galaxies using both
the PEGASE v20 Fioc  Rocca-Volmerange 1977 and the
STARBURST99 Leitherer et al 1999 codes to generate the
spectral energy distribution SED In both cases MAPPINGS
III code was used to compute photoionization models The pre-

S2N22 refer to galaxies taking as a reference Eq 13 and Eq 2 respectively The SF block indicate for the S2N22 division
for example that taking all galaxies above Eq 2 the 91 will correspond to SF galaxies and the rest 8 to composite galaxies
also that we have missed 02 of the original SF sample In the case of the composite block for the S2N213 division we are
taking galaxies between the lines dened by Eqs 1 and 3
run grids use photoionization models with ionization parameters
q cm s1 in the range 5x106  q  3x108 and metallicities
from Z005 to 3 Z moreover two values for electronic den-
sity were used 10 and 350 cm3
For starburst galaxies it is expected to have a continuous star
formation over at least a galactic dynamical timescale then the
assumption of a continuous rather than an instantaneous burst
of star formation would be more accurate We generated the
PEGASE grid of Kew01 for a continuous starburst model and
found as expected that this corresponds to SF and composite
objects see Fig 4b since this is the limit used by Kew01 to
parametrize an extreme starburst line in the BPT diagrams
generated
photoionization
STARBURST99 code were not hard enough to produce
the needed S ii ux to enclose all galaxies in the S2N2
diagram The BPT diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral
index of the ionizing radiation eld in the 1-4 ryd interval and
the PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in this range
than that of STARBURST99 being PEGASE the only models
that encompass nearly all of the observed starburst on all three
of the BPT diagrams We also tried the grids of Levesque et al
2010 which use the STARBURST99 code but these grids
comprise an insuciently hard ionizing radiation eld leading
to deciencies in the S ii uxes produced by the models
In galaxy surveys there are at least three methods commonly
used to deal with the presence of AGNs The rst one consists on
removing galaxies hosting AGNs by cross-correlating the sam-
ple with published AGN catalogues eg Condon et al 2002
Serjeant et al 2002 The second one deals with the identication
of the galaxies through the so called BPT diagram Nevertheless
at z  05 the H line is redshifted out of the optical range The
third method consists in subtracting AGNs in a statistical man-
ner used when no other methods are applicable eg Tresse 
Maddox 1998
In addition to those methods we propose the use of the S2N2
diagram which has demonstrated the ability of accurately seg-
regate SF from composite and AGN galaxies The S2N2 dia-
gram has the following advantages it is not necessary an extinc-
tion correction since all the emission lines are close in wave-
length requires only a small spectral range making it suitable
for surveys of limited spectral coverage the SF and composite
divisions of the S2N2 diagram oer less contamination in all
cases with respectively higher number of galaxies for SF and
composites than using only the N2 ratio additionally the user
can choose any of the SF galaxies divisions provided for the
S2N2 diagram either if the smallest contamination from com-
posite galaxies Eq 1 or selecting the most SF galaxies Eq 2
is required Finally the use of the S ii lines do not reduce the
number of galaxies since those lines for AGN galaxies are in
mean 13 times stronger than the O iii line used in the BPT di-
agrams Then comparing the number of galaxies of all the types
the S2N2 diagram have 1 more galaxies than the logN ii
H vs logO iii H diagram Although this diagram has been
used in the past for galaxies it is the rst time that it is presented
as a diagnostic diagram for classifying galaxies Given its ad-
vantages we propose the use of this diagram as an alternative to
the BPT diagrams and N2 ratio to classify galaxies
4 Evolutionary effects on the BPT diagrams
As explained in Section 3 the BPT and other optical emission
lines diagnostic diagrams have become important in the classi-
cation of galaxies In this section our aim is to investigate the
eects of the evolution of galaxies from the three BPT diagrams
For this purpose and with the objective of increase our number
of galaxies we did not take any restriction in magnitude as de-
tailed in the sample selection
In Fig 5 we show the three BPT diagrams for the four
redshift samples As redshift increases we observe that O iii
5007H goes toward higher values In order to explain this
shift in Fig 6 we plotted the ratio O iii 5007H versus
redshift and metallicity only for SF galaxies selected with the
Kauf03 criterion The gap observed around z  0145 see Fig
6a c is due to the H line falling nearby the 5577  sky line
because the residuals are signicant and as a consequence mea-
surements of H around this redshift were lost As shown in Fig
6b there is a clear tendency of the O iii 5007H ratio towards
higher values with redshift which is explained by examining the
same ratio against 12logOH The ratio O iii 5007H has
demonstrated to correlate linearly with metallicity see for ex-
ample Liang et al 2006 Then a decrement in 12logOH
will result in higher values of O iii 5007H see Fig 6b
We observe a decrement of 02 dex in O iii 5007H and a
decrement of 01 dex in 12logOH for the z3 redshift range
with respect to the z0 range
In previous papers Lara-Lopez et al 2009a b we reported
a decrement in 12logOH of 01 dex for the redshift range
03  z  04 comparing galaxies in the same range of luminos-
ity at dierent redshift intervals Since the possible bias such
as luminosity mass and aperture eects of those samples were
carefully studied we demonstrated there that this decrement in
metallicity is due to an intrinsic evolution of the galaxies
Although our z3 sample corresponds to luminous galaxies
if we compare galaxies with the same luminosity taking as a
reference our previous papers the metallicity decrement will be
again of 01 dex and as consequence the eects on the BPT
diagrams will be the same Therefore the evolution observed in
the O iii 5007H lines ratio toward higher values in the three
BPT diagrams could be attributed to a metallicity evolution

completeness The black solid line shows the Kauf03 limit for SF galaxies and the red solid line shows the Kew01 limit for starburst

5007H for the same galaxies right Symbols are the same as in Fig 5 The gap observed at z  0145 is due to the 5577  sky
line falling in the H line missing galaxies around this redshift
On the other hand we analyze the N iiH ratio against red-
shift and metallicity see Fig6c d The N iiH ratio is also
a metallicity index commonly known as N2 and it has been
widely studied since it is not severely aected by dust extinc-
tion see Pettini  Pagel 2004 Among the calibrations of the
N2 index we have for example those of Raimann et al 2000
MA Lara-Lopez et al Evolution from fundamental parameters in SDSS galaxies
Denicolo et al 2002 and Liang et al 2006 In Fig 6d we
observe a clear increasing trend of metallicity following the in-
crease of the N2 index up to 12logOH 90 The galaxies
with 12logOH 9 show a attening and a slightly decrease
of the N2 index with metallicity see Fig 6d This trend was
explained by Kewley et al 2002 using photoionization mod-
els as follows when the secondary production of nitrogen dom-
inates at somewhat higher metallicity the N iiH line ratio
continues to increase despite the decreasing electron tempera-
ture Eventually at still higher metallicities nitrogen becomes
the dominant coolant in the nebula and the electron temperature
falls suciently to ensure that the nitrogen line weakens with
increasing metallicity Liang et al 2006 using SDSS galaxies
with redshifts 004  z  025 observed a small decrement of
the N2 index against metallicity this turnover of the N2 index is
more evident for the higher redshifts z2 and z3 in our sample see
Fig 6d The turnover of the N2 ratio will produce in the O iii
5007H vs N iiH BPT diagram the turnover zone around
N2  04 which is more evident in a density plot see Fig 2
Regarding the two left BPT diagrams of Fig 5b and c since
they share the ratio O iii 5007H the evolutionary eects
due to a decrement in metallicity will be the same as discussed
above The ratio S iiH has never been used before as a metal-
licity indicator because it is far more sensitive to ionization than
to metallicity Liang et al 2006 Moreover it is doublevalued
with metallicity see Fig 4 whereas the ratio OIH is not a
metallicity indicator
Therefore after analyzing all the ratios involved in the three
BPT diagrams we concluded that the evolution of galaxies in
the three BPT diagrams is shown through the O iii 5007H
ratio Since this ratio is a metallicity indicator any decrement
in metallicity will result in higher values of the O iii 5007H
5 Evolution of the massmetallicity and
luminositymetallicity relations
It has been demonstrated that the metallicity and mass of SF
galaxies are strongly correlated with massive and luminous
galaxies showing higher metallicities than less massive galaxies
see Sect 1
The masses of our galaxies were estimated using the
STARLIGHT code which t an observed spectrum with a com-
bination of 150 SSPs from the evolutionary synthesis models of
Bruzual  Charlot 2003 computed using a Chabrier 2003
initial mass function between 01 and 100 M and Padova
1994 evolutionary tracks The 150 base elements span 25 ages
between 1 Myr and 18 Gyr and six metallicities from Z  0005
to 25 Z As argued by Mateus et al 2006 the inclusion of
very low Z SSPs in the base inevitably leads to larger stellar
masses A comparison with the Kaumann et al 2003b mass
estimates which are based on a library of model galaxies con-
structed with Z  025 Z results in systematic discrepancies of
about 01 dex for details see Mateus et al 2006 The masses of
our galaxies were corrected for aperture eects based on the dif-
ferences between the total galaxy magnitude in the r band and
the magnitude inside the ber assuming that the masstolight
ratio does not depend on the radius see Mateus et al 2006 for
details
A histogram of our mass estimates is shown in Fig 7 where
a larger fraction of massive galaxies are observed at highest red-
shifts In Fig 8 we derived the M  Z and L  Z relations for the
galaxies of our sample As explained in previous sections galax-
ies of the z0 and z1 samples are complete in luminosity while for
the z2 and z3 samples the completeness criterium is not taken
into account
The M  Z relation of T04 which is valid over the range
85  logMstarM  115 shows a steep M  Z relation for
masses from 1085 to 10105 M that attens at higher masses In
such study T04 analyzed galaxies with redshift ranges 0005 
z  03 It is important to notice that in our M  Z relation
a atness is not observed for masses  10105 for the redshift
range z0 see Fig 8a but this atness is observed for the higher
redshift samples Then the atness observed by T04 depends on
the redshift range observed In order to establish the bias-free
M  Z relation for local galaxies Kewley  Ellison et al 2008
recalibrated the M  Z relation of T04 with galaxies at 004  z
 01 since 004 is the minimum redshift to avoid bers eects
Kewley et al 2005
In Fig 8 M  Z and L  Z relations the metallicity decre-
ment for the z3 redshift sample discussed in our previous articles
Lara-Lopez et al 2009a b is also evident In order to t our
local M  Z relation we estimated the mode of the metallic-
ity of the galaxies in mass bins of 01 dex and t them with
a second order polynomial ya0  a1x  a2x2 with a0 
0467 a1  1611 a2  0067 We also t a second or-
der polynomial to our M  Z relation for galaxies at z3 with
a0  0632 a1  1557 a2  0063 All the ts are shown in
Fig 9 According to them our M  Z relation for the galaxies
at z3 is  02 dex lower compared to our local galaxy sample
Additionally in Fig 9 we compare the M  Z ts from litera-
ture at dierent redshifts with our results At z  015 we rep-
resent the calibration of T04 at z  007 the T04 recalibration
of Kewley  Ellison et al 2008 as well as our t for the local
z0 M  Z relation At higher redshift we represent our t to
the M  Z relation for galaxies at z3 as well as the t of Erb et
al 2006a at z 22 scaled to the T04 metallicity calibration
Due to their high redshift Erb et al 2006a used the N2 method
and the calibration of Pettini  Pagel 2004 to estimate their
metallicities We converted their N2 metallicities to the R23 cali-
bration of T04 with the metallicity conversions given in Kewley
 Ellison et al 2008 Even with the dispersion of our local
sample our M  Z t is a little lower but in a good agreement
with those of T04 and Kewley  Ellison et al 2008 Since
we are using the T04 calibration of the R23 method to estimate
metallicities the main dierences with the t of T04 are the red-
shift ranges as discussed above and the mass estimates since
T04 and Kewley  Ellison et al 2008 adopted a Kroupa et al
2001 IMF while we are using a Chabrier 2003 IMF
Although redshift ranges are dierent the comparison of our
t for the z3 sample with the Erb et al 2006a data at z22
which also use a Chabrier IMF are similar in 12logOH see
Fig 9 As will be explained in the next sections our z3 sam-
ple is conformed mainly by spiral galaxies while the Erb et al
2006a sample corresponds to a mix of morphological types
A possible explanation for the high metallicities of Erb et al
2006a or to the lower metallicities of our sample is given by
Calura et al 2009 who using models that distinguish among
dierent morphological types through the use of dierent infall
outow and star formation reproduce the mass-metallicity rela-
tion in galaxies of all morphological types taking as a reference
the observational M  Z relations of Kewley  Ellison 2008
Savaglio et al 2005 Erb et al 2006a and Maiolino et al
2008 In his work Calura et al 2009 predicts that at any red-
shift elliptical galaxies will present the highest stellar masses
and the highest metallicities whereas the irregulars are the least
massive and metallic galaxies being spiral galaxies at an inter-
mediate stage
MA Lara-Lopez et al Evolution from fundamental parameters in SDSS galaxies
This means that being our z3 sample composed only by spi-
ral galaxies our metallicities will be lower than if our sample
were composed by a mix of morphological types The observed
metallicities and SFRs for the Erb et al 2006a sample at z22
according to the study of Calura et al 2009 indicate that their
galaxies are likely to represent a morphological mix partly com-
posed of spirals or proto-spirals and partly of ellipticals or
proto-ellipticals Calura et al 2009 predicts for the Erb et al
2006a galaxies at z22 lower metallicities 03 dex if the
sample were composed by spiral galaxies Then the similarities
in 12logOH of our M  Z relation at z3 with the one of Erb
et al 2006a at z22 could be explained by the morphological
selection in each case lower metallicities in our M  Z relation
can be addressed to the prominence of spiral galaxies whereas
larger metallicities in the M  Z relation of the Erb et al 2006a
is a consequence of a sample formed by a mix of morphological
types In other words the morphology of the galaxies is crucial
in deriving and comparing the metallicity and the M Z relation
An additional point to take into account is that our samples
plotted in Fig 9 are selected with dierente magnitude complete-
ness then our z3 redshift sample is high luminous and massive
than our local one This must be taken into account when com-
paring both M  Z relations Unfortunately our z0 sample does
not have a signicant number of galaxies in the same absolute
magnitude range of the z3 sample making imposible to generate
a local M  Z relation comparable in luminosity to the z3 one
Comparing our M  Z relation with that of high-z samples in
the literature we have the M Z relation of Savaglio et al 2005
at z  07 In their study they found only a slightly decrement in
metallicity for galaxies at z  07 compared with the local one of
T04 which is inconsistent with the  02 dex decrement found in
our z3 MZ relation Nevetheless as pointed out by Rodrigues et
al 2008 the sample of Savaglio et al 2005 have spectra with
low S N and spectral resolution as well as extinction problems
With a more consistent result Rodrigues et al 2008 generated
the M  Z relation for galaxies at z  07 nding a decrement
in metallicity of 03 dex compared with the local one of T04
Unfortunately given the small range in their stellar masses it
was not possible to constrain the evolution of the shape of their
M  Z relation
There are two main ways to explain the origin of the M  Z
relation The rst one is related to the well-known eect of
downsizing eg Cowie et al 1996 Gavazzi  Scodeggio 1996
in which lower mass galaxies form their stars later and on
longer time-scales than more massive systems implying low
star formation eciencies in lowmass galaxies Efstathiou
2000 Brooks et al 2007 Mouhcine et al 2008 Tassis et al
2008 Scannapieco et al 2008 Ellison et al 2008 Therefore
lowmass galaxies are expected to show lower metallicities
Supporting this scenario Calura et al 2009 reproduced the
M  Z relation with chemical evolution models for ellipticals
spirals and irregular galaxies by means of an increasing e-
ciency of star formation with mass in galaxies of all morpho-
logical types without the need for outows favoring the loss of
metals in the less massive galaxies In a recent study that sup-
ports this result for massive galaxies Vale Asari et al 2009
model the time evolution of stellar metallicity using a closed-
box chemical evolution picture They suggest that the M  Z
relation for galaxies in the mass range from 1098 to 101165 M
is mainly driven by the star formation history and not by inows
or outows
A second scenario to explain the M  Z relation is attributed
to metal and baryon loss due to gas outow where lowmass
galaxies eject large amounts of metalenriched gas by super-
Fig 7 Normalized mass histogram for all our samples Dark
solid line represent galaxies at z0 dashed line galaxies at z1
point dashed line galaxies at z3 and clear solid line galaxies at
z3 The histograms were constructed do not taking into account
the completeness for galaxies at z2 and z3
novae winds before high metallicities are reached while mas-
sive galaxies have deeper gravitational potentials which helps to
retain their gas thus reaching higher metallicities Larson 1974
Dekel  Silk 1986 MacLow  Ferrara 1999 Maier et al 2004
T04 De Lucia et al 2004 Kobayashi et al 2007 Finlantor 
Dave 2008 As pointed out in the highresolution simulations
of Brooks et al 2007 supernovae feedback plays a crucial role
in lowering the star formation eciency in lowmass galaxies
Without energy injection from supernovae to regulate the star
formation gas that remains in galaxies rapidly cools forms stars
and increases its metallicity too early producing a M Z relation
too at compared to observations
An additional interpretation of the M  Z relation is linked
to some properties of star formation as the IMF Koppen et al
2007 suggested that the M  Z relation can be explained by a
higher upper-mass cuto in the IMF in more massive galaxies
Finally we also generated the L  Z relation for our redshift
samples see Fig 8b Nevertheless our z3 sample is restricted
to a small range in luminosity making impossible to t a curve
The local L  Z relation is well established by eg T04 then
due to our small luminosity range at z3 we can not conclude any-
thing about the L  Z relation Nevertheless the M  Z relation
has demonstrated to be more stronger and tighter than the L  Z
relation conrming that stellar mass is a more meaningful phys-
ical parameter than luminosity when both are compared with gas
metallicity Savaglio et al 2005
51 Evolutionofthemass-to-lightratio
As explained by Erb et al 2006a at higher redshifts the M  Z
relation is clearly more physically meaningful than the L  Z
relation A corollary is that the local L  Z relation is simply a
result of the strong correlation between mass and luminosity at
low redshift
We also analyzed the evolution of the mass-to-light ML
ratio see Fig 10 For a given mass we observed higher lumi-
nosities for the z3 sample compared with the local one which
means lower ML ratios as redshift increase In order to observe

samples see Fig 10 obtaining a0  0924 and a1  0544
for z0 and a0  18686 and a1  1304 for z3 The variation
in ML at a given rest frame optical luminosity can be as much
as a factor of 70 Shapley et al 2005 which means that for
any range in luminosity there exist an extended range of stellar
masses This large variation in ML explains the lack of corre-
lation in the L  Z relation for the z3 sample compared to the
local relation For a small range of absolute magnitudes in the
z3 sample we have a widely range of masses making possible
to generate a M  Z relation At higher redshifts the eect is
the same as pointed out by Erb et al 2006a nding for star-
forming galaxies at z22 in a small range of luminosity a wide
range of stellar mass

6 Morphology indicators and SFR
The variation of SFR activity and young stellar content along
the Hubble sequence is one of the most recognizable features of
galaxies In fact this variation in stellar content is part of the ba-
sis of the Hubble classication itself Hubble 1926 and under-
standing its physical nature and origin is fundamental to com-
prehend the galaxy evolution for a review see Kennicutt 1998
and Kennicutt et al 1994 The general picture presented by
Roberts 1963 Searle et al 1973 Larson  Tinsley 1978
and Kennicutt et al 1994 point that earlytype galaxies types
S0-Sb represent systems which formed most of their gas into
stars on timescales much less than the Hubble time while the
disks of latetype systems ScIm have formed stars at roughly
a constant rate since they formed
For most of the 20th century catalogues of morphologi-
cally classied galaxies were compiled by individuals or small
teams of astronomers eg Sandage 1961 de Vaucouleurs 1991
Nowadays selection criteria is based on galaxy properties such
as color concentration index spectral features surface bright-
ness prole other structural parameters or some combination of
these eg Strateva et al 2001 Abraham et al 2003 Kaumann
et al 2004 Conselice 2006 Scarlata et al 2007 With the advent
of modern surveys such as the SDSS and with the participation
of thousands of volunteers it was possible the development of
the Galaxy Zoo project eg Lintott et al 2008 providing vi-
sual morphological classication for more than 107 galaxies
In this section we will focus on the relations at dierent red-
shifts between the SFR metallicity mass and morphology of
SF galaxies selected with the Kaumann et al 2001 criteria as
explained in the Section 2
61 EvolutionoftheSFR
We estimate the SFR with the H emission line ux following
the Kennicutt 1998 expression
SFRM yr1  79 x 1042LH ergs s1
where LH denotes the intrinsic H luminosity and H is cor-
rected by dust extinction and underlying stellar absorption as ex-
plained in Sec 2 This calibration is derived from evolutionary
synthesis models that assume solar metallicity and no dust and
is valid for a Te104 K and case B recombination
Recent studies have explored the relationship between the
stellar mass and the SFR in galaxies at dierent redshifts It has
been shown that SFR critically depends on the galaxy mass both
at low and high redshifts eg Gavazzi et al 2002 Brinchmann
et al 2004 Dickinson et al 2004 Feulner et al 2005 Papovich
et al 2006
In our sample galaxies with high SFRs are more abundant
at higher redshifts see Fig 11 a fact already observed in non
biased samples e g Noeske et al 2007a In Fig 11a we show
12logOH against logSFR Note that although our z3 sam-
ple of galaxies is biased to the most luminous and massive galax-
ies the observed decrement of  01 dex in 12logOH found
in Lara-Lopez et al 2009a b is also present Regarding the z0
sample of galaxies there is a clear sequence with galaxies go-
ing toward higher values of SFR as metallicity increases This
tendency can be explained from the z0 sample in the M  Z rela-
tion of Fig 8 where massive galaxies corresponds to the highest
metallicity galaxies and for more massive galaxies we expect
higher SFRs see Fig 11 Also we can slightly appreciate a
population of galaxies with higher SFR see Fig 11a This pop-
ulation will form a tail when the mass is taken into account
as will be shown in Fig 11b As redshift increases we appre-
ciate in Fig 11a for galaxies at z2 and z3 a attening of the
SFR vs 12logOH relation with most of the galaxies show-
ing logSFR between 1 and 2
In Fig 11b we show the logMstarM versus logSFR
plot Galaxies at z0 show a main sequence where massive galax-
ies have higher SFRs This main sequence was identied by
Noeske et al 2007a studying galaxies with redshifts from
02 to 11 nding that this main sequence moves as a whole
to higher SFR as redshift increases The SSFR dened as the
total SFR divided by the stellar mass reects the strength of
the current burst of star formation relative to the underlying
galaxy mass Deep galaxy surveys have consistently found that
the SSFR depends strongly on both M and redshift with the
bulk of star formation occurring earlier in massive galaxies than
in less massive systems Guzman et al 1997 Brinchmann 
Ellis 2000 Juneau et al 2005 Bauer et al 2005 Bell et al 2005
Perez-Gonzalez et al 2005 Feulner et al 2005 Papovich et al
2006 Caputi et al 2006 Reddy et al 2006
We also analyzed the evolution of the SSFR as a func-
tion of the metallicity and the stellar mass Interestingly in the
12logOH vs SSFR diagram Fig 12a the observed popu-
lation of Fig 11a at z0 is more evident showing a higher SSFR
SSFR  10 than the other galaxies at the same redshift We
are going to investigate this tail in more detail in the next sub-
section
In Fig 12b we show the logMstarM versus logSSFR
plot The SSFR increase with redshift showing for more mas-
sive galaxies a tendency toward lower SSFR values which is in
agreement with the results of Noeske et al 2007b for galaxies
with z  02 Massive galaxies shows lower SSFR because they
probably have low gas fractions and have thus nearly nished as-
sembling their stellar mass Erb et al 2006b Reddy et al 2006
On the other hand the presence of dust has demonstrated to play
an important role deriving the SSFR as shows by Pannella et
al 2009 getting for dust free galaxies a at SSFR for redshift
bins centered at z  16 and 21 instead of a drop with increasing
mass In our samples the SFR and SSFR were derived through
the dust corrected H ux showing that for redshifts less than
04 this atness is absent
We found also evidences of two populations in Fig 12b one
at redshift z0 which concentrate in a square delimited by the con-
tour plots and another one showing SSFR  10 which is more
evident for the higher redshifts samples but it is also evident in
the z0 sample This population of galaxies will be explained in
the next subsection as a consequence of the morphology of the
galaxies
62 TheSSFRasamorphologyindicator
In this section we investigate the morphology of the galaxies in
our sample with the aim of clarify if the tail observed in Figs
11 and 12 with higher SFR and SSFR in the z0 sample respec-
tively is related to specic morphological types We will focus
on samples z0 and z3 because those samples show their galax-
ies uniformly distributed on mass Galaxies of samples z1 and z2
show systematic problems due to sky lines and to incomplete-
ness respectively
We used the g  r color the concentration index cR90R50
eg Park Choi et al 2005 and the SSFR eg Salim et al
2009 which are the most common indexes to segregate early
from latetype galaxies see Fig 13 We used k-corrected ber
colors for all the galaxies samples

contamination reaching about 30 for a sample with visually
identied morphological types Because the u band shows large
errors for the SDSS galaxies we decided to use g  r  06
eg Schawinski et al 2009 Masters et al 2009 which allows
separate early from latetype galaxies As observed in Fig 13a
97 of the z3 sample of galaxies correspond to a latetype
morphology
The concentration index cR90R50 has been successfully
used in segregating late c  286 from earlytype c  286
subsets eg Shimasaku et al 2001 Strateva et al 2001 Goto et
al 2002 Nakamura et al 2003 Deng et al 2009 Nevertheless
contamination in the early and latetype subsets separated using
the concentration index is typically about 20 Yamauchi et al
2005 Shimasaku et al 2001 Using both color and concentra-
tion index Park  Choi et al 2005 used the color-color space
u  r versus g  r and the concentration index c1R50R90
 035 as a reliable morphological classicator In Fig 13b we

show the concentration index c vs g  r for galaxies at z0 and z3
with the  95 of the z3 galaxies corresponding to latetype c
 286 galaxies
Finally the SSFR has been used as an indicator of early
and latetype morphology eg Wolf et al 2009 Salim et al
2009 since latetypes have blue colors and high SSFRs while
earlytypes have red colors and low SSFRs For our z3 sample
 89 of the galaxies have logSSFR  10 see Fig 13c
and as reported by Salim et al 2009 blue actively star-forming
galaxies has logSSFR  10 while lower values would corre-
spond to the green valley and red-sequence galaxies As argued
by Weinmann et al 2006 the use of the SSFR would give us
important clues in determining the morphological galaxy type
since for example a genuine SF disk galaxy may appear red
due to strong extinction eg when seen edge-on and thus be
classied as earlytype based on its color while the SFR and
morphology quantiers would classify it as a latetype galaxy
Our sample of galaxies at z3 is mainly composed by latetype
galaxies as indicated by any of the morphological classicators
discussed above We decided to take these galaxies as a refer-
ence to delimitate the latetype zone After trying all the dis-
cussed methods in order to obtain a reliable morphological clas-
sication and following the location of the z3 galaxies in Fig
13c we conclude that the best method is to use both logSSFR
 10 and a color g  r  06 After applying this criterion to
our z0 sample we end with 7967 galaxies classied as latetype
corresponding to the 13 of the original sample If we repeat
the comparative analysis between SFR and metallicity and SFR
against stellar mass see Fig 14 for galaxies at z0 and z1 the
tail with higher SFR identied in previous sections corresponds
to latetype galaxies Note that the separation between late and
earlytype in the stellar mass versus SFR is a straight frontier
see Fig 14b because the separation criterion is the SSFR
In order to alternatively assess this statement we com-
pare our results with selected mock galaxy samples from the
Millennium simulations Springel et al 2005 We used the
Bower2006a catalog Bower et al 2006 which give us red-
shift SDSS k-corrected colors stellar mass and H luminosity
among other information From the original catalog we selected
randomly 35000 galaxies at z0 and z04 with the H line in
emission in order to be able to compare with our galaxies As
shown in Fig 15 there is a clean separation between a red se-
MA Lara-Lopez et al Evolution from fundamental parameters in SDSS galaxies
 Our t to the M  Z relation for sample z3 is in agreement
with the one of Erb et al 2006a at z  22 We attribute
this similarity to the galaxy morphology in the dierent sam-
ples since our z3 sample is conformed by latetype galaxies
while the sample of Erb et al is composed by a mix of early
and latetype galaxies According to Calura et al 2009 the
M  Z relation of latetype galaxies will have systematically
lower metallicities than a M  Z relation conformed by a mix
of early and latetype galaxies
 We analyzed the evolution of the mass-to-light ratio observ-
ing lower ML ratios as redshift increase For a small range
of absolute magnitudes in the z3 sample we have a wide
range of mass making it possible to generate the M  Z re-
lation but dicult to generate the L  Z relation
 The decrement in metallicity observed in previous papers for
galaxies at redshift z3 Lara-Lopez et al 2009ab is also ob-
served even though in this study we are not restricting our
galaxy luminosities as in our previous studies
 We estimated the SFR and SSFR for our sample of
galaxies and analyzed its relation with 12logOH and
logMstarM conrming the existence of a main sequence
reported by Noeske et al 2007 in the logSFR vs
logMstarM plot Consistently we found that higher SFRs
and SSFRs increase with redshift
 We analyzed the morphology of our galaxies through the
g  r color the concentration index R90R50 and the SSFR
concluding that the best method to determine the morphol-
ogy was combining both a color of g  r  06 and a
logSSFR10 for selecting latetype galaxies
 Our z3 sample of galaxies is mainly formed by latetype
galaxies a fact that helped us to classify morphological types
at lower redshift The fact that at higher redshift the fraction
of latetype galaxies is larger was conrmed by using mock
galaxy catalogues from Millennium simulations
 We found at the higher redshift a population with higher
SFR and SSFR than the galaxies in the z0 sample After clas-
sifying late and earlytype galaxies in the z0 sample we real-
ized that the observed tail showing higher SFR and SSFR is
formed by latetype galaxies demonstrating the connection
of the galaxy morphology with the SFR in a new fashion
Fig 15 Mass versus g  r color for Millennium galaxies Black
and yellow dots represent galaxies at z0 and z3 respectively
quence formed by galaxies with gr  08 the green valley with
06  g  r  08 and the blue cloud with g  r  06 It can be
observed how galaxies move towards latetype galaxies as red-
shift increases Then this results are consistent with observing
mainly latetype galaxies at redshift z3
7 Summary and Conclusions
We analyzed a sample of emission line galaxies selected in four
redshift intervals from 0 to 04 in bins of 01 taking into ac-
count the magnitude completeness of every redshift interval In
this paper we introduced the S2N2 diagram as a star-forming
composite and AGNs galaxy classicator we estimated metal-
licities using the R23 method and analyzed the evolutive eects
of galaxies from the three BPT diagrams Additionally we stud-
ied the evolution of the M  Z and L  Z relations and ana-
lyzed the evolution and implications of the galaxy morphology
in the SFRmass and metallicity relations From these analysis
we conclude the following
 Using the Kew01 photoionization grids and the Kauf03 and
Kew01 SF and starburst limit respectively in the N ii H
vs O iii 5007H diagram we have demonstrated that the
S2N2 is a wellbehaved diagnostic diagram eciently clas-
sifying star-forming composite and AGNs galaxies
 We analyzed the galaxy evolution using the three main BPT
diagrams N ii H S ii H and O i 6300H vs O iii
5007H in our four redshift bins observing an evolution
toward higher values of the O iii 5007H ratio This evo-
lution is a consequence of the metallicity evolution as red-
shift increases reected in the three BPT diagrams because
the ratio O iii 5007H is a good metallicity indicator As
a result a metallicity decrement will be reected in higher
values of this ratio
 We analyzed the evolution of the M  Z and L  Z relations
observing that at higher redshift values both relations evolve
towards lower values of metallicity We discovered that the
at zone of the M  Z relation reported by Tremonti et al
2004 for galaxies with logMstarM  105 is mainly
constituted by galaxies at z  01 samples at z1 z2 and z3
Galaxies at z0 redshift could be tted with a linear function
Our M  Z relation at redshift z3 is 02 dex lower than our
local one
Our work provide a useful tool for classifying galaxies with
the S2N2 diagram and demonstrating how galaxies evolve on
the BPT diagrams as a consequence of metallicity evolution
We also analyzed the mass metallicity and SFR relations not-
ing that galaxies in the redshift sample z3 have lower values of
metallicity higher SFRs and morphology indicators associated
to latetypes In this study we pointed out the importance of the
morphology of galaxies when deriving conclusions Since a sam-
ple conformed by latetype galaxies will show lower values of
metallicity than ones formed by a mix of morphological types
