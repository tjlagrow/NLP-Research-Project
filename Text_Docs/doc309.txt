ABSTRACT
The high end of the stellar mass function of galaxies is observed to have little evolution since z  1
This represents a stringent constraint for mergerbased models aimed at explaining the evolution of
the most massive galaxies in the concordance CDM cosmology In this Letter we show that it is
possible to remove the tension between the above observations and model predictions by allowing a
fraction of stars to be scattered to the Diuse Stellar Component DSC of galaxy clusters at each
galaxy merger as recently suggested by the analysis of N-body hydrodynamical simulations To this
purpose we use the morgana model of galaxy formation in a minimal version in which gas cooling
and star formation are switched o after z  1 In this way any predicted evolution of the galaxy
stellar mass function is purely driven by mergers We show that even in this extreme case the
predicted degree of evolution of the high end of the stellar mass function is larger than that suggested
by data Assuming instead that a signicant fraction  30 per cent of stars are scattered in the DSC
at each merger event leads to a signicant suppression of the predicted evolution in better agreement
with observational constraints while providing a total amount of DSC in clusters which is consistent
with recent observational determinations

1 INTRODUCTION
The CDM model provides the standard framework
to study the formation of cosmic structures with only
residual uncertainties on the values of cosmological pa-
rameters However while consensus on the agreement
between model and data is reached for observables that
probe the large-scale structure of the Universe eg
Springel Frenk  White 2006 the situation becomes far
less clear when the formation and evolution of galaxies
are addressed In this case the underlying astrophysical
processes at play are so complex and poorly understood
that it is very dicult to disentangle the cosmologically-
driven building of structure from the eects of such pro-
cesses
At variance with the behaviour of Dark Matter DM
halos the building of galaxies shows a downsizing or
anti-hierarchical behaviour at low redshift the spe-
cic star-formation rate is higher for smaller galaxies
while more massive galaxies show higher specic star-
formation rates at higher redshift see eg Cowie et al
1996 Bundy et al 2006 Besides stars in more massive
objects appear to have formed on average earlier than
those in less massive ones see eg Treu et al 2005
Thomas et al 2005 While for the bulk of galaxies
this behaviour can be explained as due to the eect of
stellar or AGN feedback see eg Croton et al 2006
Bower et al 2006 the nearly passive evolution of the
most massive galaxies highlights a possible paradox of
present models of galaxy formation More specically
galaxies with stellar masses  1012 M show a remark-
ably constant number density out to redshift z  1 see
eg Fontana et al 2004 Drory et al 2005 Yamada et
al 2005 Zucca et al 2005 Caputi et al 2006 Bundy
et al 2006 Fontana et al 2006 Wake et al 2006
Cimatti Daddi  Renzini 2006 Brown et al 2006 but
see also Bell et al 2004 Faber et al 2005 These excep-
tionally massive galaxies are the giant ellipticals which
typically represent the dominant galaxies of rich galaxy
groups and clusters Furthermore galaxy clusters are the
most massive DM halos at low redshift and are predicted
and observed to be still undergoing a phase of signicant
merger events The massive ellipticals that reside at the
centres of two merging clusters are predicted to merge
after one dynamical friction time which is of order of 1
Gyr This leads to two important consequences namely
an evolution of the stellar mass function which is con-
strained by data and mergers between big ellipticals
These are not associated to starbursts due to the lack of
cold gas supply in the merging galaxies dry mergers
and are rather dicult to observe van Dokkum 2005
Masjedi et al 2006 Bell et al 2006
On the other hand galaxy clusters are pervaded by
a Diuse Stellar Component DSC which only in part
can be associated with the extended halo of a dominant
cD galaxy These stars are usually not accounted for in
the census of the stellar mass budged in clusters Their
number and mass can be estimated by observing intra-
cluster planetary nebulae Arnaboldi et al 2002 2004

pernovae Gal-Yam et al 2003 Neill et al 2005 AGB
stars Durrell et al 2002 using surface photometry of
single clusters Gonzalez et al 2000 Feldmeier et al
2002 Feldmeier et al 2004b Krick et al 2006 or by
Monaco et al
measuring the diuse light in coadded images of many
galaxy clusters Zibetti et al 2005 These observa-
tions give fractions of total luminosity contributed by the
DSC ranging from 10 to 40 per cent in massive clusters
The relatively poorer Virgo and Fornax clusters have ob-
served fractions of about 10 per cent Feldmeier et al
2003 Durrell et al 2003 Neill et al 2005 Mihos et al
2005 thus suggesting an increasing DSC fraction with
cluster richness see also Lin  Mohr 2004 The origin
of the DSC in galaxy clusters has been studied with the
aid of N-body simulations Napolitano et al 2003 Mu-
rante et al 2004 Willman et al2004 Sommer-Larsen
et al2005 Rudick et al 2006 Stanghellini Gonzalez-
Garcia  Manchado 2006 reaching the general conclu-
sion that a DSC is naturally expected to arise from the
hierarchical assembly of clusters In particular Murante
et al 2006 showed that 60 to 90 per cent of the DSC is
generated at z  1 and only a minor part of it is due to
tidal stripping the rest being contributed by relaxation
processes during galaxy mergers
Clearly the possibility that a signicant amount of
stars are diused into the DSC during the lowredshift
dry assembly of the most massive ellipticals has im-
portant consequences of the evolution of the highmass
end of the galaxy stellar mass function Massive galaxies
at the centre of clusters contain a signicant fraction of
the total stellar mass of the cluster ranging from 10  30
per cent for poor clusters Mh  1014 M to 5  10
per cent for rich ones Mh  1015 M see eg Lin 
Mohr 2004 If at each merger these galaxies lost a fair
fraction of their stars to the DSC component and if this
mechanism were responsible for the build-up of most of
the DSC then this process would limit the mass growth
of the central galaxy by mergers since z  1
In this Letter we show using the results of N-body
simulations and the morgana galaxy formation model
Monaco Fontanot  Taoni 2006 that the evolution
of massive galaxies driven by mergers is severely con-
strained by observations and that this tension is removed
if a signicant fraction of stars is lost to the DSC at each
merger Once this eect is taken into account we predict
a much slower evolution of the high end of the stellar
mass function at z  1 while producing an amount of
DSC at z  0 which is consistent with current obser-
vational limits In this paper we use a cosmology with
0  03   07 b  004 H0  70 km s1 Mpc1
8  09 none of the results depends sensitively on any
of these parameters
2 BUILDING OF THE DIFFUSE STELLAR COMPONENT
Murante et al
2004 2006 analysed hydrodynam-
ical simulations of galaxy clusters performed with the
GADGET-2 code Springel 2005 which include the pro-
cesses of star formation and supernova feedback They
found that the DSC represents a signicant fraction of
the stellar population in clusters approximately ranging
from 10 to 40 per cent with an increasing trend with
cluster mass see the blue points of Fig 1 thus in keep-
ing with observational results Murante et al
also shows that the bulk of the DSC is not due to tidal
stripping of non-central galaxies which accounts for no
more than 5-10 per cent of the total stellar component
but to relaxation processes taking place during the dry
mergers leading to the build-up of the central dominant
Fig 1 Fraction of stars in Diuse Stellar Component for model
DM halos with Mh  1014 M The black open squares refer to the
expectation of morgana with only tidal stripping fscatter  0
the red triangles to the case fscatter  03 The continuous and
dotted lines give the average thick lines and 1 thin lines
location of the points For comparison we show the results from
simulations by Murante et al
2006 as circles with errorbars
which represent the rms scatter within dierent mass intervals
galaxy As a result up to  30 per cent of the stellar
mass of the merging galaxies becomes unbound to the
resulting central galaxy
In terms of the mass of each
merging satellite this translates in 10  50 per cent of its
mass which is scattered to the DSC depending on the
mass ratio of the merging galaxies
In this Letter we resort to the novel morgana model
of galaxy formation to quantify the eect of including
the generation of a DSC at each merger on the evolu-
tion of the stellar mass function This code has been
shown to be able to reproduce the build-up of the mas-
sive galaxies Fontana et al 2006 and the population
of AGNs Fontanot et al 2006 For the purpose of the
present analysis morgana has been modied by switch-
ing o gas cooling and star formation at z  1 In this
way we minimize the evolution of the stellar mass func-
tion which is then driven only by mergers Furthermore
we implement the generation of the DSC as follows i
tidal stripping of stars is applied to satellite galaxies1
ii when the satellite merges with the central galaxy a
fraction fscatter of its stars are scattered to the DSC Pre-
scription ii is at variance with Monaco et al 2006
where scattering is allowed only in major mergers Such
a recipe inspired by the results of Murante et al 2006
is deliberately simplied and we use it here to provide a
qualitative picture of the eect of including the produc-
tion of the DSC into our model
In Fig 1 we compare the fraction of DSC fDSC  as a
function of cluster mass found in the simulations anal-
ysed by Murante et al 2004 and predicted by mor-
gana for both fscatter  0 and 03 morgana pre-
dictions have been computed for 37 clusters with mass
1 At the time of rst periastron of the satellite orbit in the host
DM halo all the stars that lie beyond the tidal radius according
to the unperturbed prole of the galaxy are moved to the DSC
DSC and the evolution of massive galaxies
MH  1014 M identied in a 150 Mpc box where the
DM clustering is sampled with 5123 particles This com-
parison shows that using a xed value of fscatter pro-
duces a milder dependence of fDSC on the cluster mass
thus conrming that our approach to introduce the ef-
fect of the DSC generation is oversimplied Still pre-
dictions from the semianalytical model and from the
hydrodynamical simulations share several common fea-
tures For instance tidal stripping is conrmed to bring
only  10 per cent of the total stellar mass to the DSC
with fscatter  03 required to better account for simu-
lation results Quite interestingly we also veried that
 70 of the DSC is generated at z  1 by both mor-
gana and simulations Based on these results we con-
clude that the morgana model can be used to test the
eect of the DSC generation on the evolution of the high
end of the galaxy stellar mass function
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As mentioned in the Introduction the population of
massive galaxies with M  1011 M show a modest
but signicant degree of evolution since z  1 Using the
GOODS-MUSIC sample Fontana et al
2006 found
this evolution to amount to a factor of 25 in mass den-
sity a degree of evolution which has been shown to be
consistent with the predictions of morgana On the
other hand very massive galaxies with M  1012 M
show a much lower degree of evolution We use here as a
convenient quantication of this evolution the logarith-
mic increase of M45 the stellar mass at which the stel-
lar mass function reaches the level LogM   1045
Mpc3 from z  1 to 0 A detailed discussion on how
to measure this quantity from data is beyond the scope
of this paper Using data from Yamada et al 2005
Drory et al 2005 Bundy et al 2006 Cimatti et al
2006 Fontana et al 2006 and Brown et al 2006
we infer that the evolution of M45 between z  1 and
0 cannot be larger than 02 dex This modest evolution
clearly requires that massive galaxies must have had a
small net gain in stellar mass during the last 7 Gyr
To test the consistency of this constraint with the ex-
pected evolution of massive galaxies we use the mor-
gana model as follows We follow the evolution of the
galaxy population until z  1 assuming the standard
choice of parameters used both in Monaco et al 2006
and Fontana et al 2006 with2 fscatter  0 We then
ne-tune AGN feedback3 to reproduce almost exactly the
analytic t of the z  1 stellar mass function proposed
by Fontana et al
2006 Fig 2 shows the predicted
mass function at z  1 dashed line compared to the
GOODS-MUSIC estimate in the redshift range 08  13
the shaded region bound by the analytic t of the ob-
served stellar mass function at z  1 and the same curve
shifted in mass by 02 dex highlights the allowed range
of the high end at z  0 The model is known to overes-
timates at z  1 the number density of smaller objects
M  1011 M Fontana et al 2006 and this is no-
ticeable in the gure As already mentioned in Section
2 This is done in order to have all models starting from the same
conguration at z  1 As in morgana 70 of the DSC is created
at z  1 we correct our fDSC values by multiplying them by 107
3 The ne tuning is performed by setting the fjet0 parameter
to 2 in place of 1 and assuming the forced quenching procedure
see Monaco et al 2006 for details
Fig 2 Evolution of the stellar mass function from z  1 to
z  0 In all panels observational data points are from GOODS-
MUSIC Fontana et al 2006 and refer to the stellar mass function
in the redshift range 08  13 the green continuous line gives the
best t proposed by the same authors at z  1 The shaded region
highlights the allowed evolution of the high end of the stellar mass
function by 02 dex The red dashed line gives the model results at
z  1 computed assuming fscatter  0 and ne-tuned to reproduce
very accurately the analytic t at the same redshift while the blue
continuous line gives the prediction at z  0 computed switching
o all astrophysical processes cooling star formation and feed-
back and setting fscatter to the value specied in the panel The
thin dotted horizontal line marks the level 1045 Mpc3 that is
used to quantify the evolution of the stellar mass function
2 we then compute the evolution of the galaxy popula-
tion at z  1 by switching o all the astrophysical pro-
cesses including cooling star formation feedback galac-
tic winds and superwinds so that galaxies can grow only
by mergers The solid line in the upper left panel of
Fig 2 shows the results of this model for fscatter  0
we obtain  log M45  03 ie the mass of the most
massive galaxies grows by more than a factor of two in
line with the results by De Lucia et al 2006 and De
Lucia  Blaizot 2006 but at variance with respect to
observational results
This result highlights the presence of a potential para-
dox in cosmological models of galaxy formation even
under the assumption that mergers only drive the evo-
lution of the galaxy population at z  1 model predic-
tions still provide too strong an evolution of the high end
of the stellar mass function This conclusion is robust
against possible uncertainties in the dynamical friction
time-scales which determine the dierence between the
timing of DM halo merging and galaxy merging We ver-
ied that since these timescales are much smaller than
the Hubble time an uncertainty in their estimate does
not signicantly inuence the nal results
As already discussed in Section 2 the model with
fscatter  0 also underestimates the fraction of DSC pro-
duced in simulations for the most massive clusters see
Fig 1 The other three panels of Fig 2 show the evolu-
tion of the stellar mass function for values of fscatter03
05 and 08 Values between 03 and 05 are sucient
to suppress  log M45 to below 02 dex and at the
Monaco et al
while observational estimates depend upon a number of
hypothesis linking the observables eg number of intra
cluster planetary nebulae ratio of uxes from the DSC
and from galaxies to the volumeaveraged fDSC 
Despite all these uncertainties we regards our result as
a robust one The details of the galaxy formation models
are immaterial in this test as long as the model gives a
plausible population of massive galaxies at z  1 and
describes correctly the merging of galaxies driven by the
hierarchical assembly of DM halos
In our calculation
the evolution to z  0 can only be underestimated since
it is performed by forcing a complete quenching of cool-
ing and star formation This is clearly seen in Fig 2
where the population of galaxies with M  1011 M is
underestimated at z  0 As a consequence the evolu-
tion predicted by mergers is an underestimate as well
as it does not include the stars formed since z  1 In
this case the known excess of small galaxies predicted at
z  1 Fontana et al 2006 gives a modest bias which
is in the opposite direction with respect of the more im-
portant bias obtained by quenching any evolution of the
stellar component Therefore it does not hamper by any
means our conclusions
In conclusion we have shown that the modest evolu-
tion of the high-mass end of the stellar mass function may
highlight a problem for current models of galaxy forma-
tion in the CDM framework On the other hand the
presence of a signicant DSC in galaxy clusters and the
mild evolution of the high end of the galaxy stellar mass
function may both point toward a scenario in which a sig-
nicant fraction of the stellar mass of galaxies becomes
unbound at each merging event thereby suppressing the
mergerdriven evolution Solving this problem requires
that a signicant fraction  20 of the total stellar
budget in rich galaxy clusters must be in the form of a
diuse component Deeper searches of intracluster light
are necessary to either conrm or dispute this prediction
Future instruments like the Large Binocular Camera at
LBT or JWST will provide a quantum leap in the census
of the diuse stars in the near future

the relative points given in Fig 2 We consider these points as
lower limits see text
same time reproduce the observed fraction of DSC The
rather extreme value of fscatter  08 instead tends to
over-produce the DSC
From these results we conclude that the observed mod-
est evolution of the high-mass tail of the stellar mass
function can be reconciled with model predictions by al-
lowing a signicant fraction of the stellar mass to be scat-
tered away from the galaxies and disperse into the DM
halo This is shown also in Fig 3 where the results of the
models are reported in the fDSC -  log M45 plane as
lower limits to the values that would be obtained with a
full treatment of baryon physics The shaded area shows
the region currently allowed by data As a word of cau-
tion we remind that a direct comparison between the
theoretical and observational estimates of the DSC frac-
tion is quite delicate Theoretical estimates are aected
by numerical eects and by uncertainties in the model-
ing of complex baryon physics that give rise to galaxies
