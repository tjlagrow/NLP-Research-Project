ABSTRACT
We present an investigation of the relationships between the radio properties of
a giant radio galaxy MRC B0319-454 and the surrounding galaxy distribution
with the aim of examining the inuence of intergalactic gas and gravity associated
with the large-scale structure on the evolution in the radio morphology Our new
radio continuum observations of the radio source with high surface brightness
sensitivity images the asymmetries in the megaparsec-scale radio structure in
total intensity and polarization We compare these with the 3-D galaxy distribu-
tion derived from galaxy redshift surveys Galaxy density gradients are observed
along and perpendicular to the radio axis the large-scale structure is consis-
tent with a model wherein the galaxies trace the ambient intergalactic gas and
the evolution of the radio structures are ram-pressure limited by this associated
gas Additionally we have modeled the o-axis evolution of the south-west radio
lobe as deection of a buoyant jet backow by a transverse gravitational eld
the model is plausible if entrainment is small The case study presented here is
a demonstration that giant radio galaxies may be useful probes of the warm-
hot intergalactic medium believed to be associated with moderately over dense
galaxy distributions

INTRODUCTION
In a powerful radio galaxy reaccelerated jet material
inates the synchrotron lobes after passage through
the termination shocks at the jet ends Scheuer 1974
Begelman et al 1984 The synchrotron lobes interact
with the surrounding thermal gas and their morpholo-
gies are a result of this interaction In cluster environ-
ments where XMM-Newton and Chandra have been
able to detect and image the relatively dense intra-
cluster medium ICM in X-rays the total
intensity
radio and X-ray contours follow each other and X-
ray holes are observed at the locations of the radio
lobes eg Boehringer et al 1993 McNamara et al 2000
Nulsen et al 2002 Brzan et al 2004 These holes are
evidence that the expanding radio lobes interact with
and displace the X-ray emitting gas Lobe interaction
with intra-cluster gas is also apparent in the bending of

radio plumes in wide-angle and narrow-angle tailed radio
sources eg Bliton et al 1998 Hardcastle et al 2005
Douglass et al 2008 The morphologies of these sources
suggest that the radio tails are deected behind the mov-
ing host galaxy due to the ram-pressure exerted by the
Giant radio galaxies which have linear sizes of
 1 Mpc tend to reside outside of rich clusters
Jamrozy et al 2004 Their giant lobes which extend
well beyond the interstellar media ISM and coronal ha-
los of their host galaxies represent the interaction be-
tween the light synchrotron lobe plasma and the heav-
ier intergalactic medium IGM If galaxies are a reliable
tracer of the IGM gas then we expect the distribution of
gas around a giant radio galaxy to depend on the posi-
tion of the host galaxy relative to large-scale structure in
the IGM Since the evolution of the radio lobes depends
on their interaction with this ambient gas large scale
structure and the associated gas is also expected to de-
termine the lobe dynamics in giant radio sources For ex-

ample if the parent optical galaxy resides at a boundary
between an over-density and a void then there may be a
gradient in the gas density surrounding the radio source
If this gradient is aligned with the radio jet axis then we
would expect an asymmetry to arise in the lobe lengths
due to diering ram-pressure limitations in the ambient
gas on the two sides If on the other hand the gradient
in the gas density is transverse to the jet axis then we
would expect the light synchrotron lobes to evolve trans-
verse to the jet axis and in the direction of decreasing
ambient density and pressure due to buoyancy
The diuse gas in the environs of giant radio galaxies
outside of rich clusters most likely pertains to the warm-
hot phase of the IGM whose existence at low-redshifts
has been predicted by large-scale cosmological hydrody-
namical simulations of galaxy formation Cen  Ostriker
1999 2006 Dave et al 2001 In the simulations the
warm-hot gas follows the lamentary galaxy distribution
on large scales and represents unvirialized over-densities
in the range 10-30 Little is known about this warm-
hot gas since its thermal emission is not detectable by
present day X-ray telescopes However the shape taken
by the lobes of a giant radio galaxy is a visible manifesta-
tion of their interaction with the surrounding gas These
galaxies therefore make ideal probes of the unseen am-
bient medium which may be the warm-hot intergalactic
medium WHIM
Recently the 18 Mpc lobes of the giant radio galaxy
MSH 0522 were used to constrain the properties of its
ambient thermal gas Subrahmanyan et al 2008 The
lobes in this galaxy appear to be relicts and there is an
observed asymmetry which appears to be related to an
anisotropy in the local galaxy distribution A comparison
of the properties of the radio lobes and those of the ambi-
ent gas which were derived from the surrounding galaxy
distribution indicated that the lobes were highly over-
pressured despite their relict appearance Alternatively
the density-temperature product for the ambient IGM
might be an order of magnitude larger than that pre-
dicted by structure formation models indicating signi-
cant feedback in the IGM
In this paper we present a similar study of another
giant radio galaxy MRC B0319454 also referred to
previously as MSH 0343 and PMN J03214510 and
its environment The 25 Mpc radio source is located
within a galaxy lament of the Horologium-Reticulum
super-cluster Fleenor et al 2005 at a redshift of z 
06 Its 26size on the sky make the measurement of
the surrounding galaxy distribution possible with multi-
object bre instruments such as AAOmega on the Anglo-
Australian Telescope MRC B0319454 therefore pro-
vides a further opportunity to study the morphology of a
giant radio galaxy and its relationship to the surrounding
galaxy distribution Such studies are a rst step in using
giant radio galaxies as probes of the unseen intergalactic
gas associated with large-scale galaxy structures
The giant radio source MRC B0319454 was pre-
viously observed at 843-MHz with the Molonglo Obser-
vatory Synthesis Telescope MOST and with the Aus-
tralia Telescope Compact Array ATCA at 20 13 and 6
cm Jones 1989 Saripalli et al 1994 In the latter work
Saripalli et al presented a detailed study of the mor-
phology of the giant radio galaxy pointing out a num-
ber of features that make the radio source unusual a
unique conguration of ve compact hot spots in one of
the lobes a prominent jet and counter-jet detected out
to exceptional distances and lobes that are asymmetri-
cally shaped and positioned about the core Considering
the likely expansion velocity of the source it was argued
that light travel-time eects were not responsible for the
asymmetry in the lobe separations from the core Based
on an examination of the projected galaxy distribution
around the host Saripalli et al attributed this feature to
corresponding asymmetries in the ambient intergalactic
medium
Given the Mpc size and pronounced asymmetries
in the radio morphology MRC B0319454 is an excel-
lent example of a radio galaxy where the morphology is
shaped by the IGM In this paper we examine the inter-
action between the lobes and the ambient IGM using our
new radio observations made with the specic purpose
of imaging the radio lobes fully Our new improved ra-
dio images of MRC B0319454 have been made using an
observing mode designed to have high surface brightness
sensitivity and in full polarization We use these in con-
junction with redshift measurements of the surrounding
galaxy distribution in an attempt to model the inter-
action between the giant lobes with their IGM environ-
ment Our radio observations include polarization mea-
surements for the rst time
The paper is organized as follows
In Sect 2
we present our new radio continuum images of MRC
B0319454 In Section 3 we describe the galaxy redshift
data in the sections that follow an attempt is made to-
wards understanding the lobe-IGM interaction assuming
that the galaxy distribution traces the gas distribution
on large scales Throughout we adopt a at cosmology
with parameters 0  03   07 and a Hubble con-
stant H0  71 km s1 Mpc1 The host elliptical galaxy
ESO 248-G10 also cataloged as AM 0319452 has an
R-band absolute magnitude MR  237 Saripalli et al
1994 Previously the redshift of the host was estimated
to be z  00633 Jones 1989 our new data presented
herein give an estimate of z  00622 At this redshift

2 RADIO CONTINUUM IMAGING
New radio continuum observations of MRC B0319454
were made with the ATCA during the period 2003
September to 2004 April These were aimed at accu-
rately imaging the extended total intensity and polar-
ization structures in the 26 source in the 20 and 13 cm
bands Earth-rotation synthesis with full UV coverage
were made in 5 separate array congurations that em-
phasized low spatial frequencies 15D and 15A 15-
km arrays a 750B 750-m array a EW352 352-m ar-
ray and a compact EW214 214-m array The relatively
compact congurations were for improving sensitivity to
the low surface brightness structures while the relatively
longer 15-km arrays were to enable imaging with sub-
arcminute resolution Visibilities were measured simulta-
neously in two bands 128-MHz wide centered at 1378
ccid13 2002 RAS MNRAS 000 114
MRC B0319454 Probing large-scale structure
and 2368 MHz The continuum bands were covered in
13 independent channels A journal of the observations is
in Table 1 The ATCA antennas have primary beam full
width half maximum FWHM of about 35 and 21 re-
spectively in the 20 and 13 cm bands Therefore to accu-
rately image the extended emission in this 26source we
adopted the approach of mosaic observing and covered
the double radio source with 8 separate pointings in a
4  2 grid A grid spacing of about 10 which is approxi-
mately equal to the sky plane Nyquist sampling require-
ment for observing in the 13 cm band was adopted for
the pointings
Data at both frequencies were reduced using stan-
dard procedures in the MIRIAD package The ux-
density scale was set using observations of the primary
calibrator PKS B1934638 whose ux density was
adopted to be 149 and 116 Jy respectively at 1378 and
2368 MHz Antenna complex gains were initially cali-
brated using data recorded during the frequent observa-
tions of the nearby secondary calibrator PKS B0332403
The brightnest component in the double radio source at
the observing frequencies is the SW hot spot The visi-
bility data corresponding to the single pointing centered
near this bright hot spot was initially imaged and these
visibilities were iteratively self-calibrated subsequently
these self-calibration gain corrections were applied to all
the pointing data At 1378 MHz several rounds of phase-
only self calibration were applied followed by one round
of amplitude and phase self-calibration At 2368 MHz
only one round of phase-only self-calibration was applied
further rounds did not noticeably alter the image Im-
ages of all individual pointings at 1378 and 2368 MHz
were deconvolved using the Clark clean algorithm The
deconvolved images were smoothed to a common resolu-
tion and then combined in a linear mosaic process using
the MIRIAD routine LINMOS The primary beam atten-
uation over the entire mosaic image was corrected during
the computation of the linear mosaic
The nal image output by LINMOS was made as
a weighted merge of individual pointing images which
had been individually deconvolved therefore the result-
ing mosaic image is not a true mosaic but what is usually
referred to as a cut-and-paste mosaic A true joint mo-
saicing algorithm could potentially image extended struc-
tures on scales that are larger than the primary beam of
individual antennas and comparable to the mosaic area
However such joint-mosaicing is dynamic range limited
owing to uncertainties in the primary beam at low levels
well o the axis this limitation is relevant while imag-
ing large elds containing bright emission peaks as is
the case here for MRC B0319454 since the source has a
bright hot spot We have not adopted a true joint mosaic-
ing approach for this reason Nevertheless we note that
the largest angular scales expected to be reliably repro-
duced by the cut-and-paste mosaic are adequate because
the angular scales of the largest emission structures are
expected to be less than the primary beam FWHM

1378 MHz radio continuum
The mosaic image of MRC B0319454 at 1378 MHz is
shown in Fig 1 The image was made with a beam of
FWHM 52 40 at a position angle of 0 The rms noise
in the image in the vicinity of the radio galaxy is 025 mJy
beam1 The image dynamic range dened as the ratio
of the peak brightness over the entire image to the rms
noise exceeds a 10001 The total intensity image of the
giant radio source shows an edge-brightened double radio
source with two large radio lobes that are located to the
north-east NE and south-west SW of the radio core
whose location is marked in Fig 1 Extended emission
is also detected associated with a partial jet that extends
from the core in the direction of the bright SW hot spot
The jet as in previous MOST and ATCA images is traced
only over a distance of 7 from the core which is about
one-third of the distance between the core and SW hot
spot A weak radio source which is associated with a bJ 
174 spiral galaxy Jones 1989 is located in projection
on the radio axis at the end of the observable SW jet
This object has a redshift of z  007 and its location
on the sky along the path of the SW jet and towards the
end of its visible length is likely a chance coincidence the
galaxy is probably a few tens of Mpc beyond the radio
source
Two broad peaks of enhanced radio emission are lo-
cated adjacent one another and on either side of the ra-
dio axis at the end of the NE lobe The ridge-like peak
on the eastern boundary is elongated parallel to the ra-
dio axis extends further from the core relative to the
neighbouring peak located on the western boundary and
is also slightly brighter than the second peak It may
be noted here that higher resolution images of this lobe
Saripalli et al 1994 resolve the ridge along the east-
ern boundary into a chain of hot spots and suggest that
the NE jet currently terminates at a recessed hot spot
located in-between the two broad peaks seen in Fig 1
The post-hot spot lobe material in this NE lobe appears
to be distributed along the radio axis The radio core
component coincident with the host galaxy appears to
be enveloped by this lobe plasma at least in projection
Our new ATCA mosaic image at 1378 MHz with higher
sensitivity to extended emission compared to previous
images reveals low surface-brightness and extended lobe
material in the vicinity of the radio core The boundary
of lobe plasma in parts of the NE lobe close to the core is
not sharp the wider spacing in the logarithmic radio con-
tours along the NW and SE boundaries indicate a relaxed
state for this lobe material Additionally the distribution
of this cocoon plasma close to the core is not symmetric
about the radio axis the lobe is more extended on the
NW side
The SW radio lobe is markedly dierent in its radio
structure compared to the NE lobe The SW lobe is dom-
inated by a bright hot spot which protrudes from the end
of a low surface brightness lobe There is a large emission
gap between the SW lobe and the core A secondary peak
of enhanced emission also noted in previous MOST and
ATCA images is observed on the eastern boundary of
this SW lobe and recessed from the bright hot spot this
may be the site of a past hot spot or the site where the
Safouris Subrahmanyan Bicknell  Saripalli
current jet bends before terminating at the bright hot
The expansion and movement of the post-hot spot
plasma in this SW lobe is extremely asymmetric about
the source axis the ow appears directed to the NW
and perpendicular to the radio axis Our new 1378-MHz
ATCA mosaic image clearly reveals an extension to the
low surface brightness cocoon material perpendicular to
the radio axis and in the NW direction The boundary
of the SW lobe appears to be relatively sharply bounded
along the SE Towards the NW although the boundaries
of the extended emission appear to be dened the lobe
surface brightness fades away more gradually into the
plume-like extension
The 26 angular size corresponds to a projected lin-
ear size of 19 Mpc We measure the total ux den-
sity at 1378 MHz to be 386 Jy for the giant radio
galaxy which is in close agreement with the 1472-MHz
ux density measurement in Saripalli et al 1994 The
implied radio power is 4  1025 W Hz1 Consider-
ing the absolute R-band magnitude of the host galaxy
MR  237 Saripalli et al 1994 MRC B0319454
is placed slightly below the FR IFR II dividing line
and in a region populated by FR I objects in the dis-
tribution in Ledlow  Owen 1996 However it is rel-
atively common for giant sources with FR II mor-
phologies to have radio powers near the FR IFR II
transition Ishwara-Chandra  Saikia 1999 Also MRC
B0319454 is a high excitation radio galaxy  an optical
spectrum of the host galaxy shows strong narrow emis-
sion lines Bryant  Hunstead 2000 The host galaxies
of FR-II radio sources tend to have high excitation lines
in their optical spectra Hardcastle et al 2007 in this
respect the emission line properties of MRC B0319454
are consistent with its morphological classication as an
FR-II radio galaxy
22 2368 MHz radio continuum
Our new 2368 MHz ATCA mosaic image of MRC
B0319454 is shown in Fig 2 The image was made with
a beam FWHM of 32  25 at a position angle of 0
The rms noise on the image in the vicinity of the giant
radio galaxy is 015 mJy beam1 and the image dynamic
range exceeds 10001 We measure the total ux density
at 2368 MHz to be 246 Jy This is notably higher than
the corresponding ux density measurement of 204 Jy in
Saripalli et al 1994 and implying that the earlier 13-cm
band ATCA image may have missed a signicant fraction
of the radio emission
We nd good agreement between the previous and
new ATCA images made in the 13-cm band Notably
both show the same multiple hot spot complex at the
end of the NE lobe Our lower resolution image reveals
4 peaks at the lobe end see the inset in Fig 2 The
brightest and most compact of these is located at the very
tip of the lobe and in projection is seen to protrude from
the lobe end Additionally as would be expected from the
increased total ux density in the new images our 13-cm
band image presented here recovers some of the extended
low-surface-brightness lobe emission in the vicinity of the
radio core which was not detected in the previous 13-cm
ATCA image
The extended structure of the giant radio galaxy as
observed in the 13-cm band image compares well with
that in the 20-cm band image however the lowest sur-
face brightness features seen in the 20-cm band image
are barely imaged at 13 cm For example a slight are in
the lowest contour along the NW edge of the NE lobe is
observed in our 13-cm band image the asymmetry in the
NE lobe in the vicinity of the core is not as prominent in
the 13-cm band compared to the 20-cm band The 13-cm
band image also hints at the extension of low-surface-
brightness material in the SW lobe towards NW once
again although this faint material is reliably detected in
the 20-cm band image it is relatively fainter at 13-cm
23 Polarization and rotation measure
Polarization images at 1378 and 2368 MHz were con-
structed from CLEANed Stokes I Q and U images made
with a beam of FWHM 52  40 at a PA of 0 The
polarization position angle images at the two frequencies
were used to compute the distribution of rotation mea-
sure RM over the giant radio source Since the dier-
ence in the orientations of the polarization vectors at 1378
and 2368 MHz is observed to be small we have assumed
that our RM estimates do not suer from n ambigui-
ties The computed magnitudes of RM are small over the
entire source mean RM is 0 rad m2 and the 1- scatter
is less than 7 rad m2 It may also be noted here that
our low RM values are consistent with those expected
for this line of sight through the Galaxy in the analysis
of Simard-Normandin  Kronberg 1980 Additionally
within the errors we do not observe any signicant gra-
dients in the RM distribution across the source
The distribution in the 1378 MHz polarized intensity
is shown in Fig 3 Overlaid are vectors showing the ob-
served orientations of the projected electric eld E-eld
with bar lengths proportional to the fractional polariza-
tion The small scatter in RM over the source implies that
the intrinsic position angles of the electric eld are within
about 10 of the observed angles The polarized intensity
image shows that there are two regions of relatively in-
tense polarized emission at the end of the NE lobe which
coincide with the broad peaks in total intensity The frac-
tional polarization in these regions is about 20 at our
resolution A narrow channel of low polarized intensity
and low fractional polarization runs between the two re-
gions Along this channel the polarization vectors sharply
change in position angle therefore the channel is likely
a result of beam depolarization Haverkorn et al 2000
Another channel of low polarization is observed along the
radio axis in the region mid-way between the radio core
and the end of the NE lobe To each side of this channel
there are two rails of polarized emission where the frac-
tional polarization is about 20 The projected magnetic
eld lines which are perpendicular to the displayed E-
vectors follow the total intensity contours over most of
the NE lobe excepting the central parts The magnetic
eld is circumferentially oriented along all of the bound-
aries at the far end of the NE lobe as well as along the
ccid13 2002 RAS MNRAS 000 114
MRC B0319454 Probing large-scale structure
edges of the lobe close to the core component where en-
hancement in the fractional polarization is also observed
The distribution of polarized emission over the SW
lobe is very similar to the total intensity radio structure
There is a bright peak in polarized emission at the loca-
tion of the bright hot spot and there are weaker peaks
in polarized intensity recessed from the hot spot Over
the extended low surface brightness regions of the SW
lobe the distribution of polarized emission is fairly uni-
form and the fractional polarization is about 15 The
fractional polarization is enhanced at the total intensity
hot spot as well as at the lobe boundaries The fractional
polarization values are particularly high and in the range
30-50 along the eastern and SW edges We have col-
lapsed our image in fractional polarization of the low-
surface-brightness SW lobeexcluding the hot spot
along a direction perpendicular to the source axis The
resulting prole Fig 4 shows that the fractional polar-
ization is enhanced at the SE end has a shallow minimum
in the central regions of the lobe then increases towards
the NW However there is a second dip in the fractional
polarization at the base of the extension observed in this
lobe towards NW and within the extension the fractional
polarization values increase again to about 30 at the
We have computed the average depolarization ratio
DR a ratio of the fractional polarization at 1378 MHz
to that at 2368 MHz over dierent regions of the giant
source The ratio is about 10 at the bright ends of the
NE and SW lobes In the NE lobe the depolarization
ratio is about 09 in the central regions of the lobe away
from the hot spots and decreases to 075 in the vicinity of
the radio core In the SW lobe the depolarization ratio
is  1 and fairly constant over the low surface brightness
regions with the exception of the NW extension where
the mean depolarization ratio is around 06
24 Spectral index
We have collated radio ux density measurements for the
giant radio source from the literature and these are tab-
ulated in Table 2 The value at 408 MHz was computed
from the 408-MHz all sky survey of Haslam et al 1982
the quoted error reects the uncertainty in the foreground
subtraction The total spectrum for the entire source is a
power law with spectral index   084 over the range
408 MHz  4850 MHz the spectral index  is dened us-
ing the relation S    The total spectra for the NE
and SW lobes appear straight over the frequency range
8434850 MHz where separate ux density estimates are
available for the two lobes with   076 for the SW
and   086 for the NE lobe We note that the 843-
MHz ux density for the SW lobe Jones 1989 is similar
to the 1378 MHz value derived from our image it is likely
that the MOST measurement is missing ux density At
lower frequencies 80 - 160 MHz we only have measure-
ments of the ux density in the NE lobe These are below
the extrapolation of the high frequency power-law spec-
trum The measurements indicate that the NE lobe has
a attening of the spectral index below 408 MHz how-
ever it is possible that the low frequency MSH values
ccid13 2002 RAS MNRAS 000 114
are erroneous Mills et al 1960 note that the 80-MHz
measurement is aected by sidelobes
We have computed the spectral index distribution
over the giant radio source between 1378 and 2368 MHz
using images with beams of FWHM 52  40 at PA
of 0 The resulting image is shown in Fig 5 the image
has been blanked where the pixel values in the individual
images are less than 4 times the rms noise
The distribution in spectral index shows a steepening
of the spectral index along the axis and towards the core
in the case of the NE lobe and in a direction transverse
to the source axis and towards NW in the case of the SW
lobe In both cases the steepening is along the axes of
the lobes If we assume that older parts of the lobes have
steeper spectra as a consequence of spectral aging then
the observed spectral gradients suggest a backow in the
NE lobe from the hotspots towards the core and a trans-
verse ow o axis in the case of the SW lobe We have
made proles of these observed spectral index gradients
by collapsing the spectral index distribution image of the
NE lobe perpendicular to the source axis and that of
the SW lobe along the source axis The prole along the
NE lobe Fig 6 shows that the spectral index smoothly
steepens along the length of the lobe from the bright end
towards the core The prole in the SW lobe Fig 7
shows an abrupt change in spectral index between the
bulk of the SW lobe and the extension towards NW a
step in the spectral index is observed between these two
features The mean spectral index preceding the step is
07 in the extension the mean value is 13
3 THE HOST GALAXY AND ITS
ENVIRONMENT
The host galaxy ESO 248-G10
is a luminous gi-
ant elliptical galaxy with a warped central dust lane
Saripalli et al 1994 Images of the parent galaxy at op-
tical and near-infrared wavelengths are consistent with a
model in which the host elliptical is triaxial with the ra-
dio axis along the minor axis Bryant  Hunstead 2000
Based on the orientation of the dust-lane Bryant et al
argue that the radio jet axis makes an angle of 65 to the
line of sight the jet to the NE is pointed away from us
where as the SW jet is towards us
In the following sections we present our 2dF spec-
troscopy of objects in the neighbourhood of the host and
use these along with archival 6dF data to infer the dis-
tribution of galaxies and large-scale structure in the en-
vironment of the giant radio source
2 eld multi-bre spectroscopy
We obtained optical spectra of objects in the vicinity of
MRC B0319454 using the AAOmega instrument on the
Anglo-Australian Telescope AAT and its predecessor
the Two degree Field 2dF instrument The 2dF facility
is a multi-object spectrograph located at the prime fo-
cus of the AAT capable of measuring  400 simultaneous
spectra within a 2-diameter eld in a single observation
Lewis et al 2002 The AAOmega instrument which is
the successor to 2dF is a dual-beam blue and red arm
Safouris Subrahmanyan Bicknell  Saripalli
bench-mounted spectrograph that uses the 2dF bre po-
sitioner at the prime focus It provides greater through-
put stability and resolution than the decomissioned 2dF
spectrographs
Our targets for the multi-bre spectroscopy were
galaxies with bJ magnitudes in the range of 150195
selected from the SuperCOSMOS catalogue within a 2-
degree eld around the host galaxy The selection was re-
stricted to those objects identied to be galaxies and not
stars in the catalogue A total of 1033 candidate galaxies
were identied in the chosen magnitude range However
approximately 200 objects in the resulting target list were
previously observed in a 2dF survey of the Horologium-
Reticulum supercluster which fortuitously covered a
space-volume including MRC B0319454 Klamer et al
2004 We retained about 20 of these objects in our target
catalogue as a consistency check and omitted reobserv-
ing the others
Two separate eld congurations were prepared for
the robotic bre positioner using the CONFIGURE rou-
tine that is part of the 2dF user software For this alloca-
tion exercise we gave priority to objects with bJ magni-
tudes close to that of the host galaxy Specically objects
with 150  bJ 6 165 were assigned the highest prior-
ity of 9 Decreasing priorities were given to objects in
progressively fainter magnitude ranges 165  bJ 6 175
priority 8 175  bJ 6 185 priority 7 and 185 
bJ 6 195 priority 6 The CONFIGURE routine was
also used to allocate approximately 20 bres to blank
sky and 4 guide bres to stars Locations of these objects
were conrmed by examining SuperCOSMOS digitized
sky survey images
One of our two 2dF eld allocations was observed
on the AAT during service time on 2003 November 26
Three exposures of 30 min each were obtained on the rst
eld using the 300B grating centred at 5800A Observa-
tions covered a wavelength range of 36008000A with a
spectral resolution of 9A FWHM Unfortunately our sec-
ond allocation could not be observed on the same night
although it had been scheduled due to a eld rotation
problem on the second eld plate The second 2dF eld
conguration was observed with AAOmega on 2006 Jan-
uary 20 as part of the AAOmega Science Verication pro-
gram Four separate 20 min exposures were taken with
the 580V and 385R volume-phase holographic gratings in
the blue and red arms respectively These yielded spectra
spanning a broader wavelength range of 37008800A with
a resolution of R  1300 in separate but overlapping
blue and red halves
2dF data were calibrated using the standard pipeline
reduction package 2dFDR a new upgraded version of
2dFDR for use with AAOmega was used for the 2006
January observation Optical redshifts were determined
for each object using the RUNZ software Fits to tem-
plates containing typical spectral features were visual-
ized in some cases the result of automated tting was
clearly incorrect usually because of residual sky lines
and in such cases we forced the t to emission line or ab-
sorption features that we considered to be real Approxi-
mately 74 of observed objects in our list were assigned
a reliable galaxy redshift 13 were deemed to be stars
and the remaining 13 objects were considered to have
unreliable redshift estimates
We have supplemented our measured redshifts with
those from the 6dF Galaxy Redshift 6dFGS survey
Jones et al 2004 2005 and redshifts from the previ-
ous 2dF observation of the Horologium-Reticulum super-
cluster giving a total of 664 galaxy redshifts 92 stellar
redshifts and 85 unreliable redshifts The remaining 193
objects of the original target list of 1033 objects were not
allocated to a bre in either of the 2dF AAOmega or
6dF observations Our completeness over the 2 eld is

32 The galaxy distribution in the vicinity of
the radio source
The redshift distribution of the galaxies with reliable
redshifts over the range z  005 - 010 is shown in
Fig 8 The host galaxy which has a measured redshift
of z  00622 lies in a relatively small concentration of
galaxies that are distributed in the range 00600066 in
redshift space A much larger clustering of galaxies is ob-
served at higher redshifts and in the range z  0066 -
0084 The sky distribution of galaxies in the two con-
centrations is shown in Fig 9 The contours in the plot
show the location of the radio galaxy and the open circles
denote the positions of known galaxy clusters within the
eld these are S0345 A3111 A3112 and APMCC 369
and their redshifts are z  0071 0078 0075 and 0075
respectively Fleenor et al 2006 Filled circles mark the
locations of galaxies that are within 0004 of the host
redshift all the galaxies in the redshift space concen-
tration containing the host small crosses mark the sky
positions of galaxies in the larger concentration in the
higher redshift range In both redshift ranges there ap-
pears to be a decit of galaxies to the NE side of the
radio source
In order to identify galaxy concentrations includ-
ing any that might be associated with the host ESO
248-G10 we applied the Huchra  Geller 1982 friends-
of-friends group nding algorithm to our galaxy redshift
dataset In this technique association is determined by
the projected spatial and velocity separations between
individual galaxies In particular a galaxy is a friend of
another galaxy if it is within a limiting projected dis-
tance DL of that galaxy and if the magnitude of the ve-
locity dierence between the two galaxies is less than VL
Large values of DL and VL result in most of the galax-
ies included into large associations comprising multiple
groups strung out in velocity space Very small values re-
sult in the identication of tight groups and sub-groups
with most galaxies excluded from the associations We
explored a range of parameters systematically reducing
the parameter space from DL  4 Mpc and VL  1000
km s1 until the identied groups appeared as compact
separate features in plots of RA versus declination RA
versus velocity and declination versus velocity The cho-
sen values DL  1 Mpc and VL  400 km s1 resulted
in the identication of the galaxy concentrations shown
in Fig 10 For clarity isolated galaxies and groups with
less than 5 members are not plotted in this gure The

host of the radio source is in a concentration with seven
identied members Two of the members appear close to-
gether in SuperCOSMOS optical images of the eld and
there is a third galaxy of unknown redshift also located
within 10 arcseconds of one of these on the R-band image
A second concentration also consisting of seven identi-
ed members in our redshift database is located about
40 to the SW of the concentration around the host and
at a similar redshift All other concentrations identied
by our friends-of-friends algorithm are oset from these
two in velocity space by  2000 km s1 It is interesting
to note that all the identied galaxy concentrations are
located towards the SW side of the 2 eld only isolated
galaxies occupy the sky region to the NE
The host galaxy with apparent magnitude bJ 
1610 appears to lie close to the centre of the associated
concentration on the sky The host galaxy is the bright-
est member of this concentration the second brightest
galaxy has a magnitude bJ  1625 and the other mem-
bers are fainter than bJ  172 The concentration is dis-
tributed over a projected linear extent of about 1 Mpc
on the sky indicating that this might be a loose group
We measure a velocity dispersion of 196 km s1 for the
galaxies identied with this concentration and also note
that the host lies close to the centre of the distribution
in velocity space The concentration to the SW is dis-
tributed over a larger sky area and has a larger velocity
dispersion   272 km s1 and has a mean velocity
that is 290 km s1 higher than that of the concentration
around the host We have examined the ROSAT All Sky
Survey archival data at the location of the 2 eld and
do not nd any X-ray emission associated with the host
grouping or with the neighbouring grouping to the SW
However there is low surface brightness extended emis-
sion coincident with the position of the distant z  0071
Abell cluster S0345
We have computed the 3-D spatial distribution of
galaxy number density in the vicinity of the giant radio
galaxy In this anaylsis we included all galaxies within a
box of dimensions 6 Mpc  6 Mpc  25 Mpc which in-
cluded the two concentrations of galaxies in the redshift
range 00600066 Galaxies within 07 in RA and
declination and with redshift osets within 00022 
z  00038 of the host galaxy were included in the box
We neglected peculiar velocities and assigned distances
along the line of sight based on galaxy redshifts In or-
der to compute the galaxy over-density we smoothed the
data using a top-hat function with smoothing radius 125
Mpc At this smoothing scale the mean number density
of galaxies is 03 and the rms number density is 22 Fig-
ure 11 shows the fractional over-densities nn in a
sky plane at the redshift of the host The fractional over-
density at the location of the host is 124 The peak frac-
tional over-density within the cube is 158 and is at an
oset position with respect to the host galaxy of 17
in RA 25 in declination and 38 Mpc along the line
of sight this position is within the location of the galaxy
concentration to the SW Fractional over-density values
in the sky plane containing the peak is also shown as a
separate panel in Fig 11 All pixel locations with nn
exceeding 6 within the cube are either associated with
the host group or with the SW group
ccid13 2002 RAS MNRAS 000 114
The jets in MRC B0319454 make an angle of 65
to the line of sight with the NE jet pointed away from
us We have examined the fractional over-density values
in the box with smoothing radius 125 Mpc along the
inferred axis of the giant radio source nn is fairly
constant over the region of the NE lobe and the value of
nn somewhat exceeds 10 The SW lobe is located out-
side the extent of the concentration with which the host
galaxy is associated and obviously lies in a region of sig-
nicantly lower galaxy number density the galaxy over-
density within the cube decreases along the path length
of the SW jet and has values as low as nn  2 in the
vicinity of the SW hot spot If the galaxies are a tracer of
gas the local galaxy distribution constitutes evidence for
an asymmetry in the gas density on the two sides of the
host additionally the distribution is evidence for a den-
sity gradient in the ambient medium of the radio galaxy
between the radio core and the SW hot spot
We have also computed the gravitational eld in
the vicinity of the radio galaxy following the method
described by Subrahmanyan et al 2008 Again pecu-
liar galaxy velocities have been ignored in this compu-
tation and distances to galaxies along the line of sight
are based on redshift values only First we estimated the
total mass in the cube as the product of the box vol-
ume V  and mean matter density in the Universe m
Assuming that the galaxies trace this matter an average
mass Mg  V  mNg was assigned to each galaxy
where Ng  37 is the total number of galaxies in the
cube This resulted in a mass of Mg  20  1011M as-
sociated with each galaxy The acceleration vector at any
location within the cube was then computed by summing
the contribution from each Mg point mass Nearby galax-
ies were excluded from the sum so that the computed
gravitational eld is that due to surrounding large-scale
galaxy structures and not individual objects Galaxies
outside of the cube were also ignored The resultant ac-
celeration vector at the location of the host has compo-
nents gRA  12  1013 m s2 gDEC  47  1014
m s2 and gz  14  1013 m s2 The magnitude of
this acceleration vector is gs  19  1013 m s2 and
the component on the sky plane is directed NW at a
PA of 68 Assuming the age of the Universe to be
  137 Gyr the acceleration corresponds to a veloc-
ity of gs  82 km s1 Within the extent of the group
the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration increases
with distance from the host and takes on values about a
factor of two greater than that at the location of the host
galaxy outside the group the acceleration declines with
distance from the group Within a radius of about 1 Mpc
of the host galaxy the acceleration appears to be dom-
inated by the mass associated with the group of which
the host is a member At the location of the SW lobe the
vector components are much smaller gRA  29  1014
m s2 gDEC  64  1015 m s2 and gz  50  1014
m s2 this corresponds to a velocity of gs  25 km s1
and is roughly directed towards the concentration asso-
ciated with the host galaxy At the location of the SW
hot spot and lobe the gravity is not dominated by the
second galaxy concentration to the SW

33 The large-scale structure in the
neighbourhood of the radio source
We have used archival data from the 6dFGS to in-
fer the distribution of galaxies in the vicinity of MRC
B0319454 on larger scales We computed the 3-D spatial
distribution of galaxy number density using 6dF galax-
ies within a cube of side 85 Mpc centred at the host A
total of 860 galaxies within 10 deg in RA and declina-
tion and within 001 of the redshift of the host galaxy
were included in this analysis In order to compute the
galaxy over-density we have smoothed the data using a
top-hat function with radius 6 Mpc At this smoothing
scale the mean number density of galaxies in the cube
is 12 and the rms is 15 Figure 12 shows the fractional
over-densities nn in the sky plane at the redshift of
the host galaxy At the location of the host the fractional
over-density is 39 with this smoothing scale This plot
shows that the host appears to be embedded within a
large-scale galaxy lament that is oriented in a NNE -
SSW direction The lament extends more than 60 Mpc
in our plot and has a projected width of approximately
15 Mpc which is the width between points with frac-
tional overdensity of two at this smoothing scale Frac-
tional over-density values in front of and behind the host
galaxy reveal that the lament has an apparent depth
of only 8 Mpc along the line of sight However the real
physical size in redshift space is likely to be larger than
this because of the Kaiser eect in this lament that has
a low fractional overdensity there may be an apparent
compression in the distribution of measured velocities due
to the infall in comoving space of galaxies towards the
lament centre along the line of sight Kaiser 1987 In
addition the lament is observed to bend away from us
in the northern parts of the cube and conversely bend
and extend towards us in the southern parts Within the
galaxy lament the fractional over-density takes on val-
ues up to about 9 with this smoothing scale The host
galaxy is oset from the centre of the lament in red-
shift space by approximately 15 Mpc towards us The
total extent of the radio sourceabout 19sin65 Mpc
 21 Mpcis much smaller than the width of this large-
scale lament of galaxies and the entire radio source in-
cluding the galaxy concentration associated with the host
galaxy are embedded within and located in the central
parts of the lament As projected on the sky the radio
jets are roughly in a direction parallel to the large-scale
lament however the inclination of the radio axis to the
line of sight makes the SW lobe somewhat more distant
from the axis of the large-scale lament
Using an identical technique to that described in
the previous section we have computed the gravitational
eld resulting from the large-scale structure using the
6dF survey galaxies in the 85 Mpc side cube The av-
erage mass assigned to each galaxy in this cube was
Mg  26  1013M In this analysis galaxies within
40 Mpc almost 1 degree of the location at which any ac-
celeration vector was computed were ignored Therefore
the resulting acceleration vector eld is that due to the
large-scale structure and not inuenced by local galaxies
or concentrations The resulting gravitational eld com-
puted on the sky plane at the redshift of the host galaxy
is displayed in Fig 13 the vector lengths represent the
component on the sky plane The vector components at
the location of the host are gRA  19  1013 m s2
gDEC  218  1013 m s2 and gz  512  1013 m s2
The magnitude of the acceleration is gs  59  1013 m
s2 most of which is directed along the line of sight away
from us as would be expected from the inference made
above that the host galaxy lies in front of the axis of the
lament The corresponding velocity is gs  253 km s1
and on the sky plane the acceleration is directed towards
PA of 41 The relatively small acceleration vector at
the location of the radio source is consistent with the
nding that the host galaxy is located embedded within
the lament and not in the peripheral regions
4 EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF THE
GIANT RADIO GALAXY MRC B0319454
The NE lobe in MRC B0319454 is aligned along the
radio axis whereas the SW lobe appears to be extended
in a direction perpendicular to the source axis The con-
trasting shapes and orientations taken by the two lobes
are indicative of two very dierent ow histories The to-
tal intensity structure in the NE lobe is suggestive of a
model in which the jet axis remains fairly steady over
most of its length but has signicant jitter at the end
The broad peak at the northern end of the lobe was prob-
ably the site of past hot spots and the chain of hot spots
along the other eastern rim which protrude past the end
of the lobe the sites of current hot spots Strong and
directed backow is indicated along the source axis and
towards the core which continues beyond the core The
backowing cocoon material appears to bend away from
the source axis and towards NW lling and inating a
relatively relaxed and asymmetric bridge in the vicinity
of the core
The gradual steepening of the spectral index distri-
bution along the length of the NE lobe suggests there
are signicant age gradients along the lobe axis the ra-
dio spectrum is steeper in the vicinity of the radio core
where the aged electron population has had more time
to lose energy via synchrotron emission If the depolar-
ization see Sect 23 is a result of entrainment which is
higher in aged cocoon material then the DR distribution
supports this view
The radio structure in the SW lobe is suggestive of
a dierent ow history There is a large emission gap be-
tween the SW lobe and the radio core and it appears that
the movement of post-shocked plasma is to the NW and
not along the source axis Alternative models in which
the plume-like feature to the NW trace the path of past
jet termination points due to for example jet precession
or models invoking movement of the host galaxy with re-
spect to the ambient IGM in which the jet material is
deposited are unlikely because they would be expected to
manifest as symmetric or inversion symmetric lobe dis-
tortions on the two sides
Enhancements in fractional polarization as well as
an orientation of the B-eld parallel to boundaries may
be interpretated as arising from a compression of a mage-
tized plasma with a tangled eld at locations where the
ccid13 2002 RAS MNRAS 000 114
MRC B0319454 Probing large-scale structure
ow terminates on ram-pressure interaction with ambi-
ent thermal plasma The B-eld orientation is transverse
to the source axis in the bright SW hot spot as might be
expected from the interaction between the jets and am-
bient gas at the termination shock The magnetic eld
lines generally follow the total intensity contours along
the boundaries of the SW lobe indicating that the lobes
are not relaxed but are compressed at the boundaries
where the expansion is ram pressure limited Away from
the hot spot and in the central regions of the SW lobe
the B-eld is oriented along NW-SE indicative of a ow
of the post hot spot material towards NW The enhanced
fractional polarization and circumferential B-eld in the
regions of the SW lobe just before the extension towards
NW manifesting in the intermediate peak in the slice
prole in Fig 4 suggest that the ow is discontinuous
across the SW lobe and that the extension towards NW
might have a separate origin
A model that might be considered is one in which
the post hot spot material inates a lobe at the loca-
tion of the hot spot which subsequently bends by  90
to be directed along the line of sight and then bends
once again into the plane of the sky and towards NW
to form the extension In this picture we would be ob-
serving new plasma that has freshly been accelerated at
the hot spot and old plasma which resides behind or in
front of the new plasma that in projection on the sky
appear to form one continuous structure oriented NW
An argument against such a model is that the total in-
tensity image does not show an enhancement prior to
the extension towards NW Also it is dicult to explain
why the lobe should suddenly bend in this way One pos-
sibility is that the backow is deected by the thermal
gaseous halo associated with the galaxy group of which
the host is a member in the same way that backows
are deected by large angles when they encounter galaxy
halos Kraft et al 2005
The total radio spectrum for the SW lobe is straight
over the frequency range 1378-4850 MHz It attens at
843 MHz but as noted earlier this is probably because
this observation missed some of the ux density Values
of the two point spectral index 22
12cm over the SW lobe
take on values   07 over the bulk of the emission and
steepen to   13 in the lobe extension to the NW We
assume that the observed spectral index of 07 over the
relatively higher surface brightness parts of the SW lobe
represents the injection spectrum and infer that there
is no break over the frequency range 843-4850 MHz in
the spectrum of the radiating electrons that populate the
head and bulk of the SW lobe Therefore any steepen-
ing in the spectrum as a result of radiative aging of the
electron population must occur at frequencies  4850
MHz The SW lobe has a minimum energy magnetic eld
strength Bme  01 nT The equivalent magnetic eld
strength of the cosmic microwave background at the red-
shift of the source is BMB  045 nT therefore particle
aging is dominated by inverse Compton losses due to the
microwave background radiation and not synchrotron ra-
diation This is typically so for giant radio sources which
have large expanded lobes and low equipartition mag-

where t in Myr is the spectral age or time since acceler-
ation We estimate a spectral age t  21  107 yr for the
bulk of the SW lobe The steeper two-point spectral in-
dex with 22
12cm  13 in the extension to the SW lobe
suggests an aged plasma A plausible model for this ex-
tension is that if the injection spectrum had an emission
spectral index   07 the population might have aged
over a time exceeding  4  107 yr while experiencing
continuous injection of reaccelerated electronsresulting
in a spectral break at frequencies  1378 MHzthen un-
dergoing passive aging over a period of at most 3107 yr
5 PROCESSES DRIVING THE LOBE
EVOLUTION
There are a number of physical models that can relate the
observed extended emission structure of the radio source
and the ambient environment The environmental inu-
ence may be in the form of the gravitational eld of the
large-scale distribution of matter and the gas associated
with the large-scale structure We assume here that the
galaxies trace the mass as well as the gas In the following
sub-sections we consider some models that could poten-
tially be relevant to the evolution of the radio structure
We examine their relevance to this case study in an at-
tempt to shed light on the physical processes leading to
the formation of the asymmetries in MRC B0319454
51 Buoyant backows
The morphology of the SW lobe is plume-like directed
NW and moving away from the radio axis We model this
lobe as a backow from the hot spot that is initially di-
rected towards the core but is deected o the source axis
and towards the NW because of buoyancy The buoyant
forces are a result of a gravitational eld whose direction
is transverse to the source axis We have shown previ-
ously that the gravitational eld on local scales is largely
directed towards the host galaxy group and not NW-SE
as we envisage here Nevertheless the direction of the
gravitational acceleration could plausibly be transverse
to the jet axis if the separation in line of sight distance
between the host and SW groups is closer than that in-
ferred by attributing redshifts to distances As noted in
Sect 32 the velocity separation between the two galaxy
concentrations is 290 km s1 However peculiar motions
could contribute signicantly to this velocity dierence
placing them closer in real space than one might infer
from the redshifts alone In this case the gravitational
eld in the vicinity of the SW lobe would be dominated
by both the host and SW galaxy groups and we would
expect the gravitational acceleration vector to be directed
between these two mass concentrations and roughly SE-
Breaks in the emission spectrum due to both syn-

equilibrium denes the pressure and density distribu-
tions heating and sweeping up of the ambient gas by the
expanding radio lobe is neglected A possible in-fall of the
radio source and local environment towards the centre of
the large-scale lament is also ignored since peculiar ve-
locities are unknown We use the following notation 
and ext are the mass densities of the jet backow and
external medium respectively p and pext are the pressures
in the lobe backow and external medium respectively
is the velocity of the backow Rc is the radius of
curvature in the backow and g is the gravitational eld
which causes an hydrostatic pressure gradient in the am-
bient gas We dene a coordinate system such that the
ow is in the x-y-plane with the propagation of the jet
hot spot along the x-axis as visualized in Fig 14 The
velocity of the hot spot vhs and velocity of the backow
vbf  are both in the frame of the host galaxy
Following Worrall et al 1995 and Schatzmann
1978 in more detail the dynamics of a buoyant jet
backow in such a medium are descirbed by Eulers equa-
 vbf  vbf  
where the gravitational eld the external density and
pressure of the hydrostatic are related by
pext
We assume that at each location along the backowing
lobe the lobe plasma is in pressure equilibrium with the
external gas Hence the momentum equations for the
backow become
 vbf  vbf  pext 1
ext 
It therefore follows that the velocity vbf  of the backow
and the radius of curvature Rc are related by
 1 
ext 
We therefore have
for   ext
Let us now consider the various parameters which
enter into equation 6 namely the velocity of the back-
ow the density of the external medium and the density
of the lobe material We have already estimated g in the
vicinity of the radio source see Sect 32 based on the
projected geometry of the SW lobe we estimate the back-
owing SW lobe plasma to have a radius of curvature of
approximately 250 kpc
Recent estimates of the backow velocity in giant
radio galaxies have indicated vbf  003 - 004c eg
Lara et al 2000 Jamrozy et al 2005 These estimates
are based on spectral aging techniques and rely on the
argument based on source morphologies that the mean
backow velocity is equal to the mean head advance ve-
locity ie hvbf i  hvhsi In Sect 4 we estimated that
the time elapsed since the particles in the SW lobe exten-
sion were last accelerated is  4  107 yr These particles
are separated from the current location of the jet termi-
nation by a projected distance of 630 kpc Therefore we
estimate a separation velocity the lobe velocity with re-
spect to the hot spot of  005c If we also assume equal
advance and backow velocities then vbf  0025c the
upper limit is similar to the values derived for other giant
radio sources
We estimate the external gas density using our
knowledge of the 3-D galaxy distribution Our analy-
sis suggests that the source MRC B0319454 does not
reside in an extremely over-dense environment eg a
galaxy cluster instead we have shown that the host
galaxy is a member of a loose group that is embed-
ded within a large-scale galaxy lament The large-scale
structure represents only moderate over-densities There-
fore in terms of the mean baryon density b we expect
that 1  extb  100 in the galaxy lament environ-
ment of the SW lobe
In order to estimate the density of the lobe material
in MRC B0319454 we consider two possibilities 1
that the lobe consists purely of waste jet material and
2 that in addition to the waste jet material the lobe is
contaminated by thermal IGM which has been entrained
into the cocoon during the evolution of the radio source
In estimating the density of the non-thermal waste jet
material we assume an electron-proton plasma with a
power-law distribution in energy and index a The lower
and upper Lorentz factor cutos to this distribution are
min and max respectively In this case the internal mass
density of the lobe plasma is related to the energy density
up in the synchrotron emitting particles by
a  2
a  1
where we have assumed that max  min We compute
this expression in conjunction with minimum energy as-
sumptions using minimum Lorentz factors of min  102
and 103 since values within this range have been inferred
for jets and lobes previously see eg Blundell et al
2006 Worrall  Birkinshaw 2006 For the particle en-
ergy density calculation we adopt a maximum Lorentz
factor of max  105 For example min  102 gives
up  45  1015 J m3 and   28  1031 kg m3
while min  103 results in up  26  1015 J m3
and   16  1032 kg m3 The implied lobe densi-
ties expressed as a fraction of the external gas density
  ext are in the range 107    104
For comparison an electron-positron jet with the
same min values would result in lobe densities that are a
factor  103 lower than those above and a density ratio
in the range 1010    107 For each plasma type we
note that the lobe densities and corresponding -values
are lower limits since they do not account for possible
entrainment of the relatively dense IGM
Any entrainment of IGM gas into the cocoon of the
radio galaxy would pollute the lobe cavity and increase its
density This quantity however would remain less than
that in the IGM so that   1 The actual amount of en-
trainment might depend on the source history the power
of the jets and the environment in which the source is sit-
uated We have examined the polarization properties over
the bulk of the SW lobe in an attempt to shed light on
ccid13 2002 RAS MNRAS 000 114
MRC B0319454 Probing large-scale structure
their thermal content but nd that these do not provide
any useful limits on  Rather the measured polarization
indicates that the Faraday depth over the source is  1
radian This implies a thermal electron density of  70
m3 for the SW lobe which has an estimated depth of
430 kpc and a minimum energy magnetic eld 01 nT
If we allow for the presence of protons the implied mass
density is  7  1026 kg m3 At the upper limit this
implies   1 for the considered range of ext values and
therefore is a poor constraint
The inner sources in restarting or double-double ra-
dio galaxies are a useful probe of the plasma in which
they are enveloped Kaiser et al 2000 examined a sam-
ple of double-double restarting radio sources with sizes
 1 Mpc and in a IGM environment and found   0001
to be consistent with the observed properties of the in-
ner doubles More recently Safouris et al 2008 showed
that entrainment has signicantly increased the densi-
ties in the outer lobes of the giant double-double radio
galaxy PKS B1545321 They nd a similar non-thermal
density in the lobes to what we have inferred for MRC
B0319454 however they also nd that the total lobe
densities are much greater and at least a few percent of
the IGM density because of contaminating thermal gas
We therefore consider that  could be as high as 001 if
MRC B0319454 has entrained IGM gas during its evo-
lution In such a case it is interesting to note that if the
jets are electron-positron in composition then the lobe
density would be completely dominated by the entrained
For buoyancy to account for the movement of the
SW lobe that has a density   ext the gravitational
acceleration is required to be
g  7109
7500 km s12 Rc
250 kpc1
m s2 8
for our adopted values of Rc and vbf  Thus for a lobe with
  001 it is necessary that g  7  1011 m s2 For
a lobe with no entrainment and   104 the required
acceleration is g  7  1013 m s2
In Fig 15 we have plotted the value of the gravita-
tional eld that is necessary to deect the lobe backow
for a range of  values solid lines Estimates of the mag-
nitude of the gravitational eld in the vicinity of the SW
radio lobe based on the local and large-scale galaxy dis-
tributions are displayed with dotted lines We also plot
as a function of external gas density the eld that is re-
quired to buoyantly move the lobe if there has been no
entrainment and min  102 dashed line or 103 dot-
dashed line In this latter calculation we have expressed
the external density as a fraction of the mean baryon
density of the Universe b which is the baryon density
parameter Baryon times the critical density critical
Figure 15 shows that if the amount of entrained ther-
mal gas in the cocoon is negligible and therefore the
cocoon is relatively light 107    104 the grav-
itational eld required to deect the lobe via buoyancy
encompasses the range of what we estimate at the SW
lobe g  6  1014 - 6  1013 m s2 due to the sur-
rounding mass distribution From the above analysis we
conclude that the o-axis evolution in the SW lobe may
result from buoyancy forces in the backow if there is
ccid13 2002 RAS MNRAS 000 114
minimal entrainment Alternatively this may also occur
if the entrained gas is conned to a narrow boundary
layer along the edge of the lobe The external densities
implied by the buoyancy model are in good agreement
with those expected in the galaxy lament environment
of the giant radio source They represent moderate over-
densities in the gas distribution and are therefore within
those expected for the warm-hot phase of the IGM eg
Bregman 2007 The external pressures signied by the
model also hint at an ambient gas with warm-hot tem-
peratures Pressure equilibrium between the lowest sur-
face brightness regions of the SW lobe and the exter-
nal gas implies an IGM pressure of 1  1015 N m2 in
the vicinity of the ow For the considered range of ex-
ternal densities this equates to an IGM temperature in
the range 2  106  108 K At the lower end corre-
sponding to higher external densities the gas tempera-
ture is well matched to that of the WHIM ie 105  107
K Therefore a buoyant movement of the lobe plasma
would support our initial hypothesis that the lobes of
MRC B0319454 are interacting with the warm-hot gas
phase of the IGM
The above interpretation is an appealing one since
it signies evidence of an interaction between the radio
source and WHIM Nevertheless we consider below fur-
ther mechanisms which may drive the o-axis movement
of the SW lobe plasma
52 Buoyant bubbles
We next consider a variant of the above model where the
SW lobe extension is treated as a bubble rather than a
back ow The synchrotron bubble is embedded within
a thermal gaseous medium and rises against the gravity
vector In this case the dynamics are determined by the
balance between the buoyant and drag forces which act
upon the bubble in the IGM eg Gull  Northover 1973
Bruggen  Kaiser 2001 Equating these forces implies a
terminal velocity for the bubble of
vT  r 2gV
where V is the volume of the rising bubble A is the
area of its cross-section and CD is the drag coecient
We approximate the displaced SW lobe as a sphere with
V A  130 kpc and take CD  075 Churazov et al
2001 Adopting a gravitational eld g  59  1013 m
s2 as estimated at the location of the host galaxy in the
large-scale galaxy lament we calculate a terminal veloc-
ity vT  80 km s1 for the lobe At this speed it would
take more than 2  109 yr for the lobe plasma to move
the observed 200 kpc distance o-axis This time-scale
is grossly longer than the estimated spectral ages  107
yr for dierent components of the source including the
extension at the NW end of the SW lobe and signies
that buoyant forces are unlikely to be responsible for the
movement of the lobe if it is a relict bubble More gen-
erally this analysis suggests that buoyant forces acting
on bubbles of synchrotron lobe plasma in the IGM are
unimportant unless the bubbles have signicantly larger
radii and are in gravitational elds that are at least an
order in magnitude or more greater than what we have
Safouris Subrahmanyan Bicknell  Saripalli
estimated for MRC B0319454 such gravitational elds
are unlikely outside rich clusters of galaxies
53 Density gradients in the IGM
The most striking feature in the morphology of the giant
radio source MRC B0319454 is the side-to-side asym-
metry in the lobe extents from the core The NE lobe
extends over a deprojected distance of 640 kpc from the
core while the end of SW lobe is at a much greater dis-
tance of 1430 kpc Light-travel time eects are one pos-
sible mechanism for causing such asymmetries however
as noted in Saripalli et al 1994 these eects would be
small for the range of velocities that the ends of the lobes
might take A better explanation relates to corresponding
asymmetries in the IGM In this section we examine the
ambient gas distribution for such asymmetries Again it
is assumed that the galaxies trace the matter
The galaxy distribution within the host galaxy group
suggests that there might be a gas density gradient about
the host Specically the host galaxy appears to lie at
the center of the group The most luminous members of
the group are located to the north of the host with the
exception of the second brightest member which resides
west of the host Since low luminosity X-ray groups show
evidence for irregular distributions in the X-ray emitting
intra-group gas with the emission preferentially biased
to the luminous galaxies in the group Mulchaey 2000
we might expect there to be less thermal gas south of the
radio core in this group
Based on the asymmetry in the lobe extents from the
core we infer that the ends of the SW and NE lobes have
advanced with a velocity ratio of 21 Assuming that the
advance of the leading lobe edge is ram pressure limited
by the density of the external gas we expect that the ex-
ternal density is 4 times larger on the NE side of the core
compared to that on the SW side In Sect 32 we noted
that there was evidence in the surrounding galaxy distri-
bution for a density gradient in the IGM along the radio
jet axis of the source see also Fig 11 At a smooth-
ing scale of 125 Mpc the fractional over-density in the
galaxy counts is about 10 in the region of the NE lobe
and decreases along the axis of the southern jet to ap-
proximately 2 in the vicinity of the SW hot spot As-
suming that the galaxies trace the gas this gradient in
the fractional density contrast together with the derived
mean galaxy number density of 03 is consistent with the
side-to-side length asymmetry in this source Again this
suggests that the length asymmetry in MRC B0319454
results from density gradients in the IGM environment
of the source Also the consistency between the derived
ratio of galaxy densities on each side of the core with the
asymmetry in the lobe extents from the core supports
our hypothesis that the galaxies are a reliable tracer of
the gas on large scales
Given that density gradients in the IGM can ac-
count for the side-to-side length asymmetry in MRC
B0319454 it is worth considering if these are also re-
sponsible for the observed asymmetry in the lobe shapes
on the two sides of the core We have shown previously
that the NE lobe appears to be embedded within the
loose group of galaxies of which the host is a member The
fractional over-density is relatively high nn  10 in
the region of the NE lobe Further examination of the
fractional over-density in the vicinity of the radio source
at a smoothing scale of 125 Mpc shows no evidence for
density gradients within the region of the group occupied
by the NE lobe Slice proles along the length of the NE
lobe along the line of sight through the NE lobe and
transverse to the axis of the NE lobe show that the frac-
tional overdensities are a constant and a little over 10 in
each of these directions The fractional over-density val-
ues do decline at the periphery of the group However
the NE lobe appears to be located close to the centre of
the galaxy density distribution associated with the group
The uniform density in the region occupied by the NE
lobe is consistent with the axially symmetric backow of
the hot spot plasma along the radio axis in this lobe
The accompanying high fractional over-density values in
the region of the galaxy group along with the radio mor-
phology of the source suggest that the relatively denser
intra-group medium connes the NE lobe and stalls any
expansion losses This has resulted in a relatively bright
and luminous NE lobe
A similar analysis of the fractional over-density val-
ues in the region of the SW lobe suggests a dierent sce-
nario As mentioned already there is a decline in the
fractional over-density along the jet axis from the radio
core to the lobe end In addition we nd that there is a
gradient in the over-density along a line of sight through
the SW lobe the fractional over-density is about a factor
of 2 larger behind the lobe compared to that in front and
at the location of the lobe Also as might be expected
from the radio morphology there exists a gradient in the
over-density that is transverse to the radio jet axis and
oriented SE to NW Fractional over-density values along
this direction show that there is more galaxy density on
the SE side of the source compared to the NW side This
gradient may be viewed as arising from the combined ef-
fects of the host group and neighbouring galaxy concen-
tration The numbers we derive suggest that the external
densities are a factor of 2 or more higher on the SE side
of the lobe relative to the NW side
Such a density gradient may have caused the asym-
metric expansion of the SW lobe plasma in this direc-
tion The plasma on the NW side of the radio jet axis
extends about three times further from the jet axis than
the plasma on the SE side The plasma may be expand-
ing on the two sides with a velocity ratio of 31 If this
side-ways expansion is ram pressure limited then we ex-
pect the external density on the SE side of the axis to be
a factor 9 larger than that on the NW side Our analysis
of the fractional density contrast indicates that the gas
densities on the two sides of the SW lobe are in the ra-
tio 21 when examined with a smoothing scale 125 Mpc
but these could be larger on smaller smoothing scales Al-
though the density gradient is in the direction expected
for this model the local galaxy number density  03 at
this smoothing scale is insucient to make a useful es-
timate of density variations on the 05 Mpc length scale
which is necessary to examine whether the magnitude of
the density gradient is sucient to account for the trans-
verse expansion
ccid13 2002 RAS MNRAS 000 114
MRC B0319454 Probing large-scale structure
In particular the decreased ambient density to the
NW of the SW lobe may have caused the synchrotron
plasma to break connement along this edge In this case
the low surface brightness extension and its relatively
steep spectral index distribution could be attributed to
expansion losses provided that the electron energy spec-
trum is curved or has a high frequency break that has
shifted to the observing range
Finally we note that the extent of the NE lobe from
the core is similar to the extent of the detected SW jet
from the core The gas associated with the group may be
distributed to equal extents about the host although as
noted earlier we expect more gas to the north based on
the locations of the most luminous galaxies The gaseous
envelope which likely connes the NE lobe might also
be responsible for the connement and detectability of
the SW jet in this region
To summarize the qualitative correspondance be-
tween the density distribution and the radio source mor-
phology is suggestive of a physical origin for the structure
and asymmetries in the interaction between the radio jet
plasma and ambient gas inhomogenieties a likely mech-
anism is ram pressure limitation of the lobe advance and
expansion by the gas density In this picture the asym-
metries are caused by the locations and orientations of
the radio lobes with respect to the gaseous media asso-
ciated with the host galaxy group and the neighbouring
galaxy concentration south of the host
6 CONCLUSIONS
We have presented new high sensitivity radio images
of the powerful radio galaxy MRC B0319454 together
with observations of the surrounding large-scale struc-
ture Using these we have sought to understand the in-
uence of the ambient gas and gravity on the evolution
of the jets and post hot spot plasma in this remark-
able source Our observations are qualitatively consis-
tent with a model wherein the galaxies trace inhomo-
geneities in the intergalactic gas and these in turn deter-
mine the evolution of the giant radio source In this re-
spect our study has reached similar conclusions to those
of Subrahmanyan et al 2008 who also showed that
asymmetries in the morphology of the giant relict source
MSH J05052835 may be governed by inhomogeneities
in the ambient intergalactic gas distribution whose dis-
tribution follows the large scale structure in galaxies In
particular both studies have found a foreshortening of
the lobes in the direction of greater galaxy density and
o-axis distortions in the direction of decreasing galaxy
density
In MRC B0319454 over-densities in the galaxy dis-
tribution are found north of the radio core These are
related to the loose galaxy group of which the host is a
member The advance of the NE jet and expansion of the
corresponding lobe are ram-pressure limited by the intra-
group medium of this galaxy concentration Furthermore
there is less gas density to the south of the radio core
explaining the rapid advance of the SW jet and increased
expansion losses in the post hot spot ow A density gra-
ccid13 2002 RAS MNRAS 000 114
dient perpendicular to the jet axis in the SW lobe may
also inuence the asymmetric lobe expansion to the NW
We further hypothesize that the SW backow may
be moving away from the source axis and NW due to
buoyancy We nd that buoyant forces due to a gravi-
tational eld transverse to the radio source axis can de-
ect the backow of the SW jet plasma provided there
has been minimal entrainment of ambient gas into the
lobe This leads to a model in which the medium exter-
nal to the SW radio lobe has the same properties as those
inferred for the WHIM component of the IGM
Future deep imaging of the gas associated with the
large-scale structure would help to further our interpreta-
tion This work demonstrates the usefulness of giant radio
galaxies as probes of the IGM through the relationship
between source morphology and the ambient large-scale
structure distribution
