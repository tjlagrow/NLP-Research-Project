ABSTRACT
A new idea is proposed for the origin of bulges in spiral galaxies Numerical
simulations for the protogalactic collapse suggest strongly that galactic bulges
have been assembled from massive clumps formed in the galactic disks in their
early evolutionary phase These clumps result from the gravitational instability
of the gas-rich disks of young galaxies Those massive clumps individual masses
of which can be as large as  109M are able to spiral toward the galactic center
owing to dynamical frictions within a few Gyr Inward transport of disk matter
by this process leads to the formation of a galactic bulge A simple analytical
model has been constructed in which the clumpy evolution of a disk galaxy
is controlled by two parameters the timescale with which the primordial gas
in the halo accretes onto the disk plane ie collapse timescale and the mass
fraction of the primordial gas relative to the galaxy total mass Under plausible
assumptions for the variation of these parameters among spiral galaxies the
clumpy evolution model can explain the observed trend that the bulge-to-disk
ratio increases as the total mass or the internal density of the galaxy increases
This success suggests that the clumpy evolution of the galactic disk constitutes
an important ingredient of the disk galaxy evolution Star formation in primeval
disk galaxies takes place mostly in the clumps Resulting knotty appearance of
these systems may explain the peculiar morphology observed in a number of
high-redshift galaxies

Introduction
One of the most notable structural features of disk galaxies is that they are composed
of two distinct components disks and bulges The origin of this two-component structure
 2 
remains unclear although it constitutes an important back-bone of disk galaxies Several
theoretical studies have addressed this problem eg Larson 1976 Gott and Thuan 1976
Conventional understanding is that the galactic bulges have been formed as a single body
within a relatively short period as a result of the collapse of a gaseous protogalaxy and
the later accretion of the residual primordial gas has built the disk components Pioneering
models by Larson 1976 for the formation of disk galaxies are one of the most extensive
numerical models which have embodied this idea but have a potential problem that two
dierent regimes of star formation should be assumed in order to realize distinct separation
between a bulge and a disk Recent observations of the Milky Way bulge eg Rich
1996 McWilliam and Rich 1994 and bulges of other galaxies have stimulated attempts to
elucidate when and how the galactic bulges have been formed and nature of the bulges itself
egMatteucci and Brocato 1990 Peletier and Balcells 1996 Kormendy 1993
On the other hand recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope HST and other
new generation ground-based telescopes are revealing the properties of distant galaxies at
the epochs when the Universe was younger than half of its present age and thus providing
a direct access to the initial evolution phase of galaxies Those galaxies having a redshift
z  1 generally exhibit morphologically peculiar structures which defy the application
of the traditional Hubble classication scheme eg van den Bergh et al 1996 Abraham
et al 1996 Glazebrook et al 1994 Glazebrook et al 1995 Griths et al 1994 Driver
et al 1995 Cowie et al 1995 The most remarkable class of those high-redshift galaxies
includes the systems which consist of a few blobs clumps embedded in a common diuse
envelope For example Griths et al 1994 note several galaxies with prominent bright
knots in their sample of HST Medium Deep Survey Galaxies having similar morphology
are also found in images examined by other groups eg Giavalisco et al 1996b Koo et al
1996 van den Bergh et al 1996
Some of the peculiarities observed in these high-redshift galaxies may originate in
copious interstellar gas existing in early evolution phase of disk galaxies In most disk
galaxies which we observe in the present-day universe the interstellar gas can be regarded as
a dynamically passive component because of the small fraction it occupies in the total mass
of the galaxy The motion of the gas is determined practically by the gravitational eld
arising from the stellar component and apart from dissipative process and star formation
ballistic motion is a good approximation for the description of the gas kinematics This
situation however changes drastically if the mass fraction of the gas relative to the total
galaxy mass exceeds about 10 percent In this gas-rich regime the interstellar gas is
very active dynamically The gas being dissipative and self-gravitating tends to form
numerous massive clumps each of which is gravitationaly bound These massive clumps
are involved with various dynamical processes Noguchi 1998 For example they deect
 3 
stellar motions eectively and heat up the stellar disk component ie increase the stellar
velocity dispersion and thus aect the stability of the galactic disk Shlosman and Noguchi
1993 Noguchi 1996 Noguchi 1998 has proposed the gravitational instability origin for
those sub-galactic clumps frequently observed in high-redshift galaxies and argued that
they may serve as building blocks of galactic bulges The present paper expands upon this
idea and tries to discuss the evolution of young disk galaxies in more details with much
emphasis placed on the formation of galactic bulges and dependence of its eciency on
galaxy parameters

formation In 4 an analytical modelling is devised for the growth of galactic disks and is
applied to bulge formation Observational data about global properties of spiral galaxies
are summarized in 5 and compared with the theoretical results in 6 Discussion and
conclusions are given in 7 and 8 respectively
2 Numerical Simulation
This section provides a full account of the numerical model which has motivated the
new idea of bulge formation briey given in Noguchi 1998 and examined extensively
here Collapse of a protogalaxy composed of the dark matter and primordial gas has been
simulated by an N-body method including a star formation algorithm Similar approaches
have been taken by many researchers eg Baron and White 1987 Katz and Gunn
1991 Katz 1992 Steinmetz and Muller 1995 Navarro and White 1994 Unlike most of
these works which employed initial conditions based on a specic type of cosmology such
as the Cold Dark Matter model the present work does not assume a particular cosmology
I start from an idealized initial condition and attempt to predict properties of young
disk galaxies which will be robust to the nature of the assumed cosmology The primary
interest here is in investigating detailed morphological and dynamical evolution of forming
disk galaxies Therefore the simulation is restricted to a three dimensional volume which
encloses a single galaxy The factor by which a galaxy has collapsed after turn-around ie
separation from Hubble expansion is considered to be large a factor of 10 eg Fall and
Efstathiou 1980 The present study does not deal with the whole process of this collapse
but only the evolution of the galaxy after it has shrinked to the present size and has become
balanced by the increased centrifugal force in the direction perpendicular to the rotation
axis Therefore the halo the dark matter mentioned hereafter means only its portion
contained in the optical radius of the galaxy This limitation in space makes it possible
to investigate more detailed structure and kinematics of the forming galaxy than other
 4 
cosmologically-implemented simulations
The primordial gas which has been destined to make the visible parts of the present-day
galaxies is considered to have been more-or-less clumpy eg Fall and Rees 1985 Sizes
and masses of these clumps are matter of debate Though the recent progress in the
observational technique is enabling access to these pregalactic entities in the form of
quasar absorption line systems for example the physical properties deduced from those
observations are diverse For example Steidel 1990 estimates the typical size of 1 - 15
kpc and the mass of 106  109M for the Lyman limit systems which are considered to
constitute halos of galaxies located on the line-of-sights to more distant quasars
Depending on the assumed size and mass of these building blocks two extreme pictures
can be considered to describe the formation process of galaxies in general The rst one
envisions a relatively regular and smooth both spatially and temporarily gas accretion
process in the potential well of the protogalaxy eg Gott and Thuan 1976 Larson 1976
Graininess of the pregalactic clumps is neglected on the scale of galaxy size The second
picture in another extreme considers that a typical galaxy has been made by mergers
of subgalactic units which are not so small and numerous as to permit neglect of their
discreteness eg Cole et al 1994
Although the evolution of elliptical galaxies could be much dierent depending on
which picture is adopted these two limiting scenarios seem to converge in the case of disk
galaxies Stellar dynamical processes which retain memory of initial conditions to some
extent are considered to have non-negligible eects on the formation and evolution of
elliptical galaxies In contrast with this the observed thiness of the galactic disks suggests
that the assembling of pregalactic units into galactic disks has been a highly dissipative
process Merger of non-dissipative stellar systems would pu up the disk eg Toth and
Ostriker 1992 In other words pregalactic bodies whatever their sizes and masses may
have been should have been primarily gaseous when they coagulated to make a galactic
disk Dissipative nature of these bodies must have erased identity of individual bodies
quickly Thus all the disk galaxies in their early evolutionary phase should have had
a relatively smooth and mostly gaseous galactic disk with roughly the same radius and
thickness as the present-day stellar disk both in the smooth collapse picture and in the
merger scenario

Initial Conditions
As a device to realize dissipative growth of a galactic disk we consider a spherical
protogalaxy consisting of dark matter and primordial gas These two components have
uniform density distributions with the same cut-o radius R  15kpc The total mass of
the system is M  15  1011M with the masses of the dark matter and gas components
being Mh  075  1011M and Mg  075  1011M respectively With this choice the
dynamical timescale of the system R3GM12  706  107yr where G is the gravitational
constant The unit velocity becomes GMR12  208kms1 The dark matter and gas
components are modeled as systems comprising Nh  20000 and Ng  30000 particles
respectively The adopted gas fraction MgM  05 is based on the observations that the
mass fraction of the dark halo component within the optical radius is clustering around 05
for most disk galaxies for which the rotation curve and the distribution of the luminous
component are observed with high accuracy van der Kruit and Searle 1982 Bahcall and
Casertano 1985 but see also discussion in 46 There is no stellar particle initially Ns0
The dark matter particles are given isotropic random motions with an one-dimensional
velocity dispersion of   122kms1 bringing the dark halo into virial equilibrium
roughly The gas particles are given a uniform rotation with an angular frequency of
  139kms1kpc1 Therefore the gas system is already in rough centrifugal equilibrium
owing to enough rotational support and is expected to collapse not much in the radial
direction but mostly along the spin axis The direction of the angular momentum vector
for this rotational motion is taken as the z-axis hereafter with the x- and y- axes lying in
the plane perpendicular to the z-axis The evolution of the system under its self-gravity is
simulated by an N-body method
The dark matter particles are treated as collisionless Namely their motions are
determined solely by the global gravitational eld they feel On the other hand gas particles
are modeled as particles which collide with each other inelastically thus dissipating their
kinetic energy Star formation process from the gas is also included as described shortly
The gravitational force exerted on each particle is calculated by the GRAPE which is
a dedicated device for N-body calculations Ebisuzaki et al 1993 The softening radii
h  300pc and g  150pc are introduced for dark matter and gas particles respectively
to suppress undesirable two-body eects
 6 
22 Gas Dynamics and Star Formation
Gas dynamics is treated by the so-called sticky particle method Inelastic collisions
between the gas particles are introduced to model the dissipative nature of the interstellar
medium Levinson and Roberts 1981 Roberts and Hausman 1984 Hausman and Roberts
1984 All the cloud particles are assumed to have the same nite radius rc  38pc In
the simulation two overlapping clouds are made to collide inelastically provided that they
are approaching each other After collision the radial component of the mutual velocity
is multiplied by fcol  001 and its sign is reversed while the tangential component is
unchanged in order to mimick energy dissipation The evolution of the system does not
change appreciably as far as fcol  05
The star formation process is simulated by changing a gas cloud particle to a stellar
particle This conversion is performed with a probability which is related to the local gas
density around the cloud particle as follows The local gas density  for a given cloud
particle is determined by counting the number of the gas clouds residing in the sphere of a
radius rdens  750pc centered on the cloud in question Then the probability p for star
formation for this cloud in the current time step is calculated by p  Kstar  dt  12
Here Kstar is a coecient which controls the star formation eciency and dt is the size
of the time step which is 706  105yr ie one hundredth of the dynamical time The
value of Kstar is determined empirically so that the time variation of star formation rate
is in a rough agreement with the one inferred for disk galaxies from various observational
data see 3 The square root dependence on the local gas density expressed in the above
expression for p is specied by the consideration that the star formation process though
its detailed nature is not well understood originates in some form of local gravitational
instability in the interstellar medium and hence its characteristic timescale must be related
to the free-fall timescale of the local unstable region
After getting p by the above equation one number  is created in the range 01 using
the uniform random number generator If   p that cloud particle is changed into a stellar
one If   p no such transformation is made This recipe for star formation namely
converting a whole cloud into a stellar particle with some probability instead of converting
some fraction p in this case of one cloud at every time step was taken to avoid intolerable
increase of the number of particles in the model as new stars form This procedure makes
the sum of the number of gas particles Ng and that of stellar particles Ns to be constant
during the course of simulation One important addition to this recipe is specication of a
threshold density for star formation Star formation is inhibited if the local gas density is
less than a critical value th see below Stellar particles are treated as collisionless with a
gravitational softening parameter s  150pc
 7 
The threshold density was set to be th  01 Mpc3 Observations of nearby
disk galaxies suggest that the threshold surface gas density th for star formation is
 1  10Mpc2 Kennicutt 1989 Because the gas in the present model occupies a
three-dimensional volume in general and is not necessarily conned in a planar conguration
the application of a surface density sounds questionable and a threshold volume density
will be more relevant Using the observed thickness hg  100 pc of the distribution
of the interstellar molecular gas in the disk of the Milky Way galaxy eg Solomon et
al 1979 I converted the threshold surface density to the threshold volume density like
th  thhg  001  01Mpc3 The value adopted for th in the present simulation is
the upper limit of this range though such a translation from the two-dimensional density
to a three-dimensional one may not be justied fully because the conguration of the
interstellar matter could aect its stability and ability to form stars
3 Numerical Results
Morphological evolution of this model is shown in Figure 1 As a galactic disk builds
up by infall of the gas from the halo region several massive clumps are formed in the disk
plane  06  t  07 especially Figure 1e These clumps follow the global rotation
of the galactic disk Some of these clumps are observed to merge and make larger clumps
while orbiting in the disk as clearly seen in Figure 1e Because these clumps suer from
dynamical friction against surrounding disk material they gradually sink to the central
region of the disk This transfer of matter leads to an accumulation of a large mass in the
central region The side view of the system is quite intriguing Figure 1f It is noted
that this inward motion of clumps leads to the formation of a spheroidal component in the
galactic center It is natural to regard this component as a galactic bulge Note that almost
all the star formation takes place in the disk plane Figure 1d The bulge component is
not made by early star formation occuring in a spheroidal space at the galactic center
The clumpiness of the system makes denition of the galactic center not a trivial
problem In the analyses described below the galactic center is dened to be the center of
the most massive clump at each epoch which is called the bulge The galactic center thus
dened can be displaced from the coordinate origin x  y  z  0 The mean disk plane
dened as the peak position in the z-distribution of the gas clouds also drifts slightly in the
negative z-direction during the simulation These deviations from the coordinate system
are taken into account in the analysis when appropriate
Specication of a threshold gas density for star formation is denitely responsible for
the lack of star formation before the epoch of disk formation Volume density of the gas is
 8 
very low when the gas occupies a three-dimensional spherical volume of the halo region
but increases by a large amount when the gas is gathered into a two-dimensional disk
conguration This change of the dimensionality initiates vigorous star formation in the
galactic disk On the other hand the column density of the gas hardly changes because the
collapse occurs mostly in the vertical direction
Clumpiness observed in the numerical model is a direct consequence of the gas-richness
of the disk which forms by a relatively rapid infall Time evolution of the masses of the
total disk and the gas disk is shown in Figure 2 Here the gas particles whose distance
from the mean disk plane is less than 01 R are considered to constitute the gas disk and
all the stellar particles are regarded as members of the stellar disk The regions with the
cylindrical radius r  03R or r  15R are excluded Initial evolution is the growth of
a mostly gaseous galactic disk along the line fg  fd After the disk formation has been
almost completed star formation starts to deplete the gas component with the model
point going down nearly along the line fd constant in the left panel A slight decrase
in fd is due to inow of the clumps toward the galactic center which builds up the bulge
component
The clumps in this numerical model start to appear distinctly at t  06 Gyr when
the value of fg is around its maximum of 019 I selected a few typical clumps at t  064
Gyr as shown in Figure 1e and investigated their internal structure Examination of the
surface density prole made it possible to draw a boundary between the main body of the
clump and its envelope and to calculate the mass of the main body as the clump mass
Masses of individual clumps are found to be of the order of 001M  109M This value
far exceeds those of any molecular complexes observed in nearby galaxies ie the most
massive known entities which constitute the galactic disks in the present epoch and can
be well compared to the masses of dwarf galaxies
The dashed line in Figure 2 indicates the evolutionary track of an analytical model
which is described later This analytical model with a collapse timescale of 03 Gyr and an
initial fraction of the gas mass of 05 represents the behavior of the numerical model fairly
well I calculated the expected clump mass as the instantaneous Jeans mass in the growing
model disk of this analytical model open circles in Figure 2 right panel The clump mass
thus obtained reaches the maximum value of  109M at t  05 Gyr when fg dashed
line reaches the maximum of  014 which is roughly equal to the maximum of fg in
the numerical model The agreement between the numerical and analytical clump masses
suggests that the seeds of those clumps in the numerical model are created by the local
gravitational instablility in the gaseous disk component We should however be careful in
relating the clump mass to the Jeans mass in the disk at current epoch because masses of
 9 
individual clumps in the numerical model increase continuously in general due to mergers
among themselves and later accretion of the surrounding gas whereas the analytically
calculated clump mass starts to decrease as fg decreases
Figure 3 shows the time development of the star formation rate SFR The SFR
starts to increase abruptly  05 Gyr after the start of the simulation and attains a peak
rate of  40Myr1 at t  07 Gyr This is just the epoch when most of the gas has
settled to the disk see Figure 1b The SFR declines after the maximum monotonically
except a few weak but distinct burst-like increases By t  21 Gyr 37 percent of the gas
has been converted into stars The peak SFR of  40Myr1 is within the range of 4-75
Myr1 deduced by Steidel et al 1996b for a population of z  3 galaxies The temporal
change of the SFR in the numerical model agrees also with the history of star formation in
early-type disk galaxies inferred from the observations Sandage 1986 Note also that the
overall behavior of the SFR is similar to that of the SFR obtained in the analytical model
It is noted that the SFR reaches the maximum roughly at the time when the clumpy
structure is most prominent Figure 3 This means that during the course of evolution
the model galaxy will be observed as a clumpy object at the highest probability provided
the observation is made in the rest-frame UV band which is sensitive to young massive
stars Also note global asymmetry of the stellar component in the present model which is
most noticeable at t 09 Gyr to 13 Gyr see Figure 1e
The asymmetric and clumpy disk seen in this model is strongly reminiscent of the
images of many galaxies at large redshift obtained by the HST eg van den Bergh et al
1996 Griths et al 1994 Koo et al 1996 Although the irregular and clumpy nature is
most noticeably found in the objects with a medium redshift ie  05  z  1 it
may be traced into a larger redshift Steidel et al 1996a investigated the morphology of
Lyman break galaxies with 23  z  34 found in the Hubble Deep Field and noticed some
objects having multicomponent structure They also mention diuse asymmetric halos
around these high-redshift galaxies In view of the present numerical result some parts of
these morphological peculiarities may be caused by gravitational instability of the galactic
disks in their early evolution phases
The clumps discussed above experience strong dynamical friction owing to their large
masses Resulting accumulation of clumps to the galactic center makes a bulge as already
stated The bulge in the present numerical model is not formed quickly in a single event
as the protogalaxy collapses to the galactic center but is assembled gradually as individual
clumps formed in the disk plane spiral into the galactic center The growth of the bulge
is stepwise because accretion of clumps takes place in a discrete manner Figure 4 shows
the distribution of the age for the bulge stars at several epochs Discrete nature of the
 10 
bulge growth is manifested as a few local maxima in the age distribution see the bottom
panel especially which correspond respectively to starbursts triggered by the falling-in of
a massive clump into the bulge region At the nal epoch indicated t  198 Gyr the age
spread is as large as  1 Gyr
4 Analytical Multi-Component Models
The numerical model discussed above is enlighting but has a diculty As shown
below one of the most important parameters which govern the evolution of disk galaxies
is the accretion timescale namely the timescale of gas infall from the halo It is dicult
to vary this timescale freely by employing the sticky-particle method Accretion can
be accelerated or slowed down by varying the size of the clouds andor the restitution
coecient fcol in the cloud collisions in the sticky-particle model However it is not fully
clear how these parameters are related to the observed properties of the interstellar gas
For example the giant molecular clouds of the Milky Way galaxy have a very complicated
internal structure comprising many hierarchical levels in spatial scale and no single spatial
scale seems to dominate eg Henriksen 1991 Also the accretion of gas to the disk
plane is likely to be aected by other eects than dissipative cloud-cloud collisions as
discussed below These considerations have motivated development of analytical models
which introduce the accretion timescale as a free parameter In this section I discuss
the analytical model of disk growth to remedy the limitation possessed by the numerical
simulation The analytical model developed here has essentially the same ingredients as the
previous version described in Noguchi 1996 but is improved in several respects
41 Basic Equations
I consider a spherical halo with a radius R The primordial gas initially distributed in
this halo region gradually accretes to the disk plane and builds up a galactic disk As the
accretion proceeds the disk becomes to contain more and more gas ie the interstellar
gas and stars form from it I assume that the stars and the gas in the disk occupy a at
cylindrical region with the same radius as the halo The whole system considered here
is meant to represent the portion of a disk galaxy within its optical radius so that the
halo in the present model should be regarded as not representing the entire dark halo the
massive halo but its portion within the optical extent of the galaxy in accordance with the
numerical model presented above The system is divided into four components the halo
the stellar disk the gas disk and the bulge The mass of each component is denoted by mh
 11 
ms mg and mb respectively Total mass is denoted by M mh  ms  mg  mb I am
not concerned with any structures which might develop in each component but treat each
component as a single zone Namely the physical state of each component at a given time
is specied by several global quantities whose value should be understood as a characteristic
one namely the average over the entire region of that component
Under this simplication time evolution of masses in respective components is
formulated as follows
 SF R 
 2 exp
 SF R
where t is the time reckoned from the beginning of gas infall which is here assumed to be
12 Gyr ago The rst term in the righthand side of equations 1 and 2 denotes the eect
of star formation and SF R here stands for the star formation rate for the whole galaxy f ri
is the timescale of the inward motion of clumps formed in the disk This inow is caused
by dynamical frictions acting upon the clumps and its timescale determines the growth
rate of the bulge component The bulge growth is determined by eq3 in this analytical
formulation The third term in the righthand side of equation 1 represents addition of gas
to the disk by the accretion gas infall from outside the disk plane the timescale of which
is denoted by  Hereafter  is referred to interchangeably as the accretion timescale
the collapse timescale or the infall timescale As the infall proceeds the mass of the halo
decreases correspondingly because the total mass of the system M is assumed to be
conserved Here the halo serves only as a reservoir of the primordial gas and its evolution is
not traced The total mass of the matter which eventually accretes to the disk is specied
by its fraction  with respect to the total mass of the galaxy Namely  is the fraction of
the gas mass relative to the total galaxy mass at the initial instant The functional form
of the time variation of the infall rate in eqation 1 was adopted because it is physically
reasonable and mathematically convenient The time dependence here is slightly modied
from the previous one adopted in Noguchi 1996
 12 
42 Star Formation Rate
The fundamental process of star formation in the interstellar medium is not yet well
known Phenomenologically the star formation rate is often represented as a power of the
amount of interstellar gas Schmidt law The present study follows the result by Kennicutt
1989 who has found from a compilation of data for a number of nearby disk galaxies that
the star formation rate per unit area of the galactic disk is proportional to N-th power of
the surface density of the gas which includes both molecular and atomic hydrogen In the
present model this relation is represented as
SF R  N
where g denotes the gas surface density in the disk and is approximated by mgR2
in the present multi-component treatment and  is a coecient which determines the
absolute value of the star formation rate The range of the power in the above Schmidt law
is N  13  03 according to Kennicutt 1989 It was found that setting   355Myr1
produces a range of star formation rate compatible with the observational inference when
the mass mg and the radius R are expressed in units of 1011M and 10 kpc respectively
Therefore  is xed to 355Myr1 and N1 hereafter Adoption of an universal value of
 for all the models is based on the inference that the fundamental star formation process
is the same in all the disk galaxies
The work by Kennicutt 1989 suggests that a certain threshold exists for gas density
below which star formation is eectively inhibited One plausible interpretation is that the
star formation activity is associated closely with the gravitational instability of the gas disk
and the threshold corresponds to neutral stability How is the threshold density determined
One possibility is that the galactic disks have an intrinsic lower limit of velocity dispersion
in the gas cloud motion and a disk with a too small surface density is stabilized by the
random motion of the interstellar gas clouds Indeed HI and CO observations of nearby
galaxies and the Milky Way galaxy suggest near constancy among dierent galaxies of the
velocity dispersion in the atomic and molecular gas clouds eg van der Kruit and Shostak
1984 Stark and Brand 1989 Therefore I introduced a threshold for star formation by
specifying a minimum velocity dispersion which the gas component of the galactic disk can
The star formation threshold introduced in the present model works as follows As
explained shortly the gas disk is assumed to stay at the marginal stability dened by
Q  1 where Q denotes the stability parameter introduced by Toomre 1964 At this
state the surface density of the gas and the velocity dispersion or the sound velocity 
 13 
in the gas are related by Gg   where  is the epicyclic frequency As g decreases
in late phase of evolution  also decreases correspondingly However  cannot become
less than min which is the specied lower limit of the velocity dispersion Therefore star
formation stops at the instant when  reaches min The threshold gas surface density is
then determined by min  minG After this instant the amount of the gas consumed
by star formation is balanced with the amount of the gas added to the disk by accretion so
that the gas surface density is always kept nearly at the threshold value ie g  min
As a special case setting min  0 allows star formation to proceed continuously depending
on the current gas density
43 Dynamical Friction Timescale
Noguchi 1996 applied the classical Chandrasekhar formula in evaluating f ri It is
however doubtful that this formula which assumes homogeneous and innite background
of randomly moving light particles can be safely applied to a heavy body orbiting in a
highly attened and systematically rotating disk component Quinn  Goodman 1986
have extensively discussed sinking process of satellite galaxies through galactic disks and
suggest several analytical evaluations of the orbital decay timescale
Instead of applying a certain analytical formula I have resorted to a more empirical
approach in evaluation of f ri I have run a number of numerical simulations for a massive
rigid body the clump hereafter orbiting in the disk plane of a galaxy model varying the
clump mass the disk surface density the velocity dispersion of disk stars and the shape of
the rotation curve see Appendix for numerical details Time variation of the galactocentric
distance of the clump in each model is plotted in Figure 5 Because all the models show a
remarkably similar behavior when the time axis is suitably adjusted I decided to dene f ri
as the time it takes the clump to move from the initial radius r  08 to the nal radius
r  02
Measurement of f ri in these experiments is summarized in Table 1 It is evident that
the mass of the clump and the surface density of the disk are the key parameters which
determine the dynamical friction timescale Dependence of f ri on other parameters is weak
and can be neglected for the practical range of interest This is fortunate because little is
known in this analytical treatment about the time variation of the disk velocity dispersion
or the shape of the rotation curve Examination of the parameter dependence has led to
the following empirical formula for f ri
 14 
 025
05
MR2 067
Here dyn GMR312 is the dynamical time of the galaxy mcl is the mass of the
clump and  is the surface density of the total disk which includes both gas and stars ie
  mg  msR2
In calculating the clump mass it is assumed that the gas disk is always maintained in
the marginally unstable state with Q1 This assumption nds justication as follows If
Q  1 at a certain moment no star formation is expected to occur because the gas disk is
stable gravitationally to small scale perturbations Then Q decreases because heat input
from massive stars is lacking and the gas radiates its energy When the decreasing Q cuts
the value of unity and becomes slightly smaller than unity the instability sets in and stars
begin to form These stars provide the gas with energy through supernova explosions and
stellar winds Then Q is elevated above unity again Thus the value of Q will oscillate
around Q  1 and Q  1 is a good approximation of the dynamical state of the gas disk
In the state of marginal instability or stability the mass of the clump formed is given
mcl  05c2g 
and the epicyclic frequency is approximated
where the critical wavelength c  22
as   2MR305 Clump formation is related to star formation closely in the present
model To be consistent with introduction of a star formation threshold clump formation is
inhibited when g  min Instantaneous value of f ri is determined by combining equations
5 and 6 The bulge mass mb thus calculated through equation 3 may be uncertain
by a considerable amount because of many simplications made in the present formulation
However relative comparison of mb between dierent models will be meaningful and I
focus on qualitative behavior of the bulge growth in what follows
Now equations 1 2 and 3 combined with auxiliary equations 4 5
and 6 complete a set of equations which determine the temporal evolution of the
system By integrating these equations numerically starting from the initial condition
mg  ms  mb  0 we know time evolution of any physical quantities of interest
 15 
Important Parameters  and 
Evolution of a galactic disk in the present formulation is determined mostly by two
parameters the accretion timescale  and the mass fraction of the primordial gas 
Before dealing with more complicated cases I here discuss what eect these parameters
have on the disk evolution Two model series are considered in order to isolate the eect of
varying each parameter In Series A only the value of  is changed with all other model
parameters being equal while all the models in Series B have the same parameters but 
The mass and the radius of the galaxy are xed to M  1011M and R  10kpc in both
series
Figure 6 shows time evolution of the models in Series A It is seen that as  decreases
the peak values of the gas mass fraction mgM the star formation rate and the clump
mass become larger and are attained at a progressively earlier epoch On the other hand
the present-day values of the gas mass fraction the star formation rate and the clump mass
are larger for a model with slower accretion The bulge formation starts and nishes at an
earlier epoch as  decreases A smaller  also leads to a larger bulge The mass of the
stellar disk at the present epoch is smaller for a smaller  because a larger fraction of the
accreted material goes to the bulge component in this case due to more ecient inow of
matter caused by more massive gas clumps Thus the models in Series A show qualitatively
dierent time evolution depending upon the value of  It should be noted that the bulge
growth caused by the inow is heavily reduced or stopped when the disk becomes mostly
stellar
What about the eect of varying  Figure 7 which plots temporal behavoir of Series
B indicates that all the models in this family exhibit a qualitatively similar time evolution
Each quantity changes as time in a similar way and no remarkable eect of varying 
is observed Eect of varying  manifests only as the dierence in the absolute value
Dotted lines in Figure 7 indicate the values divided by  of each model Rough equality in
the normalized values of msM mgM and SFR among dierent models indicates that
these quantities are roughly proportional to the mass fraction  On the other hand the
normalized clump mass and the normalized bulge mass show a dierence of  10 among
the calculated models Thus these quantities behave in a highly nonlinear way with respect
to  This strong nonlinearity leads to a large dierence in the ratio of the bulge to the
disk or the BT 
Real galaxies have a large range in both mass and size so that the two model series
discussed above which assume xed M and R are highly idealized It is inconceivable
that two galaxies identical in their mass and size have largely dierent collapse time  or
mass fraction  Likely dependence of  and  on the galaxy property should be taken into
 16 
account in order to construct more realistic models
45 Collapse Timescale 
Infall of the gas from outside the disk plane is a natural consequence of galaxy
formation from extended halos It has been also introduced into chemical evolution models
to reproduce the metallicity distribution in the solar neighborhood and the age-metallicity
relation eg Lacey and Fall 1985
It is very dicult to deduce quantitatively the time scale of the protogalaxy collapse
from observational data However several correlations observed among spiral galaxy
properties especially colors and gas contents provide a circumstantial evidence that this
timescale  varies from galaxy to galaxy in a systematical way Late-type disk galaxies
have a larger mass fraction of the interstellar medium relative to the galaxy total mass eg
Young 1990 Casoli et al 1998 and bluer total colors eg de Vaucouleurs 1974 Gavazzi
1993 than early-type spirals These characteristics indicate that the stellar population
in late-type galaxies is relatively younger suggesting a slower build-up of their disks in
view of the results for the model series A discussed above Although variation along the
Hubble sequence appears substantial dependence on the galaxy luminosity seems to be
much larger The well known color-magnitude relation eg Tully et al 1982 states
that the galaxy becomes bluer as it becomes fainter Recent analysis by Gavazzi1993
has found that about two-thirds of the total variation in spiral galaxy color are due to
luminosity dierence and only one-third is contributed by the dependence on the Hubble
morphological type The galaxy luminosity has a large inuence also on the gas content
Gavazzis 1993 plots for separate morphological classes show that at a xed morphological
type the relative gas content increases by  10 as the galaxy luminosity decreases by 4-5
magnitudes Actually the dependence on the luminosity seems to be stronger than the
morphological type dependence being consistent with large scatter of the gas mass fraction
at a xed morphological type seen in Young 1990
Systematic change of the collapse timescale along the Hubble type and the galaxy
luminosity is plausible also from a theoretical point of view A spiral galaxy of an earlier
morphology tends to have a higher density of matter within its optical extent at the same
luminosity as suggested by its larger rotational velocity eg Rubin et al 1985 It is
likely that the collapse timescale is signicantly governed by the radiative cooling of the
primordial gas in the protogalaxy and if this is the case a higher density should have led
to a more rapid collapse owing to more ecient cooling On the other hand a smaller
galaxy may have been more strongly aected by the energy injection from internal star
 17 
formation process than a more massive galaxy Then the collapse of a small galaxy must
have been prolonged considerably by the feedback from the initial star formation Such
feedback mechanisms would have caused mass loss from the system or even disintegration of
the system in the case of suciently intense star formation as expected in dwarf ellipticals
see Yoshii and Arimoto 1987 for example
These considerations have led to a specication of the collapse timescale as a decreasing
function of both the galaxy mass and the internal density The present model assumes a
generalized parameterization of this dependence as follows
  c
1011M
01Mpc3 bGyr
Here the density of the galaxy is dened by   MR3 and c is the coecient to determine
the absolute value of the collapse timescale The power indices a and b determine the
steepness of the dependence and a larger value adopted for each results in a larger range in
the collapse time Both indices are likely to be negative from the discussion above
A simple consideration suggests that the range in  should be smaller than a factor of
ten for the whole population of disk galaxies First of all a collapse time smaller than a few
times 108yr will lead to formation of an elliptical galaxy rather than a spiral because such
a rapid collapse within a few dynamical times of the system will initiate fast star formation
which consumes most of the gas before the system reaches a centrifugal equilibrium A
plausible upper limit to the collapse timescale comes from the fact that most disk galaxies
appear to have already nished collapse to the disk plane by the present epoch If the
collapse is still continuing we should see considerable amount of gas at a large distance
from the galactic plane which should be emitting X-ray radiation corresponding to the
virial temperature of the galaxy ROSAT observations of neaby spiral galaxies Read et
al 1997 indicate that the amount of such hot gas outside the galactic plane is less than
 109M which is less than 10 percent of the galaxy total mass for S0-Sc galaxies in their
sample This observation though yet to be extended to a larger sample seems to preclude
a collapse time which is a large fraction of the age of the universe
To summarize I considered two cases as follows
1 a   1
2 b0 and c20
2 a   1
3 b   1
3 and c25
A steeper power of a and a slightly smaller value of c in case 1 have been taken to
render the range of  in the considered  M domain nearly the same in both cases As an
 18 
additional constraint an upper limit of 5 Gyr is imposed upon  Actually the value of  is
likely to depend also on the position in the galaxy eg Matteucci and Francois 1989 Lacey
and Fall 1985 Larson 1976 The value which is used in the present multi-component
modeling should be regarded as an averaged value characteristic of the whole galaxy
46 Primordial Gas Fraction 
Another important parameter  ie the fraction of mass which eventually accretes
to the galactic plane is not well constrained from observations either It seems to be
reasonable to assume that  is equal to the combined mass fraction relative to the total
galaxy mass  of the bulge and the disk including interstellar medium because there is
no rm evidence that at the present epoch a signicant amount of matter resides in the
halo component except dark matter as stated above Under this assumption reliable
determination of  is still hampered One ambiguity arises from our poor knowledge about
the mass-to-luminosity ratio for the luminous components This ratio depends strongly on
the formation history ie time variation of the star formation rate and the initiall mass
function of the stellar population considered which are generally dicult to deduce On the
other hand the total mass M seems to be well determined from the rotation curve at least
for non-barred galaxies for which the circular rotation provides a fairly exact description of
the disk kinematics
Comparing the empirical relation between the mass-to-luminosity ratio MLB and
the B  V color of spirals with the theoretical one predicted by Larson  Tinsleys 1978
photometric evolution model Tinsley 1981 found that the observed increase of MLB with
the B  V is much shallower than that theoretically predicted suggesting that late-type
spirals have relatively more dark matter than early-type ones Thus Tinsley 1981 has
claimed that the halo mass fraction is the dominant parameter controlling the morphological
type Athanassoula et al 1987 also nd that the dominance of the dark matter is larger
in bluer galaxies However Jablonka  Arimoto 1992 have recently concluded that the
halo mass ratio is universal among spiral galaxies at least from Sa to Sc based on a
detailed population synthesis analysis treating the bulge and the disk separately Also
decomposition models for a selected sample of spirals having well measured rotation curves
seem to show no systematic variation of this ratio along the Hubble sequence eg van der
Kruit and Searle 1982 Bahcall and Casertano 1985
Persic  Salucci 1988 on the other hand conclude that the dark-to-luminous mass
ratio within the optical radius increases as the galaxy becomes less luminous According
to the result by Ashman 1990 which is based on Persic  Salucci 1988 a galaxy with
 19 
a mass of 1010M for example has a twice larger mass fraction of the dark matter on
average compared with the most massive galaxies although the dispersion at a xed mass
is considerably large see Fig2 of Ashman 1990
In view of these arguments I considered three cases as follows
1   012logM  100
2   015logM  015log  256
3   050
47 Model Families
I have calculated two families of models diering in the star formation process In one
family star formation is allowed to take place always depending on the gas density by taking
min  0 These models are called continuous models A nite threshold min  3kms1
was specied in another group hereafter threshold models Each calculated model is
specied by three parameters as c or t- type- type where c and t denotes
continuous and threshold specication for star formation respectively and types for  and
 denote the corresponding specications given in 45 and 46 respectively For example
t-1-3 means the model in which  is a function only of the mass  is constant and the star
formation threshold is introduced All the possible combinations of the three parameters
have been computed leading to 12 models in total In each model the galaxy evolution has
been calculated at  8  8 grid points on the  M plane which are equally spaced both
in log and in logM The ranges of mass and density are 1010M  M  3  1012M and
6  103Mpc3    1Mpc3 respectively The star formation coecient was xed to
  355Myr1 
In the followings the results of these models are confronted with the currently available
observational data
5 Observational Material
Before detailed examination of the model results this section summarizes the
observational data with which the models are compared I conne comparison to the
classical spirals ie to the morphological type from Sa to Sc The observational data
especially those for the bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio are well accumulated only for this
range of morphology
 20 
51 Bulge-to-Disk Ratio
Several studies have tried to measure the luminosity ratio of the bulge and disk
components by the decomposition technique eg Yoshizawa and Wakamatsu 1975 Kent
1985 Simien and de Vaucouleurs 1986 Figure 8 shows the observed bulge-to-total
luminosity ratio as a function of galaxy mass and density for the sample used by Whitmore
1984 which is itself based on the observations by Rubin Ford and Thonnard 1980
and Rubin et al 1982 I calculated the mass and density for the sample galaxies from
the optical radius ie the radius at which the surface brightness in B-band is 25 mag
arcsec2 R25 and the rotational velocity V25 at the optical radius as
M  GR25V 2
  MR3
where G is the gravitational constant Both R25 and V25 have been taken from Rubin et
al 1980 1982 The mass thus calculated will give an approximately correct value for the
optical part of the galaxy but the density calculated here should be regarded as a rough
characteristic value for that galaxy because of a steep density gradient inside the galaxy
It is recognized in Figure 8 that on the average the BT increases as the galaxy
mass increases at a xed galaxy density and at a xed galaxy mass it increases with the
density However it is dicult to represent the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio as a function
of one single parameter The principal component analysis carried out by Whitmore 1984
indicates that the surface brightness of the galaxy is only one physical quantity among
parameters he investigated which shows signicant correlation with the BT Indeed the
lines of constant surface mass density plotted in Figure 8 run roughly in parallel with
loci of constant BT although the irregularity in the distribution of the BT is large In
order to see the observed tendency more clearly Figure 9 divides the whole sample into
two subgroups according to mass or density and plots the BT against the galaxy mass
or the density separately for each subgroup The signicance level P  is given at which
the null hypothesis of zero correlation is disproved as well as the correlation coecient r
The correlation is conrmed with a condence level of  95 percent in all cases Another
compilation by Dale et al 1997 also supports the dependence of the BT on the galaxy
mass and the galaxy density displayed in Figure 8 They do not give the BT but only
the Hubble type for the sample galaxies Figure 10 shows the Hubble morphological type
 21 
distribution on the  M-plane for the Dale et al 1997 sample It is clear that a more
massive or denser galaxy tends to have an earlier morphological type and that the regions
occupied by galaxies with the same Hubble morphological type are also elongated in similar
directions to the constant surface density lines
The observed values of the BT should be taken with caution The measurement
of the bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio is a very delicate task Usually a light distribution
model composed of a de Vaucouleurs bulge ie the r14-law and an exponential disk is
tted to the observed surface brightness prole However this method is criticized recently
eg Andredakis and Sanders 1994 de Jong 1996 on the ground that the de Vaucouleurs
density distribution does not decrease suciently fast as the radius so that the tting is
signicantly inuenced by the irregular light distribution sometimes observed at larger radii
Andredakis  Sanders 1994 propose exponential form for both the bulge and the disk for
better decomposition The result by de Jong 1996 using this method shows a clear trend
that the BT decreases as the morphological type becomes later both in B and K bands
as expected The scatter around the mean relation is large however Also the measured
BT with an exponential bulge is systematically smaller than the one obtained by the de
Vaucouleurs model by a factor of 3-5 It should also be noted that any decomposition
technique works best when the contributions from the bulge and the disk are comparable
On the other hand detection of a faint disk in the presence of a luminous bulge or a small
bulge embedded in a bright disk is dicult
52 Gas Content and Star Formation Rate
Although the primary aim of the present study is to understand the formation of
galactic bulges any successful model of galaxy evolution should be able to explain the
observed trend in the gas content and the star formation activity among galaxies of dierent
type and luminosity
Young 1990 shows that the mass ratio of the gas including both neutral and molecular
hydrogens relative to the dynamical mass calculated from the rotation curve decreases
systematically as the morphological type becomes earlier The gas fraction given by Young
1990 ranges from 003 for Sa-Sab galaxies to 03 for Scd galaxies The scatter within the
same morphological type is as large as  10 however The ratio of molecular to neutral
hydrogens decreases as the Hubble type becomes later Gavazzi 1993 provides extensive
data for HI content in disk galaxies His data show that HI ux per unit H ux increases as
the morphological type becomes later as expected At a xed type HIH is an increasing
function of the H-band luminosity of the galaxy indicating that less massive galaxies are
 22 
more gas-rich on the average
I take here two samples by Young et al 1989 and Sage 1993 which are given in
a convenient form for plotting on the  M plane Figure 11 plots the mass fraction
of the gas by Young et al 1989 From their original sample of 182 galaxies I deleted
those galaxies which lack mass estimate for either HI or H2 Those galaxies suspected to
be in ongoing interactionsmergers or in abnormal star formation activity eg Markarian
galaxies have also been deleted For the remainder the ratio of the total gas mass to
the galaxy mass within the optical radius has been calculated and plotted on the  M
plane A global trend is recognized in this gure that the gas mass ratio increases as the
galaxy mass increases or the galaxy density decreases though the scatter in the ratio is
considerably large This systematic variation is even clearer for the sample by Sage 1993
which is plotted in Figure 12 The gas fraction is seen to increase monotonically toward
the lower-left corner of the diagram Quantitative evaluation of the gas mass fraction needs
caution especially for molecular hydrogens The conversion factor from the observed CO
luminosity to H2 mass is not known accurately and may be dierent from galaxy to galaxy
depending on the metallicity Another ambiguity comes from the fact that the neutral
hydrogen generally extends much farther than the optical radius The procedure taken here
tends to overestimate the gas mass ratio within the optical radius
The largest set of star formation rate measurements is given by Kennicutt 1983 who
calculated the SFR for a number of spiral galaxies from H luminosity Figure 13 plots the
SFR measured by him on the  M plane Only an upper limit of the SFR is given for
most Sa galaxies The distribution pattern of the SFR is not easy to grasp
However the plot of the normalized star formation rate ie SFRM on this plane
reveals a clear trend Fig14 The galaxies with higher SF RM values occupy a lower
region in the  M plane This is qualitatively consistent with the known luminosity
eect that the gas fraction increases and the color becomes bluer as the galaxy becomes
fainter However there appears to be no clear trend from Kennicutts 1983 data that the
normalized SFR increases for less dense hence correspondingly later on average galaxies
This seems to be at odds with the behavior of the gas fraction plotted in Figures 11 and
12 which suggests a stronger dependence of the gas content on the galaxy density than on
the galaxy mass This may be due partly to heavy obscuration of H emission by dust
which should be more severe in late-type spirals These somewhat puzzling results indicate
a necessity for more improved and extensive observational data
 23 
53 Epoch of Bulge Formation
When and how rapid the galactic bulges have been formed is one of the most important
but unsolved problems regarding disk galaxies For example the age of the Milky Way
bulge and the age spread in the bulge stars have not yet been tied down to sucient
accuracy eg Matteucci and Brocato 1990 Holtzman et al 1993 Rich 1996 Norris 1996
Although quantitative assessment is dicult it is possible that the age of the bulge is
dierent from galaxy to galaxy Metallicity observations by Jablonka et al 1996 show
that the value MgFe decreases as the bulge becomes fainter This may indicate that a
smaller bulge possessed in general by galaxies of later morphological types see Fig1 of
Jablonka et al 1996 has been formed in a more extended period though a denite answer
should wait accurate models of chemical evolution
Peletier and Balcells 1996 have recently found that the optical and near-infrared
colors of the bulge are very similar to those of the disk in a number of spiral galaxies of
type S0 to Sbc A blue bulge is likely to be associated with a blue disk One possible
interpretation is that the age of the bulge is correlated with that of the disk and the age
dierence is a small portion of the age of the universe At the same time their data seem
to suggest a large dierence in the bulge age among dierent galaxies Fitting of single age
single metallicity stellar population models by Vazdekis et al 1996 to the U  R and
R  K colors of the observed bulges suggests that a number of bulges can have ages as
young as 4 Gyr and a few bulges may have even younger ages of  1 Gyr Nevertheless
reliable age determination for old stellar populations is dicult because of degeneracy of
their colors
Recent imaging observations of the nearby galaxy bulges carried out by Carollo et al
1997 with the HSTWFPC2 provide intriguing results They found that a considerable
percentage of the observed bulges exhibit irregular morphology being composed of a few
discrete clumps Carollo et al 1997 infer that the bulge formation is not a completed
process associated with the initial protogalactic collapse but may be still ongoing or has
been nished only recently in some galaxies They propose a disk origin for the bulge
matter and invoke bar structures as a tool driving an inow of disk matter to the galactic
center The observation by Carollo et al 1997 suggests that the irregular bulges are
more frequent in spiral galaxies of later morphological types see their Fig3 and this may
indicate later andor more prolonged formation of the bulge in a galaxy of a later type
 24 
6 Model Results
This section describes the model results and attempts comparison with the observational
data The variation of the collapse timescale  and the primordial gas fraction  is shown
in Figure 15 Comparison is carried out by using the  M plane It is permitted in tting
the models to the observations to slide the -axis andor the M-axis by a small amount
Because the present analytical model treats only characteristic values of the galaxy there is
some ambiguity about galaxy mass and density Especially the density is a poorly dened
quantity because of its steep variation with the galactocentric radius Furthermore even if
the galaxy density is dened to be an average density within the optical radius ie R25
usually a discrepancy of this radius between dierent authors because of dierent Hubble
constants adopted for example would be much exaggerated in evaluation of the density
through inverse cubic dependence of the density on the radius These ambiguities should
be kept in mind whenever the models are compared with the observations
61 Bulge-to-Disk Ratio
All of the twelve calculated models exhibit a variation of the bulge-to-disk ratio
as a function of galaxy mass and density which is qualitatively consistent with the
observation Figure 16 plots the mass ratio of the bulge relative to the total luminous
matter BT  mbmb  ms for all the models calculated Comparison of these values
with the observed BT luminosity ratios should be done carefully The dierence in the
mass-to-luminosity ratio in bulges and disks will not totally justify equating the mass ratio
to the luminosity ratio Also the observed luminosity ratio depends on the decomposition
technique used 51 Thus I pay attention primarily to qualitative behavior of the BT
ratio The calculated BT increases as the density andor the mass of the galaxy increases
showing the qualitatively same behavior as the observation suggests It is encouraging that
the range in the BT plotted in Figure 16 is roughly equal to the observed range given by
de Jongs 1996 K-band photometry for galaxies from Sa to Sc Although the slopes of
BT contours depend on the adopted specication of  and  the comparison with Figure
8 does not favor any particular model nor reject it
One intriguing eect of the star formation threshold common to all the threshold
models calculated is an increase of the bulge-to-disk ratio for least massive galaxies for
which all the continuous models give smallest BT ratios This curious behavior is caused
by substantial amount of the interstellar gas unused by star formation in these low density
galaxies This phenomenon may be important in understanding of evolutionary status of
extremely late galaxies and will be discussed in the forthcoming paper
 25 
Figure 17 plots the BT against  Correlation between the two quantities is not
always tight Modulation by the galaxy density or the mass fraction  is not neglected
in general Therefore the conclusion by Noguchi 1998 that the bulge-to-disk ratio is
determined primarily by the collapse timescale ie the disk formation timescale is not
supported The previous conclusion was derived from more limited calculations in which
both the galaxy mass and the galaxy density are xed and only the collapse timescale was
varied such as Series A in 44 and may be errorneous Nevertheless it is true that the
accretion timescale has a strong inuence on the resulting bulge-to-disk ratio
62 Present Gas Content and Star Formation Rate
Figure 18 displays the mass fraction of the gas component mgM at the present
epoch In continuous models the collapse timescale  governs the gas consumption rate
strongly so that the present gas fraction is tightly correlated with  Thus the continuous
models with  dependung only on the galaxy mass c-1-1 c-1-2 and c-1-3 exhibit nearly
horizontal contours of mgM in the  M plane This behavior may contradict with
the observations by Young et al 1989 and Sage 1993 which suggest much steeper
contours see Figures 11 and 12 On the other hand the continuous models with  being
a decreasing function of both mass and density c-2-1 c-2-2 and c-2-3 seem to reproduce
the observed trend at least qualitatively
One possible problem with these continuous models is that the absolute value of the
gas mass fraction tends to be considerably smaller than observed as much as by a factor
of  10 This discrepancy may not rule out these models convincingly however There is a
substantial discrepancy between the interstellar gas masses determined by dierent authors
For example Casoli et al 1998 give the gas fraction of  5  103 for Sa galaxies to
 2  102 for Sc galaxies which is considerably smaller than the values by Young1990
and is in better agreement with the models
Introduction of a threshold gas density controlled by a constant minimum velocity
dispersion of the gas disk improves the result remarkably In this case the gas content
at the present epoch is determined solely by the galaxy parameters M and  through
the epicyclic frequency and does not depend on the star formation history of the galaxy
This is because the galaxy in the considered  M domain has already reached to the
infall-limited regime of star formation by the present epoch The gas mass fraction as a
function of M and  is the same in all the threshold models and increases as M andor 
decreases in qualitative agreement with the observation It is seen that inhibition of star
formation by the threshold boosts up the present-day gas content and brings the models
 26 
into a better agreement with the observational data The observations by Kennicutt 1989
also suggest that the interstellar gas in many spiral galaxies is in the infall-limited regime
at present
The specic star formation rate SF RM in the continuous models follows the same
behavior as the gas fraction on the  M plane Fig19 Regarding star formation the
continuous models with  depending only on the galaxy mass c-1-1 c-1-2 and c-1-3 seem
to be in best agreement with the observation by Kennicutt 1983 plotted in Figure 14
though these models may contradict the observation of the gas content as stated
The threshold models show sporadic starbursts when the gas density is nearly equal
to the threshold density This makes the contours of SF RM at the present epoch very
irregular on the  M plane Comparison with the observation is not straightforward
Although the model galaxy exhibits starbursts it is premature to conclude that the galaxy
really experiences a burst A real galaxy will be described as a sum of a number of local
regions over each of which coherence of evolution is maintained The present multi-zone
model treats one particular region as the representative one and traces its time evolution
In other words this modelling does not take into account existence of many local regions
which evolve more or less independently In real galaxies random behavior or phase
dierence of individual regions will smear out starbursts taking place in local regions and
a global starburst will not be realized unless evolution of many regions is cynchronized by
some mechanism
63 Formation Epoch of Bulges
Figure 20 indicates the epoch of bulge formation tbulge Here tbulge is dened to be
the epoch at which half the nal bulge mass has been accumulated The bulge formation
epoch in all the calculated models becomes earlier as the mass andor the density of the
galaxy increases The BT ratio is anticorrelated with the formation epoch roughly which
may agree with the observed decrease of the MgFe ratio as the bulge becomes fainter
Jablonka et al 1996 and the preponderance of irregular bulges in late-type spirals Carollo
et al 1997 A good positive correlation is found between tbulge and  Because  also
determines the major epoch of disk formation this correlation may explain the similarity
in colors between the bulge and the disk in many spiral galaxies observed by Peletier and
Balcells 1996
The age of the bulge indicated in Figure 19 may be argued to be too large especially
for less massive andor less dense galaxies The present multi-zone model cannot make
 27 
allowance for the likely variation of the collapse timescale at dierent radii in the galaxy
The value of  should be regarded as a kind of average over the entire disk and tends to
overestimate the actual accretion timescale in the inner disk which contributes to the bulge
formation much This limitation presumably leads to an overestimate of tbulge Anyway
measured age dierence between the bulge and the disk in a galaxy will depend strongly on
how extended part of the disk is considered because of a large dierence of the accretion
timescale at dierent radii in the disk component
7 Discussion
It has been demonstrated that the clumpy evolution model can reproduce the observed
variation of the bulge-to-disk ratio among spiral galaxies for a wide range of possibility which
will encompass the real situation Nevertheless the quality of the available observational
data and the limitation in the theoretical modelling seem to hamper further narrowing of
the parameter range Here I discuss a few implications of the present study and limitations
of the models
71 Appearance of Primeval Disk Galaxies
Only few studies have explored what primeval galaxies might really look like eg Meier
1976 Baron and White 1987 Katz 1992 Theoretical predictions on appearance of young
galaxies are becoming increasingly important because direct observations of high-redshift
galaxies enabled by HST and other new instruments start to provide powerful constraints
on theoretical evolutionary models from morphological and dynamical viewpoints
The CDM cosmogony predicts clumpy appearance of primeval galaxies as a direct
Indeed Baron and White 1987 demonstrate by
consequence of dominant small-scale density perturbations imposed on the matter
distribution in the early universe
numerical simulations that a young elliptical galaxy should not be observed as a bright
single body but as a conglomeration of several discrete blobs connected by a common faint
envelope Katzs1992 dissipational formation model for a spiral galaxy including star
formation process also produces clumpy appearance at high redshift because of imposed
initial density perturbations In this case the clumps form during the collapse of the galaxy
In contrast to these CDM-based simulations the clumps advocated in the present
study have no causal relationship with initial density perturbations in the universe The
clumpy nature of primeval disk galaxies in the present model originates in the gravitational
 28 
instability of gas-rich galactic disks formed in the early phase of disk galaxy evolution It
is encouraging that HST and large ground-based telescopes have recently found clumpy
structures in a number of high-redshift galaxies although they may be manifestation of
CDM clumps The number of clumps contained in one object is a few usually though this
number may be severely aected by the spatial resolution and the surface brightness limit
of the instrument used Even chain galaxies eg Cowie et al 1995 which are elongated
objects containing several bright blobs may be primeval disk galaxies viewed edge-on in
which the clumps scattered in the disk component are viewed within the projected disk plane
Another possibility is suggested by Dalcanton and Shectman 1996 that they represent
edge-on low surface brightness galaxies Head-tail systems called tadpole galaxies by
van den Bergh et al1996 may not be a rectilinear object but edge-on manifestation of a
clumpy disk in which one of several clumps is particularly large
Another possible evidence for clumpy structures other than from direct imaging comes
from the analysis of correlation functions Infante et al 1996 found for galaxies with the
average redshift of  z  035 a discontinuity of the correlation function at the separation
of  6 arcsec This suggests strong clustering of faint galaxies within  20 kpc of individual
galaxies which may be caused by clumping in a single galactic disk Because the mean
redshift of their sample is relatively small it is desirable to extend similar analysis into a
larger redshift
One caveat in interpreting images of distant galaxies is that morphology of objects at
large redshift is strongly inuenced by k-correction and the steep dependence of surface
brightness on redshift of the form 1  z5 Bohlin et al 1991 and Giavalisco et al
1996a have cautioned that those clumpy structures observed in medium to high redshift
galaxies may not be the features characteristic of early evolution phases but simply be an
exaggerated manifestation of the irregular distributions of star forming regions such as
observed in some galaxies usually of late types in the local universe
Interactions or mergers with smaller satellite galaxies are sometimes invoked in the
interpretation of peculiar appearance of high redshift galaxies eg Griths et al 1994 van
den Bergh et al 1996 The most straightforward and powerful test to discriminate between
the instability hypothesis proposed here and the mergerinteraction scenario is to examine
the kinematics of satellites In the mergerinteraction scenario we expect random
orientation of clump orbits relative to the primary because there is no reason to consider
that the bombardment of other galaxies from outside has any preferred geometry with
respect to the primary On the other hand it is inevitable in the present scenario that
the motions of satellites are co-planar and all the satellites rotate in the same direction
around a common center Spectroscopic observations will provide a direct check

72 Creation of the Bulge-Disk Structure
The traditional Hubble classication scheme is based on three morphological
characteristics prominence of the bulge relative to the disk the pitch angle of the spiral
arms and the degree of resolution of the arms into stars  Sandage 1961 However Sandage
et al 1970 argue that the most fundamental parameter distinguishing between dierent
Hubble types is the relative gas content presumed to have been determined at the time of
formation Yoshizawa  Wakamatsu 1975 found that the relative prominence of the disk
and bulge components is well correlated with the morphological type and argue that disk
galaxies are specied quantitatively by both the bulge-to-disk ratio as a morphological
indicator and the luminosity of the disk as a scale indicator Van den Bergh 1976
has proposed a two-dimensional classication scheme in which the bulge-to-disk ratio and
the gas content are independent parameters with the former determined by the formation
process while the latter changeable due to environmental factors These propositions are
however made on more-or-less phenomenological grounds and do not always address in
what manner these fundamental quantities such as the gas content and the bulge-to-disk
ratio have been determined in the evolution of a particular galaxy More systematic and
quantitative attempts include application of the principal component analysis to determine
the number of independent parameters dening galaxies Brosche 1973 and other groups
have concluded that just two dimensions could explain most of the observed diversity in
spiral galaxies
Dynamical study of the formation and evolution process of galaxies has a long history
eg Eggen et al 1962 One of the most important goals in this area is to understand
origins of the observed variety of galaxies A series of numerical works carried out by Larson
1969 1974 1975 1976 stand out as a landmark in the theoretical galactic astronomy
In his models the formation of a disk galaxy proceeds in two stages characterized by star
formation processes that operate at very dierent rates First there is a rapid star formation
process that forms a spheroidal component and later a much slower star formation permits
most of the residual gas to condense into a disk before it is consumed by star formation
Larson 1976 envisages two possibilities as the cause of the reduction of the star formation
eciency after the bulge formed which is required for the formation of a signicant disk
component The rst is inhibition of star formation by the tidal force exerted on the gas
clouds by the already existing bulge Second possibility is that the protogalactic gas has a
two-phase structure with dense clouds that rapidly form stars in a spheroidal component
and less dense intercloud gas which does not form stars until it has settled to a disk He
has also prescribed turbulent viscosity which is large in the early phase of evolution when
the bulge grows but is reduced in later phases in order to get distinct separation between
the disk and the bulge Using these settings Larson 1976 has reached to the conclusion
 30 
that the bulge-to-disk ratio depends mostly on the star formation rate which is in turn
controlled by the initial density or velocity dispersions in protogalaxies
In marked contrast with Larsons 1976 model the present study proposes a more
disordered and chaotic formation of disk galaxies The dominance of massive subgalactic
clumps and resulting dynamical processes constitute the main ingredient of the present
model The bulge is assembled from those clumps formed by the local gravitational
instability in the disk component The model appears not to require two star formation
processes operating at dierent timescales unlike the models constructed by Larson 1976
though more realistic simulations would be necessary to establish this point In the present
model the clumpy nature of the young gas-rich disk provides the required viscosity to form
a bulge eg Lin and Pringle 1987 Larson 1976 had to introduce viscosity a priori
because the axisymmetry of the conguration imposed on his models could not allow radial
transport of angular momentum by non-axisymmetric perturbations such as clumps bars
and spiral arms Although the present study stresses the secondary nature of the galactic
bulges this does not mean that the whole disk has formed before the bulge as repeatedly
cautioned Only inner parts of the disk contribute to bulge formation and outer parts are
considered to form much later than the bulge by a slow accretion of the primordial gas
from the outer halo In this respect the present scenario is not so drastically dierent from
Larsons 1976 model as it might seem
73 Longevity of Clumps
The present study stresses the importance of heavy clumps formed in the early galactic
disks in driving long-term disk galaxy evolution Therefore the longevity of these clumps
is a key factor of the present model Although the present study takes into account the
contribution from the formed clumps of all the mass scales it may be considered that
clumps with smaller masses are prone to destruction in general The possible destruction
processes include energy injection from internal star formation and tidal destruction due
to the galaxy gravitational eld Strong concentration of the gas clouds into narrow spiral
arms observed in nearby galaxies points to relatively short lifetimes for those clouds For
example the giant molecular clouds  with masses of  106M are considered to have a
lifetime shorter than a few times 108yr  perhaps due to energy deposit from young massive
stars born in them Even giant molecular associations GMAs with estimated masses of
several times 107M seem to be transient Rand  Kulkarni 1990 found that GMAs in
the inter-arm regions of M51 are gravitationally unbound and argued that they may be
disrupting due to tidal shearing by the background gravitational eld of the galaxy If this
 31 
is correct the estimated lifetime of these GMAs is several times 108 yr The present model
sometimes develops clumps with masses of 1089M Fate of these extremely massive
clumps is not clear because they are absent from nearby ie present-day galaxies Such
clumps may also suer from disintegration
Then is the treatment in the present study totally unrealistic Answer is probably No
Assuming that a clump of any mass has a nite lifetime probably depending on its internal
structure and the strength of the external tidal eld the interstellar gas in real galaxies
will be circulated through dierent phases as follows First  a group of clumps will be
formed owing to gravitational instability in the gas disk Untill these clumps are destroyed
by some mechanism they will feel dynamical frictions and move inward to the galactic
center When the clumps are destroyed clump material is dispersed into the interstellar
space and the inow driven by dynamical friction stops However after a certain period a
new generation of clumps are formed from this diuse material by gravitational instability
and they resume inward motion Actually this recycling will not be a coherent process over
the entire galactic disk but every local region in the disk will experience recycling with its
own phase independently of each other
The numerical simulation described in 2 and 3 diers from the situation considered
here despite that it does include energy feedback from star formation events in a simple
form The massive clumps formed in the numerical model maintain their identity untill
they merge with other clumps or they are swallowed by the bulge On the other hand the
analytical multi-component models presented in 4 seem to better t in with the circulation
picture of the interstellar medium They calculate the typical mass of clumps from the
instantaneous gas surface density Therefore the clump mass is changing as a function of
time In other words the models do not assume the identity of each clump for the whole
period of galaxy evolution Then those analytic models provide a fairly good description of
actual situation provided that the average lifetime of clumps is a signicant fraction of the
whoel period of one circulation cycle
74 Undiscussed Issues
The present study has mainly discussed a limited range of the whole family of spiral
galaxies namely from type Sa to Sc These galaxies occupy the upper right half of the
 M plane employed here Compared with these galaxies relatively little is known about
galaxies later than Sc which occupy the lower left part of the  M diagram The present
study may provide an interesting implication for these galaxies as stated in 61 but it will
be treated in a separate paper
 32 
Another issue which may be related to the problem of extremely late galaxies is the
evolutionary status of the low surface brightness galaxies Recent observations have been
providing a mounting evidence that the realm of galaxies is actually dominated by very
faint galaxies which have eluded past observations The universality of the disk central
surface brightness Freeman 1970 is turning out to be due to selection eect and those
galaxies with a central brightness fainter than  23B mag arcsec2 which are often called
low surface brightness LSB galaxies Impey and Bothun 1997 and references therein
may occupy as much as half the total galaxy population LSB galaxies tend to be of a late
morphological type Schombert et al 1992 though early-type analogues are sometimes
observed Sprayberry et al 1995 One possibility is that most LSB galaxies represent a
continuation of disk galaxies into morphological types later than Sd and Sm Protogalactic
systems with a high angular momentum andor a low mass are suggested to be precursors
of LSB galaxies Dalcanton et al 1997 Global characteristics of LSB galaxies have been
investigated intensively in recent years eg de Blok et al 1995 de Blok et al 1996 de Blok
and McGaugh 1997 Most LSB galaxies appear to lack any signicant bulge component
However interestingly enough Sprayberry et al 1995 report several giant LSB galaxies
possessing a large bulge component
It is not clear at present how these LSB galaxies can be incorporated into the galaxy
evolution model proposed here Since the present model is a model of bulge formation
largely more detailed information on the bulge-to-disk ratio for LSB galaxies is necessary
to examine whether the present model can accomodate the class of LSB galaxies as its part
or not
8 Conclusions
Collapse of a protogalaxy composed of dark matter and primordial gas has been
investigated by numerical simulations and analytical multi-zone modelling in an attempt
to examine early evolution of disk galaxies Importance of the ample interstellar matter
existing in young galactic disks has been highlighted Confrontation of the theoretical
results with the available observational data has led to a new picture for disk galaxy
evolution in which the bulge is the secondary object formed from disk matter
As the protogalaxy collapses a gaseous disk starts to form Very few stars form before
the disk formation because the gas density is low The formation of the disk causes drastic
increase in the gas density and initiates star formation process The galactic disk in early
evolution phases is rich in the interstellar gas and the ecient energy dissipation keeps the
disk dynamically cold Then the gravitational instability sets in leading to the formation
 33 
of massive clumps rotating in the disk plane The individual mass of these clumps can
be as large as  109M Intense star formation occurs in these clumps Therefore the
galaxy at this epoch exhibits a clumpy and irregular appearance in optical wavelengths
which may give explanation of morphologically peculiar galaxies observed at high redshift
While orbiting in the disk plane the clumps tend to merge with each other and make
successively larger clumps The clumps loose their orbital kinetic energy through dynamical
friction against surrounding stars and gas clouds and accumulate to the central region
thus forming a spheroidal bulge The collapse timescale of the protogalaxy will be larger
in its outer parts Slower accretion of the primordial gas is considered to have established
outer parts of the disk after the bulge formation is mostly nished
Simple analytical models have been constructed in which a disk galaxy is described as
a multi-component system comprising a dark halo gaseous and stellar disks and a bulge
Evolution of these components is controlled by two parameters the accretion timescale
ie the rapidness with which the primordial gas contained in the halo region accretes to
the disk plane and the mass fraction of the primordial gas at the beginning Based on the
observational evidence the accretion timescale in real spiral galaxies has been assumed
to be a decreasing function of both the galaxy mass and the galaxy density whereas the
fraction of the primordial gas has been assumed to increase as the galaxy mass andor the
galaxy density increases Under this specication the analytical modelling of the clumpy
galaxy evolution picture has succeeded in reproducing the observational result that a galaxy
having a large total mass andor a large internal density tends to have a large bulge-to-disk
ratio which is established at least for the morphology range of Sa to Sc This success
suggests importance of the clumpy evolution in young disk galaxies though the evolution
of real spiral galaxies may be a more complicated process comprising several fundamentally
dierent mechanisms
 34 
NUMERICAL EVALUATION OF SINKING TIMESCALE OF A CLUMP
A massive body orbiting in the disk component of a galaxy spirals in to the galactic
center by the action of dynamical friction The timescale of this inward motion of the clump
has been evaluated by numerical simulations as follows Parameters of each simulation are
listed in Table 1
N-body models for a disk galaxy which consists of a halo and a disk have been
constructed rst The models contain no interstellar gas Here the halo is not meant to
represent the entire dark halo which might surround the visible galaxy but the portion
of the dark halo inside the optical radius plus any luminous spheroidal components such as
a bulge The total mass of the galaxy is unity and the mass of the disk component is md
Both components are truncated at the galactocentric radius of unity The halo and the disk
are constructed by 5000 and 50000 collisionless particles respectively The gravitational
softening radius is 004 and 002 for the halo and disk particles respectively
The model is fundamentally based on Fall  Efstathiou 1980 The stellar disk has
an exponential surface density distribution with a scale length of 025 in agreement with
observations The disk rotates nearly rigidly in the inner parts and at a nearly constant
velocity in the outer parts The turn-over radius which divides these two parts is denoted
by rm Thus the global shape of the rotation curve is determined by specifying rm The halo
is assumed to be spherically symmetric and its volume density distribution is determined
so that the rotational velocity in the disk plane due to the combined gravitational eld of
the halo and the disk matches the specied rotation curve
The velocity dispersion of the halo is chosen as follows First the isotropic velocity
dispersion at each radius is calculated so that the condition for local virial equilibrium is
satised everywhere see Noguchi 1991 for details A trial simulation showed that such a
condition does not lead to virial equilibrium for the entire system In order to alleviate this
the velocity dispersion was multiplied by a factor of 065
This disk galaxy model is evolved in isolation before the sinking simulations First
only the halo component is evolved for 15 dynamical times with the disk component xed
After the halo is relaxed the disk is activated At this time the gravitational force acting
on each disk particle is calculated and the circular velocity is given to that particle so that
the centrifugal force is exactly balanced with the gravity Next small random velocities are
given to disk particles  which correspond to a specied Q parameter of Toomre 1964
The rotational velocity of each star is then corrected for the contribution from this random
motion This state just after the activation of the disk is adopted as the initial condition
for the disk galaxy in the sinking simulations
 35 
The clump is treated as a particle which has a mass mcl and a gravitational softening
radius of rs which is regarded as the eective radius of the clump The mass and radius of
the clump given in Table 1 are also in units of those of the disk galaxy The clump starts
at the galactocentric radius r  08 in the disk plane The initial velocity is that of the
circular motion and the orbital motion is in the same direction as the disk rotation This
initial condition is appropriate for the clumps formed from the disk material A number
of simulations have been carried out by varying md mcl rm and Q Each simulation
is performed untill the galactocentric radius of the clump decreases to 02 Epoch of
this moment is taken to be the dynamical friction timescale f ri and listed in Table 1
Gravitational interactions between all the particles have been calculated by the tree code
eg Barnes and Hut 1986 and the orbit integration has been done by the leap-frog
scheme with a time step of 001 ie one hundredth of the dynamical timescale A time
step of 0015 was used in the halo relaxation phase
 36 
Table 1
Timescale of dynamical-friction induced sinking
rs002
rs002
rs004
aThe timescale f ri is the time it takes the clump to move from r  08 to r  02 and its unit is the
dynamical time of the galaxy
bThe eective radius of the clump rs is 007 unless specied

probability for the null hypothesis of zero correlation P  are indicated
Fig 10 Distribution of galaxies with dierent morphological types on the  M plane
The galaxy sample is taken from Dale et al 1997 The ordinate indicates the mass M of
the galaxy inside the optical radius in units of M whereas the abscissa indicates the density
 within the optical radius in units of Mpc3 The dashed lines specify the constancy of
the surface density dened by   MR2 where the mass M is in units of M and the
optical radius R is in units of parsec
Fig 11 Mass fraction of the interstellar gas realtive to the total matter inside the optical
radius of the galaxy The galaxy sample is taken from Young et al 1989 The ordinate
indicates the mass M of the galaxy inside the optical radius in units of M whereas the
abscissa indicates the density  within the optical radius in units of Mpc3 Here the
interstellar gas means the sum of the molecular gas and the atomic gas The area of the
circle is proportional to the gas mass fraction Dotted circles mean upper limits in either
molecular mass or atomic mass
Fig 12 Same as Figure 11 but for the sample by Sage 1993 Dotted circles mean upper
limits in molecular mass
Fig 13 Star formation rate for the sample of spiral galaxies compiled by Kennicutt 1983
Only galaxies with type Sa to Sc are plotted The ordinate indicates the mass M of the
galaxy inside the optical radius in units of M whereas the abscissa indicates the density
 within the optical radius in units of Mpc3 The data used to calculate the mass and
the density are taken from RC3 de Vaucouleurs et al 1991 Crosses which correspond to
Sa galaxies mostly mean non detection of measurable star formation activity Breakdown
of the whole sample by the SFR in units of Myr1 is given in other ve panels
Fig 14 Same as Figure 13 but for the specic star formation rate SFRM for the
sample of spiral galaxies compiled by Kennicutt 1983 Only galaxies with type Sa to Sc
are plotted Here the specic SFR is dened to be the star formation rate divided by the
galaxy mass M inside the optical radius and its unit is yr1 Crosses which correspond
to Sa galaxies mostly mean non detection of measurable star formation activity
Fig 15 The accretion timescale  and the mass fraction of the primordial gas  in the
analytical multi-zone models The model name see text for explanation is indicated in the
upper right corner of each panel The ordinate indicates the mass M of the galaxy inside
the optical radius in units of M whereas the abscissa indicates the density  within the
optical radius in units of Mpc3 The dotted contours correspond to 1 2 3 4 and 5
Gyr from the thinnest to progressively thicker lines in all the panels The solid contours
 45 
correspond to  025 03 035 04 and 045 from the thinnest to progressively thicker
lines in all the panels
Fig 16 Same as Figure 15 but for the ratio of the bulge mass to the total luminous mass
at the present epoch dened by BT  mbmb  ms where mb and ms are masses of the
bulge and the disk respectively The contours are for logBT-05 -075 -10 -125 and
-15 from the thickest to progressively thinner lines in all the panels
Fig 17 The bulge-to-luminous mass ratio BT plotted against the accretion timescale
 in Gyr for each model
Fig 18 Same as Figure 15 but for the ratio of the gas mass to the total galaxy mass
mgM at the present epoch The contours are for mgM0001 0002 0004 0008 0016
0032 and 0064 from the thinnest to progressively thicker lines in all the panels
Fig 19 Same as Figure 15 but for the ratio of the star formation rate to the total galaxy
mass SF RM at the present epoch The contours are for SF RM 05 1 2 4 8 16
32 641012yr1 from the thinnest to progressively thicker lines in all the panels
Fig 20 Same as Figure 15 but for the epoch of bulge formation tbulge which is dened
to be the epoch where the bulge mass reached to half of the present value The contours are
for tbulge 1 2 3 4 and 6 Gyr from the thinnest to progressively thicker lines in all the
panels
