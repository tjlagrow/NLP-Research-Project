Abstract
A provocative summary of the conference on gGalaxy Mergers in an
Evolving Universeh is presented The conference includes the following issues 1
Mergers at low redshift 2 Merger dynamics and numerical simulations 3 Mergers
in galaxy evolution 4 Mergers and active galactic nuclei AGNs 5 Mergers at high
redshift and submm galaxies 6 Feedback from starbursts and AGNs 6 Chemical evo-
lution of galaxies and 7 Results from new surveys Although there are many important
issues related to galaxy mergers and nuclear activities in galaxies in this summary l et
us focus on following the question Is there any unied model for triggering nuclear ac-
tivities  Given key observational properties of galaxies with AGNs a possible unied
model is discussed as an evolutionary model from starbursts to AGNs based on minor
and major mergers betweenamong galaxies
Introduction
We observe galaxies with an active galactic nucleus AGN together with normal and
starburst galaxies in the local universe eg Ho et al 1997 AGNs are considered
to be powered by the gas accretion onto a supermassive black hole SMBH resided
in a nucleus of galaxies Rees 1984 In this respect such AGN phenomena are basi-
cally dierent from the ordinary evolution of galaxies that are governed by various star
formation history However it has been shown that the mass of SMBHs is well corre-
lated with that of the spheroidal component of galaxies bulges and elliptical galaxies
regardless of the presence of AGN phenomena eg Magorrian et al 1998 This sug-
gests strongly the co-evolution between SMBHs and galaxies although we have not yet
understood what physical processes play a key role
More importantly SMBHs are ubiquitously present in the nucleus of galaxies and
thus the AGN phenomena should be controlled by some triggering mechanism such as
gas fueling onto the SMBH This means that all AGN phenomena are transient pro-
cesses during the course of evolution of galaxies This is also advocated both by the
evolution of quasar luminosity function eg Boyle et al 1992 Ikeda et al 2011 and
references therein and by the so-called dead quasar problem Rees 1990
Another type of activity in nuclear regions of galaxies is starburst phenomena in
which more than 10000 massive stars are formed during a short time interval Balzano
1983 Since massive stars could provide compact objects such as neutron stars and
stellar-sized black holes it has been also discussed that there may some possible re-
lationships between starburst and AGN phenomena ie starburst-AGN connections
eg Taniguchi 2003 2004 Here we should remind that the starburst activity also
YoshiakiTaniguchi
needs some triggering mechanisms because a lot of dense gas must be accumulated
in the nuclear region of galaxies In fact the starburst is intrinsically dierent from
ordinary star formation in galactic disks Daddi et al 2010
In summary we have to consider various aspects when we investigate the evolution
of nuclear activities and chemical and dynamical properties of galaxies as a function of
the cosmic age see Fig 1 In this article however let us focus on the importance of
mergers of galaxies toward the understanding of triggering both starbursts and AGNs
Figure 1
A three-dimensional schematic summary of evolution of both starbursts
and AGNs during the course of galaxy evolution 1 There are a number of impor-
tant properties of galaxies such as the mass M luminosity L gas fraction  fgas
metallicity Z and so on
2 There are two distinct types of nuclear activities
AGNs and starbursts in addition to the normal phase of nuclei 3 It is reminded
that these two parameters the nuclear activities and the galaxy properties that are
denoted as factivity and fproperty respectively are functions of the cosmic age If the
AGN phenomena are in part related to the growth of SMBHs the co-evolution be-
tween SMBHs and galaxies is expected
2 Possible Unied Models for Triggering AGNs
In this summary we are interested in both starbursts and AGNs However for simplic-
ity we rst consider what a mechanism can trigger AGN phenomena and then how a
physical connection between starbursts and AGNs Therefore our questions are sum-
marized as follows
1 Why do some galaxies show AGN phenomena although almost all galaxies have
a SMBH in their nuclear regions 
2 Do galaxy mergers play an essentially important role for triggering them 
AProvocativeSummary
3 If the answer is yes how do they work 
In order to give possible answers for these questions let us start to adopt the fol-
lowing theorem
Theorem There is the unied model for triggering AGNs
This means the following scenario If an ordinary ie non-active galaxy has
a certain triggering mechanism it must inevitably evolve to a galaxy with an AGN
Namely we postulate that there is the only one triggering mechanism of AGNs see
Fig 2 Therefore the question is what the only one mechanism is

is the unied model
Always model vs Sometime model If there is an Always Model that
As possible triggering mechanisms for starbursts and AGNs the following items
have been discussed intensively see for a review Taniguchi 1999
1 Secular-evolution fueling in galactic disks
2 Bar-driven fueling
3 Minor-merger-driven fueling
YoshiakiTaniguchi
4 Galaxy-interaction-driven fueling
5 Major-merger-driven fueling
21 Triggering Seyfert Nuclei
First let us consider about Seyfert nuclei in the local universe because many observa-
tional properties have been investigated to date At this starting point of discussion we
can omit the major-merger-driven fueling that is considered to play an important role in
triggering ultraluminous infrared galaxies ULIRGs and quasars Sanders et al 1988
We shall come back to this mechanism later
First we can exclude the secular-evolution fueling Since if this is the case we
cannot specify when and how the Seyfert activity could be triggered this idea does not
t to any unied triggering mechanism
As described in Taniguchi 1999 both the bar-driven and interaction-driven fuel-
ing mechanisms also do not t The fraction of barred spiral galaxies is approximately
70 percent for normal and Seyfert galaxies In other word Seyfert galaxies do not show
preference of barred spirals As for the galaxy interaction only 10 percent of Seyfert
galaxies have their companion galaxies
Accordingly the minor-merger-driven fueling can remain as a possible unied
triggering mechanism for Seyfert activity Minor mergers have been often considered
as a plausible triggering mechanism for nuclear starbursts eg Mihos  Hernquist
1994 Taniguchi  Wada 1996 In particular minor mergers with a nucleated satellite
are expected to surely provide gas fueling very close toward a SMBH in nuclei of galax-
ies Since their tidal disturbance is usually weak it is often dicult to nd evidence
for minor mergers However the observed excess of ringed structures in Seyfert disks
and S0 or amorphous morphology of Seyfert hosts suggest past minor merger events in
them Another line of evidence for minor mergers is advocated by randomly-oriented
narrow-line regions with respect to the host disks in Seyfert galaxies Such properties
are naturally explained by an idea that the orbital plane of a dusty torus should be the dy-
namically preferred plane governed by the orbital motion of a merging satellite galaxy
Although these are not convincing pieces of evidence the minor-merger-driven fueling
can be appreciated as a plausible unied mechanism for triggering AGN Taniguchi
22 Triggering Quasars
Quasars are the most luminous class of AGNs whose luminosity exceeds 1012L Al-
though their origin has been mysterious for a long time the discovery of ULIRGs led
to the following formation mechanism major mergers between two gas-rich galaxies
could result in the formation of quasars through the phase of ultra luminous starbursts
Sanders et al 1988 This idea is also reinforced by disturbed morphology of quasar
host galaxies Bahcall et al 1995 Although some quasar hosts show undisturbed
morphology like elliptical galaxies they can also be interpreted as advanced mergers
Important physical processes involved in the major-merger scenario are considered
to be the growth of SMBHs The mass of SMBHs in typical disk galaxies may range
from 1 million to 10 million M However a typical mass of SMBHs in quasar nuclei
ranges from 100 million to 1 billion M Therefore the growth of SMBHs could be

helped by supply of a large number of compact objects as remnants of massive stars
formed in ultra luminous starbursts Taniguchi Ikeuchi  Shioya 1999
Another concern is how many galaxies merged into one to make a quasar At
least two gas-rich giant galaxies are necessary to possess a lot of cold molecular gas of
 1010 M Sanders et al 1988 In the local universe there are a number of compact
galaxies whose merging time scale is of order of 1 billion years Hickson 1982 They
are also likely precursors of quasars via ULIRGs Taniguchi  Shioya 1988
In summary one has the following scenario for the formation of quasars
Step 1 A major merger between or among gas-rich galaxies
Step 2 The formation of a ULIRG that helps the growth of a SMBH in the merger center
Step 3 The formation of quasar after the ULIRG phase
It should be noted that the major merger is the most important triggering mecha-
nism for the quasar formation In other word we need any other triggering mechanisms
here providing the unied formation mechanism of quasars
3 Possible Unied Models for Triggering AGNs An Evolutionary Unied Model
for the Starburst-AGN Connection
We have argued whether possible unied models can be available for the understanding
triggering both Seyferts and quasars in the two previous sections We have found that
the minor-merger-driven fueling provides only one mechanism for triggering Seyferts
while the major-merger one does that for triggering quasars In other word one can
postulate that only mergers can trigger the AGN activity regardless of their AGN lumi-
nosity
Here we remind for the case of quasars that the ultra luminous starburst phase
comes rst and then the quasar activity turns on in the nal phase of merger evolu-
tion We interpret this as that such starbursts are necessary to grow up a SMBH in a
merger center Taniguchi Ikeuchi  Shioya 1999 If this is also the case in triggering
Seyferts it is suggested that the so-called nuclear starburst phase comes rst and then
the Seyfert activity turns on Since it is known that such nuclear starbursts are induced
by minor mergers eg Mihos  Hernquist 1994 Taniguchi  Wada 1996 the above
suggestion seems to make sense
Accordingly one can have a merger-driven evolutionary unied model from the
starburst to the AGN This model is illustrated in Fig 3 see also Taniguchi Wada 
Murayama 1996

2 Bar-driven fueling never works
3 Minor-merger-driven fueling works for triggering Seyferts
4 Galaxy-interaction-driven fueling never works
5 Major-merger-driven fueling works for triggering quasars
One may feel that the above conclusions are somewhat drastic ones Actually non-
axisymmetric structure such as bars eg Shlosman et al 1989 Wada  Habe 1995
and non-axisymmetric perturbation such as galaxy interactions eg Noguchi 1988
have been often considered as viable gas fueling mechanisms in AGNs However one
serious physical diculty in such fueling mechanisms is that it is generally dicult
to reduce the angular momentum of disk gas  1 - 10 kpc scale toward the inner 
001 or 0001 pc around a SMBH eg Peterson 1997 This is the main reason why
we discard both the secular-evolution and the bar-driven fueling mechanisms in the
proposed unied model
In order to avoid the angular momentum problem we would like to note that minor
mergers with a nucleated satellite are more preferable because the satellite nucleus
surely can reach to the center of the host galaxy Taniguchi  Wada 1996 Note also
that Sanders et als scenario for the quasar formation postulates major mergers between
tow nucleated galaxies
In summary the unied model for triggering both starbursts and AGNs means
that any nuclear activities are due not to nature but to nurture
In other words if a
galaxy were isolated during the course of its evolution it did not have a SMBH and
thus never became to an AGN-hosting galaxy Nuclear starbursts too All nuclear
activities are driven by second events minor and major mergers in terms of the so-
called hierarchical clustering model of our universe
