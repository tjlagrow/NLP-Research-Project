Abstract We summarise recent Hubble Space Telescope results on the
morphology of faint cid12eld galaxies Our two principle results are  the
galaxies responsible for the faint blue excess have late-typeirregular mor-
phology and  the number counts of normal galaxies ellipticals and early-
type spirals are well cid12t by standard no-evolution models implying that the
giant population was in place and mature by a redshift of cid21 
 Introduction
One of the great leaps forward in the study of faint cid12eld galaxies and made
possible only by the Wide Field and Planetary Camera  WFPC on
board the Hubble Space Telescope HST is the ability to discern detailed
morphological information to faint magnitudes I cid20  The Medium
Deep Survey a key HST pro ject cf Gricid14ths et al  has exploited this
new area resulting in a number of recent morphology related publications
Casertano et al  Driver Windhorst  Gricid14ths  Driver et al
 Glazebrook et al  Here we briecid13y summarise and coalate some
of the key results from these papers and interpret them by comparison to
the predictions of some generic faint galaxy models We also discuss the
redshift dsitribution for Late-typeIrregulars which can now be directly
derived based on the mounting observational evidence that the giant
galaxies are not strongly evolving over the redshift range   z   cf

 Summary of the MDS morphology papers
Casertano et al  - Casertano analysed the entire WFPC database
 galaxies using an automated technique to classify the sample
into bulge dominated ES disk Dominated cid24 Sabcd or other sys-
tems MIrr The principle results are that at faint magnitudes  
  the number counts are dominated by very small disk systems
with a mean scale-length of cid24  arcseconds
Driver Windhorst  Griffiths  - A complete magnitude lim-
ited sample I
  of  cid12eld galaxies drawn from six MDS cid12elds
Classicid12cations are by eye into ellitpicals ES early-type spirals Sabc
and late-type spiralsIrregulars SdIrr At I
cid24  mag these three
populations are observed in almost equal proportions While the ESs
and Sabcs are well cid12t by conventional models the SdIrrs have about
 dex higher surface densisty than expected
Glazebrook et al  - A similar analysis to that above was made
independently based on a sample of  galaxies drawn from  MDS cid12elds
over a comparable magnitude range The cid12ndings are similar demonstrating
a robustness to the observational result
Driver et al  - The most recent survey based on a single ultradeep
HST cid12eld now totalling  orbits cf Windhorst - this conference and
Windhorst  Keel  The results concid12rmed the earlier work and cid12nd
that the galaxy counts beyond I    continue to become increasingly
dominated by SdIrrs see colour plate by Windhorst these proceedings

 Popular Generic Faint Galaxy Models
Recent popular models to explain the SdIrr counts are
DWARF MODELS eg Driver et al  - These exploit the uncer-
tainty in the space density of SdIrrs and increase the normalization and
slope of the SdIrr LF until an optimal cid12t is found Such models give good
cid12ts to the counts in all bands and can explain the trend to bluer colours at
fainter magnitudes The models typically fail to match the z-distribution
EVOLVING FLAT MODELS eg Broadhurst Ellis  Shanks 
- Assumes the LF for SdIrrs is an extrapolation of the luminous galax-
ies then luminosity evolution is invoked to match the counts The models
match the z-distributions but the luminosity evolution required to match
the counts is extreme cid24  mags in every SdIrr galaxy by z
MERGER MODELS eg Broadhurst Ellis  Glazebrook  - As
above except merging is invoked The merger rate required is extreme and
not seen in wcid18 The morphological data also fail to show the density of
close companions required That the ES and Sabc galaxies cid12t closely to
the no-evolution models argues against merging since if these were the
merger products they should be signicid12cantly rarer in the past
AN EVOLVING DWARF MODEL eg Phillipps  Driver  -
Essentially taking the best of the cid12rst two models its clear to see that a
good half-way solution should be found The data for SdIrrs show cid24 
 inert cid24   tidally disrupted and cid24   knotted cores spontaneous
starbursts  supporting all the above models to some extent This model
although contrived can cid12t all the counts and the z-distributions
Figure  A comparison of the above models to the inferred SdIrr redshift distribution
This distribution is derived by subtracting ocid11 the predicted distribution for ES and
Sabc assuming no evolution as implied by their counts from the total redshift distribu-
tion of Glazebrook et al

 Discussions Conclusions and Speculations
Perhaps the most far reaching gain is that now the culprits responsible
for the faint blue excess have been isolated we can return to the original
aim of number counts namely constraining cosmological models With the
mounting evidence that the ES and Sabc galaxies are largely in place by
z cid24  this aim becomes even more attainable Already the counts presented
here rule out any posibility of a large comsological constant cf Driver et
al  and thereby block the possiblity of using cid3 as a way out of the age
of the universe problem Nevertheless such analaysis is still fraught with
perils and most surprisingly it is our knowledge of the local environment
which provides the largest remaining obstacles

Questions
WHITE You showed us that your ES counts are consistent with no
evolution in an Einstein-de Sitter universe Are they also consistent with
no evolution in an open universe or with passive evolution in either 
DRIVER Weve explored all of these alternatives and conclude that enough
margin of error exists that we cannot rule for or against any of the models
you mentioned yet We can however rule out a cid3-dominated universe
WORTHEY Do you have a histogram of morphological type versus colour
DRIVER Yes but we cid12nd little or no correlation between type and colour
other than that few late-types are seen at red colours This may be due to
the poor range of the colour baseline V
