ABSTRACT
Chemical evolution of galaxies brings together ideas on stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis
with theories of galaxy formation star formation and galaxy evolution with all their associated
uncertainties
In a new perspective brought about by the Hubble Deep eld and follow-up
investigations of global star formation rates diuse background etc it has become necessary to
consider the chemical composition of dark baryonic matter as well as that of visible matter in
galaxies
Subject headings galaxies nucleosynthesis stellar evolution abundances
Introduction
The seeds of an idea of galactic chemical evo-
lution were planted by Sir Fred Hoyle a long time
ago Hoyle 1946
In the ensuing half century
those seeds have grown and proliferated like a
cashew-nut tree with many roots and branches
some rmer than others but it is not a ma-
ture subject in the sense that say stellar evolu-
tion is with the basic ideas well understood and
steady progress being made on the basis of previ-
ous knowledge There is still a lot of guesswork
involved in the physics of star formation and the
very origin of galaxies like our own depends on an
as yet unknown balance between monolithic col-
lapse Eggen Lynden-Bell  Sandage 1962 ac-
cretion of dwarf galaxies Searle  Zinn 1978 hi-
erarchical clustering White  Rees 1978 merg-
ers Toomre 1977 inows and outows These
issues were already raised in the classic conference
proceedings edited by Tinsley  Larson 1977
Ingredients of chemical evolution mod-
A chemical evolution model needs to put to-
gether at least 5 ingredients
21 Stellar yields
Starting with Arnett 1978 and Renzini  Voli
1981 there have been numerous systematic in-
vestigations of stellar element production and ejec-
tion as a function of the initial mass and chemical
composition of the star The broad outlines are
clear but not the details massive stars explode
as core-collapse supernovae but above some mass
limit which could be of the order of 50M the
outer layers may fall back into a black hole re-
ducing or eliminating ejection into the interstel-
lar medium ISM Such stars will however have
ejected signicant amounts of helium and carbon
at earlier stages in stellar winds Maeder 1992
Uncertainties arise from the 12C  16O reac-
tion rate the treatment of convection and mass
loss the explosion mechanism and the mass cut
which is put in by hand to get a Ye-value appropri-
ate for the observed composition of the iron group
Woosley  Weaver 1995 Thielemann et al 1996
The bulk of the iron group say 23 in the Solar
System comes however from thermonuclear su-
pernovae Type Ia consisting of a white dwarf that
explodes after accreting matter from a companion
Thielemann et al 1986 Currently departures
from spherical symmetry are being investigated
Similar uncertainties apply to intermediate-
mass stars which are responsible for a signi-
cant part of nitrogen and 13C and for the main
s-process van den Hoek  Groenewegen 1997
Marigo Bressan  Chiosi 1998 Gallino et al
Talbot  Arnett 1974 introduced the distinc-
tion between primary and secondary nucleosyn-
thesis products according as the yields were insen-
sitive or sensitive to the composition of the pro-
genitor star There is little abundance evidence for
secondary behaviour among many elements for
which it was once expected eg s-process but
carbon displays secondary-like behaviour not be-
cause of its nuclear progenitors but because higher
metallicity favours stronger stellar winds Gustafs-
son et al 1999 Nitrogen while behaving as a
primary element in low-metallicity H ii regions
shows a gradually increasing NO ratio that -
nally increases even more steeply than a secondary
element because of its dependence on the quasi-
secondary carbon Henry et al 2000
22 The initial mass function
The overall yield from a generation of stars1
depends on the initial mass function IMF rst
investigated by Salpeter 1955 Many references
to the Salpeter function nowadays refer explicitly
or implicitly to a function with the Salpeter slope
extending to 01M at the low-mass end which
is neither accurate nor any part of what Salpeter
originally claimed While investigations of eld
stars in the solar neighbourhood have led to sig-
nicantly steeper functions at the high mass end
Scalo 1986 extragalactic studies almost invari-
ably conrm Salpeters slope above 1M or so
eg Madau et al 1996 This leads to some in-
triguing consequences for galactic chemical evo-
lution models as the full Salpeter function ex-
tending between 01 and 100M say leads to
an overall yield around 2Z too high for the so-
lar neighbourhood modellers using that function
then either adopt a still lower low-mass trunca-
tion andor assume an upper limit of 50M or
less to stars that become supernovae more mas-
sive stars locking themselves in black holes The
Miller-Scalo and Scalo functions do not need this
device but their lower overall yield has a problem
explaining the metallicity of X-ray gas in clusters
of galaxies
Is the IMF invariable As there is no real the-
ory the question is wide open but it is of interest
to explore how much can be explained on the basis
1Dened as the mass of elements freshly produced and
ejected by a generation of stars divided by the mass re-
maining as long-lived stars or compact remnants Searle 
Sargent 1972
that it is apart from random realizations of an un-
derlying universal function In this spirit Pagel 
Tautvaisiene 1998 have attempted to model the
chemical evolution of the Magellanic Clouds on the
basis of identical yields to those prevailing in the
solar neighbourhood regardless of what particular
combination of stellar yields and IMF is responsi-
ble for them rather than blame their low metal-
licities on a steeper or more bottom-heavy IMF
Observations tend to favour a universal Salpeter
slope above some critical mass below which it at-
tens or turns over that critical mass may or may
not be variable Elmegreen 2000
23 Star formation rates
Schmidt 1959 proposed a star formation law
depending on a power between 1 and 2 of the
volume or surface density of gas such laws have
been used in many models and can give a good
account of the distribution of gas density and
abundances in the Milky Way eg Matteucci 
Francois 1989 especially when some form of self-
regulation is incorporated in the coecients Do-
pita  Ryder 1994  In dwarf and starburst galax-
ies on the other hand star formation often occurs
in sporadic bursts perhaps involving both nega-
tive and positive feedback mechanisms Kenni-
cutt 1998 has given observational evidence for
an overall correlation of star formation rates with
the surface density of H i with a denite threshold
of order a few M pc2 which may be related to
dynamical stability criteria and this idea has been
used by Chiappini Matteucci  Gratton 1997 to
account for the hiatus in star formation that ap-
pears to have occurred between the formation of
the thick and thin disks
24 Stellar populations
One issue that has to be addressed most no-
tably in modelling the Milky Way is the relation-
ship between dierent stellar populations  the
halo the bulge the thick disk and the thin disk
To what extent have they evolved concurrently
either in space or in time successively or inde-
pendently Partly because of angular momentum
considerations Wyse  Gilmore 1992 opinion
has veered away from the older idea of a tempo-
ral succession halo thick disk thin disk Burk-
ert Truran  Hensler 1992 towards the view that
the halo and disks evolved independently gas lost
from the halo ending up in the bulge or the inter-
galactic medium The thick disk is old and pre-
ceded the thin one but with a considerable hia-
tus Fuhrmann 1998 either because of the above-
mentioned threshold eect or because of a merger
which led to the thickening of the disk in the rst
Interaction with other galaxies and
the intergalactic medium
Since the pioneering paper by Larson 1972 it
has become clear that inow of relatively unpro-
cessed material is potentially an important factor
notably in helping to solve the notorious G-dwarf
problem see below and it was also Larson who
developed models of terminal galactic winds to ac-
count for the luminosity-metallicity relation and
predicted the presence of heavy elements in intra-
cluster gas Larson  Dinerstein 1975 More re-
cent chemo-dynamical models also take into ac-
count the multi-phase structure of the ISM with
stellar ejecta supplying the hot medium and fresh
stars forming in the cool one Samland Hensler 
Theis 1997
3 What have we learned from observa-
31 The G-dwarf problem
Sometimes dismissed as a little local di-
culty the G-dwarf problem van den Bergh 1962
Schmidt 1963 Pagel  Patchett 1975 Lynden-
Bell 1975 has proved to be a severe constraint on
chemical evolution models not only in the solar
neighbourhood but in elliptical galaxies Bressan
et al 1994 Worthey et al 1996 and the Mag-
ellanic Clouds Cole et al 2000 as well The
problem is that in all these cases there is a narrow
distribution of metallicity MDF whereas naive
concepts of chemical evolution lead to the expec-
tation of a broad one Such a narrow distribution
probably helped to hold up the abandonment of
the idea of a universal cosmic abundance distri-
bution cf Sandage 2000 and it also explains
why stellar population synthesis models assuming
just a single metallicity SSPs have been quite
successful  more so than models incorporating
chemical evolution up to now These models are
gradually becoming more rened often with an
indication of a bimodal metallicity distribution
Maraston  Thomas 2000 which may be under-
standable as a consequence of mergers Closely
related to the G-dwarf problem is the lack of
a single clear age-metallicity relation in the so-
lar neighbourhood explainable only in part by
the mixing of populations from dierent galacto-
centric distances evolving on dierent time-scales
Edvardsson et al 1993
The MDF is broader in the Galactic bulge and
broader still in the halo with an apparently higher
yield at least for -elements in the former case
and a lower one in the latter where a modied
Simple model assuming outow actually ts the
MDF rather well Hartwick 1976 If the outow
went into the bulge that might give an explana-
tion for its higher apparent yield on the lines of the
concentration model of Lynden-Bell 1975 and
the models of elliptical galaxy formation by Larson
1976 The halo MDF is becoming well known
from the heroic eorts of Beers et al 1998 and
it ts the modied Simple model down to about
FeH  3 below that it falls short and below
4 there are 2 stars or less when nearly 10 might
have been expected
If signicant this discrep-
ancy could indicate the presence of a distinct Pop-
ulation III of massive stars only or it could merely
be the result of low-mass stars being formed in the
neighbourhood of exploding supernovae for which
there is other evidence see below
32 Abundance patterns
Abundance ratios are a better clock than
metallicities themselves however dened The
-rich eect Wallerstein 1962 and the OFe
enhancement Gasson  Pagel 1966 Conti et al
1967 are a steady function of metallicity in the
thin disk reaching more or less a plateau in the
thick disk and halo and attributed to the dimin-
ishing contribution of SNIa to the elements in
increasingly old stars Wheeler Sneden  Tru-
ran 1989 There is currently controversy as to
whether OFe actually has a plateau or rises
steadily with diminishing FeH Israelian et al
1999 Boesgaard et al 1999 Fulbright  Kraft
1999 Numerical GCE models predict a steeper
rise in ratios like MgFe than is observed but
this depends on assumptions about SNII yields
that may be invalid and the predicted slope is
reduced in any case when nite mixing times are
taken into account Thomas Greggio  Bender
1999 Complications in this pattern have been
found in two respects i some halo stars have
more solar-like Fe ratios than do thick-disk stars
and other halo stars at the same FeH Nissen 
Schuster 1997 maybe because they came from
more slowly evolving dwarf galaxies like the Mag-
ellanic Clouds which show a similar pattern and
ii the -rich pattern persists among thick-disk
stars right up to solar metallicity
indicating a
fast-evolving get rich quick population which
may extend into the bulge2 and a hiatus with no
star formation just delayed iron-group production
combined with some dilution of overall metallicity
before the rst stars of the thin disk were formed
Fuhrmann 1998 Gratton et al 2000
The time-delay model for Fe eects comes
up against some diculties in the case of elliptical
galaxies where there is a very well-marked corre-
lation between Mg2 and velocity dispersion but a
less well marked one for iron features Worthey
Faber  Gonzales 1992 This should imply a
faster star formation time-scale for larger galax-
ies which is hard to understand on the basis of
either monolithic or hierarchical clustering mod-
els Thomas  Kaumann 1999
At very low metallicities like FeH  3 just
where the modied Simple model MDF is break-
ing down new abundance patterns emerge with
a large scatter in rFe and other ratios indicating
the inuence of individual supernovae Ryan et al
1996 McWilliam 1997 One bonus from this is
the case of CS 22892052 with low metallicity and
enhanced r-process enabling a credible thorium
chronology to be applied Cowan et al 1999 The
incidence of this scatter is consistent with the view
that stars are formed in globular-cluster sized su-
perbubbles of the order of 105M dominated by
output from a single supernova 2M of oxygen
if the oxygen mass fraction in the ISM is under
2  105 ie 2  103 of solar As the metallicity
of the ISM increases the inuence of an individ-
ual supernova is diluted and there is a semblance of
smooth chemical evolution Tsujimoto Shigeyama
 Yoshii 1999
2The get-rich-quick nature of the M 31 bulge was already
noted by Baade 1963 as Rich 2000 has recently re-
minded us
4 Metal supply to the intra-cluster medium
Hot X-ray gas in clusters of galaxies has a mean
metallicity of the order of 04 whether mea-
sured in FeH or H and the mass of metals
is proportional to that of stars in E and S0 galax-
ies in the cluster Arnaud et al 1992 As dis-
cussed by Renzini et al 1993 and Pagel 1997
this requires a large yield of the order of 2Z if
the metals are supplied by stars in the galaxies
reminiscent of what comes from the conventional
form of the Salpeter IMF but high compared with
the yield of 07Z or so required to t the MDF
in the solar neighbourhood eg Pagel  Taut-
vaisiene 1995 Does this imply a more top-heavy
IMF eg Arimoto  Yoshii 1987 Because of the
metallicity-luminosity relation eg Zaritsky Ken-
nicutt  Huchra 1994 and considerations of cos-
mic chemical evolution outlined below I prefer to
think of a universal IMF with a high yield modi-
ed by outow from the smaller galaxies While an
eective blowout due to supernova feedback may
be dicult to achieve in medium-sized galaxies as
we see them now MacLow  Ferrara 1999 there
are other mechanisms like tides and ram-pressure
stripping and the galaxies that we see today may
have been smaller in the past before being built
up by inow or put together by hierarchical clus-
tering
5 Cosmic chemical evolution and dark
Observations at high red-shifts both of emis-
sion from star-forming galaxies Madau et al
1996 Blain et al 1999 and of absorption lines
in Lyman- systems Pettini et al 1999 have led
to interesting investigations of cosmic chemical
evolution Pei Fall  Hauser 1999 These may
account for only a fraction of the metals in the
universe however From Big-bang nucleosynthe-
sis we believe that the smoothed-out density of
baryonic matter is
 0035
Tytler et al 2000 a value just consistent within
errors with recent deductions from BOOMERANG
and MAXIMA MWB observations Tegmark 
Zaldarriaga 2000 Balbi et al 2000 or possibly
even a slight underestimate whereas the density
of stars is only 110 as much Fukugita Hogan 
Peebles 1998 The remainder could be in the form
of diuse intergalactic gas low surface-brightness
galaxies MACHOs or something else For the
rst two of these the metal content is certainly
an issue Mushotzky  Loewenstein 1997 have
argued that the intergalactic gas dominates with
the same metallicity as the intra-cluster gas im-
plying a yield of 25Z while numerical simula-
tions by Cen  Ostriker 1999 imply a somewhat
lower metallicity like 01Z requiring a yield of
about 15Z cf Pagel 1999 thus half or more
of the heavy elements in the universe are as yet
unseen although there is a hint of their presence
in recent FUSE observations of O vi Tripp et al
2000 Models of cosmic chemical evolution dis-
regard the silent majority of dark metals at their
