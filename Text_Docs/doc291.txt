Abstract The galaxy population in rich local galaxy clusters shows a ratio of one
quarter elliptical galaxies two quarters S0 galaxies and one quarter spiral galaxies
Observations of clusters at redshift 05 show a perspicuously dierent ratio the
dominant galaxy type are spiral galaxies with a fraction of two quarters while the
number of S0 galaxies decreases to a fraction of one quarter Dressler et al 1997
This shows an evolution of the galaxy population in clusters since redshift 05 and
it has been suspected that galaxy transformation processes during the infall into a
cluster are responsible for this change These could be merging starburst or ram-
pressure stripping We use our evolutionary synthesis models to describe various
possible eects of those interactions on the star formation of spiral galaxies infalling
into clusters We study the eects of starbursts of various strengths as well as of the
truncation of star formation at various epochs on the color and luminosity evolution
of model galaxies of various spectral types As a rst application we present the
comparison of our models with observed properties of the local S0 galaxy population
to constrain possible S0 formation mechanisms in clusters Application to other types
of galaxies is planned for the future

1 Evolutionary Synthesis Model
We use our evolutionary synthesis models based on Tinsleys equations
and following the stellar population through the HR diagram for de-
tails see Fritze-v Alvensleben Gerhard 1994 using stellar evolution
tracks Geneva standard IMF Scalo one metallicity 12 solar and
star formation rate SFR specic for each galaxy type Sandage 1986
This model well describes undisturbed galaxies in terms of average
luminosity colors UK gas content and metallicity
To describe the galaxy interaction in clusters we use two scenarios
 Starburst for merging and tidal interaction of galaxies
 Star Formation Truncation for interaction with the Intra Cluster
Medium ram-pressure-stripping

Figure 1 Time evolution of MB and B  V for Sb galaxies with strong bursts and
no SF after it a and b and for Sb galaxies with SF truncation c and d
In case of the truncation we simply stop star formation at a given point
in time A burst is described by a sudden increase of the SFR followed
by an exponential decline to a given value
max max SFR at the beginning of the burst
burst decline time scale of the burst typical  108 yr
the SFR after the burst 0 or constant
The strength of the burst is dened by the fraction of gas which is
transformed into stars during the burst Models produce the time evo-
lution of magnitudes Johnson UBVRIJHK and colors for the dierent
scenarios

Gyr of evolution ab and for Sb galaxies with SF truncation at the
same points in time cd During the bursts the galaxies become more
luminous and bluer But after  2 Gyr the luminosity falls below the
luminosity of an undisturbed Sb galaxy and B  V becomes redder
In case of SF truncation the luminosity fades immediately and B  V
becomes redder It is mentionable that the burst models as well as the
truncation models reach nearly the same color in B  V at 4 Gyr after
the interaction
3 S0 Galaxies
As a rst application of our models we look at S0 galaxies in clusters
As mentioned in the Abstract the S0 population evolves signicantly
from higher redshifts to today
Fig 2a shows a color-magnitude diagram for spiral models with a
burst at 6 Gyr and f  0 after the burst Spiral galaxies evolve from
the lower right to upper left get brighter and bluer during the burst
and fade and redden thereafter towards the observed location of local
S0 galaxies as marked by the 1 box Most tracks end at 12 Gyr today
in the region of S0 galaxies Only the Sd galaxies are too blue and

slightly too faint If the burst model is to describe a merger of equal
type galaxies the mass of the bursting galaxy and its luminosity is
to be increased by a factor 2 -075 in magnitudes The colors do not
change The symbols mark time steps of 1 Gyr
Fig 2b shows spiral models with SF truncation after 9 Gyr At rst
the galaxies evolve like in Fig 2a After 9 Gyr the star formation stops
and the galaxies get redder and fade Except for the Sd models all
galaxies reach the region of S0 galaxies
For a detailed study see Bicker et al 2002
4 Conclusion
Detailed comparison of photometric evolution models with local cluster
S0 properties shows that most of the spirals falling into the cluster over
an Hubble time can be transformed into S0 galaxies Bicker et al 02
 The star formation must be stopped after the interaction trunca-
tion or burst with f  0 to reach the red colors of S0 galaxies
 Sd galaxies alone are too faint or too blue Only in mergers the
luminosity can reach the S0 range
 SF truncation may occur after  6 Gyr otherwise the galaxies
would become too red by today
 Bursts must occur before  9 Gyr Thereafter the galaxies would
become too blue by today
 Conclusions are the same for weak and strong bursts
 Conclusions are the same for all colors UK
These results agree well with spectral analysis of S0 galaxies Jones
et al 2000 They also found that the progenitors of S0 galaxies in
rich clusters are mostly early-type spirals that had their star formation
truncated in the cluster environment
