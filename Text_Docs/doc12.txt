Abstract - The adhesion of cells is mediated by membrane receptors that bind to complemen-
tary ligands in apposing cell membranes
It is generally assumed that the lateral diusion of
mobile receptor-ligand bonds in membrane-membrane adhesion zones is slower than the diusion
of unbound receptors and ligands We nd that this slowing down is not only caused by the larger
size of the bound receptor-ligand complexes but also by thermal uctuations of the membrane
shape We model two adhering membranes as elastic sheets pinned together by receptor-ligand
bonds and study the diusion of the bonds using Monte Carlo simulations In our model the
uctuations reduce the bond diusion constant in planar membranes by a factor close to 2 in the
biologically relevant regime of small bond concentrations
Introduction  Advances in optical microscopy have
made it possible to observe the diusion of single lipid
and protein molecules in biological membranes with a po-
sitional accuracy down to about 40 nm at ms time resolu-
tion 12 Deviations from free Brownian motion were fre-
quently found 2 3 and interpreted as the consequence of
membrane microheterogeneity Moreover cis-interactions
of mobile membrane proteins with cytoskeletal-anchored
proteins or aggregates were identied via transient im-
mobilization 4 Trans-interactions between single cellu-
lar cadherin molecules and their soluble counterpart have
been studied 5 paving the way for a characterization of
membrane-membrane adhesion zones at the level of indi-
vidual adhesion molecules
Current single-molecule experiments aim at detecting
the reduced diusion constants of bound receptors and
ligands as important parameters that report on the time
course of interaction in membrane adhesion zones It is
generally expected that the diusion of bound receptor-
ligand complexes is slower than the diusion of the con-
stituent unbound receptor and ligand molecules simply
because the complexes are larger and therefore also ex-
posed to a larger viscous drag We focus here on an-
other and to our knowledge so far neglected aspect of
the lateral diusion of receptor-ligand bonds The cou-
pling of the diusion to thermal membrane shape uctu-
ations We show that shape uctuations on a nanometer
scale signicantly decrease the diusion constant of the
bonds On this length scale the uctuations are governed
by the bending energy of the membranes
We consider a statistical-mechanical model in which
two apposing membranes are discretized into quadratic
patches Each of the patches in the rst membrane can be
occupied by a single receptor molecule which can bind
a ligand molecule in the apposing patch of the second
membrane We consider here irreversibly bound receptor-
ligand bonds that impose a local membrane separation
close to the bond length lo The lateral diusion of the
bonds is modeled as a hopping process to neighboring
patches and implies that the local separation at these
patches is changed to lo Hopping steps therefore can lead
to an increase of the membrane bending energy which
slows down diusion
We show that the decrease of the diusion constant de-
pends on the thermal membrane roughness which is a
measure for the strength of uctuations The roughness in
turn depends on the concentration of the receptor-ligand
it decreases with increasing bond concentration
For small bond concentrations the membrane roughness
at neighboring membrane patches of receptor-ligand bonds
tends towards a nite value
In our statistical-mechanical
model the uctuations reduce the diusion constant by a

factor of about 18 in the regime of small bond concen-
trations which is the biologically relevant regime for typi-
cal concentrations of receptor-ligand bonds in membrane-
membrane adhesion zones
Model  We consider two on average parallel
membranes that are interconnected by receptor-ligand
bonds In our model the membranes are discretized into
quadratic patches of size a  a The linear patch size a
corresponds to the smallest bending deformations which
are around 5 nm according to simulations with molecular
membrane models 7 Each patch i in the rst membrane
directly apposes a patch in the second membrane The
membrane conformations then can be described by the lo-
cal separation li of all pairs of apposing patches Two
apposing membrane patches can be pinned together by
a single receptor-ligand bond We assume here that the
bonds are irreversible and rather rigid At patch sites i
with receptor-ligand bonds the local separation is con-
strained then to the length li  lo of the receptor-ligand
The conformations of the two membranes are governed
by the bending energy of the membranes under the con-
straints that the local separation li is equal to lo at all
patch sites i where receptor-ligand bonds are present To
simplify the notation we use the rescaled separation eld
zi  liapkBT  where kB is Boltzmanns constant
and T is temperature Here   121  2 is the ef-
fective bending rigidity of the two membranes with rigidi-
ties 1 and 2 The conformations of the rescaled sepa-
ration eld zi are governed by the eective bending en-
ergy 8

are the membrane separations at the four nearest-neighbor
patches of membrane patch i The discretized Laplacian
dzi is proportional to the local mean curvature of the
separation eld We focus here on the bending energy of
the membranes since this energy is the dominant contri-
bution to the elastic energy on the small length scales up
to about 100 nm that are relevant here Elastic contribu-
tions from a membrane tension  or from the cytoskeleton
anchored to cell membranes are only important on larger
length scales ie on length scales larger than the crossover
length p which has a typical size of several hundred
nanometers for rigidities  between 10 and 20 kBT 9 and
tensions  of a few Jm 10 and larger than the aver-
age separation of neighboring cytoskeletal anchor points
which is about 100 nm 6
The lateral diusion of the receptor-ligand bonds is de-
scribed as a hopping process on the square lattice of mem-
brane patches Let us rst consider the hypothetical situ-
ation in which the membranes are planar and have a con-
stant local separation zi  zo where zo  loapkBT
is the rescaled length of the receptor-ligand bonds This
situation is depicted in the left cartoon of Fig 1 The lat-
Fig 1 Left A receptor-ligand complex that interconnects
two planar and parallel membranes The lateral diusion of
the receptor-ligand complex indicated by the arrows does not
involve any membrane bending  Right A receptor-ligand
complex interconnecting two thermally uctuating or rough
membranes The lateral diusion is coupled to the membrane
uctuations
eral diusion of the receptor-ligand bonds is then indepen-
dent of the membrane conformations During each time
step td of the diusive hopping process each receptor-
ligand bond can hop to one of the four nearest-neighbor
patches provided the patch is not occupied already by
another receptor-ligand bond At low concentrations of
receptor-ligand bonds diusive encounters of two bonds
can be neglected and the diusion of a single receptor-
ligand bond is characterized by a sequence of jump vec-
tors ai with length ai  a The orientation of each
jump vector along one of the four hopping directions
on the square lattice is independent of the orientations
of the other jump vectors After N jumps the lateral
mean-square displacement r

Lipid membranes however are not planar They ex-
hibit signicant thermal shape uctuations since their typ-
ical bending rigidities are between 10 and 20 kBT 9
ie only one order of magnitude larger than the thermal
energy kBT  The uctuations aect the lateral diusion
of the bound receptor-ligand complexes The jumps of
receptor-ligand bonds to neighboring membrane patches j

Lateral diusion of receptor-ligand bonds in membrane adhesion zones
then depend on the local separation zj of these patches
We assume here that a jump or hopping step to a neigh-
boring patch j implies that the local separation zj of this
patch is shifted to zo the rescaled length of the receptor-
ligand bond The hopping step then changes the bending
energy 1 of the membranes We study the diusion in
Monte Carlo simulations with the standard Metropolis cri-
terion 11 According to this criterion a hopping step is
always accepted if the bending energy is reduced by the
step If the bending energy is increased by E the step is
accepted with probability expEkBT  Hopping steps
are always rejected if the neighboring membrane patch is
already occupied by another receptor-ligand bond The
thermal uctuations of the membranes are simulated via
Monte Carlo steps that shift the local separation zi of
patch i to a new value zi   where  is a random number
between -1 and 1 These local moves of the separation eld
are again accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis
criterion except for moves with zi    0 which are al-
ways rejected since the membranes cannot penetrate each
An important aspect are the characteristic time scales
for the lateral diusion and for the membrane uctua-
tions on the smallest length scale a  5 nm of the model
Typical diusion constants D for membrane proteins are
between 01 and 1 m2s 12 13 which correspond to
characteristic jump times td  a24D between 1 and a
few microseconds The characteristic relaxation time for
membrane shape uctuations on the length scale a  5 nm
is around 01 microseconds 14 ie one order of magni-
tude smaller than the characteristic diusion time on this
length scale To capture this dierence in the two time
scales we perform on average 10 Monte Carlo steps for
the local separation zi on each lattice site between con-
secutive hopping steps of the receptor ligand-bonds The
local separation at the neighboring patches of a receptor-
ligand bond anneals during these 10 Monte Carlo steps
ie the separations are not or only very weakly time-
correlated with the separations of these patches at the
last hopping step of the receptor-ligand bond
The data presented here are from simulations with up to
107 Monte Carlo steps per membrane patch for the sep-
arations zi We have simulated membranes with a size
up to 120  120 patches and periodic boundary condi-
tions In our simulations the lateral correlation length of
the separation eld is signicantly smaller than the linear
membrane size Our results are therefore not aected by
the nite membrane size The initial conformation of the
Monte Carlo simulations is the planar membrane with sep-
aration zi  zo and random distribution of receptor-ligand
bonds From this initial conformation the membranes re-
lax relatively fast into thermal equilibrium for which the
thermal averages reported below have been measured

a hopping step is rejected if the neighboring membrane
patch is already occupied by a receptor-ligand bond We
call this exclusion rejection since the bonds exclude each
other from the patches The second reason is the uctu-
ation rejection ie hopping steps are rejected with prob-
ability expEkBT  if the step increases the bending
energy of the uctuating membranes by E These two
rejection probabilities and their sum the total rejection
probability are shown in Fig 2a as a function of the
bond area fraction X in the limit of large zo The exclu-
sion rejection dotted line increases with the bond area
fraction The uctuation rejection full line in contrast
decreases with the area fraction The total rejection prob-
ability has a minimum at intermediate area fractions
Concentrations of receptor-ligand bonds in cell-cell ad-
hesion zones can be as large as several hundred bonds per
m2 which corresponds to area fractions up to 001 for
membrane patch sizes a  5 nm At these bond area frac-
tions the exclusion rejection is negligible To understand
the increase in the uctuation rejection probability with
decreasing bond fraction X it is instructive to consider
how the membrane roughness depends on X The over-
all membrane roughness  represented by the dashed
line in Fig 2b diverges with decreasing bond fraction
X We nd that the roughness scales as   014 bb
with bb  1X see Fig 3a In contrast to the over-
all membrane roughness the roughness n at unoccu-
pied nearest neighbor sites of receptor-ligand bonds full
line in Fig 2b reaches a nite value close to 05 or
05apkBT  in physical units At small area fractions X
the roughness n is proportional to the uctuation rejec-
tion probability for hopping steps see Fig 3b There-
fore the membrane rejection probability also reaches a
nite value in the limit of small bond area fractions This
value is about 044 which implies that the numerical
factor by which the diusion constant of the receptor-
ligand bonds is reduced due the thermal uctuations is
11  044  18 in the biologically relevant regime of
small bond concentrations
The rescaled bond length zo can aect the diusion if
it is close to or smaller than the roughness  Typ-
ical receptor-ligand bonds that interconnect cell mem-
branes have a linear extension lo between 15 and 40 nm
For bending rigidities  from 10 to 20 kBT  this corre-
sponds to rescaled bonds lengths zo  loapkBT be-
tween 10 and 40 at room temperature For typical bond
area concentrations Xa2 in cell adhesion zones between
10 and several hundred molecules per m2 the rough-
ness   014X is smaller than these rescaled bond
lengths The length of the bonds then does not aect
the diusion behavior However biomimetic or arti-
cial receptor-ligand systems can be signicantly smaller
than the biological bonds For example membrane bonds
between negatively charged lipids mediated by multiva-
lent ions such as Cr3 can impose local membrane sep-
arations smaller than 1 nm 15 Fig 4 shows how the
overall membrane roughness and the membrane rejection

other and the hard-wall repulsion at local separations
zi  0 does not play any role Therefore in this limit
the results do not depend on zo ie the area fraction X
of receptor-ligand bonds is the only parameter that aects
the lateral diusion of the bonds and the membrane rough-
ness In addition to the overall membrane roughness 
dened above we will also consider the membrane rough-
ness n at unoccupied nearest-neighbor sites of bonds
on the quadratic array of membrane patches These un-
occupied nearest-neighbor sites are the sites to which the
bonds can jump during diusion
The eect of the membrane uctuations on the lateral
diusion of the receptor-ligand bonds can be character-
ized by the rejection probabilities of hopping steps There
are two reasons why hopping steps can be rejected First

X For zo  13 the roughness  and the uctuation rejection
probability Pf l for hopping steps increase with decreasing zo
probability Pf l for hopping steps depend on the length of
relatively short bonds As a function of the bond length
the roughness has a minimum at intermediate lengths
and increases for small lengths This increase is a con-
sequence of the uctuation-induced repulsion of the mem-
branes For small bond lengths zo the average mem-
brane separation is then signicantly larger than zo which
causes an increase in the roughness This is reminiscent
of the increase in roughness with decreasing bond length
in the case of membranes adhering via parallel stripes of
receptor-ligand bonds 16 The uctuation-induced repul-
sion of the membranes induce also attractive interactions
between the bonds see Fig 5 These entropic attractions
can lead to lateral phase separation for large bonds that
occupy several membrane patches 17 or for bonds that
locally change the rigidity of membrane patches in which
they are anchored 18 but not for the small bonds consid-
ered here 17 Aggregation of receptor-ligand bonds in
the adhesion zones of cells 19 20 or vesicles 21 has also
been observed experimentally In these situations the ag-
gregation is presumably driven by a length mismatch i
between bonds and repulsive molecules 21 or ii between

Discussion and conclusions  We have focused
here on the eect of membrane shape uctuations on
the diusion of receptor-ligand bonds between two mem-
branes We have found that the uctuations reduce the
bond diusion constant by a factor close to 2 at small bond
area fractions compared to planar membranes Mem-
brane uctuations can also aect observed diusion con-
stants via the ratio of the actual and the projected mem-
brane area in the experimental focal plane 22 23 by
coupling to the spontaneous curvature of membrane pro-
teins 22 or by curvature-induced changes of the mem-
brane thickness 23 As pinning centers between uc-
tuating membranes the bonds considered here can also
impede the lateral diusion of other large membrane pro-
teins 24
We have assumed that the receptor-ligand bonds in our
model are rather rigid and have a constant bond length
lo This assumption is justied as long as variations in
the bond length are signicantly smaller than the rough-
ness n at bond neighbor patches At small bond area
fractions n is close to 05 which corresponds to vari-
ations napkBT  in the membrane separation up to
1 nm Another assumption of our model is that Monte
Carlo diusion steps of the receptor-ligand bonds imply
a shift of the local membrane separation and an associ-
ated change of the membrane bending energy We have
previously shown that the Monte Carlo dynamics for the
membrane separation eld z corresponds to a Langevin
dynamics in the limit of small Monte Carlo step widths
z 25 For the diusion steps we have chosen here for
simplicity a nite Monte Carlo step width that is identical
with the lattice spacing a of the discrete membrane which
prevents the mapping to a continuous Langevin dynamics
We have also neglected hydrodynamic interactions which
may lead to a further reduction of the diusion constant
Theoretical descriptions of diusion in membranes mod-
eled as elastic sheets require assumptions and approxima-
tions that in principle can be elucidated in simulations
with molecular membrane models 7 26 Our theoretical
results are also accessible to experimental studies of model
systems with irreversibly bound receptor-ligand complexes
such as the Biotin-Avidin complex
