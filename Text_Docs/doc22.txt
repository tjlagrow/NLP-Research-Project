This paper is organized as the following In Section 12 we will review some results
about the limit theorems for unmarked Hawkes processes In Section 13 we will
introduce the main results of this paper ie the central limit theorem and the
large deviation principle for linear marked Hawkes processes The proof of the
central limit theorem will be given in Section 2 and the proof of the large deviation
principle will be given in Section 3 Finally we will discuss an application of our
results to a risk model in nance in Section 4
12 Limit Theorems for Unmarked Hawkes Processes Most of the litera-
ture about Hawkes processes considered the unmarked case ie with intensity

ht    
where h  R  R is integrable and khkL1  1 and   R  R is locally
integrable
When  is linear the Hawkes process is said to be linear and it is nonlinear
otherwise The stability results for both linear and nonlinear Hawkes processes are
known For the linear case we refer to Hawkes and Oakes 9 For the nonlinear
case Bremaud and Massoulie 3 proved the stability results for -Lipschitz 
such that khkL1  1 Karabash 11 obtained stability results for certain non-
Lipschitz  and discontinuous 
The limit theorems for both linear and nonlinear Hawkes processes are well
studied in the literature
For the linear Hawkes process assume z    z for some   0 and khkL1 
1 it has an immigration-birth representation see for example Hawkes and Oakes
9 For linear Hawkes process limit theorems are very well understood There is
the law of large numbers see for instance Daley and Vere-Jones 5 ie

with the rate function

By applying the techniques of large deviations the asymptotics of the ruin prob-
abilities for risk processes in insurance were studied in Stabile and Torrisi 13 for
the light-tailed claims and in Zhu 21 for the heavy-tailed claims
The limit theorems have also been studied for an extension of linear Hawkes
processes and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross processes in Zhu 20 which has applications in
short interest rate models in nance
Recently Bacry et al 1 proved a functional central limit theorem for the linear
multivariate Hawkes process under certain assumptions which includes the linear

Moderate deviation principle for linear Hawkes processes is obtained in Zhu 19
which lls in the gap between central limit theorem and large deviation principle
For nonlinear Hawkes processes a central limit theorem is obtained in Zhu 18
In Bordenave and Torrisi 2 they raised two questions about large deviations for
Hawkes processes One question is about large deviations for nonlinear Hawkes
process and the other is about large deviations for linear marked Hawkes processes
Recently Zhu 16 considered a special case for nonlinear Hawkes processes when
h is exponential or sums of exponentials and proved the large deviations
another paper Zhu 17 proved a process-level ie level-3 large deviation principle
for nonlinear Hawkes processes for general h and hence by contraction principle
the level-1 large deviation principle for Ntt   In this paper we will prove the
large deviations for linear marked Hawkes processes and thus both questions raised
in Bordenave and Torrisi 2 have been answered The large deviation theory studies
the small probability of rare events Unlike the unmarked case the rare events in
marked Hawkes processes can also be due to the presence of random marks It is
mixture of atypical behavior of unmarked Hawkes processes and atypical behavior
of random marks The role of random marks in the large deviations of Hawkes
processes is what we need to understand
13 Main Results Before we proceed recall that a sequence PnnN of prob-
ability measures on a topological space X satises the large deviation principle

tions Also Varadhan 14 has an excellent survey article on this subject
For a linear marked Hawkes process satisfying the dynamics 12 we prove the
following large deviation principle in this article

3 Proof of Large Deviation Principle
31 Limit of a Logarithmic Moment Generating Function In this subsec-
tion we prove the existence of the limit of the logarithmic moment generating
t log EeNt and give a variational formula and a more explicit
function limt
formula for this limit
DMYTRO KARABASH AND LINGJIONG ZHU
Theorem 4 Assume 13 and that there exists some   0 so thatRX eHaqda 
 and qda has a continuous density The limit  of the logarithmic moment
generating function is

where f  is the minimal solution to x RX eHax1qda and
HaeHaxc1qda  0
c   logZX
where xc  1 satises the equation xRX HaeHax1qda RX eHax1qda
Now let us prove Theorem 4
Proof of Theorem 4 It is well known that a linear Hawkes process has an immigration-
birth representation see eg Hawkes and Oakes 9 The immigrants roots arrive
via a standard Poisson process with constant intensity   0 Each immigrant
generates children according to a Galton-Watson tree Consider a random rooted
tree with root ie
immigrant at time 0 associated to the Hawkes process via
the Galton-Watson interpretation Note the root is unmarked at the start of the
process so the marking goes into the expectation calculation later Let K be the
number of children of the root node and let S1
be the number of
descendants of roots k-th child that were born before time t including k-th child
if an only if it was born before time t Let St be the total number of children in
tree before time t including root node Then

t   which satises
exp   Hax  1 qda
Similarly for   0 FSt is increasing in t and either FSt   as t   or it
converges to some nite limit x that satises 39
LIMIT THEOREMS FOR MARKED HAWKES PROCESSES
Next we need to determine for what values of  the solution of 39 exists Let
Gx  eZX
eHax1qda  x
If   0 then Gx  RX eHax1qda  x satises G1  0 G   and
G1  EqHa 1  0 which implies minx1 Gx  0 Hence there exists some
critical c  0 such that minx1 Gx  0 The critical values xc and c satisfy
Gxc  Gxc  0 which implies
c   logZX
HaeHaxc1qda
where xc  1 satises the equation xRX HaeHax1qda RX eHax1qda
Hence 39 has nite solutions if and only if   c Moreover it is easy to see that
Gx is strictly convex in x and hence there can be at most two positive solutions
to 39 When   0
Ge  ecid20ZX
eHae1qda  1cid21  ehEqheHae1i  1i  0
and FS0  e and FSt is decreasing in t and therefore it converges to the smaller
solution of 39 Similary when   0
Ge  ecid20ZX
eHae1qda  1cid21  ehEqheHae1i  1i  0
and FS0  e and FSt is increasing in t and for   c we know that FSt
converges to a nite limit and therefore it must converge to the smaller solution of
39 as t  
intensity   0 we have

32 Large Deviation Principle In this section we prove the main result ie
Theorem 1 by using the Gartner-Ellis theorem for the upper bound and tilting
method for the lower bound Before we proceed let us rst state a lemma that will
be used in the proof the lower bound in Theorem 1 This result can be found in

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1

Remark 6 An alternative proof of the lower bound of the large deviation principle
in Theorem 1 is by checking the essential smoothness condition in Gartner-Ellis
theorem and applying it to prove the lower bound directly Nevertheless our tilting
approach has the advantage of pin-pointing to the most likely path when a rare event
occurs

portfolio
Rt  u  t 
where u  0 is the initial reserve   0 is the constant premium and the Cis are
iid positive random variables with the common distribution dC Ci represents
the claim size at the ith arrival time these being independent of Nt a marked

For u  0 let

When the arrival process Nt satises a large deviation result the probability
that it deviates away from its mean is exponentially small which is dominated
by subexonential distributions The results in Zhu 21 for the asymptotics of
ruin probabilities for risk processes with non-stationary non-renewal arrivals and
subexponential claims can be applied in the context of marked Hawkes arrivals
