Most sensory cells use cross-membrane chemoreceptors to detect chemical signals in the environ-
ment The biochemical properties and spatial organization of chemoreceptors play important roles
in achieving and maintaining sensitivity and accuracy of chemical sensing Here we investigate the
eects of receptor cooperativity and adaptation on the limits of gradient sensing We study a single
cell with aggregated chemoreceptor arrays on the cell surface and derive general formula to the
limits for gradient sensing from the uncertainty of instantaneous receptor activity In comparison
to independent receptors we nd that cooperativity by non-adaptative receptors could signicantly
lower the sensing limit in a chemical concentration range determined by the biochemical proper-
ties of ligand-receptor binding and ligand-induced receptor activity Cooperativity by adaptative
receptors are benecial to gradient sensing within a broad range of background concentrations Our
results also show that isotropic receptor aggregate layout on the cell surface represents an optimal
conguration to gradient sensing

INTRODUCTION
Cellular sensory systems can detect temporal and spa-
tial changes of environmental signals For example bac-
teria sense chemical gradient by motion that translates
spatial chemical concentration asymmetry into tempo-
ral asymmetry Larger chemotactic eukaryotes are able
to sense the spatial gradients of chemoattractants across
the cell dimension A primary task for a sensory cell is
to respond to small chemical concentration changes or
shallow chemical gradients with sucient accuracy un-
der stochastic noises Berg and Purcell in their classic
study 1 showed that the fundamental physical limit of
concentration sensing is set by the uncertainty of ligand
diusion to a sensory cell regardless of biochemical details
in a sensing mechanism employed by the cell This result
was generalized by Bialek and Setayeshgar 2 using the
uctuation-dissipation theorem and was also applicable
to gradient sensing 3
Ligand detection by membrane-bound chemoreceptors
is the rst step for chemical sensing in a vast majority
of sensory systems of living cells Uncertainty of ligand-
receptor binding and stochastic dynamics of downstream
cellular signaling may introduce additional noises Re-
ducing such noise may help a system to operate near
the fundamental Berg-Purcell limit However the exact
sensing limit under proper ligand-receptor interaction re-
mains elusive In particular the eect of receptor cooper-
ativity is controversial 47 Receptor cooperativity can
sensitize the receptor response to small signal changes
but in the meanwhile it also amplies stochastic uc-
tuations in signal Using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux
MWC model Bialek and Setayeshgar 4 showed that
 jinyang2004gmailcom
receptor cooperativity helps to lower the threshold of
concentration sensing to approach the Berg-Purcell limit
set by ligand diusion Hu et al 5 by an Ising-type
model showed that receptor cooperativity improves gra-
dient sensing within a shortened dynamic range of back-
ground concentrations Most recently Skoge et al 7
studied chemoreceptor activity by a dynamic Ising model
and showed that receptor cooperativity could slow down
receptor activity and thus may not improve the signal-
to-noise ratio due to reduced response time
Another crucial mechanism found in many cellular sen-
sory systems is adaptation which maintains the sen-
sitivity of a system to varying levels of environmental
signals
It is known that adaptation tunes kinetics of
chemoreceptors at the molecular level For the exam-
ple of the better understood E coli the activity of re-
ceptors are modulated by multisite receptor methylation
and demethylation However the eect of receptor coop-
erativity to chemical sensing limit under the context of
receptor adaptation is yet to be examined
Using a theoretical model here we study the role of
receptor cooperativity on the accuracy of chemical sens-
ing under the inuence of receptor adaptation We con-
sider a sensory cell with a hierarchical organization of
cell-surface chemoreceptors Receptor cooperativity is
described by the classic MWC model 8 which was orig-
inally developed to explain allosteric regulation of multi-
subunit proteins and has been widely used to model
chemoreceptor coupling in bacteria 912 We derive
formula for the limit of gradient sensing based on the
uncertainty of instantaneous receptor states at the equi-
librium Our results show that cooperativity by non-
adaptative receptors reduces instantaneous noise of re-
ceptor states within a limited range of background con-
centrations determined by the biochemical parameters
of receptor dynamics and ligand-receptor binding
contrast cooperativity by adaptative receptors improves
the sensing accuracy across a wide dynamic range We
also show that the layout of receptor aggregates on the
cell surface signicantly aects the sensing limit with the
isotropic layout being the optimal Although the sensing
limit is sensitive to the cell orientation under anisotropic
aggregate layouts the eect of receptor cooperativity is
invariant
II THEORY
A A two-dimensional cell model
We consider a model Fig 1 for a two-dimensional
chemotactic cell subject to a chemoattractant gradient
eld Gx p  where x is the spatial coordinate and
p and  are the steepness and direction of the gradi-
ent The steepness is dened in a polar coordinate sys-
tem as p  r0
dr  which is a normalized concentration
change across a reference distance r0 along the direction
of the gradient The cell has M receptor aggregates dis-
tributed at distinct locations on the cell surface Coop-
erative receptors form clusters of size n and each aggre-
gate contains a number of such independent and non-
interacting receptor clusters Assuming aggregate m has
Nm receptor clusters we have the total number of re-
m1 Nm This
hierarchical organization of receptors on the cell mem-
brane is general and can be parameterized to study a cell
that has aggregated receptor arrays with n  1 or with-
out cooperativity n  1 or has non-aggregated receptor
monomers Nm  1 and n  1

or o state with a dissociation constant Kon or Ko 
respectively Ligand binding will shift the free energy dif-
ference between the two receptor states and such change
can be sensed by a cell to measure the ligand concen-

At the equilibrium an instantaneous conguration of
receptor cluster states measures the chemical concentra-
tions around the cell Such conguration uctuates in
time due to randomness of ligand-receptor binding and
stochasticity in receptor state switching which underlies
the uncertainty in gradient sensing Based on the above
model below we shall derive the best achievable limit for
the sensing uncertainty

B Extension to a three-dimensional cell model
To obtain analytical results we assume that the cell
resides in a linear gradient eld Across a typical cell
size eg about 10 m for Dictyostelium and 1 m for E
coli the linear gradient is a reasonable approximation
cm at the polar coordinate rm m is
cm  c01  mp cosm   
where c0 is the background concentration at the origin
and the coecient m  rmr0 is the distance from ag-
gregate m to the origin normalized by the reference dis-
tance r0 We have

alistic scenario

obtained at   1 in which ligand binding favors the
o state of the receptor The results at   1 not
shown are clearly symmetric to those at   1 We
note that the above derivation is under the assumption
that the receptor system has a xed total number of re-
ceptors Ntot The general conclusion also applies to a
system that has xed numbers of receptor clusters Nm

In the following we analyze the inuence of recep-
tor cooperativity on the chemical sensing limit under the
context of receptors with or without adaptation

By contrast receptor cooperativity improves sensing
accuracy below the optimal c0 near E  0 Fig 3c
Fig 3d shows that at low background concentration
c0  01 the system achieves optimal sensing accuracy
at free energy dierence E  0 of any cooperativity
level and receptor cooperativity further decreases 2

dent receptors We can relate this result to E coli in
which c0  01 corresponds to a background concentra-
tion of 2 nM MeAsp a threshold level at Ko  20 nM

At the regime E  0 where an unliganded receptor
is biased to the o state increasing receptor cooper-
ativity always reduces sensing accuracy Fig 3a when
ligand binding as well favors the o state ie   1
According to Fig 2b E  1 is out of the benecial
band at any background concentration c0 Intuitively in
this case receptor arrays have limited capacity most re-
ceptors are already o even before the introduction of
ligands to respond to ligand binding by further switch-
ing o receptor activity
At the regime E  0 receptor cooperativity reduces
p within a concentration range around the optimal c0
Fig 3b Such advantage is conned in a narrowed
dynamic range around intermediate background concen-
trations the stronger the cooperativity the shorter the
range of improvement instead of being eective at lower
concentrations a desirable region for chemotactic re-
sponses The results shown in Fig 3b approximate
those by the Ising-type model of Hu et al 5 in which a
receptor maintains the on state in the absence of lig-
and and is only switched o by ligand binding In fact
the model by Hu et al 5 can be considered as a limiting
B Adaptative receptors
Near precise adaptation was found in bacteria such
as E coli 16 A ligand concentration change triggers
a transient response in receptor activity followed by a
slow decay back to the steady state about the prestim-
ulus level
In other words receptor adaptation desen-
sitizes the steady-state activity to ligand concentration
allowing the cell to be responsive to environmental sig-
nals within a wide dynamic range Here we show that
adaptation also conditions the receptor system to allow
cooperativity to improve signal-to-noise ratio in chemical
sensing under a wide range of background concentrations
We assume that the receptor system is adapted to its
chemical environment before an onset of change in ligand
concentration We also assume that the adaptation ma-
chinery adjusts the free energy dierence E between the
two states of the receptor and keeps binding anities Kon
and Ko invariant For the example of E coli receptor
activity-controlled receptor methylation and demethyla-
tion act as a feedback mechanism that can adjust the free
energy gap E For precise adaptation equilibrium re-
ceptor activity is tuned to be a constant Pa independent
of the background concentration By Eq 1 at aggre-
gate m we have the adjusted free energy dierence

the adjusted E to adapted receptor activity Pa  12
as a function of ligand concentration The adaptation
tunes E into the middle of the benecial region band
and allows the receptor cooperativity to improve sensing
of small concentration changes
The adaptation mechanism may also likely maintain a
constant steady-state activity by adjusting ligand bind-
ing anities Kon and Ko  or adjusting all three ther-
modynamics parameters altogether 17 How adaptation
tunes these parameters altogether remains unclear even
for the well-studied E coli chemoreceptors Nonethe-
less as our model shows as long as a cell achieves
an adaptation level precise or imprecise that satises
P  Pa  P receptor cooperativity is advantageous
for sensing small changes in chemical concentration or
gradient It has been suggested a precise adaptation of
Pa  13 in E coli 18 in the range specied by Eq 19
supporting the idea that receptor adaptation and coop-
erativity act in concert to improve chemical sensing
C Eects of anisotropy in the layout of receptor
aggregates
The analytical formula in Eq 12 do not apply to the
scenario where receptor aggregates anisotropically locate
on the cell surface As we will show such an anisotropy
may cause substantial dependence of 2
 on the
gradient direction  the number and locations of recep-
tor aggregates We dene a metric Re to quantify the
layout anisotropy

which is a normalized mean angular dispersion between

angles of receptor aggregates are labeled in an order such
that i1  i for i  1  M  with the periodic bound-
ary condition M1  1  2 see Fig1 Re ranges
from 0 for the isotropic case to 1 when all receptor ag-
gregates gather at a single location
Each eective receptor aggregate acts as a local con-
centration sensor and a pair of aggregates can detect the
projection of the gradient onto the direction connecting
the two aggregates Two independent projections are
needed in minimum to reconstruct the gradient In our
model the minimal number of eective cell-surface re-
ceptor aggregates is M  2 because of the implicit as-
sumption that one parameter of the linear gradient the
background concentration c0 is known This assumption
is justied by considering that the cell has a memory for
a recent history of its chemical environment
A sensing singularity occurs when the cell 1 has only
one eective receptor aggregate because two aggregates
locate too close to each other or 2 has two aggregates
lying on the opposite side across the cell center such that
only one independent projection of the chemical gradient
can be detected For such a special layout the Fisher
information matrix of Eq 11 becomes degenerate and
the cell cannot resolve either gradient steepness p or the
direction  For M  2 2
p diverges at either end Re  0
or 1 where the system has a single independent sensor

p diverges at Re  1
and a singularity of the sensing limit may also happen
at Re  12 or 23 respectively Notice that as the
number of receptor aggregates M increases the extent of
singularity decreases because receptor aggregate layouts
with the corresponding value of Re become less likely to
be degenerate by chance
In general one can verify that 2
p may become sin-
gular at Re  M  2M  1 and Re  1 because
some receptor aggregates locate so close to each other
that they eectively sense a same local ligand concentra-
tion Suppose among all immediately neighboring aggre-
gates along the cell circle there exist k angles that are
equal to or greater than the average angle 2M ie
the rest M  k angles are smaller than 2M  Let 
be the sum of these k angles We rewrite the anisotropic
factor of Eq 23 as

cases when the value of k changes see Fig 5b for ex-
ample layouts when M  3
i When k  1 and
  2 Re  1 the system has a single eective ag-
gregate at one location Re  1 and therefore cannot
resolve parameters p or  The system is non-degenerate
as long as  6 2
ii When k  2 and   2
Re  M  2M  1 there exist two eective aggre-
gates In the special case in which these two eective ag-
gregates locate at two opposite sides on the circle across
the cell center the Fisher information matrix degener-
ates The system is non-degenerate as long as  6 2
iii When k  3 no degeneration appears As an illus-
tration for M  3 Fig5b shows that a singularity in
p may happen at Re  05 corresponding to the last
layout in Fig 5a However the majority of layouts
with Re  05 are non-degenerate For instance all lay-
outs with k  1 and   43 has Re  05 but none of
them is degenerate
p and 2
 are sensitive to the cell orientation
under anisotropic aggregate layout see Fig 4b for a
non-adaptive case The eect of receptor cooperativity
is preserved under anisotropic receptor aggregate layouts
because n is geometrically independent under a shallow
gradient By changing the cell orientation improvement
in estimating one parameter of p or  is gained at the ex-
pense of the other This result coincides with the study
by Hu et al 19 who showed that an elliptic cell cannot
simultaneously improve limits 2
 by elongating
the cell body As an optimal conguration the isotropic
layout of receptor aggregates improves sensing both p and
 in most cases and is insensitive to cell orientation as
indicated by Eq 12 and as shown in Fig 4b This re-
sult recapitulates the one derived by Berg and Purcell 1
who showed that uniformly distributed receptor patches
on the membrane maximize independent ligand inux to
the cell and thus sensitizes the concentration measure-
ment However as shown by Fig 4b proper cell orien-
tation can improve estimation of one of the parameters
p or  which might be a desirable task if sensing one
parameter is more critical than the other For example
accurate directional sensing may be more important than
steepness sensing in chemotaxis so that a cell can iden-
tify swimming direction more eciently For a cell with
anisotropic layout of receptor aggregates routine reori-
entation is required to improve sensing performance eg

IV DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
It is well-known that adaptation brings the receptor
activity back to pre stimulus level allowing the system
to remain sensitive to chemical changes in the future
This mechanism enables the system to respond within
a wide dynamic range of chemical concentration Here
we examine the role of adaptation in terms of chemical
sensing accuracy especially when presented with small
signals or small changes in the signal where stochastic
noise may become overwhelming Our study showed that
receptor cooperativity improves sensing accuracy only
within a limited background concentration range if the
receptor aggregates do not undergo adaptation By con-
trast receptor adaptation especially precise or near pre-
cise adaptation maintains the receptor sensory system to
operate within the parametric region where receptor co-
operativity is benecial As to our knowledge the nding
in this work for the rst time connects receptor adapta-
tion and cooperativity to noise ltering in chemical sens-
The sensing limit of Eq 12 was derived from the
uncertainty of an instantaneous receptor sampling of a
gradient eld The sensing accuracy can be improved by
a cell integrating independent receptor state congura-
tions over time 1 The time interval between two inde-
pendent measurements is determined by the correlation
time c that accounts for relaxation times of ligand dif-
fusion ligand-receptor binding 5 and receptor dynam-
ics Because the amount of time t available for averaging
is limited by dynamics of the intracellular signaling cir-
cuit the number of independent measurements is about
20 Therefore the temporal averaging reduces the
instantaneous limit 2
pt when t  2c
Ligand concentration is encoded as receptor occupancy
by the ligand-receptor binding and is then transduced
into receptor activity by the MWC model Stochastic
dynamics of each of these signal transduction stages con-
tributes additional noise and thus increases the corre-
lation time c which consequently elevates the sensing
uncertainty within the given time frame t

Our study does not consider the temporal dynamics
of ligand-receptor binding and receptor state switching
Skoge et al 7 recently showed that receptor cooperativ-
ity may signicantly slow down receptor state switching
described by Glauber dynamics 21 originally developed
for studying time dependence of the Ising model to an
extent such that the system cannot eectively relay the
information of ligand concentration changes in time c
becomes comparable or greater than the averaging time
t However there is still a lack of direct experimental
evidence on how receptor coupling quantitatively mod-
ulates receptor dynamics Our results reveal that the
benet provided by receptor coupling to chemical sens-
ing by instantaneous receptor activity congurations may
compensate the potentially detrimental eect of receptor
activity slowdown in particular by adapted receptor ar-
Another possible source of noise at the ligand-receptor
interaction level is due to ligand rebinding when a disso-
ciated ligand diuses back again to bind onto the receptor
aggregate before it escapes into the bulk medium The
extent of ligand rebinding and its eects on the accuracy
of ligand sensing depends on the size and density of a
receptor aggregate 22 Theory 23 and simulation 24
showed that ligand rebinding does not change the equi-
librium occupancy of individual receptors and therefore
does not aect the sensing limits obtained from instanta-
neous measurement However signicant ligand rebind-
ing does introduce extra uctuations by decreasing the
eective rate constants for ligand association with and
dissociation from the receptor which increases the corre-
lation time c and thus reduces the number of indepen-
dent measurements within a xed averaging time
Chemoreceptor cooperativity in bacteria was predicted
by Ising models and MWC models used for analyzing
dose response data in E coli More recently receptor cou-
pling is evident by the hexagonal organization of trimer-
of-dimers of chemoreceptors resolved by electron cryoto-
mography as a conserved architecture in a wide variety
of bacteria 25 The spatial organization of eukaryotic
chemoreceptors remains to be fully resolved even though
higher-order receptor arrays in chemotactic eukaryotes
have also been observed 26 suggesting possible recep-
tor coupling Our model of the receptor organization on
the cell surface is general and can be parameterized to
study systems of coupling or non-coupling receptors with
or without adaptation
Berg and Purcell 1 showed that uniformly distributed
receptor patches over the cell surface is optimal for re-
ducing interactions between nearby receptors and there-
fore maximizes ligand intake by the cell where ligands
were considered spatially homogeneous in the environ-
ment Here we consider the detection of spatial asym-
metry of ligand concentrations around the cell due to the
chemical gradient By examining the eect of geomet-
ric layout of receptor aggregates on the cell surface we
showed that anisotropic receptor aggregate distribution
generates a trade-o between the sensing limit of gra-
dient steepness p and that of the gradient direction 
Fig4 The isotropic layout represents an optimal con-
guration in which the sensing accuracy is insensitive to
cell orientation
In summary we study the eect of receptor coopera-
tivity and adaptation on the chemical sensing limit by
evaluating the Cramer-Rao lower bounds from the in-
stantaneous global state of receptor activity Our results
showed that receptor cooperativity with receptor adapta-
tion increases gradient sensing accuracy by lowering the
CRLB for small signal changes across a wide dynamic
range of background concentration This result is also ap-
plicable to concentration sensing at a single aggregate lo-
cation Eq 7 It remains largely unknown whether or
how a chemotactic cell achieves its sensing limit Recep-
tor internalization 27 might improve chemical sensing
by helping the cell membrane to function as an absorbing
surface an ideal device that operates at the fundamen-
tal Berg-Purcell limit Maximum likelihood estimation
MLE from ligand-receptor binding time series 28 or
instantaneous receptor states 5 19 was also suggested
as a possible approach to the physical limit The answer
to how a cell mechanistically integrates information in
time and space remains speculative and requires further
experimental and theoretical investigations
