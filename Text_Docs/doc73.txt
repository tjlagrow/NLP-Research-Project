Abstract
Binary stars evolve dierently from single stars thus binary evolution is
very useful for astrophysical studies This paper discusses the application of binary
evolution in the studies of stars star clusters galaxies and cosmology In particular
I concentrate on the use of binary evolution in colour-magnitude diagram and spectral
energy distribution studies of star clusters and galaxies
1 Binaries and Their Application in Astrophysical Studies
Binary stars are very common in the universe For example the Milky Way Galaxy
includes more than fty percent binary stars A lot of astrophysical processes and
properties can be investigated via binary stars In fact binary star is one of the most
powerful tool for astrophysical studies First binary star is a good tool for studying
many properties of stars Usually the luminosity acceleration of gravity eective tem-
perature and colours of stars in binaries are dierent from those of single stars To
investigate the properties of stars the eect of binary interaction and binary evolution
should be taken into account Second binary star is useful for stellar evolution study
Because there are many interactions between two components of a binary the evolution
of binary stars are dierent from single stars The evolution of binary star has been the
most important subject in studies about star evolution In Figure 1 a comparison of the
evolution of binary and single stars is shown We see that in the binary and single evo-
lution modes stars evolve dierently Note that the evolution of stars are calculated via
a rapid stellar evolution code Hurley et al 2002 Third binary stellar evolution has
an important role in studies of star clusters and galaxies The reason is that star clus-
ters and galaxies contain many binaries and their integrated properties are related to
binary evolution Especially when studying the stellar populations of star clusters and
galaxies binary evolution can aect the results obviously Binary and single star evolu-
tion usually give dierent colour-magnitude diagrams CMDs and integrated spectral
energy distributions SEDs for star clusters and galaxies Fourth binary evolution is
helpful in cosmological studies One method to constrain the age of the universe is to
measure the correct ages of old globular star clusters and then give a lower-limit for the
universes age The result is actually related to binary evolution because binary evo-
lution lead to dierent integrated specialties of stellar populations In addition binary
evolution may also aect the studies like dark matter and star formation

are investigated Eccentricity of the binary is randomly set to be 07 and an orbital
period of 15 days is taken Solid lines are for single evolution of two stars while
dash-dot-dot-dot lines for binary evolution Stars 1 and 2 are shown in black and
gray respectively
ApplicationofBinaryEvolution
As an important part this paper will show some new results about how binary evo-
lution can give explanation to the observational CMDs and SEDs of stellar populations
2 Binary Evolution Explanation to CMDs
CMD is well known as one of the best information desk for studying stars star clusters
galaxies and the universe I tried to explain the CMDs of stellar populations via binary
evolution in my work According to the observational results I aims to reproduce
the observational shape and blue stragglers in CMDs In this work I assume that all
stars in a simple stellar population form in a star burst and stars in a composite stellar
population form in dierent star bursts The masses of stars are generated randomly
via some widely used initial mass functions Then all stars are evolved by a rapid star
evolution code of Hurley et al 2002 Finally the stellar evolution parameters of stars
are transformed into CMDs of stellar populations via a BaSeL library Westera et al
2002 Some results can be seen in Figures 2 3 and 4
Figure 2 shows a V versus B  V CMD of a simple stellar population includ-
ing 50 binary stars with orbital period less than 100 days The typical observational
uncertainty in B and V magnitudes have been taken into account via an uniform dis-
tribution We nd that the shape of the CMD is close to the observational ones of star
clusters and binary evolution generate some blue stragglers naturally This suggests
that binary evolution is much better for CMD studies compared to single evolution
Binary evolution should be taken into account all astrophysical studies respecting to
For a comparison purpose a CMD of a simple stellar population consisting of
single stars is also shown in Figure 3 It shows that blue stragglers can not be formed
via single stellar evolution In addition there are clear dierences between the CMDs
of simple stellar populations basing on binary and single stellar evolution
In Figure 4 a CMD of a composite stellar population with 50 binary stars is
shown It consumes that stars in the population have the same metallicity but dierent
ages We see that the CMD is very complicated If it is compared to the CMDs of some
galaxies we will nd that the CMD shown here is similar to the observational CMDs
of some galaxies Note that in order to make it easier to plot the CMD observational
uncertainties are not taken into account in this Figure In fact observational uncertainty
has obvious eect on modeling CMDs
One can refer to one of our previous work Li et al 2010 to see how we can use
stellar population model basing on binary evolution for CMD studies of star clusters
3 Binary Evolution Explanation to Stellar Population SEDs
Besides CMDs SEDs are of special importance for astrophysical studies SEDs can be
used for studying the element abundances stellar ages distances and many other astro-
physical properties of objects Here I show how binary evolution can give explanation
to SEDs of stellar populations I pay attention to some UV-upturn SEDs because such
SEDs are observed in most of elliptical galaxies and it seems dicult to be explained
via single stellar evolution under nature assumptions Figure 4 shows the results We
can see that UV-upturn SEDs are generated naturally by binary evolution for some stel-
lar populations see also Han et al 2007 Therefore binary evolution are possibly the

assumed to form between 10 and 5 Gyr The stellar metallicity Z of the population
is 002 Eects of observational uncertainty is not taken into account
main reason for causing UV-upturn SEDs In addition the gure shows that the age of
young component aects SEDs signicantly
4 Discussion
Although this paper discusses the application of binary evolution in studies of stars star
clusters and galaxies it needs deeper investigations First all stellar populations take
a binary fraction of 50 but the fractions may be dierent for various objects Thus
it is necessary to investigate how binary fraction aect astrophysical studies and build
stellar population models with wide binary fractions Second the eect of mass ratio
of two components of a binary should be studied according to observational results
Third the metallicity dierence in stars of a stellar population should be noted This
will be important for objects that have long star formation histories Finally a lot of
processes in binary evolution remains unclear Thus the uncertainty in binary evolution
should be taken into account
