We investigate the protein expression pattern of the lamB gene in Escherichia coli LE392 The
gene product LamB is an important membrane protein for maltose transport into cells but it is also
exploited by bacteriophage  for infection Although our bacterial population is clonal stochastic
gene expression leads to a majority population with a large receptor number and a minority popu-
lation with a small receptor number We nd that LamB receptor distribution pn of the small-n
population is scale invariant pn  n where the exponent  depends on growth conditions A
heuristic model is proposed that relates the observed exponent to the protein production rate
The occurrence of scale invariance in physics and bi-
ology often reects an important underlying principle1
2 3 Herein we present a novel observation of spon-
taneousstochastic gene expression that gives rise to a
power-law distribution pn  n where n is the num-
ber of LamB receptors in individual bacteria The ex-
periment is made possible by a dual-colored phage la-
beling technique that renders the minority population
quantiable in a ow cytometer The LamB is a mal-
tose channel but it is also exploited by  phage as an
infection site We nd that in addition to the main pop-
ulation with an average n cid39 500 there is a small sub-
population  1 with a small receptor number This
small population increases the likelihood that the bac-
terial population as a whole survives a phage attack4
Surprisingly the small-n population has a scale-invariant
distribution n behaving very dierently from the log-
normal distribution commonly seen for major proteins in
a bacterium5 6 We propose a model that takes into
account the rate of protein synthesis and protein dilution
due to cell division This model yields a steady-state dis-
tribution p0n  n with  being a continuous func-
tion of the rate of protein synthesis
Our experiments were carried out using E coli LE392
that are sensitive to phage 7 The maltose regulon
of this strain is inducible the LamB receptor number n
can be varied from a few to  103 depending on culture
conditions8 The bacteria were grown in M9 minimal
medium supplemented with either 04 glucose or 04
maltose Standard protocols were used to grow the bac-
teria and to purify the  phage7 The lamB is an es-
sential gene for maltose metabolism when the substrate
is present at a very low level cid28 10 M However in
the current experiment the maltose level is suciently
high that the low receptor numbers does not impede the
growth of the minority population 7 9 To quantify the
number of LamB receptors n for individual cells bacte-
ria were incubated with high concentrations of uores-
cently labeled  phage dyephage ratio cid38 2000 and
the brightness of each bacterium was interrogated using
ow cytometry Dako Cyan ADP Using our labeling
procedure individual phage particles were bright enough
to reach the detection threshold of the ow cytometer7
making them quantiable by the instrument
FIG 1 Three steady-state distributions of p0n of bacteria
grown in M904 maltose The PDFs of the minority pop-
ulations follow power laws p0n  n with   1 for the
dashed lines and   17 for the solid line The inset displays
steady-state distributions of bacteria grown in M904 glu-
cose Since the maltose regulon is repressed there is no ma-
jority population The exponent for both runs was found to
be  cid39 26 as shown
We show several runs of LE392 grown in M9maltose
in Fig 1 The steady-state LamB probability distribu-
tion function PDF p0n has two peaks one around
n  500 and the other near n cid39 0 The minority peak
appears prominently in the log-log plot but this sub-
population is only a few percent of the total population
In rare cases the fraction is even smaller as indicated by
the lowest curve in the gure For all runs the minor-
ity population has a power-law distribution p0n  n
that extends more than a decade in n The measured ex-
ponent  is not constant but varies from run to run with
 ranging from 1 to 2 This variation may reect the
sensitivity of  to the varying protein production rates in
dierent bacterial cultures On the other hand the PDF
of the majority population is quite reproducible and has
the usual log-normal form6 We conjecture that segre-
gation of cells into minority and majority populations is
shaped by phage selection The low n phenotype allows
the bacterial population to hedge its bets due to the dual
functionality of LamB receptors These minority cells are
less t when maltose is not abundant in the environment
but their presence increases the chance that the popula-
tion as a whole survives a phage attack
We used a dual-colored phage labeling technique to in-
vestigate the role of the minority cells in the recovery
of a bacterial population after a phage attack Speci-
cally we are interested in the time scale of recovery and
the relationship between the minority and the majority
populations Our method consists of introducing red-
labeled AlexaFluor 633  phage into the bacterial pop-
ulation The bacteria is exposed to the phage for 30 min-
utes and the phage pressure dened as the initial phage
concentration P 0 is then relieved by several washing
steps4 The phage selectively decimates bacteria that
express a large number of receptors leaving only cells
with small number of receptors The surviving bacteria
were then allowed to regrow in a fresh medium Through-
out the regrowth period the bacteria were continuously
diluted into prewarmed fresh media This procedure en-
sures that the bacterial concentration is always less than
107 cc1 and the background phage concentration is be-
low 105 cc1 so that the probability that a phage binds
to a bacterium is very small4 To quantify the time-
dependent receptor distribution pn t a small sample
was periodically taken from the exponentially growing
culture The receptors on individual cells were tagged
with green-labeled AlexaFluor 488  phage and interro-
gated via ow-cytometry7 To stringently discriminate
deceased cells the bacterial sample was also treated with
propidium iodide which specically labels the dsDNA of
infected cells making them uoresce brightly in orange
The green channels of the ow cytometer is conditioned
on the red the killing phage and the orange channels
the dead cells to get rid of the background count
Figure 2 depicts a sequence of LamB PDFs pn t
before and after the bacteria were exposed to  phage
Before the phage exposure Fig 2a the LamB distribu-
tion has a primary peak at n cid39 500 and a secondary peak
at n  0 similar to the data in Fig 1 The minority peak
at small n in this case scales as p0n  n1 as delineated
by the solid lines in Fig 2a The majority population is
quickly eliminated by the exposure to the  phage Fig
2b but cells with a small n remain unaected Here
we observed that the n1 scaling extends over more than
three decades 100  n  103 After the removal of phage
the majority cell population slowly grows back to its orig-
inal form in  8 hrs Fig 2c-f with the distribution of
the minority cells maintaining the same shape the entire
time This result is robust in that the functional form of
the minority population is time invariant for a wide range
of initial phage concentrations P 0 so long as P 0 is not
large enough to erode the minority population This ob-
servation suggests that stochastic switching between the
minority and the majority states is relatively slow indi-
FIG 2
LE392 bacteria at an initial concentration of
1 107 cm3 and a  phage concentration 1 109 cm3 were
incubated at T  37 oC for 30 minutes The phage pressure
was then released by washing the cells twice using pre-warmed
M904 maltose This denes t  0 in the above plots The
population has two peaks before phage is introduced a Im-
mediately after phage selection b the majority population is
decimated leaving only the low n distribution that still scales
as n1 over three decades in n After the phage removal a
broad peak emerges from the n1 background in  2hrs c
and the peak sharpens and moves to large n with time c-f
Even after 8 hrs f corresponding to  11 generations the
majority population is still not fully recovered as indicated by
the lower height of pn
cating a weak coupling between the two populations In
other words the minority population is able to replenish
itself maintaining the self-similar form independent of
the majority population
The maltose regulon is inactivated if LE392 is grown
in M9glucose instead of maltose This is a part of
catabolic repression resulting from a sharp drop of cAMP
concentration in cells when glucose is present However
stochastic events still lead LamB to be expressed at a
very low level n cid39 2 The inset of Fig 1 displays mea-
surements of the steady-state LamB distribution p0n
for this case We observe that over a broad range of
n p0n also decays as a power law with the exponent
 cid39 27  02 In this case the run-to-run variation of
 cid39 02 is smaller than that of the maltose-grown cells
Therefore the uninduced or chemically repressed bac-
teria and the minority population of the induced bacteria
both have power-law LamB distributions pn  n al-
though with somewhat dierent  and  The larger
 seen in the maltose-grown cells suggests that this mi-
nority population is more sensitive to external variations
than uninduced cells and are hence more susceptible to
environmental changes
The population-balance approach10 can be used to
help understand the protein distributions in a bacterial
population The number of cells with n proteins at time

where nm is the partition probability of a daugh-
ter cell inheriting n receptors from a mother cell with m
receptors and n and n are respectively the state-
dependent protein production rate and the cell division
rate The integration on the right-hand side of Eq 1
takes into account the long-range eect of protein re-
distribution as a result of cell division Based on our
experiments the division rate for the majority and mi-

During cell division daughter cells inherit proteins from
mother cells If the partition of proteins is random we
expect that the sharing of m proteins between the two
daughter cells will follow a binary distribution As a
simplication we treated nm as a -function with
nm cid39 n m2 This approximation becomes pro-
gressively better with increasing m Finally we follow
Ref6 and assume that the protein production rate is
linear in n with n  cn This means that in the ab-
sence of cell division the proteins in an individual cell
grows exponentially nt  noect With these assump-
tions Eq 2 becomes

To appreciate the important role of cell division in re-
distribution of proteins consider a simple biologically rel-
evant situation where a group of cells spanning a broad
range of receptor states 0  n  nmax produces no
protein n cid39 0 This could be a result of kinetic rea-
sons such as deciency in some transcriptional factor or
as discussed below a lack of a DNA loop necessary for
the transcription initiation of LamB11 Although these
cells produce no protein they are genetically and physio-
logically identical to their cousins in the majority popula-
tion and should be capable of producing a large number
of proteins if this kinetic barrier is eliminated
If this
protein production is rare and temporary we would have
a simple re-and-divide scenario in which a large num-
ber of LamB receptors can be generated in a short burst
Cell division then dilutes the protein number lling the
FIG 3 The solutions to the equation 2x1  1ccid48x1 are
given by the dashed line x  1 and the solid curve The
observed exponent 2    1 for the minority cells grown
in maltose is within the shaded area 05  ccid48  07 The
inset depicts the DNA loop for the transcription initiation of
lamB gene The red ribbon represents the regulatory region
of malKp and the big arrow is the direction of transcription
when malKp is active The downstream genes include lamB
and other two proteins The small green spheres represent
CRPs that cause the DNA to bend the large spheres are
MalTs that are bound to sites 1-2 and 3-5 as shown and
the spheroid represents the RNA polymerase Without the
formation of the loop the three MalTs adjacent to malKp
will bind to alternative sites 3-5 that are 3 bp upstream from
the 3-5 sites11 In this case there is no contact between
MalT and RNA polymerase and malKp is inactive
low n states We can account for this mechanism by
adding a term gnp00 to the right hand side of Eq
3 where gnp00 represents a burst of proteins from
the n cid39 0 state We assume that gn is a continu-
ous function peaked at nmax which denes the upper
bound of the minority population It follows that within
0  n  nmax the steady-state solution is p0n  n1
which is consistent with some of our observations in the
induced minority populations displayed in Figs 1 and 2
We show below that a nite protein production rate
c cid54 0 can signicantly alter the protein PDF but the
n1 distribution remains as a solution of Eq 3 Note
that if p0n is an homogeneous function of x degree
p0n  nx then so is 
ncnp0n Substituting this
power-law form into Eq 3 gives the transcendental equa-
tion 2x1  1  ccid48x  1 where ccid48  c2 is the reduced
protein production rate This equation has two roots
one being x  1 independent of ccid48 and the other root
the cummulative probability cid82 n
being a monotonically increasing function of ccid48 as shown
in Fig 3 We nd that the second root x is less than
1 for small protein production rate ccid48  ln 2 indicat-
ing that n  0 is an accumulation point For ccid48  ln 2
x  1 with x becoming positive for ccid48  1 In this case
0 p0ncid48dncid48 is innite for
large n We interpret this to mean that the cells leave
the minority state for ccid48  ln 2 Fig 3 also shows that x
is a steep function of ccid48 for small ccid48 This may be why
the exponent  varies from run to run For instance
for the maltose-grown cells the variations seen in  
2  x  1 only corresponds to a relatively small
change in ccid48 ie 05  ccid48  07
It is unclear at present what mechanism gives rise to
the segregation of cells into the majority and the minor-
ity populations One possibility is due to the DNA loop
required to initiate the transcription of lamB see Fig 3
which is under control of the malKp promoter12 Pre-
vious genetic studies have shown that the binding of an
RNA polymerase to malKp requires the repositioning of
three MalTs the primary transcriptional activators from
a set of non-productive sites 3-5 to a set of productive
sites 3-5 that is staggered by 3 bp11 The reposi-
tioning requires the formation of a loop involving two
additional MalTs at sites  200 bp apart from the rst
three and the binding of CRPs cAMP receptor pro-
tein to three sites located in the intervening region of
the DNA as delineated in Fig 3 Unlike lac and ara
operons where the DNA loop enhances repression here
it is essential for the initiation of lamB transcription If
the bacteria in the minority population cannot form the
loop due to a deciency either in CRP or MalT proteins
LamB will be transcribed at a very low rate11 Since
the formation of a loop is a statistical event subject to
thermal uctuations the ratio of the minority to the ma-
jority populations may reect the energy dierence be-
tween the open and the closed conformations For a large
population the statistical nature of the process ensures
that the ratio between the two populations will be con-
stant as seen in our experiment13 Early experiments
also showed that MalT expression is limited both in the
transcription and in the translation9 indicating that
maltose regulon has evolved in a way that enhances the
expression noise in the population This is in contrast
with most regulatory proteins for which the system is
typically constructed in a way to minimize the protein-
number uctuations LamB however is exploited not
only by  but also by several other bacteriophage such
as K10 and TP1 The noisy expression pattern makes
biological sense because the phenotype can help the bac-
terial population cope with environmental uctuations
In the uninduced state the repressed cells still have a
broad distribution of receptors making them ready for
full induction in the case that maltose or maltodextrins
become available In the fully induced case the majority
of cells can prosper in the environment but a small mi-
nority is protected from potential phage infections This
scenario is consistent with our recent observations that
the heterogeneous bacterial population is more t in an
environment where  phage is present7
In conclusion we found that when lamB gene is fully
induced in a bacterial culture the cells segregate into two
populations with very dierent LamB receptors numbers
per bacterium The majority population which consists
of more than 98 of bacteria has a mean receptor num-
ber  500 but the minority population has only a few
receptors on average We believe that this novel phe-
notype is selected for because the bacterium coevolves
with viruses that exploit its receptor We propose that
the controlling mechanism is the DNA loop structure for
transcriptional initiation of lamB gene A noticeable fea-
ture of the minority population is that the number of
proteins obeys a power-law distribution pn  n with
 varying from run to run in induced cell cultures Using
a simple model we showed that the power-law scaling
for p0n can be accounted for by a low protein produc-
tion rate and a back-cascade process due to cell division
Since the model relies on very general features of protein
production and cell division we believe that our result is
applicable to other proteins in the minority population
