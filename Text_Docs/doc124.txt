Abstract
Explaining the formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the most
challenging problems in observational cosmology Many observations sug-
gest that galaxies we see today could have evolved from the merging of
smaller subsystems Evolution of galaxies tells us how the mass or number
density of the lens varies with cosmic time Merging between the galaxies
and the infall of surrounding mass into galaxies are two possible processes
that can change the comoving number density of galaxies andor their
mass We consider ve dierent evolutionary models of galaxies These
models are Non evolutionary model Guiderdoni and Volmerange model
fast merging slow merging and mass accretion model We study the grav-
itational lens image separation distribution function for these models of
evolving galaxies A comparison with data for lensed quasars taken from
the HST Snapshot Survey rules out the fast merging model completely
as this model produces a large number of small-separation lenses It is
possible that the mass accretion model and the non evolutionary model of
galaxies may be able to explain the small angle separations

1 Introduction
After the discovery of the rst multiply imaged quasars gravitational arcs
and arc-lets gravitational lensing has rapidly become one of the most
promising tools for cosmology
It is not a new idea that the statistics
of gravitational lensing can be used as a tool for the determination of
cosmological parameters1 2
In their pioneering work Turner Ostriker
 Gott 1984 hereafter TOG3 developed a formalism to calculate the
lensing probability and image separation distributions TOG modelled the
lens population as point masses singular isothermal sphere SIS galaxies
and cluster of galaxies Since gravitational lens frequencies are sensitive
to the cosmological constant  many authors49 used the lens statistics
developed by TOG to constrain the cosmological parameters Hinshaw
 Krauss10 1987 and Krauss  White111992 studied these eects with
nite core radii of galaxies In all these papers one simplifying assumption
is made that the comoving number density of galaxies lenses is constant
However it is an oversimplication to assume that galaxies are formed at
a single epoch
Mao12 1991 rst examined the eect of galaxy evolution on the statis-
tical properties of gravitational lenses using a simple redshift cut-o model
This model reduces the lensing probability and also explains the large
mean separation of images in the observed gravitational lenses Sasaki 
Takahara131993 used a more realistic model than that of Mao and stud-
ied the eect of a more gradual evolution in the number of galaxies on lens
statistics Mao  Kochanek14 1994 put a limit on galaxy evolution by
studying its eects on gravitational lens statistics and image separations
They concluded that most of the galaxies must have collapsed and formed
by z  08 if the universe is described by the Einstein-de Sitter model
If elliptical galaxies are assembled from merging of spirals then most of
ellipticals must be formed by a redshift of 04
Rix et al151994 considered an evolutionary model which is physically
more plausible They have studied the gravitational lens statistics with
an evolving lens population through the fast merging process only They
showed that some specic merger models can be rejected and - dominated
cosmologies are ruled out as they predict a large number of sub-arc second
lenses and with merging this problem becomes more acute They nd that
the lensing probability of getting multiple images is insensitive to merging
and the merging scenario skews dNd towards smaller separation
Park  Gott161997 tried to explain the correlation between gravitational
lens image separation and the source redshift in the presence of the galaxy
evolution Jain et al17 1998a also studied the eect of galaxy evolution
on the statistical properties of lenses both with decaying and constant 
The aim of this paper is to use the image separation distribution func-
tion of lensed quasars dNd as a tool to put constraints on the
various evolutionary models of galaxies Hamana et al181997 studied
the distribution of image separation angle of lensed quasars However
they found a complete mismatch between the theoretical estimates and
the observed lensed events We nd that if we use dNd as a tool to
study galaxy evolution it not only reduces the gap between observations
and theoretical predictions but also tells us which evolutionary model of
galaxies might explain the observations The paper is organized as fol-
lows In 2 we explain the dierent evolutionary models of galaxies In
3 we present the statistical formulas we use for comparing the model
calculations with the observations We briey summarize our results in
2 Evolution Of Galaxies
The theory of the formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the un-
solved problems of astrophysics Some authors believe that galaxies evolve
through a complex series of interactions before settling in the present day
form19 20 Others believe that galaxies were created in a well dened event
at very early time21 22 It remains unclear which process dominates the
formation of elliptical galaxies Among the many theories of galaxy for-
mation the idea that galaxies may form by the accumulation of smaller
star forming subsystems has recently received much attention Many ob-
servations also support this bottom-up scheme
First deep Hubble Space Telescope HST images23 indicate that early
type galaxies were assembled largely at z  1 and have been evolving
passively since z  1 Moreover HST and ground based telescopes show
that the galaxy-merger rate was higher in the past and it roughly increases
with redshift24 25 This suggests that the galaxies we see today could
have been assembled from the merging of smaller systems sometime before
z  1
Recent observations26 also show that elliptical galaxies are rarer at high
redshifts than those predicted by models in which elliptical galaxies com-
pleted their star formation by z  5 Therefore elliptical galaxies must
have had signicant star formation at z  5 through merging and asso-
ciated starbursts The formation of elliptical galaxies in this way is also
consisitent with the predictions of hierarchical clustering models of galaxy
formation
The second piece of evidence comes from the excess of faint blue galax-
ies which has been found in many deep imaging studies2729 Comparison
with the model which assumes that no luminosity evolution takes place
in the galaxy population shows that in the B band the actual observed
galaxy count exceeds the model predictions by a factor of 5 Merging of
galaxies can solve the surprisingly steep increase in the number density
of galaxies3033 But at present it is not clear whether such models ade-
quately describe the merging of galaxies in any realistic models of structure
formation in the universe
We consider ve dierent evolutionary models of galaxies which try to
explain some of the observational facts listed above  These models are
Non evolutionary model Volmerange and Guiderdoni model fast merging
slow merging and mass accretion model We study the gravitational lens
image separation distribution function in the presence of evolving models
of galaxies
Non- Evolutionary Model
This is the conventional lens model in which the luminosity function of
lens galaxies is assumed to be of the Schechter form34
L z  0  LLexpLLdLL
where the   and L are the normalization factor the index of faint
- end slope and the characteristic luminosity respectively These values
are xed in order to t the current luminosities and densities of galaxies
This model assumes that the comoving number density of galaxies nt
is constant and the mass of galaxies does not change with cosmic time
nt  n0  constant
where t is the look-back time The velocity dispersion of Singular Isother-
mal Sphere SIS lenses at t is
vt  v0  constant
The subscript 0 refers to present-day values
Volmerange and Guiderdoni Model
In 1990 Volmerange and Guiderdoni30 proposed a unifying model to
explain faint galaxy counts as well as observational properties of distant
radio galaxies This model of galaxy evolution is based on number evolu-
tion in addition to pure luminosity evolution According to this model the
present day galaxies result from the merging of a large number of build-
ing blocks and the comoving number of these building blocks evolves as
1  z15
It is argued that the present luminosity function is the well known
Schecter Luminosity Function34 given in eq1 above Then at high z the
comoving number density follows New Luminosity Function
L zdL  1  z2L1  z 0dL
It is seen that the value   15 gives a fair t to the data on high redshift
galaxies The functional form has the following properties
i Self-similarity as suggested by the Press-Schecter 197435 formalism
subject to the constraint that the total mass of associated material is
conserved
ii The comoving number density evolves as z
0 1  z and the
characterstic luminosity of the self similar galaxy luminosity function
varies as Lz  L01  z
Fast Merging Model
The rst merger model is that of Broadhurst Ellis  Glazebrook 199232
which was originally motivated by the faint galaxy population counts This
model assumes the number density of the lenses to be a function of the
look back time t as
The velocity dispersion of SIS lenses at t is
nt  f tn0
vt  f t1v0
This form implies that if we had n galaxies at time t each with velocity
dispersion v they would by today have merged into one galaxy with a
velocity dispersion f tv The strength and the time dependence of
merging is described by the function f t
f t  expQH0t
where H0 is the Hubble constant at the present epoch and Q represents
the merging rate We take Q  432 The look back time t is related to
the redshift z through

Slow Merging Model
In this less extreme merger model the total mass of galaxies within a given
comoving volume is conserved The comoving number density goes like
t23 while the mass of an individual galaxy increases like t23 where t
is the cosmic time since the big bang16 36 We further assume the mass-
velocity relation M  v The values of  and v are given in Table 2 for
elliptical galaxies Then

Mass Accretion Model
t023
Mass accretion is the key factor for evolution of galaxies A galaxy can ac-
crete mass through two processes either it accretes gas regularly through
internal dynamics or the accretion occurs in more violent events galaxy
interactions and mergers This is in line with the idea of hierachical for-
mation In this model the comoving density of the galaxies is constant but
the mass increases as t23 as in the cosmological infall model16 The total
mass in galaxies thus increases with time The comoving number density
and the dispersion velocity vary as

3 Basic Equations For Gravitational Lensing Statis-
The dierential probability d of a beam encountering a lens in traversing
the path of dzL is given by
d  nLz
where nLz is the comoving number density TOG 1984
The Singular Isothermal Sphere SIS provides us with a reasonable
approximation to account for the lensing properties of a real galaxy The
lens model is characterized by the one dimensional velocity dispersion v
The deection angle for all impact parameters is given by   4v2c2
The lens produces two images if the angular position of the source is less
than the critical angle cr which is the deection of a beam passing at
any radius through an SIS
cr  DLSDOS
we use the notation DOL  d0 zL DLS  dzL zS DOS  d0 zS
where dz1 z2 is the angular diameter distance between the redshift z1

It is clear from eq 16 that if   4 then optical depth at each redshift

4 Result and Discussion
An obvious noticeable fact from eq 16 is that when the index  the
Faber-Jackson index is dierent from the value of four that we get any de-
pendance on the evolution of galaxies The combination 14 vanishes
when  has the value 4 and totally suppresses the eect of evolution
Figs 1 to 3 give the calculated and observed number of lensed objects
as a function of the image separation for the currently accepted values of
cosmological parameters41 42   03 and   07 In all these gures the
histograms indicate the image separation distribution of the four lensed
quasars observed in the HST snapshot survey It is clear from these gures
that there is a very signicant dependance of the results on the Schecter
and lens parameters The uncertainties associated with these parameters43
will be diminished greatly by the data that emerges from the surveys
planned for the next few years The K96 set of parameters shift the peak of
the image separation distribution function  dNd for all the evolving
models towards smaller angles of separations The larger angle separations
are not explained by these parameters With LPEM parameters the mass
accretion model and to a lesser extent the non-evolution model seem to
have reasonable success in explaining the observations Figs 4 to 6 present
the results for the case of zero cosmological constant Here the best t
seems to be the K96 parameters
It is clear that to reach at a rm conclusion about galaxy evolution
more reliable and valid set of Schechter parameters are badly needed
This should be forthcoming in the next few years with the large number
of surveys that are in progress and that are being planned for the future
Satisfactory and unambiguous identication of lensed objects should
also improve in the coming years The X-ray observations by CXO Chan-
dra X-ray Observatory should be specially helpful44 An increase in the
overall number of lensed objects at all wave lengths is also expected in
the next few years It is hoped that knowledge of cosmological parameters
and galaxy distribution Schechter parameters will mutually rene each
other as more results become available It will then be possible to say with
some certainty which of the various galaxy evolution models are favoured
by observations and which are ruled out
