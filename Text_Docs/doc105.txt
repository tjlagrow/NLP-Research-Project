Surface brightness evolution has been detected in elliptical galaxies consistent
with passive evolution models of old stellar populations and in disk galaxies pre-
sumably due to enhanced star-formation rates The rates of evolution in clus-
ters and the eld are not measurably dierent In addition to this similarity the
high-redshift populations in both environments exhibit a blue-excess population
increased rates of star formation and high frequency of peculiar structure Thus
there are several parallels between evolving cluster and eld galaxies and the high-
redshift cluster environment will be understood only by comparison with the eld
population at the same epoch
1 Introduction
In the course of programs to understand the evolution of galaxies by focusing on
morphological properties two-dimensional surface photometry has been done
for samples of eld galaxies2223 and cluster galaxies2324 using H ST  ground-
based imaging and H ST archival data The cluster and eld galaxy popula-
tions were much more similar at z  05 than they are at the present time
2 Recent results on high-redshift clusters
21 Elliptical galaxies
Ellipticals are present in clusters at high redshift8 and their colours are consis-
tent with passive evolution models1012018 The small dispersion in the colour-
luminosity relation at z  0511 suggests they formed at substantially earlier
epochs Bender Ziegler  Bruzual3 nd evidence from the Mgb- and Faber-
Jackson relations for passive evolution in the B-band of 05  01 in a cluster
at z  037 a result consistent with fundamental plane work at z  03927
Imaging has been used to search for evolution in the size-luminosity relation
one projection of the fundamental planeof elliptical galaxies Schade et
al2526 analysed ground-based and H ST imaging and nd an increase with
redshift in surface brightness or luminosity at a given size of MB  z
consistent with both the spectroscopic studies cited above and with other imag-
ing work192 Thus the luminosity evolution expected from passive evolution
models of elliptical galaxies has been detected by several groups

imaging of 9 clusters with 0  z  1226 Galaxies
of a given size are more luminous by  1 mag at
z  1 Solid lines show the local relation and dot-
ted lines indicate the evolved relation measured
in each cluster Long-dashed lines indicate the
surface-brightness selection

The blue fraction of the cluster galaxy population increases from a few percent
locally to 25 at z  054 and by z  09 perhaps 80 of cluster galax-
ies were blue20 This blue population shows spectroscopic signs of enhanced
levels of star-formation6 and is made up largely of disk-like galaxies with a
high frequency of peculiarirregular structure211697 Surface photometry of
galaxies with redshifts from the Canadian Network for Observational Cos-
mology CNOC cluster survey5 shows that galactic disks in 3 clusters have
surface brightness higher than the Freeman12 value by  1 mag at z  05524
Furthermore this disk brightening is consistent with observations of eld
galaxies232224

lines show the Freeman12 law and dotted lines in-
dicate the mean evolved relation

ness relative to the Freeman law measured
from plots like Figure 3 Open cir-

3 Parallels of cluster and eld population at high-z
Cluster and eld populations are dominated at high redshift by a blue-excess
population that is mysteriously absent from the local population149 Both
populations show a high and similar frequency of peculiarirregular structure137
and both populations show elevated rates of star formation relative to local
populations176 It has been argued here that eld and cluster populations also
show evolution in surface brightness both disks and ellipticals and that the
rates of evolution are not measurably dierent although the cluster population
we have studied consists largely of galaxies far from the dense cluster core
These similarities suggest that much of the physics of galaxy evolution
is common to cluster and eld populations and that the development of the
high-z cluster population largely through infall of eld galaxies needs to be
understood in the context of the eld population at that redshift whose state
diers markedly from the population we see in the present-day universe
