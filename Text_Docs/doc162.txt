Abstract
The study of the morphology of galaxies is important in order to
understand the formation and evolution of galaxies and their sub-components
as a function of luminosity environment and star-formation and galaxy
assembly over cosmic time Disentangling the many variables that aect
galaxy evolution and morphology
requires large galaxy samples and
automated ways to measure morphology The advent of large digital sky
surveys with unprecedented depth and resolution coupled with sophisticated
quantitative methods for morphology measurement are providing new insights
in this fast evolving eld of astronomical research
The eld of galaxy morphology has a long history in astronomy It is also a
very wide and active eld of research at the present time A recent review by
Buta 7 is 174 pages long and cites about 350 papers In this short review
due to paucity of space only a small part of this active eld can be covered
I must admit that the topics I cover are somewhat biased by my own research
interests in this area For a more comprehensive and unbiased survey of the
eld the reader is referred to the excellent review by Buta 7 For a more
pedagogical introduction the classic text by Binney and Merrield 6 is highly
recommended
1 Galaxy morphology a brief history
It was realised nearly a century ago that galaxies were indeed island universes
independent systems composed of a gravitationally bound assemblage of stars
gas and dust The study of galaxy properties began in earnest after this
discovery In the early decades of the 20th century it became clear that most
bright galaxies fell into two distinct categories - those with a smoothly declining
brightness distribution with no inections and no evidence for a disc called
ellipticals and the disc-dominated systems with spiral arms punctuated with
star-forming complexes called spirals By 1936 when Hubbles book Realm
of the Nebulae 12 appeared the study of galaxy morphology had become a
well established sub-eld of optical astronomy In this book based on lectures
he had delivered at Yale University a year earlier Hubble published the Hubble
sequence for galaxy classication popularly known as the tuning fork diagram
due to its resemblance to the shape of a tuning fork In Hubbles classication
scheme Figure 1 regular galaxies are divided into 3 broad classes - ellipticals
lenticulars S0 and spirals - based on their visual appearance on photographic
plates A fourth class added later not seen in Figure 1 contains galaxies with

Figure 1 Hubbles scheme for galaxy classication as it appeared in 12
Although more sophisticated versions of this scheme have been proposed by
others the basic ideas have survived for three quarters of a century
an irregular appearance these were invariably forming stars at a rapid rate
Although a few other other schemes of galaxy classication have been proposed
in the literature eg
15 20 it is the Hubble classication as revised and
expanded by Sandage 18 and de Vaucouleurs 11 that is most widely used
According to Sandage 19 one reason Hubbles view prevailed is that he did
not try and account for every supercial detail but kept his classes broad enough
that the vast majority of galaxies could be sorted into one of his proposed bins
In recent years the eld of galaxy morphology has undergone a renaissance
for several reasons These include
i Morphology is a fundamental property of galaxies Any theory of galaxy
formation and evolution has to explain the observed distribution of galaxies
as a function of cosmic epoch and environment
ii Galaxy morphology is strongly correlated with galactic star formation
history Galaxies where star formation ceased many gigayears ago usually
have a dierent morphology from those where star formation continues at
the present time Figure 2 Galaxy morphology therefore is a zeroeth
order tracer of star formation history
iii Recent discoveries of new types of galaxies Figure 3
8 and higher
resolution views of nearby galaxies have expanded the eld as modern
digital surveys and the Hubble Space Telescope have superseded the old
photographic plates that were in use for decades
iv The explosion of data is accompanied by the development of quantitative
techniques for automated measurement of galaxy morphology
v Visual classication of millions of galaxies has also been revolutionised
Galaxy Zoo has
by citizen science projects such as Galaxy Zoo1

Morphology of galaxies
transformed the eld from the exclusive practice of a few experts to that of
hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic Internet connected amateurs without
compromising on quality
vi The Hubble Space Telescope has enabled imaging studies of nearby galaxies
at unprecedented resolutions eg Figure 2 and deep surveys with the
same telescope have extended morphological studies to z  1 and beyond
Figure 7
The present eort in the area is directed at obtaining an understanding of how
galaxy morphology is inuenced by environmental density mergerinteraction
history internal perturbations driven by instabilities gas accretion from other
galaxies nuclear activity internal secular evolution and star formation history
see 13 for a discussion of the interplay of all these factors Disentangling
the eect of all these interconnected inuences on galaxy morphology is a
complex exercise and is the central problem of galaxy evolution Independent
yet synergistic developments in 1
the development of theories of galaxy
evolution with predictions of observables such as galaxy morphology and 2
multiwavelength observations of large galaxy samples at a variety of redshifts
and in dierent environmental conditions clusters groups eld to test the
predictions of the theories are enabling a better understanding of galaxy
evolution
increasingly theories of galaxy evolution
are developed as advanced computer simulations that take into account all the
relevant physics of the gas dust stars and dark matter eg 5 As computing
power has grown dramatically in the last two decades the simulations have
become increasingly realistic
It must be noted that
2 Quantitative morphology
In the traditional method of classication images of galaxies on photographic
plates Kodak 103a-O and IIa-O were widely used were carefully examined by
an expert who then assigned a class to each object
In blue sensitive plates
massive star clusters dominated by early type stars stand out At the same time
dust absorption is severe and provides a dramatic contrast to the star clusters
Galaxies with spiral arms where star formation and dust are both seen are
therefore easy to classify while other types are not There are several other
issues in working with photographic plates or their digitised versions These
include
 The visual classication process does not scale to large galaxy samples
because of the limited availability of human experts Large samples 
containing millions of galaxies  are the norm today with the availability of
large area digital sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 1
 Even experts tend to show a small subjective bias in their classication
which is dicult to quantify
 Faint distant galaxies are very dicult to classify visually since important
guides to classication such as the presence of a disc or spiral arms may be
hard to see visually or may even be physically weak or absent in the earliest
galaxies

Figure 3 A new class of round green coloured galaxies labeled as green peas
were discovered by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project Peas are rare no bigger
than 5 kpc in radius lie in lower density environments than normal galaxies
but may still have morphological characteristics driven by mergers They are
relatively low in mass and metallicity and have a high specic star formation
rate yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of only hundreds of Myr 8
Morphology of galaxies
In such a situation automated tting and measurements of galaxy
morphology using digital images has rapidly become popular The most common
approach involves extracting the structural parameters of a galaxy by the
separation of the observed light distribution into bulge and disc components
The morphology can then be quantitatively measured by computing the bulge
to total luminosity ratio BT  The ratio is close to 1 for disc-less ellipticals and
systematically decreases as one proceeds along the Hubble sequence approaching
a value of close of zero for late-type spirals Sd There is considerable variation
in the details of the decomposition techniques proposed by various researchers
In recent years methods that employ 2D ts to broad-band galaxy images have
become popular eg 23 17 Most of these decomposition techniques assume
specic surface brightness distributions such as a generalised de Vaucouleurs
prole 10 for the bulge and an exponential distribution for the disc
The bulge-disc decomposition essentially involves a numerical solution to
a signal-to-noise ratio SN  weighted minimisation problem The technique
involves iteratively building 2D image models that best t the observed galaxy
images with the quality of the t quantied by the 2 value Weights for the 2
function are usually computed using the SN ratio at each pixel of the galaxy
image The model image needs to be convolved with the measured point spread
function PSF from the galaxy frame before the 2 is computed Figure 4 The
accuracy and reliability of the decomposition procedure can be assessed using
simulated galaxy images In addition to permitting a t to a bulge and disc light
prole most modern codes allow one to t for other structures such as a point
source usually caused by the presence of an AGN at the galaxy centre and a
bar The most recent version of the widely used code galt also allows for tting
irregular curved logarithmic and power-law spirals ring and truncated shapes
17 Wrapper programs that enable ts to all galaxies in a specied image
are useful to obtain morphological properties for hundreds of galaxies in one go
22
Once global parameters that describe the bulge and disc are available
predicted correlations from theory can be tested against the observations
provide a couple of examples of how quantitative morphology is improving our
understanding of galaxy formation and evolution
21 Evidence for luminosity dependent formation of lenticular bulges
Lenticular S0 galaxies straddle the space between ellipticals and spirals in the
Hubble tuning fork diagram Figure 1 It has been clear for some time that
bulges in ellipticals and late type spirals are fundamentally dierent Those
in ellipticals seem to have formed their stars rapidly at early epochs while
those in late-type spirals have grown their bulges over time through internal
evolution processes such as secular evolution Bulges of the elliptical kind follow
correlations such as the Kormendy relation and the Fundamental Plane Bulges
in many spirals called pseudo bulges often show correlated bulge and disk
sizes indicating their formation through the secular evolution mechanism 13
In this context
it is interesting to understand the formation process in the
intermediate lenticular type It has been recently demonstrated that there seem
to be two populations of lenticular bulges dierentiated by total luminosity of
the galaxies Faint lenticulars show a positive correlation between bulge and disc

Figure 4 Sophisticated graphical front-ends are now available to visualise the
outputs of bulge-disc decomposition programs 22 Typically a best t signal-
to-noise weighted analytic model of the 2D light prole of the galaxy is obtained
The model usually includes dierent galaxy components such as the bulge disc
nuclear source bars spiral arms etc One indicator of a good t is when the
residual galaxy  model has a Gaussian noise-like distribution
sizes in line with predictions of secular formation processes for the pseudo bulges
of late-type disk galaxies But brighter lenticulars show an anti correlation
indicating that they formed through a dierent mechanism 3 most likely
involving major mergers Galaxy environment also has an eect Faint cluster
lenticulars show systematic dierences with respect to faint eld lenticulars
These dierences support the idea that the bulge and disc components fade after
the galaxy falls into a cluster while simultaneously undergoing a transformation
from spiral to lenticular morphologies 4
22 Evolution of galaxy morphology in cores of clusters
It has been known for some time that the fraction of early type galaxies in
the central regions of clusters has increased as the Universe evolved With
quantitative morphology measurements on HST images of 379 galaxies in nine
clusters spanning the redshift range 031 to 0837 Vikram et al
21 have
recently measured the fraction of bulge dominated galaxies as a function of
redshift Figure 6 They nd a near monotonic decrease with lookback time
in the bulge-dominated fraction of galaxies 400 2
2  of galaxies at redshift
z  0837 are bulge-like This increases to 55 3
3  within  35 Gyr
It must be noted that the trend above is weak and statistical in nature one
needs to average over a large number of galaxies in a large number of clusters
over a wide range of redshift to see a trend The detailed physics operating
in each cluster doubtless modies the morphological evolution of galaxies in
that cluster Nevertheless with a large yet carefully selected galaxy sample it
is possible to quantitatively measure changes which would be impossible to do
with a small sample
Work in both the above examples was enabled by the use of 2D bulge-disc

correlation Solid line is the best t to the less luminous lenticulars squares

cosmic epochs the well dened morphologies of galaxies in the nearby Universe
are not seen and an analytic decomposition of the light prole is unlikely to
work well
decomposition of galaxy images to measure quantitative parameters describing
the bulge and disc The two examples quoted above are merely representative
of the work being done in this area One has only to glance through the large
number of citations of 16 17 to get a feel for the enormous amount of research
happening with quantitative morphological measurements
3 Galaxy morphology at high redshifts
Beyond z  1 even with HST data the parametric 2D bulge disk decomposition
technique does not work well Besides the galaxies appearing faint and small
the dropout selection technique frequently used to nd these distant galaxies is
biased towards highly star forming ones which are more likely to show disturbed
morphologies Figure 7
To make classication possible at very high redshifts several non-parametric
methods have been proposed and are widely used 2 9 14 Non-parametric
methods are not computationally intensive compared to the parametric methods
However with non-parametric methods
it is not easy to convert measured
quantities to physically meaningful parameters such as bulge or disc luminosity
