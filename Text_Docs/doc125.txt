Starbursts are episodes of intense star-formation in the central regions of galaxies
and are the sites of roughly 25 of the high-mass star-formation in the local uni-
verse In this contribution I review the role starbursts play in the formation and
evolution of galaxies the intergalactic medium and active galactic nuclei First I
point out the empirical similarities between local starbursts and the Lyman-break
population at high redshift and emphasize the implied similarities in their basic
physical dynamical and chemical properties In the local universe more massive
galaxies host more luminous more metal-rich and dustier IR-dominated star-
bursts This underscores the need for a panchromatic approach to documenting and
understanding the cosmic history of star-formation Second I review the systematic
properties of starburst-driven galactic superwinds These drive metal-rich dusty gas
outward at a typical velocity of 400 to 800 km s1 independent of the galaxy ro-
tation speed and at several times the star-formation rate They can be directly
observed both in local starbursts and high-redshift galaxies They are probably
responsible for establishing the strong mass-metallicity relation in spheroids and
for the metal-enrichment and preheating of the inter-galactic medium They may
have also ejected cosmologically-signicant amounts of intergalactic dust Third I
discuss UV observations of the nuclei of type 2 Seyfert galaxies These show that
compact few-hundred-pc-scale heavily-reddened starbursts are the source of most
of the featureless continuum in UV-bright Seyfert 2 nuclei and are an energeti-
cally signicant component in these objects Finally I discuss the evolution of the
host galaxies of radio-quiet quasars Rest-frame optical images imply that the hosts
at z  2 are only as luminous as present-day L galaxies less massive than than
the hosts of similarly-luminous low-z quasars similar to the Lyman-break galaxies
and much less luminous than powerful radio galaxies at the same redshift These
results are consistent with the idea of hierarchical galaxy assembly and suggest
that supermassive black holes may be formedfed before their host galaxy is fully
assembled

1 Introduction
Starbursts are short-lived episodes of intense star-formation that usually occur in
the circum-nuclear kpc-scale regions of galaxies and dominate the integrated
emission from the host galaxy Leitherer et al 1991 Starbursts are major com-
ponents of the local universe eg Gallego et al 1995 Soifer et al 1987 and are

the sites of  25 of the total high-mass star-formation in the local universe
Heckman 1997
The cosmological relevance of starbursts has been dramatically underscored by
the spectacular discovery of populations of high-redshift z  2 star-forming eld
galaxies selected by their rest-frame ultra-violet continuum emission Steidel et
al 1999 Lowenthal et al 1997 rest-frame far-infrared emission eg Hughes et
al 1998 Barger Cowie  Richards 1999 Cowie this conference Ly emission
Hu Cowie  McMahon 1998 and H emission Teplitz Malkan  McLean
1998 Mannucci et al 1998 The co-moving space density and luminosity of these
galaxies imply that they almost certainly represent precursors of typical present-
day galaxies and are responsible for the production of a signicant fraction of the
stars and heavy elements in the present-day universe eg Madau et al 1996 Blain
et al 1998 Calzetti  Heckman 1998
Starbursts may also play a vital energetic or evolutionary role in active galactic
nuclei AGN There have been recurring suggestions to this eect in the Seyfert
galaxy phenomenon eg Weedman 1983 Perry  Dyson 1985 Terlevich  Melnick
1985 Norman  Scoville 1988 Cid Fernandez  Terlevich 1995 On a more global
scale the rough proportionality between the mass of a supermassive black hole and
that of the stellar spheroid in which it now resides Magorrian et al 1998 van der
Marel 1999 strongly suggests that the quasar phenomenon is an intimate part of
the formation or early evolution of massive ellipticals and bulges
In this contribution I will therefore discuss the relevance of local starbursts
to understanding the high-redshift universe and its major baryonic components
star-forming galaxies AGN and the inter-galactic medium In 2 I will argue that
starbursts are the only local analogues to the star-forming galaxies observed at high-
redshift and will summarize some of inferences that follow In 3 I will describe the
systematic properties of starburst-driven galactic superwinds and summarize the
cosmological implications of these outows In 4 I will present a status report on
eorts to understand the energeticevolutionary signicance of young stars innear
the nuclei of Seyfert galaxies Then in 5 I will report new results on the proper-
ties of the host galaxies of high-redshift radio-quiet quasars and compare these to
theoretical expectations
2 Starbursts as Analogues to High-z Galaxies
Starburst galaxies are the only plausible local analogues to the population of star-
forming galaxies at high-redshift Meurer et al 1997 showed that local starbursts
and high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies have similar rest-frame UV surface bright-
nesses and UV colors Using the empirical correlation between UV color and extinc-
tion for local starbursts the implied bolometric surface-brightnesses of the high-z
galaxies are thus also very similar to local starbursts typically  1010 to 1011 L
kpc2 The high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies appear to be scaled-up larger and
more luminous versions of local starbursts The intrinsic UV surface brightnesses
are roughly three orders-of-magnitude higher than the disks of normal spirals and
indeed normal spirals at z  3 if they exist would be virtually undetectable in
HST rest-UV images due to their low surface- brightness eg Hibbard  Vacca
1997 Lanzetta et al 1999

The similarity in the surface-brightnesses of local starbursts and Lyman-break
galaxies immediately implies that there are also strong similarities in their basic
physical properties A high UV surface-brightness implies a high star-formation rate
per unit area SF R and thus high surface-mass-densities in the stars  and
the interstellar gas g that fuels the star-formation A typical case would have
SF R  10 M year1 kpc2 and g    109 M kpc2 These are roughly
103 SF R 102 g and 101  times larger than the corresponding values in
the disks of normal galaxies
The basic physical and dynamical properties of starbursts and the Lyman-break
objects follow directly from the above A gas surface-mass-density of 109 M kpc2
corresponds to an extinction of AB  102 for a Milky Way dust-to-gas ratio
The characteristic dynamical time in the star-forming region will be short tdyn
 G12  GtotH12  few Myr where H  102 pc is the thickness of
the disk A surface-brightness of a few  1010 L kpc2 corresponds to a radiant
energy density inside the star-forming region that is roughly 103 times the value in
the ISM of the Milky Way Finally simple considerations of hydrostatic equilibrium
imply correspondingly high total pressures in the ISM P  Ggtot  few  109
dyne cm2 Pk  few  107 K cm3 or several thousand times the value in the
local ISM in the Milky Way The rate of mechanical energy deposition supernova
heating per unit volume is also 103 or 104 times higher than in the ISM of our
Galaxy
To summarize the strong empirical similarity between local starbursts and the
high-z Lyman break galaxies implies strong similarity in their basic physical prop-
erties The conclusion seems inescapable if we want to understand the Lyman break
galaxies in the early universe we need to understand local starbursts
As discussed by Heckman et al 1998 local starbursts occupy a very small
fractional volume in the multi- dimensional manifold dened by such fundamental
parameters as the extinction metallicity and vacuum-UV line strengths both stel-
lar and interstellar of the starburst and the rotation speed mass and absolute
magnitude of the starbursts host galaxy In particular more massive galaxies host
more luminous more metal-rich and dustier more heavily-extincted starbursts
There are simple physical explanations for these trends Firstly simple considera-
tions of causality for a self-gravitating system with a gas mass Mgas  fgasMtot
imply that the maximum possible star-formation rate is given by the conversion
of all the gas into stars in one crossing time SF Rmax  Mgastdyn  fgas3G
Thus more massive galaxies with larger velocity dispersions  can sustain bursts
with higher star-formation rates and therefore larger luminosities The physical ba-
sis for the strong observed correlation between galaxy mass and metallicity will be
discussed in 3 below Finally the trend for more metal-rich starbursts to be more
heavily extincted follows provided that neither the gas column density towards the
starburst nor the fraction of interstellar metals locked into dust grains are strong
inverse functions of metallicity
The result of these correlations is that an ultraviolet census of the local universe
would not only underestimate the true star-formation-rate it would systematically
under-represent the most powerful most metal-rich starbursts occurring in the
most massive galaxies This eect can be clearly seen in the recent comparison of
the vacuum-UV and far-IR galaxy luminosity functions at low-redshift by Buat 
Burgarella 1998 Estimates of star-formation rates at high-redshift based on rest-

frame vacuum-UV sample selection probably suer the same bias and thus may
under- represent the ultra-luminous progenitors of the most massive present-day
spheroids It is tempting to speculate based on the empirical properties of local
starbursts that the SCU BA far-IR-selected sources at high-z may represent just
such objects This speculation is consistent with the relative space densities of the
most luminous Lyman-break galaxies and the SCU BA sources Meurer Heckman
 Calzetti 1999
Clearly we can not understand the cosmic evolution of the star-formation rate
and the formation and evolution of galaxies without a panchromatic approach
3 Starburst-Driven Superwinds
Over the last few years observations have provided convincing evidence of the
existence and even the ubiquity of superwinds - galactic-scale outows of gas
driven by the collective eect of multiple supernovae and stellar winds in a starburst
eg Lehnert  Heckman 1996 Dahlem Weaver  Heckman 1999 Martin 1999
In this section I will summarize the systematic properties of superwinds as
gleaned from the analysis of their X-ray emission and the UVoptical absorption-
lines The X-ray data have proven particularly important since they are the only
direct probe of the energetically-dominant piston of hot gas that drives the ow
The interstellar absorption-lines trace cooler and denser gas that has probably been
entrained into the outowing hot gas eg Suchkov et al 1994 and supply crucial
complementary data They provide unambiguous information about the magnitude
and sign of the radial velocities of the gas more fully sample the whole range
of gas densities in the outow rather than being strongly weighted in favor of the
densest material which may contain relatively little mass and can be used to study
outows in high-redshift galaxies where the associated X-ray or optical emission
may be undetectably faint Franx et al 1997 Pettini et al 1998
Martin 1999 has empirically quantied the global eects of intense star-formation
on the interstellar medium by estimating the outow rates and velocities for a local
sample of starburst and related galaxies I will follow her approach but update it
by adding new X-ray results on additional galaxies and improve upon it by in-
cluding results from our Heckman et al 2000 - HLSA analysis of the interstellar
absorption- lines in starbursts a data type not considered by Martin The principal
results are as follows
 The outow speeds are typically 400 to 800 km s1 independent of the rotation
speed of the host galaxy This result is shown in gure 1 HLSA show that
the absorbing gas typically spans a velocity range from close to the galaxy
systemic velocity up to some maximum blueshift They argued that this can
be understood if the hot outow is ablating material o of cold dense clouds
and then accelerating it up to some terminal velocity It is these inferred
terminal velocities that are plotted in gure 1 In the case of the X-ray data
outow velocities can not be directly observed Instead we have estimated
the outow speed from the observed gas temperature following Chevalier 
Cleggs 1985 solution for an adiabatic wind fed by gas at a temperature T
v  5kT 12 where  is the mean mass per particle This is a conservative
approach as it ignores any kinetic energy the X-ray-emitting gas may already

solid dots and the points based on the X-ray temperatures are indicated by hollow dots

have It is encouraging that the overall agreement between the two data sets
is satisfactory
 The implied outow rates of metal-enriched material probably exceed the star-
formation rate I have calculated star-formation rates for a large sample of
starburst galaxies for which mass outow rates can be estimated from ei-
ther interstellar absorption-lines X-ray emission or H emission-line kine-
matics The star formation rates assume a Salpeter initial mass function ex-
tending from 03 to 100 M For the outow rates based on the absorption-
line data I follow HLSA and set these equal to M  60rkpcNH3 
1021cm2v200kmsw4 Myr where r is the radius of the re-
gion of mass-injection the starburst NH is the total column density in the
absorbing material v is the mean outow velocity and w is the solid angle
lled by the outow I adopted the values measured or estimated for these
parameters by HLSA Lehnert  Heckman 1995 and Armus Heckman 
Miley 1990 For the outow rates derived from the X-ray data I have simply
taken the inferred mass of hot gas assuming a volume lling factor of unity
and divided it by the outow time  sound-crossing time for the X-ray
emitting region I also include the estimates for the outow rates in the warm
ionized gas from Martin 1999 which are based on the observed velocities
in the H-emitting gas and the masses derived by assuming that this gas is
in pressure balance with the ram pressure of the superwind see Martin 1999
for details While each method is crude and makes simplifying assumptions
that may be unwarranted it is gratifying that the three methods yield similar
M SF R  14 for the absorption-line data 28
results the median value for
for the X-ray data and 16 for the H data In fact since these three methods
measure dierent gas phases the total outow rate could be approximated as
the sum of the three rates Thus gas is being expelled from starbursts at a
rate in excess of the rate that gas is being processed into stars
 The implied outow rates of kineticthermal energy are a signicant fraction
of the total injection rate by supernovae and stellar winds The rate at which
superwinds carry energy is uncertain Simple estimates can be made from
the X-ray data by calculating the thermal energy content in the hot gas as-
suming unit volume lling factor and dividing this by the dynamical time
for the X-ray-emitting region As emphasized by Strickland 1998 this ig-
nores the eects of clumping which will reduce the thermal energy and of
the supersonic ow speeds which represent signicant kinetic energy En-
ergy more properly momentum outow rates can also be deduced from the
radial pressure gradients observed via standard optical emission-line diagnos-
tics assuming that these trace the sum of the ram- and thermal pressure in
the outow eg Heckman Armus  Miley 1990 Lehnert  Heckman 1996
Both techniques suggest that the majority of the kineticthermal energy sup-
plied by the supernovae and stellar winds is being carried out in the ow and
has not been radiated away The key seems to be that the porosity of the star-
burst ISM is high so that most supernovae detonate in a rareed pre-heated
medium eg Heckman Armus  Miley 1990 Marlowe et al 1995

 The outows are apparently quite dusty with inferred reddenings of EB 
V   1 over regions of a-few-to-ten kpc in size HLSA mapped the Na-D
interstellar absorption-line over regions with sizes of a few to ten kpc in a
sample of 18 starbursts Figure 2 shows the strong correlation they found
between the depth of the absorption-line prole roughly proportional to the
fraction of the emitting region covered by absorbing gas and the line-of-sight
reddening towards the emitting region The observed reddening is substantial
with EB  V   0904 corresponding to NH  several  1021 cm2
for normal Galactic dust This generalizes Phillipss 1993 discovery of a
spectacularly dusty few-kpc-scale outow in the halo of the starburst galaxy
NGC1808
The three results above have a variety of important implications The indepen-
dence of the outow speed on the galaxy rotation speed strongly suggests that the
outows selectively escape the potential wells of the less massive galaxies carrying
metals with them This process plausibly accounts for the strong mass-metallicity
relation in ellipticals and bulges Lynden-Bell 1992 has proposed an appealingly
simple model in which the fraction of starburst-produced metals that are retained by
a galaxy experiencing an outow is proportional to the galaxy potential-well depth
for galaxies with vesc  vout and asymtotes to full retention for the most massive
galaxies vesc  vout For vout in the range we measure gure 1 such a sim-
ple prescription can reproduce the observed mass-metallicity relation for spheroids
Lynden-Bell 1992
At the same time superwinds could deposit the required amount of observed
metals in the intra-cluster medium eg Gibson Loewenstein  Mushotzky 1997
The kinetic energy carried out by superwinds at high redshift could be the agent
that preheated the proto-intracluster medium prior to the collapseformation of
rich clusters Ponman Cannon  Navarro 1999 Evrard this volume If the ra-
tio of ejected metals to stellar spheroid mass is the same globally as in clusters
of galaxies the present-day mass-weighted metallicity of a general intergalactic
medium with igm  0015 will be  16 solar see also Renzini 1997 These in-
tergalactic metals could reconcile the apparent decit in the inventory of metals
contained by stars in the present universe compared to the expectations based on
the integrated amount of high-mass star-formation over cosmic time eg Aguirre
1999 Pettini this volume notes a similar problem with missing metals at high-z
Highly-ionized superwind ejecta may be a plausible place to hide them Superwinds
may also help alleviate the problems with understanding the apparently wide distri-
bution of metals in the Ly- forest Pettini this volume Efstathiou this volume
More speculatively if the outowing dust survives its journey the cumulative
eect of dusty superwinds could lead to a cosmologically-signicant amount of
intergalactic dust dust  few  105 which would seriously aect the Hubble
Diagram for type Ia supernovae Aguirre 1999 Aguirre  Haiman 1999 Finally
Kronberg Lesch  Hopp 1999 have argued that a substantial fraction of the inter-
galactic medium at high-redshift can be permeated with magnetic elds carried out
of the rst generation of galaxies by early superwinds

4 The Starburst-Seyfert Connection
There have been many observational investigations into the possible presence of
starbursts in Seyfert nuclei and it is beyond the scope of this contribution to review
this literature Instead I want to briey report on eorts by our group to make
direct spectroscopic detections of hot massive stars in a large unbiased sample of
Seyfert nuclei
According to the standard unied picture for radio-quiet AGN the principal
building blocks for a Seyfert nucleus are 1 A supermassive black hole and its
associated accretion disk the primary source of X-ray through optical continuum
emission 2 An optically- and geometrically-thick circum-nuclear torus of dust and
gas with an inner radius of a few pc and an ill-dened outer radius of-order 102 pc
It is viewed close to its equatorial plane polar axis in type 2 type 1 Seyferts
3 A mirror of dust andor warm electrons located along the polar axis of the
torus Thus the optimal targets in which to search for hot stars are the type 2
Seyfert nuclei in which the torus providentially blocks out the blinding glare from
a hidden type 1 Seyfert nucleus Indeed type 2 Seyfert nuclei have long been known
to exhibit a featureless continuum F C that produces most of the UV light and
typically 10 to 30 of the visibleNIR light the rest appears to be light from an
ordinary old population of stars Until recently it was thought that the opticalUV
F C was mostly light from the hidden type 1 Seyfert nucleus that had been reected
into our line-of-sight by the mirror
Instead if at least part of the F C is produced by a population of hot stars
it should not actually be featureless Instead spectroscopy in the blue and near-
UV should show the high-order Balmer lines in absorption unlike H and H
which are dominated by nebular emission and weak HeI stellar photospheric lines
Gonzalez-Delgado et al 1999 Spectra in the vacuum-UV should reveal strong
stellar wind lines and weaker stellar photospheric lines cf de Mello Leitherer 
Heckman 1999 To test this possibility we have therefore undertaken a program to
obtain high-resolution vacuum-UV images and spectra with HST  and near-UV
spectra with ground-based telescopes of a representative sample of the brightest
type 2 Seyfert nuclei
The rst results have been presented in detail in Heckman et al 1997 and
Gonzalez-Delgado et al 1998 HST imaging shows that the UV continuum source
in every case is spatially-resolved scale size few hundred pc or greater In some
cases the morphology is strikingly reminiscent of UV images of starbursts In other
cases a component of the UV continuum is roughly aligned with the inferred polar
axis of the obscuring torus as expected for reected andor reprocessed light from
the central engine
Of the original sample of 13 type 2 Seyfert with HST vacuum-UV images only
four were bright enough for us to obtain spectra of adequate quality in the cru-
cial UV spectral window from about 1200 to 1600 A However these spectra are
decisive all four show the clear spectroscopic signature of a starburst population
that dominates the UV continuum In addition to classic strong stellar wind fea-
tures NV1240 SiIV1400 and CIV1550 we can also detect weaker and much
narrower absorption features from highly-excited transitions which are therefore
indisputably of stellar origin
In each of the four cases if we use the empirical starburst attenuation law

T Heckman
Calzetti Kinney  Storchi-Bergmann 1994 Meurer Heckman  Calzetti 1999 to
correct the observed UV continuum for dust extinction we nd that the bolometric
luminosity of the nuclear 102-pc-scale starburst is comparable to the estimated
bolometric luminosity of the hidden type 1 Seyfert nucleus of-order 1010 L
Large-aperture UV spectra with IU E imply the existence of a surrounding larger-
scale few kpc and more powerful few  1010 to 1011 L dusty starburst that
is energetically capable of powering the bulk of the observed far-IR emission from
the galaxy Thus starbursts are an energetically signicant or even dominant
component of at least some Seyfert galaxies
However we have HST spectra of only four type 2 Seyferts and these are
strongly biased in favor of cases with high UV surface- brightness Can we say
anything more general To address this we have embarked on a program to obtain
spectra from about 3500 to 9000 A of a complete sample of the 25 brightest type 2
Seyfert nuclei in the local universe These objects are selected from extensive lists
of known Seyfert galaxies on the basis of the ux of either the nebular line-emission
from the Narrow Line Region the OIII5007 line or of the nuclear radio source
Whittle 1992
We are still analyzing these spectra but even a cursory inspection of the near UV
region below 4000 A shows that about half have pronounced Balmer absorption-
lines whose strength is consistent with a population of late O or early B stars In
several cases we can also detect those photospheric HeI absorption-lines 4921
4387 3819 that are not lled in by nebular emission In most of the remainder
of the sample the F C is so weak relative to the light from a normal old-bulge
stellar population that its origin is still not clear Recent work in a related vein
has been undertaken by Cid Fernandes Storchi-Bergmann  Schmitt 1998 and
Schmitt Storchi-Bergmann  Cid Fernandes 1999 Their results agree at least
qualitatively with ours they nd that most of the optical and near-UV F C in type
2 Seyfert nuclei is produced by young and intermediate age stars age  100 Myr
Thus it is clear that massive stars and starbursts play an important energetic
role in a signicant fraction of Seyfert nuclei What is not yet clear is whether
starbursts are an essential component of the Seyfert phenomenon and what if
any the causal or evolutionary connection might be Perhaps - as Cid Fernandes 
Terlevich 1995 suggested - the starburst is an inevitable byproduct of the dense
molecular torus that is now believed to be a fundamental part of the inner machinery
of AGN both obscuring the central engine and serving as its fuel source If true
this would have major implications for the relationship between quasars and galaxy
formation
5 The Host Galaxies of High-z Radio-Quiet Quasars
The cosmic evolution of the population of powerful radio galaxies has been well-
documented over the past decade see the volume edited by Rottgering Best 
Lehnert 1999 The uniformity of the K-band Hubble Diagram out to z  4 and the
evolution of the red-envelope in the visible and near-IR colors are consistent with a
large redshift of formation and the subsequent passive evolution of the progenitors
of some present-day giant elliptical galaxies eg Lilly 1989 Eales  Rawlings
1996 McCarthy 1999 Much less is known about the evolution of the population
of the hosts of radio-loud quasars but the available data paint a broadly similar

picture eg Lehnert et al 1992 Ridgway  Stockton 1997 McLure et al 1999
This is consisent with the standard unied model in which radio-loud quasars and
radio galaxies are drawn from the same parent population but the quasars radio
galaxies are viewed roughly along perpendicular to the polar axis of a dusty torus
Barthel 1989
While the notion of the monolithic formation of apparently-massive elliptical
galaxies at high redshifts does not t comfortably into the standard CDM picture
of hierarchical assembly at late times powerful radio galaxies are exceedingly rare
objects For H0  50 km s1 Mpc1 and   1 3CR radio galaxies at z  25
have a co-moving space density of only 02 Gpc3logP 1
rad while the fainter 6C
Eales 1999 and MRC McCarthy 1999 radio galaxies have space densities roughly
102 times larger Dunlop  Peacock 1990 These values can be compared to the
present-day space-density of rst-ranked cluster galaxies roughly 5000 Gpc3 -
Bahcall  Cen 1993 Even allowing for a short lifetime for the radio galaxy phase
the evolved descendants of powerful radio galaxies would account for only a small
minority of the rst-ranked cluster elliptical galaxies
In contrast radio-quiet quasars are far more common and therefore more likely
to be progenitors of typical present-day early-type galaxies Radio-quiet quasars
with MB  -23 have co-moving space densities at z2 of 2 104 Gpc3 Hartwick
 Schade 1990 Now for a quasar lifetime of-order the Eddington growth-time a
few  of the Hubble time at z  2 the implied space density of the present-
day descendants is of-order 106 Gpc3 which is comparable to the space density
of L Es and S0s eg Fukugita Hogan  Peebles 1998 This identication is
quite consistent with the correlation between the masses of supermassive black
hole and the spheroids in which they live today A quasar with MB  -24 powered
by accretion at the Eddington rate requires MSMBH  2  108 M and this
supermassive black hole would live today in spheroid with a mass of Msphz0  5
 1010 M and V-band luminosity of about 15  1010 L  04 L Magorrian
et al 1998 van der Marel 1999
Thus it is clearly important to document the properties of the host galaxies of
radio-quiet quasars over a broad range in redshifts At low redshifts the hosts of
the most-luminous radio-loud quasars radio-quiet quasars and radio galaxies all
appear to be similar several-L E or S0 galaxies McLure et al 1999 However
ground-based near-IR imaging of small samples already hinted that the situation
might be quite dierent at high-redshift with the hosts of radio-quiet quasars being
signicantly fainter than their radio-loud cousins Lowenthal et al 1995 but see
Aretxaga et al 1998
Recent analyses of HST NICMOS images of radio-quiet quasars at z  2 have
now claried the situation We Ridgway et al 1999 - RHCL have imaged 5 faint
MB  -23 radio-quiet quasars complementing the analysis reported by Rix et al
1999 of six luminous MB  -26 gravitationally-lensed cases Some examples of
the underlying hosts galaxies in the RHCL sample are shown in gure 3
While the samples are still modest in size several conclusions can already be
drawn see gure 4 RHCL Rix et al 1999
 Typical radio-quiet quasars at z  2 are hosted by galaxies with rest-frame
absolute visual magnitudes similar to present-day L galaxies MV  -20 to
-23  MV 15 mag

 As such they are much fainter than radio galaxies at the same redshift typ-
ically by  2 magnitudes
 These host galaxies are -if anything- less luminous than the hosts of similarly-
powerful low-z radio-quiet quasars Since the luminosity-weighted mean age of
the stellar population in the high-z hosts is almost certainly younger than that
of the low-z hosts the dierence in stellar mass will be even more pronounced
 The rest-frame-visual luminosities and sizes of the radio-quiet quasar hosts
are roughly similar to those of the Lyman-break galaxies Thus the Lyman-
break population might represent the parent population of typical radio-quiet
quasars Our Cycle 8 HST program will determine whether this similarity
extends into the rest-frame UV
The potential implications of these results are quite tantalizing First they
imply that the well-studied cosmic evolution of the hosts of the very-radio-loud
AGN population is evidently not representative of the much more numerous radio-
quiet population Second if we make the simplifying assumptions that the ratio of
LquasarMSMBH is roughly independent of redshift and that MSMBH  Msphz0
then it follows that supermassive black holes form well before their host galaxies are
fully assembled This agrees qualitatively with the idea of the hierarchical assembly
of massive galaxies at late epochs Indeed as already pointed out by Rix et al
1999 and RHCL the observations gure 4 agree rather well with the recent
theoretical predictions of Kaumann  Haehnelt 1999
6 Summary
If the reader takes away only four ideas from my contribution I hope they are the
following
1 Starburst galaxies are good analogues in fact the only plausible local ana-
logues to the known population of star-forming galaxies at high-redshift
2 Integrated over cosmic time supernova-driven galactic-winds superwinds
play an essential role in the evolution of galaxies and the inter-galactic medium
3 Circumnuclear starbursts are an energetically-signicant component of the
Seyfert phenomenon
4 The evolution of the population of the host galaxies of radio-quiet quasars is
signicantly dierent than that of powerful radio galaxies and is at least qualita-
tively consistent with the standard picture of the hierarchical assembly of massive
galaxies at relatively late times
