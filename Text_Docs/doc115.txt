ABSTRACT
We present the results of a numerical code that combines multi-zone chemical evolution
with 1-D hydrodynamics to follow in detail the evolution and radial behaviour of gas
and stars during the formation of elliptical galaxies We use the model to explore the
links between the evolution and formation of elliptical galaxies and QSO activity The
knowledge of the radial gas ows in the galaxy allows us to trace metallicity gradients
and in particular the formation of a high-metallicity core in ellipticals The high-
metallicity core is formed soon enough to explain the metal abundances inferred in
high-redshift quasars The star formation rate and the subsequent feedback regulate
the episodes of wind outow and cooling ow thus aecting the recycling of the gas
and the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium The evolution of the galaxy
shows several stages some of which are characterized by a complex ow pattern
with inow in some regions and outow in other regions All models however exhibit
during their late evolution a galactic wind at the outer boundary and during their
early evolution an inow towards the galaxy nucleus The characteristics of the inner
inow could explain the bolometric luminosity of a quasar lodged at the galaxy centre
as well as the evolution of the optical luminosity of quasars

INTRODUCTION
Imaging studies of the faint extensions around QSOs indi-
cate that elliptical galaxies are the host galaxies of the radio-
loud and the brightest QSOs Smith et al 1986 Hutchings
Janson  Ne 1989 Hutchings et al 1994 Hutchings 
Morris 1995 McLeod  Rieke 1995 Aretxaga Boyle  Ter-
levich 1995 Disney et al 1995 Bahcall Kirkakos  Schnei-
der 1996 Ronnback et al 1996 Taylor et al 1996 As a
matter of fact at high redshifts z  2 the only galactic
systems available to harbour QSOs are the spheroids since
the disks are formed much later In addition the epoch of
completion of the large spheroids z  2 coincides with
the peak in the QSO activity 2  z  3 Schmidt et al
1991 suggesting a relation between the QSO phenomenon
and the formation of large ellipticals In fact in recent years
there has been increasing evidence linking QSO activity with
galaxy formation The high metal content of high redshift
QSOs the high dust content several 108 M of dust of dis-
tant QSOs Andreani Franca  Cristiani 1993 Isaak et al
1994 McMahon et al 1994 Omont et al 1996 plus the pos-
sible relation between the galaxy luminosity function LF
and the QSO LF Terlevich  Boyle 1993 hereafter TB93
ccid13 1996 RAS
Boyle  Terlevich 1998 hereafter BT98 provides tantalis-
ing evidence of this link In any case the fact that even the
highest redshift QSO has strong metal lines in its spectrum
requires that the broad line region BLR gas has been en-
riched by a stellar population formed before z  5 Work
by TB93 and Hamann  Ferland 1993 hereafter HF93
highlighted the importance of metal production in the early
evolution of a galaxy Since QSOs are seen up to redshifts
of z  5 the supersolar metallicities required by the BLR
models should be reached by  1 Gyr since the beginning
of the galaxy formation epoch This evolutionary time scale
is an important constraint in chemical enrichment models
Two fundamental relations involving intrinsic param-
eters of elliptical galaxies show remarkable little dispersion
and point towards an early formation of ellipticals They are
the colour-luminosity relation and the fundamental plane
relating the total luminosity of an elliptical to its central
velocity dispersion and surface brightness The tightness of
the colour-luminosity relation provides strong evidence that
most of the present stellar population was formed at z  2
Bower Lucey and Ellis 1992 The narrowness of the fun-
damental plane gives additional support to that conclusion
Renzini and Ciotti 1993 and in addition indicates that the
A C S Friaca and R J Terlevich
properties of the core velocity dispersion Mg2 strength are
intimately linked to the galaxy global ones Dn luminos-
ity There is also good evidence that the stellar population
in massive ellipticals is metal rich with respect to the Sun
and shows large radial metallicity gradients eg Worthey
Faber and Gonzalez 1992 Davies Sadler and Peletier 1993
These properties of the elliptical galaxies may also be related
to the fact that they probably harbour QSOs in their centres
at some stage of their evolution
One-zone chemical evolution models have been used
Hamann  Ferland 1992 HF93 Padovani  Matteucci
1993 Matteucci  Padovani 1993 to investigate the chem-
ical history and the fueling of QSOs However during the
early evolution of the elliptical galaxy it is expected several
episodes of gas outow and inow which cannot be followed
by the one-zone model In addition the one-zone chemical
evolution models that attempt to explain the high metal
content in high redshift QSOs tend to overproduce metals
averaged over the entire galaxy and predict an excessively
high luminosity for the parent galaxy of the QSO For exam-
ple HF93 model M4 reproduces the rapid metal production
needed but it is overluminous In this model an elliptical of
1011 M has a peak bolometric luminosity of  2  1013 L
at an age of  01 Gyr But an elliptical with 1011 M is
at present only a sub-L galaxy with a blue luminosity of
 03L for M 
B  21 and MLB  10 so that for the
most luminous MB  24 ellipticals in the nearby Uni-
verse HF93 model M4 predicts luminosities of up to 1015
L during its formation These luminosities are higher than
the QSO luminosities
Note that only the core of the galaxy has to be metal
rich in accordance with the observed metallicity gradients
in nearby galaxies In the starburst model for QSOs TB93
and references therein the QSOs are the young cores of
massive ellipticals forming most of the dominant metal-rich
population in a short starburst The core mass which par-
ticipates in the starburst comprises only a small fraction
 5  of the total galaxy mass Also in the standard su-
permassive black hole model for QSOs only 05  1 per cent
of the galaxy mass goes into the black hole Haehnelt 
Rees 1993 The excessive production of energy and metals
in the one-zone model arises therefore from its inability to
resolve the core of the galaxy
The QSO LF undergoes strong evolution between z  2
and the present epoch with the redshift dependence of
the LF being well-described by a constant comoving space
density and a pure power-law luminosity evolution Lz 
1  zk Boyle et al 1988 1991 BT98 with k in the range
31  k  36 This luminosity evolution is linked to the
mass ow into the galactic nucleus hosting the QSO both
in the supermassive black hole scenario and in the starburst
model for AGN Since the luminosity is expected to be pro-
portional to the mass accretion rate into the nucleus in or-
der to make predictions about the luminosity evolution of
the QSO one needs the evolution of the central gas inow
Again this piece of information is not provided by the one-
zone model
In view of the limitations of one-zone chemical mod-
els we have developed a multi-zone chemo-dynamical model
that self-consistently combines chemical evolution and nu-
merical hydrodynamics In this paper we use this code to
investigate a number of topics related to formation and evo-
lution of elliptical galaxies and the link young ellipticals-
QSOs 1 the formation of a high-metallicity core in ellipti-
cals 2 the radial metallicity gradients in ellipticals 3 the
chemical enrichment of the intracluster medium by ellipti-
cals 4 the evolution of the luminosity of young cores of
ellipticalsQSOs The approach of the present work is rst
to develop a realistic sequence of models which reproduces
the main properties of elliptical galaxies We then investigate
the evolution of the galaxy core and of the gas inow into
the nucleus and within the scenario in which the galaxy nu-
cleus hosts a QSO we compare the predictions of the model
with QSO observations
The chemo-dynamical evolution code is described in
Section 2 Section 3 presents the evolution of the interstellar
medium ISM and of the star formation Section 4 consid-
ers the chemical enrichment of the intracluster medium by
galactic winds from elliptical galaxies Section 5 is devoted
to abundances and metallicity gradients of the stellar pop-
ulation in ellipticals The predictions of our models for the
evolution of the QSO LF are presented in Section 6 Some
concluding remarks are given in Section 7
2 THE CHEMO-DYNAMICAL MODEL
Apart from spectral-synthesis models not discussed in this
paper two classic approaches have been used to study the
formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies hydrodynam-
ical models aimed at reproducing the evolution of the X-ray
emitting gas in elliptical galaxies David et al 19901991
Ciotti et al 1991 and one-zone chemical evolution models
which seek to reproduce the global evolution of gas and stars
giving results on the evolution of metal abundances Ari-
moto  Yoshii 1987 Matteucci  Tornambe 1987 Padovani
 Matteucci 1993 Matteucci  Padovani 1993
Unfortunately both models give only a restricted de-
scription of the rst few Gyrs of the elliptical galaxy the
stage we regard as more interesting in connection to the
elliptical galaxies-QSOs link In the case of the above hy-
drodynamical models one central problem is that the gas
or ISM represents a major component of the young galaxy
which not only reacts to the input of energy of stars but
also via star formation builds up the stellar population
Moreover the deposition of energy mass and metals into
the ISM results from former star generations and thus in a
complete computation of the stellar input into the gas the
whole star formation history should be stored
Regarding the one-zone chemical evolution models they
do not follow the dynamical evolution of the gas and in
particular the evolution of the galactic wind a central in-
gredient in many of these models The gas distribution and
velocity eld are not described by these models since the
situation is far more complex than the existence or not of
a galactic wind The gas ow is not necessarily coordinated
along the galaxy there could be inow at one radius and out-
ow at another radius In addition these models do not give
information on the space distribution of the stars formed and
metallicity gradients This latter issue is needed for the un-
derstanding of the evolution of the core of the ellipticals the
region which is most readily observable where the metal-rich
stars are located and which lodges the QSO
A more promising approach is represented by the
ccid13 1996 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
chemo-dynamical model which combines hydrodynamical
and chemical evolution Such models have been employed
to study elliptical galaxies Burkert  Hensler 1989 Theis
Burkert  Hensler 1992 and spiral galaxies Burkert Tru-
ran  Hensler 1992 Samland Hensler  Theis 1997 The
chemo-dynamical model avoids a number of uncertainties of
the one-zone models One common assumption for example
is that star formation ceases after the system has evolved
long enough For instance in HF93 models star formation
stops when the gas mass fraction drops below 3 This in
principle recognizes the existence of a density threshold for
star formation Kennicutt 1989 but the choice of the value
of the critical density or gas fraction is arbitrary On the
other hand Matteucci  Padovani 1993 models assume
as most of the chemical evolution models do that the star
formation stops when the galactic wind starts The exis-
tence of galactic winds in ellipticals was rst suggested by
Mathews  Baker 1971 in order to explain the apparent
lack of gas in these systems Later Larson 1974b invoked
galactic winds to reproduce the relation mass-metallicity in
ellipticals Following Larson the condition for the onset of
a galactic wind in Matteucci  Padovani 1993 models is
that the thermal energy content of the gas heated by SNe
exceeds the binding energy of the gas Note however that
the suppression of star formation by galactic winds assumes
that the wind instantly devoids the galaxy of gas A more
realistic approach should include the time delay due to the
nite ow velocity of the gas leaving the galaxy Moreover
winds will not necessarily curtail all star formation as can be
seen from observations of starburst galaxies which can have
simultaneously kpc-scale X-ray wind and ongoing massive
star formation Heckman Armus  Miley 1987
In the present work we use the chemo-dynamical model
developed by Friaca  Terlevich 1994 to follow the evo-
lution of elliptical galaxies from the protogalaxy stage The
model combines a multi-zone chemical evolution solver and
a 1-D hydrodynamical code The elliptical galaxy assumed
to be spherical is subdivided into several spherical zones
and the hydrodynamical evolution of its ISM is calculated
see Friaca 1986 1990 1993 Then taking into account the
gas ow the chemical evolution equations are solved for each
zone In this work 100 zones are used with the inner bound-
ary at 100 pc and the outer boundary at the galaxy tidal
radius A total of  100 star generations over 13 Gyr is
stored for the chemical evolution calculations The length of
the star generations increases with the stellar age ranging
from 106 yr for newly formed stars to  3  108 yr for the
oldest stars Our models include inhibition of star formation
when the density is too low or when the gas is expanding
but the star formation is never sharply cut o and contin-
ues after the rst galactic wind has been established This
allows us to study the whole star formation history of the
galaxy as well as the development of both late wind and
late cooling ow episodes
21 The hydrodynamical evolution
The hydrodynamical evolution of the spherically symmetric
ISM is given by solving the uid equations of mass momen-
tum and energy conservation

where  u p and U are the gas density velocity pres-
sure and specic internal energy The equation of state
U  32p completes the system of equations The to-
tal binding mass M is the sum of three components gas
stars and a dark halo Mg M Mh respectively The gas
and the stars exchange mass through star formation and
stellar mass losses supernovae planetary nebulae and stel-
lar winds The dark halo has no interplay with the gas and
the stars and it is given by a static mass density distribu-
tion hr  h01rrh21 where h0 is the halo central
density and rh is the halo core radius
The star formation process and the restoring of mass
to the ISM by dying stars are represented by the specic
rates for star formation  and for gas return  The terms
 and  in the continuity equation couple the gas den-
sity to the stellar mass density  It is expected that the
stars do not remain in the zones in which they are formed
In addition the nal positions to where they have moved
should reproduce the density prole of a realistic galaxy We
take this into account by radially moving each zone of newly
formed stars in one free-fall time to a nal position such as
the resulting stellar mass distribution follows a King prole
r  01  rrc232 where 0 and r are the cen-
tral stellar density and the stellar core radius respectively
Both the stellar distribution and the dark halo are truncated
at a common tidal radius rt beyond which there is no star
formation
The stars are assumed to die either as supernovae SNe
or as planetary nebulae when instantaneous ejection of mass
and energy occurs The energy per unit mass injected into
the gas by the dying stars can be divided in three contribu-
tions due to Type I SNe Type II SNe and quiescent stellar
mass loss planetary nebulae and stellar winds
Uinj  SNI ESNI MSNI  SNII ESNIIMSNII
 Uinj
where SNI  SNII  and  are the specic gas return rate
by Type I SNe Type II SNe and quiescent stellar mass loss
respectively   SNI  SNII   MSNI and MSNII 
ESNI and ESNII are the mass and kinetic energy of the
supernova ejecta respectively Here Type I SN stands for
Type Ia only whereas Type Ib is included in the Type II SN
The gas which is lost from stars as wind or planetary nebulae
is assumed to be thermalized to the temperature given by
the velocity dispersion of the stars ie Uinj  322
where  is the one-dimensional stellar velocity dispersion
The adopted cooling function T  dened so that
T 2 is the cooling rate per unit volume takes into ac-
count the variations of the gas abundances predicted by the
chemical evolution calculation For the sake of simplicity
instead of considering the abundances of all elements in-
cluded in the chemical evolution calculations our cooling
function depends only the abundances of O and Fe which
are the main coolants for T  105 K In the evaluation
A C S Friaca and R J Terlevich
of the cooling function the abundances of elements other
than Fe and O have been scaled to the O abundance as
yi  yiP  yi  yiP yOyO where yi is the abundance
by number of the element i the cooling function takes into
account emission from H He C N O Ne Mg Si S Cl Ar
and Fe and yiP and yi are the primordial ie Y024
and Z00 and solar Grevesse  Anders 1989 abundances
of the element i The atomic database used in the determina-
tion of the cooling function comes from the photoionization
code AANGABA Gruenwald  Viegas 1992 A novelty
of these models is the self-consistency of the hydrodynam-
ics chemical evolution and atomic physics since the cooling
function is evaluated based on the actual chemical abun-
dances obtained from the chemo-dynamical modelling
The spherically symmetric hydrodynamics equations
are solved using a nite-dierence implicit code based on
Cloutman 1980 The code is run in the Euleurian mode
and the grid points are spaced logarithmically The grid has
between 150 and 300 cells the rst cell being 50 pc wide
The innermost cell edge is located at 100 pc and the outer
boundary at twice the tidal radius of the galaxy The arti-
cial viscosity for the treatment of the shocks follows the
formulation of Tsharnutter  Winkler 1979 based on the
Navier-Stokes equation In contrast with the von Neumann
Richtmyer articial viscosity Richtmyer  Morton 1967
this form of articial viscosity vanishes for an homologous
contraction
The outer boundary conditions on pressure and density
are derived by including an outer ctitious cell the den-
sity and pressure in which are obtained from extrapolation
of power laws over the radius tted to the ve outermost
real cells The inner boundary conditions adjust according
to whether inow or outow prevails locally During inow
the velocity at the inner boundary is extrapolated from the
velocities at the innermost cell edges whereas during out-
ow the velocity at the inner boundary is set to zero
The initial conditions assume an entirely gaseous M

mordial chemical abundances and density distribution fol-
lowing that of the dark halo The models are evolved until
the present epoch tG  13 Gyr A H0  50 km s1 Mpc1

22 The chemical evolution
Chemical evolution occurs as stars form out of the ISM
evolve and eject gas back into the ISM via stellar winds
planetary nebulae and SNe In this work we use conven-
tional chemical evolution formulations frequently used in
classic one-zone models in order to make it easier com-
parison with previous works Within each spherical zone
in which the model galaxy has been divided the evolu-
tion of the abundances of six chemical species He C N
O Mg Fe is calculated by solving the basic equations of
chemical evolution Talbot  Arnett 1973 Tinsley 1980
Matteucci  Tornambe 1987 We do not assume instan-
taneous recycling approximation for the chemical enrich-
ment but instead the delays for gas restoring from the stars
are taken into account by using main-sequence lifetimes tm
in Gyr log m  00558 log2 tm  1338 log tm  7764 for
stellar masses m  66 M Renzini  Buzzoni 1986 and
tm  12m185  0003 for m  66 M Gusten  Mezger
1983 Instantaneous mixing with the ISM is assumed for
the stellar ejecta
We express the relation of the star formation rate SFR
to the gas content by writing the SFR as r t  
where  is the specic SFR Unfortunately there is no widely
accepted theory of star formation Thus following Schmidt
1959 1963 one usually adopts a dependency of  on a
power of the gas density
  00nSF 
nSF  0 and nSF  1 for the linear    and the
quadratic   2 models of Schmidt It is not expected
that the SFR strictly follows a power law of the density the
parameter nSF is meant only to describe the nonlinearity of
the dependence of the SFR on the gas content There are
however good theoretical and observational reasons for be-
lieving that the SFR depends at least linearly on the gas con-
tent Kennicutt 1989 nds that the SFR per unit area of
disk galaxies varies approximately as the 13 power of the gas
surface density Chemical evolution models for the Galaxy
require a weak dependence of the SFR on the gas density a
range nSF  0  05 is found by Rana  Wilkinson 1986
whereas Matteucci  Francois 1989 favor nSF  01 over
nSF  1 Some values of nSF suggested for idealized cases
bracket the observational estimates above In this paper
most of the models have the so-called standard SFR ie
nSF  12 in which the time scale for star formation is
proportional to the local dynamical time Larson 1974a
Models have also been run for a nSF  13 SFR which cor-
responds to a cloud collision model for star formation with
constant lling factor of the star-forming clouds Negroponte
 White 1983 and a linear SFR nSF  0 the simplest
case The normalization in eq 5 was set as 0  10 Gyr1
in agreement with the  108 yr time scale for star formation
required by chemical evolution models in order to reproduce
the supersolar MgFe ratio in giant ellipticals Matteucci
 Tornambe 1987 Matteucci 1992 The ducial value for
the gas density 0 is taken as the initial average gas density
inside the halo core radius We included inhibition of star
formation for expanding gas u  0 or inecient cool-
ing ie for a cooling time tcoo  32kB T mHT  is
longer than the dynamical time tdyn  316 G 12 by
multiplying  as dened in eq 5 by the inhibition factors

The stellar birthrate per unit volume of stars of mass
m is given by r tm where m is the initial mass
function by number IMF The IMF is assumed to be
independent on time and position and given by m 
C m1x Here we adopt a Salpeter IMF x  135 nor-
malized over the mass range m  01  100 M
The gas restoring from the stars depends on the initial
stellar mass Single stars in the mass range 01  m M  8
end their life as planetary nebulae and leave helium or C-
O white dwarfs with masses smaller than 14 M Single
stars with masses above 8 M end their life as Type II
SNe No distinction is made between Type II and Type Ib
Type Ib being considered a Type II which has lost its en-
velope prior to the explosion Type Ia supernovae are as-
sumed to originate from binary systems of total mass in the
range 3  m M  16 in which the primary evolves un-
til it becomes a C-O white dwarf Mass transfer from the
slower-evolving secondary triggers C-deagration onto the
ccid13 1996 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
primary when the latter reaches the Chandrasekhar mass
Whelan  Iben 1973 The computation of the Type Ia SN
rate follows Greggio  Renzini 1983 An important param-
eter in this scenario is ASN I  the mass fraction of the IMF
between 3  m M  16 that goes to binary systems giv-
ing rise to Type Ia SNe Following Matteucci  Tornambe
1987 and Matteucci 1992 we have chosen ASN I  01
This value should be veried a posteriori by checking the
predicted against the observed SN Ia rate in ellipticals
The nucleosynthesis prescriptions for the envelopes of
single intermediate mass stars 08  m M  8 are
taken from Renzini  Voli 1981 their case with c  0
  033 We consider production of secondary N via CNO
shell burning in the envelopes of massive stars m  8 M
following the case B of Talbot  Arnett 1973 100 con-
version of the envelope C and O into N For stars in the
mass range 8  10 M the nucleosynthesis prescriptions are
those suggested by Hillebrandt 19821985 The yields from
Type II SNe with progenitors with mass between 10 and
40 M are from Weaver  Woosley 1993 and Woosley 
Weaver 1995 using a value of the 12C 16O reaction
rate which is 17 times the Caughlan  Fowler 1988 value
The results from the nucleosynthesis calculations for stars
more massive than  18 M depend critically on the chosen
value of this reaction rate Since Woosley  Weaver 1995
do not calculate models for SN II progenitors more massive
than 40 M we extrapolate their yields for the mass range
40-100 M based on the trend of yields with increasing mass
derived from Woosley  Weaver 1986 who use a higher
value for the 12C 16O reaction rate For masses above
30 M the results also depend on the assumed kinetic en-
ergy at innite KE of the piston of the explosion If KE
is not large enough there is some fall-back of material and
a more massive remnant a black hole is formed locking the
nucleosynthesis products and reducing the yields specially
that of the iron Larger values of KE prevent the fall-back
and lead to a larger amount of ejected iron The sequence A
of models of Woosley  Weaver has nearly constant KE
so that fall-back is not prevented a black hole is formed and
little iron is ejected In this work we use the sequence with
KE increasing with mass models S30B S35C and S40C
resulting in larger Fe yields and smaller remnants Finally
the yields from Type Ia SNe are from Nomoto et al 1984
their model W7
We adopt the initial massnal mass relation given by
Iben  Renzini 1983 for the white dwarf remnants of single
stars with initial mass in the range 01  m M  8 Stars
more massive than 8 M which explode as Type II or
Ib supernovae are assumed to leave 14 M neutron stars
remnants The Type Ia supernovae are assumed to leave no
remnant
We performed several checks of the chemical evolution
solver of our code by comparing the results of one-zone
runs with classic galactic wind one-zone models for elliptical
galaxies Arimoto  Yoshii 1987 Matteucci  Tornambe
1987 Matteucci 1992 Here we consider a reference one-
zone model similar to the model A2 of Matteucci 1992 ex-
cept for some dierences in the nucleosynthesis prescriptions
and stellar lifetimes Our model represents a galaxy initially
gaseous with mass MG  1012 M and no dark halo It is
assumed a linear star formation law ie SF  0  con-
stant Following the relation   86MG1012 M0115

Gyr1 The model belongs to the class of SN-driven galac-
tic wind models in which a galactic wind is established at
a time tgw At this time the gas is swept from the galaxy
and the star formation is turned o forever The condition
for the onset of the galactic wind is that the thermal con-
tent of the SN remnants of the galaxy equals the gravita-
tional binding energy of the galaxy ISM the computation
of these two quantities follows Matteucci 1992 Our model

Fig 1 shows the evolution of abundances of C N O

nous mass of 1012 M and Salpeter IMF note that HF93
assumes 0  67 Gyr1 and x  11 for the IMF and
Matteucci  Padovani model includes a dark halo In or-
der to illustrate the eect of the convection parameter c of
the models of Renzini  Voli 1981 for the yields of inter-
mediate mass stars we show runs for their cases c  0
  033 and c  15   033 The eect of c can
be seen in the evolution of NH throughout this paper
the bracketed ratios denote the ratio of mass abundances
relative to their solar values ie XHXHXH
For c  0 there is secondary only N production and for
c  15 there is some primary production of N due to hot-
bottom burning in the stellar envelope Earlier than 3  107
yr there is only secondary production of N by high mass
stars and the pace of N enrichment is roughly proportional
to the gas metallicity For later times the yield of stars with
m  8 M is important and in the case c  0 also the in-

case c  15 NH shows a steep rise at  3  107 yr due
to the rst primary N ejected by intermediate mass stars
Also note the fast increase of the abundances of -elements
O Mg ejected by Type II SNe which reach solar abun-
dances at  108 yr By contrast the enrichment of Fe is
delayed with respect to that of O FeH becomes solar at
 3  108 yr since Fe is mostly produced in Type Ia SNe
with long-lived progenitors
3 EVOLUTION OF THE ISM AND STAR
FORMATION RATE
We have built a sequence of galaxy models parameterized ac-
cording to the total initial luminous mass inside the tidal
radius MG  Mg  M the luminous mass of the galaxy
is comprised by the stellar and the gas components which
are readly observable mainly in optical and X-ray bands
respectively The models are further characterized by rh
rt and the ratio of the halo to the initial luminous mass
MhMG We have investigated a grid of runs with MG be-
tween 1011 and 5  1012 M and rh in the range 25  15
kpc We set rt  28rh and MhMG  3 The choice of the
rh  rt  MG relation is based on the scaling laws of Sarazin
 White 1987 0 and rc of the stellar distribution are re-
lated to the central stellar velocity dispersion  by the virial
condition 4G0rc  92
 In addition the model galax-
ies follow a Faber-Jackson relation   200LB L
km s1 Terlevich 1992 with LB related to MG through
MLB   10 the mass-light ratio typical of an L galaxy
In this work we have chosen as ducial model that one with
MG  2  1011 M and standard SFR Due to inow and
galactic wind episodes occuring during the galaxy evolution
its present stellar mass is  20 higher than the initial MG
The ducial model has LB  24  1010 L ie somewhat
fainter than the break luminosity of the Schechter luminosity
B  37  1010 L and therefore is represen-
function L
tative of the population of elliptical galaxies In this work
since we are particularly interested in the relation between
young galaxies and QSOs we will explore a mass range cor-
responding to luminosities around and above L
Table 1 summarizes the evolution of the gas and stellar
components of the galaxy The rst column identies the

galaxy in units of 1011 M the number between parenthe-

In this section we investigate the evolution of the ISM
and the star formation in our models We now proceed to
follow in some detail the evolution of the ducial model
Since the initial conditions are out of equilibrium the gas
is initially cold at the start of the calculations the gas falls
towards the centre and is compressed giving rise to shocks
that rapidly heat the gas in the core to approximately the
virial temperature of the system T  107 K Then a highly
ecient star formation is occurring throughout the galaxy
and a young stellar population is rapidly built up
Following the initial violent star formation burst the
rst Type II SNe appear at 32  106 yr and shortly after
the SN heating dominates the energetics of the ISM Fig 2
shows the evolution of the supernova rates over the whole
galaxy normalized to the initial protogalactic mass 21011
M for the ducial model The SN II rate reaches a max-
imum of 155 SNe 100 yr1 1011 M1 at 39  108 yr
and decreases rapidly after 1 Gyr The broad maximum of
the SN II rate reects the ongoing star formation during
the rst Gyr of the galaxy The present SN II rate is negli-
gible 38  104 SNe 100 yr1 1011 M1 at 13 Gyr
The Type II SNe are followed by the Type I SNe which
appear at 29  107 yr and attain a maximum rate of 19 SNe
100 yr1 1011 M1 at 76  108 yr After 1 Gyr the
SN I rate decreases less rapidly than the SN II rate and its
value at tG  13 Gyr is 020 SNe 100 yr1 1011 M1
Given MtG  238  1011 M and MLB   10 this
value corresponds to 017 SNU 1 SNU  1 SN 100 yr1

haviour cannot be extrapolated to the rst Gyr of the model
galaxy since the plateau of the SN I rate between 05 and 1
Gyr is not reproduced
The evolution of the gas velocity prole is shown in Fig
3 Three stages can be distinguished in the evolution of the
galaxy ISM The rst stage is a global inow extending from
the model inner boundary to the tidal radius At the begin-
ning of this stage the inow rises from the settling of the
gas into the potential well of the dark halo When the cen-
tral density has increased enough to allow radiative losses
to be important a vigorous cooling ow is established in
the inner kpc Later during this stage after the rst SNe
appear the SN heating drives a wind at intermediate radii
separating the global inow into an inner cooling ow feed-
ing the galaxy nucleus and an outer inow falling towards
the galaxy The wind advances towards the tidal radius and
when it reaches the tidal radius at tw  117 Gyr the second
stage begins characterized by a partial wind ie a cooling
ow in the inner regions of the galaxy and a wind in the
outer regions tw is to be identied with the onset of the
galactic wind As more gas is consumed by star formation
and expelled by the wind the stagnation region separating
the inner cooling ow from the wind moves inwards and at
18 Gyr the cooling ow has shrunk into the inner boundary
so that a wind is established from 100 pc to the tidal radius
characterizing the third total wind stage The wind at the
tidal radius reaches a peak velocity of 1860 km s1 at 2 Gyr
and decreases afterwards as the SN heating reduces due to
the SN I rate decrease
Fig 4 shows the evolution of the stellar mass and gas
fraction for the ducial galaxy From the mass evolution re-
sults of Table 1 and Fig 4 it is clear that the gas is a major
component of the galaxy during the rst Gyr of evolution
Gas is turned into stars by a high star formation rate but the
gas consumption is not complete since the continuous gas

infall constantly supply the galaxy with gas For the ducial
model the SFR is initially higher than the infall rate leading
to a decrease of the gas fraction as the stellar body of the
galaxy is built up The maximum SFR is  500 M yr1 at
6  108 yr By then the stellar mass is 2  1011 M When
the SFR has decreased to  200 M yr1 at 8  108 yr the
infall rate overtakes the SFR and the gas fraction reaches
a minimum of 03 and then starts to increase again The
increase of the galaxy mass due to infall goes on until the
onset of the galactic wind at tw  117 Gyr At this time
the galaxy mass has almost doubled MGtw  38  1011
M and approximately one third of the galaxy mass is in
the form of gas The galactic wind that follows is so mas-
sive that almost all the remaining gas is removed from the
galaxy The gas expelled with the galactic wind represents a
signicant fraction of the galaxy mass 13  1011 M from
tw until 13 Gyr The gas removal is very fast 5090 of
the gas is expelled in 23  108 yr 43  108 yr after tw
In later stages of evolution stellar losses continue to supply
mass to the wind which in turn depletes the gas During
this epoch the level of star formation is very low and as a
consequence newly formed stars do not replenish the dying
stars and the stellar mass decreases by 6  from tw until
now The net result of the early inow galactic wind and
stellar losses is that the present-day galaxy mass is  20 
higher than the initial protogalactic mass For other galaxy
masses there is also an increase of mass in the range of
15  30 but with no clear trend of MtGMG with MG
The model with nSF  13 has a somewhat larger increase
of 42 The only discrepancy is represented by model 20
anomalous in many ways in which the galactic wind oc-
curs very early and leads to a reduction in mass of 34

Figure 4 Evolution of the stellar mass solid line and of the
gas fraction dotted line for the ducial model
In this model due to the weak dependency of the SFR on
the density the SFR is proceeding at high eciency in the
outskirts of the galaxy and the resulting SN heating avoids
the massive initial infall typical of the other models
Fig 5 top panel shows for the ducial model the evo-
lution of the total SFR over the whole galaxy and of the
inner SFR inside the inner kpc The total SFR initially
has a value of 230 M yr1 As more fresh gas of the early
inow falls into the galaxy the gas is compressed thus reduc-
ing the star formation time scale Accordingly the SFR rises
up to a maximum of 480 M yr1 at 6  108 yr During the
rst Gyr the SFR is typically around 300 M yr1 At  1
Gyr the depletion of gas by star formation reduces the SFR
below 100 M yr1 The onset of the galactic wind at 117
Gyr leads to a drastic reduction of the SFR to  102 M
yr1 in less than 05 Gyr While the total SFR shows more
or less constant levels during the rst Gyr of evolution the
inner SFR inside a radius of 1 kpc shows dramatic varia-
tions due the short time scales for replenishment of gas and
inhibition of star formation It varies from 09 M yr1 at
t  0 to a maximum of 70 M yr1 at 7  108 yr with sev-
eral brief starburst episodes Over the rst Gyr of evolution
the inner SFR shows a typical range of 20  50 M yr1
Note that from the observational point of view the inner
SFR is more interesting than the total SFR because only
the inner regions of the galaxy due to their higher surface
brightness would have star formation activity detectable at
high redshifts
We have calculated for the ducial model the evolution
of the bolometric luminosity of the stellar population of the
whole galaxy top panel of Fig 5 by using the models of
spectrophotometric evolution of Bruzual  Charlot 1993
Initially the luminosity increases steadly while a young stel-
lar population is being built up At 33  108 yr the young
stellar population reaches 1011 M A maximum luminosity
of 23  1012 L is reached at 61  108 yr when the stellar

ulation of the whole galaxy in the ducial model dotted line
Lower panel evolution of the specic SFR averaged over the in-
ner kpc upper line and over the whole galaxy lower line
mass is 2  1011 M The peak in luminosity closely follows
the maximum in SFR since at this time the main contribu-
tion to the luminosity comes from high-mass stars It should
be noted that the luminosities of our models are more than
one magnitude lower than the luminosities in HF93 The
HF93 model M4 intended to represent a giant elliptical
has a peak bolometric luminosity of 2  1013 L at 01 Gyr
for a galaxy mass of 1011 M corresponding to a luminos-
ity of 4  1013 L for the mass of the ducial model Part
of this discrepancy arises from the atter IMF x  11
assumed by HF93 in model M4 but most of it comes from
the fact that HF93 models consider that the whole galaxy
is involved in a starburst In model M4 the SFR reaches
a pronounced maximum very rapidly at 01 Gyr and then
falls very rapidly The time scale for star formation over the
whole galaxy is  108 yr In our models by contrast the
SFR keeps approximately the same levels during the rst
Gyr of the galaxy
The lower panel of Fig 5 shows the evolution of the av-
erage specic SFR inside the inner kpc and over the whole
galaxy The star formation time scales in the inner region
are much shorter than over the whole galaxy At the begin-
ning of the calculations the star formation time scale is 1
Gyr over the whole galaxy and 108 yr in the inner kpc The
average specic SFR over the whole galaxy is typically be-
tween 1 and 3 Gyr1 during the rst Gyr Note that only
the central region of the galaxy is undergoing a violent star-
burst The average specic SFR inside 1 kpc is typically  30
Gyr1 during the rst Gyr The one-zone models of HF93
overestimate the luminosity of the galaxy because they as-
sume over the whole galaxy a very short time scale of star
formation  108 yr in order to reproduce the fast metal
ccid13 1996 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
enrichment needed to account for the metal lines observed
in high redshift QSOs and the high MgFe ratio in the nu-
clei of ellipticals But these constraints need to hold only
in the core of the galaxy In a multi-zone model only the
inner region of the galaxy shows these very short time scales
for star formation while a relatively modest star formation
eciency characterizes the whole galaxy leading to much
lower luminosities than in the one-zone models
4 THE GALACTIC WIND
In the early stages of the evolution of the galaxy the gas
content is always high Gas is turned into stars by a high
star formation rate but the gas consumption is never com-
plete because the global infall constantly supply the galaxy
with gas The increase of mass due to infall goes on until the
onset of the galactic wind The wind then removes almost
all gas from the galaxy As in the classic SN-driven wind
models the onset of galactic wind occurs later for the more
massive galaxiessee Table 1 In addition the wind removes
gas slower in more massive galaxies the duration of the early
wind phase increases steadly from 040 to 54 Gyr as MG
varies from 1011 M to 5  1012 M For all models the
wind occurs later than 1 Gyr The only exception is again
model 20 for which the galactic wind occurs very early at
44  107 yr For most of the models the galactic wind per-
sists until the present However in the most massive models
20 and 50 the very deep potential well causes the wind to
be reversed to outer inow at 118 and 88 Gyr respectively
so these models do not exhibit galactic winds at the present
epoch Note that in a cluster environment the higher pres-
sures and densities at the outer boundary could cause outer
inows even in less massive galaxies
As shown in Fig 6 the galactic wind can be very metal-
rich The central gas abundances soon become supersolar
at r  100 pc OH 1 at  108 yr and FeH 1 at
 3  108 yr After the wind has developed in the intermedi-
ate region of the galaxy a metal-rich gas front advances
outwards At the onset of the galactic wind tw  117
Gyr the gas metallicity at rt is low OH12  102
and FeH11  102 although in the inner regions the
gas is metal-rich OH29 and FeH56 at 1 kpc
There is a delay between mass removal and metal removal
by the wind When 90 of the gas has been removed at
159 Gyr the metallicity at the tidal radius OH08
and FeH14 is still
low in comparison to the inner
abundances OH32 and FeH89 at 1 kpc Only at
177 Gyr the metal-rich gas front reaches the tidal radius
OH13 and FeH81 at rt and a shallow gas abun-
dance gradient is established After this time the galactic
wind is very metal-rich The maximum metallicity is reached
at  2 Gyr OH13 and FeH89 at rt and then
decreases due to the dilution eect of stellar mass loss as
a higher fraction of H-rich gas is restored by lower-mass
stars The present-day metallicity of the gas is still high
OH11 and FeH30 at rt It is interesting to note
that the oxygen gradient is steeper than the iron gradient
OH28 and FeH39 at 1 kpc
Since the gas removed with the wind represents a mass
amount comparable to the stellar component of the galaxy
it will have an important impact on the intracluster or in-

tragroup medium where the galaxy is located In particular
the galactic wind carries metals synthesized by the stars and
therefore it is of great importance for the understanding of
the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium The
results of our models conrm the suggestion that elliptical
galaxies could explain the iron abundances in the intraclus-
ter medium ICM of X-ray clusters of galaxies David et
al 19901991 It is interesting to note that the late wind
phase ie from t  160 Gyr on makes the more important
contribution to the iron enrichment Only 69  107 M of
iron is expelled during the early wind phase that is 14 of
all iron ejected by the galaxy The oxygen enrichment of the
intracluster medium occurs much earlier with 47  108 M
being expelled during the early wind phase ie half the total
amount of oxygen 983  108 M ejected by the present
epoch This result is not unexpected since iron arises mostly
from Type Ia SNe and the longer lifetimes of the Type Ia SN
progenitors result in a delayed Fe enrichment By contrast
the early wind removes gas pre-enriched by -elements pro-
duced in Type II SNe during the rst few 108 yr of evolution
In any case one should take note of the important delays
in the enrichment of the ICM represented by the time scale
twe which is  15 Gyr for galaxies brighter than  01L
and in the case of iron enrichment by the arrival time of
the Fe-rich front at the boundary of the galaxy 177 Gyr
for the ducial model
The iron contribution to the ICM by the ellipticals could
be checked through the quantity MF eLB cl introduced
by Ciotti et al 1991 here MF e is the total iron mass in
the ICM and LB is the integrated blue luminosity of the
galaxies of the cluster Elliptical galaxies contribute most
of the luminous mass in the most X-ray luminous clusters In
the ducial model the galactic wind ejects until the present

493  108 M of iron which is mixed to the ICM Consid-
ering this model as representative of the cluster ellipticals
and assuming MLB   10 for the stellar mass in the clus-
ter from M  238  1011 M we obtain MF eLB cl 
21102 M L in good agreement with the value inferred
from observations MF eLBcl  102 M L Ciotti et
al 1991 therefore giving support to the thesis that enrich-
ment by ellipticals explains the ICM iron abundances The
ratio MwF eM is approximately constant  2  103 over
the mass range MG  1011 1012 M and also for the model
213 In the most massive models 20 and 50 this ratio is
reduced to 14  103 and 75  104 respectively because
the increase of the iron abundance as a result of a longer
building-up time does not counterbalance the decrease of
the fraction of mass ejected with the depth of the potential
well In model 20 the higher MwF eM 3  103 is due
to the large amount of metals ejected with the wind with
little metal being locked in stars
We should take note of one possible problem regard-
ing the iron abundances of the wind predicted by our mod-
els which are too high in comparison to those derived from
X-ray observations From BBXRT observations and one-
temperatures ts Serlemitsos et al 1993 have estimated
the metallicity of NGC 1399 and NGC 4472 to be 018-
138 and 011-066 times solar 90 condence respec-
tively This low abundance is in contradiction with ROSAT
measurements of Forman et al 1994 who determined the
iron abundance of NGC 4472 to be 1-2 times solar A more
extended sample of early-type galaxies observed with the
ASCA satellite however has conrmed the subsolar abun-
dances found by the BBXRT The analysis of galaxies in
the Virgo cluster including NGC 4742 nds that the abun-
dances of Fe and other elements are  05 solar Awaki et al
1994 Matsushita et al 1994 and exceptionally low abun-
dances Z  015 solar are derived for NGC 1404 and NGC
4374 M84 located in the Fornax and Virgo clusters respec-
tively Loewenstein et al 1994 However the present X-ray
spectral analysis has several uncertainties that may lead to
spurious results for abundances For instance problems have
been encountered with the basic plasma emission models for
the Fe L complex during the analysis of the ASCA spectra
of the cooling ows in the Perseus Centaurus and A1795
clusters Fabian et al 1994 The consistency of the spectro-
scopic data with the plasma emission models was achieved
only with a recalculation of the Fe L-shell spectra with a
novel atomic physics package and an update of the Fe data
Liedahl et al 1995
These low abundances if real severely constrain the
Type Ia supernova enrichment of the ISM of early-type
galaxies In particular the present SN Ia rate may be lower
than that of our models In fact the SN I rate predicted
by the ducial model is at the upper end of the values de-
rived from the observations a reduction by 14-13 is still
consistent with the observations On the other hand Type
II SNe may have a larger share in the Fe enrichment of the
ICM either by an IMF atter than the Salpeter one as the
x  095 IMF invoked by Arimoto  Yoshii 1987 to re-
produce the broad-band colors of giant ellipticals or by an
increased lower-mass cuto of the IMF as in the high-mass
mode of star formation proposed for the early evolution of
ellipticals Elbaz Arnaud  Vangioni-Flam 1995 Another
possibility is that the abundances in the hot gas arise from
incomplete mixing of the supernova ejecta as relatively metal
rich inhomogeneities cool very fast decoupling from the hot
gas Loewenstein et al 1994 Finally in the case of galaxies
in clusters the infall of gas from the ICM leads to metal-
licities in the X-ray galactic corona reecting the subsolar
abundances of the ICM
5 ABUNDANCES OF THE STELLAR
POPULATION
Table 2 shows the abundances of the stellar population at
the present hMgHi1 and hFeHi1 the Mg and Fe abun-
dances mass-averaged over the inner kpc hMgHi10 and
hFeHi10 the Mg and Fe abundances mass-averaged in-
side 10 kpc 10 kpc is roughly the eective radius of an L
galaxy The code for the models is the same as in Table 1
The core r  1 kpc of our model galaxies is metal-rich
in agreement with the metallicities of 2-3 for the nucleus
of elliptical galaxies derived from observations of the Mg2
indices For the ducial model both magnesium and iron
exhibit central overabundances at the present MgH34
and FeH25 at 100 pc MgH20 and FeH12 at 1
kpc At larger radii however the abundances become sub-
solar MgH067 and FeH029 at 10 kpc indicating
the presence of abundance gradients in the galaxy stellar
population
Metallicity gradients for the stellar population of early-
type galaxies have been inferred from measurements of line-
strength gradients Gorgas Efstathiou  Salamanca 1990

ccid13 1996 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Elliptical Galaxies and QSOs
by abundance ratios derived from Mg and Fe line strengths
based on Mg2 Fe5270 and Fe5335 indices It seems that
Mg is overabundant with respect to Fe in giant ellipticals
The ratio MgFe exhibits a large scatter around 15-20
Worthey et al 1992 This high ratio is interpreted as a
signature of enrichment by Type II SNe implying that the
formation of an elliptical was very rapid otherwise the iron
enrichment by Type Ia SNe would have shifted the MgFe
ratio to solar or subsolar values Our models predict a range
of 11  18 for MgFe This reproduces well the observa-
tions indicating that the star formation time scale of 108
yr chosen as normalization of the SFR based on results of
one-zone models is also appropriate for the our dynamical
model Again model 20 is discrepant from the rest As
a consequence of the very early galactic wind MgFe is
shifted to very high values 24  27 due to a very high
dominance of SN II in the chemical enrichment and little
metal is locked in the stars so the core is not metal-rich
One important result we can derive from Table 2 is that
the metallicity increases with the galaxy mass and thus the
well-known metallicity-mass relation for ellipticals is repro-
duced by our models The trend of increasing metallicity
with mass is stronger for the abundances averaged inside
a smaller aperture For a larger aperture the metallicity-
mass relation is less smooth The metallicity-mass relation
is a consequence of the occurrence of galactic winds which
appear later for galaxies with deeper gravitational wells
thus allowing more metal enrichment for the gas and the
stars formed from it a mechanism rst suggested by Larson
1974b The consistency of the galactic wind scenario can
be seen from the results of Table 1 which shows that given
a star formation law the time for the onset of the galactic
wind increases with the galaxy mass
One further prediction from Table 2 is a clear although
not strictly monotonic trend of decreasing MgFe ratio
with the galactic mass for the models with standard SFR
hMgFei1 hMgFei10 shows a maximum of 168 183
for model 2 note that the respective values for model 1 are
159 and 182 and a minimum of 108 119 for model 50
However this prediction seems to be at variance with the
observations of the stellar population in ellipticals which
suggest a slight trend of increasing MgFe ratio with the
galactic luminosity albeit with a large scatter Worthey et
al 1992 Weiss Peletier  Matteucci 1995 The reason for
the increase of MgFe with MG in our models is that under
the our assumption of star formation time scale independent
of galactic mass  1
0  108 yr the galactic wind happens
later for more massive objects As a result the MgFe ratio
tends to decrease with the galactic mass because the bulk
of iron is produced by type Ia SNe with a  1 Gyr delay
relative to the -elements produced by type II SNe on much
shorter time scales Note that for the sake of simplicity our
models assume that 1 the specic SFR is independent of
the galactic mass 2 the IMF is the same for all elliptical
galaxies see Matteucci 1994 If we relax the assumption
1 the predicted MgFe trend could be conciliated with
the observations if the star formation in giants ellipticals
is faster than in smaller ellipticals so favouring magnesium
production over iron production Another way to achieve
a increase of MgFe with the galactic mass is a variable
IMF with the slope of the IMF decreasing with the galactic
mass which leads to a larger proportion of massive stars in

10 kpc and for the iron the respective values are -032 and
-060 The abundance gradients are expected to be atter
when the dependence of the SFR on density is weaker This
is conrmed by the model 213 which exhibits magnesium
iron abundance gradients of -018 -028 for 100 pc  r 
1 kpc and -049 -061 for 1  r  10 kpc although the
abundance gradients do not change dramatically It should
be noted that our models tend to overestimate the abun-
dance gradients since the stars are moved only to reproduce
a King prole the newly formed stars are stored in shells
and each shell is moved as a whole entity to their nal po-
sition Our models do not include orbital mixing ie the
distribution of orbits of individual stars in which case the
stars at a given radius would have apocentres spanning a
wide range of radii The inclusion of orbital mixing would
lead to the attening of the metallicity gradients This eect
however would have little impact on the central abundances
of the galaxies
Note that a high metallicity stellar core is rapidly built
up The central stellar magnesium abundance becomes su-
persolar at 19  108 yr and the iron abundance at 83  108
yr respectively Therefore the conditions required by the
starburst model of QSOs TB93 a metal-rich stellar pop-
ulation and a metal-rich ambient gas as seen in Section 4
are achieved in the early stages of the evolution of ellipticals

6 EVOLUTION OF THE LUMINOSITY OF
The luminosity function LF of QSOs undergoes strong evo-
lution between z  2 and the present epoch with the red-
shift dependence of the LF being well-described by a con-
stant comoving space density and a pure power-law lumi-
nosity evolution Lz  1  zk Boyle et al 1988 1991
BT98 Estimates of the rate of evolution k lie in the range
31  k  36 corresponding to an evolution in terms of
cosmic time t of the form LQSOt  tn with 2  n  35
depending on the choice of cosmology
Both in the supermassive black hole scenario and in
the starburst model for AGN the QSO luminosity evolu-
tion is linked to the mass ow into the galactic nucleus In
both cases the QSO luminosity is proportional to the aver-
age mass accretion rate via either gravitational energy su-
permassive black hole or massive stars activity starburst
model Two central assumptions are common to both ap-
proaches to explain the luminosity function of QSOs 1 the
luminosity of the QSO is proportional to the mass of the host
galaxy and 2 virtually all bright galaxies have harboured
a QSO AGN during their evolution
Our models develop a central cooling ow as soon as
the gas central density has increased enough to allow radia-
tive losses to be important The cooling ow extends over
a considerable span of their evolution and in most cases
when enough gas has been consumed by star formation or
removed by gas ows SN heating becomes more important
than radiative cooling and the central cooling ow is extin-
guished As shown below the fate of the central cooling ow
depends on the galaxy mass and the star formation law We
now proceed to investigate whether the time-dependency of
the central cooling ow rate in our models could be respon-
sible for the observed evolution of QSOs
Table 3 gives relevant information about the evolution
of the central cooling ow for several models see Table 1 for
the keys to the models MctG the mass deposited by the
central into the inner 100 pc cooling ow until the present

ishes when Mc reaches a minimum

the total mass of the rst central inow have been deposited
in the galactic nucleus by 1 Gyr This time is the typical time
scale for the completion of the large spheroids If we consider
that this event concides with the QSO phenomenon the
epoch when the QSO activity was at its peak 2  z  3
Schmidt et al 1991 corresponds to the epoch of galaxy
formation 321  zGF  654 Gyr a reasonable range in a
number of scenarios for galaxy formation
As seen in Section 3 the initial global inow stage is
followed by a partial wind stage during which a wind is
established in the outer regions of the galaxy The stagnation
region separating the wind and the inow moves inwards
until only a wind is present throughout the galaxy In some
cases the total wind persists until the present epoch and no
material restored by the stars is accumulated in the galaxy
That is the single partial wind sequence the partial wind
occurs only once
global inow  partial wind  total wind
In some models however after some time the gas in the
inner regions is not swept out rapidly enough and starts ac-
cumulating until a central cooling ow is established again
The occurrence of the late partial wind characterizes a sec-
ond type of gas ow sequence the multiple partial wind se-
global inow  partial wind  total wind  partial
wind
The three models which exhibit late partial winds  models
10 20 and 213  illustrate the three possible fates of
the late partial wind In the rst place the partial wind
could persist until the present model 10 Other possibility
is that it develops into a global cooling ow extending from
the nucleus to the tidal radius of the galaxy That is the case
of model 20 in which the outer wind reverses to outer inow
at 118 Gyr Finally the central inow could be halted by
supernova heating due to the resulting starburst occurring
in the galaxy core as in model 213 There is one further
type of gas ow sequence in which the total wind never
occurs that is
global inow  partial wind  global inow
This sequence is exhibited by the very massive model 50
In this model the central cooling ow is never turned o
and more than 1010 M has been deposited into the nucleus
by the present epoch Due to the large potential well of the
galaxy the galactic wind stalls early and an outer inow is
established at 88 Gyr
As seen from Fig 8 in our models the central inow
rate exhibits a large variety of evolutionary sequences some
of which combine features of the continuous and recurrent
activity exhibiting in many cases late cooling ow episodes
which can be weak or vigorous short- or long-lived All the
models however show during the rst Gyr a massive depo-
sition rate followed by a declining accretion rate evolution
The rst central cooling ow episode common to all models
extends for 2  3 Gyr The early evolution of the rst cool-
ing ow is subject to considerable uctuations An early
secondary maximum is apparent between 30 and 60 Myr
and it is followed by a decrement in the inow rate as the
heating due to Type II SNe inhibits the cooling ow From
108 yr on the inow rate increases until it reaches the abso-
lute maximum By then and during the following decline of
Mc the evolution is relatively smooth The peak inow rate
occurs at 038067 Gyr for the models with nSF  12 and
is earlier for the most massive models For model 213 it
is at 094 Gyr and for model 20 it is at 017 Gyr

The t to the declining part of the evolution of the cool-
ing ow rate by Mc  tnc1 gives values of nc1 in the range
43  nc1  25 The values of nc1 refers only to the rst
cooling ow episode and describe only the 1-3 Gyrs follow-
ing the maximum in Mc The principal conclusion that nc1
and tcf1 allows us to derive is that under the assumption
of proportionality of the luminosity to Mc the most active
phase of the QSO is likely to occur during a short span of
time since the galaxy formation and that the early evolu-
tion of luminosity is very steep which is consistent with the
derived evolution of the QSO LF
One particularly interesting model is 213 because it
exhibits recurrence of late central inow episodes As the SN
I rate decreases the wind stalls the gas starts accumulating
in the galaxy core and the radiative losses drive a new cen-
tral cooling ow The late central inow episodes are brief
and quickly put out by the resulting burst of star formation
The duration of the late cooling ow episodes is a few times
107 yr and since the separation between them is typically a
few Gyr their duty cycle is  1100 The turning on and o
of the central inow could correspond to the active and
inactive states of the core in both the supermassive black
hole model of AGN and the starburst model of AGN In
addition the length of the duty cycle of the central inow
increases with time and the amount of material deposited
decreases implying a steep decrease of the time-averaged
luminosity of any central activity powered by the infalling
material For the model 213 the second central inow oc-
curs at t  4 Gyr and involves 15  107 M and the third
one of 84  106 M happens at t  95 Gyr Note that also
in model 20 the late central inow episode at t  5 Gyr
is inhibited by SN heating following the starburst in the
galactic core However the deep potential well of this model
guarantees that at the end a massive central inow prevails
Episodic models of QSO activity have already been put
forward to explain the observed evolution of the QSO LF
both in the supermassive black hole scenario Cavaliere 
Padovani 1986 and in the starburst model TB93 In the
starburst model the SFR in the galactic core actually re-
sponsible for the AGN activity is represented by a series
of narrow  107 yr peaks In this model between z  2
and the present the galaxy core undergoes between 3 and
5 successive bursts of QSO activity with their amplitude
being modulated by a power law with time of the form
SF Rmax  t2 This power law evolution is found in the
elliptical galaxy models of Larson 1974a which however
refers to a continuous evolution of the SFR instead of an
episodic one
It is interesting that just changing the star formation
ccid13 1996 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
law from nSF  12 in the ducial model to nSF  13 gives
rise to the appearance of short episodes of inow lasting
 3  107 yr similar to those appearing in the episodic
scenario As matter of fact the time scale above refers to
the nal more vigorous part of the inow episode when the
central inow rate suddenly becomes larger than 102  01
M yr1 The total duration of each episode is some 108 yr
characterized in its rst phase by an inow at a low rate cf
the left wing in the second cooling ow event of model 213
in Fig 8 Once the inow rate becomes larger the cooling
ow is extinguished by the resulting star formation burst
The fact that evolution of the inow rate with recurrent
late cooling ow episodes appears naturally in model 213
gives support to the episodic scenario of QSO activity
The models with a deep potential well models 10 20
and 50 have massive cooling ows that are well-developed at
the present in some cases having been initiated very recently
model 10 In models 20 and 50 the late cooling ow is
particularly large with 13  109 M and 88  109 M
respectively accumulated in the nucleus during the second
central inow episode These massive late cooling ows are
distinct from the short-lived events required by the episodic
models of QSO activity in that their duration is  1 Gyr or

the ability of our models to account for the luminosities
of the brightest QSOs The present stellar mass 66  1012

ing to a stellar mass of 62  1012 M for MLB   10
Model 50 has a peak central inow rate of 20 M yr1 at
38  108 yr The expected bolometric luminosity LBol 
f M c2  57  1046f  M  M yr1 erg s1 is 11  1047 erg
s1 for an eciency f of mass-energy conversion of 01 This
bolometric luminosity is typical of very bright distant QSOs
but it fails to explain the bolometric luminosities of the
brightest QSOs  1048 erg s1 It should be noted how-
ever that the bright end of the QSO LF is contaminated by
luminosity overestimates due to beaming and gravitational
lensing In addition the luminosity estimated above assumes
that the mass ow rate through the inner 100 pc radius is
directly deposited into the central energy source of the QSO
It is expected that the evolution of the central inow rate
will modulate any central activity inside the galaxy nucleus
but the present calculations do not intend to describe in de-
tail the region inside the 100 pc radius As a matter of fact
the interaction gas ow-central engine may take place at a
much smaller scale than the inner boundary In particular

several models for QSO activity By the time of peak depo-

ity involving such amount of mass at a conversion eciency

sort of central engine inside the galaxy nucleus is the Edding-

implies LE  941047 erg s1 a value that even disregard-
ing beaming eects could explain the highest luminosities
of QSOs In addition if we take into account the trend of
MLB  to increase with galaxy mass Terlevich 1992 then
the most luminous galaxies have MLB   20 implying a
larger mass than that inferred from the blue luminosity us-
ing MLB   10  In this case scaling the luminosities to
model 50 LE exceeds 1048 erg s1
The evolution of Mc in our models allows us to make
predictions about the QSO LF Specically we now proceed
to calculate the QSO LF in the redshift range 20  z  29
in order to compare our results with the observational blue
QSO LF of Boyle et al 1991 In view of the energetic di-
culties with the continuous evolution of activity we assume
that the luminosity of the QSO is due to short episodes of
nuclear activity resulting from the fast consumption of the
gas accumulated in the nucleus by the central inow For il-
lustrative purposes we consider only the rst inow episode
and that two nuclear activity events occur during the rst
central inow Based on the results of Table 3 we consider
that the duration of the rst inow is 2 Gyr We assume the
rst activity event at 1 Gyr and the second one at 2 Gyr
From the ratio M 
c Mc1 we assume that 75  of Mc1 is
consumed by the rst event and 25  by the second one For
the estimate of the LF of galactic nuclei at high redshifts
we need to scale the present-day elliptical galaxy LF both in
luminosity and in space density The present-day elliptical

300  2000 pc As we can see from Fig 9 the supermassive
black hole model leaves room for an eciency of mass-energy
conversion somewhat lower than f  01 whereas the nu-
clear starburst although it can explain the luminosities of
the brightest QSOs systematically underestimates the den-
sity number of QSOs due to the smallness of its duty cycle
Note that in both cases there is a remarkable agreement
in shape between the predicted and the observed QSO LF
at high redshifts Also the early evolution of the LF is well
described by our models This is illustrated in Fig 9 by a

which adjusts the 2  z  29 data In this case the evolu-
tion from 2  z  29 to 125  z  2 is reproduced Since
we are focusing only on the rst inow episode which ex-
tends only for  3 Gyr the predictions of our models refer
only to the early z  1 evolution of the QSO luminosity
Note that the masses of the central black hole or nu-
clear star cluster produced by the rst inow episode up
to  1010 M are consistent the evidence of Dark Massive
Objects DMOs in the nuclei of both active and quiescent
galaxies see reviews by Kormendy  Richstone 1995 and
van der Marel 1996 So far the masses are in the range
2  106  3  109 M with the largest mass found for M87
There is a correlation of increasing MDO mass with the lu-
minosity of the galaxy and since M87 has MB  214
DMOs as massive as 1010 M are expected for MB  24
galaxies But such galaxys are very rare and the correspond-
ing DMOs would be unlikely to be found in the volume of
the Universe searched for DMOs until now M87 is the far-
thest DMO host at 15 Mpc Finally one important success
of our models is that the average MDO-to-galaxy mass ratio
of  0003 Kormendy  Richstone 1995 is reproduced by
the range   00015  0005 of our models
7 CONCLUSIONS
In this work we explored the relation between young ellip-
tical galaxies and QSOs within a chemo-dynamical model
for evolution of galaxies In this model we perform a multi-
zone modelling of the chemical enrichment of the gas and
stars of a galaxy taking into account the gas ow obtained
self-consistently from 1-D hydrodynamical calculations We
were particularly interested in the cooling ow towards the
centre of the galaxy which could feed a QSO hosted in the
galactic nucleus
From a minimal set of assumptions based on standard
one-zone chemical evolution models our model reproduces
the main observational features of elliptical galaxies 1 the
central metallicities of massive galaxies are supersolar 2 the
ratio MgFe is supersolar in the core of the galaxy as well
as over the whole galaxy 3 the galaxy shows sizable metal-
licity gradients 4 systems with larger masses tend to have
larger metallicities thus reproducing the mass-metallicity
relation of elliptical galaxies 5 elliptical galaxies can be
the main responsibles for the ICM iron content the ICM
iron mass per unit luminosity of cluster galaxies  102
M L is reproduced
One very important time scale for the enrichment of the
ICM is the time twe of the end of early wind phase during
which the gas content in the galaxy is reduced by a factor
of ten twe is longer than  15 Gyr for normal or bright

fers from that in TB93 model in that here we focus only

core of the galaxy comprising 5  of the galaxy mass inside

galaxies For the iron enrichment the relevant time scale
is even longer because the Fe-rich gas front arrives at the
galaxy edge later than twe
From the success of the model in reproducing ellipti-
cal galaxies a number of standard assumptions of the clas-
sic one-zone chemical evolution models remain valid when
the hydrodynamics is considered 108 yr star formation time
scale Salpeter IMF stellar yields ASN I  01 However the
linear star formation law usually adopted by one-zone mod-
els seems to be excluded since the resulting model would be
unrealistic not reproducing the properties of elliptical galax-
ies as seen from the drawbacks of model 20 too low central
metallicities too high MgFe ratio the nucleus mass is too
small to explain the luminosity of a QSO
We should take note of two possible discrepancies be-
tween the results of our models and the observations 1 su-
persolar metallicities are predicted for the hot gas in the
galactic halo while ASCA measurements imply subsolar
abundances 2 we predict a trend of MgFe decreasing
with galactic mass which is the opposite of the trend in-
ferred from determinations of metal indices If these contra-
dictions are real they could indicate that some of the stan-
dard assumptions of the chemical evolution modelling do not
apply We should be aware however of the uncertainties in
deriving the abundances in the hot galactic halos besides
the dilution by the ICM which lowers the metallicity in
the halo and of the diculties in obtaining MgFe trends
from the observed variation of Mg and Fe line strengths with
the galaxy mass
In addition to the fact that the model satisfy a number
of observational constraints on ellipticals it makes denite
predictions about the relation between the evolution of el-
lipticals and that of QSOs
A high-metallicity core is rapidly built-up For the gas
solar metallicities are reached in 108 yr for oxygen and
3  108 yr for iron For the stars the magnesium abun-
dance becomes solar at 2  108 yr and the iron at 8  108 yr
In this way the high abundances derived for high redshift
QSOs are reached in a reasonably short time scale One im-
portant application of these results is that the enrichment
time scales predicted by our chemo-dynamical model pro-
vide a chemical clock which could constrain cosmological
scenarios For instance the  1 Gyr time scale for metal
production implies an age at least larger than 1 Gyr for the
Universe at z  5 since even the more distant QSOs exhibit
metals in their spectra In addition the short time scales for
enrichment both of gas and stars make plausible the star-
burst model for AGN which requires a high metallicity core
formed early in the evolution of the galaxy
It is important to note that the luminosity and metal-
licity of QSOs identied with the central region of the young
elliptical are explained with no need for all the galaxy having
a global starburst coordinated with the central starburst
In this way extremely high luminosities  1015 L are
avoided for the proto-QSO These extreme luminosities pre-
dicted by one-zone models of formation of elliptical galaxies
eg model M4 of HF93 have never been detected in high
redshift observations Note that probably only the inner re-
gions of the young galaxy due to their higher surface bright-
ness would have star formation detectable at high redshifts
As a matter of fact deep spectroscopy observations have
revealed a population of star-forming galaxies at redshift
3  z  35 the Lyman break galaxies LBGs discovered
on the basis of a Lyman limit break superposed on their UV
continuum Steidel et al 1996 Giavalisco Steidel  Mac-
chetto 1996 The LBGs show many characteristics expected
for primeval galaxies and assuming a Salpeter IMF their
inferred SFRs are in the range 4  90h2
50 M yr1 inside
a typical half-light radius of 18h1
50 kpc q0  05 These
levels of star formation are remarkably close to the typical
range of 20  50 M yr1 for the SFR inside a radius of
1 kpc in the ducial model In addition the LBGs are ex-
pected to be the high-redshift counterparts of the present-
day spheroidal component of luminous galaxies since their
co-moving density is roughly comparable to that of present-
day bright L  L galaxies and the widths of the interstel-
lar absorption lines in their spectra imply circular velocities
of 170  300 km s1 typical of the potential well depth of
luminous ellipticals Therefore for z  35 the observations
of ongoing star formation in galaxies seems to rule out the
high luminosities predicted by the one-zone models for the
progenitors of present-day  L galaxies
The luminosities of the one-zone model could still be
consistent with the observations of LBGs if there is dust
absorbing the blue and UV light and re-emitting it in the far-
IRsub-mm However comparisons between the observed
colours of LBGs and those predicted by spectral synthe-
sis models Pettini et al 1998 indicate only modest dust
attenuation an extinction at 1500 A between lower and up-
per limits of  2 and  6 and therefore dust absorp-
tion is unable to hide the high luminosities of the one-zone
model In addition in view of the evidence that the LGBs
are the progenitors of the present-day luminous  L or
brighter galaxies rather than sub-units being assembled
into a larger system it seems that the LBGs are allowing
us to witness one stage in a single event of formation of
a massive galaxy with the global star formation proceed-
ing however at a milder rate than in the one-zone model
In the end the main reason why the one-zone model over-
predicts the luminosity is that it overproduces metals The
model M4 of HF93 predicts  10 times the solar metallic-
ity over the whole galaxy The observations however allow
this extremely high metallicity only at the very nucleus of
the galaxy at most Over an eective radius the metallicity
of a giant elliptical is roughly solar These metallicities are
correctly predicted by our multi-zone model see the values
of hMgHi10 and hFeHi10 in Table 3 Moreover assum-
ing that the observed negative metallicity gradients continue
beyond the eective radius the mass-averaged metallicity
would be subsolar over the whole galaxy Therefore scal-
ing the metals produced in the one-zone approximation to
amounts consistent with the observations brings down the
predicted luminosities by about one order of magnitude
All our models predict a massive central through the
inner 100 pc cooling ow during the rst 1-2 Gyr of the
galaxy evolution Within the scenario in which the luminos-
ity of the galactic nucleus is fed by the central inow for
a reasonable epoch of formation of the spheroidal systems
the epoch of building-up of the nucleus by the central inow
coincides with the maximum in QSO activity 2  z  3
Also the decrease of the central inow rate for t  1 Gyr is
consistent with the decline of luminosity inferred for z  2
from the evolution of QSO LF with redshift
One of our models exhibits recurrent late central cooling
ccid13 1996 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
ow episodes which are brief a few 107 yr and involve
decreasing amounts of mass The gas inow into the inner
100 pc is regulated by episodes of star formation leading
naturally to several short episodes of central inow thus
giving support to the episodic scenario for evolution of the
LF of QSOs
The model also explains the luminosities of QSOs The
central cooling ow rates explain bolometric luminosities of
up to 1047 erg s1 for an eciency f of mass-energy con-
version of 01 However the bolometric luminosities of the
brightest QSOs  1048 erg s1 cannot be explained by a
continuous deposition of the central inow Rather the high-
est QSO luminosities require a discrete deposition in which
the gas is accumulated during  1 Gyr and then consumed
by a central engine in few 107 yr Accordingly we have made
some predictions on the QSO LF at z  1 based on a simple
discontinuous model for QSO activity in which there is two
short gas consumption events during the rst central inow
episode We scaled the QSO LF to the present day elliptical
LF assuming that all ellipticals have harboured a QSO dur-
ing their evolution Both the starburst and the supermassive
black hole models predict the right shape of the QSO LF
but the nuclear starburst systematically underestimates the
density number of QSOs In addition our model reproduces
the evolution of the LF between z  125 and z  29 In
our models the mass deposited by the rst central inow
represents 015-05  of the present day luminous mass of
the galaxy Assuming that this mass goes to the formation of
a central object star cluster or black hole the model cor-
rectly predicts for the Dark Massive Objects DMOs in the
nuclei of galaxies both the masses and the DMO-to-galaxy
mass ratios
Another conclusion derived from our models is that the
hosts of high-redshift AGN should be relatively mature ob-
jects The calculated evolution of the inner cooling ow and
energetic considerations imply that the gas deposited by the
inow in the nucleus should accumulate during  1 Gyr
before triggering a short-lived AGN activity event On the
other hand except for extremely large galaxies present-day
MB  24 the rst massive cooling ow responsible for
maintaining the AGN activity lasts for 2  3 Gyr In this
scenario if the high redshift galaxy is to display strong AGN
activity its probable age would range from  1 to  3 Gyrs
The minimum age of  1 Gyr for QSO hosts derived above
is consistent with the  1 Gyr time scale for metal enrich-
ment needed to explain the strong metal lines observed even
in z  5 QSOs
One further prediction of our models is that at the
present only the most massive objects should be host to
powerful AGN but at high redshift powerful AGN activ-
ity is expected even for hosts of smaller mass Interestingly
enough this is what seems to be observed for radio galaxies
at least Models 1 and 2 are examples of sub-L galaxies with
strong AGN activity at high redshift Note that  increases
with decreasing galaxy mass for masses below MG  1012
M Since this parameter describes the relative importance
of the rst cooling ow episode occuring when the galaxy is
less than 2  3 old this means that for the lower mass sys-
tems the eciency of building-up the nucleus is higher than
in larger systems and that they have an early cooling ow
massive enough to sustain a strong AGN activity However
this activity is limited only to the 2-3 rst Gyr of the galaxy
ccid13 1996 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Elliptical Galaxies and QSOs
and therefore smaller systems with strong nuclear activity
are to be found only at high redshift Even in the case of the
episodic scenario of model 213 the late nuclear activity
is much weaker at low redshift in this model the two late
central inow episodes deposit only 18  and 1  of the
mass of the rst inow episode On the other hand models
10 20 and 50 exhibit a present-day massive central cooling
ow which could trigger AGN activity In these massive sys-
tems the late cooling ow may accumulate into the nucleus
an amount of mass comparable to that of the early cool-
ing ow model 20 is typical of this case the late cooling
ow deposits 165  109 M ie 47  of the mass of the
rst cooling ow Only these objects therefore would har-
bour intense AGN activity at low redshift Support to this
picture is given by recent analysis of host galaxies of pow-
erful nearby z  03 AGN belonging to three samples 
radio galaxies radio-loud quasars and radio-quiet quasars
Taylor et al 1996 For all three classes of AGN the host
galaxies are large half-light radius r12  10 kpc and lu-
minous K-band luminosity LK  L Note that the less
massive model exhibiting a present-day central is model 10
with MB  218 or LB  2L
Finally we should note that although pure luminos-
ity evolution seems to reproduce the evolution of the QSO
LF in our models the individual QSOs do not dim over
cosmological time scales but rather are short-lived ie
ton  1  3  107 yr In order to comply with the ener-
getic requirements of the QSOs their activity must occur
in short episodes of massive consumption of mass accumu-
lated in the galactic nucleus during a much longer span of
time  1 Gyr This sort of episodic activity displayed by
our model for QSOs seems to be a rule among the AGN
in general since for other class of AGN the radio galaxies
the radio LF also seems to follow pure luminosity evolution
and yet the radio sources themselves seem to have lifetimes
of only a few 107 yr As a matter of fact a comparison be-
tween the properties of the radio-loud population and the
present model would be very useful to clarify the relation
of the QSO phenomenon and the early evolution of ellipti-
cal galaxies since radio observations allow us to explore the
z  2 domain without the need of uncertain corrections for
dust absorption and lensing bias that hamper the optical
tecniques
