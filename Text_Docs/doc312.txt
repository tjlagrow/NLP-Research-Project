ABSTRACT
The redshifts of lens galaxies in known gravitational lens systems probe the volume
distribution of lensing mass Following earlier work by Kochanek we re-derive the lens
redshift probability distribution allowing for mass and number density evolution of
the lensing galaxies and apply this test to a much enlarged sample of lens systems
From a literature survey of all known lenses we have selected an unbiased sample of
15 lenses with complete redshift information For a at Universe and no lens evolution
we can only put an upper limit on the cosmological constant of   089 at the 95
CL   07 and no evolution is consistent with the data Allowing for evolution in
an m  03   07 cosmology we nd that the best-t evolution in  ie the
characteristic velocity dispersion in a Schechter-like function of early-type galaxies
in the redshift range z  0 to 1 is d log zdz  010  006 This is consistent
with no evolution and implies that at 95 CL  of early-type galaxies at z  1
was at least 63 of its current value Alternatively if there is no mass evolution a
present-day value of   175 km s1 for elliptical galaxies is required 95 CL

INTRODUCTION
A number of recent measurements all point to a cosmology
dominated by dark energy The power spectrum of uctu-
ations in the cosmic microwave background indicates a at
geometry eg Bennett et al 2003 while various measure-
ments of the fraction of the closure density in matter lead
to consistent values of m  03 eg Turner 2002 Ob-
servations of high-redshift supernovae Ia Riess et al 1998
Perlmutter et al 1999 imply that the fraction of the closure
density in the form of a cosmological constant is   07
However some results obtained from gravitational lens-
ing statistics appear to be at odds with this picture The
incidence of lensing among optically-selected quasars and
their image-separation distribution indicate   07 at

Kochanek  Munoz 1998 also nd   073 at the 95
CL Chiba  Yoshii 1999 have recalculated the predicted
lensing statistics using revised values for the galaxy lumi-
nosity function parameters and have argued that a Universe
with   07 is the most likely one Kochanek et al 1998

defended their choice of luminosity function parameters as
the one that is most consistent with the observed luminosi-
ties of lens galaxies Recently Chae et al 2002 derived
constraints on cosmological parameters from analysis of ra-
dio selected gravitational lenses from the Cosmic Lens All
Sky Survey CLASS They nd a best t   07  02
and constrain   0 at 95 CL assuming the most re-
cent galaxy luminosity function parameters from the 2dF
survey Madgwick et al 2002 and the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey SDSS Blanton et al 2001 Note that contrary to
previous lensing statistics studies in Chae et al 2002 the
velocity dispersion associated with a galaxy of given lumi-
nosity was left as a free parameter rather than being set by
direct observations Their best t velocity dispersions have
relatively low values which result in low lensing cross sec-
tions This may be the main reason why their analysis favors
a relatively high value of 
Rix et al 1994 investigated the impact of hierarchi-
cal galaxy mergers on the statistics of gravitational lens-
ing of distant sources They showed that the total number
of multiple-image lenses in a sample of potential sources is
quite insensitive to mergers but merging leads to a smaller
mean separation of observed multiple images Since merging
does not reduce drastically the expected lensing frequency
EO Ofek et al
it cannot make -dominated cosmologies compatible with
the existing lensing observations eg Maoz  Rix 1993
Malhotra Rhoads  Turner 1997 have suggested that
small-separation lensing statistics can be reconciled with
an -dominated Universe by invoking dust in the lensing
galaxies The excess number of lensed quasars would then
be hidden by extinction Falco et al 1999 found a mean
extinction value of EBV  004 006 for lens galaxies
in optically-selected radio-selected systems They tenta-
tively concluded that the derived total extinction in lenses
accounts for the small dierences in limits on  found
from lensing studies of radio selected vs optically-selected
sources
Another interesting statistic that is the focus of this
paper was suggested by Kochanek 1992 and is based on
the redshift of the lensing galaxy in known lens systems
Fukugita Futamase  Kasai 1990 already showed that the
expected mean redshift of the deector increases if  dom-
inates over m due to the large volume at high redshifts
Kochanek 1992 obtained a formula for the probability dis-
tribution of the lens-galaxy redshift given a source eg
quasar redshift and the critical radius for lensing The crit-
ical radius for lensing was calculated assuming galaxy lenses
can be represented by singular isothermal spheres SIS that
are isolated ie the lensing is not aected by masses other
than the lens galaxy The Kochanek method is applied by
comparing for each model cosmology the redshift of the
known lens zl with the redshift probability distribution of
the lens galaxy given the image separation and the source
redshift zs Using a sample of four lenses Kochanek 1992
found that the then-standard cosmologies without a cos-
mological constant are 5-10 times more probable than a
at cosmology with   09 Since the image separation is
taken into account as a prior this method is not aected by
a bias resulting from the fact that larger separation lenses
are more easily discovered This advantage allows in prin-
ciple to use almost all the known lenses regardless of their
method of discovery In 3 we will discuss some exceptions
Kochanek 1992 raised several questions and problems
regarding his method i How to deal with objects in which
it is dicult to detect the lens directly - should one trust
a tentative lens redshift based on absorption lines ii Is
an unevolving galaxy mass distribution justied iii The
lens system should not be selected based on the lens-galaxy
redshift For example Q22370305 was discovered based on
the quasar emission lines present in the spectra of a nearby
galaxy More examples of such objects which may be found
in the 2dF survey and the SDSS eg Mortlock  Webster
2001 are naturally biased toward lens galaxies at low red-
shift iv The method requires lenses produced by isolated
galaxies Otherwise the image separations do not necessar-
ily represent the lens mass and indeed Kochanek removed
from his sample objects that are inuenced by clusters eg
Q0957561
The redshift distribution test was re-examined by Hel-
big  Kayser 1996 who compared the redshifts of six
lensing galaxies with the probabilities predicted by dierent
cosmological models They assumed that there is no galaxy
evolution and that lens galaxies could not be detected be-
yond a certain magnitude mlim For each tested cosmological
model they truncated the redshift probability distribution
beyond the redshift at which the lens galaxy would become
too faint to have its redshift measured They concluded that
the method is not sensitive to cosmological parameters and
in the foreseeable future it would probably not deliver inter-
esting constraints Kochanek 1996 argued however that
the insensitivity found by Helbig  Kayser 1996 was an ar-
tifact of their statistics due to the fact that they accounted
only for lenses with known redshifts while the fraction of
the lenses with unmeasurable redshifts was neglected The
fraction of lens systems with measured redshifts is smaller
in a -dominated Universe This is due to the higher lens
redshifts for a given source redshift combined with a much
larger luminosity distance to a given redshift In order to ac-
count for the selection eect introduced by the detectability
of the lens galaxy Kochanek 1996 took into account also
lens systems for which the lens redshift was not measured
Using a total of eight systems for four of which the lens
redshift was available he obtained for a at Universe an
upper limit of   09 at the 95 CL
Evolution of galaxy mass and number can complicate
or bias an analysis of the lens redshift distribution For ex-
ample a scarcity of lenses at higher redshifts may be due to
evolution rather than to the smaller volume of a low  cos-
mology In fact there are observational indications for evo-
lution in the galaxy luminosity function eg Cohen 2002
and in the mass-to-light ratio eg Keeton Kochanek 
Falco 1998 van Dokkum et al 2001 Evolution of the lens
luminosity function and K-corrections will also aect the
value of mlim Cohen 2002 studied the galaxy evolution in
the HDF-North region and concluded that while the uncer-
tainties are large there is no sign of any substantial increase
in the total mass in stars between z  105 and z  025
Keeton 2002 has recently argued that lensing statis-
tics predictions should be calibrated by counts of distant
galaxies at z  05  1 with properties similar to those of
real lenses and not by the local density of galaxies Since
distant-galaxy number counts depend themselves on cosmo-
logical volume when one calibrates the lensing statistics by
the number counts of distant galaxies lensing statistics lose
most of their sensitivity to cosmology While in principle
this is true relating the observed light from high redshift
galaxies and the light evolution to mass is not trivial The
advantage of lensing is that it probes mass distribution di-
rectly Therefore it is still a valid approach to compare the
observed lensing statistics to the predictions of locally cali-
brated models of lensing populations and to incorporate the
mass and density evolution into the models The mass evo-
lution indicated by the lensing data can then be compared
to the luminosity evolution implied by number counts to
gain insight both on cosmology and on the relation between
mass and light
The purpose of this paper is to revisit the question of
the lens redshift distribution its dependence on cosmology
and on the evolution of the lens population for the larger
sample of lensed quasars now available In 2 we rederive
Kochaneks formalism for the expected lens redshift distri-
bution but allow for number and mass evolution of the lens
population We also investigate the properties of the lens
redshift distribution and its sensitivity to dierent param-
eters In order to dene an unbiased sample in 3 we con-
duct a literature survey for known gravitational lens system
and list them in an Appendix with their basic parameters

2 CALCULATION OF THE LENS REDSHIFT
DISTRIBUTION
21 Formalism
The dierential optical depth to lensing per unit redshift is
 n z1  z3S
where n z is the comoving number density of lenses that
have critical angular radius for lensing  at redshift z S
is the cross section for lensing and cdtdz is the proper
distance interval
We assume that the lens galaxies can be represented by
a SIS potential The SIS assumption is consistent with lens
data galaxy dynamics and the X-ray emission from ellip-
ticals eg Fabbiano 1989 Rix et al 1997 Treu  Koop-
mans 2002 Moreover it is known that ellipticity in the lens
galaxy mainly aects the relative numbers of two- and four-
image lenses but not their overall measures eg Keeton
Kochanek  Seljak 1997 The critical radius Einstein ra-
dius and cross section for lensing in a SIS potential are
given by
  4cid16 
ccid172 Dls
S  2D2
where Dl Ds and Dls are the angular diameter distances
between observer-lens observer-source and lens-source re-
spectively eg Fukugita et al 1992 Note that in the SIS
model the separation between lensed images is always 2
Unless mentioned otherwise we use lled-beam angular-
diameter distances throughout this paper as opposed to
empty-beam Dyer  Roeder 1972 1973 fE is a free
parameter that represents the relation between dark halos
and their stellar component as explained below
The velocity dispersion DM of the mass distribution
and the observed stellar velocity dispersion  need not be
the same Turner Ostriker  Gott 1984 argued that if el-
liptical galaxies have dark massive halos with more extended
distributions than those of the visible stars this dark mate-
rial must necessarily have a greater velocity dispersion than
the visible stars and a factor of 3212 is required to give
an r2 density distribution cf Gott 1977 Kochanek 1992
adopted a parameter fE that relates the dark-matter veloc-
ity dispersion DM and the stellar velocity dispersion 
DM  fE
Dynamical models by Franx 1993 and Kochanek 1993
1994 demonstrated that the assumptions leading to the
3212 factor were incorrect However White  Davis
1996 argued based on X-ray observations that there is a
strong indication that dark matter halos are dynamically
hotter than the luminous stars In our work we have kept
fE as a free parameter since it mimics the eects of i
systematic errors in the velocity-dispersion measurements
of galaxies ii large scale structures that change the typ-
ical separation between images eg Martel Premadi 
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Matzner 2002 see 3 below - an increase of an arbitrary or-
der F in the velocity dispersion is equivalent to an increase
of F 2 in the typical separation  ie   2 iii softened
isothermal sphere potentials which tend to decrease the typ-
ical image separations eg Narayan  Bartelmann 1996
and could be represented by fE somewhat smaller than 1
Kochanek 1996 already noted that small core radii will
lead to only slight modications of the tail of the lens red-
shift probability distribution Moreover there is no evidence
for cores in lensing galaxies eg Rusin  Ma 2001
Martel et al 2002 compared the distribution of image
separations obtained from ray-tracing simulations in CDM
models Premadi et al 2001 with analytical calculations
They found that the presence of the background matter
tends to increase the image separations produced by lens-
ing galaxies However they found this eect to be small of
order of 20 or less and independent of the cosmological pa-
rameters see also Bernstein  Fischer 1999 Bromley et al
1998 see also Christlein 2000 Zabludo  Mulchaey 1998
showed that the luminosity function of early type galaxies
depends on environment and that richer environments tend
to have a higher ratio of dwarf to giant galaxies than the
eld Keeton Christlein  Zabludo 2000 showed that
this eect nearly but not entirely cancels the eect of the
background matter making the distribution of image sep-
arations essentially independent of environment They pre-
dicted that lenses in groups have a mean image separation
that is  02 smaller than that of lenses in the eld It is
possible that all these factors can aect the images separa-
tion by up to 20 This can be mimicked by introducing
0812  fE  1212
In order to derive the lens redshift probability we
need the velocity-dispersion distribution function of galax-
ies Such a function is not yet available directly although it
is expected that the SDSS and 2dF surveys combined with
a good understanding of aperture eects will produce one
soon Instead we start with the Schechter 1976 function

Lzcid19 dL
Lz
which provides a good description of the galaxy luminosity
distribution Using the SDSS data Blanton et al 2001 nd
that this function ts the number density of SDSS galaxies
better than an alternative non-parametric model In order
to relate the luminosity to velocity dispersion we use the
Faber-Jackson relation Faber  Jackson 1976 Kormendy

In our rederivation of the lens redshift probability we
allow for evolution in n L and  with the following
parametrization
nz  n10P z
Lz  L10Qz
z  10U z
where P  Q and U are constants U represent an evolution
in the characteristic  of a Schechter-like mass function
Note that the denitions of P and Q are somewhat dierent
than the ones used by Lin et al 1999 The denition of Q
is the same as the one used by Cohen 2002 Throughout
the paper we use n L  and  to refer to the values at
zero redshift as opposed to nz Lz z and z
Our parametrization is consistent with hierarchical galaxy
merging Mergers change only the position of the galaxies
on the Faber-Jackson relation but not the basic shape of
the relation The scatter in the Faber-Jackson relation eg
Kormendy  Djorgovski 1989 Bernardi et al 2001 can be
taken into account using a Monte-Carlo simulation as we
discuss in 23
Combining Equations 7 and 5 to obtain n z and
inserting n z along with the evolution parametrization
Eq 9 10 and 11 into Eq 1 we obtain the optical depth

22 Choices for the Lens Parameters
Throughout this paper we adopt the Schechter function pa-
rameters for the bJ -band found by Madgwick et al 2002
from a sample of 75 000 galaxies in the 2dF survey with
median redshift of z  01 see also Blanton et al 2001 for
a similar result based on a smaller sample using the SDSS
We assume   054  001 for early-type galaxies ellipti-
cals and S0 and   116001 as the average of late-type
galaxies weighted by their abundance The relative abun-
dance of early-type to late-type galaxies is adopted from the
local density as obtained by Madgwick et al 2002 while
the relative abundance of ellipticals E to S0 is obtained
from Postman  Geller 1984 ES03961 We thus adopt
n  146  102 061  102 039  102 h3 Mpc3 for
spirals S0s and ellipticals respectively The typical uncer-
tainties in these number are of order 5 Note that these
values are dierent from those used by Kochanek 1992
1996 We do not incorporate evolution in  as the red-
shift distribution test is not very sensitive to  see 23

that given by Efstathiou et al 1988 agree well after apply-

23 What Can Be Tested by the Lens Redshift
Distribution
In this section we investigate the generally complicated
behavior of d dz zs Equation 12 as a function of the
parameters involved in the problem We also study the ef-
fect of the scatter in the Faber-Jackson relation on the lens
redshift distribution
Kochanek 1992 noted that the lens redshift distribu-
tion cuts o more sharply at high redshift than the total
optical depth d dz ie Eq 12 integrated over all s be-
cause the critical radius constraint introduces an exponen-
tial term from the Schechter function beyond the redshift
at which an L galaxy is required to produce the observed
separation The sharp cuto makes d dz zs a powerful
tool For example the existence of relatively high redshift
lenses even in a small sample can reject models in which
such redshifts are beyond the cuto in the lens-redshift dis-
tribution
Figure 1 shows the lens redshift probability distribu-
tion for several dierent values of a given parameter while
keeping the rest of the parameters xed Unless otherwise
noted we use the morphological mix of galaxies with the
default parameters described in 22 along with zs  2 and
2  1 Since it is not practical to scan all the parameter
space shown in Figure 1 this gure can help us to isolate
the parameters that have the most profound eect on the
lens redshift distribution
Evolution Parameters U and P As seen in Fig 1-g
the parameter U  which describes the evolution of the char-
acteristic galaxy velocity dispersion has a considerable ef-

fect Assuming P  0 negative U decreases the most prob-
able redshift of the lens z distribution and makes the distri-
bution narrower This suggests that redshift evolution can
impact the results considerably and can therefore be con-
strained by the data The eect of the number density evo-
lution parameter P see Fig 1-h is somewhat smaller and
mainly changes the most probable redshift as opposed to U
that aects also the cut-o redshift at which the lens-redshift
probability goes to zero
Cosmology From Figure 1-d it appears that the lens
redshift distribution test in a at Universe is sensitive to 
mainly when   08
Morphological type It is well known eg Maoz 
Rix 1993 that almost all the contribution to lensing opti-
cal depth comes from early-type galaxies Since the lensing
galaxy type is not well constrained in the analysis we will
take it to be a mix of all the galaxy types  As seen in Fig-
 Although several lens galaxies are clearly disk systems eg
B1600434 even in those cases it is not clear whether they are
S0s or later types
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
ure 1-e as long as early-type galaxies dominate the lensing
galaxy population there will be no dramatic eect on the
nal results
fE As discussed in 2 the fE parameter Figure 1-
c can mimic the uncertainties in the relation between im-
age separation and mass or a systematic error in  Al-
though the eect of complex environments on the image
separation is not clear enough it seems that in most cases
it cannot change the image separation by more than 20
see discussion in 1 Therefore for reasonable values of
0812  fE  1212 fE can somewhat aect the results
of this work but not as considerably as the mass evolution
or a large cosmological constant However a systematic er-
ror of more than about 10 in  can have some eect on
the lens redshift distribution
Angular diameter distance We have tested the ef-
fect of the angular diameter distance formulae lled-beam
and empty-beam approximations on the lens redshift distri-
bution not shown in Fig 1 Using empty-beam approxima-
tion somewhat decreases the typical lens redshift relative to
the lled-beam approximation but again the eect is con-

eters but for the mean of 10 000 Monte-Carlo realizations with

tively
siderably smaller than that of mass evolution or of a large
cosmological constant
 Even a 10 change in  does not cause signicant
variations in the lens redshift distribution Note that the
eect of  in Figure 1-i is tested only for U  0 and its
eect on the exponential term of Eq 12 is therefore limited

fect of changing  Setting  to a completely dierent value
eg   11 Efstathiou et al 1988 somewhat shifts the
peak of the lens-redshift probability distribution
An important issue that needs to be considered is the
scatter in the Faber-Jackson relation which could alter the
results The observed scatter in the Faber-Jackson relation
is about 40 in a ln-normal distribution Bernardi et al
2001 To study the eect of such scatter we have per-
formed Monte-Carlo simulations In each realization we per-
turbed  by multiplying it by a factor randomly selected
from a ln-normal distribution with a given standard devi-
ation We performed two sets of Monte-Carlo simulations
with standard deviation of 20 and 40 For each set we
calculated the lens-redshift probability averaged over the
realizations as a function of redshift Figure 2 shows the
mean eect of the scatter in the Faber-Jackson relation on
the lens-redshift probability distribution The solid line is
the unscattered lens-redshift probability distribution as a
function of redshift for the default parameters The dashed-
dotted line is the same but when 20 scatter is introduced
to  and the dashed line is for a 40 scatter It is clear
that the Faber-Jackson scatter makes the distribution some-
what broader However it does not change the distribution
signicantly Note that using the lens redshift distribution
function based on a velocity dispersion distribution function
would overcome this problem
Given the most probable values of the parameters the
mass evolution U has the most important eect on the lens-
redshift distribution This is not surprising since U appears
in the exponential term of Equation 12 Next in importance
are the cosmological constant the number density evolution
P  and fE In what follows we therefore investigate the
parameters found to be important to this problem namely
U  P  fE and 
3 SAMPLE SELECTION
Using the lens redshift distribution of known lenses to con-
strain cosmological parameters and galaxy evolution re-
quires a sample free of selection eects and biases In Ta-
ble A1 we have compiled a list of 71 galaxy lens systems
we are aware of July 2002 with their basic properties
The main source for this list is the CASTLES database
Munoz et al 1999 that at the time of writing included
65 systems We have added six additional systems discov-
ered recently FIRST J1004249122922 Lacy et al 2002
HS08102554 Reimers et al 2002 PMNJ0134-0931 Winn
2002b FIRST J08165003 Lehar et al 2001 HE0435-
1223 Wisotzki et al 2002 PSS23221944 Carilli et al
There are several lens-system candidates that although
listed in the CASTLES database are of uncertain nature
usually due to dierences in the spectra of the supposed
lensed images or the non-detection of a lensing galaxy Re-
jection of these candidates based on the absence of a lens-
ing galaxy is problematic For example a lensing galaxy
in a real lens system may be undetected because it is dis-
tant and hence faint Systematically rejecting such systems
would bias the sample against detecting the eect of a cos-
mological constant We therefore reject lens candidates only
if their image spectra show pronounced dierences Based
on this criterion Q0252-3249 Morgan et al 2000 is prob-
ably not a real lens In any event this object has zs  224
and we will see below that even if it were a real lens system
it would not enter our sample
As mentioned above some lens systems have been dis-
covered based on the properties of the lens galaxy thus pre-
ferring low-redshift lenses On the other hand it is di-
cult to detect lensed quasars for which the lens galaxy is
nearby based on quasar selection After removing from our

These lenses were selected based on their morphology eg
the detection of a possible lensing galaxy and therefore
could introduce a bias Rejecting all these lens systems does
not introduces any bias since we are eectively ignoring
entire surveys Furthermore only two of these systems have
complete redshift information and as we will see below their
source redshift is too high to be included in our sample In
Column 10 of Table A1 these objects are marked L
There are several
lens candidates listed as binary
quasars in the CASTLES database whose nature is not
clear eg Q1634267 Peng et al 1999 Q2345007 Small
Sargent  Steidel 1997 Green et al 2002 Even if these sys-
tems are real lenses we reject them from our sample since
their separation is too large for galaxy lensing and they
could be aected by cluster-mass objects
Kochanek 1996 accounted for systems with missing
redshifts by considering the probability that one cannot de-
tect the lens galaxy given the limiting magnitude to which
a system has been probed However the lens galaxy bright-
ness depends on galaxy luminosity evolution and this could
complicate the analysis In order to avoid this problem we
have dened a sample that is source-redshift limited We
have selected all systems with zs  21 and image sepa-
rations smaller than 4 Sample I This zs selection crite-
rion has several advantages i Even for a de-Sitter Universe
  1 the most probable redshift is  12 and therefore
we can probe the evolution factors within a similar redshift
range to that studied by optical surveys eg Cohen 2002
ii For zs  21 we can expect that the redshifts for most of
the lenses have been measured since they are not too high
However selecting a limit as we have that is based on the
largest zs for which zl is measured for most systems is some-
what biased For example in a -dominated Universe the
typical zl will be higher and therefore the maximum zs for
which the sample is complete will be lower To check for
the robustness of the nal results we have dened a second
sample Sample II for which the maximum zs is 17
The lens redshift information in the samples is not
complete There are three lens systems for which the lens
redshift is not available yet These are J0158-4325 Mor-
gan et al 1999 HE0435-1223 Wisotzki et al 2002 and
HS08102554 Reimers et al 2002 All three systems were
discovered recently and spectral observations have not been
attempted However the lens galaxies are detectable and are
actually quite bright R  194 i  181 and I  19 re-
spectively relative to other lens galaxies Therefore drop-
ping these systems from our sample will not introduce a bias
For all but one of the lensing galaxies in samples I and II
the lens redshift has been measured spectroscopically The
exception is FBQ09512635 for which we have used the
BV RI photometry of Schechter et al 1998 corrected for
Galactic extinction Schlegel Finkbeiner  Davis 1998 to
calculate a photometric redshift by 2 minimization relative
to galaxy spectral templates from Kinney et al 1996 We
nd a photometric redshift of 023 024 and 028 for Sb
S0 and E0 galaxy types respectively Kochanek et al 2000
showed that early-type eld galaxies with 0  z  1 as rep-
resented by lens galaxies in lensed quasar systems lie on
the same fundamental plane as those in rich clusters at sim-
ilar redshifts They used this to estimate the fundamental-
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
plane redshift of lens galaxies by matching the lens galaxy
eective radius magnitude and velocity dispersion to the
fundamental plane of rich clusters The Kochanek et al
2000 fundamental-plane redshift for FBQ09512635 al-
though somewhat dependent on cosmology through the lu-
minosity distance is consistent zl  021  003 with our
photometric redshift Based on these estimates we have
adopted zl  025 for FBQ09512635 In 4 we check for
the robustness of this assumption by changing the redshift
of this object by 005 The lens system B2045265 was ex-
cluded from all the samples since its source redshift is most
likely in error see Fassnacht et al 1999
The image separation criterion of 4 was introduced in
order to remove lenses that are inuenced by complex en-
vironments eg clusters The separation is used as prior
information in calculating the lens redshift probability for
each system Therefore even if we reject a lens that has a
large separation only because its lens redshift is very low
relative to the source redshift this selection will not bias
the experiment On this basis we have removed Q0957561
and RXJ09214529 from Samples I and II To test for the
robustness of this cut we have dened Sample III in which
we have used sample I plus these two  6 separation lenses
Samples I II and III contain 15 11 and 17 sources respec-
tively
For six lenses in sample I for which an elliptical isother-
mal sphere plus shear model is available in the CASTLES
database the critical radius  from the model is about half
the observed image separation or half the maximum sep-
aration in quadruple systems to 10 accuracy or better
Therefore we adopt half the image separation as represent-
ing the critical radius in all systems
4 ANALYSIS
Figure 3 shows the lens redshift probability distribution as
calculated using Equation 12 with the default parameters
for each of the lenses in samples I II and III In each panel
the name of the lens along with its source redshift zs lens
redshift zl and image separation 2 in arcseconds are
listed The actual lens redshift is marked by an arrow on
the bottom axis
Our statistical analysis is based on the maximum like-
lihood technique For each lens system i given the model
described by Equation 12 we calculate the probability
density Pizlzs  X which is normalized to one where
X are the model parameters eg  U  and zs and  are
priors The log likelihood ln L as a function of X is given
ln L  Xi
Testing one parameter at a time ie Xj  the condence
interval CI within a given condence limit CL is the
region found below the peak of the log likelihood by 05
20 and 33174 for 68 95 and 99 CLs respectively
eg Press et al 1992
Figure 4 shows ln L for the full sample I The dotted
horizontal lines are the 68 95 and 99 CLs from top
to bottom respectively From this gure we see that the
most likely cosmological model assuming no evolution is

The maximum-likelihood technique is not free of bias
ie the most likely value could be biased eg Efron 1982
Shao  Tu 1995 To test the results for bias and possible
outliers we use the Quenouille-Tukey jackknife technique
eg Efron 1982 Efron  Tibshirani 1993 For a sample
of N observations we remove one observation ie one
system at a time and calculate ln L as a function of 
for the N  1 remaining observations The jackknife esti-
mate for the bias B in the parameter  ie  is given
by B  N  1 i   Where  is estimated using N
observations and i is the same but using N  1 observa-
tions at a time where i is the index of observation dropped
This bias should be subtracted from  to obtain the cor-
rected  We nd a bias of about   02 Taking into
account the bias the most probable   06 is well within
the 1 error and therefore we will ignore the bias
Sample II favors a somewhat larger   060027
060
The higher  favored by sample II may be due to the zs
cut we introduced see 3 However the  values from the
two samples are consistent within the uncertainty indicated
by the likelihood ratios Sample III favors an even higher
cosmological constant   077013
022 1 errors This re-
sult is not surprising since cluster-aected lenses which have
large separation will tend to have lenses at redshifts higher
than expected assuming low  and ignoring the eect of
the cluster This will increase the derived value of the cos-
mological constant
As noted in 3 the redshift of the FBQ09512635 lens
is based on a photometric redshift In order to test for the
robustness of this datum we have recalculated ln L when
perturbing the lens redshift within the plausible range of
redshifts zl  025  005 see 3 and have found that it
has little eect

information about the best t parameters of the model

The lens redshift distribution test like other cosmological

Figure 7 Likelihood contours in the U -fE plane The solid
curves are the 1 2 and 99 CL lines for sample I where
the plus sign mark the position of maximum likelihood
correct Based on the analysis we have conducted in 23 we
would say that our most troubling assumption is that im-
age separation truly represents the galaxy mass Large scale
structure can inuence the image separation and therefore
we are probing some complex combination of galaxy mass
and intervening structures and not the mass of the galaxy on
its own This is important as we use the mass function of
galaxies to derive the lens redshift distribution Our current
knowledge suggests that in most cases the image separation
is not aected by more than 20 see 21 by large scale
structure
Extinction can inuence somewhat the number statis-
tics of lenses by lowering the observed number of optically
selected lenses Falco et al 1999 found a mean value of
EBV  005 for lensed galaxies The lens redshift distri-
bution test is not inuenced by dust due to the fact that
known lens systems are used and their image separations are
taken as priors However for calculating the lens-redshift
probability we are using the observed mix of galaxy mor-
phological types Since spirals are more dusty there could be
a selection-induced lower fraction of spiral lenses relative to
elliptical lenses and this eect would lower the -evolution
parameter U  or  deduced by the lens redshift distribu-
tion method However the lens population is dominated by
early-type galaxies by virtue of their larger mass As shown
in Figure 1 lowering the fraction of spiral lenses will not
aect the predictions dramatically
We showed that the lens redshift distribution test is
sensitive to high values of the cosmological constant eg
  08 Using the lens redshift distribution and assum-
ing no evolution U  0 P  0 and a at Universe the
current sample puts an upper limit of   089 at the 95
CL and   095 at the 99 CL This is similar to the up-
per limit obtained by Kochanek 1996 for a much smaller
sample using the same method Indeed we nd that the
observations are consistent with the concordance value of
  07 Note however that this method with the current
sample is still not a sensitive probe of  for   08 our
results are equally consistent with   0
We have shown that the lens redshift distribution is a
sensitive probe of the velocity-dispersion evolution of early-
type galaxies This arises from the exponential dependence
on the velocity-dispersion evolution parameter U in Equa-
tion 12 Assuming m  03   07 and no prior knowl-
edge of U or P  then the best t values are P  0714
and U  010  006 Our results apply to the redshift
range  01 to  09 The lower limit is set by the median
redshift of galaxies used to obtain the 2dF luminosity func-
tion Madgwick et al 2002 and the Faber-Jackson relation
Bernardi et al 2001 The upper limit is set by the highest
redshift lens in sample I z  093 Our results are con-
sistent with no evolution Positive U mass increases with
redshift can probably be excluded as physically improb-
able Our measurements are then useful for setting a lower
limit on this mass evolution parameter Negative U would
mean that the typical characteristic velocity dispersion in
a Schechter-like function  was lower in the past Such
evolution is expected in the hierarchical galaxy merging sce-
nario as the typical galaxy was less massive in the past
Our results imply that at 95 CL  of early-type galaxies
at z  1 was at least 63 of its current value As we have
shown the lens redshift distribution does not strongly con-
strain the number-density evolution P  If we take as a prior
P  026 as obtained by Im et al 2002 and supported
by Schade et al 1999 from counts of early-type galaxies to
z  1 we see from Figure 5 that U  004005010013
004007009 
where the errors are the 1 2 and 99 CL errors respec-
tively This places a more severe limit on the allowed evolu-
tion in  at 95 CL  at z  1 was at least 77 of its
current value
Most studies of galaxy evolution attempt to constrain
the evolution of the light or of the mass-to-light ratio de-
ned by MLz  ML010T z rather than the mass
evolution The luminosity evolution number evolution and
mass-to-light ratio evolution have been studied in various
works that produced several estimates for the evolution pa-
rameters P  Q and T  For example Cohen 2002 studied
the luminosity function of galaxies in the HDF-North region
in the redshift range 0 to 15 She found that galaxies with
strong absorption lines become brighter with z Q  06 in
all bands while galaxies with detectable emission lines show
a smaller change in L with Q  03 She also found that
the comoving number density and stellar mass in galaxies is
approximately constant out to z  1 and with more uncer-
tainty to z  13 Keeton Kochanek  Falco 1998 com-
bined the photometry and lens modeling of 17 lens galaxies
in the redshift range 01 to  1 They found that the lens
galaxy B-band mass-to-light ratio decreases with redshift
with T  05  01 for m  01 In Table 2 we list
these and several other evolutionary studies of early-type
galaxies and their best t parameters The similar values
of T and Q found by most studies around 06 suggest
considerable luminosity evolution with little mass evolution
consistent with our ndings Note that the evolution param-
eters listed in Table 2 are determined for early-type galaxies
in dierent environments eld and clusters Interestingly
the evolution parameters are similar
In a recent paper Davis Huterer  Krauss 2002 use
the CLASS and Jodrell-Very Large Array Astrometric Sur-
vey lensing statistics to constrain the characteristic velocity
dispersion of elliptical galaxies This is done using the joint

tion of lensing galaxies and the angular-separation distri-
bution of lensed images Their analysis gives 138 km s1

distribution analysis include only the six out of 12 lenses
in their sample for which redshift information is available

have higher masses Therefore failing to take into account
the missing redshifts will bias  toward lower values Fur-
thermore the canonical value of  eg 225 km s1 for

work However we can see from Figure 7 that a  that is

persion as found by Chae et al 2002   19853
37 km s1
for ellipticals Note that Chae et al 2002 use   10 as
opposed to   054
Thus a constant value of   200 km s1 or a mildly
evolving value that has approximately this average would
explain most of the current lensing statistics data in an  
07 cosmology Since lensing cross section is proportional to
4 such a value of  may lower the lensing cross section
in lens surveys by a large enough amount to explain the
small number of observed lensed systems despite the large
volume associated with a cosmological constant At the same
time our results show that such  is still large enough to
reproduce the observed redshift distribution of known lenses
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
We have compared the observed and predicted redshift dis-
tributions of lensing galaxies Expanding upon the work of
Kochanek 1992 1996 we have used a much enlarged obser-
vational sample and incorporated possible mass and number
density evolution of lens galaxies The lens-redshift distribu-
tion in a at Universe is sensitive to the large volume out
to a given redshift in the presence of a large cosmological
constant ie   08 and especially to evolution of the
characteristic velocity dispersion of the lensing population
The sensitivity of this test to velocity-dispersion evolution is
unique as it probes the total mass of stars and dark matter
within  10 kpc without any assumptions on a possible bias
factor between mass to light We have explored the robust-
ness of our inferences to various types of deviations from our
basic assumptions such as errors in the luminosity-function
parameters the lens model and the scatter in the Faber-
Jackson relation Unless there are gross errors in our knowl-
edge of these parameters they have a small eect on our
results
There are now 71 lenses known in the literature and we
have compiled their basic properties Appendix A From
these we have selected a sample of 15 lenses with separa-
tions smaller than 4 and source redshift zs  21 along
with two other test samples Assuming no mass evolution
0  z  1 of early-type galaxies we can put an upper
limit of   089 at the 95 CL On the other hand as-
suming an m  03   07 cosmology we nd that the
best t characteristic velocity dispersion  and number
evolution of early-type galaxies in the range z  0 to 1
are d log10 zdz  010  006 and d log10 nzdz 
0714

the early-type galaxy population and limit the allowed in-
crease of the characteristic  between z  1 and the
present Finally we have considered the inuence of chang-
ing the estimate of the present-day value of  We nd that
a velocity dispersion that is  80 of the standard value of

early-types with no evolution out to z  1 is consistent
with our data Such a value of  could possibly also re-
solve the discrepancy between the results of previous lensing

c - Associated with a small group and possibly a second group at z  052 Tonry  Kochanek 1999
d - Two late-type lensing galaxies Koopmans et al 1999
e - Redshift is based on the Kochanek et al 2000 method in which one requires that the galaxy properties be consistent with the passively
evolving fundamental plane of early-type galaxies Winn et al 2002a
f - Evidence for a foreground group of galaxies at z  034 Tonry  Kochanek 2000
g - Redshift is based on the Kochanek et al 2000 fundamental-plane method plus the possible identication of OIII in emission Winn et
al 2002b
h - The most probable redshift is of an Mg II absorber at z  11349 Siemiginowska et al 1998
i - Complex lens probably by two galaxies at z  03157 and z  05883 Augusto et al 2001
j - Massive cluster at z  0769 with   840 km s1 Kneib Cohen  Hjorth 2000
k - Spectral observations reveal a rich metal-line absorption system consisting of a strong Mg II doublet and associated Fe I and Fe II absorption
features all at an intervening redshift of z  0684 suggestive of a lensing galaxy Morgan et al 2001
l - By cross correlating the spectrum with galaxy templates Burud et al 2002a obtain a tentative redshift estimate of z  050 in agreement
with the fundamental-plane method estimate Kochanek et al 2000
m - Possibly a member of an X-ray cluster z  032 centered on the eld Munoz et al 2001
n - Based on photometric redshift this paper The fundamental-plane method Kochanek et al 2000 gives zl  021  003
o - zl  041  005 is based on Kochanek et al 2000 fundamental-plane method
p - Based on lensing galaxy colors z  04  01 Wisotzki et al 2002
q - Cluster at z  036 eg Chae 1999
r - Based on the probable identication of the lens galaxy 4000Abreak in the quasar spectra Lacy et al 2002
s - Based on the fundamental-plane method Kochanek et al 2000 z  088  007
t - Absorption lines at z  2344 and MgII absorption at z  1085 Surdej et al 1997 Kochanek et al 2000 based on the fundamental-plane
method give z  078  007 Therefore we have adopted z  1085
u - Marlow et al 1999 argue that the lens galaxy is sub-L so it has z  05 or is highly reddened
v - Lensing by a compact group of three z  1 galaxies Rusin et al 2001b
w - Possible cluster at z  17 Kneib et al 1998
x - Keeton  Kochanek 1997 nd that the lens time-delay cannot be t by an isolated lens galaxy but that it can be well tted by including
a perturbation from the nearby group of galaxies Tonry 1998 measures the group velocity dispersion of 330 km s1
y - Eisenhardt et al 1996 estimate the lens-galaxy redshift as z  09  03 Goodrich et al 1996 nd strong evidence for MgII absorption
at z  1316 in the spectrum of the QSO and weaker evidence for a possible continuum and absorption system at z  0893 Lacy Rawlings
