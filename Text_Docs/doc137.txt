Abstract The determination of chemical abundances in star-forming galaxies and the study
of their evolution on cosmological timescales are powerful tools for understanding galaxy for-
mation and evolution This contribution presents the latest results in this domain We show
that detailed studies of chemical abundances in UVselected Hii and starburst nucleus galaxies
together with the development of new chemical evolution models put strong constraints on the
evolutionary stage of these objects in terms of star formation history Finally we summarize
our current knowledge on the chemical properties of intermediate and highredshift galaxies
Although the samples are still too small for statistical studies these results give insight into the
nature and evolution of distant starforming objects and their link with presentday galaxies
1 Introduction
Tracing the star formation history of galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy formation and
evolution The chemical properties of galaxies are closely related to their star formation history and
can be considered as fossil records enabling us to track the galaxy formation history down to the
present
There is a lot of observational evidence suggesting that the star formation history of galaxies has
not been monotonic with time but exhibits instead signicant uctuations Galaxies in the Local
Group are excellent examples showing a variety of star formation histories Further evidence for the
multiple-burst scenario was recently found in massive Starburst Nucleus Galaxies SNBGs eg
6 16 Even the small-mass and less evolved Hii galaxies seem to be formed of age-composite stellar
populations indicating successive bursts of star formation eg 20
11 recently explored numerical models of galaxy evolution in which star formation occurs in two
modes a low-eciency continuous mode and a high-eciency mode triggered by interaction with
a satellite With these assumptions the star formation history of low-mass galaxies is characterized
by intermittent bursts of star formation separated by quiescent periods lasting several Gyrs whereas
massive galaxies are perturbed on time scales of several hundred Myrs and thus have uctuating but
relatively continuous star formation histories In these models merger rates are specied using the
predictions of hierarchical galaxy formation models eg 2
Examining the chemical evolution and physical nature of star-forming galaxies over a range of
redshifts will shed light on this issue Emission lines from Hii regions have long been the primary
means of chemical diagnosis in local galaxies but this method has only recently been applied to
galaxies at cosmological distances following the advent of infrared spectrographs on 8 to 10-m class
telescopes eg 18 15 12 1 9 19 
2 The case of UV-selected galaxies
5 recently derived the chemical properties of a UV-selected sample of galaxies These objects are
found to be intermediate between low-mass metal-poor Hii galaxies and more massive metal-rich
SBNGs see 6 for the dichotomy spanning a wide range of oxygen abundances from  01 to 1 Z

LMC and the SMC are also indicated b Schematic evolution model of NO versus 12  logOH
assuming a sequence of starbursts separated by quiescent periods see also 8 6 This scenario
assumes that each burst rst produces oxygen enrichment due to massive star evolution on short
time-scales   10 Myrs followed by signicant nitrogen enrichment on longer time-scales   100
Myrs due to intermediate-mass star evolution see 5 for details
The behavior of these starburst galaxies in the NO versus OH relation see Figure 1a has been
investigated in order to probe their physical nature and star formation history see 5 for details At a
given metallicity the majority of UV-selected galaxies has low NO abundance ratios whereas SBNGs
show an excess of nitrogen abundance when compared to Hii regions in the disk of normal galaxies
see also 6 The interpretation of these behaviors is not straightforward A possible interpretation
of the location of UV-selected galaxies and SBNGs in the NO versus OH relation could be that
UV galaxies are selected at the end of a short episode of star formation following a rather long and
quiescent period 5 whereas SBNGs experienced successive starbursts over the last Gyrs to produce
the observed nitrogen abundance excess eg 6
3 Constraining the star formation history of galaxies
At a given metallicity the distribution of NO abundance ratios shows a large dispersion both at
low and high metallicity 6 5 Only part of this scatter is due to uncertainties in the abundance
determinations The additional dispersion must therefore be accounted for by galaxy evolution models
Various hypotheses localized chemical pollution IMF variations dierential mass loss etc were
suggested as responsible for such a scatter eg 14 but none of them is able to reproduce the full
NO scatter at a given metallicity
A natural explanation for the variation of NO at constant metallicity might be a signicant time
delay between the release into the ISM of oxygen by massive short-lived stars and that of nitrogen
produced in low-mass longer-lived stars see Figure 1b The delayed-release model assumes that
star formation is an intermittent process in galaxies while maintaining an universal IMF and standard
stellar nucleosynthesis 7 8
17 recently investigated this possibility in order to quantiy the star formation history of starburst
galaxies The observed dispersion in the well-known metallicity-luminosity relation has been used as an
additional constraint It was conrmed that continuous star formation models are unable to reproduce
Figure 2 Left NO versus 12  logOH for the samples of star-forming galaxies dots described
in Figure 1 Model predictions assuming bursting star formation scenario are shown The model
parameters are listed in Table 1 of 17 This gure shows the dichotomy between the models which
reproduce the scatter in the metal-poor region 12  logOH  85 and those which reproduce the
scatter in the metal-rich region 12  logOH  85 Right The metallicity-luminosity relation for
the starburst galaxy samples described in Figure 1 Hii galaxies triangles SBNGs circles and UV-
selected galaxies squares The continuous thick line is a linear t to the whole sample of starburst
galaxies and the dashed thick line is a linear t to local normal irregular and spiral galaxies 15
Model predictions assuming a bursting star formation scenario are shown The model parameters are
the same as those used in the left panel The delineated area thick green line encompasses all the
model predictions calculated with the parameters reported in Table 1 of 17 For illustration the
prediction of a specic model dotted thin line is shown
the scatter observed in both NO and MB versus OH scaling relations The dispersion associated
with the distribution of NO as a function of metallicity can indeed be explained in the framework of
bursting star formation models Figure 2 shows the oscillating behavior of the NO ratio due to the
alternating bursting and quiescent phases In this case the observed dispersion in the NO versus
OH relation is explained by the time delay between the release of oxygen by massive stars into the
ISM and that of nitrogen by intermediate-mass stars see also Figure 1b for a schematic view During
the starburst events as massive stars dominate the chemical enrichment the galaxy moves towards
the lower right part of the diagram During the interburst period when no star formation is occurring
the release of N by low and intermediate-mass stars occurs a few hundred Myrs after the end of the
burst and increases NO at constant OH The dilution of interstellar gas by the newly accreted
intergalactic gas is also observed during the quiescent phases
Extensive model computations see 17 for details show that no possible combination of the model
parameters ie burst duration interburst period star formation eciency gas accretion timescale
etc is able to account for the observed spread for the whole sample of galaxies
17 found that the
most important parameter for reproducing the observed spread is the star formation eciency Once
the star formation eciency is set the extent of the predicted spread mainly depends on the starburst
duration The models show that to account for the observed scatter of NO for the whole metallicity
range one needs to consider at least two regimes low and high metallicity characterized by dierent
star formation eciencies and starburst durations
Following these models metal-rich 12  logOH  85 spiral galaxies dier from metal-poor
ones by a higher star formation eciency and starburst frequency Moreover the t is very good
for metal-rich galaxies if the quiescent period between two successive bursts is of the same order as
the gas infall timescale This can be understood in the context of the hierarchical galaxy formation
scenario where a major burst of star formation is activated each time a galaxy undergoes a minor
merger event such as the accretion of a small satellite or primordial HI gas clouds eg 2
Figure 3 NO left and absolute B-band magnitude right as a function of metallicity for intermedi-
ate and high redshift star-forming galaxies All chemical abundance data published so far for distant
galaxies are on this plot The samples of intermediate-redshift galaxies are UV-selected galaxies
squares 5 and emission-line EL galaxies stars 15 at z  01  05 compact and luminous EL
galaxies at z  05  07 crosses 9 The location of high-redshift z  3 Lyman break galaxies
is shown as a box encompassing the range of OH and MB derived for these objects 19 On the
left panel the location of nearby Hii galaxies and SBNGs see Figure 1 for references is shown for
comparison The metallicityluminosity relation for local normal galaxies see 15 is shown as a
solid line on the right panel
Finally these models conrm previous claims 5 that UV-selected galaxies are observed at a
special stage in their evolution Their low NO abundance ratios with respect to other starburst
galaxies is well explained if they have just undergone a powerful starburst which enriched their ISM
in oxygen
4 Chemical properties of intermediate and highredshift galaxies
In Figure 3 left we compare the location of intermediate-redshift z  01  04 emission-line
EL 15 and UV-selected 5 galaxies with nearby samples of Hii and SBNGs in the NO versus
OH plane Most of these distant objects have chemical abundances typical of massive and metal-
rich SBNGs ie 12  logOH  85 Some of them show high NO abundance ratios logNO
 1 which could be due to a succession of starbursts over the last few Gyrs eg 6 None of these
intermediate-redshift galaxies are located in the region occupied by nearby metal-poor Hii galaxies
The fact that intermediate-redshift galaxies are mostly metal-rich objects is likely to be a selection
eect arising from the well-known metallicityluminosity relationship Only the most luminous and
thus metal-rich objects are detected so far with the current instrumentation on 8-m class telescopes
It is interesting to note that like a signicant fraction of UV-selected galaxies some optically-selected
EL galaxies also show strikingly low NO ratios
The location of distant galaxies in the metallicityluminosity relation is shown in Figure 3 right
Three samples of intermediate-redshift galaxies are considered EL galaxies at z  01  05 15
luminous and compact EL galaxies at z  05  07 9 and the UV-selected galaxies 5 The
location of high-redshift z  3 Lyman break galaxies LBGs is shown as a box encompassing the
range of OH and MB derived for these objects 19 Whereas EL galaxies with redshifts between
01 and 05 seem to follow the metallicityluminosity relation of normal galaxies solid line there
is a clear deviation for both UV-selected and luminous EL galaxies at higher redshift z  05  07
These galaxies thus appear 2  3 mag brighter than normal galaxies of similar metallicity as might
be expected if a strong starburst had temporarily lowered their mass-to-light ratios
9 argue that
luminous and compact EL galaxies could be the progenitors of present-day spiral bulges The deviation
is even stronger for LBGs at z  3 Even allowing for uncertainties in the determination of OH and
MB LBGs fall well below the metallicityluminosity relation of normal local galaxies and have
much lower abundances than expected from this relation given their luminosities The most obvious
interpretation 19 is that LBGs have mass-to-light ratios signicantly lower than those of present-day
normal galaxies
Although the samples are still too small to derive rm conclusions on the link between distant
objects and present-day galaxies the present results give new insight into the nature and evolution
of distant star-forming galaxies No doubt that the next large-scale spectroscopic surveys on 10-m
class telescopes eg VIRMOS on VLT COSMOSEMIR on Grantecan etc will shed light on these
fundamental issues by producing statistically signicant samples of galaxies over a large range of
redshifts
