Abstract
In the standard methodology for evaluating the Hawking radiation emanating from
a black hole the background geometry is xed Trying to be more realistic we
consider a dynamical geometry for a two-dimensional charged black hole and we
evaluate the Hawking radiation as a tunneling process This modication to the
geometry gives rise to a nonthermal part in the radiation spectrum We exlore the
consequences of this new term for the extremal case

Introduction
There has been much work on the classically forbidden quantum process called
Hawking eect 1 Most of the approaches have been developed using a xed spacetime
background during the emission process In this work we implement the idea of Keski-
Vakkuri Kraus and Wilczek 2 3 4 to the case of a two-dimensional charged black hole
stated earlier 10 The energy conservation will be the key to our description since it will
lead us to the dynamical background which according to Parikh and Wilczek 5 may lead
to a more realistic description The total ADM mass will be xed while the mass of
the two-dimensional charged black hole will decrease due to the emitted radiation The
eect of this modication in our calculation generalizes in this case our previous results
10 which are analogous with the results found in 6 7 8 for the respective geometries
a nonthermal partener greybody factor9 to the thermal spectrum of the Hawking
radiation will show up We explore the consequences to the extremal two-dimensional
black hole The extremality now will be shifted since the charge Q of the two-dimensional
charged black hole will be reached by the mass M earlier This alteration produces a
non -frozen extremal two-dimensional charged black hole characterised by a constant
temperature T extremal
Charged Black Hole
The line element of the charged two-dimensional black hole is given by in coordinates
corresponding to the Schwarzschild gauge

with 0  t   r  r   r being the future event horizon of the black hole
Following a parametrization analogous to the four-dimensional case the metric function
factorizes as

we can recognize immediately the outer event horizon H  placed at the point r  1
while the inner horizon H is at the point r  1

the two surfaces coincide in a single event horizon at the point

To deal with phenomena whose main contributions come from the horizon we must make
a coordinate tranformation in order that the new coordinates be non-singular on the
horizon We choose the Painleve coordinates 12 We introduce the time coordinate P

where the signs  and  correspond to the outgoing and ingoing geodesics respectively
under the assumption that P increases towards future Assuming that the total mass is

It is known that the emission rate from a radiating source can be expressed with respect
to the imaginary part of the action for an outgoing positive-energy particle as 
  e2ImS
but also with respect to the temperatute and the entropy of the radiating source which
in our case will be a two-dimensional charged black hole 
  e  eS black hole
where  is the inverse temperature of the black hole and S black hole is the change in
the entropy of the black hole before and after the emission of the shell of energy 
outgoing massless particle It is clear that if we evaluate the action then we will know
the temperature andor the change in the entropy of the black hole We therefore evaluate
the imaginary part of the action for an outgoing positive-energy particle which crosses
the horizon outwards from 
The imaginary part of the action will be

where the minus sign is due to the Hamiltonian being equal to the modied mass H

Apparently the emission rate will depend not only on the mass M and charge Q of the
two-dimensional charged black hole but also on the energy  of the emitted massless

We see that there are deviations from the standard results 1 10 derived for a xed
background The temperature of the two-dimensional charged black hole is no longer
the Hawking temperature These deviations form the so-called greybody-factor that
measures the departure from the pure blackbody spectrum and lead to a nonthermal
spectrum A welcomed but not unexpected result is that if we evaluate to rst order in
 temperature we get the result reached in our previous work for the two-dimensional
charged black hole 
where  is given by 
  1 
This constitutes another evidence for our arguments placed here
The extremal two-dimensional charged black hole will be created when 
M    Q
This modication indicates that the mass M of the black hole cannot be less than the
charge Q since   M  Q  0 and the temperature of the extremal two-dimensional
charged black hole will not be zero

Discussion
In this work we have viewed the Hawking radiation as a quantun tunneling process
The self-gravitation of the radiation introduced in 5 was included and this treatment
introduced a nonthermal part for the spectrum The temperature of the black hole is no
more the Hawking temperature and the greybody factor showing up declares explicitly
the emitted particles energy dependence The leading term gives the thermal Boltzmann
factor while the higher order terms represent corrections emanating from the response of
the background geometry to the emission of a quantum The extremal two-dimensional
charged black hole is no more frozen but it carries a backgound temperature T extremal
ensuring the validity of the third law of black hole thermodynamics Therefore it is obvious
that we have again one more strong evidence to believe that black holes constitute excited
states while the extremal black holes correspond to ground states
It is interesting that for the case of the two-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole
the above procedure of incorporating the eects of the emittance of a shell of energy
yields precisely the result obtained with a xed background 10 11 The reason for this
lack of greybody factor in the Schwarzschild case is the non - dependence of the
Hawking temperature on black hole mass in contradistinction to the corresponding four-
dimensional case Of course the complete treatment of the backreaction eects remains
to be explored further
