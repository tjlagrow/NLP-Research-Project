ABSTRACT
The current CDM cosmological model predicts that galaxy evolution proceeds more slowly in
lower density environments suggesting that voids are a prime location to search for relatively pristine
galaxies that are representative of the building blocks of early massive galaxies To test the assumption
that void galaxies are more pristine we compare the evolutionary properties of a sample of dwarf
galaxies selected specically to lie in voids with a sample of similar isolated dwarf galaxies in average
density environments We measure gas-phase oxygen abundances and gas fractions for eight dwarf
galaxies Mr  162 carefully selected to reside within the lowest density environments of seven
voids and apply the same calibrations to existing samples of isolated dwarf galaxies We nd no
signicant dierence between these void dwarf galaxies and the isolated dwarf galaxies suggesting
that dwarf galaxy chemical evolution proceeds independent of the large-scale environment While this
sample is too small to draw strong conclusions it suggests that external gas accretion is playing a
limited role in the chemical evolution of these systems and that this evolution is instead dominated
mainly by the internal secular processes that are linking the simultaneous growth and enrichment of
these galaxies
INTRODUCTION
Void galaxies found occupying large 20 Mpc un-
derdense void regions are an environmentally dened
population whose isolated nature and extreme environ-
ment provides an ideal opportunity to test theories of
galaxy formation and evolution see eg van de Wey-
gaert  Platen 2011 for a review They are typically
small gas-rich disk galaxies Kreckel et al 2012 that
are systematically bluer with higher rates of star forma-
tion Grogin  Geller 1999 2000 suggesting they are
less evolved than galaxies of comparable mass in higher
density environments This arises naturally from CDM
cosmology as the reduced matter density in voids results
in a longer time between mergers and thus slower evolu-
tion Goldberg  Vogeley 2004 To date some of the
lowest metallicity galaxies have been discovered within
void environments Pustilnik et al 2010 2013 but the
connection with the large-scale environment is not clear
Nicholls et al 2014b
Cosmological models of galaxy formation predict that
void galaxies should be younger and thus more metal
poor compared to eld populations of dwarf galaxies
Goldberg  Vogeley 2004 Previous work studying
galaxies in the nearby Lynx-Cancer void show system-
atically lower metallicities for a range of luminosities
Pustilnik et al 2011 with signicant 015 dex o-
set to lower metallicities for the dwarf galaxies in their
sample However the Lynx-Cancer void galaxy study is
restricted to a single nearby void environment and at a
distance of 18 Mpc it is more dicult to constrain the
extent of the void and reliably determine true void mem-

dances of eight H i rich dwarf galaxies in seven voids us-

understanding of the eects of the void environment on
the evolution of dwarf galaxies and provides constraints
on the gas content and metallicity for this population
that must be matched by simulations
2 SAMPLE AND DATA
We observed HII regions in eight galaxies using the
MODS1 instrument at the LBT in Spring 2014 These
galaxies were discovered serendipitously within the sur-
vey region of an H i study of void galaxies as part of
the Void Galaxy Survey VGS van de Weygaert et al
2011 Kreckel et al 2012 Beygu 2014 The eight dwarf
void galaxies reside in seven dierent voids with the void
boundaries entirely contained within the SDSS redshift
survey H imaging when available generally reveals
only a single HII region Beygu 2014
MODS1 simultaneously observes a red and blue set
up We used the G400L 400 lines mm1 R1850 and
G670L 250 lines mm1 R2300 gratings to achieve
broad spectral coverage from 3100  10000 A To mini-
mize slit-loss from atmospheric refraction we aligned the
slit to the parrallactic angle of midpoint of each observa-
tion sequence 310 minute exposures per target Seeing

rus thus we do not provide an absolute ux calibration
Relative ux calibration between the red and blue se-
tups was achieved by matching the continuum between
O iii 5007 and H The spectra were processed fol-

tinuum with models from Bruzual  Charlot 2003 us-

could not constrain the underlying Balmer absorption

H We measure emission line uxes by tting them
with Gaussians
We detect the strong O iii O ii H and H lines

et al 2012 and beam size and the MODS1 slit position VGS 30a VGS 36a and VGS 38a show signs of interaction with their nearby
neighbor in the H i morphology VGS 38b is also tenuously connected by an extended H i bridge with VGS 38a Bottom The MODS1
spectrum for VGS 38a shows our detection of the underlying continuum Strong emission lines are clearly detected as well as the faint
4363A line
Table 2 in all galaxies In four galaxies we robustly de-
tect the N ii 6584A line while in three galaxies we also
detect the faint auroral O iii 4363A line We compute
the gas-phase oxygen abundance using three strong-line
calibrations McGaugh 1991 M91 Kobulnicky  Kew-
ley 2004 KK04 and Pilyugin  Thuan 2005 PT05
While the absolute calibration of these strong-line abun-
dance indicators continues to be debated eg Kewley 
Ellison 2008 these three calibrations span the range of
absolute scales and include both empirical calibrations
and those based on photoionization models and the rel-
ative calibrations are reliable Where possible we also
calculate the electron temperature to determine an abun-
dance using direct methods though we note that these
are not deep observations and the low-signal-to-noise
limit will bias our observations towards systematically
low metallicities
ies with no neighbors within 200 kpc suggesting they
have not undergone a substantial interaction for 2 Gyr
By similar criteria we classify four void dwarf galaxies
as isolated The remaining four void dwarf galaxies have
close 40 kpc massive 108 Mcid12 companions all of
which show signs of tidal interaction in the H i maps
Figure 1
Our dwarf galaxies all have an absolute magnitude Mr
 -162 MB  -160 For comparison with the control
samples we calculate the B-band absolute magnitude
by transforming the SDSS colors This is applicable to
galaxies without strong emission lines and may result in
an overestimate in the B-band magnitude for some of our
dwarfs
We draw control samples from two studies 21 isolated
dwarf irregular galaxies from van Zee  Haynes 2006
and 13 isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxies from Nicholls
et al 2014a While the isolation criteria varies slightly
between the two samples they generally result in galax-
As both control samples are within 30 Mpc we can-
not apply the same large-scale structure identication
techniques as we have in the VGS Platen et al 2007
Aragon-Calvo et al 2010 Kreckel et al 2011b how-
ever the large-scale structure in the local universe is rel-
atively well mapped Lavaux 2010 Kitaura et al 2012
Two galaxies KK246 and HIPASS J1609-04 from the
Nicholls et al 2014a sample fall within the local void
see also Kreckel et al 2011a Nicholls et al 2014b but
the remaining galaxies from both samples do not fall
within any of the established nearby voids Tikhonov 
Karachentsev 2006 Tully et al 2008 Elyiv et al 2013
Due to the isolation criteria we classify the remainder
as eld galaxies residing in average density walls or l-
aments
For all galaxies in the control sample we use the mea-
sured line uxes to recalculate the gas-phase metallicity
in a manner consistent with our sample for the three
strong-line methods While these strong-line methods
can have large 07 dex absolute uncertainties relative
uncertainties within each assumed calibration are 01

surement uncertainties for the strong lines
We do not expect aperture biases to signicantly aect
our comparison We sample 500 pc scales equivalent
to the scales probed by Nicholls et al 2014a but larger
than the 100 pc scales sampled by van Zee  Haynes
2006 Most of the abundances calculated are based
on measurements of only one or two HII regions in each
galaxy
3 RESULTS
In all cases our VGS dwarf galaxies have abundances
consistent with the control sample with no apparent sys-
tematic oset Figure 2 This is consistent with the re-
sults of Nicholls et al 2014b for the two dwarfs within
the Local Voids also shown here
Four of the VGS dwarfs are not isolated having a com-
panion within 100 kpc in projection most with fur-
ther evidence for ongoing interaction in the extended H i
disks These four galaxies also do not show any oset
relative to the isolated galaxy samples While this sam-
ple is too small to draw strong conclusions it suggests
that external gas accretion is playing a limited role in the
chemical evolution of these systems and that this evolu-
tion is instead dominated mainly by the internal secular
processes that are linking the simultaneous growth and
enrichment of these galaxies
We note that one of the VGS dwarfs VGS 39a ex-
hibits a low metallicity for its estimated MB particularly
in the M91 and KK04 diagnostics and even with the
temperature-sensitive method However as this galaxy
also exhibits a relatively large equivalent width in the
O iii 5007A line EW5007  220A we estimate that
this line emission contributes 02 magnitudes to the mea-
sured g-band lter which extends to 5500A and in-
validates our assumption of no strong emission lines in
the conversion to B-band Using the SDSS photometry
directly see below we estimate a stellar mass of 4 
107 Mcid12 more consistent with MB  14 mag making
VGS 39a less of an outlier in these plots
In addition to the established correlation between lu-
minosity and metallicity an additional dependence on
star formation rate has also been shown Mannucci et al

2010 This is not easy to explore in this sample as the
extrapolation from H ux measured within individual
HII regions to a global star formation rate is not straight-
forward However previous Patiri et al 2006 Park et
al 2007 Kreckel et al 2012 and ongoing Beygu 2014
work studying the star formation within void galaxies
shows there is no systematic dierence compared to typ-
ical galaxies at xed stellar mass suggesting this addi-
tional parameter is unlikely to be aecting our result
Another tracer of metal enrichment in galaxies is the
ratio of nitrogen relative to oxygen At high oxygen
abundance nitrogen is produced as a secondary element
in intermediate mass stars resulting in a correlation be-
tween NO and OH However at low oxygen abundance
12logOH  85 the NO ratio is approximately
constant Lequeux et al 1979 suggesting nitrogen is
produced mainly as a primary element in massive stars
Our void dwarf galaxies all fall within this low metal-
licity regime and exhibit NO consistent with the xed
logNO  16 abundance ratio Thuan et al 1995
strengthening the conclusion that atypical chemical evo-

non-isolated dwarfs in any of the calibrations VGS 39a appears
particularly metal decient however we suspect that strong emis-
sion line contamination results in an overestimation of the B-band
magnitude
lution is not observed in these void galaxies
We examine the evolutionary state of our galaxies by
comparing with a simple closed box model for the abun-
dance evolution Edmunds 1990 which allows for no di-
lution by infalling pristine material or loss of metals by
outowing enriched material Following the assumptions
outlined in van Zee  Haynes 2006 we plot the metal-
licity as a function of gas fraction for a perfect closed box
model Figure 3 We estimate the stellar mass using the
broadband photometry available from each sample and
the conversions in Bell et al 2003 For the Nicholls
et al 2014a galaxies we use colors reported in Doyle
et al 2005 and for the VGS dwarfs we use the SDSS
photometry and colors directly The total gas mass is
based on the H i mass with a correction for neutral He-
lium Mgas  13 MHI  We assume there is no signif-
icant molecular gas component in these systems based
on the low CO intensity typically found in dwarf galaxies
Schruba et al 2012 Here we have plotted only metal-
licities measured using direct methods as taken directly
from van Zee  Haynes 2006 and Nicholls et al 2014a
to reduce the scatter compared to the model
van Zee  Haynes 2006 found that the majority of
dwarf galaxies are consistent with having an eective
yield about 25 that for a closed box system Our
void dwarf galaxies are also consistent with this result
Though we have only three void dwarf galaxies with di-
rect abundances measured we note that they exhibit
both extremes in gas fraction suggesting signicant scat-
ter in the gas dynamics in voids We also note that two
of these void dwarf galaxies are not isolated and it is in
fact one of these VGS 38a that falls furthest from the
closed box model This galaxy is very clearly interacting
with a larger nearby D  40 kpc companion Figure
4 DISCUSSION
41 Comparison with previous work
We nd no signicant oset in gas-phase metallicity for
our eight void dwarf galaxies with respect to the sam-
ple of isolated dwarf galaxies in average density envi-
ronments Figure 2 Pustilnik et al 2011 however
found a more signicant oset in their study of 48 void
galaxies in the Lynx-Cancer void They found 12 of
their void galaxies demonstrate a large oxygen deciency
12logOH  73 and the majority show a system-
atic oset to lower abundances by 015 dex We cannot
precisely explain the dierence between their result and
ours however there are a few key dierences between the
void galaxy samples that could play a role
While their galaxy sample size is signicantly larger
PT0512141618MB727476788082848612logOHM9112141618MBKK0412141618MB5
Finally as our sample is H i selected we have a bias
towards gas-rich galaxies that is not inuencing the se-
lection of Lynx-Cancer void galaxies Pustilnik  Tepli-
akova 2011 As gas-rich dwarfs have the fuel more read-
ily available to form stars and enrich the surrounding
material a gas-rich selected sample could be expected
to exhibit higher metallicity A relation connecting stel-
lar mass metallicity and H i mass has been found for
more massive M  109Mcid12 galaxies Bothwell et al
2013 though the trend is in the opposite direction - the
more H i rich galaxies at xed stellar mass have lower
metallicity
Our result is more consistent with the ndings of
Nicholls et al 2014b who also used a H i selected sam-
ple to examine two dwarf galaxies in the Local Void and
found they have typical metallicities for their luminos-
ity The abundance ratio of nitrogen to oxygen for HII
regions in their two void galaxies are consistent with the
lower values we nd
42 Implications for dwarf galaxy evolution
The discrepancy between observed dwarf galaxies and
the evolution prescribed by a close-box model requires
either the inow of pristine material or outow of en-
riched material These mechanisms are also thought to
regulate the development of the metallicity to luminosity
or stellar mass relation observed over the full range in
galaxy stellar mass Skillman et al 1989 Tremonti et al
Detailed study of the H i morphology and kinematics in
void galaxies shows evidence of ongoing accretion of gas
Kreckel et al 2011a 2012 potentially through a cold
mode of accretion Stanonik et al 2009 Cold accretion
in particular should enable pristine gas to penetrate di-
rectly to the central star-forming region of the galaxy
disk and be immediately available to form stars This
accretion mode is seen in simulations to play an impor-
tant role in low mass halos which are preferentially found
both at high redshift and in low density environments at
z0 Keres et al 2005
If we believe cold accretion is more prevalent in voids
then the lack of oset within the metallicity-luminosity
relation in our void dwarf galaxy sample suggests inows
alone do not play a signicant role in driving the metal-
licity evolution of dwarf galaxies Some evidence for this
may be seen directly in KK246 a dwarf galaxy in the Lo-
cal Void which shows evidence of gas accretion Kreckel
et al 2011a yet has a metallicity typical for its size
Nicholls et al 2014b However the assumption that
gas accretion is directly available to form stars may fail in
the case where accreted gas forms an extended disk well
beyond the optical disk where star formation is observed
to occur In KK246 the H i extends out to ve times the
optical radius As the H i detected in the eight galaxies
presented in this letter is largely unresolved Figure 1
we cannot comment directly on the role the distribution
of the H i plays in these galaxies
Additionally four of the eight void dwarf galaxies have
massive nearby companions that are clearly interact-
ing in H i It may be expected that these companions
pre-enrich the gas in-falling onto the neighboring dwarfs
Croxall et al 2009 however again we see no system-
atic dierence between these and the isolated void dwarf
galaxies
In fact VGS 30a which is only 17 kpc from

Two VGS dwarfs have nearby companions diamonds A closed-
box evolutionary model prediction dashed line over-predicts the
metallicity for most galaxies The void dwarf galaxies are in good
agreement with the control sample which shows a general eective

all galaxies are selected to reside within a single nearby
void and thus some may reside in sub-laments within
the void Sheth  van de Weygaert 2004 Aragon-Calvo
 Szalay 2013 Rieder et al 2013 Alpaslan et al 2014
Our sample is carefully selected to contain only galax-
ies residing centrally within dierent 10-20 Mpc diame-
ter voids This does not rule out the possibility of la-
ments within our sample Beygu et al 2013 and in fact
VGS 38a and VGS 38b both appear in a linear congu-
ration with a third larger void galaxy VGS 38 These
two dwarf galaxies however also appear indistinguish-
able from the other void dwarf galaxies and the isolated
dwarf galaxy control sample
Many of the Pustilnik et al 2011 sample are classied
as low surface brightness LSB galaxies which suggests
a relatively unevolved state where star formation and in-
teractions have not yet built up the galaxy disk There
is some theoretical expectation that collapse conditions
forming the most massive galaxies in voids will result in
LSB extended disks Homan et al 1992 however this
is not predicted to aect the dwarf galaxies as they do
not arise from extreme initial perturbations in the den-
sity eld SDSS suers from a bias against selecting LSB
galaxies in the redshift survey making a careful study
of the trends in voids dicult However as our sam-
ple is purely H i selected it should not suer from this
bias Only VGS 30a could potentially be classied as
LSB though it is also clearly interacting with a neighbor
within 100 kpc Figure 1 The predominance of LSB
galaxies in the Pustilnik et al 2011 sample compared
to ours could play a signicant role in the oset they
observe towards lower metallicity

a massive companion shows the smallest eective yield
relative to the closed box model Figure 3
These results suggest it is more likely the outow of
enriched material that drives the metallicity-luminosity
relation As this is an internal process operating inde-
pendently of the surrounding large-scale environment it
is reasonable that the majority of void galaxies will not
show a signicant deviation from the established rela-
tion This may not hold true in specic cases such as
in low surface brightness void galaxies Pustilnik et al
2011 where the star formation may be more distributed
and thus less ecient in driving outows This may also
fail in cases where the surrounding environment is more
dense such as clusters or groups
We nd that the gas-phase metallicity of these void
dwarf galaxies does not dier signicantly from typical
dwarf galaxies at xed luminosity this alone is a sur-
prising result as it indicates that galaxy evolution pro-
ceeds largely independent of signicant dierences in the
surrounding large-scale environment In this way void
galaxies provide a well constrained population of galaxies
that are ideal for detailed study of the internal physical
processes that drive galaxy evolution
