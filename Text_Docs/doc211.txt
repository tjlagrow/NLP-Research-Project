ABSTRACT
Comparing galaxies across redshifts at xed cumulative number density is a popular way to estimate the
evolution of specic galaxy populations This method ignores scatter in mass accretion histories and galaxy-
galaxy mergers which can lead to errors when comparing galaxies over large redshift ranges z  1 We
use abundance matching in the CDM paradigm to estimate the median change in cumulative number density
with redshift and provide a simple t 016 dex per unit z for progenitors of z  0 galaxies We nd that
galaxy descendants do not evolve in the same way as galaxy progenitors largely due to scatter in mass accretion
histories We also provide estimates for the 1 range of cumulative number densities corresponding to galaxy
progenitors and descendants Finally we discuss some limits on cumulative number density comparisons
which arise due to difculties measuring physical quantities eg stellar mass consistently across redshifts A
public tool to calculate cumulative number density evolution for galaxies as well as approximate halo masses
is available online

1 INTRODUCTION
Galaxy surveys spanning a range of redshifts see eg
Grogin et al 2011 Coil et al 2011 Whitaker et al 2011
McCracken et al 2012 Muzzin et al 2013b have allowed
self-consistent studies of galaxy evolution over cosmic time
Yet comparing specic populations of galaxies across red-
shifts to determine the properties of their progenitors and de-
scendants requires an assumption for how galaxies evolve
An easy and popular approach is to compare galaxy prop-
erties at xed cumulative number density over several
redshifts eg Wake et al 2006 Tojeiro  Percival 2010
Brammer et al 2011 Papovich et al 2011 Tojeiro et al
2012 van Dokkum et al 2013 Leja et al 2013 and refer-
ences therein This approach ignores galaxy-galaxy merg-
ers and scatter in mass accretion histories which both af-
the median cumulative number density of a galaxy
population Leja et al 2013 Lin et al 2013 Behroozi et al
2013b Because individual galaxy merger and star forma-
tion histories are not well-constrained more advanced com-
parisons have used either semi-analytical or semi-empirical
galaxy-halo connections to infer galaxy evolution from simu-
lated dark matter merger histories eg Conroy  Wechsler
2009 Leitner 2012 Behroozi et al 2013b Moster et al
2013 Wang et al 2013 Lu et al 2012 Leja et al 2013

ences therein
Previous work has addressed how cumulative number den-
sity changes for median progenitor or descendant galaxies
Leja et al 2013 Lin et al 2013 In this paper we explicitly
contrast progenitor and descendant galaxy evolution and also

address the signicant scatter in progenitor and descendant
galaxy cumulative number densities Here we use abundance
matching to identify galaxy cumulative number density with
dark matter halo cumulative number density Using merger
rates in dark matter simulations we estimate the redshift evo-
lution in the median and 1 range in cumulative number den-
sity for any co-evolving galaxy population We discuss de-
tails of the method in 2 results in 3 interpretations in 4

2 METHOD
21 Abundance Matching Technique
To account for mergers and scatter in mass accretion histo-
ries we use abundance matching between galaxies and dark
matter halos in simulations see eg Behroozi et al 2010
2013ab Moster et al 2010 2013 Trujillo-Gomez et al
2011 Yang et al 2012 Reddick et al 2013 Matching galax-
ies to halos means that halo merger trees can be converted into
galaxy merger trees cf Hopkins et al 2010 A full explo-
ration of the information in these trees is beyond the scope
of this paper which we limit to the evolution of the most-
massive or most-luminous progenitor and descendant galax-
Many ways exist to abundance match observed galaxies to
dark matter halos in simulations see Reddick et al 2013 for
a review We match galaxies in rank order of decreasing stel-
lar mass or luminosity to dark matter halos in rank order of
decreasing peak historical halo mass6 Abundance matching
in this sense has been used successfully to reproduce galaxy
clustering as a function of stellar mass or luminosity7 and
redshift as well as galaxy conditional stellar mass functions
Conroy et al 2006 Moster et al 2010 Reddick et al 2013
Watson  Conroy 2013
6 Because dark matter is stripped from satellites more rapidly than stars a
halos peak historical mass is a better proxy for the associated galaxy stellar
mass than is its current massReddick et al 2013
7 Excluding bands which correlate more with the galaxys star formation
rate than its stellar mass such as rest-frame B-band or UV
BEHROOZI ET AL
Our technique can be summarized as follows
1 Convert a galaxy cumulative number density at redshift
z1 to a halo mass with equal cumulative number density
using peak halo mass functions from Behroozi et al
2013b
2 For halos at that mass at z1 record the masses of
the most-massive progenitor or descendant halos at
z2 according to the halos mass accretion histories
Behroozi et al 2013d
3 Convert the median halo progenitordescendant mass at
z2 along with the 68th-percentile  1 range of pro-
genitordescendant halo masses into cumulative num-
ber densities using the halo mass function at redshift
This method takes as input an initial cumulative number
density an initial redshift and a nal redshift The resulting
nal cumulative number density therefore does not depend on
any additional properties of the initial galaxy population such
as stellar mass or luminosity That said inferred properties
such as the change in the galaxies stellar mass or luminosity
will depend on the stellar mass or luminosity functions used
see 42
We provide a public implementation of this technique8
As this process converts galaxy cumulative number densi-
ties into halo masses our implementation also prints these
out for convenience We currently do not consider scatter
in stellar massluminosity at xed halo mass to the extent
that merger rates per unit halo and specic mass accretion
rates are weak functions of halo mass Fakhouri  Ma 2008
Fakhouri et al 2010 Behroozi et al 2013b this scatter rep-
resents a second-order correction to the median cumulative
number density evolution For the 68th-percentile range in
progenitordescendant cumulative number densities this scat-
ter may be more important which is discussed in 42
22 Dark Matter Simulation
We use the Bolshoi simulation Klypin et al 2011 which
used the ART code Kravtsov et al 1997 to simulate a dark
matter-only 250 h- 1 Mpc3 cosmological volume with 20483
85 billion particles 173  108M each The assumed
cosmology was a at CDM with parameters M  027
  073 h  07 ns  095 and 8  082 similar to
the WMAP9 best-t cosmology Hinshaw et al 20129 Ha-
los were found with the ROCKSTAR phase-space halo nder
Behroozi et al 2013c and merger trees were generated with
the CONSISTENT TREES code Behroozi et al 2013d From
these merger trees both halo mass accretion histories and
merger rates were calculated Behroozi et al 2013b

are expected to be weak compared to the large scatter in mass accretion his-

cumulative number density error bars show the width of the redshift bin as well as the formal uncertainty in stellar mass at a given cumulative number density
from Poisson errors sample variance and photometric redshift uncertainties Including the effects of mergers and scatter in mass accretion histories lled stars
results in a 02 dex change in the inferred mass evolution of 10117M galaxies over this redshift range An even larger relative effect is seen for 101125M
galaxies despite the smaller redshift range over which they can be tracked z  0 - 2 instead of z  0 - 3 in UltraVISTA the change in inferred mass evolution is
already 015 dex The 68th-percentile ranges in cumulative number densities at z  2 are 15 dex and 13 dex for the 10117M and 101125M galaxy progenitors
respectively at z  2 corresponding to 68th-percentile stellar mass ranges shaded regions of  02 dex for both
31 Galaxy Progenitors
In Fig 1 we show cumulative number density evolution
tracks for the progenitors of 109 to 10115M galaxies at
z  01 calculated using the technique in 21 Cumulative
number densities at z  01 were calculated from the stellar
mass functions of Moustakas et al 2013 As discussed in
21 the choice of stellar mass function only affects the ini-
tial cumulative number density for a given stellar mass and
does not affect the cumulative number density evolution
016z dex
As shown in Fig 1 a power law describes the increase in
cumulative number density towards higher redshifts for most
galaxies the change in cumulative number density is simply
as long as the galaxys stellar mass is less than  10112M
at z  0 For  10115M galaxies at z  0 this rate increases
to  022z dex Fig 1 For larger galaxies at z  0 we
recommend use of the public tool in 21 since the change in
cumulative number densities is no longer well-t by a simple
power law
The power-law functional form arises because merger rates
are mostly constant per unit halo per unit z regardless of
time or halo mass and have a largely power-law like de-
pendence on mass ratio Fakhouri  Ma 2008 Fakhouri et al
2010 Behroozi et al 2013b More massive halos do have
somewhat higher rates of major mergers Fakhouri  Ma
2008 Fakhouri et al 2010 Behroozi et al 2013b which
contributes to faster evolution in cumulative number densities
Because the median halo mass as a function of stellar mass in-
creases rapidly above 1011M in galaxy mass Behroozi et al
2013b the effect is most prominent For lower stellar masses
the median halo mass changes more slowly hiding the effect
almost entirely We also note that a major merger in the his-
tory of a halo ie a change of 02-03 dex in its mass over a
short time will have the most impact on its corresponding cu-
mulative number density for massive halos on the exponential
tail of the mass function these are also the halos which host
 1011M galaxies As such for these halos and galaxies
relative rank ordering can change much more easily than for
halos and galaxies of lower masses
As discussed in 42 the 68th-percentile range of progen-
itor cumulative number densities depends on how scatter in
stellar mass at xed halo mass changes with time Nonethe-
less many qualitative features are robust For example larger
galaxies progenitors extend over a larger range in cumula-
tive number densities as compared to smaller galaxies This
is because a small change in stellar or halo mass equals a
larger change in cumulative number density for more massive
galaxies The large range in progenitor cumulative number
densities can also result in signicant differences between the
median and the average progenitor mass For progenitors of
10115M galaxies we predict a scatter of about 027 dex
in stellar mass at z  275 For log-normal scatter this would
imply that the median progenitor mass would be 008 dex less
than the average progenitor mass
Finally we note that the progenitor cumulative number den-
sity ranges of 109 and 1010M galaxies begin to overlap at
z  15 in Fig 1 Thus it becomes difcult to tell which galax-
ies at z  15 become 1010M galaxies at z  0 and which
become 109M galaxies instead Current surveys are gen-
erally not deep enough for this to be a problem eg pro-
genitors of 1010M galaxies would be less than 109M by
z  2 below the completeness limit of most existing surveys
Behroozi et al 2013b
32 Galaxy Descendants
Fig 2 shows cumulative number density evolution tracks
for 1010M galaxies at a range of starting redshifts z  1- 6
Cumulative number densities at the starting redshifts were
calculated from the best-t model stellar mass functions in
Behroozi et al 2013b At higher redshifts  1010M galax-
ies are rarer objects at z  6 for example they are typical
progenitors of 10115M galaxies at z  0
The median evolution in Fig 2 is very different from Fig
BEHROOZI ET AL
1 This is largely due to scatter in mass accretion histories
and the shape of the halo mass function If one selects all pro-
genitors at z  z1 of halos with a given mass at z  z2 many
progenitor halos at z1 will have typical accretion rates for their
mass However some fraction of halos at z1 will always have
unusually high accretion rates And because smaller halos
are always more numerous small halos with high accretion
rates will be disproportionately represented in the progenitor
selection This selection effect explains qualitatively why cu-
mulative number densities evolve more rapidly for progeni-
tors than descendants see also Leja et al 2013
Another important difference comes because of satellite
galaxy mergers We show in Fig 3 the fraction of galaxies
which are lost due to mergers as a function of redshift for the
same starting populations in Fig 2 Every surviving galaxy at
z  0 had a progenitor at all higher redshifts however a signif-
icant fraction of high-redshift galaxies never make it to z  0
Because satellites cannot accrete matter easily the likelihood
that a galaxy merges has a strong correlation with the mass
accretion history of its halo and correspondingly with the
cumulative number density rank of the halo Unfortunately
because of this strong correlation between mergers and halo
rankings it is difcult to give a clean theoretical interpretation
of the shape of the cumulative number density evolution for
galaxy descendants
33 Sample Calculation
For a concrete example we calculate the progenitor mass
evolution of 10117M galaxies from the UltraVISTA survey
Muzzin et al 2013a in Fig 4 At z  0 these have a cu-
mulative number density of 5  10- 6 Mpc- 3 Tracking their
progenitors at xed cumulative number density would imply
that they had very little  01 dex mass evolution from z  3
to z  1 Accounting for the effects of mergers gives a much
more reasonable 02-025 dex in mass growth from z  3 to
z  1 see eg Behroozi et al 2013b
Fig 4 also shows the progenitor mass evolution of
101125M galaxies In this case the relative change in the
median progenitor cumulative number densities is less than
for the more massive 10117M galaxies However due to the
shallower slope of the stellar mass function at these masses
the relative change in stellar mass is larger 055 dex instead
of 03 dex between z  0 and z  2 For the same reason
the impact on inferred progenitor stellar masses from using
xed cumulative number densities instead of a more realis-
tic evolving cumulative number density is more pronounced
for 101125M galaxies as compared to the 10117M galaxies
Fig 4 right panel
34 Comparison with Previous Work
These results are in good agreement with those of Leja et al
2013 who also nd small changes in cumulative number
density for descendants of semi-analytically modeled z  3
galaxies at z  0 Using the cumulative stellar mass functions
in Leja et al 2013 our technique gives an implied median
stellar mass evolution from z  3 to z  0 which differs on aver-
age by less than 005 dex from their reported values  06 dex
of growth for cumulative number densities between 5  10- 5
and 8  10- 4 Mpc- 3 at z  3 These small differences could
arise from their use of a semi-analytical model for galaxy for-
mation a fuller treatment of scatter in stellar mass at xed
halo mass in Leja et al 2013 or a different model for satel-
lite galaxy merger rates see Guo et al 2011 we may explore
these differences in more detail in future work
4 DISCUSSION
41 Progenitors vs Descendants
As explained in 32 cumulative number density evolution
is different for galaxy progenitors ie backwards-looking
comparisons and galaxy descendants ie forwards-looking
comparisons Which direction to use depends on the tar-
geted science question As an example it is most relevant
to use backwards-looking comparisons for galaxy star for-
mation histories as these can be directly compared to his-
tories inferred from galaxy broad-band colors and spectra
eg Panter et al 2007 Tojeiro et al 2009 For examining
the fates of specic high-redshift populations at lower red-
shifts as in analyzing the clustering evolution of luminous
red galaxies eg White et al 2007 Wake et al 2008 using
a forward-looking comparison may be more appropriate
42 Limitations of Cumulative Number Density Comparisons
Luminosities can be measured fairly consistently across
redshifts however
the same is not necessarily true for
stellar masses Marchesini et al 2009 Conroy et al 2009
Muzzin et al 2009 Behroozi et al 2010 2013b Uncertain-
ties arise because the appropriate priors for galaxies at one
redshift may not be correct for galaxies at another redshift
these priors include star formation histories dust content
the star-forming fraction of galaxies metallicities the ini-
tial mass function tting functions for galaxy light proles
and many others Conroy et al 2009 Behroozi et al 2010
2013b Conroy  van Dokkum 2012 Different pipelines ap-
plied to the same survey produce stellar mass functions which
can differ in evolution by up to  03 dex in stellar mass
Behroozi et al 2013b However these uncertainties may
well improve in the future
The evolving quenched fraction Brammer et al 2011
Ilbert et al 2013 Muzzin et al 2013a and the effects of
dry stellar mass mergers Behroozi et al 2013b Moster et al
2013 will also affect this analysis Strictly speaking di-
rectly converting stellar mass growth into star formation his-
tories only applies for galaxy populations which are mostly
star-forming across the entire redshift range considered and
which have a low fraction of merger-deposited stellar mass
Both these conditions are likely satised for eg  Milky-
Way sized galaxies at z  0 Leitner 2012 Behroozi et al
2013b and for UV-selected massive galaxies at high redshift
Papovich et al 2011
Finally the scatter in stellar mass at xed halo mass will
inuence the inferred 1- range of cumulative number den-
sities for galaxy progenitors and descendants In this paper
we assume that the growth in stellar mass rank order dif-
ferences with time is the same as the growth in halo mass
rank order differences with time This will be the case in
reality if individual galaxy star formation efciencies de-
pend much more on halo mass than on cosmic time or en-
vironment Behroozi et al 2013a Different assumptions
eg from semi-analytical or hydrodynamical galaxy forma-
tion modelsmay give different results for the scatter
With these limitations kept in mind cumulative number
density comparisons provide a simple and valuable way to
compare galaxies across cosmic time Brammer et al 2011
Papovich et al 2011 Lin et al 2013 Muzzin et al 2013a
van Dokkum et al 2013 Patel et al 2013
5 CONCLUSIONS
Comparing Galaxies Across Time
We have presented a technique which robustly constrains
the median cumulative number density evolution for galaxy
populations and provides an estimate for the scatter in pro-
genitor and descendant cumulative number densities 21
Our conclusions may be summarized as follows
1 The evolution in cumulative number density for the
most-massive progenitor galaxies is almost exactly
016z dex for galaxies whose z  0 descendants have
stellar mass  10112M 31 Ignoring this effect can
lead to errors in inferred stellar mass evolution on the
order of 02 - 03 dex for a z of 3 33
2 For galaxy descendants there is much less evolution in
cumulative number density 32
the exact evolution in the median and 1
density
evolution as well as for calculating the corre-
sponding halo mass at xed cumulative number
density and redshift we provide a public tool at

4 Galaxy cumulative number density comparisons across
redshifts currently carry systematic errors in terms
of the stellar mass evolution of  03 dex 42
Luminosity-based comparisons eg
for clustering
evolution studies suffer from fewer systematics pro-
vided that the chosen luminosity band correlates more
with galaxies stellar masses than star formation rates
