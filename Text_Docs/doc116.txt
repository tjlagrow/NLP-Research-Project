The History of Galaxy Formation in Groups
An Observational Perspective

School of Physics and Astronomy University of Nottingham UK
Summary We present a pedagogical review on the formation and evolution of
galaxies in groups utilizing observational information from the Local Group to
galaxies at z  6 The majority of galaxies in the nearby universe are found in
groups and galaxies at all redshifts up to z  6 tend to cluster on the scale of
nearby groups 1 Mpc This suggests that the group environment may play
a role in the formation of most galaxies The Local Group and other nearby
groups display a diversity in star formation and morphological properties that
puts limits on how and when galaxies in groups formed Eects that depend
on an intragroup medium such as ram-pressure and strangulation are likely
not major mechanisms driving group galaxy evolution Simple dynamical fric-
tion arguments however show that galaxy mergers should be common and a
dominant process for driving evolution While mergers between L galaxies
are observed to be rare at z  1 they are much more common at earlier times
This is due to the increased density of the universe and to the fact that high
mass galaxies are highly clustered on the scale of groups We furthermore dis-
cus why the local number density environment of galaxies strongly correlates
with galaxy properties and why the group environment may be the preferred
method for establishing the relationship between properties of galaxies and
their local density
1 Introduction
Astronomers have known since the time of Messier and the Herschels that
the faint nebula or what we today call galaxies cluster together This was
before we knew anything else about these systems including their distances
Galaxy clustering remains one of the cornerstones of cosmology and galaxy
formation and most galaxies are clustered in some form This is one of the
major successes of the Cold Dark Matter model of structure formation and
simulations show that the bulk of large-scale structure is composed of individ-
ual groups of galaxies 37 This is found to be the case observationally 24

and it appears that up to half of all nearby galaxies are in groups or clusters
The fact that a signicant fraction of all galaxies are found in groups is
likely an important aspect for understanding galaxy formation and evolution
We know that the local environment1 of a galaxy correlates with most of its
properties The most famous example of this is the morphology-density rela-
tion 23 where galaxies with early-type morphologies are more likely found
in denser areas while spirals are more likely found in lower density environ-
ments Galaxies in low local density regions also have a higher star formation
rate than those in areas with a higher local galaxy density 4030 Whether
the relationship between local density and the properties of galaxies is intrin-
sic or is a result of physical processes that occur in dense regions after initial
galaxy formation is still an unresolved issue
Galaxy evolutionary eects were also rst noticed in the densest areas of
the universe - namely galaxy clusters A high fraction of blue galaxies were
found in galaxy clusters at z  05 compared to local systems 4 These
star forming or post-star forming galaxies possibly provide evidence that
denser environments induce relatively recent evolution in galaxies In fact it
is largely unarguable that dense environments such as groups2 and clusters
induce some evolution When these eects occur and to what degree they
alter the evolution of galaxies is still open for debate
In this review we address some of these issues by focusing on the most
common environment of galaxies - the galaxy group - and how the cumulative
eects of a dense galaxy environment drives the evolution and formation of its
members There are several reasons why the group environment is perhaps the
most important for understanding how galaxy formation and evolution occurs
The main reason is due to the fact that most nearby galaxies are in group
environments which we now know extends up to z  14 27 Furthermore
many of the physical processes associated with galaxy formation eg galaxy
mergers can only occur in group-like environments Therefore groups appear
to be a gateway environment producing galaxies with drastically dierent
morphological and star forming properties from previous eld galaxies
The outline of this review is as follows we rst describe the nal thus
far evolution of groups of galaxies and their properties by examining nearby
1We often refer to local and global environments in this paper The local en-
vironment is the density dened by the volume enclosing a galaxy and its nearest
bright neighbors The global environment refers to the type of environment a galaxy
lives whether it be a cluster a group or the eld without regards to whether the
galaxy is in the core or outer part of a cluster or group The local environment can
be quantitatively measured through a nearest N neighbor approach detailed in eg
2350 or through a friends-of-friend algorithm
2We dene a group as a gravitationally bound system of galaxies with less than
fty members all within 1-2 Mpc and with only a few bright  L members Typ-
ically these systems have masses  1013
 1014 M  and velocity dispersions of
150-500 km s1

groups We then extended these results to higher redshifts and examine pro-
cesses such as star formation and galaxy mergers and how these might be
driven by the group environment Finally we draw some conclusions regard-
ing how the group environment might be inuencing the evolution of most
galaxies The cosmology H0  70 km s1 Mpc1   07 and m  03 is
used throughout
2 Groups in the Nearby Universe
21 The Local Group
The nearby universe provides a number of important clues for understanding
how galaxies in groups evolved The best studied example is of course our own
Local Group with its 35 members each of which has undergone a distinct
formation history see 31 and the Grebel review in these proceedings The
most eective way to determine when stars in Local Group galaxies formed
is to study the resolved stellar populations within these systems The derived
star formation history of the Local Group is clearly very extended and vari-
able even for the most basic dwarf spheroidals The star formation in these
simple and morphologically indistinct galaxies occurred from roughly the time
of reionization until a few Gyr ago 32 Dwarf irregulars and the spirals in
the Local Group including our own Milky Way are by denition still un-
dergoing star formation but they also have old stars produced likely before
reionization
There are a few more interesting facts about the Local Group worth men-
tioning in regards to the history of galaxy evolution While the Local Group
contains four massive members M31 the Milky Way M33 and the LMC
it is dominated by lower mass dwarf galaxies These dwarf galaxies tend to
cluster around the two massive members M31 and the Milky Way There is
also a strong environmental eect occurring within the Local Group dwarf
population The evolved dwarf spheroidal galaxies are located nearest the two
giant spirals while the star forming dwarf irregulars are located away from
the giants This is one example of how the local environment of a galaxy cor-
relates with its properties For more extensive reviews of the star formation
history and properties of Local Group galaxies see 3153
22 Nearby Groups and the Morphology-Density Relation
Nearby groups such as the Sculptor and M66 groups Figure 1 contain a
similar range of morphological and ongoing star formation properties as the
Local Group Because of their distances it is dicult to reconstruct detailed
star formation histories in these nearby groups but they likely have similar
histories as the Local Group
Christopher J Conselice
Fig 1 Examples of galaxies in two of the nearest galaxy groups - the M66 group
and the Sculptor group The galaxies in these groups are similar to the Local Group
with many galaxies undergoing star formation and in the M66 groups an ongoing
interaction between members
We can still however use other tools such as morphologies and ongoing
star formation in nearby group members to understand how these systems
are evolving Star formation is still occurring in both large and small galaxies
in group environments Unless these groups recently formed this implies that
environmental eects that can reduce star formation such as ram-pressure
stripping 44 or the gradual depletion of hot halo gas around galaxies so-
called strangulation or starvation 38 are not occurring - or at the very least
they are not dominating eects However we can see environmental eects
inducing evolution in the form of induced star formation and morphological
distortions due to galaxy-galaxy interactions such as between M65 and M66
in the M66 group Figure 1
The morphology-density relation for nearby and distant groups and clus-
ters reveals that galaxy formation is sensitive to local environment This cor-
relation is such that the higher the local projected galaxy surface density the
less likely a galaxy in that area will be a spiral or undergoing active star
formation 49 However 55 showed that the morphological-density relation
does not hold in a global sense Zabludo  Mulchaey 55 found that groups
of galaxies can have total early-type fractions as low as in the eld or as high
as in clusters fraction  06 which is independent of the global environment
The local environmental density in which group early-type galaxies are found
is as high as the densest environments in clusters of galaxies The passive or
early type galaxies in groups are also found in the centers of groups where
the local galaxy density is highest
The star formation rate of a galaxy also does not correlate strongly if at
all with its global environmental density as measured by velocity dispersions
Galaxy Evolution in Groups
3 It is not the global environment such as living in a massive cluster but the
local environment which correlates with galaxy properties Likewise gravita-
tional interactions between nearby galaxies only alter morphology and induce
star formation when they are separated by less than a galaxy diameter 34
Galaxy formation is therefore a local process
Another nearby galaxy group type that deserve detailed discussion are
the so-called compact groups The compact groups such as Seyferts Sextent
and Stephens Quintet are examples of galaxy groups where the members are
within a galaxy diameter and are likely to merge within about a Gyr While
there is some controversy over the existence of compact groups - some have
argued they are chance alignments - the fact that there is a hot intragroup
medium associated with these galaxies provides strong evidence that they are
bound objects
An indication that compact groups may be the progenitors of mergers
between galaxies are the fossil groups 48 ghost groups and the AWM groups
1 These objects are all systems with massive and luminous X-ray emission
but only contain one bright central galaxy There are some dierences such
as the AWM groups central galaxy having a cD like structure However what
is clear about these groups is that although they consist of only one bright
galaxy they have X-ray proles and dark matter halos that closely resemble
groups This suggests that these systems are recent merger remnants or the
nal stages of a galaxy group whose members merged together
23 Galaxy Groups up to z  14
Beyond about z  03 there have been few searches and systematic studies
of groups of galaxies although this is rapidly changing The rst evidence
that galaxy groups at high redshift evolve was provided by Allington-Smith
et al 1 who discovered populations of galaxies surrounding radio sources at
z  05 They furthermore found that at the same local environmental density
there is a larger amount of star formation in galaxies in groups at z  03
compared to lower redshift clusters This is similar to the Butcher-Oemler
eect found in clusters and possibly arises from the same mechanisms
The rst proper redshift surveys at z  03 found signicant peaks in
galaxy redshift distributions 107 suggesting that real over-densities of galax-
ies exist beyond the local universe The CNOC2 survey pioneered eorts to
characterize the galaxy population in groups at these redshifts 54 which
has only recently been superseded by the DEEP2 and VVDS redshift surveys
212736
The CNOC2 groups at redshift z  05 display remarkably similar scaling
properties as eld galaxies at similar redshifts and in comparison to z  0
groups 54 found a large blue galaxy fraction in both the eld and in groups
up to z  05 with a similar rate of decrease in both environments at lower
redshifts However there are more passive galaxies in group environments at

all redshifts suggesting that the correlation of environment in groups with
the properties of its member galaxies existed at least 5-6 Gyr ago

survey 27 The larger symbols represent groupsclusters with larger velocity dis-
persions with groups at dispersions of z  300 km s1 labelled as the smaller and
red points Courtesy of Brian Gerke
Redshift surveys with a high velocity resolution such as DEEP2 and the
VVDS are allowing us to trace how galaxies cluster out to z  1 One result
of these studies is that galaxies particularly bright galaxies cluster strongly
out to z  14 9 Using various clustergroup nding techniques such as the
Voronoi-Delaunay method individual groups of galaxies can be identied and
studied out to these redshifts 27 Figure 2
Once we have found these groups we can then try to determine how en-
vironment drives evolution up to z  14 Bundy et al 5 have approached
this problem recently through using stellar mass functions at dierent envi-
ronmental densities and redshifts up to z  14 Figure 3 By tting the
spectral energy distributions of galaxies in the BRIJK bands to dierent star
formation histories 5 calculated the most likely stellar mass to light ML
ratio for all galaxies within the DEEP2 spectroscopic survey Through the use
of the observed K-band ux for these galaxies and the derived stellar ML ra-
tio a stellar mass is calculated The mass function for galaxies in high density

Fig 3 The stellar mass function from 5 plotted as a function of density and red-
shift time The mass functions are furthermore divided into red and blue galaxies
The transition between blue and red galaxy dominance ie when Mblue  Mred
does not change with a broad environmental density cut
environments compared to those in low density environments as measured
through a 3rd nearest neighbor statistic in shown in Figure 3
Figure 3 shows that mass functions in low and high density environments
are similar up to z  14 This implies that environment in a very broad
sense is not a critical component for the formation of galaxies - that is a
galaxy or a potential proto-galaxys formation by z  14 does not strongly
depend upon whether it is in a dense region or a lower density region There
are however some dierences between mass functions in low and high density
environments as galaxies at the extreme ends of the environmental density
distribution show signicant dierences There are more massive galaxies in
higher density environments cf 36 but the overall mass function shape
and the characteristic masses of star formation galaxies ie the downsizing
are similar This furthermore implies that environmental processes that could
trigger or halt star formation in groups are not major eects at least since
z  14 This is partially simply another way of saying that most galaxy stellar
mass is formed by z  14 However there is some star formation evolution
in both eld and groupcluster galaxies as observed through direct measures
41 as well as increased blue fractions ie Butcher-Oemler However this
additional star formation does not induce large amounts of new star formation

in massive galaxies and most star formation is occurring in low-mass galaxies
at z  14 in both low and high density environments
24 Young Galaxies at z  2
Large samples of galaxy groups at redshifts larger than z  14 do not yet
exist What we do have is considerable evidence that z  2 galaxies appear to
be clustered and are in environments that are either group-like or forming
into groups In fact there is considerable evidence that higher redshift galaxies
are strongly clustered with the most massive galaxies examples shown in
Figure 4 the most clustered 282039
Fig 4 Examples of high redshift bright galaxies as seen in the Hubble Deep Field
These types of galaxies are the most clustered and often shown direct signs through
color gradients and structures for a recent merger origin
Examples of this clustering can be seen all the way back to where the
earliest galaxies are seen For example deep Hubble Space Telescope HST
imaging of bright z  6 QSOs show an excess of red i  z galaxies sur-
rounding these systems 56 If these QSOs are the sites of massive galaxy
progenitors then it seems likely that they and their companion galaxies will
evolve to become a virialized system - perhaps a group or a cluster Making
the connection between these groupings and modern clustersgroups is not
as dicult as it might seem The large statistical excess of objects with red
i  z colors strongly suggests that these objects are spatially associated with
each other They are furthermore found within a projected radius of a Mpc
or so - which is the typical size of a group or cluster core
Although we can detect galaxy clustering through various techniques out
to z  6 often we know very little about the formation modes of these galaxies
except that they are undergoing star formation Internal galaxy properties as
observed with HST and integral eld units can only be studied in large
Galaxy Evolution in Groups
numbers at z  3 There is now abundant information about these young
galaxies which suggests that their clustering and perhaps grouping is driving
their formation and evolution
Galaxies at z  14 are generally found to cluster quite strongly on small
 1 Mpc scales A recent example of this comes from the Great Observatories
Origins Deep Survey GOODS 29 Due to the high quality and depth of the
GOODS Hubble Space Telescope imaging it is possible to use the Lyman drop-
out technique to nd galaxies undergoing unobscured star formation at z  3
and z  4 The correlation function for these systems has an excess at small
scales over a power-law This excess can be explained by a two component
model for galaxy clustering such that a large scales galaxies are in single
halos where as at small scales two galaxies per halo are needed to explain the
excess 39 There is also a luminosity dependence to this clustering such that
the most luminous galaxies are the most clustered 2839 We will address in
the later part of this review how this clustering might be driving the formation
of galaxies found in early groups
3 Physical Processes in Groups
31 Possible Formation Mechanisms
Galaxy evolution occurs via both internal and external drivers The envi-
ronments of galaxies should have some eect on how galaxies evolve For
example if galaxies are surrounded by other galaxies then gravitational inter-
actions and mergers can induce the formation of new stars remove starsgas
from galaxies due to tides increase the masses of galaxies through accretion
of satellites decrease the number of galaxies from mergers and change the
morphological types of galaxies Furthermore if there exists an intragroup or
intracluster medium then gas can be removed from member galaxies through
processes such as ram-pressure stripping and strangulation 38 All of these
processes are going on but their strength and time-scales are still very much
debated We discuss each of these processes below and why it appears that
galaxy mergers are likely the dominate method by which galaxies in groups
are evolving in the early universe z  15
The eciency of these various processes can be characterized by the ve-
locity dispersion  of an environment Ram pressure stripping has an induced
pressure force  2 where  is the density of the intergroup medium As the
velocity dispersion of groups are typically  250 400 km s1 the eciency of
this process in groups is likely not great and its inuence in clusters of galax-
ies where both  and  are both high is also not clear Likewise high speed
galaxy interactions such as galaxy harassment 46 are unlikely to produce
signicant eects in groups due to the low relative velocities of member galax-
ies This type of process is most ecient in rich clusters of galaxies where the
velocity dispersion is high and galaxies are rapidly interacting with cluster
Christopher J Conselice
members 45 Interactions between a group galaxy and the potential of its
group 6 are also unlikely to be very eective given the low masses of groups
Strangulationstarvation is the processes whereby hot gas is removed from
a galaxys halo after it enters a hot medium This is proposed to halt the
star formation in the accreted galaxy as eventually no hot gas is left to cool
and form new stars It is however not a fast process and has a time-scale
of roughly a Gyr in clusters It also requires a removal mechanism which
is usually an intracluster medium that interacts and removes hot gas from
orbiting galaxies These mechanisms cannot be eective however as we see
star formation occurring in groups Unless these groups are young the time-
scale for truncation of star formation via ram-pressure and strangulation must
be longer than a Hubble time This leaves galaxy mergers and low velocity
interactions and non-gravitational processes such as AGN feedback as major
eects that drive the evolution of group members
32 Galaxy Mergers
Galaxy mergers should be common in groups of galaxies This is due to the
low velocity dispersion of galaxies in groups and the close proximity of mem-
bers Various types of nearby groups such as the compact groups and the
fossil groups are possibly the result of the merger process A simple way to
understand this is through dynamical friction eects which have a time-scale
that varies roughly as as merge  3 Lower velocity dispersion groups there-
fore have a shorter time scale for mergers than galaxies in clusters This is
one reason why galaxy-galaxy mergers in the centers of massive clusters are
rare Simple calculations show that groups with velocity dispersions  300 km
s1 will not have a signicant number of mergers over a Hubble time This
is one reason why galaxy mergers almost by denition must occur in groups
of galaxies
Galaxy mergers and interactions are sometimes observed in nearby groups
which may be a common way to induce star formation in these systems
However galaxy mergers in nearby groups and in groups up to z  1 are
not expected to be common Simulations and analytical calculations of the
dynamical friction process show that galaxies in groups become more centrally
concentrated by about a factor of two since z  1 8 but do not necessarily
merge The eect is strongest for groups with lower velocity dispersions  150
km s1 8 argues that merging in groups at z  04 should be low about
2 per Gyr per group Observations tend to agree that the merger fraction
for massive galaxies is not high but does increase at redshifts z  0  1
134243
The merger rate for galaxies in groups should increase signicantly at
earlier times that is at z  2 The reason is simply because the universe was
denser and galaxies were physically closer together and should thus merge
more often A simple argument shows this to be the case In a -dominated
universe the mass density increases as the Hubble parameter squared or H2

why we see a mix of galaxy types in groups such as early types and spirals with
bulges These spheroidal components were formed when systems underwent
mergers early in the universe with diskbulge systems the spheroids who were
able to re-acquire a disk via gas accretion from the intergalactic medium
Finding mergers and calculating the merger rate at z  1 has been carried
out using deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging 13 The merger fraction
evolution out to z  3 has been computed utilizing structural methods such
as the CAS system 111516 and rest-frame optical observations of galaxies
with NICMOS imaging of the Hubble Deep Field 22 This imaging revealed
that galaxy morphology changes gradually from normal ellipticals and spirals
to peculiar galaxies at z  0 to z  3 18 In the nearby universe most of the
bright MB  20 galaxies are normal Hubble types  spirals and ellipticals
However when we view younger galaxies at higher redshifts we nd that the
fraction and number densities of peculiars rises at the expense of normal
galaxies 47 This morphology-redshift relation has been interpreted as an
increase in the merger fraction with time 13
The merger fraction varies with magnitude and stellar mass such that
the brightest and most massive galaxies have the highest merger fractions at
z  25 This merger fraction declines steeply with redshift approximately as a
power-law fm  1z35 Figure 5 The merger rate can be calculated using
N-body models of the merger process to obtain the time-scale for mergers to

occur as seen through the CAS system 19 Using models with various orbital
properties and viewing angles the time-scale for identifying mergers in the
CAS method is roughly 03801 Gyr for galaxies with stellar masses  1010
M  Knowing this time-scale allows us to calculate the merger rate evolution
for galaxies as a function of time and stellar mass The result of this is shown
in Figure 5
Integrating the merger rate with time lets us determine the number of
major mergers a galaxy with a given initial stellar mass has undergone since
z  3 This simple calculation explained in detail in Conselice 2006 19
results in 4416
09 major mergers since z  3 for galaxies with initial masses
 1010 M  This allows galaxies with stellar masses of  1010 M  which
tend to be among the most massive galaxies at z  2 to grow by a factor
of 10-15 to contain as much stellar mass as the most massive galaxies in the
local universe Most of this merger activity occurs at z  15 with on average
no mergers occurring at z  1 for the most massive systems
What does an increase in the merger rate with redshift have to do with
galaxy evolution in groups We unfortunately do not yet know how the merger
rate varies with redshift and environment but through a chain of observations
we can argue that these mergers are occurring in group-like environments The
argument is simple - the mergers we see occurring at z  2 are in the most
massive galaxies which previously must of been bound pairs or groups These
massive galaxies are also clearly the most clustered as shown by 28 and 39
The scale of this excess clustering is small - about 1 Mpc - similar to the size
of a group
4 Discussion
41 Environmental Correlations
As we have already described in this review there are several environmental
correlations between the local density of a galaxy and that galaxys properties
Perhaps one of the most interesting characteristics of these correlations is that
there is little to no global environmental inuence on the evolution of galaxies
This can be shown in a number of ways including the fact that the star
formation rate of galaxies measured through H equivalent widths correlates
with the local projected surface density of galaxies What is surprising is that
this is independent of global environment such that the correlation is nearly
the same in both clusters with 500    1000 km s1 and within groups
with   500 km s1 3
What is the origin of local density sensitive properties of galaxies This
relates to the classic nature vs nurture debate about whether galaxy prop-
erties are imprinted early in their history or whether they are transformed by
their environment We can argue now with some condence that the observed
correlation between galaxy properties and local density is likely a nature
Galaxy Evolution in Groups
process at low redshift but a minor one that largely involves halting star
formation in accreted spirals Except for low mass systems 45 it is unlikely
that environment induces signicant morphological eects outside of mergers
At higher redshifts where most star formation and morphological evolution
occurs the eventually properties of a galaxy are sealed by its local environ-
We can argue this through observational properties of galaxies and basic
theory First areas of higher density are predicted to form earlier than those
in lower density areas as simple density arguments and simulations show
51 This implies that the rst galaxies should form in higher density areas
This however does not necessarily imply that galaxies in high density regions
should be dierent other than age from galaxies in lower density areas
Observationally we know that the most massive galaxies at z  2 tend to have
peculiar morphologies and average stellar masses of z  1010 M 1847
Elliptical and spiral morphologies were not in place until z  1  15 and the
morphology-density relation is already in place by then 49 The seeds of the
morphology-density relation therefore must have occurred even earlier when
massive galaxies are already highly clustered
Galaxies in higher density regions in the early universe are rapidly merging
with each other The progenitors of these galaxies are not spirals but simply
post-mergers with multiple mergers occurring in a short time interval of a
few Gyr 19 providing no time for the establishment of a stable morphology
Disk galaxies are likewise able to form after the merger epoch has ended In
this sense the morphology and stellar mass of a galaxy is set by the local
density in which it forms The global density is less important for driving
galaxy evolution as merging activity is the dominant process By their nature
mergers are a local process driven by potentials dominated by a few massive
systems or what we call in the local universe galaxy groups
The fact that the star forming properties of galaxies only depend upon
local environment and not global environment is a strong indicator that
whatever process is driving the decrease in star formation with local environ-
ment is not related to the total velocity dispersion or density of the system
where a galaxy is located 35 3 nor to the density of the intracluster or
intragroup medium The quenching of star formation in massive galaxies is
however perhaps not driven entirely by environmental eects The star forma-
tion properties of a galaxy appear to correlate with galaxy mass more strongly
than with environmental density The internal properties of galaxies either
through regulation with an active nucleus 33 or from the time-scale for the
exhaustion of gas must be responsible for shutting down star formation What
is not yet clear is why massive galaxies do not reestablish a cold gas supply nor
have their hot gas cool and form stars This is perhaps related to the galaxy
downsizing whereby star formation is truncated in higher mass galaxies before
lower mass systems at z  1 5

42 Dwarfs and the Global Environment
One galaxy property that does not simply correlate with local environment
is the faint end of the luminosity function or the ratio of dwarf to giant
galaxies This correlation is such that in higher density global environments
the number of low mass galaxies per giant galaxy is much higher than in lower
density environments 25 This tells us rst of all that galaxy clusters cannot
form through the mergers of lower mass galaxy groups This implies that in
global high density environments there are processes that somehow produce
low mass galaxies There is no denitive agreement on how this occurs with
both a primordial origin suggested 52 as well as scenarios in which dwarfs
are formed after clusters are in place 1214 For a more detailed discussion
of this issue see 17
5 Summary
Various observational techniques allow us to study the evolution of galaxies in
groups and in group-like environments up to z  6 By studying galaxies in
groups at various redshifts we can determine the modes by which most galaxies
evolved Four main features of galaxies in groups suggest how evolution has
occurred in this most common environment
I The morphological and star forming properties of galaxies in low redshift
galaxy groups reveal that multiple galaxy formation modes have occurred
This is due to the presence of star forming galaxies such as spirals and ir-
regulars as well as evolved galaxies namely ellipticals and dwarf ellipticals
There are also several examples of galaxies evolving in nearby groups through
interactionsmergers
II Groups in a traditional sense of having a measured velocity dispersion and
found within a small volume can be identied out to z  14 Out to these
redshifts we know that the group environment is very common with as much
as 50 of all galaxies located in groups
III Galaxies in groups out to z  05 evolve in a similar manner as the eld
although groups tend to have a more evolved population at all redshifts thus
far probed This implies that the galaxy formation process or at least residual
star formation is halted more quickly in groups than in the eld This may
however be an eect of groups containing more massive galaxies which end
their star formation earlier than low mass systems What triggers the star
formation in galaxies in groups is still not resolved and the cause may not
dier from what is triggering star formation in eld galaxies
IV At higher redshifts there is evidence for groups in the form of strong
galaxy clustering and merging which produces larger galaxies The universe
was denser at high redshift by a factor H2 and thus galaxies were closer

together The time-scale for these systems to merge is fairly quick and this is
likely the method whereby most early type galaxies and bulges were formed
This is also a natural method for putting the morphology-density relation into
place What remains a mystery is what causes the end to star formation in
the most massive galaxies and why no further star formation occurs
