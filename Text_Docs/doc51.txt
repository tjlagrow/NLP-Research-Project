The evolution of galaxy merger rates and its impact on galaxy
Abstract
properties have been studied intensively over the last decade It becomes clear
now that various types of mergers ie gas-rich wet gas-poor dry or mixed
mergers aect the merger products in dierent ways The epoch when each
type of merger dominates also diers In this talk I review the recent progress
on the measurements of galaxy merger rates out to z  3 and the level of
interaction-triggered star formation using large samples from various redshift
surveys These results provide insights to the importance of mergers in the mass
assembly history of galaxies and in the evolution of galaxy properties I also
present new results in characterizing the environment of galaxy mergers and
discuss their implications in the built up of red-sequence galaxies
Introduction
Galaxy mergers have long been suggested to be associated with a variety of ob-
servational phenomena including Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies ULIRGs
Quasars post-starburst galaxies Active Galactic Nuclei AGN and Submil-
limeter Galaxies SMGs etc
In certain galaxy evolution models these ob-
jects may actually correspond to dierent phases during galaxy interactions
Hopkins et al 2006 Galaxy mergers have signicant impact on galaxy mor-
phology kinematics stellar masses and star formation histories of galaxies as
well as the mass of its central black holes Recent studies on the galaxy lumi-
nosity function LF and stellar masses function SMF reveal that the number
densities and stellar mass densities of galaxies in the red sequence have been
increased by a factor of 2 to 3 since z  1 while that of blue forming galaxies
remain similar over the same period Faber et al 2007 Bell et al 2007 sug-
gesting a migration of galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence One
plausible mechanism responsible for this transformation is through merging of
two blue galaxies the so-called wet mergers gas-rich mergers followed by sub-
sequent mergers among re-sequence galaxies the so-called dry mergers gas-
poor mergers Faber et al 2007 Therefore in order to better understand how
the present-day massive galaxies are assembled and how the galaxies have been
evolved we need to have improved constraints on the abundance of mergers and
where they occur There are three aspects regarding galaxy interactions that I
focus on in this talk the absolute galaxy merger rates the inuence of mergers
in triggering star formation and the environment of merging galaxies

2 Evolution of merger rates
The are essentially two ways to identify interacting system One is to pick
up close pairs using the projected separation and redshift information The
advantage of using close pairs is that they are still well-separated and their
properties have not been strongly inuenced by the eect of mergers This allows
us to select interacting systems based on the properties of their progenitors such
as their masses or luminosities and colors The drawback is that these systems
may not necessarily be close in physical space due to the diculty in separating
the Hubble ow from the peculiar velocity It is therefore required to calibrate
the true merger fraction among the galaxy pairs selected The other approach
relies on morphological classication While visual classication of identifying
mergers seem to be relatively robust it becomes more challenging as going to
higher redshifts and it is also very time-consuming for large surveys What
becomes more popular recently is to use non-parametric parameters such as
CAS denoted for concentration asymmetry and clumpiness and Gini and M20
measurements where Gini is a measurement of ux distribution in galaxys
pixels and M20 is the 2nd order moment of light It has been shown that the
combinations of the above parameters can eectively pick up galaxies in the
middle- and late-stage mergers Conselice et al 2003 Lotz Primack  Madau
2004 Lotz et al 2008 However it is not entirely clear which types of mergers
major vs minor mergers are more sensitive to those measurements
Using the aforementioned two approaches there have been enormous progress
made in order to study the time evolution of mergers rates The evolution of
merger fraction is conventionally parameterized by a power law of the form
1  zm The exact values of m have been diverse see Lin et al 2008 and
references therein This discrepancy comes from many factors including how
the merger samples are selected what redshift ranges are probed and what
types of galaxies luminosity stellar mass color morphology etc are included
in the samples For example it has been shown that the galaxy merger frac-
tion depends strongly on galaxy luminosity and perhaps halo masses Lin et al
2004 Patton  Ateld 2008 Stewart et al 2009 Domingue et al 2009 and its
redshift evolution is also dependent of the stellar mass Conselice 2006 Fur-
thermore the value of m is a strong function of galaxy spectral types as well
A few studies have revealed that the frequency of dry mergers is not low and
could be an important mechanism building up the masses of early-type galax-
ies van Dokkum 2005 Bell et al 2006 In order to investigate the role of dry
mergers in the evolution of galaxies and when it appears to become important
we classify candidates of wet dry and mixed mergers using colors of close pairs
in the DEEP2 Redshift Survey What we found is that blue galaxy pairs show
slightly faster evolution with m  127  035 while red-red pairs and red-blue
pairs possess negative slope m  092  059 and 152  042 respectively
Despite that the physical volume of the Universe increases with time as 1  z3
the departure of m from 3 based on a simple density evolution argument is
mainly due to the clustering eect of galaxies as well as the change of blue and
red galaxy populations With certain assumptions on the merger time scale and
the merger probability of kinematic pairs we are able to investigate the relative
roles of wet dry versus mixed mergers As shown in Fig 1 it is found that
the relative fraction of wet mergers decreases with time while those of dry and

mixed mergers keep growing since z  1 Lin et al 2008 These results indicate
that dry mergers play an important role at low redshift in assembling the mass
of red-sequence galaxies whereas wet mergers are being more essential at earlier
epoch Similar conclusions have also been drawn in the studies of VVDS data
de Ravel et al 2009 and of GOODS data Bundy et al 2009
Regardless of the diculty in extending the merger rate measurement be-
yond z  1 because of the need of deep near-infrared data attempts to probe the
merger rate up to z  3 have been made recently by several groups Conselice et al
2003 Ryan et al 2008 Bluck et al 2009 The exploration of merger rates at
z  2  3 is essential because this period is rough the peak of the cosmic star
formation rate quasar activities and submillimeter sources Based on a limit
number of sample it is suggested that the merger activities at z  2 could be
more frequent compared to z  1 by a factor of 2-4 However whether this
trend continues to higher redshift plateaus or peaks at z  2 is still debatable
This will be a rich area for future studies that use HSTWFC3 and powerful
ground-based near-infrared spectroscopy
3 Triggered star formation in interacting galaxies
Hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers that assume the density-dependent
star formation predict that bursts of star formation occur after the rst pass
during the galaxy encounters Mihos  Hernquist 1996 Barnes 2004 Cox et al
2006 The idea that interactions between two gas-rich galaxies are eective
Lihwai Lin
in triggering star formation however is not new Using local samples Lar-
son and Tinsley 1978 demonstrated that the distribution of interacting sys-
tems have bluer colors and a larger scatter in the U - B B - V  diagram
than normal galaxies indicating a recent burst of star formation happening
in the interacting galaxies Another piece of evidence supporting the tidally-
triggered star formation comes from the far-infrared selected samples most
ULIRGs ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in the local universe are found to
be strongly interactingmerging systems Borne 1999 However ULIRGs are
extreme populations of starbursting galaxies The fact that they are mostly as-
sociated with mergers do not imply that galaxy interactions necessarily induce
high-level of star formations The key to constrain the strength of induced star
formation in merging systems is to have large statistical samples of interacting
galaxies and compare their star formation activities with those of isolated galax-
ies Such exercises have been performed in studies from CfA2 2dF and SDSS
surveys Barton et al 2000 Lambas et al 2003 Nikolic Cullen  Alexander
2004 These works found an anti-correlation between the star formation ef-
ciency and kinematic parameters such as separations and velocity dierences
between pairs supporting triggered star formation due to close encounters It
is worth noting that the level of SF enhancement seen in very close pairs is no
greater than a factor of 2 compared to wide-separated pairs and control samples
even after restricting the samples to be late-type mergers In other words the
eciency of inducing star formation via galaxy interaction is not as dramatic as
one would expect from studies on ULIRGs or HyperLIRGs
Now what happens for galaxy interactions at higher redshift There is con-
sensus that the high-redshift galaxies are probably gas-richer and their struc-
tures could be dierent from local samples eg they could be more bulgeless
If so would that have signicant impact on the activities during mergers To
explore this issue we looked for interacting systems including close pairs and
morphologically merging galaxies in the EGS eld one of the DEEP2 eld
where we have Spitzer MIPS 24 m observations Lin et al 2007 We mea-
sured the total infrared luminosity converted from 24 m uxes and the stellar
masses for both interacting systems and eld galaxies over the redshift range
01  z  11 We nd that while control samples form a nice sequence in
the relation of LI R and M  close pairs and morphologically merging galaxies
tend to lie on the upper end of this sequence It is worth mentioning that LI R
increases as we approach to higher redshifts for a given stellar mass range At
z  1 the control sample can also exceed the ULIRG threshold without inter-
actions as long as their stellar masses are large enough in contrast to the case
at very low redshifts where mergers seems to be the only possible mechanism
to boost the star formation up to the ULIRG level Statistically we found that
at z  1 71  43 of interacting galaxies with M  2  1010 are found
to be ULIRGs compared to 26  07 in the control sample If we plot the
star formation rate eciency versus the pair separation again we see an anti-
correlation between these two parameters Fig 2 On average we nd the
overall SFR enhancement during the interactions is close to a factor of 2 We do
not nd an evolution of this enhancement over the redshift range 01  z  11
However we note that there is a large spread of SFR eciency among inter-
acting galaxies at a given separation indicating that the starbursting eciency
also depend on other factors It could be due to that we are sampling dierent

stages of mergers or due to the variation in internal properties of these inter-
acting systems If we interpret the spread of SFR seen in our sample is mostly
attributed to dieren merger stages our results imply that the overall amount
of enhanced star formation due to merger is probably too small to consume all
the available gas in a couple of Gyrs
There is still room for improvement of the above studies In order to de-
cipher whether it is the internal property of galaxies or the merger stage that
dominate the scatter in the SFR of interacting galaxies rst it would be desir-
able to divide the samples based on various parameters such as the gas contents
mass ratios orbital congurations Second is to have the ability to classify in-
teracting systems into sequential merger stages
In addition to having larger
samples the development of techniques that can be used to map various stages
of mergers will allow detailed comparisons with model predictions and also help
to improve our understanding of mergers

4 Environment of mergers
As discussed in 2 the dry mergers become more frequent at later times mostly
due to the increasing population of red galaxies toward low redshifts On
the other hand we know that there exists well-known color-density relation
Hogg et al 2004 Cooper et al 2006 ie the fraction of red galaxies is greater
in high-density regions compared to that in low-density regions How the growth
of red-sequence galaxies relates to the environment and what is the role of
mergers played in building up such color-density relation remains outstanding
questions
Another reason to study the environment of mergers is to separate the en-
vironment eect on intrinsic galaxy properties when we investigate the triggered
star formation activities Barton et al 2007 demonstrates that most of close
pairs reside in more massive halos compared to eld galaxies Given the fact that
galaxy properties are tied to the environment direct comparisons of the star for-
mation rate between paired galaxies and isolated galaxies may be contaminated
by the environment eect Using constraints derived from cosmological N-body
simulation it is possible to apply isolation criterion for observed close pairs that
are suitable for studies of tidally-triggered star formation
It has been recently shown that dry mergers preferentially occur in the
groups and clusters For example Tran et al 2008 suggested that dry merg-
ers are important process to build up massive galaxies in the cores of galaxy
groupsclusters by studying four X-ray luminous groups at intermediate red-
shifts z  04 McIntosh et al 2008 also found that the frequency of mergers
between luminous red galaxies LRGs is higher in groups and clusters com-
pared to overall population of LRGs regardless of their environment by a factor
of 2  9 in the SDSS sample Yet there lacks quantitative measurements of wet
dry and mixed merger rates as a function of environments One way to probe
the connection between mergers and the formation of red galaxies is to compare
the environment distribution of mergers to the post-starburst galaxies the so-
called KA or EA galaxies Dressler  Gunn 1983 These KA galaxies
are suggested to be the transition phase between star forming galaxies and the
dead red-sequence galaxies and hence they could be the direct progenitors of
early-type red galaxies In Fig 3 we show the overdensity distribution 1  3
Cooper et al 2006 of KA galaxies found in DEEP2 sample Yan et al 2009
versus wet dry and mixed mergers respectively where 1  3 is the projected
surface density relative to the mean density at a given redshift Lin et al 2009
It can be seen that the distributions of mixed and dry mergers alone are distinct
from that of KA galaxies whereas wet mergers and wet plus mixed mergers
distributes more similarly to KA galaxies Lin et al 2009 This servers an
indirect evidence about the linkage between mergers involving at least one gas-
rich galaxy and the formation of KA galaxies Quantitative comparisons await
bigger samples in both KA galaxies and merger systems
5 Summary
I have argued that studies of merger rates eectiveness of the tidally-triggered
star formation and the host environment of mergers are the three keys to pin

down the role of mergers in the evolution history of galaxies Despite that our
understanding of the above issues have been dramatically improved over the last
few years there remains several pieces of details missing in the whole picture
For example under what kind of conditions will wet mergers lead to the quench
of star formation and hence become KA galaxies What is the outcome of
mixed mergers What is the merger rate beyond redshift one How well can we
separate the contributions of minor mergers from major mergers And nally
what is the role of AGN during galaxy encounters Both detailed studies of
individual interacting systems and statistical results based on future larger and
deeper surveys of merging galaxies together with improved numerical modeling
that incorporate more sophisticated physics will provide essential knowledge to
resolve the aforementioned issues
