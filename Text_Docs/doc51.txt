Abstract
The Hawking ux from a black hole at least as seen from asymptotic innity is
extremely sparse and thin with the average time between emission of the successive
Hawking quanta being many times larger than the natural timescale set by the energies
of the emitted quanta While this result has been known for over 30 years it has
largely been forgotten possibly because many subsequent authors focussed mainly on
the late-time high-temperature regime We shall instead focus on the early-stage low-
temperature regime and shall both quantify and signicantly extend these observations
in a number of dierent ways In particular we shall confront numerical estimates with
semi-analytic approximations based on a naive Planck spectrum
First we shall identify several natural dimensionless gures of merit and thereby
compare the mean time between emission of successive Hawking quanta to several
distinct but quite natural timescales that can be associated with the emitted quanta
demonstrating that very large ratios are typical for emission of massless quanta from
a Schwarzschild black hole Furthermore these ratios are independent of the mass of
the black hole as it slowly evolves We shall then show that the situation for the more
general ReissnerNordstrom and generic dirty black holes is even worse at least as
long as the surrounding matter satises some suitable energy conditions The situation
for the Kerr and KerrNewman black holes or even for charged particle emission from
a ReissnerNordstrom black hole is considerably trickier and depends on a careful
accounting of the super-radiant modes
Overall the Hawking quanta are seen to be dribbling out of the black hole one at a
time in an extremely slow cascade of 2-body decays Among other things this implies
that the Hawking ux is subject to shot noise Observationally the Planck spectrum
of the Hawking ux can only be determined by collecting and integrating data over a
very long timescale We conclude by connecting these points back to various kinematic
aspects of the Hawking evaporation process

Introduction
It is or should be well-known that the asymptotic Hawking ux from a black hole is
extremely sparse and extremely thin The interstitial gap the average time between
emission of successive Hawking quanta is many times larger than the natural timescale
set by the energies of the emitted quanta themselves This result was established over
30 years ago 15 but has largely been forgotten quite possibly because many of the
subsequent authors focussed mainly on the late-time high-temperature regime in the
nal stages of the evaporation process 611 The early-stage low-temperature regime
has recently been reconsidered by van Putten 12 13
We also shall focus on this early-stage low-temperature regime and shall develop
several simple semi-analytic estimates based on assuming an exact Planck spectrum
which is not the full story but is sucient to give tolerable estimates at least for
spin-zero bosons We shall compare these semi-analytic estimates with the numerical
estimates of Page 14 These numerical estimates in particular include the eects of
greybody factors Overall and carefully separating out super-radiant contributions
which in Hods article 14 were simply lumped in with the Hawking eect the sparsity
of the Hawking ux is seen to persist throughout the entire evaporation process
We shall carefully dene and justify several natural dimensionless gures of merit
which are suitable for comparing the mean time between emission of successive Hawking
quanta with several natural timescales that can be associated with the emitted quanta
We shall rst focus on non-super-radiant situations We shall see that large ratios
very much greater than unity are typical for emission of massless quanta from a
Schwarzschild black hole Furthermore these ratios are independent of the mass of
the Schwarzschild black hole as it slowly evolves certainly for as long as the Hawking
temperature is well below the QCD scale We shall then show that the situation for
the more general ReissnerNordstrom and generic dirty black holes is even worse at
least as long as the surrounding matter satises some suitable energy conditions and
as long as one is looking at the emission of uncharged Hawking quanta We shall also
consider the eects of particle rest mass on the emitted Hawking quanta
The onset of super-radiance considerably complicates the discussion Super-radiance
can sometimes occur for charged particle emission from ReissnerNordstrom black
holes and for a range of emitted quanta from rotating black holes In particular the
situation for the Kerr and KerrNewman black holes is quite tricky and depends on a
careful accounting of the super-radiant modes Certainly the quanta emitted in super-
radiant modes are quantum vacuum radiation but whether or not one chooses to
call them Hawking quanta is more problematic
 2 
Overall throughout the entire history of the Hawking evaporation process the
non-super-radiant Hawking quanta will be seen to be dribbling out of the black hole
one at a time in an extremely slow cascade Among other things this implies the
presence of shot noise in the Hawking ux Observationally the Planck-shaped
spectrum of the Hawking ux can only be determined by collecting and integrating
data over a very long time We shall conclude by connecting these points back to
various kinematic aspects of the Hawking evaporation process which is now seen to
resemble a cascading chain of 2-body decay processes
2 Strategy
We shall compare and contrast two approaches
 As a zeroth-order approximation it should be perfectly adequate to treat the
Hawking ux as though it is simply Planck spectrum blackbody emission at the
Hawking temperature While we know that a more careful treatment should at
the very least include greybody phase-space and adiabaticity eects 15 see
also references 16 17 and 18 19 nevertheless a zeroth order approximation
using a blackbody spectrum should be quite sucient to set the scale if not the
precise details for the relevant issues we wish to consider
 At the next order of approximation the most signicant limitation on naively
treating the Hawking ux as Planckian blackbody emission emission comes from
the greybody factors Page 14 resolves the Hawking ux into spin-dependent
angular-momentum modes and calculates various quantities of the form
cid90
cid88
cid104Qcid105 
Tscid96m cid104ncid105 Q d
cid96m
Here cid104ncid105 is a completely standard bosonicfermionic occupation number while
the Tscid96m are spin-dependent greybody factors estimated by numerically solv-
ing the appropriate ReggeWheelerZerilli equation for the radial waveform this
all being followed by a numerical integration over frequencies
Including the complications due to the integral over greybody factors does change
the numerical value of our estimates sometimes quite drastically but does not
change the qualitative nature of our results The much smaller eects due to
adiabaticity and phase space constraints will remain negligible up to the nal
stages of the Hawking cascade when the black hole mass has shrunk down to the
Planck regime
 3 
Between them these two approaches give a good qualitative and quantitative handle on
the sparsity of the Hawking ux The blackbody emission approximation will be seen
to work best for spin-zero with higher spins seeing extra suppression and increased
sparsity due to the angular momentum barrier
3 Flat space preliminaries
The dierential number ux quantatime of massless bosonic quanta emitted by
a black body of temperature T  innitesimal surface area dA and surface normal n
into a wave-number range d3cid126k is in at space given by the utterly standard statistical
mechanics result
c k  n
expckkBT   1
d3cid126k dA
Here g is the spin degeneracy factor which is 1 for scalar bosons and 2 for massless
bosons with non-zero spin Then integrating over azimuthal directions
c 2k2 cos 
expckkBT   1
sin  d dk dA
Integrating over the remaining angle   0 2 we see 1
expckkBT   1
The wave-number integral can easily be performed so that for an object of nite surface
area A the total emitted number ux see eg Schwabl 21 is
g 3
3c2 A
The reciprocal of this quantity gap  1 is the average time interval between the
emission of successive quanta

a deep result it appears for exactly the same reason that the Lambert W -function
appears in the constant characterizing Wiens displacement law The quanta emitted
at this peak can only be temporally localized to within a few oscillation periods so it
is safe to take localization  1peak number  2peak number as a good estimate of the
time required for each individual quantum to be emitted 2 Let us now dene the

Let us now introduce key aspects of black hole physics adapting the discussion above
to see how far we can get
4 Non-super-radiant situations
41 Schwarzschild black holes
Under normal laboratory and astronomical conditions one is dealing with emitters
whose surface area is extremely large in terms of the thermal wavelength so in those
situations  cid28 1 However this is exactly what fails for a Schwarzschild black hole
 First T  TH and for the Hawking temperature we have
 thermal  82 rH
Note that the thermal wavelength is a factor 82  7895  80 times larger than
the Schwarzschild radius
H but this corresponds to a cross section of 1
 Second a subtlety arises here as to which area to use Naively one might use
A  AH  4r2
H which
is really only appropriate for some particle species in the low-frequency limit At
high frequencies the ray optics limit the cross section is universally given by
4  and implies that to
smoothly match high frequency results we should set A  A eective  27
16AH 1 25 This is enhanced by a factor of 27

conservative as possible we shall include the 27

As promised the gap between successive Hawking quanta is on average much larger
than the natural timescale associated with each individual emitted quantum Note that
this is a physical situation where the relevant dimensionless constant is not natural 
physically it is not of order unity though mathematically one would quite legitimately
still say the factor is O1 neither is it zero nor innity  the various numerical factors
are important in determining the order of magnitude Physically even more important
is the fact that the mass of the Schwarzschild black hole drops out of the calculation
so that this calculation will be relevant as long as the dominant Hawking emission is
into massless quanta 4 This certainly holds throughout early stages of the evaporation
where kBTH cid28 mec2 and will plausibly remain relevant until kBTH cid46  QCD
Similar calculations apply for the other options we had considered for the localiza-
tion timescale Still working with the Schwarzschild black hole we see that
 If we consider the peak in the energy ux rather than the peak in the number
ux then

4 We shall soon see that for other more general black holes the Schwarzschild result provides a
mass-independent lower bound
 7 
However one chooses the precise details to set up the calculation and whatever the
precise denition of  it is clear that the time interval between successive emitted
Hawking quanta is on average large compared to the natural timescale associated
with the energy of the individual emitted quanta
We now compare this with numerical estimates along the lines of Pages results from
the mid 1970s 14 The specic numbers will change but the qualitative behaviour
stays the same Slightly modifying Pages 1976 analysis 1 2 for emission of a spin s

Where available we have used and adapted Pages 1976 numerical results Where not
otherwise available we have numerically estimated the greybody factors using product

numerical integration over frequencies Our results are summarized in Table 1

Overall we see that introducing the greybody factors because they suppress 
always have the eect of increasing  In particular as one goes to higher spin there is a
larger angular momentum barrier to overcome and the numerically estimated values
of  greatly exceed those obtained from the semi-analytic estimates based on a purely
Planckian spectrum For spin zero the semi-analytic estimates are in good agreement
with the numerical results For higher spin the semi-analytic estimates provide a lower
bound but generally sparsity of the Hawking ux is even more extreme than suggested
by the semi-analytic estimate

412 Massless Fermions
The modications for massless fermions are straightforward First we note that the
dierential emission rate changes to
expckkB  1
Note that the original version of the standard model of particle physics contained only
massless chiral neutrinos with g  1 as soon as one extends the standard model to
contain non-chiral neutrinos then g  2 We shall explicitly retain g both for historical
reasons and to facilitate comparisons with bosonic and Boltzmann results Integrating
over wavenumber and area

For xed g this is certainly less than the bosonic result by a factor 34 Furthermore

Thus it is clear that the time interval between emitted massless fermionic Hawking
quanta is on average large compared to the natural timescale associated with the
energy of the emitted quanta We again compare this where we can with numerical
results including the eects of greybody factors See Table 2 Overall we see that the
semi-analytic estimate is reasonably good for spin 12 though we again expect that
for higher spin the angular momentum barrier will depress  and enhance

For completeness and for subsequent use we now consider the case of particles which
satisfy Boltzmann statistics The dierential emission rate changes to

the number spectrum also lies between the bosonic and fermionic results and is now at

414 The situation so far
Up to this point we have only considered the emission of massless Hawking quanta from
Schwarzschild black holes We have seen that the semi-analytic estimate based on
assuming an exactly Planckian spectrum for the emission gives a reasonably accurate
slight under-estimate for the sparsity of s  0 and s  1
2 emission but that for higher
spin the angular momentum barrier quickly drives the sparsity parameter  even higher

42 ReissnerNordstrom black holes uncharged quanta
In all the situations we have considered so far we have   1T 2
HAH and we have
then used properties of the Schwarzschild black hole to evaluate this quantity For the
more general ReissnerNordstrom black holes as long as we work in terms of the radius
of the inner and outer horizons r we can generically write
r  r
AH  4r2
Consequently for the total emission of massless quanta which are then automatically
guaranteed to be electrically neutral and when working within the blackbody approx-
imation we have
ReissnerNordstrom  Schwarzschild 
r  r2  Schwarzschild
The key point here is that adding charge to the black hole serves only to make the
semi-analytic estimate for the Hawking ux even more sparse
43 Dirty black holes
So-called dirty black holes are black holes surrounded by some generic matter elds 27
Let us keep everything static and spherically symmetric and write
ds2  e2r1  2mrrc2dt2

It is then straightforward to calculate the surface gravity and determine 27

Now as long as the null energy condition NEC holds in the radial direction then this
quantity is guaranteed non-negative Furthermore as long as the weak energy condition
WEC is satised at the horizon then we have H  0 Subject to these two classical
energy conditions holding 28 29 we have  dirty black hole   Schwarzschild The key point
here is that adding extra matter to the black hole environment serves only to make the
semi-analytic estimate for the Hawking ux even more sparse
 12 
44 Particle rest mass
Adding particle rest masses for the emitted quanta one now has
cid16cid1122
0  c2k2kBTH
cid17  1
where 0  m0c2 is the Compton frequency Unfortunately the relevant integral for
the total number ux is no longer explicitly evaluable at least not in any convenient
form and the best one can easily say is this
where Linz denotes the polylog function and 5
H3c2 AH  Li31  f 0kBT 
cid82 
cid82 
f z 
z2x21
expx1 dx
Thus  certainly decreases
Similarly the location of the ux peak is no longer explicitly evaluable in closed
form not even with the aid of the Lambert W -function although it is possible to
deduce on quite general grounds that the location of the ux peak moves upwards
These two observations are enough however to guarantee that  increases as one
introduces particle rest masses and so the semi-analytic estimate for the Hawking ux
again becomes sparser
In counterpoint the binned version of  becomes

It is manifest from the above that 1 binned again decreases so we see that the semi-
analytic estimate for  binned again increases as particle rest masses are added to the
emitted Hawking quanta However as we shall now see once one enters the super-
radiant regime the discussion becomes much messier
5 An explicit representation of the integral that appears in the numerator of f z can be obtained
in terms of an innite sum of Bessel functions but that expression does not seem to be particularly
useful
6 An explicit representation of this integral is also obtainable in terms of an innite sum of Bessel
functions but this expression does not seem to be particularly useful
 13 
45 Summary
At least for spherical symmetry and in the non-super-radiant modes the semi-analytic
estimates for the sparsity of Hawking emission seem to be bounded below by that for
the Schwarzschild black hole
Insofar as we have been able to check the numerical
estimates based on including the eects of greybody factors this continues to hold in
more general situations the Schwarzschild black hole provides a good lower bound on
sparsity at least in the absence of super-radiance
5 Super-radiant situations
Super radiance can occur when for one reason or another one has a chemical potential
 The bosonic occupation number then becomes
cid104ncid105 
exp  kBTH  1
If the chemical potential becomes positive   0 then the occupation number diverges
for    and becomes negative for   0 
In all situations of interest the
greybody factor Tcid96sm simultaneously exhibits a zero and then becomes negative
so that the product Tcid96smcid104ncid105 remains nite and positive 1 The region where
both occupation number and greybody factor are negative is called the super-radiant
regime This phenomenon occurs only for bosons and in the current black hole
context arises either due to charged particle emission from a charged black hole or
for low Lz angular momentum modes from a rotating black hole or a combination of
these two eects For a more general discussion not necessarily black-hole related see
for instance 30 and references therein
There is a denitional ambiguity as to whether one should include the super-radiant
modes as part of the Hawking ux or treat them separately For instance super-
radiance has a well-known classical limit  the Penrose process for mining black hole
rotational kinetic energy If one insists on considering the super-radiant modes as a
subset of Hawking radiation then one would also be forced to assert that the Penrose
process is the classical limit of the Hawking process  an assertion that many would
feel is excessive in its generality
Certainly both the super-radiant modes and non-super-radiant modes are each
subsets of quantum vacuum radiation but the underlying physics is very dierent
and we feel there are good reasons to keep the two notions distinct Hawking quanta
are related to horizons while super-radiance is related to generalized ergo-regions
Hawking quanta are temperature dominated while super-radiant quanta are chemical
potential dominated We shall reserve the phrase Hawking modes for the non-super-
radiant subset of the quantum vacuum radiation modes

51 ReissnerNordstrom black holes charged quanta
The key change for the emission of charged quanta from a charged black hole is that the
boseonic occupation factor picks up a chemical potential   qVH depending on the
charge q of the emitted quanta and the electromagnetic potential VH at the horizon
cid104ncid105 
exp  qVHkBTH  1
If the mass of the emitted particle satises m0c2  qVH then there is a critical frequency
at which the bosonic occupation number diverges and below which the bosonic occu-
pation number is actually negative In that super-radiant region there is no escaping
the relevance of the grey-body factors  the Tcid96mn non-perturbatively dier from
unity and there is no longer any good reason to really trust the semi-analytic approx-
imation based on a pure Planck spectrum In this context we can in fact extend the
usual notion of a ergo-surface in a particle-dependent manner by dening the radius
rE of the ergo-surface to be
while the associated ergo-region is dened by
m0c2  qV rE
r  m0c2  qV r
Note that these generalized ergo-regions depend on both rest mass and electric charge
Astrophysically these generalized ergo-regions are of limited usefulness since astro-
physical black holes tend to quickly neutralise Accordingly we nd it most useful to
concentrate the discussion on the Kerr spacetime
52 Kerr and KerrNewman black holes
For the Schwarzschild black hole in the pure Planck blackbody approximation we saw
that   1T 2
HAH and we then used properties of the Schwarzschild black hole to
evaluate this quantity For the more general Kerr and KerrNewman black holes as
long as we work in terms of the radius of the inner and outer horizons r we can
generically write
r  r

AH  4r2

Therefore within the context of the semi-analytic approximation

 15 
Consequently for the total emission of massless quanta which are then automatically
guaranteed to be electrically neutral and when working within the blackbody approx-
imation we have
 Kerr   Schwarzschild  r2
r  r2   Schwarzschild
The key point here is that adding charge andor angular momentum to the black hole
serves only to make the semi-analytic estimate for the Hawking ux even more sparse
In contrast Hod 14 asserts the equivalent of   O1 for highly extremal Kerr
That is for a  JM 2  aM cid46 1 Hod achieves this by lumping super-radiance
into the Hawking ux In the extremal limit   0 the greybody factors are approx-
imately 1
T   Ccid96s AH    mH2cid961
The bosonic occupation number is
cid104ncid105 
exp  mHkBTH  1
These both change sign at   mH
 For 0    mH the greybody factor is negative
 For 0    mH the bosonic occupation number is negative
Consequently for 0    mH the super-radiant emission is not well-approximated
by a blackbody So it makes sense to split the integral into two regions
 0    mH  super-radiant emission
 mH      Hawking emission
It is well-known that in the extremal limit   0 super-radiance is known to dominate
over the Hawking ux 15

Recalling that  cid29cid29 1 some brute-force integration then yields the estimates
So super-radiance dominates in the extremal limit
In fact super-radiance leads to
rapid spin-down with small energy loss 15 until the system goes non-super-radiant
and then the normal Hawking eect takes over The quantitative details are messy
but the overall message is clear Sparsity of the Hawking ux is the dominant feature
of the Hawking evaporation process
6 Discussion
So long as the temperature remains below the rest energy of the electron we can safely
ignore emission into charged particles
Indeed considering emission into individual
angular momentum modes makes sense only within the specic framework of the Page
analysis 13 and such complications can be safely ignored as long as the Hawking
radiation can be treated as an approximate blackbody Collecting all the various results
we see that throughout the initial low-temperature stages of Hawking evaporation
 For bosonic Hawking quanta  cid29 1 in all situations of interest
 For fermionic Hawking quanta  cid29 1 in all situations of interest
7Note the split takes place in parallel that is
 super-radiant
 Hawking
 17 
 For Boltzmann Hawking quanta  cid29 1 in all situations of interest
This is best summarized as the statement that the Hawking ux is extremely sparse 
the average time between emission of Hawking quanta is very large compared to the
timescale set by the energies of the Hawking quanta The Hawking quanta are dribbling
out one-by-one with very large interstitial gaps This phenomenon persists throughout
the entire evolution of the black hole both in early stages and with suitable minor
modications in late stages Earlier authors have largely conned their attention to
the late-time high-temperature regime 611
The bad news is this Compared to numerics the semi-analytic estimates are often
o under-estimating sparsity by factors of 100 or even more Sparsity if anything
increases when you do numerics that includes the eects of greybody factors Why
the discrepancy Individual photons can at best be localized both in the direction
of motion and transversely to about a wavelength The usual blackbody emission
estimate is based on treating the photons as particles not waves Once the physical
size of the emitter becomes smaller than a typical wavelength more exactly the
thermal wavelength the usual blackbody emission estimate is no longer trustworthy
providing at best a qualitative estimate typically a lower bound on sparsity But note
that the usual statistical mechanics result
expckkBTH  1
should still be valid for    So semi-analytic estimates are OK in the Boltzmann
tail but may mis-estimate things in the low-frequency regime Sparsity however is
here to stay  modulo arguments on how to classify super-radiance
The sparseness of the Hawking ux has a number of perhaps unexpected kinematical
implications
 While early-stage Hawking radiation from Schwarzschild or ReissnerNordstrom
black holes is spherically symmetric this spherical symmetry is only a long-term
statistical statement obtained after averaging over very many Hawking quanta
 Early-stage Hawking evaporation should be seen as a long chain of independent
2-body decay processes involving photons gravitons and neutrinos Similarly
late-stage Hawking evaporation once the temperature exceeds  QCD should be
viewed as a long chain of 2-body decay processes proceeding via the emission of
hadronic jets 611
 18 
 When analyzing the emission of individual Hawking quanta one should use the
special relativistic kinematics that is applicable in the asymptotic spatial region
Consider a black hole initially of rest energy mic2 which emits in its rest frame
but as seen from spatial innity a particle of energy  and rest energy 0
thereby reducing its rest energy to mf c2 Then the conservation of 4-momentum
when written in terms of the 4-velocities V  implies
Therefore
mic2 Vi  mf c2 Vf  0 VH
mic22  02  2mic2  mf c22
mic22  02  mf c22
Depending on whether or not one views black hole masses as being quantized or
continuous one can view this either as a normal 2-body decay or as the decay
of one IMP indenite mass particle  unparticle into another IMP 31 32
It may be protable to reconsider and reanalyze the entire Hawking evaporation
process from this point of view 8
 More radically the fact that the Hawking ux is so sparse calls into question
the appropriateness of the use of bosonic and fermionic statistics at least for
non-equilibrium Hawking evaporation into the Unruh vacuum state For the
intrinsically equilibrium HartleHawking vacuum there is absolutely no doubt
that bosonic and fermionic statistics are the relevant ones but when quanta
are so well separated as they are in the non-equilibrium Hawking evaporation
process it is less clear that bosonic and fermionic statistics make sense since
these normally require multiple occupation of the same quantum mode typically
achieved by being at or at least temporarily near equilibrium 9 On the other
hand in the super-radiant regime it is clear that bosonic statistics is essential
and that the blackbody approximation Planck approximation for the emitted
ux is a poor one
8 MVs early views on the importance of the Hawking cascade can be found in reference 33
Although MV is no longer in favour of the particular way that black hole entropy was discretized in
that article the comments regarding the importance of the nal particle cascade leading to complete
evaporation of Planck-scale black holes still hold
9 For instance this certainly happens in a quasi-continuous-wave laser where photon emission
is not really continuous  nite bandwidth is inversely related to nite coherence time Typically
one has short microsecond photon pulses with very high occupation numbers so bosonic statistics is
completely appropriate
 19 
 Finally and even more speculatively the sparsity of the Hawking ux provides a
very obvious place to hide information without signicant energy cost  the gaps
between the Hawking quanta can easily encode signicant information without
disturbing the time-averaged emission spectrum  this would eectively be a
phase modulated Hawking ux
In summary The extreme sparsity of the Hawking ux is a rather under-appreciated
feature of the Hawking evaporation process Hawking evaporation is seen to be a slow
dribbling out of Hawking quanta with the individual quanta being well separated in
time The gap between individual quanta being hundreds of times longer than the
natural timescales associated with the quanta This decay chain viewpoint has a
number of tantalisingly interesting physical implications
