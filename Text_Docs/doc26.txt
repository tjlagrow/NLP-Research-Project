Abstract
We investigate the eects to all orders in the Planck length from a generalized un-
certainty principle GUP on black holes thermodynamics We calculate the corrected
Hawking temperature entropy and examine in details the Hawking evaporation process
As a result the evaporation process is accelerated and the evaporation end-point is a zero
entropy zero heat capacity and nite non zero temperature black hole remnant BHR In
particular we obtain a drastic reduction of the decay time in comparison with the result
obtained in the Hawking semi classical picture and with the GUP to leading order in the
Planck length

Introduction
Recently a great interest has been devoted to the study of the eects of generalized uncertainty
principles GUPs and modied dispersion relations MDRs on black holes thermodynamics
The concepts of GUPs and MDRs originates from several studies in string theory approach to
quantum gravity 1- 4 loop quantum gravity 5 noncommutative space-time algebra 6 - 8
and black holes gedanken experiments 9 - 10 All these approaches indicate that the standard
Heisenberg uncertainty principle must be generalized to incorporate additional uncertainties
when quantum gravitational eects are taken into account Actually it is believed that any

promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity must include the GUPs andor MDRs
as central ingredients
The main consequence of the GUP is the appearance of a minimal length scale of the order of
the Planck length which cannot be probed providing a natural UV cut-o and thus corrections
to black holes thermodynamic parameters are expected at the Planck scale
The consequences of GUPs andor MDRs on black holes thermodynamics have been considered
intensively in the recent literature on the subject 11 - 16 Notably it has been shown that
GUP prevents black holes from complete evaporation exactly like the standard Heisenberg
principle prevents the hydrogen atom from total collapse 17 Then at the nal stage of the
Hawking radiation process of a black hole a inert black hole remnant BHR continue to exist
with zero entropy zero heat capacity and a nite non zero temperature The inert character of
the BHR besides gravitational interactions makes this object a serious candidate to explain
the nature of dark matter 18 19 On the other hand a particular attention has been also
devoted to the computation of the entropy of a black hole and the sub-leading logarithmic
correction 20 - 34
All the above studies have been performed with a GUP to leading order in the Planck length
However recent generalization of the GUP induces quantitative corrections to the entropy and
then inuences the evaporation phase of the black hole 35 Besides this growing interest in
quantum gravity phenomenology a intense activity is actually devoted to possible production of
black holes at particle colliders 36 37 and in ultrahigh energy cosmic ray UHECR airshowers
38 39 The next generation of particle colliders are planned to reach a c-m energy of the order
of few TeV  a scale at which the complete evaporation of BH is expected to end leaving up
in a scenario with GUP a inert BHR Then it is phenomenologically relevant to obtain the
corrections to BH thermodynamic parameters in the framework of a GUP beyond the leading
order in the Planck length
In this paper we discuss the eects brought by a generalization of the GUP to all orders in the
Planck length on thermodynamic parameters of the Schwarzschild black hole  Hereafter we
refer to this version of GUP as GUP
The organization of this work is as follows In section 2 we introduce a deformed position and
momentum operators algebra leading to GUP and examine its various implications In section
3 the Hawking temperature and entropy are computed and the departures from the standard
case shown In section 4 we calculate the deviation from the standard Stefan-Boltzmann law
of the black body radiation spectrum and investigate the Hawking evaporation process of black
holes by a calculation of the evaporation rate the decay time and the heat capacity Finally
we compare our results with the ones obtained in the context of the GUP to leading order in
the Planck length commonly used in the literature Our conclusions are summarized in the last
section
2 Generalized uncertainty principle
Loop quantum gravity and string theory approach to quantum gravity predict slight deviations
in the laws describing photons propagation in vacuum It is expected that these eects leading
to a modied dispersion relation MDR could be amplied by cosmological distances and then
become observables 40 On the other hand quantum gravity phenomenology has been tackled
within eective models based on MDRs andor GUPs and containing the minimal length as
a natural UV cut-o Recently the relation between these approaches has been claried and
established 41
The idea of a minimal length can be modelled in terms of a quantized space-time and goes
back to the early days of quantum eld theory 42 see also 40  43  An other approach is
to consider deformations to the standard Heisenberg algebra 7 8 which lead to generalized
uncertainty principles In this section we follow the latter approach and exploit results recently
obtained Indeed it has been shown in the context of canonical noncommutative eld theory
in the coherent states representation 47 and eld theory on non-anticommutative superspace
48 49 that the Feynman propagator display an exponential UV cut-o of the form exp p2
where the parameter  is related to the minimal length This framework has been further
applied in series of papers 50 to the black hole evaporation process
At the quantum mechanical level the essence of the UV niteness of the Feynman propagator
can be also captured by a non linear relation p  f k between the momentum and the wave
vector of the particle 41 This relation must be invertible and has to fulll the following
requirements
1 For smaller energies than the cut-o the usual dispersion relation is recovered
2 For large energies the wave vector asymptotically reaches the cut-o
In this case the usual momentum measure dnp is deformed and becomes dnpQi
 In the
following we will restrict ourselves to the isotropic case and work with one space-like dimension
Following 47 49 and setting   2L2

where  is a dimensionless constant of order one
From Eq1 we obtain the dispersion relation
2LP l
k p 
erfcid18 LP l

from which we have the following minimum Compton wavelength

Let us show that these results can be obtained from the following representation of the position
and momentum operators
X  i expcid182L2

The corrections to the standard Heisenberg algebra become eective in the so-called quantum
regime where the momentum and length scales are of the order of the Planck mass MP l and of
the Planck length LP l respectively
The hermiticity condition of the position operator implies the following modied completeness

From Eq5 we observe that we have reproduced the Gaussian damping factor in the Feyn-
man propagator 47 49 The algebra dened by Eq 4 leads to the following generalized
commutator and generalized uncertainty principle GUP

2cid28expcid182L2

In order to investigate the quantum implications of this deformed algebra we consider the
saturate GUP and solve for P  Using the property hP 2ni  hP 2in and P 2  hP 2ihPi2
the saturate GUP is then given by
Taking the square of this expression we obtain

where we have set W u  2 2L2

The equation given by Eq9 is exactly the denition of the Lambert function 51 The
Lambert W function is a multivalued functions Its dierent branches are labelled by the integer
k  012    When u is a real number Eq9 have two real solutions for 0  u   1
denoted by W0u and W1u or it can have only one real solution for u  0 namely W0u 
For -  u   1
Using Eq9 the uncertainty in momentum is then given by
e  Eq9 have no real solutions
P  
2 X
2 X2
Then from the argument of the Lambert function in Eq10 we have the following condition
2 X2
which leads to a minimal uncertainty in position given by
Xmin r e
LP le
The absolutely smallest uncertainty in position or minimal length is obtained for physical
states for which we have hPi  0 and P   cid02LP lcid1  and is given by
X0 r e
In terms of the minimal length the momentum uncertainty becomes

This expression of P  containing only odd powers of X is consistent with a recent analysis
in which string theory and loop quantum gravity considered as the most serious candidates for
a theory of quantum gravity put severe constraints on the possible forms of GUPs and MDRs
Before ending this section and for later use let us recall the form of the GUP to leading order
in the Planck length widely used in the literature on quantum gravity phenomenology This
GUP is given by
A simple calculation leads to the following minimal length

which is of order of the Planck length However as nicely noted in 41 this form of GUP do
not fulll the second requirement listed above In the following sections we use the form of the
GUP given by Eq14 and investigate the thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild black hole

3 Black hole thermodynamics
The metric of a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole is given by
ds2 cid181 
r cid19 dt2 cid181 
r cid191
where M represents the mass of the black hole The Schwarzschild horizon radius located at
rh is dened by
dr2  r2d2
Near-horizon geometry considerations suggests to set X  rh and then Eq19 leads to
minimum horizon radius and minimum mass given by
rh  2MG
Therefore black holes with mass smaller than M0 do not exist
In the standard Hawking picture temperature and entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole of
mass M are 52 53
rh  X0 r e
LP l M0 
 S  4GM 2
Let us then examine the corrections to the above expressions due to the GUP Following the
heuristic argument of Bekenstein we have
Using Eq14 the GUP-corrected Hawking temperature is
exp

M cid192 
On substituting Eq20 into Eq23 we obtain the following black hole maximum temperature
22
The corrections to the standard Hawking temperature are obtained by expanding Eq23 in
terms of 1

The variation of the Hawking temperature Eq23 with the mass of the black hole is shown
in gure 1
It is interesting to inverse Eq23 and write the mass of the black hole as a function of the
temperature

2cid18 TH
H cid192 
This relation shows that for temperatures larger than T max
H  the black hole mass increases with
temperature In our framework such a behavior is forbidden by the cut-o brought by GUP
However in the noncommutative approach to radiating black hole this behavior is allowed
because of a lack of a generalized uncertainty principle 50

line GUP doted line and GUP results solid line for 075 red 1 green 125 blue
respectively
We turn now to the calculation of the micro canonical entropy of a large black hole In the stan-
dard situation the entropy is proportional to the black hole horizon-area Following heuristic
considerations due to Bekenstein the minimum increase of the area of a black hole absorbing a
classical particle of energy E and size R is given by A0  4L2
P l ln 2 ER At the quantum
mechanical level the size and the energy of the particle are constrained to verify R  2X and
E  P  Then we have A0  8L2
P l ln 2 XP
Extending this approach to the case with GUP and using near horizon geometry considerations
we obtain
A0  4L2
where A  4 X2 and A0  4 X2
0 are respectively the horizon area and minimum horizon
area of the black hole With the aid of the Bekenstein calibration factor for the minimum
increase of entropy S0  ln 2 we have

We observe that we have reproduced in our framework with GUP the log-area correction
with a negative sign Other approaches like string theory loop quantum gravity and eectif
models with GUPs andor MDRs lead to the same sub-leading logarithmic correction Setting

From gures 1 and 2 it follows that the GUP-corrected temperature and entropy are respec-
tively higher and smaller than the semi classical results
4 Black holes evaporation
As a warming to study the Hawking radiation process of the Schwarzschild black hole we
examine the eects of GUP on the black body radiation spectrum With the aid of the
squeezed momentum measure given by Eq5 which suppress the contribution of unwanted
high momenta the energy density of a black body at temperature T is dened by
Using the variable y  p   1T  and expanding the exponential equation 36 becomes
E2Z d3pe2L2
T  1
E  8T 4

T TP l2nZ

Now with the help of the following denition of the Riemann zeta function
we obtain
E  8T 4
1n
ey  1
  s  s 
T TP l2n  2n  4  2n  4 
This energy density is dened only for values of temperatures below some characteristic scale
In fact Eq39 is an alternating series which converge if and only if
ncid20 1
T TP l2n  2n  4  2n  4cid21  0
From this relation it follows that
T  1TP l
as expected from the Gaussian damping factor in Eq36 However we note that we have a
stronger condition on T  Indeed in our framework the maximum temperature of the black hole
is given by Eq24 and it is approximately 01TP l for  of order one Then the condition on
the BH temperature is rewritten as T TP l  01 For our purpose the latter constraint allows
us to cut the series in Eq39 at n  1 Using  4  4
945 and Eq24 we nally
obtain from Eq39  the following expression

The rst term is the standard Stefan-Boltzmann law while the second term is the correction

We are now ready to study the Hawking evaporation process The intensity emitted by a black
hole of mass M is dened by
I  AE TH 
where A is the BH horizon area Invoking energy conservation the evaporation rate of the
black hole is

The variation of the evaporation rate with the black hole mass is shown in Figure 3 We clearly
observe that the divergence for M  0 in the standard description of the black hole evaporation
process is now completely regularized by the GUP This regularization is also reected by the
constraint 41 which suppress the evaporation process beyond the Planck temperature This
phenomenon is similar to the prevention by the standard uncertainty principle of the hydrogen
atom from total collapse In our picture the regularization can be considered as a dynamical
eect and not as a consequence of any quantum symmetry in the theory

GUP doted line and GUP results solid line for   090 red    1 green and   125

On the other hand we observe that the evaporation phase ends when the BH mass becomes
equal to M0 with a minimum rate given by

Thus the evaporation process of a black hole with initial mass M  M0 continue until the
horizon radius becomes X0  leaving a massive relic referred to in the literature as a black
hole remnant BHR To nd the nature of the BHR we calculate the heat capacity dened by

conclude that the heat capacity of the black hole vanishes at the end point of the evaporation
process characterized by a BHR with mass M0Besides the gravitational interaction with the
surrounding the vanishing of the heat capacity reveals the inert character of the BHRs and
thus make them as potential candidates to explain the origin of dark matter 18 19 Finally
we note that as it is the case with the form of the GUP to leading order in the Planck length
the BHRs are also a consequence of GUP 17 55
We have drawn the variation of the heat capacity with BH mass in gure 4 In it we see that
the heat capacity vanishes for M0  050 075 in the case with GUP and M0  058 087 in
the case with GUP

The standard expression of the heat capacity C  8M 2 is reproduced in the limit of black
holes with mass larger than the minimum mass M0 The correction terms to the heat capacity
due to GUP are all positive indicating that the evaporation process is accelerated and leading
to a corrected decay time smaller than the decay time in the standard case
Let us consider a black hole starting the evaporation process with a mass M and ending the

Let us now turn to a comparison of the corrected BH thermodynamics with GUP with the
corrections brought by the GUP to leading order in the Planck length Since our comparison
is quantitative we use the Planck units Repeating the same calculations as above with the
GUP given by Eq16 the temperature the entropy and the heat capacity of the black hole
are respectively given by

The minimum black hole mass and maximum temperature allowed by GUP are M0  X0 2 
2 and Tmax  12 In gures 1 2 3 and 4 we have plotted besides the results obtained with
GUP the variation of temperature entropy evaporation rate and heat capacity with GUP as
functions of the black hole mass for dierent values of the parameter  Figure 2 shows that in
the scenario with GUP the BH entropy decreases compared to the entropy in the standard
case and the scenario with GUP This reveals the deeper quantum nature of the black hole
in the scenario with GUP Thus quantum eects become manifest at an earlier stage of the
evaporation phase than was predicted by the semi classical Hawking analysis 54 and the GUP
analysis 55
The calculation of the evaporation rate in the framework with GUP requires a careful analysis
In all the calculations done until now the validity of the Stefan-Boltzmann law is assumed
ignoring the UV cut-o implemented by GUP However it was pointed in 16 that the eect
of the GUP should be also reected in a modication of the de Broglie wave length relation
2pcid01  2p2cid1 
This relation must be translated into a modication of the momentum measure such that the
contributions of high momenta are suppressed As shown in 7 the GUP to leading order in
the Planck length leads to a squeezing of the momentum measure by a factor
12L2
following the same calculation leading to Eq39  the energy density of a black body with GUP
1  2L2
T  1
Performing the integral and using the same argument as before we obtain the expression given
by Eq 42  We note that in a recent calculation of the Stefan-Boltzmann law with GUP
24 the sign of the correction term is positive in contradiction with the role of the UV cut-o
implemented by the GUP
The correct evaporation rate with GUP is then given by

In gure 3 we observe that the evaporation process with GUP is retarded compared to the
process with GUP and that the process ends at a mass M0  2 with a minimum rate given
dt cid19minGU P
cid18 dM
1260M 2
which is greater in absolute value than the one obtained with GUP
In table 1 we show the GUP and GUP-corrected thermodynamics of two black holes with
initial mass equal to 2MP l and 5MP l for   1 The rst row gives the semi classical Hawking
results The second row gives the GUP-corrected results and the third row the GUPcorrected
ones It is interesting to note that in the scenario with GUP the nal stage of the evaporation
phase is a remnant with a mass larger than the one obtained with GUP and that the decay time
is drastically reduced In a scenario with extra dimensions these results may have important
consequences on possible black holes production at particle colliders and in ultrahigh energy
cosmic ray UHECR air-showers

guishable in the two version of GUP in the limit of large mass and small values of  However for
growing values of the parameter  corresponding to strong gravitational eects the predictions
of the two GUPs concerning the entropy become dierent even for massive black holes

In this paper we have studied how black holes thermodynamic parameters are aected by a
GUP to all orders in the Planck length We have obtained exact analytic expressions for the
Hawking temperature and entropy Particularly we found that a black hole with a mass smaller
than a minimum mass do not exist The existence of a energy scale which is one order below the
Planck scale allowed us to calculate to leading order the deviations from the standard Stefan-
Boltzmann law Then we investigated the Hawking radiation process of the Schwarzschild
black hole and shown that at the end of the evaporation phase a inert massive relic continue
to exist as a black hole remnant BHR with zero entropy zero heat capacity and non zero
nite temperature For completeness we have also compared our results with the semi classical
results and the predictions of the GUP to leading order in the Planck length In particular
we have shown that the entropy in our framework is smaller than the entropy in the standard
case and with GUP We have also made the correct calculation of the evaporation rate with
GUP Finally we have shown that black holes with the form of GUP used in this paper are
hotter shorter-lived and tend to evaporate less than black holes in the semi classical and the
GUP to leading order pictures On the other hand we have found that the predictions of the
GUP to all orders in the Planck length and the GUP to leading order in the Planck length
concerning the entropy become dierent for strong gravitational eects and large black holes
mass suggesting a further investigation of the early universe thermodynamics in the framework
with the GUP to all orders in the Planck length In a future work we will examine the eects of
the GUP to all orders in the Planck length on black holes thermodynamics in a scenario with
extra dimensions
