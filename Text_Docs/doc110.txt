Abstract
Some aspects of the chemical evolution of late-type dwarf galaxies are reviewed together with
their implications on some issues of cosmological relevance A more detailed approach to model
their evolution is suggested The importance of deriving the star formation history in these
systems by studying their resolved stellar populations is emphasized
Introduction
People have been studying the evolution of late-type dwarf galaxies for two-three decades but only
in the last 56 years this has become a fashionable research eld This late interest is probably due
to the circumstance that cosmologists have recently discovered that understanding the evolution
of the gaseous and stellar constituents of these systems is a necessary step for a correct analysis of
some important problems of cosmological relevance The connection between late-type dwarfs and
cosmology is at least three-fold 1 given the high gas content and low metallicity of irregular and
blue compact galaxies hereinafter Irrs and BCDs respectively they are the closest analogues to
primeval galaxies 2 they are the systems currently providing the safest empirical estimate of the
primordial 4He abundance 3 they have been suggested 5-6 years ago eg Lilly et al 1995 Babul
 Ferguson 1996 to be the local counterparts of the blue objects in excess in deep galaxy counts
at intermediate redshifts
Here I will try to summarize what can be learnt from chemical evolution models and stellar
population studies of Irrs and BCDs and what this implies for these three issues of cosmological rel-
evance In the following discussion I will emphasize the open questions rather than the important
results already achieved in the eld
2 Evolution of late-type dwarfs
When a galaxy forms after a while it begins to form stars and starts a series of cycles following
in general the scheme drawn by Tinsley 1980 The stars evolve and synthesize in their interiors
heavier and heavier elements and then eject them in the surrounding medium when they lose
mass and die In this way they pollute the interstellar medium ISM and modify both its mass
and chemical composition In the meantime the ISM mass and metallicity may change also for
gas exchanges with adjacent regions gas losses or accretions or both The next generation of
stars thus form in that ISM with a dierent initial composition and must have therefore a slightly
dierent evolution
Models for galaxy chemical evolution take these phenomena into account as well as their eects
on the stellar and gaseous properties by simplisticly parametrizing the physical mechanisms The

Chemical evolution models for Irrs and BCDs have been computed by several groups in the
last twenty years eg Matteucci  Chiosi 1983 Matteucci  Tosi 1985 Pilyugin 1993 Marconi
et al 1994 Carigi et al 1995 Larsen et al 2000 Recchi et al 2001 The combination of the
predictions of these models with the information on the evolution of Irrs and BCDs from other kinds
of studies have interesting consequences on the three issues of cosmological relevance mentioned in
the Introduction
Irrs and BCDs as almost primeval galaxies 
Back in 1973 Searle et al suggested that the blue colors low metallicities and high gas fractions
of BCDs could be self-consistently explained only if these systems either are experiencing now their
rst episode of SF activity or have a very discontinuous SF regime dominated by short intense
bursts separated by long quiescent phases see eg the top right-hand panel in Fig5
Almost thirty years later however no convincing case of galaxy at its rst SF experience has
been found yet all the systems for which suciently deep photometry exists reveal the presence
of stellar populations as old as the maximum lookback time allowed by the photometric depth
see also Schulte-Ladbeck this volume Even IZw18 the most metal-poor galaxy ever discovered
when imaged with HST has been recognized to contain stars at least a few hundreds Myr old
Aloisi et al 1999 have shown that the colour-magnitude diagram CMD derived from optical
WFPC2 photometry of IZw18 contains several faint red stars see left panel in Fig1 which can
only be objects in the asymptotic giant branch AGB phase of low and intermediate mass stars
and must therefore have ages between a minimum of 200-300 Myr up to a few Gyrs Exactly
the same conclusion has been independently reached by Ostlin 2000 on the basis of near-infrared
Nicmos imaging right panel in Fig1
Since lack of evidence is certainly not evidence of lack this result does not exclude that really
young galaxies do exist but clearly restricts their possible number to a small fraction of the known
late-type dwarfs If Searle et al 1973 were right then the vast majority of BCDs should have a
bursting mode of SF This was indeed suggested by many chemical evolution models eg Matteucci
 Tosi 1985 Pilyugin 1993 which conrmed that the best way to reproduce simultaneously
colours chemical abundances and gas fractions of BCDs and possibly of Irrs was to have only a

late-type dwarfs and as predicted curves by chemical evolution models Pilyugin 1993 on the left
panel Marconi et al 1994 on the right panel
few 710 at most episodes of strong SF activity with long quiescent intervals This conclusion
has however been questioned by more recent models eg Carigi et al 1995 Legrand 2000
suggesting that continuous SF regimes with very low rates could account equally well for the
observed features
The lack of unique scenarios from chemical evolution models of late-type dwarfs is due to the
fact that we do not have yet sucient observational data to properly constrain them For what
concerns the SF regime the most direct way to infer it from observations is from the CMDs of
systems close enough to be resolvable in single stars
22 The heliummetallicity relation
 3  105 and hence either 4He was high in mass fraction Yp
The primordial 4He abundance is nowadays one of the hottest issues in cosmology due to the recent
observational data Tytler et al 2000 and references therein showing that primordial D was quite
low DHp
024 or the
standard theories of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis are not self-consistent The only method currently
considered reliable to derive the primordial helium abundance is based on the extrapolation to zero-
metallicity of the heliummetallicity relation derived from observations of HII regions in metal-poor
galaxies Since the heavy elements more reliably derived from HII regions are oxygen and nitrogen
what people actually use are the heliumoxygen and heliumnitrogen relations inferred from a
linear t to the data see eg Izotov et al 1997
One of the questions on this method is whether or not these relations can be taken as linear He
N and O are synthesized in dierent stellar mass ranges helium is produced by all stars nitrogen
almost exclusively by intermediate mass stars and oxygen only by massive ones and this implies
that the timescales for their ISM enrichment are quite dierent from each other This point was
explicitely addressed by Pilyugin 1993 who showed with his chemical evolution models that the
evolution of He with O and with N in a BCD is not linear but has typically a saw-tooth shape
see left-hand panel in Fig2
Furthermore all chemical evolution models of these galaxies invoke the occurrence of signicant
galactic winds during their life and these winds are often required to be more eective in removing
elements like oxygen expelled from massive stars If these dierential winds occur this also makes
the behaviour of helium with oxygen non linear during the lifetime of a dwarf as shown both by
Pilyugin 1993 and Marconi et al 1994 and illustrated in the right-hand panel of Fig2 The
questions are Do the winds actually occur and in what percentage of Irrs and BCDs  If they do
occur do they really remove some which  elements for ever  With what eciency  Several
optical and X-ray observations of ionized laments and bubbles in some Irrs and BCDs conrm
that somewhere the phenomenon does take place and seem to preferentially eject alpha-elements
see eg Meurer et al 1992 Sahu  Blades 1997 Hensler et al 1998 for NGC1705 However
hydrodynamical models of the SN ejecta in dwarf galaxies do not agree yet on the timescales or
on the eciency of the gas removal cfr Silich  Tenorio-Tagle 1998 DErcole  Brighenti 1999
Mac Low  Ferrara 1999
In spite of the above arguments I personally believe that a linear t to the observed helium
oxygen and heliumnitrogen distributions derived from HII regions is the correct approach to infer
the primordial 4He In fact each data point in the empirical distribution corresponds to the nal
ie present epoch stage of the HeO and HeN behaviours in each galaxy and to derive the mean
initial 4He one needs to average over all the possible behaviours of the whole sample of galaxies
The observed shape of the distribution suggests indeed that this is well represented by a linear t
23 Local counterparts of faint blue galaxies 
Some authors eg Lilly et al 1995 Babul  Ferguson 1996 have suggested that starbursting
dwarfs may be the local counterparts of the faint blue galaxies usually found in excess in deep
galaxy counts at redshift of 0710 To verify whether this is a likely possibility one needs to
check if most of the dwarfs have been forming stars at the epochs corresponding to that redshift
hence about 67 Gyr ago and if in case that SF activity was strong enough ie 1 Myr1
to guarantee the observed luminosity levels
We have already mentioned above that all the galaxies examined so far appear to contain stars
as old as the lookback time corresponding to the faint mag limit of the available photometry This
makes it extremely probable that most of them have already been active several billion years ago
The tough question is on the intensity of the SF Van Zee 2001 has very recently surveyed the
SF histories of a large sample of distant isolated dwarf Irrs and concludes that their SF activities
are too modest and it is very unlikely that these systems could signicantly contribute to the faint
blue galaxy excess
This conclusion is inevitably based on integrated properties of these distant objects To obtain
a more quantitative information it is necessary to examine nearby systems where the SF history
can be derived directly from the resolved stellar populations and a more detailed evaluation of the
SF rates at dierent epochs can be performed
3 SF histories from stellar populations
As discussed in the previous sections for a correct approach to study the evolution of Irrs and BCDs
and for several issues of cosmological relevance it is of crucial importance to derive the SF history
of a large number of galaxies of these types The most direct estimate of the epochs and of the
intensities of the SF activities is derivable from the CMDs since their morpholoy is the consequence
of the system evolutionary conditions Fig3 shows a few examples of how the CMD morphology
is aected by the SF history and IMF We thus proposed several years ago Tosi et al 1989 1991
the method of synthetic CMDs to derive from the observational CMDs as much information as
possible taking into account all the incertainties related to both observations and theories Similar
procedures have been developed also by other groups eg Aparicio et al 1996 Tolstoy  Saha
1996 and are now widely applied see also the contributions by Grebel Schulte-Ladbeck Tolstoy
this volume
The numerical procedure creates synthetic CMDs via MonteCarlo extractions on homogeneous
sets of stellar evolution tracks eg the Geneva or the Padova sets of various metallicities tak-
ing into account all the involved theoretical parameters and uncertainties age metallicity IMF
SF law stochastic eects due to small number statistics etc The synthetic CMDs have the
observed number of stars of the examined region and its observational uncertainties photometric
Figure 3 Synthetic CMD of a hypothetical stellar system with 1000 single stars photometrically
resolved Distance modulus m-M0125 reddening EB  V 045 photometric errors and
incompleteness are those derived from observations of a real Galactic open cluster NGC2660
The adopted stellar evolution tracks Bressan et al 1993 have solar metallicity The assumed
starting time backwards from present epoch and duration of the SF activity are labelled in each
panel together with the adopted IMF slope
errors incompleteness factors blending The latter is a very important point which requires a
special accuracy during the photometric analysis A model can be considered satisfactory only if
it reproduces all the features of the observational CMD and luminosity function LF
By comparing all the simulated cases with the empirical CMD and LF we select those which
are more consistent with them and thus derive the number starting epoch duration and intensity
of the SF episodes their IMF the durations of signicant quiescent intervals if any and hints
on the most likely metallicity of the various stellar generations In most if not all the cases the
results are not unique but we can sensibly reduce the range of acceptable values of the various
parameters thus obtaining a good indication on the most likely evolution of the examined region
We have applied the method to Local Group Irrs with ground-based observations and to more
distant late-type dwarfs observed with HST see Table 1 for a summary of the results Fig4 shows
two cases of synthetic CMDs for IZw18 it is apparent that a single recent SF burst cannot account
for the observed red stars both faint and bright and predicts too many too bright objects despite
the rather steep IMF The case with two episodes is instead consistent with the observed features
The most recent application is being performed on the BCD NGC1705 and its preliminary results
are described by Annibali et al this volume Of the 8 dwarfs examined so far by our group only
NGC1569 shows evidence for a very intense and short burst Greggio et al 1998 in addition to
other longer less striking episodes All the others appear to have had a gasping SF regime with
episodes of much more moderate activity None of them shows any evidence for quiescent phases
Figure 4 The case of IZw18 The left panel shows the empirical VVI CMD in the HSTVegamag
system derived from HSTWFPC2 photometry The two middle panels show two cases of synthetic
CMDs with the same number of objects photometric error and incompleteness factors as in the
empirical CMD The left hand case refers to one single burst of SF from 10 Myr ago to the present
epoch with a steep IMF slope 30 The right hand case assumes two SF episodes one from 1
Gyr to 30 Myr ago and the other from 20 Myr to 5 Myr ago with a at IMF slope 15 Finally
the right-hand panel presents the comparison of the LFs corresponding to the two synthetic cases

If we combine the results on the SF history of the late-type dwarfs studied by our group with
those obtained by other groups see eg Grebel 1998 for a comprehensive review of Local Group
galaxies and Schulte-Ladbeck this volume for BCDs outside the Local Group it is apparent that
these galaxies with very few exceptions have had qualitatively similar SF histories Fig5 shows
the SF histories derived in 5 galaxies NGC1569 is the only one which appears to follow the bursting
scheme The data available so far have not allowed yet to accurately derive its earlier activity but
the new HST photometry in the near infrared by Aloisi et al 2001 should allow for a lookback
time of at least a few Gyrs In summary
 Both Irrs and BCDs seem to have a roughly continuous or gasping SF regime with various
episodes of moderate activity and no clear sign of long periods of total inactivity
 Only the few cases of the type of NGC1569 have bursts with SF rates high enough to allow
for the luminosity attributed to faint blue galaxies at redshift 071
 No evidence has been found yet for dwarfs at their rst SF activity
4 Future prospects
From the above presentation it is apparent that further studies on several issues are still required
to obtain a reliable scenario for the evolution of late-type dwarfs In particular the SF histories
and the major characteristics of the gas ows triggered by SN explosions should be examined in
more details For this reason I believe that at present the correct approach to model the chemical
evolution of these systems would be to concentrate on single representative cases rather than to
model the overall features of a large sample of galaxies For the chosen cases I would
