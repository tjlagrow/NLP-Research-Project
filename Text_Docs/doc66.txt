Abstract We propose that the Hawking radiation energy and entropy ow rates
from a black hole can be viewed as a one-dimensional 1D non-equilibrium Landauer
transport process
Support for this viewpoint comes from previous calculations
invoking conformal symmetry in the near-horizon region which give radiation rates
that are identical to those of a single 1D quantum channel connected to a thermal
reservoir at the Hawking temperature The Landauer approach shows in a direct way
the particle statistics independence of the energy and entropy uxes of a black hole
radiating into vacuum as well as one near thermal equilibrium with its environment
As an application of the Landauer approach we show that Hawking radiation gives
a net entropy production that is 50 larger than that obtained assuming standard
three-dimensional emission into vacuum

Non-equilibrium Landauer transport model for Hawking radiation from a black hole
1 Introduction
One of the main achievements of quantum eld theory in curved spacetime is the
verication of the equilibrium thermodynamic description of black hole mechanics 1
In using this formalism 2 3 Hawking was able to provide a physical interpretation
of the black hole temperature through the discovery of particle pair production at the
horizon while also solidifying the connection between black hole entropy and horizon
surface area predicted a few years earlier 4 Subsequently there has been a large body
of work devoted to understanding this thermodynamic description of black holes and its
deeper implications 5 6 7 Yet at the same time the non-equilibrium thermodynamic
properties of black holes namely the steady-state ow or transport of energy and
entropy via Hawking radiation has received markedly less attention 8 9
When viewed by an observer at spatial innity the metric of a non-rotating
uncharged black hole is given by the 13-dimensional Schwarzschild metric Therefore
in the thermodynamic description of black holes it is natural to assume that the emission
of Hawking radiation corresponds to that of a three-dimensional 3D thermal body
obeying the Stefan-Boltzmann law However recently there has been an increasing body
of evidence suggesting that black hole emission is instead a 1D radiative process One
indicator is the well-known near-horizon approximation under which the Schwarzschild
metric of a black hole can be reduced to a 11-dimensional Rindler space possessing
innite-dimensional conformal symmetry 10 The ability to calculate the stress-energy
tensor using conformal symmetry is the basis for standard derivations of the Hawking
ux 11 12 More recently it has been suggested that this conformal symmetry is
responsible for the Hawking eect 13 as it has been shown that this symmetry alone
is sucient to determine both the Hawking thermal spectrum 14 15 and radiation
ux 16 the Hawking radiation is an inherently 11-dimensional process This near-
horizon conformal symmetry also reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking form of the black
hole entropy 17 thus connecting to the other familiar dimensional reduction in black
hole physics namely the holographic principle 6
The rst to focus on the entropic and information implications of a 1D evaporation
process was Bekenstein 18 who proposed that the entropy ow rate from a black
hole is of the same form as that of a 1D quantum channel 19 thus constraining the
information ow from a black hole This same 1D channel description applies in the
context of laboratory analogues of Hawking radiation 20 21 22 and it was noted
that the power output from the analogue Hawking process coincides with the optimal
energy current through a single quantum channel 22 The concept of a 1D quantum
channel was rst considered by Landauer and others 23 24 in the modeling of electrical
transport in mesoscopic circuits The Landauer approach expresses the conductance of
a 1D system Gc in terms of its scattering properties 24 via the relation
1  2
where I is the current through the 1D channel 1 and 2 are the chemical potentials of
Non-equilibrium Landauer transport model for Hawking radiation from a black hole
the channel reservoirs and T is the transmission coecient For perfect transmission
T  1 the channel conductance is given by e2 a value that is independent of the
microscopic material nature of the channel due to the mutual cancellation of the group
velocity and density of states factors entering the current formula in 1D This Landauer
formalism was subsequently extended to describe multiple channels 25 26 as well as
thermal transport 26 27 28 29 30 where the currents are generated by temperature
dierences rather than by chemical potential dierences Quantum mechanics places
upper limits on the energy and entropy currents in 1D channels These upper limits
are attained in the absence of backscattering for bosonic channels 19 31 and are
again independent of the material properties of the channel Furthermore for thermal
transport these upper limits can be independent of whether the particles are bosons or
fermions and thus are termed universal 31 32
Motivated by these connections in this paper we argue that a non-equilibrium
Landauer-transport model can be applied to black hole entropy ow and energy
production rates describing the Hawking eect in terms of currents owing in 1D
quantum channels connecting thermal reservoirs at each end We thus relate the
emission of Hawking radiation of astrophysical black holes to 1D thermal transport in
mesoscopic devices systems that dier by orders of magnitude in energy In particular
we emphasize the conditions under which the 1D currents are independent of particle
statistics In contrast to the emitted power the black hole entropy current cannot be
obtained directly from the stress-energy tensor and is rarely touched on in the literature
without a priori assuming the validity of the 3D Stefan-Boltzmann law 8 9 33
Therefore a theory that is capable of providing both the black hole energy and entropy
currents is required for the correct description of black hole evaporation 34
Assuming the validity of 1D Landauer transport theory enables the description
of certain non-equilibrium steady state emission processes for black holes without
necessarily requiring knowledge of their microscopic physics In essence the Landauer
approach allows us to extend the methodology of applying thermodynamic principles
to black holes 35 Moreover the Landauer model gives a physical insight into the
transport of energy and entropy from a black hole that is lacking in existing eld-
theoretic derivations
This paper is organized as follows
In Sec 2 we review the well-known near-
horizon approximation and the resulting conformal symmetry that leads to the standard
derivation of the stress-energy tensor and the energy ow rate for Hawking radiation
in Sec 3 we introduce the Landauer transport description for 1D quantum
channels and highlight the statistics-independent properties of the energy and entropy
transport in these channels Section 4 establishes the Landauer transport model to the
emission of Hawking radiation for both bosonic and fermionic particles to a black hole
in vacuum Charged and rotating black holes are also addressed As an application of
the 1D Landauer approach In Sec 5 we obtain the net entropy production of a black
hole and compare with the standard 3D calculation given in Ref 33 The special
case of a black hole near thermal equilibrium with its environment is also highlighted

Finally Sec 6 ends with a brief discussion of the results

the horizon excitations and dimensional quantities transverse to the t-x plane are
redshifted and can be ignored 36 ie

is given by 10

where   14M is the surface gravity and the t-x portion of the metric denes the at

where Cu v is the conformal factor Here we ignore the eects of the radial potential
as it is blue-shifted away by the conformal symmetry 13 The regularized expectation

As a model for a single 1D quantum channel we will consider two thermal reservoirs
characterized by the temperatures TL and TR and with chemical potentials R and
L respectively The reservoirs are coupled adiabatically through an eectively 1D
connection supporting the bidirectional propagation of particles The subscripts L and
R denote the left and right thermal reservoirs respectively Here we will assume TL  TR
and that the transport through the 1D-connection is ballistic
Although our focus is on fundamental eldsparticles for complete generality we
will assume interpolating fractional statistics where the distribution function is 39

The emitted power Eq 13 holds for all bosonic quantum channels since the group
velocity and density of states mutually cancel in 1D
The unidirectional power
and the entropy current
are the maximum possible rates for single-channel bosonic ow The unidirectional
entropy current 16 is in fact the maximum possible rate for single-channel fermionic
ow as well ie it is independent of the particle statistics 40 32 To see this we make
a change of integration variables in Eq 12 x  E   kBT  w upon which the
entropy current can be simplied to 32

We can see that the statistics of the particles shows up only in the lower integration
bound of Eq 17 The maximum current 16 is obtained in the degenerate limit where
the statistics-dependence vanishes since LkBTL  0 wg00  0 for bosons
and LkBTL   wg1  0 for fermions However this same statistics
independence in the degenerate limit does not hold for the unidirectional power Eq 11
If one instead considers bidirectional current ow for fermions with R  L and TR  0
then in the degenerate limit one recovers the same maximum rate 15 as for bosons 31
If the maximum energy and entropy current expressions Eqs 15 and 16 respectively
are combined by eliminating TL then one obtains equality for the bound

which holds for 1D quantum channels with arbitrary reservoir temperatures chemical
potentials and particle statistics 19 31 We note in passing that this bound is similar
in form to the conjectured Bekenstein holographic bound 41
4 Hawking radiation from a black hole in vacuum
The Landauer description of Hawking radiation is not limited to 1D but also applies
equally well to the 3D black hole spacetime viewed by an observer at innity There
the entropy and energy ow rates can be characterized by a large ensemble of quantum
channels each labeled by a transverse spatial ie
angular momentum quantum
number with interactions between channels described via a scattering matrix 25
Therefore scattering due to the potential barrier away from the horizon can be
accounted for in the Landauer description through its known multichannel generalization
with the inclusion of intra and inter-channel scattering see eg Ref 26 Although
this seems to suggest that Hawking radiation ows through a vast number of quantum

hole The net energy E

channels the near horizon region where Hawking radiation is emitted and absorbed
is not 3D but rather given by the Rindler metric Eq 3 With only a single spatial
dimension remaining the 11-dimensional conformal symmetry of the metric near
the horizon allows for a single 1D-quantum channel description of the Hawking process
see Fig 1 where the remaining quantum channel corresponds to the lowest possible
angular momentum mode Comparing Eq 13 with Eq 8 we can see immediately
that the Landauer 1D channel formula for the zero chemical potential bosonic power
ow coincides with the Hawking radiation ux where TL  TH and TR  TE  0 with
TE dened to be the temperature of the thermal environment surrounding the black
hole The mutual cancellation of the group velocity and density of states factors in the
1D Landauer formula should make Eq 15 valid not just in at but in arbitrary curved
spacetimes 42 although the conformal symmetry of the near-horizon region suggests
that the production of Hawking radiation is itself essentially a at-space process
Although we have appealed to conformal symmetry these 1D emission properties
of Hawking radiation are evident in the full 3D spacetime as well Following the original
argument of Bekenstein 18 we note that the at spacetime entropy emission rate for a
blackbody in D-dimensions scales with the output power as
SD  cid16 EDcid17DD1
As a result if a black hole were to radiate as a 3D object one should expect the emitted
entropy to scale as the 34 power of the energy ow rate However substitution of the
Non-equilibrium Landauer transport model for Hawking radiation from a black hole
Hawking temperature TH into the Stefan-Boltzmann law and making use of the black
hole surface area A  16GM2c4 one nds that the emitted entropy
goes as the 12 power of the energy rate just as one would expect for a 1D emitter
In fact Eq 20 is identical to Eq 18 up to a numerical factor arising from the
assumption of a 3D as opposed to 1D emitter This result is attributable to the inverse
dependence of the Hawking temperature on the black hole mass M a property of black
holes not shared by other blackbody emitters Therefore the thermodynamic properties
of a black hole correspond to that of a 1D blackbody emitter as one might suspect given
the ability to derive both the Hawking temperature and black hole entropy from the
11-dimensional conformal symmetry in the near horizon region
In what follows we will assume the validity of Eqs 11 and 12 equivalently
Eq 17 in describing the net energy and entropy outow rates respectively
particles radiating from a black hole into the vacuum ie TE  0 With the goal of
introducing the Landauer description of Hawking radiation in the near horizon region
we will ignore scattering due to the radial potential barrier However the full Landauer
approach relating transport to scattering processes 23 24 can incorporate inter-
channel scattering due to particle interactions and back scatter from the radial potential
barrier not considered here
The electrochemical potential of the black hole reservoir is L  BH  q where q
is the electric charge of the eld under consideration and  is the electrostatic potential
corresponding to the charge of the black hole 10 For a Schwarzschild black hole with
  0 and hence BH  0 bosons such as photons and gravitons have maximum
rates given by Eq 15 and 16 with TL  TH For fermions such as neutrinos and
electrons ie
leptons setting BH  0 gives a lower integration limit of wg10  1
in Eq 17 resulting in entropy and energy rates that are reduced by a factor of 12
from the maximum values 16 and 15 This result for the energy rate was established
in earlier calculations for massless fermions 43 and shows up in the relative values of
the conformal and gravitational anomalies 16 However as explicitly pointed out in
Ref 43 the physical reason behind this result could not be established In contrast
the Landauer model presented here shows that these reduced fermionic currents are a
direct consequence of the vanishing chemical potential of a Schwarzschild black hole
and the 1D nature of the emission process Subsequently
it was pointed out 44
that in a 11-dimensional curved spacetime the fermionic eld describing a massless
particle plus its antiparticle is equivalent to a single massless bosonic eld From
the Landauer viewpoint the combined fermionic particleantiparticle single channel
currents can therefore be thought of as a single eective bosonic channel that satises
the maximum rates Eqs 15 and 16 when BH  0 Although leptons are massive
particles the conformal symmetry removes the length scale set by the particle mass
13 the particles are eectively massless In the case of ballistic transport multiple
channels can be treated independently Thus the net Schwarzschild black hole energy
Non-equilibrium Landauer transport model for Hawking radiation from a black hole
and entropy outow rates are bounded by N TH times the single channel rates given by
Eq 15 and Eq 16 respectively a Schwarzschild black hole in vacuum radiates energy
and entropy at the maximum rate allowed by quantum mechanics in 1D saturating the
bound in Eq 18 Here N TH is the total number of eective bosonic channels
spontaneously produced by a black hole at temperature TH a quantity limited by the
number of particle species emitted and their corresponding number of polarizations The
temperature dependence of the eective channel number arises due to the requirement
that kBTH  2mc2 for pair production of particles with mass m
For a black hole with nonzero electrochemical potential
charged parti-
cleantiparticle rates dier so as to cause the black hole net charge to decrease over
time The maximum entropy rate for a single charged fermionic channel coincides with
the maximum rate for a single bosonic channel as shown above giving Eq 16 The ex-
tent to which these maximum rates can be achieved depends on how close to degenerate
is the thermal Hawking reservoir of the black hole for charged particles A special case
is provided by extremal charged black holes 10 satisfying Q2M 2  1 where Q is the
non-dimensional black hole charge In this limit TH  0 giving BHkBTH   the
degenerate limit for fermions Charged fermions then satisfy Eq 16 It may be possible
to reach the degenerate limit for other choices of black hole parameters Similar reason-
ing applies to a black hole with angular momentum where although spherical symmetry
is broken the emission of Hawking radiation is still governed by 11-dimensional con-
formal symmetry 13 Here the U1 gauge symmetry corresponding to the angular
isometry in the 11-dimensional theory may be written as a chemical potential in the
same manner as that of a charged black hole 45 46 Therefore the Landauer model
presented here is quite general being valid for black holes both with or without charge
and angular momentum Finally we point out that the cancellation of the density of
states and group velocity in 1D quantum channels suggests that Eq 15 should also be
valid for black holes in other spacetimes such as BTZ black holes 47 in anti de-Sitter
space where conformal methods may still be applied 48
5 Net entropy production in 11-dimensions
Originally considered by Zurek 33
the rate of net entropy production by a
Schwarzschild black hole due to the emission of Hawking radiation into a thermal
environment neglecting backscattering due to the radial potential barrier 49 is given
where we have used the rst law of thermodynamics dEBH  THdSBH and assumed
energy conservation dE  dEBH For a 3D black hole radiating into a thermal
environment with temperature TE the power and entropy currents are

which gives R3D  43 for a black hole in vacuum TETH  0 33
However as we have shown above the emission properties of a black hole are
better characterized as a 1D Landauer process Therefore we compare the entropy
produced via our 1D model to the standard calculation presented by Zurek Our focus
in this paper is on the near-horizon region and hence we do not include scattering
The conformal symmetry in this region removes any inherent length scales allowing the
scattering barrier to be blue shifted away 13 Moreover it is important to note that
the entropy current Eq 17 like the 1D energy ow Eq 15 should hold for a black
hole in any spacetime where conformal symmetry may be invoked even though the
corresponding scattering properties may be markedly dierent Likewise the Landauer
approach is valid for analogue black hole models 20 21 22 as well as a moving mirror in
11-dimensional spacetime 50 that can reproduce the emission properties of Hawking
radiation from a Schwarzschild black hole in vacuum even though no scattering barrier is
present The eects of any scattering potential can be incorporated into a multichannel
Landauer model 25 26 and for the current case of a Schwarzschild black hole will
be presented elsewhere Since scattering can serve to only increase the net entropy
produced from a Schwarzschild black hole 49 the entropy production rates considered
in this section may be viewed as lower bounds However we note that for 1D transport
scattering will reduce the individual unidirectional energy ELR and entropy currents
SLR Eq 11 and Eq 12 respectively to values below the ballistic bosonic channel
limits Eqs 15 and 16
For comparison in our Landauer model we set E  BH  0 and the net energy
and entropy currents are given by Eqs 13 and 14 respectively The factors of 12
in the fermion rates will drop out when evaluating the ratio Eq 21 The 1D entropy
production ratio is then

which yields a larger value of R1D  2 when radiating into vacuum the net entropy
production by Hawking radiation into vacuum is 50 larger than that of a corresponding
3D thermal body at the Hawking temperature Again this is due to the 1D properties of
the near-horizon region and the emitted radiation for which Eq 24 is no longer valid
The dierence between the 3D and 1D entropy rates Eqs 24 and 25 respectively
for various ratios of TETH is presented in Fig 2 In the case where TH  TE both

that like Landauers original expression Eq 1 relates conductance to transmission
via only fundamental constants From the statistics independence of Eq 16 it follows
that Eq 26 provides a general upper bound on the thermal conductance of a black
hole that is independent of the particle statistics as discussed in 51 52
6 Conclusion
Using the conformal symmetry in the near-horizon region of a black hole we have
presented a 1D Landauer transport model for the non-equilibrium transport of both
energy and entropy ow from a black hole valid for particles with arbitrary statistics
and which claries the independence of the underlying microscopic physics Although
our focus is on the near horizon region the 1D nature of the emission properties are
evident in the full 13-dimensional spacetime seen by an observer at innity and
may be derived from the inverse relationship between black hole mass and Hawking
temperature For a Schwarzschild black hole in vacuum conformal symmetry results
in a Hawking radiation energy ux that is identical to the power owing in a single
1D quantum channel connected to a thermal bath with the Hawking temperature at
one end and zero temperature at the other
Including multiple particle-species and
polarizations a Schwarzschild black hole in vacuum radiates power and entropy at the
optimal rate as a collection of eective bosonic channels This is a direct result of the
Non-equilibrium Landauer transport model for Hawking radiation from a black hole 12
statistics independence of unidirectional energy and entropy ow in 1D highlighted by
the Landauer formalism and has not been discussed previously Furthermore we have
shown that the reduced emission rates for fermions from a Schwarzschild black hole are
due to the absence of a black hole chemical potential giving a physical interpretation
that is lacking in previous derivations Moreover in contrast to eld-theory derivations
using the stress-energy tensor our Landauer model directly yields the entropy current
from a black hole without assuming the validity of the 3D Stefan-Boltzmann law
Both the charge and angular momentum of a black hole may be represented as an
eective black hole chemical potential and can be fully incorporated into the Landauer
description presented here The unidirectional entropy current leads to a statistics
independent heat ow near thermal equilibrium characterized by the quantum of thermal
conductance Again this property of black hole transport has not been addressed earlier
In addition the energy and entropy currents in 1D give a Hawking radiation entropy
production ratio that is twice the corresponding value lost by the black hole when
radiating into vacuum a 50 higher value when compared to the currently accepted
3D blackbody rate These results are a direct consequence of the reduced dimensionality
in the near-horizon region and its conformal symmetry Given the intimate connection
between entropy and information the present ndings in particular Eq 18 place strict
limits on the rate of information transfer into and out of a black hole 53 and therefore
will play a role in addressing the information loss problem in black hole evaporation
54 55 However we note that the reliance on conformal symmetry means that the
Landauer model in its present form is incapable of describing non-thermal Hawking
spectrum transport properties required for unitary black hole evaporation 56 57
