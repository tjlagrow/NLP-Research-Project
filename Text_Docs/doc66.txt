Abstract We review recent scientic results from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer with special
emphasis on star formation in nearby resolved galaxies
INTRODUCTION
The Satellite
The Galaxy Evolution Explorer GALEX is a NASA Small Explorer class mission It
consists of a 50 cm-diameter modied Ritchey-Chrtien telescope with four operating
modes Far-UV FUV and Near-UV NUV imaging and FUV and NUV spectroscopy
The telescope has a 3-m focal length and has Al-MgF2 coatings The eld of view is 12
circular An optics wheel can position a CaF2 imaging window a CaF2 transmission
grism or a fully opaque mask in the beam Spectroscopic observations are obtained
at multiple grism-sky dispersion angles so as to mitigate spectral overlap effects The
FUV 1528 1344-1786 and NUV 2271 1771-2831 imagers can be operated
one at a time or simultaneously using a dichroic beam splitter The detector system
encorporates sealed-tube microchannel-plate detectors The FUV detector is preceded
by a blue-edge lter that blocks the night-side airglow lines of OI1304 1356 and Lya 
The NUV detector is preceded by a red blocking lterfold mirror which produces a
sharper long-wavelength cutoff than the detector CsTe photocathode and thereby reduces
both zodiacal light background and optical contamination The peak quantum efciency
of the detector is 12 FUV and 8 NUV The detectors are linear up to a local
stellar count-rate of 100 FUV 400 NUV cps which corresponds to mAB  14 15
The resolution of the system is typically 4560 FUVNUV arcseconds FWHM and
varies by 20 over the eld of view Further detail about the mission in general
and the performance of the satellite in specic can be found in Martin et al 6 and
Morrissey et al 7 respectively The mission is nominally expected to last 38 months
GALEX was launched into a 700 km 29 inclination circular orbit on 28 April 2003

The Prime Mission
GALEX is currently undertaking the rst space UV sky-survey including both imag-
ing and grism surveys The prime mission includes an all-sky imaging survey AIS
75-95 of the observable sky subject to bright-star and diffuse Galactic background
light limits mAB  205 a medium imaging survey MIS of 1000 deg2mAB  23
a deep imaging survey DIS of 100 square degrees mAB  25 and a nearby galaxy
survey NGS Spectroscopic slitless grism surveys R100-200 are also being under-
taken with various depths and sky coverage Many of the GALEX elds overlap existing
andor planned groundbased and space-based surveys being undertaken in other bands
All-sky Imaging Survey AIS The goal of the AIS is to survey the entire sky subject
to a sensitivity of mAB  205 comparable to the POSS II mAB21 mag and SDSS
spectroscopic mAB176 mag limits Several hundred to 1000 objects are in each
1 deg2 eld The AIS is performed in roughly ten 100-second pointed exposures per
eclipse 10 deg2 per eclipse
Medium Imaging Survey MIS The MIS covers 1000 deg2 with extensive overlap
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey MIS exposures are a single eclipse typically 1500
seconds with sensitivity mAB  23 net several thousand objects and are well-matched
to SDSS photometric limits
Bianchi et al 1 have made the rst characterization of the objects detected in
the GALEX AIS and DIS surveys by cross-comparing objects already discovered and
classied on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in regions of overlap Emphasis was put
on discovering quasars and for the 75 and 92 square degrees studied in the MIS and
AIS overlap with SDSS they report 1736 and 222 z  2 QSO candidates for the two
GALEX survey depths respectively This signicantly increases the number of fainter
candidates and moderately augments the candidate list for brighter objects
Deep Imaging Survey DIS The DIS consists of 20 orbit 30 ksec mAB  25
exposures over 80 deg2 located in regions where major multiwavelength efforts are
already underway DIS regions have low extinction low zodiacal and diffuse galactic
backgrounds contiguous pointings of 10 deg2
to obtain large cosmic volumes and
minimal bright stars An Ultra DIS of 200 ksec mAB  26 mag is also in progress in
four elds
Nearby Galaxies Survey NGS The NGS targets well-resolved nearby galaxies for
1-2 eclipses Surface brightness limits are mAB 275 mag arcsec2 The 200 targets are
a diverse selection of galaxy types and environments and include most galaxies from
the Spitzer IR Nearby Galaxy Survey SINGS Figure 1 shows the NGS observation of
the M81M82 system
Spectroscopic Surveys The suite of spectroscopic surveys includes 1 the Wide-
eld Spectroscopic Survey WSS which covers the full 80 deg2 DIS footprint with
comparable exposure time 30 ksec and reaches mAB  20 mag for SN10 spectra 2
the Medium Spectroscopic Survey MSS which covers the high priority central eld in
each DIS survey region total 8 deg2 to mAB215-230 mag using 300 ksec exposures
and 3 Deep Spectroscopic Survey DSS covering 2 deg2 with 1000 eclipses to a
depth o f mAB23-24 mag
NEARBY GALAXY SURVEY NGS
NGC 0253 and M82
In a study of the complex of ultraviolet laments in the starburst-driven halos of NGC
0253 and M82 Hoopes et al 5 concluded that the UV luminosities in the halo are too
high to be provided by continuum and line emission from shock-heated or photoionized
gas except perhaps in the brightest laments in M82 This suggests that most of the
UV light is the stellar continuum of the starburst scattered into our line of sight by dust
in the outow This interpretation agrees with previous results from optical imaging
polarimetry in M82 The observed luminosity of the halo UV light is  01 of the
bolometric luminosity of the starburst The morphology of the UV laments in both
galaxies shows a high degree of spatial correlation with Ha and X-ray emission which
indicates that these outows contain cold gas and dust some of which may be vented
into the intergalactic medium IGM UV light is seen in the  Ha cap 11 kpc north of
M82 If this cap is a result of the wind uid running into a pre-existing gas cloud the
gas cloud contains dust and is not primordial in nature but was probably stripped from
M82 or M81 Figure 2 If starburst winds efciently expel dust into the IGM this could
have signicant consequences for the observation of cosmologically distant objects
FIGURE 1 GALEX Composite NUVFUV Image of M81 bottom and M82 top Note the verey
different morphology of M82 as compared to its optical image The scattering of light by dust ejected
by the starburst is especially prominent in the blue light detected by GALEX On the other hand the
bulge of M81 is almost invisible in the GALEX bands leaving only the complex array of star-forming
laments detailing the spiral structure of this galaxy The irregular object to the east of M81 is Holmberg
IX Another interacting galaxy in the M81-M82 system NGC 3077 is outside the eld of view to the east
and may never be imaged by GALEX because of a nearby bright star
M31 M32 and M33 Radial Gradients
For M31 and M33 Figures 3  4 respectively Thilker et al 13 have determined the
UV radial light and color proles and compared them with the distribution of ionized
gas as traced by Ha emission It is found that the extent of the UV emission in both

pointings in this case 9 images to cover the main body of the galaxy and part of its halo Both M32
and NGC 205 are visible in this image but because of their intrinsically red population they are not as
conspicuous as they are in the visible
targets is greater than the extent of the observed HII regions and diffuse ionized gas
In addition the ultraviolet diffuse fraction in M33 using the FUV observations has been
compared to the Ha diffuse fraction obtained from wide-eld narrow-band imaging
The FUV diffuse fraction appears to be remarkably constant near 065 over a large
range in galactocentric radius with departures to higher values in circumnuclear regions
and most notably at the limit of the Ha disk The authors suggest that the increase
in FUV diffuse fraction at large galactocentric radii could indicate that a substantial
FIGURE 3 GALEX Montage of M33 A single pointing of GALEX is capable of imaging almost
the entire main body of M33 Because M33 has only a faint background population of old red stars its
morphology in the UV is not too dissimilar to its appearance at the optical wavelengths The primary
difference being the contrast of the arms with respect to the disk
portion of the diffuse emission beyond this point is not generated in situ but rather it is
scattered from dust after originating in the vicinity of the disks outermost HII regions
A radial variation of the Ha diffuse fraction was also measured in general the Ha
diffuse fraction is near 04 but it rises up to 06 toward the galaxy center
For M32 the high-surface-brightness elliptical companion to the Andromeda galaxy
Gil de Paz et al 12 have undertaken a detailed analysis of its UV light and color
prole Early studies of the UV properties of this galaxy rst by OConnell et al 9
FIGURE 4
In Gil de Paz et al 12 the luminosity proles and color gradients have been derived for
the compact elliptical galaxy M32 a nearby companion to Andromeda The left panel shows that there
is only a very slight color gradient in this galaxy which begins only in its outer regions if at all Surface
photometry of this galaxy is especially difcult given that it is projected on the complex background
of spiral structure in M31 The right-hand panel shows the divergence of photometry based on earlier
photographic photometry circles and the GALEX observations triangles
and then by Ohl et al 10 cast some doubt on M32 as being a truly typical elliptical
galaxy Based on UIT Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope data it was claimed that M32 had
a strong FUV-optical color gradient but that it was inverted negative with respect to the
gradients observed in the vast majority of other elliptical galaxies If true M32 would
be extremely anomalous The imaging data for M32 had to be carefully decomposed
so as to properly account for the complicated background contamination by the disk of
M31 The results are shown in Figure 5 where it can be seen that M32 has a very modest
positive color gradient making M32 fully consistent in its UV properties as compared
to those observed in luminous ellipticals
M83 Extinction and Extended UV Disks
Boissier et al 3 used FUV and NUV images of M83 to compute the radial prole
of the UV spectral slope disk They briey present a model of its chemical evolution
which allows them to obtain realistic intrinsic properties of the stellar populations Using
corollary data they also compute the proles of Ha  Hb and of the total IR TIR
to FUV ratio Both data and model are used to estimate and compare the extinction
gradients at the FUV wavelength obtained from these various indicators They discuss
the implications for the determination of the star formation rate
Thilker et al 14 have discovered an extensive sample of UV-bright stellar complexes
in the extreme outer disk of M83 Figure 6 extending four to ve times the radius where
the majority of H II regions are detected RHII  51 arcmin or 66 kpc These sources
are typically associated with large-scale lamentary H I structures in the warped outer

disk of M83 and are distributed beyond the galactocentric radii at which molecular ISM
has yet been detected It is of interest that only a subset of the outer disk UV sources
have corresponding H II regions detected in Ha
imaging consistent with a sample of
mixed age in which a few sources are a few Myr old and the majority is much more
evolved  108 yr
FIGURE 6 GALEX Imaging of M83 The grey-scale background image of M83 is derived from a
combination of the FUV and NUV GALEX data The contours correspond to the HI distribution published
by Tilanus  Allen 1993 extend out to the limits of the image 44 arcmin diameter which corresponds
to a physical extent of about 60 kpc at the distance of M83 the inner disk of M83 as dened by its inner
high-surface-brightness disk HII regions is about 5 times smaller from Thilker et al 14
M101 UV Leakage and Recent Star Formation
A comparative study of the spatial distribution of UV and far-infrared uxes across
the disk of M 101 has been undertaken by Popescu et al 11 By comparing total UV
emission from both GALEX bands with total far-infrared FIR ux from ISOPHOT 60
100 and 170 m m they discovered a very strong correspondence of the FIRUV ratio
with galactocentric radius Figure 7 The ratio decreases monotonically from values
FIGURE 7 The pixel values of the FIRUV ratio map of M101 at the resolution of the 170 m m image
versus the galactocentric radius The dots are for lines of sight towards interarm regions and the diamonds
are towards the spiral arm regions The solid line is an offset exponential t to the data Adapted from
Popescu et al 11
somewhat in excess of 3 near the nucleus to values near zero in the outer regions of
the galaxy This they attribute to a large-scale distribution of diffuse dust decreasing in
optical depth with radius and dominating over the more localized variations in opacity
occurring between the arm and interarm regions They also nd a tendency for the
FIRUV ratio at a given radius to take on higher values in the regions of diffuse
interarm emission and lower values in the spiral-arm regions This is interpreted both
in terms of the escape probability of UV photons from spiral arms and their subsequent
scattering in the interarm regions and in terms of the larger relative contribution of
optical photons to the heating of the dust in the interarm regions
Another trend with galactocentric radius in M101 and M51 is reported and discussed
by Bianchi et al 2 Using GALEX and SDSS photometry of compact stellar clusters in
M101 they have used population synthesis models to derive ages reddenings luminosi-
ties and currentinitial masses A galactocentric gradient in the FUVNUV color index
suggests younger clusters are preferentially found in the outer parts of the disks with
M101 showing the more pronounced gradient as compared to M51 The radial proles
in FUVNUV for other galaxies M31 M33 and M83 show the same trend however
the magnitude of the effect is variable from galaxy to galaxy
Interacting Galaxies and Tidal tails
Neff et al 8 report the detection of signicant FUV and NUV emission from stellar
substructures within the tidal tails of four on-going galaxy mergers ARP 157 ARP
295 NGC 571319 and NGC 776971 The UV-bright regions are optically faint and
are coincident with HI density enhancements FUV emission is detected at any location
where the HI surface density exceeds  2 M pc2 and is often detected in the absence
of any visible wavelength emission One example of UV tails and bridges taken from
their paper is shown in Figure 8 UV luminosities of the brighter regions of the tidal tails
imply masses of 106M up to  109M in young stars in the tails and HI luminosities
imply similar HI masses UV-optical colors of the tidal tails indicate stellar populations
as young as a few Myr and in all cases ages  400Myr Most of the young stars in
the tails formed in single bursts rather than resulting from continuous star formation
and they formed in situ as the tails evolved Star formation appears to be older near the
parent galaxies and younger at increasing distances from the parent galaxy The youngest
stellar concentrations usually near the ends of long tidal tails have masses comparable
to conrmed tidal dwarf galaxies and may be newly forming galaxies undergoing their
rst burst of star formation
A more detailed study of GALEX observations of an interacting galaxy the Anten-
nae has been undertaken by Hibbard et al 4 The tidal UV morphology seen there is
remarkably similar to the tidal neutral hydrogen gas with a close correspondence be-
tween regions of bright UV emission and high HI column density There are interesting
features in the UV morphology of the inner regions The FUV light in the south-western
half of the disk of NGC 4039 is sharply truncated coincident with a similar truncation
in the HI disk This gas may have been removed by the X-ray loops recently imaged in
this system by Chandra inhibiting subsequent star formation On a larger scale there
is a FUV halo possibly related to shocked gas in the X-ray halo
While it has long been known that tails are generally blue the GALEX observation
provide color baselines to determine how much of the UV radiation comes from stars
younger than the dynamical age of the tails The preliminary analysis by Hibbard et al
4 suggests that most of the stars within the tidal tails pre-date the tail formation period
The population in the northern tail appears older than that in the southern tail Examining
individual UV -bright regions within the tails they nd regions of more recent star
formation which occur at regions of higher HI column density and extend well beyond
the previously identied tail star forming regions Such tails are providing promising
laboratories for the study of star formation outside of the usual disk environment and
thereby testing general theories of star and cluster formation
FIGURE 8 An example of the tidal tails discussed in Neff et al 8 In this case the interacting system
Arp 295 nicely illustrates the UV clumps tails and bridges being found by GALEX in the outer regions
of merging systems
