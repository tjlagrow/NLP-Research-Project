Stellar archeology a cosmological view of dSphs
Stefania Salvadori
Abstract The origin of dwarf spheroidal galaxies dSphs is investigated in a global
cosmological context by simultaneously following the evolution of the Galaxy and
its dwarf satellites This approach enable to study the formation of dSphs in their
proper birth environment and to reconstruct their own merging histories The pro-
posed picture simultaneously accounts for several dSph and Milky Way properties
including the Metallicity Distribution Functions of metal-poor stars The observed
features are interpreted in terms of physical processes acting at high redshifts
1 Cosmological background
Today living metal-poor stars represent the fossil records of the early cosmic star
formation Indeed they are expected to form at high redshifts as soon as the metal
and dust content of the gas was high enough Z  Zcr  1041Z 16 to trigger
the formation of low-mass stars which can survive until the present days Extremely
metal-poor stars FeH 3 have been observed in the Milky Way MW halo
since long time ago 12 However the most promising objects to host these elu-
sive stellar population are expected to be dwarf spheroidal galaxies dSphs that are
metal-poor and old stellar systems all of them showing the presence of a stellar
population  10 Gyr old despite of very different star formation histories
Recently extremely metal-poor stars have been observed in nearby dSph galax-
ies 20 However while FeH 3 stars represents the 25 of the total stellar
mass in ultra-faint dwarfs UFs L  105L they are extremely rare in the more
luminous classical dSph galaxies  6 19 How did ultra-faint and classical
dSphs form More recently high-resolution spectroscopic studies 4 5 9 11 20
have shown that despite of this difference in number the abundance patterns of

FeH 3 stars is mainly consistent in these two class of galaxies Hence what is
the origin of extremely metal-poor stars
In this contribution I will present a possible cosmological scenario for the origin
of dSphs by investigating the formation of these galaxies along the build-up of the
Milky Way Other than simultaneously accounting for several dSphs and MW prop-
erties the model will allow us to physically explain the above mentioned features
pertaining to extremely metal-poor stars
2 Star formation  feedback processes at high redshifts
The most relevant properties of the model can be summarized in few points for an
exhaustive description see 13 and 15 A statistical signicant sample of possi-
ble MW hierarchical merger histories is rst reconstructed by using a Monte Carlo
algorithm 13 based on the Extended Press  Schecter theory 1 Hence the evo-
lution of gas and stars is followed along the hierarchical trees by assuming that in
each halo the star formation SF rate is proportional to the mass of cold gas whose
gradual accretion is regulated by a numerically calibrated infall rate 14

Additional hypothesis are required in order to include the effects of radiative feed-
back at high redshifts inuencing both the minimum halo mass required to form
stars Ms f z and the SF efciency of the star forming objects Indeed the gradual
reionization of the MW environment completed by zrei suppress the SF in progres-
sively more massive haloes The evolution of Ms f z adopted here Fig1 accounts
for this effect and assume zrei  6 On the other hand UV photons in the Lyman-
Werner band can easily photodissociate H2 molecules which represent the only
cooling agents of Tvir  104 K minihaloes We then assume that the SF efciency
of these objects is reduced by a factor 1  Tvir2  104K31 with respect to
more massive H-cooling haloes 15
By including the effects of mechanical feedback driven by supernovae SN en-
ergy deposition we only include the effect of SN type II 14 we follow self-
consistently the chemical evolution of the gas in both the proto-galaxies and in the
MW environment Fig2 ie the medium out of which the haloes virialize and ac-
crete gas The SF and the SN wind efciencies are calibrated to simultaneously
reproduce 13 the global properties of the MW stellargas mass and metallicity
and the Metallicity Distribution Function of Galactic halo stars 17
3 The birth environment
DSph candidates are selected among the star forming haloes M  Ms f z which
are likely to become satellites ie those corresponding to density uctuations  2s
3 Their total dark matter mass formation redshift and initial baryonic fraction
 fb with respect to the cosmic value fc  W bW m  0156 are shown in Fig 1
see 15 for more details Note that according to this picture the hosting haloes of
dSph galaxies are expected to form when z  105 In Fig 2 the metallicity evolution
of the MW environment is shown We can note that the scatter is very big at high
redshifts reecting the dispersion among different hierarchical merger histories and
that the average iron-abundance rapidly increases at decreasing redshifts reaching
FeH 4 when z  15 This implies that the MW satellites form out of a birth
environment that is naturally pre-enriched due to SN explosions along the build-up
of the Galaxy 14
4 Mass and formation epochs
In Fig 3 the observed and simulated Iron-Luminosity relations are compared The
faint end of the relation L  106L is predominantly populated by Tvir  104 K
minihaloes in which the SF is strongly reduced due to ineffective molecular hy-
drogen cooling Sec 2 Above that luminosity H-cooling haloes dominates We
then infer that ultra-faint dSphs are the living fossils of star forming minihaloes As
these objects virialize when z  75 and have total masses M  1078M Fig 1

we conclude that ultra-faint dwarfs are the oldest and the more dark matter domi-
nated ML  100 dSphs in the MW system 15 On the contrary classical dSph
galaxies are associated to more massive H-cooling haloes which more efciently
cool down their gas and assembled at later times Sculptor-like dSphs for example
have total masses M  1085M and nally form when z  65 Can we nd the
imprints of such a different origin in the observed properties of dSphs
5 Metallicity Distribution Functions
Lets compare the average MDF of ultra-faint and Sculptor-like candidates with
the observational data Fig 4 The agreement is quite good thus allowing us to
interpret the different MDF shapes in terms of physical mechanisms According
to our results the width of the MDFs reects the cooling-efciency of the gas
ultra-faint dwarfs have a broader distribution because of the extremely low SF rate
 001Myr caused by ineffective H2-cooling Few supernovae explode in these
galaxies which therefore slowly enrich and eject their gas Sculptor-like dSphs in-
stead reach high SF values  01M yr at their nal assembling epoch thus
experiencing a rapid metal enrichment along with a strong gas ejection 14 The

fraction fb at the formation epoch with respect to the cosmic value as in Fig 1 the color version
is available in 15 Points with error bars are the observational data collected by 8
pronounced peak of the MDF and the prompt decrease for FeH 15 reect
these features 14
On the other hand the shift of the ultra-faint MDF towards lower FeH values is
a result of the lower metallicity of the MW environment at their higher formation
epochs Indeed UFs form at z  85 when pre-enrichment of the MW environment
was FeH 35 while Sculptor-like dSphs nally assembled at later times when
FeH 3 14 Note however that the model predicts a small FeH 3 tail in
the Sculptor MDF 15 that now has been conrmed by the new results of the DART
team 19 What is then the origin of these extremely metal-poor stars
6 Merging and star formation histories
We can answer to this question by analyzing the star formation history of a typical
Sculptor-like dSph Fig 5 which exhibits several bursts of different intensity and
duration The highest peak corresponds to the SF activity at the nal assembling
epoch z  65 Mechanical feedback is so efcient at that time because of the
high SF rate that the galaxy blow out the entire gas reservoir in few hundred of
Myr thus suddenly stopping the SF Fresh gas returned by evolved stars is grad-

occurs 14 However the rates are extremely low SF  00005Myr because of
the paucity of returned gas and only a few percent of the total stellar mass is formed
during this phase At earlier times t t f orm  05 Gyr instead the peaks reect the
star formation and merging activity of the Sculptor progenitor haloes We nd that
the oldest progenitors are minihaloes that form stars at very high redshifts z  9 and
with typical SF rates  002Myr The extremely metal-poor stars that populate the
lowest metallicity tail of the Sculptor MDF formed in these objects and hence have
the same origin of those found in ultra-faint galaxies
7 Conclusions
Stellar archeology of the most metal-poor stars may provide fundamental insights on
the early cosmic star formation In particular the properties of the observed Metal-

licity Distribution Functions in nearby dSph galaxies can be used to constrain the
origin of these Galactic satellites and to study the physical processes occurring at
high redshifts Ultra Faint dSphs are expected to be the today-living counterpart of
high redshift H2-cooling minihaloes M  1078M which are very ineffectively
SF objects turning into stars  3 of the potentially available cosmic baryons 15
This result is consistent with recent complementary studies 2 10 that use simula-
tions to investigate the origin of dSphs and account for the luminosity function of
the MW satellites
According to our picture the higher fraction of FeH 3 stars in ultra-faint with
respect to classical dSphs reects both the lower SF rate caused by ineffective H2
cooling both the lower metal pre-enrichment of the MW-environment at their fur-
ther formation epoch Classical dSphs indeed are expected to be associated with
massive H-cooling haloes M  108M that more efciently cool-down their gas
and that form at later times z  75 through merging of many progenitor haloes Al-
though extremely rare FeH 3 stars are expected to populate all classical dSphs
Indeed these stars are expected to mainly form at high redshifts in H2-cooling mini-
haloes that at later times naturally assemble in more massive dSphs These ndings
can explain both the detection of FeH 3 stars in nearby classical dSphs 20
and the existence of an old stellar population in all of them 21
