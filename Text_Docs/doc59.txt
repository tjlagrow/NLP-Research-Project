INTRODUCTION  
Natural  Language  Processing  NLP  is  an  area  of  research 
and  application  that  explores  how  computers  can  be  used  to 
understand and manipulate natural language text or speech to 
do  useful  things  The  Origin  of  Natural  Language  Processing  
lie  in  a  number  of  disciplines  such  as  computer  and 
information  sciences  linguistics  mathematics  electrical  and 
electronic  engineering  artificial  intelligence  and  robotics 
psychology  etc  Machine  translation  is  one  of  the  major 
application area  under language  processing  The  ideal aim of 
machine  translation  systems  is  to  produce  the  best  possible 
translation without human aid The structural order might vary 
from language to language During the translation of English-
Tamil the structural order might be a difficult task because the 
order of words may affect the original meaning of a sentence 
In  order  to  translate  correct  interpretation  of  a  sentence  the 
word structure order is very  essential The syntactic rules are 
used  to  predict  the  correct  sentence  translation  based  on  the 
target  language  structure  and  these  are  also  used  to  improve 
the  optimization  of 
translation  process  The  machine 
translation requires the parsed output to be translated Parsing 
gives the structural analysis of the sentence There exist tools 
like  Stanford  parser  which  gives  the  dependency  information 
about  the  sentence  But  the  tool  gives  the  dependency 
structure only for the English There are no such efficient tools 
for  the Tamil  language  Dependency  parsing  suits  the  best to 
get the structural information about the sentence  
Dependency  parsing  is  a  very  useful  tool  in  the  sentence 
structure  identification  For  languages  like  English  it  can  be 
easily  told  that  the  sentence  structure  is  in  the  form  of  SVO 
Subject  Verb  Object  Though  the  sentence  structure  for  the 
Tamil is SOV Subject Object Verb form it is not necessary 
that the sentences should follow the same format as the target 
language  Generally  Tamil  language  can  accept  to  write  the 
sentence  in  any  pattern  because  Tamil  sentence  structure  is 
changed  then  the  exact  meaning  of  the  sentence  also  is 
changed  So  in  these  cases  of  free  word  order  language 
dependency parsing gives the correct sentence structure  
The  clause  boundary  identification  is  a  vital  task  in 
language generation and understanding Parsing gives the best 
way to solve the clause  boundary identification If the source 
sentence length is too long it can be split based on the clauses 
which  make  the  translation  very  easy  The  clauses  in  the 
sentences  may  be  joined  using  the  connectives  or  the  clauses 
may  be  embedded  within  the  other  clauses  Sometimes  the 
two clauses are separated only by commas in those cases the 
translation  is  easy  Identifying  the  clauses  in  the  sentences 
itself becomes a complex task Dependency parsing gives the 
information about the relation extraction as how the words in 
the  sentence  are  related  and  what  type  of  relationship  exists 
between the words in the sentence So considering the various 
uses of the parsing an efficient tool needs to be developed  
In proposed work a hybrid approach is proposed that uses 
both techniques  ie rule  based  and  machine  learning  to  build 
an identifier for different clause boundaries of Tamil language 
The POS tagger and Chunker are used to prepare the parts of 
speech and chunked tagged data as the inputs where linguistic 
rules are taken as features The rest of the paper is organized 
as  follows  the  related  works  are  discussed  in  section  2  and 
framework  and  proposed  algorithm  presented  in  section  3 
implementation  methodology 
in  section  4  experimental 
results  and  discussion  are  reported  in  section  5  and  followed 
by concluding remarks 
II  RELATED WORK 
The  researchers  are  reported  the  different  levels  of 
accuracy  as  result The results  may  not  fulfill  the  scenario of 
users  need  various  dependency  parsing  works  has  been 
experimented  for  different  languages  Some  of  the  work  has 
been focused as follows 
The  Tamil  Shallow  Parser  was  developed  using  the  new 
and  state  of  the  art  machine  learning  approach  1  The 
Shallow  Parser  system  developed  for  Tamil  is  an  important 
tool  for  Machine  Translation  between  Tamil  and  other 
languages A shallow parsing approach is compared with PP-
attachment 2 with a state of the art full parser It is used a flat 
representation  of  prepositional  phrases  and  their  associated 
attachment  sites  to  train  a  machine  learner  for  the  PP 
attachment task A memory-based approach can obtain results 
for the PP attachment task comparable to a state-of-the art full 
parser A phrase structured Treebank has been developed with 
326  Tamil  sentences  which  covers  more  than  5000  words A 
hybrid  language  model  has  been  trained  with  the  phrase 
structured Treebank using immediate head parsing technique 
Lexicalized  and  statistical  parser  which  employs  this  hybrid 
language  model  and  immediate  head  parsing  technique  gives 
better results than pure grammar and trigram based model 3  
The  data-driven  dependency  parsing  4  have  shown  that 
the distribution of parsing errors are correlated with theoretical 
properties of the models used for learning and inference This 
experimental  results  show  that  both  models  consistently 
improve  their  accuracy  when  given  access 
to  features 
generated  by  the  other  model  which  leads  to  a  significant 
advancement of the state of the art in data-driven dependency 
parsing The clause markers play the role to detect the type of 
sub-ordinate  clause  which  is  with  or  within  the  main  clause 
Limitation  with  CRFs  is  that  it  is  highly  dependent  on 
linguistic  rules  Missing  of  these  rules  may  lead  to  wrongly 
classified data 5  
III  FRAME WORK OF DEPENDENCY TAMIL 
PARSER 
The  implementation  of  dependency  parsing  involves  a 
sequence of several steps  
Fig 1 Framework of Dependency Parser 
The  input  sentence  is  initially  be  tokenized  the tokenized 
words are sent it to the pos tagger to get the grammatical label 
of  each  data  It  is  the  process  of  automatically  assigning  the 
label  based  on  the  grammatical  category  or  lexical  class  to 
language  processing 
each  and  every  word  in  a  sentence  It  is  considered  to  be 
important  process  in  speech  synthesis  speech  recognition 
natural 
retrieval  and 
machine  translation  etc  During  POS  tagging  there  is  a 
possibility for ambiguity because the same word has different 
meaning  in  different  contexts  It  includes  verbs  nouns 
adjectives  adverbs  and  determiner  and  so  on  The  Fig  2 
represents the Parts of speech tagging 
information 
Fig 2 POS Tagging 
agglutinative 
Some of the words are formed in untagged The untagged 
words are passed to the morphological analyzer to get the root 
word  with  appropriate  tagged  data  Tamil  language  is 
morphologically 
morphologically  rich  language  needs  deep  analysis  on  the 
word  level  to  capture  the  meaning  of  the  word  from  its 
morphemes  and  its  categories  Each  root  is  affixed  with 
several  morphemes  to  generate  a  word  In  general  Tamil 
language  is  postpositionally  inflected  to  the  root  word  The 
Fig 3 represents the Morphological analysis of each untagged 
word  in  the  parts  of  speech  Tamil  is  one  of  the  classical 
Indian  languages  which  has  very  strong  linguistic  base  with 
well defined set of morpho syntactic rules Generally suffixes 
are used to mark class numerals and cases attached to noun or 
verb root 
Fig 3 Morphological Analyzer 
Tamil is one of the classical Indian languages which 
has very strong linguistic base with well defined set of morpho 
syntactic  rules  Generally  suffixes  are  used  to  mark  class 
numerals and cases attached to noun or verb root 
 Chunking  is  an  efficient  and  robust  method  for 
identifying  short  phrases  in  text  or  chunks  Chunking  is 
considered  as  an  intermediate  step  towards  full  parsing  A 
chunker  finds  adjacent  non-overlapping  spans  of  related 
tokens and groups them together into chunks Chunkers often 
operate  on  tagged  texts  and  use  the  tags  to  make  chunking 
decisions  A  subsequent  step  after  tagging  focuses  on  the 
identification  of  basic  structural  relations  between  groups  of 
words  This  is  usually  referred  to  as  phrase  chunking  It 
segments  of  a  sentence  with  syntactic  constituents  such  as 
noun or verb phrase NP or VP Each word is assigned only 
one unique tag often encoded as a begin-chunk eg B-NP or 
inside-chunk tag eg INP and outside-chunk tageg ONP  
There  is  no  standard  sentence  structure  for  tamil 
language    The  sentence  structure  are  obtained  based  on  this 
grammar rules  
NP - Det Adj N PP 
VP - V NP PP Adv 
PP - P NP 
ADJP - CRD ADJ 
ADVP - ADV INT CRD 
NP -   NP conj NP 
S  -  NP VP 
The tagged sentence is passed to the chunker process this 
is used to get the chunked data The Fig 4 represents the group 
the words in the sentence 
Fig 4 Chunking 
At present the words includes the pos tag and chunk tag of 
each word  
Dependency  parsing  assigns  head-dependent  relations 
between  the  words  in  a  sentence  Whenever  two  words  are 
connected  by  a  dependency  relation  that  one  of  them  is  the 
head  and  the  other  is  the  dependent  and  that  there  is  a  link 
connecting  them  In  general  the  dependent  is  in  the  form  of 
modifier object or complement The head plays the larger role 
in  determining  the  behavior  of  the  pair  In  our  dependency 
representation  the  source  of  the  edge  represents  the  modifier 
and  destination  points  to  the  head  word  Fig  5  represents 
dependency relationship between words in the sentence Here 
is the root word and it is the head of the other words 
And the remaining word indicates dependent on head 
Fig 5 Dependency Relationship structure

This project mainly focused to create a parser tool based on 
word  
The  Dependency  Parsing  assigns  head-dependency 
relations  between  them  The  Root  word  of  the  tree  is 
are  dependent  on  root 
priority 
word  The  result  of  dependency  priority  is  to  directly  to 
make  a  manual  tree  structure  of  a  sentence  In  a 
computational way the tree viewer is used to bring manual 
tree  and  to  remake  the  computationally  graphics  structure 
of  a  words  in  a  sentence  This  resultant  tree  format  is 
useful to identify the grammatical relationship of the words 
and also to make doing further research in a language The 
Following Fig 7 illustrates the Parse Tree structure

Conditional Random Field 
The CRF techniques as modeling in the learning phase and 
inference  in  the  classification  CRF  uses  the  conditional 
probability  P  label  sequence  y    observation  sequence  x 
rather than the joint probability Py x as in case of HMM It 
specifies  the  probability  of  possible  label  sequences  y  for  a 
given  observation  sequence  x  CRF  allows  arbitrary  non-
independent features on x while HMM does not Probability of 
transitions  between  labels  may  depend  on  past  and  future 
observations  This  technique  has  two  phases  for  clause 
boundary identification 
1 Learning Given a sample set X containing features X1 
  Xn  along with the set of values for hidden labels Y ie 
clause  boundariesY1      Yn    learn  the  best  possible    
potential functions 
2  Inference  For  a  given  word  there  is  some  new 
observable  x  find the  most  likely  clause  boundary  y    for  x 
ie compute exactly or approximately 
In this CRF technique linguistic rules are used as  features 
for  which  different  length  of  windows  comprises  of  words 
are formed that depend on these linguistic rules For example 
in  case  of  relative  clause  identification  in  Tamil  language 
clause beginning and ending are identified via rule1 and rule2 
respectively 
RULE1  
If the current word is any relative clause marker and next 
word  is  any  of  the  POS  tags  verb  pronoun  adjective  noun 
then the next word is marked as beginning of clause boundary 
as shown below 
Position 0 Relative clause marker 
Position 1 Verb or Adjective or noun or pronoun 
Then  0  should  be  marked  as  beginning  of  subordinate 
clause of type relative Where position 0 indicates the current 
word and position 1 is the next word 
RULE2 
If the current word is any  verb auxiliary and next word is 
any  symbol  then  current  word  is  end  of  corresponding 
subordinate clause boundary as shown below 
Position 0 Verb phrase or Verb auxiliary 
Position 1 any symbol or phrase 
Then  0  should  be  marked  as  end  of  above  subordinate 
clause 
V  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The  Proposed  frame  work  and  algorithm  is  experimented 
with 150 sentences of text from  the news papers and articles 
All the sentences are used for training In order to evaluate the 
system  we  applied  150  test  sentences  in  that  120  sentences 
are correctly parsed Moreover Precision and Recall of words 
are  widely  used  metrics  to  evaluate  the  efficiency  of 
dependency  relation  between  the  words  in  the  sentences 
Precision  is  the  percentage  of  generated  words  that  are 
actually correct The recall stands for the percentage of words 
that are generated and that are actually found in the reference 
translation  F-Measure  is  the  harmonic  mean  of  recall  and 
precision

VI CONCLUSION 
In  this  paper  Conditional  Random  Fields  are  used  for 
classification  of  clause  boundary  beginning  and  ending  and 
also  identify  the  type  of  subordinate  clause  Limitation  with 
CRFs is that it is highly dependent on linguistic rules Missing 
of  these  rules  may  lead  to  wrongly  classified  data  An 
improvement can be achieved in this proposed clause markers 
for  different  subordinate  clauses  and  also  for  those  clauses 
which are embedded in the main clause The proposed model 
will  give  good  accuracy  for  all  the  sentences  if  the  training 
data  is  increased  More  complex  sentence  structures  can  be 
added to the training data Also the sentence in passive voice 
can be added to get good results

accuracy  as  result The results  may  not  fulfill  the  scenario of 
users  need  various  dependency  parsing  works  has  been 
experimented  for  different  languages  Some  of  the  work  has 
been focused as follows 
The  Tamil  Shallow  Parser  was  developed  using  the  new 
and  state  of  the  art  machine  learning  approach  1  The 
Shallow  Parser  system  developed  for  Tamil  is  an  important 
tool  for  Machine  Translation  between  Tamil  and  other 
languages A shallow parsing approach is compared with PP-
attachment 2 with a state of the art full parser It is used a flat 
representation  of  prepositional  phrases  and  their  associated 
attachment  sites  to  train  a  machine  learner  for  the  PP 
attachment task A memory-based approach can obtain results 
for the PP attachment task comparable to a state-of-the art full 
parser A phrase structured Treebank has been developed with 
326  Tamil  sentences  which  covers  more  than  5000  words A 
hybrid  language  model  has  been  trained  with  the  phrase 
structured Treebank using immediate head parsing technique 
Lexicalized  and  statistical  parser  which  employs  this  hybrid 
language  model  and  immediate  head  parsing  technique  gives 
better results than pure grammar and trigram based model 3  
The  data-driven  dependency  parsing  4  have  shown  that 
the distribution of parsing errors are correlated with theoretical 
properties of the models used for learning and inference This 
experimental  results  show  that  both  models  consistently 
improve  their  accuracy  when  given  access 
to  features 
generated  by  the  other  model  which  leads  to  a  significant 
advancement of the state of the art in data-driven dependency 
parsing The clause markers play the role to detect the type of 
sub-ordinate  clause  which  is  with  or  within  the  main  clause 
Limitation  with  CRFs  is  that  it  is  highly  dependent  on 
linguistic  rules  Missing  of  these  rules  may  lead  to  wrongly 
classified data 5  
III  FRAME WORK OF DEPENDENCY TAMIL 
PARSER 
The  implementation  of  dependency  parsing  involves  a 
sequence of several steps  
Fig 1 Framework of Dependency Parser 
The  input  sentence  is  initially  be  tokenized  the tokenized 
words are sent it to the pos tagger to get the grammatical label 
of  each  data  It  is  the  process  of  automatically  assigning  the 
label  based  on  the  grammatical  category  or  lexical  class  to 
language  processing 
each  and  every  word  in  a  sentence  It  is  considered  to  be 
important  process  in  speech  synthesis  speech  recognition 
natural 
retrieval  and 
machine  translation  etc  During  POS  tagging  there  is  a 
possibility for ambiguity because the same word has different 
meaning  in  different  contexts  It  includes  verbs  nouns 
adjectives  adverbs  and  determiner  and  so  on  The  Fig  2 
represents the Parts of speech tagging 
information 
Fig 2 POS Tagging 
agglutinative 
Some of the words are formed in untagged The untagged 
words are passed to the morphological analyzer to get the root 
word  with  appropriate  tagged  data  Tamil  language  is 
morphologically 
morphologically  rich  language  needs  deep  analysis  on  the 
word  level  to  capture  the  meaning  of  the  word  from  its 
morphemes  and  its  categories  Each  root  is  affixed  with 
several  morphemes  to  generate  a  word  In  general  Tamil 
language  is  postpositionally  inflected  to  the  root  word  The 
Fig 3 represents the Morphological analysis of each untagged 
word  in  the  parts  of  speech  Tamil  is  one  of  the  classical 
Indian  languages  which  has  very  strong  linguistic  base  with 
well defined set of morpho syntactic rules Generally suffixes 
are used to mark class numerals and cases attached to noun or 
verb root 
Fig 3 Morphological Analyzer 
Tamil is one of the classical Indian languages which 
has very strong linguistic base with well defined set of morpho 
syntactic  rules  Generally  suffixes  are  used  to  mark  class 
numerals and cases attached to noun or verb root 
 Chunking  is  an  efficient  and  robust  method  for 
identifying  short  phrases  in  text  or  chunks  Chunking  is 
considered  as  an  intermediate  step  towards  full  parsing  A 
chunker  finds  adjacent  non-overlapping  spans  of  related 
tokens and groups them together into chunks Chunkers often 
operate  on  tagged  texts  and  use  the  tags  to  make  chunking 
decisions  A  subsequent  step  after  tagging  focuses  on  the 
identification  of  basic  structural  relations  between  groups  of 
words  This  is  usually  referred  to  as  phrase  chunking  It 
segments  of  a  sentence  with  syntactic  constituents  such  as 
noun or verb phrase NP or VP Each word is assigned only 
one unique tag often encoded as a begin-chunk eg B-NP or 
inside-chunk tag eg INP and outside-chunk tageg ONP  
There  is  no  standard  sentence  structure  for  tamil 
language    The  sentence  structure  are  obtained  based  on  this 
grammar rules  
NP - Det Adj N PP 
VP - V NP PP Adv 
PP - P NP 
ADJP - CRD ADJ 
ADVP - ADV INT CRD 
NP -   NP conj NP 
S  -  NP VP 
The tagged sentence is passed to the chunker process this 
is used to get the chunked data The Fig 4 represents the group 
the words in the sentence 
Fig 4 Chunking 
At present the words includes the pos tag and chunk tag of 
each word  
Dependency  parsing  assigns  head-dependent  relations 
between  the  words  in  a  sentence  Whenever  two  words  are 
connected  by  a  dependency  relation  that  one  of  them  is  the 
head  and  the  other  is  the  dependent  and  that  there  is  a  link 
connecting  them  In  general  the  dependent  is  in  the  form  of 
modifier object or complement The head plays the larger role 
in  determining  the  behavior  of  the  pair  In  our  dependency 
representation  the  source  of  the  edge  represents  the  modifier 
and  destination  points  to  the  head  word  Fig  5  represents 
dependency relationship between words in the sentence Here 
is the root word and it is the head of the other words 
And the remaining word indicates dependent on head

This project mainly focused to create a parser tool based on 
word  
The  Dependency  Parsing  assigns  head-dependency 
relations  between  them  The  Root  word  of  the  tree  is 
are  dependent  on  root 
priority 
word  The  result  of  dependency  priority  is  to  directly  to 
make  a  manual  tree  structure  of  a  sentence  In  a 
computational way the tree viewer is used to bring manual 
tree  and  to  remake  the  computationally  graphics  structure 
of  a  words  in  a  sentence  This  resultant  tree  format  is 
useful to identify the grammatical relationship of the words 
and also to make doing further research in a language The 
Following Fig 7 illustrates the Parse Tree structure

Conditional Random Field 
The CRF techniques as modeling in the learning phase and 
inference  in  the  classification  CRF  uses  the  conditional 
probability  P  label  sequence  y    observation  sequence  x 
rather than the joint probability Py x as in case of HMM It 
specifies  the  probability  of  possible  label  sequences  y  for  a 
given  observation  sequence  x  CRF  allows  arbitrary  non-
independent features on x while HMM does not Probability of 
transitions  between  labels  may  depend  on  past  and  future 
observations  This  technique  has  two  phases  for  clause 
boundary identification 
1 Learning Given a sample set X containing features X1 
  Xn  along with the set of values for hidden labels Y ie 
clause  boundariesY1      Yn    learn  the  best  possible    
potential functions 
2  Inference  For  a  given  word  there  is  some  new 
observable  x  find the  most  likely  clause  boundary  y    for  x 
ie compute exactly or approximately 
In this CRF technique linguistic rules are used as  features 
for  which  different  length  of  windows  comprises  of  words 
are formed that depend on these linguistic rules For example 
in  case  of  relative  clause  identification  in  Tamil  language 
clause beginning and ending are identified via rule1 and rule2 
respectively 
RULE1  
If the current word is any relative clause marker and next 
word  is  any  of  the  POS  tags  verb  pronoun  adjective  noun 
then the next word is marked as beginning of clause boundary 
as shown below 
Position 0 Relative clause marker 
Position 1 Verb or Adjective or noun or pronoun 
Then  0  should  be  marked  as  beginning  of  subordinate 
clause of type relative Where position 0 indicates the current 
word and position 1 is the next word 
RULE2 
If the current word is any  verb auxiliary and next word is 
any  symbol  then  current  word  is  end  of  corresponding 
subordinate clause boundary as shown below 
Position 0 Verb phrase or Verb auxiliary 
Position 1 any symbol or phrase 
Then  0  should  be  marked  as  end  of  above  subordinate 
clause 
V  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The  Proposed  frame  work  and  algorithm  is  experimented 
with 150 sentences of text from  the news papers and articles 
All the sentences are used for training In order to evaluate the 
system  we  applied  150  test  sentences  in  that  120  sentences 
are correctly parsed Moreover Precision and Recall of words 
are  widely  used  metrics  to  evaluate  the  efficiency  of 
dependency  relation  between  the  words  in  the  sentences 
Precision  is  the  percentage  of  generated  words  that  are 
actually correct The recall stands for the percentage of words 
that are generated and that are actually found in the reference 
translation  F-Measure  is  the  harmonic  mean  of  recall  and 
precision

VI CONCLUSION 
In  this  paper  Conditional  Random  Fields  are  used  for 
classification  of  clause  boundary  beginning  and  ending  and 
also  identify  the  type  of  subordinate  clause  Limitation  with 
CRFs is that it is highly dependent on linguistic rules Missing 
of  these  rules  may  lead  to  wrongly  classified  data  An 
improvement can be achieved in this proposed clause markers 
for  different  subordinate  clauses  and  also  for  those  clauses 
which are embedded in the main clause The proposed model 
will  give  good  accuracy  for  all  the  sentences  if  the  training 
data  is  increased  More  complex  sentence  structures  can  be 
added to the training data Also the sentence in passive voice 
can be added to get good results
