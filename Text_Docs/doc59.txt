Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis FIP is associated with mutations in the feline coronavirus FCoV genome 
that are thought to convert the subclinical feline enteric coronavirus FECV into the lethal feline infectious 
peritonitis virus FIPV A key feature of FIPV not shared with FECV is the productive infection of macrophages 
Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell tropism such as the spike glycoprotein may play an important 
role in FIP progression  In a prior study involving a limited number of samples we have shown an association of 
FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation site located between the receptor-binding and fusion 
domains of the FCoV spike S1S2 Here we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and to obtain a 
more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1S2 site Our larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations 
acquired by FIPV at S1S2 are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease cleavage-activation 
site located in the fusion domain S2 adjacent to the viral fusion peptide Overall our data indicate a pattern of 
mutations across the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions andor altered recognition of 
critical basicpolar amino acid residues needed for virus activation in the enteric tract Typically FIPVs have 
substitutions of non-polar aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites These changes likely 
modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its ability to productively infect macrophages in vivo 
been identified and there is no definitive diagnostic test 
for FIP except through post-mortem histopathological 
Feline infectious peritonitis FIP is a fatal infection of 
analysis by immunocytochemistry 
cats caused by a feline coronavirus FCoV 11 FCoV 
In addition to the two different biotypes FECV and 
infections are common especially in high-density 
housing  situations  such  as  animal  shelters  and 
FIPV  two  FCoV  serotypes  have  been 
identified 
breeding facilities  There are two biotypes of FCoV 
Serotype 1 FCoVs are highly prevalent clinically 3 14 
33 but do not propagate in cell culture and are 
classified as either feline enteric coronavirus FECV or 
feline infectious peritonitis virus FIPV The biotypes 
therefore studied less often than serotype 2 FCoVs 
differ based on the severity of infection in cats 
which are easily propagated in vitro but not as clinically 
Typically the FECV biotype of FCoV transmits readily 
prevalent In this study we chose to study FECV and 
FIPV from serotype I FCoV  
via the fecal-oral route infects enterocytes in the 
gastrointestinal tract of cats and causes only a mild 
The FCoV genome is approximately 29 kB with 11 open 
infection If the viral infection worsens and becomes 
reading frames encoding replication structural and 
systemic and lethal then the virus is classified as the 
accessory proteins 15 Like other RNA viruses 
FIPV biotype Symptoms associated with the FIPV

leakage andor pleural and peritoneal effusion The

current understanding is that FIPV arises during in vivo 
suggested that mutations in the spike protein S 3c 
infection due to genetic mutations of FECV 13 23 26 
andor 7b genes are associated with the transition of

proteases to be able to mediate cell entry Mutation of 
the proteolytic cleavage sites can have profound 
implications for disease progression 4 16 and 
therefore we sought to determine whether mutations 
at protease cleavage sites are evident in the FIPV 
biotype  
Proteases cleave their substrates though recognition of 
specific amino acid motifs within the relative position 
designation  P6--P1    P1--P6  where  cleavage 
occurs at the P1 position adjacent to the P1 position 
27 In this paper we will denote the cleavage site 
between P1 and P1 using the vertical bar  symbol 
For a typical serine protease like trypsin there is a 
strong requirement for a basic amino acid Arg or Lys 
at the P1 cleavage position Substrate residues flanking 
P1 can also have major impacts on the rate and 
specificity of cleavage for a given protease in the case 
of influenza the addition of argininelysine residues 
upstream of the P1 residue the polybasic region of 
the viral HA can allow an alternate protease called furin 
to cleave HA and increase the virulence of this virus 
25  
Until recently FCoVs were thought to use uncleaved S 
proteins to enter cells However a functional furin 
cleavage site has been identified in two examples of 
serotype 1 FECVs located at the boundary of the S1 
and S2 subunits 9 Furin is a ubiquitous proprotein 
convertase PC enriched in the trans-Golgi network 
and is well conserved among mammals 32 Furin 
cleaves a wide range of protein precursors into 
biologically active products at a consensus motif that is 
often defined as R-X-KR-R where R is the basic 
arginine residue X is any residue and K is the basic 
lysine residue 35 The minimum requirement for 
furin cleavage is for a P1 and P4 arginine In addition to 
the P1-P4 arginines these residues are often flanked by 
serine residues and promoted by the presence of a 
basic residue at P2 The general cleavage requirement 
for a PC enzyme is defined as cleavage at paired basic 
residues B-X2n-B where the intermediate residues -
X2n- consist of 0 2 or 4 amino acids 32 
For many enveloped viruses protease cleavage occurs 
adjacent to the fusion peptide site which is located at 
the boundary of the receptor-binding and fusion 
domains of the envelope protein For coronaviruses the 
fusion peptide is located within the fusion domains in 
close proximity to second processing site denoted as 
S2 The actual proteases that cleave at this site are 
currently unknown but may include members of the 
cathepsin family that function in endosomes and 
lysosomes Mutations at the S2 cleavage site could be

important and therefore we have chosen to study this 
site in addition to the S1S2 cleavage site In this work 
we used an approach to studying FIP that complements 
and extends previous work We focused on sequence 
analysis of the two cleavage-activation sites of the 
spike gene S1S2 and S2 which are functionally 
relevant regions for virus entry and infection To obtain 
FECV gene samples fecal material from healthy cats 
that carried FCoV was sequenced for the S gene These 
gene samples were operationally defined as being from 
the FECV biotype and 56 FECV samples were obtained 
in this study To obtain FIPV samples tissue and body 
fluid samples were collected from cats that were 
diagnosed with FIP For tissue samples cats were 
typically euthanized based on a clinical diagnosis of 
FIP and samples were collected post-euthanasia In 
many cases a diagnosis of FIP was reconfirmed by 
immunohistochemistry  IHC  of 
from 
the 
euthanized cats but not all samples were examined by 
IHC 
for 
logistical  reasons  Viral  gene  sequences 
obtained from FIP cats were operationally defined as 
being from the FIPV biotype In this study 84 FIPV 
samples were sequenced from 39 cats and various 
organs and tissues Samples from our previous study 
19 were also included to provide as complete a data 
set as possible and we compared our data to those of a 
separate study by Chang  et  al 6 Our studies were 
consistent with the hypothesis that mutations in both 
the S1S2 and S2 protease cleavage sites were present 
in FIPV samples  
FCoV  sample  acquisition  and  sequence  analysis Fecal 
samples from subclinically infected cats and tissue 
samples from cats with a clinical diagnosis of FIP were 
solicited from shelters breeders and veterinarians 
throughout the United States To initially confirm 
samples were FCoV-positive RNA was extracted using

FCoV primers that detect most circulating strains were 
used to screen all fecal samples using the procedure 
outlined by Herrewegh and coworkers 12 RNA

strain was used as positive control Fresh tissue 
samples from FIP-diagnosed cats were harvested and 
RNA samples were extracted using MagMAX Express

Visual  Representation  of  Mutation  Data     To visualize 
the biochemical changes in the protease cleavage sites 
of the S protein we developed a specialized scatter plot 
through MATLAB MathWorks Natick MA A separate 
plot  was  made 
for  each  residue  position  being 
evaluated and the Van der Waals VdW volume of 
amino acids 29 was plotted against their hydropathy 
index HPI 18 In general amino acids with lower 
HPI are more hydrophilic whereas those with higher 
HPI  are  more  hydrophobic  Each  data  point 
corresponds to an amino acid that was found at the 
residue position being evaluated and the size of the 
data point scales with the frequency of occurrence of 
that amino acid within a data set We caution here that 
the data point size does not denote an error range in 
VdW volume or HPI Other important properties of the 
amino acids were portrayed by color-coding the data 
points as such polar positive blue HKR polar 
negative red DE polar neutral green STNQ 
nonpolar aliphatic gray AVLIM nonpolar aromatic 
magenta FWY unique brown PG and disulfide 
bond-forming cyan C  
The amino acid sequence motifs for the S1S2 and S2 
regions are shown in Table 1  For the S1S2 site the 
previously recognized motif -R-R-SA-R-R-S- 19 was 
again found to be highly conserved There was a limited 
variability in the P5 position with Arg substituted for 
Gly 1 cat and Lys 1 cat The functional relevance of 
this variation is unclear though the P5 position is not 
generally considered to be highly important for furin 
cleavage There was also a single case with a change in 
the P3 position with SerAla substituted for Val 1 cat 
As with P5 the type of amino acid residue at the P3 
position is not functionally critical for furin cleavage 
Based on the expanded dataset available from this

the  high 
lysine  with 
study we also noted a high degree of conservation at 
the  P6  cleavage  position  which  can  be  highly 
important for furin cleavage All samples contained a 
polar uncharged residue S T or Q at the P6 position 
Overall the expanded data set reinforces the notion 
that the S1S2 motif is cleaved by furin Based on the 
data from this study we consider to following as an 
FECV motif at the S1S2 position -STQ-R-R-SA-R-
R-S- At the S2 site the conserved nature of the FCoV fusion 
peptide SAVEDLLF was readily apparent along with 
the expected conserved arginine residue in the P1 
cleavage position Table 1 All FECV samples tested 
contained  a  P2 
level  of 
conservation implicating this as a functionally critical 
residue The P1 residue S was also 100 conserved 
consistent with a role in protease cleavage as well as in 
fusion peptide function Overall we found an invariant 
motif -K-R-S- at the S2 position of FECV and the 
dibasic nature of this site is consistent with cleavage by 
a range of proteases including non-furin PCs and 
cathepsin B 
The amino acid sequence motifs for the S1S2 and S2 
regions in the FCoV spike gene amplified from various 
tissues and body fluid samples are shown in Table 2 
For S1S2 the FECV motif -STQ-R-R-SA-R-R-S- was 
disrupted in the vast majority of samples In addition 
the S2 FECV -K-R-S- motif was disrupted in many 
samples Fecal material from FIP cats is shown in Table 
3 with sequences very similar to FECV samples 
For S1S2 we focused our analysis on the core 
residues for furin cleavage ie the P1 P1 P2 and P4 
residues The most frequent substitution was at the P1 
position where 11 cats displayed a change of Arg for 
Gly 4 cats Met 4 cats Trp 2 cats Thr 1 cat and 
Ser 1 cat The next most frequent substitution was at 
the P2 position where 10 cats displayed a change of 
Arg for Leu 6 cats Pro 3 cats Ser 1 cat and His 1 
cat Five cats had a substitution at the P4 position 
which displayed a change of Arg for Thr 2 cats Gly 1 
cat Ser 1 cat and Met 1 cat Four cats had a 
substitution at the P1 position which displayed a 
change of Ser for Ala 2 cats Pro 1 cat Gly 1 cat 
and Leu 1 cat  All of these changes in the core 
residues would be expected to be highly functionally 
significant for furin cleavage 
At the S2 the conserved nature of the fusion peptide 
SAVEDLLF was again readily apparent along with an 
invariant Ser at the P1 position Table 2 While most 
Mutations in feline coronavirus spike protein cleavage-activation sites in cats with FIP 
FIPV cats contained a P1 arginine three cats had 
substitutions for Ser This change would be expected to 
be highly functionally significant for protease cleavage 
There were more substitutions in the P2 residue with 
five cats displaying a change of Lys for Met 3 cats and 
Glu 2 cats These changes would also be expected to 
be highly functionally significant for protease cleavage 
The overall switch in the dibasic nature of the S2 site 
in some cats is consistent with a change in the 
proteases cleaving at this position 
For the core residues at S1S2 and S2 31 out of 39 FIP 
cats 77 had samples that were modified from the 
FECV  consensus  -STQ--R-R-SA-R-R-S-  Healthy 
cats showed no deviation from the core motif 
The P6 P5 and P3 residues within the S1S2 site - 
STQ--R-R-SA-R-R-S- were defined as non-core 
residues as these are likely to be less functionally 
relevant for furin cleavage Of these residues P6 likely 
impacts furin cleavage the most For the P6 position 
five cats displayed a change of SerThrGln for Pro 2 
cats Phe 1 cats Ala 1 cat and Leu 1 cat All of 
these changes would be expected to be functionally 
significant for furin cleavage  
Including S1S2 P6 as a core residue revealed that 33 
out of 39 FIP cats 85 had samples that were 
modified from the FECV consensus -STQ-R-R-SA-R-
R-S- Healthy cats showed no deviation from a core 
motif including P6 
For the non-core S1S2 P5 position nine cats displayed 
a change of Arg for Lys 8 cats as seen for FECV For 
the non-core S1S2 P3 position two cats displayed a 
change of SerAla for Met 1 cats and Thr 1 cat The 
significance of these changes is uncertain The S2 non-
core P1 residue showed no deviation in either FIP or 
healthy cats 
Including both core and non-core residues at S1S2 
and S2 we found that 3739 FIP cats 95 had 
mutations compared to healthy cats 9 of healthy cats 
showed a mutation within the non-core residues 
It is noteworthy that many cats had multiple changes 
across the two proteolytic cleavage sites and while 
there was a wide variety of different substitutions 
present in different cats sampling of multiple tissues 
within  an 
individual  cat  eg  cat197  revealed 
relatively limited variation It is also noteworthy that 
most  of  our  samples  would  be  expected  to  be 
comprised of end-stage viruses where cats have 
more obvious clinical signs of FIP It will be interesting 
to track cats that might be in an early possibly sub-
clinical phase of FIP These cats may harbor viruses 
Comparison to a separate study Chang et al 2012 
and to database sequences 
that have different mutations to end-stage viruses 
sampled here in particular in the non-core residues 
While a prediction of the proteases coming into play for 
FIPV is quite uncertain the trend in our data is for the 
replacement of critical basic residues and serine with 
more hydrophobic residues a pattern consistent with 
cleavage by an alternative proteases Such proteases 
may include cathepsins 8 or matrix metalloproteases 
MMPs 17 MMPs are known to be highly expressed 
on macrophages 2 and to our knowledge MMP-
mediated cleavage of a viral envelope protein would be 
unique situation for a virus entry pathway Both MMPs 
and cathepsin demonstrate relatively broad substrate 
specificity in line with the range of mutations seen in 
the cleavage sites of FIPVs 
The data generated during the course of our study was 
compared to that generated by a separate study Chang 
et  al 2012 6 as well as to additional database 
sequences Table 4 For S1S2 of the ten FECV 
sequences in Chang  et  al the -QRS-R-R-SA-R-R-S- 
motif was preserved with one exception where one cat 
had a P6 Pro residue All core residues were identical 
to our study A P6 Pro was also found in one other 
database sequence The pattern of residues in FIPV 
samples 
the  same  general  pattern  as 
described for our study ie introduction of non-polar 
aliphatic  or  aromatic  residues 
the  protease 
recognition sites  Of the eleven FIP cats samples in 
Chang et al 2012 four had P1 substitutions G W and 
S two had P1 substitutions L and P two had P4 
substitutions G and S and three had P6 substitutions 
L and P Of seven database samples three had P1 
substitutions G W and S two had P1 substitutions 
P one had P4 substitutions Q and five had P6 
substitutions A and P 
At S2 Chang et al 2012 show some limited changes of 
the invariant KRS motif for FECV with different P2 
residues in four cats substituted with Arg 3 cats and 
Thr 1 cat Cats with FIP showed an introduction of a 
hydrophobic reside at P2 in five cases with Lys being 
substituted for Met 4 cats and Val 1 cat A similar 
trend  was  present 
in  database  samples  with 
introduction of Val Ala and Gln in three individual 
cases 
Overall we consider that the data from Chang  et  al 
2012 as well as other database sequences are in 
strong agreement with the data from this study 1011

Finding a mutation pattern that could explain the 
transformation of FECV to FIPV is challenging because 
amino acids have multiple properties that are similar 
or dissimilar with each other such as molecular size 
hydrophobicity  and  charge 
In  order 
to 
simultaneously 
to  multiple 
visualize 
biochemical properties we developed a specialized 
scatter plot through MATLAB that shows the Van der 
Waals volume Y-axis hydropathy index X-axis 
frequency of occurrence data point size and unique 
property color code of amino acids found at the 
cleavage site positions The resulting plots are shown 
in Figure 1 for the residues at the S1S2 and S2 
cleavage sites for both the FECV and FIPV samples  
Compared  to  FECV  FIPV  contains  the 
following 
changes in the S1S2 cleavage site P6 and P1 mutates 
from polar neutral residues to nonpolar residues P4 
and P2 mutates from arginine to smaller and more 
hydrophobic residues and P1 mutates from arginine to 
more hydrophobic residues At the S2 cleavage site 
FIPV contains the following mutations P2 mutates 
from positively charged lysine to either negatively 
charged glutamate or uncharged methionine and P1 
mutates from positively charged arginine to polar 
neutral serine that is half the volume of arginine In 
summary the visualization of biochemical changes at 
the cleavage sites using our plotting method can greatly 
aid  with  the 
identification  of  mutation  patterns 
associated with FIP 
We believe that our study will be of benefit in the 
diagnosis of FIP in cats by detecting mutations in S 
protein cleavage site that mimic those found in FIPV 
However the pattern of variant viruses seen in FIP cats 
is complex We consider that the tracking of the ten 
amino acids that comprise the cleavage sites of FCoV 
spike -STQ-R-R-SA-R-R-S- from S1S2 and -K-R-S- 
from S2 with respect to the biochemical parameters 
of size hydrophobicity and charge can be used to 
predict the likelihood of FIP in cats To simplify the 
detection of FIPV-like mutations one could potentially 
use the changes in these biochemical parameters in 
conjunction with a ranking of the core and non-core 
residues to arrive at a FIP diagnostic score Such a 
scoring system could help clinicians identify which cats 
are 
likely  to  develop  FIP  without  the  need  to 
functionally investigate every mutation found The use 
Potential use of this study for diagnosis of FIP in cats 
Mutations in feline coronavirus spike protein cleavage-activation sites in cats with FIP 
of this scoring metric for samples that clinicians can 
easily  access  eg  blood  would  be  helpful 
for 
diagnosing FIP early and quickly While our current 
study only utilized a limited number of blood samples 
mutations consistent with a FIPV biotype were seen in 
all positive samples However it is known that FCoV 
can be present in the blood monocytes of healthy cats 
without necessarily leading to FIP 10 12 28 Further 
investigation into the spike protein cleavage site 
changes in blood samples of both healthy and FIP cats 
will form a future focus of this study 
We considered that fecal samples from FIP cats were 
likely to be contaminated with an ongoing infection 
with FECV and so not discriminatory for FIP This was 
in  this  study 
confirmed  as  the  FIP  cats  tested 
continued to shed FECV-like viruses based on the 
highly limited sequence variation observed at the spike 
cleavage sites Table 3  
FIP exists in two clinical manifestations wet and dry 
21 As in our previous study 19 we found no 
correlation between sequence alterations at the spike 
cleavage sites between wet and dry FIP cats These 
differences in clinical presentation are likely to be due 
to immunological factors in individual cats rather than 
differences in the cleavage-activation of the viruses 
infecting these cats 
The use of the techniques reported here for serotype I 
FCoVs may also be applied to serotype II FCoVs 
however these viruses lack an equivalent S1S2 motif 
Investigation of predictive changes in the S2 region of 
serotype II FCoVs is currently ongoing
