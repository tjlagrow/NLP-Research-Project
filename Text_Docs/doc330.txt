ABSTRACT
We analyse the Fundamental Plane FP of 26 strong gravitational lens galaxies
with redshifts up to z  1 using tabulated data from Kochanek et al 2000 and
Rusin et al 2003 The lens galaxies eectively form a mass-selected sample of early-
type galaxies in environments of relatively low density We analyse the FP and its
evolution in the restframe Johnson B and Gunn r bands Assuming that early-type
galaxies are a homologous family the FP then provides a direct measurement of the
ML ratio evolution
If we assume that the ML ratios of eld early-type galaxies evolve as power-
laws we nd for the lens galaxies an evolution rate d logMLdz of 062  013 in
restframe B and 047  011 in restframe Gunn r for a at cosmology with M  03
and   07 For a Salpeter 1955 Initial Mass Function and Solar metallicity these
results correspond to mean stellar formation redshifts of hzi  1814

which is not signicantly dierent from that found for the lens galaxies However if
we impose the constraint that lens and cluster galaxies that are of the same age have
equal ML ratios and we do not correct for progenitor bias the dierence is signicant
and we nd that the stellar populations of the lens galaxies are 1015  younger than
those of the cluster galaxies
We nd that both the ML ratios as well as the restframe colors of the lens galaxies
show signicant scatter About half of the lens galaxies are consistent with an old
cluster-like stellar populations but the other galaxies are bluer and best t by single
burst models with younger stellar formation redshifts as low as z  1 Moreover
the scatter in color is correlated with the scatter in ML ratio We interpret this
as evidence of a signicant age spread among the stellar populations of lens galaxies
whereas the ages of the stellar populations of the cluster galaxies are well approximated
by a single formation epoch

INTRODUCTION
One of the central problems in astronomy is that of galaxy
formation and evolution when were the visible parts of
galaxies assembled and when were the stars formed The
merging of galaxies leads to changes in their masses and
stellar evolution changes their luminosities The evolution

of the mass-to-light ML ratio relates the mass and lumi-
nosity evolution
Galaxy mass measurements are notoriously dicult
Fortunately empirical relations such as the Tully-Fisher re-
lation for spiral galaxies Tully  Fisher 1977 and the Fun-
damental Plane FP for early-type galaxies Dressler et al
1987 Djorgovski  Davis 1987 can provide us with infor-
mation on the masses and mass evolution of galaxies The
FP is a tight relation between the structural parameters and
velocity dispersion which under the assumption of homol-
van de Ven van Dokkum  Franx
ogy implies that ML  M
4 with low scatter Faber et al
Due to stellar evolution the ML ratio of a stellar pop-
ulation changes with redshift and hence also the FP will
change The redshift evolution of the intercept of the FP is
proportional to the evolution of the mean ML ratio Hence
the tightness of the FP relation makes it a very sensitive
indicator of the mean age of the stellar population of early-
type galaxies van Dokkum  Franx 1996
For cluster galaxies the ML ratio evolves very slowly
indicating that the stars were formed at redshifts z  3 eg
Kelson et al 1997 Bender et al 1998 van Dokkum et al
1998 Current semi-analytical hierarchical models place the
assembly time of typical early-type galaxies at much lower
redshifts eg Kaumann 1996 Kaumann  Charlot 1998
Diaferio et al 2001 However in hierarchical galaxy forma-
tion models the assembly time and star formation epoch are
strongly dependent on the environment with cluster early-
type galaxies forming much earlier than those in the general
eld eg Kaumann 1996 Hence cluster early-type galax-
ies do not provide the most stringent tests of these models
Moreover the measured evolution of early-type galaxies may
underestimate the true evolution because of the eects of
morphological evolution If many early-type galaxies evolved
from late-type galaxies at z  1 the sample of early-type
galaxies at high redshift is only a subset of all progenitors
of present-day early-type galaxies This would lead us to
underestimate the luminosity evolution and hence overes-
timate the stellar formation redshift see van Dokkum 
Franx 2001 hereafter vDF01
Recent studies have started to explore the FP and ML
ratios of high redshift early-type galaxies in the general eld
Interestingly the FP of eld early-type galaxies appears to
be quite similar to that of cluster early-type galaxies out
to z  055 Treu et al 2001 van Dokkum et al 2001 in
apparent conict with current semi-analytical models see
van Dokkum et al 2001 However there are indications for
a signicant oset between the two populations at higher
redshift Treu et al 2002
Kochanek et al 2000 hereafter K00 analysed the FP
and color evolution of strong gravitational lens galaxies up
to z  1 The lensing cross section is dominated by galaxies
with high central velocity dispersions and the lens galax-
ies eectively provide a mass-selected sample of eld early-
type galaxies which can be compared to optically selected
samples of eld and cluster galaxies The mass-selection is
important because it limits Malmquist-type biases and it is
much less sensitive to selection eects caused by morpholog-
ical evolution K00 nd that the stars constituting the lens
galaxies must have formed at z  2 for a at cosmology with
M  03 and   07 and conclude from their analysis
that there are no signicant dierences between eld and
cluster early-type galaxies
K00 analyse the evolution of the FP in the observed
photometric bands and their modeling necessarily includes
the large variation in observed magnitudes and colors due
to redshift the K-correction This complicates the mea-
surement of the smaller eect due to evolution of the stellar
populations of the lens galaxies Rusin et al 2003 here-
after R03 study the same sample of lens galaxies with re-
cent photometric observations included They convert the
data from observed lters into magnitudes in standard rest-
frame bands so that the evolution of the ML ratio that
follows from the FP under the usual assumption that early-
type galaxies are a homologous family can be investigated
instead of the evolution within the FP This claries the
analysis and allows for direct comparison of the results with
those of other FP studies From their ML evolution anal-
ysis R03 nd a 2 lower limit z  18 for the formation of
the stars in lens galaxies Although this limit is more pre-
cise it is similar to that of K00 Hence R03 also conclude
that the evolution measurements favor old stellar popula-
tions among eld galaxies like those of cluster galaxies and
argue against signicant episodes of star formation at z  1
as predicted by the semi-analytical hierarchical models
For the analysis in this paper we use the tabulated data
of K00 extended with the recent photometric measurements
as given by R03 We convert the observed surface bright-
nesses and colors to the restframe Johnson B and Gunn r
bands Our transformation to restframe diers from that of
R03 In both approaches the modeled color between rest-
frame band and observed lter is used to convert the ob-
served magnitude into an estimate of the restframe mag-
nitude R03 obtain the modeled color for a given spectral
energy distribution whereas we use the observed color be-
tween a pair of lters to interpolate between the modeled
colors for four dierent spectral types Fig 3 Moreover
while R03 use the weighted contribution of all observed
magnitudes to determine the restframe magnitude we se-
lect the best one with small observational error and lter
close to the redshifted restframe band Hence the model
dependence of our correction is small and we exclude ob-
served magnitudes with large uncertainties minimizing the
error in the resulting restframe magnitude We analyze the
ML evolution of the lens galaxies and compare our results
with those of R03 and with results from previous studies
Additionally we test whether age dierences between the
lens galaxies are signicant To this end we study the scat-
ter in both the ML evolution and the restframe colors of
the lens galaxies and investigate whether the deviations are
correlated
This paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we de-
termine the FP parameters using the lensing geometry to
estimate the velocity dispersion The transformation from
observed to restframe bands is described in Section 3 In Sec-
tion 4 we construct the FP of the lens galaxies and present
the ML evolution derived from the FP We estimate the age
of the stellar populations of the lens galaxies by tting single
burst models to the ML evolution in Section 5 In Section
6 we study the colors of the lens galaxies The results are
summarized and discussed in Section 7 Unless stated other-
wise we assume H0  50 km s1 Mpc1 and a at cosmology
with M  03 and   07 We note that our results are
not dependent on the value of the Hubble constant
2 FP PARAMETERS
The study of the FP of strong gravitational lens galaxies
diers in two important aspects from that of cluster galaxies
First the lens galaxies are individual galaxies spread over a
large range in redshifts instead of an ensemble of galaxies at
the same redshift Additionally whereas studies of the FP
of optically selected galaxies measure velocity dispersions

Table 1 FP parameters of 26 strong gravitational lens galaxies with redshifts up to z  1 For 5 lens galaxies the redshift is not known
spectroscopically and a photometrically estimated value in italics is given The velocity dispersion c within the standard aperture
with a diameter of 34 at the distance of the Coma cluster follows from the lensing geometry assuming a singular isothermal sphere
mass model and a Hernquist 1990 luminosity prole The velocity dispersion from stellar kinematics  has been measured for 7 lens
galaxies references in text The eective radius re and eective surface brightness e follow from ts to an r14 law To allow a direct
comparison with the local FP the eective surface brightness has been corrected to the restframe Johnson B and Gunn r band by
interpolating between lters
from spectra for lens galaxies we use the lensing geometry
to estimate this quantity The separation between lensed
images of background sources increases with the mass of the
lens and is therefore a measure of the velocity dispersion
The two remaining FP parameters the eective radius and
surface brightness are determined from surface photometry
as for cluster galaxies
21 Velocity dispersion
For a singular isothermal sphere SIS mass model the re-
lation between the velocity dispersion of the matter dis-
tribution and the separation of the source images  is
  8Dc2DLSDOS Here DLS and DOS are the an-
gular diameter distances from the lens galaxy to the source
and from the observer to the source To determine these
values the redshifts of both the lens galaxy and the source
are needed eg Hogg 2000 If the redshift of a lens galaxy
is not known spectroscopically we adopt a photometrically
estimated value1 with a 10  uncertainty The lens systems
for which no redshift is known for the source we exclude
from our analysis This leaves a total of 26 lens galaxies of
which 5 have a redshift that is estimated photometrically
Table 1 The velocity dispersion D depends also weakly
on cosmology through the angular diameter distances but
is independent of the value of the Hubble constant since the
distances appear as a ratio
The velocity dispersion D is that of the total matter
distribution including possible dark matter rather than the
central velocity dispersion of the stellar component c For a
given mass and luminosity distribution the ratio g  cD
can be modeled by solving the single Jeans equation for
a spherical system with    and   1  2
anisotropy parameter eg Binney  Tremaine 1987 The
overall mass distribution is assumed to be isothermal We
model the luminosity distribution by a Hernquist 1990
prole with characteristic radius a  re18153 For each
lens galaxy with eective radius re in kpc see Section 22
we integrate the resulting line of sight velocity dispersion
within the Coma aperture to obtain an estimate for g so
that the stellar velocity dispersion follows as c  g D
 2
For the sample of 26 lens galaxies D is distributed with
a biweight2 mean of 230 km s1 and a biweight standard
1 Obtained from the CfA-Arizona Space Telescope Lens Survey
CASTLES web site at httpcfa-wwwharvardeducastles
2 Throughout this paper we use the biweight location and scale as
estimators of the mean and standard deviation rms respectively
These estimators are robust for a broad range of non-Gaussian
van de Ven van Dokkum  Franx
deviation of 61 km s1 In the case of an isotropic system
  0 the estimated stellar velocity dispersion c has a
mean of 223 km s1 and a standard deviation of 70 km s1
Hence the properties of the sample of lens galaxies will be
typical for early-type eld galaxies close to L which have
a characteristic velocity dispersion around 225 km s1 eg
Kochanek 1994 1996
Several sources contribute to the uncertainty in c We
account for the scatter in the image separation  which is
small and set to 2 Also the error in the eective radius re
Table 1 contributes through the modeled ratio g For those
galaxies for which only a photometric estimate of the lens
redshift zl is available we included an error of 10  Since
the angular diameter distance depends on redshift this error
is an additional contribution to the uncertainty in c via the
determination of D and via the conversion of the eective
radius in arcseconds into physical units of kpc Apart from
these errors in observational parameters we also want to
take into account that we have made several assumptions
in the modeling of the ratio g For the 26 lens galaxies the
distribution of g has a mean of 090 094 and 101 for an
anisotropy parameter  of 05 0 and 05 respectively For
each lens galaxy we apply the isotropic case   0 but to
take the variation of g with  into account together with
the assumption of a SIS mass model and a Hernquist prole
we assume an additional error of 10  in g and hence in c
For 7 out of the 26 lens galaxies presented in this paper
a velocity dispersion measured from stellar kinematics c is
available 0047-2808 Koopmans  Treu 2003 Q0957561

Koopmans  Treu 2002 and Q2237030 Foltz et al
1992 Comparing the measured velocity dispersions Table
1 with the modeled c from the lensing geometry we nd
for these 7 galaxies that the ratio cc is distributed with a
mean of 107 and dispersion of 027 For the sample of 7 lens
galaxies both methods are consistent However due to pe-
culiarities of the lensing system such as the contamination
of Q0957561 by the mass distribution of the underlying
cluster the velocity dispersion from both methods can be
signicantly dierent for individual lens galaxies
22 Eective radius and surface brightness
The lensing systems were observed with the WFPC2 NICMOS1
and NICMOS2 camera on the HST in lters ranging from the
visual F555W through the infrared F205W lter For each
system the image with optimal contrast between the lens
galaxy and the images of the background source is selected
and the eective radius re and the mean surface brightness
within the eective radius hei from ts to an r14 law is
determined The data and model ts are described in detail
by Lehar et al 2000 and K00 Note that re depends slightly
on cosmology due to the conversion of the eective radius
from units of arcseconds from the t into physical units of
kpc Moreover since the lens redshift is used in the con-
version we have to take into account a small additional
contribution to the uncertainty in re due to the assumed
10  error in the lens redshift in the case it is estimated
photometrically see also Section 21
In this paper we use the surface brightness at the ef-
fective radius e in mag arcsec2 which is related to hei
by e  hei  1393 We also dene Ie  10e25 In the
following we refer to the lter in which the t was made
as the reference lter The dependence of eective radius on
passband due to color gradients can be ignored because of
the strong correlation between e and re see Section 4
and we can use the observed colors tabulated by K00 to
calculate the eective surface brightness in each lter
The eective surface brightnesses and colors are cor-
rected for Galactic extinction with an RV  AV EB 
V   31 extinction curve for a diuse stellar medium eg
Cardelli Clayton  Mathis 1989 ODonnell 1994 The
galactic extinction EB  V  is obtained from Schlegel
Finkbeiner  Davis 1998 Extinction corrections on the
eective surface brightness are typically  003 magnitudes
in the reference lter which in most cases is the F160W
lter The three galaxies MG04140534 MG2016112 and
B2045265 are exceptions with signicantly higher galactic
extinction of 018 014 and 014 magnitudes respectively
3 TRANSFORMATION TO RESTFRAME
In order to compare the FP of the redshifted lens galaxies
directly to the FP of the Coma cluster at z  0023 we
calculate the eective surface brightness of the lens galaxies
in restframe Johnson B band and restframe Gunn r band
by interpolating between lters
In the following example we assume that the redshifted
r band falls between the WFPC2 F555W V  and F814W
I lters and the eective surface brightness is determined
in the NICMOS F160W H reference lter We assume a
linear relation between the AB magnitudes of the redshifted
r lter and the V and I lter so that for the restframe r
magnitude of a galaxy at redshift z we can write
rz  V  V  I  cV  cI   cV  cr  25 log1  z 1
The constants c are the conversion constants between the
standard Vega magnitudes and AB magnitudes
0 T f Vega
c  25 log R 
0 T d   4860
with f Vega
the uxdensity of Vega and T  the lter trans-
mission The transmission curves of the HST lters including
the CCD response were obtained from STScI3 and those of
the B and r passbands were obtained from Bessel 1990 and
Thuan  Gunn 1976 respectively We used the CALCPHOT
task of the STSDAS package in IRAF to calculate the conver-
sion constants for the HST lters The conversion constants
for the B and r passband follow from Bessel 1990 and Frei
 Gunn 1994 respectively The last term in 1 includes
the broadening of the r band with redshift and makes the
magnitude behave as if it is a ux rather than a uxdensity
Equation 1 relates the V  rz color of a lens galaxy
to its observed V  I color To determine  we model the
underlying populations and are less sensitive to outliers than stan-
dard estimators eg Beers Flynn  Gebhardt 1990

r band and the observed lter and a preference for lter
pairs enclosing the redshifted r band The latter implies an
interpolation between two lters whereas otherwise we have
to extrapolate As byproducts of our procedure we nd the
SEDs that provide the best ts to the observed colors of the
lens galaxies For the restframe B and r band this yields
respectively 20 77  and 19 73  lens galaxies that are
best tted by the ES0 spectral type whereas the colors of
the remaining lens galaxies are closest to the Sbc spectral

4 FP AND ML EVOLUTION
The Fundamental Plane has the form
log re   log c   log Ie  
Dressler et al 1987 Djorgovski  Davis 1987 with re in
kpc c in km s1 and e  25 log Ie in mag arcsec2
We adopt for the coecients  and  the values derived
by Jrgensen et al 1996 for a sample of 225 early-type
galaxies in nearby clusters They found for the Johnson B
band   120  006 and   083  002 and for the
Gunn r band   124  007 and   082  002
We use the tabulated photometric and spectroscopic
data of Jrgensen et al 1995a 1995b to construct the FP
of Coma The edge-on projection of the Coma FP in the
r band is shown in Fig 2 small dots A linear t to the
coma FP yields an intercept of 950  002 and 912  002
for the B and r band respectively Large symbols show the
lens galaxies The lens galaxies show a large scatter and are
oset with respect to the FP of Coma This relative dier-
ence can be attributed to the evolution of the ML ratios
of galaxies and the large scatter may in part be caused by
the large range of redshifts spanned by the lens sample
4 The restframe rz magnitude 1 behaves therefore as a K-
corrected magnitude
van de Ven van Dokkum  Franx
As usual in FP evolution studies we assume that early-
type galaxies are a homologous family ie that they are
structurally similar The total mass of a galaxy including
possible dark matter is then proportional to an eective
mass  2
c re With the total luminosity proportional to Ier2
the FP relation implies that the eective mass-to-light ratio

in the r band eg Treu et al 2001
The tightness of the FP relation implies a low scatter in the
ML ratios of early-type galaxies of 23  Faber et al 1987
Jrgensen Franx  Kjrgaard 1996 Hence the evolution
of ML can be well studied via the evolution of the FP
We assume that all early-type galaxies evolve in the
same way ie the coecients  and  are independent of
redshift and the same for cluster and eld early-type galax-
ies Until now there is no convincing observational evi-
dence against these assumptions but this might change if
more and deeper data become available eg van Dokkum
 Franx 1996 van Dokkum et al 2001 Treu et al 2002 If
furthermore the eective radius and velocity dispersion do
not change with redshift the dierence in FP intercept is
due to a dierence in surface brightness caused by luminos-
ity evolution As a result the evolution of the intercept of
the FP is proportional to the evolution of the mean ML
ratio For each lens galaxy the dierence in FP intercept
with respect to the Coma FP Fig 2 can be expressed as
an oset in its ML ratio relative to that of a galaxy of the
same mass in Coma Fig 3 two left panels shows the de-
pendence of the ML oset on redshift in the restframe r
band The ML ratio of lens galaxies clearly shows a trend
with redshift with the highest redshift objects having the
lowest ML ratios
From a linear t to the ML ratios of the 26 lens galax-
ies we nd an evolution rate d logMLdz of 062  013
and 047  011 in restframe B and r band respectively
The intercept of the t  log ML at z  0 is 001  008
and 001  006 respectively so that locally there is no sig-
nicant oset in the mean ML ratio of the lens and cluster
galaxies If this oset is forced to be zero we nd best-t
evolution rates for the B and r band of 063  006 and
049  005 which are only slightly higher than for the un-
constrained t The 1 errors from the t are smaller than
for the unconstrained t since only the slope is a tting
parameter while the intercept is xed to zero Restricting
the t to only the 21 lens galaxies with spectroscopic red-
shifts has no signicant eect on the results Similarly we
nd no signicant dierences if we exclude the lens galaxies
from the t for which a modest extrapolation was needed
in the transformation to restframe band or if for the 7 lens
galaxies for which the velocity dispersion c measured from
stellar kinematics is available this value is used instead of
the modeled c from the lensing geometry
For cluster galaxies van Dokkum et al 1998 nd in
the B band an evolution rate d logMLdz  049 
005 This means on average a faster evolution for the lens
galaxies but the dierence is only signicant if the ML
ratio of lens galaxies is forced to coincide with that of cluster
galaxies at z  0 The value for the cluster evolution rate
by van Dokkum et al 1998 does not take into account
possible eects due to morphological evolution If early-type
galaxies were transformed from late-type galaxies at modest
redshifts eg Dressler et al 1997 the early-type galaxies
that were already present at high redshift are only a subset of
all progenitors of low redshift early-type galaxies As a result
of this progenitor bias vDF01 the formation redshift of
morphologically selected cluster early-type galaxies may be
overestimated The lens galaxy sample is probably much less
aected by progenitor bias since they are selected on mass
and not on morphology but due to the merging of galaxies
a fraction of the progenitors may still not be accounted for
After applying the maximum correction for progenitor bias
allowed by the data vDF01 nd a cluster evolution rate of
d logMLdz  056  005 in the B band similar to the
evolution rate for the lens galaxies These results suggest
that if there is no progenitor bias eld galaxies may be
younger than cluster galaxies but that such an age dierence
becomes less signicant if we correct for possible progenitor
Our results are consistent with determinations for eld
galaxies based on direct spectroscopic measurements of the
velocity dispersions For the B band van Dokkum et al
2001 arrive at an evolution rate d logMLdz of 059 
015 and Treu et al 2002 nd a value of 072011
016 Com-
paring our results for the B band with those of R03 we nd
that the evolution rate obtained by R03 is on average slower
but the 1 condence limits still overlap For intercepts
that are allowed to vary and forced to be zero R03 nd an
evolution rate of 054  009 and 056  004 respectively
The error analysis and the transformation to restframe
of R03 diers from ours see also Section 1 but we cannot
further investigate the eects of these dierences as R03 do
not give their resulting fundamental plane parameters How-
ever if we add in quadrature an constant additional error
to the observed uncertainties in the ML ratios of the lens
galaxies the slope of the t does decrease Around the linear
t we measure a biweight scatter of 017 for the B band
and 015 for the r band5 which in both cases is higher than
the expected scatter from the observational errors of 012 If
we now take for the constant additional scatter the dierence
in quadrature between the measured and expected scatter
we nd for the unconstrained t in the B band an evolution
rate of 056  012 almost identical to the result of R03 If
the oset is forced to zero the slope changes less giving an
evolution rate of 061  005 Note that R03 rescale their
input errors so that the best-t model has a reduced 2 of
one They assume that the additional scatter is due to un-
derestimated errors in the data set whereas we propose that
internal population dierences cause the additional scatter
Hence we multiply our results with the square root of the
reduced 2 to reect this aspect but we do not change the
uncertainties on the input data
The additional scatter implies that the ML ratios of
the lens galaxies are not well tted with a single evolution
rate whereas for the cluster galaxies the t is very good eg
van Dokkum et al 1998 This may be due to a signicant
spread in stellar population ages among eld galaxies which
induces an additional scatter measured in the evolution rate
d logMLdz of the lens galaxies In the next Section we
relate the ML evolution to stellar population ages by t-
ting simple single burst models In Section 6 we then study
5 The scatter in the B band is probably higher than in the r
band due to the fact that the B band is more sensitive to recent
star formation
the restframe colors of lens galaxies and their evolution To
nd out whether there is a signicant age spread we also
investigate scatter in color and if it is correlated with the
scatter in ML ratio
5 STELLAR POPULATION AGES
The evolution of the ML ratio depends on the age of the
stellar population A stellar population which formed at
low redshift will evolve faster than a population formed at
high redshift the luminosity of a young population becomes
rapidly fainter when short-lived massive and bright stars dis-
appear whereas the dimming of the light is more gradual
for an old population dominated by low mass stars We esti-
mate the stellar population ages of lens galaxies and the age
dierence between lens and cluster galaxies by tting simple
single burst models to the ML evolution
The ML ratio of a single burst stellar population with
xed mass evolves as
ML  t  t
with t the stellar formation time corresponding to a stellar
formation redshift z eg Tinsley  Gunn 1976 The co-
ecient  depends on the Initial Mass Function IMF and
metallicity and also on the passband in which the lumi-
nosity is measured For a normal IMF with Salpeter 1955
slope and Solar metallicity B  093 and r  078 for
the restframe B and r bands Worthey 1994 Note that the
predicted evolution is independent of H0 because the age
dependence of the ML ratio is a power-law
We rst investigate if we can t the observed ML evo-
lution of the lens galaxies by a single burst evolution model
with the same stellar formation redshift z as has been de-
rived previously for cluster galaxies the null-hypothesis In
Section 52 and 53 we investigate the range of z allowed
by the data
51 Can cluster galaxies and lens galaxies have
the same age
Before investigating more complex models we consider the
case that lens galaxies and cluster galaxies have the same lu-
minosity weighted stellar age To determine the mean stellar
formation redshift of cluster early-type galaxies hzcl

02 for cluster galaxies Therefore we consider 20 
  43 as a plausible range for the mean star formation
epoch of cluster early-type galaxies
We tted single burst models with this range of for-
mation redshifts to the restframe B and r band data of
the lens galaxies The ts improve towards higher forma-
tion epoch but even those with maximum progenitor bias
correction are rejected with nearly 100  We can allow for
an oset between ML ratios of lens galaxies and those of
cluster galaxies We will describe this oset with the value
of  log ML at z  0 which we denote by b For a stellar
formation epoch ranging from 43 to 20 no to maximum
progenitor bias correction the oset b varies from 012 to
006 for the B band and from 008 to 003 for the r
band These models with a systematic oset t the lens data
better but are still rejected with  999  condence
52 Model A unconstrained t
We assume that the ML ratios of eld galaxies are inde-
pendent of those of cluster galaxies ie a cluster galaxy of
a given age can have a very dierent ML ratio than a eld
galaxy of the same age This may be the case if eg the
metallicities of eld and cluster galaxies are dierent at a
given mass In addition to the stellar formation redshift z
we also have the normalization of the single burst model as
free parameter We describe this second parameter with b
see Section 51
For a range of z and b values we t single burst mod-
els the observed ML values of the redshifted lens galaxies
For the r band the 12 and 3  limits on z and b are
shown the in the upper-right panel of Fig 3 with the min-
imum indicated by a cross The best-t values of z and b
are 1814
05 and 003  009 for the B band and 1919
and 001  007 for the r band Table 2 Note that the
given uncertainties are 1 errors unless noted The MLr
evolution that corresponds to the best-t values is shown in
the upper-left panel of Fig3 dashed line Since for both B
and r band the model parameter b is not signicantly dif-
ferent from zero we obtain similar best-t values for z if
we normalize the single burst model such that b  0 ie if
we assume that locally the average ML ratio of eld and
cluster galaxies is the same
53 Model B simultaneous t to lens and cluster
galaxies
Here we assume that the stellar populations of eld and
cluster galaxies evolve in the same way The stellar popu-
lations of the lens galaxies may form at a dierent redshift
than those of the cluster galaxies but galaxies of a given age
have identical ML ratios For the formation redshift of the
stars in cluster galaxies we use the values that we obtained
in Section 51 zcl

galaxies Note that z and b are coupled in this model be-
cause of the constraint that lens galaxies with the same age

54 Summary of results
We have demonstrated that the ML evolution of lens galax-
ies cannot be tted with models that provide good ts to
cluster galaxies The t clearly improves if lens galaxies are
allowed to be systematically oset from cluster galaxies due
to metallicity dierences or other systematic eects
If we consider both this oset and the stellar formation
epoch of the lens galaxies as free parameters the best-t
single burst model in the B and r band are consistent The
resulting oset is not signicantly dierent from zero and
although the best-t stellar formation redshift implies for
lens galaxies on average a younger stellar population than for
cluster galaxies the resulting 1 range of 13  hzi  38
is not signicantly dierent from the formation epoch for
cluster galaxies of 18  hzcl
 i  80 for the full range from
no to maximum progenitor bias correction
If we impose the constraint that galaxies of the same age
have the same ML ratio irrespective of their environment
we nd stellar formation redshifts for the lens galaxies of
16  hzi  20 if the stars in cluster galaxies formed at
  20 maximum progenitor bias and 19  hzi 
26 if the stars in cluster galaxies formed at zcl
  43 no
progenitor bias In the latter case the stellar populations
of the lens galaxies are signicant younger 1015  at the
present epoch than those of the cluster galaxies
If the local ML oset between lens and cluster galax-
ies is allowed to vary R03 nd for the stellar formation red-
shift of the lens galaxies a 1 range of 20  hzi  36
from their B band analysis Although we nd a range of
13  hzi  32 model A B band which implies on aver-
age a somewhat younger stellar population the results are
consistent R03 conclude that the ML evolution rates they
measure favor old stellar populations for the lens galaxies
with a mean formation redshift hzi  18 at a 2 condence
level We nd a lower 2 condence limit of hzi  12
To test the hypothesis whether the ML evolution of
the lens galaxies can be tted with a single burst model
FP and ML evolution lens galaxies
we calculate the reduced 2 We also compare the measured
scatter around the t with the expected scatter from the
uncertainties in the ML ratios of the lens galaxies If we al-
low more freedom in the single burst models the t improves
lower reduced 2 and the measured scatter decreases How-
ever even the over-all best-t single burst model is rejected
with  99  condence and the measured scatter of 017 and
015 in B and r band is signicant higher than the expected
scatter of 012 from the observational errors To establish
whether the additional scatter is due to a signicant spread
in ages among eld galaxies we study in the next Section
the restframe colors of the lens galaxies and investigate
if there is also a signicant scatter in the color and if it is
correlated with the scatter in their ML ratios
6 COLORS
If the stellar populations of lens galaxies are on average
younger than those of cluster galaxies Section 5 we expect
their colors to evolve more rapidly and to be on average
bluer than those of cluster galaxies For single burst stellar
populations the B  r color evolves as
B  r  25B  r logt  t  c
with B  r  015 Worthey 1994 and c a normalization
constant
The left panel of Fig 4 shows the restframe B  r colors
of the lens galaxies versus redshift For the lens galaxies
with open circles a modest extrapolation was required in
the transformation to either the restframe B or r band The
red outlier at z  04 is the lens BRI0952-0115 for which
the observed R  H F675W-F160W color is signicantly
redder than the modeled ES0 color and for which we had
to extrapolate in the transformation to restframe B band

the mean cluster formation epoch of zcl
  20 maximum
progenitor bias is drawn solid line through the averaged
color of the coma cluster galaxies small dot A decline in
the colors of the lens galaxies with increasing redshift is
visible in spite of the large scatter If we t single burst
models as in Section 5 model A and B we nd on average
a younger stellar formation epoch for the lens galaxies but
the dierence with the cluster galaxies is never signicant In
case the stellar populations of eld and cluster galaxies are
assumed to evolve in the same way model B the evolution
model with the best-t stellar formation redshift of z  17
is shown in the left panel of Fig 4 dashed line Similarly as
for the single burst model ts to the ML evolution the ts
to the color evolution are rejected with  99  condence
and the measured scatter is in all cases signicantly higher
than the expected scatter from the observational errors in
the restframe colors of the lens galaxies
To further investigate the scatter in color we subtract
the predicted colors of cluster galaxies with zcl
  20 from
the restframe colors of the lens galaxies Note that this
choice of formation redshift corresponds to the minimum
age dierence between eld and cluster galaxies In the right
panel of Fig 4 we show the resulting residual colors plotted
against velocity dispersion with a linear t to the Coma
cluster galaxies The lens galaxies show a large spread in
their reduced colors and are on average bluer by  01 mag

also show a model with z  1 dotted line For redshifts beyond z  05 the scatter in color increases and becomes signicant higher

cluster galaxies with zcl
  20 plotted versus velocity dispersion The solid line is a linear t to the Coma cluster galaxies On average
the colors of the lens galaxies are bluer than those of the cluster galaxies consistent with a younger average stellar population The
scatter in the reduced colors is larger than expected from the observational errors
than the cluster galaxies The bluer average color is quali-
tatively consistent with the on average younger ages of lens
galaxies derived from the single burst model ts above and
from the ts to the ML evolution Section 54 For the
total sample of 26 lens galaxies we measure a scatter in
the residual colors of 022 that is signicant higher than
the expected scatter of 018 From the left panel of Fig 4
we observe that the color scatter increases beyond z  05
For the 15 lens galaxies with z  05 we measure a scat-
ter of 024 whereas for the lens galaxies with z  05 the
measured scatter is only 016 and nearly identical to the ex-
pected scatter of 015 from the errors in the colors of these
galaxies
The additional measured scatter in the residual colors
of the lens galaxies may indicate a signicant spread in the
ages of the stellar populations of the lens galaxies We test
whether the color spread is caused by a spread in ages or
other eects by investigating whether the residual colors
correlate with the residual ML ratios In Fig 5 we plot
the color of the lens galaxies against the logarithm of their
ML ratio For both quantities the expected evolution of
a stellar population formed at zcl
  20 was subtracted
hence a galaxy with the average color and ML ratio of
galaxies in Coma would be located at the origin From Eq
7 and 5 it follows that a linear relation is expected in Fig
5 with a time-independent slope of 25B  rB 
040 solid line The data appear to be correlated in the
expected sense albeit with large scatter To test whether the
correlation is signicant we used the Spearmans rank-order
correlation coecient rS We nd that rS  047 so that
with N  26 lenses we can reject the hypothesis that the

the ducial cluster galaxy evolution model with zcl
  20 The
symbols are the same as in Fig 2 with the average of Coma
situated in the origin The dashed line is a linear t to the data
the solid line shows the expected correlation between color and
ML ratio due to age variations with slope 25B  rB 
040 Although the slope is uncertain the correlation between
color and ML ratio is signicant at the 95  level Hence we
interpret the intrinsic scatter in the colors of the lens galaxies as
a stellar population eect probably caused by a spread in their
two quantities are uncorrelated with  95  condence The
only viable explanation for the correlation is age variation
If the correlation would be caused by metallicity variations
some eld galaxies would be much less metal rich than
cluster galaxies opposite to the result by Kuntschner et al
2002
The colors and ML ratios of the bluest lens galaxies
are best tted with stellar formation redshifts as low as z 
1 About half the lens galaxies are consistent with an old
cluster-like stellar population with stellar formation redshift
z  2 If galaxies form in a sequence of bursts formation
redshifts are indicative of the last prominent epoch of star
formation The galaxies can have older underlying stellar
populations
7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We studied the evolution of the ML ratios of lens galaxies
in the restframe Johnson B and Gunn r bands For an at
cosmology with M  03 and   07 we obtained an
evolution rate d logMLdz of 062  013 in restframe
B and 047  011 in restframe r Due to dierences in the
determination of the FP parameters and the corresponding
errors the evolution rate obtained by R03 of 054  009 is
slightly slower but not signicant dierent Our results are
consistent with determinations for eld galaxies based on di-
rect spectroscopic measurements of the velocity dispersions
For the B band van Dokkum et al 2001 arrive at an evo-
lution rate of 059  015 and Treu et al 2002 nd a
value of 072011
016 The weighted mean of these results and
our result yields an evolution rate for eld early-type galax-
ies of 064  006 in the B band For cluster galaxies van
Dokkum et al 1998 and vDF01 nd an evolution rate be-
tween d logMLBdz  049  005 and 056  005 for
minimum and maximum progenitor bias respectively The
latter value is not signicantly dierent from the average
evolution rate for the eld galaxies
We further investigated the ML evolution in Section
5 where we related it to stellar population ages by tting
simple single burst models for a Salpeter 1955 IMF and
Solar metallicity The ML evolution of cluster galaxies is
well approximated by a mean single burst formation redshift
02 after maximum progenitor
bias correction vDF01

  2003
We rst tested if these cluster models could t the ML
evolution of the lens galaxies This is not the case but the
ts improve if there is a systematic oset between lens and
cluster galaxies of  01 in  log ML Such an oset could
be caused by eg metallicity variations systematic dier-
ences in the velocity dispersions due to the dierent mea-
surement techniques or other eects It is interesting to note
that hierarchical models have predicted such a constant o-
set with redshift between cluster and eld galaxies see van
Dokkum et al 2001 However similar to van Dokkum et al
2001 we conclude that the observed oset is much smaller
than the predicted oset of  log MLB  026
If we next allow the stellar formation redshift z also to
vary we nd for the best-t single burst model that the o-
set is not signicant from zero together with a mean stellar
formation epoch hzi for the lens galaxies of 1814
05 in the
B band and 1919
06 in the r band This means that on aver-
FP and ML evolution lens galaxies
age the stellar populations of the lens galaxies are younger
but the dierence with the cluster galaxies is not signi-
cant However if we impose the constraint that galaxies of
the same age have the same ML ratio irrespective of their
environment we nd without correction for progenitor bias
that the stellar populations of the lens galaxies are signi-
cant younger 1015  at the present epoch than those of
the cluster galaxies In the case of maximum progenitor bias
the average dierence  5  is not anymore signicant
From their analysis R03 obtain a 2 lower limit for the
mean stellar formation epoch of lens galaxies of hzi  18
whereas we nd that lower stellar formation redshifts are
allowed with hzi  12 as a 2 lower limit Nevertheless
these results disagree with the prediction of semi-analytical
hierarchical galaxy formation models eg Kaumann 1996
Kaumann  Charlot 1998 Diaferio et al 2001 that early-
type eld galaxies in general have very late star formation
with z  1
Whereas the ML evolution of cluster galaxies is well
approximated by a single burst evolution model we found
that this is not the case for the lens galaxies All single burst
models are rejected with  99  based on the reduced 2
and the measured scatter is in all cases signicant higher
than the expected scatter from the observational errors The
additional scatter is most likely caused by dierences in the
stellar population of the lens galaxies
To investigate whether there is a signicant spread in
ages we studied in Section 6 the restframe colors of the lens
galaxies and their evolution The colors of the lens galax-
ies are on average bluer than those of the cluster galaxies
consistent with on a younger average stellar population We
found that the measured scatter in the single burst ts to
the colors is much larger than the expected scatter from the
observational errors Moreover we showed that there is a
signicant correlation between the colors and the MLB ra-
tios of the lens galaxies We interpret this as evidence for a
signicant spread in the stellar population ages of the lens
galaxies
Whereas about half of the lens galaxies are consistent
with old cluster-like stellar populations the bluest galaxies
are best t by single burst models with young stellar forma-
tion redshifts z  1 For the seven blue lens galaxies with
residual colors below 02 mag in the right panel of Fig
4 we found as a byproduct of our transformation to rest-
frame B band that only two of them are best tted by the
ES0 spectral type ie  28  whereas for the total sam-
ple we found 77  For the r band even six of the seven blue
galaxies are best tted by the Scd spectral type instead of
the ES0 spectral type Three of the seven blue galaxies in-
deed show some deviations from early-type morphology
FBQ09512635 is an edge-on disk galaxy SBS1520530
is slightly irregular and B1608656 is an apparently dusty
galaxy with star forming regions However a homogeneous
sample of quasar subtracted NICMOS images of the lens
galaxies is needed to do a more detailed and systematic
study of their morphologies Such a study will be valuable
to determine the cause of apparently younger populations
in a fraction of the lens galaxies
