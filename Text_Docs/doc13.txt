ABSTRACT
The contraction model of Field and Colgate for proto-galaxies rst proposed to
describe the observed properties of quasars is generalized and used to investigate
the evolution of galaxies The LEDA data base for elliptical spiral compact and
diuse galaxies is employed and it is shown that the above model is consistent with
observational evidences regarding their dynamical evolution star formation rate and
dierent morphologies
Key words galaxies formation  galaxies luminosity function  quasars general

INTRODUCTION
It is generally thought that the galaxies are formed by cool-
ing and condensation from the intergalactic gas clouds of suf-
ciently high densities 1234 The recent great advances
in observational technologies made the proto-galaxies PGs
one of the most exciting and lively elds of extragalactic as-
tronomy Rees and Ostriker 5 argued that the collapse of a
virialised gas for which the cooling time is shorter than dy-
namical time will lead to the formation of a galaxy White
and Rees 6 solved the problem of cooling catastrophe hi-
erarchical model of Rees and Ostriker by introducing the
idea of feedback resulting from energy release from super-
novae associated with the early generation of stars and re-
heating the gas before having a chance to condense On the
other hand the initial total mass 7 the initial angular mo-
mentum 8 and the initial density distribution 9 play a
signicant role in evolution history of the galaxies Here we
consider the Field and Colgate FC model 10 and gener-
alized it to include the eect of initial mass and initial size
as well as initial angular velocity To do this and to have
a conserved dynamical quantity during the collapse of the
cloud we introduce the specic angular momentum SAM
as parameter which governs the evolution Furthermore it
is known that the star formation history of the galaxies de-
pends on their rotations 11 Therefore one expects that the
observed luminosities of the galaxies would be aected by
star formation rate SFR which itself may depend on SAM
From this point of view SFR may be included in the FC
model The generalized version of the FC model in the form
mentioned above called GFC model is used to explain the
observed properties of galaxies such as their morphologies
luminosities compactness evolution and SFR The LEDA
ccid13 RAS
database of 100000 galaxies 12 is used as our source data
It is shown that the SAM of PGs has a signicant eect
on their evolution In addition the dierent values of SAM
for dierent morphologies together with their SFR may be
employed to present a conjecture about their origin
In section 2 the FC model is reviewed and is generalized to
introduce the GFC model In section 3 the GFC model is ex-
amined versus the observational data It is shown that this
model is capable of explaining various aspects of galaxies
Section 4 is devoted to the concluding remarks
2 GFC MODEL
The FC model was rst introduced to describe the obser-
vational properties of quasars This model assumes that for
proto-galaxies of the same mass and size the average mass
of their constituent stars their total energy output and
their nal size at the end of galaxy formation depend on
their initial angular velocities According to this model the
proto-galaxies with lower angular velocities would be even-
tually converted to more compact and luminous objects such
as quasars and compact galaxies This proposition may be
tested by using the observational data obtained in galaxy
surveys However before doing this a few points must be
taken into account In contrast to the assumptions of FC
model the angular velocity is not a conserved quantity dur-
ing the contraction processes Therefore the observed an-
gular velocities do not indicate any relevance to their initial
values which the proto-galaxy starts the contraction with
Thus another parameter must be replaced by angular ve-
locity which keeps a constant value during the contraction
Another point is that the typical mass and size assumed for
F Tabatabaei and SNasiri
all proto-galaxies in FC model do not make any sense In
the other words one actually expects some kind of distri-
bution for these quantities rather than a xed value Thus
upon these considerations we propose the angular momen-
tum ie angular momentum per unit mass instead of an-
gular velocity and call the revised version of FC model as
generalized FC or GFC model However the specic angu-
lar momentum hereafter SAM is assumed to be constant
during the contraction process This assumption does not es-
sentially change the dynamical grounds of the FC model and
revise it only to obtain a better t to observations In fact
FC model will emerge as a special case from GFC model In
the framework of GFC model a given SAM may correspond
to dierent values for masses and sizes of proto-galaxies
Now the lower higher values of SAM will eventually lead
to more compact diuse and luminous faint galaxies
These will be conrmed observationally in the next sections
As mentioned before the FC model is proposed to describe
the observational properties of quasars However because of
the lack of required data for these objects one may use the
already available data for galaxies If the model is shown
to work well for galaxies one might try to extend it for
quasars too On the other hand compact objects will pos-
sess much more massive stars Therefore one should argue
that by rapid energy consumption they must evolve faster
than those having low mass stars This processes if done for
quasars which by GFC model are extreme case of galaxies
with less SAM will eventually make them to disappear as
a result of the collapse followed by consuming their energy
sources Thus GFC model predicts an evolutionary decay
mechanism for quasars in the course of time We will show
that this process may be equally applied for compact galax-
ies and those with lower SAM which in turn have young
blue stars and less interstellar gas
3 GFC MODEL VERSUS OBSERVATION
Let us investigate the dependence of SAM for dierent mor-
phologies and types of galaxies on their SL The data is
extracted from LEDA data base First we compare the be-
havior of SAM versus SL for the ellipticals and spirals as
two distinct morphologies Then the same thing is done for
dierent types of spirals according to the de Vaucouleurs
classication
31 GALAXIES WITHIN THE SAME
MORPHOLOGICAL TYPE
According to the GFC model we expect that the luminosi-
ties of galaxies increase as their SAM decrease Figure 1
shows the behavior of SAM for 56 elliptical galaxies in terms
of their luminosity The result shown in Fig 1 however is
not consistent with GFC model
To get the expected result one might use the specic
luminosity luminosity per unit mass instead of luminosity
itself for the galaxies The results obtained in such a way
are shown in Fig 2
The best tted curve to this gure has the form y

The exponential behavior shows the decreasing lumi-
nosity with increasing SAM in agreement with the GFC
hypothesis The same quantities are obtained for dierent
morphologies of de Vaucouleurs class of spiral galaxies and
the results are plotted in Figs 3 to 6 Again the results sup-
port the GFC model Of course the functional form of SAM
are not the same for all morphologies The best tted curve
for 226 galaxies of Sa type Fig3 is y  a  b expx

For all of the above Figures there are an exponential best
tted curve showing a behavior similar to the one for Sa

is in the form y  a  b

32 ELLIPTICALS VERSUS SPIRALS
Spiral galaxies rotate faster than elliptical galaxies14 Ac-
cording to GFC model their luminosity is expected to be less
However this is not supported by low redshift galaxy obser-
vations The discrepancy seems to be removed as follows
In general most of the observations are limited to the near
distances or low redshifts However the high redshift obser-
vations show that the evolution procedure is not the same
for spirals and ellipticals In other words they are in dier-
ent phases of star formation Ellipticals have stopped their
star formation processes because of fast SFR in the past
while spirals are still active and therefore have some young
blue stars producing the observed excess luminosity There-
fore the nal elliptical or luminous spirals not only violate
the GFC model but rather conrm it That is ellipticals
were started from slowly rotating proto-galaxies compared
with those of spirals Therefore the condensation rate for
ellipticals were higher than spirals leading to higher SFR in
ccid13 RAS MNRAS 000 16
a certain phase of evolution for ellipticals As a result ellip-
ticals evolved faster than spirals and now contain old stars
showing in some sense the decay mechanism for galaxies
The same mechanism works for quasars with higher decay
rates and it will be investigated elsewhere15
33 DE VAUCOULEURS TYPES OF SPIRALS
We now look for a relation between SAM and luminosity for
dierent de Vaucouleurs types of spiral galaxies In Figs 7
to 13 we illustrate the absolute magnitude or luminosity
distribution of spiral galaxies of dierent de Vaucouleurs
type We may t Gaussian distributions to these gures and
calculate the most probable absolute magnitude Mmp for
which the number of galaxies is maximum for each group
belonging to a specic morphology Results for Mmp as well
as the average value of SAM for each type are given in the
table It is seen that SAM increases from Sbc to Sd However
it uctuates from Sa to Sbc whereas the Mmp decreases
from Sb to Sd and uctuates from Sa to Sb If one resorts
the table say by increasing order of SAM one can nd that
the Lmp increases with decreasing average SAM

Figure 8 The same as g 7 for about 248 Sab galaxies
On the other hand the average mass m corresponding
to each type given in the 4th column of the table increases
in the same manner as Mmp from Sbc to Sd and uctuates
from Sa to Sbc This phenomenological investigation results
shows the role of mass on aecting the Mmp While the ratio
m shown in 5th column of the table increases from Sbc
to Sd and uctuates from Sa to Sbc This apparently con-
tradicts with GFC model However similar to what we did
in section 32 for comparison of ellipticals and spirals one
can argue as follows It is known that the late type spirals
are those with greatest amount of dust and gas and high-
est SFR This gives the lowest mass-luminosity ratio for
these type of galaxies which in turn leads to the observed
behavior Thus one may conclude that the SFR plays a sig-
nicant role in evolution and distribution of galaxies In the
other words according to the GFC model we expect that
for those morphologies of spiral galaxies with less SAM un-
dergo more rapid decay mechanism compared with those
having higher SAM This leads to lower present SFR giving
lower SL Therefore observed properties not only do not
contradict with the GFC model but also support it
Also the eect of SAM on SFR discussed above is in agree-
ment with that of Samland and Hensler 12 obtained by a
chemo-dynamical approach
34 COMPACTNESS AND GFC MODEL
We nally use GFC model to study the observational proper-
ties of compact C and diuse D galaxies given by LEDA
data base Figs 14 and 15 show the distribution of ab-
solute magnitude for 450 C-type and 230 D-type galaxies
respectively It is seen that the most probable magnitudes
are -2082 and -1976 for C- and D-type galaxies respec-
tively Therefore the compact galaxies are on the average
about one magnitude more luminous than diuse galaxies
suggesting another observational evidence satised by GFC

4 CONCLUSIONS
We have used the LEDA data base with complete morpho-
logical classication to study the phenomenological investi-
gation in the framework of the GFC model We conclude as
follows
a Within the same morphological type the expected behav-
ior of SAM in terms of luminosity is not seen However this
is not surprising because of dierence in masses of galaxies
Further it is shown that when we use SL instead of L for
dierent masses of galaxies the discrepancy is removed by
compensating the role of mass Therefore we receive conr-
mation for GFC model
b For dierent morphologies SFR of each type has a signif-
icant role in the value of the most probable luminosity per
unit average mass This may not be looked as a discrepancy
with GFC model because the SFR history depends on SAM
showing a weak form of the decay mechanism inherent in
the GFC model for galaxies too
cThe distribution of compact galaxies in terms of their ab-
solute magnitude shows higher average luminosities com-
pared with diuse galaxies This is another aspect of the
GFC model
