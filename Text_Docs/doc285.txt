Abstract Increasingly good statistical data on the galaxy population at high and low redshift
enable the development of new phenomenological approaches to galaxy evolution based on ap-
plication of the simplest continuity equations This has given new insights into the dierent ways
in which star-formation in galaxies is quenched the role of merging in the population and in
to the control of star-formation in star-forming galaxies and the links with chemical evolution
The continuity approach provides a self-consistent view of the evolving population and exposes
linkages between dierent aspects of galaxy evolution

1 Introduction the continuity approach to galaxy evolution
Large surveys of the extragalactic Universe both nearby and at high redshifts are
producing high quality statistical data on the galaxy population over a wide range of
epochs These allow the possibility of a new phenomenological approach to galaxy evolu-
tion that is built around the simple continuity equations that link the galaxy population
at dierent epochs In this approach we rst identify both locally and at high redshift a
few underlying simplicities or symmetries exhibited by the galaxy population and then
explore analytically the implications of these via the continuity equations
This approach is in a sense reversed from the usual theoretical approach of the semi-
analytic models which start with the hierarchical build-up of dark matter haloes within
which baryons evolve subject to a large number of physical processes that are described by
analytic formulae The models end up involving a large number of overt free parameters
at least 30 plus many additional assumptions that are buried in the implementation
State of the art semi-analytic models are quite successful in reproducing the galaxy
population but the inevitable complexity of the models means that there is considerable
uncertainty as to the uniqueness of any particular implementation and agreement with
observations is never perfect
Our continuity approach steps back from physical inputs apart from the most basic
continuity equations and focuses directly on what the data appear to require This
approach produces phenomenological descriptions of the evolution of galaxies that may
help constrain more physically motivated models It can also identify hidden connections
between dierent aspects of galaxy evolution that appear at rst sight to be disjoint
At the very least this approach should produce a simple self-consistent framework for
interpreting dierent data provide a common language for discussion and allow well-
posed questions to guide future observational programs
We here review our recent work in this area and discuss some of the insights that have
been gained in a series of recent papers In Section 2 based on Peng et al 2010 2012
S J Lilly et al
hereafter P10 and P12 we focus on the inter-relationships between star-formation stellar
mass and environment and the quenching of star-formation in galaxies In Section 3
based on Peng et al in preparation we briey discuss the merging of galaxies which is
also discussed in another contribution to these Proceedings Finally in Section 4 which
is based on Lilly et al 2013 hereafter L13 we examine the control of star-formation in
star-forming galaxies and the connections between metallicity the cosmic star-formation
history of galaxies and the eciency with which dark-matter haloes produce stars
2 The quenching of galaxies
Most star-forming galaxies have an SFR that is well-correlated with their existing
stellar mass producing a tight Main Sequence MS on which the specic SFR sSFR
depends only weakly on stellar mass sSF R  m with   01 with a scatter of
order 03 dex A few percent of galaxies have signicantly elevated sSFR but these
contribute only about 10 of the overall star-formation over a range of redshifts 0  z  2
Rodighiero et al 2011 Sargent et al 2012 Locally these star-bursts are associated with
major mergers of galaxies and the same may be true at high redshifts also Finally
there is a substantial population of galaxies with much reduced sSFR These quenched
galaxies are not forming a signicant number of stars ie sSF R1  H  The physical
process that turns o star-formation in galaxies is not well understood Plausible ideas
include the action of AGN or extreme merger-induced star-bursts the inability of some
haloes to deliver cool gas to the central galaxy plus a whole host of ways in which satellite
galaxies may interact with the environment
21 Key observational axioms
Our analysis of quenching is based two key observational facts which we use as axioms
 Separability of the red fraction As shown in P10 the SDSS red fraction
fredm  is separable in mass and environment environment is here a nearest neigh-
bour measure of local density but could equally well be a central-satellite division etc
This means that the fraction of surviving blue galaxies can be written as the product
of two functions one of mass but not environment and the other of environment but not
fbluem   1  mm  1  
Separability was already implicit in one of the tting formulae for the SDSS fredm 
given by Baldry et al 2007 We argued in P10 that this separability suggests that there
are two probabilistic channels for quenching galaxies one we call mass-quenching
which is linked to the mass of galaxies but not environment and the other environment-
quenching determined by the environment of a galaxy but not by its stellar mass Of
course galaxies are unlikely to evolve probabilistically and so there are presumably
hidden parameters at work but these must be independent of environment for mass-
quenching and vice versa
 The shape of the mass function of star-forming galaxies stays the same
back to at least z  2 and probably back to z  4  Both the characteristic mass M
and the faint-end slope S of the Schechter mass function of star-forming galaxies show
very little evolution between SDSS locally and the high redshift population In contrast
the density normalization  increases by a factor of about 3 since z  2 and by 20
since z  4 This vertical evolution in SF m is quite dierent from the horizontal
evolution of the mass-function of dark matter haloes which changes primarily in M 
with more or less constant  The surprising constancy of M  was rst highlighted by
IAUS 295 The intriguing life of massive galaxies
Bell et al 2005 to z  1 was evident in Gonzales et al 2010 to z  4 using photo-z
to z  4 and is rmly established in COSMOS with both photo-z and spec-z Ilbert et
al 2010 Pozzetti et al 2010 Ilbert et al 2013
Other important observations that simplify the analytic treatment but are not really
required per se are i the small dispersion in sSFR on the Main Sequence ii the weak
dependence of the Main Sequence sSFR on mass   0 and iii the evidence that
the environment term  is more or less constant back to z  08 P10 It is also
convenient to assume that quenching is instantaneous and one-way The characteristic
sSFR of the MS gives the rate at which galaxies increase their logarithmic mass and
the evolving sSFRt therefore sets the clock of the evolving population but does not
aect the outcome
These most basic observational results are of course inter-linked The dramatic increase
in sSFR to high redshift implies that a given galaxy that stays on the Main Sequence will
have increased its mass by a factor of about 50 since z  2 This makes the constancy of
M  and S all the more striking and emphasizes the importance of uid-like continuity
equations to track the evolving galaxy population
22 Environment-quenching as satellite-quenching
In P12 it was shown that the environmental eects in SDSS that we highlighted in P10
are conned to satellite galaxies Unlike the satellites the properties of central galaxies do
not depend on  at xed mass The satellite-quenching eciency sat is the probability
that a blue star-forming galaxy is quenched because it becomes the satellite of another
galaxy This is empirically independent of stellar mass in SDSS as in van den Bosch
et al 2008 with a mean value of sat  04 As predicted from P10 sat increases with
the local density  which may be taken as an imperfect proxy for the location within
a groupcluster It is largely independent of group mass at xed  In other words
the environment-quenching of P10 is simply satellite-quenching Similar results are
also evident in the detailed study of 170 low redshift ZENS groups Carollo et al in
preparation
Satellite-quenching is independent of stellar mass and so it cannot change the shape
of the mass-function of star-forming galaxies Instead it will produce a mass-function
of satellite-quenched passive galaxies that has the same M  and S as the star-forming
population but a relative  EQ SF that increases with the local density
23 Mass-quenching
Mass-quenching acts on all galaxies independent of environment ie on both centrals
and satellites Since only mass-quenching is linked to galaxy mass it must be this process
alone that controls the shape of the mass function of the surviving star-forming galaxy
population Indeed mass-quenching is usefully thought of as that process which controls
the mass function of star-forming galaxies and the star-forming mass-function therefore
gives us as clear a view of the action of mass-quenching as the more traditional study of
the red fraction
The observed constancy of M  for the star-forming population places a strong require-
ment on the form of mass-quenching This can be expressed either as a quenching rate
m the chance of a given galaxy to be mass-quenched per unit time or equivalently
as a survival probability for a given galaxy to reach a particular mass m without being
quenched P m Both versions include a constant  that is the inverse of the time-
1 It is easy to show analytically from the continuity
independent M  ie   M 
equation that mm t and P m must have the following form
m    SF R  P m  expm

Figure 1 The mass functions of SDSS centrals left panel and satellites right panel that
are observed in the SDSS split into blue and red populations as indicated plus the overall
population in black In each case the mass functions of the red plus overall populations that
are predicted on the basis of the observed blue population using the P10P12 formalism are shown
as continuous lines split in the case of satellites into the mass-quenched and satellite-quenched
components as the dashed lines These mass-functions provide an excellent representation of
the data The excess of high mass red central galaxies is interpreted as a modest amount of
mass-increase through merging after quenching Figure is taken from P12
24 The origin of the Schechter functions
The action of the mass-quenching described by Equation 22 not only maintains the
M of the single Schechter function of star-forming galaxies as it must by design but
it will also establish a precise Schechter shape starting from a more general power-law
mass-function of the right slope The mass function of the mass-quenched passive galaxies
also has a particularly simple form it too is a single Schechter function with exactly
the same M as the star-forming population but with a faint end slope that diers by
S  1    1 Given that M  for the star-forming population is observed to be
constant the M of the mass-quenched passive galaxies will also evolve with constant
M as the population builds up over time The continuity equation also requires that the
 of the two populations should increase in step with  M Q SF  1  SSF 1
The superposition of these dierent Schechter functions for the mass-quenched and
environment-quenched passive galaxies produces a double Schechter function for the
overall passive population The second component depends on environment and will
be absent in centrals Adding the star-forming population the overall population will
also be a double Schechter function Interestingly the strength of the two components
in this overall double Schechter function does not depend on the amount of environment
quenching and is given by the same relation as before  1S S  1S1
 25
These quantitative relations between the Schechter parameters are seen to impressive
precision within the SDSS sample as a function of environment P10 and for cen-
tralssatellites P12 see Figure 1 Not least the characteristic inection of the double
Schechter function due to the superposition of the red and blue populations is clearly
visible in the SDSS GAMA and zCOSMOS mass-functions Pozzetti et al 2010 P10
P12 Baldry et al 2012
25 Interpretation of mass-quenching
We stress that the  form of Equation 22 does not necessarily require that mass-
quenching is physically caused by star-formation or by stellar mass as sometimes as-
IAUS 295 The intriguing life of massive galaxies
sumed only that the quenching rate must mimic the mass- and time- dependencies of
the SFR in MS galaxies
Given the known observational similarities between SFR and black hole accretion in
galaxies Silverman 2009 quenching due to AGN activity could satisfy this requirement
Furthermore given the close coupling between mstar and mhalo for central galaxies the
second P m form could conceivably be connected to a limit in the mhalo that can
sustain star-formation in its central galaxy Note though that the M  of central and
satellite star-forming galaxies are essentially identical in SDSS P12 and that the satellite
M  is constant over 125  logMhaloM  15 see P12 so the mass-quenching
process must operate identically in centrals and in satellites over a very wide range of
halo mass Also the observation that the fred of centrals is correlated with halo mass at
xed stellar mass eg Woo et al 2012 does not necessarily imply a causal link between
quenching and halo mass as it can arise by the continued increase of halo mass but
not of stellar mass after a galaxy has been quenched see P12 Finally we stress that
mass-quenching need not be physically caused by stellar mass either - indeed it is clear
that morphology eg central mass density concentration or Sersic parameter is a better
predictor of the sSFR than mstar even though causal basis of this link is unclear The
only thing we know for sure is that mass-quenching must satisfy Equation 22
26 Quenching at higher redshifts
Densely sampled spectroscopic surveys like zCOSMOS and DEEP allow the construction
of group catalogues similar to those in SDSS at redshifts out to z  1 The sat appears
to be still independent of stellar mass at z  08 Knobel et al 2013 with a mean value
of sat  05 close to that seen in SDSS The mass functions of star-forming and passive
centrals and satellites at high z also follow the interrelations expected from the simple
P10P12 model The form of the mass- and environment- quenching eciencies look
similar the role of satellites in driving the latter appears to be the same and the form
of sat all seem to be consistent at z  08 with what is seen locally Kovac et al
in preparation We conclude that the action of the environment on satellite galaxies
appears to be rather similar when the Universe was a half its current age as today This
provides another interesting constraint on the physical processes involved
27 Overall evolution of the population
The action of the simple quenching laws is well seen in a movie that is available from
httpiopscienceioporg0004-637X7211193fulltextapj351504f13mov
At early times almost all galaxies are star-forming and the population evolves pri-
marily by increasing in mass at a rate given by the rsSFR of the population We call
this horizontal evolution of m as Phase 1 of the evolution As galaxies approach
what will become the characteristic M  mass-quenching becomes increasingly important
and starts to produce massive quenched galaxies The star-forming m stabilizes as a
single Schechter function if it is not one already and thereafter increases in  with con-
stant M SF  The mass-quenched passive population also increases in  at the same rate
with the same constant M  but dierent S This vertical evolution of m is Phase
2 Finally the quenching of satellite galaxies becomes important producing the second
component of passive galaxies which increasingly comes to dominate at lower masses We
call this Phase 3 although it proceeds in parallel with Phase 2 The transition between
Phase 1 and 2 is marked by the establishment of constant M SF and the appearance of
the rst massive passive galaxies and represents a divergence in evolution between the
overall galaxy and halo mass functions This probably occurs sometime around z  3  4
and quite possibly at dierent times in dierent large scale environments
S J Lilly et al
An important point is that the environment- or satellite- quenched population of
passive galaxies which dominates at lower galaxy masses emerges later compared to
the population of mass-quenched galaxies which dominate the higher masses around
M  The mass-quenching rate was twenty times higher at z  2 than now whereas
the environment-quenching rate has evolved more gradually as groups and clusters were
assembled This dierence accounts for a correlation between mean stellar age and stellar
mass for todays passive population as well as the over-abundance of -elements in the
more massive galaxies see P10 for details It also naturally accounts for the apparent
mass-dependent dierential build up of the passive population see Ilbert et al 2013
even though both channels individually build up the passive population independently
of mass These observational eects are both sometimes taken as a signature of a down-
sizing process but this is rather misleading since we are dealing with two distinct
processes proceeding at dierent rates
The continuity approach also claries two other widespread misconceptions It is clear
from the mass-functions that there is today a threshold mass above which most galaxies
are passive and below which most are still actively forming stars It is often assumed that
in order to produce todays massive passive galaxies in the early Universe this threshold
must have been shifted to higher masses at earlier times at variance with the observed
constant M Alternatively it is assumed that massive passive galaxies were generally
produced at lower masses and then moved to higher masses via widespread dry-merging
The continuity analysis emphasizes that both star-forming and passive populations have
very similar values of M and the dierent shapes of m come about purely from the
dierent S of the two populations that are themselves a result of the particular re-
quired form of the mass-quenching process The observed constant-shape star-forming
population can make all except the most massive of todays passive population directly
Finally the continuity formalism makes a clear prediction for the mass function of any
set of objects that are seen at some stage in the process of being quenched Even if they
are still actively forming stars these transition systems should have the same M  and
S of the passive population but a  given by the  of the star-forming population
multiplied by T  sSF R where T is the duration of the relevant phase of quenching
see Equation 28 of P10
3 Merging of galaxies
The merging of galaxies enters into the picture in at least two ways This is discussed
in Peng et al in preparation and also in the paper by Peng et al in these Proceedings
Here we very briey summarize the results for completeness
 Mass-addition after-quenching Substantial addition of stellar mass to passive
galaxies after they have been quenched would perturb the quantitative relations between
the Schechter functions of star-forming and passive galaxies outlined above This limits
the average mass increase for passive galaxies to be quite modest ie  25 for passive
galaxies generally and  35 for passive centrals
 Maintaining constant S If the slope of the sSFR-mass relation is negative then
low mass galaxies will increase in logarithmic mass faster than more massive ones po-
tentially producing a steepening of the mass function which is not seen The destruction
of low mass galaxies through merging provides an obvious way of countering this If we
dene a specic merger mass rate sM M R that is the mass increase of a galaxy through
merging with smaller galaxies as opposed to the in situ star-formation described by the
rsSFR then it turns out that an sMMR  01 sSFR will compensate for the steepening
eect of associated with   01 An obvious physical explanation for the apparent link
IAUS 295 The intriguing life of massive galaxies
between merging and cosmic sSFR is that both are being driven by the specic growth
rate of dark matter haloes as discussed further in Section 4 below The fact that both the
merger rate of galaxies and the specic star-formation rate follow the growth of haloes
produces the symmetry or simplicity of constant S in the overall population
 Merger quenching The introduction of merger-quenching as a potential quench-
ing channel in P10 was one of the few ad hoc aspects of that paper which we have now
claried If  is to remain more or less constant which was not imposed as a con-
dition in P10 then the  term in Equation 18 of P10 must have a specic form
    sSF R This link with  makes it attractive to view this term as
part of the general environment-quenching process which may or may not be linked
to merging per se rather than as a distinct third quenching channel
4 The evolution of cosmic star-formation rate haloes and metallicity
A similar phenomenological approach to star-forming galaxies also reveals linkages
between dierent aspects of galaxy evolution - namely the epoch dependence of the
characteristic sSFR of MS galaxies the chemical evolution of galaxies and the varying
eciencies with which dark matter haloes have converted gas into stars see Lilly et al
2013 hereafter L13 for details
We again start with a striking fact about the galaxy population The increase in the
sSFR of Main Sequence galaxies back to z  2 Noeske 2007 Daddi 2007 Elbaz 2007 and
Panella et al 2009 is very similar to the change in the specic mass increase rate of dark
matter haloes sMIRDM  over the same interval see Neistein  Dekel 2009 Above z  2
the situation becomes less clear Initial evidence for a more or less constant sSF Rz
Perez-Gonzalez et al 2009 has been disputed Stark et al 2012 Schaerer et al 2012
Note that we must use a reduced sSFR ie rsSF R  1  R  sSF R to give the
mass-doubling timescale of the long-lived stellar population see L13 These similarities
are shown in Figure 2 There are however important dierences in detail note that
the rsSFR for typical mass galaxies is is consistently signicantly higher especially at
high redshifts implying a shorter doubling time and that the weak mass-dependence is
reversed with DM  01 compared to   01 for star-formation
41 Gas-regulated evolution of galaxies
A very simple model for galaxies can be constructed see also Bouche et al 2010 in which
the star-formation rate in a galaxy is regulated by the gas content of the galaxy via some
star-formation eciency   SF Rmgas so that 1 is the gas depletion time-scale  1
This implies that the sSF R and the gas ratio   mgasmstar are linked by sSF R  
The star-formation may drive a wind   SF R where  is the mass-loading The inow
can be parameterized to be a fraction fgal of the baryonic inow into the halo If fgal
and the internal parameters  and  are all independent of time then this model has the
attractive feature of quickly setting and maintaining the rsSF R to be exactly equal to
the sM IRDM of the halo It does so by forming a constant fraction fstar of the inowing
baryons into stars - the actual fraction depending on  and the   sSF R product If
these parameters of the regulator change with time either directly or because they are
functions of the stellar mass then this equality will be perturbed as discussed below
For as long as the gas consumption timescale is shorter than the timescales on which
 and     sSF R are changing gas can be considered to be continuously owing
42 Chemical evolution
S J Lilly et al
Figure 2 Comparison of the specic growth rate of dark matter haloes sMIRDM in black
from simulations and of the stellar populations of galaxies given by the observed rsSFR in
red as a function of epoch for two particular masses 1010 and 10115 M respectively in the
left panel and as a function of mass at z  0 and z  2 in the right panel These curves show
the systematic oset of the sMIRDM to higher values shorter doubling times and the reversal
of the mass-dependence of the sM IR relative to the rsSFR The blue dashed curves show the
boosting of the rsSFR relative to the sM IRDM expected from the fstarm dependence - see
through the system The metallicity of the gas in this quasi-steady-state ow is given by
Z  Z0 
1  1  R1  1sSF R  1  R1dlndt
where Z0 is the metallicity of the inowing gas assumed to be small and yR is the yield
of metals per unit mass locked up in long-lived stars The metallicity of the system is to a
large degree set instantaneously by the regulator The only knowledge of the previous
history is in the small 1dlndt term As would be expected in a continuous ow
model Equation 41 can be written simply in terms of the fraction fstar of incoming
baryons that are transformed into stars
Z  Z0  yR  fstar
without knowledge of the quantities  and   1sSF R which actually set the value
of fstar These two Equations 41 and 42 highlight several inter-connections between
dierent aspects of galaxy evolution
43 The existence of SFR as a second parameter in the mass-metallicity relation
Equation 41 requires that the SFR should enter as a second parameter in the mass-
metallicity relation as has been claimed observationally in several papers Ellison 
Kewley 2008 Manucci et al 2010 Lara-Lopez et al 2010 Yates et al 2012 Furthermore
because the metallicity in the regulator is set instantaneously the Zm SF R relation
should only evolve with time in so far as the parameters  and  themselves change with
time Equation 41 provides a natural explanation for a more or less epoch-independent
fundamental Zm SF R relation eg Manucci et al 2010
IAUS 295 The intriguing life of massive galaxies
Figure 3 The mean mass-metallicity relation at z  2 blue and z  0 red The data is from
Mannucci et al 2010 and Erb et al 2004 - the latter adjusted by 03 dex see L13 for details
The simple model described in the text and given by Equation 41 qualitatively reproduces
the observed evolution which is primarily driven by the much higher sSFR at high redshift The
Figure is taken from L13
The derivation of gas-phase metallicities from emission line data is fraught with un-
certainties eg Kewley  Dopita 2002 and there has been a lot of debate as to the
form of the Zm SF R relation even at low redshift see eg Yates et al 2011 With
this signicant caveat in mind we can t Equation 41 to the SDSS Zm SF R data
tabulated by Mannucci et al 2010 and examine the recovered m and m For sim-
plicity yR and Z0 are assumed to be independent of mass Intriguingly the m and
m are not unreasonable from independent astrophysical arguments m implies a
total  atomicmolecular gas depletion timescale at m  1010M of 2-3 Gyr cf
Genzel et al 2010 Tacconni et al 2012 with a weak inverse mass dependence while the
nominal wind-loading factor at this mass is 03    05 with a quite strong inverse
dependence on stellar mass m08
Finally we can use Equation 41 to predict a mean mass-metallicity relation for MS
galaxies at z  2 assuming   1  z This is in good qualitative agreement with the
available data from Erb et al 2006 as shown in Figure 3
44 The stellar and dark matter content of haloes and the boost to the rsSFR
The product fstarfgal in this simple treatment gives the fraction of baryons that enter the
halo and are transformed into stars which integrated up will give mstarmhalo If we de-
ne  as the mass-dependence of this quantity fstarfgal  m
star then   05 is required
to reconcile the faint end slope of the galaxy stellar mass function Sstar  145 and
the low mass end slope of the dark matter halo mass function Shalo  185 From
Equation 42 the mean Zm of MS galaxies gives for constant yR the variation of
fstarm Estimates of the logarithmic slope of Zm at low masses range from Z  m035
Tremonti et al 2004 to Z  m05 Andrews  Martini 2012 Manucci et al 2010 This
simple analysis suggests that the mass-dependence of fstar that is implied from the mass-
metallicity relation of MS galaxies and therefore reecting baryonic processes operating
within galaxies may be sucient to produce the dependence of mstar on mhalo required
to reconcile the dierent faint end slopes - see also Peeples  Shankar 2012
S J Lilly et al
Secondly as noted above a constant fstarfgal in the regulator sets the rsSFR to be
exactly the sMIRDM  Conversely if fstarfgal increases with stellar mass then the rsSF R
will be boosted relative to the sM IRDM  Using the  parameter dened above this
boost to the rsSFR will be given by rsSF R  1  1sM IRDM  It can be seen that
the value of   05 that is indicated from the mass-metallicity relation and from the
abundance matching of mass-functions would give a boost of the rsSF R of a factor
of about two above the sM IRDM  This is about what is seen on Figure 2 especially
at lower redshifts This boost eect also explains the reversed mass-dependences of the
rsSFR relative to the underlying sMIRDM  because of the reduction in  associated with
the attening of the Zmstar relation
