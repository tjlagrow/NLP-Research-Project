Abstract
A generalization of the multiphase chemical evolution model applied to a wide
set of theoretical galaxies is shown This set of models has been computed by using
the so-called Universal Rotation Curve from Persic Salucci and Steel 1996 to
calculate the radial mass distributions of each theoretical galaxy By assuming that
the molecular cloud and star formation eciencies depend on the morphological
type of each galaxy we construct a bi-parametric grid of models whose results are
valid in principle for any spiral galaxy of given maximum rotation velocity or total
mass and morphological type

1 Introduction
There exist three important correlations Vila-Costas and Edmunds
1992 Oey and Kennicutt 1993 Zaritsky Kennicutt and Huchra 1994
Dutil and Roy 1999 among the observed characteristics of spiral and
irregular galaxies 1 The mass-metallicity relation the more lumi-
nous the galaxy the higher its abundance 2 The correlation between
abundance and morphological type earlier type galaxies have larger
abundances than later type ones and 3 The correlation between the
radial gradient of abundances and the morphological type The radial
gradient of abundances is larger for later type galaxies than for earlier
The problem appears when we see that the mass metallicity relation
seems to be the same for bright spirals and low-mass irregular galaxies
while the correlation between the radial gradient and the morpholog-
ical type has an eect on-o when the galaxy mass decreases or the
Hubble type changes to the latest irregulars the steep radial gradient
disappears and the abundance pattern becomes uniform for the whole
To study correlations with a large number of galaxies for which we
need a large number of models For that we build a bi-parametric
grid of theoretical models depending on the galaxy total mass and
morphological type

2 Ingredients of the multiphase chemical evolution model
The scenario of the multiphase model begins with a spheroidal proto-
galaxy sliced into cylindrical regions The gas of the protogalaxy has a
mass MR computed from the rotation curve VR which we take from
Persic Salucci and Steel 1996 to calculate radial mass distributions
MR for any value of the luminosity
This gas collapses onto the equatorial plane and forms out the disk
The infall rate is inversely proportional to a characteristic collapse time
scale which changes according to the total mass of the galaxy
colgal
colM W G
This implies that the characteristic collapse time scale colgal
longer for the less massive galaxies
There exist dierent phases of matter in each radial cylinder diuse
gas molecular clouds massive stars low and intermediate mass stars
and remnants The star formation in the halo follows a Schmidt law
In the disk the star formation has 2 steps molecular clouds are formed
from the diuse gas Then stars form through cloud-cloud collisions
and from the interaction between massive stars and molecular clouds
Every processes rates change along the galactocentric radius due to
the volume of each region through a proportionality coecient called ef-
ciency or probability Only the last described process does not change
with R being constant for all galaxies Moreover the eciency to form
stars in the halo is assumed as constant for all halos Thus only ef-
ciencies to form molecular clouds and to form stars from collisions
among these ones are variable for each galaxy
The initial mass function was taken from Ferrini Palla and Penco
1990 and the nucleosynthesis prescriptions are taken from Woosley
and Weaver 1995 for M  8M Renzini and Voli 1981 for stars
08M  m  8M and Iwamoto et al 1999 for SN-I
3 Model Results and Conclusion
We compute models for 44 radial mass distributions and 10 dierent
values of eciencies between 0 and 1 which are equivalent to 10 mor-
phological types for each one More details about models and results
are described in Molla Daz and Ferrini 2002
These models reproduce the 3 cited correlations as wee see in the
following two gures In Fig 1 the radial distributions of the oxygen
abundances given by 12  logOH are shown for 3 dierent rotation

Galactic Evolution
Figure 1 Radial of oxygen abundances for 3 dierent rotation velocities in kms1
as marked in each panel by assuming ten dierent evolutionary rates or eciencies
for each one of them These ten values represent ten morphological types from
T  1 the top solid line up T  10 the bottom line with squares cid3 as symbols
velocities as marked in panels Ten dierent evolutionary rates or e-
ciencies representing ten Hubble types from T  1 the top solid line
up T  10 the bottom line with squares cid3 as symbols are drawing
for each one of them
The more massive galaxies have strong abumndance radial gradients
only for the latest types T  6  9 except T  10 which is at while
the earliest ones have very at radial distributions The intermediate
mass galaxies show steep radial distributions for the intermediate types
T  4  8 the latest ones being rather at The less massive galaxies
have no gradients for types later than 7 all the others showing very
steep radial distributions The described behavior is in agreement with
the observed correlations It is also clear from the same Fig 1 that
a minimum level of abundances is around 75 dex which is the value
found in the less enriched HII regions
In Fig 2 panel a we represent the same oxygen abundances ob-
tained with our 440 models for every radial regions as a function of
the stellar magnitude of the same region computed by assuming a
ratio ML  1 These relation can not be exactly compared with
data panel b- which represent characteristic oxygen abundances vs
the magnitude of each galaxy that is integrated quantities for a given
galaxy instead the local characteristics represented by the models
However we can see that the correlation resulting from models have
the same behavior than observations

Therefore we conclude that our models follow adequately the ob-
served trend for spiral and irregular galaxies
