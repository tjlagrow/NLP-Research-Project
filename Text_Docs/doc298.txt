Abstract
We investigate the angular correlation function  of the galaxies detected in the 21m K -band
on 17 elds 1015 arcmin2 in total each containing a z  11 radio galaxy There is a signicant
detection of galaxy clustering at limits of K  20 with a  amplitude similar to that estimated by
Carlberg et al 1997 at K  215 The  amplitudes of these K-limited samples are higher than
expected from simple models which t the faint galaxy clustering in the blue and red passbands but
consistent with a pure luminosity evolution model if clustering is stable   0 and the correlation
function of early-type galaxies is steeper than that of spirals
We do not detect a signicant cross-correlation between the radio galaxies and the other galaxies on
these elds The upper limits on the cross-correlation are consistent with a mean clustering environment
of Abell class 0 for z  11 radio galaxies similar to that observed for radio galaxies at z  05 but would
argue against an Abell class 1 or richer environment As Abell 0 clustering around the radio galaxies
would not signicantly increase the  amplitude of galaxies on these elds stable clustering with a
steep r for ES0 galaxies appears to remain the most likely interpretation of the  amplitude
At K  20 the number of galaxy-galaxy pairs of 23 arcsec separations exceeds the random expec-
tation by a factor of 215  026 This excess of close pairs is comparable to that previously reported on
R-band data and suggests at least a tripling of the local merger rate at z  1
1 Introduction
The clustering of galaxies in 3D space can be described by their two-point correlation function r
which approximately follows the power-law
r z  
1  z3
where r0 is the correlation radius  the slope and  parameterizes the evolution of clustering Obser-
vations suggest   18 and for nearby eld galaxies Loveday et al 1995 estimate r0  44 h1Mpc
for spirals and irregulars h is H0 in units of 100 kms1Mpc1 and r0  59 h1Mpc for ES0 galaxies
There is still much uncertainty about the rate of clustering evolution  Stable clustering corresponds to
  0 while comoving clustering is   3    12 for   18 Clustering which collapses at the
rate at which the Universe expands is then   12 Models eg Colin Carlberg and Couchman 1997
and direct observations eg Le Fevre et al 1996 Shepherd et al 1997 Carlberg et al 1997 generally
span the 0    15 range
The clustering of galaxies on the sky is described by the angular correlation function  which
is a power-law of slope 1 and amplitude given by the Limbers formula integration of r z over
the galaxy redshift distribution N z The  amplitude is therefore sensitive to r0  and N z At
magnitude limits of B  235 the  amplitude was found to fall some  05 dex below the predictions
of models with   0 and no luminosity evolution for the galaxies eg Brainerd Smail and Mould
1995 Roche et al 1996a and references therein This was interpreted as evidence that N z at these
magnitudes is more extended than the non-evolving prediction indicating an evolutionary brightening of
L  L galaxies at higher redshifts but alternatively could mean that the intrinsic clustering of galaxies
was much weaker at early epochs ie   1 Spectroscopic observations eg Cowie et al 1995 1996
Steidel et al 1996 have now found many galaxies at z  13 and conrmed there is a brightening of the
galaxy L at these redshifts so the aim of studying faint galaxy clustering may now be changing from
its use as an indirect probe of N z towards the investigation of clustering evolution and the relation
between galaxy evolution and clustering environment
Recently it has become possible to observe suciently large areas in the 22m K-band to measure
the  amplitude for K-limited galaxy samples This may give dierent results from  analyses of
galaxies selected at shorter wavelengths as i K-limited surveys will contain a much higher proportion
of early-type galaxies and ii K-band observations are less sensitive to evolution of the star-formation
rate and so may be more useful in constraining  rather than the rate of L evolution Baugh et al
1996 measured  for galaxies on two large elds totalling 9 deg2 at limits of K  15 and K  16
and Carlberg et al 1997 obtained a  amplitude from a 27 arcmin2 area at a much deeper limit
of K  215 As part of a program to investigate radio galaxy evolution Eales et al 1997 we have
obtained K-band images of areas centred on 17 high redshift radio galaxies These images cover a total
of 1015 arcmin2 with galaxies reliably detected to K  20 and may provide an estimate of the 
amplitude at this intermediate limit However as some high redshift radio galaxies lie within rich galaxy
clusters eg Hill and Lilly 1991 we must consider the possible eect of the radio galaxies on 
We assume H0  50 km s1Mpc1 and q0  005 throughout In Section 2 of this paper we describe
the observational data and in Section 3 the detection and number counts of the galaxies Section 4
describes the measurement of the galaxy  and compares with models and previous observations
In Section 5 we investigate the clustering environment of the radio galaxies by cross-correlating with
the surrounding galaxies and also discuss the eects of the radio galaxies on 
In Section 6 we
investigate the numbers of close pairs of galaxies on these images using the methods of Woods et al
1995 which may provide information on merging In Section 7 we discuss the implications of these
results and summarize the main conclusions in Section 8
2 Observational Data
The observational dataset of this paper consists of images of 17 elds each centred on a high redshift
radio galaxy The radio galaxies were chosen from the 6C survey see eg Eales 1985 except for 5C68
which is a radio-loud QSO in the same redshift range Spectroscopic redshifts were obtained by Rawlings
et al 1997 for all but two of the radio sources giving zmean  112 for the observed 15
All these observations were made in the 21m K -band Wainscoat and Cowie 1992 rather than
the standard 22m K-band The rst 12 elds were observed over the period 1820 January 1995 using
the Redeye camera on the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope CFHT a 256  256 HgCdTe mosaic with a
pixelsize of 05 arcsec Each eld was imaged nine times with the camera being oset by 8 arcsec between
exposures in a 3  3 grid and total exposure times from 26 to 47 minutes per eld Seeing is estimated
as F W HM  0912 arcsec from stars on the reduced images These images were previously used in
studying the luminosity evolution Eales et al 1997 morphology and surface brightness evolution Roche
et al 1997b of the radio galaxies The second part of the data consists of a further 5 radio galaxy elds
observed using the Magic camera on the 35m Calar Alto Telescope which contains a similar detector
to that in the Redeye camera but here gives a larger pixelsize of 081 These ve elds were observed
in February 1997 for total exposure times of 40 to 66 minutes per eld The resolution is estimated as
F W HM  1619 arcsec ie a little poorer than for the Redeye data
Table 1 lists the positions of the radio galaxies with their names redshifts and K magnitudes as
measured from this data As our analysis will require at least approximate redshifts for all the radio
galaxies for the two objects not yet observed spectroscopically we estimate very approximate redshifts
from their K magnitudes and the best-tting model for the 6C galaxy K  z relation Eales et al 1997
These estimated redshifts and any quantities derived from them are shown on the tables as bracketed
numbers
3 Galaxy Detection and Number Counts
The Redeye images were initially processed using the IRAF package while the Magic images were
separately processed using MIDAS The stacked and at-elded images were analysed further using the
Starlink KAPPA and PISA packages On the Redeye images the shifting of the camera between exposures
produced regions at the edges with noticeably poorer signal-to-noise than the central areas so we used
only the central 224  224 pixel areas The total area of the 12 Redeye elds is then 418 arcmin2 On the
Magic images we used the full 256  256 pixel areas giving a total area for the 5 elds of 597 arcmin2
The full dataset of this paper covers 1015 arcmin2 Note that for the assumed cosmology 224 Redeye
pixels corresponds at z  1 to 118 Mpc and 256 Magic pixels to 219 Mpc
The Starlink PISA Position Intensity and Shape Analysis package developed by M Irwin P
Draper and N Eaton was used to detect and catalog the objects on each eld Our chosen detection
criterion was that an object must exceed an intensity threshold of 15 above the background noise 
being separately determined by PISA for each of the frames in at least 6 connected pixels on the Redeye
inages and 4 connected pixels on the Magic images Table 1 gives these detection thresholds in terms
of K mag arcsec2 PISA was run with the deblend option so that objects connected at the detection
threshold may be split if they are separate at a higher threshold
On the 12 Redeye images PISA detected a total of 1053 objects although 43 of these appeared
to be spurious detections caused by streaks on the images bright stars etc and were excluded from
the catalog There were a total of 1039 detections on the Magic images of which 11 were excluded as
obviously spurious To estimate uxes for the detected objects we used the total magnitudes option
within PISA which counts the photons above the background level in elliptical apertures tted to the
intensity prole of each individual detection
Observations of K-band standard stars provided photometric zero-points of K  2128 for 1 count
sec1 on the Redeye data and K  2190 for 1 count sec1 on the Magic data but due to the dierence
between the K and K  passbands these will only be exactly correct for objects with the same K   K as
the standard stars Radio galaxies at 1  z  14 will be redder than the calibration stars by an estimated
K   K  013 mag Eales et al 1997 as will early-type galaxies at similar redshifts which make up
a large part of the sample so these zero-points were adjusted by 013 mag for all detections Total K
magnitudes were estimated for all detected objects The radiogalaxies were identied on each image and
Table 1 lists their K magnitudes as measured from this data Star-galaxy separation was only possible to
K  17-18 On the 17 elds a total of 71 objects were classed as stars by eye and using size parameters
from PISA and fainter detections were assumed to be galaxies
Figure 1 shows the galaxy number counts derived from these 17 elds in K  05 mag bins
compared with some previously published K-band galaxy counts At 15  K  20 our number counts
are consistent with previous surveys perhaps a little higher than average Beyond K  19520 the
counts level out and begin to fall o as the detection becomes increasingly incomplete To K  20 a
total of 1357 galaxies are detected giving a surface density of 48130 deg2 This is within the range of
previous observations at this magnitude limit being higher than the 33710 deg2 in the Hawaii Deep
Survey Gardner Cowie and Wainscoat 1993 but slightly lower than the 52000 deg2 in the smaller but
deeper survey of Moustakas et al 1997 The counts are also compared with two models based on the
spectral evolution models of Charlot and Bruzual 1993 and computed in the K-band The non-evolving
model is that described in Roche et al 1996b the pure luminosity evolution PLE model has the same
zero-redshift luminosity functions but with luminosity evolution derived from the SLE model of Roche
et al 1997a The counts show some indication of an excess over the non-evolving model but there
is much scatter between the dierent observations so that both models may be consistent with current
4 The Galaxy Angular Correlation Function 
41 Calculating 
The galaxy-galaxy angular correlation function gg was calculated following the methods of Roche
et al 1996a Each of the 17 elds was analysed separately with no distinction made between the radio
If Ng is the number of galaxies on a eld brighter than a chosen
galaxies and the other galaxies
magnitude limit there will be 1
2 NgNg  1 possible galaxy-galaxy pairs The separations of all these
pairs are counted in bins of width log   02 We placed 10000 points randomly over the eld area
and similarly counted the galaxy-random pairs taking the real galaxies as the centres The angular
correlation function gg is then calculated as
ggi 
Nggi
Ngri
Ng  1
where Nggi  number of galaxy-galaxy pairs in bin i Ngri  number of galaxy-random pairs in bin
i and Nr  number of random points 10000 here The integral constraint an eect caused by the nite
eld sizes causes the observed  to be negatively oset from the true correlation function T  by
a constant equal to T  doubly integrated over the eld area 
C  Z Z T d1d2
Assuming T   A08 where A is the power-law amplitude at one degree C  360A for the Redeye
elds and C  220A for the Magic elds so that the observed  corresponds to A08  360 and
A08  220 respectively
The individual eld  were averaged to give mean  for the Redeye and Magic data These are
shown on Figure 2 with eld-to-eld errors at magnitude limits of K  195 200 and 205 the result
for the deepest limit may be less reliable due to incompleteness
The  from the Redeye data shows a positive signal down to smaller separations 20    32
arcsec than that from the Magic data which is only positive down to 32    50 arcsec This is
presumably due to the dierence in resolution The  amplitude of the Redeye data was estimated by
tting a function A08  360 over the 20    126 arcsec range of separations using least-squares
tting weighted with the eld-to-eld errors The error on A was estimated from the eld-to-eld scatter
in the amplitudes derived by tting to  of the individual elds The correlation function of the Magic
data galaxies falls below zero at larger separations suggesting that it is aected by sensitivity gradients
so we estimate A by tting A08  220 over just the 32    80 arcsec range
Table 2 gives the correlation function amplitudes estimated from the two datasets with an error-
weighted combined value When all our data is combined galaxy clustering is detected with at least
 4 signicance at these magnitude limits
42 Interpretation of 
Figure 3 shows the combined  amplitudes from this data and those from other K-limited galaxy
surveys as a function of K limit Baugh et al 1996 investigated the galaxy  at relatively shallow
limits of K  15 and K  16 on two NEP and NGP elds totalling 9 deg2 where it appeared consistent
with a 08 power-law out to   1 degree and its amplitude was estimated by tting this power-law
at 18    216 arcsec Carlberg et al 1997 measured the galaxy clustering at a much deeper limit
of K  215 on a much smaller area of 27 arcmin2 over angular scales of approximately 15    150
arcsec We plot their result without their rather large correction for star contamination as this may be an
overestimate being based on the proportion of stars at brighter magnitudes and as no such correction
has been applied to our results
Our  amplitudes are much lower than those at K  1516 but consistent with the K  215
result We compare these results with four models
A Our non-evolving model with   0 r0  59 h1 Mpc for ES0 galaxies and r0  44 h1 Mpc
for later types from Loveday et al 1995 the geometric mean r0  51 h1 Mpc for the cross-correlation
between the two see Roche et al 1996a and an additional weighting term giving more luminous
MB  205 galaxies twice the strength of clustering as galaxies of lower luminosity as estimated by
Loveday et al 1995
B Our PLE model with   0 This predicts lower  amplitudes at fainter limits due to the more
extended galaxy N z Figure 4 shows the N z predicted by the PLE model for K  20 This has a
mean redshift zmean  109 similar to that of the radio galaxies and a 475 fraction of ES0 galaxies
which is much higher than in a B-limited sample of similar depth eg Figure 15 of Roche et al 1996a
This model is successful in tting the  scaling in the blue and red passbands Roche et al 1996a
C The PLE model with clustering becoming weaker in the past at a rate   12 a rate of clustering
evolution towards the maximum of the observed and predicted range see Introduction
D The PLE model with   0 and a higher normalization and and steeper slope for the r of
early-type galaxies Guzzo et al 1997 estimate r0  835  075 h1 Mpc and   205  009 for the
clustering of giant MB  215 approx ES0 galaxies Model D adopts this higher estimate with
the same spiral galaxy clustering as the other models dwarfs half as clustered as giant galaxies and the
geometric mean r0  58h1 Mpc and   1925 for the ES0-spiral cross-correlation Relative to model
B the stronger ES0 clustering makes little dierence  10 to  at   1 degree but greatly
increases  at very small separations We plot the amplitude which would be measured at   5
arcsec if a 08 power-law is assumed This should be approximately valid for comparison with our
results and those of Carlberg et al 1997 but should not be compared with the Baugh et al 1996
results which were measured at larger separations
The non-evolving model A gives a  amplitude consistent with our result but may slightly over-
predict the amplitude at K  160 and underpredict it at K  215 However there is evidence for
luminosity evolution from spectroscopy Cowie et al 1996 which conrms that many 19  K  20
galaxies are at 1  z  2 as in our PLE models Considering the evolving models model B ts the
 amplitude at K  16 but underpredicts at K  195 At K  20 our measured amplitude of
1333  232  104 exceeds the model B prediction of 57  104 by  3 so the discrepancy is signi-
cant especially when the Carlberg et al 1997 result is also considered Model C greatly underpredicts
the observed amplitudes arguing against any model in which clustering is much weaker in the past ie
  1 In model D the stronger ES0 clustering increases the  amplitude at   5 arcsec by  04
dex so that it is at least as high as our observed values
These results suggest that the  scaling in the K-band is consistent with a L evolution model
which also ts the galaxy counts if i clustering is approximately stable and ii the  and r0 of the
ES0 galaxy r are closer to the high Guzzo et al 1997 estimates However we must also consider in
Section 5 below the alternative possibility that clusters around the radio galaxies on these elds produce
an enhancement of the galaxy 
5 Clustering Associated with the Radio Galaxies
51 Introduction
It is possible that some of the detected galaxies belong to rich clusters centred on the radio galaxies
Within rich clusters the amplitude of r may be much higher than for eld galaxies The strength
of clustering at 1 Mpc separations can also be parameterized as Bgg equivalent to r
0  For H0  50
km s1Mpc1 and   18 the Loveday et al 1995 estimates of the eld galaxy r0 correspond to
Bgg  850 for ES0s and Bgg  501 for spirals whereas the average Bgg is estimated as 289 693
and 990 for Abell class 0 1 and 2 clusters respectively Prestage and Peacock 1988 1989 We consider
the galaxy clustering around the radio galaxies in terms of a 3D radiogalaxy-galaxy cross-correlation
function assumed to have the same form as r with an amplitude Brg If the radio galaxies lie within
rich clusters Brg will be similar to Bgg in the cluster cores
At low redshifts Longair and Seldner 1979 found a mean Brg of only 48  54 for FRII emission
line radio galaxies while Prestage and Peacock 1988 1989 found a mean Brg of 132  43 indicating an
environment similar to that of randomly chosen eld galaxies The radio galaxies on these 17 elds are all
luminous FRII sources so if their environment is similar to that of their low-redshift counterparts they
would randomly sample the galaxy distribution and their presence would have no eect on the galaxy

However at higher redshifts many FRII galaxies do lie in rich clusters Yates Miller and Peacock
1989 found that a mean Bgr  101  43 for powerful radio galaxies at 015  z  035 increased to
Bgr  252  81 for those at 035  z  082 and Hill and Lilly 1991 conrmed this with a larger sample
nding a mean richness corresponding to Bgg  291  45 Abell class 0 for high-luminosity radiogalaxies
at 035  z  055 Yee and Green 1987 found that the mean cross-correlation of radio-loud QSOs with
surrounding galaxies increased from Bqg  161  80 for 10 QSOs at 03  z  05 to Bqg  543  142
Abell class 0-1 for 9 at 055  z  065 Yee and Ellingson 1993 suggested that these observations
can be explained if the luminosity of radio sources in clusters evolves much more rapidly   1 Gyr out
to z  06 than that of their eld counterparts
If the z  11 radio galaxies on these elds lie in clusters we might expect to see both an enhanced
 amplitude for the galaxies and a clustering of galaxies near the radio galaxy positions However
both these eects will be greatly diluted by the presence of non-cluster galaxies as we consider below
52 Calculating rg
We calculate a radiogalaxy-galaxy cross-correlation function rg for each of the 17 elds by
summing the number of K  20 galaxies and the number of random points in annular bins of width
log   02 centred on the radiogalaxy The cross-correlation function is then calculated as
rg 
Nggi
Ngri
where Nggi  number of radiogalaxy-galaxy pairs in bin i Ngri  number of radiogalaxy-random
pairs in bin i and Nr  number of random points 10000 here
Figure 5 shows a mean cross-correlation function with eld-to-eld errors obtained by averaging
rg for all 17 elds with equal weighting for each eld This will be negatively oset by an integral
constraint which for the assumed power-law rg  Arg08 can be estimated by the single integration
over the eld area
C  Z Arg08d
giving C  408A for the Redeye elds and C  253A for the Magic elds For the mean rg of the 17
elds we assumed a mean integral constraint C  362A and t Arg08 362 over the 32    796
arcsec range of separations An error is estimated by performing separate ts for each individual eld
with the appropriate integral constraints and nding the scatter in the individual eld amplitudes
At K  200 we estimate Arg  921  1582  104 for the 17 radio galaxies There is no detection
of a signicant signal
53 Interpretation
This result is interpreted by modelling the expected cross-correlation as a function of Brg using
methods similar to Hill and Lilly 1991 Assuming a radiogalaxy-galaxy cross-correlation with   18
and   0 we calculate
i The ratio of the amplitude Acl of the angular correlation function of the cluster galaxies at one degree
to the amplitude of their two-point correlation function at 1 Mpc Brg Limbers formula integration
evaluated at the cluster redshift only gives
Acl  3679
08dAz08 dr
zBgr1  z3
where dAz is the angular diameter distance at the radio galaxy redshift and dr
distance with respect to redshift This gives Acl
dz the derivative of proper
 174  105 at z  1 decreasing slowly with redshift
ii K  20 the number density per unit volume of galaxies which would be brighter than K  20 in
apparent magnitude in our PLE model at the radio galaxy redshift for a mean eld density of galaxies
Our model gives K  20  21  103Mpc3 at z  1 decreasing steeply with redshift eg by a
factor of  4 to z  18
iii The integral Irg of the two-point radiogalaxy-galaxy cross-correlation function rgr z over the
eld area centred on the radio galaxy and along the line of sight to the observer This is
Irg  Brg Z Z r181  z3ddz
where d represents the integration over the eld area centred on the radio galaxy and dz the integration
over redshift in both cases using units of Mpc We estimate Irg  11Brg for the Redeye elds and
Irg  22Brg for the Magic elds with only a weak dependence on redshift
The mean number of K  20 galaxies in each radio galaxy cluster Ncl can be then estimated as
Ncl  1  K  20Irg where the addition of 1 accounts for the radio galaxy itself
The amplitude of the angular cross-correlation between the radio galaxies and the surrounding galax-
ies on the images Arg will be lower than Acl due to dilution by non-cluster foreground and background
galaxies If the total number of K  20 galaxies detected on a eld is NT  Arg  Ncl
Acl For this data
we estimate Ncl
 40  104Brg only  013 if the mean Brg is similar to the estimates at z  05
Both Ncl and Acl depend on Brg so the observed cross-correlation becomes
1  K  20Irg
Averaging our estimates of these quantities for all 17 elds
Arg  300  107Brg  675  109B2
which is plotted on Figure 6a Our best-tting Arg corresponds to Brg  348 consistent with the
same mean clustering environment as estimated Hill and Lilly 1991 for radio galaxies at 035  z  055
As there was no signicant signal in the cross-correlation our results give no lower limit on Brg but do
give estimated 1 and 2 upper limits of Brg  587 and Brg  756 so appear to disfavour a richer mean
clustering environment of Abell class 12
The eect of clustering around radio galaxies on the galaxy  will be subject a more complex
dilution proportional to the square of the fraction of non-cluster galaxies If the  amplitude of the
eld galaxies is Af and we neglect any cross-correlation between the eld and cluster galaxies reasonable
as only a very small proportion of the eld galaxy N z will overlap with the cluster
2Acl  1 
Figure 6b shows a model for the mean A on these elds as a function of Bgr assuming Af  57  104
at K  20 from the   0 PLE model This model suggest the  amplitude will be insensitive to
Abell class 0 clustering around the radio galaxies but stronger clustering of Brg  400 will begin to
make an impact The dierence between the observed  at K  20 and the PLE prediction could be
accounted for a mean Brg  66453
62 although this is only marginally consistent with the upper limits
on the radiogalaxy-galaxy cross-correlation The  amplitude would in itself set a 2 upper limit of
Brg  762
In summary the observations are consistent with a mean clustering environment of Abell class 0 for
6C radiogalaxies at z  11 but may argue against Abell class 1 or richer clustering At this point we
cannot exclude the possibility that the high galaxy  amplitude relative to our model B is the result of
strong clustering around the radio galaxies but this hypothesis is not favoured We discuss this further
in Section 7
6 Counting Close Pairs of Galaxies
61 Introduction
We now consider the numbers of very close pairs of galaxies on these images ie pairs which are likely
to be physically interacting Yee and Ellingson 1995 investigating the 3D clustering of spectroscopically
observed r  215 zmean  038 eld galaxies estimated that 85 belonged to interacting pairs of
physical separation r  20 h1 kpc Similarly Patton et al 1997 estimated that 71  14 of the
galaxies in a larger zmean  033 survey were in physical pairs of separation r  20 h1 kpc compared
to 43  03 locally
This excess of close galaxy pairs has also been seen in the  of non-spectroscopic surveys Infante
et al 1996 found that the  of 19  R  215 galaxies zmean  035 followed a double 08
power-law with a higher amplitude at   6 arcsec r  19 h1kpc at the mean redshift than at larger
scales The number of galaxy pairs at 2    6 separation exceeded the random expectation by a factor
of 1637 and exceeded the number expected from an inward extrapolation of the larger scale  by
1361 It was estimated from this that 1004  017 of the galaxies were in 2    6 arcsec pairs after
subtracting the random expectation Subtracting the extrapolated  prediction would reduce this to
64 which might better represent the fraction of merging galaxies
The  from our much smaller survey Figure 2 might suggest an excess over the tted 08
power-law at 2    32 arcsec for the Redeye data only although only of 12 signicance However
we can apply a statistically more powerful test for an excess of close pairs which makes optimal use of the
magnitude information Woods et al 1995 describe a method in which a probability P of occurring by
chance in a random distribution of galaxies is calculated for each galaxy-galaxy pair The probability
is estimated as
exp2d
P  Z 
where  is the surface density of galaxies brighter in apparent magnitude than the fainter galaxy of the
pair  is the pair separation and  an angular separation cut-o below which individual objects cannot
be resolved Woods et al 1995 counted the numbers of P  005 and P  010 pairs on a ground-based
CCD image with 869 galaxies of 21  I  24 but did not nd a signicant excess above the random
expectation although Burkey et al 1994 did nd an excess when applying this technique to HST data
of similar depth
We apply this method to our K  20 galaxies considering the Redeye and Magic data separately
Rather than sum 2 to estimate the area around each galaxy we place 50000 random points on the
image areas and sum the number of points at      thus taking into account the reduced areas
around galaxies near the edges We adopt   10 arcsec our catalog contains no pairs of smaller
separation calculate P for each pair of galaxies and count all P  005 and P  010 pairs in   1
arcsec bins of separation
To estimate the number of pairs expected by chance 100 randomized datasets were generated in
which the galaxies retain their true magnitudes but are randomly positioned within each eld An
identical pair count analysis was performed on the randomized datsets and the results averaged with the
scatter between the simulations used to derive the 1 noise errors of a single random dataset

Figure 7 shows histograms of the observed numbers of P  005 and P  010 pairs with the random
expectations and error bars A signicant excess above random of close pairs is seen only on the Redeye
data and only at 2    3 arcsec  1016 h1 kpc at the mean redshift With a P  005 threshold
we count 21 pairs of 2    3 arcsec on the Redeye elds compared to 976  297 expected by chance
a 38 signicance excess of 1124  297 pairs or a factor of 215  026 With a P  010 threshold we
count 27 pairs at this separation compared to 1419  367 expected by chance giving a slightly increased
number of excess pairs 1281  367 but at a slightly lower signicance of 35 There is no increase in
the number of excess pairs on moving the magnitude limit further faintward presumably as a result of
incompleteness at K  20 All the P  005 pairs were examined by eye and found to be genuine close
pairs of galaxies rather than for example fragmented noise images
The Redeye elds contain 529 galaxies at K  20 so we estimate that 425  112 belong to
P  005 pairs in excess of the random expectation Clustering with a 08 power-law of amplitude  at
one arcsec would increase the number of 2    3 arcsec pairs above the random expectation by a factor
of 1  048 The observed pair excess indicates   24  06 which extrapolates to A  34  09  103
at one degree This exceeds the tted  amplitude at K  20 by a factor of  34141  24 and
 22 Hence there is some evidence that our data shows a similar enhancement in the  amplitude
at scales corresponding to r  20 h1 kpc as the larger Infante et al 1996 survey
Some very close galaxy pairs will be missed as the images are merged into a single detection The
close pair counts and  suggest that faint galaxy pairs are only reliably split on our Redeye data if
the projected separation is exceeds 2 arcsec whereas on the Magic data a separation of 3 arcsec may
If the true correlation function follows a 08 power-law at   3 arcsec the number
be required
of   2 arcsec pairs will exceed the random expectation of 1188 for the Redeye data by a factor of
096 If we assume that all pairs were detected at 2    3 arcsec the value of  estimated at this
separation would indicate that there are a further 096  1188  24  06  274  72 excess pairs at
  2 arcsec which are merged on our images If this is the case the true fraction of galaxies belonging
to   3 arcsec pairs above the random expectation is  146  38 As the excess of 2    3 arcsec
pairs above the random expectation exceeded that expected from the tted  power-law by a factor
 34141  24 we estimate the fraction of galaxies in close pairs in excess of the larger scale  as
1424  146  38  85  22
7 Discussion
On K-band data covering 1015 arcmin2 to K  20 we detect galaxy clustering at the  4 level of
signicance The amplitude of this clustering appears to be a factor of  2 greater than predicted by a
PLE model with r0  59 h1 Mpc and   18 for ellipticals despite the good t of this model to the
 scaling in the red and blue passbands Roche et al 1996a and the  amplitude at K  1516
from Baugh et al 1996 We considered two possible explanations
i The r of the early-type galaxies especially prominent in K-limited samples is signicantly steeper
than   18 Increasing the giant ES0 galaxy r in our PLE model to r0  825h1 Mpc with   205
as estimated by Guzzo et al 1997 increased the predicted K  20 galaxy  at   5 arcsec more
than enough for consistency with our observations provided that galaxy clustering is approximately
stable out to z  2 This steeper r would have less eect on the  measured on larger scales on
large K-band images eg Baugh et al 1996 or on any blue and red limited surveys where the fraction
of ellipticals will be much smaller so should be consistent with these observations
ii The trend towards more clustered environments for higher redshift radio galaxies might continue
beyond z  05 to reach Brg  700 at z  11 This would mean that  30 of the K  20 galaxies
on our images belong to rich clusters associated with the radio galaxies and would increase the model B
 amplitude to at least the observed value without any change in the assumed clustering properties
of eld galaxies
Although with this data we cannot rmly distinguish between these possibilities there are a number
of arguments favouring the rst
i We did not detect a signicant cross-correlation between the radio galaxies on these elds and the
surrounding K  20 galaxies obtaining upper limits which disfavour the Abell 12 clustering required
to signicantly increase the galaxy  amplitude
ii Ellingson and Green 1993 propose that radio sources in clusters undergo more rapid luminosity
evolution out to z  06 than eld sources but nd that at higher redshifts the source number counts
would constrain the evolution of eld and cluster radio galaxies to be similar If this is the case the mean
Brg at z  06 is likely to remain close to the Abell class 0 value seen by Hill and Lilly 1991
iii The deeper K  215 survey of Carlberg et al 1997 was not known to contain any radio galaxies
yet gave a relatively high  amplitude similar to that from our data and even more discrepant from
model B
iv When Carlberg et al 1997 divided the 03  z  09 galaxies in their K  20 redshift survey at
the median U  K colour the redder subsample galaxies gave a r of both a much higher amplitude
and a steeper slope closer to   22 than   18 than the bluer galaxies which were consistent with
  18
It is also apparent that the high  amplitudes measured here and by Carlberg et al
are more consistent with approximately stable   0 small-scale galaxy clustering than with the rapid
evolution   15 suggested by some observers eg Shepherd et al 1997 The low r amplitudes
measured from R or I limited redshift surveys Le Fevre et al 1996 Shepherd et al 1997 would then
be indicative of weak intrinsic clustering for very blue galaxies rather than a general rapid clustering
evolution Stable clustering is consistent with   02 simulations whereas   1 is expected for   1
models Colin Carlberg and Couchman 1997
The Carlberg et al 1997  amplitude of 114  16  104 exceeds even the model D prediction
and may suggest a levelling out of the scaling at K  195 This contrasts with  results obtained
in the red-band where at R  26 Brainerd Smail and Mould 1995 and on the Hubble Deep Field at
R  28 Villumsen et al 1997 the  amplitude falls much further to  2  104 This would suggest
that the galaxies with the reddest observer-frame R  K colours ie passively evolving galaxies seen at
z  075 are intrinsically very strongly clustered perhaps even more so than local ellipticals This might
be expected from the models of Bagla 1987 which predict that at high redshifts z  3 the highest
peaks in the density eld would be much more clustered than the underlying mass distribution These
peaks would be the rst sites for galaxy formation and would form elliptical rather than spirals Balland
Silk abd Schaeer 1997 Hence a rst generation of early-type galaxies completing its star-formation
prior to z  3 and becoming very red in R  K at z  12 should be more strongly clustered than other
galaxies
A population of very red galaxies begins to enter surveys at K  185 Djorgovski et al 1995 
Cowie et al 1996 Moustakos et al 1997 so if strongly clustered may rst produce an impact on 
 an upturn relative to the standard models  at the depths of this survey However deep imaging of a
much larger area in K and R will be needed to conrm whether these high redshift red galaxies are really
more clustered than local ellipticals
The mean clustering environment of z  1 radio galaxies remains undetermined except that a
mean environment richer than Abell class 1 appears to be disfavoured However at a given redshift
the environments of individual radio galaxies may dier greatly see Hill and Lilly 1991 Yee and Green
1987 Deltorn et al 1997 have conrmed by spectroscopy that at least one radio galaxy 3CR184 in
this redshift range is in a rich Abell 2 cluster Bowes and Smail 1997 detected gravitational lensing
centred on another radio galaxy 3C336 at z  0927 indicating the presence of a massive cluster but
could only set upper limits on the clustering around 7 other 3C sources at z  1 Allington-Smith et
al 1982 had previously imaged areas centred on 8 of the 17 galaxies in our sample with a red-band
CCD and found marginal 090099 condence evidence of surface density enhancements around four
6C082239 6C112937 6C121736 and 6C125636 and for 2 of the radio galaxies 6C101136 and
6C125636 our tted radiogalaxy-galaxy cross-correlation amplitudes are as high as  001 although
with large errors and the  amplitudes on these elds are also higher than average 2432103
and consistent with Abell 2 clustering around these 2 galaxies only
At these high redshifts it is likely that further data such as observations in more than one passband
to colour-select galaxies near the radio galaxy redshift multi-bre spectroscopy or the detection of lensing
or extended X-ray sources will be needed to conrm the existence of clusters Considering the observations
made so far and the likelihood that radio galaxy evolution is less dependent on cluster environment at
z  05 Yee and Ellingson 1993 it is most plausible that these 17 radio galaxies have a Brg distribution
similar to that of radio galaxies at z  05 Hill and Lilly 1991 with one or two in Abell 1-2 clusters but
the great majority in eld or Abell 0 environments
Finally on the Redeye data we nd a signicant excess of close 2    3 arcsec pairs of galaxies
above the random expectation and above an inwards extrapolation of the tted  power-law This
close pair excess is similar to size a factor of  2 above random and in the corresponding range of
physical separations r  20h1 kpc to that reported by Yee and Ellingson 1995 Infante et al 1996
and Patton et al 1997 on red-band data No close-pair excess was seen on the Magic elds which
suggests that close pair counts depend critically on the resolution of the data This might explain the
dierence between the results of Burkey at al 1994 and Woods et al 1995 and the wide variation in
other close-pair studies see eg Neuschaefer et al 1997
After applying a correction for the number of close pairs missed due to image merging we estimated
that 146  38 of the K  20 galaxies on the Redeye elds belonged to close pairs in excess of the
expectation for a random distribution and that 85  22 belonged to pairs in excess of the expectation
from the tted  We estimate the enhancement in the number of close pairs above the random
expectation as a factor of 215  026 compared with 1637 seen by Infante et al 1996 at zmean  035
If the merger rate increases with redshift as 1  zm and our sample has zmean  109 209135m 
215  0261637 giving a very rough estimate of m  135  050 Comparing with a local estimate of
45 for the fraction of galaxies at projected separations of r  20h1 kpc Yee and Ellingson 1995 our
results suggests that the galaxy merger rate at zmean  109 is  14645  32 times its local value so
that 209m  146  3845 and therefore m  160  036
As a K-band sample will not be biased towards starbursting objects this evolution cannot be due
to mergers producing more luminous starbursts at earlier epochs but must reect a real increase in
the merger frequency with redshift The increase appears relatively modest compared to the m  4
predicted by some   1 models Carlberg Pritchet and Infante 1994 but does seem consistent with
the surprisingly low Neuschaefer et al 1997 estimate of m  12  04 from similarly deep I  25
HST data and the m  2 predicted by low  models
8 Summary of Main Conclusions
i Signicant galaxy clustering was detected on ground based K-band images of 17 elds totalling
1015 arcmin2 containing z  1 radio galaxies Fitting a 08 power law the  amplitude at one
degree was estimated as 133  032  103 at K  20
ii The  amplitudes at K  20 are consistent with that estimated by Carlberg et al 1997
at K  215 but higher than predicted by the Roche et al 1996 PLE model known to t the faint
galaxy clustering in blue and red passbands These results remain consistent with a PLE model if the
clustering of giant ellipticals is similar to the Guzzo et al 1997 estimate r0  835 h1 Mpc   205
and galaxy clustering is stable out to z  2
iii We did not detect a signicant cross-correlation between the z  1 radio galaxies and the
surrounding galaxies and obtained a 1 upper limit of Brg  587 consistent with the same mean clustering
environment Abell class 0 as that of radio galaxies at z  05 This would argue against but not rmly
exclude an Abell class 12 or richer environment As Abell class 0 clustering would have little eect on
the galaxy  a steep r for ES0 galaxies remains the most likely explanation for its high amplitude
iv On the Redeye elds the number of galaxy-galaxy pairs of 2    3 separation exceeds the
random expectation by a factor of 215  028 more than expected from the tted angular correlation
function This close pair excess is comparable to that previously reported on R-band data Infante et al
1996 and suggests that the merger rate at z  1 is about three times the local rate
