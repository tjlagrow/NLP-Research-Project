ABSTRACT
Luminosity function of cluster galaxies provides a fundamental constraint on galaxy evolu-
tion in cluster environments By using the bright member galaxies of a large sample of rich
clusters identied from Sloan Digital Sky Survey we obtain the bright end of composite lu-
minosity functions of cluster galaxies and study their dependence on cluster dynamical state
After a redshift-evolution correction of absolute magnitude the luminosity function of mem-
ber galaxies can be well tted by a Schechter function when the brightest cluster galaxies
BCGs are excluded The absolute magnitudes of BCGs follow a Gaussian function with a
characteristic width of about 036 mag We nd that the luminosity function of galaxies in
more relaxed clusters has a fainter characteristic absolute magnitude M and these clus-
ters have fewer bright non-BCG member galaxies but a brighter BCG Our results suggest
the co-evolution of galaxy population with cluster dynamical state and somewhat support the
hierarchical formation scenario of the BCGs

1 INTRODUCTION
function Schechter 1976
Clusters of galaxies are the most massive bound systems in the uni-
verse which were formed hierarchically by accretion and merger
of smaller sub-clusters and groups eg Colberg et al 1999 They
are important laboratories to investigate the formation and evolu-
tion of galaxies in dense environment Butcher  Oemler 1984
Goto et al 2003 Gao et al 2004 De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 The
population of cluster galaxies in the local universe is dominated
by red sequence galaxies The hierarchical and the passive evolu-
tion models are two important scenarios on the evolution of cluster
galaxies The hierarchical model eg De Lucia et al 2006 pre-
dicts that more massive cluster galaxies have a history of earlier star
formation and later stellar mass assembly About the half of stellar
mass in the most massive galaxies is assembled at a redshift of
z  08 through merger process In contrast the passive evolution
model implies that cluster galaxies were formed in a rapid starburst
at very early time of the universe and evolved later without any
star formation and merger De Propris et al 1999 De Propris et al
2007 Luminosity function of cluster galaxies provides a funda-
mental constraint on galaxy evolution in cluster environments eg
Lin et al 2006 Crawford et al 2009 Ribeiro et al 2013
In general the luminosity function of galaxies in clusters is
dened as being the number density of galaxies per absolute magni-
tude as a function of luminosity which can be tted by a Schechter

where  is the faint-end slope M is the characteristic absolute
magnitude and  is the normalization factor The luminosity of
the brightest cluster galaxy BCG in each cluster is very different
from other cluster galaxies The luminosity distribution of a sample
of BCGs follows a Gaussian function Hansen et al 2005 2009
De Filippis et al 2011
To understand galaxy evolution in cluster environments many
efforts have been made to search for the changes of galaxy lumi-
nosity functions with the properties of whole clusters eg redshift
cluster mass and dynamical state or member galaxies Clusters
with a cD galaxy have a signicantly different galaxy luminosity
function from spiral-rich clusters Oemler 1974 The luminosity
function of galaxies in rich clusters has a brighter M and a steeper
 than that in poor clusters eg Lin et al 2004 Hansen et al
2005 Galaxy population and the luminosity function vary with
distance to the cluster center eg Hansen et al 2005 and the value
of  is steeper in the outer region than that in the central region
De Filippis et al 2011 The luminosity function of early-type
galaxies has a atter  than that of late-type galaxies Goto et al
2002 Muzzin et al 2007 The  value for red cluster galax-
ies at high redshifts may be eg De Lucia et al 2004 Toft et al
2004 Stott et al 2007 Rudnick et al 2009 or may be not eg
Crawford et al 2009 Mancone et al 2012 De Propris et al 2013
Z L Wen and J L Han
smaller than that for local cluster galaxies Simple pure pas-
sive evolution was claimed by comparing luminosity functions
of galaxies in clusters up to redshift z  1 De Propris et al
1999 De Propris et al 2007 Lin et al 2006 Crawford et al 2009
which is inconsistent with the hierarchical model
Many clusters have experienced recent merger and show an
unrelaxed dynamical state eg Bohringer et al 2010 Wen  Han
2013 Relaxed clusters may have fewer bright member galaxies
than unrelaxed clusters Dressler 1978 Barrena et al 2012 How-
ever there is no consensus on the possible relation between galaxy
luminosity distributions and cluster dynamical states Galaxy lu-
minosity functions of some individual merging clusters can not
be described by a single Schechter function but by a double
Schechter function eg A209 and A168 Mercurio et al 2003
Yang et al 2004 or by the superposition of a Schechter function
and a Gaussian function eg the Coma cluster by Biviano et al
1995 Barkhouse et al 2007 found a weak correlation between
M and the cluster Bautz-Morgan classication and the later is re-
lated to cluster dynamical state Wen  Han 2013 The luminosity
function of galaxies in clusters with a Gaussian velocity distribu-
tion ie in a relaxed state has a brighter M and a steeper  than
that in the non-Gaussian clusters Ribeiro et al 2013 which sug-
gests again that the luminosity function of cluster galaxies is really
related to cluster dynamical state However no signicant differ-
ence was found between luminosity functions of galaxies in clus-
ters with different Bautz-Morgan classications Colless 1989 or
in clusters with and without substructures De Propris et al 2003
2013 The discrepancy of these results may come from the lim-
ited number of galaxies of a small number of clusters in previous
investigations
To check if there is any dependence of galaxy luminosity func-
tion on cluster dynamical state the member galaxy data of a large
sample of clusters with quantied dynamical states are needed Pre-
viously qualitative classications for relaxed or unrelaxed or X-ray
coolnon-cool clusters Bauer et al 2005 Vikhlinin et al 2005
Chen et al 2007 are too crude for such a study Only a few clus-
ters have their dynamical state carefully quantied by substructures
in X-ray images eg Buote  Tsai 1995 Bohringer et al 2010
Weimann et al 2013 Recently we used the photometric data of
Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS to quantify the dynamical states
for 2092 rich clusters Wen  Han 2013 which is currently the
largest cluster sample available with quantied dynamical state In
this paper we use this cluster sample to investigate the dependence
of the bright end of galaxy luminosity function on the cluster dy-
namical state In Section 2 we introduce the cluster sample the
member galaxy data for composite luminosity function and the
quantied parameter for cluster dynamical state In Section 3 we
show the dependence of the bright end of galaxy luminosity func-
tion on cluster dynamical state We present discussion and conclu-
sion in Section 4
Throughout this paper we assume a CDM cosmology tak-
ing H0 100 h km s1 Mpc1 with m  03 and   07
2 CLUSTER SAMPLE AND LUMINOSITY FUNCTION
OF BRIGHT MEMBER GALAXIES
Using photometric redshifts of galaxies we identied 132684
galaxy clusters from the SDSS DR8 Wen et al 2012 which is an
update of the previous catalog as made from SDSS DR6 Wen et al
2009 Clusters were identied if they have a richness of RL  12
and the number of member galaxies N200  8 within a radius of
r200 Here r200 is the radius within which the mean density of a
cluster is 200 times of the critical density of the universe The clus-
ter richness is dened as RL  L200L ie the r-band total
luminosity of member galaxies of M e
r 6 205 within r200 in
units of L where M e
r is r-band absolute magnitude after passive
evolution being corrected see below
With these clusters we need to know their dynamical state
for this work Three-dimensional distribution and motions of the
member galaxies or hot intracluster gas are the most direct tracer of
dynamical state of clusters which show several observable effects
either the velocity distributions in the radial direction or the galaxy
distribution or the gas distribution on the projected sky plane
The relaxed clusters of galaxies should show a Gaussian distribu-
tion of the radial velocities and the unrelaxed clusters show non-
Gaussian velocity peak in optical spectroscopic data for member
galaxies Colless  Dunn 1996 Halliday et al 2004 However
spectroscopic observations usually are incomplete for cluster mem-
ber galaxies and only available for a very limited sample of galaxy
clusters On the other hand the unrelaxed or merger clusters usu-
ally show asymmetric distribution of member galaxies or hot gas
The dynamical state of galaxy clusters can be derived from the gas
distribution by using substructures in X-ray images for small sam-
ples of galaxy clusters eg quantitatively by using the power ratio
eg Buote  Tsai 1995 Bohringer et al 2010 the centroid shift
eg Mohr et al 1995 Maughan et al 2008 the asymmetry and
the concentration eg Hashimoto et al 2007 Santos et al 2008
Currently only a few hundred nearby clusters have their substruc-
tures quantied from X-ray image or optical spectrometry eg
Dressler  Shectman 1988 Buote  Tsai 1995 Weimann et al
Recently we presented a method to diagnose the substructure
and quantify the dynamical state of rich galaxy clusters by using
photometric data of the SDSS Wen  Han 2013 For each cluster
member galaxies were selected to have an evolution-corrected mag-
nitude of M e
r 6 205 mag We constructed an optical smoothed
map by convolving the brightness distribution of member galaxies
with a Gaussian kernel The asymmetry factor  the ridge atness
 and the normalized deviation  were then calculated from the
smoothed optical map Based on these three parameters a relax-
ation parameter  was dened to quantify dynamical state of clus-
ters which have been optimized by using a sample of 98 clusters
with qualitatively known dynamical states of relaxed and unre-
laxed in literature A larger value of  indicates the more relaxed
state of a cluster The dened  can successfully separate 94
known relaxed and unrelaxed clusters and has very tight cor-
relations with substructure parameters obtained from X-ray data
eg Bauer et al 2005 Cassano et al 2010 With these tests and
comparisons we believe that our relaxation parameter deduced
in Wen  Han 2013 from photometric data can reliably quantify
cluster dynamical state Applying this method we calculated the re-
laxation parameter  for 2092 clusters from Wen et al 2012 with
a richness RL  50 in the redshift range of 005  z  042
The redshift range is selected to make the cluster sample and also
bright member galaxies to be approximately volume-limited com-
plete Wen et al 2012 Above the richness of RL  50 clusters
have enough bright member galaxies to get a reliable relaxation
parameter  The values of  are continuously distributed in the
range of 2    06 Wen  Han 2013 The sample of 2092
clusters is the largest available with quantied dynamical state and
therefore is used in this paper to calculate the bright end of galaxy
luminosity function
We recognize the member galaxies of the 2092 rich clusters

function after background subtraction Ni0 is the normalization of
the ith cluster and
Nc0  Xi
mj is the number of clusters contributing to the jth bin We only
consider the bright end of galaxy luminosity function in the ab-
solute magnitude range where the member galaxies are approxi-
mately volume-limited complete so that mj is the total number of
clusters The error of the number in the jth bin is
Ncj 
mj cid20Xi
Ni0 cid192cid2112
cid18 Nij
where Nij is determined by the Poisson statistics The faint galax-
ies with a lower luminosity are not considered here because many
of them are late-type spiral or irregular and have a larger uncer-
tainty on the estimated photometric redshift The recognization of
faint member galaxies is not as complete as bright galaxies which
may induce bias at the faint end of luminosity function As pointed
out by Driver et al 2003 and Pracy et al 2004 the clustering
of background galaxies may induce uncertainty on galaxy number
count Nevertheless clustering uncertainty is much smaller than the
Poisson error at the bright-end though hence can be ignored
The normalization of the composite luminosity function by the
method of Colless 1989 depends on the total number of clusters
It is not obvious to show in a gure the difference of the composite
luminosity functions between the subsamples of clusters with dif-
ferent redshifts or dynamical sates In this paper we dene a nor-
malized composite luminosity function by dividing the Ncj and
similarly for Ncj by the total number of clusters together with
the width of absolute magnitude bin Mr

Some of previous studies showed that the evolution of member
galaxy population can be described by a passive evolution model
over a wide range of redshift Lin et al 2006 De Propris et al
2007 Crawford et al 2009 which means that galaxy population
becomes older and fainter at lower redshifts When taking mem-
ber galaxies of a number of clusters over a wide range of redshift
for a composite luminosity function the evolution effect must be
eliminated As shown in Figure 1 member galaxies within r200 of
clusters at higher redshifts 032  z  042 are systematically
brighter than those at lower redshifts 005  z  015 Here we
take a linear form of the redshift evolution and dene an evolution-
corrected magnitude

Lin et al 2006 Crawford et al 2009 we apply a stellar popu-
lation synthesis model Bruzual  Charlot 2003 with the initial
mass function of Chabrier 2003 and solar metallicity and we
nd the value of Q  116 After the redshift-evolution correc-
tion of the absolute magnitude the luminosity functions in differ-
ent redshift ranges become roughly consistent see lower panel of

composite galaxy luminosity function to the absolute magnitude

by using photometric redshifts from the SDSS DR8 Because the
stargalaxy separation is reliable to r  215 mag for the SDSS
photometric data Lupton et al 2001 the member galaxies are
complete down to the limit Mr  2035 log h within z  042
see Wen et al 2012 For each cluster the member galaxies are ex-
tracted if they have a photometric redshift within 0041  z from
the cluster redshift For such bright galaxies this photometric red-
shift range was chosen to include  90 member galaxies but with
only 1015 contamination for rich clusters see Wen et al
2009 To further diminish the contamination of member galaxies
and reduce the member incompleteness we complement the pho-
tometric data with the spectroscopic redshifts of the SDSS DR10
Ahn et al 2013 for member galaxies The galaxies are discarded
from the member galaxy list if they have a velocity difference of
v  2500 km s1 in the rest frame from the spectroscopic red-
shift of a cluster We also include the missing member galaxies
into the photometric redshift data if their spectroscopic redshifts
are within a velocity difference of v 6 2500 km s1 The galax-
ies within r200 are considered as member galaxy candidates of the
cluster For background subtraction the galaxies between 2 and 4
Mpc from the cluster center and fainter than the second BCG are
considered as being background galaxies because the recognized
BCG is always considered as member galaxy of a cluster
We use these bright member galaxies to derive the bright end
of a composite luminosity function following the method of Colless
1989 The number of galaxies in the jth bin of the composite
luminosity function is

3 DEPENDENCE OF THE BRIGHT END OF GALAXY
LUMINOSITY FUNCTION ON CLUSTER
DYNAMICAL STATE
We use the sample of 2092 rich clusters of RL  50 with known
dynamical states quantied by Wen  Han 2013 to exam the de-
pendence of galaxy luminosity function on cluster dynamical state
Here we emphasize that we only work at the bright end Because
the luminosity of a BCG is very distinct from non-BCG member
galaxies eg Hansen et al 2005 we study their composite lumi-
nosity functions separately
31 Luminosity function of non-BCGs in clusters
The sample of 2092 rich clusters of richness RL  50 are divided
into three subsamples according to their dynamical states quantied
by relaxation parameter  The richness distributions of these sub-
samples are very similar see Figure 2 so that there is no selection
effect on richness in three subsamples
We rst calculate the composite luminosity function of non-
BCG member galaxies within the central region of r500  23r200
Shimizu et al 2003 and t them with the Schechter function
see the upper panel of Figure 3 We only obtain the bright end
of galaxy luminosity function which is insensitive to the faint
end slope  Hence we x   10 eg Popesso et al 2005
Lin et al 2006 De Propris et al 2013 in the tting and compare
M for clusters in different range of  The derived parameters
 and M are given in Table 1 We nd that the luminosity func-
tions at M e
r  5 log h  210 mag agree with each other for
different ranges of  but there is a signicant excess for more un-
relaxed ie lower  clusters at the bright end of M e
r  5 log h 
210 mag Thus more relaxed clusters have a fainter M The
value of M for relaxed clusters of   00 is 027 magnitude
Figure 3 Composite luminosity functions and the best-t Schechter func-
tions Upper panel and the ratio to the ducial line Lower panel for mem-
ber galaxies within r500 of clusters in three ranges of  The ducial line
is the best-t Schechter function of member galaxies in relaxed clusters of
  00
fainter than that for the unrelaxed clusters of 16    08
To clearly show the excess of bright galaxies we take the best-t
Schechter function of galaxies in relaxed clusters of   00 as
a ducial line and compare the ratios of luminosity functions to
this ducial line lower panel of Figure 3 Obviously the ratio of
luminosity function of galaxies in unrelaxed clusters signicantly
increases at M e
r  5 log  210 mag which means that there are
more bright member galaxies in more unrelaxed clusters
For a comparison we also obtain the bright end of luminosity
functions of galaxies in the outer cluster region between r500 and
r200 for clusters in the three relaxation parameter ranges As shown
in Figure 4 the luminosity functions of these outer galaxies are very
consistent for clusters with various dynamical states even at the
bright end of M e
r 5 log h  210 mag This is inconsistent with
the result of Barrena et al 2012 who found a larger difference
of galaxy population in the outer cluster region at the bright end
We therefore can conclude that more relaxed clusters have fewer
bright member galaxies within r500 but in the outer cluster region
 r500 the luminosity distribution of member galaxies is nearly
independent of cluster dynamical state
32 Luminosity function of BCGs
The BCG in a galaxy cluster is the most massive galaxy near
the center of the cluster The BCGs of many clusters have dif-
ferent statistical properties from the non-BCG member galaxies

M0  5 log h  2243  002 for the very unrelaxed clusters of

4 DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
The total composite luminosity function of member galaxies in
clusters should be the summation of s and g as
totM dM  sM   gM dM
By using 2092 rich clusters the largest sample of galaxy clusters
with quantied dynamical state we nd different dependence of s
and g for bright member galaxies on cluster dynamical state This
is a clear evidence for the co-evolution of bright member galax-
ies with cluster dynamical state The mean absolute magnitude
of BCGs in clusters varies about 065 mag for different dynami-
cal states while the characteristic magnitude M of the non-BCG
member galaxies varies only about 027 mag Note however that
the above results are obtained for the bright galaxies in the inner
region of clusters of r  r500 The luminosity function of bright
member galaxies in the outer region does not show dependence
on cluster dynamical state which is consistent with the conclusion
given by De Propris et al 2003 and De Propris et al 2013 who
found the independence of galaxy population on cluster dynami-
cal state Our conclusion is opposite to that given by Barrena et al
2012 who showed the more signicant dependence of galaxy lu-

von der Linden et al 2007 Bernardi et al 2007 Liu et al 2012
Shen et al 2014 It has been suggested that the BCGs were formed
at redshift z  2 and then evolved passively eg Stott et al
2008 Whiley et al 2008 However some simulation shows that
the BCGs were formed by accretion and merger of satellite galax-
ies eg De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 The BCGs are very bright and
have a similar absolute magnitude with a small dispersion of 03
045 mag Sandage 1988 Aragon-Salamanca et al 1998 Lin et al
2004 The composite luminosity function of the BCGs can be de-
scribed by a Gaussian function Hansen et al 2005

How to explain the obvious difference of bright member
galaxies in clusters with different dynamical states During relax-
ation process of a cluster many massive galaxies tend to sink to the
center of a cluster due to dynamical friction and may be merged
into the BCG which produces a brighter BCG nally This causes
fewer bright non-BCG member galaxies in the inner region of clus-
ters Observations have showed that the BCGs in some clusters are
experiencing major merger McIntosh et al 2008 Liu et al 2009
More relaxed clusters have a larger magnitude gap between the
rst-rank and second-rank BCGs Ramella et al 2007 Smith et al
2010 Wen  Han 2013 Our results indicate that the evolution of
massive cluster galaxies deviates from a simple pure passive evo-
lution model and somewhat support the scenario of hierarchical
formation of the BCGs De Lucia  Blaizot 2007
In summary we study the dependence of the bright end of
galaxy luminosity function on cluster dynamical state by using
the bright member galaxies of a large sample of clusters After a
redshift-evolution correction for the absolute magnitude of galax-
ies the composite luminosity function of non-BCG member galax-
ies can be well tted by the Schechter function The absolute mag-
nitude of BCGs follows a Gaussian function with a dispersion of
about 036 mag Though in the outer cluster region  r500 the
luminosity function of bright member galaxies is independent of
cluster dynamical state we nd that in the cluster central region of
r500 luminosity function of more relaxed clusters has a fainter M
In these relaxed clusters there are fewer bright member galaxies of
r  210  5 log h but have a brighter BCG Our results sug-
gest the co-evolution of member galaxies with cluster dynamical
state and somewhat support the hierarchical formation scenario of
the BCGs
