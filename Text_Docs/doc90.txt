In the past Hawking radiation was viewed as a tunneling process and the barrier was just created
by the outgoing particle itself In this paper Parikhs recent work is extended to the case of massive
particles tunneling We investigate the behavior of the tunneling massive particles from a particular
black hole solution-GH Dilaton black hole which is obtained from the string theory and calculate
the emission rate at which massive particles tunnel across the event horizon We obtain that the
result is also consistent with an underlying unitary theory Furthermore the result takes the same
functional form as that of massless particles
Key words Hawking radiation tunneling process emission rate

INTRODUCTION
In 2000 Parikh and Wilczek proposed a new method to calculate the emission rate at which particles tunnel across
the event horizon1 2 3 4 The key points in their method were that they treated Hawking radiation as a tunneling
process and considered that the barrier was just created by the outgoing particle itself in particular they found a
coordinate system well-behaved at the event horizon to calculate the emission rate7 8 In this way they obtained
the corrected emission spectrum of the particles from the spherically symmetric black holes such as Schwarzschild
black hole and Reissner-Norstrom black hole Its found that their results were consistent with an underlying unitary
theory However the particles which they have treated all are massless and follow the radial lightlike geodesics when
they tunnel across the horizon while the massive particles dont follow the radial lightlike geodesics In this paper
we extend Parikhs method to a particular black hole solution-GH Dilaton black hole10 and investigate the massive
particles tunneling5 6 Then we calculate the emission rate at the event horizon of the GH Dilaton black hole
During the calculation for the sake of simplicity we consider the outgoing massive particle as a massive shell de
Broglie s-wave and the phase velocity and group velocity of the de Broglie wave corresponding to the outgoing
particle are respectively obtained
The rest of the paper is organized as follows In section 2 we rst introduce a Painleve-GH Dilaton coordinate
system10 and then investigate the behavior of the massive tunneling particles In section 3 we calculate the emission
rate at which massive particles tunnel across the event horizon of GH Dilaton black hole Finally in section 4 we
give a brief conclusion and discussion

It is easy to nd that the metric in 1 is singular at the location of the event horizon r  rH  As mentioned in sec1
we should rst nd a coordinate system to calculate the emission rate which is well-behaved at the event horizon Its
found that the Painleve coordinate system is convenient11 If let dt  dts 1
we can read the Painleve-GH Dilaton line element10

The metric 4 displays the stationary nonstatic and nonsingular nature of the space time Moreover we nd
another important feature which we will describe as follows
As we know according to Landaus theory of the coordinate clock synchronization the dierence of coordinate
times of two events taking place simultaneously in dierent place is12
 T  Z g0i
where i123 And we consider the space-time has been decomposed in 31 So if the simultaneity of coordinate
clocks can be transmitted from one place to another and have nothing to do with the integration path the components
of the metric should satisfy15

Its easy to nd that the line element 4 satises condition 6 That is the coordinate clock synchronization
in the Painleve coordinates can be transmitted from one place to another though the line element is not diagonal
In quantum mechanics it is an instantaneous process when particle tunnels across a barrier Thus this feature is
necessary for us to discuss the tunneling process
From 4 we can easily obtain the radial null geodesics10
r 
 g  
where the upperlower sign corresponds the outgoingingoing geodesic
But in this paper we consider the tunneling of massive particles When the massive particles tunnel across the
horizon they do not follow the radial lightlike geodesics in 7 In order to obtain the r of massive particles and for
the sake of simplicity we consider the outgoing massive particle as a massive shell nonrelativistic de Broglie s-wave
According to the WKB formula the approximative wave equation is5 6
where ri   represents the initial location of the particle Using the non-relativistic quantum mechanics and if we let
r t  CeiR r
ri prdrt

prdr  t  0
then we have
 r 
where k is the de Broglie wave number Comparing the denition of the phase velocity we nd that r is just the
phase velocity of the de Broglie wave For the nonrelativistic de Broglie wave the denitions of the group velocity vg
and the phase velocity vp and the relationship between them are16
 r 
where rc is the location of the particle In order to obtain the formula of the phase velocity r let us rst investigate
the behavior of a massive particle tunneling across the horizon5 6
Since tunneling across the barrier is an instantaneous process there are two simultaneous events during the process
of emission One event is particle tunneling into the barrier and the other is particle tunneling out the barrier In
terms of Landaus theory of the coordinate clock synchronization the dierence of coordinate times of these two
simultaneous events is
so the group velocity is
and therefore the phase velocity is

Substituting g00 and g01 into 16 we obtain the expression of r

Here 17 is corresponding to the outgoing motion of the massive particles and we dont consider the eect of self-
gravitation If the self-gravitation is included 17 should be modied by replacing M with M   where  is the
particles energy
III MASSIVE PARTICLES TUNNELING AND THE EMISSION RATE
For a positive-energy s-wave the rate of tunneling  could take the form
where Ir is the action According to the WKB approximation the action has been found to have a conveniently
simple form1
  exp2ImI
I  Z rf
prdr  Z rf
where pr is the radial momentum And ri is the initial radius corresponding the site of pair-creation which should
be slightly inside the event horizon rH  while rf is the nal radius which is slightly outside the nal position of the
horizon
Using the Hamiltons equation dH
 r and substituting 17 into 19 the action will be
I  Z rf
prdr  Z rf
dr  Z Mf
2rrH drdM
r  rH 1  r
where the Hamiltonian H  M  Mi and Mf are respectively the initial mass and the nal mass of the black hole
From 18 we get that we can just consider the imaginary part of the action In 20 if we do the r integral rst
and then we can obtain the imaginary part of the action

In order to calculate 21 conveniently we can change the variant M into rH 10 13 which we can get from 2 3

The integral in 23 is not easy to calculate directly However what we need is not the direct result but the
comparison between ImI and S So rst we can expand krH  at the near eld of ri as a Taylor series10 13

In principle if we substitute 29 into 28 we can obtain S and then we can compare it with 26 But
fortunately comparing 29 with 24 we nd

Now we can easily obtain the following equation by comparing 26 with 28 and using 30
which expresses that the emission rate is also consistent with an underlying unitary theory10

IV CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
In this paper the space-time is a spherically symmetric charged dilaton black hole Not as usual is that it is obtained
from the string theory9 However the result is also consistent with the underlying unitary theory Comparing with
the Schwarschild-desitter space-time in Ref5 We can nd that the conclusion at the end of Sec3 is more general
Moreover the particles which we discuss are massive but the results take the same functional form as that of massless
particles10 which expresses that the tunneling eect is an intrinsic property of the black hole As a further discussion
and viewed from the calculation we nd that though r of massive particles in 17 is dierent from that of massless
particles in 7 the results are the same after we do the r integral rst in 20 They are all equal to

For the GH Dilaton black hole the expression of the inverse temperature  is10
Comparing 32 with 33 we can easily obtain

which implicates more clearly that the tunneling eect is an intrinsic property of the black holes
