To adapt their behaviour in changing environments cells sense concentrations by binding external
ligands to their receptors However incorrect ligands may bind nonspecically to receptors and
when their concentration is large this binding activity may interfere with the sensing of the ligand
of interest Here I derive analytically the physical limit to the accuracy of concentration sensing
amid a large number of interfering ligands A scaling transition is found when the mean bound
time of correct ligands is twice that of incorrect ligands I discuss how the physical bound can be
approached by a cascade of receptor states generalizing kinetic proof-reading schemes
Because of their small sizes biological systems typ-
ically operate with only a few copies of the molecules
they sense and communicate with
In their pioneering
work Berg and Purcell derived the fundamental bound
that the noise arising from these small numbers sets on
the accuracy of concentration sensing 1 Experimental
progress in the characterization of single-cell variability
2 and sensing precision 3 has fueled a renewed inter-
est in small-number noise and its implications for infor-
mation processing 46 General or rened bounds on
sensing accuracy have been recently derived for single
receptors 79 and extended to spatial 1014 or tem-
poral 15 gradient sensing while the metabolic cost and
trade-os of sensing accuracy have been explored 16
25 Much of this past work has assumed perfect speci-
city between the biological receptors and their cognate
ligands In realistic biological contexts large numbers of
spurious ligands may bind receptors nonspecically in-
terfering with the ligand of interest 26 This is the case
in the problem of antigen recognition by T-cell receptors
where cells must react to a small number of specic for-
eign peptides among a large number of nonspecic self-
peptides 27 Biochemical network architectures based
on kinetic proofreading 28 29 have been shown to pro-
vide a solution to the discrimination problem and have
been studied in depth theoretically 26 3032 How-
ever no fundamental bound has been derived against
which to compare the performance of these solutions
save for Ref 33 where concepts of statistical decision
theory were used to derive the minimal decision time to
detect cognate ligands
In this paper I derive the fun-
damental limit on concentration sensing accuracy and
ligand detection error in the presence of a large number
of spurious ligands The maximum likelihood estimate
achieving the bound can be implemented biologically by
simple networks based on push-pull reactions
Consider a mixture of two ligands only one of which
the biological system wishes to sense The ligand of inter-
est hereafter referred to as the correct ligand is present
in concentration c while the interfering or spurious lig-
and called the incorrect ligand is present in concentra-
tion ccid48 The biological unit can sense ligands through
N identical receptors which can be bound by either
FIG 1 Reading concentrations o trajectories of re-
ceptor occupancies Cognate correct and spurious incor-
rect ligands may bind N receptors typically presented on the
cell surface with rate kc and kccid48 The incorrect ligands are
in excess ccid48  c but lead to shorter binding events rcid48  r
The information the cell can theoretically use is contained in
the time traces of occupancy of all receptors green curves
The maximum likelihood estimate fully exploits these traces
to optimally infer the input concentrations c and ccid48
ligand with a common rate k  4Da where D is the
molecule diusivity and a the eective receptor size Re-
ceptors can distinguish between the two molecules thanks
to their higher anity to the correct ligand Physically
this means that the unbinding rate r of the correct ligand
is smaller than that of the incorrect ligand rcid48  r
The occupancy of each receptor

1  kcr1  kccid48rcid481 
depends on both concentrations and cannot be used
alone to determine c The interchangeability of the ratios
cr and ccid48rcid48 in this expression emphasizes the ambiguity
between many incorrect ligands and a few correct ones
To discern these two eects one must use the full tempo-
ral record of occupancy of each receptor The probability
distribution for the binding and unbinding events at all
receptors during a time interval T reads

can be rewritten as a sum of three independent contribu-
tions L  L0  L1  L2 where L0 depends on neither c
or ccid48 and where L1 and L2 pertain to the unbound and

where x  cctot is the fraction of correct ligands and
  rrcid48  1 is the binding constant ratio As can be
seen in the respective dependencies of L1 and L2 upon
ctot and x unbound intervals are informative of the total
concentration while the bound intervals are informative
of the fractions of ligands
The maximum likelihood estimate for the total con-
centration is obtained by the condition L1ctot  0
which gives ctot  kTun The error made by this esti-
mate is given in the large time limit by the Cramer-Rao
bound which sets the best possible performance of any
estimator 34

8 for a single ligand where the maximum-likelihood er-
ror was shown to be half as small as the classical Berg
and Purcell bound 1 based on the average receptor oc-
cupancy The reason for this dierence is that the maxi-
mum likelihood estimate is not aected by the noise due
to the stochastic nature of receptor unbinding as evident
in Eq 3 In the case of a mixture the receptor occu-
pancy Eq 1 depends on x as well as ctot and does not
even suce to determine the total concentration
The fraction x of correct ligands can be estimated by
maximum likelihood as well by solving

FIG 2 Physical bound on concentration sensing error
The fundamental bound on the relative error in the fraction
of correct ligands x  cctot scales with the inverse of the
number of binding events n Here the rescaled error f x  
ncid104x2cid105 Eq 7 is represented as a function of the binding
constant ratio  for various values of x There are two distinct
scaling regimes Eq 8 For   12 the rescaled error
depends weakly on x while for   12 it scales as x with
  1 1  as illustrated in the inset for three example
values of

It is interesting to consider the limit where the correct
ligands are rare x cid28 1 as in the case of immune recogni-
tion Two scaling regimes illustrated in Fig 2 are found
depending on the value of the ratio  between the two

In the hard discrimination regime   12 incorrect
ligands dominate the error which is governed by ctot
as in Eq 5 The prefactor g diverges at   1
as expected when the two ligands have the same bind-
ing constant and are thus indistinguishable By con-
trast in the easy discrimination regime   12 the
error is governed by a weighted geometric mean be-
tween c and ctot

In many situations it is more useful for the system
to determine the presence of the correct ligand rather
than its precise concentration as in the recognition of
foreign pathogens by immune receptors This decision
can be made optimally in the Bayesian sense by com-
paring the likelihoods of the two competing hypotheses

This idea can be implemented biologically by a cas-
cade of receptor conformational states triggered by bind-
ing and proceeding irreversibly from states 1 to m each
transition to the next state occurring with rate s Fig 4
The ligand is free to detach from the receptor at any
time bringing the receptor back to the unbound state 0
The receptors signal through the production or activa-
tion of two molecules B and D with opposite eects on a
push-pull network governing the state of a molecule X
which provides the nal readout for x through its modi-
ed state X If one requires that the equilibration of B
and D are fast and that X and X are always in excess

ously proposed in the case of a single ligand 15 19 The
network structure proposed in this study Fig 4 is rem-
iniscent of kinetic proofreading schemes and their gen-
eralizations which provide a well-known solution to the
ligand discrimination problem 26 28 29 32 35 An im-
portant dierence is that here signaling occurs during all
steps albeit at various ne-tuned rates and with poten-
tially negative contributions the role of which is to buer
the eect of wrong ligands Consistent with this predic-
tion it was shown that a negative interaction through
a diusible molecule between kinetic-proofreading recep-
tors could mitigate the eects of large numbers of incor-
rect ligands in a discrimination task 26
The present results are relevant beyond the particu-
lar case of sensing by receptors and apply to any kind of
biochemical signaling in presence of competing ligands or
cross-talk This is the case for example in the context
of gene regulation where competing transcription fac-
tors may bind regulatory sites unspecically a problem
particularly acute in metazoans 36
The scaling transition occurring at the binding con-
stant ratio   12 suggests that dierent strategies
should be employed depending on how hard the discrim-
ination task is
In particular the approximate but bi-
ologically implementable estimator of Eq 12 curiously
breaks down in the easy discrimation regime   12 In
that regime the optimal bound is harder to achieve be-
cause it is dominated by rare long binding events that are
hard to encode by biochemical solutions The example of
immune recognition falls precisely into that regime with
a binding constant ratio  between agonist and nonago-
nist ligands ranging from one fth to one third 27 More
elaborate network designs probably with feedback may
be needed to achieve the theoretical bound Eq 7 in
that case Finally this study has assumed throughout
that the unbinding rates r and rcid48 are priorly known to
the system Complex mixtures of ligands with unknown
binding constants would make for interesting generaliza-

FIG 4 Network for sensing the concentration of cor-
rect ligands Upon binding each receptor enters a cascade
of m states along which it proceeds with rate s The lig-
and can detach at any moment with rate r or rcid48 depending
on its identity correct or incorrect bringing the receptor
back to the unbound state 0 While in conformational state
  1     m the receptor activates two enzymes B and D
with rates b and d each catalyzing two oppposite Michaelis-
Mentens reactions of a pull-push network B and D are as-
sumed to equilibrate fast and to be always limiting in the
reactions they catalyze so that dXdt  b  d
involve a running sum over an eective time T  obtained
by relaxing X to X with rate  T 1 15
When the number of states m is large and the tran-
sitions between them are rapid X can track Eq 12
with arbitrary precision when   12 In that case the
receptor state  provides an approximation to the time

Although such optimal performance is only reached for
large m and   12 this network design may still per-
form well in more general situations One can optimize
the expected error produced by this network over the
net signaling rates b  d with the constraint that
the mean eect of binding incorrect ligands on X be
zero so that X  c on average App C Fig 5
shows how the performance of such optimized networks
approaches the theoretical bound as the number of states
m increases The convergence is signicantly worse for
  12 at small x In that regime the estimator of 12
is not valid suggesting that this network design may not
achieve the optimal bound even with an innite number
of states The output of these networks can also be used
to detect ligands Their performance in doing so is com-
pared to the optimal discrimination errors of Eq 10 in
Fig 3
The principle of maximum likelihood not only yields
the fundamental bound on the accuracy of discerning
cognate ligands from spurious ones but also suggests bio-
chemical solutions to approach this optimal bound Such

Appendix C Optimization of the signaling rates in
the receptor cascade
Each receptor goes through a cascade of states  
1     m upon binding At any moment the receptor can
become unbound with rate r or rcid48 In the following some
expressions will be given in terms of the unbinding rate
of the correct ligand r but the same expressions hold for
the incorrect ligand after substitution by rcid48
The probability of reaching state  is ss  r1
