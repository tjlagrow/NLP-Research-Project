Abstract The properties of galaxies depend on their environment red passive elliptical galax-
ies are usually located in denser environments than blue star-forming spiral galaxies This
dierence in galaxy populations can be detected at all scales from groups of galaxies to super-
clusters In this paper we will discuss the eect of the large-scale environment on galaxies Our
results suggest that galaxies in superclusters are more likely to be passive than galaxies in voids
even when they belong to groups with the same richness In addition the galaxies in superclus-
ters are also aected by the morphology of the supercluster lament-type superclusters contain
relatively more red passive galaxies than spider-type superclusters These results suggest that
the evolution of a galaxy is not determined by its local environment alone but the large-scale
environment also aects

1 Introduction
Properties of galaxies depend on their environment In dense environments massive
galaxies are more likely to be red and passive ellipticals than in less dense regions This
color-density or morphology-density relation can be found on many scales of density from
the distance to the neighboring galaxies to the location of the galaxy in the cosmic web

The dependence of galaxy properties on the environment can be explained with an
evolutionary scenario where the star formation in a galaxy is quenched by some in-
teraction with the environment There are several physical processes that can cause
the transformation of galaxies from star forming to passive These include interaction
with other galaxies such as mergers Barnes  Hernquist 1992 and galaxy harassment
Richstone 1976 Moore et al 1996 and interaction with the group or the cluster such
as tidal stripping Gnedin 2003 ram pressure stripping Gunn  Gott 1972 or stran-
gulation Larson et al 1980
We analyse the galaxy populations in dierent large-scale environments concentrating
especially on galaxies in small groups The majority of galaxies are located in groups of
a few galaxies or in the eld ie not belonging to any group Figure 1 shows the total
number of galaxies in dierent large-scale environments as a function of group richness
The data is from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 10th Data Release SDSS DR10 The
group catalog was constructed by Tempel et al 2014 and it contains 588 193 galaxies
that form 82 458 groups The sample is magnitude limited with r  1777 The large-
scale environment was determined using a luminosity-density eld with smoothing scale
of 8 Mpc Tempel et al 2014 Liivamagi et al 2012 The unit for the large-scale
density D is the mean density of the whole eld Regions with less than the mean density

can be dened as voids while densities with more than ve times the mean density are
superclusters
The high fraction of galaxies in groups suggests that the groups are important environ-
ments in galaxy evolution Small groups can also be found in any large-scale environment
from voids to superclusters which makes it possible to compare the dierent large-scale
environments Our aim is to study how the large-scale environment aects the galaxies
We compare the properties of galaxies in high and low density large-scale environments
superclusters and voids concentrating especially on galaxies in small groups
2 Results
In Lietzen et al 2012 we used the galaxy catalogs of the eigth data release DR8
of the SDSS to compare galaxy populations in dierent large-scale environments We
found that galaxies in superclusters are more likely to be red and passive than galaxies
in voids even when they belong to groups with the same richness This dierence was
found by comparing the fractions of star-forming and passive galaxies and by calculating
the average colors of galaxies in dierent environments Morphology on its own does not
depend on the environment environments of non-star-forming spiral galaxies are similar
to those of elliptical galaxies
As an example of the large-scale eect we analyse in Fig 2 the color distribution
of galaxies that do not belong to any group eld galaxies from the SDSS tenth data
release DR10 data These galaxies represent the poorest group-scale environments in
the universe The distribution is shown separately for supercluster intermediate density
and void galaxies The gure shows that eld galaxies in superclusters are more likely
red than the eld galaxies in voids
Besides the dierences between superclusters and low-density environments there are
also dierences in the galaxy populations between dierent superclusters Superclusters
can be divided into two morphological types spider-type superclusters which consist
of high-density clumps with several outgoing laments and lament-type superclusters
in which high-density clumps are connected by only a few galaxy laments The galaxy
populations in dierent superclusters were studied in Einasto et al 2014 by comparing
galaxy contents of spider and lament type superclusters Distributions of color mor-

phology stellar mass and star-formation rate of galaxies in the two types of superclusters
and in lower-density environments are shown in Fig 3 Superclusters of lament type
contain a higher fraction of early-type low star-formation rate galaxies than the spider-
type superclusters There are also signicant dierences between the galaxy populations
of individual superclusters
3 Discussion
Our results suggest that galaxies in superclusters are dierent from galaxies in voids
and that dierent superclusters have dierent galaxy populations These results imply
that the evolution of galaxies may not be determined by the group-scale environment
alone but the large-scale environment also has an eect
The physical processes that drive galaxy evolution happen on smaller scales Star
formation in a galaxy may be ended by an interaction with a neighboring galaxy or with
the surrounding group of galaxies Typical sizes of superclusters are of the order of ten
megaparsec or more Therefore the large-scale eect must be less direct One possible
explanation may be the speed of evolution according to Einasto et al 2005 the
dynamical evolution in high-density global environments the dynamical evolution starts
earlies and is more rapid than in low-density environments
The higher fraction of mature galaxies in denser environments may be interpreted as a
product of mass assembly bias Gao et al 2005 found in the simulations that the oldest
10  of halos are more than ve times more strongly correlated than the youngest 10 
with the same mass If old halos also host old galaxies this could explain the denser
environments of the red passive galaxies
The morphology of superclusters may aect galaxies in superclusters through dierent
dynamical structure According to Einasto et al 2012 superclusters with spider mor-
phology have richer inner structure than those with lament morphology This means
that mergers of clusters may occur more often in the spider superclusters making them
dynamically younger
