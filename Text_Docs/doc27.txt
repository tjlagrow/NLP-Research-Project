The physical limit with which a cell senses external ligand concentration corresponds to the perfect
absorber where all ligand particles are absorbed and overcounting of same ligand particles does
not occur Here we analyze how the lateral diusion of receptors on the cell membrane aects the
accuracy of sensing ligand concentration Specically we connect our modeling to neurotransmission
in neural synapses where the diusion of glutamate receptors is already known to refresh synaptic
connections We nd that receptor diusion indeed increases the accuracy of sensing for both the
glutamate AMPA and NDMA receptors although the NMDA receptor is overall much noiser We
propose that the dierence in accuracy of sensing of the two receptors can be linked to their dierent
roles in neurotransmission Specically the high accuracy in sensing glutamate is essential for the
AMPA receptor to start membrane depolarization while the NMDA receptor is believed to work in
a second stage as a coincidence detector involved in long-term potentiation and memory

INTRODUCTION
Biological cells live in very noisy environments from
which they receive many dierent stimuli The survival
of a cell highly depends on its ability to respond to such
stimuli and to adapt to changes in the environment A
fundamental role in this task is played by membrane re-
ceptors proteins on the cell surface which are able to
bind external ligand molecules and trigger signal trans-
duction pathways Although the precision with which
a cell can measure the concentration of a specic lig-
and is negatively aected by many sources of noise 14
several examples exist in which such measurements are
performed with surprisingly high accuracy In bacterial
chemotaxis for instance the bacterium Escherichia coli
can respond to changes in concentration as low as 32 nM
5 corresponding to only three molecules in the volume
of a cell High accuracy is observed also in spatial sensing
by single cell eukaryotic organisms as eg
in the slime
mold Dictyostelium discoideum which is able to sense a
concentration dierence of only 1  5 across the cell
diameter 6 and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae budding
yeast which is able to orient growth in a gradient of -
pheromone mating factor down to estimated 1 receptor
occupancy dierence across the cell 7 Spatial sensing
is also eciently performed by growing neurons lympho-
cytes neutrophils and other cells of the immune system

There has been substantial progress in our theoretical
understanding of the accuracy of concentration sensing
In 1977 Berg and Purcell were the rst to point out
that ligand sensing is limited by ligand diusion pro-
ducing a counting noise at the receptors 8 Bialek
and Setayeshgar 9 and later others 10 used the Fluc-
tuation Dissipation Theorem FDT to separate the con-
tributions from random bindingunbinding events from
rebinding due to diusion of ligand molecules Subse-
quently Wingreen and Endres showed that the perfect
absorber is the absolute fundamental limit of ligand sens-
ing accuracy it does not suer from ligand unbinding and
rebinding noise 10 11
In previous work we analyzed the contribution of endo-
cytosis ie the internalization of cell-surface receptors
to the accuracy of external ligand concentration sensing
12 We showed with a simple model that internalization
by making the cell act as an absorber of ligand increases
sensing accuracy by reducing the noise from rebinding
of already measured ligand molecules In this paper we
consider the eect of lateral diusion of receptors on the
accuracy of ligand concentration sensing
In a situation in which ligand sensing is concentrated
in a specic region on the cell membrane signaling
hotspot receptors bind ligand molecules locally but may
release them remotely from the region of interest thus
preventing those particles from rebinding locally Noise
from overcounting could therefore be reduced potentially
increasing the accuracy of sensing
A potential implementation of such localized sensing
occurs in neural synapses responsible for transmission
of action potentials and short-term synaptic plasticity
see Fig 1 for a schematic description At such crit-
ical places in the central nervous system the accuracy
of sensing ought to be important 13 At a synapse the
propagation of an action potential arriving from the pre-
synaptic neuron causes the opening of ion channels on
the pre-synaptic membrane which increases calcium-ion
inow 14 Calcium ions trigger a biochemical cascade
which results in the formation of vesicles containing neu-
rotransmitter eg glutamate in the case of excitatory
synapses One or more vesicles eventually fuse with the
membrane at a point on the pre-synaptic surface to form
a fusion pore Glutamate is subsequently released and
diuses into the synaptic cleft reaching the receptors on
the post-synaptic surface on the opposite side of the cleft
These receptors mainly the AMPA and NMDA receptors
named after the agonists -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-
4-isoxazolepropionic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid
respectively cause ion channels on the post-synaptic
membrane to open facilitating the propagation of the
action potential
The AMPA receptor AMPAR has a tetrameric struc-
ture with four binding sites for glutamate Binding glu-
tamate on two sites leads to conformational change and
opening of a pore More occupied binding sites imply a
higher current through the channel mainly of calcium
sodium and potassium ions The NMDA receptor NM-
DAR has a tetrameric structure as well but its chan-
nel needs coincidental binding of glutamate and glycine
molecules on dedicated sites for it to open A small mem-
brane depolarization is furthermore necessary to clear out
the magnesium ions blocking the channel This third
condition makes the NMDA receptor a type of coinci-
dence detector for membrane depolarization and synap-
tic transmission playing an important role in memory
and learning Interestingly AMPA receptors diuse on
the post-synaptic surface unusually fast especially when
ligand is bound 15 In addition to refreshing the synap-
tic plasticity 16 such diusion may also increase the
accuracy of sensing in neurotransmission
This paper is organized as follows
in Sec II we re-
view the case of a single immobile receptor in Sec III we
consider receptor diusion on the membrane and derive
the dynamical equations determining the spatial concen-
tration of ligand and the occupancy of the receptor In
Sec IV we derive the stationary solution for the receptor
occupancy and in Sec V using a non-equilibrium ap-
proach based on the eective temperature we derive the
accuracy of sensing In Section VI we describe how our
theoretical results connect to neurotransmission in neu-
ral synapses The nal section is devoted to an overall
discussion including cases of further biological relevance
Technical details are provided in two appendices
II REVIEW OF THE SINGLE RECEPTOR
In this section we review previous results for a single
immobile receptor As depicted in Fig 2 such a recep-
tor can bind and release ligand with rates kc and k
respectively The kinetics for the occupancy nt of the
receptor are therefore given by
 kc 1  nt  knt
where the concentration of ligand c is assumed uniform
and constant The steady-state solution for the receptor
occupancy is given by
c  KD
with KD  kk the ligand dissociation constant The
rates of binding and unbinding are related to the nega-
tive free energy F of binding through the detailed bal-
with T the temperature in energy units In the limit of
very fast ligand diusion ie when a ligand molecule is
immediately removed from the receptor after unbinding
the receptor dynamics are eectively decoupled from the
diusion of ligand molecules and hence diusion does
not need to be included explicitly
Following Bialek and Setayeshgar 9 the accuracy of
sensing is obtained by applying the FDT 17 which re-
lates the spectrum of uctuations in occupancy to the
linear response of the receptor occupancy to a pertur-
bation in the receptor binding energy Furthermore at
equilibrium the uctuations in occupancy can be directly
related to the uncertainty in ligand concentration using
Eq 2 After time-averaging over a duration  much
larger than the correlation time of the binding and un-
binding events the normalized uncertainty of sensing is
given by 9 18

where the right-hand side is obtained for diusion-limited
binding 18 ie when kc1  n  4cD3s with D3
the diusion constant and s the dimension of the spher-
ical receptor Eq
4 shows that the uncertainty is
limited by the random binding and unbinding of ligand
FIG 2 Color online Single receptor immobile at position
x0 binds and unbinds ligand with rates kc and k respec-
tively
The accuracy of sensing is dened as the inverse of the
uncertainty
In the case where diusion of ligand is slow ligand
binding to the receptor is perturbed 9 The kinetics
of receptor occupancy and ligand concentration are de-
scribed by

last term in the second equation the Dirac delta func-
tion x  x0 describes a sink or source of ligand at x0
corresponding to ligand binding or unbinding from the
receptor respectively
Following a similar procedure as in the previous case
the uncertainty of sensing is given by 9 18

where the rst term on the right-hand side of Eq 6a
is the same as in Eq 4 while the second term is the
increase in uncertainty due to diusion This term ac-
counts for the additional measurement uncertainty from
rebinding of previously bound ligand to the receptor For
diusion-limited binding one obtains Eq 6b 18
Comparison of Eqs 4 and 6 shows that removal of
previously bound ligand by fast diusion increases the
accuracy of sensing since the same ligand molecule is
never measured more than once
The uncertainty in Eq
4 can be further reduced
by a factor of two consequently increasing the accuracy
of sensing by the same factor by considering the fun-
damental limit
In this limit ligand particles are ab-
sorbed and hence only binding noise contributes For
diusion-limited binding the fundamental limit is given
by 8 10 11

III RECEPTOR DIFFUSION MODEL
In this model depicted in Fig 3 receptors are free
to diuse on the 2-dimensional 2D membrane surface
with diusion coecient D2 A receptor located in the
limited area A centered at x0 can bind and unbind
ligand of average concentration c with rates kc and k
respectively When a receptor leaves this area and dif-
fuses to the remaining large region of negligible ligand
concentration it can either release ligand or diuse back
in the area
We consider a situation in which receptor diusion has
reached a stationary condition resulting in a uniform den-
sity 0 of receptors on the membrane and this condition
is not changed by interaction with ligand molecules Lig-
and binding and unbinding only aects the number of
occupied and unoccupied receptors with respective den-
sities b and u given by
0  br  ur
where r  x y is a position on the 2D membrane sur-
face For purposes of comparison with the single immo-
bile receptor model we also assume that there is always
exactly one receptor in the area A around x0  r0 z0
ie 0  1
The dynamics of such a system is captured by the fol-
lowing set of coupled dierential equations

racy of sensing in two ways i by reducing the station-
ary value for the receptor occupancy and ii by reduc-
ing the noise from rebinding of already measured ligand
molecules
VI QUANTAL TRANSMISSION
A remarkable property of synaptic transmission is that
the amplitude of the synaptic response i e the excita-
tory post-synaptic current EPSC varies by an integral
multiple of a quantum This property rst unveiled by
the pioneering work of Katz 31 was traced to the forma-
tion of synaptic vesicles and subsequent pore formation
The latter leads to a release of glutamate into the synap-
tic cleft 32 This quantization is considered a way to
minimize the variability of the response from each con-
tributing synapse and therefore to allow ecient neural
computation This variability is quantied by the coe-
cient of variation CV dened as the standard deviation
devided by the mean value The reason for a large CV
is controversial cf Fig 7a but can be attributed to a
variation in the size of the vesicles carrying glutamate or
to the fact that large EPSCs are generated by multiple
vesicles 13 46 The experimental detection of EPSCs
with an amplitude distribution of more than one peak is
consistent with the latter explanation 33
In Fig 7a the experimental data taken from Ref 34
show EPSC peaks as a result of repetitive suprathresh-
old stimulation of granule cell somata in CA3 pyramidal
cells Some stimuli did not evoke an EPSC termed fail-
ures The histogram of successful events can be tted
with three Gaussian distributions showing the quantal
nature of the EPSC The peaks of the Gaussians corre-
spond to the discrete multiple values 7 14 and 21 pA
respectively
We can compare this distribution to the result pre-
dicted by the accuracy of sensing Specically we would
like to know if fast diusion helps resolve the EPSC
peaks A simple model based on the structural properties
of AMPAR was previously used to derive the dynamics
of glutamate binding and unbinding as well as channel
opening and closing 34 Based on this model the fol-
lowing relation connecting the current through the ion
channel of AMPAR and the concentration of glutamate
was deduced

where I0  and the Hill coecient n are parameters
provided in Ref 34 35 Based on Eq 41 the following
relation connecting the width in the distribution of EPSC
currents to the uctuations in glutamate concentration
can be derived

We further assume that a number N of receptors inde-
pendently contribute to the measurement i e

with the uncertainty of a single receptor given by Eq
39 Averaging over N  therefore further reduces the
uncertainty in Eq 43 and hence increases the accuracy
of sensing
From our calculations we found that the eect of lateral
receptor diusion is to increase the resolution of peaks
and so also the ability of the synapse to count the num-
ber of vesicles released into the synaptic cleft Note that
in order to resolve the EPSC peaks experimentally the
probability of vesicle release from the presynaptic side
was drastically reduced This was achieved by modulat-
ing the ratio of CaMg ions in the extracellular so-
lution resulting in a 50-60 reduction of peak currents
VII DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Our previous work on the fundamenal physical limit
of ligand sensing 12 led us to conclude that receptor
diusion by removing bound ligand from a region of
interest may reduce the local overcounting of ligand
molecules therefore potentially increasing the local ac-
curacy of sensing In this paper we set out to investigate
this possibility by constructing a mathematical model
that contains all the necessary ingredients to describe
the role of receptor diusion in ligand sensing We have
considered a receptor that can bind and unbind ligand
molecules as well as diuse on a 2D membrane Lig-
and is allowed to diuse in 3D space Using this model
we derived the uctuations in receptor occupancy in the
area of interest via a generalization of the FDT with the
introduction of an eective temperature 12 This ulti-
mately allowed us to derive an equation for the accuracy
of sensing
We applied our model to the biologically relevant case
of glutamate receptors which are responsible for trans-
mitting action potentials at neural synapses We found
that for AMPAR and NMDAR our model shows that the
lateral diusion of receptors increases their accuracy of
sensing and hence may allow synapses to count the num-
ber of released vesicles However the local occupancy
uctuations are decreased only for AMPAR for NMDAR
these uctuations are increased This dierence is due to
the smaller unbinding rate of the latter receptor Conse-
quently the accuracy of sensing for NMDAR is an order
of magnitude smaller than for AMPAR It is important
to remark that these results are consistent with the dier-
ent roles these receptors play In fact the transmission
of an excitatory potential through a synapse occurs in
several steps Initially it is AMPAR which senses gluta-
mate and by letting in ions starts a small depolarization
of the membrane This in turn allows NMDAR to open
its channel and start an even bigger inux of ions es-
pecially Ca This stimulates the production of more
AMPARs and so increases the strength and sensitivity
of the synapses Sensitivity to glutamate is important
for AMPAR while the roles of NMDAR are coincidence
detection and amplication important for long-term po-
tentiation and memory
Figure 7b shows that the distributions of predicted EP-
SCs is in qualitative agreement with the experiments
In order to derive the accuracy of sensing for diusing
receptors we made a number of symplifying assumptions

We neglected uctuations in the total receptor density
and vesicle size assumed to be constant 13 46 Fur-
thermore we assumed a constant ligand concentration
in the hotspot area A during the receptor measure-
ment time while in reality the concentration prole will
broaden out Additionally we made the simplifying as-
sumption that multiple vesicles are released in the same
spot so that released glutamate concentrations add up
and that other eects such as spillover from neighboring
cells can be neglected 42 43 Finally we introduced
the eective temperature Te to generalize the FDT to
non-equilibrum processes 12 3639 The approximate
nature of Te for which we neglected any potential time
or frequency dependence limits the quantitative valid-
ity of our model to small deviations from equilibrium
In fact for large receptor diusion coecients the occu-
pancy uctuations and hence the accuracy of sensing be-
come unphysical Nevertheless the mapping of receptor
diusion to an eective internalization process already
studied in Ref 12 provides condence in our method
In conclusion in this paper we highlighted the role
of diusion in increasing the accuracy of sensing This
might be important for synaptic counting of glutamate
vesicles This hypothesis can be tested experimentally by
reducing the mobility of receptors This can be achieved
by cross-linking or addition of cholesterol Alternatively
the glutamate diusion costant can be reduced by adding
dextran Such perturbations should lead to a broadening
of the EPSC peaks although signaling may be aected
as well Similarly to AMPAR 15 an increase in re-
ceptor diusion upon ligand binding was recently also
observed in the pseudopods of migrating Dictyostelium
discoideum cells 40 This phenomenon was attributed
to signal amplication However since cells may sense
locally in pseudopods at least in shallow gradients 41
receptor diusion may also be responsible for increasing
the accuracy of sensing
