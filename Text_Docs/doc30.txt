This paper presents a review of the topic of galaxy formation and evolution focusing on basic
features of galaxies and how these observables reveal how galaxies and their stars assemble over
cosmic time I give an overview of the observed properties of galaxies in the nearby universe
and for those at higher redshifts up to z  10 This includes a discussion of the major processes
in which galaxies assemble and how we can now observe these - including the merger history
of galaxies the gas accretion and star formation rates I show that for the most massive galax-
ies mergers and accretion are about equally important in the galaxy formation process between
z  1  3 while this likely differs for lower mass systems I also discuss the mass differential
evolution for galaxies as well as how environment can affect galaxy evolution although mass
is the primary criteria for driving evolution I also discuss how we are beginning to measure the
dark matter content of galaxies at different epochs as measured through kinematics and clustering
Finally I review how observables of galaxies and the observed galaxy formation process com-
pares with predictions from simulations of galaxy formation nding signicant discrepancies in
the abundances of massive galaxies and the merger history I conclude by examining prospects
for the future using JWST Euclid SKA and the ELTs in addressing outstanding issues

Galaxy Formation Where Do We Stand
Christopher J Conselice
1 Introduction
Anyone trying to understand the formation of the universe must consider galaxies Often used
as a tracer population of the underlying matter it is becoming clear that the history and physics
of the formation of galaxies is a critical aspect for obtaining a full picture of the evolution of the
universe Yet we are really just starting to understand this and uncertainties in our measurements of
evolution remain large although signicant progress has been made in outlining the basic problem
What is better understood is the observations of galaxies which ultimately should reveal how
the galaxies themselves have formed and evolved In the local universe we have a solid under-
standing of the galaxy population based on large surveys such as SDSS and GAMA eg Driver
et al 2011 Galaxies which are ellipticalpassive along with spirals that have active star formation
dominate the local population The stellar and luminosity functions of nearby galaxies are also well
measured eg Loveday et al 2012 and we now understand when the stars in these galaxies were
formed based on detailed stellar population analyses
What we do not yet understand is how or when these galaxies assembled There has however
been signicant progress on addressing some of the issues related to this in the last 10-15 years
For example the rst measurements of galaxy properties at high redshift showed that the star
formation rate is larger at higher redshifts than at lower redshifts eg Madau et al 1998 but this
only reveals when stars form not necessarily when galaxies assemble We have some idea of this
through observing the merger history of galaxies eg Le Fevre et al 2000 Conselice et al 2003
2008 Hammer et al 2009 Lotz et al 2008 2011 Bluck et al 2009 2012 Man et al 2012
Lopez-Sanjuan et al 2012 and other modes such as gas accretion are now also being measured
eg Conselice et al 2012 It is also important to realise that the questions of when the stars form
in galaxies we see today and when the galaxies themselves form are distinct It is also important
to remember that these issues often must be addressed separately
Traditionally the approach taken towards understanding the physics behind galaxy formation
is to use galaxy observables such as luminositymass functions relations between observables
such as velocities and luminosities to test models These models starting with simple collapse
ones Eggen et al 1962 implement basic physics and subsequently predict the observables This
is now a large industry and theory has revealed many clues towards understanding how galaxy
formation has occurred although as we discuss later 5 there are still signicant problems with
theory matching galaxy observables
Overall in this review I place galaxy studies into three different classes 1 Observables ie
measured or derived directly from telescopes - this includes galaxy masses luminosities internal
velocities sizes morphologies etc 2 Measuring galaxy history ie how does the mass assem-
blystar formation merging and evolution in scaling relationship occur 3 Finally physics - what
are the mechanisms driving the history of the observed assembly An important side question is
whether we have identied all of these processes Within this framework the observables are rst
needed then the history of the galaxy formation can be derived which inuences and leads into
our understanding of the physics Each of these three are active areas of research and can and often
help guide the development of the other two
This review will describe the observations of galaxies up to redshifts of z  10 and how we are
now able to measure the history of galaxy formation in detail up to at least z  3 but only currently

for the most massive systems with log M  11 For these systems we are obtaining a good idea of
the formation mechanisms of galaxies We demonstrate this through measuring the merger history
of these galaxies and the amount of cold gas accreted from the intergalactic medium at redshifts
1  z  3 We show that these two processes are about equal in importance and that minor mergers
are as important as major mergers in forming galaxies We also discuss how well theory is able to
reproduce some of these properties and discuss signicant issues that still needing addressing We
use a standard cosmology of H0  70 km s1 Mpc1 and W m  1  W

2 Observations
21 Nearby Galaxies
Nearby galaxies at z  03 have been studied in detail since the 1920s and in many ways we
know the most about galaxy properties and observables from examining nearby systems What we
know is that 75 of galaxies brighter than MB  20 are spiral or disk in morphology with 22
SOelliptical and the remaining 2 are peculiarirregular Conselice 2006 Being nearby and thus
relatively easy to study many properties of nearby galaxies have been measured in detail including
their stellar mass and luminosity functions eg Loveday et al 2012 Taylor et al 2011 as well as
their detailed surface brightness distributions and internal kinematics eg Cappellari et al 2011
Kelvin et al 2012
Perhaps the most useful observation that can be performed on nearby galaxies in terms of
their formation histories is to study in detail their stellar populations through absorption lines eg
Figure 1 Plots showing basic features of the nearby galaxy population as a function of stellar mass The left
panel shows the colour-mass diagram for nearby systems showing a clear differential between red galaxies
on the red sequence and blue galaxies in the blue cloud This correlates very strongly at z  0 with galaxy
morphology with ellipticals found in the red sequence red points and spiralsmergers blue points in the
blue cloud The right panel shows the distribution of morphology as a function of stellar mass in the nearby
universe with a smooth transition from early to late types at lower masses Conselice 2006
Galaxy Formation Where Do We Stand
Christopher J Conselice
Trager et al 2000 Thomas et al 2005 These studies have found that the formation history of
the stars in galaxies depends strongly upon their stellar mass and less so on their environment
The most massive systems are dominated by old stars such that single stellar population ages
of their stellar masses are older than 5 Gyr Trager et al 2000 By comparing absorption line
strengths to models it can be shown that the most massive galaxies also contain the most a enriched
stellar populations demonstrating a quick formation for the stellar populations within these massive
galaxies eg Thomas et al 2005 The stars in lower mass systems form later although this may
not be the case in the densest environments There is furthermore a lack of strong environmental
effects such that galaxies in the most dense areas appear to have similar ages as those in lower
densities The effects of environment appear to be less important and progressively so at higher
redshifts eg Grtzbauch et al 2011ab 42
This is also seen in the distribution of morphology and star formation in the local universe as
a function of stellar mass whereby the lowest mass galaxies are the most likely to have a spiral or
irregular morphology and higher star formation rates and bluer colours eg Baldry et al 2006
Conselice 2006 see Fig 1 There is in fact a very strong correlation such that the value of a
galaxys stellar mass averaged over all environments is a strong predictor for the morphology and
star formation histories of individual galaxies
In terms of galaxy evolution another important insight that local galaxies provides is a nearby
benchmark by which we can gauge how galaxy properties have changed as a function of redshift
In this review I focus on the evolution of galaxy masses morphologies and kinematics I do not
provide a detailed study of other features of nearby galaxies here such as how galaxy clustering
or environment correlates with the properties or evolution of nearby galaxies although see eg
Kauffmann et al 2004 for a discussion of this
22 Distant Galaxies The Universe at z  1
The epoch of high redshift studies of galaxies began in earnest due to deep Hubble Space Tele-
Figure 2 Morphological evolution of the galaxy population from Mortlock et al 2013 The black lines are
for galaxies classied as peculiar as in Conselice et al 2011b and the red lines are for galaxies classied
as ellipticals and the blue lines those as disks These have been corrected for redshift effects by determining
how structure changes due to redshift effects as detailed in simulations see Mortlock et al 2013 There is
a clear evolution in structure such that the most massive galaxies form normal Hubble types before lower
mass systems

scope observations eg Ferguson et al 2000 and with the rst 8-10m telescope observations of
Lyman-break galaxies LBGs Steidel et al 1996 both quickly leading to the rst measurements
of the star formation history of galaxies eg Madau et al 1996 Since that time observations
with the HST have pushed observations of LBGs up to z  8 and perhaps beyond Yan et al 2012
up to z  10 eg Coe et al 2012 While we are still detecting galaxies at progressively higher
redshifts and have unlikely seen the rst galaxies yet we are able to make observations of these
systems during the 13 Gyr time period when most galaxy assembly has occurred
The observables that are most commonly investigated for galaxies beyond the local universe
are similar to what we can measure for nearby galaxies including masses luminosities mor-
phologies sizes kinematics and clustering as well as derived quantities such as star formation
rates and gas masses Observationally is makes sense to divide high redshift galaxies into four
epochs largely for observationally reasons These are z  1 1  z  3 3  z  6 and z  6
Each of these epochs is studied in slightly different ways and obviously we know progressively
less about the more distant and earlier epochs
The universe up to z  1 at half its current age in many ways looks similar to the universe
today It is still uncertain what fraction of the stellar mass was assembled by z  1 but it is likely
more than half eg Mortlock et al 2011 The morphologies of z  1 galaxies are also very
similar to those that we see in the local universe with a similar fraction of different types eg
Conselice et al 2005a however these galaxies have more of a clumpy structure overlayed on their
primary Hubble types spirals ellipticals eg Elmegreen et al 2007
At higher redshifts particularly at z  2 the universe of galaxies is quite different from to-
day In general galaxies are bluer smaller more asymmetric and contain higher star formation
rates Attempts to understand the evolution of this includes measuring luminosity and mass func-
tions eg Bouwens et al 2011 evolution of stellar populations and colours eg Finkelstein et
al 2012 morphological evolution including sizes and surface brightness prole evolution eg
Conselice et al 2005a 2008 2011 Buitrago et al 2011 Weinzirl et al 2012 clustering evolution
eg Foucaud et al 2011 and star formation evolution eg Bouwens et al 2010 Also z  1
systems have smaller radii at a given mass than local galaxies at the same stellar mass eg Trujillo
et al 2007 Buitrago et al 2008 suggesting some evolution throughout time to increase the sizes
of galaxies by some still uncertain process Ownsworth et al 2012 See these papers for details of
these various issues
As one example Figure 2 shows the morphological evolution for galaxies from the CANDELS
survey Mortlock et al 2013 in prep demonstrating how there is both a redshift and stellar mass
dependence on morphology As can be seen at z  3 the morphological fraction is dominated by
galaxies that appear peculiar in appearance the black circles and lines while at lower redshifts
towards z  1 the classical Hubble type galaxies - those identiable as disks or ellipticals start
to become the dominant population eg Buitrago et al 2011 The other interesting feature of
this evolution is that there is a mass dependence such that this transition from peculiar to normal
galaxy is at higher redshifts for higher mass galaxies This transition redshift is z  222  087 for
log M  105 galaxies z  175  076 for 1025  log M  105 galaxies and z  173  056
for log M  1025 systems
There is also strong star formation evolution from z  0 to z  1 such that the total star
formation rate density averaged over all galaxies at z  1 is a few times higher per co-moving
Galaxy Formation Where Do We Stand
Christopher J Conselice
volume element than in todays universe eg Bouwens et al 2010 However the star formation
rate peaks and is roughly constant at a given stellar mass between 1  z  3 Fig 3 such that
a typical massive galaxy will double its stellar mass due to this star formation over the epoch
1  z  3 and lower mass galaxies grow even larger Later we investigate the relative role of
this star formation in growing the stellar masses of galaxies and what this reveals about their
formation 3 At even higher redshifts the total star formation density declines at z  3 up to
z  7 Bouwens et al 2010 although the specic star formation rate for the most massive galaxies
is relatively constant Stark et al 2009 suggesting some star formation regulation process might
be at work
Perhaps the most basic way to address when galaxies form is however to compare the stellar
mass distribution of distant galaxies to that of galaxies in the nearby universe This is particularly
the case for the most massive systems as these form before low mass galaxies eg Bundy et al
2006 Mortlock et al 2011 and are the easiest galaxies to simulate in computers and are thus an
invaluable test of galaxy formation models eg Conselice et al 2011b Massive galaxies have
been studied in detail using various surveys from the Hubble Space Telescope within deep pointed
surveys Mortlock et al 2011 as well wider area surveys using imaging from telescopes such as
UKIRT within the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey Hartley et al 2010
There is a strong signature of galaxy downsizing in almost all galaxy properties up to at least
z  3 such that the highest mass galaxies tend to shut down formation modes including AGN
before the lower mass galaxies Essentially this means that high mass galaxies nish forming
Figure 3 Relation between stellar mass and star formation rate for galaxies from log M  95 12 The star
formation rate increases with stellar mass on average during this epoch although the specic star formation
rate drops at higher masses The star formation relation with mass is also fairly constant during this epoch
from Bauer et al 2011

before lower mass ones For example when examining the abundances of massive galaxies with
M  1011 M  the measured number densities up to z  1  2 are similar to what is found in the
local universe at the same stellar mass limit eg Conselice et al 2011b Mortlock et al 2011
Therefore to study the properties of the the most massive galaxies and to examine their formation
observationally we must go to higher redshifts namely at z  2
Recent results have accomplish this by examining the most massive systems at 15  z  3 with
Hubble Space Telescope surveys that can resolve these systems This includes the CANDELS sur-
vey Grogin et al 2011 and the GOODS NICMOS Survey GNS Conselice et al 2011b Recent
results from these surveys have shown that the formation modes for the most massive galaxies are
dominated by mergers Bluck et al 2009 2012 and the accretion of gas from the intergalactic
medium Conselice et al 2012 with the bulk of this formation occurring at z  1 Mortlock et al
2011 We explain below the reasoning behind these results and how others have found similar
conclusions The below analysis has only been carried out for the highest mass galaxies so far
although in the future lower mass systems can be analysed in a similar way using deeper data
3 Empirical Galaxy Formation
31 The Role of Mergers up to z  3
Galaxy assembly is a combination of at least three processes These are merging with existing
galaxies the accretion of cold gas from the intergalactic medium and the conversion of in-situ
initial gas into stars in a galaxy over time Understanding the relative role of these processes
and how these vary as a function of stellar mass and environment is one of the major goals of
extragalactic astronomy
We now have some idea about the role of mergers in galaxy assembly eg Conselice et al
2003 Lotz et al 2008 Bluck et al 2012 While mergers can dominate much of the evolution
within galaxies including triggering star formation and AGN instigating morphological changes
etc we are mainly interested here in how it builds up the stellar masses of galaxies over time
The amount of stellar mass added to a galaxy due to the merger process is given by the integral
over the merger history based on the fraction of galaxies merging and the time-scale for mergers
eg Bluck et al 2009 2012 Bluck et al 2012 and Conselice et al 2012 carry out this
integration using the observed merger history measured directly from the GNS sample of massive
galaxies at 15  z  3 Fig 4 and the modeled time-scale for mergers eg Bluck et al 2009
Using pairs of galaxies and galaxies involved in merging as seen through the CAS system we
can now measure accurately the merger history up to z  3 eg Bluck et al 2012 and references
within The total amount of stellar mass accreted into a galaxy is a double integral over the
redshift range of interest z1 to z2 corresponding to look-back times t1 and t2 and over the stellar
masses which we probe M1 to M2 which for the GNS sensitive down to M  1095 M  can be
expressed as
MM  Z t2
t1 Z M2
M 
mzM
t mM
dMdz
Galaxy Formation Where Do We Stand
Christopher J Conselice
where t mM is the merger time-scale which depends on the stellar mass of the merging pair
Bluck et al 2012 The total integration of the amount of mass assembled through merging gives
MMM0  056  015 where M0 is the initial average stellar mass of the GNS massive
galaxy sample This is the fractional amount of stellar mass added due to both major and minor
mergers for systems with stellar mass ratios down to 1100 for the average massive GNS galaxy
after following a merger adjusted constant co-moving density Conselice et al 2012
However to fully understand the total baryonic mass assembly of galaxies due to the merger
process we also need to account for how much gas mass is brought into these systems through
mergers This is calculated by integrating the amount of gas in these merging systems using an
empirical t to the relationship between the gas mass fraction m gas and the stellar mass found at
z  2  3 Overall the lower mass galaxies contribute the bulk of the gaseous mass from mergers
whereas most of the stellar mass accreted in mergers arises from higher mass ratio mergers We
show this relative role of mergers in Figure 4 This relation can then be used to calculate for the
GNS sample how much gas mass is added due to merging nding MgMM0  MMM0 
fg  057015 Over the redshift interval z  0  3 major and minor mergers are roughly equal in
terms of importance in building up galaxies
The high number of minor mergers is also a solution to the size problem in massive galaxies
When examining the effective radii of massive galaxies at redshifts z  05 they are much smaller
than galaxies of similar masses in todays universe eg Buitrago et al 2008 Trujillo et al 2007
Weinzirl et al 2011 How these galaxies expand to become the large galaxies we see today is
not well understood However by examining the number of minor mergers we observe from z  3
down and by using simple physics it is possible to show that these mergers provide enough mass
at the right locations to expand the measured sizes of galaxies by up to a factor of ve Bluck et
al 2012 This is therefore likely the solution to the problem of how galaxies can be so compact at
high redshift but still have signicantly high stellar masses see also Ownsworth et al 2012
32 Gas Accretion From the Intergalactic Medium
One important observation of high redshift massive galaxies with log M  11 M is that these
systems have an average star formation rate that is relatively constant at 15  z  3 and declines at
z  15 Fig 3 This star formation increases the stellar mass within these systems by an amount
which approximately doubles it This is a high star formation rate and the amount of gas mass
accreted due to merging plus the original amount of gas is not enough to sustain the star formation
present Papovich et al 2011 Conselice et al 2012
We can show based on this that the amount of gas accreted into a massive GNS galaxies
is MgAM0  070  022 Conselice et al 2012 such that an amount of mass on the order
the entire initial stellar mass of a massive galaxy is added over time outside of mergers to form
stars during 15  z  3 a time span of  2 Gyr This reveals a net gas accretion which is
then turned into stars of 61  19 M yr1 When considering that these galaxies have outows
eg Weiner et al 2009 that could easily double the amount of gas mass needed to be accreted
from the IGM eg Faucher-Giguere et al 2011 we nd that the gross inow rate increasing to
Macc  96  19M yr1
The result of this is that gas accretion accounts for 4920 of the stellar matter added to
galaxies from 15  z  3 Mergers account for the remainder of the mass assembly with 12 of
Galaxy Formation Where Do We Stand
Christopher J Conselice
this minor mergers and 12 of this major mergers Bluck et al 2012 Gas accretion however is
responsible for 6620 of all new star formation during this epoch within log M  11 galaxies
Overall this implies that gas accretion into massive galaxies at early epochs is potentially a major
formation method and dominates over mergers as a formation mechanism for new stars This is
however a rst estimate of this quantity and future studies with wider and deeper surveys will
measure this number with more accuracy in the future
This measured gas accretion rate is roughly consistent with theoretical calculations which
predict a similar amount of gas accretion eg Murali et al 2002 Dekel et al 2009 Some of
the rst predictions of the gas accretion by Murali et al 2002 found a gas accretion rate of MgA
 40 M yr1 while more recent work suggests higher rates of MgA  100 M yr1 eg Dekel
et al 2009 Faucher-Giguere et al 2011 These rst results on measuring cold gas accretion are
in general agreement with these models although this measurement should be redone for larger
samples and at lower masses to determine the role of mergers vs accretion as a function of stellar
4 Role of Environment
41 Galaxy Clustering and Dark Matter Halos
One of the new frontiers of studying galaxies and their evolution is to examine how they cluster
together and what this reveals of their halo masses as well as their environment The summary
of how this evolution occurs is shown in Figure 5 based on results from Foucaud et al 2010 In
Figure 4 Plots showing the role of mergers both major and minor and gas accretion in forming galaxies at
z  1  3 The left panel shows the merger fraction for systems with stellar masses log M  11 Shown at
the top of the left panel are the stellar masses of the lower mass galaxies merging with these massive galaxies
down to log M  95 demonstrating that minor mergers are more common than major mergers Bluck et al
2012 The right panel shows the relative amounts of mass added to these massive galaxies due to mergers
revealing that most of the gas is brought in by lower mass galaxies while higher mass galaxies add most of
the stellar mass Conselice et al 2012
Galaxy Formation Where Do We Stand
Christopher J Conselice
general the most massive galaxies are the most clustered with correlation lengths of r0  10-15
h1 Mpc from redshifts 05  z  2 Hartley et al 2010 Interestingly there does not appear to be
a strong trend with redshift such that the most stellar massive systems have the highest clustering
values up to z  2 At higher redshifts the clustering strength increases at a xed stellar mass such
that the most massive halos assemble their stellar mass before lower mass ones
The clustering strengths of these galaxies can be converted into halo masses by matching the
abundances of galaxies selected by stellar mass into a corresponding halo mass from N-body sim-
ulations within a given cosmology eg Mo  White 2002 Using this method it is therefore
possible to determine how the stellar to total mass ratio evolves for ensembles of galaxies as se-
lected through their stellar mass When comparing total masses to stellar masses the most massive
systems have the lowest stellar to total mass ratios Fig 5 This implies that something is ei-
ther shutting off star formation within the most massive galaxies or more likely that halo masses
contain sub-halos which contribute to their total masses Systems with total masses Mhalo  1013
M have stellar mass to halo mass ratios of  001 while this ratio goes down to  01 for systems
with Mhalo  1011 M  although we know that dwarf systems also have very low MMhalo ratio
Penny et al 2009
Related to the stronger clustering at higher redshifts it is also clear that at xed stellar mass
the ratio of stellar to halo mass increases at lower redshifts at a given halo mass This implies
that there is a halo downsizing such that the most massive halos form stars rst and only after a
few Gyr do lower mass halos form enough stars for their systems to enter the same stellar mass
selection This thereby lowers the ratio of stellar to halo mass given that these late comers to a
given mass bin are in lower mass halos which lowers the clustering strength of the population
selected by this stellar mass range Note however that is it not clear if this is a general result or
simply for galaxies selected by stellar mass For example disk galaxies up to z  14 shows very
little evolution in the stellar mass to total mass ratios Conselice et al 2005b or alternatively in
the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation eg Conselice et al 2005b Miller et al 2011
Integral eld spectroscopy for z  1 systems has also revealed important clues about the nature
of these high redshift galaxies Frster Schreiber et al 2009 These studies typically nd an equal
distribution of systems which are 1 rotationally dominated 2 mergers and 3 systems that have
high velocity dispersions but which are very compact The true nature of these systems has yet
to be revealed but clearly the kinematics of distant galaxies shows signicant differences from
galaxies in the local universe More IFU studies of larger samples of galaxies are currently needed
as there are at most only a few hundred IFU spectra measured for z  1 galaxies thus far
42 Environment vs Mass - Which Dominates
Since galaxies were rst studied and especially since the paper by Dressler 1980 there has
been a recurring question of the role of environment in driving galaxy formationevolution It is
clear that in the local universe disk galaxies are more likely found in low density environments
while early-type systems are found in denser ones eg Dressler 1980 However this effect
is most pronounced in extreme environments and it is not clear beyond these extremely dense
environments how say a modestly dense environment would affect galaxy evolution over a very
low density environment
Galaxy Formation Where Do We Stand
Christopher J Conselice
This was examined in detail by Grtzbauch et al 2011ab who looked at galaxy colours
and star formation rates as a function of both environmental density as well as a function of stellar
mass and redshift What was very clear is that while there is some environmental effect such that
galaxies are redder in denser areas Grzbauch et al 2011a this effect is most pronounced at
lower redshifts typically at z  1 At redshifts higher than this the effects of environment are very
minimal eg Grzbauch et al 2011a
On the ip-side of this when comparing galaxy colours and star formation rates with stellar
masses there is a much stronger correlation such that the most galaxies have red colours compared
to lower mass galaxies as well as having a higher star formation rate at higher redshift Grtzbauch
et al 2011b Fig 6 There is also very little trend in galaxy properties with the overall halo mass in
which a galaxy is located demonstrating that environment as measured by the number of nearby
galaxies and the total mass of the groupcluster a galaxy is located has very little effect on the
observed properties of galaxies This is consistent with there being very little trend in age or star
formation history for local galaxies as measured through stellar spectra tting eg Thomas et al
2005 21
These correlations show that the stellar mass or likely the halo mass of an individual galaxy
is the overall most important aspect for how these systems form and evolve This is possibly re-
lated to the fact that galaxies with higher masses have more massive black holes and that AGNs
are signicantly active during this epoch depositing 35 times the binding energy into the galaxy
over 1  z  3 on average eg Bluck et al 2011 Larger black holes produce more energy back
Figure 5 The relationship between the halo mass and the ratio of stellar to halo mass left panel as well
as this ratio of masses as a function of redshift right panel Foucaud et al 2010 As shown the amount
of stellar mass relative to dark matter mass declines at higher redshifts for systems with larger halo masses
Furthermore there is some evidence that the highest mass halos are populated earlier than low mass ones
with the result being that for a given stellar mass selection there is a higher ratio of stellar to dark matter
mass at lower redshifts

Figure 6 The right panel and left panels show the relationship between galaxy rest-frame colour and en-
vironment as measured through 1s  and stellar mass Grtzbauch et al 2011a This relations are also
shown as a function of redshift in three panels The left panels shows how the relationship between environ-
ment and colour such that there is very little trend between these while the right panel shows that there is a
strong correlation between the stellar mass and colour such that higher mass galaxies are always on average
redder than lower mass systems This strong trend continues up to z  3 eg Grtzbauch et al 2011b
into their host galaxies and this is possibly the reason why mass is such as dening characteristic
of galaxies This may also explain how downsizing occurs rst for the most massive galaxies al-
though nding direct proof that AGNblack holes have a signicant effect on gas and star formation
in galaxies remains elusive
5 How Well Does Theory Predict Galaxy Evolution
Understanding how galaxy formation occurs was initially rst calculated using the ages of
different stellar populations in the Galaxy Eggen et al 1965 and the default initial assumption
was that galaxies formed like stars in a monolithic-type collapse In the 1980s the rst computer
simulations of structure formation showed that a universe dominated by Cold Dark Matter CDM
matched observations of galaxy clustering on large scales Davis et al 1985 and that within this
framework galaxy assembly should be hierarchical Blumenthal et al 1984
The situation today is that there are many simulations that are used to predict properties of the
galaxy population and how it evolves through time Signicant success has been reached when
predicting the properties and scaling relationships of galaxies yet problems still exist eg Guo et
al 2011 While there are famous problems such as the satellite and the CDM dark matter prole
problem there are also issues when examining how the evolution of galaxies occurs and trying to
match this with the theory
I focus here on the much less well known problems of CDM in predicting galaxy evolution at
high-redshift While semi-analytical CDM models can predict local galaxy properties well eg
Bower et al 2006 Guo et al 2011 there are very signicant differences between observations
Galaxy Formation Where Do We Stand
Christopher J Conselice
and theory when probing at higher redshift One of these is that most semi-analytical simulations
are not able to reproduce the abundances or the formation history of massive galaxies through
mergers eg Conselice et al 2007 Bertone  Conselice 2009 Marchesini et al 2010 Guo et al
2011 for further information on problems in other galaxy predictions using CDM see eg Guo et
al 2011
Specically the number densities of massive galaxies with log M  11 are under-predicted in
CDM galaxy formation models at z  2 eg Conselice et al 2007 Marchesini et al 2010 Guo et
al 2011 Fig 7 The difference with CDM models can be up to a factor of 10 or higher up to z  2
While some CDM models attempt to get around the star formation downsizing through merging
existing but quiescent galaxies at z  1 De Lucia et al 2006 these systems are clearly already
well formed by this time To further investigate the problem of matching observables with theory
requires that we investigate how the formation process of galaxies occurs and whether models can
reproduce these known formation modes One of major methods for doing this is to investigate
how well CDM models can reproduce the formation history of galaxies as seen through processes
such as merging
For example Bertone  Conselice 2009 compare the merger history of galaxies to the pre-
dictions from the Millennium simulation This comparison shows that the Millennium simulation
underpredicts the number of major mergers by a similar order of magnitude factor of 10 that it
underpredicts the abundances of galaxies Fig 7 The reasons for this are unclear but may re-
late to either underlying cosmological assumptions or the way in which baryons are implement
Figure 7 Plot showing issues with CDM simulation results The left panel show the evolution of the number
densities for galaxies with stellar masses between M  1011 10115 M and galaxies with M  10115 M 
For the most massive systems there is a signicant difference in the numbers of massive galaxies and the
CDM prediction from the semi-analytical Millennium simulation up to a factor of 100 Conselice et al
2007 The right panel shows the comparison between the major merger history and simulations based on
CDM Bertone  Conselice 2009 The blue solid line shows the prediction for the same quantities as the
points demonstrating values that are signicantly lower than the observations

in these simulations Future work including investigating the underlying role of dark matter and
other cosmological features will have to be included in future theoretical research on how galaxies
6 Summary and Outlook for the Future
The basic ideas presented in this review is that we can observationally determine how galaxy
formation occurs and do not have to rely on comparing basic observables to models to understand
this history I have shown how we now have some understanding for how the most massive galaxies
with M  1011 M assembled their stellar mass and baryons at z  3  showing that likely mergers
and gas accretion are equally important during this epoch Observations of higher redshift galaxies
are still very new especially in terms of having stellar mass completed samples although progress
will be quickly made with surveys such as CANDELS UKIDSS UDS and VISTA
While we have learned quite a bit about the history of the formation of massive galaxies
probing the star formation and merger rates there is still a signicant amount regarding galaxies
that we are still just starting to explore Some of these outstanding issues that have not been fully
addressed include how disk galaxies and their structures spiral arms bars form and what the
nature of massive galaxies themselves are at z  2 as these systems are not analogs to any local
galaxies in almost every way
Deep and wide eld surveys such as with Euclid and WFIRST will carry out large imaging
surveys that will address the problem of galaxy evolution in great detail providing the large and
deep elds that Hubble and ground based telescopes cannot provide However what is also needed
is kinematic measurements alongside structural measurements to truly decipher the nature of distant
galaxies We are just starting to scratch the surface of what can be done but in the near future
instruments such as KMOS on the VLT and in the future the ELTs will provide large numbers of
IFU spectra through surveys
We have also not yet detected the rst galaxies to form although we are pushing the limits
eg Yan et al 2012 JWST and the ELTs will provide a deep probe of the universe such that
we will likely see the rst galaxies and perhaps stars forming especially utilising the benets of
gravitational lensing eg Coe et al 2012 The next generation of radio telescopes such as SKA
and its precursors will furthermore allow us to measure the still largely uncertain properties of gas
within distant galaxies including the important question of how the gas content evolves with time
This will allow us to complete our physical and empirical knowledge of galaxy formation
