Abstract 
The immune system recognizes a myriad of invading pathogens and their toxic 
products  It does so with a finite repertoire of antibodies and T cell receptors  We 
here describe theories that quantify the immune system dynamics  We describe 
how the immune system recognizes antigens by searching the large space of 
receptor molecules  We consider in some detail the theories that quantify the 
immune response to influenza and dengue fever  We review theoretical 
descriptions of the complementary evolution of pathogens that occurs in response 
to immune system pressure  Methods including bioinformatics molecular

find regions of favorable free energy so too in evolution there is a search through 
sequence space to find proteins pathways and organisms of high fitness  The immune 
system is a real-time example of evolution as our body creates and modifies molecules 
of the immune system in response to invading pathogens  Many pathogens respond to 
this immune pressure by evolving themselves  The present article is a brief appraisal of 
the literature in theoretical aspects of the adaptive vertebrate immune system 
biology interesting 1  Finite timescales in biology bring out the importance of 
dynamics and finite population sizes bring out the importance of randomness 
correlations and fluctuations  Biological information and structure is organized 
hierarchically and modularity is a key principle that we will use in describing the 
immune system  At a deeper level the emergence of the adaptive immune system in 
jawed vertebrates several hundred million years ago is an example of spontaneous 
emergence of modularity a symmetry breaking phase transition by which biology itself 
emerged from organic chemistry several billion years ago 2 3  Finally the response of 
the immune system induces a complementary evolutionary dynamics in pathogens

2  Brief summary of the immune system 
Our immune system protects us against death by infection There are two major 
components of the adaptive vertebrate immune systemthe antibody-mediated humoral 
response and the T cell mediated cellular response In this article we discuss quantitative 
models of the immune system response to often highly variable pathogens The variation 
exists either because the disease mutates at a non-negligible rate or because the disease 
exists in multiple subtype forms 
immune system repertoires and the existence of immune system memory make the 
immune system response to variable viral diseases nontrivial  A number of reviews have 
covered some of the interesting aspects and challenges the immune system poses 4-7 
21  The humoral B cell immune response 
Virus bacteria and other pathogens are recognized and repelled from infecting 
our cells by antibodies proteins produced by our B cells  Antibodies recognize patches 
called antigens on the surface of pathogenic proteins  See Figure 1  To recognize the 
many different pathogens that can attack us we have a repertoire of different B cells  
Each different B cell produces a distinct antibody  The human immune system has on the 
order of 108 different B cells and the probability that a given antigen will be recognized 
by a given antibody is about 1 in 105 
The immune system uses a hierarchical strategy to search through the space of 
possible antibodies to find those which recognize antigens  There are about 100 amino 
acids in the variable region of an antibody chain and so there are about 20100 or 10130 
possible such structures  The immune system searches this large space with the sparse 
set of 108 structures available via a two step process  The first step is the initial creation 
of B cells that produce antibodies by joining together three different antibody fragments  
There are libraries of these fragments available in the genome of the individual and this 
diversity can create on the order of 1011 different structures although only 108 are present 
at one point in time  This assembly process is called VDJ recombination  When an 
The portion of the antibody that binds the antigen which is also the region that 
individual is challenged by a pathogen the B cells that produce the 1 in 105 subset of 
these initial antibodies that recognize the antigen are further optimized by a local search 
process  Essentially the DNA that encodes these antibodies is randomly mutated and 
the cells that make the antibodies that better recognize the antigen are expanded in 
concentration and number  This mutation and selection process is repeated for a number 
of rounds and leads to modified antibodies that strongly recognize the antigens of the 
pathogen  This second optimization process is called somatic hypermutation

recognize an antigen it does evolve a subset of antibodies that recognize the antigen  
The number of distinct antibodies produced in high concentrations is on the order of a 
half-dozen or so  Indeed the antibody response can typically be deconvoluted to 
responses from a few specific antibodies 8  These antibodies typically bind to non-
overlapping neutralizing epitopes on the pathogen  This set of epitopes on the surface of 
pathogenic proteins is termed the protective immunome 
undergoes somatic hypermutation is called the hypervariable region  The antibody 
protein structure in the hypervariable region is constrained to be loop-like largely 
independent of sequence  Fundamental computer simulations have verified this aspect of 
antibody structure 9  Interestingly simple molecular dynamics was insufficient to 
equilibrate these structures and hybrid Monte Carlo with multi-dimensional parallel 
tempering 10 was required  Parallel tempering simulations show that the hypervariable 
region while constrained to be loop-like is sufficiently flexible to bind a wide range of 
antigens 9 11 
211 The generalized NK GNK model 
through sequence space for antibodies with increased binding constants to antigen  The 
immune system response to an antigen generates a high concentration of only a few 
memory B cells in response to a pathogen   This focusing of the immune diversity results 
in a strong subsequent response to identical antigens but can reduce the effectiveness of 
a response to different but related antigens This competition between memory sequences 
and newly formed VDJ recombinations determines the effectiveness of a vaccine against 
a virus 
The dynamics of affinity maturation can be described theoretically as a search 
While the immune system does not evolve the single optimal antibody to 
The Deem group has developed a random energy theory that describes the 
dynamics of the immune system and the interaction between influenza antigens and 
antibodies  12  This theory takes into account both the ruggedness of the interaction 
energy landscape upon which the antibodies evolve and the correlations in this landscape 
that allow VDJ recombination to produce a viable naive repertoire The model is 
population based considering a population of B cells in one person a population of 
viruses and a population of individual people The random energy model permits study 
of the immune response at the level of individual antibodies and antigens  Absent this 
theory study of the molecular interactions in detail would be computationally 
prohibitive since there are many influenza strains 67  109 people 108 antibodies per 
individual  and 104 atoms per antibody  Use of random energy theory to treat 
correlations in complicated physical systems has a long pedigree in statistical physics 
and antigens  Each antibody is identified by its amino acid sequence and each antigen is 
represented by the coupling parameters in the theory  A successful immune response to 
an antigen corresponds in the theory to finding a set of amino acid sequences with low 
energy for the coupling parameters that represent the antigen  The spin-glass form of the 
GNK model makes the energy landscape rugged  The energy landscape has a structure 
however which is induced by the local antibody structure Usd the secondary antibody 
structure Usd-sd and the interaction with the influenza proteins Uc 2  
The generalized NK GNK model describes the interaction between antibodies 
The approach is innovative because the GNK model can predict 
An important feature of the theory is that the rugged landscape upon which the B 
cells that code for antibodies evolve is not completely random but rather has structure 
This structure is what allows productive VDJ recombinants to be formed  We were 
motivated to use a spin-glass or random energy model for the fitness landscape because 
we knew that evolution of proteins by point mutation alone is a slow process and hence 
the landscape must not be smooth Moreover we realized that the random energy model 
must be correlated because proteins have secondary structures at an intermediate length 
scale between the amino acid and the domain length scales  We used this theory to 
develop new subdomain swapping protocols for protein evolution 13 14 
immunodominance and cross reactivity The GNK model considers the full diversity of 
the B or T cell response and this is why it can predict phenomena such as 
immunodominance cross reactivity and original antigenic sin see Sections 213 71 
73 and 81 Traditional ODE models can be fit to but cannot predict 
immunodominance cross reactivity and vaccine efficacy data Traditional ODE models 
consider the immune dynamics within a small number of classes of immune cells eg 
naive activated and memory but do not consider the full diversity of 108 B or T cells 
that exist within the human immune system The GNK theory considers the full 108 
diversity and for this reason is able to predict the immune dynamics and vaccine efficacy 
that result from skewing of and interactions among this diversity 
212  Scaling theory of the B cell immune response 
insight into the principles of immune recognition 15  Larger animals have more mass 
to protect and so they have a larger immune system  In fact both the diversity and the 
A physically-motivated scaling theory of the immune system gives us some 
The scaling theory starts with the observation that the lifespan T0 of an animal 
total number of B cells is greater in larger animals  Scaling theory suggests how these 
quantities depend on the mass M of an animal 
scales with body mass as T0  M14  15  The immune system must be sufficiently 
protective that the animal survives pathogen attack for this period of time on average  
The mass of the animal is composed of M34 service volumes the volume of tissue 
supplied and drained by one capillary  Each service volume is of volume M14 and it is 
independently monitored by the immune system  The capillaries that supply blood flow 
to these service volumes are of universal size and function in all animals and so the 
amount of blood and antigens that enter the service unit per unit of time is independent of 
M  If one assumes that the mobility of the B cells is also independent of M then the time 
required for one B cell that is specific for one antigen to search each unit scales as the 
volume M14  To keep the time of detection constant with animal size there must be 
M14 copies of each B cells in each of the units  Thus the total number of copies of each 
B cell should scale as M14  M34M 
The second observation of scaling theory is that the total number of infections of 
an individual is proportional to the lifetime metabolic intake of the animal 15  The total 
metabolic rate of an animal scales as M34 according to Kleibers law  The lifetime 
scales as M14 and so the lifetime metabolic intake M  Thus the number of infections 
against which the immune system must protect is c M where c is some constant  The 
probability that an immune system with N different B cells will fail to recognize a 
specific pathogen is   1- V0VN  exp-N V0V where V0V is the fraction of antigens 
recognized by a specific antibody  The probability that all lifetime infections are 
successfully repelled is 1- cM  exp-cM  This probability should be near unity and 
so  c M  1  Using the expression for  we find N  VV0 lnc M 
copies of each B cell is consistent with known diversities in humans and mice 15  For 
example humans have roughly 108 different B cells with 105 copies of each  Mice 
which weigh about 20g roughly 3400x smaller in mass than humans have about 107 
different B cells with 10 copies of each  At small enough masses this scaling relation 
must break down  Using the numbers for human and mice we find c  012  g  Thus 
the scaling relation surely breaks down for c M  1 or M  8 g  Recent estimates of the 
immune repertoire size in zebrafish suggest a B cell diversity of 5000  6000 16  
Zebrafish however with an average mass of 03 g would not seem to be within the 
scaling regime  
213  Autoimmune disease and the functional role of glassy dynamics in the immune 
system 
system to rapidly recognize a wide variety of potential antigens  One might ask 
however if even more efficient evolutionary dynamics might be possible in the immune 
system and if so why such dynamics has not evolved into wide usage  In fact if the 
This prediction that the number of distinct B cells scales as ln c M with M 
The VDJ and somatic hypermutation hierarchy has evolved to allow the immune 
immune system continued with recombination during the somatic hypermutation process 
this would be more efficient dynamics 17 18  In other words antibodies that more 
strongly recognize antigens could be found with this process  It turns out however that 
these antibodies would bind not only their intended target but also other targets  See 
Figure 2  This off-target activity would lead to autoimmune disease  It would appear 
therefore that the slow glassy dynamics of evolution in the immune system serves a 
functional role to inhibit autoimmune disease 
This calculation also provides us with an estimate of how many antibodies might 
be needed to cover antigen space  As will be discussed in more detail below there is a 
natural measure of antigenic distance in sequence space which we term pepitope  The 
immune system primed by exposure to an antigen appears able to recognize other related 
antigens out to a distance of pepitope  019 19 to 045 20  Taking the larger number 
we find that such an immune response recognizes about

epitope

of all possible antigens where 
diversity to allow the generation of 109 memory antibodies not necessarily all at the 
same time would be able to recognize most antigens  This upper limit agrees well with 
the 108 nave diversity of the human antibody immune system

22  The cellular T cell immune response

TCRs to recognize antigenic peptide ligands that are presented by the MHC complex of 
individual cells 20 See Figure 3  Multiple identical TCRs on the cell membrane 
binding to the ligand activates the T cells which like antibodies are constructed from 
modular elements with each individual human having a diversity of approximately 2 
107 different receptors 22 
The cellular immune system performs a stochastic search of T cell receptors 
T cells originate in bone marrow and mature in the thymus They acquire their 
diversity through the stochastic process of VDJ recombination During the development 
of TCRs they undergo rounds of selection for increased avidity Unlike antibodies they 
do not undergo somatic hypermutation presumably because further evolution may yield 
TCRs with unnecessarily high affinity and cross-reactivity against other short peptides 
present in the body and cause autoimmune disease 17 18 Some mature T cells 
proliferate and produce effector T cells whereas others become memory cells 
The important components of the T cell response are the peptide-MHCI complex 
pMHC and the T cell receptor TCR Typically for CD8 T cells  the peptide is on the 
order of 9 amino acids long and the T cell-mediated response consists of cycles of 
concentration expansion and selection for favorable binding constants  The replication 
rate of T cells in the immune system is a function of the fitness given by the generalized 
NK model The binding energy quantifies activation of the T cells and specific lysis 
quantifies the rate of killing infected cells The replication rate defines replication and 
the binding energy quantifies activation  Some T cells are activated more than others T 
cell activation depends on their stimulation by antigen as well as other stimulatory 
factors within the immune system  See Figure 4 The difference in replication rate 
between different T cells as it depends on their stimulation by antigen is of interest in 
the theory of immunity and this difference depends on the amino acid identity of the 
TCR  Moreover the replication rate changes when the peptideMHCI complex to which 
the T cell binds changes  There are interactions within a subdomain of the TCR Usd 
interactions between subdomains of the TCR Usdsd interactions between the TCR and 
the peptide Upepsd and direct binding interaction between the TCR and peptide Uc as 
in Section 211 23 
pMHC where the binding constant K  is given by 23 
We use the GNK model to describe the interaction between the TCR and the 
The ability of one T cell to recognize an infected cell z is obtained by 
The specific lysis L or the probability that the infected cell is lysed by the T cell can be 
calculated using 
Figure 4 The GNK model of the TCR selection dynamics where antigen recognition 
expands T cell concentration according to their level of stimulation by the antigen Over 
10 cell divisions the concentration can expand by three orders of magnitude reducing the 
diversity to 05 in the primary response When a previously infected individual with 
A final theory of the T cell response is serial triggering 25  The mechanism of T 
memory cells to epitope A is subsequently exposed to a new epitope B the immune 
response shall be a combination of the memory response from the prior exposure to A 
and a nave response to B Our theory measures the contributions of both components  
From 23 
Another general theory of the T cell response is kinetic proofreading which 
seems to occur 24  The basic idea is that a series of binding interactions leading to 
activation can give a non-linear amplification of the signal  Denoting the complex 
between the T cell and the pMHC as C0 a series of intermediate activated complexes is 
denoted by Ci and the final active form is denoted CN  Each activated complex satisfies 
d Ci  d t  k Ci-1  k Ci  k-1 Ci          CN1  0 
Thus one finds that the ratio of final activated complex to total complex is CN  i Ci  
kkk-1N  Thus the amount of activated complex depends in a highly sensitive and 
non-linear way on the equilibrium constant for T cell and peptideMHC binding  In this 
way ligands of different affinity may elicit qualitatively different signals 
cell activation seems to require multiple interactions with the TCR not merely a single 
very high affinity interaction  Indeed if the affinity is too great for example due to a 
low-off rate then the TCR is not able to achieve a sufficient number of interactions  In 
this way the T cell has evolved into a sensitive detector of small numbers of antigenic 
determinants present on infected cells 
221 Self-immunity 
the lymph nodes and blood 26  Those T cells that bind no antigen in the thymus are 
eliminated  Those T cells that bind antigen weakly are kept  Those T cells that bind 
antigens from ones own proteins strongly are eliminated because they would cause 
cross-reactivity and autoimmune disorders  Thus T cell receptors are enhanced in weak-
binding amino acids Crystal structures support this conclusion that T cell recognition is 
via multiple modest interactions We can understand this suppression of strongly binding 
amino acids with the following physical argument 26  The interaction between the T 
cell receptor and the jth of the M peptides in the thymus is denoted by Elj and the 
cutoff to avoid negative selection is denoted by EN  Thus whether the T cell will 
survive negative selection ie not bind too strongly to any of the peptides is given by 
pl  j1 M EN  Elj  The average survival probability is pl   EN  
EljM where one has assumed that the peptide compositions are independent  Making 
the further assumption which we know from the GNK model is not true but which 
perhaps does not greatly detract from the present argument that the interaction energy 
between the T cell receptor and the peptide is a linear sum of terms due to each amino 
acid on the peptide Elj  i1
each of the j peptides  In other words the distribution of amino acids in the T cell 
receptor must be such that Jli  ENN  Thus since the peptides in the thymus are 
T cells created in the bone marrow pass through the thymus before proceeding to 
N Jlij we reach the conclusion that i1

The T cell receptor is bound to the surface of T cells  In some cases the receptors 
typical self peptides and the T cell receptor must bind them only weekly the amino acids 
in the T cell receptor should be the weakly binding amino acids

aggregate during a recognition event localizing the receptor antigen and kinases into a 
small area 27  This aggregation is now thought to regulate the degradation of the T cell 
receptors  A maximum of T cell signaling seems to occur for intermediate TCR-pMHC 
half lives  Too strong a binding does not allow serial triggering to cause activation and 
too weak a binding does not allow enough receptor binding to cause activation 
Advances in video microscopy revealed interactions between the T cell and 
antigen in lymph nodes 28  Three phases of T cell motion were found  The initial 
activation phase is termed phase I  Quantitative analysis showed that the duration of 
phase I which can be minutes to hours depends on the ratio of TCR-pMHC half life to 
the time of T cell  DC encounter 29  This ratio is a consolidated measure of antigenic 
quality and type 29 
3  Traditional ODE models of immune response and viral growth 
systems of ordinary differential equations ODEs that describe the time-dependent 
concentration profiles of pathogen antigen and B and T cells  A well studied case is that 
of HIV dynamics by the Los Alamos group 30  There are three phases of the disease 
initial growth of the virus due to exposure and then suppression of the virus by the 
immune system a long period of low virus concentration in the body and then finally 
growth of the virus again with a transition to AIDS  Mathematical modeling along with 
experiment revealed rather rapid virus and immune cell turnover during the second phase 
which had been previously thought to be a quiescent phase 
may simply be failed attempts at viral replication  These DI particles may also serve a 
functional role to inhibit the immune response against the viable virus particles  A 
difference equation approach was used to evaluate the effect of DI particles on vesicular 
stomatitis virus VSV growth 31  At low DI particle concentrations both virus and DI 
particles were predicted to expand in number  At intermediate concentrations both were 
inhibited  Finally at high DI particle concentrations DI particle growth was inhibited 
but virus was propagated 
A natural extension of ODE models is into the spatial dimension  Reaction 
diffusion models have been developed for example to examine the spatio-temporal 
patterns of viral infection 32  The model described VSV growth and spread in cells 
using parameters extracted from imaging studies 
4  Bioinformatics of vaccine design 
Traditionally theoretical modeling of the immune system has been based upon 
A subset of virus progeny are defective interfering DI particles  These particles 
The explosion of bioinformatics data coupled with a mechanistic understanding 
Viruses exist not just in an isolated individual but also in a population of 
In another study the effect of gene order on virus growth was predicted and used 
41  Modification of virus growth rates 
of viral growth dynamics and immune recognition allows for a novel approach to 
vaccine design  For example a model-based approach has been applied to the design of 
growth-attenuated viruses 33  These are viruses to be used as a vaccine that generate an 
immune response but which grow poorly or not at all in humans and do not cause 
infection  The traditional experimental approach for creating such vaccines has been to 
evolve them in foreign hosts until they replicate poorly and are no longer infectious  
Using molecular biology and bioinformatics and predicting how genetic changes 
correlate with virus growth it is possible to design a growth-attenuated virus strain for 
use as a vaccine  A model predicted how a virus-infected cell will produce viral progeny  
In particular the model captures the details of virus entry transcription of viral mRNA 
translation of viral protein replication of the viral genome assembly of intermediates 
and production and release of viral progeny 33  The predictions of this model were 
then used to suggest genetic modifications that would lead to a growth-attenuated strain 
to design a vaccine strain 34  Permutations of gene order for the vesicular stomatitis 
virus were examined for their effect on growth  Reordering of the genes that affect levels 
of gene transcripts by 6000 was found  These modifications of growth rates were 
largely due to imbalances in gene expression levels needed for optimal growth 
42  Epitope recognition 
Bioinformatics methods have also been used to identify and modulate immune 
recognition of viruses  The Los Alamos group has extensively examined the humoral 
immune response to HIV  In one study the B cell response to a DNA vaccine for HIV 
was examined 35  Nucleotide motifs that were common in HIV but under-represented 
in highly expressed human genes were identified  It was postulated that these motifs 
were leading to the poor expression of the HIV proteins gag pol and env from the 
vaccine  In addition an optimized consensus codon sequence was chosen for the gag 
gene  These bioinformatics-based optimizations gave a 5 increased antibody response 
to the gag protein from the vaccine 
5  Collective effects of vaccine design in a population 
individuals  Mathematical models can predict the sometimes non-intuitive effects of 
vaccine use in a population 36  A sufficiently powerful model would aid the effort to 
design a vaccine that is most effective in a population  One of the basic concepts in 
vaccine design is that of herd immunity  In the simplest model viruses infect people 
and propagate from infected people to other susceptible individuals  There is a 
percolation transition as a function of the transmission probability of the virus  That is 
no epidemic occurs below a critical transmission probability whereas an epidemic that 
infects a significant fraction of the population occurs above the critical transmission 
probability Under such a scenario the dynamical mean-field reaction rate equation is 
k is the probability of a vertex with degree  k being infected and 
probability that any given link points to the infected node At steady state one obtains 
  is the 
Furthermore we can obtain the epidemic threshold and the fraction of infective vertices 
assuming a distribution that has finite degree fluctuations 37 
When  falls below c there is no epidemic  Vaccines affect the transmission 
probability  because vaccinated individuals are much less likely to be infected by the 
virus  Thus even people who are not vaccinated can benefit from the vaccine if enough 
of the population is vaccinated and the vaccine is efficacious enough that   c they are 
completely protected  Decreasing the transmission rate below the critical value by means 
of vaccination so that no epidemic occurs is the essence of what is meant by herd 
immunity  Recent exact mathematical results provide sharper bounds on the 
applicability of this mean field analysis to infinite populations  119 
A number of non-trivial issues arise in vaccine design against viruses with natural 
diversity 36  For example different host species may be infected by different versions 
or serotypes or a virus  How should a vaccine composition be optimized if only some 
of the species will be vaccinated  The bacterial disease H influenza Hib contains a 
single serotype whereas there are numerous serotypes of pneumococcal bacteria  Thus 
the pneumococcal vaccine must be updated regularly where as the Hib need not be  A 
related question for pathogens with multiple serotypes is which serotypes to include in 
the vaccine  Mathematical models provide insight into this question  For example it 
might be advisable to include only the most pathogenic subtypes in the vaccine and leave 
out the avirulent serotypes  This approach similar to the sparing of pesticides in a 
limited fraction of cultivated land may allow the avirulent serotype to outcompete and 
suppress the more troublesome virulent serotypes 
6  Epidemiology 
Viruses exist in a population of individuals and survive by propagation between 
infected individuals  We can calculate an upper limit on the viral spreading rate 38  
Let us assume that a single virus particle in a single cell reproduces in one day to make 
100 viable progeny  The volume of a cell is 10-15 m3  If each of the progeny infects one 
other cell the volume of infected cells is 100n  10-15 m3 at the end of n days  This 
We know that typical viruses do not overtake the globe quite this rapidly 38  
Epidemiology is the study of virus spread in a population and modern models 
expansion process would be able to infect enough cells to populate the entire top km of 
the surface of the earth a volume of 51  1017 m3 in 17 days 
The reason is that the population infected by the virus is heterogeneous  Living matter is 
not well mixed  Microbes fish plants birds and mammals are distributed 
heterogeneously on the earth and virus progeny do not have unfettered access to all other 
susceptible cells on the earth  Virus transmission is highly restricted by the local contact 
processes between infected and susceptible individuals  In addition viruses are restricted 
by their biology to the hosts they can infect  That is a given virus usually can only infect 
a subset of cells in one or at most a few species   
take into account the heterogeneity of the transmission process and the selectivity of the 
virus  Mean field analysis of these models leads to classical results but it fails for 
spatially localized contact processes  Approaches such as moment closure methods have 
been developed to account for correlations in the dynamics 39  High dimensional 
detailed dynamics of an epidemic have been projected onto lower dimensions by 
projection operator methods 40  Some generic implications of spatial heterogeneity 
have been derived  For example spatial heterogeneity of a host population tends to lead 
to greater disease persistence 41  Important order parameters to characterize viral 
spreading include how well the immune system recognizes related strains of a virus 
transmissibility of the virus and population size 42  Three fixed points for viral 
dynamics have been described global extinction stable single-strain persistence and 
multiple-strain persistence with strain diversity  The transmission rate of the virus and 
strength of cross immunity between strains determine the boundary between single and 
multiple strain persistence  Among the order parameters population size and cross 
immunity most dramatically affect the dynamics  It was noted that The most crucial 
feature of multi-strain pathogeneiss is that infection by one strain induces partial 
immunity to future infections by other strains 42  We will return to this point in 
Section 71 
strain structure  There is a worldwide effort to sequence human influenza so a great deal 
is known about the distribution of the virus and its various strains  Human influenza A 
viruses tend to travel around the world with the international air travel of human hosts 
43  Frequent travelers accelerate the spread of epidemics 44 although seasonal 
epidemics are large enough and infect enough people that even the average travelers are 
enough to distribute the virus globally 
number of suggested mechanisms to explain this observation 45  It may be that 
increased crowding that occurs with indoors activities including school terms during the 
winter months leads to greater transmission  The immune system may also be 
fundamentally weaker in cold weather  For example the antibody response seems to 
depend on melatonin and be sensitive to vitamin D both of which are lower during 
Influenza predominates in the winter months of temperate climates  There are a 
Influenza provides an example of how the host affects viral transmission and 
winter  Epidemics are most synchronized ie more mean-field in the more populous 
states of the US and during the most severe disease season as one would expect from 
simple fluctuation versus number considerations  While children are still thought to be 
the dominant spreaders of disease at local levels of communities schools and 
households the long-distance spread of the virus is better correlated with patterns of adult 
workflow traffic  Interestingly epidemics in the tropics are correlated with rainy 
seasons  It is known as well that the virus is more stable at lower temperatures 
7  The immune response to influenza 
Influenza is a viral disease that infects 5  15 of the population and causes a 
worldwide mortality of 250000  500000 annually  Influenza virus is categorized as 
either A or B  Influenza A is further subtyped by the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase 
serotypes HxNy  The typical course of an influenza infection in an individual lasts 7 
days 46  The first 1  2 days after exposure the individual suffers no symptoms 
although the virus is rapidly expanding in number in the upper respiratory tract  During 
these days the individual is shedding virus and is infectious however  Day 2 is the day 
of maximum virus shedding which lasts roughly until day 7  The degree of 
infectiousness is roughly proportional to viral shedding  While fever is often considered 
a classic symptom of the flu only 40 of AH3N2 36 of AH1N1 and 75 of B 
cases cause fever  The H3N2 serotype is the most virulent and expands to higher viral 
concentrations or titer in individuals  H3N2 also typically causes more severe illness 
and higher mortality and a greater number of hospitalization cases than does H1N1  
Children shed influenza virus earlier and longer than do adults 
method for quantifying difference between strains of influenza virus is known as the 
hemagglutination inhibition assay which quantifies the ability of an antibody to 
competitively inhibit the binding of the hemagglutin protein of the virus to red blood 
cells  Antibodies raised against one strain of the virus typically inhibit other strains to 
lesser degree in a way that depends on the difference between the strains  The lesser the 
inhibition the greater the distance between the strains and this assay forms a basis to 
quantify antigenic distance 47  These assays are typically performed in ferrets 
however and the correlation of antigenic distances derived from this animal model with 
vaccine efficacy in humans is imperfect 
48  It appears that epidemics are often associated with rainy seasons in tropical regions  
Indeed there is a correlation with vapor pressure influenza transmission and virus 
survival  It has also been observed that transmission decreases with vapor pressure in a 
linear way and that virus survival increases with low levels of vapor pressure  Thus it 
has been suggested that humidification of air in homes schools and work could reduce 
virus transmission substantially  From Section 5 we know that epidemics are percolation 
phase transitions and so reduction of transmission probability below the critical value 
would extinguish an epidemic 
The annual influenza epidemics exhibit a strong seasonality in temperate regions 
There are multiple strains of each virus serotype  See Figure 5 The traditional 
There is an annual vaccine for influenza  There are three components to the 
Number of amino acids in the dominant epitope 
The immune response to an influenza vaccine and then subsequent response to a 
From sequence data it is now thought that global migration of influenza drives 
epidemics 49  That is the virus does not persist locally flaring up during the winter  
Rather the virus seems to arrive from elsewhere  It is now thought that Asia sometimes 
China and sometimes other places in Asia is the source for the annual epidemic strains 
50  For example it appears that Northern hemisphere strains are not descendant of 
South American or African strains but rather from Asian strains  This continual source 
of strains induces a one-dimensional character to the phylogenetic tree of influenza 
strains  Modeling efforts have suggested that once an influenza epidemic reaches 104  
105 cases travel restrictions are unable to contain further spread 51

vaccine currently specific strains of AH1N1 AH3N2 and influenza B  In 20092010 
there will also be a supplemental novel AH1N12009 strain 
virus that may be a bit different from the vaccine has been the subject of intense 
theoretical efforts 19 52 53  The immune system recognizes mainly the hemagglutinin 
protein on the surface of the influenza virus particle  On this protein there are five main 
regions called epitopes that antiobodies recognize  It has been postulated that a suitable 
order parameter to characterize antigenic distance for influenza is the fraction of amino 
acids that differ in the dominant epitope between two strains 19 53  This order 
parameter is called 
 pepitope          Number of amino acids that differ in the dominant epitope 
This order parameter correlates to a greater degree with vaccine efficacy in humans than 
do even the ferret animal model studies 19 52  This order parameter is a useful new 
tool for influenza vaccine design  See Figure 6 
Figure 6 Vaccine efficacy for influenza is well represented as a function of pepitope Also 
shown is a linear least square fit of the epidemiological data based on the pepitope  
parameter  Original antigenic sin or negative efficacy has been observed 26 of the 
time  From 19 
72  H1N1 influenza virus vaccine efficacy 
The other major serotype of influenza that has afflicted humans over the past few 
decades and the cause of some concern during the 20092010 season is H1N1  As with 
H3N2 it is desired to have a predictive correlate of vaccine efficacy for H1N1  To 
develop the pepitope method first the epitopes of H1N1 needed to be identified 54   
Roughly 13 of the positions were known from antibody mapping experiments  
These measures of antigenic distance are based upon a statistical physics 
An interesting distinction between H3N2 and H1N1 is that the immune response 
Remaining positions were identified by structural mapping from H3N2 and identification 
of sites under immune selection pressure  With these epitopes in hand pepitope for H1N1 
was developed 20  This order parameter correlated well with vaccine efficacy in 
humans just as it did for H3N2 
to H1N1 appears to be stronger 20  This for example explains why the H1N1 vaccines 
are typically more efficacious and why they extend protection to larger values of pepitope 
than do H3N2 vaccines  It also appears that due to this greater immune pressure H1N1 
viruses evolve to a greater extent when they are dominant than do H3N2 viruses 
73  Sequence space localization in the immune response to influenza 
description of the immune response to vaccine and subsequent exposure to virus 2  
This theory is termed the generalized NK GNK model  The GNK model is a spin glass 
random energy theory of the landscape upon which the immune system dynamics 
evolves  This theoretical description was the first to predict both a region of positive 
protection from the vaccine and a region of increased susceptibility due to a vaccine  
Essentially there is an intermediate antigenic distance for which the immune memory 
generated by the vaccine causes the immune response to be trapped in a local region of 
sequence space and this suboptimal response is worse than if the vaccine had not been 
given  For vaccine design a positive efficacy is desired  The GNK theory allows one to 
quantify the antigenic distance between the vaccine and mutant viral strains and to 
predict the expected vaccine efficacy as a function of this distance 
8  The immune response to dengue fever 
Originally a tropical and subtropical disease Dengue virus DENV is now being 
tracked and investigated in the United States as well as the rest of the world 55 56 The 
infected cases seem to grow with the range of the spread of DENV causing 
approximately 50 to 100 million cases on annual basis with a conservative estimate of 
25000 mortalities each year 57 Despite being immune to the same strain after 
surviving a bout of the disease individuals that are reinfected with a different serotype 
are at an elevated risk of suffering the dengue hemorrhagic fever DHF as a symptom 
DHF is characterized by plasma loss due to increased vascular permeability and is the 
cuase for essentially all the mortalities stemming from DENV 58 59 In order to avoid 
this original antigenic sin a DENV vaccine must be able to protect against all four 
serotypes simultaneously 60 To date however no four-component vaccine has been 
developed to combat all of the four serotypes 61 Development is impeded by the need 
to overcome or at least minimize immunodominance and bypass the potentially adverse 
effects caused by heterologous immunity  
There are four serotypes of dengue virus 62  The serotypes differ by up to 30 
in amino acid composition  The ten DENV protein products ordered by greatest to least 
variation are NS2A C NS1 NS2B E NS4A NS5 M NS3 and NS4B  See Figure 7  
Since DENV is comprised of four related serotypes an ideal vaccine would 
These four serotypes frequently co-circulate in the same locality  As with influenza it 
appears that Asia provides the source population for dengue and the greatest diversity of 
dengue is found in that region  In other words there is frequent dengue virus migration 
with relatively little in situ evolution 63 While the sequence data for dengue is not 
nearly as extensive as that for influenza it does appear that there is significant fluctuation 
in genetic diversity of the virus with rapid creation and extinction of many dengue 
clades 
81  Immunodominance in the immune response to dengue fever 
provide the basis for a simultaneous and balanced attack against all four viral variants 
Discovery of an effective vaccine against all four dengue viruses DENVs however has 
been hampered by skewing of immune responses to only one or two serotypes  A 
fundamental problem with DENV is that immunity after infection by one serotype of 
DENV protects modestly or even negatively against reinfection by other serotypes 56 
57 64  Presence of original antigenic sin requires having a vaccine for DENV that can 
induce protective immunity against all four serotypes simultaneously 56 57 65 To 
date not only has no such effective vaccine has been developed but also it is believed 
that the T cell immunological response to each serotype is to a limited number of 
epitopes that are similar but distinct in various serotypes 66 67 Differences in the 
epitope sequences in addition to simultaneous exposure to all four DENV serotypes can  
make the quality of the immune response to some of the serotypes poor 60 65 
Immunodominance is a severe immunological problem that DENV poses 
Figure 7 DENV genome expressed as proteins and the levels of antibody and T cell 
immune response to each blank meaning no response  indicating mild response and 
 indicating the strongest response  From 57 
immunodominance effect in which immune response is not strong against all serotypes 
Why immunodominance occurs so dramatically in DENV has been the subject of much 
debate Studies suggest that CD8
 T cell receptors TCRs which recognize dominant 
epitopes inhibit expansion of TCRs  to other epitopes due to reduction of viral load 
apoptosis homeostasis and resource competition 66 68 69 However the complexity 
of the interactions between the immune system and DENV had made a quantitative 
understanding of immunodominance challenging Moreover no four-component vaccine 
to date has been able to overcome this immunodominance 
82 Multi-site vaccination to alleviate imunodominance in dengue fever 
Based on our studies 23 we have suggested a novel multi-site vaccination that may 
ameliorate immunodominance for the DENV vaccine  See Figure 8  By multi-site 
vaccination we mean vaccinating in different locations in a manner that each component 
of the vaccine would drain to a physiologically distinct lymph node eg as used to be 
Clinical trials for a four-component DENV vaccine 57 60 show an 
Three experimental studies in animals have now confirmed our hypothesis that 
done with the rabies vaccine in the abdomen and buttocks  See Figure 9  Hence there 
would be independent evolutions of immune response in different individual lymph 
nodes of various vaccine components until complete mixing after which amplified T 
cells spread more evenly through the lymphatic system and a fraction are randomly 
chosen to be further expanded Such independent selection evolution allows for a 
successful multi-site vaccination by generating a predisposition in amplified T cells prior 
to mixing Since this predisposition can be preselected by vaccine components it can 
in turn be used towards sculpting the immune response to ameliorate immunodominance 
Administration of two different vaccines at physically separated sites rather than same 
site has been shown in cancer vaccines to reduce immunodominance 70-72 The model 
further suggests that vaccinating with a poorly recognized serotype first followed by 
multi-site vaccination is an effective strategy to sculpt an increased number of TCRs 
recognizing the subdominant serotypes to mitigate immunodominance Finally the model 
predicts that judicious choice of the subdominant epitopes may further ameliorate 
immunodominance

viruses under various situations  Data from 23

multi-site vaccination may alleviate immunodominance 73-75 These studies 
investigated the diversity of a CD8 T cell response to a mixture of HIV epitopes In 75 
mice were immunized with a mixture of AL11 and KV9 Db-restricted HIV epitopes 
Injection to the same site resulted in a specific response to the KV9 epitope Anatomic 
separation between injection sites resulted in a response against both epitopes  In 74 
whether a broad CD8 T cell response recognizing multiple HIV-1 types termed clades 
could be induced by a multi-component vaccine was assessed in mice Single-clade A B 
and C vaccines generated limited cross-clade reactivity Combining the three clades into 
one vaccine resulted in a reduced breadth of response due to immunodominance 
Administering individual clade-specific vaccines simultaneously into anatomically 
distinct sites on the body alleviated immunodominance and increased the number of 
epitopes recognized by the T cell response  In 73 a four-component dengue vaccine 
was examined in monkeys  A broader immune response was generated with multi-site 
vaccination than with single-site vaccination  A broader immune response was also 
generated when subdominant serotypes were administered in different physiological 
locations to the dominant serotypes These studies provide confirmation of our theory

In the late 60s and early 70s Crow Kimura and Eigen developed the 
There is an analogy between this evolutionary dynamics and thermodynamics 
viruses evolve in response to immune or vaccine pressure and influenza has become 
resistant to several common antivirals 
91  The quasispecies theory of virus evolution 
quasispecies theory to describe viral evolution  These physical theories of evolution 
consider the replication and mutation of a population of viruses  The key results that 
emerged were that a population of viruses clusters around a defined genotype which 
need not be the genotype with the most rapid replication rate and that there is a critical 
mutation rate beyond which the virus species no longer can exist  The disappearance of 
the virus for mutation rates greater than the critical value is called the error catastrophe 
Individual viral fitness is like energy mutation rate is like temperature and fitness of the 
viral population is like free energy  Quantum field theoretical treatments were able to 
make this analogy precise 76 For example if the viral replication rate f depends on 
distance from a wild-type sequence  the population of viruses in the Crow-Kimura 
model optimizes the expression 
where  is the viral mutation rate and fm is the mean viral fitness in the population The 
error catastrophe is a true phase transition with an order that depends on the form of the 
fitness function and the alphabet size of the virus 77  These methods provide the exact 
phase diagram and population fitness values of quasispecies theory derivable from this 
equation 
quantum field theory 78  This extension allows one to consider for example one 
region of sequence space with high viral fitness and a distinct region of immune or drug 
suppression  This refined model allows one to consider evolution of drug resistance or 
immune escape of the virus 
transfer 79 and recombination 80 to quasispecies theory  Horizontal gene transfer and 
recombination are essential for large-scale evolution and an accurate description of viral 
evolutionary dynamics must include these processes  It was found that these processes 
affect the phase diagram and population fitness of the virus  Perhaps most significantly 
however these processes affect the ability of a finite population of viruses to evolve 
the mutation rate of the virus could be driven beyond the critical value then the virus 
would be eradicated  Some current antivirals may indeed operate by this mechanism  It 
has been shown in the case of vesicular stomatitis virus that the virus can evolve to 
decrease its natural mutation rate thus counteracting this treatment strategy 81  This 
response to lethal mutagenesis is a novel viral resistance mechanism  Modulation of the 
The quasispecies theory in the literature suggests using mutagens as antivirals  If 
Extension of quasispecies theory to multiple fitness peaks was possible by this 
The quantum field theory also allowed the incorporation of horizontal gene 
mutation rate in response to a change in environmental pressure is well supported by 
generalized NK studies of evolution 13 
92  Co-evolution theory 
The combination of the immune system and the virus population is a co-evolving 
system  In the viral dynamics there is the error catastrophe phase transition as a function 
of viral mutation rate  In addition however there is an adaptation catastrophe for virus 
mutation rates too low to escape immune attack 82  Thus viruses can only exist within 
a window of mutation rates  It might be expected that the immune system would try to 
make this window of viability as small as possible by varying the B cell mutation rate 
and antibody receptor length  Optimizing these parameters in a physical model leads to 
values close to the biological ones 82 
93  The emergence of new strains of a pathogen 
that each individual virus would maximize its reproductive rate R0  This analysis 
however is approximate because it ignores correlations in the virus population  If there 
are multiple strains and co-infection of different virus strains in individual hosts the 
strains that persist in a population may not be the ones that maximize R0 83  That is 
the virus population will maximize total strain persistence rather than the replication rate 
of any individual virus  This result was evident in quasispecies theory where it is not the 
bare viral replication rate f that is optimized but rather the renormalized population-
level viral fitness fm 
10  Evolution of the influenza virus 
in the population of individuals and the immune pressure on the virus arises from those 
individuals who have memory antibodies against the virus due to previous infection or 
those individuals who have been vaccinated  The antigenic variation of the virus disrupts 
the antigen-specific immune response 36  This variation arises from point mutation of 
the RNA that encodes the proteins of the virus that the immune system recognizes as well 
as recombination and reassortment of the genes of the virus between different strains 
101  Pressure on the virus to evolve 
pressure from the immune system  As discussed in Sections 71 and 72 the immune 
pressure from the antibody immune system can be quantified by the pepitope distance 
between the virus and any strains to which an individual has been previously exposed or 
immunized  This immune pressure extends to pepitope  019 for H3N2 or pepitope  045 
for H1N1 
The influenza virus evolves to evade the immune response  This evolution occurs 
Considering a population of viruses at the mean field level leads one to suspect 
The virus experiences different pressures that can lead to evolution  First is 
There are also pressures on the virus related to its ability to infect and transmit 
Finally there are pressures on the influenza virus to survive antiviral treatment  
between individuals  For example typical avian influenzas infect water fowl in the lower 
respiratory tract whereas typical human influenzas infect people in the upper respiratory 
tract  Thus the influenza virus must alter its binding specificity from what is known as 
an  23- to an  26-linkage to sialic acid when making the transition from birds to 
humans 84 The ability of the virus to persist in a population also depends on its 
transmission rate between individuals and so there is pressure on the virus to achieve a 
viable transmission rate 
There are a number of antivirals against influenza including neuraminidase inhibitors 
and adamantines  Adamantine resistance has evolved rather completely in current 
influenza strains 85  A single Ser31Asn replacement in the M2 protein is thought to be 
sufficient to cause resistance  This evolution of the M2 protein has perhaps occurred 
only once with that strain then spreading throughout the population as all adamantine 
resistant viruses have a shared 17 amino acid replacement signature  The emergence of 
adamantine resistant viruses also provides further support for the source-sink model with 
Asia as the source because there is limited adamantine use in the US and Australia but a 
majority of the strains in the US and Australia are resistant 86 
Neuraminidase inhibitors are  97 efficacious when given 29h after exposure to a 
susceptible strain 87  These antivirals inhibit the release of newly formed virus 
particles from infected cells and the virus is cleared before a systemic infection is 
established when the inhibitor is given sufficiently early  There are two known mutations 
that lead to neuraminidase inhibitor resistance His274Tyr and Asn294Ser 88 
Of note is that while specific amino acid mutations or pairs of mutations are often 
mentioned as necessary and sufficient for resistance or transmission modification other 
mechanisms to achieve these changes are likely possible  For example more than simply 
 23- to  26-linkage changes are known to be responsible for human infection 84  In 
fact the novel AH1N12009 strain which seems to be highly infectious and 
transmissible between humans is still an  23-linkage binder as of this writing 
102  The emergence of new influenza strains 
animals will appear in humans  Two recent examples are the H5N1 bird flu and the 
H1N1 swine flu  The jumping of a pathogen to a human host is called zoonosis  
There are three stages 89  The first stage is infection of humans but no human-to-
human transmission  The H5N1 is currently in this stage  The second stage is localized 
transmission of the new strain among humans  The third stage is sustained transmission 
among humans which causes an epidemic  The novel AH1N12009 is in this stage   
overcome the human immune system  Additionally however the virus may also need to 
Resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors is incomplete at present  
Occasionally a strain of influenza that had previously only infected birds or 
There are several barriers to achieving the third stage 90  The virus must 
Point mutation is a fine tuning of the virus once it lands in a new host  To evade 
undergo substantial evolution to achieve sustained transmission between humans  It has 
been said that in the context of emergence of an influenza A virus strain via a host 
switch event it is difficult to predict what specific polygenic changes are needed for 
mammalian adaptation 91  In other words zoonosis is not a predictable event with 
current theory  In the context of AH5N1 there has been quite a bit of thought as to what 
would lead this virus to develop sustained human-to-human transmission 92  For 
example AH5N1 may acquire from reassortment events with AH1N1 or AH3N2  
Indeed a significant fraction up to 25 of patents infected with one strain of influenza 
are simultaneously infected with another strain thus allowing for potential reassortment 
events 92  It is also of note that consensus sequencing eg as carried out by Roche454 
machines cannot generally measure evolution within individual hosts  For this reason 
published consensus sequences are skewed toward dominant strains within isolates 92 
103  Point mutation 
the immune system for example the hemagglutinin protein must make a sufficiently 
large modification of pepitope so that immune system memory from prior infection or 
vaccination does not eliminate the virus  Taking the novel AH1N12009 as an example 
the distances between this virus and the AH1N1 virus from the 2008-2009 season the 
1976 swine flu strain and the 1918 Spanish flu strain are pepitope  091 028 and 038 
respectively  Point mutations contributing to other components of the virus fitness such 
as transmission are less well understood at present  For example molecular markers 
predictive of adaptation in humans are not currently present in 2009 AH1N1 viruses 
suggesting that previously unrecognized molecular determinants could be responsible for 
the transmission among humans 93 
104  Reassortment recombination and HGT 
Segmental reassortment of the 8 coding segments of influenza is a significant 
contributor to the evolution of novel strains of H1N1  For example each of the novel 
H1N1 strains in 1918 1947 and 1951 came about by reassortment 94 as did the strain 
in 2009  Multiple lineages of H3N2 co-circulate persist and reassort 95   
One study found 14 HA or NA reassortments over 7 years 45  Consistent with this 
study it has been estimated that there may be at least 2-3 reassortment events among 
influenza A strains each year 96  The most common reassortment is incorporation of a 
novel hemagglutinin or neuraminidase segment to the virus  These are also the proteins 
undergoing the most rapid point mutation evolution It appears that the reassortment 
evolvability of these two proteins has been selected for due to a sufficiently great immune 
pressure  Reassortment of these segments also occurs at an elevated rate in vitro in the 
absence of immune selection suggesting that the reassortment of these segments may be 
elevated due to packaging effects 
105  Novel strain detection 
The sequence data of influenza are consistent with large selection pressure 97  
While there are long periods of stasis of the dominant strain this suppression of 
fluctuations is to be expected in a finite population  Even strong selection pressure eg 
from the immune system could lead to a relatively homogeneous virus population during 
one season but rather different populations in different seasons  The existence of this 
selection pressure suppressed as it is by finite population effects has not been widely 
recognized 98 
Thus identification of new strains before they become dominant is a significant 
and non-trivial task  The annual influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere is chosen 
in February for the vaccine that will be administered in October  So novel strains must 
be identified at least 9 months in advance of when they will be dominant if a vaccine 
against them is to be identified  As discussed in Section 7 strain classification has been 
based upon the ferret hemagglutination inhibition assay  However as discussed in 
Section 72 the correlation between the ferret immune and human immune responses is 
imperfect  By projecting the strains in the multidimensional sequence space to a two-
dimensional sequence space clusters containing incipient new strains can be identified 
months to years in advance 99  It appears that novel strains can be identified with 
clusters containing as few as ten strains 
106  Detailed simulation of antibody binding 
evolve  The pressure is due to antibodies produced in the immune system that chemically 
bind to the hemagglutinin protein on the virus surface People who have been vaccinated 
have antibodies that bind the virus protein 102-103 times as strongly  Since there is 
pressure on the virus to mutate when the virus does mutate this may be to the advantage 
of the virus  In particular some mutations may disrupt the antibodyhemagglutinin 
binding more than others  We postulated that the free energy of the binding is directly 
correlated to the fitness of the virus 54  That is we propose that the decrease in the 
binding constant between antibodies and the mutated hemagglutinin is one of the most 
significant driving forces of virus evolution 
We have used molecular dynamics MD simulation with the CHARMM22 force 
field to calculate the Gibbs free energy G from which the change of binding constant 
Immune memory from virus in previous years imposes a pressure on the virus to 

aK  and 
aK  are the binding constant of the mutated complex and the 
is obtained where 
wild type complex respectively  Thermodynamic integration with an Einstein crystal 
reference system for the endpoints was used to calculate this free energy difference 
We performed calculations on the 1968 H3N2 Aichi strain 100 We noticed that 
the 10 observed mutations had different levels of stability and some mutations persisted  
while others reverted to the original residue one or two years after the first mutation  We 
found that the mutations which persisted in the human populations were those that most 
disrupted G among the 10 observed  We also calculated the free energy change for a 
Agent based modeling provides a full solution to the stochastic process of virus 
double mutation found in a Guinea pig animal model experiment performed by our 
collaborators  This mutation significantly disrupted G 
107  Projected dynamics 
Coupling the virus evolution within individuals to the transmission of the virus in 
a population leads to a large system of stochastic dynamics  Analytic progress is possible 
when this dynamics is projected to a lower dimension  For example stage-structured 
modeling reduces the number of variables 101  This approach is a projection of an 
agent-based approach to be discussed next 
108  Agent based modeling 
evolution in a population  Fluctuation effects are particularly significant to capture 
effects of strain emergence and extinction 1  Deterministic modeling in particular 
often leads to an excessive number of strains with a paucity of extinction 102 
A full agent based model captures the immune pressures on the virus in an 
individual due to prior exposure or immunization via pepitope distances 103  Each 
individual acquires an immune history specific to its exposure history  Viruses mutate 
and evolve in individuals and transmit to other individuals  So the variables are the 
current infection status and immune history of each individual  Transmission between 
individuals occurs via social contact and so the contact network within and between 
cities is a key parameter in the formulation of the dynamics

prime interest and is calculated   See Figure 10  The greater the fraction of the 
population vaccinated and the earlier the vaccine is administered the lower the attack 
rate  In this way herd immunity is quantified  In some cases a multi-strain vaccine is 
warranted  For example in the 20092010 season both a seasonal and a novel H1N1 
vaccine will be available  This detailed agent based approach is the first to quantify the 
efficacy of a multiple strain vaccine  The interactions among vaccine components can be 
non-trivial  The reports in 2009 of potential negative interactions between the seasonal 
and the novel H1N1 components of the vaccine which concerned three provinces in 
Canada enough to delay administration of the seasonal vaccine until the novel vaccine 
was ready are an example the decision was based on preliminary results  not yet 
published or reviewed  from four Canadian studies involving 2000 people according to 
Dr Don Low at Mount Sinai Hospital 104   To further quantify the potential impact of 
an epidemic the quantity Population at Risk PaR was introduced  The PaR is the 
maximum expected attack rate calculated to a 90 95 or 99 confidence interval 
11  Evolution of other viruses 
pathogens  These patterns are  105 
There are several patterns into which antigenic variability falls for general 
1  limited variation within host population wide variation that is independent of 
2  limited variation within host population wide variation that depends on space and 
space and time eg S pneumoniae 
time eg N meningitides 
3  limited variation within host limited population variation at one time but rapid 
population variation over the time scale of years eg Influenza 
4  significant variation in host over time extensive and increasing diversity in the 
global population HIV-1 
5  limited or no antigenic variability limited diversity in the population and so 
nearly complete vaccine or naturally acquired immunity measles mumps 
rubella 
Antigenic diversity is a major challenge to vaccine design as we saw in Section 7 
A strong immune cross reactivity between strains leads to large distances between 
evolving strains  Conversely higher transmission weaker cross immunity and short-
lived infections promote a rapid strain turnover The prevalence of a pathogen prevale is 
increased for higher transmissibility for infections with longer duration or for less 
immune cross-immunity  Thus pathogenic diversity is greater for weaker cross 
immunity and for more transmissible pathogens  A failing of simple epidemic models is 
that too much diversity is generated too rapidly 
for the specific case of influenza  For viruses such as HIV or hepatitis C one wonders 
whether a vaccine can be protective in a diverse population of hosts 105  For influenza 
one wonders whether a universal vaccine one not requiring annual updates is possible 
Modeling has shed light on a few features of viral emergence 84  For example 
due to their higher mutation rates new RNA viruses are more likely to emerge than DNA 
viruses  In addition zoonosis is more likely from generalist than specialist viruses  
Epistatic effects stemming from the necessity to replicate in different hosts however 
disallows much amino acid variation and reduces the speed with which zoonosis occurs  
While phylogenetically related species are more likely to have cross species transmission 
similar immune systems in related species may suppress virus transmission in new 
species detailed modeling could provide insight into this phenomenon 
111  Evolution of the HIV virus evolution 
HAART therapy for HIV has significantly increased the life expectancy of 
infected patients  The effects on HIV evolution however are less clear 106  For 
example while HAART increases life expectancy it also increases viral transmission  
On the other hand decreased infectiousness decreases the transmission  Thus 
mathematical models can determine 
1  Optimal use of HAART 
2  Epidemiological consequences of HAART and behavioral changes 
3  The course of evolution of drug resistance within an individual and within a 
population 
4  Achievable levels of coverage and effectiveness including effective and efficient 
use of second line treatments and demographic or health care impacts 
A number of features of HIV evolution have been determined  For example there 
is a significant bottleneck as the virus transmits from one person to another  The HIV 
diversity goes down 99 during transmission to new host 107  The evolution of HIV 
slows down as CD4 T cells decline presumably because the immune pressure is reduced 
108 
A quasispecies model for HIV evolution demonstrated the emergence of mutants 
109  The time scale for a substantial diversity to evolve was 1-2 years  As the mutants 
emerge the diversity taxes the capacity of the immune system to respond due to 
immunodominance  This mechanism was the first to explain in a single model the three 
phases of HIV  See Figure 11  Moreover this mechanism suggests a forward-looking 
vaccine strategy  If a subset of the mutants that are likely to evolve in 1-2 years are 
vaccinated against during week 14 using the multi-site protocol of Section 82 then 
immunodominance is alleviated and the immune system is predicted to eradicate the 
Figure 11 HIV-1 infection time course where circles represent the clinical data and the 
solid line is generated by the model  From 109 
population sizes recombination increased diversity and mean fitness  At larger 
population sizes recombination increased fitness but decreased diversity  For small 
population sizes we generally expect that recombination may increase fitness due to a 
reduction of Mullers ratchet effect 111  For larger population sizes recombination 
may increase or decrease fitness depending on the sign of epistasis 79 112 
112  Evolution of the hepatitis C virus 
transplantation 113  Under conditions of mild fibrosis genetic distance and non-
synonymous mutations in the viral quasispecies increased  Under conditions of severe 
fibrosis the opposite happened  The interpretation is that under mild disease there is less 
pressure on the virus and a more complex quasispecies can emerge  Conversely under 
severe disease there is substantial pressure on the virus and a more localized and less 
complex quasispecies emerge 
113  Evolution of the dengue virus 
The effects of recombination on HIV have been investigated 110  At moderate 
The evolution of hepatitis C has been quantified after orthotopic liver 
Dengue virus has only recently entered the human population and the virus 
The immune system controls pre-cancerous cells on a daily basis  Theoretical 
continues to evolve in the human host  Homologous recombination has been observed in 
the flaviviridae family to which dengue belongs 114  Recombination within each of the 
dengue strains has been observed 95  Conclusive proof of recombination between 
strains has now been obtained from a patient infected with DEN-1 and DEN-2 and with 
DEN-12 recombinants 115  These results illustrate the general importance of 
recombination to viral evolution 
12  Cancer 
discussion of cancer and the immune system focuses on cancers of the immune system 
immune control of cancer and potential vaccination strategies 
121  The mutations leading to cancer 
As an example of detailed modeling a simulation study of human follicular 
lymphoma B cells has been carried out 116  A model of the germinal center was 
constructed A significant number of detailed parameters were identified  The focus of 
the study was to identify mutations leading to cancerous cells 
122  Immunodominance 
The resistance of cancer to standard therapies has led many researchers to consider 
immune control Various effects including tolerance and immunodominance however 
have limited the ability of the immune system and vaccines to control cancer These 
effects occur because cancer is effectively a multi-strain disease with multiple cancer-
associated or cancer-specific epitopes 
Immunodominance is one general mechanism by which cancer cells may escape either 
by mutation of the dominant epitope or by loss of the MHC class I allele that expresses 
the dominant epitope Cross-presentation of the lost dominant epitope on surrounding 
cells often sustains the futile immune response Indeed many types of cancerous cells are 
exceptionally adept at evading immune control   
123  Multi-site vaccination 
vaccine is to administer the different components of the vaccine strains to different 
physical regions of the patient in this way breaking the hierarchy of immunodominance 
117  These experiments are well explained by the GNK theory of T cell response to 
multiple antigens 21118  See Figure 12  Since cancerous cells often express multiple 
similar epitopes this theory could explain a significant fraction of the immunobiological 
responses to cancer 
One means to generate a broader T cell response to a multicomponent cancer

cancer epitopes a single site injection b dual site injection with each epitope in the
