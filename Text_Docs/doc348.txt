Abstract We investigate the origin of the colour-magnitude relation CMR observed in cluster
galaxies by using a combination of a cosmological N-body simulation of a cluster of galaxies and
a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation The departure of galaxies in the bright end of the
CMR with respect to the trend denoted by less luminous galaxies could be explained by the
inuence of minor mergers
Keywords galaxies mergers evolution
With the aim of understanding the development of the CMR depicted by early-type
galaxies in galaxy clusters we apply a semi-analtytic model of galaxy formation Lagos et
al 2008 to a simulated galaxy cluster with virial mass  13  1015 h1 M Dolag et al
2005 The semi-analtytic model considers gas cooling star formation galaxy mergers
disc instabilities metal enrichment and feedback from supernovae and active galactic
nuclei Photometric properties of simulated early-type galaxies are compared with those
of early-type galaxies observed in the central region of the Antlia cluster Smith Castelli
et al 2008 all magnitudes are obtained in the Washington photometric system C
T1 We nd that the general trend of simulated and observed CMR are quite similar
However the more massive simulated galaxies 22  MT1  19 depart from the t to
observed data displaying an almost constant colour C  T1  17 as detected in other
clusters We select galaxies in six magnitude bins within the range 22  MT1  16
and analyse the contribution to the stellar component of quiescent star formation and
starbursts during disk instabilities and mergers events Major and minor mergers are
distinguished between dry and wet ones according to the cold gas mass of the remnant
For the most luminous galaxies we nd that the increase of stellar mass at low redshift
arises as a consequence of minor dry merger events in agreement with Skelton et al
2009 Galaxies lying in the faint end of the CMR 17  MT1  16 mainly increase
their stellar mass as a result of disk instabilities This seems to indicate that the eect of
minor dry mergers would yield to an increase of the luminosity without strongly aecting
the galaxy colours We will deepen this investigation focusing on the chemical enrichment
history of the accreted stellar mass with the aim of disentangling the role played by dry
mergers in determining the properties of the more massive galaxies
