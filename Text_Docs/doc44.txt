Abstract There are numerous derivations of the Hawking eect available in the liter-
ature They emphasise dierent features of the process and sometimes make markedly
dierent physical assumptions This article presents a minimalist argument and
strips the derivation of as much excess baggage as possible All that is really necessary
is quantum physics plus a slowly evolving future apparent horizon not an event hori-
zon In particular neither the Einstein equations nor Bekenstein entropy are necessary
nor even useful in deriving Hawking radiation

1 Introduction
Hawking radiation from black holes is a semiclassical quantum eect that has now
been with us for some 27 years 1 and whose theoretical importance is dicult to
exaggerate Over the decades the Hawking eect has accreted a quite considerable
mythology Perhaps the two most pernicious myths attached to this eect are
 Hawking radiation has something to do with gravity and
 Hawking radiation automatically implies Bekenstein entropy
These myths were engendered by two historical accidents 1 the Hawking eect was
rst encountered within the context of general relativity and 2 the fact that it was
discovered shortly after the notion of Bekenstein entropy geometric entropy had been
formulated 2 3
Though the Hawking eect was at rst partly motivated by the need for a consis-
tent thermodynamic interpretation for the notion of Bekenstein entropy it was rapidly
appreciated that the Hawking eect is much more primitive and fundamental 4 
in particular the Hawking eect continues to make sense even in situations where ge-
ometric entropy and even gravity itself are simply not relevant 5 This observation
underlies much of the current interest in analog models offor general relativity 6 7
there is now a realistic possibility for experimental detection of the Hawking eect in
condensed-matter analog systems using current or planned technology 8 9 10 with
eective metrics and black holes that have nothing to do with gravity itself 11
In view of this situation in this current article I will attempt to isolate an irreducible
minimum of physical assumptions needed for the Hawking eect to arise
Since the literature is vast I will not be able to do justice to all known deriva-
tions of the eect  some key derivations are those due to Hawking himself 1 the
HartleHawking approach using analytic continuation of the propagator across the
event horizon of an eternal black hole 12 and the GibbonsHawking approach using
Euclideanization Wick rotation 13 Extremely useful general surveys are provided
in 14 and 15
A particularly relevant discussion is the early work of Damour and Runi 16 who
emphasise the behaviour of the outgoing modes as one crosses the horizon Though
their presentation is given in terms of the KerrNewman geometry it is easy to verify
that the specics of the geometry enter only in the evaluation of the surface gravity
of the future Killing horizon and that the route from surface gravity to Hawking
radiation does not depend on either the Einstein equations or even the underlying
physical mechanism leading to the existence of the metric
In a slightly dierent vein the discussion of Parker 17 particularly emphasises
the relationship with particle production from a dynamical vacuum state while Ger-
lach 18 Grove 19 Hu 20 and Brout and Parentani 14 emphasise in varying
degree the near-universal role of the exponential stretching associated with many types
of horizon
More recently the contributions of Massar and Parentani 21 Parikh and Wilczek 22
Padmanabhan et al 23 and Schutzhold 24 should be noted They emphasise in
slightly dierent forms the analyticity properties of the modes and what is eectively
an imaginary contribution to the action localized at the horizon an observation that
can be traced back to the work of Damour and Runi 16
It is also important to realise that the Hawking radiation eect is independent
of whatever cuto you introduce to the high-frequency physics  this is one of the
theoretical reasons for interest in analog models because for acoustic black holes you
have an explicit model for the high frequency cuto in terms of atomic physics 25 26
27 I will not have anything specic to say about this particular issue in the present
Based on the results extracted from 27 years of research as veried and made more
explicit by the recent interest in analog models it is clear that the basic physics we
should be aiming for is
 Hawking radiation is kinematics
 Bekenstein entropy is geometrodynamics
That is Hawking radiation is a purely kinematic eect that depends only on the exis-
tence of a Lorentzian metric with no particular prejudice as to how this metric arises
and some sort of horizon Hawking radiation does not depend on the validity of the
Einstein equations as may most quickly be veried by looking at Hawkings original
derivation 1 and verifying that the Einstein equations are nowhere used nor needed
In contrast Bekensteins geometric entropy associated with the area of the event hori-
zon is an intrinsically geometrodynamic eect wrapped up with the validity of the
Einstein equations Entropy equals one quarter the area plus perturbative correc-
tions if and only if the Einstein equations are valid plus perturbative corrections 5
The connection with the Einstein equations arises because when integrating the rst
law to evaluate the Bekenstein entropy you need to use the relationship between total
mass of the black hole and its surface gravity and hence Hawking temperature and
it is in this relationship between surface gravity and mass-energy that the Einstein
equations enter
I shall also distinguish the notion of apparent horizon from that of the event
horizon absolute horizon and demonstrate that the existence of a locally denable
apparent horizon is quite sucient for obtaining the Hawking eect Remember that
to dene the event horizon you need to know the entire history of the spacetime out
to the innite future you should be a little alarmed if the question of whether or not
a black hole is radiating now depends on what it is doing in the innite future
The general theme of the analysis will be to do as much as possible with the
eikonal approximation even WKB is mild overkill and look for generic features in
the modes atnear the apparent horizon Specically we will look for a Boltzmann
factor Note that a good derivation should not depend on either grey-body factors or a
past horizon Grey-body factors are not fundamental  they are simply transmission
coecients giving the probability that modes which escape from the horizon make it
out to null innity Past horizons are specic to eternal black holes and simply not
relevant for astrophysical black holes Similarly because the entropy-area law is tied to
the validity of the Einstein equations we shall seek to avoid any appeal to this property
Since much of what I have to say is well-known to experts in the eld at least within
the general relativity community I will place a premium on clarity and simplicity
2 Metric PainleveGullstrand form
In general relativity any spherically symmetric geometry static or not can by suitable
choice of coordinates locally be put in the form
ds2  cr t2 dt2  dr  vr t dt2  r2d2  sin2  d2
Equivalently
ds2  cr t2  vr t2 dt2  2vr t dr dt  dr2  r2d2  sin2  d2
These are so-called PainleveGullstrand coordinates a relatively obscure coordinate
system currently enjoying a resurgence See 28 for a geometric discussion A nice
feature of these coordinates is that the metric is nonsingular at the horizon Though
the basic physics is coordinate independent we shall see that these coordinates simplify
computations considerably
In the acoustic geometries associated with sound propagation in a owing uid it
is often convenient to not set up coordinates this precise manner but rather to use
the natural coordinates inherited from the background Minkowski spacetime Doing so
results in a minor modication of the PainleveGullstrand metric
ds2  r t
cr tncr t2 dt2  dr  vr t dt2  r2d2  sin2  d2o 
where cr t is now the speed of sound vr t is the radial velocity of the uid and
r t is its density Phonons are then massless minimally coupled scalar elds in this
acoustic geometry 6 7 Fortunately the conformal factor does not aect the surface
gravity and does not aect the Hawking eect 29 for simplicity I shall simply suppress
the conformal factor it can easily be reinstated if desired
In matrix form the PainleveGullstrand metric takes the quasiADM form
The inverse metric is
c2  v2
        
v ri
 v rj
    

gt x  


gt x 

    
v ri
v rj
        
c2 ij  v2 ri rj
Because of spherical symmetry nding the apparent horizon is particularly easy
is located at cr t  vr t
It is easy to see that the metric is nonsingular at
the apparent horizon with detg  cr t2 To get a future apparent horizon
corresponding to an astrophysical black hole we need v  0 I make no claims as to
the location or even existence of any event horizon
Since for static black holes the event horizon is coincident with the apparent hori-
zon the general feeling is that for quasi-stationary black holes the event horizon is
likely to be near the apparent horizon If accretion dominates over evaporation the
event horizon is likely to be just outside the apparent horizon while if evaporation
dominates over accretion it is likely to be just inside the apparent horizon There is an
unpopular minority opinion that takes the view that because of Hawking evaporation
a black hole will never form a true event horizon absolute horizon For the derivation
presented herein this entire issue is simply not relevant

If the geometry is static this reduces to the ordinary denition of surface gravity 7
If the geometry is not static this is a natural denition of the surface gravity of the
apparent horizon
3 Eikonal and WKB approximation s wave
Consider a quantum eld r t on this PainleveGullstrand background and take the
eikonal geometric opticsacoustics approximation for the s wave
r t  Ar t expir t  Ar t expcid20icid18 t Z r
kr drcid19cid21
whereby the eld is written as a rapidly varying phase times a slowly varying envelope
The second equality above where we have written the time dependence of the phase
as t is valid provided the geometry is slowly evolving on the timescale of the wave
that is provided   max cc vv I take  to be positive
In the eikonal approximation the dAlembertian equation of motion becomes
g    i  0
Note in particular that I have used the eikonal approximation to immediately impose
Feynmans i-prescription on the eld  is real positive and innitesimal The met-
ric signature is the general relativity standard   which is why the i-prescription
appears reversed relative to the particle physics standard Also note that in invoking
the prescription I have implicitly used the fact that the spacetime geometry is smooth
even at the horizon so that it makes sense to both adopt an eikonal approximation
and then within this framework use ordinary at-space results The use of the i pre-
scription in this way can be traced back at least to the early paper of Damour and
Runi 16 If one prefers the i-prescription can be rephrased in terms of analyticity
of the elds on the complexied past light cone Zx  z  x  iy where x is
any point in spacetime and y lies in the past light cone This is the Lorentz-invariant
generalization of analyticity in the lower half-plane but for all practical purposes can
be replaced by the i prescription
From the preceding equation
2  2vr t k  cr t2  vr t2k2  i  0
  vk2  c2k2  i
So that
For specic real frequency  this gives us the wave-vector kr t as
  vk   1  i ck

outgoing mode
ingoing mode
Keeping track of the i is important only near the apparent horizon where it is critical
everywhere else it can safely be set to zero
While we do not really need to use the WKB approximation physical acous-
ticsoptics it can be invoked at very little additional cost The approximate con-
served current is
J  Ar t2  k 0 0
 J   0
Ar t 
So we can write
r t  N2 r
expcid20icid18 t Z r
kr drcid19cid21 
where N is some conveniently chosen normalization to be discussed more fully below
4 Near-horizon modes ingoing
The ingoing wavenumber   1 is
kin  
1  i c  v
Thus in the vicinity of the future apparent r  rH with v  c the ingoing wavevector
is approximately
kin  
Thus the ingoing modes are approximately
r tin  Nin2 rH
expcid20icid26t 
r  rH
2cH cid27cid21 
This means the phase velocity of the ingoing mode as it crosses the horizon in co-
ordinate distance per coordinate time is 2cH Phase velocity equals group velocity
because there is no dispersion We see that the ingoing modes contain no real surprises
and are relatively uninteresting
5 Near-horizon modes outgoing
Now consider the outgoing mode   1
1  i c  v
In the vicinity of the future apparent r  rH with v  c the outgoing wavevector
is approximately
kout 
gHcHr  rH  i cH
But because  is innitesimal and both gH and cH are by hypothesis positive we
can for all practical purposes rewrite this in terms of the principal part and a delta
function contribution That is near the apparent horizon
kout 
gH cid26cid18
r  rHcid19  i r  rHcid27 
Thus we can ignore the i unless we are actually intending to cross the apparent horizon
In particular just outside the apparent horizon
k  Z r
Therefore for r  rH
r tout  Nout
dr 
dr cH 
gHr  rH

gH i lnr  rHcid17
expcid16ih cH
2 rH
r  rHicH gH
 Nout
2 rH
exp it 
lnr  rH
exp it
The phase velocity of the outgoing mode as it crosses the horizon in coordinate distance
per coordinate time is zero
The fact that these outgoing modes have the surface gravity   gHcH show up
in such a fundamental and characteristic way is already strongly suggestive and this is
really all there is to Hawking radiation The logarithmic phase pile-up at the horizon
is characteristic of many derivations of Hawking radiation in particular 1 and for
many readers this will be sucient to convince them that Hawking radiation is present
under the current circumstances slowly evolving apparent horizon without prejudice
as to where the metric comes from In fact this calculation is the easiest and fastest
way I know of to deduce the existence of the phase pileup using completely elementary
methods
To properly describe the modes that escape to innity we should normalize on the
half-line r  rH using the standard Klein-Gordon norm This results in replacing Nout
with some specic normalization constant Nescape whose precise value we do not need
to know
6 Straddling the horizon the Boltzmann factor
In addition to looking at outgoing modes that escape to innity it is also useful to
consider what happens to outgoing modes that straddle the apparent horizon Inside
the apparent horizon the real part of kout goes negative indicating that while the
outgoing mode is trying to escape upstream it is actually being overcome by the
owshift vector and swept back downstream Additionally the phase picks up an
imaginary contribution due ultimately to the i prescription
kout  Z r
dr cH 
gH cid26cid18
gH ln r  rH
r  rH  i 
r  rHcid19  i r  rHcid27
So just inside the apparent horizon
r tstraddlerrH   Nstraddle r  rHicH gH
2 rH
  cH
gH  exp it 
Compare with the situation just outside the apparent horizon
r tstraddlerrH   Nstraddle r  rHicH gH
2 rH
exp it 
Note that this straddling mode has associated with it a normalization factor Nstraddle
which is distinct from that of the escaping mode Nescape the straddling mode is to be
normalized on the entire half-line r  0 In terms of the Heaviside step function
r tstraddle  Nstraddle rH  r exp
exp it 
r  rHicH gH
2 rH
  cH
gH   r  rH
See Damour and Runi 16 equation 5b for an early occurrence of a very similar
statement see also Massar and Parentani 21 equation 13 Note note in particular
the presence of a Boltzmann-like factor
which we shall soon see corresponds to the Hawking temperature
For many physicists the presence of this Boltzmann-like factor will be enough The
occurrence of Boltzmann factors of this type was the key to the HartleHawking deriva-
tion 12 though they were working with the full propagator and dealing with past and
future horizons of a maximally extended KruskalSzekeres eternal black hole Damour
and Runi 16 demonstrated the existence of similar Boltzmann factors for mode func-
tions evaluated at the future Killing horizon of a KerrNewman black hole dispensing
with the past horizon entirely In the present situation the same Boltzmann factor is
seen to arise for any slowly evolving apparent horizon
The imaginary contribution to the integrated wavenumber is in slightly disguised
form equivalent to the imaginary contribution to the action that occurs in the Parikh
Wilczek approach 221 and is also related but not identical to the imaginary contri-
bution arising from complex paths in the approach of Padmanabhan et al 23
1Note that Parikh and Wilczek have subsequently and implicitly made use of the Einstein equations
at the stage when they then relate the emission process to the entropy change This comment also
applies to the MassarParentani approach
But it is possible to quite easily do a lot more While I have so far carefully not
specied specic values for Nescape and Nstraddle the relationship between them is very
simple Since the straddling mode is to be normalized on 0  which we actually
approximate by the full line   while the escaping mode is only normalized
on the half line rH we have
Nstraddle2exp
2  cH
gH   1  Nescape2
So the relative normalization is
cid12cid12cid12cid12cid12
Nstraddle
Nescape cid12cid12cid12cid12cid12
expn 2 cH
gH o  1
It is this Planckian form of the normalization ratio that then leads to a Planckian dis-
tribution for the outgoing ux The straddling mode contains a Planckian distribution
of escaping modes
Note the physics assumption hidden here one is assuming that the quantum vac-
uum state is that corresponding to straddle That is freely falling observers who get
to see both sides of the horizon should not see any peculiarities as one crosses the
horizon Picking the quantum vacuum corresponding to straddle implies choosing the
Unruh vacuum  and when we look at this vacuum state far from the horizon we see
the Planckian ux of outgoing particles
If for whatever reason you dont like this normalization calculation or the related
thermodynamic arguments you can alternatively use the phase pileup property directly
to perform a Bogolubov coecient calculation in the style of 1 all roads lead to
7 Beyond s wave
What happens if we go beyond the s wave There is now some momentum transverse
to the apparent horizon so that
If we resolve the eld in terms of partial waves
  kk
  1
Then in the eikonal approximation I now suppress the i it has done its job and would
now only serve to clutter the formulae
2  2vr t k  cr t2  vr t2 k2  cr t2 k2
  0
That is
This is a quadratic for k as a function of  and k
  vk2  c2k2  c2k2
qc22  c2  v2c2k2
  v 
c2  v2
For ingoing modes near the apparent horizon one must evaluate using LHopitals rule
kin  
2  c2k2
2 cH 
So the ingoing modes do depend on k
r tin  Nin2 rH
expit 
r  rH2  c2k2
2 cH 
But that does not matter The ingoing modes are not the relevant ones For the
outgoing modes near the apparent horizon we see
kout 
gHr  rH
That is for the outgoing modes
The near-horizon asymptotic behaviour is independent of k
The phase pile-up is independent of k
Continuation of the outgoing modes across horizon is independent of k
The Hawking temperature independent of k
This behaviour is universal for all partial waves
Adding a mass term corresponds to
  c2k2
  m c2h2
In view of the above we see that the behaviour of the outgoing modes near the horizon
is also completely independent of the mass and transverse momentum Consequently
the same universal Hawking temperature applies to all masses and all partial waves
Again this is the easiest way I know of to convince oneself by elementary means that
restricting attention to the s-wave captures almost all the essential physics of Hawking
radiation
Note that while the Hawking temperature is completely independent of both an-
gular momentum and mass the grey-body factors are another matter they do depend
on both angular momentum and mass and are responsible for eectively cutting o the
higher angular momentum modes
8 Essential features
The only real physics input has been basic quantum physics plus the existence of a
Lorentzian metric with
 an apparent horizon
 non-zero gH
 slow evolution
The need for slow evolution of the geometry is hidden back in the approximation used
to write the modes as expit times a position-dependent factor This makes sense
only if the geometry is quasi-static on the timescale set by  So for consistency we
should only trust the Boltzmann factor and the Planckian nature of the Hawking
radiation for frequencies greater than max cc vv In particular in order for the
peak in the Planck spectrum to be meaningful we require
h  peak  max cc vv
In particular we require
dcr t  vr t
cid12cid12cid12cid12cid12H 
Near the horizon spatial gradients should dominate over temporal gradients In par-
ticular the closer the black hole is to extremality the slower it is permitted to evolve if
there is to be any hope for even a small segment of quasi-thermal spectrum
Thats it It is truly remarkable how basic and primitive the Hawking radiation
phenomenon is and how few physical assumptions are really necessary
9 Discussion
Can the essential conditions for the Hawking eect be further relaxed
One obvious question is the use of spherical symmetry which precludes direct
application of the current approach to Kerr and other rotating black holes This is a
technical problem not a fundamental problem and working in axisymmetric geometries
will be do-able but somewhat messier For KerrNewman black holes the Damour
Runi analysis can be adapted to this end 16 A tricky point for general analog model
geometries is that without the Einstein equations and something like the dominant
energy condition there is no longer any reason to believe in the zeroth law the
surface gravity and Hawking temperature can then in principle vary over dierent parts
of the apparent horizon these complications were suppressed in the current article via
the simple expedient of enforcing spherical symmetry For Killing horizons there are
derivations of the zeroth law that do not depend on the Einstein equations 30 but
such considerations lose their force once the horizon becomes time dependent
Secondly there are simple linguistic issues of denition How far can we push the
Hawking eect before we should give it another name As argued in this article based
on the physics there is a very good case for keeping the name the same for the eect
in arbitrary eective geometries no matter how derived Some would even argue
that the Hawking eect and Unruh eects are fundamentally identical I prefer to view
then as distinct possibly as two sides of the same coin  the response of the quantum
vacuum to externally imposed conditions
Thirdly What is the energy source for the Hawking radiation The infalling
particles have negative energy as seen from outside the apparent horizon In the case
of general relativity black holes the infalling particles serve to reduce the total mass-
energy of the central object and it is ultimately the total mass-energy of the black
hole that provides the energy emitted in the hawking ux In the case of an acoustic
black hole the infalling negative energy phonon steals kinetic energy from the uid
ow used to generate the acoustic geometry For eective geometries associated with
slow light the electromagnetic control eld used to generate EIT electromagnetically
induced transparency and so reduce the group velocity provides energy to the system
which is available to ultimately be converted to Hawking-like photons The general
message is that the Hawking eect steals energy from whatever process is used to set
up the eective geometry in question
Finally since this point still seems to cause much confusion I should make the
explicit comment that
 Hawking radiation is not a test of quantum gravity
Instead searching for Hawking radiation is a test of the general principles of quantum
eld theory in curved spacetimes As such it is an ingredient useful for testing semi-
classical quantum gravity though it does not necessarily probe quantum gravity itself
In particular all the proposed experimental tests of Hawking radiation via analog
models will only probe kinematic aspects of black hole physics To start to address
the dynamics of general relativity black holes one needs the Einstein equations or some
approximation thereto in which case one can begin to discuss Bekenstein entropy or
some approximation thereto This requires a whole extra layer of theoretical super-
structure and a key point of this paper is that it is important and useful to keep these
notions logically distinct
