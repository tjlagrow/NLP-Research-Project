Abstract We select and discuss the best observables to be used to constrain
models of galactic chemical evolution To this purpose we discuss the observables
in our Galaxy which is the best studied system as well as in external galaxies
Keywords Evolution of galaxies Abundances Star formation histories
1 Introduction
The best observables from the point of view of a chemical evolu-
tion model maker are those which allow us to signicatively constrain
the model parameters In other words the best observables can be
reproduced only by a specic combination of the model parameters
In order to analyze these best observables we should describe rst the
main parameters entering chemical evolution models
 the birthrate function namely the star formation rate SFR and
the initial mass function IMF
 the nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution namely the yields
 the gas ows infall and outow
 the feed-back between supernovae SNe and the interstellar medium
The still embryonic nature of our knowledge of these quantities
forces us to describe them by means of some free parameters and to
make some simplifying assumptions
The free parameters used in models of galactic chemical evolution
 the expression for the SFR the exponent of the gas density and
the eciency of star formation
 the expression for the infall or outow rates

 the amount of energy injected from SNe into the ISM which eec-
tively heats the gas
The stellar nucleosynthesis and the IMF although still uncertain can
be taken by independent sources Therefore they cannot be considered
as completely free parameters As a golden rule we suggest that in
general a good model of galactic chemical evolution should reproduce
a basic set of observables and the number of free parameters should be
less than the number of observables that they can t
The main assumptions made in models of galactic chemical evolution
 the instantaneous recycling approximation IRA ie ignoring
the stellar lifetimes
 the homogeneous and instantaneous mixing approximation
The IRA is a poor approximation if one wants to follow the evolution
of the abundances of chemical elements produced on long timescales
such as Fe and N or if one wants to model the evolution of a region
where the gas fraction is small  01 Therefore most of chemical
evolution models nowadays relax the IRA whereas on the other hand
the other assumption is still widely used and is a good approximation
if relatively small regions are considered
In our discussion we will focuse on the observables in our Galaxy
which is the best studied system Some of these observables turn out to
be better than others in the sense that they allow us to really constrain
the models since they can be reproduced only by a specic combination
of the various parameters In order to identify the best observables from
the point of view of a model maker in the next section we will describe
in more detail the main observational constraints and their relation to
the mechanisms of formation and evolution of the Galaxy
For external galaxies the number of observables is smaller we ob-
serve chemical abundances and gas distribution also in external spirals
whereas in ellipticals we can only measure integrated properties such
as colours and spectra We will try to envisage here which are the best
observables also for these galaxies and what we expect to measure in
the future
2 The observables in the Milky Way
Let us take our Galaxy as an example The Galaxy is a spiral system
where four main stellar components can be envisaged the stellar halo

the thick disk the thin disk and the bulge The stars in each of these
components have dierent chemical and kinematical characteristics in
particular the stars in the halo are the most metal poor  F eH 
-15 dex they travel on elongated orbits and therefore tend to possess
high radial velocities Their scale height above the Galactic plane is of
the order of 3 kpc The stars in the thin disk are rotating in circular
orbits around the Galactic center have a scale height above the plane
of the order of 200 pc and average metallicity of  F eH  -02 dex
The thin disk contains also gas and dust and the gas is either neutral
hydrogen HI or molecular hydrogen H2 The thick disk stars have
characteristics intermediate between the halo and the thin disk stars
both chemically and kinematically The average metallicity of the thick
disk stars is  F eH  06 dex and their scale height is around
920 pc The bulge stars have metallicities in the range -15  F eH 
10 dex and kinematics more like that of the halo stellar population
The basic observables for our Galaxy are
 1 the relative number of halo and disk stars in the solar neigh-
bourhood SN
 2 the metallicity distribution of stars in the halo bulge and local
 3 the local present day mass function PDMF
 4 the absolute solar abundances
 5 the age-metallicity relations
 6 the relative abundance ratios as functions of the relative metal-
licity relative to the Sun
 7 the distribution of angular momentum per unit mass of the stars
of the dierent Galactic components
 8 the present time infall rate gas fraction and SN rates Ia Ib
II in the SN
 9 the abundance gradients along the disk
 10 the distribution of gas HI plus H2 and SFR along the disk
1 The ratio between the halo stars and the total number of stars
in the SN is  003 Pagel and Patchett 1975 However this number
is probably underestimated and a more realistic value of this ratio
is  01 Chiappini et al 1997 Models which attempt to form the
disk out of the gas shed by the halo tend to overestimate this ratio

Figure 1 Observed and predicted G-dwarf metallicity distribution The data are
from Rocha-Pinto and Maciel 1996 whereas the model continuous line is from
Chiappini e al 1997
Therefore the indication is that the disk should have formed mainly
out of extragalactic gas
2 The G or F-dwarf metallicity distribution there are less than
10 of stars with FeH -10 dex and the distribution peaks at around
-02 dex see gure 1 This distribution is strictly related to the history
of the star formation in the local disk namely to the SFR and the IMF
The SFR in turn depends crucially on the mechanism of formation of
the Galactic disk A good t of this distribution shows that the local
disk formed by slow infall in particular on a timescale of 6-8 Gyr
Chiappini et al 1997 Boissier and Prantzos 1999 Slow infall is in
fact the best solution to the G-dwarf problem the fact that the Simple
Model of chemical evolution predicts too many metal poor disk stars
The metallicity distribution of halo stars is dierent from that of
disk stars and indicates a formation for the halo faster than for the
disk Again it is not possible to reproduce both distributions with a
model implying that the disk forms out of the gas lost from the halo
The metallicity distribution of stars in the Bulge shows a shape more
similar to that of the halo stars but is skewed towards a much more
metal rich domain up to FeH  10 dex This distribution Mc
William and Rich 1994 peaks at around FeH00 Comparison with
theoretical models shows that the Bulge formed faster than the disk
and with a atter IMF Matteucci and Brocato 1990 Matteucci et al
3 The local PDMF is the distribution with mass of the local Main
Sequence stars It represents an important constraint although very

Figure 2 A sketch of the predicted behaviour of the OFe ratio in the framework
of the time-delay model for three dierent histories of star formation corresponding
to the upper curve with the longest plateau to the bulge the median curve to the
solar neighbourhood and the lower curve to magellanic irregular galaxies andor the
outermost regions of the Galactic disk
few model makers take it into account because it represents the con-
volution of the IMF and the SFR A good model of chemical evolution
should try to reproduce the PDMF since this guarantes that there is
consistency between the IMF and the SFR Most of the uncertainties
in the PDMF reside in the low mass end where data are lacking
4 The solar and present time absolute abundances are known with
good accuracy However the predicted abundances depend on all the
model assumptions and therefore they can be reproduced by several
combinations of model parameters For this reason they do not repre-
sent an observable which can impose strong constraints on models
5 The age-metallicity relation indicates that FeH has continuosly
increased with the galactic age although the logarithmic nature of
FeH gives the impression of a attening at late times This observable
contains many uncertainties due to the uncertain stellar ages they can
be wrong by a factor of two and it is not a good constraint since it
can be reproduced either by a closed-box model without IRA or by
an infall model with IRA
In addition a large spread in FeH is observed at any xed age and
the nature of this spread is not yet clear Therefore we cannot learn
much from the age-metallicity relation Finally one should rather speak
of age-metallicity relations since it is very likely that dierent Galactic
regions had dierent enrichment histories
6 The abundance ratios versus metallicity elFe vs FeH are
good observables Abundance ratios depend only upon the stellar yields

Figure 3 Observed and predicted FeO versus OH The data are from Gratton
et al 2000 whereas the models are from Chiappini et al 1997
IMF plus stellar nucleosynthesis whereas the abundance ratios versus
metallicity elH vs FeH depend upon the yields and the star
formation history through FeH Under the assumption of a con-
stant IMF in space and time these relations can be interpreted in the
framework of the time-delay between the enrichment due to SN II and
SN Ia time-delay model A dierent star formation history under this
assumption results in a dierent elFe versus FeH relation see for
example OFe vs FeH As shown in gure 2 galaxies or Galactic
regions with a slower evolutionary history show a change in the slope
of the OFe ratio occurring at smaller metallicities than in regions
where the SFR has been quite fast eg the Galactic bulge Therefore
the t of such diagrams gives us an indication about the star formation
history of the Galaxy besides the information on the nucleosynthesis
and SN progenitors An interesting aspect of these plots is that the
FeO vs OH and FeMg vs MgH relations indicate that there
has been a period between the formation of the halo and the disk when
the star formation must have stopped This eect is visible from the
steep rise of the FeO at OH  -02 dex indicating that for a
certain period models indicate this period as no longer than 1 Gyr
Gratton et al 2000 the Fe abundance was increasing whereas the O
one was constant and this can be explained by a halt in the SFR The
same eect is present in the relation FeMg vs MgH see Fuhrmann
Another interesting nding is by Nissen and Schuster 1997 who
discovered some halo stars which are likely to have formed in the outer
halo with metallicities overlapping those of disk stars -13 F eH

05 but with Fe ratios lower than the corresponding ratios in disk
stars of the same metallicity As a consequence of this the transition
between halo and disk was probably not a smooth one as originally
suggested by Eggen et al 1962 A possible interpretation for these
halo stars can be that the halo formed inside-out namely that the
external halo was formed by slow infall An alternative explanation
can be that these halo stars have been accreted from dwarf satellites of
the Galaxy where the star formation proceeded in bursts followed by
quiescent periods during which only iron was produced
7 The distribution of the angular momentum per unit mass as a
function of the angular momentum Wyse and Gilmore 1992 shows
that the halo and the bulge stars have a very similar distribution and
the same holds for the stars in the thick and thin disk but the distri-
bution of the halo-bulge is dierent from that of the thick-thin disk
clearly indicating that the bulk of the disk cannot have formed out of
gas lost by the halo As a consequence of this we conclude that it is
likely that most of the gas which formed the disk came from outside
8 The present time infall rate gas fraction and SN rates are good
constraints only if coupled with all the others In fact theoretical mod-
els can always be adjusted to reproduce these absolute quantities by
varying the various parameters as in the case of the absolute abun-
dances However the ratio between the SN rates is a good observable
since it depends only on the supernova progenitors and the IMF
9 Strong constraints on the mechanism of formation of the Galactic
disk are imposed by the abundance gradients The gradients show that
the abundances of heavy elements tend to decrease with the galactocen-
tric distance Abundance gradients are strongly related to the mecha-
nism of formation of the disk in particular on the infall law and the star
formation rate It can be shown that the rst condition required to t
the observed gradients measured from HII regions planetary nebulae
B stars is to assume an inside-out formation for the Galactic disk
in the sense that the inner disk must have formed faster than the outer
disk The second condition is that the SFR should be strongly declining
with the increasing galactocentric distance Both these assumptions
are necessary Radial ows may enhance the predicted gradients but
only under specic conditions A particularly useful abundance gradient
to measure is the D gradient which is expected to be positive This
element in fact is only destroyed in stars astration so it is a good
indicator about the star formation history along the disk Gradients of
abundance ratios such as OFe and NO are important since they
give us an idea about the timescales of disk formation at dierent galac-
tocentric distances A negative OFe gradient for example would
mean that the outer regions of the disk formed more slowly than the
matteuccitex 7102013 337 p7

inner one thus allowing more pollution from type Ia SNe for the same
FeH On the other hand a positive OFe gradient would mean the
contrary
10 The conclusions above are valid also for reproducing the SFR
and the gas distributions along the disk These distributions cannot
be reproduced unless a strongly varying SFR is assumed This strong
variation is achieved either by adding a dependence of the SFR on the
total surface mass density or a dependence on R1 R is the galacto-
centric distance see Prantzos and Boissier 1999 The dependence on
the surface gas density which best ts the data is k  15 in very good
agreement with the observational estimate by Kennicutt 1998 The
gas distribution along the disk shows a maximum at  4 kpc followed by
a rapid drop for smaller galactocentric distances which can be better
explained by including some dynamical eects such as the presence
of a central bar see Portinari and Chiosi 2000 Observationally the
SFR along the Galactic disk is a quite uncertain quantity derived from
the distributions of pulsars SN remnants Lyman continuum photons
and molecular clouds under the assumption of an IMF Therefore it
is better to plot the ratio SF RRSF RR in order to avoid the
uncertainty related with the choice of the IMF The gas distribution
along the disk is determined from the HI and H2 gas The distribution
of this latter is quite uncertain since is derived by assuming a conversion
factor usually constant along the disk between the amount of CO and
the amount of H2
3 The observables in spiral galaxies
In external spirals the most obvious observables are represented by
the abundance gradients and the gas and SFR distributions when
available Abundance gradients and gas distributions in external spirals
are similar to those in the Milky Way Henry and Worthey 1999
This fact may indicate that galactic disks have a common origin ie
an inside-out formation and that we can perhaps just describe the
evolution of disks by using suitable scaling laws based on dierences on
the total and gas mass Other observables in external spirals and in the
Galaxy are the colour gradients along the disk Prantzos and Boissier
2000 have shown that the assumption of an inside-out formation
for disks can well reproduce the observed gradients including the ab-
sence of colour gradients at large galactocentric distances In fact this
hypothesis implies dierent scale lengths for the distribution of stellar
proles In particular in the inside-out scenario the scale lenght in the
B band is predicted to be RB  4 kpc whereas that in the K band
matteuccitex 7102013 337 p8

is RK  26 kpc in good agreement with observations This is due to
the fact that in the inner regions of the disk one predicts considerably
older stellar populations relative to the outer regions where there are
mostly young stars However photometric models still contain many
uncertainties mainly because of the existence of the age-metallicity
degeneracy problem consisting in the fact that age and metallicity
act in the same way on integrated colors Therefore it is dicult to
disentangle the two eects and integrated colors are not themselves
good observables unless other constraints are considered at the same
4 Observables in elliptical galaxies
The observables which are relevant to study the chemical evolution of
elliptical galaxies are represented by the metallicity indices such as
for example M g2  F e  and H These indices are measured from
integrated spectra and depend on the metallicity and the age again the
age-metallicity degeneracy of the stellar population which dominates
in the visual light The index H perhaps is an exception since it de-
pends mostly on the age and it can be used to break the degeneracy The
main problem with metallicity indicators is that they do not represent
the real abundances and one needs to use a calibration to calculate
such abundances Elliptical galaxies show a mild increase of M g2 with
galactic mass measured through the stellar velocity dispersion this
is known as mass-metallicity relation
Data for cluster and eld ellipticals have shown that the relation
 F e  vs M g2 is quite at indicating that the MgFe ratio should
be an increasing function of the galactic luminosity This nding is
the contrary of what is expected from galactic models with SN-driven
galactic winds as originally proposed by Larson 1976 These models
in fact predict exactly the opposite due to the longer star formation
period predicted for the more massive ellipticals relative to the less mas-
sive ones An explanation for this behaviour can be that galactic winds
are occurring earlier in massivegalaxies than in small galaxies and this
can be achieved if the SFR increases with galactic mass However this
trend of the SFR has to be calibrated in such a way not to destroy the
mass-metallicity relation see Matteucci 1994 The metallicity indices
indicate the existence of abundance gradients also inside ellipticals but
it is not yet clear if the gradient of M g2 is atter steeper or the same
as the gradient of  F e  This is an important point in order to un-
derstand the formation and evolution of these galaxies Another strong
constraint on the evolution and formation of ellipticals is provided by

5 Conclusions
In this paper we have analyzed the best observables from the point of
view of a model maker Although we are not able to identify a unique
model of galactic chemical evolution we can envisage those observables
which allow us to better constrain the models We have discussed the
available constraints for the Milky Way external spirals and ellipticals
and their interpretation by means of chemical evolution models The
comparison between models and observations suggests that the best
observables are
 i The abundance ratios and the relation between abundance ra-
tios and metallicity They allow us to impose constraints on the
stellar nucleosynthesis and on the star formation history under
the assumption of a constant IMF
 ii The distribution of dwarf stars as a function of metallicity
This is related to the star formation history and therefore to the
evolution of the gas content It would be auspicious to be able to
observe such a distribution also in external galaxies both spirals
and ellipticals to gain insight onto their formation and evolution
 iii Kinematical and chemical studies of stars representing the halo-
disk transition provide a very important constraint in connection
with the formation and evolution of the Galaxy In particular it
is important to search for possible correlations between orbital
parameters and abundance ratios
 iv The abundance gradients along galactic disks are sensitive to
the star formation history and stellar nucleosynthesis They can
be used to infer the story of the formation of disks and gradi-
ents of abundance ratios between elements formed on dierent
timescales can also give an idea about the timescales of disk
formation at various galactocentric distances Abundance gradi-
ents are now measured in external spirals and in elliptical galaxies
although in this case the metallicity is inferred through indices
and we hope that in the next years more and more data will be
available In particular we would like to see detailed abundance
measurements of elements such as -elements O Mg Si Ca
and Fe which represent an important tool for understanding the

mechanisms of galaxy formation and evolution in external galaxies
since they can be used as cosmic clocks and are related to the star
formation history As a consequence abundances and abundance
ratios can also be used to infer the nature of high redshift galaxies
