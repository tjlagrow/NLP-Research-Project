Abstract
Hawking radiation is viewed as a tunnelling process In this way the eect of self-
gravitation gives rise to semiclassical corrections to the entropy of the 2  1 BTZ
black hole The modied entropy due to specic modelling of the self-gravitation
eect of the 2  1 BTZ black hole is evaluated To rst order in  which is a
shell of energy radiated outwards the event horizon of the BTZ black hole modied
In this semiclassical analysis corrections
entropy is proportional to the horizon
to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula SBH  AH4l2
P are found to be negative and
the proportionality factor connecting the modied entropy Sbh of the 2  1 BTZ
black hole to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy SBH is evaluated to rst order in

In this work we apply the Keski-Vakkuri Kraus and Wilczek 1 2 3 4 methodology to
the 2  1 BTZ black hole The idea of KKW method is to view the BTZ black hole
background as dynamical by treating the Hawking radiation 5 as a tunnelling process
6 7 8 9 10 The energy conservation is the key to this description The total ADM
mass is kept xed while the mass of the BTZ black hole decreases due to the emitted
radiation The eect of self gravitation gives rise to additional terms in the Bekenstein-
Hawking area formula concerning the BTZ black hole entropy
The black hole solutions of Banados Teitelboim and Zanelli 11 12 in 2  1 spacetime
dimensions are derived from a three dimensional theory of gravity
S Z dx3g 3R  2
with a negative cosmological constant   0
The corresponding line element is

with M the ADM mass J the angular momentum spin of the BTZ black hole and
  t   0  r  
For the positive mass black hole spectrum with spin J 6 0 the line element 2 has two
horizons
M  M 2  J 2
with r r the outer and inner horizon respectively
The area AH and Hawking temperature TH of the event outer horizon are 13 14

The entropy of the spinning BTZ black hole is
Sbh  4r
and if we reinstate the Planck units since in BTZ units 8G  1 we get
4GAH  SBH
which is the well-known Bekenstein-Hawking area formula SBH  for the entropy  15
5 16 or 17 where the formula is proven by counting excited states
In order to apply the idea of Keski-Vakkuri Kraus and Wilczek to the positive mass BTZ
black hole spectrum with xed J we have to make a coordinate transformation We choose
the Painleve coordinates 18 utilized recently in 19 for black hole backgrounds which
are non-singular on the outer horizon r We are thus able to deal with phenomena for
which the main contribution comes from the outer horizon
We introduce the time coordinate P and the angular coordinate P by imposing the
ansatz
pgr dt  pgr dP  p1  gr
2r2cid19p1  gr
pgr d  pgr dP cid18 J
gr  M  r2 
The line element 2 is now written as
ds2  grd 2
P  2p1  grdP dr  dr2 
P  2r1  M  r2 
P  J dP dP  r2d2
dP dr  dr2
 cid0M  r2cid1 d 2
P  J dP dP 
 r2d2
It is obvious from the above expression that there is no singularity at the points r and
r The radial   constant null ds2  0 geodesics followed by a massless particle
r 
 r1 
4r2 r1  M  r2 
where the signs  and  correspond to the outgoing and ingoing geodesics respectively
under the assumption that P increases towards future
We next x the total ADM mass and let the mass M of the BTZ black hole vary If a shell
of energy mass  is radiated outwards the outer horizon then the BTZ black hole mass
will be reduced to M   and the shell of energy will travel on the modied geodesics

It is known that the emission rate from a radiating source can be expressed in terms of
the imaginary part of the action for an outgoing positive-energy particle as
  e2ImS
but also in terms of the temperature and the entropy of the radiating source which in our
case will be a BTZ black hole
  e  eS bh
where  is the inverse temperature of the BTZ black hole and S bh is the change in
the entropy of the BTZ black hole before and after the emission of the shell of energy 
outgoing massless particle It is clear that if we evaluate the action then we will know
the temperature andor the change in the entropy of the BTZ black hole
We therefore evaluate the imaginary part of the action for an outgoing positive-energy
particle which crosses the event horizon outwards from

Apparently the emission rate depends not only on the mass M and angular momentum
spin J of the BTZ black hole but also on the energy  of the emitted massless particle

Comparing 23 and 17 in which

we deduce that the modied entropy due to the specic modelling of the self-gravitation
eect of the BTZ black hole is
Sbh M  J  4routs1

where S0 is an arbitrary constant which will be evaluated
The second term in equation 24 should be the Bekenstein-Hawking area formula
and comparing with equation 23 we obtain

Hence the arbitrary constant S0 is given as

Therefore substituting expression 28 for the arbitrary constant S0 in equation 25
we get the full expression for the modied entropy due to the specic modelling of the
self-gravitation eect of the 2  1 BTZ black hole

We see that there are deviations from the standard result previously mentioned see
equation 6 for a xed BTZ black hole background The entropy of the BTZ black hole
is no longer the Bekestein-Hawking area formula SBH  The corrections to the Bekestein-
Hawking area formula for the entropy are not obviously negative In order to examine if
the modied entropy is smaller or larger compared to the entropy SBH for the xed BTZ
black hole background we work to rst order in 
We Taylor expand rout and keep up to linear terms in  The result is
where  is a parameter
rout  rin 1   
2M 2  J 2
This parameter is small for suciently large mass of the BTZ black hole as it is expected
for such a semiclassical analysis here employed since the radiating matter is viewed as
point particles
Therefore the modied entropy in 29 evaluated to rst order in  is given as
Sbh M  J  SBHcid261   h1 
inicid27
in  1
for suciently large mass of the BTZ black hole
It is now obvious that to rst order in  the semiclassical corrections to the Bekenstein-
Hawking area formula for the entropy are negative Therefore the maximum entropy that
a black hole can have is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy SBH  and when semiclassical
eects are included the entropy decreases
Sbh M  J  SBH 
A welcomed but not unexpected result is that equality in the above equation holds for
zeroth order in  
We also see that the modied entropy 32 of the 2  1 BTZ black hole is proportional
to its horizon area The modied entropy 32 will then be written as
Sbh M  J  SBH
where the dimensionless proportionality factor  
 cid261   h1 
inicid27
is a function of the emitted shells energy  and the 2  1 BTZ black hole parameters
i mass ii angular momentum Therefore the modied entropy can be written as
Sbh M  J 
4Abh M  J
where the area of the 2  1 BTZ black hole has now been modied to
Abh M  J  ABH 
This is mainly the reason for the modications to the Bekestein-Hawking entropy of the
2  1 BTZ black hole due to the specic modelling of the self-gravitation eect adopted
