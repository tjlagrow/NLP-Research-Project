ABSTRACT
This  paper  refers  to  the  syntactic  analysis  of  phrases  in  Romanian  as  an  important  process  of  natural
language  processing  We  will  suggest  a  real-time  solution  based  on  the  idea  of  using  some  words  or
groups of words that indicate grammatical category and some specific endings of some parts of sentence
Our idea is based on some characteristics of the Romanian language where some prepositions adverbs or
some  specific  endings  can  provide  a  lot  of  information  about  the  structure  of  a  complex sentence  Such
characteristics  can  be  found  in  other  languages  too  such  as  French  Using a  special  grammar  we
developed  a  system DIASEXP that  can  perform  a  dialogue  in  natural  language  with  assertive  and
interogative sentences about a story a set of sentences describing some events from the real life

1 INTRODUCTION
Before  making  a  semantic  analysis  of  natural  language  we  should  define  the  lexicon  and
syntactic  rules  of  a  formal  grammar  useful  in  generating  simple  sentences  in  the  respective
language for example English French or Romanian
We shall consider a simple grammar having some rules for the lexicon and some rules for the
grammatical categories The rules for the lexicon will be of the type 1
G  W
where G is a grammatical category or part of speech and W is an word from a certain dictionary
The other syntactic rules will be of the type 2
G1  G2 G3
meaning that the first grammatical category G1 forms out of the concatenation of the other two
G2 and G3 from the right side of the arrow

Our  simple  grammar  is  presented  in  Figure  1  It  contains  only  few  Romanian  words  and  the
syntax rules constitute a subset of the Romanian syntax rules

Figure 1 Example of simple grammar for Romanian language
In  Figure  1  we  used  these  notations S   sentence NP   noun  phrase VP   verb  phrase N 
noun Det  determiner article AP  adjectival phrase A  adjective C  conjunction V  verb
CA  group made up of a conjunction and an adjective
This grammar generates correct sentences in English such as
 Orice femeie iubete Every woman loves
 Un oarece urte o pisic A mouse hates a cat
Fiecare brbat detept iubete o femeie frumoas i deteapt Every smart man
loves a beautiful and smart woman
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
On the other hand this grammar rejects incorrect phrases such as orice iubete un brbat any
loves  a  man The  previously  phrases  contains  words  only  from  the  chosen  vocabulary
However  our  grammar overgenerates  that  is  it  generates  sentences  that  are  grammatically
incorrect  such  as  Ea frumoas sau  deteapt iubete She  beautiful  or  smart  loves  El
iubete  el He  loves  he and  O brbat iubete  pisic An  man  loves  cat  even  these
phrases contain words from the selected lexicon
Also the  grammar subgenerates  meaning  that  there  are  many  sentences  in Romanian that
grammar  rejects  such  as  Orice  femeie  iubete sau urte un brbat This  phrase  is  correct  in
Romanian  and  contains  words  from  the  given  dictionary Also the  phrase  nite cini ursc o
pisic  some  dogs  hate  a  cat  although  syntactically  correct  in  Romanian  is  not  accepted
because it contains words that have not been entered into our vocabulary
The syntactic analysis or the parsing of a string of words may be seen as a process of searching
for a derivation tree This may be achieved either starting from S and searching for a tree with the
words  from  the given  phrase as  leaves  top-down  parsing  or  starting  from  the  words  and
searching for a tree with the root S bottom-up parsing An algorithm of efficient parsing is based
on dynamic programming each time that we analyze the phrase or the string of words we store
the  result  so  that  we  may  not  have  to reanalyze it  later  For  example  as  soon  as  we  have
discovered that a string of words is a NP we may record the result in a data structure called chart
The  algorithms  that  perform  this  operation  are  called  chart-parsers  The  chart-parser  algorithm
uses  a  polynomial  time  and  a  polynomial  space  In Ptru   Boghian  2010 we developed a
chart-parser  based  on  the  Cocke  Younger  and  Kasami  algorithm We  presented a  Delphi
application  that  analyzes  the  lexicon  and  the  syntax  of  a  sentence  in  Romanian  We  used a
Chomsky normal form CNF grammar Chomsky 1965
2 USING THE DEFINITE CLAUSE GRAMMARS
In order for our grammar not to generate incorrect sentences we should use the notions of gender
number  case etc specifying  for  example  that  femeie  and  frumoas have  the  feminine
gender  and  the singular  number The  string  El  iubete  ea  is  incorrect  because  ea  is  in
nominative case and we should use the pe preposition in order to obtain the accusative case
The correct phrase is El iubete pe ea or evenEl o iubete pe ea He loves her
If we take into account the case grammar is no longer independent from the context it is not true
that any NP is equal to any other NP irrespective of the context Nevertheless if we want to work
with a grammar that is independent from the context we may split the category NP into two NPN
and NPA  in  order  to  represent  verbal  groups  in  the nominative  subjective  respectively
accusative  objective case  We  shall  also  have  to  split  the  category Pron into  two  categories
PronN including El and PronA including pe ea her which contains the preposition pe
in front of the pronoun ea Russel  Norvig 2002
Another  issue  concerns  the  agreement  between  the  subject  and  main  verb  of  the  sentence
predicate For example if Eu I is the subject then Eu iubesc I love is grammatically
correct whereas Eu iubete I loves is not Then we shall have to split NPN and NPA into
several alternatives in order to reach the agreement As we identify more and more distinctions
we eventually obtain an exponential number
A  more  efficient  solution  is  to  improve augment  the  existing  grammar  rules  by  using
parameters  for  non-terminal  categories  The  categories NP and Pron have  parameters called
gender number and case The rule for the NP has as arguments the variables gender number and
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
This formalism of improvement is called definite clause grammar DCG because each grammar
rule may be interpreted as a definite clause in Horns logic Pereira  Warren 1980 Giurca
Using adequate predicates a CFG context free grammar rule as S  NP VP will be written in
the form of the definite clause NPs1 VPs2  Ss1s2 with the meaning that if s1 is NP s2 is
VP then the concatenation of s1 with s2 is S DCGs allow us to see parsing as a logical inference
Klein  2005 The  real  benefit  of  the  DCG  approach  is  that  we  can  improve  the  symbols  of
categories with additional arguments for example the rule NPgender Ngender turns into the
definite  clause Ngender s1 cid222
NPgender s1  meaning  that  if s1 is  a noun with  the  gender
gender  then s1 is also  a noun  phrase with the  same gender  Generally  we  may  supplement  a
symbol  of  category  with  any  number  of  arguments  and  the  arguments  are  parameters  that
constitute  the  subject  of  unification  like  in  the  common inference of Horns clauses Russel 
Norvig 2002
Even with the improvements brought by DCG incorrect sentences may still be overgenerated In
order deal with the correct verbal groups in some situations we shall have to split the category V
into two subcategories one for the verbs with no object and one for the verbs with a single object
and so on Thus we shall have to specify which expressions groups may follow each verb that
is  realize  a  subcategorization  of  that  verb  by  the  list  of  objects  An  object  is  a  compulsory
expression that follows the verb within a verbal group
Because there are a lot of problems in dealing with the syntactic analysis or a phrase the time of
the  processing  the  complex  situations  of  the  texts  in  Romanian  language  describing  real life
situations we decided to use some morphological characteristic features of the Romanian words
that can be useful in order to determine the parts of the sentences
2 THE IDEA  FOR  SYNTACTIC  ANALYSIS  BASED  ON  MORPHOLOGICAL
CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE LANGUAGE
As  we  explain  in  the  introduction  the  classic  ideas of  syntactic  analysis  uses lexicons
dictionaries CFG or DCG grammars and chart-parsers as that developed by  us in Ptru 
Boghian 2010
In the previous sections we note the following
1 Using  a  CFG  grammar  syntactically  correct  sentences  in  Romanian  are  accepted  as
well as incorrect ones
2 The power of the analysis system for example a chart-parser based on such a grammar
depends on the extent of the vocabulary used
3 The  power  of  a  chart-parser can  be  improved  using DCG  grammars  This  implies  to
extent the set of the syntactic rules with a lot of new rules using special variables like
gender case number etc
As  concerns  the  first and  the  last issues  let  us  assume  that  the  system  will  not  be  required  to
analyze incorrect  sentences  therefore  we  consider  the  grammar  satisfactory  Regarding  the
second problem it could be solved by strongly enriching the vocabulary a fact that would require
the elaboration and implementing of some data structures and searching techniques as efficient as
possible  which  however  will  not  function  in  real  time  in  some  cases  Of  course  the  main
problem  would  be  to  write as  comprehensive  a  grammar  as  possible  close  to  the  linguistic
realities  of  Romanian  morphology  taking  into  consideration  the  diversity  of  forms  and
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
meanings that a sentence can get in the Romanian language However the extent and complexity
of grammar leads to slowing the analysis therefore this will not be done in real-time in all cases
In this section we will suggest a real-time solution based on the idea of using
some words or groups of words that indicate grammatical category
some specific endings of the inflected words that indicate some parts of sentence
Our idea is based on some characteristics of the Romanian language where some prepositions or
some specific endings can provide us a lot of information about the structure of a complex phrase
Such characteristics  can be found in other languages too such as  French Using our ideas we
developed a system that uses a special grammar which we will explain
The morphology of the Romanian language allows the developing of a special syntactic analysis
that  makes  full  use  of  certain  characteristics  of  words  when  they  are inflected  declined  or
conjugated or under different hypostases
With  a  view  to  understanding  a  Romanian  sentence  to  finding  the  constituent  parts  which
would favor the  translation  of  the  sentence  into  another  language  in  real  time  we  suggest  a
simple solution based on patterns
there is a minimal vocabulary of key words prefixes1 linking words endings
a relatively limited grammar is realized in which the terminals are some words either with
given endings or from another given vocabulary
the user is asked to respect some restrictions of sentence word order relatively a few
the user is assumed to be well meaning
In Figure 2 it is presented the general scheme for such an analyzer Ptru  Boghian 2012
In Figure 2 we select the concrete case of the sentence Copii cei cumini au recitat o poezie
prinilor  n  faa  colii  The  good  children  recited  a  poem  to  their  parents  in  front  of  the
school
In stage 2 predicate nouns and adjectives are identified introduced by pronouns or prepositions
direct  or  indirect  objects  inarticulate  used  without  an  article  introduced  by  articles
prepositions  and  prepositional  phrases  respectively  adverbials  in  stage  3  articled  direct  and
indirect objects are identified etc
Following the logic of processes within the analyzer we notice that the final result that is correct
in  our  case  up  to  an  additional  detailing  is  approximate  because  the  system  is  based  on  the
observations made by us which are
In Romanian the subject usually precedes the predicate copiii the children before au
recitat recited
 There are some words or groups of words that we call prefixes or indicators that introduce
adverbials n faa in front of  place adverbial fiindc because din cauz
c  cause adverbial pentru a for purpose adverbial
 The predicate nouns the adjectives and the objects direct and indirect can be introduced by
indicating prefixes lui Ion Gheorghe etc to  indirect object or predicate noun
1 by prefixes we understand words or groups of words having the role to indicate the sense of the next
words from the phrase
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
o  fat  girl  pisic  cat  etc  a    direct  object  if  these  have  not  been
already identified as subject Thus it is to assume that we will say un biat citete o carte
a boy is reading a book and not o carte e ceea ce citete un biat or o carte este citit
de un biat a book is that which a boy is reading or a book is being read by a boy
therefore the subject precedes the object
Some  endings  offer  sufficient  information  about  the  nature  of  the  respective  words  in  the
word prinilor the ending -ilor indicates an indirect object2 just like -ei from fetei
mamei  indicates  the  same  type  of object  the  -ul  from  biatul  creionul  indicate
however a direct object articled
Figure 2 Stages of the analysis
We  thus  notice  that  our  sentence  recognized  by  an analyzer of  the  type  presented  above  is
structurally complex enough as compared to the famous orice brbat iubete o femeie any
man loves a woman given as an example for classic chart-parsers
It should also be noted that the sentence I o i pe M deoarece M e f J l M because M i b
could be recognized by the analyzer on the basis of the pattern
subiect predicat pe complement direct deoarece circumstanial de cauz
subject predicateon direct objectbecause cause adverbial
Thus the above sentence although meaningless in Romanian would enter the same category
as Ion o iubete pe Maria deoarece Maria este frumoas John loves Mary because Mary is
beautiful a category represented by the pattern mentioned above
2 Of course prinilor could be an indirect object as well as a predicative noun like in the sentence the
good  children  recited  the  poems  of  their  parents  in  front  of  the  school  copiii  cei  cumini  au  recitat
poeziile  prinilor  n  faa  colii  therefore  frequently  not  even  grammar  can  solve  the  systems
ambiguities
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
3 CREATING AND CONSULTING A DATABASE
Of course by introducing more such sentences phrases the user can create a table in a database
with the structure of a sentence therefore each entry would contain the fields subject predicate
predicative noun direct object indirect object place adverbial etc The detailed structure of the
table is presented in section 5 when we will discuss about the DIASEXP shystem we developed
Consulting such a database would be made through Romanian interrogative sentences phrases
for example
 Cine  predicat  complement  direct  
Cine  citete  cartea  
predicatedirect object Who is reading the book
in  order  to  find  out  the  subject  using  a  search  engine  based  on  pattern-matching  matching
patterns  in  which  the  search  clues  would  be  the  predicate  is  reading and  also  the  direct
object book
Although the results of the analysis and by this the answers to the questions also have a high
degree  of  precision  that  depends  on  respecting  the  word  order  restrictions  imposed  by  the
vocabulary taken into consideration such a system that we have realised and that works in real
time can be successfully used Moreover the system realised by us may enrich through learning
its vocabulary so that by using only the 300 initial words and endings it may cover a wide range
of situations

Figure 3 A grammar for Romanian based on morphological characteristics
It is to be noted that the adverbs used are the general ones and the adjectives are those most
frequently used in common speech Also please note that by  we noted the concatenation of
two words fete  lor  fetelor This concatenation can be influenced in some cases by a
phonemic alternance like in fateifetei where we have the phonemic alternance a
see Ptru 2010 for details
4 DIASEXP
Using  the  grammar  from  the  previous  section  we  developed  the  DIASEXP system  DIASEXP
have  a  simple  text  interface  where  the  user  can  introduce  different  phrases  describing  some
knowledge about some real life events This collection of phrases is recorded as a story Each
phrase  of  the  story  is  analyzed  by  the  system  which  will  automatically  detect  the  parts  of  the
sentence and will add these into a table with the following fields
1 Subject  this will represent the simple subject of the sentence a noun or a pronoun see
rules 4 and 37 in Figure 3
2 Attribsub  this will be the attribute of the subject it can be for example an adjective
see rules 9 and 12 in the same figure
3 Predicate  the predicate of the sentence will represent the main action of the assertive
sentence the predicate can be represented by a normal verb or the copulative verb a fi
to be which will be folowed by a predicative noun nume predicativ - see rules 38
and 39
4 Dirobj  the direct object or the predicative noun see rules 7 13 21 and 34
5 Attributedo  this will be the attribute of the direct object see rules 7 10 12 and 28
Indirobj  the indirect object see rules 8 14 22 and 35
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
7 Attributeio  this  will  be  the  attribute  of  the  indirect  object  the  attributes  will  be
represented by adejectives or by some prepositional phrases  see rules 81112 and 28
8 Where  this will be the place adverbial see rules 3 6 15 23 and 30
9 When  this will be the time adverbial see rules 3 6 16 24 and 31
10 How  this will be the manner adverbial see rules 3 6 17 25 and 32
11 Goal  this will be the goal adverbial it will be the answer at the question Pentru ce
For what see rules 3 6 18 and 26
12 Why  this will be the cause adverbial see rules 3 6 19 and 27
When DIASEXP isnt sure about which part of the sentence a word is it will ask the user with
two or three variants and the user will indicate the correct version The next time in a similar
situation DIASEXP will know the answer and it will not ask again However the use of commas
will be very helpful in order to avoid the ambiguities
After entering some assertive sentences the user can  enter some interrogative  sentences  When
the user will ask something DIASEXP it will answer consulting the assertive sentences it known
by that moment
Below Table 1 you can find an example of a story from a dialogue between DIASEXP and a
human user The assertive sentences are prefixed by A the interogative sentences are prefixed by
I and the DIASEXPs answers are prefixed by R In the right column the English translation is
presented

5 CONCLUSIONS
CFG  and  DCG  are  types  of  generative  grammars  used  in  the  syntactic  analysis  of  a  phrase  in
natural  language  Sometimes  long  or  complex  phrases  will  be  a  problem  for  the  classic  chart-
parsers The characteristic features of the Romanian language related to the morphology of words
or the way in which adverbials are formed can be successfully used in the syntactic analysis by
using  a  system  based  on  patterns This  system  will  work  in  real-time  and  will  not  record  the
whole dictionary of Romanian language It will use a small dictionary of prefixes prepositions
adverbs etc and some endings and linking words

ABSTRACT
This  paper  refers  to  the  syntactic  analysis  of  phrases  in  Romanian  as  an  important  process  of  natural
language  processing  We  will  suggest  a  real-time  solution  based  on  the  idea  of  using  some  words  or
groups of words that indicate grammatical category and some specific endings of some parts of sentence
Our idea is based on some characteristics of the Romanian language where some prepositions adverbs or
some  specific  endings  can  provide  a  lot  of  information  about  the  structure  of  a  complex sentence  Such
characteristics  can  be  found  in  other  languages  too  such  as  French  Using a  special  grammar  we
developed  a  system DIASEXP that  can  perform  a  dialogue  in  natural  language  with  assertive  and
interogative sentences about a story a set of sentences describing some events from the real life

1 INTRODUCTION
Before  making  a  semantic  analysis  of  natural  language  we  should  define  the  lexicon  and
syntactic  rules  of  a  formal  grammar  useful  in  generating  simple  sentences  in  the  respective
language for example English French or Romanian
We shall consider a simple grammar having some rules for the lexicon and some rules for the
grammatical categories The rules for the lexicon will be of the type 1
G  W
where G is a grammatical category or part of speech and W is an word from a certain dictionary
The other syntactic rules will be of the type 2
G1  G2 G3
meaning that the first grammatical category G1 forms out of the concatenation of the other two
G2 and G3 from the right side of the arrow

Our  simple  grammar  is  presented  in  Figure  1  It  contains  only  few  Romanian  words  and  the
syntax rules constitute a subset of the Romanian syntax rules

Figure 1 Example of simple grammar for Romanian language
In  Figure  1  we  used  these  notations S   sentence NP   noun  phrase VP   verb  phrase N 
noun Det  determiner article AP  adjectival phrase A  adjective C  conjunction V  verb
CA  group made up of a conjunction and an adjective
This grammar generates correct sentences in English such as
 Orice femeie iubete Every woman loves
 Un oarece urte o pisic A mouse hates a cat
Fiecare brbat detept iubete o femeie frumoas i deteapt Every smart man
loves a beautiful and smart woman
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
On the other hand this grammar rejects incorrect phrases such as orice iubete un brbat any
loves  a  man The  previously  phrases  contains  words  only  from  the  chosen  vocabulary
However  our  grammar overgenerates  that  is  it  generates  sentences  that  are  grammatically
incorrect  such  as  Ea frumoas sau  deteapt iubete She  beautiful  or  smart  loves  El
iubete  el He  loves  he and  O brbat iubete  pisic An  man  loves  cat  even  these
phrases contain words from the selected lexicon
Also the  grammar subgenerates  meaning  that  there  are  many  sentences  in Romanian that
grammar  rejects  such  as  Orice  femeie  iubete sau urte un brbat This  phrase  is  correct  in
Romanian  and  contains  words  from  the  given  dictionary Also the  phrase  nite cini ursc o
pisic  some  dogs  hate  a  cat  although  syntactically  correct  in  Romanian  is  not  accepted
because it contains words that have not been entered into our vocabulary
The syntactic analysis or the parsing of a string of words may be seen as a process of searching
for a derivation tree This may be achieved either starting from S and searching for a tree with the
words  from  the given  phrase as  leaves  top-down  parsing  or  starting  from  the  words  and
searching for a tree with the root S bottom-up parsing An algorithm of efficient parsing is based
on dynamic programming each time that we analyze the phrase or the string of words we store
the  result  so  that  we  may  not  have  to reanalyze it  later  For  example  as  soon  as  we  have
discovered that a string of words is a NP we may record the result in a data structure called chart
The  algorithms  that  perform  this  operation  are  called  chart-parsers  The  chart-parser  algorithm
uses  a  polynomial  time  and  a  polynomial  space  In Ptru   Boghian  2010 we developed a
chart-parser  based  on  the  Cocke  Younger  and  Kasami  algorithm We  presented a  Delphi
application  that  analyzes  the  lexicon  and  the  syntax  of  a  sentence  in  Romanian  We  used a
Chomsky normal form CNF grammar Chomsky 1965
2 USING THE DEFINITE CLAUSE GRAMMARS
In order for our grammar not to generate incorrect sentences we should use the notions of gender
number  case etc specifying  for  example  that  femeie  and  frumoas have  the  feminine
gender  and  the singular  number The  string  El  iubete  ea  is  incorrect  because  ea  is  in
nominative case and we should use the pe preposition in order to obtain the accusative case
The correct phrase is El iubete pe ea or evenEl o iubete pe ea He loves her
If we take into account the case grammar is no longer independent from the context it is not true
that any NP is equal to any other NP irrespective of the context Nevertheless if we want to work
with a grammar that is independent from the context we may split the category NP into two NPN
and NPA  in  order  to  represent  verbal  groups  in  the nominative  subjective  respectively
accusative  objective case  We  shall  also  have  to  split  the  category Pron into  two  categories
PronN including El and PronA including pe ea her which contains the preposition pe
in front of the pronoun ea Russel  Norvig 2002
Another  issue  concerns  the  agreement  between  the  subject  and  main  verb  of  the  sentence
predicate For example if Eu I is the subject then Eu iubesc I love is grammatically
correct whereas Eu iubete I loves is not Then we shall have to split NPN and NPA into
several alternatives in order to reach the agreement As we identify more and more distinctions
we eventually obtain an exponential number
A  more  efficient  solution  is  to  improve augment  the  existing  grammar  rules  by  using
parameters  for  non-terminal  categories  The  categories NP and Pron have  parameters called
gender number and case The rule for the NP has as arguments the variables gender number and
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
This formalism of improvement is called definite clause grammar DCG because each grammar
rule may be interpreted as a definite clause in Horns logic Pereira  Warren 1980 Giurca
Using adequate predicates a CFG context free grammar rule as S  NP VP will be written in
the form of the definite clause NPs1 VPs2  Ss1s2 with the meaning that if s1 is NP s2 is
VP then the concatenation of s1 with s2 is S DCGs allow us to see parsing as a logical inference
Klein  2005 The  real  benefit  of  the  DCG  approach  is  that  we  can  improve  the  symbols  of
categories with additional arguments for example the rule NPgender Ngender turns into the
definite  clause Ngender s1 cid222
NPgender s1  meaning  that  if s1 is  a noun with  the  gender
gender  then s1 is also  a noun  phrase with the  same gender  Generally  we  may  supplement  a
symbol  of  category  with  any  number  of  arguments  and  the  arguments  are  parameters  that
constitute  the  subject  of  unification  like  in  the  common inference of Horns clauses Russel 
Norvig 2002
Even with the improvements brought by DCG incorrect sentences may still be overgenerated In
order deal with the correct verbal groups in some situations we shall have to split the category V
into two subcategories one for the verbs with no object and one for the verbs with a single object
and so on Thus we shall have to specify which expressions groups may follow each verb that
is  realize  a  subcategorization  of  that  verb  by  the  list  of  objects  An  object  is  a  compulsory
expression that follows the verb within a verbal group
Because there are a lot of problems in dealing with the syntactic analysis or a phrase the time of
the  processing  the  complex  situations  of  the  texts  in  Romanian  language  describing  real life
situations we decided to use some morphological characteristic features of the Romanian words
that can be useful in order to determine the parts of the sentences
2 THE IDEA  FOR  SYNTACTIC  ANALYSIS  BASED  ON  MORPHOLOGICAL
CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE LANGUAGE
As  we  explain  in  the  introduction  the  classic  ideas of  syntactic  analysis  uses lexicons
dictionaries CFG or DCG grammars and chart-parsers as that developed by  us in Ptru 
Boghian 2010
In the previous sections we note the following
1 Using  a  CFG  grammar  syntactically  correct  sentences  in  Romanian  are  accepted  as
well as incorrect ones
2 The power of the analysis system for example a chart-parser based on such a grammar
depends on the extent of the vocabulary used
3 The  power  of  a  chart-parser can  be  improved  using DCG  grammars  This  implies  to
extent the set of the syntactic rules with a lot of new rules using special variables like
gender case number etc
As  concerns  the  first and  the  last issues  let  us  assume  that  the  system  will  not  be  required  to
analyze incorrect  sentences  therefore  we  consider  the  grammar  satisfactory  Regarding  the
second problem it could be solved by strongly enriching the vocabulary a fact that would require
the elaboration and implementing of some data structures and searching techniques as efficient as
possible  which  however  will  not  function  in  real  time  in  some  cases  Of  course  the  main
problem  would  be  to  write as  comprehensive  a  grammar  as  possible  close  to  the  linguistic
realities  of  Romanian  morphology  taking  into  consideration  the  diversity  of  forms  and
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
meanings that a sentence can get in the Romanian language However the extent and complexity
of grammar leads to slowing the analysis therefore this will not be done in real-time in all cases
In this section we will suggest a real-time solution based on the idea of using
some words or groups of words that indicate grammatical category
some specific endings of the inflected words that indicate some parts of sentence
Our idea is based on some characteristics of the Romanian language where some prepositions or
some specific endings can provide us a lot of information about the structure of a complex phrase
Such characteristics  can be found in other languages too such as  French Using our ideas we
developed a system that uses a special grammar which we will explain
The morphology of the Romanian language allows the developing of a special syntactic analysis
that  makes  full  use  of  certain  characteristics  of  words  when  they  are inflected  declined  or
conjugated or under different hypostases
With  a  view  to  understanding  a  Romanian  sentence  to  finding  the  constituent  parts  which
would favor the  translation  of  the  sentence  into  another  language  in  real  time  we  suggest  a
simple solution based on patterns
there is a minimal vocabulary of key words prefixes1 linking words endings
a relatively limited grammar is realized in which the terminals are some words either with
given endings or from another given vocabulary
the user is asked to respect some restrictions of sentence word order relatively a few
the user is assumed to be well meaning
In Figure 2 it is presented the general scheme for such an analyzer Ptru  Boghian 2012
In Figure 2 we select the concrete case of the sentence Copii cei cumini au recitat o poezie
prinilor  n  faa  colii  The  good  children  recited  a  poem  to  their  parents  in  front  of  the
school
In stage 2 predicate nouns and adjectives are identified introduced by pronouns or prepositions
direct  or  indirect  objects  inarticulate  used  without  an  article  introduced  by  articles
prepositions  and  prepositional  phrases  respectively  adverbials  in  stage  3  articled  direct  and
indirect objects are identified etc
Following the logic of processes within the analyzer we notice that the final result that is correct
in  our  case  up  to  an  additional  detailing  is  approximate  because  the  system  is  based  on  the
observations made by us which are
In Romanian the subject usually precedes the predicate copiii the children before au
recitat recited
 There are some words or groups of words that we call prefixes or indicators that introduce
adverbials n faa in front of  place adverbial fiindc because din cauz
c  cause adverbial pentru a for purpose adverbial
 The predicate nouns the adjectives and the objects direct and indirect can be introduced by
indicating prefixes lui Ion Gheorghe etc to  indirect object or predicate noun
1 by prefixes we understand words or groups of words having the role to indicate the sense of the next
words from the phrase
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
o  fat  girl  pisic  cat  etc  a    direct  object  if  these  have  not  been
already identified as subject Thus it is to assume that we will say un biat citete o carte
a boy is reading a book and not o carte e ceea ce citete un biat or o carte este citit
de un biat a book is that which a boy is reading or a book is being read by a boy
therefore the subject precedes the object
Some  endings  offer  sufficient  information  about  the  nature  of  the  respective  words  in  the
word prinilor the ending -ilor indicates an indirect object2 just like -ei from fetei
mamei  indicates  the  same  type  of object  the  -ul  from  biatul  creionul  indicate
however a direct object articled
Figure 2 Stages of the analysis
We  thus  notice  that  our  sentence  recognized  by  an analyzer of  the  type  presented  above  is
structurally complex enough as compared to the famous orice brbat iubete o femeie any
man loves a woman given as an example for classic chart-parsers
It should also be noted that the sentence I o i pe M deoarece M e f J l M because M i b
could be recognized by the analyzer on the basis of the pattern
subiect predicat pe complement direct deoarece circumstanial de cauz
subject predicateon direct objectbecause cause adverbial
Thus the above sentence although meaningless in Romanian would enter the same category
as Ion o iubete pe Maria deoarece Maria este frumoas John loves Mary because Mary is
beautiful a category represented by the pattern mentioned above
2 Of course prinilor could be an indirect object as well as a predicative noun like in the sentence the
good  children  recited  the  poems  of  their  parents  in  front  of  the  school  copiii  cei  cumini  au  recitat
poeziile  prinilor  n  faa  colii  therefore  frequently  not  even  grammar  can  solve  the  systems
ambiguities
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
3 CREATING AND CONSULTING A DATABASE
Of course by introducing more such sentences phrases the user can create a table in a database
with the structure of a sentence therefore each entry would contain the fields subject predicate
predicative noun direct object indirect object place adverbial etc The detailed structure of the
table is presented in section 5 when we will discuss about the DIASEXP shystem we developed
Consulting such a database would be made through Romanian interrogative sentences phrases
for example
 Cine  predicat  complement  direct  
Cine  citete  cartea  
predicatedirect object Who is reading the book
in  order  to  find  out  the  subject  using  a  search  engine  based  on  pattern-matching  matching
patterns  in  which  the  search  clues  would  be  the  predicate  is  reading and  also  the  direct
object book
Although the results of the analysis and by this the answers to the questions also have a high
degree  of  precision  that  depends  on  respecting  the  word  order  restrictions  imposed  by  the
vocabulary taken into consideration such a system that we have realised and that works in real
time can be successfully used Moreover the system realised by us may enrich through learning
its vocabulary so that by using only the 300 initial words and endings it may cover a wide range
of situations

Figure 3 A grammar for Romanian based on morphological characteristics
It is to be noted that the adverbs used are the general ones and the adjectives are those most
frequently used in common speech Also please note that by  we noted the concatenation of
two words fete  lor  fetelor This concatenation can be influenced in some cases by a
phonemic alternance like in fateifetei where we have the phonemic alternance a
see Ptru 2010 for details
4 DIASEXP
Using  the  grammar  from  the  previous  section  we  developed  the  DIASEXP system  DIASEXP
have  a  simple  text  interface  where  the  user  can  introduce  different  phrases  describing  some
knowledge about some real life events This collection of phrases is recorded as a story Each
phrase  of  the  story  is  analyzed  by  the  system  which  will  automatically  detect  the  parts  of  the
sentence and will add these into a table with the following fields
1 Subject  this will represent the simple subject of the sentence a noun or a pronoun see
rules 4 and 37 in Figure 3
2 Attribsub  this will be the attribute of the subject it can be for example an adjective
see rules 9 and 12 in the same figure
3 Predicate  the predicate of the sentence will represent the main action of the assertive
sentence the predicate can be represented by a normal verb or the copulative verb a fi
to be which will be folowed by a predicative noun nume predicativ - see rules 38
and 39
4 Dirobj  the direct object or the predicative noun see rules 7 13 21 and 34
5 Attributedo  this will be the attribute of the direct object see rules 7 10 12 and 28
Indirobj  the indirect object see rules 8 14 22 and 35
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 1 No4 December 2012
7 Attributeio  this  will  be  the  attribute  of  the  indirect  object  the  attributes  will  be
represented by adejectives or by some prepositional phrases  see rules 81112 and 28
8 Where  this will be the place adverbial see rules 3 6 15 23 and 30
9 When  this will be the time adverbial see rules 3 6 16 24 and 31
10 How  this will be the manner adverbial see rules 3 6 17 25 and 32
11 Goal  this will be the goal adverbial it will be the answer at the question Pentru ce
For what see rules 3 6 18 and 26
12 Why  this will be the cause adverbial see rules 3 6 19 and 27
When DIASEXP isnt sure about which part of the sentence a word is it will ask the user with
two or three variants and the user will indicate the correct version The next time in a similar
situation DIASEXP will know the answer and it will not ask again However the use of commas
will be very helpful in order to avoid the ambiguities
After entering some assertive sentences the user can  enter some interrogative  sentences  When
the user will ask something DIASEXP it will answer consulting the assertive sentences it known
by that moment
Below Table 1 you can find an example of a story from a dialogue between DIASEXP and a
human user The assertive sentences are prefixed by A the interogative sentences are prefixed by
I and the DIASEXPs answers are prefixed by R In the right column the English translation is
presented

5 CONCLUSIONS
CFG  and  DCG  are  types  of  generative  grammars  used  in  the  syntactic  analysis  of  a  phrase  in
natural  language  Sometimes  long  or  complex  phrases  will  be  a  problem  for  the  classic  chart-
parsers The characteristic features of the Romanian language related to the morphology of words
or the way in which adverbials are formed can be successfully used in the syntactic analysis by
using  a  system  based  on  patterns This  system  will  work  in  real-time  and  will  not  record  the
whole dictionary of Romanian language It will use a small dictionary of prefixes prepositions
adverbs etc and some endings and linking words
