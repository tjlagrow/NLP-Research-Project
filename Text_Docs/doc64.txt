Abstract The motivations and the status of the K20 survey are presented The rst
results on the evolution of massive galaxies and the comparison with the predictions
of the currently competing scenarios of galaxy formation are also discussed
1 Introduction
 1011 M is im-
Understanding the evolution of massive galaxies eg Mstellar
portant because to constrain the dierent scenarios of structure and galaxy for-
mation In particular the question on the formation of the present-day massive
spheroidals is still one of the most debated issues of galaxy evolution see 1 for
a review In one scenario massive spheroidals are formed at early cosmological
epochs eg z  3 through a short and intense episode of star formation with
SF R  100  1000 Myr1 followed by a passive evolution or pure luminosity
evolution PLE of the stellar population to nowadays In marked contrast the
hierarchical scenarios predict that massive spheroidals are the product of rather
recent merging of pre-existing disk galaxies taking place mostly at lower redshifts
and with moderate star formation rates 23 In hierarchical merging scenarios
 1 are
fully assembled massive eld spheroidals with Mstellar
very rare objects 4 see also Baugh this volume
 1011 M at z 
From an observational point of view a direct way to test the above scenarios
is to study the evolution of massive galaxies by means of spectroscopic surveys
of eld galaxies selected in the K-band 5678 Since the near-IR light is a
good tracer of the galaxy mass94 K-band imaging allows to select massive
galaxies at high-z A galaxy with a stellar mass of about 1011 M is expected
to have 18  K  20 for 1  z  2 4 thus implying that moderately deep K-
band surveys can eciently select massive galaxies in that redshift range Deep
spectroscopy with 8-10m class telescopes can then be used to search for massive
systems and to constrain their redshift distribution

21 The observations and the database
In order to investigate the evolution of massive galaxies and to constrain the
currently competing galaxy formation scenarios we started in 1999 a project
that was called K20 survey For such a project 17 nights were allocated to
our team in the context of an ESO VLT Large Program distributed over a period
of two years 1999-2000 see also httpwwwarcetriastroitk20
The prime aim of such a survey is to derive the redshift distribution of about
550 K-selected objects with Ks  20 The targets were selected from a 322
arcmin2 area of the Chandra Deep Field South CDFS 10 using the images
from the ESO Imaging Survey public database EIS httpwwwesoorg
scienceeis the raw Ks-band images were reduced and calibrated by our
group  and from a 198 arcmin2 eld centered at 0055-269 using NTTSOFI
Ks-band imaging Fontana et al in preparation
Optical multi-object spectroscopy was made with the ESO VLT UT1 and
UT2 equipped with FORS1 October-November 1999 and FORS2 November
2000 during 05-15 seeing conditions and with 07-12 wide slits depending
on the seeing The grisms 150I 200I 300I were used with typical integration
times of 1-3 hours Dithering of the targets along the slits between two xed
positions was made for most observations in order to eciently remove the CCD
fringing and the strong OH sky lines at obs  7000 A The spectra were cal-
ibrated using standard spectrophotometric stars dereddened for atmospheric
extinction corrected for telluric absorptions and scaled to the total R-band
magnitudes A small fraction of the K20 sample was observed with near-IR
spectroscopy using the VLT UT1ISAAC in order to derive the redshifts of
the galaxies which were too faint for optical spectroscopy andor expected to
be in a redshift range for which no strong features fall in the observed optical
spectral region eg 15  z  20 However due to the lack of a multi-object
spectroscopy mode in ISAAC it turned out very hard and inecient to obtain
redshifts of faint galaxies in this manner which was successful only for a few
galaxies at 13  z  19 with strong H in emission
In addition to spectroscopy U BV RIzJKs imaging is also available for both
elds thus providing the possibility to estimate photometric redshifts for all the
objects in the K20 sample to calibrate them through a comparison with the
spectroscopic redshifts and to assign reliable photometric redshifts to the objects
for which it was not possible to derive the spectroscopic z see Fontana et al
these proceedings
The spectroscopic observations were completed in December 2000 The spec-
tral analysis was done by means of automatic software IRAF rvidlines and
xcsao and through visual inspection of the 1D and 2D spectra Because of
four nights lost due to the bad weather only 94 of the sample with Ks 
20 could be observed The eciencies in deriving the specroscopic redshifts
for the observed targets was high Nidentif iedNobserved95 93 91 for
Ks  190 195 200 respectively The overall spectroscopic redshift com-
pleteness is still rather high with Nidentif iedNtotal93 91 85 for Ks 
190 195 200 respectively where Ntotal  Nobserved Nunobserved The size of
Massive galaxies in the K20 survey
the sample the spectroscopic redshift completeness and the availability of tested
and reliable photometric redshifts make the K20 sample one of the largest and
most complete database to study the evolution of K-selected galaxies available
to date
22 The scientic aims
Kaumann  Charlot 1998 estimated that  60 and  10 of the galaxies
in a K  20 sample are expected to be at z  1 respectively in a PLE and
in a standard CDM hierarchical merging model cf their Fig 4 Such a large
dierence was in fact one of the main motivations of our original proposal to
undertake a redshift survey for all objects down to K  20 However more re-
cent models consistently show that the dierence between the predictions is less
extreme than in the KC98 realization Menci et al Pozzetti et al Somerville
et al in preparation Part of the eect is due to the now favored CDM cos-
mology which pushes most of the merging activity at earlier times compared to
 CDM and SCDM models and therefore get closer to the PLE case Moreover
a dierent tuning of the star-formation algorithms to accomodate for more star
formation at high z also reduces the dierences between the two scenarios Our
database is currently being used to perform a stringent comparison between the
observed redshift distribution and the ones predicted by the most recent models
of galaxy formation Cimatti et al in preparation
Besides the main goal described here above our unique database is also being
used to address other important questions on galaxy evolution 1 the evolution
of the Luminosity and Mass Functions see Pozzetti et al this volume 2 the
evolution of ellipticals 3 the fraction of dusty starbursts and high-z ellipticals
in the ERO population 4 the evolution of galaxy clustering see Daddi et
al this volume 5 the spectral properties of a large number of galaxies and
their evolution as a function of redshift 6 the volume star formation density
using dierent indicators 7 the fraction of AGN in K-selected samples 8
the brown dwarf population at high Galactic latitude
3 First results on Extremely Red Objects
A fraction of the galaxies selected in the near-infrared show very red colors
eg R  K  5 Such galaxies are known as Extremely Red Objects EROs
and the most recent surveys demonstrated that they form a substantial eld
population 111213 Since their colors are consistent with being either old
passively evolving galaxies or dusty starbursts or AGN it is therefore of prime
importance to determine their nature in order to exploit the stringent constraints
that EROs can place on the galaxy formation scenarios In this section we adopt
a cosmology with H0  70 km s1 Mpc1 m  03 and   07
From our total Ks  20 sample 78 EROs with R  Ks  50 were extracted
About 70 of the EROs with R Ks  50 and Ks  192 was spectroscopically
identied with old and dusty star-forming galaxies at 07  z  15 14 The two

passively evolving top zmean  1000 and dusty star-forming EROs bottom

classes are about equally populated and for each of them we derived the average
spectrum Fig 1
Old EROs have an average spectrum consistent with being old passively
evolving ellipticals and it can be well reproduced with Bruzual  Charlot 2000
spectral synthesis models with no dust extinction and ages 
 3 Gyr if Z  Z
thus implying an average formation redshift zf
 24 for such a metallicity
The average spectrum of star-forming EROs can be reproduced only if a
substantial dust extinction is introduced typically in the range of 05  EB 
V   1 Their star formation rates corrected for the average reddening suggest
a signicant contribution 20 of EROs to the cosmic star-formation density
at z1 However the detection of NeV3426 emission suggests that a fraction
of star-forming EROs also host some AGN activity obscured by dust

Fig 2 Comparison between the observed density of old EROs with the predictions
of PLE models see 14 for more details The range of observed density of old EROs
with Ks  192 is shown with a vertical bar ranging from the minimum observed den-
sity 32 of the total density of EROs observed in the K20 survey and the maximum
possible density 64 of the total density of EROs assuming that all the spectroscop-
ically unidentied EROs are old passive systems The dashed and solid lines show
the predictions of PLE models adopting respectively the local luminosity function of
ellipticals 17 and of early-type galaxies 2MASS 18 and using Bruzual  Charlot
spectral synthesis models with solar metallicity Salpeter IMF e-folding time of the
star formation  03 Gyr and a set of formation redshifts zf  See also 19 for more
details on PLE models The arrows indicate the predicted densities of EROs in two
recent hierarchical merging models the Somerville et al model shown in Firth et al
2001 and the Cole et al 2000 model presented in Smith et al 2001 Since such mod-
els predict the total density of all EROs ie old  dusty star-forming they actually
represent upper limits to the predicted density of old passive systems
Andrea Cimatti
Since old EROs have spectra consistent with being passively evolving ellipti-
cals we compared their density with dierent model predictions see Fig 2 The
main result is that the density of old EROs observed in our survey is strongly
underpredicted by the current hierarchical merging models a factor of 410
for the models presented by 15 and 16 respectively On the other hand PLE
models with a reasonable choice of input parameters predict surface and co-
moving densities in agreement with the observations and imply that massive
spheroidals formed at zf  2  3 see 14 for more details
Since the luminosities and the stellar masses of the observed old EROs are in
the range of 05-4L and 1-61011 M this means that fully assembled massive
systems were already in place up to z  13
The existence of such galaxies with a comoving density of 
 2  104 Mpc3
at z  1 14 is in contrast with the CDM hierarchical model of 20 where
the comoving density of all galaxy types with M 1011 M is about one order of
magnitude lower whereas the dierence is less dramatic with the model of 21
see Fig 1 of 22
