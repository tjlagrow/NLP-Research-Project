CLUES ON THE EVOLUTION OF CLUSTER GALAXIES FROM THE
ANALYSIS OF THEIR ORBITAL ANISOTROPIES
A Biviano1 P Katgert2 T Thomas2 A Mazure3
We study the evolution of galaxies in clusters
by the analysis of a sample of  3000 galax-
ies members of 59 clusters from the ESO
Nearby Abell Cluster Survey ENACS Kat-
gert et al 1998 for which redshifts R-band
magnitudes as well as morphologies are avail-
able Thomas 2003 Biviano et al 2002 B02
hereafter and references therein
In order to make the most ecient use of our
data we combine the 59 clusters into a single ensem-
ble cluster as described in B02 In the ensemble clus-
ter after excluding galaxies in substructures we nd
that there are 4 cluster galaxy populations that must
be distinguished because they have dierent phase-
space distributions i the brightest ellipticals with
MR  22 using H0  100 km sec1Mpc1 ii
the other ellipticals together with the S0 galaxies we
refer to this class as E  S0 hereafter iii the early
spirals SaSb and iv the late spirals and irregu-
lars ScIr together with the emission-line galaxies
ELGs
About 23 of all cluster galaxies outside sub-
structures belong to the E  S0 class The shape of
the E  S0 velocity distribution indicates that these
galaxies move on nearly isotropic orbits   0 see
also van der Marel et al 2000 We can therefore
use E  S0 as isotropic tracers of the cluster gravita-
tional potential We solve the Abel and Jeans equa-
tions see eg Binney  Tremaine 1987 using both
a direct non-parametric approach and the inverse
method described by van der Marel 1994 We nd
that a NFW Navarro Frenk  White 1997 mass
prole with rsr200  025015
010 68 condence lim-
its provides a very good t to our data We use this
mass prole to estimate the anisotropy proles for
the other three cluster galaxy populations using the
method of Solanes  Salvador-Sole 1990
We do not nd any acceptable solution for the
brightest ellipticals most likely because these galax-
ies do not full the conditions for the applicability of

the collisionless Jeans equations As a matter of fact
the brightest ellipticals mostly sit at the bottom of
the cluster potential well and move very slowly if at
all B02 They have probably been slowed down by
dynamical friction and could have grown by mergers
of other massive galaxies Brough et al 2002
We do nd acceptable solutions for the early spi-
rals We cannot exclude fully isotropic orbits for
these galaxies but the data taken at face value in-
dicate that in the inner cluster region they move
on radially-anisotropic orbits   06
there is evidence that these galaxies evolve into S0s
Thomas  Katgert 2003 it is possible that the
early spirals that are still visible near the cluster
center are those that have managed to avoid trans-
formation by the amplitude and direction of their
velocities
We also nd acceptable solutions for the class
of late spirals  ELGs The anisotropy is close to
zero in the center but there are not many galaxies
if any of this class there For radii  05 r200 the
anisotropy grows almost linearly reaching   06 at
a radius  15 r200 which is the limit of our observa-
tional data Such an anisotropy prole suggests that
the late spirals  ELGs are eld galaxies infalling
into the cluster The lack of these galaxies in the
central cluster region suggests that they get trans-
formed into dwarf galaxies or destroyed once they
reach the high density central regions of the clusters
