ABSTRACT
We present preliminary results on galactic Dark Matter DM halo structure
and galaxy evolution We show how during the rst Gyr of the evolution of a
1010M dwarf elliptica feed-back from stars SN and stellar winds leads to an
extended constant density isothermal core with radius of 015 the virial radius
R200 We also present rst results on galaxy merging as a possibile scenario to
form ellipticals studying in particular how the details of the merging evolution
vary as a function of the mass ratio of the interacting galaxies
1 Introduction
Numerical N-body and gasdynamical simulations have become a major tool to
investigate how galaxies formed and evolved Massively parallel computers like Cray
T3D or T3E supercomputers have allowed to run high resolution simulations of large
scale structure formation VIRGO or GIF projects leading to impressive results on
the distribution of DM in dierent cosmological scenarios Jenkins et al 1997
On galaxy scales Navarro et al 1996a showed that galactic DM halos should
follow a universal density prole In other words the violent collisionless dynamical
relaxation processes during the formation of DM halos lead to equilibrium proles
with similar shapes independent of the halo mass the initial density uctuation
spectrum and the adopted cosmological model
However recent studies Persic et al 1996 Burkert  Silk 1997 have found
evidence in real galaxies of signicant departures from this universal prole both in
the inner and in the outer galactic regions

Figure 1 Time evolution of the DM density prole
In particular the presence of extended DM cores seems to be a rm result The
occurence and the development of cores with costant density is not yet completely
understood It has been suggested that the discrepancy between observations and
Cold Dark Matter CDM predictions could be solved by assuming secular processes
in the baryonic component which may also aect the innermost halo regions An
analytic approach used by Navarro et al 1996b has suggested that such processes
might produce core only in low mass galaxies
In this contribution we present a fully Nbody simulation of the formation of a
dwarf elliptical galaxy to investigate whether baryonic feedback can actually be the
cause of the cores developments
Tothis aim we use our own TreeSPH code for details see Carraro et al 1997 and
Lia et al 1998
2 DM haloes of Ellipticals
Bertola et al 1993 using the gaseous components rotation curve of the gas for
a sample of giant ellipticals showed that the halos surrounding elliptical galaxies
have characteristics similar to those of the spiral halos In particular the DM density
prole in the inner region of the galaxies is similarly much atter than the baryons
Figure 2 Time evolution of the baryons density prole
prole the two proles intersecting at roughly the eective radius
In order to study the formation of the core we have considered a sperically sym-
metric virialized primordial galaxy of 1010M with a baryon fraction of 5 The
system is described by 8000 particle half in form of baryons and half in form of DM
Virialization is obtained by distributing dark particles according to a 1r density pro-
le with velocity components suitable to produce the velocity dispersion necessary
to support and stabilize the system Gas is set on the top of dark particles with the
same velocity components At this point cooling switches on and the gas falls in
towards the center forming stars The time evolutions of the DM prole and of the
baryon prole are shown in Figs 1 and 2 respectively the situation at the end of
the run is presented in Fig 3 DM open circles baryons lled circles
Looking at Figs 1-3 we clearly recognize that the DM density prole gets atter
developing a core radius of about 20 kpc this is similar to the eective radius as
obtained by tting the stars distribution to a Hernquist prole The baryons on the
contrary become more centrally concentrated producing a steeper prole
In order to investigate the origin of the core  we have plotted in Fig 4 the trend of
the halo concentration dened as 14 which is a measure of the core development
against the SFR at four epochs along the run There is a clear relation suggesting
that the dynamical feedback of star formation on the halo may be responsible for

the formation and development of the core  Work is in progress to see whether this
scenario is appropriate also for more massive galaxies
3 Galaxy Merging
Many theoretical studies and numerical simulations have supported the hypothesis
that the merging of two disk galaxies could be the dynamical process leading to
the formation of an elliptical galaxy On the observational side this hypothesys is
supported by the presence in many ellipticals of several photometric or kinematical
peculiarities like boxy or disky departures of the isophotes from an elliptical shape
counterrotating cores the presence of shells etc
In the simulations described here each galaxy is obtained from the adiabatic
collapse of a rotating gas plus sphere whith initial r1 density prole Each galaxy
consists of 1824 particles equally distribuited between gas and DM We let the system
evolve until virial equilibrium is reached Then we set the two galaxies along a
specied orbit one around the other
As noted by Toomre  Toomre 1972 the most interacting galaxies probably have
highly eccentric orbits and are coming together for the rst time only now so 0 
e  1 On the other hand a pair of galaxies in an extended distribution of dark
matter could be accelerated to a nearly hyperbolic encounter e  1 So a good
compromise between these two possibilities is to consider a parabolic orbit e  1
We assign the initial orbit in terms of the masses of the two galaxies of the eccentricity

e the aperture p and the initial anomaly  Then we calculate the initial velocities
and initial positions of the particles in the center of mass frame The parameters of
the two encounters in code units are summarized in Table 1
In the adopted coordinate system the orbital plane coincides with the XY plane
and the origin is in the center of mass of the two galaxies The galaxies move about
each other in a counterclockwise direction and the encounters are direct
In encounter A Fig 5 the two galaxies have the same mass M1M205 in code
units The two galaxies approach for the rst time at t  15 but then go far apart
departing from the initial keplerian orbit After the rst approach the gas of each
galaxy exhibits the eects of tidal stripping in the form of moderate tails opposit to
the sense of motion Around t  45 the two galaxies approach for the second time

t  78
Encounter B Fig 6 is slower than encounter A Galaxy 1 mass 09 remains
quite stationary while galaxy 2 with a lower mass orbits around galaxy 1 There is
a close encounter around t  26 then the two galaxies go far apart After the rst
encounter galaxy 2 continues its motion around galaxy 1 until it merges at around
t  130 It is interesting to notice that the gas of galaxy 2 is more spread out during
the encounter B than during the encounter A
4 Conclusions
This paper is a report on two ongoing projects in Galaxy Formation Within the
context of the monolithic collapse scenario we have proposed a possible explanation
for the formation of a DM core in a dwarf elliptical emphasising the role of secular
processes related to stellar feedback In the context of the merging scenario for the
formation of ellipticals we have presented preliminary results on the merging of two
spiral-like galaxies for two cases with dierent mass ratios
