The binding of basic fibroblast growth factor FGF-2 to its cell surface receptor CSR 
and  subsequent  signal  transduction  is  known  to  be  enhanced  by  Heparan  Sulfate 
Proteoglycans HSPGs HSPGs  bind FGF-2 with  low affinity  and  likely  impact CSR-
mediated signaling via stabilization of FGF-2-CSR complexes via association with both 
the ligand and the receptor What is unknown is whether HSPG associates with CSR in 
the absence of FGF-2  In this paper we determine conditions by which pre-association 
would  impact  CSR-FGF-2-HSPG  triad  formation  assuming  diffusion-limited  surface 
reactions Using mean-field rate equations we show that i when HSPG is much higher 
than  CSR  the  presence  of  pre-formed  complexes  does  not  affect  the  steady  state of 
FGF-2  binding  and  ii  when  the  concentrations  are  comparable  the  presence  of  pre-
formed complexes substantially increases the steady state concentration of FGF-2 bound 
to CSR These findings are supported by explicit cellular automaton simulations which 
justify  the  mean-field  treatment  We  discuss  the  advantages  of  such  a  two-receptor 
system  compared  to  a  single  receptor  model  when  the  parameters  are  comparable  
Further  we  speculate  that  the  observed  high  concentration  of  HSPG  in  intact  cells 
HSPG  100CSR provides a way to ensure that the binding levels of FGF-2 to its 
signaling receptor remains high irrespective of the presence of pre-formed CSR-HSPG 
complexes on the cell surface while allowing the cell to finely tune the response to FGF-
2 via down-regulation of the signaling receptor

1 Introduction    
Growth factors play an important role in activating cellular processes and are critical for 
stimulating  the  proliferation  of  cells  critical  for  wound  healing  and  angiogenesis 
Typically growth factor activity is mediated by trans-membrane receptor proteins which 
transmit  the  chemical  signals  across  the  cell  membrane  For  many  receptors  signal 
transduction requires both ligand binding and receptor dimerization a process whereby 
two receptors either  interact directly or are brought within close proximity to facilitate 
cross-reactivity  or  interaction  with  intracellular  targets  Whether  dimerization  is 
exclusively ligand driven is still in question and may be dependent on the specific growth 
factor-receptor system 
While  receptor  dimerization  appears  to  be  a  common  paradigm  the  receptor  complex 
may  consistent  of  different  receptor  proteins    For  example  epidermal  growth  factor 
EGF  and  members  of  the  EGF  family  can  bind  and  activate  both  homo  and  hetero-
dimers of the EGF receptor subfamily which includes EGFR HER2 HER3 and HER4 
Hackel et al 1999  Basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF or FGF-2 activates a trans-
membrane  cell  surface  receptor  CSR  via  extra-cellular  binding  but  also  binds  to  the 
heparin  sulfate  glycosaminoglycan  chains  of  cell  surface  proteoglycans    Although  the 
interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans HSPGs is of lower affinity interaction 
with  these  ubiquitous  molecules  has  been  shown  to  stabilize  FGF-2-CSR  binding  and 
activation of CSR Nugent and Edelman 1992 Fannon Nugent 1996  Although there 
is still some controversy over the exact stoichiometry of the signaling complex the 222 
model  of  2  FGF-2  2-HSPGs  and  2-CSR  is  most  favored  Schlessinger  et  al  2000 
Plotnikov et al 1999  The existence of preassembled CSR dimmers in the absence of 
FGF-2 is unlikely although whether CSR-HSPG complexes exist is not known  There is 
evidence  that  heparin  and  HSPGs  can  bind  directly  with  the  CSR  Powell  2002 
McKeehan 1999 Kan 1999 making such complexes possible  In this paper we have 
focused  on  the  formation  of  the  FGF-2-CSR-HSPG  triad  given  that  this  is  likely  the 
precursor to the signaling oligomer as is postulated for FGF-1 Wu et al 2003    
The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  investigate  the  whether  CSR-HSPG  complexes  in  the 
absence  of  FGF-2  would  significantly  impact  formation  of  FGF-2-CSR-HSPG  triads   
Using  a  combination  of  mean-field  rate  equation  analysis  and  direct  numerical 
simulations  we  demonstrate  that  when  the  HSPG  concentration  on  the  cell  surface  is 
much  higher than that of  CSR as  is  normally  found reviewed  in Tumova 2000 the 
diffusion-limited surface reactions occur too fast as compared to the absorption of ligands 
from  the  bulk  In  this  case  the  presence  of  pre-formed  CSR-HSPG  complexes  makes 
little difference to the binding kinetics and the steady state The situation when HSPG 
 CSR is also similar except that the steady-state level of bound FGF-2 is then much 
lower compared to the previous case However pre-formed complexes become relevant 
when the ratio of these two concentrations is within a narrow range typically 1-10 In 
this  regime  the  surface  reactions  are  considerably  slowed  down  due  to  the  two-
dimensional  nature  of  the  cell  surface  and  so  the  presence  of  pre-formed  complexes 
significantly  increases  the  steady-state  level  of  FGF-2  bound  to  CSR  These  results 
suggest a rationale for why the low-affinity receptor HSPG is present on the cell surface 
at such high concentrations as compared to the signaling receptor CSR It might also be 
noted that still higher levels of HSPG could actually decrease the binding levels since 
they could trap too much FGF-2 thus preventing their association with CSR 
Finally we stress in this paper that dimerization of receptors is a general phenomena and 
although  the  paper  focuses  on  the  FGF-2  system  the  results  are  generalizable    We 
present  results  for  the  12  growth  factorCSR  system  such  as  platelet-derived  growth 
factor PDGF reviewed in Claesson-Welch 2000 and growth hormone GH reviewed 
in Frank 2002 and other factors  
2 Mathematical modeling 
1 Cellular automaton model of the FGF-2-CSR-HSPG system 
We  have  constructed  a  simple  cellular  automaton  model  of  the  FGF-2-CSR-HSPG 
system  
The  model  assumes  that  CSR  and  HSPG  are  distributed  randomly  on  the  two-
dimensional cell surface with starting concentrations 
0P  respectively The basic 
idea is to divide the cell surface into a grid array A state index is then assigned to each 
site  of  this  two-dimensional  lattice  taking  different  values  depending  on  whether  the 
lattice site is vacant or occupied by either a CSR or an HSPG molecule A CSR molecule 
can be in three different states free R bound to FGF-2  R  bound to HSPG  R   or 
bound  to  both  FGF-2  and  HSPG   R    An  HSPG  molecule  can  be  in  two  additional 
states free P or bound to FGF-2  P  Thus altogether there are seven different states 
possible for a single lattice site  
The  dynamics  of  the  model  take  place  at  two  stages  the  absorption  of  FGF-2  from 
solution and the consequent binding and dissociation processes and the various surface 
reaction processes for example a FGF-2-bound CSR combines with a HSPG and forms a 
triad Our first simplifying assumption is to treat the absorption of ligands from the bulk 
and the consequent binding to CSR and HSPG as an effective stochastic process ie we 
do not study the diffusion of the ligand molecules in the solution explicitly Rather for a 
  binding of FGF-2  onto R and P are  modeled as  first-
certain  ligand  concentration 
order stochastic processes with time-independent rates as follows 
The dissociation events are also described in a similar way 
     with   probability

  and 
onk  represents the association rate of FGF-2 and CSR 
In the above 
 is assumed to be independent of time That is we assert 
The bulk ligand concentration 
that the concentration of  ligands  is sufficiently  high so that depletion of  ligands  in the 
solution is negligible The local fluctuations in the ligand concentration in space and time 
are neglected henceforth Similarly 
onk  is the association rate of FGF-
2 and HSPG The association rates 
and    used  in our simulations were  measured experimentally  by  Nugent and Edelman 
1992 and are listed in Table 1 
The  second-order  rate  constants  for  the  surface  reactions  however  have  not  been 
measured There are three surface reactions to consider here The first two are  
which are the triad-forming reactions The third surface reaction we consider is  
whereby  direct  interaction  between  CSR  and  HSPG  leads  to  the  formation  of  a  pre-
formed  hetero-dimer  even  in  the  absence  of  FGF-2  In  the  absence  of  experimental 
measurements we assume that all these reactions are diffusion-limited so that the rate 
  The subscript D represents the diffusion 
constant are the same which we denote by   D
coefficient of large proteins on the cell surface which we assume identical for all species 
on the cell surface and indicates that the reactions are diffusion-limited In Appendix A 
we  show  how  this  coefficient  can  be  determined  in  the  framework  of  Smoluchowski 
theory The typical value of D for a membrane molecule is on the order of 
Kucik et al 1999 
The last reaction we consider is the dissociation of the pre-formed complex into CSR and 
We denote the dissociation constant for this reaction by g There exist no experimental 
measurements  of  this  rate  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge  Along  with  the  diffusive 
  g determines the fraction of CSR in the pre-formed CSR-HSPG state 
association rate D
before ligand absorption and features as a crucial control parameter in our computations 
This calculation of this fraction which we denote by 
 is detailed in Appendix B  


Our  approach  here  is  two-fold  In  the  following  subsection  we  further  simplify  our 
treatment  by  neglecting  the  spatial  variation  in  the  concentrations  of  all  species  This 
leads to a set of first-order mean-field rate equations for the average concentrations of all 
quantities From the rate equations we derive the relations between all the steady-state 
concentrations which are then solved either analytically or numerically  
We  construct  a  mean-field  steady  state  diagram  of  the  system  where  we  identify  the 
regimes  where  the  majority  of  FGF-2-bound  CSR  is  in  either  triad  state  or  binary-
complex state The parameters that we use in the construction of this state diagram are i 
the ligand concentration ii the ratio of HSPG to CSR n
  iii the absorption 
  The last subsection presents results of 
rate of FGF-2 and iv the surface reactivity  
direct numerical simulation of the cellular automaton model at a few key points in the 
steady state diagram The results of the simulations confirm the results of the mean-field 
analysis thus justifying the underlying assumptions The simulations also bring to light 
some interesting features in the kinetics of the model A brief discussion of these points 
will be the content of Sec 4 
 2 Mean-field rate equations 
The complete set of mean-field rate equations for the time evolution of the concentrations

We  shall  not  attempt  to  solve  these  dynamical  equations  analytically  or  numerically 
Rather our approach here is to first determine the steady-state values of these quantities 
0P  to 
by  putting  the  lhs  equal  to  zero  and  solving  the  resulting  non-linear  equations 
numerically which we shall do in the next section Our focus is to see how the steady-
state level of the stable complex  R   is affected by the initial concentration of the pre-
formed hetero-dimer  R   for different ratios of 
0R  After identifying the relevant 
range  of  concentration  we  run  direct  numerical  simulations  of  the  reaction-diffusion 
system to verify our predictions  For the sake of concreteness and ease of comparison 
with experimental data we work with FGF-2 concentrations of 055 nM or its multiples 
in powers of 10 throughout this paper 
3 Model results 
In this section we outline the main results of our model  
1 The steady state  
It is convenient to render the equations dimensionless by defining rescaled parameters via 
scaling all rates with 
  The rescaled variables are 







We also define normalized concentrations   
 denote the initial concentrations of CSR and HSPG 
respectively Throughout this paper we will work in the regime 
After applying these substitutions to eqns1-6 we arrive at the equivalent dimensionless 
set of equations

To find the steady state of this set of rate equations we put all time derivatives to zero 
This  yields  a  set  of  relations  between  the  various  concentrations  for  simplicity  of 
notation we shall not use distinct symbols for the steady-state concentrations From eqn 
6a we find 
                                                       7

Upon substituting eqns 7 8 and 9 into eqn 4a we arrive at

                                         11 

We  have  thus  expressed  all  the  concentrations  in  terms  of  just  two  variables  r  and  p 
There are two additional constraints that relate these two namely 
Eqn 11 is just the dimensionless version of the normalization relations 
In general eqns 7-11 could be solved numerically to find the steady-state values of all 
the  concentrations  However  before  proceeding  to  do  so  it  is  illuminating  to  study  a 
simpler version of the model Let us assume that the pre-formed complexes are absent in 
the model ie there is no coupling between CSR and HSPG in the absence of FGF-2 
This also  means that when a triad releases  FGF-2 back to the solution  both CSR and 
HSPG are liberated from the complex The simplified set of reactions describing these 
processes is

After substituting eqns 14 and 15 into eqn 16 and using the normalization 11 we 
arrive at 

pp1np


which  together  with  eqn13  implicitly  determines  r  and  hence  all  the  other 
concentrations We note that in eqn 17 the effective surface reaction rate is the product 
 n  This  means  that  for  such  two-receptor  systems  slow  surface  diffusion  is 
compensated by increasing the imbalance between the receptor concentrations and vice-
versa  
In general the expression for the steady state value of r in this simplified model also can 
only be solved numerically using eg the bisection method Press et al 1990 However 
explicit expressions for all concentrations may be obtained when the ligand concentration 
is sufficiently high such that the rates 
recall that these dimensionless 
  remains constant in 
rates are inversely proportional to 
   whence  we  obtain  the 
   and 
this  limit  because  both

  and therefore to L

 are  proportional  to L

   for large 
   the  concentration  of  the  simple  CSR-FGF-2 
We  see  that  for  fixed  n  and  large 
complexes  increases at the expense of the triad  CSR-FGF-2-HSPG This  is reasonable 
because at large ligand concentrations most of CSR and HSPG will be bound to FGF-2 
in  a  short time  so that there  is  no  appreciable  triad  formation  in  the  absence  of  pre-
formed  CSR-HSPG  complexes  However  if  this  ratio  n  also  increases  in  proportion 
  the triad concentration remains constant These observations are summarized in a 
   for  fixed  n  the 
steady  state  diagram  for  the  model  in  Fig1  Upon  increasing 
concentration of the  binary complex  FGF-2-CSR  increases at the expense of the triad 
eventually dominating it at sufficiently high ligand concentration We also see that as n 
increases  the  imbalance  in  the  reactants  makes  the  dynamics  more  favorable  to  triad 
formation  so  the  threshold  ligand  concentration  required  to  enter  the  binary  complex 
dominated regime also increases proportional to n  
It is instructive at this point to see what a similar steady state diagram would look like for 
a ligand-receptor system with only one type of receptor which we again designate as R 
Dimerization  of  a  single  receptor  type  in  the  absence  of  stabilizing  low  affinity 
receptors for growth factor activity is the paradigm for many growth factors  The mean-
field calculation for this simple system is very similar to the two-receptor case we have 
studied so far and has the advantage that the complete solution can be found explicitly 
again  in  the  absence  of  pre-formed  R-R  dimers  The  relevant  calculations  for  this 
model is presented in Appendix C 
The steady state diagram depicted in Fig 2 which follows from eqn C9 shows that the 
R-L-R triad complex is the dominant form for bound R at high values of the diffusion 
coefficient and low values of the ligand absorption rate For comparison we have also 
shown the corresponding diagram for the original CSR-FGF-2-HSPG system in the same 
figure  In  general  when  everything  else  is  the  same  the  threshold  value  of  surface 
reaction rate for dominance of the triad is seen to be lower for the two-receptor system 
and  is still  lowered as the  imbalance ratio n  is  increased It is thus seen that when the 
surface reactivity is small the two-receptor system can effectively compensate for it by 
   
increasing the ratio of HSPG
 to CSR It is also obvious that the threshold surface 
reactivity  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  initial  concentration  of  CSR  in  both  cases 
which simply follows from the dimensionless scaling form of  D
It is also interesting to look at the effect of changing the dissociation rates in the mean-
field steady state diagram This is most clearly seen for the simpler single-receptor model 
studied  in  Appendix  C  For  this  case  it  is  seen  from  eqn  C9  that  the  slope  of  the 
boundary  between triad-dominated and  binary-complex-dominated regimes  is  inversely 
proportional to the dissociation constant    This means that for higher    the boundary 
line  between  the  two  regimes  becomes  flatter  since  the  binary  complex  is  less  stable 
now  for  given  values  of     and 
     Thus  the  binary-complex-dominated  regime  is 
pushed  down  in  the  steady  state  diagram  Increasing  the  triad  dissociation  constant    
would reduce the triad concentration and  hence has the opposite effect At higher     
both  the  y-intercept  and  the  slope  of  the  boundary  becomes  larger  in  magnitude  thus 
pushing  the  triad-dominated  regime  upwards  in  the  steady  state  diagram  The 
mathematical expression of this behavior is easily seen from eqn C9 the y-intercept is 
proportional  to     whereas  the  slope  is  proportional  to   
    The  effects  of 
increasing the dissociation rates on the two-receptor system are similar Fig 3 
The insights obtained from studying the simplified no pre-formed complex version of 
the model leads us to conjecture on the role of pre-formed CSR-HSPG complexes which 
is the main purpose of this paper In general for both the single-receptor model and the 
CSR-FGF-2-HSPG  system  the  presence  of  pre-formed  CSR-CSR  for  single  receptor 
model  or  CSR-HSPG  for  two-receptor  model  complexes 
increases  the  triad 
concentration  and  hence  the  effect  of  such  pre-coupling  is  significant  only  at  the 
parameter values corresponding to the binary-complex-dominated regime of the steady 
state diagrams In this regime the presence of pre-formed complexes will boost the triad 
concentration  which  would  otherwise  be  small  This  is  exactly  what  we  find  from 
numerical solutions of the complete mean-field steady-state equations eqn 7-11 Fig4 
shows how the fraction of triads in the steady state varies with the fraction of CSR-HSPG 
complexes in initial state for two different ligand concentrations at n1 The effect of 
pre-formed  complexes  is  appreciable  only  at  ligand  concentrations  substantially  higher 
than typical experimental concentrations which are of the order of 1-10 nM In Fig5 
we show similar results but upon increasing HSPG keeping the ligand concentration 
and  CSR  fixed  In  this  case  we  find  that  the  effect  of  pre-formed  complexes  is 
noticeable only when n is sufficiently low  
To conclude this section the mean-field analysis has shown that pre-formed complexes 
are irrelevant to the system at low ligand concentrations andor high values of HSPG to 
CSR ratio These findings are supported through numerical simulations of the cellular 
automaton model to be discussed in the subsequent section  
2 Numerical simulations of the cellular automaton model 
We now proceed to our direct numerical Monte Carlo MC simulation of the full cellular 
LL  sites 
automaton CA  model We divide the cell surface  into a square lattice of 
The  lattice  spacing     is  fixed  as    of  the  mean  separation  between  two  HSPG 
molecules If

  is  the  typical  linear  dimension  of  the  cell  We  determine  the  initial 
concentration 
0R  using an estimate of the number of receptor proteins per cell which are 
approximately 15000 for the FGF-2 system we are modeling NugentEdelman 1992 
The dynamics of the model is defined as follows There are essentially two time scales in 
the problem The characteristic time of absorption of ligands from the bulk is of the order 
of  minutes  for typical  ligand concentrations used  in binding experiments On the other 
hand  the  characteristic  time  scale  of  surface  diffusion  is  the  typical  time  it  takes  for 
diffusion  of  one  molecule  to  another  which  is  of  the  order  of  one  lattice  spacing  as 
introduced above This time scale is thus given by 
which represents one Monte Carlo time step for surface diffusion and is the microscopic 
time scale in the problem 
Next we need to choose the time scale for adsorption of ligand molecules from the bulk 
solution For computational efficiency we would like to define a time scale sufficiently 
large so as to ensure a reasonable number of absorption events at every MC step At the 
same time this period should be sufficiently small so as to not exceed the microscopic 
  too much These considerations lead us to choose the time scale   such that 
time scale 
In the simulation of the model we implement the following procedure We measure time 
in units of    Thus at each time  step we update the state of every site  in the  lattice 
selected at random by attaching ligand molecules to CSR and HSPG occupied sites with 
certain probabilities For each such absorption time step we now perform 
steps of surface diffusion wherein one of the following events takes place We choose 
one lattice site randomly and select one of the neighboring sites also randomly The rules 
used for updating the state of each site are as follows 

                 23 
if the selected site is occupied and the chosen neighbor is vacant then the site 
exchanges its state with the neighbor diffusion 
if the site is occupied by CSR and the neighbor is occupied by FGF-2-HSPG 
then the CSR  is replaced  by  CSR-FGF-2-HSPG and the  neighbor becomes 
vacant reaction 
if this site is occupied by HSPG and the neighbor is occupied by FGF-2-CSR 
then the state of the neighbor is updated to CSR-FGF-2-HSPG and the site is 
now vacant reaction 
Following  N  diffusion  time  steps  we  perform  the  dissociation  events  now  which  are 
similar to the absorption events This completes one MC time step of the simulation All 
our  simulations  were  done  on  a  square  lattice  of  size  L256  with  periodic  toroidal 
boundary conditions The codes  for the simulations were written  in the FORTRAN 77 
programming language and the jobs were run on a Dell PC in a Linux environment For 
the  generation  of  the  random  numbers  we  used  the  ran2  subroutine  from  Numerical 
Recipes in Fortran Press et al 1990 Although the lattice size used is much smaller 
than  the  size  required  for  covering  the  typical  cell  area  judging  from  the  lattice  size 
chosen in eqn 21 we chose it for computational efficiency Moreover because of the 
local  imbalance  in  the  concentrations  of  reactants  in  our  model  typical  reaction  time 
scales  in  our  problem  are  much  larger  than  diffusion  time  scales  rendering  finite  size 
effects largely absent in our simulations 
We now proceed to discuss our numerical results The simulations were executed in the 
regime where the concentrations of CSR and HSPG are nearly equal When HSPG is 
very large compared to CSR the lattice spacing in the cellular automaton model is of 
the order of the typical diameter of these proteins In such a situation our simple model 
where  each  lattice  site  occupied  by  CSR  or  HSPG  absorbs  or  releases  FGF-2 
independent of the state of its neighbors is no longer valid  Most of the simulations we 
discuss below were done at ligand concentrations far higher than what is usually used in 
experiments   M   instead  of  nM  since  appreciable  effects  of  pre-formed  complexes 
were found only at these high ligand concentrations 
The numerical simulation data exhibits behavior qualitatively similar to that predicted by 
the mean-field steady state diagram Figs1 and 2  However the typical time scales in 
the simulation to reach the steady state levels was found to be far smaller than what was 
found in experiments We have included a discussion of this issue in the last section of 
the  paper  In  Fig  6  we  see  that  in  the  absence  of  direct  CSR-HSPG  interaction  the 
fraction  of  CSR  in  the  triad  state  increases  with  increasing  ligand  concentration 
However even for ligand concentrations up to 55   M four orders of magnitude higher 
than typical experimental values we do not enter the regime where the binary complex 
dominates  over  the  triad  One  explanation  for  this  behavior  could  be  that  in  the  real 
system the  local  imbalance  in the concentrations of FGF-2-CSR and HSPG drives the 
triad concentration to a steady-state level higher than that predicted by the mean-field rate 
equations  Of course it is also important to note that oligomerization of these triads to 
facilitate  CSR-CSR  cross-talk  would  also  impact  the  overall  dynamics  of  the 
experimental system  
In  Fig  7  and  8  we  present  numerical  results  where  we  have  included  direct  coupling 
between CSR and HSPG In other words we let the CSR-HSPG complexes form through 
diffusion-limited reactions between CSR and HSPG prior to ligand absorption The decay 
constant of the triad g is now tuned so as to convert any desired fraction of CSR into the 
CSR-HSPG state Fig 7 shows how the steady state level of triad concentration changes 
with the fraction of pre-formed complexes when the concentrations of CSR and HSPG 
are equal ie we have chosen n1 where the change is maximum The rate of change 
in  the  triad  steady-state  concentration  as  we  increase  the  fraction  of  pre-formed 
complexes  is  seen  to  be  larger  at  higher  ligand  concentration  For  example  at  ligand 
concentration 55  M if 60 of CSR is in the pre-formed complex state the fraction of 
the triad complexes increases by a factor of nearly 15 At lower concentrations more in 
keeping with experimental procedures the effect is negligible  In Fig 8 we have shown 
similar  data  but  by  varying  the  HSPG  to  CSR  ratio  n  keeping  the  ligand 
concentration  fixed  We  observe  that  for  a  fixed  ligand  concentration  the  fraction  of 
triads  increases  with  n  However  the  change  is  noticeable  only  at  very  high  ligand 
concentrations  We  have  further  observed  that  increasing  R 0   increases  the  effective 
  discussed prior to eqn 1a and in 
surface reaction rate note the scaling form for 
general makes the situation more favorable to triad formation  
To  conclude  this  section  we  found  that  the  results  of  Monte  Carlo  simulations  are  in 
qualitative agreement with the mean-field calculations In general the sensitivity of the 
triad concentration to the presence of pre-formed CSR-HSPG complexes increases with 
the association rate or ligand concentration and decreases with n the ratio of  HSPG  
to    CSR  At  low  ligand  concentration  more  characteristic  of  what  is  used 
experimentally the surface reactions occur much faster than absorption of ligands from 
bulk  using  typical  estimates  for  the  diffusion  coefficient  of  proteins  in  membranes 
Kucik et al 1991 so that the presence of pre-formed complexes is not important for the 
dynamics  of  the  system  At  high  values  of  n  the  local  imbalance  in  the  reactants 
accelerates the surface reactions too much and thus once again pre-formed complexes 
become irrelevant  
4 Discussion and conclusions 
In  this  paper  we  have  studied  the  FGF-2-CSR-HSPG  ligand-receptor  system  both 
through  analyzing  the  mean-field  rate  equations  and  by  means  of  cellular  automaton 
simulations Experimentally the presence of HSPG molecules has been shown to slow 
down  the  release  of  FGF-2  from  its  signaling  receptor  CSR  by  almost  a  factor of  10 
while not significantly changing the association rate Nugent and Edelman 1992 HSPG 
as well as heparin also bind FGF-2 but with lower affinity than CSR and the general 
consensus is that that HSPG stabilizes the CSR-FGF-2 complex  Like many other growth 
factors  receptor  dimerization  is  thought  to  be  necessary  for  signal  transduction  and 
stabilization  by  HSPG  appears  necessary  for  activity  under  physiological  conditions 
Fannon  Nugent 1996   
Our basic purpose in this paper is to examine two possible mechanisms for the formation 
of the CSR-FGF-2-HSPG triad complexes - a the diffusion-limited reactions between 
CSR-FGF-2  and  HSPG  and  between  FGF-2-HSPG  and  CSR  and  b  existence  of  the 
pre-formed  hetero-dimers  CSR-HSPG  on  the  cell  surface  We  sought  to  determine  the 
conditions  under  which  one  of  these  mechanisms  would  have  an  advantage  over  the 
other   
At the purely mean-field level where all the spatial organization of the reacting species is 
ignored we predicted that for any value of the ratio n of initial concentrations of HSPG 
and CSR there is a threshold value of ligand concentration above which the CSR-FGF-2 
complex  would  dominate  over  the  triad  in  the  absence  of  pre-formed  CSR-HSPG 
complexes This threshold value was found to increase linearly with n which is the ratio 
of  initial  concentrations  of  HSPG  and  CSR  It  may  be  noted  that  the  experimentally 
measured  value of  n  is cell dependent with a range  between 10  and 300 Moscatelli 
1987  and  the  range  mediated  by  changes  in  the  level  of  CSR    The  threshold  ligand 
concentration suggested by mean-field theory for an intermediate n value of 100 Fannon 
and  Nugent  1996  is  nearly  2  M  far  higher  than  the  concentrations  usually  used  in 
experiments which is of the order of nM Thus it appears that the high HSPG to CSR 
ratio observed in cells might be natures way of tilting the balance in favor of the triad 
complex which is more stable and is a likely precursor to effective CSR dimerization and 
signal transduction 
We have checked the findings from mean-field theory against Monte Carlo simulations of 
the  system  using  a  cellular  automaton  algorithm  Our  results  qualitatively  support  the 
findings of the  mean-field approximation However the threshold  ligand concentration 
required for a fair competition between the triad and binary complex is much higher than 
that predicted by the mean-field rate equations In fact for n1 the ratio of the steady-
state concentrations of CSR-FGF-2 and CSR-FGF-2-HSPG is only a little above  even 
at  ligand  concentrations  as  high  as  5   M  We  believe  that  this  is  caused  by  a  local 
imbalance in the concentrations of CSR-FGF-2 and HSPG or FGF-2-HSPG and CSR 
which arises because the rates of binding of FGF-2 to CSR and HSPG are significantly 
different This imbalance induces the reactions between the bound and unbound species 
to proceed at a much faster rate than that predicted by mean-field considerations where 
such local fluctuations are ignored A more systematic study of such fluctuations could 
lead  to  improved  quantitative  predictions  regarding  these  effects  but  is  postponed  to 
future work  
In general the characteristic time scales in the simulations for reaching the steady state 
are  much  shorter  than  what  is  found  in  experiments  example  found  in  Nugent   
Edelman 1992 This could be due to several reasons Experimental measurements have 
shown that the diffusion of large proteins such as CSR and HSPG on the cell surface 
often proceeds much slower by a factor of 10-100 than a simple estimate based on their 
size would show Fujiwara et al 2002 This is usually attributed to steric interactions 
between large proteins or obstruction to the free diffusion of proteins from the underlying 
cytoskeleton network We have not included these effects explicitly in our simple model 
but a reduction  in the diffusion coefficient by a  factor of 1000 in the absence of pre-
coupling  is  observed  to  increase  the  time  scale  by  a  factor  of  10  thus  bringing  it  to 
closer  to  experimental  values  Fig  9  However  this  observation  also  leaves  open  the 
possibility that surface binding processes are governed by a reaction rate which is much 
slower than the diffusion rate Also there is some experimental evidence that all HSPG 
sites are not  equivalent with regard to FGF-2 binding higher order complex formation 
and  signaling  Kan  et  al  1999  Knox  et  al  2002    Further  there  is  evidence  that 
specific HSPGs syndecan-4 Simons and Horowitz 2001 and glycpican-1 Qiao et al 
2003 can mediate FGF-2 signaling suggesting that a more complex model where there 
are  both  couplingnon-coupling  and  signalingnon-signaling  HSPG  may  need  to  be 
established as more experimental evidence becomes available 
Finally we add a note on the experimental and biological implications of our work The 
typical  serum  concentration  of  FGF-2  in  vivo  is  low  even  in  pathological  conditions 
Bairey et al 2001 Sezer et al 2001  As we have seen  from  both our mean-field 
theory  and  cellular  automaton  simulations  the  high  ratio  of  HSPG  to  CSR  in  cells 
combined with their vastly different affinities for FGF-2 renders pre-coupling of CSR and 
HSPG essentially irrelevant even at micro-molar concentrations the triad would be the 
dominant form of FGF-2-bound CSR However our modeling does predict that at super-
high ligand concentrations we would see an effect and it would be interesting to check for 
a possible transition from triad-dominated to binary complex-dominated states for ligand 
bound CSR

An  estimate  of  the  surface  reaction  rate  constant 
known  Smoluchowski  theory  Smoluchowski  von  M  1917  In  this  theory  two 
molecules  A  and  B  will  react  with  each  other  if  their  centers  of  mass  are  within  a

reaction radius a The effective reaction rate  D
reaction radius a and the relative diffusion coefficient of the species which is just the 
sum of the individual diffusion coefficients  
Within  Smoluchowski  theory  the  rate  equation  for  a  reaction  AB  C  in  d  spatial 
dimensions has the general form 
               A1 
 is the d-dimensional Smoluchowski factor effective reaction rate given 
by the flux of diffusing particles through an absorbing sphere of radius a centered at the 
origin  in  d  spatial  dimensions    For  our  purposes  we  need  the  two-dimensional  case 
Torney  D  C  and  McConnel  H  M  1983  which  has  the  form  at  sufficiently  large 
times 
      
   A2      
                             
We note that the reaction radius a  enters the expression only through a slowly varying 
logarithmic  term  In  fact  for  our  purposes  this  logarithmic  correction  can  largely  be 
ignored which yields the effective reaction rate

This condition says that the triad concentration will decrease as the diffusion coefficient 
 from eqn A3 which is what one would expect 
becomes smaller note that
