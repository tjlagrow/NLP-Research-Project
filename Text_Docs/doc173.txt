Abstract The cluster and eld luminosity functions LFs determined on large homogeneous samples N  2200
galaxies each are almost indistinguishable down to M   4 in the r and i lters hence suggesting that the eect
of the cluster environment on the galaxy properties does not aect the galaxy luminosity function in red bands
The similarity of the red band LFs in dierent environments suggests that the galaxy mass function is preserved
during the galaxy infall in the cluster By analyzing a large sample of galaxies in clusters ideal from many points
of view multicolor data large size many clusters metric magnitudes we found that luminosity evolution is
required by the data but the latter do not unambiguously derive its avour if a dierential luminosity evolution
between bright and faint galaxies is allowed We show that the LF parameters slope characteristic magnitude
and their evolution and errors depend on assumptions in a way seldom recognized in literature We also point
out logical inconsistencies between hypothesis assumed in deriving literature LF and presented results suggesting
caution in interpreting similar published results
Key words Galaxies evolution  - galaxies clusters general  galaxies - luminosity function
1 Introduction
The study of the cluster luminosity function LF has at
least two immediate objectives to look for environmen-
tal related eects as remarked by possible dierences be-
tween the cluster and eld LF and to look for galaxy evo-
lution by comparing the LF at dierent redshifts Both
the objectives are considered in this paper
At the present date cluster and eld LFs of large sam-
ples of galaxies in the nearby universe z  025 have been
computed Garilli Maccagni  Andreon 1999 hereafter
GMA99 Blanton et al 2001 Paolillo Andreon Longo
et al 2001 hereafter PALal01 Norberg et al 2002b de
Propris et al 2003 A convergence on the eld LF absent
just few years ago GMA99 see their gure 10 seems to
be reached Norberg et al 2002b in spite of an initial dis-
agreement Blanton et al 2001 between Sloan Digital Sky
Survey SDSS and 2 degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey
2dFGRS LFs A convergence on the cluster LF when the
considered sample is large enough to dump out possible
vagaries of individual cluster LF seems also reached given
the good agreement between the GMA99 LF based on 65
clusters the PAal01 LF computed for 39 clusters and
older LFs see GMA99 and PALal01 for details There
are however recent cluster LFs that systematically dier
from all LFs published thus far eg Goto et al 2002
Given the reached convergence on the eld and cluster
LFs it is therefore time to compare them
LFs are usually characterized by a Schechter 1976
function
M   10041M 
Me1004M 
where M  and  are the characteristic magnitudes and
the slope of the function respectively  is a normaliza-
tion parameter not relevant in this work
For the eld environment the evolution of the LF ie
the z dependence of the best t parameters of the LF has
been explored Lin et al 1999 presented some evidence
for an evolution on M  in the redshift range 012  z 
055 of the order of 04 03 mag in the restframe B R
over the explored redshift range Very recently Blanton
et al 2003 analysis of a larger SDSS data set found a
similar variation for M  in the redshift range 002  z 
022 in g  r i Blanton et al 2003 and Lin et al 1999
both claim evolution assuming a not evolving LF shape
For the clusters evolution of the LF is instead much
less explored GMA99 found only marginal if any evi-
dence for evolution in the redshift range 005  z  025
by binning cluster LFs in two z ranges de Propris et
al 1999 found evolution on M  in the K band in the
02  z  09 redshift range for M  M   1 galaxies and
assuming that  does not evolve with z
In this paper we have a twofold objective rst to com-
pare the cluster and eld LFs 2 second to measure the
evolution of the cluster LF using the same formalism used
for measuring the evolution of the eld LF The data and
the analysis is summarized in 3 whereas results are pre-
sented in Section 4
S Andreon Galaxy luminosity evolution

The shaded area is the eld LF derived by Blanton et al 2001 green open and close red points mark GMA99 and
PALal01 LFs respectively GMA99 do not compute any i band LF using pseudototal magnitudes
We adopt H0  50 km s1 Mpc1 and   1
However the H0 value reduce o in the comparisons and
is therefore irrelevant Furthermore the considered sam-
ples are at low redshift
works only a very minor fraction of galaxies are in com-
mon because of the dierent depths and eld of views
of the two works Therefore the two LFs are really inde-
pendent each other and should not share common biases
introduced by the data analysis that is completely dier-
ent in the two works
2 Cluster and eld LF
The comparison of the cluster and eld LF have been at-
tempted several times in literature for example Bromley
et al 1998ab Christlein 2000 Balogh et al 2001 Valotto
et al 1997 Trentham  Hodgkin 2002 with opposite
claims about the LF environmental dependence
Figure 1 shows three luminosity functions in the Gunn
r and i bands of the largest and most homogeneous
samples measured thus far Green open points mark the
GMA99 cluster r band LF It has been obtained in the
Gunn r lter for about 2200 galaxies in 65 clusters rang-
ing in redshift from 005 to 025 Red closed points mark
the PALal01 r and i band LFs The LFs have been ob-
tained by using F and N photographic plates calibrated in
the r and i Gunn photometric system The sample is about
15 time larger than the GMA99 one and is drawn from
39 clusters in the redshift range 006  z  028 The two
cluster LFs shown in Figure 1 are derived using dierent
materials CCD vs photographic plates dierent ways to
subtract interloper galaxies using colors vs using control
elds dierent denitions of total magnitude dier-
ent portions of the clusters GMA99 explored only the
center whereas PALal01 considered the whole cluster
and nally the absolute limiting magnitude is approxi-
mately independent on z for GMA99 whereas it is sys-
tematically brighter for more distant clusters in PALal01
Although some clusters are in common between the two
The dashed area in Figure 1 show the r and i eld
LF as measured by the SDSS Blanton et al 2001 The
sample is larger than both previous samples by a factor
of few at most and it extends over a similar redshift
range 002  z  017  020 SDSS r and i lters are
quite similar to the Gunn r and i lters at least for galax-
ies at low redshift because they map the emission coming
from almost identical part of the galaxy spectrum The
major dierence between the two systems is the star that
denes the objects of zero magnitude and color In fact
for r and i lters the conversion from SDSS to Gunn is
almost independent on the object spectra see Table 3 in
Fukugita et al 1995 We therefore correct the SDSS r
and i SDSS magnitudes for the change of the zero mag
standard star by using the values listed in Fukugita et al
1995 Galaxies having a surface brightness prole follow-
ing a de Vaucouleurs 1948 law have a Petrosian ux that
underestimates by 01-02 mag the total mag Blanton et
al 2001 Since most of the galaxies in cluster are early
type galaxies and hence have a de Vaucouleurs 1948 ra-
dial prole we made SDSS Petrosian magnitudes brighter
by 015 mag in order to make them comparable to to-
tal magnitudes derived in GMA99 SExtractor Bertin
 Arnouts 1996 isophotal corrected magnitudes and
in PALal01 Focas Jarvis  Tyson 1981 total magni-
tudes Finally SDSS absolute magnitudes are corrected
S Andreon Galaxy luminosity evolution
to our value of H0 The vertical normalization of the LFs
is arbitrary
The three LFs are almost indistinguishable hence sug-
gesting that the eect of the cluster environment on the
galaxy properties does not aect the galaxy luminosity
function in red lters The comparison performed by de
Propris et al 2003 between cluster and eld Bj LF shows
instead dierences in the cluster and eld blue LF The
similarity of the luminosity function in dierent environ-
ments in the red bands suggests that the galaxy mass func-
tion is preserved during the galaxy infall in the cluster
whereas the blue luminosity more sensitive to star bursts
is altered
The found similarity of the LF in dierent environ-
ments seems at variance with previous opposite ndings
 Many LF determinations eg Small Sargent 
Hamilton 1997 Bromley et al 1998b Christlein 2000
Balogh et al 2001 use Sandage Tammann  Yahil 1979
STY and Efstathiou Ellis  Peterson 1988 EEP LF es-
timators in which the spatial dependent part of the LF
factors out under the assumption of an LF universality1
These works claim to have measured dierent LFs in dif-
ferent environments in spite of having assumed that the
LF does not depend on environment in the LF computa-
tion Hypothesis and results are therefore in direct con-
tradiction Furthermore according to Efstathiou Ellis 
Peterson 1988 STY and EEP estimators underestimate
errors if the LF universality does not hold Because of the
logical inconsistency between hypothesis and conclusions
we consider the results of these papers as suggestive at
most and with underestimated errors
We also note that the skewed Blanton et al 2001
LF of the Las Campanas Redshift Survey undermines the
claims of environmental eects based on that survey such
as Christlein 2000 Bromley et al 1998b and Balogh et
al 2001 results Furthermore Balogh et al 2001 uses
the 2MASS photometry Jarrett et al 2000 criticized by
Andreon 2002a because 2MASS misses dim galaxies and
the outer halos of normal galaxies hence giving skewed
LFs as conrmed by Blanton et al 2003 and Bell et al
2003
 Cluster and eld are found sometime to have dier-
ent LFs Some examples are shown in Valotto et al 1997
and Zabludo  Mulchaey 2000 Almost none of the pa-
pers comparing cluster and eld LFs uses homogeneous
and large samples as the ones used in this paper see de
Propris et al 2003 as an exception and none in the red
bands considered in the present paper Furthermore only
recently Norberg et al 2002b there has been a conver-
gence on the eld LF Therefore the results of previous
cluster vs eld LF comparisons largely rely on which eld
LF has been considered Just as an example in red bands
Zabludo  Mulchaey 2000 do nd dierences between
the LF of poor groups and the eld when they adopt for
the eld the Lin et al 1996 LF The latter LF dier sys-

tematically from the SDSS LF for the reasons described in
Blanton et al 2001 The Zabludo  Mulchaey 2000
result does not tell us about environmental dierences but
about the slow convergence of the eld LF to the present
day determination
The similarity of the global red LFs in dierent envi-
ronments is not in contradiction with the suggested uni-
versality of the LFs of morphological types in the blue
band Sandage Binggeli  Tammann 1985 Jerjen 
Tammann 1997 Andreon 1998 First the LF of the types
are measured in lters dierent from the ones studied in
this paper Second the simplest interpretation of the sug-
gested universality of the LFs of the morphological types is
that galaxies change neither type nor luminosity However
the same data can be interpreted as galaxies change type
and luminosity preserving at the same time the blue LFs
of morphological types and the global mass function Such
an interpretations allows both the blue LF of the morpho-
logical types and the global red LF to be universal It natu-
rally allows the blue LF of cluster and eld to be dierent
as observed by de Propris et al 2003 Independently of
the correct interpretation of the observations the mea-
sure of the global mass function here approximated by
the red LF is important in order to know whether galax-
ies change their mass during the infall in the cluster Our
present measure suggests that mass is preserved at least
in a statistical sense
We caution the reader not to compare the SDSS and
PALal01 g band LFs since the latter LF although being
internally consistent is in a photometric system that can
be linked to the standard SDSS g  system in a quite com-
plicate way We are now re-deriving the blue cluster LF
for a twice larger sample in its natural system ie in
the BJ  Paolillo et al 2004
A technical detail should now be mentioned All three
LFs shown in Figure 1 are derived assuming that lumi-
nosity evolution in the studied redshift range is negligible
Since all three LFs considered almost the same redshift
range the comparison makes sense even in the presence of
luminosity evolution in the studied redshift range In that
case the derived LFs are computed at the median z which
is almost the same for the three LFs 015 012 010 for
GMA99 PALal01 and Blanton et al 2001 respectively
Although this point is quite technical this is an important
one the measured LF depends on the model used in its
derivations as shown in Section 4 Our comparison uses
LFs derived adopting the same model
3 Cluster LF evolution data and analysis
In order to measure the LF evolution we use the sample
presented in Garilli et al 1996 and whose LFs have been
previously presented in GMA99 This sample is ideal for
such evolutionary study for several reasons First because
all clusters are sampled at M 3 to M 4 independently
on redshift see GMA99 gure 5 The sample depth allows
to measure the evolution of both M  and  at all stud-
S Andreon Galaxy luminosity evolution
ied redshifts for the rst time Second the fact that both
M  and  can be measured at all studied redshifts should
clarify the usual degeneracy between the two parameters
and makes the results less sensitive to misinterpretations
Third GMA99 compute aperture magnitudes xed in the
galaxy frame they use a 20 kpc aperture magnitude that
we adopted here Such a metric aperture does not suer
the problem of isophotal magnitudes or even pseudototal
one according to Dalcanton 1998 that bias the LF with
z in such a way to mimic evolution The choice of a met-
ric aperture is therefore essential However LFs derived
with such an aperture are tilted with respect to the one
computed using pseudototal magnitudes and the former
cannot be compared to the latter For this reason in Figure
1 we plot the GMA99 LF derived using pseudototal mag-
nitudes and not the one computed using aperture magni-
tudes Fourth three colors Gunn g r and i photometry
is available allowing to study the wavelength dependence
of the possible evolution
The only dierence with GMA99 sample is that we
discarded one cluster MS00131558 because the stud-
ied part of it includes just one single galaxy We remind
that absolute magnitudes are kcorrected assuming an el-
liptical spectrum with kcorrections taken from Frei 
Gunn 1994
We compute the LF using standard maximum
likelihood methods STY EEP used for the eld LF de-
termination
Given a sample of N galaxies in M clusters at redshift
z1 z2  zM  we compute the likelihood L by the formula
ln L  X
clusters
galaxies
where pi is the individual conditional probability
pi  pMizi 
R M dM
where the integral
the range
 maglim where maglim is the limiting magnitude
and where  is the Schechter 1976 function modied for
allowing  and M  to vary with z
is evaluated over
M   1004z1M 
Me1004M 
z M 
z  0  P z
z  M 
0  Qz
We hence take M  and  to vary linearly with z with
a rate given by Q and P  respectively Positive values for
P and Q mean that in the past galaxies were brighter and
the LF was steeper Our Q has the same meaning of Q in
Lin et al 1999 and Blanton et al 2003 Instead their P
parameter has a dierent meaning from our P  we model
the  evolution whereas they model the  evolution

 condence levels for two degree of freedom for M  and
Q  M z when  is not allowed to evolve The no
evolution locus is given by Q  0 For a passive evolving
population Q  11  12 g r and i contours are in blue
green and red also right to left
Best t parameters are derived by maximizing the like-
lihood Error ellipses in the M   or P Q planes are
computed by nding the contour corresponding to
lnL  lnL 
where 2 is the change in 2 appropriate for the
desired condence level and a 2 distribution with two
degree of freedominteresting parameters for condence
contours and one degree of freedom for single parame-
The computation of the LF parameters by using the
maximum likelihood method has a great advantage the
i parameters one per cluster cancel out in computing
pi see the pi equation and the dimension of the overall
space to be explored decreases from 68 to 4
4 Genuine evolution or built-in the LF model
In literature LFs have been computed under one of these
three hypothesis
 no evolution at all P  Q  0 Only a few selected
studies do not make such an assumption
 no evolution on the LF slope P  0 and an assumed
evolution on M  This hypothesis is used by the 2dFGRS
LF Norberg et al 2002b
 no evolution on the LF slope P  0 M  evolution
Q is solved during the LF determination CNOC LF
Lin et al 1999 SDSS LF Blanton et al 2003
We determine the cluster LF under all these hypoth-
esis and even more Table 1 presents the derived best
S Andreon Galaxy luminosity evolution
t values and their errors We will show that results for
the very same data sample depend on the model used
to derive the LF ie on assumptions about P and Q In
particular best t parameters and their error luminosity
evolution and its statistical signicance all depend on the
adopted model suggesting caution in interpreting similar
published results
41 The usual case ie assuming P  Q  0
By xing P  Q  0 ie assuming no evolution at all
we found the same best t M   parameters found in
GMA99 comfortably showing that the present algorithm
converges to the same value previously found with an
algorithm using the 2 Presently and previously com-
puted condence contours also almost perfectly overlap
each other M  and  are correlated and the correlation
is shown in Figure 6 of GMA99
We check for a possible incompleteness in the data
sample by computing the LF adopting half a magnitude
brighter limiting magnitude in r the newly determined
best t parameters are within the 68  condence level
of the previous ones ie the dierence is less than 12
combined  in agreement with independent checks done
in GMA99
The parameters just settled ie P  Q  0 is the
original Blanton et al 2001 choice for the rst SDSS LF
derivation and also the standard setting adopted in most
LF derivations such as the StromloAPM LF Loveday
et al 1992 SSRS2 LFda Costa et al 1994 the CfA1
and CfA2 LF Marzke et al 1994 the Century Survey
LF Geller et al 1997 the Corona Borealis LF Small et
al 1997 the ESP LF Zucca et al 1997 and the K20 LF
Pozzetti et al 2003
42 P  0 and  xed at the best global t
Let now Q to be free ie we allow M  to evolve and  to
be xed ie P  0 at its best global t This setting is the
same adopted in the Lin et al 1999 LF determination
Blanton et al 2003 in their second SDSS LF derivation
do not use a Schechter function but the sum of Gaussians
with xed ie not evolving relative amplitude Therefore
also in Blanton et al 2003 the LF shape slope is not
allowed to be redshift dependent
Figure 2 shows condence contours for M  and  for
our sample As expected the present computed M  diers
from the one computed in the previous section by Q 
zmedian as it occurs between the rst and second SDSS LF
derivations Blanton et al 2003 the latter being dierent
from the former almost entirely because of the inclusion
of evolution in the luminosity function model Blanton
et al 2003
Q turn out to be positive ie galaxies are brighter in
the past in the three lters Q  0 is ruled out at 90 to
9973  condence level in the g lter only and therefore
Fig 3 Condence contours at the 683 954 and 9973
 condence levels for two degree of freedom for  and
P  z M  is forced to passively evolve g r and i
contours are in blue green and red also bottom to top
the statistical signicance of the evidence is 2 to 3  at
For an old passive evolving stellar population Q 
11 12 at the redshifts sampled in this work Such values
can easily derived from the convolution of the GISSEL96
Bruzual  Charlot 1993 spectral energy distributions
at the look back times sampled in the present work ie
z  025 with the Gunn lters Best t Q values 21 and
31 see Table 1 derived by imposing a not evolving 
are twicethree times larger than expected by assuming a
passive luminosity evolution Q  1112 but compatible
with them at the 683 or better  condence level see
Figure 2
If we stop our analysis here we would claim to have
found evidence of luminosity evolution at 2 to 3  in
good agreement with Blanton et al 2003 because our
and their Q values agree to better than 1 Instead we
proceed further
43 Q forced to be as model predictions
We now assume that Q is forced to be equal to the model
prediction ie Q  11  12 depending on lter and 
free to evolve Figure 3 shows condence contours for P
and  The best t P ie the  derivative is  1 to
15 although P 6 0 can be rejected at only the  95
 condence level Figure 3 Therefore  variations are
suggested by the data but not required evidence is  2
if passive evolution is assumed
With the further constraint of a xed  this type
of t would make resemblance to the 2dFRS LF model
Norberg et al 2002b that assumes an evolution well re-
S Andreon Galaxy luminosity evolution
The point Q  115 and P  0 ie the pure pas-
sive evolution expectation is included in the 954 percent
condence contour in g and i and in the 9973 percent con-
dence contour in r Therefore the passive evolution case
is a statistically acceptable description of the data at 2
to 3  Pure passive evolution however is not the unique
solution allowed by the data There are other acceptable
solutions at Q  115 ie M  is passively evolving a
detailed inspection of Figure 3 shown that all the range
3  P  0 is as good as or better than P  0 We
remind that negative values for P imply that the LF be-
comes atter at higher redshift
By leaving all parameter free M  evolution is smaller
or even with opposite sign than by keeping  xed see
Table 1 Therefore one more degree of freedom of evolu-
tion drastically inuences the derived M  evolution Such
a degree of freedom is allowed by none of previous LF de-
terminations including 2dFRS and SDSS Therefore we
warn the reader that other similar studies in literature
all of which assume a xed and not evolving  may mis
interpret the found M  evolution
By leaving all parameter free errors on M  and  are
larger by a factor  3 than when P  Q  0 ie under
the usual hypothesis done in the LF computation and are
twice larger than when  is kept xed
In order to check that the attening is not due to
an increasing incompleteness at faint magnitudes with in-
creasing redshift we recomputed the best t parameters
considering only the galaxies at least half a magnitude
brighter than the claimed completeness magnitude We
found almost identical best t values see Table 1 where
we list results for the r lter A couple of clusters mainly
nearby have deeper observation than the other clusters
In order to make the limiting magnitude even more uni-
form with redshift we recomputed the best t parameters
by adopting the brighter between the claimed magnitude
limits and Mr  175 mag We found identical best t
values and errors see Table 1 as expected because only
an handful of galaxies out more than 2000 are removed
by this cut Therefore best t values and condence con-
tours are robust to incompleteness
45 P  Q  0 vs the correct solution when the LF
evolves
Using the very same data GMA99 split the sample in
two redshift bins and derived the composed LF assuming
no evolution inside each redshift bin z  01 This is
the standard way in which the evolution of the luminosity
function is computed eg Lilly et al 1995 Ellis et al
1996 Heyl et al 1997 Cohen et al 2002 The comparison
of the LFs in the two redshift bins performed using a 2
approach showed no statistically signicant dierences
In the present paper by adopting a model in which  do
not evolve we found an evidence of evolution on M  at
2 to 3  A model that allow both M  and  to evolve
excludes the noevolution case at better than 3 
Fig 4 Condence contours at the 683 954 and 9973
 condence levels for two degree of freedom for P 
z and Q  M z when both  and M  are allowed
to evolve r i and g contours are in green red and blue
also left to right The noevolution locus is given by
P  Q  0 The passive evolving locus has Q  11  12
produced by simple synthesis population models and a
unique redshift independent slope Of course being M 
evolution imposed ab initio it cannot independently de-
rived by the LF analysis At most one may claim that
the found luminosity evolution is compatible with the as-
sumed one
44 All parameters free
Let now P and Q to be free in order to look for evolution
in both the parameters We do not force a priori that some
of the parameters do not evolve with redshift but we left
them to evolve as the data allow At dierence of previous
sections and previous works including SDSS and 2dFRS
ones in absence of a better knowledge we do not make
a debatable assumption and we allow all our parameters
to be redshift dependent as much as allowed by the data
We are here explicitly allowing bright and faint galaxies to
evolve dierently as it is likely because brighter galaxies
tend to be redder and are therefore presumed to be older
and slowly evolving
Figure 3 shows P Q condence contours for the three
lters The P  Q  0 point ie the noevolution case is
well outside the 9973  condence contours in g and r
whereas falls on the top of the 9973  condence contours
in the i band Therefore unevolving  and M  are rejected
at 3 or more  in all three lters Therefore evolution is
required by the data although it is not by adopting the
other LF considered models

The analysis presented here supersedes the comparison
presented in GMA99 in two aspects rst it uses the likeli-
hood approach that is more powerful than the 2 Second
it removes the logical inconsistency of checking for evolu-
tion LFs derived assuming no evolution The very same
logical inconsistency is shared by most LFs works aimed
to measure an LF evolution and nding an evolution
such as CFRS Lilly et al 1995 Autob Ellis et al 1996
Heyl et al 1997 Caltech Faint Galaxy Redshift Survey
Cohen et al 2002 and K20 Pozzetti et al 2003 LFs
The assumption of an unevolving LF in each redshift
bin has an important impact on the luminosity density
even for the modest passive evolution seen in the nearby
universe the luminosity density derived in the P  0 hy-
pothesis is 05 mag dierent from the one derived if M 
evolution is allowed Blanton et al 2003 The impact of
this statement on the luminosity density evolution the
Madau plot is obvious in particular at high redshift es-
pecially when one realizes that evolution is faster at red-
shift higher than probed by SDSS and that the redshift
range covered by SDSS is smaller z  02 than the typi-
cal redshift bin in usual luminosity density determinations
at high redshift
5 Conclusions and discussion
There are been several comparisons of the cluster and eld
LFs in literature However almost none of them uses ho-
mogeneous and large samples as the ones used in this pa-
per and none in the red bands considered in the present
paper Furthermore only recently Norberg et al 2002b
there has been convergence on the eld LF Therefore the
results of previous cluster vs eld LF comparisons largely
rely on which eld LF has been considered Here we use
the state-of-the-art LF on which convergence seems to be
reached
In our cluster vs eld comparison the same LF model
is used in both environments both are derived adopting
P  Q  0 and the two samples have very similar me-
dian redshifts making the comparison a fair one Cluster
and eld LFs determined by analysing large homogeneous
samples SDSS GMA99 PALal01 are almost indistin-
guishable down to M  4 hence suggesting that the eect
of the cluster environment on the galaxy properties does
not aect the galaxy luminosity function in red lters The
similarity of the LF shape in dierent environments sug-
gests that the galaxy mass function is preserved during
the galaxy infall in the cluster
In order to measure the LF evolution we use the sample
presented in Garilli et al 1996 that is ideal from many
points of view multicolor data large size many clusters
metric magnitudes We use the same formalism STY
used to compute many eld LF and we made dierent
assumptions on the model used to derive the LF among
which those adopted in recent LF determinations
The found evolution depends on the LF model ie
whether the slope  or the characteristic magnitude M 
or both are allowed to evolve Best t parameters dier
when dierent models are adopted in spite of the use of a
xed and large sample Models in which both M  and 
may evolve have not been considered in previous studies
and therefore the evidence of a brightening of M  with
S Andreon Galaxy luminosity evolution
look back time is intended by us as suggested by previous
works but is still far to be denitively determined even in
the largest and more recent surveys Furthermore errors
depends on the model errors are larger when more de-
grees of freedom are allowed or to be precise when other
parameters are not surreptitiously kept xed because of
a lack of a better knowledge hence suggesting that the
usual errors derived adopting P  Q  0 are underesti-
mated The underestimation is given by a factor  1  n
where n  1 2 are the number of parameters kept xed
see Table 1 This is one more reason to suggest caution
In our more general model we found a statistically sig-
nicant evidence of evolution but the data do not clarify
what M   or both is actually changing Other works
nd a more constrained evolution largely because some
evolutionary modes are not considered in these works
One may argues that our results are due to the use of a
poor sample or they concern only our sample or they are
derived using a peculiar method First our cluster sample
is large and goes to  M   4 at z  025 whereas many
of the eld surveys mentioned in this paper does not go
that deep Second for the LF determination we adopted
the most common method used for eld surveys Third
some or our results are conrmed on an independent sam-
ple and method a better model the addition of a mono-
lithic evolution to an not evolving LF changed the M 
value by many  and the luminosity density by half a mag-
nitude Blanton et al 2003 In our paper we show that
an even better model allowing a dierential luminosity
evolution between bright and faint galaxies changes the
results once more Fourth some results eg larger errors
when adding LF degrees of freedom are expected to hold
independently on the sample used
Our discussion on the impact of the model choice on
the found results has thus far concerned almost exclu-
sively LFs determined as described in Sect 3 ie by a
maximum likelihood t of the Schechter function to the
data STY Non parametric methods such as step wise
maximum likelihood SWML use a step function in place
of a Schechter one Since the problem we point out is a log-
ical one and not a prerogative of the Schechter function
non parametric methods suer in principle from similar
problems if the function is not explicitly allowed to evolve
with redshift
The 1Vmax method Schmidt 1968 is not immune to
criticisms too Some eld LFs such as CFRS Lilly et
al 1995 Autob Ellis et al 1996 K20 Pozzetti et al
2003 all were derived using the 1Vmax method Schmidt
1968 ie weighing each galaxy by the reciprocal of the
maximal volume over which is observable This method
assume a luminosity evolution in the Vmax computation
Therefore when deriving the luminosity evolution from an
LF computed with the 1Vmax method one should claim
at most that the found evolution is compatible with the
assumed one without any guarantee that the solution is
unique neither that the solution is the best one
In the course of the analysis we noted that there are
logical inconsistencies in many eld FL computations in
several papers dealing with the redshift evolution of the
LF the LF is assumed not to evolve inside each redshift
bin in which it is computed during the LF computations
even when a luminosity evolution is found2 Similarly in
several papers studying the environmental dependence of
the eld LF the LF is assumed to be environmental inde-
pendent during its computation
We suggest that future studies solve at the same time
for the LF parameters and their dependences with look
back time or environment Although we aorded the
workload of recomputing our own cluster LF by remov-
ing logical inconsistencies by allowing galaxies of dier-
ent luminosity to evolve independently each other and by
including an estimate of the impact of the model assump-
tions on the nal result we left to other authors disposing
of all the needed data to do a similar work for the nu-
merous eld LFs published thus far
When a Schechter function is adopted to describe the
LF  and M  and their errors are correlated making
the interpretation of various ndings less straightforward
than for uncorrelated parameters Therefore we suggest
to break this correlation by adopting a dierent M  def-
inition not inuenced by the LF slope at faint magni-
tudes We propose to use a Petrosianlike denition of
M  where the characteristic magnitude M  is the mag-
nitude at which the ratio between the number of galaxies
in the magnitude bin centered on m N m and in all
brighter magnitude bins N  m is equal to 
N  m
For an opportune choice of  M   M  for a Schechter
1976 function Such a denition uses only the exponen-
tial cuto of the LF where  plays a minor role if  is
chosen to reproduce M 
We apply such an approach to our own data for dif-
ferent choices of  and of the bin width over which N m
is computed Unfortunately the application of this ap-
proach do not clarify what is actually evolving in our
sample mainly because it uses only the bright part of
the LF which is also the less populated in a cluster sam-
ple The proposed approach should be more ecient for
a eld sample because most of the eld sample has mag-
nitude brighter than or similar to M  whereas for a
cluster volume limited sample most of the galaxies are
fainter than M  We propose that this approach is tested
on future LF determinations
To summarize we showed that the derived LF parame-
ters depend on the assumed model in a way seldom recog-
nized thus far With our most general model that allows
dierential luminosity evolution between bright and faint
galaxies we found a statistically signicant evidence of
evolution but the data do not unambiguously determine
what M   or both is actually changing Adopting the

best t values errors and the luminosity density
