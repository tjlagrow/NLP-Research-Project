Bistability is a major mechanism for cellular decision making and usually results from positive
feedback in biochemical control systems Here we show theoretically that bistability between un-
bound and bound states of adhesion clusters results from positive feedback mediated by structural
rather than biochemical processes namely by receptor-ligand dissociation and association dynamics
which depend non-linearly on mechanical force and receptor-ligand separation For small cell-matrix
adhesions we nd rapid switching between unbound and bound states which in the initial stages
of adhesion allows the cell to explore its environment through many transient adhesions
In cell-matrix adhesion cells use integrin-based con-
tacts to collect information about their environment 1
The integrin receptors form two-dimensional clusters in
the plasma membrane and are stabilized by connections
to the cytoskeleton Their extracellular domains re-
versibly bind ligands from the extracellular matrix like
bronectin which present the ligand epitope through a
polymeric tether In order to eciently explore a newly
encountered surface and to commit itself to adhesion only
if an appropriate combination of local signals is present
it is favorable for cells to start by establishing many small
and transient adhesions sites In the following we intro-
duce a simple theoretical model which predicts that small
cell-matrix adhesions are characterized by bistability be-
tween bound and unbound states due to well-established
principles of receptor-ligand dynamics For biochemical
control structures positive feedback is well-known to re-
sult in bistability and switch-like behavior for example
in the cell cycle and in the MAPK-cascade 2 Here we
show that bistability in biological systems can also result
from structural processes
Fig 1 shows the model studied in the following The
FIG 1 Schematic representation of our model for an adhesion
cluster with Nt bonds out of which i are closed at a given
time here Nt  5 and i  3 The force transducer at the top
and the ligand tethers at the bottom are modeled as harmonic
springs with rest lengths t and b and spring constants kt
and kb respectively The positions of the unloaded springs
dashed lines are separated by the unloaded receptor-ligand
distance  The extensions of the loaded transducer and bond
springs are denoted xt and xb    xt respectively
mechanical properties of the cell envelope holding the re-
ceptors and of the polymeric ligands are represented by
harmonic springs We consider a situation in which Nt
receptor-ligand pairs are arranged in parallel along the
cell-substrate interface At a given time t there are i
closed and Nt  i open bonds The dynamic variable i
ranges from 0 completely unbound state to Nt com-
pletely bound state The probabilities for the Nt  1
states are denoted by pit 0  i  Nt and their time
evolution is described by a one-step master equation
 ri1pi1  gi1pi1  ri  gipi 
This equation states that i can either decrease due to
rupture of a closed bond reverse rate ri or increase due
to binding of an open bond forward rate gi
The reverse rate is ri  ikof f i because any of the i
closed bonds can be the next to break The single bond
dissociation rate increases exponentially with force ac-
cording to the Bell equation kof f i  k0eFbiF0  with
the unstressed dissociation rate k0 and the internal force
scale F0 3 The force Fbi acting on each of the closed
bonds changes dynamically and follows from mechanical
equilibrium for the arrangements of springs depicted in

Here kb represents the stiness of the polymeric tethers
carrying the ligands and kt represents the eective sti-
ness of the cell envelope The distance  is the average
distance between receptors and ligands if the cluster is
completely unbound Eq 2 shows that the more bonds
are closed the less force acts on the single bonds because
it is shared between all closed bonds in the cluster
The forward rate is gi  Nt  ikoni because each
of the Nt  i open bonds can be the next to close The
single bond association rate increases as the receptor-
ligand distance xbi decreases and can be written as

monic potential conned between b and xbi kon is

simplies to a case which has been used before to study
the stability of adhesion clusters under force 4 How-
ever only the full model introduced here results in bista-
bility
In order to demonstrate that our model leads to bista-
bility it is sucient to consider the mean number of
closed bonds N t  PNt
i1 ipit Neglecting deviations
from the mean the time evolution of N t is described
by the ordinary dierential equation

where reverse and forward rate are now interpreted as
functions of a continuous argument The same mean eld
approach has been used before to study the stability of
adhesion clusters under force in the limits of high ligand
mobility and soft transducer both for constant 3 and
linearly rising force 5 In Fig 2 we show the results of
a bifurcation analysis of Eq 4 In Fig 2a stable solid
lines and unstable dashed lines xed points are shown
as function of the dimensionless unloaded receptor-ligand
distance   b and for dierent values of the dimen-
sionless inverse ligand mobility   kb2
bkBT  For small
 a single stable xed point exists at nite N  Here the
adhesion cluster is bound because force on a closed bond
is small and the density of free ligands close to the recep-
tors is large therefore rupture events are rare and can
be balanced by rebinding For large  there is a single
stable xed point at N  0 Here the adhesion clus-
ter is unbound because forces are large and ligand den-
sity at the receptors is small therefore rupture occurs
frequently and cannot be balanced by rebinding The
transition from bound to unbound proceeds via a series
of two saddle-node bifurcations resulting in a window
of bistability This bistability results from two positive
feedback mechanisms working in parallel First there is
positive feedback for rupture as one bond breaks force
on the remaining bonds is increased thus increasing their
dissociation rate Second there is positive feedback for
binding as one ligand binds receptor-ligand distance
is decreased and the binding rate for the other ligands
increases Fig 2a also shows that with increasing lig-
and mobility decreasing  the bistable region shifts
to larger  because the spatial distribution of ligands be-
comes broader thus stabilizing adhesion clusters through
rebinding In Fig 2b we construct a stability diagram by
plotting the  corresponding to the upper and lower bi-
furcation points as a function of  Again we observe that

To study the dynamics of adhesion clusters the full
stochastic model of Eq 1 has to be used Bistabil-
ity demonstrated in the bifurcation analysis of the mean
eld theory now corresponds to bimodality of the station-
ary probability distribution Again coexistence of bound
and unbound adhesion clusters is found for intermediate
values of the unloaded receptor-ligand distance  In the
stochastic description the system is able to switch dy-
namically between these coexisting macrostates Using
Eq 1 average binding and unbinding times can be cal-
culated as mean rst passage times 6
In Fig 3 we
plot average binding and unbinding times as function of
the unloaded receptor-ligand distance  for cluster sizes
Nt  10 solid lines and 25 dashed lines A detailed
analysis shows that their ratio eectively equals the ra-
tio of occupancy probabilities of the stationary solution
of the master equation Therefore when binding and un-
binding times are equal unbound and bound state are
occupied with equal probability thus dening a stochas-
tic transition point The shaded areas in Fig 3 show
the windows of bistability derived from the mean eld

by bars are the windows of bistability which overlap in the
darker region from the mean eld theory for Nt  10 left
and Nt  25 right
approach For Nt  10 the stochastic transition point
is below the deterministic range while for Nt  25 it
falls into the deterministic range The denition of a
range of bistability is less appropriate in the stochastic
case because here the existence of a bimodal distribution
is completented by information on the transition times
For both deterministic and stochastic descriptions the -
values for bistability increase with Nt so that for a given
 the bound state becomes the only stable macrostate
when Nt grows In the stochastic treatment this leads
to an super-exponentially fast increase of unbinding time
with Nt for xed  so that larger adhesions get eectively
trapped in the bound state and only small adhesions will
show bistable switching on an experimental time scale
We nally discuss how our results apply to the integrin-
bronectin bond For the low anity bronectin-51-
integrin bond k0  013 Hz and F0  10 pN has been
measured 7 and we assume konk0  1 Fibronectin is
a semi-exible polymer with contour length L  62 nm
persistence length Lp  04 nm and equilibrium length
b  11 nm Therefore the spring constant at small ex-
tensions can be estimated to be kb  3kBT 2LpL 
025 pN nm1 From this we get kbbF0  027 and
  71 In order to estimate the eective spring con-
stant of the force transducer we use the Hertz model for
elastically deforming the cell with a cylinder of radius
a Then kt  2aE1  2  027 pN nm1 where we
have used E  10 kPa for the Young modulus   05
for the Poisson ratio and a  10 nm for the size of the
adhesion cluster Thus the ratio of force constants is
kbkt  09 and bistability for Nt  5 is found from
the full stochastic model around   075 The actual
unloaded cell-substrate distance is the unloaded receptor-
ligand separation  plus the ligand resting length b that
is 20 nm This indeed is the range of cell-substrate dis-
tance at which mature cell-matrix adhesion starts 8
In summary our model predicts that the early phase
of cell-matrix adhesion is characterized by rapid asso-
ciation and dissociation of small adhesion sites which
have attachment times in the range of several tens of
seconds In the presence of appropriate signals commit-
ment to rm adhesion can be induced through dierent
mechanisms including recruitment of additional recep-
tors and changes in binding anity which increase the
escape time from the bound macrostate In this sense
the structural mechanism for bistability described here
resembles the switch-like behavior often encountered in
biochemical control structures
