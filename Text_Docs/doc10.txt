ABSTRACT
Galaxy bias can be split into two components a formation-bias based on the locations of
galaxy creation and an evolution-bias that details their subsequent evolution In this letter
we consider evolution-bias in the peaks model In this model galaxy formation takes place
at local maxima in the density eld and we analyse the subsequent peculiar motion of these
galaxies in a linear model of structure formation The peak restriction yields differences in
the velocity distribution and correlation between the galaxy and the dark matter elds which
causes the evolution-bias component of the total bias to evolve in a scale-dependent way This
mechanism naturally gives rise to a change in shape between galaxy and matter correlation
functions that depends on the mean age of the galaxy population This model predicts that
older galaxies would be more strongly biased on large scales compared to younger galaxies
Our arguments are supported by a Monte-Carlo simulation of galaxy pairs propagated using
the Zeldovich-approximation for describing linear peculiar galaxy motion

1 INTRODUCTION
A number of interesting observational results have recently been
published related to the bias of galaxies On large scales k 
02 h Mpc1 the clustering of the 2dFGRS Colless et al 2003
and SDSS York et al 2000 main galaxies is signicantly differ-
ent Cole et al 2005 Percival et al 2007 Sanchez  Cole 2007
There is an excess of clustering for the SDSS main sample galax-
ies on scales greater than k  02 h Mpc1 which is not seen in
the 2dFGRS galaxies If uncorrected this impacts on cosmologi-
cal parameter measurements utilising the power spectrum shape If
the SDSS main galaxy sample is split by luminosity we see that the
bias depends on the r-band galaxy luminosity Tegmark et al 2004
Percival et al 2007 and a similar trend was observed in the 2dF-
GRS sample Norberg et al 2001 If the SDSS galaxies are split
in both colour and luminosity red galaxies are more clustered than
blue galaxies but this is not a simple trend Swanson et al 2007
Red galaxies have the strongest relative bias on large scales inde-
pendent of luminosity while the bias of blue galaxies appears to
rise monotonically with luminosity In addition there appear to be
a number of cosmic conspiracies when considering the cosmolog-
ical evolution of clustering of different galaxy classes The ampli-
tude of the clustering of the SDSS LRGs remains roughly constant
with redshift Eisenstein et al 2005 Tegmark et al 2006 In this
case the growth over time of the matter power spectrum is approx-
imately canceled by a drop in the average bias Croom et al 2005
considered the evolution of the clustering amplitude of quasars in
the 2dFQRS They found that the amplitude of quasar clustering
increases with increasing redshift If quasars Poisson sample the

matter distribution in the Universe however then we would rather
expect their large-scale clustering amplitude to be proportional to
the linear growth factor decreasing with increasing redshift There
is therefore still a great deal still to understand about galaxy bias
Models of galaxy bias depend on two different processes in
addition to the clustering of the underlying matter eld formation-
bias describes the effect of galaxies forming at local extrema in
the density eld These galaxies then move following the large-
scale matter velocity eld resulting in evolution-bias Although the
galaxies may move locally with the matter velocity eld their pe-
culiar velocity distribution does not have to match that of the mat-
ter Ultimately evolution-bias will lead galaxies to merge together
reducing their number density and changing the clustering proper-
ties of the population as a whole In the simplest model of struc-
ture growth galaxies are always hosted within a halo whose mass
increases with time In such a picture evolution-bias is matched
by the increase in the average halo mass which hosts a particular
galaxy after it has formed A stronger evolution-bias growth in-
dicates an increased likelihood of rapid halo mass growth through
a continual merging process In order to model the bias of an ob-
served galaxy population we also need to include the observational
selection function of the sample which will include the galaxy for-
mation time distributions
Of the decomposition of galaxy bias into the two components
it is expected that the formation-bias is the largest contributor for
almost all galaxy populations the peaks formalism Bardeen et al
1986 predicts a strong clustering amplitude for galaxy formation
at high redshift which takes the matter eld a long time to match
Formation-bias evolves strongly with redshift so for a popula-
tion of similar galaxies observed at different redshifts this will
dominate the change in the bias with time This is different from

evolution-bias which gives the change in the bias of the same set
of galaxies
Driven by the observational results discussed above we now
reconsider evolution-bias from a theoretical point of view Al-
though galaxy formation itself is a non-linear process the veloc-
ity eld of galaxies on large scales can be sufciently well de-
scribed using linear theory Previous work on evolution-bias has
assumed a local model where the distribution of galaxy velocities
matches that of the density eld Fry 1996 Tegmark  Peebles
1998 This simplies the relevant formulae and an analytic de-
scription of evolution-bias is achievable this method is reviewed in
Sect 2 However if galaxies formed at the peaks of the smoothed
density eld the expected distributions of the galaxy peculiar ve-
locities and of the matter eld will not match Bardeen et al 1986
This effect is due to the nonzero covariance between the velocity
eld and the density gradient and complicates the evolution-bias
scenario introduced by Fry 1996 We outline the theory of this ap-
proach in Sects 3 and 4 describe the Monte-Carlo sampling tech-
nique we use to follow evolution-bias in Sect 5 and summarise in
Throughout the cosmological model assumed is the standard
CDM cosmology with adiabatic initial perturbations Choices
for the relevant parameter values are m  025   075

and 8  08 For the matter power spectrum we make the
ansatz Pk  kns T 2k with the transfer T k function given by
Bardeen et al 1986 and the shape parameter given by Sugiyama
1995 Where necessary we impose a Gaussian smoothing on the
density eld with the lter scale rscale which is related to the mass

2 ANALYTIC MODELS OF EVOLUTION-BIAS
21 Limit of small overdensities
Following the derivation of Fry 1996 we assume that the pe-
culiar velocities of galaxies match those of the matter eld at the
same locations  The continuity equation for the galaxy density
can be written tgal  divgal and for the matter tCDM 
divCDM  By dening      1 the continuity equation
for the matter reduces to tCDMa  diva for small CDM
Solving the system consisting of the continuity and Euler-equations
yields the result that the evolution of CDM is driven by the standard
linear growth factor Da so that CDMa  DaCDM1 with
D1  1 at present day
If gal  CDM is small everywhere then gala satises
the same linear continuity equation as CDMa giving gala 
diva In this limit
gala  gal1  Da  1CDM1
Note that the assumption of small galCDM is important because
the densities of the dark matter and galaxy elds need to be matched
in the full continuity equations in order for the expected growth in
gal to be equal to that of CDM This assumption is equivalent to
stating that the distribution of the peculiar velocities of the galaxies
is the same as that of the matter eld
22 Starting from linear bias
This idea has been extended by Fry 1996 who considered a
galaxy overdensity eld with a linear bias at present day gal1 
b1CDM1 Substituting this into eqn 1 gives gala  Da 
1  b1CDM1 In this model the linear bias is is related to the
growth function by
Da  1  b1
Furthermore Tegmark  Peebles 1998 considered the evolution-
bias of galaxies following the more general stochastic bias model
of Dekel  Lahav 1999 and derive cross correlations between the
matter density and galaxy elds To simplify the analysis we follow
Tegmark  Peebles 1998 and dene the vector
xa    CDMa
Forcing the galaxy overdensity eld to obey the bias model of
Dekel  Lahav 1999 at present day allows the galaxy and dark
matter distributions to be related by an additional correlation coef-
cient r At present day the covariance matrix can be written
C1  hx1xt1i  h2
In this notation the continuity equation for the galaxy overdensity
eld coupled with the linear growth factor for the matter gives
xa  Max1  where M    Da
The corresponding evolution of the covariance matrix Ca 
MaC1Mta shows that the evolution of the galaxy overdensity
eld can be rewritten in terms of ra and ba Tegmark  Peebles
1998 and that the bias model does not change its form For r  1
the formula reduces to the relation of Fry 1996
23 Bias for Gaussian random elds
In work predating Fry 1996 and Tegmark  Peebles 1998
Bardeen et al 1986 considered the evolution of bias for galaxies
that form at peaks of the density eld after smoothing on a cer-
tain mass scale On large scales the peak density eld can be con-
sidered as a continuous Gaussian random eld itself statistically
independent and uncorrelated with the background which drives
the dynamics of the galaxies The galaxy and matter density eld
evolve independently due to the peak-background split as indepen-
dent k-modes are important for their respective evolution
Using this model Bardeen et al 1986 showed that the large-
scale bias evolves as ba  cMa  1 for a smoothed Gaus-
sian density eld with variance Ma where c is the overdensity
threshold above which galaxies form On linear scales the vari-
ance of the density eld Ma is proportional to the linear growth
factor Ma  Da Consequently if we normalise the bias at
present day we recover eqn 2 for the evolution of the bias A key
assumption made in the derivation is the treatment of the galaxy
distribution as a continuous eld and that the evolution in the co-
moving number density of peaks is driven by the evolution of the
background density which is in effect a reformulation of the conti-
nuity equation for the galaxy eld Forcing the number density of
galaxies to evolve with the background density is akin to the as-
sumption of small gal  CDM that led to the linearised continuity
equation for the galaxy eld

3 STRUCTURE GROWTH FROM PAIR VELOCITIES
The above descriptions of evolution-bias can also be understood in
terms of the peculiar velocities of a discrete set of galaxies The
variance of the peculiar velocity distribution for each galaxy is
aHz f 2
where Hz is the Hubble parameter and f  d log Dd log a If we
assume that  is small everywhere the expected infall velocity is
zero for all pairs of galaxies we are as likely to choose galaxies that
are moving apart in comoving space as peaks moving together
If galaxy peculiar velocities were uncorrelated the galaxy density
eld would not develop clustering as any initial clustering pattern
will be destroyed by the random diffusion This is not the case for
velocity elds driven by correlated Gaussian random overdensity
elds as the velocities of galaxy pairs of separation r are correlated
according to
Cr  h1  2i 
aHz f 2
dk Pk j0kr
Velocities of pairs of galaxies will be strongly correlated when r
is small as both galaxies preferentially move in the same direction
being part of the same bulk ow but velocities of galaxy pairs with
large separations are less strongly correlated This difference means
that there is a net inux of galaxy pairs from large to small sepa-
rations which leads to the growth in the clustering strength For a
pair of galaxies of separation r the variance of the peculiar velocity
difference is
h1  22i  22
where 2
 is a diffusion term
Changing the selection criteria of galaxy pair-velocities natu-
rally changes the evolution of galaxy clustering An extreme exam-
ple of a galaxy eld with an evolution-bias would be the assump-
tion that galaxies only form at locations where the peculiar velocity
  0 After formation galaxies at these locations do not move and
the galaxy overdensity and clustering properties are constant in co-
moving space In contrast to the model proposed by Bardeen et al
1986 this is not physically motivated because there is no a-priori
reason to link places in the velocity eld where   0 with galaxy
formation The derivation leading to eqn 1 breaks down for this
model because it relied on matching the galaxy and matter over-
density elds which is clearly broken In this situation the galax-
ies still locally move with the matter although the distribution of
galaxy velocities does not match the distribution of velocities of the
dark matter
4 EVOLUTION-BIAS IN THE PEAKS FORMALISM
We now consider the evolution of a set of galaxies that form at the
peaks of a smoothed density eld where there is the most rapid
increase in density After formation the galaxies leave the peaks
whose positions are xed in comoving space and move with the
matter ow
We wish to estimate the average velocity of a matter concen-
tration at a peak in the eld so we will need to consider the density
and velocity elds after smoothing by a lter of width rsmooth The
velocity dispersion and correlation can be calculated by replacing
Pk with the smoothed power spectrum Pk in eqns 6 7 and
8 For large separations r  rsmooth the Bessel function in eqn 7
takes precedence over the smoothing of the eld and Cr tends

Peculiar velocities and evolution-bias
Figure 1 The expected variance for velocities in a Gaussian random eld

dotted lines plotted against smoothing scale parametrised by the mass en-
closed within the lter upper lines The expected velocity correlation be-
tween two points separated by 200 h1 Mpc under the same assumptions
are shown by the lower lines The decrease in velocity variance caused
by additionally selecting sampling points with vanishing gradient in the
smoothed density eld is indicated by the dashed lines
towards the value for the unsmoothed eld In contrast the variance
of the velocity for each galaxy 2
 eqn 6 which is independent
of r does depend on the smoothing applied to the eld The effects
of the smoothing scale on 2
 and Cr are shown in Fig 1 for a
pair separation of 200 h1 Mpc
In order to select peaks in the smoothed density eld we need
to set two further constraints on the galaxy locations The density
gradient has to be zero and the local curvature needs to be posi-
tive denite Because the velocities are correlated with the density
gradient placing galaxies at locations where the gradient is zero
reduces the velocity variance 2
 from that of eqn 6 by a factor
 Bardeen et al 1986 Szalay  Jensen 1987 Peacock et al
1987 where
dk k2 j2Pk
For a smoothed eld Pk needs to be replaced by Pk with the
consequence that   1 as rsmooth   In the limit of large r the
velocity correlation function is unchanged by the peak constraint
In this limit velocity-velocity correlations dominate over velocity-
gradient or gradient-gradient correlations because of the additional
k1 terms in the velocity-dependent integrands The effect of in-
cluding both the smoothing of the eld and the zero-gradient selec-
tion criteria on 2
 and Cr is shown in Fig 1 for a pair separa-
tion of 200 h1 Mpc
The reduction of the dispersion element of eqn 8 while
keeping the growth component xed will lead to a scale-dependent
increase in the 2-point galaxy correlation function Regos  Szalay
1995 also comment on this From this it is clear that propagating
galaxies along their velocity vectors does not preserve the shape
of the correlation function and the bias evolution formalism devel-
oped in Sect 2 breaks down

z  2 squares calculated from a Monte-Carlo realisation of 108 indepen-
dent pairs of points in a Gaussian random eld These are compared with
the expected correlations for linear growth dashed lines On large scales
r becomes negative because we only sample pairs of galaxies with initial
separation  100 h1 Mpc
5 MONTE-CARLO SIMULATION OF GALAXY PAIR
PROPERTIES
We use the formalism introduced by Regos  Szalay 1995 to set
up a Gaussian random process for determining velocity variances
and correlations in the large-scale structure Regos  Szalay 1995
show how a 26  26 covariance matrix can be constructed for the
multi-variate Gaussian distribution of the properties overdensity
3 gradient components 6 curvature components and 3 velocity
components of pairs of points in a smoothed Gaussian random
eld The matrix depends on the power spectrum moments given
in eqn 9 and from the functions of the pair separation r given by
Km  4Z 
dk km jlkr Pk
Using these covariance matrices we can randomly draw realisa-
tions of the properties of pairs of points in the eld assuming they
follow a multi-variate Gaussian distribution We can also add con-
straints on the pairs selected such as that they must both be at a
peak in the eld
We rst demonstrate that this procedure can reproduce the
linear growth expected for the matter eld We have produced a
Monte-Carlo realisation of 108 pairs of galaxies using the proce-
dure described above without any additional constraints on pair se-
lection This corresponds to choosing random locations in a matter
eld The peculiar velocities were then used to estimate the motion
of galaxies in linear structure formation using the Zeldovich ap-
proximation This is applicable for small displacements and should
therefore accurately describe the initial effect of evolution-bias af-
ter galaxy formation The dynamical model is affected by the prop-
erties of the particular dark energy model through the growth func-
tion Da which affects the peculiar velocities From these data
we have calculated r for z  0 1 2 assuming that the galaxy
pairs evolve from an initial unclustered comoving distribution as
expected for the matter in the Universe which is initially homo-
Figure 3 The expected amplitude of the pair-velocity as a function of pair-
separation for peaks selected for halos of mass 101015 M solid lines
Increasing the halo mass leads to larger infall velocities These curves
were calculated from 107 independent pairs of peaks although each was
weighted as described in the text so these correspond to a much smaller
effective number of pairs The expected pair-velocity for locations selected
at random in the matter distribution is shown by the dotted line
geneous The correlation functions are plotted in Fig 2 showing
excellent agreement with the expected linear evolution
We now consider galaxies that form at peaks in this eld The
additional criteria applied within our Monte-Carlo procedure to en-
sure that we select peaks are
i overdensity threshold   c  169
ii gradient   0
iii positive denite curvature matrix
Peaks are rare so simply selecting peaks from pairs chosen at ran-
dom is computationally unfeasible Instead where possible we
force the properties that are required for example we only sample
from the tail of a Gaussian distribution to select   c and then
weight the chosen pairs by the likelihood of making that selection
in a full multi-variate analysis This gives a weighted distribution
with the same statistical properties as selecting a true Monte-Carlo
sample but is computationally faster for determining the properties
of the distribution
The expected amplitude of the pair-velocity h1  2i for
galaxies selected at peaks is plotted in Fig 3 for halos of mass
101015 M The expected pair-velocities differ from those of the
mass because peaks are more likely to be approaching each other
than moving apart at large separations The evolution in the cor-
relation function depends on the derivative of the expected pair-
velocity which controls the net change of pairs with a given sep-
aration when the distances travelled are small As we move to
increasing separation the peak pair-velocity increases rapidly but
then turns over and starts to decrease This will lead to the corre-
lation function decreasing on small scales and increasing on large
We have constructed a weighted Monte-Carlo distribution of
3  108 galaxy pairs selected at the peaks in a Gaussian random
eld smoothed by a Gaussian lter with width corresponding to a

Peculiar velocities and evolution-bias
demonstrated this from both analytic arguments and a Monte-Carlo
procedure based on the work of Regos  Szalay 1995 Evolution-
bias provides a mechanism for producing a scale-dependent bias
in 2-pt correlation measurements whose importance grows as the
galaxies move and consequently depends on the time since galaxy
formation Note that the overall bias of a galaxy sample would in
general be expected to be a decreasing function of time because
this depends on the increasing amplitude of the clustering of the
matter eld
The inclusion of evolution-bias in a combined model of galaxy
bias would predict that older galaxies have a scale dependent bias
with a correlation function whose shape is less like that of the mat-
ter eld than a population of younger galaxies In the most simple
model the red luminosity of an individual galaxy increases and
then fades with time Galaxies can also merge together forming
larger brighter objects The oldest eld galaxies tend to be faintest
and should be most affected by scale-dependent biasing on large
scales Such a description might explain why the SDSS LRGs and
2dFGRS galaxies seem to match a simple prescription for galaxy
bias while the SDSS main galaxies do not Sanchez  Cole 2007
The SDSS main galaxies sample would contain these old eld
galaxies The evolution-bias considered here would also impact on
measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale length from
the power spectrum or correlation function Further simulations
such as provided by semi-analytic techniques which combine for-
mation and evolution-bias are required to consider this mechanism
in more detail and apply it to specic galaxy types

halo mass 1012 M In order to demonstrate the effect of peak selec-
tion on the galaxy correlation function we have followed the evolu-
tion of galaxies pairs from an initially unclustered distribution This
matches the analysis of pairs of galaxies selected at random from
the matter distribution that led to Fig 2 but selects special locations
in the velocity eld The ratios between the recovered galaxy corre-
lation functions and those expected for the matter at z  0 1 2 are
shown in Fig 4 As we move from small to large scales the bias at
any redshift initially decreases because of the change in expected
infall velocity shown in Fig 3 but then increases beyond that of
the matter eld as expected from the analytic arguments discussed
in Sect 4 Due to the fact that galaxies only pick up their pecu-
liar velocities after formation this plot should not be interpreted
as giving the actual galaxy correlation functions for peaks To do
this we would need to specify galaxy formation times and their
spatial distribution or formation-bias The relative effect of the
evolution-bias on r however should be the same and this plot
demonstrates that bias is not a simple function of scale The large-
scale bias is a decreasing function of time as the amplitude of the
clustering of the matter eld grows to match the strong evolution-
bias predicted at early times
6 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We have considered a decomposition of galaxy bias into formation-
bias and evolution-bias The formation- and evolution-biases are
inter-related with one tending to lead to the other By choosing
special locations for galaxy formation we also tend to choose loca-
tions that lead to group evolution that is very different from that of
particles selected at random in the matter eld By analysing mod-
els of evolution-bias we have argued that this component of bias
has some interesting properties within the peaks model We have
