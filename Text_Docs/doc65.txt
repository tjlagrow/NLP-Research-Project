1 Introduction
There is a well-accepted prescription for the formation of disk galax-
ies The dark matter context works well Dark potential wells develop
hierarchically and acquire angular momentum via tidal torques with
neighbouring protohalos Baryons cool and dissipate their gravitational
potential energy and conserve angular momentum to form a nearly
self-gravitating disk of size Rh where  is the dimensionless spin
parameter acquired via nonlinear interactions and Rh is the halo virial
radius The disk cools and becomes gravitationally unstable to massive
cloud formation The clouds eventually themselves become unstable
and fragment into stars that form a disk with an exponential surface
brightness prole a scale-length of a few kiloparsecs and a central
surface density of order hundreds of solar masses per square parsec for
Milky-Way type spirals Star formation fed and self-regulated by disk
instability continues via ongoing accretion of gas into the disk from the
halo reservoir of gas and small satellites
There are numerous observational probes of this simple picture The
current star formation rate in disks is measured via H emission ef-
fectively probing the formation of massive stars The disk gas fraction
is measured via HI and CO observations and provides the fuel that
drives disk star formation Multicolour imaging provides a measure of
the spectral energy distribution and probes the disk age over 10 Gyr
Stellar absorption features such as the Balmer spectral line index H
measure ages over a baseline of about 2 Gyr Large samples of disk
galaxies most recently utilizing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey enable
one to correlate surface brightness with total stellar mass galaxy radii

one to explore the Tully-Fisher relation Galaxy scales metallicities
and correlations provide fossilized glimpses of the galaxy formation
epoch Observations at high redshift can directly target the epoch of
formation All of these probes lead to strong constraints on the basic
disk formation model
Theory provides a well-accepted framework for the hierarchical for-
mation of dark matter halos However it is far weaker when it comes to
the formation and evolution of the star-forming components of galaxies
In this review I will concentrate on disk galaxies and discuss the
problems that have arisen with some of the proposed solutions Much
of our understanding centres on the concept of self-regulation of the
global star formation rate Unfortunately some of the key ingredients
are poorly known
2 Disk formation
The dark matter that dominates the matter budget of the universe
and in particular the galactic mass budget is considered to be non-
dissipative While the precise nature of the dark matter remains elusive
the hierarchical formation of non-dissipative dark potential wells in
which baryons dissipate and condense into stars has provided a success-
ful model for many elements of the large-scale structure of the galaxy
distribution White  Rees 1978 Galaxy clustering can be explained
in such a framework as can the properties of the dark halos that are
inferred for example from rotation curves and of the intergalactic
medium where neutral baryons in the form of the Lyman alpha forest
provide a powerful probe of the weakly nonlinear regime Tidal torques
are generated by nonlinear interactions between neighbouring uctua-
tions and nascent halos If the baryons conserve angular momentum as
they dissipate kinetic energy and contract disks spanning the observed
size distribution are formed The distribution of angular momentum is
not such a good match as the theory predicts far more low angular
momentum gas than is seen Once the baryon disk is self-gravitating
it is gravitationally unstable and fragments into stars This general
overview of disk formation can match many of the observed properties
of disks provided that disk star formation is an inecient process
Observed disks are still gas-rich and star formation extends over 50
or more disk dynamical time-scales

3 Global star formation in disks
Disk star formation can be understood via a hybrid model that is
a combination of phenomenology and gravitational instability theory
The low eciency of star formation is determined by the gravitational
instability of a cold gas-rich disk resulting in the formation of warm
molecular gas clouds which in turn fragment into stars Cloud collapse
and star formation are enhanced by cloud coalescence and growth as
the clouds orbit the galaxy This process is modulated and amplied by
the spiral density wave pattern of the dierentially rotating disk The
instability in a gas disk is quenched by the Toomre criterion when the
Toomre parameter Q  critgas becomes larger than unity Here the
critical surface density is to within a numerical factor of order unity
given by gasG with  equal to the epicyclic frequency and gas
being the gas velocity dispersion For a disk consisting of stars and
gas the criterion must be slightly modied but it is essentially the
coldest component the gas that drives the instability provided that
 g where  is the disk stellar
the gas surface density gas
surface density and  is the stellar velocity dispersion
This scheme is used to derive an empirical star formation rate the
Schmidt-Kennicutt law which has been applied to t a large sample of
star-forming disk galaxies Beyond the radius where the azimuthally-
averaged surface density drops below the critical value the disk is stable
to cloud formation The inferred star formation rate if one assumes
that the clouds once formed are unstable to star formation within a
disk rotation time or less can be approximated by
  n
gasQ2  1
for Q  1 with n  1 The instability requires the disk to be in
dierential rotation at rate r
The predictions of such a semi-empirical model are straightforward
star formation occurs inside-out in disks quenching below the threshold
surface density of cold gas HI or H2 of a few solar masses per square
parsec and star formation decays monotonically as the gas supply is
exhausted The duration of star formation can be extended if gas infall
occurs from the halo
Broadly viewed such a model works reasonably well from the point
of view of chemical evolution cf Prantzos these proceedings However
detailed recent studies of disk star formation suggest that there are
signicant omissions in the underlying physics For example there is
the realization that the radial dependence of disk star formation is not
always well modeled by the empirical law Ferguson et al 1998 In
some galaxies star formation occurs below the threshold surface den-

sity This is most likely due to the non-axially symmetric distribution
of the gas Locally the gas surface density may be high as for example
in spiral arms
Another hint of the need for a more complex theory comes from
studies of the age distribution of disk stars In the Milky Way the star
formation rate history is seen to be non-monotonic Rocha-Pinto et al
2000 In fact studies of chromospheric age indicators reveal a series of
modest star bursts A similar pattern is found in other nearby galax-
ies where stars can be resolved and the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
can be used to study the star formation history Presumably infall is
occurring in a non-uniform way for example via mergers of satellite
galaxies Studies of the metallicity distribution of old disk stars in the
solar neighbourhood require early infall in order to account for the
paucity of old metal-poor stars
The underlying logic of dissipative disk formation in weakly inter-
acting halos of cold dark matter seems compelling Star formation is
inecient in disks because of self-regulation The disk forms via collapse
in the dark halo of gas that has acquired some angular momentum via
tidal torques between neighbouring halos The dimensionless angular
momentum parameter is initially vrot  015 and contraction by a
factor of order 10 in an isothermal dark halo of virial radius 100 kpc
that dominates the gravity results in a disk of scale around 5 kpc if
specic angular momentum is approximately conserved
The gas disk is cold and gravitationally unstable forming giant cloud
complexes that aggregate gas and are in turn unstable to fragmentation
Feedback both via dynamical heating of the stars and by supernova
remnant interactions heat and stabilize the system against further star
formation until further gas infall drives further gas cooling
Because of the bottom-up nature of the clustering hierarchy driven
by the approximately scale-invariant primordial density uctuation spec-
trum the density uctuation amplitude scales with mass as  
1  z1M n36 with n  15 on galaxy scales This means that
massive halos form after lower mass halos with the virialization redshift
scaling as approximately M 14 There is as much mass in the low
mass halos as in the massive halos with the number of halos scaling as
dNdM 
 M 2
There are serious deciencies in the model that remain when disk
formation is incorporated by such simple rules into semi-analytic galaxy
formation theory that builds on numerical simulations of dark matter
clusters

4 The dark side of disk formation
Several fundamental problems have arisen in detailed attempts to im-
plement disk formation The baryons undergo excessive cooling The
highest resolution simulations to date have revealed that as a conse-
quence of the unresolved clumpiness of the dark matter most of the
baryonic angular momentum is lost to the dark halo by dynamical fric-
tion of infalling baryon clumps The nal specic angular momentum is
only twenty percent or less of what is observed The angular momentum
distribution also does not match that of dark halos if the baryon angular
momentum distribution tracks that of the dark matter there being far
too much low angular momentum gas at small galactocentric radii in
the models Even if angular momentum is assumed to be conserved by
the baryons the nal disk in a Milky Way-like galaxy is about twice
as massive as observed
One issue is generic to hierarchical formation models with a specied
eciency of turning gas into stars The most massive systems form late
and hence are expected to be younger and therefore bluer than less
massive disks The opposite trend is seen in the disk colour-magnitude
relation van den Bosch 2002
A further diculty arises from the substructure in the dark halos
that results in the formation of many satellite halos These are not
observed as stellar systems for example in the distribution of Local
Group dwarf galaxies Another problem concerns the density distribu-
tion of the dark matter halos The dark matter halos seem to be too
concentrated compared to actual galaxies Cusps are predicted in the
halo cores that are not seen in nature and the ratio of dark mass to
baryonic mass is excessive in the vicinity of the baryon-dominated disk
Several galaxies have been modelled in detail and illustrate these
various trends The Milky Way has the best studied rotation curve
Binney and Evans combined the inner rotation curve with microlensing
data to infer that the observed microlensing optical depth towards
the galactic centre requires so many stars that one has diculty in
acommodating a diuse cold dark matter component No more than 10
percent of the dark matter within 5 kpc can be diuse and non-baryonic
Binney  Evans 2001 In particular the NFW prole   r1 for
r  rs with rs  01r200 is not allowed Indeed the highest resolution
simulations require an even steeper dark matter cusp   r15 This
certainly would not allow enough bulge and inner disk stars to give a
reasonable microlensing optical depth
A complementary study by Klypin et al focuses on the outer Milky
Way rotation curve They argue that up to half of the mass within 10
kpc may be contributed by the dark halo thereby allowing a NFW
kieltex 2022008 105 p5
Joseph Silk
prole Klypin Zhao and Somerville 2002 However this conclusion
comes at a cost Only 60 percent of the baryons inferred by the model
to be within the virial radius can be accomodated in the bulge stellar
halo and disk including interstellar matter Most of the observed mass
of course is in stars which are measured directly for stars of order a
solar mass or larger and via rotation curve modelling diuse infrared
emission and bulge microlensing for the least massive stars All disk for-
mation and evolution simulations seem to run into a similar diculty
as for example in a recent discussion of colour evolution Westera et
al 2002
Several of these issues are manifestations of the overcooling problem
that is generic to hierarchical structure formation models The cooled
baryon fraction in cluster simulations is about 30 percent whereas
the global CDM prediction is about 5 percent for the baryon fraction
which for m  03 predicts 15 percent for rich clusters as indeed is
observed About half of the cooled baryons remain on the peripheries
of clusters as the warmhot intergalactic medium at T  105  106 K
Numerical SPH simulations nd such a WIGM although the physics
of how this gas is heated yet remains outside the cluster virial radius is
not completely clear Shock heating is obviously important but there
are numerical issues that need to be claried The WIGM however only
acccounts for about 30 percent of the total baryon content of the low
redshift universe The cluster x-ray luminosity-temperature correlation
which monitors the mass in virialised gas does not satisfy the simple
scaling expected in hierarchical collapse models but rather suggests
that preheating preferentially in the lower mass clusters may have
 T 2
helped to steepen the luminosity-temperature correlation from Lx
 T 2
Another probe of dark matter in reasonably luminous disks comes
from studying the kinematics of barred galaxies Debattista and Sell-
wood argued that a maximal disk is required eg for NGC 3198 in
order to maintain a self-gravitating bar Debattista  Sellwood 2000
On the other hand Kranz et al nd varying results for the disk mass
fraction by modelling the detailed kinematic structure for example the
unbarred galaxy NGC 4254 requires a submaximal disk Kranz Slyz
and Rix 2002
The colour-magnitude relation B-K versus K reveals another dif-
culty van den Bosch 2002 The more luminous galaxies the red-
der they are indicative of less vigorous recent star formation SEmi-
analytical disk models even when feedback is included give the inverse
correlation This is another manifestation of the overcooling problem
The oldest early-type galaxies are found to be the most massive and
these have the highest F e indicative of the shortest star forma-

tion time-scales The opposite trend is expected in hierarchical models

5 Proposed solutions
The baryon fraction in stars may be understood if approximately half
the baryons that initially cooled within the virial radius have been
expelled Supernova feedback seems incapable of driving such a wind in
the early gas-rich phase of galaxy formation because of the signicance
of cooling However there are indications that vigorous winds are seen
in the Lyman break galaxies as inferred from the inverse P Cygni
line proles in template spectra and from the Lyman alpha forest
suppression found within a Mpc or so of the Lyman break galaxies
In nearby galaxies where so-called superwinds are found the observed
mass outow rate is comparable to the star formation rate eg in NGC
253 Strickland et al 2002 Observations suggest that strong winds
can be driven from typical galaxies yet numerical simulations nd that
winds are stalled for the more massive halos
What physics has hitherto been omitted from the simulations The
simulations are gravity-driven Star formation may be in extreme sit-
uations pressure-driven This could result in strong positive feedback
via for example shock-triggered massive star formation and generate
enhanced rates of correlated supernovae that would in turn drive a
transient wind
Starbursts are known to drive winds One mechanism appeals to
bar formation A merger creates a transient bar The spin-down and
dissolution of this bar torques and accelerates the gas which responds
by an enhanced rate of dissipation and angular momentum loss for
example via cloud-cloud collisions Bars are known to drive luminous
starbursts and minor mergers may drive ultraluminous starbursts the
ultimate sources of superwinds
The gas-rich environment provides a plausible site for supermassive
black hole formation This phenomenon appears to occur contempora-
neously with spheroid formation as inferred from the remarkable corre-
lation between central black hole mass and spheroid velocity dispersion
SMBH-driven outows manifest as a SMBH-energized component of
the overall luminosity may be important in early phases of galaxy
formation At least one explanation of the observed correlation appeals
to outows as the self-regulatory mechanism
While the formation of structure in halos building up from clouds
of weakly interacting dark matter is reasonably well understood the
formation of the luminous components of galaxies is founded on sim-

plistic assumptions A more realistic treatment of star formation in
forming galaxies must ultimately modify many of the predictions that
are failing to adequately confront the observations
Feedback from supernovae is one solution that is being widely dis-
cussed Supernova remnants deposit substantial energy into the in-
terstellar medium and are responsible for the observed multiphase
structure of the interstellar gas Some nearby low mass star-forming
galaxies show a porous structure in the interstellar gas where many
overlapping shells and bubbles are seen that demonstrate that super-
nova input is playing an important role in pressurizing the interstellar
gas Some display an anti-correlation between X-ray and H emis-
sion indicative of supernova-driven bubbles The microphysics of the
interface between the supernova-heated gas and the cold interstellar
medium is inadequately resolved by the simulations Plausibly there
are surprises in store
Feedback reduces the eciency of star formation This is important
for understanding the longevity of disk star formation However at-
tempts to use feedback in the phase of disk formation have had mixed
success A basic problem is that feedback delays star formation if this
works too well all stars are young in contrast to what is found in
the outer parts of nearby disks such as M31 Numerical simulations
that incorporate feedback nd that disks are still too small although
possibly by only a factor of 2 Sommer-Larsen Gotz and Portinari
If eciency of star formation is to account for the observed colour-
magnitude relation then one needs a systematic reduction in eciency
of star formation with decreasing galaxy mass Some evidence for this
is found in the correlations between stellar surface brightness and total
stellar mass in the SDSS study of 80000 early and late-type galaxies
Kaumann et al 2002 In ellipticals such an eect would help to
simultaneously account for the trend of increasing F e with galaxy
mass if the most massive galaxies are the oldest and formed stars
most rapidly However no detailed implementation has been made of
the relevant physics in large part because one needs to incorporate a
multiphase interstellar medium
6 Analytic disk galaxy formation
The brute force computational approach will not resolve the outstand-
ing problems in disk galaxy formation What seems to be needed are
further analytical
insights that will allow renement of the simple
prescriptions for star formation One such approach has come from
kieltex 2022008 105 p8
Formation of Disks
studying turbulence-driven viscous evolution of dierentially rotating
disks Recent investigations of star formation suggest that turbulence
plays an important role in accounting for the longevity of star-forming
clouds and their fragmentation into stars The Jeans mass in a typical
interstellar cloud greatly exceeds the stellar mass range It is likely
that the gravitational instability of galaxy disks is a primary source of
interstellar cloud turbulent motions supplemented on small scales by
supernova feedback Of course these drivers of turbulence are coupled
together since the rates of star formation and star deaths are controlled
by global gravitational instability In eect dierential rotation is the
ultimate source of the turbulence
A promising hypothesis is that turbulent viscosity by regulating
the gas ow controls the star formation rate and indeed that the star
formation time-scale is given by the time-scale for the viscous transfer of
angular momentum Silk and Norman 1981 On the scale of molecular
clouds such an ansatz is reasonable since one has to shed angular
momentum in order to form stars Magnetic elds are the common
culprit in conventional star-forming clouds but in protogalactic disks
one most likely has to appeal to another source of angular momentum
transfer Turbulent viscosity is capable of fullling this role Indeed
the resulting disk has been shown to generically develop an exponential
density prole Lin and Pringle 1987 In infall models the initial an-
gular momentum prole determines the nal disk scale length if angular
momentum is conserved However as found in high resolution simula-
tions some 90 percent of the baryonic specic angular momentum is
lost to the dark halo and there is no preferred solution for disk sizes In
viscous disk models the scale length is set by the competition between
viscosity-driven star formation that freezes the scale length once stars
form and dynamical friction on the dark matter that competes for
the same angular momentum supply The characteristic viscous scale
is determined by the cloud mean free path between collisions itself
comparable to the disk instability scale that drives the turbulence and
in combination with the residual rotation rate provides the ultimate
constraint on disk scales
Another byproduct of the viscous disk model is the gas fraction
Silk 2001 The viscous redistribution time-scale and hence the star
formation time-scale is
t  tsf  r2
dgas
where  is the cloud mean free path of order the disk scale height
and gas is the cloud velocity dispersion Disk instability yields gas 
 The star formation eciency if determined by supernova feedback
and approximate conservation of momentum is   gasvSN  where
kieltex 2022008 105 p9
Joseph Silk
vSN is the specic supernova momentum per unit mass injected into
the interstellar medium Here vSN  ESN mSN vc where mSN is the
mass in stars per supernova and vc is the velocity of transition of a
remnant to approximate momentum conservation The characteristic
star formation time may then dened to be
tsf 
11
where r is the disk rotation rate at radius r Mr is the instanta-
neous stellar mass and Mgas is the gas mass A steady state is reached
in which the gas fraction is
gasvSN
and the disk scale length is
rd  qtsf 
Thus the disc scale depends both on cosmology and on local conditions
The inferred present epoch numbers are plausible for M  6 
M  3Myr and MgasM  01 Also one has
1010M one nds
now gas  10kms1 vSN  1000kms1 and   03kpc At disk
formation one expects that MgasM  1 tsf  109 yr and   1
kpc appropriate to the protodisk These values result in a stellar disk
scale-length rd  3 kpc It is encouraging that simple analytic estimates
come out with reasonable numbers for gas and stellar disk scales and
gas fraction Whether such a simple model survives incorporation into
3-dimensional simulations of disk formation in the presence of a live
dark matter halo and energetic winds remains of course to be seen
7 Spheroid formation
Spheroids are an integral component of practically all disk galaxies
Studies of spheroid formation are complicated by the fact that there is
no global theory of star formation even at the semi-empirical level that
works moderately well for cold gas disks
Small spheroids most likely form by secular evolution of bar-unstable
disks However it is not possible to form massive spheroids by secular
evolution Galaxy mergers are undoubtedly the major trigger for for-
mation both of massive spheroids in early-type disk galaxies and of
elliptical galaxies It has been realized from the earliest simulations of
mergers that gas-rich precursors are required in order to attain the
kieltex 2022008 105 p10
Formation of Disks
high central densities of massive spheroids The gas dissipates forms
stars that in turn self-enrich more gas ending up with the metal-rich
nuclei characteristic of massive ellipticals This must have happened
with high eciency since spheroidal stellar populations are character-
istically old The necessarily high star formation rate constitutes a star
burst dened simply by the requirement that the mean star formation
rate is inferred to have been much higher perhaps by two orders of
magnitude than the mass of stars divided by a Hubble time
Nearby starbursts are well studied Typically starbursts are rare
in the nearby universe but increasingly common at high redshift Star
formation rates of up to 1000 M yr1 are inferred The most extreme
star formation rates are invariably associated with evidence for an ongo-
ing merger Most of the star formation generated by gas concentration
triggered in a merger is shrouded by dust and most of the radiation
is absorbed and reemitted in the far infrared Simulations demonstrate
that the mergers of gas-rich galaxies eciently drive the gas into the
central kiloparsec of the merged galaxy by a powerful combination
of tidal torquing on the gas due to the merged transient stellar bar
that results from the merger which removes angular momentum and
compresses the gas followed by strong dissipation of energy by radiative
cooling of the gas
Ultraluminous infrared starbursts are likely to be the sites of ongo-
ing spheroid formation This conjecture is supported by near-infrared
observations of post-starburst galaxies where the characteristic de Vau-
couleurs proles found in spheroids can be recognized in the newly
formed stars
There is an intriguing complication Spheroids have been found to
be intimately linked with supermassive black holes The tight correla-
tion observed between black hole mass and spheroid velocity dispersion
covers the range of black hole masses 106 to 109 M and encompasses
stellar spheroids as small as that of the Milky Way  109 M to
those as massive as M87  1012 M The clear implication is that
the formation of spheroids and supermassive black holes was contem-
poraneous If the spheroid formed by a merger the strong central gas
enhancement provides an ideal environment for supermassive black hole
formation The enormous amount of binding energy released as the
SMBH formed would impact the protogalactic gaseous environment
as would the ensuing eects of energy released by infall into the newly
formed black hole Outows would be a natural outcome and these
could help stimulate further star formation
Observationally it is unclear what role quasar-like activity plays in
the energetics of the far-infrared and submillimeter galaxies that are
undergoing luminous starbursts In the nearby case of Arp 220 it is
kieltex 2022008 105 p11

apparent that star formation and buried quasars play comparable roles
in accounting for the observed luminosity
8 Conclusions
There seem to be two distinct modes of global star formation An
inecient quiescent mode that is self-regulated by feedback occurs
in galactic disks A violent ecient starburst mode is triggered and
fueled by merger-induced tidal torques and accounts for the formation
of the massive stellar spheroids The disk mode of star formation most
likely also accounts for the low mass spheroids which are generated
dynamically via secular evolution of disks
Semi-analytic galaxy formation modelling has not yet incorporated
the full richness of star formation phenomenology There are ve critical
issues currently confronting semi-analytic theory and improvements in
star formation modelling and the dynamical coupling of baryonic and
non-baryonic matter will be necessary to address most of them
 Perhaps the most innocuous of the problems is the overproduction
of substructure and in particular the predicted abundance of dwarf
galaxies This is likely to be resolved at least in part by early
photo-ionization at redshifts above 6 before the reionization of
the intergalactic medium was complete Early photo-ionization of
dwarfs with velocity dispersion less than about 30 kms suces
to eject most of the gas before the bulk of the star formation
has occurred Because this happens early there is a proximity
eect only the most widely separated dwarfs which experience
a lower UV ux retain their gas and survive as stellar systems
One can both account for the paucity of observed dwarfs and their
mean separations from the parent galaxies What is not yet clear
is whether the number of SMC-like systems predicted is consistant
with observations nor more seriously perhaps is whether recon-
ciling the low dwarf abundance in the Local Group allows one to
also understand the apparent surfeit of dwarfs observed in some
nearby galaxy clusters
 The baryon overcooling problem is more serious The factor of
about 2 excess predicted for disk baryons can be resolved either
by ejection or by hiding the gas Winds can occur if outows from
massive galaxies are stronger than predicted by simple disk mod-
elling and simulations The Lyman break galaxies possibly indicate
the eectiveness of early winds but it is likely that these galaxies
end up as E or S0 galaxies as inferred from their spatial clustering
kieltex 2022008 105 p12
Formation of Disks
Substantial amounts of gas could be hidden in the form of dense
cold clumps of H2 or even in diuse H2 in the outer disk where
H2 may be more readily hidden
 Disk scale lengths can possibly be explained via turbulent feed-
back Winds may play a role here too if the predominantly low
angular momentum gas which ends up in the central core is pref-
erentially expelled A supermassive black hole-driven outow may
provide a possible driver for the nuclear wind
 Disk colours and indeed spheroid colours present another dif-
culty as exemplied by the colour-magnitude relation Disks
whose global colours are characteristic of intermediate age pop-
ulations have stellar populations that are systematically too red
and too old at large masses For ellipticals the problem is some-
what dierent The colour-magnitude relation is driven primarily
by metallicity with there being little evidence for any signicant
age spread in cluster galaxies Vazdekis et al 2001 The stellar
populations are predominantly old Both massive and low mass
ellipticals have similar ages Either the low mass systems formed
stars earlier but less eciently hence reducing their eective age
or gas accretion occurred to produce a similar eect The alpha
element ratio enhancement for the cores of massive ellipticals sup-
ports an early and ecient duration of star formation for these
systems Field ellipticals and S0s however show a substantial age
spread
 The issue of a cusp in the dark matter prole represents a con-
tentious issue around which the observations have not yet con-
verged It may be that dynamical eects such as black hole merg-
ers provide the best means of scouring out the cusp The related
matter of dark matter concentration seems to vary between galax-
ies and there are hints that it varies between barred and unbarred
galaxies This suggests again that a complex dynamical history
may be partly to blame
