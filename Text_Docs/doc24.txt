In  many  sensory  systems  transmembrane  receptors  are  spatially  organized  in  large 
clusters  Such  arrangement  may  facilitate  signal  amplification  and  the  integration  of 
multiple stimuli However this organization likely also affects the kinetics of signaling 
since the cytoplasmic enzymes that modulate the activity of the receptors must localize to 
the  cluster  prior  to  receptor  modification  Here  we  examine  how  these  spatial 
considerations shape signaling dynamics at rest and in response to stimuli As a model 
system we use the chemotaxis pathway of Escherichia coli a canonical system for the 
study of how organisms sense respond and adapt to environmental stimuli In bacterial 
chemotaxis  adaptation  is  mediated  by  two  enzymes  that  localize  to  the  clustered 
receptors and modulate their activity through methylation-demethylation Using a novel 
stochastic  simulation  we  show  that  distributive  receptor  methylation  is  necessary  for 
successful adaptation to stimulus and also leads to large fluctuations in receptor activity 
in  the  steady  state    These  fluctuations  arise  from  noise  in  the  number  of  localized 
enzymes combined with saturated modification kinetics between the localized enzymes 
and the receptor substrate  An analytical model explains how saturated enzyme kinetics 
and  large  fluctuations  can  coexist  with  an  adapted  state  robust  to  variation  in  the 
expression  levels  of  the  pathway  constituents  a  key  requirement  to  ensure  the 
functionality of individual cells within a population  This contrasts with the well-mixed 
covalent modification system studied by Goldbeter and Koshland in which mean activity 
becomes  ultrasensitive  to  protein  abundances  when  the  enzymes  operate  at  saturation 
Large  fluctuations  in  receptor  activity  have  been  quantified  experimentally  and  may 
benefit the cell by enhancing its ability to explore empty environments and track shallow 
nutrient gradients Here we clarify the mechanistic relationship of these large fluctuations 
to  well-studied  aspects  of  the  chemotaxis  system  precise  adaptation  and  functional

Introduction 
High-resolution microscopy has revealed the exquisite spatial organization of signaling 
pathways and their molecular constituents Understanding the computations performed by 
biological  networks  therefore  requires  taking  the  spatiotemporal  organization  of  the 
reactants into account 1 One feature common to many signal transduction pathways is 
the clustering of receptors in the cell membrane This arrangement has been observed for 
diverse  receptor  types  2  such  as  bacterial  chemoreceptors  3-6  epidermal  growth 
factor  receptors  7  and  T  cell  antigen  receptors  8    Receptor  clustering  provides  a 
mechanism  for  controlling  the  sensitivity  910  and  accuracy  1112  of  a  signaling 
pathway Moreover by controlling which types of receptors participate in clusters a cell 
can achieve spatiotemporal control over the specificity of the signaling complexes  
While clustering receptors can tune the sensitivity and specificity of a signaling pathway 
organizing  receptors  into  clusters  also  imposes  novel  constraints  on  the  kinetics  of  the 
pathway    Temporal  modulations  of  the  activity  of  signaling  complexes  such  as 
adaptation  are  typically  achieved  via  posttranslational  modification  of  the  cytoplasmic 
tail of the receptors by various enzymes The localization of the receptor substrate into 
clusters implies that trafficking of enzymes between the cytoplasm and the cluster and 
between  receptors  within  a  cluster  is  likely  to  be  an  important  determinant  of  the 
dynamics of such modulations  Recent theoretical studies of the effect of the localization 
of  enzymes  and  substrates  on  signaling  kinetics  have  shown  that  spatiotemporal 
correlations  between  reactants  can  significantly  affect  the  signaling  properties  of  these 
pathways 13-15    
One  well-characterized  system  in  which  the  spatial  organization  of  receptors  plays  a 
significant role is the chemotaxis system of the bacterium Escherichia coli 16-18 E 
coli moves by performing a random walk alternating relatively straight runs with sudden 
changes of direction called tumbles  The probability to tumble is modulated by a two-
component system in which transmembrane receptors regulate the activity of a histidine 
kinase CheA which in turn phosphorylates the response regulator CheY Phosphorylated 
CheY rapidly diffuses through the cell and binds the flagellar motors to induce tumbling 
The tumbling rate decreases in response to chemical attractants and increases in response 
to repellants allowing the bacterium to navigate its environment  
Chemoreceptor  clustering  affects  both  signal  amplification  and  adaptation  to  persistent 
stimuli  which  together  enable  bacteria  to  remain  sensitive  to  over  five  orders  of 
magnitude  of  ligand  concentration  19    Signal  amplification  arises  from  allosteric 
interactions between clustered receptors 920-23 whereas adaptation is mediated by the 
activity of two enzymes CheR methylates inactive receptors thereby reactivating them 
while  CheB  demethylates  active  receptors  deactivating  them  This  arrangement 
implements an integral feedback mechanism 24 enabling kinase activity and therefore 
cell behavior to return to approximately the same stationary point following response to 
stimulus  2526  The  localization  of  enzymes  to  the  cluster  is  facilitated  by  a  high-
affinity  tether  site  present  on  most  receptors    This  tether  together  with  the  dense 
organization  of  the  cluster  enables  localized  enzymes  to  modify  multiple  receptors 
within a range known as an assistance neighborhood 27  Modeling efforts have shown 
that  assistance  neighborhoods  are  required  for  precise  adaptation  when  receptors  are 
strongly coupled 28 
Precise  adaptation  however  is  not  by  itself  sufficient  for  successful  chemotaxis  The 
dynamics of the adaptation process including the rate of receptor modification and the 
level  of  spontaneous  fluctuation  in  receptor  activity  are  also  critical  determinants  of 
chemotactic performance 29-35 Recent measurements of the dynamic localization of 
chemotaxis proteins have shown that the time scale of CheR and CheB localization to the 
receptor cluster is comparable to the time scale of adaptation 36 and therefore expected 
to  affect  the  dynamics  significantly    Moreover  dense  clustering  may  enable  localized 
enzymes  to  perform  a  random  walk  over  the  receptor  lattice  without  returning  to  the 
cytoplasmic  bulk  a  proposed  process  termed  brachiation  37  that  may  lead  to  more 
efficient receptor modification 
Here we analyze how the spatiotemporal localization of the adaptation enzymes  to the 
receptor cluster affects the dynamics of the adaptation process First we build a stochastic 
simulation of the chemotaxis system taking into account the organization of the receptors 
into large clusters 46 the slow exchange of enzymes between the cytoplasm and the 
clusters  36  enzyme  brachiation  37  and  assistance  neighborhoods  272838  This 
model  quantitatively  recapitulates  experimental  observations  of  the  magnitude  of  the 
spontaneous fluctuations in single cells 39-42 and the kinetics of adaptation averaged 
over  multiple  cells  43    Notably  while  localized  enzymes  in  this  model  operate  at 
saturation the output of the system nonetheless remains robust to cell-to-cell variation in 
enzyme expression levels 44 in contrast to the covalent modification system studied by 
Goldbeter  and  Koshland  12  We  therefore  resolve  the  question  of  how  large 
spontaneous fluctuations might coexist with a robust mean output in the system 30  We 
interpret these results in the second part of the paper using a mean-field analytical model 
to  examine  the  molecular  mechanisms  underlying  these  features  and  their  relation  to 
receptor clustering 
Results 
Numerical model of adaptation dynamics in a chemoreceptor cluster 
We used the rule-based simulation tool NFsim 45 to create a stochastic model of the 
bacterial chemotaxis system that accounts for the organization of chemoreceptors into a 
large dense hexagonal lattice 4  Like the Gillespie algorithm NFsim computes exact 
stochastic trajectories but avoids the full enumeration of the reaction network which can 
undergo combinatorial explosion by using rules to generate reaction events 45  In the 
simulation  each  chemoreceptor  dimer  is  represented  by  an  object  with  one  tether  site 
one modification site and a methylation level ranging from 0 to 8  We model a single 
contiguous  lattice  consisting  typically  of  7200  dimers  although  we  consider  different 
sizes as well  The structure of the lattice is fully specified by enumerating for each dimer 
its  six  nearest  neighboring  dimers    Receptor  cooperativity  is  modeled  using  Monod-
Wyman-Changeux MWC complexes consisting of six receptor dimers Fig 1A  The 
activity a of each signaling complex depends on the methylation and ligand-binding state 
Fig  1  Adaptation  reactions  on  the  chemoreceptor  lattice    A  Bacterial  chemoreceptors  assemble  into 
trimers of dimers that organize to form a dense hexagonal lattice  Most chemoreceptors have tether and

Receptor  modification  occurs  through  the  enzymes  CheR  and  CheB  which  are  each 
modeled as having two binding sites one specific to the receptor tether and one specific 
to  the  modification  site    In  the  model  CheR  and  CheB  dynamically  bind  and  unbind 
both of these sites  CheR participates in the reactions illustrated in Fig 1B  The possible 
states of the enzyme are free and dispersed in the cytoplasmic bulk or bound to one or 
both of the tether and modification sites  Enzymes in the bulk localize to the cluster by 
binding either the tether site or the modification site directly  The time scales of these 
binding reactions Fig 1B blue arrows are the slowest in the present model 15s for 
localization  through  tether  binding  as  measured  36  and  longer  for  modification  site 
binding reflecting the lower affinity of enzymes for the modification site  Once bound to 
the  tether  or  modification  site  an  enzyme  may  bind  the  modification  site  or  tether 
respectively of the receptor to which it is already bound Fig 1B red arrows or any of 
its six nearest neighbors green arrows Therefore the assistance neighborhood consists 
of  seven  dimers  consistent  with  measurements  27    Assistance  neighborhoods  are 
unique  for  each  receptor  dimer  and  therefore  overlap    Accordingly  in  the  simulation 
individual receptor dimers participate in multiple assistance neighborhoods  Since these 
reactions  are  confined  to  small  volumes  given  by  the  5  nm  tether  radius  46  they 
proceed at high rates 1-10 ms time scales see Text S1  The activity-dependent binding 
rate of CheR to the modification site is proportional to 1 - a while the rates of all other 
CheR reactions are taken to be independent of activity  Phosphorylated CheB CheB-P 
participates  in  completely  analogous  reactions  except  that  the  rate  of  binding  the 
modification  site  is  proportional  to  a  CheB  phosphorylation  proceeds  at  a  rate 
proportional to the activity of the receptor cluster Text S1  For simplicity we assume 
that  only  CheB-P  can  localize  to  the  receptor  cluster  since  its  affinity  for  the  tether  is 
much higher than that of CheB 47  
Our study is the first to incorporate enzyme brachiation 37 assistance neighborhoods 
2838  cooperative  amplification  of  the  input  signal  92223  activity-dependent 
adaptation kinetics 25 and a large contiguous receptor cluster into a single model  This 
model  specifically  extends  two  earlier  models    The  first  of  these  models  considered 
enzyme  brachiation  on  a  large  receptor  cluster  37  but  did  not  include  activity-
dependent  kinetics  receptor  cooperativity  or  any  modification  of  the  receptors    The 
second  of  these  models  included  activity-dependent  kinetics  cooperativity  and 
assistance  neighborhoods  2838  but  excluded  enzyme  brachiation  and  limited  the 
system size to a single MWC complex consisting of 19 dimers  Here we take advantage 
of the flexibility and efficiency of NFsim to examine how all of these processes together 
determine the dynamics of adaptation  
Calibration of the model parameters is discussed in the Supporting Text S1  Supporting 
Tables S1 and S2 present the full set of simulation parameters  We note that our model 
includes only Tar receptors  This choice enabled us to compare our model directly to 
measurements of the adaptation kinetics 43 performed on cells lacking receptors other 
than  Tar    These  measurements  were  obtained  by  exposing  cells  to  time-dependent 
exponential ramps of methyl-aspartate a protocol that we modeled in silico Fig 2A and 
Fig S2 to verify the calibration of the kinetics of our model  In the remainder of the 
paper we denote this calibrated model as the reference model M1  
Distributive methylation leads to precise adaptation  
Together with the dense organization of the receptor lattice the presence of the tether site 
on  each  receptor  gives  rise  to  assistance  neighborhoods  27  and  possibly  enzyme 
brachiation 37   During the brachiation process enzymes successively bind and unbind 
the tethers and modification sites on different neighboring receptors enabling them to 
perform  a  random  walk  over  the  lattice  without  returning  to  the  bulk  Both  assistance 
neighborhoods  and  enzyme  brachiation  should  increase  the  distributivity  of  the 
methylation  process  meaning  that  sequential  demethylation  events  catalyzed  by  a 
single enzyme will tend to take place on different receptors  In a distributive scheme

therefore an enzyme will tend to modify multiple receptors during its residence time on 
the cluster  Moreover it will tend to methylate receptors in an even fashion rather than 
sequentially  modifying  a  single  receptor  until  it  is  fully  demethylated    Since 
brachiation enables some randomization of enzyme position between methylation events 
it should lead to a more distributive methylation process   
To  investigate  how  distributivity  affects  adaptation  we  compared  our  reference  model 
M1 which includes assistance neighborhoods and brachiation to a model in which the 
binding  of  tethered  enzymes  to  the  modification  sites  of  neighboring  receptors  and 
modification  site-bound  enzymes  to  neighboring  tethers  is  not  allowed  denoted  M2 
Table 1  Disabling these reactions both removes assistance neighborhoods and prevents 
enzyme  brachiation  As  a  result  methylation  is  more  processive    In  this  scheme  an 
enzyme remains bound to and modifies only a single receptor during its residence time in 
the  cluster    This  scheme  increases  the  probability  that  CheR  and  CheB  will  become 
bound  to  receptors  with  high  or  low  methylation  levels  respectively    Consequently 
enzymes will tend to have low affinity for their local modification sites and modification 
will  proceed  in  an  inefficient  manner  compared  to  a  distributive  scheme    In  M2 
adaptation to both small 5 M and large 1 mM steps of the attractant methyl-aspartate 
becomes  much  slower  Fig  2B  light  gray  than  in  the  reference  model  M1  Fig  2B 
black  Precise adaptation is also severely compromised for the large stimulus  
We  also  consider  the  case  in  which  enzyme  brachiation  is  made  less  efficient  but 
adaptational assistance is not eliminated  To examine this intermediate model M3 we 
decreased  the  unbinding  rates  from  the  tether  drb
  relative  to  M1    As  a  result  more 
methylation  events  occur  before  an  enzyme  moves  on  the  lattice    This  leads  to  less 
efficient  brachiation  than  in  M1  but  preserves  assistance  neighborhoods    As  a  result 
adaptation to the large stimulus is less precise compared to M1 but more precise than M2

The  picture  that  emerges  is  that  the  distributivity  of  the  modification  process  is  an 
important  determinant  of  the  precision  of  adaptation    Adaptational  assistance  and

that  the  ability  of  tethered  CheR  and  CheB  to  modify  several  receptors  within  an 
assistance  neighborhood  is  necessary  for  precise  adaptation  within  a  single  MWC 
complex  2838  In  our  simulations  as  in  these  previous  studies  increasing  the 
distributivity of receptor methylation reduces the time CheR and CheB spend bound to 
highly  methylated  and  demethylated  receptors  respectively  Consequently 
methylation rate in distributive models is largely independent of the methylation levels of 
individual receptors resulting in more precise adaptation Additionally demethylation 
rates  are  higher  than  in  the  more  processive  schemes  because  the  enzymes  spend  less 
time  interacting  with  receptors  that  are  already  highly  methylated  or  demethylated 
Indeed plotting the rate of methylation after the step stimulus for the three simulations 
depicted  in  Fig  2B  bottom  panel  indicates  that  it  is  highest  in  the  most  distributive 
model M1 Fig S7 and Text S1 
Distributive methylation leads to large steady-state fluctuations 
Experiments and modeling efforts strongly suggest that the adaptation mechanism of the 
bacterial chemotaxis system introduces slow spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of 
the  receptor-kinase  complex  with  a  standard  deviation  of  5-10  of  the  mean  3339-
424849  These  fluctuations  are  thought  to  lead  to  long-tailed  distributions  of  run 
durations  3950  and  may  enhance  navigation  in  shallow  gradients  and  exploration 
3032333539 Since distributivity affects the kinetics of adaptation it is also likely to 
affect  the  spontaneous  fluctuations  of  the  system  Fig  2C  compares  the  level  of 
fluctuation in receptor activity about the unstimulated steady-state level for each model at 
different  expression  levels  of  CheR    The  model  M1  exhibits  fluctuations  of  the  same 
order  as  those  measured  experimentally  particularly  at  low  CheR  levels  for  which  the 
standard deviation a of fluctuations exceeds 7 of the mean activity a0  Notably the 
magnitude of this noise is reduced when receptor modification is made less distributive in 
models  M2  and  M3  These  results  suggest  that  the  features  required  for  successful 
adaptation  assistance  neighborhoods  and  brachiation  also  lead  to  experimentally 
observed  levels  of  signaling  noise  The  mechanism  underlying  these  relations  will  be 
discussed in a later section with insights provided by an analytical model  
Cells within an isogenic wild-type population are known to exhibit significant cell-to-cell 
variability in the level of signaling noise 3339-41  To what extent does this variability 
arise from cell-to-cell variability in the expression levels of the chemotaxis proteins  Our 
simulations of the model M1 indicate that the level of signaling noise is sensitive to the 
relative amounts of CheR and CheB in the cell Fig 2C  However the multicistronic 
organization  of  cheR  and  cheB  on  the  chromosome  ensures  that  the  ratio  of  CheR  to 
CheB  is  approximately  conserved  in  each  cell  within  a  wild-type  population  due  to 
cotranscription 4451  Therefore variability in signaling noise levels must arise largely 
from correlated variation in the expression levels of the chemotaxis proteins  Using our 
stochastic simulation of enzyme dynamics on the receptor lattice M1 we investigated 
the effects of covarying the number of CheR CheB and chemoreceptors  We sampled 
cells from across a population in which CheR CheB and chemoreceptor counts all vary

effects  of  concerted  variation  in  protein  levels  we  ignored  intrinsic  noise  thereby 
preserving the ratio of CheRCheBreceptors  We found that the level of signaling noise 
varies widely between each sampled cell between 3 and 10 of the mean Fig 3A This 
degree of variation in signaling noise levels agrees well with measurements performed 
across  a  wild-type  population  4041    Additionally  we  found  that  cells  with  low 
expression  levels  of  the  chemotaxis  proteins  are  predicted  to  exhibit  the  large 
fluctuations 10 of the mean level  Consequently we expect cells with high levels of 
signaling noise to be present even in populations across which the CheR to CheB ratio is 
maintained at the single cell level  
High levels of signaling noise occur around a robust adapted level 
In  previous  models  of  the  chemotaxis  system  in  which  enzyme  localization  is  not 
considered the slow spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of the system were traced 
back to the ultrasensitive nature of the methylation and demethylation reactions which 
were assumed to operate near saturation 30 This mechanism however is insufficient to 
explain  the  large  magnitude  of  the  noise  observed  experimentally  in  individual  cells 
Indeed using a stochastic simulation of a recent representative analytical model Model 
B1 in which the authors calibrated the rates of methylation-demethylation using direct 
measurements of the average response of the receptor activity to ramps of attractant 43 
we observe at most 2-3 relative noise for the individual cell Fig 3B The model B1 
incorporates activity-dependent binding of the enzymes to the modification sites but does 
not  consider  any  aspects  of  enzyme  localization  via  tether  binding  Table  1  
Additionally while this model includes cooperative receptor-receptor interactions using a 
MWC  model  given  by  Eq  13  as  for  M1  it  considers  neither  the  geometry  of  the 
receptor  cluster  nor  the  resulting  features  of  adaptational  assistance  and  enzyme 
brachiation   Higher noise levels can be obtained in this model by increasing the enzyme-
substrate  affinities  tenfold  Model  B2  These  higher  affinities  however  result  in  a 
steady-state activity that is ultrasensitive to total enzyme counts Fig 3C light gray  In 
this  case  the  addition  or  subtraction  of  only  a  few  adaptation  enzymes  in  the  cell  is 
sufficient to switch the system between the fully active and fully inactive states  This 
scenario is biologically unacceptable since small fluctuations in gene expression across a 
population would lead to large numbers of non-functional cells with either fully active or 
inactive receptors at steady state  Parameter values for models B1 and B2 are given in 
Tables S4 and S6 
Interestingly  in  our  model  accounting  for  the  localization  of  enzymes  to  the  receptor 
cluster  large  fluctuations  around  the  steady  state  activity  are  present  even  though  the 
mean activity remains relatively robust to changes in enzyme counts  Fig 3B shows the 
dependence  of  the  steady-state  fluctuations  in  M1  on  total  CheR  count  with  all  other 
parameters fixed  M1 exhibits activity fluctuations that exceed 7 of the mean value a0 
for low CheR counts and are significantly larger than those of the model B1 for all CheR 
values  While the noise level is high the mean receptor activity at steady state a0 is 
only modestly sensitive to changes in the total CheR count Fig 3C black  The specific 
features  enabling  the  coexistence  of  large  fluctuations  with  a  robust  steady  state  are 
discussed in a later section with reference to an analytical model 
Finally we compare the noise levels predicted by the models M1 and B1 across a cell 
population    When  cell-to-cell  variability  in  receptor  and  enzyme  counts  is  taken  into 
account we observe that B1 which does not account for receptor clustering or enzyme 
localization exhibits insufficiently large fluctuations aa0  4 across the entirety of 
the  population  Fig  3A    In  contrast  M1  exhibits  levels  of  noise  similar  to  those

To  investigate  the  mechanisms  underlying  our  numerical  results  we  constructed  an 
approximate  model  that  can  be  solved  analytically  Here  we  provide  a  mathematical 
derivation  of  the  model  Analysis  of  the  adaptation  mechanism  using  this  model  is 
provided in the next section  
At the heart of this model is a covalent modification scheme that describes the kinetics of 
receptor  methylation  by  CheR  and  CheB  similar  in  form  to  previous  models 
1225305354  In order to modify the receptors however we require that CheR and 
CheB  be  localized  to  the  receptor  cluster  by  being  bound  to  the  tether  site    In  this 
treatment CheR may exist in three states free and dispersed in the cytoplasmic bulk R 
bound only to the tethering site of a receptor R and bound to both the tether site and 
modification  site  of  receptors   RT     The  notation  for  the  states   Bp Bp
T   of 
phosphorylated CheB is analogous Unphosphorylated CheB is assumed not to interact 
with the receptors and therefore only exists in the bulk B  For simplicity we assume 
that enzymes in the bulk always bind the higher-affinity tether sites on the receptors prior 
to  binding  the  modification  sites    Since  the  model  includes  reactions  occurring  in 
multiple volumes and will later be used for stochastic calculations all molecular species 
below are quantified by number rather than concentration  Therefore the binding rates as 
written implicitly include a factor of the inverse of the reaction volume  In the model

Eqs  3  4  employ  a  mean-field  approximation  by  assuming  that  the  activity  of  the 
receptor  whose  modification  site  is  to  be  bound  is  equal  to  the  mean  activity  of  all 
receptors in the cell a  This assumption makes the methylation process in this model 
fully  distributive    Therefore  the  mean-field  model  represents  the  limit  of  a  single 
maximally large assistance neighborhood encompassing all receptors or infinitely fast 
brachiation in which enzymes completely randomize their position on the lattice between 
methylation events  Relaxing this assumption requires a more detailed analytical model 
which is explored in the Supporting Text S1

Two important features can be noted from the form of Eqs 8-10  First Eqs 9 and 
10  emphasize  that  unbinding  from  the  receptor  lattice  is  a  two-step  process    Since 
CheR has higher affinity for the modification site as activity decreases the overall rate of 
CheR unbinding the lattice and returning to the bulk decreases accordingly  Additionally 
a  smaller  value  of  Kr  which  denotes  higher  affinity  of  the  localized  enzyme  for  the 
modification site leads to slower overall rates of unbinding   The argument for CheB-P 
unbinding is analogous  Second since Eq 8 depends only on the mean activity of the 
system and not on methylation or stimulus levels the analytical model exhibits precise 
adaptation  This property follows from the mean field assumption or equivalently the 
assumption of fully distributive kinetics 
Using  this  analytical  model  we  next  examine  the  mechanisms  underlying  the  key 
observations made using numerical simulations and argue that 1 large fluctuations in 
receptor  activity  are  primarily  due  to  noise  in  localized  enzyme  counts  amplified  by  a 
methylation process ultrasensitive to these counts 2 a distributive methylation scheme 
increases  signaling  noise  by  increasing  the  ultrasensitivity  of  this  process  3  the 
localized  enzymes  work  at  saturation  without  causing  the  mean  activity  to  be 
ultrasensitive with respect to total enzyme expression levels  This result contrasts with 
the covalent modification scheme studied by Goldbeter and Koshland 12

The analytical model derived above predicts large fluctuations in receptor activity Fig 
4A  black  similar  to  those  predicted  by  the  stochastic  simulation  M1    This  level  of 
signaling noise is significantly higher at all CheR levels than the level predicted when 
enzyme localization is not taken into account Fig 4A gray analytical version of model 
B1 43 The high level of intracellular signaling noise in this system arises from three 
key features   
First since the total numbers of CheR and CheB are small 52 the relative variation in 
the number of localized enzymes due to Poisson statistics is large  The overall rates of 
methylation  and  demethylation  are  therefore  highly  variable  in  time    Second  these 
fluctuations in localized enzyme counts occur at sufficiently slow time scales 36 to not 
be  filtered  out  by  the  methylation  process    The  possibility  of  slow  fluctuations  in  the 
number  of  tethered  enzymes  leading  to  increased  fluctuation  in  receptor  activity  was 
previously noted using a model of a single MWC complex 38  Third the interaction 
between the localized enzymes and the substrate occurs at saturation  Since the binding 
of  the  localized  enzymes  to  the  receptor  modification  site  is  activity-dependent  this 
interaction takes the same form as the covalent modification system studied by Goldbeter 
and Koshland 12 as can be seen from Eq 8  Therefore we may analyze the localized 
enzyme-receptor interaction in the same terms  Since a localized enzyme is confined to 
the  tether  radius  the  effective  local  substrate  concentration  is  high  and  binding  to  the 
modification site proceeds at a fast rate Therefore Kr Kb  1 and following Goldbeter 
and  Koshland  the  steady-state  output  a0  has  ultrasensitive  dependence  on  the  ratio  of 
localized CheR to CheB-P Fig 4B steep curve  This steep relationship suggests that 
the  output  of  the  system  is  in  general  highly  susceptible  to  changes  in  the  ratio  of 
localized CheR to CheB-P and consequently fluctuations in this ratio are the primary 
source of noise in the output  In the limit in which methylation is fast relative to enzyme 
localization dmdt  0 Eq 8 yields  a  a RTot
  In this limit receptor activity is 
a  function  of  only  the  ratio  of  the  localized  adaptation  enzymes  corresponding  to  the 
steep  curve  of  Fig  4B  Likewise  the  variance  in  receptor  activity  becomes 
aa  da0 d RTot
     Therefore  when  the  catalytic  step  is  fast 
relative to enzyme localization fluctuations in the localized enzyme ratio are amplified 
by exactly this steep curve  This limit case is relevant for understanding the behavior of 
our analytic and numerical models in which the rates of enzyme localization are slow 
relative to all other rates in the system

We may also show that fluctuations in the number of localized CheR and CheB are the 
dominant  noise  sources  in  the  system  without  assuming  dmdt    0    To  illustrate  this 
point we use the analytical model to decompose the total variance aa of the receptor

This  same  mechanism  underlies  the  observed  large  fluctuations  in  the  stochastic

versus  the  ratio  of  mean  localized  CheR  to  mean  localized  CheB-P  obtained  from 
simulation  by  varying  only  the  total  CheR  count    As  in  the  analytical  model  this 
relationship is highly ultrasensitive  To illustrate the dependence between fluctuations in 
the  localized  enzyme  ratio  and  fluctuations  in  receptor  activity  the  inset  of  Fig  4C 
displays 500s time traces of receptor activity and the ratio of localized CheR to localized 
CheB-P taken from simulation  The correlation between the two series is apparent and 
consistent  with  activity  fluctuations  arising  from  variability  in  the  number  of  tethered 
enzymes   
In summary clustering of the receptors leads to a high density of modification sites for 
the enzymes localized at the cluster This results in saturated ultrasensitive kinetics of the 
covalent  modification  reactions  which  strongly  amplify  the  noise  due  to  the  slow 
exchange of enzymes between the cluster and the bulk  
Relation  between  distributive  receptor  modification  and  high  levels  of  signaling 
In the analytical model large fluctuations in receptor activity result from the high affinity 
of localized enzymes for the modification site  Since all receptors in the analytical model 
are assumed to have the same activity this affinity is entirely characterized by the small 
values of the constants Kr and Kb  In the numerical models in contrast the binding of 
enzymes  to  individual  receptor  dimers  within  MWC  complexes  of  varying  levels  of 
activity  is  explicitly  simulated    Consequently  the  affinity  of  the  enzymes  for  the 
modification  site  depends  not  just  on  the  values  of  Kr  and  Kb  as  derived  from  the 
binding unbinding and catalytic rates in the simulation but also on the distribution of 
CheR  and  CheB  within  complexes  of  different  activities    If  enzymes  tend  to  become 
localized  within  regions  of  the  cluster  for  which  they  have  low  binding  affinity  eg 
CheR  within  a  highly  methylated  region  we  expect  the  ultrasensitive  dependence  of 
activity on the ratio of localized enzymes Fig 4C to be reduced  This effect may be 
thought of as increasing the effective values of Kr and Kb   
Adaptational assistance and brachiation mitigate this effect to some extent by enabling 
localized  enzymes  to  sample  a  number  of  receptors  during  their  residence  time  in  the 
cluster  A higher rate of sampling indicates that a given enzyme samples a larger fraction 
of the cluster between subsequent methylation events and therefore corresponds to more 
distributive  methylation  kinetics    A  potentially  analogous  situation  has  been  studied 
theoretically for a MAP kinase cascade 13 In this system slowly diffusing enzymes 
tended  to  rebind  the  same  substrate  molecule  multiple  times  leading  to  a  processive 
modification scheme  Faster diffusion enabled the enzymes to randomize their positions 
between  modification  events  corresponding  to  distributive  modification    In  the  MAP 
kinase study faster diffusion led to an ultrasensitive dependence of the output on enzyme 
levels  Is a similar mechanism at work in the chemoreceptor cluster 
For our numerical models we quantified the rates at which enzymes sampled different 
unique receptors within the cluster and found that this rate was between 4 and 13-fold 
smaller  for  the  more  processive  models  M2  and  M3  than  for  the  reference  model  M1 
Table S7 Accordingly the steady-state activity in the more processive models M2 and 
M3 is also less dependent on the ratio of localized CheR to CheB-P than in M1 Fig 4D  
Since this relationship effectively amplifies fluctuations in the ratio of localized enzymes 
this decreased steepness leads to lower signaling noise levels in these more processive 
models  as  seen  previously  Fig  2C  For  further  details  regarding  the  comparison 
between simulations and the analytical model see Supporting Text S1  We conclude that 
a distributive methylation scheme leads to higher signaling noise levels by increasing the 
overall affinity of the localized enzymes for the modification site substrate 
Localized  enzymes  may  work  at  saturation  without  compromising  robustness  to 
cell-to-cell variability in total enzyme expression levels

The  mean  steady-state  activity  for  the  analytical  model  with  enzyme  localization  is 
plotted in Fig 4B as a function of the ratio of both localized and total across the entire 
cell  adaptation  enzymes  RTot
  and  RTotBTot    While  the  activity  is  highly 
ultrasensitive with respect to the localized enzyme ratio its sensitivity to the total enzyme 
ratio is significantly less and comparable to the model B1  Therefore the mean steady-
state activity of the system a0 is robust to changes in the total CheR to CheB ratio caused 
by  noisy  gene  expression    This  result  is  somewhat  surprising  because  in  the  classic 
covalent modification system studied by Goldbeter and Koshland 12 saturated enzyme-
substrate  interactions  always  lead  to  a  steady-state  activity  that  is  ultrasensitive  to  the 
total CheR to CheB ratio  
In Eq 8 which we may analyze in the same manner as the Goldbeter-Koshland system 
the sensitivity of the steady-state activity a0 with respect to the ratio of localized CheR to 
CheB is determined solely by the constants Kr Kb that characterize the probability that a 
localized enzyme will be bound to a modification site  Small values of these constants 
lead  to  saturated  kinetics  and  ultrasensitivity  of  the  steady-state  activity  to  the  ratio  of 
localized  CheR  to  CheB    Our  model  differs  from  the  Goldbeter-Koshland  system 
however in that in our model these constants only partially determine the sensitivity of a0 
to the ratio of total CheR to CheB  The sensitivity of the system to the total enzyme ratio 
is also determined by the rates at which cytoplasmic enzymes localize to the cluster and 
at which localized enzymes return to the bulk Since the rates  ar
  at which enzymes 
localize  to  the  cluster  are  slow  36  the  effective  affinities  of  the  enzymes  for  the 
modification sites are reduced even though the affinities of enzymes already localized at 
the cluster are high 
The  steady-state  solutions  to  Eqs  8-10  quantify  how  the  mean  steady-state  activity 
depends  on  the  total  enzyme  counts  RTot  and  BTot    Solving  Eqs  9  and  10  for  the

localized  enzymes  binding  the  modification  site  Text  S1    Second  we  note  that  the

compensate  for  small  Kb    Robustness  therefore  likely  arises  from  the  slow  kinetics  of 
tether  binding    The  final  consideration  is  that  measurements  36  indicate  that  the 
number  of  cytoplasmic  and  localized  enzymes  are  comparable  and  therefore  that  the 
forward and reverse rates of Eqs 9 and 10 are roughly equal  This condition not only 
leads to comparable numbers of localized and cytoplasmic enzymes but also indicates 
that the rates of tether binding and unbinding fall in the regime in which the steady-state

Discussion  
Chemotactic bacteria are able to navigate chemical gradients with strengths ranging over 
five orders of magnitude 19  This remarkable capability results from the capacity of the 
system to amplify small input signals while adapting to a wide range of concentrations of 
persistent  stimulus  The  cooperative  receptor-receptor  interactions  that  amplify  input 
signals  are  facilitated  by  the  formation  of  large  receptor  clusters  structures  that  are 
strongly  conserved  across  bacterial  species  5    Adaptation  to  stimulus  requires  the 
efficient recruitment of cytoplasmic enzymes to these clusters which is achieved through 
the presence of a high-affinity enzyme-tethering site on most receptors  These tethers 
together  with  the  dense  structure  of  the  receptor  lattice  give  rise  to  assistance 
neighborhoods 27 and possibly enzyme brachiation 37  These features increase the 
distributivity of methylation decreasing the likelihood that enzymes become localized in 
neighborhoods  within  which  they  have  low  binding  affinity  and  therefore  act 
inefficiently   
Building  on  previous  work  that  showed  assistance  neighborhoods  were  necessary  for 
precise adaptation in a single strongly coupled signaling complex 2838 we found that 
assistance  neighborhoods  and  enzyme  brachiation  contributed  to  precise  adaptation  to 
stimulus  We further linked distributive methylation to the presence of signaling noise in 
the  output  and  showed  how  high  signaling  noise  may  coexist  with  a  mean  level  of 
receptor activity that is robust to changes in the ratio of the adaptation enzymes  This 
ratio  is  not  exactly  conserved  across  populations    Consequently  if  the  mean  activity 
were not sufficiently robust the ultrasensitivity of the flagellar motor 5960 would lead 
to  a  significant  fraction  of  nonfunctional  cells  permanently  in  the  running  or  tumbling 
state      This  robustness  to  the  ratio  of  adaptation  enzymes  occurs  even  though  the 
localized  enzymes  work  in  the  saturated  regime    This  scheme  is  not  possible  for  the 
simpler  covalent  modification  system  studied  by  Goldbeter  and  Koshland  in  which 
saturated enzyme kinetics always corresponds to ultrasensitivity to the enzyme ratio  
The  mechanism  described  here  is  not  necessarily  restricted  solely  to  the  bacterial 
chemotaxis system  The analytical model presented in this study describes generally an 
extension  of  the  Goldbeter-Koshland  12  motif  in  which  enzymes  transition  between 
active and inactive states whether by localization to the substrate prior to modification 
as  in  the  bacterial  chemotaxis  model  or  by  chemical  activation  of  the  enzyme    This 
simplified  model  captures  the  essential  features  underlying  large  fluctuations  slow 
enzyme  activation  relative  to  the  modification  rate  saturated  kinetics  between  the 
activated enzyme and the substrate and distributive modification  While the kinetics of 
activated  enzyme  and  substrate  may  be  saturated  the  robustness  of  the  system  to  the 
overall  expression  levels  of  the  enzymes  may  be  preserved  if  the  enzyme  activation 
localization  rate  is  sufficiently  small  relative  to  the  deactivation  delocalization  rate 
The effects of enzyme localization and the relationship between rapid enzyme rebinding 
and  processivity  have  been  considered  in  studies  of  MAP  kinase  cascades    A  recent 
study of the mating response in yeast 61 discusses a mechanism in which the kinase 
Fus3  and  phosphatase  Ptc1  bind  a  docking  site  on  the  substrate  Ste5  prior  to 
modification 
  Since  the  docked  enzymes  operate  at  saturation  the  system  is 
ultrasensitive  to  changes  in  the  number  of  recruited  enzymes  similar  to  the 
chemoreceptor-enzyme  system  discussed  in  this  work    Unlike  the  chemotaxis  system 
however yeast exploits these saturated kinetics to produce a switch-like response in the 
steady state  The theoretical work of Takahashi et al 13 also considers the MAP kinase 
system  using  it  as  a  model  to  explore  the  role  of  enzyme  diffusion  in  determining 
whether substrate modification is processive or distributive  The authors conclude that 
slow diffusion which causes the enzyme to bind and phosphorylate the same substrate 
molecule repeatedly can effectively convert a distributive mechanism into a processive 
one reducing the sensitivity of the system  The same effect figures prominently in our 
model  of  the  bacterial  chemotaxis  system  but  in  the  opposite  regime  in  which  the 
brachiation process serves to randomize enzyme positions between methylation events  
Future studies of the bacterial chemotaxis system may further clarify the role of enzyme 
brachiation  in  adaptation    Different  configurations  of  clustered  receptors  from  that 
considered here such as less dense clusters that have been shown to reduce cooperativity 
62 or larger numbers of significantly smaller clusters 63 could hinder the ability of 
localized enzymes to visit a large number of unique receptors In these cases our results 
suggest  that  signaling  noise  would  be  reduced  Interestingly  brachiation  may  be 
particularly important when considering cluster structure within local adaptation models 
64  In  these  models  receptors  of  different  types  respond  specifically  to  different 
stimuli  Consequently successful adaptation may depend on the ability of the adaptation 
enzymes  to  localize  efficiently  to  responsive  receptors  Brachiation  may  be  critical  for 
such  efficient  localization  particularly  when  considering  the  adaptation  of  low 
abundance receptors to their specific stimuli    
introducing  only  minimal  deleterious  effects 
While  many  systems  benefit  from  minimizing  signaling  noise  studies  of  bacterial 
chemotaxis have shown that noise may increase the performance of the system in sparse 
environments  while 
  In  empty 
environments  signaling  noise  may  lead  to  faster  cellular  exploration  to  locate  nutrient 
sources more efficiently 323339  Signaling noise has also been shown theoretically to 
increase  tracking  performance  in  shallow  gradients  323335    These  results  are 
consistent with a picture of the chemotaxis system being not purely a signal transduction 
system  for  which  minimizing  noise  would  typically  be  desirable  but  also  a  feedback 
system in which the output controls the sampling of the input 
Methods 
Receptor activation

NFsim implementation of the receptor lattice model 
NFsim 1 is a rule-based stochastic simulator of chemical reaction networks built on the 
BioNetGen  language  2    It  is  designed  to  efficiently  simulate  systems  in  which 
molecules may exist in large numbers of states and in which these states affect the rates 
of the reactions in which molecules participate  To illustrate the problem we consider 
the case of a bacterial chemoreceptor in a MWC signaling complex  The rate of CheR 
binding to the modification site depends on 1 whether the receptor modification site is 
occupied by CheR or CheB 2 whether the enzyme active site is occupied by CheR or 
CheB  3  whether  the  enzyme  is  tethered  to  the  receptor  tethered  to  a  neighboring 
receptor tethered to a non-neighboring receptor or in the bulk and 4 the methylation 
level of the signaling complex in which the receptor is located which varies between 0 
and  48  for  a  complex  of  six  dimers    Accordingly  the  reaction  proceeds  with  a  rate 
specific to each of the 33449  1764 possible receptor-enzyme states NFsim enables 
us to fully specify the above model with relatively few explicit reaction rules  Moreover 
the speed of simulation in NFsim scales nearly independently of the number of possible 
states 1 
In  the  simulation  chemoreceptor  dimers  are  specified  by  objects  of  the  form 
Tmmcastethlochex in which m and mc denote the methylation level 
of the dimer 0 to 8 and the local MWC cluster 0 to 48 as and teth are binding sites 
representing the active site and tether respectively and hex and loc are each a 
series  of  binding  sites  used  to  specify  the  organization  of  the  receptor  lattice    While 
NFsim does not support spatially resolved simulations we can specify the neighbors of a 
given dimer by creating bonds between it and all of its neighboring dimers  Fig S1A 
illustrates how a MWC cluster of six dimers is specified by creating bonds blue lines 
between the loc sites blue squares on each dimer  Fig S1B illustrates 21 MWC 
clusters assembled into a hexagonal lattice by specifying bonds red lines between the 
hex sites red squares of neighboring dimers  All interior dimers are connected to 
six neighboring dimers  These bonds need not correspond to chemical bonds in the  
Fig S1 Structuring the chemoreceptor lattice in NFsim  A A MWC signaling complex consisting of two 
trimers  of  dimers  left  is  specified  by  enumerating  bonds  right  blue  between  a  dimer  and  all  of  its 
neighbors within the complex B The hexagonal lattice is then structured by enumerating bonds between a 
given dimer and all of its neighbors in other signaling complexes red  The pictured lattice consists of 21 
MWC  complexes    All  interior  dimers  have  six  neighbors    The  basic  unit  of  the  lattice  is  the  hexagon 
consisting of three signaling complexes  We model lattices of equal length and width as specified in terms 
of this basic hexagonal unit 
actual system here they are a feature of the simulation language that we use to specify 
the lattice organization 
To illustrate reaction rules we consider the reaction in which a tethered CheR binds to 
the active site of a neighboring receptor  The corresponding rule is 
Rasteth1Tteth1hex2Ttashex2 -  
            Ras3teth1Tteth1hex2Ttas3hex2  
CheR  is  represented  by  the  object  R  with  two  binding  sites  as  and  teth    The  dot 
notation indicates that two objects are bound and the n notation serves to label distinct 
bonds    Tt  indicates  that  the  reaction  rate  is  a  function  of  the  state  of  the  object  T 
referenced as t in the function argument  In this case the reaction rate is a basal binding 
rate times one minus the activity of t calculated in the simulation by evaluating Eq 13 
at  the  methylation  level mc  of t    Functionally  defined  rate  laws  are  a  key  feature  of 
NFsim that in this illustrative case save us from having to define a separate reaction for 
each value of mc and m 
For simplicity we have assumed that each dimer has one modification site and one tether 
site  This simplification should not affect the results significantly since the number of 
receptors  greatly  exceeds  the  number  of  adaptation  enzymes  3    The  simulation 
described  in  this  section  and  in  the  main  text  was  used  for  models  M1  M2  and  M3  
Parameters for these models are given in Tables S1 S2 S6 and are discussed below 
Implementation of models with no enzyme localization 
The models B1 and B2 were also simulated using NFsim  MWC signaling complexes 
were  modeled  as  objects  with  a  methylation  level  ranging  from  0  to  48  and  a 
modification site for enzyme binding  The activity a was calculated for each signaling 
complex  using  Eq  13    Binding  of  CheR  and  CheB  to  the  complex  was  taken  to  be 
proportional to 1 - a and a respectively  Parameters for these models are given in Tables 
S1 S3 S6  B1 is adapted from an analytical model presented in a previous study 4 
Parameter values  
1  Parameter values common to all models 
Values in Table S1 were taken from experimental measurements presented in previous 
studies    The  basal  protein  counts  RTot  BTot  TTot  represent  the  mean  counts  per  cell 
measured  across  a  wild-type  population  by  immunoblotting  3    Parameters  for  the 
MWC  model  of  Tar  receptor  clusters  0 1  N  K  K  were  obtained  through  FRET 
measurements  of  kinase  activity  in  response  to  doses  of  the  chemoattractant  methyl-
aspartate 4  The value of 1 reflects that in Eq 13 am L is written in terms of the 
mean methylation level m per MWC signaling complex 
2  Parameter values for numerical models of the receptor lattice and the analytical 
model with enzyme localization 
Parameter  values  for  the  adaptation  kinetics  were  chosen  to  agree  with  recent  in vivo 
measurements  All parameter values for the analytical model with enzyme localization 
Table S4 are taken to agree with corresponding parameters in the numerical model M1

Fig S2 Response of the numerical model M1 to time-varying exponential ramps of chemoattractant  We 
presented the simulated cells with exponential ramps of methyl-aspartate light gray plotted in arbitrary 
units of rate r shown in each panel and averaged the response in receptor activity over ten trials dark 
gray    For  each  ramp  receptor  activity  approached  a  steady-state  value  during  stimulus  determined  by 
exponential fits black to at and plotted in Fig 2A of the main text  Following a recent experiment 4 
the methyl-aspartate concentration ranged between 0084 and 062 mM 
receptor cluster were taken from FRAP measurements 5  We interpret these rates to 
represent enzymatic binding to the high-affinity tether sites  The rates of localization by 
binding  the  lower-affinity  modification  sites arb
m  were  taken  to  be  slower    Since  few 
enzymes localize through this channel their exact values do not affect the predictions of 
the model significantly   
Key parameters for the model are Kr and Kb Table S4 which characterize the affinity of 
tethered enzymes for the modification site and therefore the steepness of the relationship 
between  receptor  activity  and  the  ratio  of  localized  enzymes  Figs  3B-D    These 
affinities are related to the rates in model M1 Table S2 via  Krb  drb
  The 
values  of  Kr  and  Kb  correspond  to  the  Michaelis-Menten  constants  for  the  enzyme-
modification site interaction divided by the effective local concentration of the tethered 
enzyme  Since the tether length is on the nanometer scale these local concentrations are 
high theoretical estimates based on the tether structure vary from 017mM 6 to 5M 7  
Given this range of estimates we chose the values of Kr and Kb conservatively ie to be 
 arb
m krb
relatively  large  For  example  assuming  Michaelis-Menten  constants  of  10M  our 
values of Krb imply an effective local concentration of 033mM  Smaller values of Krb 
would lead to a stronger dependence of receptor activity on the ratio of localized enzymes 
and correspondingly higher predictions for the level of signaling noise   
For given values of the catalytic rates Kr and Kb set the values of the binding rates of 
tethered  enzymes  to  the  modification  sites  and  the  rates  of  unbinding  from  the 
modification  sites    Additionally  the  values  of  Krb  constrain  the  values  of  the  tether 
unbinding rates  drb
 as discussed in the main text  Suitable choices of these rates ensure 
that the numbers of cytoplasmic and localized enzymes are comparable 5 and that the 
steady-state receptor activity is somewhat robust to variations in the expression levels of 
CheR and CheB  Parameters related to CheB phosphorylation were primarily based on 
measured values see below 
Given  values  of  the  above  parameters  the  catalytic  rates  kr  and  kb  of  methylation  and 
demethylation  were  calibrated  by  comparison  with  the  measured  responses  of  cell 
populations to exponential time-varying ramps of chemoattractant Figs 2A and S2 Ref 
4 32C data  Using a CheY-CheZ FRET pair these measurements quantified changes 
in receptor activity in response to ramps of methyl-aspartate  During stimulus activity 
tended to reach steady-state values dependent on the speed of the ramp These steady-
state values were determined by fitting the time trace of activity to an exponential decay 
Fig  S2    Our  model  agrees  well  with  the  experimental  results  over  a  wide  range  of 
activity  Fig  2A  but  diverges  for  strong  negative  ramps  because  it  does  not  include 
nonlinear CheB phosphorylation see below

CheB phosphorylation 
CheB is phosphorylated by the kinase CheA  Since only phosphorylated CheB is able to 
efficiently dock with and demethylate chemoreceptors 5 this arrangement constitutes a 
negative  feedback  loop    We  implemented  a  simple  CheB  phosphorylation  loop  in  our 
numerical models M1 M2 M3 and in the analytical model with enzyme localization 
following previous theoretical studies 8-11  We model CheB phosphorylation through 
the reaction T  CheB  T  CheB-P with rate ap aT  in which aT is the activity of 
the  receptor  T    The  rate  of  CheB-P  autodephosphorylation  dp  has  been  measured  by 
previous  independent  studies  with  excellent  agreement  1213    We  estimated  the 
maximum phosphorylation rate ap using a simple model that considered CheA CheB and 
CheY  phosphorylation  Let  active  CheA  autophosphorylate  with  rate  ka  CheA-P  Ap

phosphorylation of CheA is effectively at steady state an approximation that serves to 
reduce the number of parameters and significantly speed simulation 
In vivo  measurements  of  activity  as  measured  through  the  CheY-CheZ  interaction  via 
FRET suggest that the rate of CheB phosphorylation has nonlinear dependence on kinase 
activity  Specifically this dependence is inferred from 1 significant asymmetry in the 
rate  of  the  adaptation  response  to  positive  and  negative  step  stimuli  16  2  a  sharp 
increase in the demethylation rate at high kinase activities measured through stimulation

that  CheB 
phosphorylation only affects the adaptation kinetics at high activities a  074  Since 
the molecular processes underlying this nonlinearity are currently unknown we included 
simpler linear CheB feedback in our models  As a result while our model agrees well 
with  measurements  over  a  wide  range  of  activities  it  deviates  at  the  highest  activities  
Fig 2A  These activities are higher than the mean activities of typical unstimulated 
wild-type cells which are the primary focus of our study

1  Fluctuations without enzyme localization 
The model in this section is an analytical treatment of B1  We consider a model of MWC 
signaling  complexes  each  consisting  of  N   6  receptor  dimers    Let  m  be  the  average 
methylation  level  per  signaling  complex  varying  between  0  and  8N    We  begin  by 
studying the dynamics of the total methylation level M  mTTot2N the total number of 
methyl groups bound to receptors  To the equation of motion for the mean of M we can 
apply  the  linear  noise  approximation  LNA  directly  to  obtain  a  stochastic  differential 
equation for the dynamics of M  From this basis we can then calculate fluctuations in 
both m and the fraction of active receptor clusters a 
In this model we neglect the localization of the cytoplasmic enzymes with the tether site 
and simply assume that CheR binds the receptor modification site with affinity 1-aKr 
and  CheB  binds  with  affinity  aKb    Then  the  number  of  CheR-receptor  complexes  is

activity  a    074  and  the  parameters  in  Table  S4  this  model  is  equivalent  to  a  recent 
model calibrated from population responses to exponential ramps of attractant 4  For a 
 074 that model included a nonlinear CheB-P feedback term which we have neglected 
here  for  simplicity  and  since  we  are  primarily  interested  in  comparisons  at  lower 
activities where signaling noise is higher

3  Detailed model of enzyme localization 
The  analytical  model  of  the  previous  section  incorporates  the  features  responsible  for 
increased signaling noise when enzyme localization and brachiation are included in our 
simulation  of  the  bacterial  chemotaxis  system    However  it  also  overestimates  the 
magnitude  of  this  noise    Two  reasons  exist  for  this  overestimate    First  the  model 
assumes that all receptors are equally accessible to all localized enzymes meaning that 
methylation is fully distributive  In this picture enzymes bind the receptors for which 
they have the highest affinity low methylation level for CheR and high methylation level 
for CheB regardless of the state of the receptor to which they are tethered  The result is 
an overestimate of the binding affinity of localized enzymes  for the receptor substrate  
Second  the  previous  analytical  model  does  not  consider  a  distribution  of  methylation 
levels  Rather  a  m  is evaluated at only a single methylation level corresponding to 
the mean activity of the system  This approximation tends to overestimate a  m  most 
significantly  for  systems  with  mean  activity  of  a    05  where  a  m  is  largest  
Addressing  these  issues  requires  a  model  that  considers  the  dynamics  of  MWC 
complexes of each methylation level m individually  Additionally the model must track 
the numbers of enzymes localized to complexes at each methylation level  To tune the 
processivity of methylation we introduce a parameter  representing the rate at which 
localized enzymes randomize their position The value   0 corresponds to completely 
processive  methylation  and  the  limit        corresponds  to  purely  distributive 
methylation reducing the model to Eqs 8-10 of the main text 
Let TTot m be the total number of receptor monomers within MWC signaling complexes 
of  methylation  level  m    Also  let  Rm
 be  the  number  of  CheR  and  CheB-P 
localized within clusters of methylation level m but not bound to modification sites  For 
simplicity we consider only the case of a tethered enzyme binding a modification site in 
the  same  cluster  that  it  is  localized    This  binding  of  the  modification  site  forms 
 Tm   The changes in the number of these complexes

in which the cluster activity am  am L  All parameters are defined in the same manner 
as those for the previous analytical model given in Table S4
We now write the analogs of Eqs 1 2 in the main text which here describe the binding 
and unbinding of cytoplasmic CheR R and CheB-P Bp to tether sites within signaling 
complexes of methylation level m  The quantities  
BpTotm
    S19 
denote  the  total  numbers  of  localized  enzymes  at  each  methylation  level    These  total 
localized enzyme counts evolve according to

The first term two terms of the right hand side arise from the binding and unbinding of 
localized enzymes from the tether site  As in the previous model we here assume the 
number  of  free  tethers  to  be  large  compared  to  the  number  of  localized  enzymes  and
therefore  TTotm    The  third  and  fourth  terms  multiplied  by  krbKrb  represent  the 
localized enzyme demethylating the complex within which it is localized  The last two 
terms  introduce  a  redistribution  of  localized  enzymes  between  the  receptor  clusters 
occurring  at  a  rate     The  probability  of  a  given  complex  receiving  a  new  enzyme  is 
proportional to its relative abundance TTotmTTot

In  the  limit        Eqs  S18  S20  S21  reduce  to  Eqs  8-10  of  the  main  text  
Summing  Eqs  S20  S21  over  m  and  using 
 reduces them to Eqs 9 10 describing the dynamics of the total number of 
localized enzymes  To recover Eq 8 we note that as     it follows from Eqs S20 
S21  that  Rm

S18  and  summing dm  dt  m TTotm TTot
yields  Eq  8  for am    0    0  and am   
8N  1 8  This limit corresponds to fully distributive methylation in which localized 
enzymes are completely redistributed between each methylation event according to the 
abundances TTotm
For calculations about the steady state with no stimulus only methylation levels up to m 
 16 must be considered since a16 L  0  1 guarantees that CheR will not methylate 
clusters  beyond  this  limit    Signaling  noise  in  the  overall  activity  a  is  calculated  by 
linearizing  and  applying  the  linear  noise  approximation  to  Eqs  S18  S20  S21    The 
variance  in  the  overall  activity  aa  is  calculated  from  the  covariances  of  the  TTotm  
Results of this calculation for   0 fully processive and   20 s-1  more distributive 
are  shown  in  Fig  S4    The  more  distributive  model  exhibits  larger  fluctuations  and  a 
higher affinity of the localized enzymes for the receptor substrate

Comparing the dependence of receptor activity on the localized enzyme ratio  
When calculating the localized CheR to CheB-P ratio for the numerical models Fig 4C 
D we ignore the population of inert CheR and CheB-P localized respectively within 
fully methylated or demethylated assistance neighborhoods or for the model M2 lacking 
assistance neighborhoods tethered to fully methylated or demethylated receptor dimers  
While these inert enzymes are able to bind the modification sites of the receptors they 
are  unable  to  participate  in  methylation-demethylation  and  therefore  do  not  affect  the 
activity of the receptor cluster  This consideration provides the best comparison to Fig 
4B since the analytical model assumes all bound enzymes will demethylate receptors at 
the  same  rate  Eq  7    The  population  of  inert  CheR  is  small  for  all  models  but  the 
fraction of inert CheB is high for the processive models since many receptors are fully 
demethylated  Fig  S6    We  note  that  since  the  simulated  MWC  complexes  in  the 
absence of stimulus are half active when the methylation of the complex is m  6 out of 
a  possible  48  and  almost  fully  active  with  m    12  fully  demethylated  receptors  are 
common even when the activity of the receptor cluster is high 
Fig  S6  Mean  fraction  of  inert  CheB-P  tethered 
within  fully  demethylated  assistance  neighborhoods 
for  models  M1  black  and  M3  light  gray  or  with 
fully  demethylated  receptor  dimers  M2  dark  gray 
versus  total  CheR        These  enzymes  may  bind  the 
modification sites of receptors but will be unable to 
demethylate once bound  These enzymes are unable 
to  affect  the  activity  of  the  receptor  cluster  and  are 
therefore  not  counted  when  calculating  the  ratio  of 
localized CheR to CheB-P for Fig 4  Since very few 
receptors  are  fully  methylated  the  number  of  inert 
localized  CheR  is  negligible    1  for  all  models  
This  situation  arises  because  MWC  signaling 
complexes are highly active even at low methylation 
levels in the absence of stimulus a  05 for m  6 
out  of  48  and  a    1  for  m    14    Consequently 
many receptor dimers are fully demethylated even for 
cases in which the average receptor activity is high  
In contrast fully methylated dimers are rare

Comparing adaptation rates between the numerical models 
When presented with a large attractant stimulus the numerical models clearly displayed 
different  rates  of  adaptation  with  the  most  distributive  model  M1  reaching  its  adapted 
level  of  activity  first  Fig  2B    Fig  S7  shows  the  mean  methylation  level  per  MWC 
complex versus time for the simulations plotted in Fig 2B which clearly shows that M1 
black has the highest overall methylation rate during adaptation  We note that since the 
enzymes in model M3 have lower rates of tether  unbinding 30 more enzymes are 
localized  to  the  cluster  than  in  M1    This  leads  to  the  slightly  faster  initial  rate  of 
methylation for M3 compared to M1  This rate however drops due to the processivity 
of  methylation  in  M3  as  localized  CheR  is  unable  to  escape  from  pockets  of  high 
methylation  In contrast the methylation rate of the most distributive model M1 remains 
nearly constant during adaptation
