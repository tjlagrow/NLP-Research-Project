Abstract Observational and theoretical evidence that internal slow secular evolution re-
shapes galaxy disks is reviewed in Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 This update has three aims
First I emphasize that this evolution is very general  it is as fundamental to the evolution of
galaxy disks as e g core collapse is to globular clusters as the production of hot Jupiters is
to the evolution of protoplanetary disks and as evolution to red giants containing proto-white-
dwarfs is to stellar evolution One consequence for disk galaxies is the buildup of dense central
components that get mistaken for classical i e merger-built bulges but that were grown out of
disk stars and gas We call these pseudobulges Second I review new results on pseudobulge star
formation and structure and on the distinction between boxy and disky pseudobulges Finally I
highlight how these results make a galaxy formation problem more acute How can hierarchical
clustering produce so many pure disk galaxies with no evidence for merger-built bulges
Keywords galaxies bulges galaxies evolution galaxies formation galaxies photometry
galaxies kinematics and dynamics galaxies nuclei galaxies structure
1 The fundamental way that disks evolve is by spreading
Galactic evolution is in transition from the early Universe dominated by hierarchical
clustering to a future dominated by internal secular evolution There are many ways
that stars and gas can interact with collective phenomena such as bars oval disks spiral
structure and triaxial dark halos Dierent processes deserve  and are getting  detailed
study In this paper I want to emphasize common features that make the ensemble of
internal evolution processes fundamental This point is important enough that it should
appear in these Proceedings so I quote a discussion from Kormendy  Fisher 2005
A general principle of the evolution of self-gravitating systems is that it is energetically
favorable to spread  to shrink the inner parts by expanding the outer parts How to see
this depends on whether the system is dominated by rotation or by random motions
11 If Dynamical Support Is By Random Motions
Then the argument Lynden-Bell  Wood 1968 Binney  Tremaine 1987 is based
on the fundamental point that the specic heat of a self-gravitating system is negative
Consider an equilibrium system of N particles of mass m radius r and three-dimensional
velocity dispersion v The virial theorem says that 2 KE  PE  0 where the kinetic
energy KE  N mv22 and the potential energy PE  GN m2r dene v and r
The total energy of a bound system E  KE  PE  KE
is negative But
temperature T corresponds to internal velocity as mv22  3kT 2 So the specic heat
C  dEdT  dN mv22dv2 is also negative In the above G is the gravitational
constant and k is Boltzmanns constant
Kormendy
The system is supported by heat so evolution is by heat transport If the center of the
system gets hotter than the periphery then heat tends to ow outward The inner parts
shrink and get still hotter This promotes further heat ow The outer parts receive heat
they expand and cool Whether the system evolves on an interesting timescale depends
on whether there is an eective heat-transport mechanism For example many globular
clusters evolve quickly by two-body relaxation and undergo core collapse Giant elliptical
galaxies  which otherwise would evolve similarly  cannot do so because their relaxation
times are much longer than the age of the Universe
12 If Dynamical Support Is By Rotation
Tremaine 1989 provides a transparent summary of an argument due to Lynden-Bell 
Kalnajs 1972 and to Lynden-Bell  Pringle 1974 A disk is supported by rotation so
evolution is by angular momentum transport The goal is to minimize the total energy
at xed total angular momentum A rotationally supported ring at radius r in a xed
potential r has specic energy Er and specic angular momentum Lr given by
  and Lr  cid18r3 d
dr cid1912
Then dEdL  r where   r1ddr12 is the angular speed of rotation Disks
spread when a unit mass at radius r2 moves outward by gaining angular momentum dL
from a unit mass at radius r1  r2 This is energetically favorable the change in energy
dE  dE1  dE2  cid20cid18 dE

is negative because r usually decreases outward Thus disk spreading leads to a lower
energy state In general disk spreading outward angular momentum ow and energy
dissipation accompany one another in astrophysical disks Tremaine 1989
13 Self-Gravitating Systems Evolve By Spreading
The consequences are very general All of the following are caused by the above physics
Globular and open clusters are supported by random motions so they spread in three
dimensions by outward energy transport The mechanism is two-body relaxation and
the consequences are core collapse and the evaporation of the outer parts
Stars are spherical systems supported by pressure They spread in three dimensions
by outward energy transport The mechanisms are radiation or convection mediated by
opacity Punctuated by phases of stability when nuclear reactions replace the energy that
is lost stellar evolution consists of a series of core contractions and envelope expansions
One result is red supergiants containing cores that will become white dwarfs neutron
stars or stellar mass black holes
Protostars are spherical systems coupled to circumstellar disks by magnetic elds that
wind up because of dierential rotation This drives jets that look one-dimensional but
that really are three-dimensional they carry away angular momentum and allow the
inner circumstellar disk to shrink and accrete onto the star Shu et al 1994 1995
Protoplanetary disks are supported by rotation they spread in two dimensions by
outward angular momentum transport Dynamical friction produces for example hot
Jupiters and colder Neptunes
Galactic disks are supported by rotation They want to spread in two dimensions by
outward angular momentum transport Ecient driving mechanisms are provided by
bars and globally oval disks Like all of the above the evolution is secular  it is slow
compared to the collapse time of the disk Secular evolution is the subject of this paper
Internal Secular Evolution in Galaxies
2 Secular Evolution and the Growth of Pseudobulges
That interactions with collective phenomena such as bars and spiral structure result in
secular evolution was emphasized as long ago as Kormendy 1979a b 1982a b One of
the earliest examples of a specic process was the suggestion by Duus  Freeman 1975
now conrmed by many papers e g Simkin Su  Schwarz 1980 that gas in a barred
galaxy settles into a ring surrounding the end of the bar Figure 1 The formation of bars
is likely to be partly secular Sellwood 2000 Another early result was the demonstration
Combes  Sanders 1981 that n-body bars heat up in the axial direction when seen
edge-on they resemble  and we believe explain  box-shaped bulges  4 By 1982
the secular evolution of barred galaxies was a thriving industry see Kormendy 1982a for
a review Sellwood  Wilkinson 1993 Kormendy 1993 and Buta  Combes 1996
provide interim reviews In the past decade progress has accelerated rapidly Recent
reviews include Kormendy  Cornell 2004 Kormendy  Fisher 2005 Athanassoula
2007a b and most thoroughly Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 hereafter KK04
Figure 1 illustrates the results of gas evolution in a barred galaxy Disk gas is rearranged
into an outer ring at  22 bar radii an inner ring that encircles the end of the bar
and a dense central concentration of gas As the gas density increases star formation is
likely and indeed the features produced in gas closely resemble the stellar outer rings
inner rings and pseudobulges seen in the gure Much observational evidence supports
these interpretations as discussed in the above reviews
Pseudobulges are the consequence discussed in this paper In the simulations gas falls
to the center and builds high densities often in rings Since star formation rate density
SFR increases faster than linearly with gas density gas SFR  14
gas Kennicutt 1998a
b high star formation rates are expected They are observed KK04 review observations
of nuclear starbursts often in spectacular rings and often associated with bars and
oval disks The star formation rates in starbursting nuclear rings imply with modest
replenishment of the observed nuclear gas that they would build the stellar densities that
we observe in pseudobulges in 1  3 billion years That is the formation picture suggested
by the simulations is clearly consistent via observed gas densities star formation rates
and plausible timescales with the disky pseudobulges discussed in the next section

simulation of evolution in a rotating bar potential horizontal but not shown Simkin Su 
Schwarz 1980 After 7 bar rotations gas has collected into an outer ring an inner ring around
the end of the bar and a dense central concentration Such features are seen in SB galaxies e g

3 Update on Pseudobulge Properties and Star Formation
The properties that allow us to classify pseudobulges are listed in KK04 I have space
here for only a brief update of pseudobulge properties and star formation rates
Fisher 2006 used Spitzer Space Telescope images to derive for 50 galaxies 36 m -
8 m color proles that are a measure of star formation rates Wu et al 2005 He found
that morphologically identied classical bulges have lower star formation rates than their
disks Pseudobulges have star formation rates similar to those of their associated disks
If most pseudobulges show ongoing star formation then it must be secular KK04
Drory  Fisher 2007a b show that bulge type correlates with the division of galaxies
into a red sequence and a blue cloud in Sloan Survey color-magnitude diagrams Strateva
et al 2001 Red sequence galaxies contain mainly classical bulges Blue cloud galaxies
contain pseudobulges The division into red and blue is not due to dierent mixtures of
red bulges and blue disks rather classical bulge galaxies globally formed most of their
stars early and pseudobulge galaxies excepting S0s continue to form stars throughout
Peletier 2007 reviews SAURON observations that show in superb two-dimensional
detail evidence for pseudobulges with disky dynamics and young stellar populations
Fisher  Drory 2007 measure surface brightness distributions in 84 S0  Sc galaxies
in which they morphologically classify the bulges as classical or pseudo They decompose
major-axis proles into Sersic 1968 log I  r1n proles  exponential disks They nd
a Almost all pseudobulges have n 6 2 and almost all classical bulges have n  2
This extends results of e g Courteau de Jong  Broeils 1996 Carollo et al 2002
MacArthur Courteau  Holtzman 2003 and KK04 We do not understand how to
predict n in either type of bulge but the above correlation is good enough so we can use
n as an imperfect to be sure classication criterion
b Bulge-to-total luminosity ratios BT are smaller for pseudobulges than for classical
bulges over the whole Hubble sequence and also at a given Hubble type Almost no
pseudobulges have BT  13 as expected if they are built out of disk material
c Pseudobulges are atter than classical bulges in fact the attest classical bulge
in their sample is less attened than the average pseudobulge But the roundest classical
and pseudo bulges have similar intrinsic attenings Not all pseudobulges are at
4 Where are the bulges in galaxies with box-shaped edge-on bars
Figure 2 left shows a normal early-type barred galaxy It is easy to distinguish the
bar from the bulge which happens to be a pseudobulge KK04 Ignoring for present
purposes the distinction between lens and outer ring there are three main components
the disk the bar and the pseudobulge The next two panels show NGC 4565 a familiar
galaxy with a boxy pseudobulge The middle image is an infrared 36 m version of
the view that we normally see in print Two components are visible the disk and the
boxy bulge As long as we thought that a boxy shape was a minor structural detail of
bulges our mental picture of this galaxy was entirely canonical it is an Sb galaxy with
a big disk and a small bulge But now we know that boxy bulges are edge-on bars So
the central image shows two components a disk and a bar Where is the bulge in this
Sb galaxy The same question applies to all edge-on galaxies with boxy bulges
The right-hand image and plot provide the answer Kormendy  Barentine 2007 NGC
4565 contains a high-surface-brightness but tiny pseudobulge that is clearly distinct from
the boxy bar The key to seeing this component is to observe far enough into the infrared
to reduce the dust absorption that is a problem in the optical A 36 m Spitzer Space
Telescope archive image and an HST NICMOS image are unaected by dust near the
center The latter provides high enough spatial resolution so that we can measure the
Sersic index of the central component Is it a classical bulge or is it a pseudobulge Its
Internal Secular Evolution in Galaxies
Figure 2 The left panel shows a visible-light image of the SB0 galaxy NGC 3945 It contains
a pseudobulge a bar that lls a lens component along the minor axis and an outer ring The
central panels show a Spitzer Space Telescope 36 m IRAC image of NGC 4565 at dierent
brightnesses and contrasts to emphasize the box-shaped bulge left and the central pseudobulge
right The rightmost panel shows the minor-axis brightness prole derived from the Spitzer
image and from a Hubble Space Telescope HST NICMOS F160W image Also shown is a
three-component decomposition into a central Sersic function for the pseudobulge a Sersic
function for the boxy bulge and an outer exponential From Kormendy  Barentine 2007
axial ratio is consistent with a classical bulge  it is not particularly at But its Sersic
index is n  133012 This means that it is a pseudobulge  3 Kormendy  Barentine
2007 nd similar results for NGC 5746 another edge-on galaxy with a boxy bulge
This is remarkable Except for the faint thick disk and halo the thickest component in
NGC 4565 is the edge-on bar which is part of the disk The next thickest component is
the thin disk The component with the smallest scale height is the pseudobulge It has the
shape of a classical bulge but its scale height is only 12  90 pc In contrast the scale
height of the boxy bar  thin disk is 10  790 pc Four implications deserve emphasis
a Seeing a pseudobulge distinct from the boxy bar increases condence in our picture
of secular evolution It is easier to believe that we understand boxy bars in edge-on
galaxies if we also nd pseudobulges like those associated with bars in face-on galaxies
b BT ratios in edge-on galaxies with boxy bulges are smaller than we thought
c Published BT values in edge-on and face-on barred galaxies are inconsistent In
edge-on galaxies we count box-shaped structures as bulge light When we see such a
galaxy face-on we identify this light as a bar and measure a smaller BT ratio
d A problem with cold dark matter galaxy formation gets more acute Simien  de
Vaucouleurs 1986 nd that BT  04 in NGC 4565 But B refers to the boxy bar
Figure 2 shows that the pseudobulge is much less luminous than the boxy structure And
it has the properties of pseudobulges that were grown out of disks Yet the disk rotates
at 255  10 km s1 interior to the outer warp Rupen 1991 In a hierarchically clustering
Universe how can a galaxy grow so massive with no evidence for a major merger
