Abstract This aims to be an overview of what detailed observations of individual
stars in nearby dwarf galaxies may teach us about galaxy evolution This includes
some early results from the DART Dwarf Abundances and Radial velocity Team
Large Programme at ESO This project has used 22mWFI and VLTFLAMES to
obtain spectra of large samples of individual stars in nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies
and determine accurate abundances and kinematics These results can be used to trace
the formation and evolution of nearby galaxies from the earliest times to the present
1 Introduction
Dwarf galaxies are the most numerous type of galaxy we know of and they are
commonly assumed to be if not the actual building blocks of larger galaxies
then they most closely resemble them The Local Group contains 36 dwarf
galaxies out of a total of 42 members covering a large range of properties 1
and including more than one example of most if not all the known classes of
dwarf galaxy There are nucleated dwarfs eg NGC205 NGC185 extremely
low surface brightness dwarfs eg Sextans Ursa Minor interacting dwarfs
eg Sagittarius star bursting dwarfs eg IC10 Sextans A isolated dwarfs
eg Tucana Cetus They fall predominantly into two classes - those with gas
which are still forming stars and those which appear not to have gas and are not
presently forming stars
The abundance patterns of individual stars of dierent ages and environ-
ments enable us to unlock the evolutionary history of galaxies Many physical
characteristics of a galaxy may change over time such as shape and colour how-
ever the metal content and abundance ratios of stellar atmospheres are not so
easy to tamper with Stars retain the chemical imprint of the interstellar gas out
of which they formed and metals can only increase with time This method to
study galaxy evolution has been elegantly named Chemical Tagging 2
There have been a number of detailed abundance studies of stars in nearby
galaxies which cast ever more serious doubt on the premise that the galaxies we
see today are in any way related to galactic building blocks eg 3 4 5
The Fe ratios of stars in dwarf spheroidal dSph galaxies are generally lower
than similar metallicity Galactic stars There is marginal overlap in the Fe
ratios between dSph stars and Galactic halo stars but this similarity does not
extend to other element ratios where for example a signicant over abundance in
BaY is typically observed in dSph stars compared to Galactic stars see Venn
Tolstoy
this volume The stars in larger galaxies such as the LMC and Sagittarius are
also chemically distinct from the majority of the Galactic stars see Hill this
volume Bonifacio this volume McWilliam this volume This makes a merging
hypothesis dicult to explain any component of our Galaxy unless the merging
were to occur predominantly at very early times These observations can thus
be interpretated in two ways - either to say that dwarf galaxies are not building
blocks of larger galaxies which begs the questions - what are they then and
how do they avoid too much merging with larger galaxies or we can say that
perhaps the whole idea of heirarchical structure formation as it currently stands
needs some serious revision because dwarf galaxies really dont t the picture
Both interpretations have merit and neither can be ruled out
2 Initial Results from DART Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal
The DART large programme at ESO made vhel and FeH measurements from
FLAMES spectroscopy of 401 red giant branch RGB stars in the Sculptor Scl
dSph 6 The relatively high signalnoise SN  10-20 per pixel resulted in
both accurate metallicites  01 dex from internal errors and radial velocities
 2 kms This is the rst time that a large sample of accurate velocities
and metallicities have been measured in a dwarf galaxy
Scl is a close companion of the Milky Way at a distance of 72 5 kpc 7
with a low total dynamical mass 14 06  107M 8 and modest lumi-
nosity MV  107  05 and central surface brightness 0V  235  05
magarcsec2 9 with no HI gas 10 CMD analysis including the oldest Main
Sequence turnos has determined that this galaxy is predominantly old and
that the entire star formation history can have lasted only a few Gyr 11

Abundances as tracers
Imaging Previous studies already suggested that the spatial distribution
of the Horizontal Branch stars in Scl shows signs of a gradient with the red
horizontal branch stars RHB being more centrally concentrated than the blue
horizontal branch BHB stars 12 13 The DART WFI imaging data extends
beyond the nominal tidal radius and with an average 5- limiting magnitude
of V235 and I225 also probes well below the Horizontal Branch This has
enabled us to unequivocally demonstrate that the BHB and RHB stars have
markedly dierent spatial distributions see Fig 1
The dierent spatial occupancy of the two populations taking into account
the foreground contamination present in the RHB sample is striking and pro-
vides strong evidence that we are seeing two distinct components The character-
istics of the BHB and RHB are also consistent with dierent ages eg 2 Gyr
or dierent metallicities FeH07 dex from theoretical modelling of glob-
ular cluster Horizontal Branches 14
Elliptical Radius degrees
Fig 2 VLTFLAMES FeH measurements for 308 potential members of Sculptor
dSph versus elliptical radius Also marked is the extent of the RHB distribution as a
dashed line and the tidal radius rtidal
Spectroscopy The WFI images were used to select samples of stars on
the RGB in Scl to take spectra in the Ca II triplet region with VLTFLAMES
This resulted in radial velocity measurements and metallicity estimates for more
than 400 stars in Scl over the elds outlined in Fig 1 of which 300 have a high
membership probability
In Fig 2 we show the distribution of FeH as a function of elliptical radius
the equivalent distance along the semi-major axis from the centre of Scl for
those RGB stars which were determined to have a high probability of member-
ship A well-dened metallicity gradient is apparent with a similar scale size to
the RHB versus BHB spatial distributions
Tolstoy
In the central region of Sculptor we have high resolution spectra providing
direct abundance measurements for numerous elements Hill et al in prep
In Fig 3 we show the preliminary results for the -elements Ca Mg  Ti
compared with similar observations of stars in our Galaxy It is clear that the
overall distribution of Fe versus FeH in Scl does not match our Galaxy
except for a small number of the most metal poor stars in Scl which overlap with
Galactic halo stars
Fig 3 The -abundance average of Ca Mg and Ti for stars in our Galaxy compared
to those in Scl The VLTFLAMES high resolution measurements of 92 members in
the central eld are shown as crosses from Hill et al in prep The Galactic stars
come from standard literature sources see 5 for references The 5 open squares are
UVES measurements of individual stars in Scl 3
3 Two Stellar Components
Our FLAMES results clearly show that Scl contains two distinct stellar com-
ponents with dierent spatial kinematic and abundance properties 6 There
appears to be a metal-rich 09  FeH  17 and a metal-poor 17 
FeH  28 component The metal-rich component is more centrally concen-
trated than the metal poor and on average appears to have a lower velocity
dispersion metalrich  7  1 kms whereas metalpoor  11  1 kms see
Battaglia this volume
There are indications that the presence of two populations is a common
feature of dSph galaxies Our preliminary analysis of HB stars vhel and FeH
measurements in the other galaxies in our sample Fornax and Sextans dSph
Battaglia et al in prep also shows very similar characteristics to Scl especially
in the most metal poor component Pure radial velocity studies 15 16 have
also considered the possibility that kinematically distinct components exist in
Ursa Minor Draco and Sextans dSph galaxies
Abundances as tracers
What mechanism could create two ancient stellar components in a small
dwarf spheroidal galaxy A simple possibility is that the formation of these
dSph galaxies began with an initial burst of star formation resulting in a stellar
population with a mean FeH  2 Subsequent supernovae explosions from
this initial episode could have been sucient to cause gas and metal loss such
that star formation was inhibited until the remaining gas could sink deeper
into the centre 17 Thus the subsequent generations of stars would inhabit a
region closer to the centre of the galaxy and have a higher average metallicity and
dierent kinematics Another possible cause is external inuences such as minor
mergers or accretion of additional gas It might also be that events surrounding
the epoch of reionisation inuenced the evolution of these small galaxies 18 and
resulted in the stripping or photoevaporation of the outer layers of gas in the
dSph meaning that subsequent more metal enhanced star formation occured
only in the central regions
The full abundance analysis of the FLAMES HR data Hill et al in prep
will provide more details of the chemical enrichment history of Scl This will
hopefully enable us to distinguish between two episodes of star formation or
more continuous star formation manifested as a gradient in velocity dispersion
and metallicity from the centre of the galaxy Fig 3 suggests that Fe diers
for the two populations such that the metal poor presumably older population
has high Fe consistent with the halo of our Galaxy and the more metal rich
population doesnt match any of the Galactic stars The dotted line is drawn at
FeH 17 to show the proposed dividing line between the two populations
although as can be seen in Fig 2 there is not a clear division however the
kinematics provide clear support6
4 Dwarf Galaxies and Galaxy Formation
It is clear from Fig 3 that the Scl dSph does not in the mean have stellar abun-
dance properties consistent with our Galaxy and the evidence points to this also
being the case for most other nearby galaxies This suggests that nearby dwarf
galaxies are not the building blocks left over from the heirarchical formation of
galaxies like our own If we wish to retain a heirarchical formalism to explain
the formation and evolution of our Galaxy then a mechanism has to be found
by which those objects which did merge to form our Galaxy evolved dierently
from the similar mass dwarf galaxies we see around today It might be for
example that the building blocks formed and evolved much closer in to the cen-
tral potential and thus their star formation history and chemical evolution were
aected such that these processes proceeded much more rapidly than in their
more distant cousins Although this can be understood in qualitative generalised
terms there is no particular evidence to support this You would think that a
dierence in the abundance patterns of stars formed close to the centre of a po-
tential and further out would then suggest some kind of gradient in properties
or at least that today we might pick up an unabsorbed building block in the form
of a dwarf galaxy So far detailed abundances have been determined for all the
Tolstoy
dwarf galaxies in our halo Shetrone 2004 this volume including Sagittarius
Bonifacio 2004 this volume which is in the process of merging with our Galaxy
and they all show an astonishing uniformity of abundance ratios for Fe as
well as r- and s- process elements like BaEu and YBa even if FeH varies
between 3 and 05 dex see Venn 2004 this volume We also see evidence
for similar abundance ratios in young massive stars in more distant higher mass
dwarf irregular galaxies see Kaufer 2004 this volume and in RGB stars in the
Magellanic Clouds Hill 2004 this volume This uniformity in of itself suggests
a remarkably stable enrichment process This is even more striking considering
that all these galaxies are so dierent in their star formation histories but their
mean stellar abundance patterns for stars of all ages are very similar to each
other and very dierent to our Galaxy
So although we cannot rule out the possibility that we are living at a par-
ticular time where all recent and future mergers will be of dierent types of
objects than created the bulk of our Galaxy it might be wise to start to consider
some variations on the standard scenario It is possible to argue that the most
metal poor tail of stars in Scl dSph overlap the properties of the Galactic halo
stars suggesting evidence for extremely early gas rich merging meaning that
most of the stars we see in our Galaxy were actually formed there and only the
metal poor stars in the halo may have been formed in the satellites themselves
