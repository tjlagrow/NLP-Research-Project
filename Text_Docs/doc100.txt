Abstract 
Biological systems are known to be highly transparent to 700-1100nm near-infrared 
NIR light  It is shown here that the strong optical absorbance of single-walled carbon 
nanotubes SWNTs in this special spectral window an intrinsic property of SWNTs can 
be utilized for optical stimulation of nanotubes inside living cells to afford 
multifunctional nanotube biological transporters  For oligonucleotides transported inside 
living cells by nanotubes the oligos can translocate into cell nucleus upon endosomal 
rupture triggered by NIR laser pulses Continuous NIR radiation can cause cell death due 
to excessive local heating of SWNT in vitro  Selective cancer cell destruction can be 
achieved via functionalization of SWNT with a folate moiety selective internalization of 
SWNTs inside cells labeled with folate receptor tumor-markers and NIR triggered cell 
death without harming receptor-free normal cells  Thus the transporting capabilities of 
carbon nanotubes combined with suitable functionalization chemistry and their intrinsic 
optical properties can lead to new classes of novel nanomaterials for drug delivery and 
cancer therapy 
Introduction 
The introduction and delivery of DNA proteins or drug molecules into living 
cells is important to therapeutics 1  Inorganic nanomaterials including nanocrystals 
nanotubes and nanowires exhibit advanced physical properties promising for various 
biological applications 2-6 including new molecular transporters  Single-walled carbon 
nanotubes SWNTs have been shown to shuttle various cargos across cellular membrane 
without cytotoxicity 7-9  Much remains to be done to exploit the intrinsic physical 
properties of SWNTs 10 and thus impart unique features to nanotube bio-carriers  
Here we show that while biological systems are transparent to 700-1100nm near-infrared 
NIR light 11 the strong absorbance of SWNTs in this window 12 can be utilized for 
optical stimulation of nanotubes inside living cells to afford various useful functions  For 
oligonucleotides transported inside cells by nanotubes the oligos can translocate into cell 
nucleus upon endosomal rupture triggered by NIR laser pulses Continuous NIR radiation 
can cause cell death due to excessive local heating of SWNT in vitro Selective cell 
destruction can be achieved via functionalization of SWNT with a folate moiety targeted 
internalization of SWNTs inside cells labeled with folate receptor tumor-markers 13 
and NIR triggered cell death without harming receptor-free normal cells The intrinsic 
physical properties of SWNTs can thus be exploited to afford new types of biological 
transporters with useful functionalities 
Materials and Methods 
Water Soluble Cy3-DNA-SWNT Conjugates and Characterization  As-grown Hipco 
14 SWNTs were mixed with a 20 M aqueous solution of Cy3 labeled single-stranded 
DNA and the initial concentration of SWNTs was  250 mgL  The DNA sequence was 
TGGACAAGTGGAATGX where X denoted the fluorescent label Cy3 and was 
purchased from the PANfacility at Stanford University  The nanotubes and DNA 
solution were sonicated for  45 min to 1 hr and centrifuged at 22 000 g for  6 hrs  
The pellet comprising of impurities aggregates and bundles of nanotubes at the bottom of 
the centrifuge tube was discarded and the supernatant was collected and underwent an 
additional centrifugation round The resulting supernatant consisted of a solution of 
SWNT functionalized by Cy3-DNA via non-covalent adsorption 15  The solubilized 
SWNTs were mostly individual tubes few bundles as revealed by spectroscopy and 
microscopy using a Cary 6000i UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer and atomic force 
microscopy AFM respectively  The SWNT concentration in the solution after this 
process was estimated to be  25mgL 10 of the starting nanotube suspension  
Samples for AFM analysis were prepared by depositing  50 L of the SWNT 
suspension on a SiO2 substrate and allowed to stand for 45 min  The substrate was then 
thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and dried with a N2 stream   
SWNTs Functionalized by Various Phospholipids PL   
PL with a PEG moiety and Folic Acid Terminal Group PL-PEG-FA  35 mM of 
folic acid FA Aldrich and 5 mM of 1-ethyl-3-3-dimethylamino-propyl carbodiimide 
EDC  Fluka  were  added  to  a  solution  of  035mM  NH2-PEG-PL  2-Distearoyl-sn-
Glycero-3-Phosphoethanolamine-N-AminoPolyethylene  Glycol2000  purchased  from 
Avanti Polar Lipids in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 75  After reaction the solution 
was dialyzed against phosphate buffer using a membrane MWCO 1000 Spectrapor to 
remove un-reacted FA and EDC The dialysis was carried out for 3 days with frequent 
replacement of the buffer  After dialysis the absorbance of the PL-PEG-FA solution was 
recorded using a HP-8453 spectrophotometer to ensure that excess free FA was removed 
from the solution 
PL with a PEG Moiety and Fluorescein Tag PL-PEG-FITC  3 mg of NH2-PEG-PE 
was dissolved in 15mL of 01 M carbonate buffer solution pH 80  To this solution 100 
L  of  13mM  solution  of  fluorescein  isothiocyanate  FTIC  in  DMSO  Aldrich  was 
added  The mixture was allowed to react overnight at room temperature and protected 
from  light    Purification  by  gel  chromatography  was  achieved  by  loading  1  mL  of  the 
solution  to  a  Sephadex  G-25  column  Aldrich    As  elution  solvent  H2O  was  flown 
through  the  column  the  formation  of  two  separate  yellow  bands  was  observed    The 
fractions were collected and the absorbance of various fractions was measured at 488 nm 
using a HP-8453 spectrophotometer  Fractions from the first elution peak were pooled as 
they  were  attributed  to  the  higher  molecular  weight  PL-PEG-FITC  conjugate  also 
confirmed  by  fluorescence  measurement  and  subsequently  used  for  solubilization  of 
SWNTs   
Solutions of SWNTs Functionalized with One or Two PL-PEG Molecules One or 
Two Cargos  PL-PEG-FA one cargo used later in Fig5b5c or a 11 mixture of PL-
PEG-FA and PL-PEG-FITC two cargos used for Fig 5d5e were used to functionalize 
and  solubilize  Hipco  SWNTs  using  the  same  sonication  and  centrifuging  procedure  as 
described for Cy3-DNA above The SWNTs functionalized by PL-PEG molecules were 
also individual tubes characterized by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy and AFM 
Cell Culture and Cellular Incubation in SWNT Solutions  HeLa cells an adherent 
cell line were cultured in Dubelccos modified eagles medium DMEM supplemented 
with 10  of fetal bovine serum FBS and 1  penicillin-streptomycin all reagents 
from Invitrogen  The incubations of Cy3-DNA-SWNT with HeLa cells were carried out 
done for Fig 234 in 12 well plates with the cells having been seeded for a period of 
 18hrs prior to incubation  Cy-DNA-SWNT was added to each well  4x105 cellswell 
at a final concentration of  25  5 mgL  The incubations were carried out at 37 C 
except for low temperature incubation where the temperature was 4 C in Fig 2c and 
in 5 CO2 atmosphere for a period of  12 hrs After incubation the cell medium was 
removed from the well the cells were washed and detached from the surface by the 
addition of trypsin-EDTA solution Invitrogen for various characterization or laser 
radiation steps  Similar steps were used for incubating cells in PL-PEG functionalized 
SWNTs for Fig5  Note that all cells were washed with excess SWNTs in the solution 
removed and placed in fresh solutions after the incubation step and before any of the in-
vitro laser radiation experiments described in this work  
FRCells and Normal Cells  HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM medium with folic 
acid FA depleted from the cell medium  It is known that the FA-starved cells over-
express folate receptors FRs on the cell surfaces   HeLa cells were passaged for at least 
4 rounds in the FA-free medium before use to ensure over-expression of FR on the 
surface of the cells FRcells  Normal cells were all cultured in DMEM medium with 
abundant folic acid and few available free-FRs on the cell surfaces   
808nm Laser Radiation  Detached HeLa cells with or without incubation treatment in 
SWNT solutions were transferred to a circular quartz cuvette diameter  3 cm thickness 
or optical path length  1 cm and exposed to an 808nm laser source a fiber coupled 
diode laser bar  Note that all cells were washed with excess SWNTs in the solution 
removed and placed in fresh solutions after incubation in SWNT solutions and before any 
of the in-vitro laser radiation experiments described in this work  The diode laser bar was 
coupled into a 1 meter long 200m core fiber with a numerical aperture of 022  The bare 
fiber end was imaged to the size of the cuvette using a 50 mm anti-reflection coated bi-
convex lens  The center wavelength varied from 806-810 nm depending on the current 
level while maintaining a width of 2 nm  A closed loop cooling system suppressed 
temperature transients to below 02C to eliminate power and wavelength variations 
during exposures  Power calibration was performed using a thermal power meter placed 
after the imaging lens and before the sample  The laser beam size was about 3 cm fully 
covering the area of the cuvette for radiation of the cells  The power density was tunable 
up to a maximum of  35 Wcm2 and the exposure was carried out either continuously 
for several minutes or over several 10 sec pulses   
Confocal Microscopy  The cells were imaged by a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal 
microscope  Prior to analysis the detached HeLa cells with and without laser exposure 
were seeded in chambered coverslides for  12 hrs  For nuclear staining DRAQ5 
Axxora LLC was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 5 min at room 
temperature before confocal imaging 
Ex-Vitro Measurement of Heating of a SWNT Solution by NIR Radiation  A DNA-
SWNT solution nanotube concentration 25 mgL was irradiated by the 808 nm laser at 
14 Wcm2  Temperature was measured Fig 3c at 20 s intervals with a thermocouple 
placed inside the solution for a total period of 2 min  Care was taken to avoid exposure 
of the thermocouple in the beam path to minimize any direct heating of the thermocouple 
by the laser  Longer time radiation caused formation of gas bubbles in the solution and 
eventual boiling of the water solution as a result of light absorption by SWNTs in the 
solution  Without nanotubes an aqueous solution is transparent without heating under 
the same radiation conditions 
Cell Proliferation Assay  CellTiter A96 Promega an MTS based assay was used to 
monitor cell viability and proliferation after various treatments including internalization 
of SWNTs and laser radiation  The CellTiter 96 assay uses the tetrazolium compound 3-
45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-5-3-carboxymethoxyphenyl-2-4-sulfophenyl-2H-
tetrazolium inner salt MTS and the electron coupling reagent phenazine methosulfate 
PMS MTS is chemically reduced by cells into formazan whose concentration and 
optical absorbance at 490nm can provide a measure of the metabolically active live cells   
Control cells or cells treated with SWNT andor laser treatment were left to 
incubate for a period of up to 15 days at 37C and 5 CO2 in DMEM  The CellTiter A96 
solution was added to each cell sample and allowed to react for 2 h at 37C and 5 CO2  
Colorimetric detection and absorbance at 490 nm were used to determine the proliferation 
profile of different samples   
Results and Discussion 
The nanotube samples used here were Hipco SWNTs 14 solubilized in the 
aqueous phase by non-covalently adsorbing either 15-mer fluorescently Cy3-labeled 
single-stranded DNA 15 Fig 1a or polyethylene glycol PEG-grafted phospholipids 
PL-PEG Fig 5a These nanotube solutions were highly stable in buffer solutions Fig 
1c insert consisting of very pure short average length150nm and individualized 
SWNTs by sonication and centrifugation 12 rather than bundles as evidenced by UV-
Vis-NIR absorbance Fig 1b and atomic force microscopy AFM Fig 1d data The 
molar extinction coefficient of the solubilized SWNTs molecular weight MW170kD 
for length150nm diameter  12nm measured at 808nm in the NIR was   79 x 106 
M-1cm-1 Fig 1c The high absorbance of SWNTs in the NIR originates from electronic 
transitions between the first or second van Hove singularities of the nanotubes 1216 
High optical absorbance of SWNTs in the 700-1100nm NIR window transparent to 
biological systems 11 is exploited in the current work at a single wavelength by using a 
808 nm laser beam size  3cm and power density up to 35Wcm2 for in-vitro 
radiation  
By confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging we observed that upon exposure 
of HeLa cells to a Cy3-DNA-SWNT solution at 37 C the DNA-SWNT conjugates were 
internalized Fig 2a2b inside the cells with nanotubes as the transporters The green 
color in Fig 2a corresponds to Cy3 labels on DNA-SWNTs inside HeLa cells  After 
staining the cell nucleus with a DRAQ5 dye we carried out dual color detection and 
observed accumulation of DNA-SWNT in the cytoplasm region with little colocalization 
of Cy3-DNA in the nucleus Fig 2b This suggested lack of nuclear translocation for the 
DNA molecules carried across the cell membranes by nanotubes Experiments carried out 
at 4C found no uptake of Cy3-DNA-SWNT conjugates inside cells Fig 2c suggesting 
an energy-dependent endocytosis mechanism 17 for the uptake observed at 37C 
Endocytosis is known to rely on enclosure of molecules inside endosomes or lipid 
vesicles during and after cell entry 17  Motivated by the need of endosomal rupture for 
efficient molecular releasing and delivery 18 we explore the effects of NIR light on 
DNA-SWNTs after endocytosis We first note that control experiments find that cells 
without nanotubes are highly transparent to NIR and exhibit no ill effect after radiation 
for up to 5 min by a 35 Wcm2 808 nm coherent laser light laser beam diameter 3 
cm uniformly radiating over the entire area of the cuvette containing the cells  For HeLa 
cells after DNA-SWNT uptake we have experimented with the NIR radiation conditions 
and found that six 10s on-and-off pulses of 14 Wcm2 laser radiation can afford releasing 
effects without causing cell death After such treatment confocal imaging reveals 
colocalization of fluorescence of Cy3-DNA in the cell nucleus Fig 3a indicating 
releasing of DNA cargos from SWNT transporters and nuclear translocation after the 
laser pulses 
To glean the effects of NIR optical excitation of SWNTs inside living cells we 
carried out a control experiment by radiating an aqueous solution of Cy3-DNA 
functionalized SWNTs ex-vitro  We observed that radiation of a SWNT aqueous 
solution nanotube concentration 25mgL by 14Wcm2  808 nm laser continuously for 
2 min caused heating of the solution to 70 C Fig 3c boiling of solution was observed 
for even longer radiations  Without solubilized nanotubes the solution was transparent 
to 808 nm light with little heating detected These clearly showed that optically 
stimulated electronic excitations of SWNTs rapidly transferred to molecular vibration 
energies and caused heating Another phenomenon was that after ex-vitro NIR radiation 
of a Cy3-DNASWNT solution without cells an apparent increase in the Cy3 
fluorescence was observed Fig 3b indicating unwrapping and releasing of Cy3-DNA 
strands from nanotubes and thus reduced quenching of Cy3 by nanotubes  Taken 
together the results suggest that SWNTs internalized in living cells can act as tiny NIR 
heaters or antennas Opto-electronic excitations of nanotubes inside cells by NIR 
radiation can trigger endosomal rupture and releasing of non-covalent molecular cargos 
from nanotube carriers Once detached from nanotubes and freed into the cytoplasm the 
DNA molecules diffuse freely across the nuclear membrane 19 into the nucleus 
No apparent adverse toxicity effects were observed with cells after SWNT 
endocytosis and NIR-pulse 14Wcm2 activated DNA releasing and nuclear 
translocation in terms of short term viability Fig 4a and Supp Info and long term cell 
proliferation Supp Info  In a control experiment cells without exposure to SWNTs 
survived continuous 35Wcm2 808 nm laser radiation for 5 min Fig4b clearly 
illustrating high transparency of bio-systems to NIR light  In stark contrast for cells with 
internalized SWNTs extensive cell death was observed after 2 min radiation under a 
14Wcm2 power as evidenced by cell morphology changes Fig 4c vs Fig 4a4b loss 
of adherence to substrates and aggregation of cell debris Fig 4c Extensive local 
heating of SWNTs inside living cells due to continuous NIR absorption was the most 
likely origin of cell death Interestingly we observed that the dead cells released 
SWNTs to form black aggregates floating in the cell-medium solution visible to the 
naked eye approximately 24 h following irradiation Fig 4e inset black specks Raman 
spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy SEM identified SWNTs mixed with 
cell debris in the black aggregates The 266cm-1 Raman signal corresponded to 
aggregated SWNT bundles 20 while a broad photoluminescence peak observed around 
3200 cm-1 1050 nm Fig4c corresponded to individual tubes still in existence SEM 
of the black aggregates after drying revealed tube-like strands stretched across cell debris 
or residues from the cell culture medium Fig 4d inset Cracks appeared in the 
nanotube-cell debris structures during drying causing the aggregated bundles of 
nanotube to stretch across the cracks Thus we clearly observed that accompanied by cell 
death extensive NIR radiation caused molecular-detachment or de-functionalization of 
SWNTs inside cells leading to nanotube aggregation 
The result above hinted that if SWNTs can be selectively internalized into cancer 
cells with specific tumor markers NIR radiation of the nanotubes in-vitro can then 
selectively activate or trigger cell death without harming normal cells This important 
goal prompted us to develop SWNT functionalization schemes with specific ligands for 
recognizing and targeting tumorous cell types Folate receptors FR are common tumor 
markers expressed at high levels on the surfaces of various cancer cells and facilitate 
cellular internalization of folate-containing species via receptor-mediated endocytosis 
13 To exploit this system we obtained highly water soluble individualized SWNTs 
non-covalently functionalized by phospholipids PL-PEG-folic acid PL-PEG-FA 
Fig5a  FR-positive HeLa cells FRcells with over-expressed FRs on the cell surfaces 
were obtained by culturing cells in folic acid-depleted cell medium Both FRcells and 
normal-cells without abundant free FRs were exposed to PL-PEG-FA-SWNTs for 12-
18h washed and then radiated by 808 nm laser 14 Wcm2 continuously for 2 min After 
the NIR radiation we observed extensive cell death for the FRcells evidenced by drastic 
cell morphology changes Fig 5b while the normal-cells remained intact Fig 5c and 
exhibited normal proliferation behavior over  2 weeks that was the longest period 
monitored The selective destruction of FRcells suggested that PL-PEG-FA-SWNTs 
were efficiently internalized inside FRcells confirmed by fluorescence in Fig5d for 
SWNTs with FA cargo and FITC labels and not inside normal-cells confirmed by the 
lack of fluorescence inside cells in Fig5e The former was a result of selective binding 
of FA-functionalized SWNTs and FRs on FRcell surfaces and receptor-mediated 
endocytosis The latter was due to the inertness or blocking of non-specific binding of 
SWNTs imparted by the PEG moiety 6 on SWNTs and the lack of available FRs on the 
normal cells   
It is shown here that single walled carbon nanotubes are molecular transporters or 
carriers with very high optical absorbance in the near-infrared regime where biological 
systems are transparent This intrinsic property stems from the electronic band structures 
of nanotubes and is unique among transporters Our current work exploits this property 
with a 808 nm laser and can be extended to using light sources spanning the entire 
700-1100 nm range transparent to biosystems for more efficient in-vitro excitations of 
SWNTs with various chiralities to obtain enhanced biological effects NIR pulses can 
induce local heating of SWNTs in vitro for endosomal rupture and molecular cargo 
releasing for reaching intended targets without harming cells  On the other hand 
selective killing of cells over-expressing tumor markers can be achieved by selective 
delivery of nanotubes inside the cells via receptor-mediated uptake pathways and NIR 
triggered death  The scheme of SWNT functionalization by PEG-ligands can be 
generalized to various ligands or antibodies targeting very specific types of cells  While 
the PEG-moiety imparts inertness and little non-specific binding of nanotubes to normal 
cells the ligands can recognize cells with complementary receptors for SWNT 
internalization and subsequent cell destruction by NIR radiation Specifically 
functionalized nanotubes could then be a generic killer of various types of cancer cells 
without harming normal cells Thus the transporting capabilities of carbon nanotubes 
combined with suitable functionalization chemistry and the intrinsic optical properties of 
SWNTs can open up exciting new venues for drug delivery and cancer therapy
