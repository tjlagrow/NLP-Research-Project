INTRODUCTION
Under the inuence of extreme conditions such as
the strong gravitational eld around black holes mat-
ter  and even the vacuum  behaves in unexpected ways
and shows many fascinating phenomena1 like Hawking
radiation2 Although extremely hard to observe these
striking eects are very interesting form a fundamental
point of view for our understanding of black holes and
quantum gravity For example Hawkings discovery
of black hole evaporation2 surprisingly conrmed Beken-
steins thermodynamic interpretation3 of black holes Un-
derstanding this link to thermodynamics including the
origin of the black hole entropy and the related black
hole information paradox is one of the key questions of
quantum gravity
Since the options for an experimental or observa-
tional approach to these problems are rather limited
an alternative possibility would be to recreate the afore-
mentioned phenomena in suitable laboratory settings48
This idea will be pursued in the following After a short
review of the fundamental eects under consideration in
Sec II the underlying idea of analogue gravity is pre-
sented in Sec III In Sec IV these ideas are then ap-
plied to several laboratory systems which may allow us
to recreate the fundamental eects discussed in Sec II
Finally Sec V is devoted to the question of what can be
learnt from studying these analogies and the outline of
future directions
II FUNDAMENTAL EFFECTS
Let us start with a brief review of the fundamental ef-
fects under consideration together with some of their rel-
evant features Familiarity of the reader with the basic

concepts of general relativity and quantum eld theory
is assumed  even though the main points should hope-
fully also become evident to all other readers
A Penrose Process  Superradiance
In a stationary ie time-independent metric it is
possible to derive a locally conserved energy density for
the matter elds  as expected from the Noether theorem
Otherwise ie in a genuinely time-dependent metric
there will be an exchange of energy between the gravita-
tional eld and the matter elds in general For exam-
ple the conserved energy density of a massless and min-
imally coupled scalar eld reads   c  GN  kB  1

Let us specify the second part for the equatorial plane of
the Kerr metric9 describing a rotating black hole
gcid16 
2cid17  
with   r2  2M r  a2 where M is the ADM mass of
the black hole and a measures its rotation The inner and
outer horizons occur at r  M M 2  a2 ie where
  0 However even outside the horizons there is a
region where g becomes negative which is called the
ergo-region rergo  2  2M  r Remembering
Eq 1 we see that the conserved energy density may
become negative in this region This fascinating observa-
tion motivates the following striking phenomenon Imag-
ine a wave-packet stemming from spatial innity ie
with a positive energy which propagates into the ergo-
region and splits up inside this region into a wave-packet
which escapes to innity and another part which crosses
the outer horizon and is then trapped by the black hole
Now if the second trapped part has a negative energy
 which is possible inside the ergo-sphere  the remaining
part which escapes to innity must have an energy which
is greater than that of the incoming wave-packet due to
energy conservation Replacing wave-packets with par-
ticles this phenomenon is known as Penrose process10
and for waves it is called supperradiant scattering11 or
Zeldovich-Starobinsky eect12 The explicit derivation
can be done via the separation ansatz
mt r    eitimRmrSm 
Note that the applicability of this ansatz is non-trivial
since the Kerr geometry does not factorize hence the
additional m-dependence From the conversation of the
Wronskian associated to the ordinary dierential equa-
tion for Rmr one can derive the following relation
between the reection ie eld amplitude at spatial in-
nity and transmission at the horizon coecients
1  Rm2 
  mh
Tm2 
where h  a2M r is the angular frame-dragging
velocity at the horizon Consequently for the so-called
anomalous modes with   mh the reection coef-
cient is larger than unity
ie the reected wave is
stronger than the incident one Of course this energy
gain is taken from the gravitational mainly rotational
energy of the black hole which is diminished by back-
reaction eects remember that the in-falling part had
an eectively negative energy Enclosing the black hole
by a large ideal mirror reecting the amplied modes
back into the ergo-region would then generate an blow-
up instability11 black-hole bomb
B Unruh Eect
For non-rotating black holes the negative energies do
only occur inside the horizon and hence cannot be ex-
ploited in such a way if we stay on the classical level For
quantum elds however the local positivity of the en-
ergy density is a much more subtle issue and the negative-
energy states inside the horizon can be exploited by quan-
tum eects  such as Hawking radiation However before
turning to this striking phenomenon let us study another
quantum eect rst
The Minkowski vacuum is per denition empty
ie free of particles for all observersdetectors at rest
and also via its Lorentz invariance for all inertial ob-
serversdetectors moving with a constant velocity Inter-
estingly this situations changes in the presence of accel-
eration a Let us consider a uniformly accelerated trajec-
tory see Fig 1 Evaluating the proper co-moving wrist-
watch time along this trajectory we have to account for
the constantly changing Lorentz boost factor
 Z dtr1 
x2t
arsinhatc
Since the dynamics of a detector moving along this tra-
jectory is governed by its proper time   the linear re-
sponse of the detector can be inferred from the auto-
correlation function in the Minkowski vacuum vaci
hvac    vaci  
cosha   c  1
This expression is periodic along the imaginary proper
time-axis     2ica which motivates a thermal
response of the detector Indeed it can be shown quite
generally that a uniformly accelerated detector experi-
ences the inertial vacuum state as a thermal bath with
the Unruh temperature13

dhorizon
where dhorizon  c2a is the horizon size ie the min-
imum distance between the trajectory and the causally
disconnected region left Rindler wedge see Fig 1 The
horizon experience by the accelerated observer is also the
underlying reason for the thermal nature of the detec-
tor response The Minkowski vacuum 0Mini is a multi-
mode squeezed state containing pairs of particles in either

C Hawking Radiation
The Unruh eect described above is strongly related
to Hawking radiation2 via the principle of equivalence
In fact Bill Unruh13 discovered it when trying to un-
derstand black hole evaporation Imagine an imprudent
astronaut freely falling towards and nally through the
horizon Locally this freely falling astronaut is equiv-
alent to an inertial observer Another astronaut stay-
ing at a xed distance to the horizon however feels the
gravitational pull and thus corresponds to a uniformly
accelerated observer Now heshe can compare measure-
ments results with hisher unfortunate colleague As-
suming that the freely falling astronaut does not experi-
ence anything special when passing the horizon ie sees
a quantum state locally equivalent to the Minkowski vac-
uum as one would expect the results of the previous
section indicate that the stationary observer should see
a thermal spectrum Indeed assuming a regular quan-
tum state the black hole emits thermal radiation with
the Hawking temperature

where the surface gravity measures the gravitational ac-
celeration at the horizon see the following table

However in spite of the analogy sketched above there
are also crucial dierences between the Unruh eect and
Hawking radiation While the Unruh set-up is invariant
under time-reversal the acceleration remains unchanged
after t  t the Hawking scenario breaks this symme-
try  one can only fall into the black hole but never come
out see Sec II D below As a consequence the Unruh
eect is associated to a truly thermal bath containing an
equal amount of particles in both directions and thus no
net ux In contrast Hawking radiation corresponds to a
real energy out-ux black hole evaporation and does not
generate particles propagating from spatial innity into
the black hole Furthermore propagating the particles of
the Hawking radiation back in time and thereby undoing
the gravitational red-shift we nd that they originate
from modes with shorter and shorter wavelengths in the
past Within the framework of quantum elds in classical
curved space-times there is no limit to this time-reversed
squeezing process and thus these modes originate from an
energy region perhaps the Planck scale where this semi-
classical treatment breaks down and eects of quantum
gravity become important Ergo Hawkings prediction is
based on the extrapolation of a theory quantum elds in
classical curved space-times into an energy region where
it is expected to break down This observation poses
the question of whether the Hawking eect survives af-
ter incorporating the eects of quantum gravity at high
energies trans-Planckian problem
Let us study this question by implementing a change of
the dispersion relation   ck  k as a toy model15
for high-energy deviations from classical general relativ-
ity Using the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates

r cid19 dv2  2dv dr 
the wave equation of a massless scalar eld reads
cid182vr  rcid201 
 f 2
r cid21 rcid19   0 
where we have added a modication f k2 of the disper-
sion relation After a Fourier-Laplace transformation we
get the following integral equation
which can be solved via separation of variables

r Z dk
k  f k2cid3cid1 k  0 
gkcid27 
expcid26ikr  2iMZ
with the spectral function gk  1  f k2  2k
The integrand becomes singular at k where gk  0
which is just the solution of the dispersion relation far
away from the black hole r   Assuming that f k2
is an analytic function we may calculate the integral
by deforming the integration contour into the complex
plane16 Since M is supposed to be very large com-
pared to the Planck mass and  etc we may use the
saddle-point method We get two saddle points at large
and real wavenumbers of opposite sign k which are as
one would expect solutions of the dispersion relation for
nite r These are the in-modes 
in and we shall
assume that these short-wavelength modes are in their
ground state ainini  0 Finally for closing the
integration contour we have to circumvent the branch
cut originating from the singularity at k which just
yields the outgoing long-wavelength Hawking modes out
at r   Now we may calculate the particle content in
these out-modes out by connecting them to the in-modes
out  
in The Bogoliubov coef-
cient can be obtained by comparing the saddle-point
contributions at k and k and determine the particle
number via aout  ain  a

vgrkvphk
where k denotes the solution of the dispersion relation
for a given  far away from the black hole r  
while vgr and vph are the group and phase velocities at
that frequency If the dispersion relation becomes linear
  ck at small k or approaches that of a massive par-
ticle 2  m2c4  c2k2 we reproduce Eq 9 However
if the dispersion relation k rises too fast ie faster
than quadratic we would get an increasing amount of
radiation at high energies UV-catastrophe and the
black hole would evaporate quickly Such a case should
be excluded in view of our observational evidence of black
holes with macroscopic life-times
D Eardley Instability and Black-hole Laser
After altering the dispersion relation the Hawking par-
ticles do no longer originate from modes with arbitrar-
ily short wavelengths squeezed against the horizon De-
pending on the curvature of the dispersion relation the
short-wavelength modes are faster superluminal case
or slower subluminal case than the speed of light c
Hence the in-modes with k approach the horizon from
the inside superluminal case or the outside subluminal
case During that process they are stretched due to the
gravitational red-shift tidal forces and their wavelength
grows ie their group and phase velocity approaches c
Finally they are ripped apart by the horizon and one part
the Hawking particle escapes to innity while the re-
maining part the in-falling partner particle is trapped
This the in-falling partner particle has a negative energy
cf Sec II A and thereby compensates the energy emit-
ted by the Hawking radiation
As mentioned above this process is not symmetric un-
der time-reversal Now let us consider the time-reversed
situation Time-reversal turns a black hole where noth-
ing can escape into a white hole which nothing can
penetrate White holes are unstable solutions of the
Einstein equations  while they still exert the gravita-
tional attraction to everything they do not allow any-
thing to pass the white-hole horizon Naturally this
leads to a pile-up at the horizon until the dispersion
relation changes or non-linear eects set in Repeat-
ing the same analysis as before we nd that an in-going
low-wavenumber vacuum state is transformed to outgo-
ing high-wavenumber excitations This means that white
holes would decay very rapidly or turn into black holes
Eardley instability18
Another interesting eect may occur when a black-hole
horizon is combined with a white-hole horizon which ef-
fectively happens in the Reissner-Nordstrom metric de-
scribing a charged black hole In this case the negative-
energy wave packet may bounce back and forth between
the two horizons where it emits a Hawking wave each
time it hits the black-hole horizon and thereby constantly
grows similar to the black-hole bomb in Sec II A
This instability is called a black-hole laser19
E Cosmological Particle Creation
The phenomenon of particle creation is not restricted
to the gravitational eld around black or white holes
but may also occur in an expanding or contracting uni-
verse Let us specify the action of a scalar eld
2Z d4xpgcid2g    R2cid3 
for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric
ds2  a6tdt2  a2tdr2 
where at is the time-dependent scale factor of the Uni-
verse and R the Ricci curvature scalar  is the dimen-
sionless curvature coupling factor eg   16 for con-
formal coupling in 31 dimensions and   0 for minimal
coupling The wave equation reads
k cid2a4tk2  a6tRtcid3 k  0 
k and k  3
Accordingly each k-mode behaves as a harmonic oscil-
lator with a time-dependent potential 2
kt given by
kt  a4tk2  a6tRt Now if the temporal vari-
ation of kt is much slower than the internal frequency
 k  2
k etc the quantum state of
the harmonic oscillator will stay near the ground state
due to the adiabatic theorem However if the exter-
nal time-dependence kt generated by the cosmic ex-
pansion is too fast ie non-adiabatic the ground-state
wave-function cannot adapt to this change anymore and
thus the evolution will transform the initial ground state
into an excited state in general cosmological particle cre-
ation Since Eq 17 is linear the excited state is a
squeezed state
t  i  expXk
kakak  hc0i 
ie the particle are created in pairs of opposite wavenum-
bers due to momentum conservation
Basically the same mechanism is according to our
standard model of cosmology responsible for the genera-
tion of the seeds for structure formation out of the quan-
tum uctuations of the inaton eld This process hap-
pened during ination and at the end of this epoch the
amplied squeezed quantum uctuations were trans-
formed into densitytemperature variations via the de-
cay of the inaton eld Traces of these primordial den-
sitytemperature variations can still be observed today
in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background
radiation
F Gibbons-Hawking Eect
In contrast to cosmological particle creation discussed
above where the produced particles can be detected after
the expansion the Gibbons-Hawking eect20 concerns
the response of a detector during the expansion and is
more similar to the Unruh eect In order to point out
the dierence let us rewrite the Friedmann-Robertson-
Walker metric 16 in terms of the conformal time 
ds2  a2d2  dr2 
and consider a conformally invariant eld eg massless
scalar eld in 11 dimensions or the electromagnetic eld
in 31 dimensions
Amatter  
4Z d4xg F F  
where F is the eld strength tensor
F  A   A  A  A 
  
The last equality exploits the symmetry of the Christof-
fel symbols 
Inserting the metric 19 into
the action 20 we see that all factors of a cancel
and thus the eld modes in terms of  are just undis-
turbed plane waves Consequently there is no cosmolog-
ical particle creation in the sense of Sec II E conformal
vacuum However this does not mean that a photon
detector in such an expanding Universe would not click
In contrast to the photon modes the detector dynam-
ics is not labeled by the conformal time  but by the
proper time d 2  a2d2 Similar to Sec II B the
two-point correlation function  1  2 along the
detectors trajectory r  0 changes after transformation
to the proper time  and hence the detector will detect
excitations in general For example in the de Sitter Uni-
verse a   expH possessing a constant Hubble pa-
rameter H  aa the auto-correlation function of the
detector behaves as   2 where the scale factors
aa  1 stem from the coupling to the physical
degrees of freedom of the detector In terms of the proper
time   ln  this translates into  1 sinh2H   
which is analogous to Eq 6 Again we observe a pe-
riodicity in imaginary  -direction and hence expect a
behavior analogous to Unruh eect
Indeed it can be
shown20 that the proper-time detector experiences the
conformal vacuum as a thermal bath with a temperature
TGibbonsHawking 
G Schwinger Mechanism
It is instructive to identify common features of the var-
ious eects considered above Apart from rst example in
Sec II A and in some sense the one in Sec II D they
are pure quantum eects which do not occur on the classi-
cal level Eg the classical vacuum   0 remains empty
  0 for all non-inertial observers Furthermore the ef-
fects in Sec II A and II D of course do also have their
quantum analogues For quantized elds it is not neces-
sary to send a wave-packet into the rotating black hole
in order to obtain superradiance the in-going vacuum
uctuations are sucient to create outgoing radiation
In all of these quantum eects the in-going virtual
quantum vacuum uctuations are converted into real
wrt the detector under consideration particle pairs
by the external inuence eg the gravitational eld
These pairs are correlated even entangled and can be
described by a multi-mode squeezed state such as in
Eq 8 For cosmological particle creation the two par-
ticles have opposite momenta cf Eq 18 whereas for
the Unruh eect they live in distinct Rindler wedges
ie on dierent sides of the horizon The same is true
for the Gibbons-Hawking eect and the black-hole case
in Sec II C as well as Sec II A In the latter situation
each pair consists of an outgoing Hawking particle and
its in-falling partner with negative energy
In addition all of our examples are relativistic quan-
tum eects Thus for typical laboratory parameters
these eects are suppressed due to large value of c and
the smallness of  and partly GN  Finally for station-
ary scenarios the eects mentioned above can be un-
derstood in terms of the population of negative energy
states which liberates the energy necessary for creating
a real particle
From this point of view there is yet another ef-
the Schwinger
fect which also ts into this scheme
mechanism2125
In analogy to the gravitational eld
which rips apart the wave packet near the horizon a
strong enough electric eld may also pull an electron-
positron pair out of the vacuum This pair creation
induced by the strong electric eld is the main mecha-
nism for neutralization of charged black holes ie it is
stronger than Hawking radiation for signicantly charged
black holes However it is not tied to black holes and
might also occur in the laboratory Let us consider a con-
stant electric eld E  Eex for simplicity In this case
the dispersion relation of the electronspositrons reads
  qEx2  m2  k2 
As a result a classical electron trajectory with a given
positive energy  is incident from the right and then to-
tally reected at the classical turning point Positrons
can be pictured as holes ion the Dirac sea21 correspond-
ing to negative-energy states and hence obey the op-
posite behavior ie they are incident from the left and
totally reected back to the left The two sets of clas-
sical trajectories are separated by the gap between the
positive and negative energy states For E  0 this gap
is given by pos  m and neg  m In the presence
of an electric eld E  0 however the gap is tilted and
becomes x-dependent  which just correspond to the two
classical turning points In a quantum description how-
ever an electron from the Dirac sea may tunnel through
the gap and become a real particle  leaving behind a
hole ie a positron
If the eld E is not too strong
we may estimate the tunneling probability via the WKB
approximation For   ky  kz  0 we get the eikonal
of the exponential tail in the classically forbidden region
in analogy to tunneling trough a barrier from Eq 23
if the eective acoustic metric g
e is chosen in a spe-
cic way which is similar to the Painleve-Gullstrand-
Lematre form28 known from gravity

Hence the tunneling probability is exponentially sup-
pressed  expESE where ES  m2q is called
the Schwinger limit At that ultra-high eld strength
the work done separating the electron-positron pair over
a Compton wavelength is of the order of the binding en-
ergy 2m and higher-order processes become important
ie the above estimate fails
III LABORATORY ANALOGUES
The eects sketched in the previous sections are funda-
mental predictions of quantum eld theory in non-trivial
eg gravitational background congurations Testing
these predictions would be extremely interesting  but
unfortunately none of these eects has been directly ob-
served yet So far there are only indirect signatures
such as the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave back-
ground radiation mentioned in Sec II E This lack of
experimental evidence is mainly due to the suppression
of these eects by the smallness of  and 1c and the
resulting diculty of creating strong enough elds or ac-
celerations etc One way of overcoming this obstacles are
analogues using sound waves or other quasi-particles
instead of photons or electronspositrons and thereby
eectively replacing the speed of light c by the speed of
sound cs  c Of course it would also be very inter-
esting to nd scenarios with an eectively increased  in
addition but this option will not be discussed here
A The Acoustic Analogy
Analogies between laboratory systems and gravita-
tional elds have been known for a long time eg the
Gordon metric26 but it was probably Bill Unruh27 who
rst realized that one could exploit these similarities for
studying fundamental eects such as Hawking radiation
He considered sound waves v   in irrotational u-
ids   v  0 which obey the wave equation
cid18 
 v0  cid19     0 25
   v0cid19 0
s cid18 
where 0 and v0 denote the density and the velocity of
the background ow and cs is the speed of sound The
analogy to gravity is based on the striking observation
that this wave equation is quantitatively equivalent to
the dAlembertian in a curved space-time
2e 
ge
cid0ge g
e cid1  0 
As a result phonons propagating in this owing uid be-
have precisely in the same way as a scalar quantum
eld in a curved space-time described by the above met-
ric Even though the form 27 is not exible enough to
reproduce all possible gravitational elds eg it cannot
simulate the full Kerr geometry it is suciently gen-
eral to model rotating and non-rotating black or white
holes cf Secs II A II C and II D and an expanding
or contracting universe cf Sec II E The Unruh and
the Gibbons-Hawking eect discussed in Secs II B and
II F respectively require a more detailed consideration
of the phonon detector Recreating the Schwinger mech-
anism necessitates the analogue of a Dirac sea and thus
fermionic quasi-particles as well as the coupling to an
electric eld analogue An experiment along these lines
has been done in graphene29 However the quasi-particle
spectrum does not exhibit a mass gap in this system and
hence the analogy to the Schwinger mechanism is lim-
B Further Analogues
The analogy between condensate matter and grav-
ity is not restricted to sound waves it may apply to
other quasi-particles as well
If the quasi-particles are
Goldstone-modes ie gap-less and can be described by
a single scalar eld  the most general linearized low-
energy eective action reads30

 G  O3  O3 
Identifying G  g
epge we again nd
where G is governed by the underlying condensed-
matter system and may depend on space and time in
general
a qualitative analogy to gravity Apart from phonons
examples for such quasi-particles are surface waves rip-
plons on top of owing liquids31 or photons with a xed
polarization in wave guides32 or optical bers33 Under
additional assumptions the analogy can also be extended
to non-scalar quasi-particles One example are photons
in a moving dielectric medium with an arbitrary four-
velocity u and a constant scalar permittivity  whose
behavior is analogous to a curved space-time with the
Gordon metric26

It is even possible to model the 11 dimensional Dirac
equation ie spin-12 particles within a slow-light set-
up34 but these excitations do still obey bosonic commu-
tation relations ie there is no Dirac sea
C Analogue Gravity
Let us apply the concepts and tools from general rel-
ativity to the acoustic metric 27 most of the other
eective metrics are very similar Comparing Eqs 27
and 1 we see that an ergo-region occurs for supersonic
ow velocities v2
s  A horizon on the other hand
corresponds to a closed surface at which the normal ow
velocity exceeds the speed of sound v  cs For a radial
or eectively one-dimensional ow the two points coin-
cide but for a maelstrom-type ow which can still be
locally irrotational there is a nite ergo-region outside
the horizon Since the eective energy of the phonons
may become negative in this region we may obtain su-
perradiance eects
FIG 2 Sketch of a de Laval nozzle as an analogue for a black
hole The solid black lines denote the walls of the nozzle and
the dotted blue curves are the streamlines of the ow At
the entrance of the nozzle right the ow is sub-sonic v  c
The ow velocity exceeds the speed of sound at the narrowest
point and exits the nozzle left with a super-sonic velocity
The phonons are depicted by green circles In the sub-sonic
region right they may propagate in both directions  but
in the supersonic part left they are swept away and cannot
escape anymore Hence the border red dashed line between
the two regions is analogous to a black hole horizon with the
right half of the nozzle corresponding to the outside of the
black hole and left half modelling the black hole interior
If the ow is accelerated following a streamline form
subsonic to supersonic velocities such as in a de Laval
nozzle cfFig 2 we obtain the analogue of a black-hole
horizon which traps all sound waves The time-reverse
ie a ow decelerated from supersonic back to subsonic
speed would correspond to a white-hole horizon which
expels all phonons As one would expect from the discus-
sion in Sec II D such a ow prole is typically plagued
with instabilities towards the generation of shock waves
Generating the analogue of a black hole horizon in a
de Laval nozzle for example the same arguments as in
Hawkings original derivation2 would imply a thermal
phonon ux moving upstream Even if we send in the
uid at zero temperature the in-going quantum uctu-
ations of the phonon modes will be ripped apart by the
horizon and generate excitations in the form of phonon
pairs One phonon escapes to the entrance of the nozzle
and the other one is swept away toward its exit
serting the acoustic metric 27 the surface gravity is

Inserting typical values for potential condensed matter
analogues we obtain relatively low temperatures  which
are however still orders of magnitude larger than for as-
tronomical black holes Of course the trans-Planckian
problem does also play a role here because the Hawk-
ing phonons originate from modes with very short wave-
lengths where uid dynamics breaks down In contrast
to quantum gravity we do know at least in principle
the correct microscopic theory for uids  and thus we
may address the trans-Planckian problem
If a change
of the dispersion relation describes the relevant devia-
tion from uid dynamics at short length scales we may
employ the methods sketched in Sec II C cfFig 3
Other eects such as non-linear interactions however
are much less understood
Finally the metric 27 can also model an expanding or
contracting universe There are basically two possibilities
which can be combined an expansion or contraction of
the uid and variations in the local speed of sound
IV LABORATORY SYSTEMS
Now after having briey discussed the underlying
analogy we are in the position to study some explicit
condensed-matter examples The following selection is
not exhaustive but aimed at providing a rough overview
and indicating possible future directions
A Trapped Ions
Let us start with a system where the technology for
cooling to the ground state and detecting single particles
is most advanced  a chain of ions in a trap Assuming
that the radial connement is very tight it is sucient
to consider the positions qi of the ions in axial direction
In the presence of a time-dependent harmonic axial trap

The classical equations of motion can be solved in terms
of a single scale parameter given by

In order to obtain the phonon modes we split the full
quantum position operator qit into the classical solu-
tion btq0

position q0

axt  Rt we obtain a strik-
ing similarity to Eq 17 Moreover both Rt and
axt are related to the second time-derivatives of the
corresponding scale factors at and bt As a result of
the analogy between Eqs 33 and 17 we obtain the
analogue of cosmological particle creation in an ion trap
with a time-dependent axial trapping strength 2
Accordingly the initial phonon creation and annihilation
operators a
0 and a0 are related to the nal phonon
operators via the Bogoliubov transformation

cal solid lines and motional vertical dashed lines levels and
the associated transitions arrows
which exactly corresponds to the squeezed state in
Eq 18 via   coshk and   sinhk
The created phonon pairs can be detected via suitable
red-sideband Raman transitions see Fig 4 Initially the
ions are in the electronic A and motional ground state
n  0 Then applying a Raman -pulse a  d would
transfer the full population into the meta-stable state B
without actually populating the excited state C due to
the large detuning  If we apply an additional detuning
n to one of the Laser beams only ie a rst n  1 or
second n  2 side-band transition b  d or c  d respec-
tively we may selectively transfer population from the
excited motional levels n  1 or n  2 only to the state B
Since the occupation of that meta-stable state B could
be measured by suitable detected by resonance uores-
cence methods we may infer the initial motional level It
is even possible to distinguish two-phonon states n  2
from one-particle excitations n  1 which could be used
to discriminate the quantum eect squeezed state with
phonon pairs from classical eects such as heating35
In contrast to the above analogue to cosmological par-
ticle creation in an ion trap where the produced phonons
are measured after varying the trap frequency 2
there has been another proposal for detecting phonons
during the expansion of the ion cloud36 However the
latter proposal poses several technical and conceptual
problems Since the phonon modes are not conformally
invariant one would obtain some sort of combination
of the Gibbons-Hawking eect and cosmological parti-
cle creation cf Eq 34 which has not been taken into
account suciently Furthermore resolving the phonon
energies  requires a suciently long measurement time
t  OE  O Sustaining an exponential
expansion during such a long time is of course very dif-
cult Finally the ion dynamics 32 was not included
adequately
In summary the analogue of cosmological particle cre-
ation should be realizable experimentally with present-
day technology in fact the experimental eorts are al-
ready under way35 Unfortunately simulating the other
quantum eects with this set-up seems to be more com-
plicated The main reason for these diculties lies in the
restricted parameter range eg number and distance of
ions for which the coherent control can be maintained
As mentioned before the advantages of this set-up lies
in the ability to cool very close to the motional plus
electronic ground state better than 90 and to detect
single phonons
B Bose-Einstein Condensates
Another laboratory system capable of achieving very
low temperatures experimentally is a Bose-Einstein
condensate37 In the dilute-gas limit it can be described
by the many-particle Hamiltonian density
H  cid18
 Vextt r 
 cid19  
where m is the mass of the condensed particles eg
atoms and Vextt r the external trap potential The
coupling g  0 describes the repulsion between the parti-
cles in s-wave scattering approximation and generates
the internal pressure p For dilute condensates consist-
ing of many particles the bosonic eld operator can be
approximately replaced by a c-number    at low
temperatures The order parameter  corresponds to
the macroscopically occupied wave function of the con-
densate and obeys the Gross-Pitaevski equation
i  cid18
 Vextt r  g2cid19  
Inserting the Madelung split t r  pt r eiStr
into density  and phase S we obtain the equation of
continuity     v  0 for the condensate velocity
v  Sm and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation

strongly resembles the Bernoulli equation apart from the
term on the rhs Indeed on length scales much larger
than the healing length   1mg this term can be
neglected and we obtain a uid dynamic description at
distances  
Therefore the condensate can be described by an ir-
rotational uid Vorticity may only occur via drilling a
hole in the condensate ie a vortex at which center the
condensate density vanishes Going around the vortex
the phase of the wave-function  changes by an integer
multiple of 2 due to the single-valued character of the
wave-function  Therefore the circulation is quantized
according to  H dr v  2Nm On very large scales
however a collection of many vortices seems to approach
the classical Euler equation with rotation and even vis-
cisity shedding of phonons and vortex rings including
phenomena like turbulence vortex tangle
The equation of state can be inferred from 37 to be
p  g22m Hence the sound velocity is given by
s  gm and the sound dispersion relation can be ob-
tained by linearizing 37

Thus for dilute condensates deviations from uid dy-
namics at short wavelengths   O manifest them-
selves in a departure of the dispersion relation from the
phonon branch csk towards the free-particle behavior
k22m Apart from our good theoretical understand-
ing of Bose-Einstein condensates which is far less de-
veloped for most other uids they oer a high degree
of experimental controllability The external potential
Vext can be generated by laser beams and thus there are
no walls38 which might induce friction etc One may
even realize eectively lower-dimensional condensates if
the transversal length scales are far below the healing
length  Furthermore Bose-Einstein condensates are
coupled only very weakly to the environment which al-
low us to reach extremely low temperatures of order
nano-Kelvin Finally for non-trivial topologies one may
generate persistent currents via trapping ux quanta im-
printed on phase S
Both our good theoretical understanding and the
high degree of experimental controllability render Bose-
Einstein condensates an ideal play-ground for theoretical
and hopefully experimental investigations of the analogy
to gravity In fact most of the studies so far have been
devoted to this system
In time-of-ight experiments
one uses an expansion of the condensate cloud in order
to spatially amplify the desired signal On the classi-
cal level the expansion can be described in terms of
a scaling parameter similar to Eq 32 The quantum
uctuations of the phonons however should imply ef-
fects analogous to cosmological particle creation resulting
in frozen density on the percent-level variations simi-
lar to cosmic ination3940 Alternatively expanding or
contracting universes can be modelled4042 by temporal
variations of the coupling g eg via a Feshbach reso-
nance It is even possible to simulate a change of the
signature of the metric by switching from repulsive to
attractive interactions43 which leads to a Bose-nova
instability44 For these eects the healing length  in
Eq 38 provides a natural UV cut-o and allows us to
study its impact on the spectrum of produced particles45
By inserting an atomic quantum dot as a detector
model into the condensate
it is also possible to sim-
ulate the Gibbons-Hawking eect46 in a condensate in
one spatial dimension remember that the scalar eld is
conformally invariant in 11 dimensions Going a step
further and moving the atomic quantum dot through the
otherwise static condensate with a varying velocity one
may pick up excitations due to non-adiabatic response of
the quantum uctuations47 This quantum eect is a
bit similar to the Unruh eect but there are important
dierences The non-adiabatic response is caused by the
Doppler shift and hence works in the desired way in a
certain direction only and not by a real Lorentz time
dilatation an in 5
Classical eects such as superradiance the white-hole
instability and the black-hole laser have been observed
numerically by simulating the Gross-Pitaevski equation
36 and should also be accessible experimentally48 For
example a multiply quantized vortex which is known to
be unstable is surrounded by the analogue of an ergo-
region as in the Kerr metric and superradiance-like eects
should play a role in its decay
In a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate
possible to mix the two species via optical transitions and
thus to simulate a massive Klein-Fock-Gordon equation49
via eectively breaking the U 1  U 1 symmetry down
to U 1 This construction provides an example for the
possible interplay between the cut-o scale and the mass
scale50
Finally
for Hawking radiation in Bose-Einstein
condensates51 the characteristic temperatures can be es-
timated from 30 Since the curved space-time analogy
breaks down at length scales smaller than the healing
length typically below a micrometer and the speed of
sound is of order mms we get a maximum Hawking
temperature of order nano-Kelvin52 The detection of
the small number of emitted phonons could in principle53
be done with similar methods as described in Sec IV A
cf Fig 4 but for Bose-Einstein condensates this tech-
nology is not as far advanced as for ion traps Another
interesting idea for detecting the Hawking process is to
look at density-density correlations across the horizon54
which show characteristic peaks due to the entanglement
between the Hawking radiation and their partner parti-
cles described by a multi-mode squeezed state as in 8
However inserting typical values these peaks are very
weak and thus extremely hard to observe
Unfortunately besides the aforementioned advantages
Bose-Einstein condensates go along with a major draw-
back All the gaseous condensates realized in the lab-
oratory are only meta-stable states  the true ground
state is a solid The main decay channels of the gaseous
state are inelastic three-body collisions Such an event
transforms three indistinguishable bosons from the cloud
into a molecule plus a remaining boson which carries
away the large excess energymomentum  and thereby
all three of them are eectively extracted from the con-
densate formed of low-energy bosons Now if all three
of these bosons stem from the same macroscopically oc-
cupied single-particle wave-function  of the condensate
k  0 three-body collisions would just slowly diminish
the number of condensed bosons However in the pres-
ence of inter-particle interactions g  0 which are nec-
essary for the propagation of sound the many-particle
ground state does also contain a small population of the
higher single-particle states k  0 This small fraction
is called quantum depletion since it is generated by the
quantum uctuations plus the interaction g Thus if
one of the three bosons involved in the inelastic collision
stems from the quantum depletion and is removed this
event causes a deviation from the many-particle ground
state  ie an excitation55 Ergo three-body collisions
do also heat up the condensate which might swamp the
quantum signal to be detected56 For example consider-
ing a Bose-Einstein condensate containing 107 particles
and 1 quantum depletion with 1 three-body losses in
total during the experiment which are already quite op-
timistic values there would be O103 noise phonons in
addition to the weak Hawking signal In order to avoid
this problem and other issues such as the black hole
laser instability it is probably desirable to employ a
very fast detection method
C Surface Waves
As mentioned in Sec III B the analogy to gravity is not
limited to phonons but may apply to other quasi-particles
as well As one example the propagation of surface waves
ripplons on top of locally irrotational owing liquids
corresponds to an eective metric very similar to Eq 27
at long distances This includes gravity waves not to be
confused with gravitational waves in owing water as
well as third sound ie surface waves in liquid Helium
where gravity is replaced by van-der-Waals forces
As a result the vortex ow which occurs when draining
the bath tub for example exhibits similarities to a ro-
tating black hole and some of the associated instabilities
might be related to superradiance As another scenario
which can be realized in a sink we may let the water
jet from the tab impinge perpendicularly onto a at sur-
face eg the sink bottom and thereby generate a radial
diverging ow For suitable parameters the radial ow
is faster than the surface wave speed ie superlumi-
nal in the middle and becomes slower subluminal
at some given radius This point corresponds to a white-
hole horizon57 and is known as hydraulic jump in view of
the instabilities occurring there the quasi-regular radial
ow in the middle becomes irregular beyond that radius
and the water height changes abruptly jump The in-
stabilities generating this phenomenon are probably re-
lated to the Eardley eect
out frequency modes 
A similar experiment has been carried out in a wa-
ter tank58 which was quite large in order to minimize
viscosity eects etc and allowed the quantitative de-
termination of the mixing of positive 
out and nega-
tive 
out 
in roughly analogous to the time-reversed Hawking
process cf Sec II C However the measured results 
and  did not match the expected values and the curved
space-time analogy probably does not apply quantita-
tively to this experiment
out  
In summary the simulation of classical eects with sur-
face waves is potentially dicult but in principle possible
 while it is hard to see how analogues of quantum phe-
nomena could be detected
D Optical Fibers and Wave-Guides
In order to model a black hole horizon for electromag-
netic waves in the same way as in the previous sections
the velocity of the medium should exceed the speed of
light in that medium59 at some point cf Eq 29 Unless
one uses meta-materials or other slow-light media which
induce further problems34 this is very dicult to realize
experimentally Therefore one may chose an alternative
route Instead of actually moving the medium one could
send a pulse representing a phase boundary through the
medium such that the speed of light in front of the pulse
is larger than its velocity of propagation  whereas the
speed of light behind the pulse is smaller Transforming
to the inertial reference fame co-moving with the pulse
we see that it also corresponds to a black hole horizon
This scenario facilitates much larger velocities and
hence higher Hawking temperatures cf Eq 30 For
electromagnetic wave-guides32 supporting radio or micro
waves the Hawking temperature could range up to frac-
tions of a Kelvin For optical bers33 the value could be
even larger However for normal non-linear optical me-
dia where the refractive index increases with intensity
the Kerr eects tends to make the front end of a light
pulse ie the black hole horizon at and its rear end
ie the white hole horizon steep As a result the eec-
tive surface gravity for the black hole horizon and hence
the Hawking temperature becomes rather small while
the eective surface gravity for the white hole horizon is
increased For this reason the recent experiment in op-
tical bers33 considered the white hole horizon and mea-
sured the classical mixing of positive 
out and nega-
tive 
out 
in roughly analogous to the time-reversed Hawking
process cf Sec II C
out frequency modes 
out  
One of the main advantages of these electromagnetic
scenarios lies in the fact that the amplication and de-
tection of photons in the relevant energy range is much
easier than in the case of phonons Nevertheless observ-
ing quantum eects is still quite hard because the small
signal to be detected arrives just before the huge pulse in
the black hole case or even worse just after the pulse
for white hole analogues
E Ultra-intense Lasers and the Unruh Eect
In all of the previous example the speed of light in vac-
uum has been eectively replaced by the reduced prop-
agation velocity of quasi-particles such as phonons rip-
plons or photons in a medium In the following we shall
discuss a scenario where this is not the case and consider
a real relativistic quantum eect With modern lasers it
is possible to reach extremely high intensities via suitable
focussing techniques60 Electrons under the inuence of
these strong electric elds would undergo an immense ac-
celeration and thus experience the Minkowski vacuum as
a thermal state with a relatively large temperature61
However the electron is not a good photon detector
since it cannot absorb a photon while passing to an ex-
cited internal state  and thus directly observing the Un-
ruh eect is rather dicult On the other hand the elec-
tron can scatter photons from one into another mode
via Thomson or Compton scattering Consequently
switching to the accelerated frame co-moving with the
electron there is a nite probability that the electron
scatters a virtual photon out of the thermal bath
into another mode
In terms of the squeezed state in
Eq 8 this corresponds to a
R rightkaR rightk0Mini
with k  k due to energy conservation in the ac-
celerated frame Translation back into the inertial frame
yields the creation of an entangled pair of photons out of
the quantum vacuum uctuations due to the non-inertial
scatterer This result can be understood in the following
way Since the Minkowski vacuum is annihilated by a
linear combination of Rindler operators in the left and
right wedges13
cid16ea a
R left  aR rightcid17 0Mini  0 
removing one Rindler particle aR rightk0Mini from the
right wedge eg via absorption by the accelerated de-
tector leaves its partner particle in the left wedge behind
R left0Mini and thereby liberates it to become a real
excitation62 Furthermore inserting an additional parti-
cle into the right wedge a
R rightk0Mini does also cause
a deviation from the vacuum state 0Mini and thus cor-
responds to a real excitation ie photon
The created photon pairs may then serve as a signa-
ture of the Unruh eect and their entanglement eg in
polarization63 reects the correlations between the left
and right Rindler wedge cf Eq 8 As stated before
these correlations across the horizon are genuine features
of the considered quantum eects such as Hawking radi-
ation The two-photon nature of these signatures of the
Unruh eect should at least in principle allows us to
distinguish it from other eects such as classical Larmor
radiation given o by all accelerated charges
For a close analogy to the Unruh eect uniform ac-
celeration one would like to have a very strong and ap-
proximately constant electric eld and a negligible mag-
netic eld However it is rather hard to obtain a strong
enough quantum signal in this set-up and to distinguish
it from the classical background A stronger signal and
better discrimination from Larmor radiation could be
achieved via an alternative scenario which does how-
ever no longer correspond to uniform acceleration Col-
liding an ultra-relativistic electron beam with a counter-
propagating laser pulse the electric eld felt by the elec-
trons and hence their acceleration is strongly amplied
by the Lorentz boost factor Furthermore the quantum
Unruh signal and the classical Larmor background are
better separated in phase space energy and momentum
in this situation63
Finally
it should be mentioned that there are also
further indirect signatures of the Unruh eect64 some
of them have already been observed For example the
residual polarization variance of electrons in accelerator
rings can partly be attributed to the Unruh eect65 The
orbiting electron is constantly though not uniformly
accelerated and thus experiences the Minkowski vac-
uum as a nearly thermal bath which inhibits a perfect
polarization65 Another example are accelerated atoms
in a cavity66 However in this scenario the main signal is
not generated by the actual acceleration of the atom but
by non-adiabatic switching eects Therefore this set-up
displays more similarities to the ion-trap conguration in
Sec IV A
F Schwinger Mechanism in the Laboratory
With the laser systems currently under preparation67
it should become possible to approach the Schwinger
limit ES within two orders of magnitude in the focus of
the high-intensity laser Via high-harmonic focusing68
it may even be possible to reach much higher inten-
sities Therefore the experimental observation of the
Schwinger mechanism which is a non-perturbative QED
vacuum eect may become within reach in the near fu-
ture Note that its non-perturbative character clearly
distinguishes the Schwinger mechanism from perturba-
tive multi-photon pair-creation eects which have al-
ready been observed in accelerators
However since it is probably rather hard to actu-
ally reach the Schwinger limit ES and the pair-creation
rate is exponentially non-perturbatively suppressed 
expESE it is desirable to increase the signal As
one possibility one could superimpose the strong and
slow electric eld with weak and fast electromagnetic
wiggles of frequency   m Even though these wig-
gles cannot produce electron-positron pairs directly they
help the virtual electrons to penetrate into the gap and
thus decrease the distance between the classical turning
points x  m  qE As a result the tunnelling
exponent in Eq 24 is altered to
dxpm2  qEx  2 
4qE  fcid18 
mcid19 
with f     2 arcsin1  2  41  21  
which can be approximated by f   21   in the
relevant interval   0 1 Consequently the tunnelling
exponent can be decreased by the weak and fast electro-
magnetic wiggles69 eg for   12 the pair-creation
rate scales with  expES2E which is a huge
enhancement for E  ES
V THE BIG PICTURE
Now after having discussed various scenarios for recre-
ating fundamental eect is the laboratory let us turn to
the question of what we can learn form these consider-
ations First and foremost these scenarios facilitate at
least in principle an experimental test of the striking
predictions of quantum eld theory in non-trivial back-
grounds This allows us to test the methods assump-
tions and approximations underlying these predictions
cf the trans-Planckian problem discussed in Sec II C
for example Furthermore after detecting the desired ef-
fect itself we might experimentally study corrections in-
duced by interactions between the quasi-particles which
are theoretically not fully understood as well as non-
perturbative aspects eg the Schwinger mechanism
Apart from these experimental issues the study of the
laboratory analogues does also provide new ideas for in-
vestigating the possible microscopic structures of quan-
tum gravity inspired by condensed matter For example
the trans-Planckian issue can be approached via consid-
ering a change in the dispersion relation cf Sec II C
These calculations suggest that in the absence of a
UV-catastrophe Hawking radiation is basically a low-
energy process This observation casts some doubt on
the frequently suggested resolution of the black hole in-
formation paradox postulating subtle correlations in
the outgoing Hawking radiation which carry away the
information If the Hawking particles are created at low
energies near the horizon it is hard to see how they can
be inuenced by the information stored in the black
hole which is presumably located near the singularity
As another important point the laboratory analogues
constitute nice examples for the distinction between uni-
versal emergent phenomena and system-specic micro-
scopic features which is also crucial for our understand-
ing of quantum gravity While an eective metric ie an
eective Lorentz invariance seems to emerge naturally in
many condensed matter systems the principle of equiva-
lence and the Einstein equations require some additional
input kinematic versus dynamics The combination of
kinematic and dynamics becomes relevant for the back-
reaction of quantum uctuations onto the approximately
classical background Studying Bose-Einstein conden-
sates as an example one nds that the naive sum of
the zero-point energypressure of the phonon modes up
to some cut-o yields a completely wrong result70 This
lesson should be relevant for the cosmological constant
problem for example
The analogy to condensed matter does also teach us
that quantizing a classical macroscopic theory is not al-
ways working even though the quantization of the lin-
earized quasi-particles might work In the case of elec-
trodynamics the direct transition from classical to quan-
tum description was very successful For uid dynamics
however this procedure is very problematic For exam-
ple starting from the classical Euler equation one does
not get the quantization of vorticity right In the case
of superuids for instance the circulation quantum de-
pends on the mass of the condensed particles which does
not appear at all in the classical Euler equation The
main question then is whether gravity is more similar
to electrodynamics where a direct quantization works
very well or to uid dynamics where the correct quan-
tization requires some knowledge about the microscopic
structure The underlying symmetries the complex con-
straint structure and the UV-divergences resulting from
a naive quantization seem to point towards the latter 
but this question must be answered in the future
Finally the analogy between condensed matter and
gravity does also allow us to understand laboratory
physics from a dierent point of view ie in terms of
the universal geometrical concepts eg horizons known
from gravity For low energies we may forget the un-
derlying microscopic structure and consider the eective
metric only As a result very dierent condensed matter
systems  such as an expanding uid on the one hand and
a medium at rest with a time-dependent speed of sound
on the other hand  may exhibit basically the same physi-
cal eects eg cosmological particle creation due to the
coordinate invariance of the eective metric
