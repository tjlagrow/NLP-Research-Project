Abstract Massive black holes MBHs are nowadays recognized as integral parts of galaxy evo-
lution Both the approximate proportionality between MBH and galaxy mass and the expected
importance of feedback from active MBHs in regulating star formation in their host galaxies
point to a strong interplay between MBHs and galaxies MBHs must form in the rst galaxies
and be fed by gas in these galaxies with continuous or intermittent inows that at times can
be larger than the Eddington rate Feedback from supernovae and from the MBHs themselves
modulates the growth of the rst MBHs While current observational data only probe the most
massive and luminous MBHs the tip of the iceberg we will soon be able to test theoretical mod-
els of MBH evolution on more normal MBHs the MBHs that are indeed relevant in building
the population that we observe in local galaxies including our own Milky Way
Keywords quasars general black hole physics galaxies evolution
1 Introduction
Quasars have now been detected up to z  7 Mortlock et al 2011 The current
sample based on optical and near-infrared data is characterized by high luminosity
and large estimated black hole BH masses see Fig 1 in Wu et al 2015 Some fainter
candidates have been proposed based on X-ray observations Fiore et al 2012 Giallongo
 et al 2015 but they have not been conrmed yet Weigel et al 2015 The MBHs
powering these quasars have masses in excess of 108 Mcid12 reaching 1010 Mcid12 They are as
massive as the largest MBHs today but were in place when the Universe was less than
one billion years old The properties of quasars at z  6 require MBHs to form early
on and grow rapidly An initial MBH with mass 200 Mcid12 must grow continuously at the
Eddington rate to reach 109 Mcid12 by z  7 A seed MBH with mass 105 Mcid12 needs to
accrete only at half of the Eddington rate for the entire time or at the Eddington rate
for a half of their life In contrast to such monsters the MBH population extends down
to small masses though this range is hard to probe The record for the smallest MBH
currently belongs to the dwarf galaxy RGG 118 which is thought to contain a black
hole weighing only  50000 Mcid12 Baldassare et al 2015 There are also galaxies bereft
of MBHs eg M33 NGC 205 Gebhardt et al 2001 Valluri et al 2005 Therefore
models of MBH formation feeding and feedback must explain both the advent of the
rst luminous quasars why some galaxies host a MBH and some others do not and how
dierent MBHs are fed while providing at the same time the AGN feedback required
to suppress star formation in massive galaxies In this contribution we briey review

2 BH formation
Dierent MBH formation mechanisms have been proposed in the literature see Fig 1
starting from Rees 1984 Some proposed mechanisms such as primordial inationary
MBHs Khlopov et al 2005 and cosmic string loops Bramberger et al 2015 are not
directly linked to galaxy formation and I refer the reader to the original papers for
details Recent reviews on the other processes include Volonteri 2010 Haiman 2013
We will discuss here only one parameter relevant to MBH formation the metallicity
of the gas or stars that go into MBH formation The crucial reason is related to stellar
evolution and specically mass losses through winds Yungelson et al 2008 study the
fate of solar composition stars in the mass range 60-1000 Mcid12 They nd that they shed
most of their mass via winds and are expected to end their lives as MBHs less massive than
 150 Mcid12 At low metallicity instead mass loss due to winds is much more reduced thus
increasing the mass of the nal remnant Spera et al 2015 MBH formation mechanisms
that require an intermediate phase of supermassive star therefore need to occur in
metal poor conditions unless the star can collapse directly through general relativistic
instability Fowler 1966 Baumgarte  Shapiro 1999 Shibata  Shapiro 2002 Such
metallicity requirements do not apply to models that invoke stellar mass MBH mergers
Davies et al 2011 Miller  Davies 2012 Lupi et al 2014
One important point to keep in mind is that MBH formation must be common enough
to account for MBHs in galaxies such as the Milky Way as well in dwarf galaxies Greene

bottom so that luminosity remains sub-Eddington while accretion is super-critical
direct collapse at zero eg Latif et al 2013 Regan et al 2014 or very low metallicity
Latif et al 2015 fostered by a substantial Lyman-Werner ux seem to require very
stringent conditions leading to a very low expected number density Habouzit et al 2015
and references therein but see Agarwal et al 2015 While this mechanism predicting
very high seed masses around 105 Mcid12 Lodato  Natarajan 2007 Ferrara et al 2014 is
favoured by timescale arguments for growing high-z quasars it seems unable to seed run-
of-the-mill galaxies One or more MBH formation mechanisms can occur in the Universe
though they are not necessarily mutually exclusive eg Volonteri  Begelman 2010
Devecchi et al 2012
3 BH feeding
The very bright quasars with z  6 require to be fed at the Eddington level for
their whole lifetime Are such long-lived accretion events possible Li et al 2007 using
series of successive mergers extracted from a cosmological run suggested that merger-
driven accretion does the trick Di Matteo et al 2012 propose instead direct accretion
from the cosmic cold ows They use direct cosmological simulations but with relatively
low resolution 1 kpc At the other extreme Bournaud et al 2011 use very high
resolution 1 pc but isolated disc galaxy simulations to suggest that accretion is driven
by disc instabilities in high-z galaxies Finally Dubois et al 2012 use cosmological
zooms with a maximum resolution of  10 pc to nd that direct accretion of cosmic gas

dominates early on disc feeding takes over at later times and galaxy mergers become
important even later on
In all these studies the simulation provides information on the gas inowing from the
galaxy The accretion rate on the MBH is calculated from this inow rate with an ex-
plicit cap at the Eddington luminosity In a real galaxy how does it know that it has to
feed the MBH exactly at the rate resulting in the Eddington luminosity It is important
to stress that super-critical accretion does not necessarily imply highly super-Eddington
luminosity At high accretion rates the thermodynamics and geometry of the accretion
disc changes eg slim discs Abramowicz et al 1988 The material is so dense and
optically thick that photons are advected inward with the gas rather than diuse out
Radiation is trapped and luminosity highly suppressed Begelman 1979 L  ln M
instead of L  M  Short periods of super-critical accretion are sucient to ease the con-
straints on the growth of billion solar masses MBHs at z  6 eg Volonteri  Rees 2005
Volonteri et al 2015 As proof of concept Pacucci et al 2015 perform 1D simulation
including radiation transfer of a high-z halo feeding a seed MBH The radiation-related
quantities are integrated over frequencies with matter and radiation coupled via Thom-
son electron scattering and bound-free interactions The accretion rate is calculated at
the innermost cell 0002 pc and the accretion and radiative eciencies are implemented
in two ways In one series of runs the standard case luminosity is calculated with a
xed matter-energy conversion factor   01 and L  fEddLEdd In the slim disc
case only a fraction of the emitted luminosity escapes to innity and the disc becomes
radiatively inecient with   004 Mineshige et al 2000 and L  lnfEddLEdd The
eective accretion on the MBH is modulated by gas inows feeding the MBH and radi-
ation pressure sweeping back the gas The evolution of MBH masses and the Eddington
rate are shown in Fig 2 While in standard case the MBH accretes  5  15 of the
available gas in  100 Myr with outows modulating the gas inows in the slim disc
case the MBH accretes  80 of the available gas in  10 Myr with outows playing a
negligible role
4 BH feedback
Feedback from MBHs is an important ingredient to understanding the relationship
between galaxy and black hole growth Silk  Rees 1998 Winds from active MBHs
nd the easiest path through low-density gas avoiding the dense parts of the galaxy
disc Gabor  Bournaud 2014 Roos et al 2015 Cosmological simulations show that
rather than tearing apart the galaxy the AGN create large-scale polar outows that
eventually destroy the cold circumgalactic medium leaving a hot halo and strangling the
host galaxys supply of cold gas Dubois et al 2013 Costa et al 2014 Tremmel et al
2015 in prep This is supported by observations as star forming galaxies are common
hosts of bright AGN Rosario et al 2013 Mullaney et al 2012 AGN feedback is able to
explain the inecient star formation observed in massive galaxies causing the turn-over
in stellar mass-halo mass relationships eg Croton et al 2006 Tremmel et al 2015 in
prep
MBHs also aect their own gas supply through feedback possibly stunting their growth
at early times Alvarez et al 2009 Milosavljevic et al 2009 Johnson et al 2011 Park
 Ricotti 2012 Aykutalp et al 2014 and eventually reaching a state of self-regulation
at later times The onset and nature of this self-regulation phase is at least in part
governed by SN feedback and nearby gas dynamics Dubois et al 2015 Habouzit et al
2015 in prep Tremmel et al 2015 in prep
AGN can also have positive feedback on their surroundings eg Zinn et al 2013
S 319 Galaxies at High Redshift and Their Evolution over Cosmic Time
Figure 3 AGN feedback does not destroy galaxies They drive large-scale outows that
regulate and eventually stop the ow of cold gas onto their host galaxy
Cresci et al 2015 triggering star formation for instance because of shock pressure-
enhanced star formation Wagner et al 2013 Silk 2013 Bieri et al 2015 Gaibler et al
An important caveat is that the implementation of AGN feedback is still very heuris-
tic Simulations including radiative transfer Bieri et al 2015 in prep and realistic
jets Cielo et al 2015 in prep as well as all the physics of galaxy formation will be
paramount to have an accurate understanding of how feedback aects the MBH itself
and the galaxy
5 BHs and galaxies
The constraints on the relationship between MBH masses and galaxies properties at
z cid39 6 are few and seem to provide conicting results i There seems to be little
correlation between MBH mass and host properties or at least a much larger scatter
Wang et al 2010 Willott et al 2015 ii typically MBHs are over-massive at xed
galaxy massvelocity dispersion compared to their z  0 counterparts eg Walter et
al 2004 at lower redshift see also McLure  Dunlop 2004 Shields et al 2006 Decarli
et al 2010 Merloni 2010 but iii analysis of the MBH massluminosity function and
clustering suggests that either many massive galaxies do not have MBHs or these MBHs
are less massive than expected Willott et al 2010 Weigel et al 2015 As a result
of point ii most authors propose that there is positive evolution in the MBH mass-
galaxy relationships and quantify it as a change in normalization in the sense that at
Marta Volonteri Melanie Habouzit Fabio Pacucci Michael Tremmel
Figure 4 BH mass versus galaxy stellar mass Dark and light blue points are quiescent MBHs
and low-luminosity AGN at z  0 from Reines  Volonteri 2015 Yellow points are MBHs in a
cosmological simulation using the adaptive mesh renement code RAMSES with a maximum
resolution of 80 pc Habouzit et al in prep MBHs in small galaxies are unable to grow because
of the interplay between SN and AGN feedback very eective in small galaxies potential wells
Once a galaxy has become suciently massive to contrast outows its MBH can thrive
xed galaxy properties eg velocity dispersion stellar mass MBHs at high redshift are
more massive than today However this is inconsistent with point iii above Volonteri
 Stark 2011 propose that if the evolution of the correlations is in slope rather than
normalization with a tilt such that MBHs in small galaxies are under-massive and MBHs
in large galaxies are over-massive then one can reconcile the observational results i-ii
and iii above
While observations are still limited cosmological simulations seem indeed to nd that
MBHs in small galaxies are unable to grow and remain stuck at low mass as shown
in Fig 4 while MBHs in the most massive galaxies can grow beyond the correlations
between MBH mass and host properties found at z  0 Sijacki et al 2015 DeGraf et al
2015 Habouzit et al 2015 in prep Indeed low-mass galaxies are a fragile environment
and supernova feedback is sucient to energize the gas and suppress MBH accretion
Dubois et al 2015 MBHs are also easily perturbed from the center of small galaxies
and experience long orbital decay timescales making it more dicult for them to grow
eciently Tremmel et al 2015
6 Conclusions
High redshift MBHs and quasars represent both a theoretical and observational chal-
lenge The current sample is limited to the brightest sources powered by extremely
S 319 Galaxies at High Redshift and Their Evolution over Cosmic Time
massive MBHs One should appreciate that theory and observations have the same lim-
itation either one has a large shallow survey large low-resolution simulation or a
narrow deep survey small high-resolution simulation The number density of these
quasars is so low  one per Gpc3 that comparable volumes must be simulated in order
to catch a glimpse of their evolution Such large volumes are limited in terms of phys-
ical resolution but we are currently reaching a good balance between size and spatial
information Feng et al 2015 Several telescopes in the near future promise to greatly in-
crease the sensitivity thus being able to detect lower luminosity AGN hopefully powered
by lower mass MBHs Pacucci et al 2015 JWST ATHENA and SKA are all geared
towards nding and studying the high redshift Universe and the MBHs and galaxies
that inhabit it Meanwhile ALMA can provide us with unprecedented information on
the dynamics and kinematics of molecular gas in the galaxies hosting quasars and AGN
On the theoretical side large volumes at high-resolution are becoming a reality and we
can now shift the attention from reproducing statistical results to try and understand
the physics of MBH formation feeding and feedback
