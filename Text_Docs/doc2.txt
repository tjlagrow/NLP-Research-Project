Abstract 
Currently there are two major theories for the pathogenesis of sepsis hyperimmune 
and hypoimmune Hyperimmune theory suggests that cytokine storm causes the 
symptoms of sepsis On the contrary hypoimmune theory suggests that 
immunosuppression causes the manifestations of sepsis By using microarray study 
this study implies that hyperactivity of TH17-like innate immunity and failure of 
adaptive immunity are noted in sepsis patients I find out that innate immunity 
related genes are significantly up-regulated including CD14 TLR12458 HSP70 
CEBP proteins AP1JUNB FOSL2 TGF- IL-6 TGF- CSF2 receptor TNFRSF1A 
S100A binding proteins CCR2 formyl peptide receptor2 amyloid proteins pentraxin 
defensins CLEC5A whole complement machinery CPD NCF MMP neutrophil 
elastase caspases IgG and IgA Fc receptorsCD64 CD32 ALOX5 PTGS LTB4R LTA4H 
and ICAM1 Majority of adaptive immunity genes are down-regulated including MHC 
related genes TCR genes granzymesperforin CD40 CD8 CD3 TCR signaling BCR 
signaling T  B cell specific transcription factors NK killer receptors and TH17 
helper specific transcription factorsSTAT3 RORA REL In addition Treg related 
genes are up-regulated including TGF IL-15 STAT5B SMAD24 CD36 and 
thrombospondin Thus both hyperimmune and hypoimmune play important roles in 
the pathophysiology of sepsis   
Introduction 
Despite of the discovery of antibiotics mortality rate of sepsis is still very high Most 
important of all the exact pathophysiology of sepsis is still unclear Currently there 
are two dominant theory to explain the etiology of sepsis hyperimmune theory and 
hypoimmune theory However these two theories are contrary with each other 
Hyperimmune theory was proposed by Dr Lewis Thomas In his classical paper in 
NEJM 1972 he proposed that hyperactivation of proinflammatory cytokines the 
cytokine storm is the actual cause of sepsis symptoms These uncontrolled cytokines 
destruct and cause multiple organ failure His theory is the mainstream theory of 
sepsis etiology Based on this theory therapeutic strategy such as antibody 
neutralizing TNF was tested in septic patients in clinical trials However these 
antibodies did not improve the survival rate of septic patients Further anti-TNF 
increased the mortality rate of septic patients in several clinical trials That makes 
people to doubt the hyperimmune theory Thus another theory-hypoimmune theory 
emerges Based on the observation that immunosuppressive patients are prone to 
get sepsis hypoimmune status was suggested to be the etiology of sepsis However 
the hypoimmune theory cannot successfully explain the proinflmmatory cytokines 
storm noted in sepsis Both hyperimmune theory and hypoimmune theory have 
clinical and experimental evidences However they are contrary with each other 
Here I use the microarray study of whole blood of septic patients to propose a new 
theory Sepsis is a syndrome of hyperactivity of innate immunity and hypoactivity of 
adaptive immunity This new theory solves the above controversy   
Material and Methods 
Microarray dataset 
According to Dr J A Howrylaks research in Physiol Genomics 2009 he collected 
total RNA from whole blood in sepsis and sepsis induced ARDS patients1 He tried 
to find out molecular signature of ARDS compared to sepsis patients His dataset is 
available in Gene Expression Omnibus GEO wwwncbinlmnihgovgeo assession 
number GSE 10474 I use his samples of sepsis patients from this dataset to do the 
further microarray analysis The sample size is 21 patients with 35 mortality rate 
The second dataset is from GSE20189 of Gene Expression Omnibus This dataset was 
collected by Dr Melissa Rotunno in Cancer Prevention Research 20112 Molecular 
signature of early stage of lung adenocarcinoma was studied by microarray I use the 
healthy control sample size 21whole blood RNA from this dataset to compare the 
septic patients In this study I perform further analysis to study peripheral leukocyte 
gene expression profiles of sepsis compared to those of healthy controls   
Statistical analysis 
Affymetrix HG-U133A 20 genechip was used in both samples RMA express 
softwareUC Berkeley Board Institute is used to do normalization and to rule out the 
outliners of the above dataset I rule out the potential outliners of samples due to 
the following criteria   
1 Remove samples which have strong deviation in NUSE plot 
2 Remove samples which have broad spectrum in RLE value plot 
3 Remove samples which have strong deviation in RLE-NUSE mutiplot 
4 Remove samples which exceed 99 line in RLE-NUSE T2 plot 
Then Genespring XI software was done to analysis the significant expressed genes 
between ARDS and healthy control leukocytes P value cut-off point is less than 005 
Fold changecut-off point is 20 fold change Benjamini-hochberg corrected false 
discovery rate was used during the analysis Totally a genelist of 3277 genes was 
generated from the HGU133A20 chip with 18400 transcripts including 14500 
well-characterized human genes 
RT-PCR confirmation 
Dr J A Howrylak performed real time PCR for selected transcripts cip1 kip2 by 
using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays Applied Biosystems Foster City CA    In the 
second dataset Dr Melissa Rotunno also performed qRT-PCR test to validate the 
microarray results RNA quantity and quality was determined by using RNA 600 
LabChip-Aligent 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA purification was done by the reagents from 
Qiagen Inc All real-time PCRs were conducted by using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence 
Detection System with the designed primers and probes for target genes and an 
internal control gene-GAPDH This confirms that their microarray results are 
convincing compared to RT-PCR results 
Results 
RMA analysis of whole blood from healthy normal control 
The RMA analysis was performed for RNA samples from whole blood of healthy 
control of the lung adenocarcinoma dataset Raw boxplot NUSE plot RLE value plot 
RLE-NUSE multiplot and RLE-NUSE T2 plot were generated Then sample was 
included and excluded by using these graphsFigure 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E Because of 
the strong deviation in the T2 plot the sample GSM506435 was removed for the 
further analysis   
RMA analysis of whole blood from septic patients 
The RMA analysis was performed for RNA samples from whole blood of sepsis 
patients dataset Raw boxplot NUSE plot RLE value plot RLE-NUSE multiplot and 
RLE-NUSE T2 plot were generated Then sample was included and excluded by using 
these graphsFigure 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E GSM265024 and GSM265030 are removed 
due to above criteria 
Toll-like signaling and heat shock protein expression in septic patients 
According to the microarray analysis Toll-like receptors 1 2 4 5 8 are up-regulated 
in sepsisTable 1 CD14 molecule and downstream signaling such as IRAK4 and TAB2 
are also up-regulated TLR1 2 4 5 8 are mediating anti-bacterial immune response 
Thus TH17-like proinflamatory cytokines such as IL-6 will be triggered However the 
negative TLR regulator-IRAK3 is 21 fold up-regulated Thus TLR 1 2 4 5 8 signaling 
may not successfully trigger proinflammatory cytokines Other pathway such as CD14 
may act as an important alternative pathway to trigger IL-6 and other TH17-like 
cytokines Other pattern recognition receptors such as formyl peptide receptors 
FPRwhich can recognize specific bacterial antigen to trigger innate immunity are 
also differentially expressed FPR1 is 76 fold down-regulated but FPR2 is 47 fold 
up-regulated   
In table 2 we can see that many heat shock protein genes are up-regulated Fever is 
a usual manifestation of sepsis Thus it is not surprising that heat shock proteins are 
expressed during sepsis Among them heat shock protein 70 HSPA1A1B is 7 fold 
up-regulated HSP70 can bind to TLR4 to trigger anti-bacterial TH17-like innate 
immunity It is worth noting that HSP90AA1 is 13 fold down-regulated HSP90 can 
bind to steroid receptor and prevent its action If HSP90 is down-regulated the 
action of steroid cannot be stopped Thus steroid related immune regulatory effect 
may be initiated during sepsis 
Antigen processing and antigen presentation genes in sepsis 
In table 3 and table 4 we can see many cathepsin and proteasome genes are 
up-regulated Up-regulated cathepsin genes include CTSA CTSD CTSC CTSG and 
CTSZ But CTSO and CTSW are down-regulated Cathepsin W CTSW is related to 
CD8 T cell activation3 Up-regulated proteasome genes include PSMD13 PSMC6 
PSMD12 PSMD5 PSMB6 and PSMD10 Down-regulated proteasome genes include 
PSMF1 PSMC2 and PSME4 Among them PSMF1 is a proteasome inhibitor Both 
cathepsins and proteasomes are important in the antigen processing pathways We 
can see antigen processing after bacterial infection is intact   
In table 5 however we can see all MHC related genes are down-regulated in 
leukocytes of septic patients These down-regulated genes include HLA-DPB 
HLA-DQA HLA-DRB HLA-DOB HLA-DRA HLA-DQB Tapasin MHC I related transcripts 
HLA-B and HLA-DPA Among them HLA-B is more than 11 fold down-regulated MHC 
genes are keys to the antigen presentation to trigger adaptive immune reaction such 
as B cell or T cell activation Since all the MHC related genes are down-regulated 
antigen presentation during sepsis is likely to be impaired This matches previous 
observations4   
TH17-like innate immune transcription factors in sepsis 
In table 6 many immune related transcription factors are differentially regulated 
during sepsis First of all many innate immunity related transcription factors are 
up-regulated in septic patients These include AP1JunB and FosL2 NFIL3 ARNT and 
CEBPCEBPA CEBPG and CEBPD genes Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear 
translocatorARNT plays an important role in the activation of TH17-like innate 
immunity CEBP family genes are related to the activity of myeloid cells and 
granulocytes CEBP genes are also related to the activation of acute response 
proteins In addition the inhibitor of NFkB NFKBIA is down-regulated in sepsis It 
means that the activity of NFkB an key innate immunity mediator is up-regulated in 
septic patients It is worth noting that two important transcription factors High 
Mobility Group BoxHMGB and Hypoxia inducible factor alphaHIF are also 
up-regulated during sepsis HMGB a vital innate immunity mediator is greater than 
nine fold up-regulation 
STAT1 a key transcription factor for TH1 and TH immunity is down-regulated in 
sepsis In addition TBX21T-bet a key TH1 immune response driver is also 
down-regulated Table 25 In addition MafB which can suppress IFN in TH 
immunity is up-regulated5 Other TH2 related key transcription factors such as 
GATA3 and C-MAF are also down-regulated6 It means that TH1 TH2 and TH are 
down-regulated in sepsis Surprisingly key TH17 related transcription factors are also 
down-regulated including REL STAT3 and RORA7 Besides SOCS3 a negative 
regulator of the central TH17 transcription factor STAT3 is up-regulated It means 
that TH17 helper cells cannot be successfully triggered On the other hand Treg and 
TGF signaling are up-regulated including STAT5B IL-15 SMAD2 and SMAD48 9 
TH17 and Treg associated aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocatorARNT is 
also up-regulated in sepsis10 Thus Treg cells are likely to be activated in sepsis 
This matches the previous observations that Treg cells are up-regulated during sepsis   
TH17-like and Treg related cytokines are up-regulated during sepsis 
In table 7 many TH17-like and Treg related cytokines are up-regulated in septic 
patients The whole TGF activation machinery is up-regulated including 
thrombospondin CD36 and TGF itself TGFA and IL-15 are also up-regulated 
Besides IL-6 is also up-regulated in sepsis Thus both key TH17 driven cytokines 
TGF and IL-6 are activated in septic patients However full activation of TH17 
helper cells also need a TCR signaling IL-32 a TH1 related macrophage 
differentiation factor is down-regulated11 TH22 mediators IL1A is down-regulated 
and IL1RN IL1 receptor antagonist is up-regulated It means that TH22 is not 
activated in sepsis   
In table 8 cytokine receptors are differentially regulated in sepsis On the contrary 
with cytokine cytokine in a certain immunological pathway is usually 
down-regulated Thus since TH17-like immunity is activated TGFBR3 IL6R and 
IL17RA are all down-regulated TGF receptor 3 is greater than 11 fold 
down-regulated and interleukin 6 receptor is greater than 16 fold down-regulated 
Treg is also triggered in sepsis so TGFBR3 IL2RB and IL7R are also down-regulated 
TH1 related cytokine receptors IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 are up-regulated TH2 cytokine 
receptor IL4R is also up-regulated As for TH immunity IFNAR1 is up-regulated 
but IFNAR2 is down-regulated TH22 cytokine receptors IL1R1 and IL1R2 are 
up-regulated Thus TH1 TH2 TH and TH22 are not activated during sepsis   
In table 9 important CSF receptors are up-regulated These include CSF2 GM-CSF 
receptor  and  GM-CSF can promote the proliferation of monocyte and 
granulocyte lineages In table 10 many TNF related genes are differentially regulated 
Up-regulated TNF related genes include TNFAIP6 TNFAIP8 TNFRSF1A and TNFSF10 
Down-regulated TNF related genes include TNFRSF10C TNFRSF9 and TNFSF14 
TNFRSF1A is the major receptor of TNF Thus both IL-1 receptor and TNF receptor 
are up-regulated during sepsis TNFSF10TRAIL is a pro-apoptotic factor and 
TNFRSF10C is a receptor to prevent TRAIL induced apoptosis Thus TRAIL induced 
apoptosis pathway is activated in sepsis TNFRSF94-1BB and TNFSF14CD258 are 
both important lymphocyte co-stimulatory molecules Thus lymphocyte 
costimulation is likely to be impaired at sepsis     
TH17 related chemokine up-regulation during sepsis 
In table 11 we find out that TH17 related chemokine are up-regulated in septic 
patients These chemokines include S100 binding proteins S100A11 S100A8 
S100A9 and S100P CCR2neutrophil chemokine receptor hyaluronan-mediated 
motility receptor HMMR and chemokine-like factorCKLF TH related chemokine 
factors such as CX3CR1 XCL1 and XCL2 for NK cell recruitment are down-regulated 
TH1 related chemokine factors such as CCL4 and CCR1 for macrophagemonocyte 
recruitment are also down-regulated Besides TH2 chemokine receptor CCR3 for 
eosinophil recruitment is also down-regulated It is worth noting that CCR7 the 
chemokine receptor for central memory T cells is greater than 5 fold down-regulated 
in sepsis Thus the generation of central memory T cell is likely to be impaired during 
sepsis   
In table 12 many prostaglandin and leukotriene genes are differentially regulated 
Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are important chemotaxis mediators The key 
enzyme leukotriene A4 hydrolase for synthesizing leukotriene B4 a potent PMN 
chemoattractant is up-regulated Besides leukotriene B4 receptor is also 
up-regulated Besides the receptor of PGD2 a TH2 related effector molecule is 10 
fold down-regulated Prostangin D synthetase is also down-regulated In addition the 
gene 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase HPGD which is responsible for 
shutting down prostaglandin is 16 fold up-regulated Key molecules including 
phospholipase A 2 and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase to initiate leukotriene synthesis 
are also up-regulated in sepsis 
Th17-like innate immunity related effector molecule up-regulation in sepsis 
In table 13 many acute response proteins are up-regulated These acute phase 
proteins are up-regulated by IL-6 and CEBP proteins These genes include amyloid 
proteins APP and APLP2 pentraxinPTX3 transferrin receptorTFRC CLEC CLEC5A 
and CLEC1B and defensins DEFA1 DEFA1B DEFA3 and DEFA4 These above 
proteins are innate immunity effector proteins to attack bacterial antigens 
non-specifically Defensin A4 is greater than 6 fold up-regulated 
In table 14 the whole set complement machinery an important effector component 
of innate immunity is up-regulated These include CD59 CD55 C1QB ITGAM CR1 
CD46 C3AR1 ITGAX C1QA C1RL C5AR1 and CD97 Thus complement molecules 
are activated during sepsis These complement molecules attack bacterial cell walls 
and membranes to cause their damage However complements may also cause 
harmful effect to the host 
In table 15 certain genes related to PMN phagocytosis and bacteria killing are 
up-regulated Neutrophil cytosolic factor 14 the subunit of NADPH oxidase for 
ingested bacteria killing are up-regulated in sepsis Carboxypeptidase D CPD which 
can up-regulate nitric oxide is also up-regulated during sepsis12 Nitric oxide is also 
a key effector molecule for ingested bacteria killing CPD is greater than 69 fold 
up-regulated   
In table 16 PMN matrix metallopeptidasesMMP and elastase are up-regulated 
These protein enzymes can digest bacterial antigens as well as extracellular matrix 
These genes include MMP8 MMP9 MMP25 and ELANEelastase In addition tissue 
inhibitor of MMP TIMP2 and serum inhibitors of elastase or proteinase SERPINA1 
SERPINB1 and SERPINB2 are also up-regulated It means that PMN proteinases are 
dysregulated It is worth noting that MMP8 is 32 fold up-regulated and MMP9 is 10 
fold up-regulated   
In table 17 apoptosis machinery is up-regulated during sepsis Up-regulated genes 
include casapase3 FAS caspase5 program cell death 10PDCD10 caspase 1 
caspase4 and TRAIL Down-regulated genes include CFLAR and FAIM3 both of which 
are apoptosis negative regulators Thus apoptosis is activated at sepsis It matches 
previous observations that there is massive leukocyte-lymphocyte apoptosis during 
sepsis   
In table 18 many Fc receptor genes which mediate macrophage and neutrophil 
phagocytosis are up-regulated These genes include IgG Fc receptor IIaFCGR2A IgE 
Fc receptor IgFCER1G IgA Fc receptorFCAR IgG Fc receptor IIcFCGR2C IgG Fc 
receptor Ib and IgG Fc receptor IaIcFCGR1A1C Besides TH2 immunity related IgE 
Fc receptor Ia is 38 fold down-regulated In addition TH immunity related CD16 
IgG Fc receptor expression is unchanged TH17-related innate immunity is mediated 
by IgGIgG2IgG3 and IgA Thus TH17-like innate immunity with enhanced 
phagocytosis is noted during sepsis 
In table 19 many CD molecules are up-regulated or down-regulated during sepsis 
These CD molecules are important immune response mediators Among them 
up-regulation of CD36 the thrombospodin receptor means that TGF molecule is 
also up-regulated Down-regulated CD2 molecule means that T cell activation 
pathway is impaired In addition down-regulation of CD40 means that activation of 
antigen presenting cells such as B cells is impaired Besides CD24 is usually 
down-regulated in memory B cells However during sepsis CD24 is strongly 
up-regulated   
Coagulation  glycolysis acidosis and vasodilation gene dysregulation in sepsis 
In table20 many coagulation related genes are dysregulated during sepsis Actually 
disseminated intracellular coagulopathy is a common manifestation of sepsis 
Up-regulated coagulation genes include F13A1 F5 F8 GP1BB PROS1 PLAUR 
MCFD2 TFPI F2RL1 ITGA2B PDGFC ITGB3 and THBD Both coagulation factors and 
inhibitors are dysregulated in sepsis   
The whole glycolytic pathway enzymes are up-regulated during sepsisTable21 
These include lactate dehydrogenase A phosphoglycerate kinase 1 pyruvate kinase 
6-phosphofructo-2-kinasefructose-26-biphosphatase 3 hexokinase 2 glycogen 
phosphorylase 23-bisphosphoglycerate mutase hexokinase 3 glucose-6-phosphate 
isomerase 6-phosphofructo-2-kinasefructose-26-biphosphatase 2 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase enolase 1 and phosphoglycerate 
kinase 1 In addition the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase which can stop 
pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA is up-regulated The enzyme pyruvate dehyrogenase 
phosphatase which can facilitate pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA to enter aerobic citric 
acid cycle is down-regulated in sepsis Thus pyruvate can keep on forming lactate in 
anaerobic pathway during sepsis   
Concurrently H-ATPases are also up-regulated during sepsisTable22 In my 
previous articlepaper in press I find out the coupling between glycolytic enzymes 
and H-ATPases during falciparum malarial infection Here I also find out 
up-regulated H-ATPases including ATP6V0B ATP6V0E1 ATP6AP2 ATP6V1C1 
TCIRG1 ATP6V1D ATP11B and ATP11A Besides carbonic anhydrase IV  II which 
can produce H2CO3 are up-regulated in sepsis Thus this can help to explain the 
acidosis during sepsis   
Hypotension is a complication of sepsis Septic shock is related to global vasodilation 
In table 23 several key vasodilation genes are up-regulated These genes including 
angiotensinase c PRCP adrenomedullinADM and monoamine oxidase AMAO-A 
Angiotensin is a very strong vasopressor and angiotensinase can metabolize 
angiotensin to inhibit its function Adrenomedullin is a potent vasodilator MAO-A 
can metabolize three key endogenous vasoconstrictors dopamine epinephrine and 
norepinephrine Thus elevated MAO-A can prevent the effect of hypertensive 
agents Thus the findings can help to explain the etiology of septic shock   
Failure of NK B T lymphocyte adaptive immunity during sepsis 
Lymphocytes play important roles in adaptive immunity In sepsis the three major 
lymphocyte populations NK cells T cells and B cells are all down-regulated Thus 
lymphocyte adaptive immunity fails to induce during sepsis This is very important is 
sepsis pathogenesis   
In table 24 majority of NK cell related genes are down-regulated including NK cell 
killer receptors NKTR KLRK1 LAIR2 KLRD1 KLRG1 KLRB1 and KLRF1 granzymes 
GZMA GZMK GZMB and GZMH and perforin PRF1 Thus NK lymphocytes are 
inactivated or even suppressed during sepsis NK cells are very important in TH 
immunity and it also implies that TH immunity is inhibited during sepsis   
In table 25 many T cell related genes are also down-regulated These 
down-regulated genes include TCR genesTRAC TARP TRBC1C2 TRD TRGC2 and 
TRDV3 CD costimulatory moleculesCD3E CD8A CD3G LY9 CD3DCD2 T cell 
specific transcription factorsIKZF1 TCF7 NFAT5 NFATC3 TCF7L2 NFATC2IP TBX21 
ID2 and ID2B granzymeperforin GZMA GNLY GZMK GZMB GZMH and PRF1 
and TCR downstream signalingZAP70 and LCK13 Thus the whole-set of T cell 
activation machinery is suppressed Both CD4 helper T cells and CD8 cytotoxic T cells 
are inactivated and down-regulated in septic patients   
In table 25 B cell genes are differentially regulated Up-regulated B cell related 
genes include immunoglobulin light chainIGK IGJ and IGKV1-5 immunoglobulin 
heavy chainIGHG1G2 and IGHA1A2 and B cell suppressive transcription 
factorsBCL6 and IBTK14 Down-regulated genes include B cell stimulatory 
transcription factor PAX5 and IKZF1 immunoglobulin heavy chainIGHM BCR 
signalingFYN and LYN and PI3K signalingPIK3CB PIK3IP1 PIK3CG and 
PIK3R115-17 The negative regulator of PI3K signaling PTEN is 46 fold 
up-regulated BCL6 and IBTK can inhibit B cell differentiation and activation PI3K 
signaling is the downstream stimulatory pathway of B cell activation Thus BCR 
signaling appears to be suppressed during sepsis Although Ig light chain and 
IgAIgG2 are up-regulated this may be due to the isotype switch effect of 
up-regulated immunosuppressant TGF- The key immunoglobulin IgM for bacteria 
defense is down-regulated It implies that B cell adaptive immunity is also impaired 
at sepsis   
Discussion 
Despite of current antibiotics treatment sepsis still causes a very high mortality The 
pathophysiology of sepsis is still unclear18 19 The most dominant theory for sepsis 
mechanism is hyperimmune20 Hyperimmunity with cytokine storm was observed 
in sepsis by Dr Lewis Thomas21 He suggested the symptom and sign in sepsis is 
due to the overactivity of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a NEJM paper His theory is 
widely accepted Based on his hyperimmune theory many therapeutic strategies 
were developed Most famous approach is the anti-TNF agent in sepsis clinical trials 
Because the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF is up-regulated in sepsis use of 
anti-TNF agent should help to control sepsis However the result is opposite Usage 
of anti-TNF agent increase the sepsis mortality rate22-24 Thus the 
sepsis-hyperimmune theory is doubtful   
The other sepsis pathophysiology theory emerged This is the hypoimmune theory 
Because immunocompromised patients are prone to develop sepsis hypoimmune 
should be related to the cause of sepsis25 In addition massive effector lymphocyte 
apoptosis depletion of dendritic cells and elevated Treg cells are noted during 
sepsis26-30 In previous reports down-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and 
MHC are noted in septic patients31 In addition B cells play important roles in 
recovery from sepsis status32 This hypothesis is not accepted by most scientists 
because it cannot explain the observed cytokine storm during sepsis Thus both 
theories have some evidence support and both are only partially correct   
Thus the third theory proposed This is the sequence theory There is hyperimmune 
first during sepsis and then hypoimmune follows This theory tried to incoperate 
both theories However it is not clear why there will be such sequential immune 
response There is no existing immunological mechanism to explain this sequential 
effect Why does the hyperimmune happen first Why does the hyperimmune 
become to be hypoimmune In addition immunodeficiency patients are easily get 
sepsis Then why do these immunodeficiency patients easily develop hyperimmune 
status first Current sepsis theory cannot well explain this   
In this study I use microarray analysis to demonstrate that sepsis is actually a 
hyperactivity of innate immunity and hypoactivity of adaptive immunity Thus it can 
well explain the co-existence of hyperimmune and hypoimmune The hypoimmune 
adaptive immunity explains why immunocompromised patients tend to suffer from 
sepsis easily The hyperimmune innate immunity explains why pro-inflammatory 
cytokine storm is observed at sepsis The adaptive immune dysfunction with lack of T 
helper cells is the key to sepsis pathogenesis Thus block TH17 related cytokines 
such as TNF can further stop the successful generation of TH17 helper cells to 
initiate adaptive immunity to combat extracellular bacteria Thus it can explain why 
TNF blockade increase the mortality rate of sepsis patients   
In the microarray study I find out evidences to support my theory The whole blood 
from septic patients can reflect the leukocyte expression patterns I find out that 
innate immunity related genes are significantly up-regulated These genes include 
CD14 TLR12458 HSP70 CEBP proteins AP1JUNB FOSL2 TGF- IL-6 TGF- 
CSF2 receptor TNFRSF1A S100A binding proteins CCR2 formyl peptide receptor2 
amyloid proteins pentraxin defensins CLEC5A whole complement machinery CPD 
NCF MMP neutrophil elastase caspases IgG and IgA Fc receptorsCD64 CD32 
ALOX5 PTGS LTB4R LTA4H and ICAM1 I also find out that majority of adaptive 
immunity genes are down-regulated including MHC related genes TCR genes 
granzymesperforin CD40 CD8 CD3 TCR signaling BCR signaling T  B cell specific 
transcription factors NK killer receptors and TH17 helper specific transcription 
factorsSTAT3 RORA REL In addition Treg related genes are up-regulated including 
TGF IL-15 STAT5B SMAD24 CD36 and thrombospondin Up-regulated regulatory 
cells during sepsis are also shown in other previous studies Up-regulated Treg 
related genes can also suppress the adaptive immunity in sepsis These all support 
my sepsis pathogenesis   
Sepsis is also related to several complications such as disseminated intravascular 
coagulationDIC hypotensionshock and lactate acidosis33 In this microarray 
analysis I find out that many coagulation related genes are up-regulated during 
sepsis including factor5 factor8 facto13 protein S plasminogen receptor ITGA2B 
ITGB3 and thrombomodulin Thus it can help to explain the mechanism of DIC 
during sepsis Several hypotensive agents are also up-regulated in sepsis including 
angiotesinase C adrenomodullin and MAO-A This can help to explain septic shock 
pathophysiology The whole set of glycolytic enzymes are up-regulated during sepsis 
including LDHA PGK1 PKM2 PFKFB3 HK2 PYGL BPGM HK3 PDK3 GPI PFKFB2 
GAPDH and ENO1 In addition glycolytic enzyme coupled H-ATPase genes are also 
up-regulated These can explain the lactate acidosis noted during sepsis   
Bacteria have strategies to suppress host immunity for their survival especially the 
adaptive immunity34 In conclusion after knowing the pathogenesis of sepsis we 
can develop better preventive and therapeutic agents to control sepsis The 
impairment of adaptive immunity could be more important than the overactivation 
of innate immunity during sepsis Thus we may use medications to activate host 
adaptive immunity such as T helper cells to combat sepsis In addition we can also 
develop therapeutic strategies to cope with sepsis related complications such as DIC 
hypotension and lactate acidosis Hopefully the detrimental illness-sepsis will be 
overcome one day
