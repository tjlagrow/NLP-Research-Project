ABSTRACT
We investigate the evolution of the galaxy merger rate predicted by two semi-analytical
galaxy formation models implemented on the Millennium Simulation of dark matter structure
growth. The fraction of merging galaxy pairs at each time-step of the simulation is derived
from the galaxy catalogues obtained by the models and the results are compared with various
observational estimates of merger fractions taken from the literature. We ﬁnd a good match
between the pair fractions derived from the simulation and the observed counting of galaxy
pairs obtained by different sources in the redshift range 0 < z < 1.2. The predicted evolution
of the number of galaxy mergers per Gyr grows with redshift as an exponential rate given
by Γmrg
∝ (1 + z)m, with m ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 for 0 < z < 2, depending on the
luminosity and mass ratios of the merging galaxies. Our results are in agreement with recent
observational results that argue for a ﬂat evolution in the fraction of galaxy mergers since
z ∼ 1.2. The weak evolution predicted for the galaxy merger rate in an hierarchical model
universe shows that the mass assembly evolution of galaxies through mergers does not follow
the rapid evolution of the halo merger rate obtained in previous studies.

1 INTRODUCTION
The role played by galaxy mergers is of paramount importance
for galaxy formation and evolution. Since the seminal numerical
work by Toomre & Toomre (1972), galaxy mergers are thought
to be relevant mechanisms in the build up of the spheroidal
component of galaxies. Recent numerical works also argue that
gas-rich mergers are able to form disk galaxies (Robertson et al.
2004; Governato et al. 2007). In the local Universe, observa-
tions of remnants of galaxy mergers strengthen their effects on
galaxy morphologies and on triggering star formation in merg-
ing galaxies, unveiling their power on driving galaxy evolution
(e.g. Jog & Maybhate 2006; Schweizer & Seitzer 2007). Actually,
in a recent work Mateus, Jimenez, & Gazta˜naga (2008) show that
galaxy mergers are very correlated to the star formation history of
galaxies, driving the environmental dependence in galaxy forma-
tion by regulating the star formation process.
The importance of galaxy mergers is highlighted when we
consider the hierarchical build up of cold dark matter (CDM) struc-
tures according to the standard ΛCDM cosmology, which forms the
basis of the subsequent processes related to galaxy formation and
evolution. In this picture, the structure growth is driven by the hier-
archical accretion and merging of dark matter haloes, with galaxies
forming inside these structures following the radiative cooling of
baryons and the condensation of the gas through dissipative cool-
ing (White & Rees 1978). It follows that the rate at which galaxy
⋆ E-mail: abilio.mateus@oamp.fr
mergers evolve is a direct consequence of the hierarchical growth of
structures in any galaxy formation model based on this framework.
Predicting this evolution from the models and comparing it to ob-
servations of galaxy mergers at different lookback times represent,
therefore, a key test to determine whether and how galaxies form
by mergers or whether the models give us the correct predictions.
On the observational side, the galaxy merger counting is a
challenging effort. Two main approaches are used to measure the
evolution of galaxy mergers at low and high-redshift. The ﬁrst one
is based on the counting of close galaxy pairs, which provides re-
liable estimates of major mergers out to z ∼ 1 (e.g. Patton et al.
1997; Le F`evre et al. 2000; Bundy et al. 2004; Lin et al. 2004;
Kartaltepe et al. 2007), despite of the selection effects and biases
inherent to this method (e.g. Patton et al. 2000). Other way to
counting galaxy mergers is through detecting direct signatures of
galaxy interactions, as visual disturbed morphologies or asymme-
tries detected by automated procedures (e.g. Conselice et al. 2003;
De Propris et al. 2007; Lotz et al. 2008).
In this Letter, we examine the galaxy merger rate evolution
predicted by galaxy formation models and its comparison with
observational measurements of merger rates taken from the liter-
ature. We use the public data available by the Millennium Sim-
ulation (Springel et al. 2005) to derive galaxy merger properties
predicted by two semi-analytical galaxy formation models imple-
mented on the simulation and described by Bower et al. (2006) and
De Lucia & Blaizot (2007).
We present a brief description of the Millennium Simulation
and the semi-analytical models used in this work in Section 2. In
A. Mateus
Section 3 we describe the methodology used to estimate galaxy
mergers from the simulation outputs. The main results of this work
are presented in Section 4 and our conclusions are summarized on
Section 5.
2 THE MODEL UNIVERSES
In this section we brieﬂy describe the model universes used in this
work based on one of the largest cosmological simulation of struc-
ture growth carried out so far, the Millennium Simulation, and on
two state-of-the-art semi-analytical models of galaxy formation de-
veloped by independent groups.
The Millennium Simulation of dark matter structure growth,
recently carried out by the Virgo Consortium, follows the evolu-
tion of N = 21603 particles of mass 8.6 × 108h−1 M⊙, within
a co-moving box of size 500h−1 Mpc on a side, from redshift
z = 127 to the present (Springel et al. 2005). The adopted cos-
mological model is the concordance ΛCDM model with parame-
ters Ωm = 0.25, Ωb = 0.045, h = 0.73, ΩΛ = 0.75, n = 1
and σ8 = 0.9, where the Hubble constant is parametrized as
H0 = 100h km s−1 Mpc−1. Haloes and subhaloes in 64 output
snapshots were identiﬁed using the SUBFIND algorithm described
in Springel et al. (2001), and merger trees were then constructed
that describe how haloes grow as the model universe evolves. These
merger trees form the basic input needed by the semi-analytic mod-
els described in the following.
We explore the galaxy catalogues obtained by two semi-
analytical galaxy formation models implemented on the Millen-
nium Simulation. We use the results obtained by the model pre-
sented and discussed by De Lucia & Blaizot (2007), which is a
modiﬁed version of the models used in Croton et al. (2006) and
De Lucia et al. (2006). The galaxy catalogues generated by this
model have been made public on the Millennium download site
at the German Virtual Observatory1. We also use the model de-
scribed in detail by Bower et al. (2006). It is an extension of
the GALFORM model implemented by Cole et al. (2000) and
Benson et al. (2003). The catalogues generated by this model are
publicly available on the Millennium download site at the Univer-
sity of Durham.2
These semi-analytical galaxy formation models have signif-
icant differences in the general procedure to form galaxies from
the dark matter haloes. First of all, many aspects of the baryonic
physics involved in the galaxy formation process are treated in a
completely different manner, mainly those related to the energy
feedback from active galaxy nuclei to regulate the star formation
in galaxies. In addition, the construction of the merger trees from
the dark matter halo distribution, which form the basis of the semi-
analytical approach integrated on the numerical simulations, has
been done in independent ways.
3 GALAXY MERGER RATES
We derive the predicted evolution of the galaxy merger rate from
the semi-analytical galaxy formation models implemented on the
Millennium Simulation. We start selecting all z = 0 galaxies
with rest-frame absolute magnitudes MB 6 −18, resulting in
two base catalogues containing about 3.33 × 106 galaxies from
1 http://www.g-vo.org/Millennium
2 http://galaxy-catalogue.dur.ac.uk:8080/Millennium
the Bower et al. (2006) model and about 4.35 × 106 galaxies from
the De Lucia & Blaizot (2007) model. For all galaxies in these cata-
logues, we recovered their complete merger trees by using the post-
processing facilities carried out on the Millennium databases.
The ﬁrst step to derive the model predictions for the frac-
tion of galaxies undergoing mergers is to identify the progenitors
of each galaxy selected from the merger trees at each time-step t
of the simulation. We then deﬁne that a galaxy has experienced a
merger if it has at least one pair of progenitors at the previous time-
step. In other words, we are able to select galaxy pairs at a given
t that will merge to form a single galaxy in the immediately pos-
terior time-step. This description is particularly interesting if one
wants to compare the results from the simulation with observational
estimates of merger fractions based on pair count statistics (e.g.
Patton et al. 2002; Lin et al. 2004; Kartaltepe et al. 2007). In our
analysis, the progenitor pair of a merge-product galaxy is composed
by its main progenitor (deﬁned as the progenitor with the largest
stellar mass), selected to be brighter than a B-band absolute mag-
B , and an ordinary progenitor with MB 6 −18.
nitude limit, M lim
In our analysis, we considered two magnitude limits for the main
progenitors, M lim
B = −20, in order to in-
spect how this choice affects the derived pair fractions. We have
also adopted an additional approach to select galaxy pairs by con-
sidering only the ordinary progenitors with stellar masses larger
than 1/4, 1/6, and 1/10 of the main progenitor stellar mass, in-
dependently of their luminosity. In such analysis, we selected only
the main progenitors with MB < −20. This procedure allows us
to investigate how the estimated pair fractions depend on the mass
ratio of the pair components.
B = −19.5 and M lim
We deﬁne the pair fraction as the number of galaxies in the
progenitor pairs (main progenitors plus companions), Np(z), di-
vided by the total number of main progenitors brighter than M lim
Nt(z), at each time-step of the simulation: fp(z) = Np(z)/Nt(z).
The merge fraction is directly derived from the pair fraction by con-
sidering only the total number of progenitors pairs that will merge,
that is, fmrg(z) ≃ 0.5fp(z). We can directly relate this predicted
merger fraction to observations of close galaxy pairs which are fre-
quently used to derive observed merger fractions. From observa-
tions of physically close galaxy pairs one can determine the number
of close companions per galaxy, Nc , which is identical to the pair
fraction in a volume-limited sample with no triples or higher order
N-tuples. Following the expression adopted by Lin et al. (2004), the
galaxy merger rate per Gyr estimated through pair count statistics
is given by
Rmrg = (0.5 + G)Nc(z)PmrgT −1
where Nc(z) is the average number of companions for galaxies
within the observed magnitude range, Pmrg denotes the probabil-
ity that galaxies in close pairs will merge (typically assumed to
be 0.5), and Tmrg is the time-scale for physically associated pairs
to merge. The factor 0.5 is to convert the number of galaxies into
the number of merger events (assuming only pairs, ignoring triples
and higher order N-tuples). The physical galaxy pairs are expected
to merge on the time-scale Tmrg which depends on the intrinsic
characteristics of the pairs, such as the relative mass ratio, orbit pa-
rameters, and on the structure of the merging galaxies, thus varying
for each pair (e.g. Conselice 2006). In general, one assumes that
Tmrg ∼ 0.5 Gyr, a value suggested by simpliﬁed models based
on the dynamical friction time-scale and also predicted by N-body
simulations (e.g. Mihos 1995; Patton et al. 2000; Conselice 2006).
In equation (1) we also include an additional parameter, G, in-
troduced by Lin et al. (2004) to account for differences in sample
selections when comparing merger rates estimated by pair counts
and by morphological approaches. Here we will adopt the value of
G = 1.24 determined by Lin et al. (2004).
In the case of the simulation, a merger between one or more
ordinary progenitors and the main progenitor results in the for-
mation of a single galaxy at a posterior time-step. Thus, we can
evaluate a galaxy merger rate (number of galaxy mergers per Gyr),
Γmrg(z), by dividing the merger fraction at each z by the time in-
terval between the two time-steps associated to the progenitors and
to the new formed galaxy: Γmrg(z) = fmrg(z)δt−1. In the red-
shift range 0 < z < 1, the mean value of δt is 0.34 Gyr, implying
that the progenitor pairs of a given galaxy can be considered as
physical pairs. Thus, the predicted galaxy merger rate can be easily
compared with that derived from observational data, Rmrg, based
on pair count statistics.
4 RESULTS
In Fig. 1, we show the predicted evolution of pair fractions derived
from galaxy formation models, fp(z), and a compilation of obser-
vational results in the redshift range 0 < z < 1.2. For the simu-
lation, we show results of pair fractions obtained assuming mag-
nitude limits to select the main progenitors of M lim
B = −19.5
B = −20 (top lines). The observational
(bottom lines) and M lim
data points shown in this ﬁgure were obtained from estimates us-
ing galaxy pair counts by Patton et al. (2002), Lin et al. (2004),
Bell et al. (2006), and De Propris et al. (2007). For z < 0.3, we
show the close pair fractions obtained by Patton et al. from counting
close dynamical pairs of the CNOC2 survey, with luminosities in
the range −22 . MB . −19, and the result obtained by De Pro-
pris et al. for a galaxy sample with −21 < MB − 5 log h < −18
and 0.010 < z < 0.123 drawn from the Millennium Galaxy Cat-
alogue. At higher redshifts, we show the mean value of the close
pair fraction obtained by Bell et al. after analysing 0.4 < z < 0.8
galaxies with MB < −20 from the COMBO-17 survey and the
pair fractions obtained by Lin et al. from analysis of galaxies with
luminosities −22 . MB . −20 and redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.2
from the DEEP2 redshift survey. It is worth noting that we have ad-
justed the values of Lin et al. downward by 65 per cent to account
for projection within galaxy groups, as suggested by Bell et al.
(2006).
There is a good match between the evolution of the pair frac-
tions predicted by the Bower et al. (2006) model and that inferred
by the observational data, considering the magnitude limits adopted
to select the main progenitors. The model by De Lucia & Blaizot
(2007) underpredicts the pair fractions at z > 0.5, showing a de-
creasing evolution which is clearly inconsistent with the behaviour
expected from the observations. The evolution of the pair fractions
derived from the Bower et al. model is strong at z . 0.3, and be-
comes weak at higher redshifts, independent of the value of M lim
adopted to select galaxy pairs. The amplitude of the pair fractions is
highly dependent on the value of M lim
B , being higher for pairs con-
taining brighter galaxies. This trend is associated with the strong
dependence of the galaxy growth through mergers on stellar mass
(Maller et al. 2006; Guo & White 2008). We have also compared
our results with the recent measurements of close pair fractions ob-
tained by Kartaltepe et al. (2007), who claims for a strong evolution
of the pair fractions since z ∼ 1.2 after analysing the galaxy popu-
lation in the COSMOS ﬁeld. They adopted photometric redshifts to
select galaxy pairs in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.2, with a mag-
nitude limit MV < −19.8. We found a good agreement in the pair

pair fractions derived by Kartaltepe et al. (2007), inconsistent with
the weak evolution of fp(z) predicted by the Bower et al. model.
This discrepancy can be due to the large errors in the photometric
redshifts used to select the pairs and the consequent projection ef-
fects, which become more important at higher redshifts. We hope
that a future spectroscopic follow-up of their data and other pair
fraction estimates from high-z surveys will help to clarify this is-
In Fig. 2, we show the evolution of the merger rates predicted
by the models, Γmrg(z), and the merger rates derived from the
observations. Galaxy merger rates are estimated from the obser-
vational data considering the time-scale Tmrg = 0.5 Gyr for the
measurements from pair counts, assuming by simplicity that this
value is characteristic of the merging time-scale for close pairs (e.g.
Patton et al. 2000), as discussed in Section 3. For this compari-
son, we also added the merger rates estimated from merger anal-
ysis based on galaxies showing morphological distortions. This ap-
proach is signiﬁcantly distinct to the pair counts analysis, since the
mergers are observed after their occurrence (see De Propris et al.
2007 for a discussion between these two methods). We show the
results obtained by Conselice et al. (2003) from a morphological
analysis of galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. They have detected
ongoing major mergers by measuring an asymmetry parameter
from galaxy images. We also show the recent measurements of
morphologically identiﬁed galaxy mergers obtained by Lotz et al.
(2008) from the analysis of galaxies brighter than MB = −20.5
in the HST survey of the Extended Groth Strip. Here we adopted a
time-scale of 1 Gyr to derive the merger rates from these morpho-
logical studies.
As in Fig. 1, there is a good agreement between the observa-

tional data points and the Bower et al. model predictions, consider-
ing the error bars of the measurements and all the uncertainties in-
volved in deriving the observed merger rates (e.g. time-scales). The
evolution of merger fractions derived from observational data sets
is usually ﬁtted with a function f ∝ (1+z)m, where the value of m
varies from about 0 to 4 (e.g. Le F`evre et al. 2000; Carlberg et al.
2000; Conselice et al. 2003; Lin et al. 2004; Lotz et al. 2008). In
our analysis, the ﬁtting of the Bower et al. model predictions with
the same function, considering only the points in the redshift range
0 < z < 2, gives:
Γmrg(z) = 0.029(1 + z)0.767
Γmrg(z) = 0.046(1 + z)0.596

B = −19.5,
B = −20.0.
The m ∼ 0.6 − 0.8 value obtained for this model is consis-
tent with recent results obtained by different approaches, which
gives support for roughly a ﬂat evolution of the merger rate
(Bundy et al. 2004; Lin et al. 2004; Lotz et al. 2008). The model
by De Lucia & Blaizot (2007) predicts a constant merger rate evo-
lution, visibly at odds with the observations and the Bower et al.
model results.
In Fig. 3 we investigate the dependence of the merger rate
on the mass ratio of the pair components. We show results for the
Bower et al. model from which we selected galaxy pairs with mass
ratios smaller than 4:1, 6:1, and 10:1, as described in Section 3.
The amplitude of the merger rate derived from the model depends
strongly on the mass ratio adopted to select the pairs, and it is com-
patible with the observed one only when we consider a mass ratio
threshold of 10:1. The ﬁt of the results with the same function as
in equation (2) gives m = 0.59 for merger rates derived from pairs
with mass ratios smaller than 10:1, 0.63 for mass ratios of 6:1,
and 0.68 for mass ratios of 4:1. These results are consistent with a
roughly ﬂat evolution of the merger rate independently of the mass
ratio threshold adopted.

analytical galaxy formation model of Bower et al. (2006) considering mass

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this Letter, we have explored galaxy mergers in model universes
drawn from semi-analytical galaxy formation models implemented
on the Millennium Simulation of structure growth. From the public
galaxy catalogues and merger trees generated by the Bower et al.
(2006) and De Lucia & Blaizot (2007) models we retrieved the pair
fractions and the galaxy merger rate (number of galaxy mergers
per Gyr), and compared their redshift evolution with observational
results in the redshift range 0 < z < 2.
The results from our study indicate that the evolution of the
galaxy merger rate has been discrete since z ∼ 2, following an
exponential function given by Γmrg ∝ (1 + z)m, with m rang-
ing from 0.6 to 0.8 depending on the luminosity and mass ratios
of the merging galaxies. We ﬁnd that this behaviour is true only
for the Bower et al. model, since the model by De Lucia & Blaizot
(2007) predicts a null merger rate evolution (m ∼ 0), at odds
with the observations and the Bower et al. trends. The results for
the De Lucia & Blaizot (2007) model can be related to the study
carried out by Guo & White (2008) on the galaxy growth through
mergers and star formation based on it, where they have found a
nearly constant growth by mergers in the range 0 < z < 2, inde-
pendent of the galaxy stellar mass.
The weak evolution of the galaxy merger rate found in our
analysis is consistent with recent observational results obtained by
different approaches which give support for a ﬂat evolution of the
galaxy merger rate, with m ∼ 0.5 −1 (Bundy et al. 2004; Lin et al.
2004; Lotz et al. 2008). Previous studies have shown that in the hi-
erarchical framework the merger rate of cold dark matter haloes
increases rapidly with redshift also as (1 + z)m, but with the
exponent m ∼ 2 − 3 (e.g. Gottl¨ober, Klypin & Kravtsov. 2001;
Fakhouri & Ma 2007). However, as discussed by Berrier et al.
(2006), multiple galaxies may occupy the same parent dark matter
halo, resulting that the predicted galaxy merger rate should evolve
slower than the halo merger rate. Actually, in the present work we

merger rate predicted by the galaxy formation models shows that
the mass assembly evolution of galaxies through mergers does not
follow the rapid evolution of the halo merger rate obtained in pre-
vious studies.
