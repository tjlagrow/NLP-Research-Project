Abstract
theory with applications to formation of disks and of spheroids Forth-
coming deep surveys of galaxies with Keck and VLT will provide high
quality spectra of  105 galaxies that will probe stellar populations and
star formation rates at redshift unity This will help rene our phe-
nomenological knowledge of galaxy evolution and enable robust predic-
tions to be developed for future breakthroughs in understanding galaxy
formation at high redshift that are anticipated with NGST and with the
proposed new generation of 30 metre-class telescopes
Introduction
Galaxy formation is a complex process involving both gravity and hydrodynam-
ics and can be complicated by such ingredients as turbulence and astrochem-
istry The disks and the spheroids of galaxies have undergone distinct although
not necessarily uncoupled histories The physics of disk formation has made
considerable progress in no small part due to the pioneering review by Ken
Freeman in Stars and Stellar Systems Volume IX that assembled diverse obser-
vational and theoretical aspects together for the rst time Spheroid formation
is in a less satisfactory state in part because spheroids are old and so their for-
mation occurred long ago and there are correspondingly few direct clues We
do not yet have an adequate understanding of either disk or spheroid formation
There is a simple reason for this predicament We have no fundamental the-
ory of star formation the best we can do even in nearby regions of star fomation
is to assemble phenomenologically-motivated arguments and laws When phe-
nomenology is sparse as in the early universe all bets are o as to the scalability
of current epoch theory to the past Of course the lack of a robust theory has
never deterred theorists and in this talk I will highlight some of the key issues
currently confronting cosmologists
2 The eciency of star formation
Textbooks state that disks are blue and bulges are red The colours reect the
current star formation histories of these diverse systems Spiral galaxies are
undergoing star formation at a healthy rate some 10 Gyr or more after the disks
formed whereas spheroids such as that of our own galaxy have long since at
least 5 Gyr ago exhausted their gas supplies Reality is somewhat dierent and

there is no hard and fast discrimination via colours between disks and spheroids
It takes the merest trickle of star formation to bluen ellipticals or to generate
stellar population spectral line indicators symptomatic of relative youth Such
objects are found with increasing frequency as deeper and more complete surveys
are performed Of course red disks are a characteristic of S0 galaxies
21 Disks
Cold disks are gravitationally unstable and the instabilities are responsible for
the formation of the giant molecular clouds within which most stars form The
cold gas concentration increases as the cloud velocity dispersion is reduced For a
disk geometry both eects drive the Toomre gravitational instability parameter
Q  g down where g is the disk velocity dispersion and  is the disk
mass surface density Then Q  1 is the condition for the disk to be locally
stable against axisymmetric gravitational instabilities This is also a necessary
condition for global stability against non-axisymmetric instabilities Lowering
Q further destabilizes the disk and increases the star formation rate via cloud-
collision induced star formation
In order for disks to be actively forming stars today the eciency of star
formation must be low in order for the initial gas supply not to have been
exhausted The present gas accretion rate onto the disk as inferred from obser-
vations of the high velocity clouds is too low by an order of magnitude to sustain
ongoing star formation Indeed some of the high velocity clouds are likely to be
gas ejected from the galaxy rather than primordial clouds sustaining a halo gas
reservoir because of their near-solar chemical abundances At least one large
high velocity cloud complex is dust-poor and metal-poor Richter et al 2001
suggestive of primordial infall that has mixed with gas ejected from the disk
A simple argument for the low eciency of star formation in disks appeals
to feedback from supernovae Let vSN be the specic momentum injected by
supernovae per unit star formation rate  given by

the supernova energy taken to be 1051 ergs and g the metallicity relative to
solar of the ambient gas for an analytic t to a spherically symmetric supernova
remnant Cio Mckee and Bertschinger 1988 Here mSN is the mean mass
required in forming stars in order to produce a supernova For SNII one simply
assumes an initial mass function IMF with all stars of mass above 8 M be-
coming supernovae so that mSN  200 M for a Miller-Scalo IMF For a global
star formation rate of  3M yr1 the inferred supernova rate is  170 yr for
Type Ib Ic and II supernovae Capellaro et al 1997 One can increase the
inferred rate by  50 to include Type Ia supernovae for an estimate of the
total rate of supernovae after the rst 108 years have elapsed to allow sucient
time for SNIa to form
The momentum input from supernovae is dissipated via cloud-cloud colli-
sions and outow from the disk In a steady state the momentum input rate
vSN must balance the cloud collisional dissipational rate  pgl1

mentum carried out in outows  pgH 1 where pg is the turbulent pressure

The observed three-dimensional cloud velocity dispersion is 11 km s1 for

I equate
the star formation and star death rates and model the star formation rate by
initially only incorporating a dependence on local gas density and dynamical
  g Ignoring any outow or infall contributions to the momentum
budget one balances turbulence generation by gravitational instability driven
by large-scale shear and dierential rotation on large scales Wada and Norman

Norman 2001 A simple argument then leads to
gvSN  gg
so that   002 g10km s1 500km s1vSN This reasoning suggests that
supernova feedback can indeed yield the required low eciency of star formation
For a galaxy such as the Milky Way the global star formation eciency is
expected to be around 2 percent both as inferred from the global values of gas
mass  6109M and star formation rate  3Myr1 after allowance for gas
return from evolving stars the returned fraction  05 for a Miller-Scalo IMF
over a galactic dynamical time and as more directly inferred from studies of HII
region radio luminosities summed over molecular cloud masses eg Williams
and McKee 1997 Thus the Milky Way interstellar medium has a predicted
eciency of star formation comparable to what is observed
One consequence of a gravitationally unstable cloud-forming and star-forming
disk is that the turbulence seen today in cloud motions yields an eective viscos-
ity that can account for various properties of galactic disks including exponen-
tial surface brightness proles Silk and Norman 1981 Lin and Pringle 1987

22 Spheroids
In contrast with galactic disks star formation rates were once high and e-
cient in spheroids when they were gas-rich The obvious dierence is geometry
the gas velocity dispersion and hence gas pressure is much higher in forming
spheroids A more complex model is needed for the interstellar medium that ex-
plicitly incorporates the 3-dimensional geometry and the multiphase interstellar
medium
Even minor mergers result in gas being driven in substantial amounts into
the central regions of the galaxy The stage is set for spheroid formation The
gas mass and concentration is so high that a starburst must surely develop
as indeed is observed But the detailed conversion of gas into stars is poorly
understood Supernovae must play an important role in providing momentum
feedback and thereby controlling the duration of the starburst

I consider a two-phase medium in which dense cold clouds are embedded
in the hot supernova-heated diuse medium I model the volume of the hot
phase by porosity f  1  eP  and argue that the porosity P of the hot
medium controls the stellar feedback The porosity dened below is a measure
of the fraction of volume f occupied by the hot phase T  106 K associated
with the interiors of supernova remnants In the context of disk formation and
evolution breakout from the cold disk occurs if the porosity is large so that the
supernova-heated bubbles can penetrate into the halo and most of the kinetic
energy injected by the supernovae ows out in chimneys or fountains A plausible
condition for self-regulation is P  05
If the porosity is large outows develop and star formation is initially
enhanced by compression of cold clouds As the cold gas is depleted by both
star formation and outows star formation eventually is quenched In a disk
geometry the winds drive supernova ejecta out of the disk and thereby make
feedback ineective In a spheroid it should be easier to drive an outow through
the diuse medium if P is not too small
It seems likely that the enhanced gas concentration in the low P limit will
drive up the star formation rate and initiate a starburst This at least is the
generic assumption that underpins virtually all studies of merger-induced star
formation In other words low porosity enhances the feedback from supernovae
thereby driving up the porosity Hence P  05 seems to be the natural outcome
of the resulting self-regulation of star formation with a hot gas fraction f  05
applying in a quasi-steady state With self-regulation one is in the low eciency
regime Hence this will be the long-term fate of a starburst as the gas supply is
diminished by consumption in star formation and by outow
Starbursts are usually considered to characterize massive spheroid forma-
tion Observations of ULIRGs certainly imply high eciency of star formation
evidence for triggering by mergers at least in extreme cases and rapid generation
of a de Vaucouleurs-like prole Nevertheless one persistent line of reasoning that
stems from the cold dark matter scenario for hierarchical galaxy formation has
insistently and reasonably successfully argued that spheroids apart from their
nuclei form from dissipationless mergers of galaxies The stars form before the
spheroid is assembled In this way one can have an old stellar population in
place by z  1 where observational evidence seemingly insists that only passive
evolution has occurred for E and S0 galaxies in clusters and even in the eld
The occasional indications of intermediate age features Balmer absorption lines
etc seen especially in some eld ellipticals are explained by very low rates of
recent star formation Ferreras and Silk 2000
Hence low porosity leads to low feedback and high eciency of star forma-
tion while high porosity means strong feedback and low eciency Of course
if the porosity is too large P  1 any winds or outows are likely to be
suppressed via superbubbles that overlap and self-destruct The superbubble
interiors are fed by evaporation of cold entrapped gas clouds and this is the
source of the outows Hence it is logical to expect that for P  1 a wind
is driven
Indeed observations of star-forming galaxies including starbursts
show that ouow rates are on the order of the star formation rate Martin 1999

3 An analytic approach to star formation rates and eciency
One may quantify these arguments on porosity as follows Porosity is dened to
be the product of the supernova remnant 4-volume at maximum extent when
halted by ambient gas pressure and the rate of bubble production One can then
write the porosity as P   mSN cid16 4

rate per unit volume mSN is the mass in stars formed per supernova and Ra
is the radius of the supernova remnant at time ta when halted by the ambient

It is relevant to look at the porosity of nearby star-forming galaxies Oey
Clarke and Massey 2001 note that one can approximate the porosity as
P  16

where a Salpeter IMF has been adopted and an ambient disk interstellar medium
pressure pk  9500 cm3K has been assumed Here hd and Rd are the gas disk
scale-height and scale-length respectively and  is the global star formation
rate The Local Group galaxies display a wide range of global porosities from
the extreme case of IC10 P  20 to M33 P  03 and the SMC P  02
In fact a value of P of order unity as inferred both for the LMC and for
the Milky Way this latter case being based on the observed supernova rate
would seem to be not untypical for large galaxies  01L admittedly based
on rather poor statistics While the situation for our own galaxy is confusing
with regard to direct HI mapping and determination of P Heiles 2000 there
is substantial infall to and outow from the galactic disk as seen in OVI surveys
performed by the FUSE satellite One can make a strong case that P  1 for the
LMC from HI maps and that there is substantial injection of mechanical energy
from regions of star formation into the diuse interstellar medium by expanding
HI supershells Kim et al 1999 The OVI absorption studies show that the
mass-ow rate from one side of the LMC disk is about 1Myr1 Howk et al
2001 This is comparable to the global star formation rate for the LMC
The role of supernovae in driving the observed superbubbles is inferred
indirectly but supernovae appear to provide the dominant injection of energy
Excess expansion rates are measured relative to the standard assumptions for OB
stellar wind-driven outows and excess x-ray luminosities are measured relative
to the estimated post-shock luminosities The occurence of several supernovae
within a given superbubble is a natural expectation given any reasonable IMF
and seems to be required by the observations
The porosity ansatz provides the motivation for the feedback prescription
By incorporating an analytic t to the evolution of a spherically symmetric
supernova-driven shell one can write

one explicitly incorporates feedback into the star formation rate The star for-
mation rate is controlled by ambient pressure Thus even in starbursts as long
as P  05 a Schmidt-type relation is maintained The predicted eciency is
around 2 for the Milky Way disk in agreement with the estimate from 2

The feedback is weak P  1 if the gas pressure is large Very high tur-
bulence quenches the porosity because of the high gas pressure In a starburst
the star formation rate is high and the eciency is high but the porosity of the
hot medium is initially low Feedback is small and one has runaway star for-
mation Nothing impedes gas accretion cooling and collapse The low porosity
does not necessarily quench outows which can be carried by the neutral gas
and hence driven by the momentum input into the neutral interstellar medium
The runaway star formation will result in an increase in the porosity Hence
P  1 should apply most of the time Outows will then be common
A top-heavy IMF could substantially reduce vSN  and star formation e-
ciences of order 50 would then readily be attainable even with modest levels
of interstellar turbulence Such eciencies may be needed in order to account
for the luminosities measured in some ultraluminous infrared galaxies where the
molecular gas masses are measured A top-heavy stellar initial mass function
might be required in protogalaxy mergers in order to reconcile the hypothesis
that ellipticals formed in such events with the inferred paucity of young ellipti-
cals at intermediate redshifts
There may be other indications that the IMF in the early universe may
be more weighted to massive stars and light production than the local IMF A
quantitative comparison is between the star formation rate and measured rest-
UV luminosity density from star-forming galaxies at z  3 with the local K-
band luminosity density where for reasonable extinction corrections a possible
overproduction of old starlight is inferred for a local near infrared IMF Cole
et al 2001 Similar conclusions come from diuse extragalactic background
light Observations at optical wavelengths Bernstein Freedman and Madore
APS Conf Ser Style
2001 combined with the UV and FIR diuse extragalactic light backgrounds
yield a total extragalactic background light density of 100 20nw m2 sr1 Such
an intensity predominantly from high redshift galaxies overproduces the local
stellar density by about a factor of 2 for a standard IMF
4 A unied approach to galaxy formation
There are three approaches that have been explored towards developing a unied
approach to galaxy formation
41 Numerical hydrodynamics
The loss of protogalactic angular momentum is conrmed by high resolution
simulations Disks are a factor  10 too small The resolution of this problem
requires more realistic modelling of disk formation that incorporates gas physics
and stellar feedback
Disks are two-dimensional systems which makes their stability easier to
model The three-dimensional components of galaxies are not well understood
One has made most progress with the the dark matter halos although the
characteristic halo scale dened by the density prole is also controversial The
NFW prole Navarro Frenk and White 1997 certainly has a scale but it
may not be the correct scale as dened by the dark matter cores according to
high resolution simulations of dark matter halos The concentration of dark
matter appears to be excessive in the inner disk of our galaxy Binney and
Evans 2001 and in barred spirals Debattista and Sellwood 2000 Central dark
matter cusps are predicted Ghigna et al 2000 Jing and Suto 2000 Klypin
et al 2001 that are not observed in LSB dwarfs van den Bosch and Swaters
2001 The halo substructure results in considerable angular momentum losss
from the dissipating baryons to the dark matter forming disks that are far too
small Navarro and Steinmetz 2000 All of these problems presently plague
numerical modelling of disk galaxy formation
These various diculties on subgalactic scales have been touted as creat-
ing a crisis for the cold dark matter scenario of galaxy formation hitherto so
remarkably successful on larger scales Possible resolutions come under two
distinct guises tinkering with the particle physics or elaborating on the astro-
physics The former class of solutions appeals to invoking new theories of gravity
that may even dispense entirely with the need for any dark matter or to the
introduction of exotic varieties of particle dark matter such as self-interacting
or warm dark matter The astrophysical possibilities include various types of
feedback that might involve dynamical interactions between baryons and the
dark matter Proposals include a combination of angular momentum transfer to
and heating of dark matter via a massive primordial rotating baryonic bar which
would undergo resonant interactions with the dark matter Weinberg and Katz
2001 and drive massive gaseous outows Binney Gerhard and Silk 2001
Bulge sizes are equally a mystery as far as any fundamental theory of galaxy
formation is concerned At least one may hope that the scale of disks ultimately
comes from angular momentum considerations with the initial angular momen-
tum being obtained from second-order theory of tidal torques between density
Author  Co-author
uctuations in combination with feedback considerations The nal bulge sizes
are determined by the complex star-gas interactions in a starburst
Fully numerical treatments of galaxy formation include N-body simulations
to follow the dark matter and the stars coupled with hydrodynamics to follow
the gas dynamics The procedure has succeeded in commencing with cosmo-
logical scales zooming in at progressively higher resolution with adaptive mesh
techniques and a grid-based code to resolve the scales on which the rst stars
may have formed around 100M Abel Bryan and Norman 2000 This at least
is where the fragmentation seems to terminate The resulting gas clumps are
identied with the rst stars
Unfortunately the adaptive approach only succeeds in resolving a single
clump that is assumed to be repesentative of the entire protogalaxy Moreover
there is no guarantee that further fragmentation does not occur Additional
complexities include feedback from the rst massive stars that will modify sub-
sequent cooling fragmentation and star formation The numerical scheme of
adaptive mesh renement cannot yet tackle global aspects of galaxy formation
This approach is ideal however for providing the crucial subgrid physics which
one can eventually hope to combine with galaxy-scale simulations
Another approach to modelling feedback is to use smooth particle hydrody-
namics SPH to model a large volume of the universe resimulating the dense
peaks where galaxies form at high resolution SPH allows feedback to be stud-
ied over galaxy scales However feedback prescriptions have not hitherto been
eective or convincing forming either forming disks too late by arguing that
feedback globally delays gas cooling and hence star formation Weil Eke and
Efstathiou 1998 or by inserting an ad hoc delay between energy feedback from
massive star deaths and gas cooling Couchman and Thacker 2001
Sommer-Larsen 2002 has incorporated simple star formation rules into a
feedback model and has succeeded with a SPH code in producing disks that
are within a factor 2 of the observed size The disks form inside-out but still
have a substantial number of old stars from previous accretion events in their
outer parts as seen in the outer regions of M31 Ferguson and Johnson 2001
Subsequent gas infall occurs even at the current epoch and x-ray observations of
halos provide an important constraint on models of disks and spheroids Isolated
ellipticals in particular should contain a considerable reservoir of hot gas
42 Semi-analytical galaxy formation
Semi-analytical theory uses N-body simulations to sample a large volume and
determine the density peaks and velocity minima where galaxy formation is likely
to occur Monte-Carlo realisations are constructed of the merging histories of
dark matter halos Continuing cooling occurs around dense peaks in the density
eld Cooling is rapid in these regions and this is where the galaxies form Gas
disks are the basic objects to form rst Mergers occur in the denser regions
where there are adjacent peaks These are the regions that eventually form
clusters of galaxies More quiescent accretion occurs in the relatively isolated
regions
Star formation rules are then applied in each local environment to gener-
ate galactic disks in the accretion-dominated regions via a Schmidt-type law
Ellipticals form in the merging environments via starbursts There is no eec-
APS Conf Ser Style
tive resolution of galaxy scales Initial scales are associated with the radius at
maximum extent of an overdensity of specied mass with angular momentum
assumed to subsequently be conserved The protogalactic cloud forms with the
small value of initial dimensionless angular momentum   005 that is gen-
erated by tidal torques between neighbouring uctuations and attains virial
equilibrium at a fraction  of the maximum radius A simple law is used for
the star formation rate in the resulting disk taken to be proportional to the gas
density divided by the local free fall time and cold gas infall continues to feed
the disk
Population synthesis combined with dust modelling yields colours and counts
Somerville  Primack 1999 Benson et al 2000 Devriendt and Guiderdoni
2000 Kaumann  Haehnelt 2000 Spiral galaxies are relatively isolated galax-
ies that have not undergone a signicant merger within the past 5-10 Gyr El-
liptical galaxies are assumed to form via major mergers on a dynamical time
scale with stars assumed to form in a starburst
Once the parameters are carefully adjusted including feedback the semi-
analytical approach provides good agreement with the observed luminosity func-
tion multi-wavelength band galaxy counts redshift distributions and cosmic star
formation histories It has successfully reproduced the clustering of the Lyman
break galaxy populations Accretion occurs primarily along laments and sheets
of dark matter Early galaxy formation occurs in overdense laments of dark
matter
The theory is less predictive on issues that involve star formation In the
hierarchical theory most stars form relatively late and it is not clear whether the
colours spectra and luminosities of galaxies at redshift unity can be reproduced
Forthcoming surveys will provide the data base with which the current models
can be denitively tested and rened Unfortunately the semi-analytic models
are not especially robust There are several adjustable parameters and detailed
exploration of the large parameter space for the gas and star formation physics
is not feasible Nor is there any resolution of the question of the determination
of disk or bulge sizes Ultra-high resolution simulations will be needed in order
to make substantive progress in our understanding of how galaxies formed
43 Phenomenological galaxy formation
Analytical theory comes in dierent avours within a strongly phenomenological
context Backwards galaxy formation is one example where models are made of
nearby disks that are evolved back in time This has the advantage of allowing
the incorporation of realistic star formation modelling but cannot easily cope
with mergers and infall Angular momentum conservation not necessarily the
best of approximations plays a key role in generating low surface brightness
galaxies Dalcanton Spergel and Summers 1997 and in modelling the Tully-
Fisher relation for disk galaxies Mo Mao and White 1998 Accretion of gas and
viscous disk self-regulation are central to the approach of Firmani Hernandez
and Gallagher 2000
A phenomenological variant has been developed that involves galaxy colli-
sions and mergers Balland Silk  Schaeer 1998 by using tidal interactions to
determine where and when the dierent morphological types form normalizing
the theory to the morphological dependence on local density This approach
Author  Co-author
is almost completely phenomenological Ellipticals form by rare major mergers
and disks form by prolonged infall which is equivalent to a sequence of minor
mergers
The analytic approach to merger physics is parametrised by an approximate
t to the collision cross-section to estimate the energy exchange incurred in tidal
interactions and mergers Strong interactions leading to mergers are assumed to
form ellipticals with intermediate strength interactions between galaxies gen-
erating harassment Moore et al 1999 that results in S0 formation Minor
interactions typical of the eld result in spiral galaxy formation The fraction
of elliptical S0 and spiral galaxies can be predicted as a function of redshift and
of mean local density
To make contact with observations star formation and chemical evolution
must be incorporated Gas cools radiatively within the halos settles into a disk
and forms stars Semi-empirical recipes are used to account for various astro-
physical processes including star formation eciency dust opacity absorption
and emission and feedback Devriendt and Guiderdoni 2000 The spectral evo-
lution model Devriendt Guiderdoni  Sadat 1999 self-consistently links the
optical and the far-IRsubmillimeter emission One then selects every galaxy
identied as an early type galaxy to undergo an obscured starburst phase
whose intensity and duration are controlled by the amount of gas available for
star formation
A fair overall agreement is found between between models and data Silk
and Devriendt 2001 Balland Devriendt and Silk 2002 Late-type galaxies
dominate the counts and background light relative to early types in the optical
and the far-IR but at longer wavelengths the contribution of early-type galaxies
exceeds that from late types This behaviour is of course due to the negative k-
correction which makes galaxies of the same bolometric luminosity as bright at
redshift 5 as at redshift 05 This eect is only important in the submillimeter
for SCUBA at 850 microns because the peak rest frame emissivity of
dust occurs between 60 and 100 microns Since the S0s and ellipticals form at
z  2  3 the associated redshifted emission dominates the diuse background
at wavelengths greater than about 300 microns
Some closing remarks
Stellar evolution from birth to death is the key to understanding galaxy forma-
tion Observations of galaxy evolution are ourishing as never before thanks to
the availability of the 8 metre-class telescopes Imminent surveys with Keck and
VLT will provide samples of  105 galaxies at z  15 with sucient spectral
resolution to study stellar population and star formation rate evolution
Theory lags far behind the data Our best hope may be to construct a
phenomenological model that incorporates the successes of the numerical sim-
ulations and of the semianalytic studies This will surely involve a backwards
approach using the nearby universe to eectively simulate the universe at red-
shift unity This has already been done apart from the essential complication
now under intensive study of developing the small-scale stellar and interstellar
physics input that is so crucial for understanding and modelling feedback
APS Conf Ser Style
Rening this model with the new data sets that we anticipate from the
DEIMOS and VIRMOS surveys we can then hope to take the next step back-
wards in time by developing predictions for NGST and the 30 metre-class tele-
scopes thare now under design study to probe the epoch of the rst galaxies at
z  6 when reionization occurred The future beckons brightly
