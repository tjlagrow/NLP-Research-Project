Most sensory cells use surface receptors to detect environmental stimuli and initiate downstream
signaling Cooperative interactions among sensory receptors is known to play a crucial role in en-
hancing the sensitivity of biochemical processes such as oxygen sensing by hemoglobin but whether
cooperativity enhances the delity with which a system with multiple receptors can accurately and
quickly detect a signal is poorly understood We model the kinetics of small clusters of receptors
in the presence of ligand where the receptors act independently or cooperatively We show that
the interaction strength and how it is coupled to the dynamics inuences the macroscopic observ-
ables Contrary to recent reports our analysis shows that receptor cooperativity can increase the
signal-to-noise ratio but this increase depends on the underlying dynamics of the signaling receptor
cluster

Biological systems must precisely respond to small
changes in environmental cues to carry out essential func-
tions The best studied example of this precision is the
cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin which al-
lows for tight binding of molecular oxygen under high
concentrations in the lung and near complete unbinding
under low concentrations at distal locations This switch-
like response is essential for eciently carrying out tasks
and cooperativity allows hemoglobin to tune binding and
unbinding over a very narrow physiological range Sim-
ilarly sensory cells must respond to both small changes
in external ligand concentrations and shallow chemical
gradients with high accuracy For example chemotactic
bacteria such as Escherichia coli can detect and respond
to extremely small changes in attractant concentrations
near the fundamental Berg-Purcell limit 1 which is set
by ligand diusion It is interesting to imagine that co-
operative interactions between receptors may also help
increase signal detection since recent experiments have
demonstrated that the bacterial agellar motor which is
involved in the biochemical pathway for chemotaxis is
highly cooperative 2 3 and cell surface receptors form
clusters 4 Indeed it has been suggested that clustering
allow receptors to interact cooperatively 5 but there is
no theoretical basis to suggest that cooperativity helps
with signal detection
Cell signaling is initiated through ligand binding to the
extracellular domains of surface receptors leading to re-
ceptor activation Fig 1a The increase in receptor
activity is directly proportional to the amplitude of the
downstream cellular signal In recent years there have
been several theoretical studies exploring the role of coop-
erativity in biological signal transduction 69 Working
within the framework of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux
MWC model Bialek and Setayeshgar 6 showed that
receptor cooperativity lowers the threshold required to
sense a change in concentration bringing the value closer
to the Berg-Purcell limit Moreover Hu et al 7 em-
ployed an Ising-type model to show that receptor coop-
erativity improves gradient sensing in a two dimensional
model of the cell embedded in a chemical gradient A cru-
cial concept in signal transduction is the ability to detect
the signal over the intrinsic noise in the system which is
known as the signal-to-noise SNR ratio This is partic-
ularly important in the present case since cooperativity
not only sensitizes the receptors response to a signal but
also amplies their intrinsic noise due to stochastic uc-
tuations between activated and inactivated states In this
regard Skoge et al 9 also employing a dynamic Ising
model recently showed that cooperativity in chemore-
ceptor activity slows down receptor activation leading to
a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio compared to non-
interacting receptors They showed that this result was
true for one and two dimensional Ising models making
strong implications that cooperativity does not enhance
signal detection
The well-known advantages of cooperativity in signal
detection juxtaposed with the recent claim that cooper-
ativity fails to enhance the SNR motivated us to more
closely examine the role of receptor kinetics on this phe-
nomena
In this Letter we formulate the equilibrium
energetics of a small cluster of N interacting receptors
using the formalism of statistical mechanics and the sys-
tems dynamics are then studied using classical chemi-
cal kinetics in which forward and reverse rate constants
determine the transition rates between distinct struc-
tural states of the system Fig 1 The MWC 10 and
Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer KNF 11 models make up
two seminal schemes for describing the kinetic states in-
volved in the allosteric activation of proteins Here we
closely follow the KNF model which assumes that re-
ceptor activation immediately follows from ligand bind-
ing and the activation state of neighboring subunits in-
uence the kinetics of activation and deactivation
general there are very few constraints placed on a sys-
tems dynamics given its energetics and conformational
state space and because of this the kinetics can be im-
posed in a number of ways For the spin system it is
between receptors and h is related to the energy of ligand
binding Specically h  lnLKD depends on the
bulk ligand concentration L and the ligand dissociation
constant KD For J  0 the system is cooperative and
receptors are biased toward the active state while J  0
is a model of N independent receptors
We describe the time evolution of a system of N re-
ceptors as shown in Fig 1c using the master equation
written here in matrix form
where P is a column vector with N  1 components pnt
and K is a N  1  N  1 tridiagonal matrix whose
nonzero elements are given by Knn  konnkon
Kn1n  konn  1 and Knn1  kon  1 Here
pnt is the normalized probability of observing n ac-
tive receptors kon is the rate at which a single re-
ceptor deactivates given that n receptors are active and
konn is the rate at which a single receptor is acti-
vated given that n receptors are active We use reecting
boundary conditions such that kon1 ko0  0 and
konN  koN  1  0 for the fully inactive and fully
activated states respectively 19 The average num-
ber of active receptors at any point in time At

The ratio of the forward and reverse transition rates
between any two adjacent states in Fig 1c is related
to the energetics of the system through the principle of
detailed balance

where En  En1En is the energy dierence in ther-
mal units between the two states and the values N  n
and n  1 account for the number of available receptors
for activation or deactivation respectively Our ener-
getic and kinetic formulation in Eqs 2-3 adheres closely
to the approach laid out in Ref 15 According to Eq

En  nn  1J2  nh leading to En  nJ  h
Given the denition of h the ligand dependent term be-
comes exph  kLk where kL and k are the
base activation and deactivation rates for a solitary recep-
tor respectively The dissociation constant KD  kk
is dened as the ratio of k and k Thus a denition
of the rate constants that is consistent with Eq 3 is

energetically coupled Unlike nearest neighbor Ising models
all receptors in a cluster interact with all other receptors
This is a reasonable assumption for the small cluster numbers
considered here since the proteins likely remain in physical
contact c State diagram with activation and deactivation

common to use Glauber dynamics 12 to determine the
time evolution of a system However detailed balance
only restrains the ratio of the forward to backward rate
constants and many biochemical systems fail to follow
either of these dynamics 13 14 We show here that the
relationship between SNR and receptor cooperatively is
highly dependent on the manner in which detailed bal-
ance is enforced
We consider small clusters of N interacting receptors
and each receptor can exist in two states activated or
inactivated The interaction between receptors is based
on the physical proximity of the receptors in a cluster
rather than their requirement to fall on a regular lat-
tice and therefore the activationdeactivation rate of
any given receptor depends on the activation state of all
other receptors in the cluster Fig 1b The corre-

Eq 4 reduces to the standard kinetics for ligand binding

hibiting positive cooperativity with J  0 tuning  from

a kinetic model in which cooperativity only inuences
the forward rates and not the reverse rates results from

and we see that as the coupling constant  increases the
activation curve becomes more sigmoidal as expected for
highly cooperative transitions such as oxygen binding to
hemoglobin Unlike dynamic properties discussed next
the equilibrium properties depend only on the ratio of
forward and backward transition rates
To determine the kinetic properties of the system after
a change in ligand concentration at t  0 we must solve
the full master equation in Eq 2 which can be done
formally as

As shown in Fig 2b RT  increases as cooperativity
is introduced into the system As expected from a shift in
the energetics of the active state   2 leads to greater
activity than   1 - the non-interacting case Addi-
tionally the response time of the system depends on the
kinetic model with   1 eliciting faster dynamics than
  12 since the forward rate constants are larger The
response kinetics of a cluster can be understood more
quantitatively in terms of the correlation time c which
characterizes the time required for the response to decay

addition of cooperativity slows the dynamics as can be
seen qualitatively in Fig 2b but as shown in Fig 2d
c is much smaller for   1 dynamics than Galuber
dynamics which have   12 In fact this dierence
becomes more pronounced as the cluster size increases
Nonetheless regardless of the kinetic model the static
response R is independent of  and the solid and
dashed lines converge at longer times
For a given observation time T  the signal-to-noise ra-
tio is dened as
2T 
where 2T  is the average intrinsic noise of the receptor
cluster averaged over time T  The response of a multi-
ple independent receptors is always amplied relative to
that of the single receptor Thus a cluster of N non-
interacting receptors has a signal-to-noise ratio which is
N times the SNR of a single receptor When cooperativ-
ity is introduced into the system this linear scaling no
longer holds and the quantity must be calculated using
the master equation

receptors after averaging for time T  is given in ref 1

tion of the signal over multiple transitions from active
to inactive leads to a reduction in the variance as shown
in Fig 2c However the speed with which the variance
decays is directly related to the time required for a recep-
tor to cycle between active and inactive states which is
roughly twice the systems correlation time c as shown
previously 17 18 For large observation times much
greater than c the variance becomes

SNR  1  N
We calculated the SNR at time T for clusters containing
4 receptors and no cooperativity   1 blue curve in
Fig 3a As expected the SNR increases as the ligand
concentration is increased Next we introduced increas-
ing amounts of cooperativity by tuning  from 1 to 2
For these calculations we assumed model kinetics with
  1 Surprisingly we realized that cooperativity in-
creased the SNR as can be most clearly seen in Fig 3b
where the ratio of the SNR for a cooperative cluster to a
non cooperative cluster is always greater than one This
result indicates that receptors always benet from co-
operativity when   1 The increased SNR for a co-
operative cluster has a strong dependence on the ligand
concentration and its advantage reaaches a maximum
around LKD  03 for the   2 case For a large
cluster containing 12 receptors the SNR ratio is dramat-
ically increased and for   2 the cooperative cluster
is over 10 times more sensitive than the non interacting
receptors Fig 3c The SNRs dependence on ligand
concentration is even more pronounced and it is shifted
to lower concentration values compared to the smaller
cluster This sharp transition arises from a combination
of a more sigmoidal binding curve and a decreased cor-
relation time c Therefore both the equilibrium and
kinetic properties play a role in increasing the SNR For
small ligand concentrations cooperativity in large clus-
ters dramatically suppresses the SNR Fig 3c This
suppression arises from decreased receptor activation be-
low threshold Finally in Fig 3d we show that a clus-
ter of 4 receptors obeying Glauber dynamics exhibit a
reduction in the SNR for high ligand concentrations con-
sistent with a recent report 9 Nonetheless for small
ligand concentrations cooperativity modestly increases
the SNR
Here we show that cooperativity can increase or de-
crease the SNR of a receptor cluster depending on the
dynamics of receptor activation For   1 the SNR can
be dramatically increased with respect to a group of non
interacting receptors but this increase is highly depen-
dent on ligand concentration Moreover for   12 the
SNR is either reduced or only marginally increased with
respect to a cluster of non interacting receptors This
later result is consistent with previous work 9 but here
we have shown that the SNR depends heavily on ligand
concentration as well Increased sensitivity comes from
both the equilibrium properties of the receptors and their
intrinsic dynamics The SNR can be increased dynami-
cally by decreasing the correlation time Cooperativity
reduces the correlation time for clusters with   1 dy-
namics while the correlation time increases for clusters
