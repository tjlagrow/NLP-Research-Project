Abstract
This paper considers the eect of Hawking radiation on an eternal black
hole - that is a maximally extended Schwarzschild solution Symmetry
considerations that hold independent of the details of the emission mech-
anism show there is an inconsistency in the claim that such a blackhole
evaporates away in a nite time In essence because the external domain
is static there is an innite time available for the process to take place
so whenever the evaporation process is claimed to come to completion it
should have happened earlier The problem is identied to lie in the claim
that the locus of emission of Hawking radiation lies just outside the glob-
ally dened event horizon Rather the emission domain must be mainly
located inside the event horizon so most of the Hawking radiation ends up
at this singularity rather than at innity and the black hole never evapo-
rates away This result supports a previous claim 12 that astrophysical
black holes do not evaporate
Introduction
The current dominant viewpoint as regards astrophysical black holes is that
due to Hawking radiation 17 3 the singularity hidden behind the event
horizon completely evaporates away within a nite time so at late times there
is no singularity 18 26 3 21
The question addressed in this paper is whether this scenario is true also in
the case of eternal black holes that is whether maximally extended Kruskal-
Schwarzschild solutions completely evaporate away in a nite time due to Hawk-
ing radiation The radiation mechanism is the same in both cases so the same
result can be expected Birrell and Davies conrm that this is so on the basis
of essentially the same calculations eternal black holes will also evaporate away
in a nite time 3 Chapter 8 Don Page private communication agrees and
states this as follows
I do believe that if one takes the Cauchy data for the gravitational
eld to be given on a Cauchy slice through the maximally extended
Kruskal-Schwarzschild vacuum solution of mass m and one includes
quantum elds that are in a regular quantum state on this Cauchy
slice that does not greatly distort the metric on this slice from the
gravitational constraint equations then the future evolution of that
quantum state will include Hawking radiation that will make the
black hole evaporate away in a time cid39 8895 m3 for this coecient
assuming m  msun spherical symmetry and emission mostly into
photons and gravitons and no other particles of rest-mass energy
less than a nano-electron volt
I will call this The Evaporation Hypothesis
This paper shows that the Evaporation Hypothesis cannot be true because
of a paradox this claim is inconsistent with the symmetries of the maximally
extended Kruskal-Schwarzschild vacuum solution The argument is independent
of any details of the radiation emission process it depends only on symmetry
properties of the spacetime I will call this the Hawking Radiation Paradox
I will then consider what kind of resolution of the paradox is possible Two
elements are signicant here 12
 Taking in into account the back reaction eect of the Hawking radiation
on the emission domain
 The possibility that the emission domain is not determined by the global
event horizon but rather by locally determined Marginally Outer Trapped
3-surfaces MOTS
The result is still indeterminate because of the left-right symmetry and the arrow
of time symmetry of the maximal Kruskal-Schwarzschild vacuum solution A
third element is required to get a clear resolution
 One can break both symmetries by imbedding the space-time in a standard
cosmological context where the evolution of the universe seta a direction
of time and cosmic blackbody background radiation at present Cosmic
Microwave Background radiation CMB pervades the whole universe
The conclusion then is that most of the Hawking outgoing radiation is emitted
behind the event horizon and ends up on the future singularity rather than
escaping to innity Consequently blackhole evaporation does not take place in
this case This resolves the paradox
The further implication is that total evaporation does not take place in the
case of astrophysical black holes either because the emission mechanism is es-
sentially the same in both cases Indeed I have argued in a previous paper 12
that because of the three features just mentioned astrophysical black holes do
not evaporate but rather there will always be a remnant mass left behind The
present paper supports that view
An outline of the paper is as follows Section 2 denes some key concepts
Section 3 looks at the geometry of eternal black holes emphasizing their sym-
metry properties Section 4 presents the current canonical semi-classical view
as applied to this context Section 5 gives the main result the symmetry prop-
erties of the solution contradict the Evaporation Hypothesis Section 6 briey
summarizes the way the elements mentioned above lead to a new semi-classical
picture where eternal black holes result Section 7 considers two aspects of the
outcome First the information loss paradox is resolved by this proposal be-
cause the black hole never radiates totally away Second this result supports
the argument in 12 that astrophysical black holes do nt radiate away
2 Preliminaries
The analysis depends on the propagation of radiation and nature of trapping
surfaces for null geodesics
21 Null geodesics
Radiation propagates on irrotational null geodesics with ane parameter  and
tangent vector ka
 kaka  0 ka
bkb  0
The divergence  of a bundle of these geodesics given by   ka
how the cross sectional area A of the bundle changes
a determines
The rate of change of  down the null geodesics is given by the null Raychaud-
huri equation 20 2112
 2  2ij ij  Rabkakb
where ij is the shear of the null geodesics and the Ricci tensor Rab is deter-
mined pointwise by the Einstein eld equations
22 Trapping 2 surfaces
The gravitational eld of a black hole tends to hold light in hence it decreases
the divergence  of the outgoing null geodesics in a spherically symmetric
spacetime for any 2-sphere Sr t  r  const t  const as r tends form
above to the critical value 2m The divergence  of the outgoing null geodesics
is positive for r  2m A marginally trapped outer 2-surface SM OT S occurs
when the gravitational eld due to the central mass is so large that divergence
 of the outgoing geodesics vanishes
Denition Marginally Outer Trapped 2-Surface SM OT S
A spacelike 2-sphere Sr t    const   const is said to be
a Marginally Outer Trapped 2-Surface if the expansion  of the
outward null normal vanishes
SM OT S  0
This will happen in a Schwarzschild solution when rM OT S  2m For smaller
values of r the 2-spheres Sr t lying at coordinate values r t will be closed
trapped surfaces SCT S that is
rCT S  2m  SCT S  0
Then as the energy condition
Rabkakb  0
is satised by 3 the outgoing null geodesics from SCT S will converge within a
nite ane distance 2113 and so will lie in the interior of the future of SCT S
2114 As these geodesics bound the causal future of the 2-sphere SCT S this
future will then be conned to a compact spacetime region which implies a
spacetime singularity must occur in the future of SCT S 30 20 2128
23 Trapping 3-surfaces
When radiation is present back reaction eects will make the horizon dynamical
We generalise the denition of dynamical horizons by Ashtekar and Krishnan
1 by removing the restriction that it be a spacelike surface As these surfaces
need not be dynamic we refer to them as Marginally Trapped 3-surfaces rather
than dynamic horizons Thus
Denition Marginally Outer Trapped 3-Surface MOTS
A smooth three-dimensional sub-manifold H in a space-time is said
to be a Marginally Outer Trapped 3-Surfaceif it is foliated by a pre-
ferred family of 2-spheres such that on each leaf S the expansion
cid96 of one null normal cid96a vanishes and the expansion n of the
other null normal na is strictly negative
Consequently a Marginally Outer Trapped 3-Surface H is a 3-manifold which
is foliated by marginally trapped 2-spheres On this denition such 3-surfaces
can be timelike spacelike or null with rather dierent properties The essential
point is that they are locally dened and therefore are able respond to local
dynamic change You dont need to know what is happening at innity in order
to determine a local physical eect
The expansion cid96 of the outgoing null normal cid96a vanishes on the MOTS
and is either positive in the outside region when it will be called an OMOTS or
negative when it will be called an EMOTS The two dierent kinds of MOTS
surfaces have crucially dierent properties An OMOTS is the outer bound of
a trapping domain an EMOTS is the inner bound This dierence can be ex-
pressed in terms of derivatives of the divergence  of the outgoing null geodesics
As in 1 consider outgoing null geodesics to the 2-spheres Sv r with tangent
vector cid96a and ingoing null geodesics with tangent vector na Then the MOTS
3-surfaces dened by cid96  0 are associated with the gradient of cid96 in the
na direction which determines if the MOTS 3-surface is timelike or spacelike as
follows 1 for a proof see 8 Section IIB

Table 1 Relation between trapping properties and causal character of non-
null MOTS 3-surfaces
In the case of a null MOTS cid96na can have either sign as can be seen
from the maximally extended Schwarzschild solution or indeed can vanish as
can be seen from plane wave solutions Thus a null MOTS can be either an
EMOTS or an OMOTS
We notice for future reference a key point we have assumed here it is obvious
which is the outwards and which the inwards direction However the maximal
Kruskal-Schwarzschild is degenerate and this distinction is not always obvious
In such cases these denitions relate to a pre-determined choice of what is the
exterior and what the interior that must be careful stated
24 Past and future trapping surfaces
A further point is that the trapping properties of a MOTs depends on the rela-
tion to the direction of time
In the above what is outgoing and what is ingoing also depends on the
choice of the direction of time We also assume this to be given Then there
can be two kinds of MOTS 3-surfaces
 Future directed MOTS 3-surfaces denoted MOTS for which the
denition above relates to the outgoing null geodesics in the future direc-
tion of time
 Past directed MOTS 3-surfaces denoted MOTS- for which the
denition above relates to the outgoing null geodesics in the past direction
of time
Future MOTS surfaces are associated with trapping domains they restrict where
particles can go in the future Past MOTS surfaces do not do so the direction
of time is wrong for this to happen
25 Horizons
A horizon limits causal contact with the outside world It is necessarily a null
surface and is the boundary separating events which can escape to innity from
those that cannot If you are inside the horizon you cannot send a signal to the
outside world and have to end up at the singularity
A MOTS surface can be a horizon but generically is not one
Indeed it
cannot be one if it is not null However in the Kruskal-Schwarzschild solution
they are the same This is one of the degeneracies of that solution
3 Classical Eternal Black Holes
In the case of classical general relativity eternal black holes are characterised
by existence of both past singularity and future singularities the latter lying
behind and an event horizon that hides it from the outside world 3020 21
The singularities are spacelike and the mass m of the black hole is unchanging
31 The Kruskal-Schwarzschild solution
Eternal black holes are described by the maximal extension of the Schwarzschild
spherically symmetric vacuum solution characterised by its mass m
311 Coordinates and metric
The exterior part r  2m is given in standard spherical coordinates by 20
ds2  1  2m
The timelike world line r  const   const   const for r  2m are
symmetry orbits every point on these curves is physically equivalent to every
other one Proper time along them is given by

312 Extension to r  2m
The metric 7 is singular at r  2m but there exist regular coordinates across
this null surface 20 Dene

 r  2m logr  2m
then v  t  r is an advanced null coordinate and w  t  r is a retarded
null coordinate By using coordinates r v one attains an extension across the
horizon r  2m joining the exterior and interior regions using coordinates
r w one attains an extension across the horizon r  2m joining the exterior
to a dierent interior region One has two add a further exterior domain to get
the maximal extension see 20 for details
On conformally rescaling these coordinates the metric 7 can be rewritten
in a double-null form which is regular for all r  0 This can then be presented
in terms of a Penrose-Carter conformal diagram shown in Figure 1 2145
32 Domains
The solution has four domains labelled I-IV connected across null horizons It is
static for r  2m as t is a timelike Killing vector eld and hence Domains
I and III region are eternal they do not come to an end at any nite positive
or negative value of the time parameter t The solution is dynamic for r  2m
which occurs in Domains II and IV The green lines mark surfaces of constant
r timelike in domains I and III spacelike in domains II and IV
1 Domain I An outer vacuum spacetime bounded on the outer sides by
past and future null innity and on the inner side by an OMOTS
surface r  2m in the future and an OMOTS- surface r  2m in the
past It is static and hence is eternal
2 Domain II The vacuum spacetime inside the event horizon It is a spa-
tially homogeneous but time evolving part of a Schwarzschild solution It
is comprised of closed trapped surfaces which imply existence of the fu-
ture spatial singularity that bounds Domain II to the future It is bounded
in the past by two OMOTS surfaces r  2m
3 Domain III A mirror image of Domain I with the innite boundaries
on the left rather than the right It is again static
4 Domain IV A mirror image of Domain II but with the direction of time
reversed It is comprised of time reversed closed trapped surfaces which
imply existence of the spatial singularity that bounds Domain IV to the
past It is again dynamic

The boundaries between the domains are
 B12 Between I and II the event horizon given by rH  2m which is a
Killing horizon and the locus of a family of SM OT S 2-spheres ie each
2-sphere in the event horizon is a SM OT S with   0 Thus it is an
OMOTS surface Objects inside rH are trapped because r  rH is a
null surface Thus it is an EMOTS surface The event horizon hides
events in the interior from the exterior domain I
 B23 Between II and III the mirror-symmetric event horizon again given
by rH  2m which hides the interior from the exterior domain III
 B34 Between III and IV a time-symmetric version of B23 Thus it is an
EMOTS- surface
 B41 Between IV and I a time symmetric version of B12 Thus it is an
OMOTS- surface
The inmost trapped 2-surface IM OT S is the 2-sphere at the join of domains I
II III and IV This is a bifurcate Killing horizon 4 The area of the surfaces
r  2m is in each case constant along the outgoing null geodesics for all  be-
cause equation 3 is satised with   0 ij ij  0 Rabkakb  0
Figure 1 shows the sign of the outgoing null geodesic expansion  in each do-
main and so how the MOTS surfaces mark the changes in sign in this expansion
34 Symmetries
The solution has many symmetries which will play a key role in what follows
341 Left-Right symmetry
There is a left-right symmetry in the solution change the obvious conformal
coordinates t x in the gure centred on the IM OT S 2-sphere to tx and
the solution is invariant Therefore Regions I and III are identical but with
the spatial direction reversed while Regions II and IV are individually spatially
symmetric
342 Direction of time symmetry
There is a time symmetry in the solution change the conformal coordinates
t x to t x and the solution is invariant Therefore Regions I and III are
individually time symmetric while Regions II and IV are symmetric to each
other but with the time direction reversed
 1  Figure 2 Primordial Black Hole symmetry group   III  FIGURE 2 Primordial black hole symmetries There are discrete symmetries the arrow of time and left to right  The continuous symmetry group orbits diverge at the SMOTS 2-surface the bifurcate Killing horizon Physically P is identical to Q and R is identical to S   II I P OMOTS  Event Horizon IV Q R S OMOTS- EMOTS- IMOTS EMOTS  Left-Right symmetry Future-Past  symmetry Group orbits I 343 Boost group symmetry
The solution is invariant under the Lorentz boost group with the IM OT S 2-
sphere the set of xed points 4 The surfaces of constant r are the orbits
of this group timelike in Domains I and III hence static there spacelike in
Domains II and IV hence spatially homogeneous there null on the surfaces
r  2m
Consequently events P and Q are equivalent in all respects because the
symmetry group moves them into each other No physical feature can distin-
guish them The same is true of events R and S It is noteworthy that the
Killing orbits bifurcate at the IM OT S 2-sphere hence events Q and that are
close to each other but on opposite side s of the horizon 4r  2m are related
by the group symmetry to the very distant points P S respectively This is the
divergence that underlies key aspects of the behaviour we discuss below
35 Outcomes
A spacelike singularity occurs both in the future and past as r  0 The Weyl
tensor diverges there the Ricci tensor is zero Specically the Kretschman
scalar is
K  CabcdC abcd  
where   48G2c4 22 so this diverges as r  0 It is the spatial inhomogene-
ity of the solution that generates this singularity in the conformal structure of
spacetime
As seen from the outside the mass of the star never alters it is always equal
to the initial value m0
m  m0  const
This will of course not be the same if matter falls into the blackhole hereby
increasing it is mass then the horizon is a dynamic horizon 1 and the laws
of black hole thermodynamics 2 come into play to characterise the resulting
changes However we do not consider those processes here
4 Semiclassical gravity The standard View
This is all altered when one takes quantum eld theory into account so that
Hawking radiation results in mass loss and 11 is no longer true
Three new eects come into play and dramatically alter the picture Figure 3
The eects are
Item 1 Quantum eld theory uctuations leads to production of black body
Hawking radiation at the event horizon 16 3 2143 with temperature
 1  Figure 3 Evaporating Primordial Black Hole  Radiation flash    Future Infinity    Past Infinity    I  0 I II  0  IV  0  III 0  I  0 IMOTS   FIGURE 3 Negative density Hawking radiation from the event horizon flows in and reduces the mass of the singularity compensating positive density Hawking radiation flows out and records this mass loss at infinity The entire mass evaporates away An observer on a timelike world line Blue will see all the mass of the star radiated away in a flash in a small intervalof time the redshift is finite on this line  Event Horizon    Evaporation Event     Future Singularity    Past Singularity    determined by the mass of the central body
This result has been calculated in many ways and is independent of the grav-
itational eld equations 33
In order to conserve energy outgoing positive
density Hawking radiation emitted just outside the event horizon is balanced
by negative density ingoing Hawking radiation This outgoing positive density
black body radiation escapes to innity Consequently in thermodynamic terms
the black hole acts as a black body with temperature TBH given by 12 and
entropy
SBH  4m2 
This latter result is dependent on the gravitational eld equations 33
Item 2 Because radiation is being emitted energy conservation shows there
must be a corresponding mass loss by the black hole
dmd  0
where  is give by 8 in the outer domain so m decreases with  and therefore
TBH increases as the radiation process continues One can think of the outcome
as like a Schwarzschild solution with ever decreasing mass m 
Item 3 The singularity that has formed at the centre eventually pops
out of existence 17 3 21 because the Hawking process inevitably carries
all the mass away to innity This happens in a nite time because as the
mass decreases the radiation loss process speeds up The power P radiated is
proportional to 1m2 using the usual mass-energy equivalence
P  c2dmd
the evaporation time tevap is proportional to m3
numbers this lifetime will be of the order
0 18 26 Putting in the
tevap cid39 1071mmcid123secs
The crucial new feature is that the eect of the Hawking radiation is to even-
tually make both the central mass and singularity vanish in a nite time The
result is that the outer domain eventually loses the event horizon and again has
a regular centre
5 The Paradox
The key point is that the exterior domain is static Any time that evaporation
starts and vaporizes the mass it should have started earlier because there is
an innite preceding time when the process can take place When ever it gets
completed it should have happened before
In detail Given that the evaporation process takes a nite time evapm0
determined by the initial mass m whenever the evaporation ends say time
f inal it must have started at time 1  f inal  evapm0 when the radiation
achieve some threshold value we regard as the starting value of the process But
conditions then were identical to an even earlier time 2  1  evapm0 So it
should have evaporated away by time 1 rather than starting at time 1 This
argument repeats whatever time is supposed to be the end time the process
should have ended already before it started There is no nite time at which it
can start Hence there is no determinate time when it can end
The argument can be made more formal in terms of Cauchy surfaces as
mentioned in Pages formulation of the Evaporation Hypothesis Section 1
The situation is shown in Figure 4
Consider a star of mass m  msun and a timelike Killing vector orbit
r  c0  2m in Domain I as shown Dene   8895 m3 Let the event
R on the world line W be dened by rW  c0  2m1     0  cid28 1
Then W is close to the event horizon Let the event S also be on the world line
W  but a proper time  in the past from R along W as given by 8
Consider rst a Cauchy Surface CS1 that starts at spatial innity i0I goes
through the event R on the world line W in Domain I then through the central
IM OT S surface then through the event Q on the mirror world line r  c0 in
Domain III and ends at spatial innity i0III
Consider a second Cauchy Surface CS2 that is determined from CS1 by an
action of the boost symmetry group discussed in Section 343 with the group
element chosen so that CS2 passes through the event S Then CS2 starts at
spatial innity i0I goes through the event S on the worldline W in Domain I
then through the central IM OT S surface the xed surface of the group then
through the event Q on the other surface r  c0 in Domain III and ends at
spatial innity i0III The form of the surface is because i0I IM OT S and
i0III are xed points of the group and it acts downwards in Domain I but
upwards in Domain III
If we set initial data as specied in the Evaporation Hypothesis Section 1
on the Cauchy Surface CS1 the black hole will evaporate a time  in the
future of R as measured along the world line W  But there is nothing special
about this Cauchy surface its choice was arbitrary We could have set the same
data on the physically identical Cauchy surface CS2 through the event S Then
the black hole would have evaporated by the time of event R And so on we
could have set data in an even earlier Cauchy surface CS3 so that the black
should have evaporated before CS2Whatever Cauchy surface we choose there
 1  Figure 4 Primordial Black Hole Cauchy surface  III  FIGURE 4 Primordial black hole Cauchy surface   II I Q IV R S Cauchy Surfaces P i0 III i0 I IMOTS Surface r  c0 Surface r  c0 is an earlier one such that the black hole will be gone before we set that data
Continuing back in time given the eternity allowed between the event S and
the start of the spacetime at    the black hole must have evaporated
before any nite time which we can consider to be the start of the Hawking
evaporation process which is claimed to happen in a nite time
Thus we have deduced
The Hawking Radiation Paradox
the emission and evapo-
ration picture is inconsistent with the symmetry of the extended
Schwarzschild solution
The inconsistency is quite independent of the details of the process it only
hinges on the claim that the process ends a nite time after a chosen starting
time together with the static nature of the maximal Kruskal-Schwarzschild
solution exterior Domain I
6 Elements of a resolution
The basic issue is where Hawking radiation emission takes place and hence
where it goes to
One can calculate the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum
tensor of the relevant eld This has been done in the case of a two-dimensional
model of the collapse of a shell of matter by Davies Fulling and Unruh 7
They nd
The ux of energy is given by two components Near innity it
is dominated by an outward null ux of energy Near the horizon
however it is a ux of negative energy going into the horizon of the
black hole 
Thus we can think of there being an emission domain just outside the horizon
which emits positive energy radiation going outwards and negative radiation
going inwards
But the issue is where does this process takes place which horizon is it
61 The basic argument
Figure 4 gives the outlines of argument that proposes a resolution The key
point was made in section 343 because of the boost symmetry group condi-
tions at Q and R are identical also conditions at P and Q are identical
Now it is usually supposed that Hawking radiation is emitted just outside
the event horizon that is at a point like R But conditions at this point just
outside the OMOTS are physically identical to conditions at point S just
 1  Figure 5 Primordial Black Hole emission locations   III  FIGURE 5 Primordial black hole emission locations R is identical to S and P is identical to Q   II I P OMOTS Event Horizon IV Q R S OMOTS- EMOTS- EMOTS  outside the OMOTS- by this symmetry group However considering a small
neighbourhood of S we do not expect radiation for here because it is close to
an anti-trapping surface an OMOTS- rather than being close to a trapping
surface But as conditions here are identical to those close to R we should not
expect radiation from close to R The latter cannot radiate because the former
does not it is outside a non-trapping surface
By contrast consider the point Q just inside the EMOTS surface Its
physical conditions are identical to those at the P point just inside the OMOTS
surface Conditions at P are conducive to emission of Hawking radiation cf
the discussion below thus the domain near Q can radiate because the its con-
ditions are identical to those at P  We can expect radiation from near P and
Q rather than from near R and S
In summary
 Domains just outside the OMOTS surface are also just outside the
OMOTS- surface and so should not radiate
 Domains just outside the EMOTS surface are also just inside the
OMOTS surface and are the ones that radiate
If this is so the locus of radiation emission is Domain II rather than Domain I
That means both ingoing and outgoing Hawking radiation ends up at the future
singularity rather than at innity Hence just as claimed in 12 for the case
of astrophysical black holes the black hole mass will not radiate away This
resolves the paradox there is no special time for the start of the evaporation
process because it never takes place
Developing this into a full revised view has three elements taking into ac-
count backreaction eects Section 62 reconsidering the locus of radiation
emission Section 63 and breaking the degeneracies of the solution by imbed-
ding it in a cosmological context Section 64 These will only be briey consid-
ered here because all these issues are discussed in depth in 12 The argument
is a straightforward generalisation of what is presented there
62 Back reaction eects
The eect of the Hawking radiation is to displace both the OMOTS and the
EMOTS trapping surfaces
621 The OMOTS Surface
Because of the null Raychaudhuri equation 3 the outgoing positive density
Hawking radiation causes focussing of null geodesics so any outgoing null
geodesics that start at an initial ane parameter 1 at a SM OT S 2-surface
where   0 will converge to a conjugate point at nite ane parameter value
2  1 Hence a marginally trapped SM OT S1 in the OMOTS 3-surface will
be mapped by the outgoing null geodesics to trapped 2-spheres SCT S with
  0 for 1    2 These 2-spheres whose future necessarily ends on
a singularity because they are trapped will therefore lie inside the OMOTS
surface hence the OMOTS surface has moved out relative to the null geodesics
through SM OT S1
Consequently the eect of the radiation is to change the OMOTS 3-surface
from null to spacelike It now lies outside the initial null surface r  2m gen-
erated by the geodesics through the IM OT S 2-sphere
It bounds the domain
of trapped surfaces and so it bounds the events whose future ends up at the
singularity Thus the OMOTS in fact denes the extent of the future singularity
The further important consequence is that the event horizon is no longer
where it used to be
It used to be generated by the outgoing null geodesics
starting at the IMOTS 2-sphere where r  2m and reaching the future singu-
larity at the point P1 That initial null surface is now trapped
In summary the eect of the radiation is to change the OMOTS 3-surface
from being a null surface that coincides with the event horizon to being a
spacelike surface that
1 lies outside the initial null surface
2 determines the extent of the future spacelike singularity and
3 thus determines the location of the event horizon
622 The EMOTS surface
In a dual interaction the ingoing negative density Hawking radiation defocuses
outgoing null geodesics and so lifts the EMOTS surface o the null surface
r  2m and makes it timelike lying inside Domain II Details are in 12
63 The Emission region
The central issue that determines the outcome is Where is the outgoing radia-
tion emitted
The usual proposal eg
26 is that it is emitted just outside the globally
determined event horizon However there is a counter view 15 28 33 25
5 29 27 that it is rather emitted just outside a locally determined MOTS
surface
In that case this would radiation emission not occur if the MOTS
surface were spacelike
 If we use the tunneling description 28 the MOTS must be timelike else
there is no surface to tunnel through The very concept of tunneling
depends on the implicit assumption that the trapping surface causing the
emission must be timelike so that two sides inside and outside can
be dened
 The concept of scattering involved in use of Bogoliubov transformations
29 assumes scattering is o a timelike world tube
Hence for the Hawking radiation emission to occur the trapping surface must
be a timelike MOTS as in the following Table

Table 2 Outgoing null geodesic divergences according to domain
This leads to the alternative view proposed in 11
Main Hypothesis The source of outgoing Hawking radiation
is neither near the event horizon nor outside the spacelike outer
trapping OMOTS surface surface
its location is outside the in-
ner EMOTS timelike trapping surface and hence the inside the
trapping domain
The consequence is that in agreement with the argument above Section 61
the domain of emission is Domain II rather than Domain I Most of the radiation
is trapped and does not get to innity
64 Breaking the symmetries
However there remains a double symmetry paradox
641 The spatial paradox
In the above it was assumed we had a good denition of in and out But
because of the spatial symmetry discussed in Section 341 this is completely
ambiguous see Figure 5
Looking at the geometry as relates to P or Q it seems quite clear what is
in and what is out But this is an illusion Both points are physically fully
equivalent to S where the distinction is fully ambiguous How does the physics
know which is the in direction where the negative density Hawking radiation
should go and which is the out direction where the positive density Hawking
radiation should go
Given the ambiguity does Hawking radiation obey this symmetry and send
positive and negative energy density radiation equally to the left and the right
 1  Figure 6 Primordial Black Hole left-right symmetry  III  FIGURE 6 Primordial black hole symmetries The radiation does not know which direction is in and which direction is out because the solution is left-right symmetric   II I IV Q Left-Right symmetry P S if this is the case the outcome will be dierent than usually envisaged If not
why not Is one direction chosen randomly by some quantum event If so why
is the direction the same everywhere
A resolution can be obtained as in 12 introducing a cosmological context
imbedding Domain I but not Domain II in an expanding universe 13 31
will break the symmetry and determine what is in and what is out The incoming
CMB radiation eectively emitted at a nite innity surrounding the black hole
9 10 will then reinforce the eect of Hawking radiation on the OMOTS
surface discussed in Section 62
642 The time paradox
There is an equal issue as regards the time symmetry of the solution described
in Section 342 How does the radiation know which is the future and which is
the past
As in 12 introducing a cosmological context will also break this symmetry
It denes what is the future and what is the past 11
65 The Outcome
We now have all the pieces needed to determine where Hawking radiation emis-
sion takes place in a maximal Kruskal-Schwarzschild blackhole setting The
broad nature of the resulting spacetime is shown in Figure 6 indicating the sign
of the outgoing null geodesic expansion  The changes in sign of  determine
the location of the MOTS surfaces and hence characterises where radiation will
be emitted An immediate consequence is
Conclusion Most of the Hawking radiation emitted does not end
up at innity it ends up on the future singularity Consequently the
singularity does not evaporate away because of outgoing Hawking
radiation that radiation mainly ends up on the singularity and so
does not carry mass or energy away to the exterior
This in full accord with the analysis of the previous sections However it
must be emphasized that the analysis of this section is based on the particle
tunneling model of Parikh and Wilczek 28 Paul Davies emphasizes one needs
to calculate the stress tensor of the radiation 6 7 to conrm the result
This is still to be done Clifton 5 has shown there is no problem in calculating
the stress tensor in the case of emission by a local trapping surface rather than
a global event horizon However the arguments of the previous sections are
independent of any specic emission mechanism and give strong support to the
picture presented here

Implications
This viewpoint has obvious implications for the current debates on the informa-
tion loss paradox
Is there information loss 18 19 24 14 Yes indeed 21 59 63
Gravity is a non-linear theory with spacetime singularities information falling
into them is inevitably lost Any matter or information falling in through the
event horizon disappears into the permanent spacelike singularity which does
not go away and can act as a sink for an arbitrary number of microstates As
no radiation is emitted outwards from the singularity to innity because it is
spacelike no information can be carried out of the black hole from the singu-
larity by any such radiation Because there is a permanent relic just as in the
case Maldacena and Horowitz 23 there is no information loss paradox
Conclusion Infalling matter and information falls into the singularity and
is destroyed there It cannot be re-emitted by Hawking radiation from there
as no Hawking radiation from there reaches innity Microstates are swallowed
up by the singularity From the outside the black hole acts as an absorbing
element so scattering o it should not be expected to be unitary energy will
not be conserved at the event horizon Additionally the astrophysical context
indicated here specically the presence of the CMB radiation causes rapid
decoherence so entanglement across the horizon 24 is rapidly lost 32 and
associated problems will therefore dematerialize But in any case entanglement
is across the EMOTS surface not the event horizon Hence the particles can
remain entangled in a unitary way until they hit the future singularity
If the account presented in this paper is correct eternal black holes do not
evaporate away and this will also apply also to the case of astrophysical black
holes because the evaporation mechanism is the same even though the context
is dierent Thus this paper supports the arguments in 12 What these discus-
sion show is that if any of the Hawking radiation falls into the singularity it is
unlikely that it can then evaporate away and then the broad picture presented
here will be correct And even if one changes many details it is unlikely that
all the Hawking radiation can avoid a singular fate of this kind Then the main
result will be vindicated
