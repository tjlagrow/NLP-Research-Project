The K Band Luminosity Function

Abstract
K band observations of the galaxy populations of three high redshift z  0810 X-ray
selected massive clusters are presented The observations reach a depth of K  215 cor-
responding to K   35 mag The evolution of the galaxy properties are discussed in terms
of their K band luminosity functions and the K band Hubble diagram of brightest cluster
galaxies
The bulk of the galaxies as characterised by the parameter K  from the Schechter 1976
function are found to be consistent with passive evolution with a redshift of formation of
z f  152 This is in agreement with observations of other high redshift clusters but in
disagreement with eld galaxies at similar redshifts The shape of the luminosity function
at high redshift after correcting for passive evolution is not signicantly different from that
of the Coma cluster again consistent with passive evolution
Introduction
We present a study of three of the most massive  1015M high redshift clusters
known Maughan et al 2003a Maughan et al 2003b They are thus ideal probes of
galaxy evolution
In a hierarchical model galaxies are predicted to rst form in regions
with the highest overdensities which merge over time with other systems to become massive
clusters Thus such massive clusters at high redshift are relatively rare and we have an
unusual opportunity to study the galaxy populations of rich distant clusters and compare
results with local rich clusters such as Coma The high redshift of the clusters should make
any evolution in the galaxy populations easier to observe
The evolution is probed by means of their K band galaxy luminosity functions The K
band magnitude of a galaxy is a good indicator of the stellar mass of the galaxy being rel-
atively insensitive to star formation and furthermore k-corrections are small in this band
Thus the evolution of the K band luminosity function parametrized by K  of the Schechter
1976 function traces the epoch of assembly of the galaxies In the monolithic collapse pic-
ture of structure formation all galaxies were formed at high redshift and have evolved only
passively since with galaxies at high redshift being intrinsically brighter than their present
day counterparts due to their younger stellar populations In the hierarchical formation pic-
ture the number of bright galaxies will grow with time through a series of mergers and thus
the shape of the luminosity function will be altered with the passing of time

The X-ray data for the clusters show that two of the clusters appear relaxed ClJ1226 z 
089 and ClJ1415 z  103 with relaxed X-ray contours Maughan et al 2003b Ebeling et
al 2001 and one of them ClJ0152 z  083 appears to be in a state of merging Maughan et
al 2003a Ebeling et al 2000 thus we also have a small selection of different environments
The cluster X-ray properties are consistent with little or no evolution when compared to
local clusters Jones et al 2003 these proceedings All three clusters were discovered in
the Wide Angle ROSAT Pointed Survey WARPS Scharf et al 1997
Results
The luminosity functions of all three clusters are shown in the rst three panels
of gure 11 Also shown are the best tting Schechter functions with  held constant
at   - 09 Schechter functions were t with the brightest cluster galaxies included and
excluded The results for all clusters are given in tables 11 and 12
The combined luminosity function excluding BCGs for our 3 high redshift clusters is
shown in the bottom right panel of gure 11 This was t with  as a free parameter yielding
a value of   - 054  03 Also shown by the open squares is the K band luminosity
function for the Coma cluster computed from the H band luminosity function of de Propris
et al 1998 using their given value of H - K  022 The shapes of the luminosity functions
are very similar and the difference in absolute magnitude can be accounted for by a passively
evolving population with zf  2 as shown by the dashed line
A Schechter function was also t to the combined luminosity function including BCGs
Fits were made with   - 09 and with  free The results for all ts are given in tables 11
and 12
The evolution of K  is shown in gure 12 along with the high LX data from de Propris et
al 1999 Models were computed for no-evolution and passively evolving stellar popula-
tions with redshifts of formation zf  15 2 and 5 It can be seen that the bulk of the galaxies
were signicantly brighter in the past than no-evolution predictions This is consistent with
a passively evolving population with zf  152
Conclusions
The evolution of the galaxy populations of three high redshift clusters of galaxies
has been studied The bulk evolution of the galaxies as characterised by K  is found to be
consistent with passive evolution with a redshift of formation zf  152 Further evidence

for passive evolution is seen in the similarity of the shape of the high-redshift luminosity
function with that of Coma
Purely passive evolution of early-type galaxies is consistent with several other studies
including the evolution of the K band luminosity function de Propris et al 1999 evolution
of mass-light ratios van Dokkum et al 1998 and studies of the scatter of the colour-
magnitude relation see eg Ellis et al 1997 Stanford et al 1998
The lack of evolution observed in K band luminosity function is in contrast to the con-
clusions of Kauffmann and Charlot 1998 and Kauffmann et al 1996 for galaxies in the
eld

When discussing formation it is important to distinguish between the epoch at which
the stars in the galaxies were formed and the epoch at which the galaxies were assembled
If merging were a dissipationless process then it would be possible to have no extra star
formation as a result of a merger and thus the age of the stars within a galaxy could be older
than the age of galaxy assembly A study of the cluster of galaxies MS 1054-03 at z  083 is
presented by van Dokkum et al 1999 in which there is observed a high fraction of merging
red galaxies Very little star formation is seen in the merging galaxies constituting evidence
that the galaxies are in fact somewhat younger than the stars that reside within them
Is such merging reected in the evolution of the luminosity function The K band lumi-
nosity of a galaxy is very nearly independent of star-formation but reects the mass of the
old stars within the galaxy Thus K magnitudes are a good measure of the stellar mass of a
galaxy It is expected from semi-analytic models Kauffmann et al 1993 Baugh et al 1996
that the typical redshift of assembly of an elliptical will be higher in a rich cluster than in
the eld due to the fact that structures collapse earlier in denser environments This will
be particularly relevant here since the systems investigated here are all very massive The
semi-analytic models of Diaferio et al 2001 predict very little evolution in the numbers of
massive cluster galaxies since z  08 in a hierarchical model with dissipationless merging
A high redshift of assembly of massive galaxies is in qualitative agreement with our results
We conclude that the luminosity evolution of bright galaxies in massive clusters is consistent
with pure passive evolution but note that this may be consistent with hierarchical models if
most merging takes place at high redshifts
