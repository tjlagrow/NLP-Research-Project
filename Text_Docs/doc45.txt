We propose the use of a superconducting transmission line formed from an array of dc-SQUIDs
for investigating analogue Hawking radiation Biasing the array with a space-time varying ux
modies the propagation velocity of the transmission line leading to an eective metric with an
horizon Being a fundamentally quantum mechanical device this setup allows for investigations of
quantum eects such as back-reaction and analogue space-time uctuations on the Hawking process

Introduction The possibility of observing Hawking
radiation 1 in a condensed matter system was rst sug-
gested by Unruh who uncovered the analogy between
sound waves in a uid and a scalar eld in curved space-
time 2
In particular the uid equations of motion
can formally be expressed in terms of an eective met-
ric matching that of a gravitating spherical non-rotating
massive body in Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates 3

where cs is the speed of sound and vr is the spa-
tially varying velocity of the uid For a sound wave

of surmounting the uid ow Since Unruhs original
proposal Hawking radiation analogues have been pro-
posed using Bose-Einstein condensates 4 liquid Helium
5 electromagnetic transmission lines 6 and ber-optic
setups 7 Estimated Hawking temperatures in these
systems vary from a few nano-Kelvin to 103K respec-
tively far above temperatures predicted for astronomical
black holes and thus usher in the possibility of experi-
mental observation Additionally the understanding of
the physics associated with laboratory system analogues
may provide clues as to resolving unanswered questions
associated with Hawkings original calculation such as
the trans-Planckian problem 8
In this letter we propose using a metamaterial formed
from an array of direct-current superconducting quan-
tum interference devices dc-SQUIDs Modulation of
the propagation velocity necessary for the formation of
an horizon is accomplished through application of an ex-
ternal ux bias through the SQUID loops as indicated in
Fig 1a Under appropriate conditions this congura-
tion provides the superconducting realization of Ref 6
with the benet of available fabrication methods Indeed
arrays of SQUIDs with parameters near those required
to observe the Hawking eect have already been con-
structed 9 10 Furthermore as a quantum device the
SQUID array goes beyond the capabilities of previously
proposed systems allowing the possibility to probe the
eect on Hawking radiation of quantum uctuations in
FIG 1 a Layout of the dc-SQUID transmission line We
assume each SQUID element is formed from identical tunnel
junctions with critical current Ic and capacitance CJ  b Ef-
fective lumped circuit model valid for frequencies below the
plasma frequency and negligible SQUID self-inductance

ables the exploration of analogue quantum gravitational
eects
Model We consider a coplanar transmission line
composed of a centerline conductor formed by a long
N  1 series array of dc-SQUIDs indicated in Fig 1a
For simplicity we assume that all Josephson junctions
JJ have identical critical current Ic and capacitance

representing the gauge invariant phases across the JJs

inductance L  2LIc0 The parallel normal current
resistance of the junction is denoted RN  while 0  h2e
is the ux quantum and ext is the external ux through
the SQUID loop If L  1 then the SQUID dynamics
can be approximated by a JJ with a ux-tunable critical

can be written

temperature is well below the superconducting critical
temperature and where the eective plasma frequency
is given by s
c 2CJ 0 We will assume the
validity of this approximation and consider a ux-tunable
array of Josephson Junctions JJA If we additionally
restrict ourselves to frequencies well below the plasma
frequency and currents below the critical current then
a JJ behaves as a passive ux and current dependent
inductance given by

uum speed of light c0 In this limit the wave equation

By ignoring higher-order terms in Eq 7 we eectively
remove the discreteness of the array which along with
dispersion from JJ inertia terms can play the role of
Planck scale physics in our system 7 8 12 For param-
eter values considered below the relevant short distance

given in Fig 1b where we have labeled the length and

tively Using Kirchos laws we can write the discrete

From 4 we see that by controlling the external ux
bias or by creating a varying current in the transmis-
sion line we are able to modify the inductance and thus
propagation velocity inside the transmission line Here
we focus on using the ux degree of freedom as our tun-
able parameter Creating a space-time varying current
pulse as in Ref 7 can also be accomplished in our de-
vice However our simplied model does not admit the
correct dispersion relation to support the required sta-
ble nonlinear solitonic localized pulses in the parameter
region of interest Charge solitons can however be pro-
duced in the high impedance regime of our device 11

Comparing this metric with Eq 1 we see that our sys-
tem contains a horizon located wherever u2  c2x In
Fig 2 we plot the eect of a step-like hyperbolic tangent
ux bias pulse of amplitude ext  020 on a JJA with
inductances given by Eq 4 where we have kept only the
lowest term in the IcI s
c expansion Additionally since
ext can only increase the inductance the ux-bias pulse
velocity u must be below the unbiased transmission line
propagation velocity c in order to establish a horizon We
do not consider Gaussian or similar pulse shapes as they
generate both black hole and white hole horizons 13
which complicates interpretation of the emission process
So far we have focused on demonstrating a classical ef-
fective background geometry with an event horizon The
next step is to quantize small perturbations in the po-
tential eld A about this background The correct com-
mutation relations between quantum eld operators are
required for conversion of vacuum uctuations into pho-
tons 14 These relations have been veried in the sys-
tems to which ours is analogous 6 The resulting Hawk-
ing temperature is determined by the gradient of the JJA
velocity at the horizon

where the last equality explicitly shows the dependence
on the external ux bias and single junction parameters
Thus even for a small energy ratio EC EJ  the lumped

a range of experimentally valid capacitances to ground

uctuations indicating a breakdown of our semiclassi-
cal description the array undergoes a quantum phase
transition from superconducting to insulating Coulomb
blockade behavior 19 Note the small JJ parameter
variability in actual arrays 9 10 19 will prevent the di-
vergence in Fig 3 as well as cause some transmission line
scattering in the low impedance superconducting state
The dependence of the Josephson energy EJ on exter-
nal ux ext as described above allows for the systematic
introduction of quantum uctuations in our model With
the phase variable governing the circuit inductance these
uctuations manifest themselves in the eective metric
11 through the propagation velocity c As the am-
plitude of uctuations increases the metric becomes a
quantum dynamical variable which must be included in
the description of the Hawking process Thus conse-
quences of back-reaction from the Hawking process as
well as quantum dynamical space-time can be probed by

Eq 13 is universal
for bosons since the channel-
dependent group velocity and density of states cancel
each other in one dimension 15 For a detector at the
end of the transmission line the radiation emitted by
an incoming bias pulse will be doppler shifted yielding
higher power compared to Eq 13 However the rate of
emitted photons remains approximately unchanged
Model Validity For a single eective JJ the mag-
nitude of quantum uctuations in the phase variable 
depends on both the ratio of Josephson energy EJ 
c 2 to charging energy EC  e24CJ as well as
on the impedance of the junctions electromagnetic en-
vironment These energy scales give a representation of
the phase-charge uncertainty relation Q  e and re-
late the amplitude of quantum uctuations between these
variables 17 When EJ EC  1 and the impedance
seen by the junction is less than the resistance quantum
RQ  h4e2  645k the phase operator behaves as a
semiclassical quantity ie the  quantum uctuations
are small with respect to its average and the JJ is in the
superconducting state allowing for a lumped inductor
approximation In the majority of experimental cong-
urations a single JJ is connected to probe leads with
impedance  50 and as such is in the low-impedance
regime ZRQ  1 In contrast a JJA has an environ-
ment that comprises not only the input and output ports
but also all the other JJs in the array In this case we
can dene an eective impedance as seen by a single junc-
tion to be ZJ  ZE  ZA where ZE is the environmental
impedance of the leads and ZA is the array impedance
this conguration Both processes not included in the
original Hawking derivation represent analogue quantum
gravitational eects present in our system 20
Experimental Realization A possible realization of
the JJA is shown in Fig 4 which consists of the JJA
transmission line as well as an additional conducting line
producing the space-time varying external ux bias ext
To provide a space-time changing velocity the JJA is
modulated by generating current pulses in the bias-line
the propagation velocity of which are assumed to be
slightly below that of the unbiased JJA The required
bias pulse velocities u can be achieved by similarly em-
ploying individual JJs in series as the bias line Ad-
ditionally a dc-external ux can be used to ne-tune
the transmission line velocity closer to that of the bias-
line eliminating the need for large amplitude current bias
pulses Unavoidable current pulse dispersion in the bias-
line resulting in a decrease in Hawking temperature can
be minimized with appropriate choice of pulse shape and
transmission line length

FIG 4 Possible transmission line and detector realization
Current pulses in the bias-line provide external ux necessary
to modify the SQUID array propagation velocity A phase-
qubit at the end of the JJA functions as the photon detector
Unambiguous verication of the Hawking process will
require frequency-tunable single-shot photon detection
at the end of the JJA opposite to that of the bias pulse
origin Although not presently available microwave
single-photon detectors based on superconducting qubits
are under active investigation 21 22 We will assume
a phase-qubit as our model detector 21 By repeat-
edly injecting current pulses down the bias-line the pre-
dicted blackbody spectrum associated with the Hawk-
ing process can be probed by tuning the qubit resonant
frequency Correlations across the horizon between the
emitted photon pairs can be established through coin-
cidence detection We emphasize the essential need for
correlation information in order to establish that a pho-
ton is produced by the Hawking eect rather than some
other ambient emission process or spuriously generated
via capacitive coupling to the bias-line Unwanted direc-
tional coupling can be minimized with proper engineering
of the transmission line
To estimate the Hawking temperature we will assume
parameters similar to those of Ref 9 with SQUIDs
composed of tunnel junctions with Ic  2 A and an
upper bound achievable plasma frequency p  2 
1012 Hz The capacitance to ground is assumed to be
C0  5 1017 F dashed line in Fig 3 Using a SQUID
length a  025 m gives an unbiased transmission line
velocity c  c0100 Equation 12 gives the temperature
as determined by the rate at which the JJA transmission
line velocity varies that in our case is limited by the
plasma frequency s
p Assuming the maximum rate is
an order of magnitude below s
p ext  0 2 then the
Hawking temperature is  120 mK This temperature
can be a factor of ten larger than the ambient tempera-
ture set by a dilution refrigerator and therefore should be
visible above the background thermal spectrum Using
Eq 13 and the sample pulse in Fig 2 gives an initial
Hawking temperature 120 mK which decreases  10
every 1000 JJA elements due to bias-line dispersion Ap-
plying the power expression 13 yields an average emis-
sion rate of one photon per pulse for  4800 SQUIDs
Of course the transmission line can be made consider-
ably shorter at the expense of an increase in number of
pulse repetitions in order to accumulate sucient photon
counts to verify the Hawking radiation The parameters
and pulse shapes chosen here illustrate feasibility of this
setup but do not represent the only available congu-
ration These values can likely be improved upon and
optimized in terms of both performance and fabrication
of this proposal
Conclusion We have demonstrated that an array
of dc-SQUIDs in a coplanar transmission line when bi-
ased by a space-time dependent ux creates an eective
space-time metric with a horizon As a quantum device
the superconducting transmission line allows for the pos-
sibility of observing not only the Hawking eect but also
the eects of quantum uctuations in an analogue grav-
itational system
