ABSTRACT
Context We study galaxy evolution and spatial patterns in the surroundings of a sample of 2dF groups
Aims Our aim is to nd evidence of galaxy evolution and clustering out to 10 times the virial radius of the groups and so redene
their properties according to the spatial patterns in the elds and relate them to galaxy evolution
Methods Group members and interlopers were redened after the identication of gaps in the redshift distribution We then used
exploratory spatial statistics based on the the second moment of the Ripley function to probe the anisotropy in the galaxy distribution
around the groups
Results We found an important anticorrelation between anisotropy around groups and the fraction of early-type galaxies in these
elds Our results illustrate how the dynamical state of galaxy groups can be ascertained by the systematic study of their neigh-
borhoods This is an important achievement since the correct estimate of the extent to which galaxies are aected by the group
environment and follow large-scale lamentary structure is relevant to understanding the process of galaxy clustering and evolution
in the Universe
Key words Galaxies evolution  Galaxies interactions  Galaxies clusters general
1 Introduction
Small groups of galaxies contain about half of all galaxies in the
Universe eg Huchra  Geller 1982 Geller  Huchra 1983
Nolthenius  White 1987 Ramella et al 1989 They repre-
sent the link between galaxies and large-scale structures and
have at least two important features galaxies inside groups in-
teract more with each other than they do in the eld and groups
have small crossing times generally  01 H1
0  indicating that
they are dynamical units that are possibly in virial equilibrium
However the dynamical state of a galaxy group is not easy to
determine Group environments are unstable the systems still
may be separating from the cosmic expansion collapsing ac-
creting new members or merging with other groups to produce
larger objects Generally the estimated properties of these sys-
tems are based on the assumption that groups of galaxies dened
by friends-of-friends algorithm and other clustering methods
are gravitationally bound objects This is not completely true
since projection eects can dominate the statistics of these sys-
tems eg Diaferio et al 1993 In a CDM cosmology Niemi
et al 2007 showed that about 20 of nearby groups are not
bound but merely visual objects There is no methodology for
determining the dynamical status of galaxy groups An inter-

esting attempt at describing group evolution is the fundamen-
tal track diagram a plane that follows the evolution of isolated
galaxy systems in an expanding Universe see Mamon 1993
The plane is dened by the dimensionless crossing time and the
dimensionless mass bias This diagram however suers from
degeneracies between the expansion and early collapse phases
and also between the full collapse and rebound phases Although
most groups lie close to the fundamental track there is a large
scatter and the result is inconclusive Mamon 2007 Giuricin et
al 1988 applied a correction factor to the virial mass and as-
sumed a specic model for the system evolution but the model
only accounted for internal gravitational forces and neglected
tidal interactions with the neighborhoods Galaxy groups how-
ever interact signicantly with their surroundings For instance
the shapes and galaxy ows around these systems are related to
large-scale structures and are relevant to the internal dynamics of
the groups eg Paz et al 2006 Ceccarelli et al 2005 Plionis
et al 2004 Generally one assumes that bound groups reach
a quasi-equilibrium state in which galaxies have isotropic orbits
with random phases This happens after the scattering of galaxies
by each other and by masses outside the group If a group is iso-
lated and remains fairly spherical then its constituent galaxies
are not deected from their radial trajectories until the group has
collapsed to a small fraction of its maximum radius In this case
the collapse is violent and the group rst reaches equilibrium at

200 times the mean cosmic density At the opposite extreme
in which a nascent group is strongly inuenced by surrounding
objects the colapse is gentle and the group attains equilibrium
at lower density constrasts Hence measuring environmental in-
uence over galaxy systems can be a way of accessing their for-
mation history and present dynamical state In the present work
this important point is investigated where we study the surround-
ings of galaxy groups previously selected from 2dF by Tago et
al 2006 Using some tools of spatial statistical analysis we
examine the possible correlation between the anisotropy around
groups and galaxy evolution This relationship may shed some
light on the dynamical state of galaxy groups
This paper is organized as follows in Sect 2 we present
the methodology and data used in this work in Sect 3 we
present our results and explore the relation between anisotropy
and galaxy evolution in Sect 4 we discuss our results
2 Methodology and data
21 Probinganisotropyaroundgroups
For the projected distribution anisotropy can be probed by the
reduced second-order moment measure K of a point pattern
eg Stoyan et al 1995 In this work we estimate K using
the library spatstat see Baddeley 2008 within the R statistical
package The command Kmeasure spatstat executes the fol-
lowing steps
1 A point pattern is assumed
2 A list of all pairs of distinct points in the pattern is produced
3 The vectors that join the rst point to the second point in
each pair are computed
4 These vectors are considered to be a new pattern of points
5 A Gaussian kernel smoother is applied to them
The algorithm approximates the point pattern and its win-
dow with binary pixel images introduces a Gaussian smoothing
kernel and uses the Fast Fourier Transform to form a density
estimate  The calculation takes into account the edge correc-
tion known as the translation correction see Ripley 1977
The density estimate of  is returned in the form of a real-valued
pixel image The K estimator is dened as the expected number
of points lying within a distance rmax of a typical point and with
a displacement vector of orientation in the range   This can
be computed by summing the entries over the relevant region ie
the sector of the disc of radius r centred on the origin with angu-
lar range   Hence we can compute a measure of anisotropy
A as integrals of the form
A  Z rmax
dr 
Note that the second-order moment function K is used to test
the hypothesis that a given planar point pattern is a realization of
a Poisson process Thus the objective is to search for signicant
peaks in the integral given in Eq1 for angular steps     
The uncertainty in the anistropy measurement is computed di-
rectly from the variance in the pixel values in the corresponding
circular sector Of course the choice of  is arbitrary In this
work we assume that   10 based on the following analy-
Consider a controlled sample corresponding to a point pat-
tern given by a Poisson distribution 100 points plus a central
group dened as a Hernquist spheroid Hernquist 1990 An ad-
ditional group is located initially at  4h1 Mpc around an angle

mock elds consisting of Hernquist spheroids plus Poisson back-
ground Lower panel detection of anisotropy using three angular
steps   5 10 and 20 in dotted solid and dashed lines
respectively
of 45 and then around an angle of 135 In Fig 1 we present
both the mock eld and the anisotropy signal as a function of the
angle for the two positions of the second group It is clear from
this gure that the second group produces signicant anisotropy
signal To justify our choice of  we present in Figure 1 lower
panel a reanalysis in the case of the second group at 45 for
  5 10 and 20 For   5 we still detect the peak but
there are now secondary peaks and a more noisy behaviour for
A For   20 the peak is still there but now less signicant
This result suggests that in the limit of a too small value  we
have a noisy anisotropy curve possibly with false peaks while
in the limit of very large  the signal can be completely lost
In this work we set   10 as a condence scanning angle to
probe anisotropy in galalxy elds of our sample

Fig 3 Galaxy distribution around Group 91 per -type division
with central 1 h1 Mpc squares in dashed lines
With the new redshift and velocity limits we apply an al-
gorithm for interloper rejection to dene the nal list of group
members We use the shifting gapper technique Fadda et al
1996 which consists of the application of the gap-technique to
radial bins from the group center We consider a bin size of 042
h1 Mpc 060 Mpc for h  07 or larger to ensure that at least
15 galaxies are selected Galaxies not associated with the main
body of the group are discarded This procedure is repeated until
the number of group members is stable and no further galax-
ies are eliminated as intruders An example of the application
of the shifting gapper procedure is seen in Fig 2 upper panel
The main dierence from the study of Lopes et al 2009 is that
here we consider all galaxies within 10 times the virial radius as
listed in Tago et al 2006 In Lopes et al 2009 the interloper
removal procedure was applied to galaxies within a maximum
radius of 25 h1 Mpc Next we estimate the velocity disper-
sions  and physical radius R200 of each group Finally a
virial analysis is perfomed for mass estimation M200 Further
details regarding the interloper removal and estimation of global
properties  physical radius and mass are found in Lopes et
al 2009

22 The2dFsample
We apply the anisotropy estimator to a sample consisting of 32
galaxy groups previously identied by Tago et al 2006 apply-
ing the friends-of-friends algorithm to data from the 2dFGRS
Colless et al 2001 This subset corresponds to those groups
located in areas of at least 80 redshift coverage out to 10 times
the virial radius roughly estimated from the projected harmonic
mean Group members and interlopers were redened after the
identication of gaps in the redshift distribution according to
the technique described by Lopes et al 2009 Before selecting
group members and rejecting interlopers we rst rene the spec-
troscopic redshift of each group and identify its velocity lim-
its For this purpose we employ the gap-technique described in
Katgert et al 1996 and Olsen et al 2005 to identify gaps
in the redshift distribution A variable gap called density gap
Adami et al 1998 is considered To determine the group red-
shift only galaxies within 050 h1 Mpc are considered Details
about this procedure are found in Lopes et al 2009

23 Descriptionofonegroupsurroundingseld
The methodology presented in Sect 31 is now applied to de-
scribe in detail the anisotropy features of Group 91 plus its
neighborhood This eld is presented in Fig 2 lower panel
where equatorial coordinates were transformed to Cartesian ones
using redshift information for a at universe with m  03 We
can see that the galaxy distribution is clearly anisotropic In Fig
3 we present the same eld but now we identify dierences in
the general behaviour according to the galaxy spectral type de-
ned by Madgwick et al 2002 The  parameter is a measure of
spectral type which corresponds approximately to the following
division
1  E-S0 galaxies   14
2  Sa galaxies 14    11
3  Sb galaxies 11    35
4  Scd galaxies   35
see Madgwick et al 2002 for more details about the spectral
type classication and data division by 
In this work we ascertain whether the anisotropy pattern is
related to the galaxy types in the group  surroundings eld
The anisotropy prole of Group 91 is presented in Fig 4 up-
per panel where we see the overall behavior in the small box
and the behavior per type in colors main box Typically our
elds are so dominated by 1 galaxies  60 in average
that the number of objects in the remaining bins are too small
for comparisons between each other Here we just compare 1
with the other types according to 1  2 1  3  4 and
1 2  3  4 To verify whether the respective proles dier
signicantly from each other we applied a bootstrap hypothesis
test assuming as the null hypothesis that the mean of the dif-
ference in the anisotropy signal between two populations is zero
H0    0 while the alternative hypothesis is   0 A small
p-value makes the null hypothesis appear implausible Obtaining
p can be done using the bootstrap resampling approach In this
work based on 1000 bootstrap sample replications we obtain
for Group 91 12  p0008 134  p0014 and 1234 
p0015 Taking the usual cuto of p  005 5 signicance
level we reject the null hypothesis in all cases and conclude that
1-type galaxies in this case have a distinctive spatial distribu-
tion Additionally determining the group  surroundings shape
by diagonalizing the moments of the inertia tensor as a function
of the radius we nd that there is an elongation jump close to
R200 see Fig 4 lower panel This suggests that the group is
embedded in a highly anisotropic structure
We applied this methodology to the remaining groups of our
sample and found that only 15 of the groups 91139189193
and 250 have a distinctive 1 population However the num-
ber of elds with signicant elongation is quite high To help us
understand that we dene a new quantity the global anisotropy
GA as
MaxA  MedianA

are in red 2 galaxies are in yellow 3 4 galaxies are in green
and 2  3  4 galaxies are in blue The general behaviour is
displayed in the small box Lower panel ratio of eigenvalues q

inertia tensor det Ii j  2M  0 where M is a 22 unit matrix
The vertical dashed line indicates R200
Basically this is a measure of the relative importance of the
anisotropy peak with respect to the entire prole The values
of GA are listed in Table 1 Here we require that a signi-
cant elongation corresponds to GA  2 ie MaxA  2A
 MedianA Following this criterium we have found that 94
of the elds have a high degree of elongation Being more re-
strictive and setting GA3 37 of the systems still have this
aligment prominence In our control sample of 1000 Hernquist
spheroids  Poisson background we found just 12 of alig-
ments by chance Hence we conclude that our sample consists
of a signicant number of group  surroundings predominantly
elongated
3 Anisotropy and galaxy evolution
The intrinsic elongated shape of groups can be a very important
factor when determining their dynamical state eg Tovmassian
 Plionis 2009 In this section we investigate a possible corre-
lation between anisotropy and galaxy evolution for all galaxies
in our sample
31 Characterizinggalaxiesaroundgroups
We use the spectral parameter  to characterize galaxy evolu-
tion around groups We applied the Welchs t-test Welch 1947
also known as the F-test Press Flannery  Teukolsky 1986
which is an adaptation of the Students t-test to the compari-
son of two samples in this case   14 and   14 with
unequal variance This statistic tests the null hypothesis that the
mean of each of the two samples are equal assuming a normally
distributed parent population The test was applied in two ways
i testing the two samples by keeping the divisory line   14
ii testing data iteratively in samples dened by one of the other
quantities MB B  R and distance to the center of the groups
dc In the second case the two data sets are redened for in-
creasing or decreasing values of the quantity so we can nd
the corresponding divisory line ie the rst value in which the
null hypothesis is rejected
We rst probe the distribution of galaxies as a function of
the distances to the center of the groups To illustrate our results
more clearly galaxies were sorted in  and divided into seven
subgroups with the same number of objects In Fig 5 upper
panel we see that low  early type galaxies are more concen-
trated than high  objects We veried a corresponding horizon-
tal line at dcR200  15 where data can be divided into two
statistically distinct groups after a t-test p  178  105 This
expected result is just a manifestation of the morphology-density
radius relation eg Dressler 1980 We also nd that our sam-
ple is dominated by dwarf galaxies MB  20 for 90 of
the sample and that low  galaxies are more luminous than the
remainder see Fig 5 middle panel where a horizontal line at
MB  1855 divides data into two subgroups that are statisti-
cally distinct p  102 107 Finally the distribution of B-R
color indicates two distinct groups at B-R11 p  807105
where low  galaxies are redder than the rest see Fig 5 lower
panel Thus our sample is dominated by dwarfs and low  ob-
jects are more central luminous and redder than the other galax-

Now we wish to study the possible correlation between galaxy
evolution and anisotropy We veried that the fraction of 1
galaxies around groups exhibits a signicant correlation with
GA This result presented in Fig 6 lower panel suggests that a
relation existis between the shape of groups  surroundings and
their star formation rate More anisotropic elds have a lower
fraction of 1 galaxies the F-test presents p  00036 for a lin-
ear t We also divide galaxies into GA quartiles and probe their
distribution with distance to the center This is also presented
in Fig 6 upper panel where we see no signicant dierence
between the GA quartiles with increasing radius The general
behaviour just reproduces the morphology-density radius rela-
The 1 galaxy fraction in the elds is a good indicator of
evolution since the morphology-density relation appears to im-
ply that late become early type galaxies We now present some
additional trends in our data associated to this quantity In Fig
7 we see that f1 is anticorrelated with  p 00066 and N
p28105 That is cold groups evolving in poorer environ-
ments contain a higher fraction of 1 galaxies At the same time

Trying to extend this scenario into a more dynamical work
we consider the behaviour of galaxy groups in the  R200 M200
space see Fig 8 We note that most of the groups settle onto
a tted plane given by M200  0001  3985R200  2792
p121015 for a F-statistic Dividing groups according to
their galactic content ie the fraction of 1 galaxies we can see
a clear dierence in the group distribution on this plane Open
circles denote groups with f1  055 which are distributed
more to the left and bottom of the plane while lled circles rep-
resent groups with f1  055 predominantly located to the right
and top of the plane 055 is the median value for f1 The exis-
tence of a plane in the  R200 M200 space indicates that groups
are suciently evolved for their properties to be well correlated
in this dynamical frame We note however that f1 is related to
entire elds and not only to groups Hence dierent loci on this
plane for low and high f1 elds indicate a relation between the
groups and their surroundings Recall that f1 is also anticorre-
lated with GA another eld not group measurement Hence
a tantalizing view of this result is that we have groups in dier-
ent dynamical states approximately along the diagonal from the
top-right to the bottom-left corners of the tted plane This is not
exactly an evolutionary track but an indicator of how anisotropy
galactic content and dynamics are intimately connected during
the formation of galaxy systems

ized by R200 as a function of  upper panel Absolute magni-
tudes as a function of  middle panel B-R color as a function
of  lower panel Dashed lines divide data into two groups sta-
tistically distinct
f1 is correlated with f200 p00002 groups in which more
galaxies are inside R200 exhibits a higher fraction of 1 galax-
ies Fig 7 Finally f200 is anticorrelated with N p18108
see also in Fig 7 This all means that rich elds harbour
less concentrated galaxy systems with fewer 1 galaxies ie
less evolved groups These elds are also more anisotropic
containing hotter groups which is more consistent with a sce-
nario where galaxies move along the elongation direction as ex-
pected in dynamical young systems that form by anisotropic ac-

4 Discussion
The spatial distribution of galaxies traces the shape of the dark
matter potential in which they are embedded Simulations show
that dark matter halos are not spherical as one would expect
from dark matter dissipationless nature but they are strongly
attened triaxial ellipsoids eg Dubinski  Carlberg 1991
Groups are probably the most suitable objects to use in studying
the shapes of dark matter halos since they connect the general
eld of galaxies and large-scale structure Indeed any correla-
tion between morphological properties of the groups and galaxy
evolution can provide an indication of how matter assembles to
form larger and larger galaxy systems and how the environment
aects galaxy evolution during this process
In this work we have introduced a new method to probe
extended regions around galaxy groups Based on the second
moment of the Ripley function the method allows us to de-
ne an operational anisotropy prole that indicates preferen-
tial directions around the systems We also dene a global
anisotropy GA from the anisotropy prole a quantity that can
be compared to other properties of the groups Galaxies in our
2dF group sample are distributed out to  10RV around the
center of the groups so we have fairly extended samples of
groupsurrounding galaxies We nd that GA is correlated with
the spectral parameter  Madgwick et al 2002 an indicator
of the star formation rate of galaxies Observations indicate that
the lower star formation rate of group galaxies is visible out to
2R200 Balogh et al 1998 while CDM numerical simulations
show that particles that penetrate deep into dark matter halos
travel out to  26R200 Gill Knebe  Gibson 2005 In this
work we have found that galaxies represent two statistically dis-
tinct groups with a transition at   14 and dc  15R200 a
scale somewhat smaller by 25 than the observed radius for
decreased star formation but consistent with this value At the
same time our sample by dwarf galaxies MB  20 for  90
of all objects with statistical transition line at MB  1855
such that the central galaxies are the most luminous as well

These are also redder than the more external ones with a tran-
sition line at B  R  11 All of this suggests that our sam-
ple consists mainly of dwarf ellipticals dE Interestingly dE
are potentially the only galaxy type whose formation is sensi-
tive to global rather than local environment Conselice 2005
In this context it is important to note that we found about 94
groups have signicant elongation throughout the group and the
surrounding elds GA2 and a negative linear relation be-
tween GA and the fraction of 1 galaxies In the case when these
objects are predominantly dEs we conclude that these galaxies
are tracing the anisotropic large-scale accretion of matter onto
groups We also know that the high dwarf-to-giant ratio observed
in rich clusters suggests that cluster dE do not form in groups that
later merge to build clusters Conselice 2005 Bright galaxies
that follow the Kormendy relation Kormendy 1977 are indeed
unlikely to have been formed by mergers of dwarf early-type
systems Evstigneeva et al 2004 Likewise our results indicate
that a high number of dEs exist in both the groups and the ow
of matter along the lamentary structure feeding these systems
