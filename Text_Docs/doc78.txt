We present a mechanism for catalyzed vacuum bubble production obtained by com-
bining moduli stabilization with a generalized attractor phenomenon in which moduli are
sourced by compact objects This leads straightforwardly to a class of examples in which
the Hawking decay process for black holes unveils a bubble of a dierent vacuum from the
ambient one generalizing the new endpoint for Hawking evaporation discovered recently
by Horowitz Catalyzed vacuum bubble production can occur for both charged and un-
charged bodies including Schwarzschild black holes for which massive particles produced
in the Hawking process can trigger vacuum decay We briey discuss applications of this
process to the population and stability of metastable vacua

1 Introduction
Recently much progress has been made in stabilizing moduli and analyzing the re-
sulting discretuum of vacua 1 Another topic of recent interest has been the attractor
mechanism see eg
23 in which moduli are driven to xed values at the horizon of
charged black holes
In general both types of eects are present The dynamics of moduli i are determined
by the scalar potential U and by other local sources  x to which the moduli couple
via an equation of motion of the form
2  U  
For example in weakly coupled string theory the dilaton  modulates masses and cou-
plings of particles so energy densities formed from them typically depend on  As a
specic example moduli-dependence in the kinetic terms for electromagnetic elds yields
forces on moduli near charged sources an ingredient in the attractor mechanism
Taking both eects into account leads to the possibility of catalyzed production of
bubbles of dierent vacua Consider the subset of backgrounds where structure formation
leads to objects dense enough that the source terms  in 11 compete with the barrier
height in U separating one metastable minimum of U from another The moduli can
then be locally forced into the basin of attraction of a dierent minimum from that at
which they are metastabilized in bulk Depending on the parameters this can result
in vacuum decay or in production of a perturbatively stable nonexpanding bubble of a
dierent vacuum A dramatic string-theoretic example of this was obtained recently in
4 where certain charged sources produce a tachyonic instability nearby catalyzing the
formation of a bubble of nothing
One goal of the present note is to point out a large class of examples where bubbles of
other vacua appear in the course of Hawking evaporation of black holes In particular in
the charged case we generalize 4 and in the uncharged case we obtain a new mechanism
for vacuum bubble production
For charged black holes this arises in variants of the process 4 accessible in eective
eld theory One can start in one metastable vacuum and form a black hole with mass
much greater than its charge At rst it behaves approximately like a Schwarzschild black
hole gradually losing mass to Hawking radiation At some point long before it reaches the
correspondence point the black hole has radiated away enough of its mass that the charge
plays a role exerting local forces on the scalar elds in the problem and creating a bubble
of a dierent vacuum
Vacuum bubbles can also be produced in the case of uncharged compact objects
including Schwarzschild black holes via the accumulation of uncharged matter sourcing
scalar elds Depending on the relative strength of the local energy density and the ambi-
ent moduli potential the bubbles may appear outside or inside the Schwarzschild radius
Bubbles may form outside in two ways in the process of collapse before the horizon forms
and in the process of Hawking evaporation as the black hole becomes small enough to
produce massive Hawking particles sourcing the scalar In the latter case we will present
a window of parameters for which this new mechanism constitutes the dominant method
for producing vacuum bubbles occurring faster than tunneling and other eects in the
black hole background
One application is to black hole physics whose dynamics contains information about
other vacua This plays a role in the microphysical description of black holes and their
information ow
Another application is to provide a method for populating the landscape which pro-
ceeds perturbatively Backgrounds with larger variations in density are more likely to
produce vacuum bubbles conversely backgrounds with less dense structure formation are
more stable1 The process also provides a dynamical mechanism favoring regions with light
particles this aspect is similar to moduli trapping 7 except here the particle production
is eected by structure formation and evaporating black holes
Perhaps the most compelling application of this process would be to obtain regions
of parameter space where catalyzed bubble production would be possible realistically
probing regions of the landscape As we discuss this depends on the degree to which dense
structures and small black holes form as a result of early universe ination and structure
formation A much more extensive treatment of this appears in the interesting related
work of 10 to appear The prospect of catalyzed decays and their realistic embedding is
also under investigation in 11
1 There have been a number of calculations of catalyzed tunneling decays in eld theory and
gravity 5 For simplicity we will here focus on the regime where local overdensities develop
strongly enough to classically kick the scalar eld over a potential barrier separating dierent local
minima There have been a number of works using gases of particles obtained cosmologically to
provide transient forces on scalar elds as in thermal ination and eg 6789
The paper is organized as follows In section 2 we set up two canonical systems where
moduli are sourced by local densities and review bubble dynamics in a way applicable to
the catalyzed formation process The main new results are contained in section 3 where
we present the catalyzed bubble production mechanisms for charged and uncharged black
holes Section 4 describes various applications of the mechanism
2 Catalyzed Bubble production and evolution
Consider for simplicity rst a regime in which low energy eld theory is a good ap-
proximation We will be interested in the situation described above 11 in which the
scalar equation of motion can be written in the form
2  Utotr 
where the total eective potential Utot depends on radial coordinate distance r from the
source in a metric of the form
ds2  ar2dt2 
ar2  br2d2
in terms of functions ar br which approach 1 and r respectively in the limit where
gravitational eects are negligible
We will nd it useful to parameterize the moduli potential in terms of its energy scale
MU and the typical size of its features in eld space M0
U  M 4
U f M0
In particular the barrier width is of order M0
Let us give two illustrative examples First we can consider a charged compact object
with scalars i coupling to electromagnetic elds according to the action
S Z d4xGcid18M 2
p R  2i2  fabiF a
 F b  Uicid19
generalizing that in 3 to include the ambient moduli potential U For simplicity we will
focus on a single direction  scalar eld space Given spherical symmetry and Gauss law
we can write say for a magnetically charged black hole
F a  Qa sin d  d
The equations of motion for the scalar eld in this background are
b2 sin

where  denotes dierentiation with respect to  and where the local contribution to the
force on the scalar arises from an eective potential
Vef f  fabQaQb
obtained from the electromagnetic energy by plugging 25 into 24 The total eective
potential in the sense of 21 is Utot  Vef f b4  U
As a second illustrative example let us consider a scalar  which modulates the mass
of a particle for example a fermion eld  The action governing this sector of the theory
S Z d4xGcid18M 2
p R  i D  22  f  M0m   U   0cid19 28
where we included the possibility of a chemical potential  and we parameterize the
argument of the modulating function f via a scale M0
particles the scalar eld equation of motion can again be written in the form 26 where
In a background density of 
in this case the local eective potential is
b4  f  M0hm ir t  r t 
In a background which includes the evolution of structure the massive elds  will
develop inhomogeneities along with other sectors of the theory We will be interested in
cases where these inhomogeneities make the  term compete with the U term in the
equation of motion for 
Having indicated two types of examples let us return to the general analysis of the
dynamics Let us suppose that enough density develops that the forces from Vef f b4
dominate over those of U for r less than some crossover scale rc Let us start by assuming
that the forces on the scalar eld are dominated by eld theoretic ones ie that the energy
densities in the two vacua are small enough that the curvature is a negligible contribution
to the scalar equation of motion We will also make use of the discretuum of vacua to
assume we can tune the potential as desired to simplify our analysis We will take the
local eective potential Vef f for simplicity to have a single minimum at    and U to
have a minimum at    and a lower minimum at    In bulk  is metastabilized
at either    or   
Case I
Case II
Case III
Fig 1 Three basic cases in which a compact object locally distorts the eective
moduli potential
There are three basic cases we will discuss see gure 1 I  is in the basin of
attraction of  II    is in the true vacuum while  is close to  III
   is in the false vacuum while  is close to  In cases II and III one forms a
vacuum bubble This bubble is perturbatively stable at a nite radius in case II and can
expand forever for appropriate values of the parameters in case III
21 Case I
First we consider the case where Vef f has settled down to a time independent shape
whose minimum is in the basin of attraction of Ur   the minimum of U where
 is stabilized asymptotically There is a static perturbatively stable solution in this case
At any given r there exists a minimum of the combined potential Utotr   Vef f
that is continuously connected to minima of U and Vef f

where the background solution 0r satises
Fluctuations x about the minimum are massive

22 Case II perturbatively stable vacuum bubbles
When Vef f has a minimum at the false vacuum value of  but  is in the true vacuum
asymptotically a static bubble is formed
There are two characteristic values of r in this case As before rc is the coordinate
radius below which the local eective potential Vef f b4 draws the scalar eld toward 
A second radial scale of interest r
c  rc appears in this case it is the radial distance at
which the two minima of Utot are degenerate Utot r
c  Utot r
For r  rc  will roll toward the only minimum available In particular the scalar
eld VEV will be close to that corresponding to the false vacuum in bulk Conversely if
this bubble of false vacuum extended out to r  r
reasons Thus the bubble wall should have a stable position somewhere near r
c then it would collapse for energetic
The technology developed in 12 could be used to analyze this case in more detail
we will illustrate this in the next section on case III
23 Case III exploding attractors and vacuum decays
The nal case is where the eld is metastabilized in the false vacuum at innity but
Vef f is in the true vacuum The solutions will typically evolve in time and thus the
question of initial conditions is important Unlike the previous case there is only one
characteristic scale rc
We expect that for r  rc the eld will roll into the minimum Therefore we will
start with the bubble wall at a radius slightly below rc and we will consider whether or
not the bubble expands At r  rc U dominates and the solution will look like a typical
vacuum bubble so the standard analysis applies to determine whether the bubble expands
Therefore we will focus on the new eects of the local source We will be interested in
nding reasonable conditions under which the wall expands from its starting conguration
Let us start in pure eld theory to gain intuition after which we will indicate the
fully relativistic generalization First let us arrange parameters such that the bubble wall
is thin This means that  varies from  to  over a radial distance r  rc We follow
12 and work in Gaussian normal coordinates
ds2  dn2  ijdxidxj
where n is the normal direction to the bubble and xi the coordinates along the bubble
The scalar equation of motion is then
dncid192
A thin wall requires that cid18 d
dn at the wall This integrates to
dncid192
dcid18 d
 i
dncid192
cid18 d
Utot
 2Utot    C
where  is the proper time along the wall and C is an integration constant Setting
the variation of  with respect to n to be zero inside the bubble we can take C to be
2Utot
Suppose the bubble starts at rest at radius just below rc forming once the density
accumulates to the point that Vef f b4 dominates over U for r  rc Let us expand
Utot rc  V0  V1     with V1 parameterizing the steepness of the potential which
drives the eld toward its inner vacuum To begin with the normal direction is the r
direction and the equations integrate to
   
r  rc2
If we x the dierence in eld VEVs      and increase the strength of the
potential increase V1 then we decrease the thickness r of the wall and improve the thin
wall approximation
In the example of attractor black holes 27 this can be obtained by choosing su-
ciently large charges Q such that r  rc From 2627 we obtain that the crossover
scale rc occurs at rc  QMU where M 4
U is the scale of the potential U So holding xed
 and scaling up Q increases rc and decreases the thickness improving the thin wall
approximation
Now in order to understand if the bubble will expand we need to compare the energy
cost from the tension with the energy gained by replacing the volume inside the bubble
by the phase of lower energy U We will mostly analyze this with a generic potential
characterized by the two scales MU  M0 in particular taking the energy dierence U
U  M 4
U  In a realistic example with U tuned to be very small this generic energy
dierence applies for decays to a   0 phase A smaller energy dierence corresponds to
a larger critical bubble size required for expansion in the regime where U dominates 13
The tension costs an amount
EB  42TBRBR2
where we have taken into account the fact that the tension will change with wall radius
RB because our potential Utot changes with distance from the source In particular the
barrier between the two basins of attraction  appears for large enough RB that U begins
to dominate in Utot
Plugging the solution 215 into the expression for the wall tension
TB Z 
we obtain at RB  rc

Let us rst compare the tension energy at RB  rc to the potential energy Ebulk

which parameterically beats the wall energy TBr2

More generally if we stay outside the compact source eg if we stay outside the horizon

of the black hole we should consider a shell of bulk potential energy of thickness r with
volume rr2
c  The ratio of the bulk energy to the wall
c rather than the whole volume r3
energy is of order
Ewall 
There is also stress-energy from the black hole and from kinetic energy of the scalar
eld as it rolls toward the bottom of its local potential and from particles that it pro-
duces in the process Some outgoing radiation will be produced in the process of bubble
formation as well as ongoing Hawking particle production leading to a net ux outward
of energy from the compact object As we will discuss momentarily these eects aid the
expansion of the bubble which may play a signicant role in cases where the bubble would
be sub-critical from the point of view of U alone First however let us continue to assess
the expansion based on U in the cases where this is sucient
Once enough energy has escaped that the black hole horizon is separated from the
wall by a distance r  r the comparison 220 means that the wall begins to expand
The tension of the wall at larger radius increases somewhat due to the barrier in U but
as long as the bubble size and the parameters in U are in the range leading to expansion
according to the standard Coleman-de Luccia analysis 13 the explosion will continue
unabated
In the case of 28 where the local density arises from massive particles  whose
mass depends on  the expanding bubble may produce further  particles amplifying the
eect This is because as  rolls toward the new minimum  the mass of the massive
particles decreases This can lead to quantum production of further  particles enhancing
the local density trapping  near  7
The techniques developed in 12 provide a generally covariant description of the evo-
lution of bubbles in a way which is convenient for incorporating the mass and charge of
the black hole and the r dependence in our total eective potential Utot r The results
of this section appear from such an analysis in the weak gravity limit
As mentioned above the inside of the bubble and the wall itself can contain addi-
tional sources of energy and pressure Thus far we have focused on the eective potential
for  while ignoring that it originates from a local source with a dierent equation of state
from the moduli potential Moreover the relaxation of the  eld to its local minimum 
proceeds via transfer of its kinetic energy into particles including further  production as
in 7 As such the pressure inside the wall has a dierent relation to the energy density
than would arise from pure vacuum energy Also a gauge eld conned to the bubble
contributes a positive pressure term that would not appear if it were simply a scalar
This positive pressure inside the wall helps the bubble expand Similar couplings to other
standard model particles will also aid the expansion
In what follows we will make several applications of the basic process we have dis-
cussed in this section First we will discuss the stimulated emission of vacuum bubbles in
the process of black hole formation and evaporation The charged case 31 is most closely
analogous to 4 but we will also nd a mechanism for perturbative production of vacuum
bubbles by uncharged bodies including Schwarzschild black holes 32 We will then move
on in 4 to discuss some implications of this for the landscape and make preliminary
comments on realistic constraints
3 Black Holes as Catalytic Vacuum Converters
31 Vacuum bubbles as endpoints of Hawking decay the charged case
One application is to generalize the endpoint of Hawking decay found in 4 Consider
starting in a metastable vacuum at  and forming a black hole with mass much greater
than its charge At rst the eld  is well stabilized at  Once the black hole radiates
down to the point that its horizon at r  rh falls below rc the local eective potential
Vef f b4 begins to pull the scalar eld toward the point  minimizing the local eective
potential Vef f  In case II this produces a metastable vacuum bubble a vacuon In case
III it produces an explosive vacuum decay After the vacuum bubble is produced the
rh  rc black hole continues to evaporate pair producing particles in the spectrum of the
inner vacuum
Let us next compute the basic thermodynamic quantities at the point that the bubble
is unleashed This occurs when rc  QMU is of order the horizon radius rh For the

the outer black hole horizon is at rh  M
When the outer horizon shrinks to rc the bubble emerges As in 4 this can easily
happen far away from the correspondence point in the nonextremal regime MMP  Q
In this regime the horizon radius is approximately rh  2MM 2

It would be interesting to obtain a microphysical accounting of these objects and their
explosions a topic to which we will return briey in the discussion section
There are clearly many variants of this For example the modulus may couple to other
elds which condense inside the bubble spontaneously breaking bulk symmetries This is
a feature of the tachyon condensation in 4 Instead of pure Reissner-Nordstrom one may
consider multiple charges such as those combinations for which a standard attractor black
hole arises at the end of the process surrounded by a vacuum bubble
32 Schwarzschild black holes and bubbles
The process 4 and its generalization in 31 depend on having a charged source for
the moduli The vacuum Schwarzschild solution does not locally source scalar moduli
outside the horizon However the moduli can be sourced by the dense matter coallescing
to form the black hole This can happen either before the horizon forms or inside the
horizon depending on the energy scales Moreover in the process of Hawking decay the
temperature increases to the point where massive particles get produced as we will see
these may also source moduli and yield a vacuum bubble
Bubble Catalysis in Black Hole formation I initial collapse
Matter which collapses to form a black hole of mass M develops a density of order
S  M 6
P  If this
density competes with the barrier heights in the moduli potential U and if the local and
ambient potentials are congured as in case II or III above then this process will produce
P M 2 when the matter reaches the Schwarzschild radius RS  MM 2
a vacuum bubble before a black hole is formed In case II it creates a perturbatively stable
vacuon and in case III an explosive vacuum decay
Bubble Formation in Black Hole formation II inside
In many models
Schwarzschild density M 6
the black holes which form by structure formation have a
P M 2 which is very low compared to natural barrier heights
For example the smallest black holes inferred from core collapse events have roughly solar
mass corresponding to an energy density of GeV 4 This means that for U  GeV 4 no
bubbles are formed outside the horizon in their formation
However
inside the horizon bubbles are generically classically nucleated by the
crunching matter source
In particular in weakly coupled string landscape models 1
there is a runaway direction for the dilaton andor volume moduli separated by a barrier
from metastable vacua These moduli will generically couple to the masses of particles
forming the black hole As a result a vacuum bubble containing the basin of attraction
of the large volumeweak coupling limit will materialize inside the black hole The Kas-
ner solution approaching the black hole singularity must therefore be extended to include
the rolling dilaton volume and other liberated moduli of the compactication inside the
bubble2
Bubble formation in Black Hole Evaporation III massive Hawking particles seed bubbles
Let us consider a model such as 28 and simple generalizations in which  modulates
the mass of a set of elds such as  In the process of evaporation the black hole eventually
reaches high enough temperatures T to produce massive Hawking particles  of mass m
Once T reaches the threshold T  m a signicant density of the massive  particles
If these particles do not decay or disperse too rapidly they form a

density of particles which can kick  from one basin of attraction to another We will
now assess a window of parameters where this occurs For simplicity we will rst focus
on a regime where the produced massive  particles are still non-relativistic far from
the BH with outward velocities beating the escape velocity but much smaller than the
speed of light The black hole also produces quanta of  itself For consistency we will
then check that  uctuations do not themselves produce bubbles and that they do not
wash out the -catalyzed bubble production in the range of parameters of interest With
m  m  M 2
U M0 the situation is schematically depicted in gure 2
2 Note that this result is dierent from the suggestion 14 that new universes are created
inside black holes which would require the black hole singularity to be resolved in such a way
as to connect a big crunch with a big bang Evidence such as 151617 contraindicates the
hypothesis of a crunch-bang inside black holes In any case our results about bubble formation
outside black holes support the idea that black holes induce mixing between dierent metastable
vacua our mechanism for producing such mixing is the much more prosaic classical catalysis eect
described in the text
Fig 2 In a time period t the black hole lled circle produces a gas of massive
 particles which spreads a distance r to occupy the region indicated For the
regime of parameters discussed in the text this seeds a vacuum bubble During the
same period the lighter  uctuations disperse more rapidly and have diluted to
occupy a smaller energy density over a larger region For an appropriate window
of parameters the uctuations of light  particles do not wash out the bubble
nucleated by the gas of massive  particles

where V ol is the volume of space into which the produced  particles have dispersed in a
time window for which the black hole mass has decreased by M  of which a fraction 
has gone into the production of  particles In this time window t the particles spread
out a distance r which we will insist be much greater than the black hole size T 1
This ensures that the particles we consider are far from the black hole horizon so that the
Hawking calculation of the asymptotic produced particle distribution is accurate More
specically let us count the particles emerging from the black hole starting at a distance
r  1T  and consider their further spread into the volume contained between r  r
and r  2r
We will insist that r be at least as large as the critical bubble size Rc  M0M 2
above which the bubble expands in the regime where the potential U dominates as derived
in the standard analysis 13 and reviewed in 2 Given r  T 1 the volume V ol in 32
is of order r3 We will nd conditions under which the density 32 is competitive with
or stronger than the ambient potential U and that the time window t is suciently
long that the local density 32 can drive  across the barrier a distance M0 in eld space

From this we can obtain the fraction  of the black hole emission which is contained
in non-relativistic  particles as follows Hawking evaporation produces a thermal dis-
tribution of particle numbers 18 up to the greybody factor arising from the absorption

which is automatically greater than M0 in our non-relativistic regime So the window T
is easily long enough to drive  into the basin of attraction of a dierent minimum
Now let us address the decay of the density 311 via annihilation of  particles into 
particles As we noted above a natural model in which to apply this would be a low energy
supersymmetric model for which  has scalar superpartners also with mass of order m

Finally let us check the eects of  uctuations themselves First let us note that
the gases of particles produced by the black hole including both  uctuations and the
 particles in our model are not in thermal equilibrium at temperature T in the regime
of interest The particles are produced by the hot black hole but spread out to radii of
order r  1T and hence their energy density is not that of an equilibrium thermal gas
at temperature T 
We want to check if the  particles produce a substantial back reaction on the system
We will address the eects of the  uctuations in both the non-relativistic and relativistic
regimes
Expanding our potential U  M 4
U f M0 we have a  mass m  M 2
U M0 As
the black hole heats up past the threshold T  M 2
U M0 for producing  perturbations it
begins to do so non-relativistically similarly to our discussion above However there we saw
312 that T  M0 was required to catalyze a bubble of radius greater than the critical
size assuming the eective potential in the presence of the gas of particles drives  in this
direction So for MU  M0 as happens for weakly coupled moduli the regime where
non-relativistic  particles are produced does not in itself produce a r-sized bubble
typical momentum of produced  particles is of order k  T  M 2
energy k22 is much greater than the potential energy m2
In the regime T  m in which the  uctuations are produced relativistically the

above we can estimate the energy density  in relativistic  particles at a radial distance

barrier
As pointed out in 11 the suppression factor m2
k2 in the above estimate would be
weakened if the energy scale k were much lower than the black hole temperature T  This
may happen via thermalization in the presence of suciently strong interactions among
the  particles But in the weakly coupled regime MU  M0 we consider here we nd
this eect is not signicant
This result is perhaps not surprising given that it has been argued that symmetry is
not restored in the thermal bath seen by a non-inertial observer 20 The usual explanation
for this result is that the acceleration and the temperature scale in the same way so the
eective gravity spoils the symmetry restoration that occurs in at space What makes
the transition possible in the case of the  particles is precisely that a signicant density is
formed at distances large enough to ignore gravitational eects The fact that we cannot
achieve this with the weakly interacting  particles may not be a coincidence
So far we have seen that  uctuations do not themselves produce large vacuum
bubbles this means the eect we are considering does require the extra  particles Next
let us check whether the kinetic-energy-dominated spatially varying  uctuations wash
out the bubble produced by the  gas The average eld uctuation  is determined by
k22   with k  T  This could potentially be a problem if the distance in eld
space   T is greater than or equal to the barrier width M0 In the same window
considered above for -catalyzed bubble production the density in  particles is of order
  M 4
Setting this less than M 2
0 T 2 ensures that   M0 so that the  uctuations do not wash
out the  catalysis eect This is automatic for MU  M0
In the regime of parameters we have taken the  catalysis occurs classically once the
 particles have been created so this eect automatically dominates over exponentially
suppressed thermal and tunneling eects
It is readily veried that a window of parameters exists where all the above constraints
are satised As a specic example the following hierarchy of scales works
  10
MU  102 m
MU  108
MU  109 MP
MU  1016
Altogether these estimates suggest that vacuum bubbles can also appear as new end-
points of Hawking radiation in the case of uncharged black holes Whatever formed the
black hole the process of evaporation proceeds through higher and higher temperatures
eventually producing massive particles which can seed a vacuum bubble surrounding the
evaporating black hole if the mass scales lie in the range satisfying the above constraints
The above estimates are in fact somewhat more conservative than necessary For
example it is possible to extend this mechanism to the regime where the produced 
It is only the m  contribution to the stress energy which
particles are relativistic
sources the eld which is down by a factor of mT 2 from the full energy density in
the relativistic regime But the production of relativistic  particles is unsuppressed
Altogether requiring the force at r  Rc to be greater than that from U leads to a
somewhat wider window of parameters where the eect occurs For example the constraint
312 becomes
  2M0 M0
Moreover once the bubble is produced either relativistically or non-relativistically further
 particles  produced from the black hole and from the rolling  eld  push it out further
4 Other applications
41 Population and stability of the landscape
We have just found a signicant range of parameters for which Schwarzschild black
holes ultimately catalyze vacuum bubbles in the process of Hawking evaporation if not
before since they produce massive particle densities that source the dilaton runaway di-
rection The decay of large black holes while a very long process is parameterically faster
than bubble nucleation by tunneling
This eect must be taken into account in assessing stability of metastable vacua Real-
istic application requires tuning the cosmological constant to be small and then comparing
the particle spectrum and parameters in the potential to those required above for catalyzed
decay Transitions from a realistically small cosmological constant to a   0 minimum
involve a very small bulk potential energy dierence which makes it more dicult to ob-
tain an explosive decay However transitions from realistic cosmological constant vacua to
nearby   0 phases are not so suppressed and the above mechanism can destabilize the
model well before tunneling events do
In the context of the landscape this appears to be the dominant instability in a
signicant range of backgrounds For example in the case of our universe with solar mass
black holes formed from core collapse events the decay time arising from the evaporation
of these black holes of order  1065 years is substantially shorter than the decay time of
order e10120
obtained from tunneling in appropriate regions of parameter space 1 though
still safely longer than the age of the universe This alone while leading to a vastly
shorter decay timescale does not constrain the models realistically However in the context
of models leading to denser objects 1021 there may be phenomenologically signicant
constraints from this process 10
One can also apply this to the early universe as a mechanism for populating the
landscape Backgrounds in which overdensities develop which compete with the barriers in
U will experience catalyzed vacuum bubble production The formation of dense structures
is a somewhat delicate process in the observable universe the formation of dense stars
inside gravitational potential wells induced by dark matter depends on appropriate cooling
mechanisms which may then collect yet denser structures 1021 In any case in the
apparently vast discretuum of string vacua there may be many examples with dense
structures forming in hidden sectors which lead to vacuum bubble production In the case
III of explosive vacuum decay this process populates the landscape faster than occurs
via tunneling
This produces a dynamical trend toward solutions with smaller inhomogeneities back-
grounds with large inhomogeneities seed vacuum decays producing new backgrounds which
produce their own bubbles until the process shuts o with the production of backgrounds
with small inhomogeneities relative to barrier heights
This dynamics also produces bubbles with lower mass particles since the forces that
draw  toward the new vacuum at  arise by virtue of particles whose mass decreases as
   Although our mechanism here is dierent the same trend as in 7 toward points
with extra light particles arises in this context Moreover the bubble need not be empty
as the bubble expands and the eld rolls toward  the masses of the  particles change
with time and they may get produced
42 Vacuum bubble production in realistic models constraints and corners
In a highly model-dependent way vacuum bubbles may be produced by catalysis in
realistic scenarios This depends on the densest structures that form in the model
Some ination models such as certain hybrid ination models 22 produce small pri-
mordial black holes
In the context of the landscape their formation and decays can
produce vacuum bubbles instead of simply leaving behind small bursts of radiation For
case III this constrains inationary parameter space to some extent and conversely in case
II it provides a model-dependent mechanism for producing vacuum bubbles
A more interesting regime where dense structures may form 10 is via the collection
and coalescence of charged exotics in stars generalizing the eect discussed in 21
Another natural question is whether real world core collapse events can produce tran-
sient vacuum bubbles in general it is of interest to explain type II supernova explosions
233 Scalar eld moduli typically couple to standard model elds These may be sta-
bilized at a very high scale suppressing catalyzed decays However very low potentials
3 Heterotic supernovae have yet to be detected
can be obtained technically naturally for example in the case that a scalar eld  couples
preferentially to the neutrino mass term cf 24 in a similar way at low energies to the
example 28 In this case one obtains a potential energy of order m2
C where MC is
the eective cuto in neutrino loop contributions to the moduli potential If the latter is
at the supersymmetry breaking scale of T eV  the resulting energy scale for the radiatively
generated moduli potential is roughly of order M eV 4 ie MU  M eV 
The densest known structures are the neutron stars formed from core collapse events
The energy density in these environments is of order the QCD scale the neutrinos form
a trapped degenerate relativistic gas with chemical potential of order 200 MeV and hence
energy density 200M eV 4 in the core 25 However the scalar elds modulating the
neutrino masses are directly sensitive only to the nonrelativistic correction to the energy
density This is down by a factor of order m2
 p2  1018 for momentum scale p  200M eV
from the relativistic energy 200M eV 4
Hence absent further cancellations the mass-dependent contribution to the energy
density to which the scalar is directly sensitive is small compared to the natural scale of
barrier heights However in models with low barrier heights attractor explosions might
play a role4
5 Discussion
In this note we have seen how starting in a single metastable vacuum one can assemble
compact objects which unveil bubbles of other vacua We found large classes of examples
generalizing 4 to provide vacuum bubbles as endpoints of Hawking evaporation of charged
and uncharged black holes We have also noted that matter sources can produce bubbles
of other vacua inside the horizon which modify the internal solution before impinging on
the singularity their existence must be imprinted in the decay products of the black hole
Perhaps most interestingly we found that in the process of evaporation of Schwarzschild
black holes the massive particles produced in the Hawking process can seed vacuum decay
4 The present simulations aiming to explain type II supernovae via neutrino energy deposition
do not consistently yield explosions 23 so it is conceivable that new physics will be required
However it is entirely possible that explosions will arise from more conventional mechanisms see
eg 26 so this rather tuned regime of parameters does not appear well motivated unless serious
puzzles with generating SNe explosions persist
The black hole catalytically converts whatever formed it into all the particles of the sys-
tem including massive particles sourcing moduli The resulting local potential forces the
moduli into a dierent vacuum for a range of model parameters This perturbative eect
occurs much more rapidly than exponentially suppressed thermal and tunneling eects
Our analysis has been semiclassical combining structure formation and gravitational
collapse with Hawking radiation and classical bubble nucleation The basic laws of black
hole mechanics 27 are classical but provided clues pointing toward a more microphys-
ical statistical description of black holes
It would be interesting to determine a dual
microphysical description of these processes
In general our main lesson is simple Compact objects made in one vacuum contain
information about other vacua if the objects are suciently dense This regime seems
potentially more accessible than non-perturbative cosmological methods for connecting
present physics with the other vacua in the landscape Moreover dual descriptions of black
hole entropy and dynamics must account for attractor explosions in the generic setting 1
Finally assessing the ultimate decay modes of physical models built on metastable vacua
requires analyzing the structure formation in the models and estimating the catalyzed
decay time as well as the ambient tunneling amplitude
