Abstract    Machine  Translation  is  the  translation  of  one 
natural 
into  another  using  automated  and 
computerized  means  For  a  multilingual  country  like  India 
with  the  huge  amount  of  information  exchanged  between 
various regions and in different languages in digitized format 
it  has  become  necessary  to  find  an  automated  process  from 
one language to another In this paper we take a look at the 
various  Machine  Translation  System  in  India  which  is 
specifically  built  for  the  purpose  of  translation  between  the 
Indian  languages  We  discuss  the  various  approaches  taken 
for building the machine translation system and then discuss 
some of the Machine Translation Systems in India along with 
their features

I  INTRODUCTION 
India  With 
the  advent  of 
in  various  domains 
Machine Translation is the automated process of translating 
one  natural  language  to  another  With  the  perspective  of 
Indian  languages  Machine  Translation  holds  tremendous 
potential 
like  health  education 
information  technology  business  and  various  governmental 
agencies India being a multi lingual country languages vary 
from region to region At present there are a total of 22 official 
languages 
Information 
Technology  many  digitized  documents  web  pages  are 
coming up in local languages and it has become indispensable 
to  build  systems  that  would  serve  the  purpose  of  translating 
within  the  Indian  languages  Manual  translation  of  these 
documents  is  not  only  time  consuming  but  also  has  a 
tremendous  cost  factor  involved  As  such  coming  up  with 
machine translation systems that translate between the Indian 
languages  has  become  very  important  Moreover  translating 
these  regional 
is  also 
necessary Many researchers have started working on Machine 
Translation  systems  specifically  catered  for 
the  Indian 
languages and have gained very satisfactory results  
to  English 
languages 
languages 
The  research  scenario  in  India  is  relatively  young  and 
machine  translation  gained  momentum  in  India  only  from 
1980 onwards  with institutions like IIT Kanpur IIT Bombay 
IIIT  Hyderabad  University  of  Hyderabad  NCST  Mumbai 
The  Technology  Development  in  Indian  Languages  TDIL 
and  CDAC  Pune  playing  a  major  role  in  developing  the 
systems  17  18  Since  then  many  Machine  Translation 
systems have been developed in India which has used different 
approaches  for  translating  between  the  languages  Here  we 
take a look at the  major Machine Translation systems  which 
have been used for translation between the Indian languages 
The rest of the paper is organized in the following way 
Section 2 gives an idea of the different approaches to build a 
machine  translation  system  Section  3  discusses  the  direct 
approach  for  building  the  machine  translation  system  In 
section 4 we discuss the Rule Based system Section 5 gives 
an  idea of the corpus based approaches In section 6 we take a 
look  at  various  Machine  Translation  Systems  in  India  along 
with  their  features  and  we  finally  conclude  the  paper  in  the 
next section 
II  APPROACHES IN MACHINE TRANSLATION 
The  process  of  Machine  Translation  can  be  broadly 
classified  into  the  following  approaches  Direct  Machine 
Translation  Rule  Based  Machine  Translation  Corpus  Based 
Machine Translation 
The  Rule  Based  Approach  can  be  further  subdivided  into 
Transfer  Based  approach  and  Interlingua  approach  while  the 
Corpus  based  approach  can  be  categorized  into  Statistical 
Machine Translation and Example based approach

III  DIRECT MACHINE TRANSLATION 
Direct  Machine  Translation  is  the  one  of  the  simplest 
machine translation approach In Direct Machine Translation 
a direct word by word translation of the input source is carried 
out  with  the  help  of  a  bilingual  dictionary  and  after  which 
some syntactical rearrangement are made  
In Direct Machine Translation a language called the source 
language  is  given  as  input  and  the  output  is  known  as  the 
target language Typically the approach is unidirectional and 
only takes one language pair into consideration at a time

Figure 2 Direct Machine Translation Systems 
The  most  well-known  Direct  Machine  Translation  system 
for  Indian  languages  are  Anusaaraka  10  developed  by  IIT 
Kanpur  which  is  now  being  continued  at  IIT  Hyderabad  
Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation System 5 developed at 
Punjab University which achieved an accuracy of 95   
IV  RULE BASED MACHINE TRANSLATION 
The  Rule  Based  Machine  Translation  System  takes  into 
account  semantic  morphological  and  syntactic  information 
from a bilingual dictionary and grammar and based on these 
rules generate the output target language from the input source 
language  by  producing  an  intermediate  representation  Rule 
based  system  is  further  classified  as  Interlingua  based 
Machine Translation and Transfer based Machine Translation 
depending on the intermediate representation 
A  Interlingua Approach 
The Interlingua Approach converts words into an intermediate 
language  IL  which  is  typically  a  universal  language  created 
for the system to use it as an intermediate for translation into 
more than one target language The Interlingua approach has 
an analyzer which produces the intermediate representation of 
the  source  language  The  synthesizer  takes  over  from  the 
analyzer and produces target sentences given by the analyzer 
Figure 3 Interlingual Machine Translation 
  The  major  Machine  Translation  system  in  India  based  on 
Interlingua  approach  are  Anglabharti  3  developed  at  IIT 
Kanpur  which  uses  an  intermediate  structure  Pseudo  Lingua 
for  Indian  Languages  AnglaHindi  6  is  an  extension  of 
Anglabharti which uses rule-bases example-base and statistics 
to obtain translation for frequently encountered noun and verb 
phrasal  Another  notable  system  is  the  Universal  Natural 
Language  English  to  Hindi  Machine  Translation  system  7 
developed  at  IIT  Bombay  which  uses  a  universal  natural 
language as propose by United Nations University Currently 
work  is  in  progress  for  English  to  Marathi  and  English  to 
Bengali UNL system 
A  Transfer based approach 
The Transfer based approach uses translation rules to translate 
the  input  language  to  the  output  language  which  is  done  in 
three  phases  The  approach  uses  a  dictionary  to  directly 
convert source into target whenever a sentence matches one of 
the transfer rules Source language dictionary Target language 
dictionary and a bilingual dictionary is used for this purpose 
The  translation  mechanism  is  carried  out  in  three  phases 
Firstly  the  source  language  is  converted  into  intermediate 
representation  which  is  subsequently  converted  into  target 
language representation in the second phase The third phase 
involves generation of the final target language

Indian Machine Translation system based on Transfer based 
approach  includes  Mantra  developed  by  Applied  Artificial 
Intelligence group of CDAC Pune Another translation system 
is  the  Matra  system  also  developed  by  CDAC  Pune  11 
Other systems include Shakti Machine Translation system 13 
developed  by  IIIT  Hyderabad  and  IISC  Bangalore  which 
works  by  combining  rule  based  and  statistical  approach  
Anubaad 12 is another translation system which is a hybrid 
system  which  uses  n-gram  approach  for  POS  tagging  and 
works at sentence level developed at CDAC Kolkata Another 
notable system is the English to Kannada Machine Translation 
system 11 developed at University of Hyderabad which uses 
Universal  Clause  Structure  Grammar  Formalism  Sampark 
11  is  another  translation  system  which  translates  Indian 
Languages  to  Indian  Languages  Machine  developed  at  IIIT 
Hyderabad  which  was  based  on  Paninian  framework 
Recently  researchers  have  introduced  distributed  computing 
2  and  cloud  computing  15  16  for  Indian  machine 
translation systems The Sampark system is deployed in cloud 
environment  which  reduces  the  deployment  time  19  and

V  CORPUS BASED MACHINE TRANSLATION 
Corpus  based  machine  translation  have  evolved  as  the 
preferred approach for machine translation In this approach a 
bilingual  text  corpus  is  taken  and  trained  to  get  the  desired 
output  The  corpus  based  approach  is  mainly  used  in 
Statistical  Machine  Translation  and  the  Example  Based 
Machine Translation System 
A  Statistical Machine Translation 
language  modeling 
translation  approaches 
Statistical Machine Translation is one of the most widely used 
machine 
the  modern  era  In 
Statistical  Machine  Translation  a  bilingual  corpus  is  trained 
and  statistical  parameters  are  derived  in  order  to  reach  the 
most likely translation Bilingual corpus are readily available 
for  some  languages  whereas  others  used  methods  like 
reputation  based  social  collaboration  1  for  building  the 
corpora20 or from web or any digitized text 21 etc  
  Statistical  Machine  Translation  takes  place  in  three  phases 
namely 
translation  modeling  and 
decoding 
The  language  model  determines  the  probability  of  the  target 
language T which helps in achieving the fluency in the target 
language  and  choosing  the  right  word  in  the  translated 
language It is generally denoted as P T 
The translation model on the other hand helps to compute the 
conditional  probability  of  the  target  language  T  given  the 
source language S generally denoted as P TS  
Finally  in  the  decoding  phase  the  maximum  probability  of 
product of both the language model and the translation model 
is computed which gives the statistically most likely probable 
sentence in the target language

The  notable  systems  in  Indian  perspective  which  uses  the 
Statistical  Machine  Translation  approach  are  English  Hindi 
Machine  Translation  system 
Hyderabad which combines Rule Based Machine Translation 
and  phrase  based  Statistical  Machine  Translation  approach 
Another 
translation  system  was  developed  by  Cochin 
University of Science and Technology for translating English 
to  Malyalam  9  which  used  Statistical  Machine  translation 
approach 
14  developed  by 
A  Example Based Machine Translation System 
Example  Based  Machine  Translation  System  usually  uses 
previous  translation  examples  to  translate  from  source  to 
target  language  The  basic  idea  of  Example  Based  Machine 
Translation  System  is  to  retrieve  examples  of  existing 
translation in its example-base and provide the new translation 
based on that example 
Example Based Machine Translation generally takes place in 
three  phases    Matching  Alignment  and  Recombination  In 
the  Matching  phase  the  system  searches  examples  from  the 
example-base that are similar to the input 
In the Alignment phase the part of the example that is to be 
used is identified and aligned comparing with other examples 
In  the  final  phase  the  reusable  parts  identified  during  the 
alignment  phase  are  put  together  and  produce  the  target 
language 
Machine Translation system in India employing the Example 
based  approach  includes  Vaasaanubaada  4  is  primarily 
targeted  for  Assamese  Bengali  bilingual  translation  of  news 
text  Anubharti  8  developed  at  IIT  Kanpur  is  a  hybrid 
Example  based  system  which  combines  pattern  based  and 
example based approach Another notable system which uses 
the example based approach is the Shiva Machine Translation 
system  14  developed  by  IIIT  Hyderabad  and  Carnegie 
Mellon University USA

In this paper we discussed and looked at the various Machine 
Translation  Systems  in  India  along  with  their  features  We 
also  discussed  the  various  approaches  that  are  applied  for 
building a machine translation system Many researchers and 
research  groups  have  come  up  with  different  translation 
systems  applying  different  approaches  Though  many 
languages are yet to be covered under Machine Translation in 
India  significant  research  and  work  has  been  going  on  to 
include  many  of  the  languages  Many  languages  and  it  is 
believed  that  in  a  few  years  time  most  of  the  major  Indian 
languages  will  be  covered  under  the  Machine  translation 
ambit
