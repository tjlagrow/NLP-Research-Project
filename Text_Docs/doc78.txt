We theoretically investigate the eciency of initial binding between a receptor-coated sphere
and a ligand-coated wall in linear shear ow The mean rst passage time for binding decreases
monotonically with increasing shear rate Above a saturation threshold of the order of a few 100
receptor patches the binding eciency is enhanced only weakly by increasing their number and
size but strongly by increasing their height This explains why white blood cells in the blood ow
adhere through receptor patches localized to the tips of microvilli and why malaria-infected red
blood cells form elevated receptor patches knobs
Cohesion in biological systems and biotechnological ap-
plications is usually provided by specic bonds between
receptors and ligands The formation of these bonds re-
quires a physical transport process which brings recep-
tors and ligands to sucient proximity for binding On
the cellular level one of the most prominent examples is
the binding of blood-born cells to the vessel walls under
the conditions of hydrodynamic ow For white blood
cells initial binding to the vessel walls is the rst step in
their hunt for pathogens which is then followed by rolling
adhesion rm arrest and extravasation 1 Similar pro-
cesses are used by stem and cancer cells which travel the
body with the blood stream Initiating binding to ves-
sel walls is also essential for malaria-infected red blood
cells in order to avoid clearance by the spleen and pos-
sibly also to foster rupture and release of new parasites
into the blood stream 2 Similar questions about initial
binding under ow conditions arise for bacteria eg when
binding to the intestinal wall 3 and in biotechnological
applications eg for adhesion-based cell sorting 4 In
order to control shear ow and cell density in a quanti-
tative way a standard setup are ow chambers 5 An
essential but largely unexplored aspect of these processes
is receptor geometry that is size height and separation
distance of the receptor patches One way to address this
issue experimentally is the use of receptor-coated beads
Earlier theoretical eorts in this context have been fo-
cused mainly on issues related to white blood cells in-
cluding modelling of the initiation of adhesion at high
cell densities eg due to hydrodynamic interactions 7
and the process of rolling adhesion 8
In these stud-
ies the parameters characterizing receptor-ligand bind-
ing are usually xed at physiologically motivated values
In this Letter we take a more general view and ask how
a variable receptor geometry aects cell capture in hy-
drodynamic ow In order to study this issue in a sys-
tematic way we spatially resolve receptors and ligands
The cell is modeled as a rigid spherical Brownian par-
ticle in linear shear ow carrying receptors for ligands
covering a planar boundary wall In the absence of inter-
actions with other particles or external forces there is no
FIG 1 A cell of radius R moves in linear shear ow above a
wall at a height z subject to hydrodynamic gravitational and
thermal forces The eciency for initiating binding is assessed
by calculating the mean rst passage time for approach of
receptor and ligand to a capture distance r0 that is for overlap
of the gray regions Three models of increasing complexity
are studied here a homogeneous coverage of cell and wall

with radius rp and c ligand patches of radius rd separated
by distance d
reason for such a particle to drift towards the wall and
initial binding has to rely completely on thermal diu-
sion In order to arrive at a generic model we consider
the simplest of the possible downward driving forces in
experiments with ow chambers namely gravity The
particle is set free at a certain height above the wall and
we calculate the mean rst passage time MFPT for the
rst receptor-ligand encounter as a measure for the e-
cieny of initial cell binding We consider three models of
increasing complexity in regard to the spatial distribu-
tion of receptors and ligands We rst show that if the
receptors on the cell and the ligands on the substrate are
distributed homogeneously then the corresponding MF-
PTs can be calculated exactly In the case that receptors
are spatially resolved we use extensive computer sim-
ulations to calculate the MFPTs as a function of their
number and spatial dimensions both in two and three
dimensions As a third case we in addition consider spa-
tially resolved ligand distribution
Fig 1 introduces the parameters of our model We con-
sider a sphere of radius R which moves with the hydro-
dynamic ow in positive x-direction at a height z above
the wall with normal ez The simplest possible ow pat-
tern is linear shear ow with shear rate  With the
no-slip boundary condition at the wall the unperturbed
velocity prole reads u  zex For a typical cell ra-
dius R  5 m and a typical shear rate   100 Hz
the Reynolds number in aqueous solution is well below 1
and the hydrodynamic ow is essentially described by the
Stokes equation for incompressible uids This is even
more true for smaller particles like micron-sized beads
Scaling estimates also show that for typical parameter
values for cell elasticity deformations due to shear ow
and lubrication forces are small and therefore the spher-
ical approximation is justied In addition to the hydro-
dynamic forces in our model there are also gravitational
and thermal forces acting on the particle Such a combi-
nation of forces is the subject of Stokesian Dynamics 9
and in our case leads to the following Langevin equation

The subscript t denotes random variables As usual the
thermal force gt is assumed to be Gaussian

The superscript S for the multiplicative noise term in
Eq 1 indicates that it has to be interpreted in the usual
Stratonovich sense The matrix B in Eq 1 is related
to the mobility matrix M through M  BBT  Vectors in
Eq 1 are six-dimensional representing the spatial and
orientational degrees of freedom The mobility matrix M
and the shear force FS for a spherical particle above a
wall cannot be obtained in analytically closed form How-
ever they can be calculated numerically to high accuracy
and we will use this for our simulations 11
Considering the physical dimensions of our problem
shows that the motion of the cell is essentially governed
by two dimensionless numbers For length the nat-
ural scale is cell radius R Mobility and shear force
scale as M  16R and F S  6R2  respec-
tively For time there are two relevant time scales
the deterministic time scale 1  and the diusive time
scale R2D  6R3kBTa where we have used the
Einstein relation D  M kBTa for the diusion con-
stant D Therefore the relative importance of hydro-
dynamic to thermal motion is described by the Peclet
number P e  6R3 kBTa In the limits P e  0 and
P e   diusive and deterministic motion dominate
respectively The gravitational force introduces another
dimensionless number which we call the Peclet number

In the following we will non-dimensionalize length and
time by R and 6R3kBTa respectively

We start by considering homogeneous coverage of cell
and wall with receptors and ligands respectively com-
pare Fig 1a Then rotational degrees of freedom are
irrelevant Because the wall breaks the symmetry only
in the z-direction motion in the x-y-plane is decoupled
from our problem Thus in this case we essentially deal
with a MFPT in one dimension which is independent
of shear rate  and which can be approached with stan-
dard methods for the appropriate Fokker-Planck equa-
tion Binding is identied with approach of receptor and
ligand to a capture distance r0 Applied to the case of
homogeneous coverage the cell has to fall to the capture
height 1  r0 If dropped from the initial height z0 the
respective MFPT can be shown to be
P ez Z z0
Thus the MFPT scales inversely with the gravitational
force driving the cell onto the wall With the lubrication
approximation Mzzz  1  1z we nd
P ez cid20z0  1  r0  lncid18 z0  1
r0 cid19cid21 
Thus the MFPT diverges logarithmically with vanishing
capture distance r0 that is when the cell has to get in-
nitely close to the wall and linearly with initial height
z0 that is when the cell starts innitely far away from
the wall Although only the constant force chosen here
results in an analytical result like Eq 4 for other types
of force laws it is straightforward to numerically calculate
corresponding falling times Th 10
We next consider the case of a spatially resolved recep-
tor distribution compare Fig 1b Now the cell is equidis-
tantly covered with Nr receptor patches each with radius
rp and height r0 We rst note that in this case ini-
tial orientation becomes important Moreover now shear
rate  enters the analysis the shear ow increases cell
rotation and for heterogeneous receptor coverage this
strongly inuences when the rst receptor can bind the
rst ligand Because experimentally it is hardly possible
to prepare the initial orientation of the cell in the follow-
ing we average over all possible initial orientations One
can show that the angle-averaged MFPT is the MFPT
to fall from initial height z0 to some intermediate height
zm according to Eq 3 that is independent of orien-
tation plus the angle-averaged MFPT to bind from the
initial height zm In this sense the initial height is not
relevant for our problem and in the following we always
use z0  2 that is the cell has to fall for the distance of
one radius before binding can occur
In Fig 2a and b we show the MFPT as obtained by
extensive computer simulations as a function of Peclet
number P e   and receptor patch number Nr for two
2D and three dimensions 3D respectively Here 2D
mean that translational motion is restricted to the x-z-
plane and rotations are restricted about the y-axis which
allows for much faster simulations Each data point in
Fig 2 is the average of at least 105 simulated trajectories
of the Langevin equation Eq 1 Our simulations are
very time-consuming because with the receptor patches
we resolve objects of typical size 103 that is nm-sized
patches on micron-sized cells From Fig 2 we rst note
that T decreases monotoneously with increasing P e and
that the shear rate does not change the relative sequence
of the curves for dierent Nr Thus the larger shear rate
and the more receptor patches present the more ecient
cell capture The crossover between the diusion- and
convection-dominated regimes does not occur at P e  1
but at much larger values P e  102 Next we note that in
the 2D case Fig 2a for large P e or large Nr all curves
level o to the exact result for homogeneous coverage
from Eq 3 because in these two limits the binding
process eectively becomes rotationally invariant In the
3D-case Fig 2b the homogeneous reference value is
only achieved for large receptor numbers The reason is
that for small numbers of receptors the cell might have
to rotate around the x-axis before a receptor moving on
a circle parallel to the x-z-plane is able to bind a ligand
on the wall Therefore in 3D thermal diusion remains
essential even in the case of large Peclet number
In order to achieve a better understanding of the simu-
lation results shown in Fig 2 it is instructive to decom-
pose the process into periods of falling and rotation re-
spectively A detailed analysis shows that in the 2D-case
this decomposition allows to derive scaling laws for dif-
ferent limits in regard to P e and P ez An important case
is the one of large P ez when the cell is strongly driven
onto the wall Then the binding process can be decom-
posed into a initial falling period described by Eq 3
followed by a purely rotational search for ligand which
is independent of P ez and can be calculated analytically

and T  1NrP e for small and large P e respectively
in excellent agreement with the scaling found in our sim-
ulations In general Eq 5 is a good qualitative descrip-
tion of the 2D data shown in Fig 2
In order to consider the case of spatially resolved lig-
and compare Fig 1c we cover the boundary wall with a
square lattice of circular ligand patches with lattice con-
stant d and patch radius rd Because again the Peclet
number does not change the relative sequence of the dif-
ferent MFPT curves the eciency of initial cell binding
as a function of receptor and ligand geometry can be in-
vestigated in the diusive limit P e  0 Fig 3 shows for
this case that the MFPT saturates both when increasing
receptor coverage by increasing Nr or ligand coverage by
decreasing d A similar saturation behaviour is also found
when increasing receptor and ligand patch sizes rp and
rd Typically the saturation threshold for the parame-
ters used is located at a mean patch-to-patch distance d
of about 017 both in regard with receptors and ligands
For a coverage below the threshold Fig 3 shows that the
MFPT scales like  1Nr  d2 and  1l  d2 in re-
gard to receptor and ligand coverage respectively where
d represents the distance between receptor and ligand
patches respectively This can be understood by noting
that the 1D MFPT for capture by diusion scales  d2
where d is the distance between the two absorbing bound-
aries The saturation eect observed with respect to Nr

fusion which has been implicated before for the eciency
of ligand capture by a cell 12
We nally turn to the eect of the capture distance r0
In Fig 4 we show the MFPT in the diusive limit as a
function of the receptor patch radius rp for r0  103
and r0  102 as well as for three dierent values of Nr
We rst note that the MFPT is much more inuenced by
a change in r0 or Nr then by a change in rp One can
show on geometrical grounds that the two parameters r0
and rp conspire to dene an eective receptor patch size
r0  rp which then in turn determines the probability
for binding This line of reasoning leads to the formula
where a  2tdr0 b  r02 td is a typical diusion
time between binding attempts which scales  1Nr and
Th is the homogeneous result from Eq 3 Eq 6 im-
plies that even for vanishing receptor size the MFPT re-
mains nite due to a nite r0 The lines in Fig 4 show
that this equation can be tted extremely well to the
simulation results Moreover the tted values for a and
b agree roughly with the predicted scaling behaviour
In summary our results show that the eciency for
initiating cell adhesion in hydrodynamic ow is strongly
enhanced by increasing the number of receptor patches
Nr but only up to a saturation threshold An increase of
patch size rp leads only to a weak enhancement of bind-
ing eciency In contrast a strong enhancement results
from increasing the patch height r0 For example for a
few hundred receptor patches an elevation of r0  102
makes initial binding already as ecient as for a homoge-
neously covered cell Strikingly white blood cells are in-
deed characterized by such a receptor geometry because
they are covered with hundreds of protrusions microvilli
typical height 300 nm corresponding to r0  006 which
carry adhesion receptors like L-selectin at their narrow
tips 5 In general white blood cells operate in the limit
of a homogeneously covered cell not only due to their
receptor geometry but also because during capture they
are usually exposed to environments with P e  104 105
a typical value for P ez is 300 The principle of enhanc-
ing capture eciency by elevation of receptor patches
seems to be also used by other biological systems One
example of large medical relevance appears to be malaria-
infected red blood cells which develop thousands of little
adhesive protrusions knobs typical height 20 nm corre-
sponding to r0  0004 2 The results presented here
do not only allow to understand the eciency of cell cap-
ture in these biological systems in a unied way but can
also be used for developing corresponding applications in
biotechnology including adhesion-based cell or particle
sorting
