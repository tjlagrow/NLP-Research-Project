In this series of lectures I review recent observational progress in constraining models of galaxy
formation and evolution highlighting the importance advances in addressing questions of the
assembly history and origin of the Hubble sequence in the context of modern pictures of structure
formation
1 Introduction
These are exciting times to be working on any aspect of studies of galaxies at high
redshift whether observational or theoretical Most would agree that the current period
represents something of a golden era in the subject Figure 1 shows the increasing extent
to which articles concerned with galaxy evolution dominate the published literature over
the past 25 years gauged xenophobically Im afraid by keyword statistics only in two
North American journals
To try and understand the cause for this prominence in the subject the dates associ-
ated with the commissioning of some major observational facilities have been marked
The progress appears to have been driven largely by new kinds of optical and near-
infrared data faint counts and searches for primaeval galaxies in the late 1970s and early
1980s Peterson et al 1979 Tyson  Jarvis 1979 Kron 1980 Koo 1985 faint galaxy red-
shift surveys made possible by multi-object spectrographs in the late 1980s and early
1990s Lilly et al 1995 Ellis et al 1996 Cowie et al 1996 Cohen et al 2000 the launch
of Hubble Space Telescope HST and its revelation of resolved galaxy images to signif-
icant redshifts Griths et al 1994 Glazebrook et al 1995 Brinchmann et al 1998 the
remarkable Hubble Deep Field image Williams et al 1996 and the plethora of papers
that followed Livio Fall  Madau 1998 and the arrival of the Keck telescopes bring-
ing a new wave of faint Lyman-break galaxy spectroscopy at unprecedented redshifts
Steidel et al 1996 Steidel et al 1999
One often hears claims that a subject undergoing spectacular progress is one that is
nearing completion cf Horgan 1997 After all the rise in Figure 1 clearly cannot
continue indenitely and fairly soon it could be argued we will then have solved all of
the essential problems in the subject As if anticipating this a theoretical colleague gave
a recent colloquium at my institute entitled Galaxy Formation End of the Road 
 Lectures given at the XIth Canary Islands Winter School of Astrophysics Galaxies at High
Redshift in November 1999 updated to reect progress in the subject during 2000
 A correlation was also made with three key international conferences Larson  Tinsley 1978
Frenk et al 1988 Livio Fall  Madau 1998 but I was horried to see that these appeared to have
had a negative eect on the communitys output I assume this arose from a much-needed period
of post-conference reection
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
Consider the evidence Observationally we may soon via photometric redshifts have de-
termined the redshift distribution luminosity evolution and spatial clustering of sources
to unprecedented limits
If one accepts photometric redshifts are reliable the rate of
progress in the traditional pursuit of N m color z is limited solely by the eld of view
of the telescope and the exposure times adopted Panchromatic data matching that ob-
tained with optical and near-infrared telescopes from SIRTF FIRST and ALMA will also
enable us unravel the cosmic star formation history SF Rz to unprecedented precision
Madau et al 1996 Blain et al 1999 It has already been claimed that the above data eg
N m color z and SF Rz can be understood in terms of hierarchical models of structure
formation where galaxies assemble through the cooling of baryonic gas into merging cold
dark matter halos CDM Kaumann et al 1994 Baugh et al 1998 Cole et al 2000a
The word concordance was recently coined astrophysically in an article reconciling
dierent estimates of the cosmological parameters Ostriker  Steinhardt 1996 Such
concordance in our understanding of galaxy evolution is a natural consequence of semi-
analytical theories whose sole purpose is to explain the big picture as realised with the
extant galaxy data In this series of lectures I want to show that we have our work cut
out for some considerable time Exciting progress is denitely being made but observers
must rise to the challenge of testing the fundamentals of contemporary theories such as
CDM and theorists must get ready to interpret qualitatively new kinds of data that we
can expect in the next decade
Figure 1 The remarkably rapid growth in galaxy evolution studies the fraction of the
ApJ and AJ literature containing the key word galaxy evolution over the past 25 years
The inset shows the marked decline in the use of galaxies as probes of the cosmological
parameters during 1970-1980 after Brinchmann PhD thesis 1998
These lectures are intended for interested graduate students or postdocs entering the
eld There is an obvious observational avor although I have tried to keep in perspec-
tive an ultimate goal of comparing results with recent CDM predictions The bias is

largely to optical and near-infrared applications there is insucient space to do justice
to the rapidly-developing contributions being made at sub-millimetre radio and X-ray
wavelengths which other contributors at this winter school will cover in detail
2 Galaxy Formation and Cosmology
Traditionally faint galaxies were studied in order to constrain the cosmological world
model Sandage 1961 their evolution was considered just one more tedious correction
the so-called evolutionary correction in the path to the Holy Grail of the deceleration
parameter qo  M 2 in 0 Friedmann models The most useful galaxies in this
respect were giant ellipticals in rich clusters Tinsley 1976 demonstrated how sensitive
the derived q0 was to the assumed main sequence brightening with look-back time in these
populations
The traditional view for the formation history of an elliptical followed Eggen Lynden-
Bell  Sandage 1962 Monolithic collapse and rapid star formation leads to a subsequent
track known as passive evolution ie without further star formation Tinsley showed
that main sequence brightening in such a stellar population is largely governed by the
rate at which stars evolve o the main sequence ie the slope x 1 of the initial mass
function at the typical turno mass 041M Whence
and in terms of its bias on qo
Ez t  d Mvd lnt  13  03 x
 qo  14Ho to1 d Mvd lnt  18  042 x
Tinsley argued that one would have to know the evolutionary correction to remarkable
precision get a secure value of qo In fact noting that the dierence in apparent magnitude
for a standard candle at z1 between an empty and Einstein-de Sitter Universe is only
05 mag the relative importance of cosmology and evolution can be readily gauged
Despite the above it is always a mystery to me why several of our most eminent as-
tronomers Kristian et al 1978 Gunn  Oke 1975 continued to pursue the Hubble dia-
gram as a cosmological probe using rst-ranked cluster galaxies in some cases for several
years after the challenge of resolving the evolutionary correction became known Tam-
mann 1985 estimated about 400 nights nights of Palomar 200-inch time was consumed
by the two competing groups whose resulting values of qo fundamentally disagreed Re-
cently Aragon-Salamanca 1998 showed in a elegant summary of the situation how the
modern K-band Hubble diagram is most likely complicated further by the fact that rst-
ranked cluster galaxies are still assembling their stars over the redshift interval 0 z 1
osetting the main sequence brightening Figure 2
In the late 1970s therefore the motivation for studying faint galaxies became one of
understanding their history rather than using them as tracers of the cosmic expansion
see inset panel in Figure 1 This is not to say that uncertainties in the cosmological
model do not aect the conclusions drawn The connection between cosmology and source
evolutions remains strong in three respects
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
Figure 2 A recent appraisal of the prospects of securing cosmological constraints from
the Hubble diagram of brightest cluster galaxies Aragon-Salamanca et al 1998 Lumi-
nosity evolution is parameterised as L  L0 1  z  For qo0 the top panel shows
residuals and best t trend applying k-correction and luminosity distance eects only no
luminosity evolution is seen The middle and bottom panels show the residuals when evo-
lution is modeled for single burst populations formed at zF 2 and 5 respectively High z
galaxies are less luminous than expected presumably because they are still accreting mate-
rial Quantitatively the eect amounts to a factor of 2-4 less stellar mass depending on
the assumed qo cf van Dokkum et al 1999
a We use our knowledge of stellar evolution to predict the past appearance of stellar
populations in galaxies observed at high redshift However stellar evolution is baselined in
physical time the conventional unit is the Gyr 109yr whereas we observe distant sources
in redshift units The mapping of time and redshift depends on the world model Broadly
speaking there is less time for the necessary changes to occur in a high M universe and
consequently evolutionary trends are much stronger in such models
b Many evolutionary tests depend on the numbers of sources the most familiar being
the number-magnitude count which is remarkably sensitive to small changes in source lu-
minosity However the relativistic volume element dV z depends sensitively on curvature
being much larger in open and accelerating Universes than in the Einstein-de Sitter case
c Predictions for the mass assembly history of a galaxy in hierarchical models depend
also on the cosmological model in a fairly complex manner since these models jointly
satisfy constraints concerned with the normalisation of the mass power spectrum via the
present abundance of clusters eg Baugh et al 1998 Figure 3 illustrates one aspect of
this dependence Kaumann  Charlot 1998 structure grows more rapidly in a dense
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
Universe so the decline with redshift in the abundance of massive spheroidal galaxies
which are thought in this picture to forms via mergers of smaller systems is much more
marked in high density models than in open or accelerating Universes
Figure 3 The abundance of massive 1011M systems as a function of redshift in
two hierarchical models Kaumann  Charlot 1998 showing the strong decline in a high
density  CDM model cf that in a low density accelerating model CDM
Fortunately we are making excellent progress in constraining the cosmological parame-
ters from independent methods the most prominent of which include the angular uctu-
ation spectrum in the microwave background de Bernardis et al 2000 Balbi et al 2000
the Hubble diagram of distant Type Ia supernovae Garnavich et al 1998 Perlmutter et al 1999
the abundance of rich clusters at various epochs Bahcall  Fan 1998 and the redshift-
space distortion in large redshift surveys such as 2dF Peacock et al 2000
Given it matters how then should we respond to the widely-accepted concordance in
the determination of Ho M   from various probes Ostriker  Steinhardt 1996 Bahcall
1999 The claimed convergence on the value of Hubbles constant Mould et al 2000
is not so important for the discussion below since most evolutionary tests are primarily
concerned with relative comparisons at various look-back times where Ho cancels The
most bewildering aspect of the concordance picture is the resurrection of a non-zero 
the evidence for which comes primarily from the Hubble diagram for Type Ia supernovae
As a member of the Supernova Cosmology Project Perlmutter et al 1999 I obviously
take the supernova results seriously However this does not prevent me from being sur-
prised as to the implications of a non-zero  The most astonishing fact is how readily
the community has apparently accepted the resurrection of  - a term for which there
is no satisfactory physical explanation cf Wang et al 2000 To one poorly-understand
component of the cosmic energy density non-baryonic dark matter we seem to have
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
added another vacuum energy It seems a remarkable coincidence that all three signif-
icant constituents B DM   are comparable in magnitude to within a factor of 10
and hardly a step forward that only one is physically understood
The lesson I think we should draw from the cosmic concordance is similar to the comment
I made in 1 when we discussed some theorists triumphant reconciliation of their theories
with faint galaxy data a point we will debate in detail in 3 In both cases the hypothesis
certainly reproduces a wide range of observations but note it takes as input parameters
for which there is not yet a clear physical model One should not therefore regard
a concordant picture as anything other than one of many possible working hypotheses
In the case of the cosmological models we need to invest eort into understanding the
physical nature of dark matter and vacuum energy In the case of galaxy evolution our
goal should be to test the basic ingredients of hierarchical galaxy formation
3 Star Formation Histories
One of the most active areas of relevance to understanding the rate at which galaxies
assemble is concerned with determining the cosmic star formation history The idea is
simple enough A systematic survey is conducted according to some property that is
sensitive to the on-going rate of star formation The volume-average luminosity density is
converted into its equivalent star formation rate averaged per unit co-moving volume and
the procedure repeated as a function of redshift to give the cosmic star formation history
z In this section we will explore the uncertainties and also the signicance of this
considerable area of current activity in terms of the constraints they provide on theories
of galaxy formation
The joint distribution of luminosity L and redshift z N L z for a ux-limited sample
permits the construction of the luminosity function L according to procedures which
are reviewed by Efstathiou Ellis  Peterson 1988 and compared by Ellis 1997  The
luminosity function is often characterised according to the form dened by Schechter
1976 viz
L dLL   LL expLL dLL
in which case the integrated number of galaxies per unit volume N and the luminosity
density L then becomes
N  Z L dL     1
L  Z L L dL   L   2
and the source counts in the non-relativistic case applicable to local catalogs is
N  m  d 3mZ dL L LL

Frequently-used measures of star formation in galaxies over a range of redshift include
rest-frame ultraviolet and blue broad-band luminosities Lilly et al 1995 Steidel et al 1996
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
Sullivan et al 2000 nebular emission lines such as H Gallego et al 1995 Tresse 
Maddox 1998 Glazebrook et al 1999 thermal far-infrared emission from dust clouds
Rowan-Robinson et al 1997 Blain et al 1999 and most recently radio continuum emis-
sion Mobasher et al 1999
Since only a limited range of the luminosity function centered on L is reliably probed
in ux-limited samples a key issue is how well the integrated luminosity density L can
be determined from such surveys In the Schechter formalism equations 34 and 35
show that whilst N would diverge for  1 the luminosity density is convergent unless

Figure 4 The luminosity function for galaxies selected at 2000 A from the recent survey
of Sullivan et al 2000 The histogram and associated numbers indicate the absolute
magnitude distribution observed which is corrected by volume and k-correction eects to
give the data points The dotted curve illustrates the considerable eect of extinction
as gauged by Balmer decrements determined individually for those galaxies with emission
lines Such uncertainties translate in factors of two uncertainty in the local UV luminosity
density
Figure 4 shows the local rest-frame ultraviolet 2000 A  luminosity function from Sulli-
van et al 2000 whose faint end slope 16 is markedly steeper than that found for sam-
ples selected in the near-infrared Mobasher et al 1993 Gardner et al 1997 Cole et al 2000b
where  -1 This contrast in the luminosity distribution of young and old stellar pop-
ulations is an important result which emphasizes the relatively weak connection between
stellar mass and light and implies there may be signicant uncertainties in the estimation
of integrated luminosity densities for star-forming populations
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
Kennicutt 1998 carefully reviewed the relationships between the various observational
diagnostics listed above and the star formation rate Clearly a major uncertainty in
any transformation based on the ultravioletoptical continuum or nebular emission line
measures is the likely presence of absorbing dust Figure 4 Other uncertainties include
the form of the initial stellar mass function and the nature of the star formation history
itself
Figure 5 Star formation rates derived from UV 2000 A  continua versus those derived
from H uxes from the local survey of Sullivan et al 2000 open squares and the z 1
samples of Glazebrook et al 1999 large stars For the Sullivan et al sample extinction
corrections were derived from individual Balmer decrements assuming Case B recombina-
tion and applied to the H uxes in the upper panel and both estimates in the lower panel
Some of these uncertainties are quite imponderable and the only way to estimate their
eect in typical populations is to undertake a comparison of the various diagnostics for
the same sample Sullivan et al 2000 compared UV and H-based estimators for their
local balloon-based UV-selected sample and Glazebrook et al 1999 undertook a similar
comparison for a restricted incomplete sample of high redshift galaxies drawn from a
I-selected sample Bell  Kennicutt 2000 independently examined some of Sullivan et
als conclusions based on a smaller local sample with satellite UV uxes The comparison
analysed by Sullivan et al is shown in Figure 5 Although an overall linear relation is
observed the scatter is quite considerable greater than accountable from observational
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
errors The uncertainties would appear to be alarming in view of the fairly modest trends
claimed in SF Rz see below
In addition to the scatter arising from extinction accounted for via individual Balmer
emission line decrements Sullivan et al suggest that some fraction of their UV-selected
population must be suering star formation which is erratic in its time history In such a
situation dierent diagnostics will be sensitive to bursts of activity for dierent periods
corresponding to the time over which the contributing stars remain on the main sequence
H ux arises from recombination photons linked to those emitted below the Lyman limit
from main sequence stars with lifetimes 106 years The UV and blue continua persist
for much longer periods  108  109 years
Depending upon how widespread star formation histories of this kind may be two forms
of error may arise in estimating cosmic star formation histories Firstly the star formation
rate derived for an individual galaxy will be a past time average smoothing over any erratic
behavior rather than a true instantaneous value More importantly however particularly
at high redshift galaxies may be preferentially selected only if their star formation history
is erratic for example in H surveys where some threshold of detectability may seriously
restrict the samples
Figure 6 shows a recent estimate of the cosmic star formation history drawn from various
surveys Blain 2000 There appears to be a marked increase in activity over 0 z 1 with
a possible decline beyond z 2 Although inevitably perhaps attention has focused on
the case for the high redshift decline even the strong rise to z 1 remains controversial
Originally proposed independently by Lilly et al 1995 and Fall et al 1996 revised
estimates for the local luminosity density Sullivan et al 2000 and independent surveys
Cowie et al 1999 have challenged the rapidity of this rise Part of the problem is that
no single survey permits a self-consistent measurement of SF R over more than a very
limited range in z Most likely therefore much of the scatter in Figure 6 is simply a
manefestation of the kinds of uncertainties discussed above in the context of Sullivan et
als survey
Beyond z2 the available star formation rates have been derived almost exclusively
from UV continua in Lyman break galaxies selected by their dropout signatures in vari-
ous photometric bands Madau et al 1996 Steidel et al 1996 Steidel et al 1999 and from
currently scant datasets of sub-mm sources interpreted assuming thermal emission from
dust heated by young stars Blain et al 1999 Barger et al 1999b There has been much
discussion on the possible disparity between the estimates derived from these two diagnos-
tics which other lecturers will address Two points can be made rstly the measured
UV luminosity densities will clearly underestimate the true values given likely extinctions
Secondly the sample of sub-mm sources with reliable redshifts remains quite inadequate
for luminosity density estimates in the sense described above Most of the constraints arise
from modelling their likely properties in a manner consistent with their source counts and
the integrated far-infrared background
Have we become over-obsessed with determining the cosmic star formation history
Observers are eager to place their survey points alongside others on the overall curve and
dierent groups defend their methods against those whose data points disagree We should
consider carefully what role this cosmic star formation history plays in understanding how
galaxies form
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
Figure 6 The history of recent star formation from the recent compilation of Blain
2000 Data points are taken from a variety of sources referenced in that article Thick
solid and dashed lines represent trends expected from simple luminosity evolution and hi-
erarchical models respectively It is clear there is considerable observational scatter at all
redshifts not just beyond z 1 as often assumed
Clearly the prime conclusion we can draw from Figure 6 is that the stars which make
the galaxies we see today formed continuously over a very wide redshift range This
may seem such an obvious deduction that it hardly merits stating but it is important to
stress the absence of any obvious detectable epoch of star formation as was once imag-
ined Eggen Lynden-Bell  Sandage 1962 Frenk et al 1988 Hierarchical modelers were
quick to point out eg Baugh et al 1998 that they predicted extended star formation
histories as early as 1990 White  Frenk 1991 It is certainly true that a continuous
assembly of galaxies is a major feature of these models and thus one supported by the
However what about the quantitative form of Figure 6 which remains so dicult to pin
down does the shape of the curve really matter Firstly we should recognise that the
luminosity density integrates over much detailed astrophysics that may be important A
particular SF R at a given redshift could be consistent either with a population of estab-
lished massive sources undergoing modest continous star formation or a steep luminosity
function where most of the activity is in newly-formed dwarf galaxies In terms of struc-
ture formation theories these are very dierent physical situations yet that distinction is
lost in Figure 6
Secondly theoretically the cosmic star formation history is not particularly closely
related to how galaxies assemble It is more sensitive to the rate at which gas cools into
the assembling dark matter halos a process of considerable interest but which involves
a myriad of uncertain astrophysical processes Figure 7 which are fairly detached from
the underlying physical basis of say the hierarchical picture In support of this we should
note that Baugh et al 1999 were able within the same -dominated CDM model to
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
rene their earlier prediction to match new high redshift datapoints revealing a much
less marked decline beyond z2
Figure 7 An illustration of the complex physical processes governing the star formation
rate of a young galaxy courtesy of Carlos Frenk Star formation is governed by the rate
at which baryonic gas cools and falls into dark matter halos and this is inhibited by heating
eg from supernovae The precise form of the cosmic star formation history gives us more
insight into the interplay between these processes integrated over all star-forming galaxies
than in distinguishing between various forms of structure formation eg hierarchical vs
monolithic
4 Morphological Data from HST
As we discussed in 1 one of the most exciting new datasets that arrived in the
mid-1990s was the rst set of resolved images of galaxies at signicant look-back times
from HST Much of the early work was conducted in rich clusters Couch et al 1994
Dressler et al 1994 Couch et al 1998 Dressler et al 1998 where the well-known Butcher-
Oemler eect Butcher  Oemler 1978 - a surprisingly recent increase in the fraction of
blue cluster members - was found to be due to a dramatic shift in the morphology-density
relation Figure 8 As recently as z 03-04 3-4 Gyr ago cluster S0s were noticeably
fewer in proportion their place apparently taken by spirals many of which showed signs
of recent disturbances such a distorted arms and tidal tails
The physical origin of this transformation from spirals to S0s remains unclear and
is currently being explored by detailed spectroscopy of representative cluster members
Barger et al 1996 Abraham et al 1996b Poggianti et al 1999 A key diagnostic here is
the interplay between the changing morphologies the presence of nebular emission lines
such as O II 3727 A  H is generally redshifted out of the accessible range and Balmer
absorption lines such as H 4101 A  The latter lines are prominent in main sequence A
stars which linger for 1 Gyr after any enhanced starburst activity

Dressler et al 1998

distant HST clusters with 03 z 055 The comparison refers to the same cluster
core radius 06Mpch05 and includes galaxies to the same rest-frame V luminosity
MV -200 Note the dramatic decline in the S0 population and the marked increase in
the spiral fraction for environments with high projected density
Barger et al 1996 proposed a simple cycle where an unsuspecting galaxy undergoes
some perturbation perhaps due to a merger or its rst encounter with the intracluster
gas subsequently becomes morphologically-distorted and spectrally-active before subsid-
ing to a regular spheroidal with a decaying Balmer absorption line Whereas such a cycle
can explain the proportion of unusual objects it has diculty matching their luminosi-
ties A galaxy should be rendered more luminous during a burst and thus blue examples
cannot easily be the precursors of the equally-luminous red post-burst cases A contro-
versy has since arisen over the fractions of objects seen in the various spectrally-active
classes Balogh et al 1999 suggesting much work is needed in this area both in quantify-
ing cluster-cluster variations and also radial variations in the responsible processes
Although the cluster work discussed above represents something of a digression in
our overall theme the realisation that galaxies can so easily be transformed morpho-
logically has profound implications for our understanding of galaxy formation Much of
the early work explaining the Hubble sequence Tinsley 1977 assumed galaxies evolve
as isolated systems however the abundance of morphologically-peculiar and interact-
ing galaxies in early HST images Griths et al 1994 has been used to emphasize the
important role that galaxy mergers must play in shaping the present Hubble sequence
Toomre  Toomre 1972 Barnes  Hernquist 1992 Merger-induced transformations of
this kind are a natural consequence of hierarchical models Baugh Cole  Frenk 1996
Early disk systems are prone to merge during epochs when the cosmic density is high and
the peculiar velocity eld is cold forming bulge-dominated and spheroidal systems which
may then later accrete disks
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
The possibility that galaxies transform from one class to another is a hard hypothesis
to verify observationally since as we have seen traditionally observers have searched for
redshift-dependent trends with subsets of the population chosen via an observed property
color morphology spectral characteristics which could be transient Moreover experi-
ence ought to teach us that the outcome of tests of galaxy formation rarely come down
simply to either Theory A or Theory B usually it is some complicated mixture or the ques-
tion was naive in the rst place Fortunately the late formation of massive regular galaxies
in the hierarchical picture Figure 9 seems a particularly robust prediction and one in
stark contrast to the classical monolithic collapse picture Tinsley 1977 Sandage 1983
The distinction is greatest for ellipticals presumed to form at high redshift with minimum
dissipation their central density reecting that of the epoch of formation Studying the
evolutionary history of massive ellipticals is thus an obvious place to start
Figure 9 The important role of late merging in a typical CDM semi-analytical model
Baugh et al 1996 The panels show the redshift-dependent growth for the stellar mass
left and that of all baryonic material right as indicated by the thickness of the black area
at a given epoch for two present-day massive galaxies The top system grows gradually and
is thought to represent a present-day spiral The bottom system suers a late equal-mass
merger thought to produce a present-day elliptical Note the remarkably late assembly
most of stellar mass in both cases assembles in the interval 0 z 1
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
An oft-quoted result in support of old ellipticals is the remarkable homogeneity of their
optical colors Sandage  Visvanathan 1978 Bower et al 1992 The idea is simple the
intrinsic population scatter in a color sensitive to recent star formation such as U  B
places a constraint either on how synchronous the previous star formation history must
have been across the population or if galaxies form independently the mean age of
their stellar populations By combining cluster data at low redshift Bower et al 1992
with HST-selected samples at intermediate redshift Ellis et al 1998 the bulk of the
cluster elliptical population was deduced to have formed its stars before z2 in appar-
ent conict with hierarchical models Similar conclusions have been drawn from evolu-
tion of the masslight ratio deduced from the fundamental plane Ziegler  Bender 1997
van Dokkum et al 1998
Unfortunately one cannot generalize from the results found in distant clusters
hierarchical models clusters represent early peaks in the density uctuations and thus
evolution is likely accelerated in these environments Kaumann 1995 plus of course
there may be processes peculiar to these environments involving the intracluster gas It is
also important to distinguish between the history of mass assembly and that of the stars
Recent evidence for widespread merging of ellipticals in clusters van Dokkum et al 1999
lends support to the idea that the stars in dense regions were formed at high redshift in
lower mass systems which later merged
For these reasons attention has recently switched to tracking the evolution of eld
ellipticals The term eld elliptical is something of a misnomer here since a high fraction
of ellipticals actually reside in clusters What is really meant in this case is that we prefer
to select ellipticals systematically in ux-limited samples rather than concentrate on those
found in the cores of dense clusters
The study of evolution in eld ellipticals is currently very active and I cannot possibly
do justice in the space available to the many complex issues being discussed Instead let
me summarise what I think are the most interesting results
 Searches for a population of faint intrinsically red objects representing the expected
z 1 precursors of passively-evolving ellipticals which formed their stars at high red-
shift have been conducted both with and without HST morphological data Zepf 1997
Barger et al 1999a Menanteau et al 1999 Daddi et al 2000 McCarthy et al 2000 How-
ever only recently have substantial areas of sky been mapped This is because such
searches are most sensitive to high z sources when conducted using optical-near infrared
colors and access to large infrared arrays is a recent technical development Both Daddi et
al 2000 and McCarthy et al 2000 Figure 10 claim strong angular clustering in their
faint red populations and there is limited evidence that the abundance is consistent with
a constant comoving number density in contrast to the hierarchical predictions How-
ever without conrmatory spectroscopy neither the redshift range nor the nature of these
red sources is yet clear Even if it later emerges as was claimed on far less convincing
data Zepf 1997 Barger et al 1999a Menanteau et al 1999 that there is a shortage of
intrinsically red objects beyond z 1 only a modest amount of residual star formation
is needed to substantially bluen a well-established old galaxy Jimenez et al 1999 Even
 A major concern in all the work relating to the evolution of galaxies in clusters is precisely
how the clusters were located
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
when redshift data is secured color alone may be an unreliable way to track a specic
population
Figure 10 Evidence for a clustered population of red objects in a 1000 arcmin2 area of
the ongoing Las Campanas Infrared Survey McCarthy et al 2000 The angular correla-
tion function for objects with I  H 35 top set of data points is substantially above
that for all H-selected galaxies bottom set and consistent with a high fraction of the red
objects being clustered ellipticals with z 10-15
 At brighter magnitudes systematic redshift surveys with associated HST data give
constraints on the luminosity function and colors of morphologically-selected ellipticals
Brinchmann et al 1998 Schade et al 1999 Menanteau et al 1999 Im et al 2000 Unfor-
tunately because of the disparity in eld of view betweeen WFPC-2 and the ground-based
multislit spectrographs the samples remain small and hence the conclusions are subject
to signicant eld-to-eld clustering uncertainties However no substantial decline in
the volume density of ellipticals is yet observed to z 1 although there is some dispute
as to the fraction which may deviate in color from the passive track Im et al 2000 cf
Menanteau et al 1999 Current spectroscopic surveys may not be quite deep enough to
critically test the expected evolution in the hierarchical models particularly if  60
 A completely independent method of determining whether eld ellipticals form conti-
nously as expected in hierarchical models is possible in the Hubble Deep Fields Menanteau
et al 2000 Here the imaging signalnoise is sucient to permit an examination of the
internal colors of ellipticals with I 24 a subset of which have redshifts Menanteau et
al 2000 nd about 25 of the HDF ellipticals show blue cores and other color inho-
mogeneities suggestive of recent star formation perhaps as a result of the merger with a
gas-rich low mass galaxy Keck spectroscopy Ellis et al 2001 supports this suggestion
galaxies with blue cores generally show emission and absorption line features indicative
of star formation Figure 11 The amount of blue light seen in the aected ellipticals
can be used to quantify the amount of recent star formation and the associated spectrum

can be used to estimate the timescale of activity through diagnostic features of main se-
quence stars Only modest accretion rates of 10 by mass over 1 Gyr are implied
albeit for a signicant fraction of the population This continued growth whilst mod-
est cf expectations of hierarchical models is noticeably less prominent in rich clusters

What evolution is found in the properties of other kinds of galaxy Brinchmann et al
1998 secured HST images for a sizeable and statistically-complete subset of CFRS and
LDSS redshift survey galaxies and found the abundance of spirals to I22 - a ux limit
which samples 03 z 08 - is comparable to that expected on the basis of their local abun-
dance if their disks were somewhat brighter and bluer in the past as evidenced from surface
photometry Lilly et al 1999 In practice however the detectability of spiral disks is af-
fected by a number of possible selection eects Simard et al 1999 Bouwens  Silk 2000
and it may be some time before a self-consistent picture emerges
A less controversial result from Brinchmann et al 1998 claimed in earlier analyses
without redshift data Glazebrook et al 1995 Driver et al 1995 is the remarkably high
abundance of morphologically-peculiar galaxies in faint HST data Brinchmann et al
quantied this in terms of the luminosity density arguing that a substantial fraction of the
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
claimed decline in the blue luminosity density since z 1 cf Figure 6 arises from the
demise of this population Figure 12
Figure 12 The morphological dependence of the blue luminosity density from that sub-
set of the CFRSLDSS redshift survey imaged with HST Brinchmann et al 1998 The
marked decline in the luminosity density of galaxies with peculiar morphology over 0 z 1
is the primary cause for steep slope in the blue faint galaxy counts
Given our earlier concerns with over-interpreting the cosmic star formation history
should we be cautious in drawing conclusions from Figure 12 Although Brinchmann et
als redshift sample is small the basic result is consistent with the HST morphological
number counts where much larger samples are involved Whereas early skeptics argued
that morphologically-peculiar galaxies represent regular systems viewed at unfamiliar ul-
traviolet wavelengths recent NICMOS imaging see Dickinsons lectures suggests such
morphological bandshifting is only of minor consequence In quantitative detail as be-
fore uncertain corrections must be made for the eects of the ux limited sample and of
course extinction is a major uncertainty However it seems inescapable that the bulk of
the decline in blue light the so-called faint blue galaxy problem Ellis 1997 arises from the
demise of a population of late-type and morphologically-peculiar systems A key question
therefore is what happened to this population We will address this problem in the next
section
5 Constraining the Masses of Distant Galaxies
A recurring issue arises from the discussions in the earlier sections Whilst observers
are with some restrictions able to measure distant galaxy properties such as rest-frame
colors luminosities and star formation rates these may be poor indications of the under-
lying stellar and total masses predicted most straightforwardly by contemporary models
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
of structure formation Either we put our faith in the forward modelling of the readily-
available observables ie we invest a lot of eort in understanding the complexities of
feedback Figure 7 or we consider how to measure galactic masses
Ideally we seek methods for determining the total mass baryonic plus the dark matter
halo but this seems out of reach for the moment except for local systems with tracers of
the larger halo in which galaxies are thought to reside Useful tracers here include the dy-
namical properties of attendant dwarf galaxies Zaritsky et al 1998 and globular clusters
Huchra et al 1998 A promising route in the future might be galaxy-galaxy gravitational
lensing Blandford  Narayan 1992 Here a foreground population is restricted in its se-
lection perhaps according to morphology or redshift and the statistical image distortions
in a background population analysed Early results were based on HST data for clus-
ter spheroidals Natarajan et al 1999 and various eld populations Griths et al 1996
however with extensive panoramic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey convincing sig-
nals can be seen with ground-based photometry Fischer et al 2000 Again photometric
redshifts will be helpful in rening the sample selection and in determining the precise
redshift distribution essential for accurate measures on an absolute scale
Unfortunately promising though the technique appears the restrictions of galaxy-galaxy
lensing are numerous
It only gives mass estimates for statistical samples the signal
is too weak to be detected in individual cases unless a strong lensing feature is seen
Hogg et al 1996 Moreover the redshift range and physical scale on which the mass is
determined is dened entirely by geometrical factors and ultimately one may never be
able to apply the method to galaxies beyond z 1
Extensive dynamical data is becoming available for restricted classes of high redshift
galaxy via linewidth measures Koo et al 1995 resolved rotation curves Vogt et al 1997
for sources with detectable O II 3727 A emission and via internal stellar velocity disper-
sions for absorption line galaxies such as spheroidals Under certain assumptions these
give mass estimates and have enabled the construction of the fundamental plane for distant
spheroidals Treu et al 2000 and the Tully-Fisher relation for high redshift disk galaxies
Vogt et al 1997 The greatest progress in the former has been in constructing the funda-
mental plane in rich clusters van Dokkum et al 1998 where slow evolution in the inferred
masslight ratio for cluster ellipticals is consistent with a high redshift of formation see
5 For the emission line studies it is not straightforward to convert data obtained over a
limited spatial extent into reliable masses even for regular well-ordered systems For com-
pact and irregular sources the required emission lines may come from unrepresentative
components yielding poor mass estimates Lehnert  Heckman 1996
The prospects improve signicantly if we drop the requirement to measure the total mass
and are willing to consider only the stellar mass In this case the near-infrared luminosity
is of particular importance Broadhurst et al 1992 and Kaumann  Charlot 1998
have demonstrated that the K 2m luminosity is a good measure of its underlying
stellar mass regardless of how that mass assembled itself Figure 13 This remarkable
fact arises because K-band light in all stellar populations whether induced in bursts or
continuous periods of activity arises from long-lived giants whose collective output mirrors
the amount of past activity smoothing over its production timetable
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
Figure 13 The K-band luminosity is a good measure of the underlying stellar mass
irrespective the past star formation history Kaumann  Charlot 1998 The curves
show the observed K magnitude as a function of the redshift at which such an object is
selected for a system containing 1011M produced according to a variety of star formation
histories Even across extreme cases single burst at z   solid line to a constant
star formation rate to the epoch of observation short-dash the K-band output remains
the same to within a factor of 2 The lower panel shows how dierent the observed
optical-infrared color would be in these cases
A deep K-band redshift survey thus probes the very existence of massive systems at early
times A slightly incomplete survey to K20 Cowie et al 1996 and a complete photo-
metric survey to K21 Fontana et al 1999 indicates an apparently shortfall of luminous
K objects beyond z 1-15 cf pure luminosity evolution models Unfortunately small
sample sizes eld-to-eld clustering spectroscopic incompleteness and untested photo-
metric redshift techniques beyond z1 each weaken this potentially important conclusion
An important goal in the immediate future must be to reconcile these claims with the
apparently abundant and hence conicting population of optical-infrared red objects to
K 19-20 Daddi et al 2000 McCarthy et al 2000
The precision of the technique introduced by Kaumann  Charlot 1998 can be im-
proved if the optical-infrared color is available as an extra parameter Ellis et al 2000
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution

In this way a rst-order correction can be made for the past star formation history and
hence the eect of the spread in the lower panel of Figure 13 can be used to improve the
mass estimate Importantly such a technique for determine accurate stellar masses can
then be applied to all galaxies regular or peculiar irrespective of their dynamical state
and over a range in redshift providing the data is suciently precise The technique
can be considered as a modication of that frequently utilised in estimating photometric
redshifts The observed optical-infrared SED for an object of known redshift is used to
optimally t the stellar mass rather than the redshift in the framework of an evolutionary
synthesis code Stellar masses can be derived to within a random uncertainty of 30-50
by this technique although at present there is no reliable way to verify the results except
by comparison with independent dynamical measures Figure 14
Figure 15 Evolution of the stellar mass density starsz T  from the analysis of Brinch-
mann  Ellis 2000 A remarkable decline with time in stellar mass density is seen for
the morphologically-peculiar class which argues against a truncation of their star forma-
tion activity as the primary cause for their demise Brinchmann  Ellis argue that this
population must be transforming possibly via mergers into the regular classes A simple
model which implements a likely redshift-dependent merger rate LeFevre et al 2000 with
elliptical products can broadly reproduce the trends observed shaded area of the plot
6 Origin of the Hubble Sequence
The availability of stellar masses for all types enables the construction of a powerful
evolutionary plot analogous to Figure 6 involving the stellar mass density starsz T 
as a function of morphology T  Whilst the stellar mass density can grow by continued
star formation unlike the UV luminosity density U V  it is dicult to imagine how it
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
can decline As we saw earlier U V can decline signicantly in only 1-2 Gyr because of an
abrupt truncation of activity However such a change would have very little eect on the
infrared output as illustrated in Figure 13
Brinchmann and Ellis 2000 secured K luminosities and optical-IR SEDS for over 300
galaxies in the CFRSLDSS and Hawaii survey elds and derive starsz T  Figure 15
Estimating the integrated stellar mass density is prone to all of the diculties reviewed
earlier for the luminosity density and there is the added complication that the redshift
surveys in question are optically-selected and thus must miss some red fraction of a true
K-limited sample Accordingly the mass densities derived are lower limits to the true
values
Remarkably starsz T  is a declining function for the intriguing population of morphologically-
peculiar galaxies Whereas the declining UV luminosity density could imply a fading popu-
lation such an explanation cannot be consistent with Figure 15 which argues instead that
the objects are genuinely disappearing into other systems The most logical explanation
for their declining contribution to the stellar mass density is that morphologically-peculiar
objects are being transformed eg by mergers into regular objects
Figure 16 An increase in the merger fraction as a function of redshift from the HST
analysis of LeFevre et al 2000 Galaxies of known redshift were examined for satellites
brighter than a xed rest-frame luminosity within a projected radius of 20h1 kpc and
corrections made for unrelated line-of-sight contamination This redshift-dependent merger
rate was adopted by Brinchmann  Ellis 2000 in Figure 15
Merging has been an attractive means for governing the evolution of galaxies for many
years Toomre  Toomre 1972 Rocca-Volmerange  Guiderdoni 1989 Broadhurst et al 1992
and of course is fundamental to the hierarchical formation picture However it has been
extremely dicult to determine the observed rate at intermediate redshift The fundamen-
tal problem is that we observe galaxies at various look-back times via discrete snapshots
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
without ever being able to prove two associated systems are destined to merge on a par-
ticular timescale Using the CFRSLDSS HST dataset referred to earlier LeFevre et al
2000 undertook a quantitative survey of the fraction of luminous galaxies with satellites
brighter than a xed absolute magnitude within a 20h1 kpc metric radius and after
allowance for projection eects determined the merger fraction increases with redshift
as  1  z3405 - a result consistent with earlier ground-based eorts Sadly it is
not straightforward to convert the proportion of galaxies with associated sources into a
physical merger rate or as ideally required a mass assembly rate without some indication
of the dynamical timescale for each merger and the mass of each satellite Moreover there
are several annoying biases that aect even the derived merger fraction
Brinchmann  Ellis 2000 attempted to reconcile the decline of the morphologically-
peculiar population the redshift dependence of the LeFevre et al merger fraction and asso-
ciated evidence for continued formation of ellipticals Menanteau et al 2000 into a simple
self-consistent picture They transferred the dominant population of morphologically-
irregular galaxies via the z-dependent merger rate into a growth in the regular galaxies
shaded area of Figure 15 This is clearly a simplistic view but nonetheless gives a crude
empirical rate at which regular galaxies are assembling If correct how does this agree
with mass assembly histories predicted say in CDM
Figure 17 Predicted evolution in stellar mass functions for disk and spheroidal pop-
ulations in a CDM hierarchical model Frenk priv comm The curves dene mass
functions as a function of redshift z00512 from right to left Modest growth over
0 z 2 is expected for disk galaxies but signicant growth is predicted for massive
spheroidals
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
Figure 17 shows a recent prediction of the assembly history of spheroids and disks
Frenk private communication Although there are some discrepancies between this and
its equivalent prediction from Kaumann  Charlot 1998 Figure 3 the trends are clear
The strongest evolutionary signal is expected in terms of a recent assembly of massive
spheroids the equivalent growth rate in stellar disks is more modest To the extent it
is currently possible to test this picture the qualitative trend is supported by the data
Field ellipticals are certainly still assembling Menanteau et al 2000 but perhaps more
slowly than expected according to Figure 17 unfortunately deeper samples with redshifts
are needed for a precise statement Brinchmann in prep has examined the stellar mass
growth rate in disks using the infrared-based method over 0 z 1 and nds only modest
changes This is very much a developing area and one that would benet from signicantly
enlarged HST datasets chosen to overlap the growing faint redshift survey databases
Figure 18 Face-on barred spirals of known redshift in the Hubble Deep Field Abraham
et al 1999 claim that all such systems should easily be recognised to z1 in HDF-quality
data whereas beyond z06 there appears to be a marginal paucity of such systems com-
pared to their non-barred counterparts If supported by further data this could indicate an
epoch corresponding to the dynamical maturing of stellar disks
The HST data particularly that in the Hubble Deep Fields HDF is an astonishingly
rich resource which is still not completely exploited As an indication of what might be
Richard S Ellis Galaxy Formation and Evolution
possible with future instrumentation I will close with some remarks on the important role
that bulges and bars may play in the history of the Hubble sequence
50 of local spirals have bars which are thought to originate through dynamical in-
stabilities in well-established dierentially-rotating stellar disks
If we could determine
the epoch at which bars begin appearing conceivably this would shed some light on how
recently mature spirals came to be Via careful simulations based on local examples Abra-
ham et al 1999 showed that face-on barred galaxies should be recognisable to z 1 in the
HDF exposures In fact many are seen Figure 18 but tantalisingly the barred fraction
of face-on spirals appears to drop beyond a redshift z06 The eect is marginal but
illustrative of a powerful future use of morphological imaging with the Advanced Camera
for Surveys
The story with bulges is also unclear although potentially equally exciting Tradition-
ally bulges were thought to represent miniature ellipticals which formed monolithically
at high redshift Eggen Lynden-Bell  Sandage 1962 Detailed studies of local exam-
ples including the Galactic bulge have shown a considerable diversity in properties both
in integrated color and even in their photometric structure Wyse 1999 There is some
evidence of a bimodality in the population prominent bulges in early type spirals share
surface brightness characteristics of ellipticals whereas those in late-type spirals are closer
to exponential disks This might indicate two formation mechanisms one primordial as
in the traditional picture the other related perhaps to the merging assembly history or
via disk instabilities through what is termed secular evolution
Taking advantage of the HDF images including those from NICMOS Ellis et al 2000
have examined the color distribution for a large sample of spirals bulges of known redshift
and compared these colors with their integrated equivalent for the HDF ellipticals
bulges are miniature ellipticals formed at high redshift one would expect similar trends
Interestingly in the hierarchical picture one expects bulges to be older and presumably
redder than ellipticals since the latter predominantly form from merged disk systems
which most likely contain bulges as early merger remnants Ellis et al 2000 nd in-
termediate redshift bulges are the reddest part of a typical spiral but surprisingly they
are often bluer than their elliptical counterparts and far less homogeneous as a popula-
tion Contamination from disk light is an obvious concern though simulations suggest
only modest bias arises to redshifts where these trends become prominent What could be
responsible for this puzzling behavior Evolutionary synthesis modelling suggest only a
modest amount of star formation corresponding to continued infall of 5 by mass would
be needed to explain the bluing
7 Conclusions
In summary despite the frantic increase in publication rate in this eld there is an
enormous amount of work still to be done both observationally in exploiting the connec-
tion between resolved images from HST and ground-based spectroscopy and theoretically
in predicting more accurately the expected evolutionary histories of resolved components
In my opinion the subject suers too much from a satisfaction with simply replicating

according to a particular theory a range of observations This is particularly dangerous
when the observables are luminosities colors and star formation rates since the theoretical
parameters involved are numerous The challenge will be to overcome the obvious limi-
tations we presently face in determining galactic masses for complete samples of galaxies
viewed at various look-back times as well as integrating the growing body of data being
obtained in the far infrared and sub-mm spectral regions
