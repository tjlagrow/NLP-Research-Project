Abstract
I review recent and less recent work on globular cluster systems in early-
type galaxies Explaining their properties and possible assembly scenarios touches
on a variety of astrophysical topics from cluster formation itself to galaxy formation
and evolution and even details of observational techniques The spectacular cluster
systems of central galaxies in galaxy clusters may owe their richness to a plethora of
less spectacular galaxies and their star formation processes It seems that dwarf galaxies
occupy a particularly important role
Introduction - globular clusters and dwarf galaxies
Talking about globular cluster systems with the intention to reach an audience of non-
experts is a particular challenge because often a specic discovery or result is sparkling
brighter inside the cosmos of experts than outside where the horizon is wider and
sparks dim easily On the other hand the variety of astrophysical problems relevant to
star cluster research see the reviews of Brodie  Strader 2006 Harris 2010 and do not
miss Kissler-Patig 2009 joins a large and explosive congregation where sparks can
have tremendous eects
The formation of globular clusters GCs is yet to be understood in detail as is
usually the case with dissipative processes in astrophysics but it is not a mystery We
see GCs today forming in a variety of galaxy types most spectacularly in starbursts
triggered by galaxy interactions eg Schweizer 2009 The origin of the most massive
star cluster known with a mass of 8107Mcid12 Maraston et al 2004 W3 in the interact-
ing galaxy NGC 7252 can be convincingly related to the starburst which occurred 05
Gyr ago Such massive objects may form by rapid merging of star cluster complexes
Fellhauer  Kroupa 2005 Kissler-Patig et al 2006 Also in normal spiral galaxies
the formation of massive star clusters is supported by a high star-formation rate Larsen
 Richtler 2000 Integrating the cosmic star formation rate eg Hopkins 2004 one
nds that about 65 of all stellar mass has been formed before z1 age 88 Gyr for
a standard cosmology In this epoch the star formation rate was much higher than it
is today so most GCs in the Universe are old but do not represent by nature the oldest
populations This cosmic argument does not apply to individual galaxies and many
intermediate-age GCs have been found in early-type galaxies eg Puzia et al 2005
Messier 92 is one of the best investigated Galactic GCs Its age can currently be
constrained to be 11  15 Gyr di Cecco et al 2010 16  z  5 and it is one of the
metal-poorest clusters An iron abundance of FeH-23 Kraft  Ivans 2003 and
Richtler
a mass of 15  105 Mcid12 mean a total iron mass of only 08Mcid12 a mass which can be
produced by a few SNII supernovae That there is no detectable star-to-star variation of
the iron abundance which is not the case for other elements eg Angelou et al 2012
permits the conclusion that M92 is not self-enriched and that it has formed in an already
well-mixed environment This environment cannot have been very massive since there
is no signicant eld population with this iron abundance If we call it a dwarf galaxy
then we are close to the scenario proposed by Searle  Zinn 1978 who called these
entities protogalactic fragments
Dwarf galaxies donate GCs to the Milky Way This becomes manifest through
the Sagittarius stream Ibata et al 2001 Siegel et al 2011 and other candidates eg
Pawlowski et al 2012 and references therein Moreover the young halo clusters
trace the plane of Milky Way satellites Yoon  Lee 2002 Kroupa et al 2005 Keller
et al 2012 Forbes  Bridges 2010 estimate that an appreciable fraction of the
Galactic GC system has been accreted through dwarf galaxies
If accretion plays an important role for the assembly of the metal-poor part of rel-
atively isolated spiral galaxies what role does it occupy in really dense environments
2 The richness of globular cluster systems
21 The richest globular cluster systems are not so rich
A popular quantitative measure for the richness of a globular cluster system GCS is
the specic frequency S N which has been dened by Harris  van den Bergh 1981
as S N  NGC1004MV 15 where NGC is the total number of GCs and MV the host
galaxys absolute V-magnitude
We nd the richest GCSs in terms of GC number around central galaxies in galaxy
clusters the nearest being M87 Virgo Tamura et al 2006 Harris 2009b Strader
et al 2011 NGC 1399 Fornax Kissler-Patig et al 1999 Richtler et al 2004 Dirsch
et al 2003b Schuberth et al 2010 NGC 3311 Hydra I Wehner et al 2008 Richtler
et al 2011 S N-values for these galaxies which can host more than 10000 GCs are
somewhat uncertain not so much for the number of GCs but because MV can be easily
underestimated for these galaxies with very extended stellar halos The case of NGC
3311 is illustrative because this galaxy had the reputation of showing a particularly
high S N eg McLaughlin et al 1995 quoted S N  15 6 Wehner et al 2008 found
16500 GCs within a radius of 150 kpc and adopted MV  228 thus S N  125 the
uncertainties still permitting an extreme lower limit of S N  9 But integrating the V-
luminosity prole of Richtler et al 2011 out to the same radius results in MV  24
and S N  41 which is a normal value for giant elliptical galaxies A similar point has
been made for NGC 1399 Ostrov et al 1998 Dirsch et al 2003b Therefore there
is no hard evidence that S N-values for central giant ellipticals are dramatically higher
than for normal ellipticals
Intuition tells us that accretion of dwarf galaxies for ellipticals in galaxy clusters
should be even more important than for spiral galaxies Cote et al 1998 formulated
this beyond intuition see also Hilker et al 1999 Clear evidence eg in the form of
streams is only just now emerging for example in the cases of M87 Romanowsky
et al 2012 or NGC 3311 Arnaboldi et al 2012 The halos of these central galaxies
have been built up by long-term accretion of material from the cluster environment
a process which is still on-going Strong evidence for a signicant growth of massive
Globular clusters
elliptical galaxies since z2 103 Gyr has been provided by van Dokkum et al 2010
They nd that outside a core with a size of about 5kpc elliptical galaxies increased their
mass by a factor of 4 within the last 10 Gyr This happens predominantly through minor
and dry mergers Tal et al 2012 Obviously GCSs should share the same fate
For NGC 1399 kinematical data indicate that many GCs cannot have formed in
situ One nds in the GCS of NGC 1399 objects which by their high radial veloci-
ties must reach apocentric distances of 500 kpc or even greater Richtler et al 2004
Schuberth et al 2010 These few objects near their pericenters must trace a much
larger unknown population with high space velocities but low radial velocities Their
orbital velocities result from potential dierences that exist within the Fornax cluster
rather than within NGC 1399 so one may call them intracluster GCs Kissler-Patig
et al 1999
22 The poorest globular cluster systems can be the richest
The GCSs of early-type dwarf galaxies are as interesting as those of giant ellipticals
The highest specic frequency known is that of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal with 5 GCs
S N  30 Are dwarf galaxies for some reason more ecient in forming GCs Miller
 Lotz 2007 indeed found a trend of increasing S N with decreasing brightness of the
host galaxy for dwarf ellipticals in Fornax Virgo and the Leo group The largest data
base in this respect is the HSTACS Virgo survey Peng et al 2008 in which about
100 early-type Virgo galaxies have been imaged down to a magnitude of MV  16
This work does not support a clear relation between S N and host galaxy brightness but
dwarf galaxies ll a larger S N-interval than giant ellipticals Probably a key nding is
that dwarf galaxies with large clustercentric distances consistently show low S N-values
while high S N-values are found among the projected inner dwarf galaxy population
ie among those galaxies with a higher probability of interactions which may have
triggered star-bursts
3 The phenomenon of bimodality
The metallicity distribution of Galactic GCs is bimodal ie well represented by two
Gaussians with metal-rich and metal-poor GCs being the bulge and the halo clusters
respectively Zinn 1985 Do we nd a similar fundamental structure in the GCSs of
elliptical galaxies
In an inuential paper Ashman  Zepf 1992 explored the idea that GCs form
in mergers and interactions of galaxies see their introduction for the history of this
concept and hypothesized that the metallicity distribution of GCs in elliptical galaxies
should be bimodal Adopting the merger paradigm for elliptical galaxies metal-poor
clusters are the old GCs of the pre-merger components while metal-rich clusters form
in starbursts triggered by gas-rich mergers of spiral galaxies This prediction of bi-
modality in the color distribution of GCs has indeed been found in many elliptical
galaxies eg Zepf  Ashman 1993 Whitmore et al 1995 Gebhardt  Kissler-Patig
1999 Larsen et al 2001 Kundu  Whitmore 2001 Peng et al 2006 Harris et al 2009
Harris 2009a Studies in the Washington photometric system showed this bimodality
particularly well eg Geisler et al 1996 Dirsch et al 2003ba Bassino et al 2006
it can be characterized by two Gaussians with peaks at C-R135 the blue peak
and C-R175 the red peak these peaks are not found in Fig2 The blue peak is
remarkably constant among the investigated galaxies while the red peak gets slightly
Richtler
redder with increasing host galaxy brightness see also Larsen  Richtler 2000 How-
ever this color bimodality does not apply to the brightest clusters in some GCSs which
avoid very red and very blue colors
The HSTACS surveys in Virgo and the Fornax conrm this with a much larger
database Peng et al 2006 2008 Jordan et al 2009 It turns out that bimodal color
distributions are mainly a signature of bright host galaxies which does not come as a
surprise early-type galaxies follow a well-dened color-magnitude relation eg Smith
Castelli et al 2008 Misgeld et al 2008 and one does not expect GCs to be redder than
the host galaxy itself A striking dierence between the blue and red clusters is that the
mean color of the red subpopulation strongly correlates with the host galaxy luminosity
and thus with its color while the mean color of blue clusters is more or less constant
Blue and red GC populations however dier in more than only their colors As
shown in many papers the radial number density proles of red clusters are steeper and
resemble more the light prole of their host galaxies Accordingly they show a lower
velocity dispersion than the blue clusters For NGC 1399 Fig20 of Schuberth et al
2010 demonstrates that the velocity dispersion exhibits a sudden change between red
and blue clusters not a smooth transition
Do these bimodal color distributions reect bimodal metallicity distributions There
had been some claims that a non-linearity of the color-metallicity relation in combina-
tion with a considerable scatter around this relation can produce a bimodal color dis-
tribution even if the underlying metallicity distribution is not bimodal Richtler 2006
Yoon et al 2006 More recent work strengthens this point Yoon et al 2011ba de-
rive GC metallicity distributions from a non-linear color-metallicity relation and show
that the inferred metallicity distributions are rather single-peaked I caution that their
example NGC 4374 is a multiple SNIa host galaxy see more remarks below A fur-
ther complicating point is that their color-metallicity relation becomes so insensitive
to metallicity for clusters metal-poorer than about FeH-15 that to infer a metal-
licity distribution from a color distribution seems to be only meaningful if color and
metallicity are related without any generic scatter But this is not the case because
metal-poor Galactic GCs having the same metallicity can show quite dierent CMDs
Fig1 Therefore the reconstructed metallicity distribution for metal-poor clusters
might be considered as a mean distribution without saying much about an individual
object However a weak metallicity-brightness relation for metal-poor clusters as de-
scribed by Harris 2009a is expected because massive clusters have a higher proba-
bility to originate from more massive host galaxies with an overall higher metallicity
If IR-bands are included bimodality may vanish almost completely as shown by
Blakeslee et al 2012 for NGC 1399 and Chies-Santos et al 2011 2012 for a sample
of 17 early-type galaxies Galaxies with very pronounced blue peaks in g-z are NGC
4374 and NGC 4526 These galaxies hosted three and two SNIa events respectively
Therefore one may assume signicant intermediate-age populations to be present and
probably also intermediate-age GCs and the color is not anymore a pure metallicity
indicator More SNIa host galaxies in their sample are NGC 4382 NGC 4621 and
NGC 4649 The striking deciency of red clusters in NGC 4660 which one also nds
in the sample of Peng et al 2006 is remarkable There may be more individuality
among GCSs than previously thought In those cases where metallicities of larger GC
samples have been derived from integrated spectra not only of early-type galaxies
Globular clusters
Figure 1
Colour-metallicity relations for Galactic GCs with reddenings less than
EB-V015 using B-I data from Harris 1996 and C-T1 data from Harris  Can-
terna 1977 The non-linearity is clearly seen For clusters metal-poorer than about
FeH-15 the color becomes a very bad proxy for the metallicity more so for B-I
than for C-T1 Note however the large deviations for some clusters Also note that
these colors measured with diaphragms refer only to the innermost parts of GCs
Foster et al 2010 2011 Caldwell et al 2011 the metallicity distributions appear
unimodal with one broad peak around FeH-1
4 Once more giant and dwarf galaxies
The question to what degree S N-values of galaxies reect the eciency of GC forma-
tion is dicult to answer relating GC masses to host galaxy mass as do eg Peng et al
2008 Georgiev et al 2010 would be more physical but observationally more dicult
to determine Although the S N-values of central galaxies may not be as high as pre-
viously thought they are still higher than elliptical galaxies of lower luminosity The
ACS Virgo survey Peng et al 2008 reveals a shallow minimum around MV  -20 but
without a well-dened relation for the dwarf or for the giant regime although many
dwarf galaxies as faint as MV  16 show S N-values rivalling or exceeding typical val-
ues for giant galaxies Including fainter galaxies from Lotz et al 2004 lets the trend
of increasing S N with decreasing luminosity appears clearer values higher than 10 are
normal particularly for nucleated dwarf galaxies
This is also visible in the compilation of Georgiev et al 2010 They embed
the variation of S N-values in the context of galaxy formation inspired by Dekel 
Birnboim 2006 see Forbes 2005 for an earlier account
In brief star formation
in low mass galaxies is regulated by stellar feedback in high mass galaxies by virial
shocks which in both regimes leads to a suppression of eld star formation and favors
star clusters One notes that this interpretation implies an alternative view here it is
a generic property of star formation processes in giant ellipticals which produces the
rich GCSs not the infall of less massive galaxies with intrinsically higher S N-values
It may be however dicult to defend this view in front of all evidence for the role of
accretion Starbursts in dwarf galaxies might hold the key for a proper understanding
Can metallicity itself be a parameter for ecient GC formation At low metallic-
ity the energy and momentum input into the interstellar medium via radiation-driven
Richtler
stellar winds is reduced Kudritzki 2002 leading to a higher star formation eciency
Dib et al 2011 Glover  Clark 2012a nd that molecules are not necessarily a
prerequisite for star formation but that dust is an important ingredient for cooling pro-
cesses Star formation occurs in cold gas at higher temperatures and Jeans masses are
increased Glover  Clark 2012b The formation of dense substructures in a collaps-
ing cloud is eciently suppressed at low metallicities because turbulence cannot create
clumps as eciently as in high-metallicity clouds Glover  Clark 2012b This may
lead to a more coherent star formation inside a star-forming cloud These are all factors
which support the dynamical stability of star-forming clouds and plausibly favor the
formation of compact and coherent structures which lead to the extremely clustered
star formation for example in Blue Compact Galaxies eg Adamo et al 2011
5 Globular clusters outside galaxies
Cosmological formation of GCs ie GCs embedded in a dark halo is interesting
to imagine but dicult to prove GCs apparently exist outside galaxies however this
does not mean that they were formed outside galaxies The objects with high radial ve-
locities around central galaxies spend most of their orbital life far way from the cluster
center But there are also GC populations in galaxy clusters without a central galaxy
West et al 2011 found in a population of intergalactic GCs in Abell 1185 mostly
metal-poor A recent survey with HSTACS of the Coma cluster uncovered a huge pop-
ulation of GCs lling the entire cluster core Peng et al 2011 The authors estimate a
total of about 47000 GCs out to a radius of 570 kpc Dissolution of dwarf galaxies and
tidal stripping from more massive galaxies might both contribute to create this largest
GCS in the local Universe
Isolated elliptical galaxies
Suspecting dwarf galaxies as donators of metal-poor GCs it would be interesting to
compare cluster galaxies with isolated elliptical galaxies Unfortunately the data are
sparse After the compilation of Spitler et al 2008 no new work on isolated ellipticals
has been reported leaving NGC 720 Kissler-Patig et al 1996 and NGC 821 Spitler
et al 2008 as prototypes Both present relatively poor cluster systems However many
isolated ellipticals exhibit tidally disturbed features and may be in fact late merg-
ers Tal et al 2009 including NGC 720 that does not exhibit obvious morphological
peculiarities but strong population gradients Rembold et al 2005
7 NGC 1316 - cluster formation in a late merger
A galaxy whose brightness is dominated by intermediate-age populations Kuntschner
2000 is the merger remnant NGC 1316 Fornax A in the outskirts of the Fornax
galaxy cluster It might illustrate the processes that were in action during the youth of
giant ellipticals to form metal-rich clusters see Richtler et al 2012a for references
It experienced a major starburst about 2-3 Gyr ago that produced many massive star
clusters the brightest one 114 in the list of Goudfrooij et al 2001a having a mass
of the order 2  107Mcid12 Note that Brodie et al 2011 would not call it an Ultra
Compact Dwarf because its eective radius is smaller than 10 pc Goudfrooij 2012
Globular clusters
The imprint of the 2 Gyr starburst is a well dened peak in the color distribution of
GCs Richtler et al 2012a Fig2 Cluster ages from integrated spectra have been
determined only for a few of the brightest clusters Goudfrooij et al 2001b but the
colors with the assumption of solar metallicity for all bright clusters t well to these
ages Star formation continued after this starburst and a second peak corresponds to 08
Gyr which still has to be conrmed by spectroscopy We nd GCs with ages as young
as 05 Gyr
Including fainter clusters probably samples older objects and lets these
peaks largely disappear A very interesting observation is that the brightest clusters
seem to avoid the systemic radial velocity of NGC 1316 by showing large negative
osets up to 500 kms This indicates elongated orbits and a population of massive
clusters far away from the center which still has to be identied The starburst seem
to have happened in a very early stage of the merger with the merger components still
separated with high relative velocities
Very remarkable is the object SH2 discovered by Schweizer 1980 Rather than
as a normal HII-region it appears as an ensemble of star clusters with ages around 01
Gyr Richtler et al 2012b Its exact nature still awaits investigation but a plausible
hypothesis is that of an infalling dwarf galaxy having recently experienced a starburst
In this case one would expect low metallicities and it would constitute an example
how metal-poor clusters are donated to a GCS

Inventory
A cautiously positive answer to the title question seems to be appropriate A description
of a global picture which generously ignores details can be giant elliptical galaxies
assembled their metal-poor GCs by the accretion of dwarf galaxies The metal-rich GCs
formed in early starbursts triggered by gas-rich mergers Whether colors alone can pro-
vide an adequate description of the substructure of an GCS has become doubtful With

higher precision of kinematical data more substructures in GCSs will be detected and
perhaps single merger events can be identied The key to all that is the physics of star
cluster formation in starbursts whether in dwarf galaxies or in massive systems Mod-
ern simulations of galaxy mergers now resolve star cluster scales see Hopkins et al
2012 and references therein and will probably provide the physical understanding
