ABSTRACT
We present the evolution of galaxy sizes from redshift 2 to 0 for actively star forming
and passive galaxies in the cosmological hydrodynamical 1003 cMpc3 simulation of
the EAGLE project We nd that the sizes increase with stellar mass  but that the
relation weakens with increasing redshift Separating galaxies by their star formation
activity we nd that passive galaxies are typically smaller than active galaxies at xed
stellar mass These trends are consistent with those found in observations and the level
of agreement between the predicted and observed size - mass relation is of order 01
dex for z  1 and 0203 dex from redshift 1 to 2 We use the simulation to compare
the evolution of individual galaxies to that of the population as a whole While the
evolution of the size-stellar mass relation for active galaxies provides a good proxy
for the evolution of individual galaxies the evolution of individual passive galaxies is
not well represented by the observed size - mass relation due to the evolving number
density of passive galaxies Observations of z  2 galaxies have revealed an abundance
of massive red compact galaxies that depletes below z  1 We nd that a similar
population forms naturally in the simulation Comparing these galaxies to their z  0
descendants we nd that all compact galaxies grow in size due to the high-redshift
stars migrating outwards Approximately 60 of the compact galaxies increase in size
further due to renewed star formation andor mergers

1 INTRODUCTION
Understanding and reproducing the observed evolution of
galaxies is one of the key aims of modern cosmology Galax-
ies are thought to form as a result of gas cooling in the grav-
itational potential dominated by dark matter eg White 
Rees 1978 White  Frenk 1991 As the baryons cool they
form a rotating disk Assuming the gas initially has a spe-
cic angular momentum similar to that of the dark matter
and that angular momentum is conserved the CDM frame-
work predicts the evolution of the sizes of disk galaxies Fall
 Efstathiou 1980 Mo Mao  White 1998 In practice
however the process of baryon condensation is complicated
by the formation of stars and black holes and the energy

that they feed back into the surrounding gas The angular
momentum of the stars that form may therefore dier signif-
icantly from that of the halo The evolution of galaxy sizes
is therefore a critical test of the physical processes of galaxy
formation
Recent observational surveys of the z  0 Universe
sample millions of galaxies probing the full range of galaxy
masses and sizes eg Shen et al 2003 Dutton et al 2011
Baldry et al 2012 The evolution of the sizes of galaxies
from the present day up to redshift 3 has been mapped for
a broad range of galaxy masses and types using the Hub-
ble Space Telescope with CANDELS imaging Patel et al
2013 van Dokkum et al 2014 van der Wel et al 2014 here-
after VDW14 Galaxies in the distant Universe are smaller
at xed mass than local systems suggesting that galaxies
undergo signicant size evolution
Furlong et al
At z cid38 1 observations reveal a class of very compact
passive galaxies often referred to as red nuggets eg
Cimatti et al 2004 Daddi et al 2005 Trujillo et al 2006
Such galaxies are rare in the nearby Universe Poggianti
et al 2013 VDW14 The evolutionary path of individual
compact galaxies cannot be inferred from the observational
data alone since galaxies evolve in both stellar mass and size
and may merge with other systems It is thus challenging to
establish what becomes of these compact passive galaxies
from observational evidence alone Simulations such as the
one considered here can provide the necessary link to the
present-day galaxy population
Until recently the sizes of galaxies produced by hy-
drodynamical simulations were not consistent with obser-
vations while the masses of the galaxies tended to be too
large their sizes were too small eg Scannapieco et al
2012 The dense gas transfers angular momentum to the
outer halo which is exacerbated if too much gas is turned
into stars leading to what became known as the angular mo-
mentum catastrophe Katz  Gunn 1991 Navarro  White
1994 This problem can be overcome by the inclusion of
energetic feedback which tends to expel the lowest angular
momentum gas from the forming galaxy while also regulat-
ing the stellar mass formed eg Sales et al 2010 Brook
et al 2011 2012a Including realistic and ecient feedback
has resulted in more reasonable galaxy sizes for disk galaxies
in small galaxy samples or over specic mass ranges Gov-
ernato et al 2004 Okamoto  Millis 2005 Sales et al 2010
Brook et al 2012b McCarthy et al 2012 Munshi et al 2013
Aumer et al 2013 Hopkins et al 2014 Marinacci Pakmor 
Springel 2014 However reproducing the observed sizes of
the general galaxy population remains a challenge for many
cosmological simulations The production of realistic galaxy
stellar masses in such simulations or indeed a broad range
of galaxy scaling relations is a necessary but not sucient
criterion for the reproduction of galaxy sizes Scannapieco
et al 2012 Crain et al 2015
The distribution of galaxy sizes has been studied in
cosmological simulations in the work of Sales et al 2010
and McCarthy et al 2012 who focused on the z  2 and
z  0 populations in the OWLS Schaye et al 2010 and
GIMIC Crain et al 2009 simulations respectively A recent
study based on the ILLUSTRIS simulation Vogelsberger
et al 2014 by Snyder et al 2015 examined the size-mass-
morphology relation at z  0 The galaxy sizes were shown
to be a factor of  2 too large relative to observations at this
redshift and the evolution of sizes was not examined Using
the same simulation Wellons et al 2015ba looked at the
formation and evolution of z  2 massive compact galaxies
respectively The size evolution of the compact galaxies was
found to depend on the environment in which the galaxies
are found We will also examine the evolution of compact
galaxies but in the broader context of the high-z passive
population in the simulation after comparing the full galaxy
population to observations nding good agreement
In this study we investigate the evolution of the galaxy
size - mass relation and evolutionary tracks of individ-
ual galaxies using the Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies
and their Environments EAGLE simulation suite Schaye
et al 2015 Crain et al 2015 The largest of the EA-
GLE simulations evolves a volume of 1003 comoving Mpc3
cMpc3 with 13200 galaxies of stellar mass M  109 Mcid12
and 3562 with M  1010 Mcid12 at z  0 This sample enables
us to study the evolution of galaxy sizes from z  2 to the
present day while separating the population into those that
are star forming and passive
The simulation combines gravitational N-body solvers
with state-of-the-art smoothed particle hydrodynamics and
subgrid models for the formation of stars metal-dependent
cooling stellar mass loss and energy injection from stars
and black holes The simulation reproduces a wide range of
properties of observed galaxies with unprecedented delity
Schaye et al 2015 The observed present-day galaxy stel-
lar mass function galaxy disk sizes and black hole masses
were used to calibrate the uncertain parameters of the sub-
grid components but other aspects of the model such as
the star formation rates Schaye et al 2015 galaxy colours
Trayford et al 2015 rotation curves Schaller et al 2015b
the gas content of galaxies Lagos et al 2015 Bahe et al
2015 and the inter-galactic hydrogen and metal absorption
lines Schaye et al 2015 Rahmati et al 2015 as well as the
evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and star for-
mation rates Furlong et al 2015 represent predictions of
the simulation and exhibit broad agreement with observa-
tions A full discussion of the model calibrationvalidation
philosophy can be found in Schaye et al 2015 and Crain
et al 2015
Although the z  0 galaxy disk sizes were considered
during the calibration of the EAGLE simulation the evolu-
tion of galaxy sizes is a prediction of the simulation More-
over the simulations allow us to explore the dierence in size
between galaxies that are actively forming stars and those
that are passive a distinction that was not made during
the calibration Passive galaxies are particularly prevalent
at high stellar masses and primarily grow in mass through
galaxy mergers Such galaxies are observed to be smaller
than disk galaxies of the same stellar mass eg Shen et al
2003 Baldry et al 2012 van der Wel et al 2014 provid-
ing a key test of the simulation This comparison has fur-
ther implications than simply validating the model since the
simulation can also help us interpret the observational data
For example we can trace galaxies as they evolve enabling
us to address issues such as the origin of the size - mass
relation and to relate galaxy masses and sizes at one red-
shift to another redshift In particular we will show that
the simulation produces a population of high-redshift com-
pact galaxies and we trace the descendants of these galaxies
to examine their properties at the present day
The layout of the paper is as follows Brief descriptions
of the EAGLE simulations and the galaxy selection can be
found in section 2 where we also discuss the sensitivity of
galaxy size to its denition In section 3 we consider the
sizes of the full galaxy population We compare the sizes
of simulated galaxies and their evolution to observational
measurements in section 31 nding good agreement par-
ticularly relative to previous simulation results Appendix
A In section 32 we determine the origin of the scatter in
the size - mass relation We then explore the evolution of
individual galaxies in section 33 and the mass dependence
of the size growth in section 34 In section 4 we look at the
evolution of high-redshift passive galaxies with a particular
focus on compact galaxies A summary of our main ndings
and concluding remarks are presented in section 5

2 GALAXIES IN THE EAGLE SIMULATIONS
The production and selection of simulated galaxies are de-
scribed below We begin with an overview of the primary
EAGLE simulation in section 21 followed by a discussion
of the denition and selection of galaxies applied to the sim-
ulation in section 22 In section 23 we present our deni-
tion of galaxy size and discuss alternative choices Further
details on alternative galaxy size denitions can be found
in Appendix C Finally the galaxy classication applied in
this study is introduced and discussed in section 24 with
further details given in Appendix D
21 Simulation overview
For this study we use cosmological hydrodynamical simula-
tions from the EAGLE project We focus primarily on the
largest of the simulations Ref-L100N1504 a 100 cMpc3
simulation with baryonic particle masses of 12  106 Mcid12
which provides a large sample of galaxies resolved by at least
1000 star particles These galaxies span more than two or-
ders of magnitude in stellar mass and are found in a diverse
range of environments
We also analyse two smaller higher-resolution simu-
lations Recal-L025N0752 and Ref-L025N0752 The high-
resolution simulations are used for convergence tests pre-
sented in Appendix B The box sizes and resolutions of
these simulations are summarised in Table 1 The Ref-
L025N0752 simulation has a factor of 8 2 better mass
spatial resolution and employs the same subgrid param-
eters as Ref-L100N1504 comparing these two simulations
tests the strong convergence of the simulation see Schaye
et al 2015 for denitions and discussion of the concepts of
strong and weak convergence Recal-L025N0752 also
has a factor of 8 better mass resolution but was recalibrated
to better reproduce the observed local Universe galaxy stel-
lar mass function at this higher resolution This simulation
enables examination of the weak convergence of the simula-

To model astrophysical processes that occur on scales
below the resolution of the simulation subgrid schemes are
applied Included are subgrid models for radiative cooling
and photo-heating star formation stellar mass loss and
metal enrichment stellar feedback from massive stars black
hole growth and feedback from active galactic nuclei AGN
The cooling and photo-heating model uses the imple-
mentation of Wiersma Schaye  Smith 2009 Abundances
of 11 elements are considered when computing radiative
cooling rates tabulated from Cloudy version 0702 Ferland
et al 1998 assuming ionization equilibrium and exposure to
the cosmic microwave background and the Haardt  Madau
2001 model for the evolving UVX-ray background
Above a metallicity-dependent density threshold star
particles form stochastically with the star formation rate
determined from the gas pressure such that it reproduces the
observed Kennicutt-Schmidt law Kennicutt 1998 Schaye 
Dalla Vecchia 2008 Star particles represent simple stellar
populations described by a Chabrier IMF The Jeans length
for the cold phase of the interstellar medium ISM cannot
be resolved by the simulations and consequently a pressure
oor is imposedcorresponding to a polytropic equation of
state Peos  eos  enabling the multi-phase ISM to be
treated as a single-phase uid
Stellar mass loss is based on the implementation of
Wiersma et al 2009 where mass lost from asymptotic gi-
ant branch stars through winds of massive stars and su-
pernovae both core collapse and type Ia is returned to
the ISM over the lifetime of the stellar population
Prompt feedback associated with star formation is im-
plemented following Dalla Vecchia  Schaye 2012 where
the thermal energy available from stars formed is stochasti-
cally distributed to neighbouring gas particles without any
preferential direction Energy injection always results in a
temperature increase of T  1075 K such a temperature
jump is required to mitigate numerical radiative losses at
the resolution of the EAGLE simulations Dalla Vecchia 
Schaye 2012 The probability of energy injection depends
on the metallicity and density of the local environment in
which the star particle formed and is calibrated to reproduce
the observed local Universe galaxy stellar mass function and
the size - mass relation for disk galaxies where the galaxy
sizes are a calibration diagnostic that is necessary to break
degeneracies between dierent models that reproduce the
galaxy stellar mass function Crain et al 2015 See Schaye
et al 2015 and Crain et al 2015 for a full description

22 Sample selection
Galaxy identication is carried out as described by Schaye
et al 2015 The friends-of-friends method with a linking
length of 02 identies overdensities that we refer to as halos
Self-bound substructures within halos are identied using
SUBFIND Springel et al 2001 Dolag et al 2009 We refer
to the stellar component of the subhalos as the galaxies in
the simulation A central galaxy corresponds to the most
massive subhalo within a halo
To enable comparison to the observational study of
VDW14 we bin galaxies in redshift intervals of z  05 In
the four redshift bins spanning 0 cid54 z cid54 2 we combine be-
tween 3 and 6 simulation outputs We include galaxies with
stellar masses M  109 Mcid12 to ensure that the masses sizes
and star formation rates of galaxies are well sampled see
Schaye et al 2015 and Furlong et al 2015 for convergence
studies We limit the sample to galaxies with z cid54 2 as the
typical size of galaxies at higher redshifts becomes compara-
ble to the spatial resolution limit of the simulation partic-
ularly for passive galaxies The resolution limit is set by the
minimum of the gravitational force softening and the Jeans
length  2pkpcfgasnH01cm305T 104K05 where
fgas is the gas fraction nH is the hydrogen number density
and T is the temperature The polytropic equation of state
is implemented to avoid articial fragmentation thus sup-
pressing fragmentation below the Jeans length This value
however varies depending on the gas fraction and the den-
sity at which stars in the galaxy formed
The sample contains 208953 galaxies over the redshift
range 0 to 2 of which 182481 are actively forming stars and
26472 are passive as dened in section 24 Further details
of the galaxy sample can be found in Table 2
We use galaxy merger trees to trace the evolution of
individual galaxies The merger trees are built by tracing
the most bound particles of each subhalo between consec-
utive snapshots to determine the progenitor galaxies of all

23 Galaxy sizes
While the abundance range and quality of the observational
data available to measure galaxy sizes are continuously im-
proving the recovered sizes from the data typically depend
among other things on the wavelength of the observations
eg Kelvin et al 2012 Lange et al 2015 VDW14 the as-
sumed tting prole eg Head Lucey  Hudson 2015 and
the surface brightness of galaxies While it is possible to ob-
serve simulated galaxies in a similar way to real galaxies
Torrey et al 2015 Trayford  et al in prep and use these
observations to measure galaxy sizes that can be compared
to a particular data set in this study we are interested in
the physical growth and evolution of galaxies and in making
predictions that can be compared with a variety of data sets
Hence we use the physical half-stellar mass radius R50 as
our denition of galaxy size thus limiting systematic eects
related to observations
The half-mass radius is based on the total mass of
all gravitationally bound stellar particles within a spheri-
cal aperture of radius 100 pkpc about the minimum of the
gravitational potential of a galaxy This denition of the
half-mass radius of simulated galaxies is not directly depen-
dent on the galaxys shape or surface brightness We apply
the 100 pkpc aperture to ensure that star particles located
far out in the halo but which are assigned to the galaxy
by the subhalo nder are excluded from the calculation
The aperture only aects the most massive galaxies in the
simulation with M  1011 Mcid12 as shown in Appendix C
Note that the size denition here diers from that used
by Schaye et al 2015 where Sersic ts to the projected
stellar mass prole within 30 pkpc apertures were used to
measure the half-mass radius As mentioned above in this
study we aim to avoid assumptions about the prole of the
galaxies A comparison between the sizes used by Schaye
et al 2015 and here can also be found in Appendix C

24 Galaxy classication
We distinguish between galaxies that are actively forming
stars and those that are passive The division between ac-
tive and passive galaxies may be based on a cut in colour or
MM SSFR Following Fur-
specic star formation rate
long et al 2015 we apply a SSFR cut that evolves with
redshift chosen to lie approximately 1 decade below the ob-
served main sequence of star formation at each redshift We
set the SSFR limit as log10SSFRlimzGyr1  05z  2
z  0 2 It was shown by Furlong et al 2015 that the frac-
tion of passive galaxies in the simulation is broadly consis-
tent with observations over this redshift range The impact
of variations in the denition of active and passive galaxies
on galaxy sizes is presented in Appendix D while Trayford
 et al in prep show that the percentage of galaxies iden-
tied as passive is somewhat sensitive to this denition
3 SIZE EVOLUTION OF THE GENERAL
POPULATION
We begin in section 31 with a comparison of the predicted
size - mass relation with observations from 0 cid54 z cid54 2 The
scatter in the relation is considered in section 32 Having
demonstrated in these sections that EAGLE reproduces the
observed trends for galaxy sizes we explore the size evolu-
tion of individual galaxies in section 33 and the variation
in size evolution with mass in section 34
31 The redshift dependence of the size - mass
relation
The galaxy size - mass relation is shown in Fig 1 with
dierent panels showing the relation at dierent redshifts In
the simulation galaxy sizes decrease with increasing redshift
at xed stellar mass dashed curves repeat the relations at
0  z  05 for reference We restrict the comparison to
z  2 where the sizes of simulated galaxies typically lie
above the gravitational force softening used in the simulation
indicated by horizontal dotted lines At z  1 size increases
with stellar mass with a larger increase in size per stellar
mass increment above  10105 Mcid12 In the interval 1 cid54 z cid54
2 galaxy sizes show a weaker trend with stellar mass
In each panel the simulated galaxy sample is separated
into active and passive galaxies Passive galaxies are typi-
cally smaller than active galaxies by  01 dex at all redshifts
for stellar masses between 1095 and 1011 Mcid12 At higher
masses which are only sampled at z  1 by the simula-
tion the size - mass relations of active and passive galaxies
converge At M  1095 Mcid12 the size - mass relations of
both galaxy types are also similar but this is a consequence
of limited resolution It was shown by Schaye et al 2015
and Furlong et al 2015 that for M  1095 Mcid12 the star
formation rates of galaxies are poorly sampled compared to
the higher-resolution L025N0752 simulations As a result
in this mass regime the classication into passive and active
galaxies is not robust Furthermore the Jeans length cor-
responding to the equation of state that is imposed on the
unresolved interstellar medium may be a limiting factor for
the galaxy sizes in this regime for R50 cid46 1 pkpc

EAGLE Evolution of galaxy sizes
To compare the size - mass relations of simulated galax-
ies with observational constraints we also plot the mea-
surements of VDW14 in Fig 1 This enables us to com-
pare with a set of uniformly-analysed observational mea-
surements over the full redshift range The eective radius
of galaxies in the VDW14 sample is dened as the major
axis of the ellipse containing half the total ux associated
with a single component Sersic t applied to the 2-D light
prole of the galaxy The eective radius is converted to a
rest-frame wavelength of 5000A by empirically establishing
the dependence of the radius on wavelength We supple-
ment the VDW14 measurements with z  0 counterparts
presented by Shen et al 2003 since the limited volume of
the CANDELS survey used by VDW14 precludes it from
adequately sampling galaxies with M  1011 Mcid12 in the
lowest redshift bin Shen et al 2003 infer the size - mass
relation from SDSS Stoughton et al 2002 over the redshift
range 0 to 03 where galaxy type is dened using concen-
tration Sersic index and photometric colours Their larger
sample in this redshift bin extends the observations of the
size - mass relation to M  1012 Mcid12 Note however that
the circularised radii2 used by Shen et al 2003 are typi-
cally a factor of 14 smaller than uncircularised radii or the
major axis radii used by VDW14 as discussed by Dutton
et al 2011 To account for this dierence the Shen et al
2003 sizes are multiplied by a factor of 14 in Fig 1 For
both active and passive galaxies the measurements of Shen
et al 2003 and VDW14 are similar at M  10105 Mcid12
with active galaxies typically being larger than passive types
of the same stellar mass for M  1011 Mcid12 At the higher
masses probed only by Shen et al 2003 the sizes of both
types overlap At higher redshifts the normalisation of the
observed size - mass relation decreases while the oset in
size between the active and passive galaxies remains
The trends seen in the simulation namely an increase
in galaxy size with stellar mass an oset in size between
active and passive galaxies and an increasing size with de-
creasing redshift are all consistent with the observed trends
Although the normalisation of the size - mass relation of lo-
cal galaxy disk sizes was used to calibrate the simulations
it is remarkable that the relation for active galaxies traces
that of the VDW14 observations within  01 dex for all
stellar masses shown up to z  2 In the lowest redshift bin
at M  1011 Mcid12 however where no CANDELS measure-
ments are available there is a larger oset of  02 dex with
respect to the Shen et al 2003 data although we note that
this may be the result of the relatively bright surface bright-
ness limit of the SDSS survey which can be mimicked by
applying a dierent aperture to the simulated galaxies the
eect of which is demonstrated in Appendix C The sizes of
passive galaxies are consistent with the observational mea-
surements to within 01  02 dex with the largest discrep-
ancies at M  1095 Mcid12 where adequate resolution renders
the denition of active and passive galaxies ambiguous A
comparison with the sizes of simulated galaxies from the
ILLUSTRIS simulation Vogelsberger et al 2014 which
are found to be a factor of two larger than in EAGLE and
observations is presented in Appendix A

points are shown for bins containing fewer than 10 galaxies For reference the dashed curves repeat the size - mass relation for active and
passive galaxies from the lowest redshift bin The horizontal dotted line corresponds to the gravitational force softening in the simulation
which is xed at 07 pkpc over this redshift range Observational measurements presented by van der Wel et al 2014 are shown as
squares with error bars representing the median and 1- scatter Measurements from Shen et al 2003 are shown in the 0  z  05
redshift bin multiplied by 14 to account for the use of circularised radii see text The observed trends with stellar mass redshift
and galaxy type are all broadly reproduced by the simulation as well as the extent of the scatter The median relations found in the
simulation agree with those inferred by van der Wel et al 2014 to within 01 dex for active galaxies and 02 dex for passive galaxies
Passive galaxies at M  1095 Mcid12 are larger than those observed however this is a resolution eect see text
In the following sections we capitalise on the corre-
spondence between EAGLE galaxies and the observational
measurements to interpret the evolution of galaxy sizes in
physical terms
32 The scatter in the z  0 size - mass relation
The scatter in the size - mass relations is quantied Fig 1
with an overlap in sizes between active and passive galaxies
The scatter in the observational and simulated data sets is
comparable In this section we explore potential origins of
this scatter through its correlation with other galaxy prop-
In Fig 2 the size - mass relations at z  0 for active
and passive galaxies are shown in the top and bottom pan-
els respectively with contours showing the number density
of galaxies in the size  mass plane In the top panel the
underlying colour image shows the median SSFR of galaxies
in bins of M and R50 The gure shows a clear trend at a
xed stellar mass smaller galaxies have lower SSFRs
For passive galaxies the present-day SSFR reects spo-
radic low-mass accretion and no clear correlation between
the SSFR and galaxy sizes is evident not shown A better
measure of the past histories of passive galaxies is the time
since they assembled tlbassemble dened as the lookback
time at which 50 of the stellar mass of the z  0 galaxy
has assembled into a single progenitor galaxy The bottom
panel of Fig 2 is coloured by the median value of tlbassemble
in each bin At a given stellar mass smaller galaxies typ-

might expect these to be equivalent This is however not
the case since individual galaxies evolve in mass can switch
between active and passive states and may merge Note that
observational estimates of the size evolution of galaxies have
been carried out using more sophisticated techniques such
as number density matching eg van Dokkum et al 2010
which aims to account for the evolution of galaxy masses
However accounting for the transition between active and
passive states is more dicult
In Fig 3 the solid curves and shaded regions indicate
the normalisation and scatter of the size - mass relation for
three bins of stellar mass at each simulation output Note
that the galaxies that fall in a particular bin can be dif-
ferent at each redshift due to the stellar mass evolution of
individual galaxies Comparing the sizes of galaxies over the
redshift interval z  2 to 0 the sizes of galaxies increase for
all stellar masses as seen in Fig 1 The trends are similar for
active and passive galaxy size - mass relations but the very
small sizes of the passive galaxy median size - mass relation
at high redshifts means that the factor by which the passive
sequence increases in size is somewhat greater than for active
galaxies as quantied in Fig 4 dashed curves For com-
parison observational data from VDW14 is represented by
points with error bars this re-emphasises the relatively good
agreement between EAGLE and observations discussed in
section 31
We now compare these trends to the typical size evolu-
tion of individual galaxies We select a sample of galaxies at
z  0 and compare the evolution of their main progenitors
sizes to the redshift dependence of the size - mass relation
We select galaxies in three z  0 stellar mass bins and sepa-
rate the population into active and passive types on the basis
of their z  0 SSFRs We then trace the galaxies back in
time using the merger trees described in section 22 identi-
fying a galaxys main progenitor at each previous simulation
output We combine the galaxies in each z  0 sample and
over plot their median size evolution using dashed lines in
It is important to note that galaxies which are passive
at z  0 will not necessarily be passive at higher redshifts
and similarly for active galaxies - see section 4 In fact
we see that the sizes of the samples that are active and
passive at z  0 become similar at higher redshift Indeed
the comoving number density of passive galaxies at z  2
is less than 10 of that at z  0 and most of the galaxies
that are passive at z  0 were active at high redshift As a
consequence the sizes of the passive z  0 progenitors lie
above the size - mass relation of high-z passive galaxies since
passive galaxies are typically smaller than active galaxies
at a given stellar mass The evolution of the size - mass
relation for passive galaxies is thus unlikely to reect the
evolution of individual passive galaxies A similar conclusion
was drawn by Carollo et al 2013 based on observational
measurements
Galaxies that are selected to lie in each of the stellar
mass bins at z  0 will generally not be in the same mass
bin at higher redshift For example only 3 of present-day
1010  M  10105 Mcid12 galaxies had progenitors with stellar
masses in this range at z  2 This results in an interesting
feature in Fig 3 at z cid62 2 for galaxies in the mass range
1010 Mcid12  M  1011 Mcid12 where even active galaxies at
this redshift are smaller by  02 dex than the progenitors
Figure 2 The z  0 size - mass relations for active and passive
galaxies are shown in the top and bottom panels respectively
Black contours indicate the 1 2 and 3 sigma levels The galaxy
sizes and stellar masses are binned with each point coloured by
the median SSFR for active galaxies upper panel or the time
since the main progenitor reached half its present-day stellar mass
for passive galaxies lower panel There is a clear correlation be-
tween the scatter in the size - mass relation and these properties
ically assembled earlier A similar trend with tlbassemble is
seen for active galaxies not shown
The assembly time of a galaxy reects the assembly his-
tory of the main progenitor and accounts for growth due to
both mergers and in situ star formation We have also exam-
ined the trends in the scatter with the time since formation
tlbform dened as the lookback time at which 50 of the
stellar mass in all of a galaxys progenitors has formed thus
eliminating the contribution of growth through mergers For
passive galaxies with M  10105 Mcid12 similar trends are
seen for tlbform and tlbassemble but at higher masses galaxy
sizes show no clear trend with tlbform with all massive pas-
sive galaxies irrespective of galaxy size forming at similar
times For these high-mass passive galaxies the mergers
that the galaxy has undergone must therefore play a role
in the galaxys size evolution We will further examine the
impact of mergers in section 34
33 The size evolution of individual galaxies

dividual galaxies with the redshift dependence of the size

Figure 3 The evolution of the size - mass relation with redshift for active and passive galaxies in 3 stellar mass bins Active and passive
galaxies are shown in blue and red respectively The median relations from the simulation are shown by solid curves while the shaded
regions enclose the 16th to 84th percentiles Individual points are shown for bins containing fewer than 10 galaxies Dashed lines show
the median evolution of individual galaxies selected at redshift 0 the panel in which they appear is based on their z  0 masses and the
active  passive classication is based on their z  0 SSFR The evolution of individual galaxies is determined from the merger trees
Note that at z  0 the galaxies used to compute the dashed curves may have a stellar mass that falls outside the range indicated in
each panel and that their classication into active  passive may not correspond to the colour of the line The horizontal dotted line
corresponds to the gravitational force softening in the simulation Measurements of the median and 1- scatter from van der Wel et al
2014 are shown as squares with error bars The redshift dependence of the size - mass relation for active galaxies is similar to the size
evolution of individual active galaxies However this is not true for passive galaxies owing to the evolving number density of passive
galaxies
of galaxies that are active and have the same mass at z  0
The median size - mass relation for active galaxies at z  2
has a shallow decrease in sizes with increasing stellar mass
for M  1010 Mcid12 with a similar trend at higher redshift
so lower-mass galaxies have larger sizes at z cid38 2 As the
progenitors of the z  0 sample typically have lower masses
than specied in each bin at z  2 their sizes fall  02 dex
above the median size size - mass relation
Not only are the sizes of the progenitors of galaxies that
are passive at z  0 similar to their active counterparts but
active and passive z  0 galaxies experience broadly sim-
ilar size growth In Fig 4 we show the size of galaxies at
z  0 relative to the size of their main progenitor at z  2
which we refer to as the size growth The solid lines show
the median ratio of the z  2 and 0 sizes of galaxies selected
based on their z  0 properties while the dashed lines show
size growth based on the size - mass relation Note that for
the solid lines the stellar mass shown on the x-axis applies
to z  0 For active galaxies the size growth determined
navely from the redshift dependence of the size - mass rela-
tion is similar to that based on individual galaxy histories
but the median size growth of individual passive galaxies is
overestimated by the size - mass relation by factors of a few
34 The dependence of size growth on stellar mass
It is clear from Fig 4 that galaxy size growth from z  2
to z  0 depends strongly on z  0 stellar mass There is
a strong trend with mass for both galaxy types with the
growth increasing from factors of  1  2 for M  1095
Mcid12 up to median factors of 3  4 for M  1011 Mcid12 This
trend with z  0 mass is signicantly more pronounced than
any relation with a galaxys z  0 active or passive classi-
cation where the size growth diers only by  30 Given
the weaker trend of the sizes with stellar mass at z  2 rel-
ative to z  0 in Fig 1 a strong trend with stellar mass is
anticipated
A strong connection is expected between galaxy merg-
ers and size growth eg Cole et al 2000 Naab Khochfar
 Burkert 2006 van der Wel et al 2009 As will be shown
by Qu  et al in prep the number of major and minor
mergers experienced by galaxies in the EAGLE simulation
is a strong function of stellar mass consistent with ndings
inferred from observations of close projected pairs The cor-
relation with z  0 stellar mass of both the size growth
and the number of mergers since z  2 implies a correlation
between size growth and mergers
To examine this correlation we consider the relation be-
tween the size growth and accreted mass fraction where the
accreted mass fraction is the ratio of stellar mass accreted
since z  2 to the z  0 stellar mass The accreted mass is
dened as the contribution to the stellar mass of the galaxy
from sources other than the main progenitor at a given time
where the stellar mass of the secondary branches is evalu-
ated when these galaxies are at a radius of ve times the
half mass radius of the main branch progenitor This def-

growth from z  2 to z  0 for individual galaxies selected based
on their z  0 stellar mass and SSFR Galaxies that are active
and passive at z  0 are shown in blue and red The size growth
of these galaxies is determined based on their main progenitors at
z  2 Individual galaxies are shown when there are fewer than
10 galaxies per stellar mass bin The shaded regions enclose the
16th to 84th percentiles Dashed lines show the dierence in the
medians of the size - mass relations at z  2 and z  0 based on
the data presented in Fig 1 Blue and red colours show the median
ratios of the active and passive galaxies respectively Note that for
the dashed curves the stellar mass plotted along the x-axis applies
at both z  2 and z  0 The size growth of individual galaxies
depends strongly on z  0 stellar mass but only weakly on z  0
galaxy type The growth determined from the redshift dependence
of the size - mass relation for passive galaxies overestimates the
median size growth of individual galaxies by factors of a few
inition ensures that any mass lost due to stripping before
the secondary branch coalesces with the main branch are
accounted for in the accreted mass Qu  et al in prep
We show in Fig 5 the residuals of the size growth -
Mz  0 relation as a function of the residuals of the
accreted mass fraction - Mz  0 relation We look at
the residuals of these relations to negate the correlation of
both the size growth and accreted fraction with stellar mass
In this way we test whether size growth and accreted mass
fraction are inherently related Indeed we see in Fig 5 that
this is the case excess size growth increases with an excess
in accreted mass fraction This implies that mergers directly
boost size growth beyond the stellar mass dependence of the
merger rate
In summary we nd that the growth in size of individ-
ual galaxies has a strong dependence on present-day stellar
mass and a much weaker dependence on present-day galaxy
classication The merger history of a galaxy goes some of
the way to explaining the dependence of size growth on z  0

Figure 5 Residuals of the relation between size growth since
z  2 and stellar mass as a function of the residuals of the rela-
tion between accreted mass fraction and stellar mass A positive
correlation indicates that galaxies of a xed stellar mass are larger
if they accreted a larger fraction of their mass The median rela-
tion is shown by the solid curve the 16th to 84th percentiles are
shown by the dashed curves The excess in size growth correlates
well with an excess in accreted mass
stellar mass galaxies that gain more of their mass from ac-
cretion experience larger size growth
4 SIZE EVOLUTION OF PASSIVE
HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXIES
In section 31 we showed that both in observations and in
the simulation passive galaxies at high redshift are typically
small  1  2 pkpc In the previous section however we
saw that the main progenitors of present-day passive galax-
ies have sizes that are similar to the progenitors of active
galaxies This raises an obvious question what happened to
the small passive galaxies that are seen at high redshift
We compare the number density of passive compact
galaxies to those observed in section 41 We look at the
evolution of all high-z passive galaxies in section 42 and fo-
cus on the evolution of the compact galaxy sample in section
41 The number density of compact galaxies
Observational studies have detected massive compact red
galaxies at high redshifts eg Cimatti et al 2004 Daddi
et al 2005 Trujillo et al 2006 van Dokkum et al 2008
Damjanov et al 2009 The comoving number density of
such galaxies is observed to increase from z cid46 3 with ev-
idence of a turn-over at z  1 VDW14 Damjanov et al

from the criteria of VDW14 applied here
We begin our
analysis by dening
pact galaxy selection as those that are passive with
R50pkpcM1011 Mcid12075  25 following VDW14
The evolution of the number density of passive galaxies sat-
isfying the compactness criteria in the simulation is shown
in Fig 6 Applying the same conditions as those applied to
the VDW14 sample namely that galaxies are redpassive
and have M  10105 Mcid12 solid curve a reasonably at
number density evolution is recovered from z  2 to 05
with a decline for z  05 Relaxing the mass constraint
to include all galaxies with M  1010 Mcid12 increases the
number density of galaxies identied but does not change
the overall evolutionary trend dashed curve Compared to
the observations of VDW14 also shown in Fig 6 the num-
ber density of compact galaxies in the simulation is too low
although there is a similar turn-over at low redshift This
discrepancy is at least in part due to the limited box size
of the simulation Indeed comparing with a simulation in
a smaller box of 503 cMpc3 with the same resolution and
subgrid physics as in Ref-L100N1504 no compact galaxies
are found with M  10105 Mcid12 implying an upper limit
to the number density of 8  106 cMpc3 which is much
lower than the O105 cMpc3 found at 05 cid38 z cid38 2 for
our ducial simulation Thus it is likely that the environ-
ments in which compact galaxies form are undersampled in
the EAGLE simulation volume Nonetheless we are inter-
ested in the evolution of the identied high-z passive com-
pact galaxies even though the simulation may not account
for all possible host environments of those observed
42 The destiny of high-z passive galaxies
As already noted the typical evolution of all high-z passive
galaxies cannot be understood from the evolutionary histo-
ries of the passive z  0 galaxy sample considered in section
33 However restricting the analysis to galaxies that sat-
isfy the compact galaxy criteria excludes many of the high-z
passive galaxies due to its strong dependence on stellar mass
see dot-dashed curve in Fig 7 In the following analysis we
consider the evolution of all high-z passive galaxies not only
those that are compact but we emphasise the evolution of
the compact sub-sample
We select all galaxies that are identied as passive in
at least one output in the redshift range 15  z  2 cor-
responding to the bottom right panel of Fig 1 We ensure
no galaxy is double counted if identied as passive in mul-
tiple outputs in this redshift range by ensuring we include
only the highest-redshift galaxy identied as passive on any
tree branch We identify 331 high-z passive galaxies among
the  10 000 galaxies with M  109 Mcid12 in this redshift
range4 Of the 331 44 are and remain the central galaxy of
their halo until z  0 83 are or become satellite galaxies

the simulation as a function of redshift where compact galaxies
are those with R50M1011 Mcid12075  25 pkpc as dened
by van der Wel et al 2014 The blue solid curve shows com-
pact galaxies that are passive and have M  10105 Mcid12 the
red dashed curve lowers the mass limit to M  1010 Mcid12 Error
bars on the simulation data indicate the Poisson error per redshift
bin The observational measurements of van der Wel et al 2014
are shown as points with 1   error bars Many massive com-
pact galaxies are identied in the simulation however the number
density falls below that of the observations at z cid62 1 which is at
least in part due to the limited box size of the simulation
20153 Several scenarios for the evolution of this population
have been proposed Trujillo et al 2006 suggest that the
population must grow in size by factors of 3 to 6 for exam-
ple through dry mergers and that the descendants are today
found on the size - mass relation van der Wel et al 2009
similarly suggest that growth through dry mergers com-
bined with the continuous emergence of passive galaxies ex-
plains the evolution of such galaxies Poggianti et al 2013
suggest that at most half of the population has evolved ap-
preciably in size based on the luminosity-weighted ages of
present-day compact galaxies Graham Dullo  Savorgnan
2015 conclude that the high-z compact galaxies may sim-
ply be the compact cores of local early-type disk galaxies
Recently the theoretical study of Wellons et al 2015a
considered the evolution of 35 compact galaxies identied
in the ILLUSTRIS simulation using a modied version
of the Barro et al 2013 criterion for compactness Their
key nding is that environment is an indicator of compact
galaxy evolution such that galaxies in denser environments
undergo greater size evolution Note that while our results
on compact galaxies are qualitatively comparable to Wellons
3 The existence of a turn-over depends on the denition of com-
pact see Damjanov et al 2015 for a comparison of dierent
selection criteria in the literature

7980 at z  2 to 10510 at z  15 due to the formation and mass
growth of galaxies

and merged galaxies The median size growth of each sample is
indicated by an arrow All galaxies show broad distributions in
size growth with several satellite galaxies decreasing in size
also increasing in mass The resulting z  0 descendants

lighted in Fig 7 using diamond symbols and black lines
These galaxies follow the trends of the central population
typically growing in both mass and size with some experi-
encing renewed star formation Note that none remain com-

A histogram of the size growth for centrals satellites
and compact galaxies is shown in Fig 8 The high-z pas-
sive galaxies that remain as centrals to z  0 increase in
size with a median size growth of a factor of 4 the growth
ranges from  2 to 30 Galaxies that are identied as satel-
lites at z  2 undergo a variety of size growth scenarios
some of these galaxies increase in size by up to a factor of
10 while others decrease in size with a median size growth
of  1 A decrease in galaxy size can result from environ-
mental processes such as stripping and harassment Moore
et al 1996 experienced by galaxies in dense environments
The compact galaxies which include centrals satellites and
merged systems all increase in size by factors of  2 to
40 although those experiencing size growth  20 have been
merged with a more massive system
43 Growth mechanisms of compact galaxies
We extend the analysis of the compact galaxies to consider
how they grow In Fig 9 we show the radial prole of 3 ex-
ample galaxies chosen to illustrate dierent growth mech-
anisms The left panels show the distribution of the star
particles at z  2 and of these same particles at z  0 In
all cases the stars migrate radially outwards The red and
yellow arrows compare the half-mass radii of these stars at
z  0 and 2 respectively The half-mass radii of the galax-
ies at z  0 are indicated by a blue arrow Comparing the

each galaxy Any galaxy lying to the right of the dash-dotted line

compact galaxies are shown not only those that are centrals at
z  0 The median size - mass relations for active blue and pas-
sive red galaxies are shown at z  0 and for the range 1  z  2
as solid and dashed lines respectively The horizontal dotted line
corresponds to the simulation gravitational softening All com-
pact galaxies increase in size by at least 02 dex from when they
were rst identied as passive and similar for all centrals None of
the high-z compact galaxies remain compact to z  0 Although
all galaxies shown are passive in the interval 15  z  2 not all
are passive at z  0
by z  0 while the remaining 204 merge with a more mas-
sive galaxy5 Focusing specically on compact high-z pas-
sive galaxies 26 of the 331 are compact at 15  z  2 9
are centrals at z  0 7 are satellites and the remaining 14
are merged into other systems With over 60 of all high-
z passive galaxies and  50 of compact galaxies merged
with more massive systems by z  0 the size evolution of
their descendant is not set primarily by the properties of the
passive or compact galaxy thus rendering these properties
largely inconsequential to the z  0 population
Fig 7 shows the evolution of the high-z passive galax-
ies in the size-mass plane for the central and compact selec-
tions All galaxies from the central high-z passive population
increase in size between z  2 and 0 with most galaxies

yellow and blue arrows shows how much of the total size
growth is due to the migration of z  2 stars relative to
other sources of size growth such as accretion or in situ star
formation The right panel shows the radial distributions of
stars formed since z  2 with those formed in the main
progenitor of the galaxy highlighted in green Fig 10 shows

The top panels show a galaxy whose size growth can
almost entirely be accounted for by the radial migration of
its z  2 star particles The half-mass radius of z  2 stars
at z  0 R50starsz2z  0 is approximately equal to
R50z  0 yellow and blue arrows respectively The star
particles added to the system at z  2 shown in the right
hand panel contribute less than 10 of the z  0 stellar
mass and are centrally concentrated Similar galaxies with
R50starsz2z  0 cid62 05R50z  0 account for 13 of the
26 compact galaxies In 6 of these galaxies the z  2 stars
dominate the z  0 stellar mass while in one further case
the z  2 stars account for 40 of the mass In the remaining
6 cases the compact galaxy is not the main progenitor of its
z  0 descendant and there is signicant evidence for mixing
of the z  2 star particles in these cases
system where
R50starsz2z  0 cid28 R50z  0 The origin of the
additional growth in size of this system can be understood
from the right-hand panel
In this galaxy many star
particles have been accreted dierence between blue and
green histograms particularly at large radii driving the
size growth The accreted particles account for  40
of Mz  0 with stars formed in situ accounting for a
further  20 and z  2 star particles after accounting
for stellar mass loss accounting for the remaining 40
The accreted stars do not dominate the stellar mass but
their radial distribution signicantly increases the half-mass
Not all galaxies with R50starsz2z  0 cid28 R50z  0
grow to their z  0 sizes due to accretion and mergers In
some cases star formation is a major contributor as seen
in the bottom panels of Fig 9 This star formation may be
triggered by mergers but the stars were formed in situ Note
that we cannot tell from this plot whether the stars formed
at large radii or whether they migrated outwards after their
formation However images of this galaxy at z  0 as seen in
the bottom panel of Fig 10 indicate that a disk of recently
formed stars is in place in the outskirts of the galaxy
It is evident from the simulation that the growth mech-
anisms of compact galaxies are diverse All compact galaxies
increase in size but some only grow through radial migra-
tion limiting their size growth to factors of  2 while others
grow through mergers andor renewed star formation where
the compact galaxy progenitor can be found at the core of
the z  0 descendant However over 50 of the compact
galaxies identied at z  2 have merged into more massive
systems by z  0 and their z  0 descendants therefore do
not obviously reect the compact galaxies histories While it
is tempting to conclude that the majority of compact galax-
ies merge into more massive systems by z  0 the shortfall
in the number density of compact galaxies in the simulation
precludes such a conclusion Likewise the relative impor-
tance of the three growth mechanisms for compact galaxies
in the simulation may not be accurate
In summary 60 of the high-z passive galaxies merge
into more massive systems by z  0 25 survive as satellites
to z  0 and the remaining 15 are centrals at z  0
Most centrals and  50 of the satellites that survive to
z  0 increase in size with many of the centrals experiencing
renewed star formation The compact sample of the high-
z passive galaxies undergoes size growth up to a factor of
 40 growing through stellar migration which however
yields only modest size growth renewed star formation and
mergers
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have studied the evolution of the galaxy size - mass re-
lation in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simula-
tion distinguishing between actively star forming and pas-
sive galaxy populations By comparing the half-mass radii
from the simulation with the sizes inferred from the obser-
vations of van der Wel et al 2014 we nd Figs 1 3
 The dependence of the sizes of simulated galaxies on
stellar mass redshift and star formation classication is
close to that of observed galaxies Galaxy sizes typically in-
crease with stellar mass and decreasing redshift and active
galaxies are typically larger than their passive counterparts
at a given stellar mass
 The level of agreement between the predicted and ob-
served sizes is of order 01  02 dex below 1011 Mcid12 equiv-
alent to 1-2 pkpc for 0 cid54 z cid54 2
 The scatter in the sizes at a given mass is also similar
in simulated and observed galaxies
Since the simulation agree relatively well with the ob-
servational data we used the simulation as a tool to explore
the size evolution of galaxy populations Our conclusions are
as follows
 We nd that the scatter in the size - mass relation cor-
relates well with the specic star formation rate for active
galaxies and with the time since assembly for passive galax-
ies Fig 2 Active galaxies of a given mass with higher
specic star formation rates are typically larger Similarly
passive galaxies at a given stellar mass that assembled more
recently are larger than those that formed earlier
 We compared the evolution of star forming and pas-
sive galaxies as determined from the redshift dependence of
the size - mass relation of the ensemble population which
can be accessed directly by observations and the typical
size evolution of individual galaxies based on their main
progenitors which can be traced explicitly in simulations
through galaxy merger trees For galaxies that are active
at z  0 the evolution of the size - mass relation for the
population is similar to the typical evolution of individual
objects However contrary to the rapid evolution of the size
- mass relation for the population of passive galaxies the
size evolution of individual present-day passive galaxies is
comparable to that of their star forming counterparts Figs
3 4 This dierence arises simply because most present-day
passive galaxies were star forming at higher redshifts
 The relative growth of galaxy sizes from z  2 to z 
0 increases strongly with present-day stellar mass Fig 4
This dependence is partly due to the inuence of galaxy
mergers on sizes galaxies with a higher fraction of accreted

EAGLE Evolution of galaxy sizes
Figure 10 Images of galaxies from Fig 9 at z  0 in face-on
and edge-on Top middle and bottom rows correspond to the
galaxies shown in the top middle and bottom rows of Fig 9 re-
spectively The images were produced using the radiative transfer
code skirt Baes et al 2011 applied to EAGLE galaxies as de-
scribed in Trayford  et al in prep Stellar light in g r and
i band SDSS lters is shown with dust attenuation Images are
shown in thumbnails of 60 pkpc per side The galaxy in the top
row increases in size due to the redistribution of its z  2 stars
the middle row galaxy grows by a larger factor due to accreted
stellar mass while the bottom row galaxy experiences renewed
star formation in the outskirts of the galaxy forming at disk at
mass relative to the median at xed mass experience an
excess in size growth Fig 5
 We investigated the evolution of 313 galaxies identi-
ed as passive in at least one output in the redshift range
15  z  2 Of these galaxies 65 merge into more massive
objects by z  0 26 are satellites and 14 are centrals at
z  0 Satellite galaxies experience diverse size growth with
many decreasing in both size and mass most likely due to
environmental processes such as tidal stripping The cen-
tral galaxies all increase in size between z  2 and 0 and
at z  0 are found to lie near the present-day size - mass
relations for the general population In  50 of central
galaxy cases they experience renewed star formation indi-
cating that instantaneous passive identication at high-z is
not indicative of a galaxys future evolution
 Of the high-z passive galaxies 26 were identied as

star particles in the galaxy at z  2 while the yellow histograms
show the distributions of the same star particles at z  0 In the
right panels all other star particles in the z  0 galaxies are shown
in blue Those which formed in situ are shown in green The scales
in the panels are the same enabling a direct comparison of the
numbers of star particles of each type The sizes of the galaxies
at z  2 0 are shown as red and blue arrows respectively The
yellow arrows show the half-mass radii of the z  2 star particles
at z  0 In all cases the z  2 star particles have migrated to
larger radii by z  0 resulting in galaxy size growth Further size
growth is contributed by accreted stars in the middle panels and
by in situ formation of stars in the lower panels

cosmic time while investigating the passive high-z popula-
tion further However we caution that we cannot rule out
that the sizes of the smallest galaxies cid46 1 pkpc are boosted
by the polytropic equation of state that is imposed on the
unresolved interstellar medium Higher-resolution simula-
tions that include the physics required to model the cold
interstellar gas phase are required to make further progress

APPENDIX A COMPARISON WITH OTHER
SIMULATIONS
In Fig A1 the size - mass relations from the EAGLE and
ILLUSTRIS galaxy formation simulations are compared in
4 redshift bins between 0 and 2 separating each galaxy pop-
ulation into active and passive galaxies using the SSFR cut
described in section 24 The EAGLE simulation is as in Fig
1 For ILLUSTRIS Vogelsberger et al 2014 the half-mass
radii stellar masses and star formation rates were obtained
from their public data release Nelson et al 2015 An aper-
ture of twice the half-mass radius is used measure to the

sive galaxies Observational data from van der Wel et al 2014
and Shen et al 2003 are shown as squares as in Fig 1
stellar masses and star formation rates as was applied in
previous ILLUSTRIS publications
For both hydrodynamical simulations galaxy sizes tend
to increase with stellar mass and there is an oset between
the sizes of active and passive galaxies in all redshift bins
shown Interestingly the overlap in galaxy sizes of active
and passive populations at M  1095 Mcid12 and M  10105
Mcid12 is seen in both simulations as discussed in section 31
While the trends are similar for both models there is a nor-
malisation oset in the sizes For M  1010 Mcid12 the IL-
LUSTRIS galaxies are typically a factor of two 03 dex
larger than EAGLE galaxies and than observed
APPENDIX B RESOLUTION TESTS
In Fig B1 strong and weak convergence tests for the evo-
lution of the galaxy size - mass relation are shown Three
simulations are presented Ref-L100N1504 which was used
in the main sections of the paper Ref-L025N0752 using
the same subgrid physics parameters as Ref-L100N1504 but
run in a 25 cMpc box with 8 times better mass resolution
and Recal-L025N0752 also in a 25 cMpc box with 8 times
the mass resolution but with recalibrated stellar feedback
and AGN parameters to better reproduce the local stellar
mass function The details of the recalibration of the high-
resolution run can be found in Schaye et al 2015
Comparing Ref-L100N1504 with Ref-L025N0752 tests
the strong convergence of the simulation this is the typi-
cal convergence test carried out on hydrodynamical simu-
lations while comparing with Recal-L025N0752 tests the

2015 to account for the necessity of using weakly con-
strained subgrid physics prescriptions Note that more mas-

higher redshift good convergence is maintained for M  1010

sive galaxies form in the 100 cMpc3 simulation than the
25 cMpc3 simulations due to the larger box size
In the lowest redshift bin 0  z  05 reasonable
agreement is seen between all simulations although the re-
calibrated model Recal-L025N0752 exhibits a downturn at
M cid29 1010 Mcid12 At z  1 the size - mass relations at
M  1010 Mcid12 of the 25 cMpc simulations diverge with
the Ref-L100N1504 simulation falling in between
In the most massive galaxies in Recal-L025N0752 the
weaker density dependence of the subgrid model for feedback
from star formation which was introduced to better repro-
duce the galaxy stellar mass function allows more compact
galaxies to form at high redshift relative to Ref-L100N1504
Meanwhile in the Ref-L025N0752 simulation massive galax-
ies are larger because the feedback is more ecient in high-
density regions
APPENDIX C VARIATIONS IN GALAXY SIZE
DEFINITION
We look at the variations in galaxy sizes due to the 3-D
spherical aperture within which the total galaxy mass is
measured and the eects of projection In Fig C1 the varia-
tion of the median galaxy size - mass relations recovered by
applying dierent size denitions are compared at z  0 1
and 2 The half-mass radius computed based on the total
stellar mass and the mass within 3-D 100 pkpc and 30 pkpc
apertures yield similar galaxy sizes for stellar masses below
10105 Mcid12 as is the case for the mass see Schaye et al 2015
but larger apertures result in larger sizes above this mass
In this paper the size is dened as the half-mass radius com-
puted based on the mass within 100 pkpc apertures This
aperture very closely replicates the half-mass radius deter-
mined by including all particles associated with a subhalo
for galaxies with M  1011 Mcid12 However it excludes stars
far out in the most massive halos in the simulation which
would be dicult to observe and are labelled intra-cluster
As well as comparing the eect of dierent apertures
we compute projected radii and compute the half-mass ra-
dius based on Sersic ts to the mass prole These variations
result in systematic osets in the size - mass relation rela-
tive to the 3-D half-mass radius measurement Due to the
systematic nature of these osets we present only the 3-
D half-mass radius measurement throughout as variations
in the denition do not impact the trends in galaxy sizes
from the simulations We note however that the denition
of galaxy may result in a systematic decrease of up to 02
dex A similar systematic oset has been found when com-
puting observed radii using circularised and non-circularised
methods Dutton et al 2011
APPENDIX D DEFINITION OF PASSIVE
GALAXIES
In this appendix we discuss the impact of the denition of ac-
tive and passive galaxies on the resulting dierence in sizes
reported between these two galaxy types Fig 1 As dis-
cussed in section 24 the active  passive denition is based
on the SSFR of a galaxy In observations however where
star formation rates must be inferred the denition of active
and passive galaxies often depends on the observed colours
of galaxies eg van der Wel et al 2014 To determine if
any signicant dierence arises by applying a colour cut as
opposed to a SSFR cut at z  0 1 and 2 we produce UVJ
colours for all simulated galaxies with M  109 Mcid12 and
compare the median size - mass relations
Galaxy colours from the simulation are produced using
the stellar population synthesis models of Bruzual  Charlot
2003 and applying the dust model of Charlot  Fall 2000
A full description of the method can be found in Trayford
et al 2015 We apply two colour cuts to the UVJ plane
that of VDW14 and of Muzzin et al 2013 We include the
colour cut of Muzzin et al because at low redshift where the
VDW14 sample is small as commented on in section 31
the VDW14 cut applied intersects the active or blue galaxy
locus resulting in an inappropriate division into active and
passive galaxies6
In Fig D1 the median size - mass relations for simulated
galaxies at z  0 1 and 2 are shown for all 3 denitions of
active and passive galaxies SSFR UVJ applying the cut of
VDW14 and UVJ with the cut of Muzzin et al The median
sizes of active galaxies are similar at all redshifts shown
irrespective of the details of the classication For passive
galaxies there is always a clear oset from the sizes of active
6 Note that Trayford et al 2015 showed that at z  01 the
galaxy colours produced by EAGLE are in good agreement with
observations so for a larger observational sample a similar issue
may arise when applying the UVJ cut of VDW14

Figure C1 The median size - mass relation for galaxy sizes computed within dierent apertures and applying dierent measurement
techniques at z  0 1 and 2 Solid curves show the 3-D half-mass radius and dot-dashed curves show the projected half-mass radius
based on a Sersic t to the mass prole Green curves shows the radius based on all star particles bound to the subhalo while red and
blue curves only consider stars within 3-D 100 pkpc and 30 pkpc apertures respectively The solid red curves corresponds to the sizes
used in this work while the blue dot-dashed curves indicate the sizes used by Schaye et al 2015 The horizontal dotted line shows the
gravitational force softening length in the simulation The aperture measurements aect the galaxy sizes at stellar masses  10105 Mcid12
with galaxy size increasing with increasing aperture The dierent size measurement techniques produce similar trends with stellar mass
but there is a small systematic oset in size Note that we dene the size as the 3-D half-mass radius in a 100 pkpc aperture
galaxies but the median sizes of the passive galaxies show
some variation between the cuts This is due to the dierent
number of galaxies selected depending on the specics of
the cut Note that at z  2 the sample of passive galaxies
selected from the simulation is small as for all cuts the
galaxies are predominantly active This causes some noise
in the size - mass relation at this redshift
Note that the impact of the denition of passive galaxies
on the passive fraction is explored in more detail in Trayford
 et al in prep
In summary how galaxies are classied results in neg-
ligible dierence in the sizes of active galaxies while the
same is true for low-redshift passive galaxies For all cuts
the active  passive galaxy size oset is maintained

between the dierent denitions At redshifts 1 and 2 dierences appear for the passive galaxies due to the dierent numbers of galaxies
identied by each method however the oset in size between active and passive galaxies is evident for all three denitions Note that
the noise in the z  2 passive galaxy sample is due to the small number of passive galaxies in the simulation at such a high redshift
