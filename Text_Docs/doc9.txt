ABSTRACT
We present the evolution of galaxy sizes, from redshift 2 to 0, for actively star forming
and passive galaxies in the cosmological hydrodynamical 1003 cMpc3 simulation of
the EAGLE project. We ﬁnd that the sizes increase with stellar mass , but that the
relation weakens with increasing redshift. Separating galaxies by their star formation
activity, we ﬁnd that passive galaxies are typically smaller than active galaxies at ﬁxed
stellar mass. These trends are consistent with those found in observations and the level
of agreement between the predicted and observed size - mass relation is of order 0.1
dex for z < 1 and 0.2–0.3 dex from redshift 1 to 2. We use the simulation to compare
the evolution of individual galaxies to that of the population as a whole. While the
evolution of the size-stellar mass relation for active galaxies provides a good proxy
for the evolution of individual galaxies, the evolution of individual passive galaxies is
not well represented by the observed size - mass relation due to the evolving number
density of passive galaxies. Observations of z ∼ 2 galaxies have revealed an abundance
of massive red compact galaxies, that depletes below z ∼ 1. We ﬁnd that a similar
population forms naturally in the simulation. Comparing these galaxies to their z = 0
descendants, we ﬁnd that all compact galaxies grow in size due to the high-redshift
stars migrating outwards. Approximately 60% of the compact galaxies increase in size
further due to renewed star formation and/or mergers.

1 INTRODUCTION
Understanding and reproducing the observed evolution of
galaxies is one of the key aims of modern cosmology. Galax-
ies are thought to form as a result of gas cooling in the grav-
itational potential dominated by dark matter (e.g. White &
Rees 1978; White & Frenk 1991). As the baryons cool, they
form a rotating disk. Assuming the gas initially has a spe-
ciﬁc angular momentum similar to that of the dark matter
and that angular momentum is conserved, the ΛCDM frame-
work predicts the evolution of the sizes of disk galaxies (Fall
& Efstathiou 1980; Mo, Mao & White 1998). In practice,
however, the process of baryon condensation is complicated
by the formation of stars and black holes and the energy

that they feed back into the surrounding gas. The angular
momentum of the stars that form may therefore diﬀer signif-
icantly from that of the halo. The evolution of galaxy sizes
is therefore a critical test of the physical processes of galaxy
formation.
Recent observational surveys of the z ∼ 0 Universe
sample millions of galaxies, probing the full range of galaxy
masses and sizes (e.g. Shen et al. 2003; Dutton et al. 2011;
Baldry et al. 2012). The evolution of the sizes of galaxies
from the present day up to redshift 3 has been mapped for
a broad range of galaxy masses and types using the Hub-
ble Space Telescope with CANDELS imaging (Patel et al.
2013; van Dokkum et al. 2014; van der Wel et al. 2014, here-
after VDW14). Galaxies in the distant Universe are smaller
at ﬁxed mass than local systems, suggesting that galaxies
undergo signiﬁcant size evolution.
Furlong et al
At z (cid:38) 1, observations reveal a class of very compact
passive galaxies, often referred to as “red nuggets” (e.g.
Cimatti et al. 2004; Daddi et al. 2005; Trujillo et al. 2006).
Such galaxies are rare in the nearby Universe (Poggianti
et al. 2013, VDW14). The evolutionary path of individual
compact galaxies cannot be inferred from the observational
data alone since galaxies evolve in both stellar mass and size,
and may merge with other systems. It is thus challenging to
establish what becomes of these compact passive galaxies
from observational evidence alone. Simulations, such as the
one considered here, can provide the necessary link to the
present-day galaxy population.
Until recently, the sizes of galaxies produced by hy-
drodynamical simulations were not consistent with obser-
vations: while the masses of the galaxies tended to be too
large, their sizes were too small (e.g. Scannapieco et al.
2012). The dense gas transfers angular momentum to the
outer halo, which is exacerbated if too much gas is turned
into stars, leading to what became known as the angular mo-
mentum catastrophe (Katz & Gunn 1991; Navarro & White
1994). This problem can be overcome by the inclusion of
energetic feedback, which tends to expel the lowest angular
momentum gas from the forming galaxy, while also regulat-
ing the stellar mass formed (e.g. Sales et al. 2010; Brook
et al. 2011, 2012a). Including realistic and eﬃcient feedback
has resulted in more reasonable galaxy sizes for disk galaxies
in small galaxy samples or over speciﬁc mass ranges (Gov-
ernato et al. 2004; Okamoto & Millis 2005; Sales et al. 2010;
Brook et al. 2012b; McCarthy et al. 2012; Munshi et al. 2013;
Aumer et al. 2013; Hopkins et al. 2014; Marinacci, Pakmor &
Springel 2014). However, reproducing the observed sizes of
the general galaxy population remains a challenge for many
cosmological simulations. The production of realistic galaxy
stellar masses in such simulations, or indeed a broad range
of galaxy scaling relations, is a necessary, but not suﬃcient,
criterion for the reproduction of galaxy sizes (Scannapieco
et al. 2012; Crain et al. 2015).
The distribution of galaxy sizes has been studied in
cosmological simulations in the work of Sales et al. (2010)
and McCarthy et al. (2012), who focused on the z = 2 and
z = 0 populations in the OWLS (Schaye et al. 2010) and
GIMIC (Crain et al. 2009) simulations respectively. A recent
study based on the ILLUSTRIS simulation (Vogelsberger
et al. 2014) by Snyder et al. (2015) examined the size-mass-
morphology relation at z = 0. The galaxy sizes were shown
to be a factor of ∼ 2 too large relative to observations at this
redshift and the evolution of sizes was not examined. Using
the same simulation, Wellons et al. (2015b,a) looked at the
formation and evolution of z = 2 massive compact galaxies
respectively. The size evolution of the compact galaxies was
found to depend on the environment in which the galaxies
are found. We will also examine the evolution of compact
galaxies, but in the broader context of the high-z passive
population in the simulation, after comparing the full galaxy
population to observations, ﬁnding good agreement.
In this study we investigate the evolution of the galaxy
size - mass relation and evolutionary tracks of individ-
ual galaxies using the Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies
and their Environments (EAGLE) simulation suite (Schaye
et al. 2015; Crain et al. 2015). The largest of the EA-
GLE simulations evolves a volume of 1003 comoving Mpc3
(cMpc3), with 13,200 galaxies of stellar mass M∗ > 109 M(cid:12)
and 3,562 with M∗ > 1010 M(cid:12) at z = 0. This sample enables
us to study the evolution of galaxy sizes from z = 2 to the
present day, while separating the population into those that
are star forming and passive.
The simulation combines gravitational N-body solvers
with state-of-the-art smoothed particle hydrodynamics and
subgrid models for the formation of stars, metal-dependent
cooling, stellar mass loss and energy injection from stars
and black holes. The simulation reproduces a wide range of
properties of observed galaxies with unprecedented ﬁdelity
(Schaye et al. 2015). The observed present-day galaxy stel-
lar mass function, galaxy disk sizes and black hole masses
were used to calibrate the uncertain parameters of the sub-
grid components, but other aspects of the model, such as
the star formation rates (Schaye et al. 2015), galaxy colours
(Trayford et al. 2015), rotation curves (Schaller et al. 2015b),
the gas content of galaxies (Lagos et al. 2015; Bahe et al.
2015), and the inter-galactic hydrogen and metal absorption
lines (Schaye et al. 2015; Rahmati et al. 2015), as well as the
evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and star for-
mation rates (Furlong et al. 2015) represent predictions of
the simulation and exhibit broad agreement with observa-
tions. A full discussion of the model calibration/validation
philosophy can be found in Schaye et al. (2015) and Crain
et al. (2015).
Although the z = 0 galaxy disk sizes were considered
during the calibration of the EAGLE simulation, the evolu-
tion of galaxy sizes is a prediction of the simulation. More-
over, the simulations allow us to explore the diﬀerence in size
between galaxies that are actively forming stars and those
that are passive, a distinction that was not made during
the calibration. Passive galaxies are particularly prevalent
at high stellar masses, and primarily grow in mass through
galaxy mergers. Such galaxies are observed to be smaller
than disk galaxies of the same stellar mass (e.g. Shen et al.
2003; Baldry et al. 2012; van der Wel et al. 2014) provid-
ing a key test of the simulation. This comparison has fur-
ther implications than simply validating the model since the
simulation can also help us interpret the observational data.
For example, we can trace galaxies as they evolve, enabling
us to address issues such as the origin of the size - mass
relation and to relate galaxy masses and sizes at one red-
shift to another redshift. In particular, we will show that
the simulation produces a population of high-redshift com-
pact galaxies, and we trace the descendants of these galaxies
to examine their properties at the present day.
The layout of the paper is as follows. Brief descriptions
of the EAGLE simulations and the galaxy selection can be
found in section 2, where we also discuss the sensitivity of
galaxy size to its deﬁnition. In section 3 we consider the
sizes of the full galaxy population. We compare the sizes
of simulated galaxies, and their evolution, to observational
measurements in section 3.1, ﬁnding good agreement, par-
ticularly relative to previous simulation results (Appendix
A). In section 3.2 we determine the origin of the scatter in
the size - mass relation. We then explore the evolution of
individual galaxies in section 3.3 and the mass dependence
of the size growth in section 3.4. In section 4 we look at the
evolution of high-redshift passive galaxies, with a particular
focus on compact galaxies. A summary of our main ﬁndings
and concluding remarks are presented in section 5.

2 GALAXIES IN THE EAGLE SIMULATIONS
The production and selection of simulated galaxies are de-
scribed below. We begin with an overview of the primary
EAGLE simulation in section 2.1, followed by a discussion
of the deﬁnition and selection of galaxies applied to the sim-
ulation in section 2.2. In section 2.3 we present our deﬁni-
tion of galaxy size and discuss alternative choices. Further
details on alternative galaxy size deﬁnitions can be found
in Appendix C. Finally, the galaxy classiﬁcation applied in
this study is introduced and discussed in section 2.4, with
further details given in Appendix D.
2.1 Simulation overview
For this study we use cosmological hydrodynamical simula-
tions from the EAGLE project. We focus primarily on the
largest of the simulations, Ref-L100N1504, a (100 cMpc)3
simulation with baryonic particle masses of 1.2 × 106 M(cid:12)
which provides a large sample of galaxies resolved by at least
1000 star particles. These galaxies span more than two or-
ders of magnitude in stellar mass and are found in a diverse
range of environments.
We also analyse two smaller, higher-resolution simu-
lations, Recal-L025N0752 and Ref-L025N0752. The high-
resolution simulations are used for convergence tests pre-
sented in Appendix B. The box sizes and resolutions of
these simulations are summarised in Table 1. The Ref-
L025N0752 simulation has a factor of 8 (2) better mass
(spatial) resolution and employs the same subgrid param-
eters as Ref-L100N1504; comparing these two simulations
tests the strong convergence of the simulation (see Schaye
et al. (2015) for deﬁnitions and discussion of the concepts of
“strong” and “weak” convergence). Recal-L025N0752 also
has a factor of 8 better mass resolution but was recalibrated
to better reproduce the observed local Universe galaxy stel-
lar mass function at this higher resolution. This simulation
enables examination of the weak convergence of the simula-
The EAGLE simulation suite adopts a ﬂat ΛCDM
cosmogony with parameters inferred from the Planck data
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2014); ΩΛ = 0.693, Ωm = 0.307,
Ωb = 0.048, σ8 = 0.8288, ns = 0.9611 and H0 = 67.77 km
s−1 Mpc−1. The Chabrier (2003) stellar initial mass function
(IMF) is adopted. Galaxy stellar masses are computed by
summing the mass of star particles located within a spher-
ical aperture of 30 physical kiloparsecs (pkpc) centred on
the potential minimum of the galaxy, as used by Schaye
et al. (2015). Star formation rates are computed within the
same aperture. Galaxy sizes are quoted in physical units
(e.g. pkpc), unless stated otherwise.
A complete description of the EAGLE code and sub-
grid physics was presented by Schaye et al. (2015); here we
provide a concise overview. Initial conditions at z = 127
were generated using 2nd order Lagrangian perturbation the-
ory (Jenkins 2010). The initial conditions were evolved us-
ing a parallel N-body smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
code, a modiﬁed version of Gadget-3 (based on Gadget-
2, last described by Springel 2005). The SPH implemen-
tation in EAGLE includes the Hopkins (2013) pressure-
entropy formulation, a time-step limiter (Durier & Dalla
Vecchia 2012), artiﬁcial viscosity and conduction (Dehnen
c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–17
EAGLE: Evolution of galaxy sizes
& Aly 2012) and the Wendland (1995) C2 kernel; this set of
changes to the SPH is collectively referred to as Anarchy
(Dalla Vecchia in prep., see also Appendix A of Schaye et
al. 2015). Anarchy alleviates the problems associated with
standard SPH in modelling contact discontinuities and ﬂuid
instabilities. Schaller et al. (2015a) show, however, that at
the resolution of EAGLE the impact of the hydrodynam-
ics solver on galaxy properties in simulations is small for
M∗ (cid:46) 1010.5 M(cid:12).
To model astrophysical processes that occur on scales
below the resolution of the simulation, subgrid schemes are
applied. Included are subgrid models for radiative cooling
and photo-heating, star formation, stellar mass loss and
metal enrichment, stellar feedback from massive stars, black
hole growth and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN).
The cooling and photo-heating model uses the imple-
mentation of Wiersma, Schaye & Smith (2009). Abundances
of 11 elements are considered when computing radiative
cooling rates, tabulated from Cloudy (version 07.02 Ferland
et al. 1998) assuming ionization equilibrium and exposure to
the cosmic microwave background and the Haardt & Madau
(2001) model for the evolving UV/X-ray background.
Above a metallicity-dependent density threshold, star
particles form stochastically, with the star formation rate
determined from the gas pressure such that it reproduces the
observed Kennicutt-Schmidt law (Kennicutt 1998; Schaye &
Dalla Vecchia 2008). Star particles represent simple stellar
populations described by a Chabrier IMF. The Jeans length
for the cold phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) cannot
be resolved by the simulations and consequently a pressure
ﬂoor is imposed,corresponding to a polytropic equation of
state (Peos ∝ ργeos ), enabling the multi-phase ISM to be
treated as a single-phase ﬂuid.
Stellar mass loss is based on the implementation of
Wiersma et al. (2009) where mass lost from asymptotic gi-
ant branch stars, through winds of massive stars, and su-
pernovae (both core collapse and type Ia), is returned to
the ISM over the lifetime of the stellar population.
Prompt feedback associated with star formation is im-
plemented following Dalla Vecchia & Schaye (2012) where
the thermal energy available from stars formed is stochasti-
cally distributed to neighbouring gas particles, without any
preferential direction. Energy injection always results in a
temperature increase of ∆T = 107.5 K; such a temperature
jump is required to mitigate numerical radiative losses at
the resolution of the EAGLE simulations (Dalla Vecchia &
Schaye 2012). The probability of energy injection depends
on the metallicity and density of the local environment in
which the star particle formed and is calibrated to reproduce
the observed local Universe galaxy stellar mass function and
the size - mass relation for disk galaxies, where the galaxy
sizes are a calibration diagnostic that is necessary to break
degeneracies between diﬀerent models that reproduce the
galaxy stellar mass function (Crain et al. 2015). See Schaye
et al. (2015) and Crain et al. (2015) for a full description
and motivation of the energy scaling.
The gas particle at the minimum of the potential of a
halo is converted to a seed black hole of 105 h−1M(cid:12) when a
halo ﬁrst reaches a mass of 1010 h−1M(cid:12) (Springel, Di Matteo
& Hernquist 2005). The sub-grid black hole accretes matter

et al. (2015), adapted as described by Schaye et al. (2015),

which reduces the accretion rate for high angular momentum
gas. Of the matter accreted, a fraction of 0.015 of the rest-
mass energy is returned to the surrounding medium in the
form of energy. This feedback from AGN is implemented
thermally, as for the stellar feedback, but with a temperature
jump of ∆T = 108.5 K for Ref models and ∆T = 109 K
for the Recal model.
2.2 Sample selection
Galaxy identiﬁcation is carried out as described by Schaye
et al. (2015). The friends-of-friends method with a linking
length of 0.2 identiﬁes overdensities that we refer to as halos.
Self-bound substructures within halos are identiﬁed using
SUBFIND (Springel et al. 2001; Dolag et al. 2009). We refer
to the stellar component of the subhalos as the galaxies in
the simulation. A central galaxy corresponds to the most
massive subhalo within a halo.
To enable comparison to the observational study of
VDW14, we bin galaxies in redshift intervals of ∆z = 0.5. In
the four redshift bins spanning 0 (cid:54) z (cid:54) 2, we combine be-
tween 3 and 6 simulation outputs. We include galaxies with
stellar masses M∗ > 109 M(cid:12), to ensure that the masses, sizes
and star formation rates of galaxies are well sampled (see
Schaye et al. (2015) and Furlong et al. (2015) for convergence
studies). We limit the sample to galaxies with z (cid:54) 2, as the
typical size of galaxies at higher redshifts becomes compara-
ble to the spatial resolution limit of the simulation, partic-
ularly for passive galaxies. The resolution limit is set by the
minimum of the gravitational force softening and the Jeans
length (∼ 2pkpcfgas(nH/0.1cm−3)−0.5(T /104K)0.5, where
fgas is the gas fraction, nH is the hydrogen number density
and T is the temperature). The polytropic equation of state
is implemented to avoid artiﬁcial fragmentation, thus sup-
pressing fragmentation below the Jeans length. This value,
however, varies depending on the gas fraction and the den-
sity at which stars in the galaxy formed.
The sample contains 208,953 galaxies over the redshift
range 0 to 2, of which 182,481 are actively forming stars and
26,472 are passive as deﬁned in section 2.4. Further details
of the galaxy sample can be found in Table 2.
We use galaxy merger trees to trace the evolution of
individual galaxies. The merger trees are built by tracing
the most bound particles of each subhalo between consec-
utive snapshots to determine the progenitor galaxies of all

ent redshift bins between zlow and zhigh, including the division

redshift and is given by log10(SSFRlim(z)/Gyr−1) = 0.5z − 2,

z = 0 galaxies. The main progenitor branch is that with
the largest branch mass, as deﬁned by De Lucia & Blaizot
(2007). This method is similar to that of the D-halo merger
trees described by Jiang et al. (2014). A full description of
the trees is presented by Qu & et al. (in prep.), with their
public release1 discussed by McAlpine et al. (2015).
2.3 Galaxy sizes
While the abundance, range and quality of the observational
data available to measure galaxy sizes are continuously im-
proving, the recovered sizes from the data typically depend,
among other things, on the wavelength of the observations
(e.g. Kelvin et al. 2012; Lange et al. 2015, VDW14), the as-
sumed ﬁtting proﬁle (e.g. Head, Lucey & Hudson 2015) and
the surface brightness of galaxies. While it is possible to “ob-
serve” simulated galaxies in a similar way to real galaxies
(Torrey et al. 2015; Trayford & et al. in prep.) and use these
observations to measure galaxy sizes that can be compared
to a particular data set, in this study we are interested in
the physical growth and evolution of galaxies, and in making
predictions that can be compared with a variety of data sets.
Hence, we use the physical half-stellar mass radius, R50, as
our deﬁnition of galaxy size, thus limiting systematic eﬀects
related to observations.
The half-mass radius is based on the total mass of
all gravitationally bound stellar particles within a spheri-
cal aperture of radius 100 pkpc about the minimum of the
gravitational potential of a galaxy. This deﬁnition of the
half-mass radius of simulated galaxies is not directly depen-
dent on the galaxy’s shape or surface brightness. We apply
the 100 pkpc aperture to ensure that star particles located
far out in the halo, but which are assigned to the galaxy
by the subhalo ﬁnder, are excluded from the calculation.
The aperture only aﬀects the most massive galaxies in the
simulation, with M∗ > 1011 M(cid:12), as shown in Appendix C.
Note that the size deﬁnition here diﬀers from that used
by Schaye et al. (2015), where S´ersic ﬁts to the projected
stellar mass proﬁle within 30 pkpc apertures were used to
measure the half-mass radius. As mentioned above, in this
study we aim to avoid assumptions about the proﬁle of the
galaxies. A comparison between the sizes used by Schaye
et al. (2015) and here can also be found in Appendix C.

2.4 Galaxy classiﬁcation
We distinguish between galaxies that are actively forming
stars and those that are passive. The division between ac-
tive and passive galaxies may be based on a cut in colour or
˙M∗/M∗ (SSFR). Following Fur-
speciﬁc star formation rate,
long et al. (2015), we apply a SSFR cut that evolves with
redshift, chosen to lie approximately 1 decade below the ob-
served main sequence of star formation at each redshift. We
set the SSFR limit as log10(SSFRlim(z)/Gyr−1) = 0.5z − 2,
z ∈ [0, 2]. It was shown by Furlong et al. (2015) that the frac-
tion of passive galaxies in the simulation is broadly consis-
tent with observations over this redshift range. The impact
of variations in the deﬁnition of active and passive galaxies
on galaxy sizes is presented in Appendix D, while Trayford
& et al. (in prep.) show that the percentage of galaxies iden-
tiﬁed as passive is somewhat sensitive to this deﬁnition.
3 SIZE EVOLUTION OF THE GENERAL
POPULATION
We begin in section 3.1 with a comparison of the predicted
size - mass relation with observations from 0 (cid:54) z (cid:54) 2. The
scatter in the relation is considered in section 3.2. Having
demonstrated in these sections that EAGLE reproduces the
observed trends for galaxy sizes, we explore the size evolu-
tion of individual galaxies in section 3.3 and the variation
in size evolution with mass in section 3.4.
3.1 The redshift dependence of the size - mass
relation
The galaxy size - mass relation is shown in Fig. 1, with
diﬀerent panels showing the relation at diﬀerent redshifts. In
the simulation, galaxy sizes decrease with increasing redshift
at ﬁxed stellar mass (dashed curves repeat the relations at
0 < z < 0.5 for reference). We restrict the comparison to
z < 2, where the sizes of simulated galaxies typically lie
above the gravitational force softening used in the simulation
(indicated by horizontal dotted lines). At z < 1 size increases
with stellar mass, with a larger increase in size per stellar
mass increment above ∼ 1010.5 M(cid:12). In the interval 1 (cid:54) z (cid:54)
2, galaxy sizes show a weaker trend with stellar mass.
In each panel, the simulated galaxy sample is separated
into active and passive galaxies. Passive galaxies are typi-
cally smaller than active galaxies by > 0.1 dex at all redshifts
for stellar masses between 109.5 and 1011 M(cid:12). At higher
masses (which are only sampled at z < 1 by the simula-
tion) the size - mass relations of active and passive galaxies
converge. At M∗ < 109.5 M(cid:12) the size - mass relations of
both galaxy types are also similar, but this is a consequence
of limited resolution. It was shown by Schaye et al. (2015)
and Furlong et al. (2015) that for M∗ < 109.5 M(cid:12) the star
formation rates of galaxies are poorly sampled compared to
the higher-resolution L025N0752 simulations. As a result,
in this mass regime the classiﬁcation into passive and active
galaxies is not robust. Furthermore, the Jeans length cor-
responding to the equation of state that is imposed on the
unresolved interstellar medium may be a limiting factor for
the galaxy sizes in this regime (for R50 (cid:46) 1 pkpc).

EAGLE: Evolution of galaxy sizes
To compare the size - mass relations of simulated galax-
ies with observational constraints, we also plot the mea-
surements of VDW14 in Fig. 1. This enables us to com-
pare with a set of uniformly-analysed observational mea-
surements over the full redshift range. The eﬀective radius
of galaxies in the VDW14 sample is deﬁned as the major
axis of the ellipse containing half the total ﬂux associated
with a single component S´ersic ﬁt applied to the 2-D light
proﬁle of the galaxy. The eﬀective radius is converted to a
rest-frame wavelength of 5000˚A by empirically establishing
the dependence of the radius on wavelength. We supple-
ment the VDW14 measurements with z = 0 counterparts
presented by Shen et al. (2003), since the limited volume of
the CANDELS survey used by VDW14 precludes it from
adequately sampling galaxies with M∗ > 1011 M(cid:12) in the
lowest redshift bin. Shen et al. (2003) infer the size - mass
relation from SDSS (Stoughton et al. 2002) over the redshift
range 0 to 0.3, where galaxy type is deﬁned using concen-
tration, S´ersic index and photometric colours. Their larger
sample in this redshift bin extends the observations of the
size - mass relation to M∗ ∼ 1012 M(cid:12). Note, however, that
the circularised radii2 used by Shen et al. (2003) are typi-
cally a factor of 1.4 smaller than uncircularised radii, or the
major axis radii, used by VDW14, as discussed by Dutton
et al. (2011). To account for this diﬀerence, the Shen et al.
(2003) sizes are multiplied by a factor of 1.4 in Fig. 1. For
both active and passive galaxies the measurements of Shen
et al. (2003) and VDW14 are similar at M∗ < 1010.5 M(cid:12),
with active galaxies typically being larger than passive types
of the same stellar mass for M∗ < 1011 M(cid:12). At the higher
masses probed only by Shen et al. (2003), the sizes of both
types overlap. At higher redshifts the normalisation of the
observed size - mass relation decreases while the oﬀset in
size between the active and passive galaxies remains.
The trends seen in the simulation, namely an increase
in galaxy size with stellar mass, an oﬀset in size between
active and passive galaxies and an increasing size with de-
creasing redshift, are all consistent with the observed trends.
Although the normalisation of the size - mass relation of lo-
cal galaxy disk sizes was used to calibrate the simulations,
it is remarkable that the relation for active galaxies traces
that of the VDW14 observations within ∼ 0.1 dex for all
stellar masses shown up to z = 2. In the lowest redshift bin
at M∗ > 1011 M(cid:12) however, where no CANDELS measure-
ments are available, there is a larger oﬀset of ∼ 0.2 dex with
respect to the Shen et al. (2003) data, although we note that
this may be the result of the relatively bright surface bright-
ness limit of the SDSS survey (which can be mimicked by
applying a diﬀerent aperture to the simulated galaxies, the
eﬀect of which is demonstrated in Appendix C). The sizes of
passive galaxies are consistent with the observational mea-
surements to within 0.1 – 0.2 dex, with the largest discrep-
ancies at M∗ < 109.5 M(cid:12), where adequate resolution renders
the deﬁnition of active and passive galaxies ambiguous. A
comparison with the sizes of simulated galaxies from the
ILLUSTRIS simulation (Vogelsberger et al. 2014), which
are found to be a factor of two larger than in EAGLE and
observations, is presented in Appendix A.

Figure 1. Galaxy size – mass relation in the Ref-L100N1504 EAGLE simulation compared to observations. Panels show diﬀerent
redshifts, from 0 to 2. Active and passive galaxies are shown in blue and red, respectively. The median relations from the simulation are
shown by solid curves, while the shaded regions enclose the 16th to 84th percentiles. Bins of 0.2 dex in stellar mass are used. Individual
points are shown for bins containing fewer than 10 galaxies. For reference, the dashed curves repeat the size - mass relation for active and
passive galaxies from the lowest redshift bin. The horizontal dotted line corresponds to the gravitational force softening in the simulation,
which is ﬁxed at 0.7 pkpc over this redshift range. Observational measurements presented by van der Wel et al. (2014) are shown as
squares with error bars representing the median and 1-σ scatter. Measurements from Shen et al. (2003) are shown in the 0 < z < 0.5
redshift bin, multiplied by 1.4 to account for the use of circularised radii (see text). The observed trends with stellar mass, redshift
and galaxy type are all broadly reproduced by the simulation, as well as the extent of the scatter. The median relations found in the
simulation agree with those inferred by van der Wel et al. (2014) to within 0.1 dex for active galaxies and 0.2 dex for passive galaxies.
Passive galaxies at M∗ < 109.5 M(cid:12) are larger than those observed, however this is a resolution eﬀect (see text).
In the following sections, we capitalise on the corre-
spondence between EAGLE galaxies and the observational
measurements to interpret the evolution of galaxy sizes in
physical terms.
3.2 The scatter in the z = 0 size - mass relation
The scatter in the size - mass relations is quantiﬁed Fig. 1,
with an overlap in sizes between active and passive galaxies.
The scatter in the observational and simulated data sets is
comparable. In this section, we explore potential origins of
this scatter through its correlation with other galaxy prop-
erties.
In Fig. 2 the size - mass relations at z = 0 for active
and passive galaxies are shown in the top and bottom pan-
els respectively, with contours showing the number density
of galaxies in the size – mass plane. In the top panel, the
underlying colour image shows the median SSFR of galaxies
in bins of M∗ and R50. The ﬁgure shows a clear trend: at a
ﬁxed stellar mass, smaller galaxies have lower SSFRs.
For passive galaxies, the present-day SSFR reﬂects spo-
radic low-mass accretion and no clear correlation between
the SSFR and galaxy sizes is evident (not shown). A better
measure of the past histories of passive galaxies is the time
since they assembled, tlb,assemble, deﬁned as the lookback
time at which 50% of the stellar mass of the z = 0 galaxy
has assembled into a single progenitor galaxy. The bottom
panel of Fig. 2 is coloured by the median value of tlb,assemble
in each bin. At a given stellar mass, smaller galaxies typ-

might expect these to be equivalent. This is, however, not
the case since individual galaxies evolve in mass, can switch
between active and passive states, and may merge. Note that
observational estimates of the size evolution of galaxies have
been carried out using more sophisticated techniques such
as number density matching (e.g. van Dokkum et al. 2010)
which aims to account for the evolution of galaxy masses.
However, accounting for the transition between active and
passive states is more diﬃcult.
In Fig. 3, the solid curves and shaded regions indicate
the normalisation and scatter of the size - mass relation for
three bins of stellar mass at each simulation output. Note
that the galaxies that fall in a particular bin can be dif-
ferent at each redshift due to the stellar mass evolution of
individual galaxies. Comparing the sizes of galaxies over the
redshift interval z = 2 to 0, the sizes of galaxies increase for
all stellar masses, as seen in Fig. 1. The trends are similar for
active and passive galaxy size - mass relations, but the very
small sizes of the passive galaxy median size - mass relation
at high redshifts means that the factor by which the passive
sequence increases in size is somewhat greater than for active
galaxies (as quantiﬁed in Fig. 4, dashed curves). For com-
parison, observational data from VDW14 is represented by
points with error bars; this re-emphasises the relatively good
agreement between EAGLE and observations discussed in
section 3.1.
We now compare these trends to the typical size evolu-
tion of individual galaxies. We select a sample of galaxies at
z = 0 and compare the evolution of their main progenitors’
sizes to the redshift dependence of the size - mass relation.
We select galaxies in three z = 0 stellar mass bins, and sepa-
rate the population into active and passive types on the basis
of their z = 0 SSFRs. We then trace the galaxies back in
time using the merger trees described in section 2.2, identi-
fying a galaxy’s main progenitor at each previous simulation
output. We combine the galaxies in each z = 0 sample and
over plot their median size evolution using dashed lines in
Fig. 3.
It is important to note that galaxies which are passive
at z = 0 will not necessarily be passive at higher redshifts
(and similarly for active galaxies - see section 4). In fact
we see that the sizes of the samples that are active and
passive at z = 0 become similar at higher redshift. Indeed,
the comoving number density of passive galaxies at z = 2
is less than 10% of that at z = 0 and most of the galaxies
that are passive at z = 0 were active at high redshift. As a
consequence, the sizes of the passive z = 0 progenitors lie
above the size - mass relation of high-z passive galaxies, since
passive galaxies are typically smaller than active galaxies
at a given stellar mass. The evolution of the size - mass
relation for passive galaxies is thus unlikely to reﬂect the
evolution of individual passive galaxies. A similar conclusion
was drawn by Carollo et al. (2013) based on observational
measurements.
Galaxies that are selected to lie in each of the stellar
mass bins at z = 0 will generally not be in the same mass
bin at higher redshift. For example, only 3% of present-day
1010 < M∗ < 1010.5 M(cid:12) galaxies had progenitors with stellar
masses in this range at z = 2. This results in an interesting
feature in Fig. 3 at z (cid:62) 2 for galaxies in the mass range
1010 M(cid:12) < M∗ < 1011 M(cid:12) where even active galaxies at
this redshift are smaller by ∼ 0.2 dex than the progenitors
Figure 2. The z = 0 size - mass relations for active and passive
galaxies are shown in the top and bottom panels respectively.
Black contours indicate the 1, 2 and 3 sigma levels. The galaxy
sizes and stellar masses are binned, with each point coloured by
the median SSFR for active galaxies (upper panel) or the time
since the main progenitor reached half its present-day stellar mass
for passive galaxies (lower panel). There is a clear correlation be-
tween the scatter in the size - mass relation and these properties.
ically assembled earlier. A similar trend with tlb,assemble is
seen for active galaxies (not shown).
The assembly time of a galaxy reﬂects the assembly his-
tory of the main progenitor, and accounts for growth due to
both mergers and in situ star formation. We have also exam-
ined the trends in the scatter with the time since formation,
tlb,form, deﬁned as the lookback time at which 50% of the
stellar mass in all of a galaxy’s progenitors has formed, thus
eliminating the contribution of growth through mergers. For
passive galaxies with M∗ < 1010.5 M(cid:12) similar trends are
seen for tlb,form and tlb,assemble, but at higher masses galaxy
sizes show no clear trend with tlb,form, with all massive pas-
sive galaxies, irrespective of galaxy size, forming at similar
times. For these high-mass, passive galaxies, the mergers
that the galaxy has undergone must therefore play a role
in the galaxy’s size evolution. We will further examine the
impact of mergers in section 3.4.
3.3 The size evolution of individual galaxies
In this section we contrast the evolution of the size of in-
dividual galaxies with the redshift dependence of the size
- mass relation for the ensemble population. Na¨ıvely one

Figure 3. The evolution of the size - mass relation with redshift for active and passive galaxies in 3 stellar mass bins. Active and passive
galaxies are shown in blue and red respectively. The median relations from the simulation are shown by solid curves, while the shaded
regions enclose the 16th to 84th percentiles. Individual points are shown for bins containing fewer than 10 galaxies. Dashed lines show
the median evolution of individual galaxies selected at redshift 0, the panel in which they appear is based on their z = 0 masses and the
active / passive classiﬁcation is based on their z = 0 SSFR. The evolution of individual galaxies is determined from the merger trees.
Note that at z > 0 the galaxies used to compute the dashed curves may have a stellar mass that falls outside the range indicated in
each panel and that their classiﬁcation into active / passive may not correspond to the colour of the line. The horizontal dotted line
corresponds to the gravitational force softening in the simulation. Measurements of the median and 1-σ scatter from van der Wel et al.
(2014) are shown as squares with error bars. The redshift dependence of the size - mass relation for active galaxies is similar to the size
evolution of individual active galaxies. However, this is not true for passive galaxies, owing to the evolving number density of passive
galaxies.
of galaxies that are active and have the same mass at z = 0.
The median size - mass relation for active galaxies at z = 2
has a shallow decrease in sizes with increasing stellar mass
for M∗ > 1010 M(cid:12), with a similar trend at higher redshift,
so lower-mass galaxies have larger sizes at z (cid:38) 2. As the
progenitors of the z = 0 sample typically have lower masses
than speciﬁed in each bin at z = 2, their sizes fall ∼ 0.2 dex
above the median size size - mass relation.
Not only are the sizes of the progenitors of galaxies that
are passive at z = 0 similar to their active counterparts, but
active and passive z = 0 galaxies experience broadly sim-
ilar size growth. In Fig. 4, we show the size of galaxies at
z = 0 relative to the size of their main progenitor at z = 2
(which we refer to as the size growth). The solid lines show
the median ratio of the z = 2 and 0 sizes of galaxies selected
based on their z = 0 properties, while the dashed lines show
size growth based on the size - mass relation. Note that for
the solid lines the stellar mass shown on the x-axis applies
to z = 0. For active galaxies the size growth determined
na¨ıvely from the redshift dependence of the size - mass rela-
tion is similar to that based on individual galaxy histories,
but the median size growth of individual passive galaxies is
overestimated by the size - mass relation by factors of a few.
3.4 The dependence of size growth on stellar mass
It is clear from Fig. 4 that galaxy size growth from z = 2
to z = 0 depends strongly on z = 0 stellar mass. There is
a strong trend with mass for both galaxy types, with the
growth increasing from factors of ∼ 1 – 2 for M∗ ∼ 109.5
M(cid:12) up to median factors of 3 – 4 for M∗ > 1011 M(cid:12). This
trend with z = 0 mass is signiﬁcantly more pronounced than
any relation with a galaxy’s z = 0 active or passive classiﬁ-
cation, where the size growth diﬀers only by ∼ 30%. Given
the weaker trend of the sizes with stellar mass at z ∼ 2 rel-
ative to z ∼ 0 in Fig. 1, a strong trend with stellar mass is
anticipated.
A strong connection is expected between galaxy merg-
ers and size growth (e.g. Cole et al. 2000; Naab, Khochfar
& Burkert 2006; van der Wel et al. 2009). As will be shown
by Qu & et al. (in prep.), the number of major and minor
mergers experienced by galaxies in the EAGLE simulation
is a strong function of stellar mass, consistent with ﬁndings
inferred from observations of close projected pairs. The cor-
relation with z = 0 stellar mass of both the size growth
and the number of mergers since z = 2 implies a correlation
between size growth and mergers.
To examine this correlation we consider the relation be-
tween the size growth and accreted mass fraction, where the
accreted mass fraction is the ratio of stellar mass accreted
since z = 2 to the z = 0 stellar mass. The accreted mass is
deﬁned as the contribution to the stellar mass of the galaxy
from sources other than the main progenitor at a given time,
where the stellar mass of the secondary branches is evalu-
ated when these galaxies are at a radius of ﬁve times the
half mass radius of the main branch progenitor. This def-

2 to 0 as a function of stellar mass. Solid lines show the median size
growth from z = 2 to z = 0 for individual galaxies selected based
on their z = 0 stellar mass and SSFR. Galaxies that are active
and passive at z = 0 are shown in blue and red. The size growth
of these galaxies is determined based on their main progenitors at
z = 2. Individual galaxies are shown when there are fewer than
10 galaxies per stellar mass bin. The shaded regions enclose the
16th to 84th percentiles. Dashed lines show the diﬀerence in the
medians of the size - mass relations at z = 2 and z = 0, based on
the data presented in Fig. 1. Blue and red colours show the median
ratios of the active and passive galaxies respectively. Note that for
the dashed curves, the stellar mass plotted along the x-axis applies
at both z = 2 and z = 0. The size growth of individual galaxies
depends strongly on z = 0 stellar mass but only weakly on z = 0
galaxy type. The growth determined from the redshift dependence
of the size - mass relation for passive galaxies overestimates the
median size growth of individual galaxies by factors of a few.
inition ensures that any mass lost due to stripping, before
the secondary branch coalesces with the main branch, are
accounted for in the accreted mass (Qu & et al. in prep.).
We show in Fig. 5 the residuals of the size growth -
M∗(z = 0) relation as a function of the residuals of the
accreted mass fraction - M∗(z = 0) relation. We look at
the residuals of these relations to negate the correlation of
both the size growth and accreted fraction with stellar mass.
In this way we test whether size growth and accreted mass
fraction are inherently related. Indeed, we see in Fig. 5 that
this is the case: excess size growth increases with an excess
in accreted mass fraction. This implies that mergers directly
boost size growth, beyond the stellar mass dependence of the
merger rate.
In summary, we ﬁnd that the growth in size of individ-
ual galaxies has a strong dependence on present-day stellar
mass and a much weaker dependence on present-day galaxy
classiﬁcation. The merger history of a galaxy goes some of
the way to explaining the dependence of size growth on z = 0

tion is shown by the solid curve, the 16th to 84th percentiles are

well with an excess in accreted mass.

cretion experience larger size growth.
4 SIZE EVOLUTION OF PASSIVE
HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXIES
In section 3.1, we showed that (both in observations and in
the simulation) passive galaxies at high redshift are typically
small, ∼ 1 − 2 pkpc. In the previous section, however, we
saw that the main progenitors of present-day passive galax-
ies have sizes that are similar to the progenitors of active
galaxies. This raises an obvious question: what happened to
the small passive galaxies that are seen at high redshift?
We compare the number density of passive compact
galaxies to those observed in section 4.1. We look at the
evolution of all high-z passive galaxies in section 4.2 and fo-
cus on the evolution of the compact galaxy sample in section
4.1 The number density of compact galaxies
Observational studies have detected massive compact red
galaxies at high redshifts (e.g. Cimatti et al. 2004; Daddi
et al. 2005; Trujillo et al. 2006; van Dokkum et al. 2008;
Damjanov et al. 2009). The comoving number density of
such galaxies is observed to increase from z (cid:46) 3, with ev-
idence of a turn-over at z < 1 (VDW14, Damjanov et al.

Furlong et al
et al. (2015a), they employ a compactness criterion based on
that of Barro et al. (2013) with modiﬁcation (log10(Σ1.5) >
1011, where Σ1.5 = (M∗/R1.5
50 )/(M(cid:12)/pkpc1.5)), which diﬀers
from the criteria of VDW14 applied here.
We begin our
analysis by deﬁning
pact galaxy selection as those that are passive with
(R50/pkpc)/(M∗/1011 M(cid:12))0.75 < 2.5, following VDW14.
The evolution of the number density of passive galaxies sat-
isfying the compactness criteria in the simulation is shown
in Fig. 6. Applying the same conditions as those applied to
the VDW14 sample, namely that galaxies are red/passive
and have M∗ > 1010.5 M(cid:12) (solid curve), a reasonably ﬂat
number density evolution is recovered from z = 2 to 0.5,
with a decline for z < 0.5. Relaxing the mass constraint
to include all galaxies with M∗ > 1010 M(cid:12) increases the
number density of galaxies identiﬁed but does not change
the overall evolutionary trend (dashed curve). Compared to
the observations of VDW14, also shown in Fig. 6, the num-
ber density of compact galaxies in the simulation is too low,
although there is a similar turn-over at low redshift. This
discrepancy is at least in part due to the limited box size
of the simulation. Indeed, comparing with a simulation in
a smaller box of 503 cMpc3 (with the same resolution and
subgrid physics as in Ref-L100N1504) no compact galaxies
are found with M∗ > 1010.5 M(cid:12) implying an upper limit
to the number density of 8 × 10−6 cMpc−3, which is much
lower than the O(10−5) cMpc−3 found at 0.5 (cid:38) z (cid:38) 2 for
our ﬁducial simulation. Thus, it is likely that the environ-
ments in which compact galaxies form are undersampled in
the EAGLE simulation volume. Nonetheless, we are inter-
ested in the evolution of the identiﬁed high-z passive com-
pact galaxies, even though the simulation may not account
for all possible host environments of those observed.
4.2 The destiny of high-z passive galaxies
As already noted, the typical evolution of all high-z passive
galaxies cannot be understood from the evolutionary histo-
ries of the passive z = 0 galaxy sample considered in section
3.3. However, restricting the analysis to galaxies that sat-
isfy the compact galaxy criteria excludes many of the high-z
passive galaxies due to its strong dependence on stellar mass
(see dot-dashed curve in Fig. 7). In the following analysis we
consider the evolution of all high-z passive galaxies, not only
those that are compact, but we emphasise the evolution of
the compact sub-sample.
We select all galaxies that are identiﬁed as passive in
at least one output in the redshift range 1.5 < z < 2 (cor-
responding to the bottom right panel of Fig. 1). We ensure
no galaxy is double counted if identiﬁed as passive in mul-
tiple outputs in this redshift range by ensuring we include
only the highest-redshift galaxy identiﬁed as passive on any
tree branch. We identify 331 high-z passive galaxies among
the ∼ 10, 000 galaxies with M∗ > 109 M(cid:12) in this redshift
range4. Of the 331, 44 are and remain the central galaxy of
their halo until z = 0, 83 are or become satellite galaxies

are those with R50/(M∗/1011 M(cid:12))0.75 < 2.5 pkpc, as deﬁned

pact galaxies that are passive and have M∗ > 1010.5 M(cid:12), the
red dashed curve lowers the mass limit to M∗ > 1010 M(cid:12). Error
bars on the simulation data indicate the Poisson error per redshift
bin. The observational measurements of van der Wel et al. (2014)
are shown as points with 1 − σ error bars. Many massive com-
pact galaxies are identiﬁed in the simulation, however the number
density falls below that of the observations at z (cid:62) 1, which is at
least in part due to the limited box size of the simulation.
2015)3. Several scenarios for the evolution of this population
have been proposed: Trujillo et al. (2006) suggest that the
population must grow in size by factors of 3 to 6, for exam-
ple through dry mergers, and that the descendants are today
found on the size - mass relation: van der Wel et al. (2009)
similarly suggest that growth through dry mergers, com-
bined with the continuous emergence of passive galaxies, ex-
plains the evolution of such galaxies: Poggianti et al. (2013)
suggest that at most half of the population has evolved ap-
preciably in size based on the luminosity-weighted ages of
present-day compact galaxies: Graham, Dullo & Savorgnan
(2015) conclude that the high-z compact galaxies may sim-
ply be the compact cores of local early-type disk galaxies
Recently, the theoretical study of Wellons et al. (2015a)
considered the evolution of 35 compact galaxies identiﬁed
in the ILLUSTRIS simulation, using a modiﬁed version
of the Barro et al. (2013) criterion for compactness. Their
key ﬁnding is that environment is an indicator of compact
galaxy evolution, such that galaxies in denser environments
undergo greater size evolution. Note that while our results
on compact galaxies are qualitatively comparable to Wellons
3 The existence of a turn-over depends on the deﬁnition of “com-
pact”, see Damjanov et al. (2015) for a comparison of diﬀerent
selection criteria in the literature.

though these galaxies were selected to be passive in at least

ranges from ∼ 2 to 30. Galaxies that are identiﬁed as satel-
lites at z = 2 undergo a variety of size growth scenarios;
some of these galaxies increase in size by up to a factor of
10, while others decrease in size, with a median size growth
of ∼ 1. A decrease in galaxy size can result from environ-
mental processes, such as stripping and harassment (Moore
et al. 1996), experienced by galaxies in dense environments.
The compact galaxies, which include centrals, satellites and
merged systems, all increase in size, by factors of ∼ 2 to
40, although those experiencing size growth > 20 have been
merged with a more massive system.
4.3 Growth mechanisms of compact galaxies
We extend the analysis of the compact galaxies to consider
how they grow. In Fig. 9 we show the radial proﬁle of 3 ex-
ample galaxies, chosen to illustrate diﬀerent growth mech-
anisms. The left panels show the distribution of the star
particles at z = 2, and of these same particles at z = 0. In
all cases the stars migrate radially outwards. The red and
yellow arrows compare the half-mass radii of these stars at
z = 0 and 2 respectively. The half-mass radii of the galax-
ies at z = 0 are indicated by a blue arrow. Comparing the

shift range 1.5 < z < 2 and centrals at z = 0 in the size – stellar
mass plane from the redshift where they are ﬁrst identiﬁed as
passive, zpassive, to z = 0. Points at zpassive are shown in red,
while redshift 0 points are coloured by galaxy type, where orange
indicates passive galaxies at z = 0 and green indicates active at
z = 0. A grey line connects the z = zpassive and z = 0 points for
each galaxy. Any galaxy lying to the right of the dash-dotted line
is deﬁned as compact. For the compact galaxies the evolution is
highlighted using black lines and diamond symbols. (Note that all
compact galaxies are shown, not only those that are centrals at
z = 0.) The median size - mass relations for active (blue) and pas-
sive (red) galaxies are shown at z = 0 and for the range 1 < z < 2
as solid and dashed lines respectively. The horizontal dotted line
corresponds to the simulation gravitational softening. All com-
pact galaxies increase in size by at least 0.2 dex from when they
were ﬁrst identiﬁed as passive, and similar for all centrals. None of
the high-z compact galaxies remain compact to z = 0. Although
all galaxies shown are passive in the interval 1.5 < z < 2, not all
are passive at z = 0.
by z = 0, while the remaining 204 merge with a more mas-
sive galaxy5. Focusing speciﬁcally on compact high-z pas-
sive galaxies, 26 of the 331 are compact at 1.5 < z < 2, 9
are centrals at z = 0, 7 are satellites and the remaining 14
are merged into other systems. With over 60% of all high-
z passive galaxies and ∼ 50% of compact galaxies merged
with more massive systems by z = 0, the size evolution of
their descendant is not set primarily by the properties of the
passive or compact galaxy, thus rendering these properties
largely inconsequential to the z = 0 population.
Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the high-z passive galax-
ies in the size-mass plane for the central and compact selec-
tions. All galaxies from the central high-z passive population
increase in size between z = 2 and 0, with most galaxies

considered to have merged with a more massive system.

yellow and blue arrows shows how much of the total size
growth is due to the migration of z = 2 stars relative to
other sources of size growth such as accretion or in situ star
formation. The right panel shows the radial distributions of
stars formed since z = 2, with those formed in the main
progenitor of the galaxy highlighted in green. Fig. 10 shows
images of these three galaxies at z = 0 in edge-on and face-
on projections.
The middle
The top panels show a galaxy whose size growth can
almost entirely be accounted for by the radial migration of
its z = 2 star particles. The half-mass radius of z = 2 stars
at z = 0, R50,stars(z=2)(z = 0), is approximately equal to
R50(z = 0) (yellow and blue arrows respectively). The star
particles added to the system at z < 2, shown in the right
hand panel, contribute less than 10% of the z = 0 stellar
mass and are centrally concentrated. Similar galaxies, with
R50,stars(z=2)(z = 0) (cid:62) 0.5R50(z = 0) account for 13 of the
26 compact galaxies. In 6 of these galaxies the z = 2 stars
dominate the z = 0 stellar mass, while in one further case
the z = 2 stars account for 40% of the mass. In the remaining
6 cases the compact galaxy is not the main progenitor of its
z = 0 descendant and there is signiﬁcant evidence for mixing
of the z = 2 star particles in these cases.
system where
R50,stars(z=2)(z = 0) (cid:28) R50(z = 0). The origin of the
additional growth in size of this system can be understood
from the right-hand panel.
In this galaxy many star
particles have been accreted (diﬀerence between blue and
green histograms), particularly at large radii, driving the
size growth. The accreted particles account for ∼ 40%
of M∗(z = 0), with stars formed in situ accounting for a
further ∼ 20% and z = 2 star particles (after accounting
for stellar mass loss) accounting for the remaining 40%.
The accreted stars do not dominate the stellar mass, but
their radial distribution signiﬁcantly increases the half-mass
radius.
Not all galaxies with R50,stars(z=2)(z = 0) (cid:28) R50(z = 0)
grow to their z = 0 sizes due to accretion and mergers. In
some cases star formation is a major contributor, as seen
in the bottom panels of Fig. 9. This star formation may be
triggered by mergers, but the stars were formed in situ. Note
that we cannot tell from this plot whether the stars formed
at large radii or whether they migrated outwards after their
formation. However images of this galaxy at z = 0, as seen in
the bottom panel of Fig. 10, indicate that a disk of recently
formed stars is in place in the outskirts of the galaxy.
It is evident from the simulation that the growth mech-
anisms of compact galaxies are diverse. All compact galaxies
increase in size, but some only grow through radial migra-
tion, limiting their size growth to factors of ∼ 2, while others
grow through mergers and/or renewed star formation, where
the compact galaxy progenitor can be found at the core of
the z = 0 descendant. However, over 50% of the compact
galaxies identiﬁed at z ∼ 2 have merged into more massive
systems by z = 0 and their z = 0 descendants therefore do
not obviously reﬂect the compact galaxies’ histories. While it
is tempting to conclude that the majority of compact galax-
ies merge into more massive systems by z = 0, the shortfall
in the number density of compact galaxies in the simulation
precludes such a conclusion. Likewise, the relative impor-
tance of the three growth mechanisms for compact galaxies
in the simulation may not be accurate.
In summary, 60% of the high-z passive galaxies merge
into more massive systems by z = 0, 25% survive as satellites
to z = 0 and the remaining 15% are centrals at z = 0.
Most centrals and ∼ 50% of the satellites that survive to
z = 0 increase in size with many of the centrals experiencing
renewed star formation. The compact sample of the high-
z passive galaxies undergoes size growth up to a factor of
∼ 40, growing through stellar migration (which, however,
yields only modest size growth), renewed star formation and
mergers.
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have studied the evolution of the galaxy size - mass re-
lation in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simula-
tion, distinguishing between actively star forming and pas-
sive galaxy populations. By comparing the half-mass radii
from the simulation with the sizes inferred from the obser-
vations of van der Wel et al. (2014), we ﬁnd (Figs. 1, 3)
• The dependence of the sizes of simulated galaxies on
stellar mass, redshift and star formation classiﬁcation is
close to that of observed galaxies. Galaxy sizes typically in-
crease with stellar mass and decreasing redshift, and active
galaxies are typically larger than their passive counterparts
at a given stellar mass.
• The level of agreement between the predicted and ob-
served sizes is of order 0.1 – 0.2 dex below 1011 M(cid:12) (equiv-
alent to 1-2 pkpc) for 0 (cid:54) z (cid:54) 2.
• The scatter in the sizes at a given mass is also similar
in simulated and observed galaxies.
Since the simulation agree relatively well with the ob-
servational data, we used the simulation as a tool to explore
the size evolution of galaxy populations. Our conclusions are
as follows:
• We ﬁnd that the scatter in the size - mass relation cor-
relates well with the speciﬁc star formation rate for active
galaxies and with the time since assembly for passive galax-
ies (Fig. 2). Active galaxies of a given mass with higher
speciﬁc star formation rates are typically larger. Similarly,
passive galaxies at a given stellar mass that assembled more
recently are larger than those that formed earlier.
• We compared the evolution of star forming and pas-
sive galaxies as determined from the redshift dependence of
the size - mass relation of the ensemble population (which
can be accessed directly by observations) and the typical
size evolution of individual galaxies based on their main
progenitors (which can be traced explicitly in simulations
through galaxy merger trees). For galaxies that are active
at z = 0 the evolution of the size - mass relation for the
population is similar to the typical evolution of individual
objects. However, contrary to the rapid evolution of the size
- mass relation for the population of passive galaxies, the
size evolution of individual present-day passive galaxies is
comparable to that of their star forming counterparts (Figs.
3, 4). This diﬀerence arises simply because most present-day
passive galaxies were star forming at higher redshifts.
• The relative growth of galaxy sizes from z = 2 to z =
0 increases strongly with present-day stellar mass (Fig. 4).
This dependence is partly due to the inﬂuence of galaxy
mergers on sizes: galaxies with a higher fraction of accreted

Figure 10. Images of galaxies from Fig. 9 at z = 0 in face-on
and edge-on. Top, middle and bottom rows correspond to the
galaxies shown in the top, middle and bottom rows of Fig. 9 re-
spectively. The images were produced using the radiative transfer
code skirt (Baes et al. 2011) applied to EAGLE galaxies as de-
scribed in Trayford & et al. (in prep.). Stellar light in g, r and
i band SDSS ﬁlters is shown, with dust attenuation. Images are
shown in thumbnails of 60 pkpc per side. The galaxy in the top
row increases in size due to the redistribution of its z = 2 stars,
the middle row galaxy grows by a larger factor due to accreted
stellar mass, while the bottom row galaxy experiences renewed
star formation in the outskirts of the galaxy forming at disk at
mass relative to the median at ﬁxed mass experience an
excess in size growth (Fig. 5).
• We investigated the evolution of 313 galaxies identi-
ﬁed as passive in at least one output in the redshift range
1.5 < z < 2. Of these galaxies, 65% merge into more massive
objects by z = 0, 26% are satellites and 14% are centrals at
z = 0. Satellite galaxies experience diverse size growth, with
many decreasing in both size and mass most likely due to
environmental processes such as tidal stripping. The cen-
tral galaxies all increase in size between z = 2 and 0 and
at z = 0 are found to lie near the present-day size - mass
relations for the general population. In ∼ 50% of central
galaxy cases, they experience renewed star formation, indi-
cating that instantaneous passive identiﬁcation at high-z is
not indicative of a galaxy’s future evolution.
• Of the high-z passive galaxies, 26 were identiﬁed as

star particles in the galaxy at z = 2, while the yellow histograms
show the distributions of the same star particles at z = 0. In the
right panels all other star particles in the z = 0 galaxies are shown
in blue. Those which formed in situ are shown in green. The scales
in the panels are the same, enabling a direct comparison of the
numbers of star particles of each type. The sizes of the galaxies
at z = 2 0 are shown as red and blue arrows respectively. The
yellow arrows show the half-mass radii of the z = 2 star particles
at z = 0. In all cases the z = 2 star particles have migrated to
larger radii by z = 0 resulting in galaxy size growth. Further size
growth is contributed by accreted stars in the middle panels and
by in situ formation of stars in the lower panels.

Of these galaxies, 14 merge with more massive systems, 7
are satellites and 9 are centrals at z = 0. For all compact
galaxies, the z = 2 stars migrate to larger radii by z = 0.
In 13 cases further growth occurs due to mergers and star
formation; the driver of the growth depends on the radial
distribution of stars added to the galaxy at z < 2.
We have demonstrated the success of the primary EA-
GLE simulation in producing realistic galaxy sizes across
cosmic time, while investigating the passive high-z popula-
tion further. However, we caution that we cannot rule out
that the sizes of the smallest galaxies ((cid:46) 1 pkpc) are boosted
by the polytropic equation of state that is imposed on the
unresolved interstellar medium. Higher-resolution simula-
tions that include the physics required to model the cold
interstellar gas phase are required to make further progress.

APPENDIX A: COMPARISON WITH OTHER
SIMULATIONS
In Fig. A1 the size - mass relations from the EAGLE and
ILLUSTRIS galaxy formation simulations are compared in
4 redshift bins between 0 and 2, separating each galaxy pop-
ulation into active and passive galaxies using the SSFR cut
described in section 2.4. The EAGLE simulation is as in Fig.
1. For ILLUSTRIS (Vogelsberger et al. 2014) the half-mass
radii, stellar masses and star formation rates were obtained
from their public data release (Nelson et al. 2015). An aper-
ture of twice the half-mass radius is used measure to the

stellar masses and star formation rates as was applied in
previous ILLUSTRIS publications.
For both hydrodynamical simulations, galaxy sizes tend
to increase with stellar mass and there is an oﬀset between
the sizes of active and passive galaxies in all redshift bins
shown. Interestingly, the overlap in galaxy sizes of active
and passive populations at M∗ < 109.5 M(cid:12) and M∗ > 1010.5
M(cid:12) is seen in both simulations (as discussed in section 3.1).
While the trends are similar for both models, there is a nor-
malisation oﬀset in the sizes. For M∗ < 1010 M(cid:12) the IL-
LUSTRIS galaxies are typically a factor of two (0.3 dex)
larger than EAGLE galaxies and than observed.
APPENDIX B: RESOLUTION TESTS
In Fig. B1 strong and weak convergence tests for the evo-
lution of the galaxy size - mass relation are shown. Three
simulations are presented: Ref-L100N1504, which was used
in the main sections of the paper, Ref-L025N0752, using
the same subgrid physics parameters as Ref-L100N1504 but
run in a 25 cMpc box with 8 times better mass resolution

and AGN parameters to better reproduce the local stellar
mass function. The details of the recalibration of the high-
resolution run can be found in Schaye et al. (2015).

(25 cMpc)3 simulations due to the larger box size.
In the lowest redshift bin, 0 < z < 0.5, reasonable
agreement is seen between all simulations, although the re-
calibrated model, Recal-L025N0752, exhibits a downturn at
M∗ (cid:29) 1010 M(cid:12). At z > 1 the size - mass relations at
M∗ > 1010 M(cid:12) of the 25 cMpc simulations diverge, with
the Ref-L100N1504 simulation falling in between.
In the most massive galaxies in Recal-L025N0752 the
weaker density dependence of the subgrid model for feedback
from star formation, which was introduced to better repro-
duce the galaxy stellar mass function, allows more compact
galaxies to form at high redshift relative to Ref-L100N1504.
Meanwhile, in the Ref-L025N0752 simulation massive galax-
ies are larger because the feedback is more eﬃcient in high-
density regions.
APPENDIX C: VARIATIONS IN GALAXY SIZE
DEFINITION
We look at the variations in galaxy sizes due to the 3-D
spherical aperture within which the total galaxy mass is
measured and the eﬀects of projection. In Fig. C1 the varia-
tion of the median galaxy size - mass relations recovered by
applying diﬀerent size deﬁnitions are compared at z = 0, 1
and 2. The half-mass radius computed based on the total
stellar mass and the mass within 3-D 100 pkpc and 30 pkpc
apertures yield similar galaxy sizes for stellar masses below
1010.5 M(cid:12) (as is the case for the mass, see Schaye et al. 2015),
but larger apertures result in larger sizes above this mass.
In this paper the size is deﬁned as the half-mass radius com-
puted based on the mass within 100 pkpc apertures. This
aperture very closely replicates the half-mass radius deter-
mined by including all particles associated with a subhalo
for galaxies with M∗ < 1011 M(cid:12). However, it excludes stars
far out in the most massive halos in the simulation, which
would be diﬃcult to observe (and are labelled intra-cluster
light).
As well as comparing the eﬀect of diﬀerent apertures,
we compute projected radii and compute the half-mass ra-
dius based on S´ersic ﬁts to the mass proﬁle. These variations
result in systematic oﬀsets in the size - mass relation rela-
tive to the 3-D half-mass radius measurement. Due to the
systematic nature of these oﬀsets, we present only the 3-
D half-mass radius measurement throughout, as variations
in the deﬁnition do not impact the trends in galaxy sizes
from the simulations. We note, however, that the deﬁnition
of galaxy may result in a systematic decrease of up to 0.2
dex. A similar systematic oﬀset has been found when com-
puting observed radii using circularised and non-circularised
methods (Dutton et al. 2011).
APPENDIX D: DEFINITION OF PASSIVE
GALAXIES
In this appendix we discuss the impact of the deﬁnition of ac-
tive and passive galaxies on the resulting diﬀerence in sizes
reported between these two galaxy types (Fig. 1). As dis-
cussed in section 2.4, the active / passive deﬁnition is based
on the SSFR of a galaxy. In observations, however, where
star formation rates must be inferred, the deﬁnition of active
and passive galaxies often depends on the observed colours
of galaxies (e.g. van der Wel et al. 2014). To determine if
any signiﬁcant diﬀerence arises by applying a colour cut, as
opposed to a SSFR cut, at z = 0, 1 and 2 we produce UVJ
colours for all simulated galaxies with M∗ > 109 M(cid:12) and
compare the median size - mass relations.
Galaxy colours from the simulation are produced using
the stellar population synthesis models of Bruzual & Charlot
(2003) and applying the dust model of Charlot & Fall (2000).
A full description of the method can be found in Trayford
et al. (2015). We apply two colour cuts to the UVJ plane,
that of VDW14 and of Muzzin et al. (2013). We include the
colour cut of Muzzin et al because at low redshift, where the
VDW14 sample is small (as commented on in section 3.1),
the VDW14 cut applied intersects the active or blue galaxy
locus, resulting in an inappropriate division into active and
passive galaxies6.
In Fig. D1 the median size - mass relations for simulated
galaxies at z = 0, 1 and 2 are shown for all 3 deﬁnitions of
active and passive galaxies: SSFR, UVJ applying the cut of
VDW14 and UVJ with the cut of Muzzin et al. The median
sizes of active galaxies are similar at all redshifts shown,
irrespective of the details of the classiﬁcation. For passive
galaxies there is always a clear oﬀset from the sizes of active
6 Note that Trayford et al. (2015) showed that at z = 0.1 the
galaxy colours produced by EAGLE are in good agreement with
observations, so for a larger observational sample a similar issue
may arise when applying the UVJ cut of VDW14.

Figure C1. The median size - mass relation for galaxy sizes computed within diﬀerent apertures and applying diﬀerent measurement
techniques at z = 0, 1 and 2. Solid curves show the 3-D half-mass radius and dot-dashed curves show the projected half-mass radius
based on a S´ersic ﬁt to the mass proﬁle. Green curves shows the radius based on all star particles bound to the subhalo, while red and
blue curves only consider stars within 3-D 100 pkpc and 30 pkpc apertures respectively. The solid red curves corresponds to the sizes
used in this work, while the blue dot-dashed curves indicate the sizes used by Schaye et al. (2015). The horizontal dotted line shows the
gravitational force softening length in the simulation. The aperture measurements aﬀect the galaxy sizes at stellar masses > 1010.5 M(cid:12),
with galaxy size increasing with increasing aperture. The diﬀerent size measurement techniques produce similar trends with stellar mass,
but there is a small systematic oﬀset in size. Note that we deﬁne the size as the 3-D half-mass radius in a 100 pkpc aperture.
galaxies, but the median sizes of the passive galaxies show
some variation between the cuts. This is due to the diﬀerent
number of galaxies selected depending on the speciﬁcs of
the cut. Note that at z = 2 the sample of passive galaxies
selected from the simulation is small, as, for all cuts, the
galaxies are predominantly active. This causes some noise
in the size - mass relation at this redshift.
Note that the impact of the deﬁnition of passive galaxies
on the passive fraction is explored in more detail in Trayford
& et al. (in prep.).
In summary, how galaxies are classiﬁed results in neg-
ligible diﬀerence in the sizes of active galaxies, while the
same is true for low-redshift passive galaxies. For all cuts
the active / passive galaxy size oﬀset is maintained.

Figure D1. The median size - mass relation for diﬀerent deﬁnitions of galaxy size at redshifts 0, 1 and 2 using 3 separations of active and
passive galaxies. The dotted line corresponds to the gravitational softening of the simulation. At redshift 0 there is good correspondence
between the diﬀerent deﬁnitions. At redshifts 1 and 2, diﬀerences appear for the passive galaxies, due to the diﬀerent numbers of galaxies
identiﬁed by each method, however, the oﬀset in size between active and passive galaxies is evident for all three deﬁnitions. Note that
the noise in the z = 2 passive galaxy sample is due to the small number of passive galaxies in the simulation at such a high redshift.
