ABSTRACT
I review the theory of hierarchical clustering starting with an historical overview and
moving on to a discussion of those aspects of dissipationless clustering under gravity which
are most relevant to galaxy formation I conclude with some comments on the additional
problems which arise when including all the other physics needed to build a realistic picture
for the origin and evolution of the galaxy population
1 An historical introduction
The idea that structure in the Universe might build up through hierarchical clustering
became popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s primarily as a result of the work of
Jim Peebles and his collaborators These developments and indeed much of the material
in this introduction are reviewed from a somewhat dierent perspective in Peebless own
textbooks 1980 1993 and in the recent text by Padmanhaban 1993 Soon after the
discovery of the microwave background had ensured the position of the Hot Big Bang as the
dominant cosmological model Peebles and Dicke realised that when the primordial plasma
became neutral at a redshift of 1000 its Jeans mass would drop from very large values to
about 106M This led them to suggest that a large population of globular cluster-like
objects might collapse immediately after recombination and that larger systems might
form subsequently by aggregation of these rst objects Although this specic hypothesis
immediately encountered a number of diculties the picture that small things should
collapse rst and then merge together to make larger objects remained as what became
known as the isothermal theory of structure formation
The name isothermal originates from a classication of perturbations in a radiation-
dominated universe By the late 60s it was known that there are two independent per-
tubation modes of the coupled radiation-gas mixture for which the density contrast of
the matter uctuations is a non-decreasing function of time For the isothermal mode
the radiation temperature is almost uniform at early times but the photon-to-baryon ra-
tio varies from place to place Such uctuations survive with little damping until matter
and radiation decouple at which time overdense regions with mass exceeding the matter
Jeans mass are able to collapse Since there was no known physical mechanism to generate
such uctuations it was unclear what assumption to make about their relative amplitudes
on dierent scales The lack of an obvious characteristic mass in the range of interest
106  MM  1017 suggested a power-law uctuation spectrum but what power-law
index is appropriate During the 1970s most work adopted a white-noise spectrum corre-
sponding perhaps to a Poisson distribution of the rst collapsed objects While everyone
realised that this was an assumption of convenience and one that was often challenged
it nevertheless shaped the prevailing picture of generic hierarchical clustering
The second important perturbation mode known as the adiabatic mode has uniform
photon-to-baryon ratio but spatially varying temperature density and curvature This
is often considered to be the naturally dominant mode since it grows faster than the
isothermal mode Thus if both modes were stimulated with comparable amplitude in the
early universe the adiabatic mode would dominate at late times In the period leading
up to recombination adiabatic uctuations are damped strongly by photon diusion on all
scales smaller than the Silk mass  14 10150h214M for the baryon density inferred
from cosmic nucleosynthesis If such modes are dominant the rst structures to collapse
have masses much larger than those of galaxies This adiabatic picture for structure
formation was championed by Zeldovich and his school who pointed out that the initial
collapse would generically be one-dimensional and would therefore give rise to coherent
sheet-like structures which they termed pancakes Galaxies would have to form by the
fragmentation of these pancakes
These two competing pictures set up two views of structure formation which are still
with us today despite the fact that the specic models on which they were based are no
longer considered viable In the isothermal world-view objects of galaxy scale form by ag-
gregation and merging while large-scale structures are essentially random and have little
inuence on galaxy properties In the adiabatic world-view large-scale structure displays
considerable coherence and its collapse dynamics determine where and how galaxies form
Few people would still argue that galaxies form by the fragmentation of bigger objects
because they appear older than the observed large-scale structure These dierent points
of view were reinforced by the use of dierent mathematical tools Peebles and his collab-
orators took their techniques from statistical physics  correlation functions the BBGKY
hierarchy etc  while Zeldovich and his group applied results from the theory of Hamilto-
nian ows  singularity classication topology of structure and so on The rst approach
clearly emphasises stochastic properties while the second emphasises large-scale coherence
Good techniques for simulating and visualising either hierarchical clustering or coherent
collapse from a random eld became available only in the mid 1980s It is interesting
that even today the language used to analyse and interpret such simulations can often be
traced back to one or other of the original schools
By the time that large numerical simulations became possible the most popular cos-
mogonies assumed the dominant dark matter component to be some kind of free elementary
particle The successor of the adiabatic picture was the neutrino-dominated or HDM Hot
Dark Matter model Simulations of HDM showed that evolution from a gaussian random
eld with a well-dened coherence length proceeds quite rapidly from a state where very
little matter is in any nonlinear object to one where more than 25 of all matter is in
collapsed and virialised clusters with mass comparable to the coherence scale White et
al 1983 In the intermediate regime a connected structure built of highly asymmetric
elements does indeed form but the dominant visual impression is of a network of laments
rather than of a cellular foam made up of sheets The successor of the isothermal picture
was the CDM model It has the important feature that its power spectrum is signicantly
redder than white noise ie the power density at high spatial frequencies corresponding
to galaxies is well below that on the scale of galaxy clusters As a result collapse on galaxy
scales occurs more recently in the CDM universe than envisioned by the older model In
addition there is a surprising coherence of structure on scales larger than galaxies White
et al 1987 This coherence again an apparent network of laments is even stronger in
recent galaxy surveys and in variants of CDM which attempt to t these surveys and to
accommodate the uctuations measured by COBE
These numerical developments have made the HDM incarnation of the adiabatic pic-
ture seem unattractive while at the same time showing that CDM cosmogonies are much
less clearly hierarchical than the old isothermal picture and can protably be analysed
using the language of coherent large-scale ows These issues are mainly relevant to the
topic of this paper because they mean that the formation of galaxies cannot easily be
separated from that of larger and smaller objects in CDM-like models Thus protogalactic
collapse is neither the falling together of a single smooth perturbation nor the merging of a
set of well-equilibrated precursor objects but lies somewhere between the two Similarly
while galaxies generally form before the larger structures in which they are embedded
the temporal separation of the two processes is not enough for them to be independent
As a result substantial biases can arise in the galaxy population ie the properties of
galaxies can end up depending strongly on their large-scale environment I come back to
both these issues in later sections
N-body simulations have also claried another important question about hierarchical
clustering Measurements of the two-point correlation function for galaxies show a well
dened power-law continuing down to scales of a few tens of kpc where the distribution
is highly nonlinear Furthermore three-point and higher order correlations are related
to the two-point function in a simple way which appears almost independent of scale
Impressed by his discovery of these facts in the 1970s Jim Peebles suggested that the
galaxy distribution and the underlying mass distribution might form some kind of scale-
invariant or fractal-like hierarchy and that the continuation of power-law behaviour to
very small scales might reect the dynamical stability of this arrangement eg Peebles
1978 In contrast Martin Rees and I argued that a virialised clump of non-dissipative
dark matter would not maintain a hierarchical structure but would evolve into a monolithic
dark halo with a well-dened centre and a smooth density prole White  Rees 1978
We inferred from this that galaxy clusters must contain many galaxies rather than a
single supergalaxy because dissipative processes concentrated the galaxies suciently
during formation for them to be able to avoid overmerging This issue has remained
controversial but most numerical studies now agree that objects formed by hierarchical
clustering of dissipationless matter from gaussian initial conditions do not retain much
signicant substructure I will return to these matters later
The question of overmerging brings us to a critical point While merging of dark halos
may occur rapidly during hierarchical clustering it is much less clear whether merging
is an important process in the formation and evolution of individual galaxies Toomre
has argued forcefully that elliptical galaxies form by the merger of disk systems Toomre
1977 His idea has gained strong support from two directions Simulations by Barnes
Hernquist and others have shown that the process does indeed produce objects with the
right kind of structure while observers have found real systems in which this transformation
is currently occurring and have shown the internal structure of normal ellipticals to
possess much of the diversity expected in merger products Barnes 1995 Another line of
argument due principally to Ostriker and his colleagues notes that the giant cD galaxies
seen at the centres of many rich clusters may result from galaxy merging during the
formation and evolution of the cluster eg Hausman  Ostriker1978 While the direct
observational evidence for this process is not fully convincing it seems a natural extension
of Toomres idea since in most of their properties cD galaxies form a smooth continuation
of the sequence of ordinary bright ellipticals The main remaining questions are whether a
merger origin can be consistent with the systematic regularities of the elliptical population
the fundamental plane and if so then exactly what kind of objects merged
at which epoch It seems unlikely that present ellipticals could have arisen through the
merging of randomly chosen objects from the present disk galaxy population although
even this issue remains controversial
In contrast it is generally agreed that the stellar disks seen in spiral galaxies could not
have formed through the aggregation of pre-existing stellar systems Rather the material
of the disks must have settled into its present thin and rotationally supported conguration
while still gaseous and hence dissipative and must have remained relatively undisturbed
since the bulk of it turned into stars Toth  Ostriker 1992 noticed that this requirement
places limits on the rate at which even quite small galaxies are merging with present-day
spirals They concluded that an open universe is required for the current accretion rate to
be suciently small Their argument is clearly important enough to merit further detailed
investigation
If spiral disks cannot be made by mergers then the same might seem to
be true for the bulges at their centres despite the many similarities between bulges and
ellipticals This conclusion need not apply if mergers were to produce bulges suciently
early that the disk could be accreted later I will argue below that this sequence is indeed
viable in hierarchical clustering even for a high density universe Note however that
the gas which settles into the disk could not have been coextensive with the stars in the
premerger systems since it would then produce a disk which is smaller and more strongly
bound than the bulge rather than the opposite which we observe
The above paragraphs cover only rather general points about how hierarchical cluster-
ing may aect galaxy formation However within specic models for hierarchical clustering
it is possible to predict how when and where galaxies form what they merge with how
their various components are dierentiated and what sets the relationships between the
distributions of galaxies and of mass and between galaxy properties such as morphology
and luminosity and the larger scale environment In the remainder of this paper I will
explore the simplest such clustering model which is based on dissipationless gravitational
collapse from an initially gaussian distribution of density perturbations As a result of
intensive analytic and numerical study this model is now quite well understood
argue that when implemented in the context of a CDM-like cosmogony it can reproduce
most of the qualitative and many of the quantitative properties of the observed galaxy
population In addition it provides a phenomenology which is very helpful when interpret-
ing the data now becoming available for high redshift galaxies and it suggests how such
observations may be used both to test the hierarchical clustering paradigm and to estimate
the parameters of the specic cosmogony in which it is implemented
In section 2 I discuss purely dissipationless hierarchical clustering I point out a number
of regularities of the gaussian case and of the Press  Schechter model for its evolution I set
out what I now believe to be well established and what I consider still uncertain I discuss
some new work on the expected structure of dark halos and I note the points of contact
which can already be made with observation In section 3 I consider the new issues that
can be addressed by studying what happens to a dissipative gas component which clusters
with the dark matter Interesting points arise concerning the angular momentum of galaxy
disks and the relative amounts of gas stars and dark matter seen in galaxy clusters Finally
in section 4 I sketch the results obtained so far by combining these techniques with simple
phenomenological models for the formation and evolution of the stars in galaxies Most of
the material in these sections is presented in fuller form in my lecture notes for the 1993
Les Houches summer school White 1996
2 Dissipationless clustering
21 Gaussian or not The basic requirements for hierarchical clustering are that the
growth of structure should be driven by gravity and that small things should collapse
rst In this paper I will consider models in which the dominant mass component clusters
dissipationlessly under gravity Thus the dark matter must either be some kind of free
elementary particle or a population of black holes stellar remnants or jupiters which
formed well before the collapse of objects of galactic scale It may be that some fraction
of the dark matter formed at relatively late times through cooling ows or other means
Provided this fraction is not too large such a complication would not greatly aect my
arguments Small objects will form rst provided the rms uctuation of the initial density
within a smoothing lter enclosing mass M is a decreasing function of M  Equivalently
k3P k must be an increasing function of spatial wavenumber k where P k is the power
density in a fourier decomposition of the initial density eld
The initial eld will be gaussian if and only if the phases of its dierent fourier modes
are uniformly and independently distributed There are certainly plausible hierarchical
clustering models for which this condition is not satised Examples of particular interest
arise in theories where density uctuations are generated by cosmic strings or textures At
present it is still unclear how strongly the behaviour of such models will deviate from that
of a gaussian model with similar P k To the extent that the eective density uctuation
at a point results from superposing the inuence of many strings or textures it seems
possible that the Central Limit Theorem may lead to approximately gaussian behaviour
From now on I will restrict myself entirely to gaussian models for which P k gives a
complete description of the statistical properties of the initial conditions and hence of the
subsequent growth of structure both linear and nonlinear
22 How should we describe hierarchical clustering The easiest way is to begin with the
simplest possible case and then to extend it to cover more realistic possibilities Consider
a universe containing only collisionless matter Assume that at some very early initial
time the density eld was gaussian with a power-law uctuation spectrum P k  kn and
particle motions were negligible At some much later time after the universe has expanded
by a factor a the amplitude of those uctuations which are still linear will have increased
by a factor ba where ba  a for the simplest case of an Einstein-de Sitter universe
We can therefore dene a characteristic wavenumber ka which separates linear from
nonlinear scales by setting ba2k3
P k  1 This in turn denes a characteristic mass
M for nonlinear objects where Ma  ba63n
In the Einstein-de Sitter case the universe itself expands as a power law a  t23 and
so denes no characteristic time length or mass For power law initial uctuations it then
seems natural to assume that the growth of structure will be self-similar at late times
This implies that all the statistical properties of the structure are independent of time
once masses are expressed in units of Ma lengths in units of aka and time in units
of the age of the universe It is important to note that self-similarity is an assumption
and has not been proven In fact there is some dispute over the values of n for which
self-similar evolution is possible Hierarchical clustering requires n  3 while n  4
is required for any physically plausible uctuation distribution However the full range
3  n  4 may not give rise to self-similar evolution For n  1 the binding energy of M
objects is dominated by the internal binding energy of the smaller objects from which they
form and so cannot scale in the expected way with a In this case self-similar evolution
is possible only if nonlinear objects do not relax to form monolithic halos but instead
maintain a hierarchical structure down to arbitrarily small scales The limited simulation
data available do not support this behaviour For n  1 the linear contribution of
large-scale perturbations to the rms bulk motion of objects is divergent and P k must be
cut o below some suitably small kc in order to get a viable model It seems unlikely that
this will aect the way nonlinear structures build up while k  kc and so I would claim
self-similar clustering to be a plausible hypothesis for 3  n  1
The range of n which seems likely to be relevant for the formation of nonlinear objects
in the real universe is 3  n  0 and so lies within the regime where self-similar clus-
tering may be a good approximation There have now been quite extensive N-body tests
of scaling behaviour for 2  n  0 and by and large self-similarity has been veried for
the statistics analysed so far Efstathiou et al 1988 Lacey  Cole 1994 The simulations
become progressively more challenging as n becomes more negative and the results for
n  2 are signicantly less convincing than those for larger n Analysis of these data show
that most dark halos can be well represented as monolithic systems with little substruc-
ture Signicant exceptions are almost always systems in the process of merging or small
objects which have fallen relatively recently into a much more massive halo Thus a good
rst description of self-similar clustering is in terms of an abundance AMMdMM 2
of nonlinear dark halos a model for the internal structure of these halos and a rate
RM1M M2MdM1dM2daaM 4
 for mergers between halos The abundance and rate
functions A and R give us statistical information about the formation epochs lifetimes
and evolution paths of dark halos and surprisingly successful models for them are obtained
from extensions of the Press  Schechter argument In contrast the internal structure of
individual halos can only be studied eectively through direct simulation I review these
two approaches in the next few sections Note that the extension from the self-similar case
to more realistic initial conditions turns out to be straightforward
23 The PS model for clustering statistics The original derivation of a mass function for
collapsed halos by Press  Schechter 1974 was far from convincing but several recent
developments have given it a new lease of life The rst was the demonstration that an
independent argument based on excursion set theory leads to an identical formula Bond
et al 1991 The second was the realisation that extensions of the argument allow the
construction of a much more complete but still relatively simple theory for hierarchical
clustering Bower 1991 Bond et al 1991 Lacey  Cole 1993 Finally detailed comparisons
with N-body simulations showed that the statistical predictions of the theory for mass
functions formation times merger rates etc are in good although clearly not perfect
agreement with experiment Lacey  Cole 1994 A less comforting discovery is the fact
that the theory works very poorly when its predictions are compared with simulation data
on a halo by halo basis ie that the mass of the halo to which a given particle is predicted
to belong by its excursion set trajectory is almost unrelated to the mass of the halo to
which it actually belongs White 1996
The PS formula for the probability that at time t a random mass element is part of
a halo with mass in the range M dM  is
f M tdM 
M
d ln 2
expcid182M
22M  cid19 dM
where 2M  is the initial linear variance on scale M and Mt is the characteristic
nonlinear mass at time t dened by btM  c  1686 In the excursion set derivation
2M  is calculated as the total power in fourier modes with wavenumber k  kcM  
62a3M 13 Similarly if we consider a halo which has mass M2 at time t2 then
according to the extended theory the fraction of its material which was in halos of mass
in the range M1 M1  dM1 at the earlier time t1 hence t1  t2 and M1  M2 was

with   Mt1  Mt2 and 2  2M1  2M2 As Lacey Cole
Bower Kaumann and others have shown these two formulae can be combined and used
to derive merger rates distributions of formation and survival times and merger histories
which agree well with those derived directly from numerical experiment The point I want
to emphasise here concerns the structure of these equations rather than their precise form
The initial uctuation spectrum enters only through its variance 2M  PkkcM  P k
and time enters only through the variance associated with the characteristic mass Mt
and so through the linear theory growth factor bt which is used to dene M When
expressed in terms of these natural mass and time variables the structure of hierar-
chical clustering is independent of the specic cosmology under consideration at least in
the PS model This is a tremendous simplication
Another important simplication is the following Let us consider a mass element
which is part of a halo of mass M2 at time t2 and part of a halo of mass M1 at time t1  t2
We can ask for the probability that this element is part of a halo of mass M0  M1 at the
yet earlier time t0 In principle we might expect this probability to depend on M2 and t2 as
well as on M1 and t1 but the excursion set derivation of the PS theory shows that this is
not the case The probability is just f M0 M1 t0 t1dM0 as given by changing subscripts
in the above formula Thus the formation histories of the halos present at time t1 do not
depend on whether those halos are later incorporated into a more massive system This
shows that one must be careful when discussing how hierarchical clustering can introduce
bias into the galaxy distribution According to PS theory a 1012M halo at z  1
does not know whether it will be incorporated into a rich cluster or remain in a void at
z  0 As a result the galaxy population contained in protocluster halos must be the same
as that contained in protovoid halos of the same mass Any bias in galaxy population must
arise either from the fact that the distribution of halo masses is dierent in protocluster
and protovoid regions or from the fact that the galaxies evolve in dierent environments
between z  1 and the present Both can plausibly lead to large systematic eects It
is unclear to me whether this particular aspect of PS theory is realistic since halos in
N-body simulations clearly do know about their environment at least to the extent that
they often align with large-scale laments
An important property of hierarchical clustering which was rst thoroughly explored
by Lacey  Cole 1993 concerns the distribution of formation times of halos They dene
the formation time of a halo to be the rst time at which its largest progenitor contains
more than half the nal mass and they show that the distribution of such formation times
depends weakly on the shape of the initial uctuation spectrum but strongly on halo mass
They nd the typical formation time tf M t for a halo of mass M identied at time t to
be given by
btbtf   1  M Mt
For the particular case of scale-free clustering in an Einstein-de Sitter universe they nd
the median redshift of formation for halos of current mass M to be
zf M   2n33  112MMt0n36
Fitting the abundance of rich clusters in the present universe to this kind of hierarchical
model implies that Mt0  2  101307
h1M so that clusters themselves are 20M
events for 0  1 but only 6M events for 0  02 Thus clusters are predicted to form
very recently in an Einstein-de sitter universe but less recently in a low density universe
the eect comes partly from the reduction in MM and partly from the dierence in the
behaviour of bt A recent formation epoch seems to accord well with the large fraction
of real clusters which are observed to have signicant substructure and to be far from
equilibrium so this argument has been used to infer relatively large values of 0 Exactly
how large a value is required is still a matter of debate In contrast the halos of isolated
galaxies have masses well below M implying typical formation redshifts above unity for
any 0 They are thus predicted to be well relaxed systems with a much lower incidence
of substructure Their last major merging events are expected to be comfortably far in the
past in most cases
24 The faint galaxy problem For scale-free initial conditions the PS formula for the
abundance of dark halos becomes

Thus a power-law N  M n96 is truncated exponentially above the characteristic mass
Mt Recalling that the appropriate value for n is probably in the range n  1 it is
clear that the PS model predicts that hierarchical clustering should give a very large
number of low mass halos in the present universe For example adopting n  1 and

the value of Mt0 quoted above the predicted abundance of halos with masses in the
0 h3 per cubic Mpc and an even larger number
range 1010  hMM  1011 is  09123
is predicted for more negative n For comparison integrating the luminosity function of
Loveday and collaborators all the way down to 0001L this is well below the eective limit
of their observations gives a total of only 009h3 galaxies per cubic Mpc This is a serious
discrepancy particularly since many of the observed faint galaxies are actually satellites of
brighter systems or members of galaxy groups and so are contained in halos with masses
well above 1011M Thus it seems that if 0  1 more than 90 of all halos in the mass
range 1010  hMM  1011 must contain no galaxies of the kind represented in the
catalogues used to compile luminosity functions Within hierarchical models it is certainly
a challenge to understand why this might be the case The discrepancy is eliminated if we
are willing to accept 0  01
One resolution of this problem might be that the PS theory incorrectly predicts the
low mass end of the halo abundance distribution There are a number of papers in the
literature which discuss this possibility but they come to no clear consensus
I believe
that this is unlikely to be the answer since high resolution N-body simulations have now
been able to check the PS abundance against scale-free models with 0  n  2 and
over the mass range 001  MM  50 The comparison is not straightforward since
the N-body mass functions depend on how halos are identied and the PS functions
depend on exactly how M and 2M  are dened Nevertheless the shape of the low
mass tail is quite well t in all cases and if anything the simulations seem to show
slightly more mass in low mass halos than is predicted by the theory As n becomes more
negative halos become less well separated from their environment and for n  2 many
halos are poorly approximated as ellipsoidal equilibrium systems This may be signalling
a breakdown of the clustering hierarchy as n approaches 3 and so might invalidate the
PS abundance predictions Unfortunately this does not appear to solve the problem
for models like CDM From a high resolution simulation of standard CDM normalised to
produce the correct rich cluster abundance I estimate 16h3 halos per cubic Mpc in the
above mass range well above the observed galaxy abundance A breakdown must occur
in models where k3P k reaches a maximum at some nite k and thereafter decreases
Such models are no longer hierarchical they have a well dened initial coherence scale
and they do not form a signicant number of objects below the corresponding mass An
example is the old Warm Dark Matter model although I doubt that this particular model
is viable
The rst simulations of the formation of dark halos in a
25 Density structure of halos
CDM universe showed that they were predicted to be monolithic ellipsoidal systems with
a density structure that could be roughly approximated as isothermal ie M r  r
Frenk et al 1988 Axis ratios spanned the range between nearly prolate and nearly
oblate and values exceeding 2  1 were quite common More recent work with much better
resolution has conrmed these conclusions and shown that halo shapes remain far from
spherical even in their inner regions This suggest some possible tests of the theory In disk
galaxies deviations of the potential from axisymmetry can be measured from the dynamics
of polar rings or from the photometric axis ratio of face-on systems Results from the
former test have been mixed but the latter one suggests that galaxy potentials are much
more nearly axisymetric than is predicted Rix  Zaritsky 1995 This test is not denitive
since there is a substantial contribution to the potential from the observed stars and gas
and the accumulation of the galaxy could thus plausibly have modied the inner structure
of its halo A similar test can be made using the X-ray emission from galaxy clusters
This traces the potential at radii where the baryonic contribution is thought to be small
Recent results show an ellipticity distribution which is quite consistent with that expected
for cluster mass dark halos but the interpretation is complicated by the abundant evidence
for nonequilibrium structure in both real and simulated clusters Buote  Canizares 1996
Even in lower mass halos where nonequilibrium eects are less important high reso-
lution simulations have shown that the isothermal density model is a serious oversimpli-
cation In the rst place it is usually possible to nd a few small subclumps which have re-
cently been accreted and have not yet been disrupted by the main halo More importantly
the density proles never have a constant logarithmic slope Rather   d ln d ln r in-
creases steadily with radius over the resolved region in almost all cases In simulations
carried out to date there is no convincing evidence that  is ever drops signicantly below
unity in the inner regions If a constant density core does form it has yet to be resolved
This has interesting consequences both for the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies and for
the inner regions of galaxy clusters
Ongoing work by a collaboration led by Julio Navarro is looking systematically at the
density proles of dark halos in scale-free and CDM universes with a variety of 0 values
The resolution limit of our simulations is in all cases about 1 of the outer radius of a
halo which we dene as r200 the radius at which the enclosed overdensity drops to 200
Over this radial range and for halos spanning about four orders of magnitude in mass we
nd that the radial density proles can be t quite well by the simple formula
r1  rrs2 
This model gives a density prole which bends gradually from   1 at small radii to
  3 at large radii Less than 1 of the halo mass lies in the unresolved central regions
Notice that because of the denition of r200 the parameters c  r200rs the concentra-
tion parameter and c the characteristic density in units of the critical density are not
independent this model is a one parameter tting formula for halos of given mass For
all power spectra we nd that c decreases and hence c decreases with increasing halo
mass For a CDM universe this decrease is from c  20 at MM  001 to c  5 at
MM  100 The increase is stronger for initial power spectra with more positive n The
scatter about the relation is about 01 in log c It is interesting that these trends can be
interpreted purely as a reection of diering formation epoch We nd that for a suitable
denition of formation redshift zf the relation c  100001  zf 3 is a good description
of our numerical data for all power spectra and for all 0 values we have tried so far
These results have a number of interesting implications Navarro et al 1996 For a
CDM universe the inner regions of rich clusters are suciently concentrated to account for
the observed giant arcs without violating constraints placed by the observed distribution of
X-ray gas On the other hand the centres of dwarf galaxy halos are too concentrated to be
consistent with the solid-body rotation curves observed for a number of faint dark matter-
dominated systems Something in the history of these systems must have altered the inner
structure of their halos if they are to be consistent with the model A general result is that
the density proles of galaxy halos are not predicted to be scaled down versions of those
of cluster halos Instead the halos of galaxies should be substantially more concentrated
This concentration is presumably enhanced by the accumulation of the galaxy itself For
bright galaxies like our own the maximum of the circular velocity curve of the bare halo
is predicted to lie well outside the current optical radius of the galaxy so that a rising
rotation curve would be predicted if the visible material were gravitationally insignicant
One result which has remained quite stable since the earliest
26 Rotation of halos
simulations of hierarchical clustering concerns the distribution of the spin of dark halos as
measured by the parameter   JE12GM 52 where J E and M are the magnitudes of
halo angular momentum binding energy and mass respectively The distribution of  is
found to be almost independent of M  of P k and of 0 It depends weakly on the way
in which halos are identied in the simulations The median value is m  005 but the
scatter is large with values ranging all the way from  001 to  01 eg Cole  Lacey
1996 The main factor determining the value of  appears to be the morphology of halo
formation halos which form by mergers of similar sized clumps tend to have relatively
large angular momenta The value of  also correlates weakly with central concentration
in the sense that halos with large  tend to have small c values for their mass
A parameter which is easier to interpret in terms of galaxy properties than the tra-

0 For scale-free initial conditions with n  1 I nd median s of 0003 for 0  1 and
0002 for 0  01 again the scatter spans more than an order of magnitude and halos
with larger  tend to be less concentrated An exponential disk with scale length rd and
constant rotation velocity Vd has specic angular momentum 2rdVd If we equate this to
the specic angular momentum of the halo JM then we nd H0rd  V 2
c 2Vd Thus
if Vc  Vd we nd that a galaxy with Vd  220 kms for example could contain a disk
with rd of 2 or 3 h1kpc This is indeed close to the observed scale lengths of real disk
galaxies with this rotation velocity Note however that there is little room for signicant
transfer of angular momentum from disk material to the halo during disk formation and
that disks formed at high redshift would have to be signicantly smaller by a factor of
1  z15 for 0  1 Thus there is only marginally enough angular momentum available
in hierarchical clustering to form disks as large as those observed today and it is dicult
to argue that damped Ly systems at redshifts of 2 or 3 are collapsed disks which are
systematically larger than those seen nearby I will return to this problem later
3 Including gas
If we extend the above modelling to include a gas component in addition to the
dark matter then processes other than gravity can aect the gas and new eects become
important The simplest case is that of a nonradiative gas without heating other than
shock heating cooling or star formation Such a gas is often referred to as adiabatic
even though it is repeatedly shocked Numerical experiments with a small gas fraction
which is initially cold and distributed like the dark matter show that by and large the
gas density still parallels that of the dark matter at late times This is not exactly true
however because shocks cause the gas to move dierently from the dark matter during
the collapse and merging of nonlinear objects This separation usually results in a transfer
of energy and angular momentum from the dark matter to the gas so that the gas ends
up slightly less concentrated than the dark matter Navarro  White 1993 For scale-
free initial conditions and 0  1 we would expect self-similar behaviour The numerical
experiments needed to check this have not yet been carried out but it seems that they
will lead to halos in which the gas fraction declines steadily at smaller radii and higher
densities
31 The overcooling problem If radiative cooling is allowed then the gas and dark matter
distributions diverge much more drastically The typical density of nonlinear objects scales
with redshift as 1  z3 and so their gas cooling time approximately as 1  z3 pro-
vided their virial temperature exceeds 104K On the other hand dynamical times scale
as 1  z15 This dierence means that although the bulk of the intergalactic gas in
present-day galaxy clusters is unable to cool all the gas in nonlinear objects at z  3
can cool for a similar gas fraction When gas in a halo cools it sinks to the centre until
collapse is stopped by rotation by conversion into stars or by energy input of some kind
Simulations including cooling but no star-formation or heating form small centrifugally
supported disks whose apparent stability may well be an artifact of limited numerical res-
olution eg Navarro et al 1995 If collapse is stopped by rotation and star formation and
there is no reheating then a hierarchical model fails to make a realistic galaxy population
The problem is simply that all the gas is used up making small objects at early times when
cooling is ecient so that nothing is left to make big galaxies later on
This overcooling problem has been known for 15 years Two main ways of circum-
venting it have been suggested Star formation in a small fraction of the gas in each halo
may heat and perhaps eject the rest which is then available for incorporation into later
and larger objects Alternatively coupling the gas to an ionizing background may prevent
it from collapsing fully within small potential wells and thus from cooling in such objects
Although both ideas seem feasible further detailed modelling is needed to show whether
they work in practice The few simulations done so far show results which are dramati-
cally dependent on exactly how the additional physics is included Navarro  White 1993
Note that the overcooling problem is less severe for CDM-like models than for the scale-free
models which Martin Rees and I originally worked out the CDM power spectrum has so
little small scale power that even at quite late times a substantial fraction of the material
is predicted to be in objects which have t  104K and so cannot cool This material can
be incorporated into the large objects which form at late times and so supply raw material
for the formation of big galaxies
I noted above that hierarchical clustering
32 Angular momentum problems with gas
produces barely enough angular momentum to account for that observed in spiral disks
This becomes a serious problem in simulations of hierarchical cluatering which include a
cooling gas As noted above most of the gas in such simulations settles to the centre of
the small lumps present at early times When these lumps merge to form the spiral halo
their gas cores also merge to form the spiral disk However during this merging the gas
cores lose a large fraction typically 80 of their orbital angular momentum to the dark
matter and as a result the disk ends up much smaller than expected given the specic
angular momentum of its halo Navarro et al 1995 The sizes predicted are well below
those of observed disks so this particular formation path can be ruled out The problem
is clearly that hierarchical clustering produces disks as large as those observed only if two
conditions are satised i disks must form late probably after z  1 and ii they must
form from diuse material rather from gas that has already condensed to the centre of
progenitor halos
It is the second condition that avoids substantial transfer of angular
momentum from gas to dark matter during disk formation
Phenomenological models
Over the past ve years there has been a substantial eort devoted to developing
phenomenological models for the formation of galaxies in hierarchical clustering Such
models start from a description of the clustering process based on PS theory or the
peaks theory of Bardeen and coworkers This is combined with simple models for the
internal structure of nonlinear objects for the cooling of gas within them for the conversion
of that gas into stars for the feedback generated by star formation and for the merging
of galaxies Population synthesis models can be used to calculate colours and luminosities
for the galaxies while chemical evolution models can give their metallicities
I do not
have enough space here to describe these models in any detail but I think it is important
to realise their capabilities and to recognise that they are currently much more eective
than numerical simulations for developing an understanding of how the physical processes
involved in galaxy formation shape the observable properties of the galaxy population see
White  Frenk 1991 Kaumann et al 19931994 Cole et al 1994 Kaumann 1995 Heyl
et al 1995
Properties that can be relatively easily calculated by these techniques include the joint
distributions of luminosity colour bulge-to-disk ratio metallicity gas fraction and halo
circular velocity together with the dependence of these distributions on environment and
redshift These allow predictions for galaxy counts and redshift distributions as a function
of colour and morphology One can also calculate age distributions for stars in the disks and
bulges of galaxies for comparison with the Galactic disk and bulge or with the properties of
ellipticals in dierent environments and at dierent redshifts Furthermore the evolution
of the galaxy populations in rich clusters can be analysed quite easily Additional levels
of uncertainty are introduced if one attempts to model properties which depend on galaxy
size and there has so far been little work on this area Extensions of these methods also
allow the analytic treatment of issues related to the spatial distribution of galaxies for
example bias as a function of galaxy type and luminosity Work on these problems is
only just beginning eg Kaumann et al 1996
Results published so far show that many observed systematics which were previously
thought puzzling are natural consequences of these hierarchical clustering models Ex-
amples include the morphology environment connection the Butcher-Oemler eect the
Tully-Fisher relation and its small scatter the fact that bulges look like ellipticals yet lie
within disks which could not be merger products the fact that rich clusters contain old el-
lipticals even near z  1 the simultaneous observation of steep counts and no-evolution
redshift distributions for faint galaxies There are also a few serious problems the worst
being an overabundance of faint galaxies which is a direct consequence of the halo over-
abundance problem noted above Some progress has already been made towards reducing
this discrepancy and at the moment the hierarchical clustering picture seems to provide a
remarkably good description of the observed galaxy populations and their evolution with
redshift
