INTRODUCTION
Thanks to their huge luminosity quasars deliver high signal-to-noise spectra even at very
high redshift The most distant quasars currently known are at z64 at the end of the
re-ionization epoch 1 2 The several metal features observed in their spectrum provide
precious information on the metal enrichment of their host galaxies which is linked
to their past star formation history Luminous quasars and radio galaxies are generally
hosted in very massive systems therefore they offer the possibility to investigate the
metallicity evolution of the most massive representatives of the galaxy population at
any epoch Generally metallicity information on quasars is inferred from the analysis
of the broad emission lines which are very strong but are emitted from a very small
nuclear region Metallicity information on the scales of the host galaxy can be inferred
from the narrow emission lines which are emitted from a region ranging from a few
100 pc to several kpc in size however narrow lines at high-z are generally detectable
only in those systems where the broad lines are obscured ie type 2 quasars and narrow
line radio galaxies An alternative method to investigate the metallicity of quasars host
galaxies is to measure metallicity tracers emitted from the host galaxy not excited by the
nuclear accreting black hole but powered by star formation however these tracers are
generally observable in the millimeter and far-IR spectral ranges where observations are
still limited to a few extremely bright objects Each of these metallicity measurements
provides precious and complementary information on the evolutionary stage and star
formation history of quasar host galaxies in the early universe In this paper I review
these various observational results on the metallicity enrichment of quasars and radio
galaxies focusing on the most distant systems known and I review some important
implications of these observational ndings for our understanding of galaxy formation
in the early universe

evolve with redshift
OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE METALLICITY OF
HIGH-Z AGN
The metallicity of the BLR in high-z quasars
Thanks to the large spectroscopic SDSS quasar sample and by exploiting complex
photoionization models it has been possible to constrain the metallicity of the Broad
Line Region BLR ie the innermost ionized region in large samples of quasars in
the redshift range 2z45 which is the redshift range where the main UV broad
lines used to constrain the BLR metallicity are observable in the optical 3 4 In
most cases the BLR metallicity is inferred to be several times solar Moreover there is
a clear dependence of the BLR metallicity on the quasar luminosity The metallicity-
luminosity relation may actually result from a black hole-metallicity dependence 5
or from a relation between accretion rate LLEdd and metallicity 6 However an
interesting result is that once the metallicity-luminosity relation is accounted for there
is no evidence for any evolution of the BLR metallicity with redshift 4 At redshift
z5 ie approaching the re-ionization epoch determining the metallicity of the BLR is
more difcult since several of the emission lines used to constrain the metallicity are
shifted into the near-IR Early near-IR spectroscopic studies found evidence for very
high metallicities of the BLR in a few z6 quasars 7 8 More recently Juarez et al
9 used near-IR and optical spectra to constrain the metallicity of 30 quasars in the
redshift range 4z64 They conrm very high metallicities and no evidence for any
metallicity evolution when compared with lower redshift quasars Fig1
The broad emission lines can also provide clues on relative chemical abundances In
particular the abundance of iron and carbon which are subject to a delayed enrichment
relative to a -elements provides important information on the star formation history
in quasar hosts The UV spectrum of quasars is characterized by a prominent Fe-
bump around 23003100  due to the blend of several thousand FeII transitions
whose ratio with the MgIIl 2798 doublet is used to trace the Fea
abundance ratio
However inferring an absolute value of Fea
from the FeIIMgII intensity ratio is very
difcult since the latter depends also on the physical conditions of the BLR 10
As a consequence the FeIIMgII is often take as a tracer of the relative variations
of Fea  Several studies have been published reporting measurements of FeIIMgII
in high redshift quasars 3z64 by using deep near-IR spectroscopic observations
11 12 13 14 15 16 All of these studies consistently nd that there is no evolution
of the FeIIMgII ratio as a function of redshift out to z64 A similar result is obtained
for the carbon abundance the intensity of CIVl 1549 and CIIIl 1900 relative to other
lines suggest that the abundance of carbon relative to other elements remains constant
out to z64 I will discuss the implications of these ndings in the next section
Metallicity in the NLR of high-z AGNs
The BLR is a very small region which may not be representative of the metallicity in
the host galaxy Gas on large scales in the host galaxy ionized by the AGN produces
the so called Narrow Line Region NLR These narrow lines can generally be measured
more easily if the nuclear region is obscured ie in type 2 AGNs However in high
redshift objects mostly radio-galaxies and type 2 QSOs there are often only a few faint
narrow lines detected that can be used to constrain the NLR metallicity 17 18 19 20
As a consequence of the faintness of the narrow lines the sample of high-z objects
for which the NLR metallicity has been investigated is much smaller 60 objects
than the broad line sample and currently limited to z4 By exploiting photoionization
models to interpret the narrow line ratios it is found that the metallicity of the NLR
is generally lower than typically observed in the BLR but still super-solar On average
there is no evidence for any evolution with redshift of the NLR metallicity It is also
interesting to note that the lack of evolution observed in the NLR applies also to the
CIVl 1549HeIIl 1640 narrow line ratio suggesting a lack of evolution of the carbon
abundance as for the BLR but on much larger scales
Abundances from the associated absorption systems
The resonant UV narrow absorption lines due to the interstellar medium of quasars
host galaxies provide a powerful tool to investigate the chemical abundances When
detected these absorption systems can in principle provide very accurate measurements
of the abundances of individual elements since we can directly measure the column of
each element provided that the absorption lines are not heavily saturated and that the
ionization corrections can be inferred In practice this approach requires high spectral
resolution and high SN spectra resulting in a small number of quasars where this
strategy can be pursued most of which at z3 Generally quasars associated absorption
systems show super-solar metallicities even for what concerns the carbon abundance
see 21 22 and references therein supporting the ndings obtained for the NLR with
higher precision However it is important to bear in mind two caveats The location of
the absorber is unknown we only know that it cannot be too close to the nuclear source
based on the line width and also based on the ionization structure in some cases inferred
lower limits on the distance from the nuclear source are 100 kpc As a consequence
we do not really know whether the gas being probed in absorption is part of the quasar
host galaxy or gas clouds in their halo or in the galaxy outskirts For what concerns the
carbon abundance it is important to bear in mind that dust depletion reduces the column
of carbon measured from the absorption systems Hence the carbon abundance inferred
with this method is actually a lower limit
Metallicity constraints from sub-mm observations
Recent mm and submm observations have delivered precious information on the
interstellar medium of high-z quasar host galaxies The detection of strong CO emission
in some quasars at z5 23 24 25 as well as the detection of the CII158m m line
26 27 28 with intensities comparable to lower redshift and local galaxies with
similar star forming rates strongly suggests that the host galaxy of these distant quasars
is highly metal enriched and especially in terms of carbon abundance These data are
still far from providing accurate measurements of the metallicity and of the chemical
abundances however future facilities eg ALMA SPICA will allow us to measure
additional transitions such as OI63m m NII122m m and other molecular transitions
that will provide constraints the metal abundances in the ISM 29
Another indication of high metal abundances in distant quasars is the detection of
huge of dust mass masses exceeding 108 M as inferred from the mm-submm con-
tinuum far-IR rest-frame even in the most distant quasars known close to the re-
ionization epoch 30 31 Inferring the metallicity from the dust content is difcult at
high redshift for various reasons the dust composition is not well known 32 33 2 it is
not clear what fraction of the metals have been locked in dust nally both dust mass and
gas mass when available are subject to large uncertainties However rough estimates
suggest that the observed dust masses must be associated to an ISM with solar or super-
solar metallicity If conrmed with more accurate measurements these ndings provide
further evidence that even the host galaxies of quasars close to re-ionization z6 have
reached high metallicities in these early epochs in the universe conrming the results
obtained for the BLR but on much larger scales
INTERPRETATION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR GALAXY
EVOLUTION
The apparent lack of metallicity evolution
The apparent lack of redshift evolution of the BLR metallicity may be deceiving It
does not imply that the metallicity of the BLR in individual AGNs does not evolve with
time It simply means that quasars that are detectable with a given luminosity at any
epoch have reached the same metallicity regardless of their redshift This effect probably
results from a combination of selection effects and the evolutionary link between super-
massive black hole and their host galaxies Indeed in a ux-limited survey quasars can
only be detected if they reach a minimum luminosity which translates into a minimum
black hole mass even if they are accreting at the Eddington rate Most models predict
that the quasar host galaxy evolve along with the nuclear black hole 34 35 36 37 38
so to match the local MBH  Mgal relation As a consequence by the time a quasar has
reached the luminosity to be detected its host galaxy has already evolved and enriched
the interstellar medium To illustrate this effect more clearly Fig 2 from 9 shows
the evolution of the metallicity of the quasar luminosity and of the gas mass according
to one of the theoretical models 34 The shaded area indicates the epoch when the
high-z quasar is luminous enough to be detected in the SDSS survey by the time the
quasar has reached this limit the host galaxy has already reached a metallicity of three
times solar Obscuration may be another parameter introducing additional selection ef-
fects Models expect that during the early phases the quasar is heavily embedded in gas
and dust making it unobservable at optical wavelengths Only during the latest stages
the quasar wind is powerful enough to expel large quantities of dust and gas making
the quasar detectable by optical surveys The hatched region in Fig 2 shows the epoch
when the quasar is unobscured when more than half of the gas mass has been expelled
corresponding to an epoch when the gas metallicity has reached  4 Z
The nding that the BLR metallicities of quasars observed at different redshifts have
on average the same metallicity implies that the evolutionary BH-galaxy connection
occurs in a similar manner at any epoch regardless of redshift In particular the nding
that even in z6 quasars the metallicity is similar to lower redshift quasars implies
that the same BH-galaxy co-evolutionary mechanism is already at work right after re-
ionization The very high metallicity observed at z6 indicates that the host galaxies
of these quasars are already highly evolved at least from the chemical point of view
soon after re-ionization These objects probably represent the most extreme cases of
galaxy downsizing at least in its chemical version 39 ie these are the most extreme
examples of massive galaxies forming very rapidly at very high redshift
Note that the same reasoning can explain the apparent lack of metallicity evolution
for the NLR of radio-galaxies and obscured quasars Obviously for these classes of
AGNs the selection effects due to obscuration are unlikely to play a signicant role
However the requirement of a minimum power to be detected in radio or X-ray surveys
hence minimum black hole mass probably produces the same selection effect in terms
of NLR metallicity as for the BLR
The extreme metallicities in the BLR
According to the photoionization models the metallicity in quasar nuclei as inferred
from the broad lines is extremely high ZBLR  7 Z for the most distant quasars 9 and
in some cases approaching ZBLR  10 Z These metallicities are not unrealistic Indeed
the BLR is a very small region containing only  104 M of gas therefore even a few
FIGURE 2 Evolution of the gas metallicity bolometric quasar luminosity and gas mass according to
the model in 34 The horizontal dashed line shows the approximate minimum bolometric luminosity
detectable at high-z in the SDSS quasar survey The shaded area shows the epoch when a high-z quasar is
luminous enough to be detected in the SDSS survey if unobscured The hatched area is the epoch when
the quasar is likely unobscured and therefore detectable in optical surveys By the time the quasar has
reached the luminous unobscured epoch the ISM is already highly enriched From Juarez et al 9
SNe can rapidly enrich the BLR to super-solar metallicities more specically a SN rate
of 104 yr1 can enrich the BLR to ZZ in less than 108 years More puzzling is that
such huge metallicities are not found in the stellar population of massive galaxies in the
local universe This implies that the high metallicity BLR gas must be either expelled
out of the galaxy or mixed with lower metallicity gas in the host galaxy before forming
The iron and carbon problems
Iron is mostly produced by SNIa most of which are expected to explode on timescales
longer than 1 Gyr Hence the abundance of iron relative to a -elements eg O Ne
Mg which are promptly produced by SNII on very short timescales is regarded as a
clock of star formation The lack of evolution of the the FeIIMgII ratio as a function
of redshift suggests a lack of Fea
evolution out to z64 This result is puzzling
since at z5 the age of the universe is less than 1 Gyr hence stellar evolution should
fall short of time to produce SNIa Some possible scenarios can explain this paradox
First the UV iron bump may not be a good tracer of iron abundance at all Indeed the
UV Fe bump is a strong coolant of the BLR and therefore its intensity may remain
constant independently of the iron abundance A better tracer of the iron abundance is
probably the optical Fe bump at l  4500 10 40 but which cannot be measured from
ground at z4 so this test must await JWST Another possibility is that the assumed iron
enrichment timescale is wrong Mannucci et al 41 42 show evidence for a signicant
population of SNIa that explode on timescales as short as 108 yr However Matteucci
et al 43 shows that these prompt SNIa represent only 30 of the total population
integrated over long time scales hence this scenario may not provide a viable solution
A similar timescale problem applies to carbon Carbon is mostly produced by AGB
stars and planetary nebulae Although the rst AGBs are produced as soon as 50 Myr
after the onset of star formation most of the carbon production occurs after 1 Gyr
resulting into a delayed carbon enrichment relative to a -elements The nding that
the ratio SiIVOIVCIV does not evolve with redshift out to z64 suggests that
the abundance of carbon relative to the a -elements does not evolve contrary to the
expectation that the carbon abundance should drop at z5 because stellar evolutionary
timescales fall short of time to produce carbon This carbon problem is not only found
in the BLR but it is probably an issue arising also from carbon tracers on larger scales
in the host galaxy carbon lines from the narrow line region as well as CII and CO
emission from the host galaxy Both iron and carbon issues at z6 remain open and
certainly require additional observations and modelling to be tackled
Quasar metallicity and stellar mass
The high metal abundances in quasars at high redshift especially at z6 require
that the host galaxy has undergone a rapid and powerful star formation event Infrared
and mm observations have indeed revealed vigorous star formation in the host galaxies
of distant quasars although not ubiquitously 30 31 44 45 46 However a potential
problem is the comparison of the high level of metal enrichment with the estimated
galaxy mass Indeed there are indications that high-z quasars are characterized by a
galaxytoblack hole mass ratio at least one order of magnitude lower than observed in
local galaxies 47 25 While the ISM has already reached supersolar metallicities more
than 90 of the nal stellar mass has still to be formed to reach the local MBHMgalaxy
relation If conrmed with additional observations on a larger sample of quasars these
results may be challenging to explain by models of early BH-galaxy coevolution
