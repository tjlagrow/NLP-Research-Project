Abstract
Enveloped viruses enter host cells either through endocytosis or by direct fusion of the viral membrane envelope
and the membrane of the host cell However some viruses such as HIV-1 HSV-1 and Epstein-Barr can enter
a cell through either mechanism with the choice of pathway often a function of the ambient physical chemical
conditions such as temperature and pH We develop a stochastic model that describes the entry process at the
level of binding of viral glycoprotein spikes to cell membrane receptors and coreceptors In our model receptors
attach the cell membrane to the viral membrane while subsequent binding of coreceptors enables fusion The
model quanties the competition between fusion and endocytotic entry pathways Relative probabilities for each
pathway are computed numerically as well as analytically in the high viral spike density limit We delineate
parameter regimes in which fusion or endocytosis is dominant These parameters are related to measurable and
potentially controllable quantities such as membrane bending rigidity and receptor coreceptor and viral spike
densities Experimental implications of our mechanistic hypotheses are proposed and discussed
Key words Endocytosis Fusion Receptor binding Viral entry
Introduction
Entry mechanisms of enveloped viruses viruses with a surrounding outer lipid bilayer membrane are usually
classied as being either endocytotic or fusogenic 1 2 In fusion the virus membrane and the host cell membrane
become joined by a pore Once the two membranes are contiguous the virus can directly enter the host cell This
process is typically mediated by binding of cell surface receptors to glycoprotein spikes on the viral membrane
surface which trigger embedded fusion peptides In endocytosis the host cell rst internalizes the virus particle
wrapping it in a vesicle before either fusion with the endosomal membrane or degradation of the virus as the
endosome is acidied Fusion of the endosomal membrane with the viral envelope is often triggered by the acidic
environment of the endosome
While viruses are typically thought to enter host cells via either endocytosis or fusion there is a growing list
of viruses that are known to enter cells though both pathways For example inuenza the avian leukosis virus
ALV and Semliki Forest virus SFV primarily enter cells via endocytosis followed by endosomal fusion triggered
by low pH However they have also been observed to directly fuse with host cells if the pH of the extracellular
environment is lowered 35 For some viruses eg Inuenza the glycoprotein-receptor complexes that bind the
virus to the cell membrane initiate fusion under acidic conditions encountered later in the process Many other
viruses require the binding of multiple cell surface receptors by multiple viral glycoproteins for entry and several
such viruses have also been observed to enter cells through their non-dominant pathway
At least three of the twelve types of glycoproteins in the envelope of the Herpes Simplex Virus-1 HSV-1
bind cell surface receptors as integral steps in viral entry As an initial step glycoproteins gB and gC bind to
heparan sulfate HS proteoglycans on the cell surface attaching the virus to the host cell Once the viral and
host cell membranes are brought close to each other glycoprotein gD can associate with any of a number of

Mechanisms of viral entry
cell receptors including Herpesvirus entry mediator a tumor necrosis factor receptor nectin-1 a member of
the immunoglobulin superfamily and 3-O-sulfated heparan sulphate HS to trigger fusion HSV-1 is known to
exploit at least three entry pathways direct fusion with the host cell membrane endocytosis followed by fusion
with an acidic endosome and endocytosis followed by fusion with a neutral endosome 6
Epstein-Barr virus another member of the Herpes virus family requires the binding of multiple glycoproteins to
cell surface receptors during entry When Epstein-Barr virions enter B-cells the glycoprotein complex gp350220
binds to complement receptor type II CR2 to attach the virus to the host B-cell Fusion of the virus with the cell
membrane or endosome requires that glycoprotein gp42 associate with a HLA class II protein on the cell surface
7 It is thought that the virus and cell membranes must be brought close by gp350220-CR2 binding before gp42
can bind a HLA class II protein While the Epstein-Barr virus typically enters B cells by endocytosis eventually
fusing with the endosome it enters epithelial cells by direct fusion with the plasma membrane There are at least
three models for the entry of Epstein-Barr virus into epithelial cells 1 An interaction between gp350220 on
the virus and CR2 on the cell brings the membranes close Viral glycoprotein complex gHgL can then interact
with gHgL receptor on the cell triggering fusion 2 The viral glycoprotein complex may directly interact with
its receptor on the cell membrane triggering fusion 3 The viral protein encoded by BMRF2 may interact with
integrins on the cell surface followed by gHgL-gHgLr binding 8
Human immunodeciency virus HIV has also been shown to exploit both entry mechanisms HIV requires a
receptor CD4 for endocytosis and both CD4 and a coreceptor usually CXCR4 or CCR5 to fuse with the host
cell membrane 9 10 The HIV coreceptor binds to the viral glycoprotein gp120 with a much higher anity if
the glycoprotein spike is already bound to a CD4 receptor 1113 HIV infects cells with which it fuses and is
typically inactivated upon endocytosis 10
A previous study 14 has examined the dynamics of viral entry when a single type of cell receptor attaches the
virus to the cell membrane and induces fusion In this paper we develop a stochastic model that describes viral
entry pathways in which binding of a receptor to viral glycoprotein spikes is followed by binding of a coreceptor
to viral spikes In this model the receptors are only attachment factors and the coreceptors induce fusion The
coreceptors and receptors may both bind to the same viral glycoprotein as is the case for HIV or they may bind to
dierent glycoproteins or sets of glycoproteins as is the case for HSV-1 and the Epstein-Barr virus The selection
of entry pathway is computed as a function of the kinetic rates in the model We will discuss the sensitivity of
pathway selection to the local co-receptor-mediated fusion rate and the rate of coreceptor binding
Table 1 lists relevant physical parameters for HIV-1 and HSV that guide assumptions of our model Parameters
values relevant to our model but not readily available are left blank and await future experimental investigation
2 Kinetic Model for Receptor-Coreceptor Engagement
Here we derive a stochastic model describing the competition between the endocytic and fusion viral entry
pathways We assume that receptors on a host cell membrane can bind to any one of M spikes uniformly
distributed on the surface of a single virus and that coreceptors can bind to any one of N spikes which may be
dierent from the spikes to which receptors bind see Fig 1 Receptor binding locally attaches the virus envelope
to the cell membrane while coreceptor binding leads to the formation of fusion-enabling complexes For simplicity
we consider the binding of both receptors and coreceptors to be irreversible Since binding interactions between
receptors and spikes can be very strong andor have low dissociation constants see Table 1 this approximation is
consistent with physical parameters relevant to many viruses However there is also evidence that the CD4-gp120
interaction is weak and can dissociate during coreceptor recruitment 15
We assume that only those coreceptor-binding spikes in a region where spikes are bound to receptors can bind
coreceptors This assumption is appropriate if the receptors act as the attachment factor that brings the viral
and cell membranes close enough for the coreceptor to bind For example the binding of CR2 receptors to the
large gp350220 glycoprotein complex on the Epstein-Barr virus typically precedes attachment of fusion-inducing
HLA class II proteins to the smaller gp42 glycoprotein This assumption also applies to HIV since the anity of
coreceptors for viral spikes increases signicantly if the spike has already bound a receptor 1113
The ratio of coreceptor-binding spikes to receptor-binding spikes is dened by r  NM  For viruses where
attachment receptors and fusion initiating coreceptors attach to the same glycoprotein spike such as HIV-1 we
can simply set r  1 in our model Although we assume that each spike can bind at most only one receptor andor
one coreceptor experimentally inferred stoichiometries range from one to a handful 1618 Our model can be
straightforwardly adapted to describe specic receptorcoreceptorspike stoichiometries
Mechanisms of viral entry
In order for endocytosis to occur the virus must be fully wrapped by the cell membrane We assume that
when the virus is fully wrapped all receptor-binding spikes have a receptor attached However as more of the
cell membrane contacts the virus membrane through receptor binding the rate of binding of fusion-inducing
coreceptors increases and fusion is increasingly likely It has been shown that for HIV viral spikes act independently
to induce fusion 19 so we assume that the fusion rate is proportional to the number of viral spike-receptor-
coreceptor complexes Although it is possible that spike-receptor-coreceptor complexes that induce fusion do
so in a cooperative manner we are not aware of any evidence that complexes aggregate in order to initiate a
cooperative response From a modeling perspective and in light of experimental evidence 19 the most reasonable
assumption is that the randomly distributed spike-receptor-coreceptor complexes locally induce irreversible fusion
pore formation in an independent and Poissonian manner Thus the total viral fusion rate increases linearly with
the number of spike-receptor-coreceptor complexes formed Within our stochastic model the likely pathway of
virus entry endocytosis or fusion will also depend on the specic rates of receptor and coreceptor binding
A mathematical framework representing our stochastic model is found by considering at any given time t
the probability Pmnt that m spikes are bound to a receptor and n spikes are bound to a coreceptor With the
following denition of the relevant rates in our problem

transitions within the m n-state space shown in Fig 2
We treat all transitions in our model as Markovian implicitly assuming that they do not depend on past
congurations This assumption is appropriate if the attachment rates are kinetically limited by membrane
uctuations or by receptorcoreceptor binding rather than by diusion Diusion-limited binding of receptors
and coreceptors gives rise to history-dependent kinetics and must be treated within the framework of stochastic
moving boundary problems Deterministic moving boundary problems relevant for virus wrapping are treated in
20 and 21 For binding kinetics to not be diusion-limited receptors and coreceptors must diuse fast enough
to replenish a receptor-depleted region before the next binding event occurs The time required for concentration
variations to diuse away is arcDrc where ar and ac are the typical areas per receptor and coreceptor on the
cell surface and Dr and Dc are their diusion coecients in the cell membrane Therefore provided
the history-independent binding assumption is justied For the HIV infection systems CD4 receptor and CCR5
coreceptor concentrations are approximately 103m2 and 60m2 respectively Upon using the cell surface

and qmn  Dcac
Mechanisms of viral entry
receptor and coreceptor diusion coecients in Table 1 we nd that pmn  50s and qmn  3s are required
for CD4 and CCR5 engagement to be kinetically limited and not diusion-limited
Although our main qualitative ndings are independent of the precise form for the attachment rates pmn and
qmn we nonetheless examine a specic physical model for these rates First assume that a receptor binds with
rate pmn to only those spikes that are within some small distance  of the contact line Lm see Fig 3 where
the membrane detaches from the virus A functional form for this rate can be derived by considering the number
of ways additional receptors can bind given that there are already m receptor-spike complexes making up the
contact region Fluctuations of the cell membrane will be distributed in size with a typical scale  Fig 3
The plasma membrane uctuations either thermally excited or driven by cellular processes such as cytoskeletal
reorganization 22 can be caught by the virus if they bring a receptor into the proximity of a spike As shown
in Fig 3 the membrane wrapping process is a Brownian ratchet that uses the spikes within a distance  of
the contact line of length Lm to catch the cell membrane uctuations The rate of attachment of an additional
receptor can be written as pmn  Lma1
r  where  is an intrinsic attempt rate for binding and uctuations
of typical size  a1
is the viral spike concentration and a1
is the receptor concentration on the cell membrane
The term Lma1
represents the probability that a membrane uctuation of typical size  will encounter a
spike on the viral surface when m receptors have already previously bound The approximate spherical geometry

where p1M is the intrinsic rate of binding the second receptor when initially one is bound This intrinsic rate
depends on a number of physical parameters such as cell membrane bending rigidity through  and  and cell
surface receptor concentration For sti membranes under tension a membrane wrapping a spherical particle
encounters an energy barrier near half-wrapping 23 This can be incorporated into the dynamics by assuming
p1 has an M dependence with a minimum near m  M2 Other forms for pmn can also be motivated 24 by
considering the mechanics of wrapping 25
The binding rate of coreceptors will be proportional to the integer number of receptor-spike complexes that
have not yet bound to coreceptors
where q1 is the intrinsic rate of a coreceptor binding to to a spike-receptor complex

Finally we describe the fusion and endocytosis steps The rates of these processes kf and ke are the least
well measured The individual fusion rates kf depend not only on the particular spike-receptor complex but may
also depend on other molecular factors such as the lipid composition In model systems involving the gp41 fusion
peptide of the HIV-1 glycoprotein-receptor complex the fusion rate was found to be of the order kf  001s
26 Physical models for kf can also be motivated from phenomenological considerations of fusion intermediates
2730 andor estimated from computer simulations 30 31
The pinching-o of membrane vesicles in endocytosis is potentially a more complex process activated by
GTPases such as dynamin 32 The kinetics of this process may be akin to the kiss and run fast mode of
endocytosis at neuronal synapses A wide range of rates 01s  ke  20s for synaptic vesicle kinetics has been
reported 33
3 Numerical Solution of Master Equation
Solutions to Eq 1 can be found numerically for up to reasonably large values of M and N  From the resulting
probabilities we construct time-independent quantities of interest
The total time integrated probability Qe that the virus undergoes endocytosis can be constructed from

Similarly the total time integrated probability Qf that the virus undergoes fusion is
Qf  kf Xmnn
Pmntdt  1  Qe
where the last equality arises from conservation of probability and the assumption of non detaching receptors
We solve for Qe and Qf by taking the Laplace transform of Eq 1 and setting s  0 If we dene Pmn

Qf  Pmnn nkf Pmns  0 respectively We can also nd the mean times hTei to viral entry conditioned

4 Results and Analysis
In this section we discuss solutions of the Master Equation Eq 1 outlined in Section 2 For simplicity consider
that the ratio of the number of spikes that can bind coreceptors to the number of spikes that can bind receptors
is r  1 and that M  N  This implies either that the number of receptor-binding spikes equals the number of
coreceptor binding spikes or that receptors and coreceptors both bind the same spikes as is the case for HIV
The results for r 6 1 are qualitatively similar to the results of r  1 when the replacement kf  rkf is made see
Appendix
41 Pathway probabilities
We rst explore how the probability that the virus undergoes endocytosis Qe depends on problem parameters
Since Qe  Qf  1 it is sucient to consider only Qe In Fig 4a Qe is plotted as a function of the normalized
fusion rate kf p1 for dierent values of the normalized intrinsic coreceptor binding rate q1p1 The number of
viral spikes M  N  was chosen to be 100 The probability that the virus undergoes endocytosis decreases with
increasing fusion rate but a small coreceptor binding rate can attenuate fusion even when kf is large In Figure
4b we plot the probability that the virus undergoes endocytosis as a function of normalized fusion rate kf p1
for dierent values of the normalized endocytosis rate kep1
The dependence of the endocytosis probability Qe on the number of viral spikes M  is shown in Fig 5
Although the binding rate pm increases with M see Eq 3 so do the number of spikes that need to be engaged
by receptors to achieve the full wrapping required for endocytosis The time required to fully wrap the virus
is therefore constant with respect to M  However the fusion rate is proportional to the number of spikes with
Mechanisms of viral entry
coreceptors bound and is thus proportional to N  As N increases the probability that the particle undergoes
fusion before it becomes fully wrapped increases as illustrated by Fig 5 Figures 4 and 5 clearly show a marked
decrease in the endocytosis probability as the fusion rate kf is increased
Since kf may vary greatly depending on physical chemical conditions as well as on viral species it is important
to estimate the values of kf for which endocytosis or fusion is the dominant mode of entry To better understand
how Qe depends on kf  we consider the continuum limit of Eq 1 appropriate for large M N  The probabilities
of full wrapping and endocytosis as well as times to fusion and endocytosis can be calculated analytically by the
method of characteristics see Appendix Figure 6 compares our continuum limit analytic solution with the exact
numeric solution and agreement is good for M N  100 The analytic solution see Eq 30 in Appendix provides
a guide for estimating the parameters for which endocytosis is likely
Let us now dissect the entry dynamics and estimate values of ke and kf for which endocytosis will occur For
certain parameters the virus is likely to fuse before it becomes fully wrapped In this case the probability that
the virus reaches the fully wrapped state will be small and fusion will be the dominant mode of entry Only if
the virus is likely to become fully wrapped is endocytosis a possible alternative to fusion Endocytosis will occur
only if the probability that M receptors become bound to the virus PM  is order 1 and endocytosis occurs more
quickly than fusion once the virus is fully wrapped For single receptor-spike complexes that attach membranes
and induce fusion 14 previous asymptotic analysis showed that
must be satised in order for the virus to become fully wrapped

In that analysis pm was a typical receptor
Analogous conditions for endocytosis can be found when both receptor and coreceptor binding are required
for fusion These conditions can be found numerically by computing Qe from Eqs 1 and 5 However upon using
the specic forms for the receptor and coreceptor binding rates given by Eqs 3 and 4 the conditions can also be
deduced from the wrapping probability PM in the large M limit From Eq 25 in the Appendix

where   q12p1 This asymptotic expression allows us to determine when the wrapping probability is appre-
ciable If coreceptors are required for fusion as considered in this study the expected behavior will be similar to
the single receptor model only if coreceptor binding is faster than receptor binding Indeed when q1  p1   1
we nd that the condition
p1  1
is required for full wrapping Since pm  p1M  we recover the condition Eq 10 here given in 14 when r  1
Figure 7a shows the numerically computed probability of full wrapping PM  as a function of rkf Mp1 with
r  1 The condition for full wrapping given by Eq 12 holds even when parameters are individually varied over
a wide range of values
Now consider the condition for full wrapping when coreceptor binding is slow compared to receptor binding
For extremely small q1p1  2  1N  the M N   continuum limit for PM Eq 11 is not appropriate
When coreceptor binding is extremely small no coreceptors bind and the virus always becomes fully wrapped
independent of kf  However for 1N  q1p1  1 or 1N    1 The condition for PM  1 derived from
Eq 11 is

If condition 12 is satised condition 13 will be satised provided that q1  p1 Thus condition 12 is sucient for
the virus to become fully wrapped however because slow coreceptor binding can limit the eects of a fast fusion
rate condition 12 is not necessary particularly when coreceptor binding is slow In other words even if rkf Mp1
is large as long as q1p1 is small enough condition 13 can still be satised and full wrapping can still occur In
Fig 7b PM is plotted as a function of rkf Mp1q1p1 with various parameters independently varied When
coreceptor binding is slow the condition given by Eq 13 is found to predict whether the virus is likely to reach
the fully wrapped state Although we have used the particular binding rates pm and qmn from Eqs 3 and 4
analogous conditions for PM  1 can be motivated for general binding rates see Appendix
Mechanisms of viral entry
We can now derive sucient conditions for endocytosis after the virus becomes fully wrapped In the case
where the coreceptor binding rate is large compared to the receptor binding rate we expect that when the virus
reaches the fully wrapped state nearly all N spikes will be coreceptor-bound Once the virus is fully wrapped it
fuses with the cell membrane with total and maximal rate N kf  while it is endocytosed by the cell with rate ke
Thus endocytosis will be the dominant mode of viral entry if
ke  kf N  rkf M
Provided the virus has a high probability of reaching the fully wrapped state ke  N kf is always a sucient
but not always a necessary condition for endocytosis When coreceptor binding is not fast we will typically need
to consider the full solution given by Eq 30 in order to determine when endocytosis is likely However we can
consider the limiting case where the coreceptor binding rate is small compared to both the receptor binding rate
q1  p1 and the fusion rate q1N  kf  In this case we can assume that fusion is limited by the coreceptor
binding rate and the condition required for ecient endocytosis is
The conditions described above for ecient endocytosis are summarized in the Discussion and Conclusions section
and delineated in a parameter-space phase diagram

42 Mean entry times
We now investigate hTei the mean viral entry time via the endocytosis pathway and hTfi the mean entry time
via the fusion pathway The normalized mean times are computed from Eqs 7 and 8 and are plotted in Fig
8 as a function of the fusion rate per bound coreceptor kf  Endocytosis is governed by two potentially rate-
limiting steps viral wrapping and the nal endocytosis step pinching-o of the cell membrane For small ke
the endocytosis step is rate limiting and hTei scales as 1ke when Qe  1 For the parameters used in Fig 8a
the receptor binding rates are much faster than the endocytosis rate thus ke is the limiting rate constant As the
fusion rate kf increases both the probability of endocytosis Qe and the mean endocytosis times hTei decrease
One might initially expect hTfi but not hTei to decrease with increasing kf  However we expect there to be some
distribution of times at which the virus becomes fully wrapped A larger fusion rate will preferentially annihilate
trajectories that take longer to reach the fully wrapped state Therefore only trajectories that quickly reach the
fully wrapped state survive to m  M and participate in endocytosis resulting in a decreased hTei when kf is
increased
In Fig 8b we plot the normalized mean entry times as a function of kep1 the normalized endocytosis rate
We nd that as we increase ke the mean time hTei decreases and then plateaus The plateau occurs when ke is
suciently fast that endocytosis is no longer rate-limiting Rather membrane wrapping is the rate limiting step
and hTei becomes independent of ke
43 Mean receptorcoreceptors bound at entry
Finally consider the mean numbers of receptors and coreceptors bound to the virus at the time of entry
Fig 9a we plot hmfi the mean number of receptors bound when fusion occurs and hmi the mean number of
receptors bound when the virus enters the cell through either pathway as functions of q1 the coreceptor binding
rate As q1 increases Qe decreases and the virus is more likely to fuse with the host cell Because the virus fuses
more rapidly there is less time for receptors to bind and hmi decreases Fig 9b shows the mean number of
coreceptors bound to the virus at the time of entry For very small coreceptor binding rates the virus typically
undergoes endocytosis before a coreceptor can bind and hnei  1 where hnei is the mean number of coreceptors
bound when the virus undergoes endocytosis However at least one coreceptor must bind for fusion to occur
therefore when q1 is small the conditional mean number of bound coreceptors hnfi  1 As q1 becomes large
the probability that the virus undergoes endocytosis becomes small but the mean number of coreceptors bound
to the viruses that do undergo endocytosis approaches N  100 We know that when q1 is large n  rm Since
full wrapping m  M  is required for endocytosis to occur we also expect hnei  N 
Mechanisms of viral entry
5 Discussion and Conclusions
We have developed a stochastic model describing the binding of receptors and coreceptors to viral glycoprotein
spikes and the subsequent competition between endocytosis and fusion during entry of enveloped viruses Recep-
tors function as simple attachment factors in our model while subsequent binding of coreceptors enables fusion
We found parameter regimes in which endocytosis is favored and derived analytic expressions for the probability
of endocytosis in the large spike number limit M N   Since the endocytosis and fusion rates ke and kf 
are dicult to measure we summarize our results by a kf  ke phase diagram dened by conditions 12 13
14 and 15 and shown schematically in Fig 10
Our model provides a mechanistic basis for a number of experimental measurements and observations For
example the dual entry pathways of certain viruses suggest that under certain conditions delineated in Fig 10
inhibition of fusion does not necessarily preclude viral entry through endocytosis HIV fusion inhibitors such as
Enfuvirtide T-20 bind the intermediary spike-CD4 complex of HIV-1 35 36 and reduce kf by preventing CCR5
from inducing fusion Maraviroc binds CCR5 and prevents it from binding the spike-CD4 complex eectively
reducing q1 and also preventing fusion 37 Since the virus may still enter through the endocytosis pathway our
analysis suggests that the eectiveness of fusion inhibitors relies on endocytic entry being less infective than fusion
The sensitivity of entry of HIV strains to cell CD4 and CCR5 levels have recently been quantitatively studied
using cells lines in which expression levels of receptor and coreceptor can be independently varied 38 This system
provides a way of independently varying p1 and q1 and has revealed qualitatively dierent usage patterns by
dierent HIV strains Our model provides an additional dimension to the analysis of receptorcoreceptor tropism
If endocytic entry does not signicantly diminish the probability of nuclear entry and productive infection it is
possible that strains with similar infectivities actually prefer dierent entry pathways
Infection measurements using for example luciferase reporting of p24 coat protein levels after productive
infection cannot directly determine entry pathways However using single molecule imaging techniques both
the timing and entry pathways can be directly observed 3941 Such direct imaging techniques may be able to
distinguish the mean conditional times to fusion and endocytosis particularly in systems with large fusion and
endocytosis rates as shown in Fig 8
Additionally kinetic studies have been performed to extract the stoichiometry of receptors and coreceptors per
spike per fusion event 1618 34 42 Even though our analysis was based on an intrinsic molecular stoichiometry
of one spike one receptor andor one coreceptor it implies that the apparent stoichiometry can vary depending on
the degree of wrapping and on average the number of spikes that are receptorcoreceptor-engaged prior to fusion
or endocytosis The apparent stoichiometries are dened by hmfi and hnfi derived from our model and shown
in Fig 9 Cells with higher surface densities of coreceptors and hence larger q1 would more likely fuse before
signicant wrapping and formation of spike-receptor-coreceptor complexes occur Therefore a high coreceptor
binding rate can present a lower apparent coreceptor stoichiometry
It would thus be interesting to measure
kinetics and correlate spikereceptorcoreceptor stoichiometry across viral strains with dierent apparent usage
stoichiometries and across cell types with varying concentrations of surface receptors and coreceptors
The assumption that the viral spikes are evenly distributed on the surface of the virus is valid only if the spikes
are immobile on the virus surface during the entry process Freely diusing glycoprotein spikes will preferentially
bind to membrane receptors or coreceptors when the spikes come near the cell membrane Thus spikes with
receptors and coreceptors bound would tend to cluster near the bottom of the virus precluding full wrapping In
this case the probability that the virus enters the cell via fusion would be increased It is also possible that the
viral glycoproteins form functional clusters on the viral envelope 43 It is known that the glycoprotein spikes
of recently budded HIV-1 are associated with the underlying matrix proteins but that proteolysis occurs during
the maturation process 44 45 If softening of a maturing virus particle 45 also increases glycoprotein spike
mobility one would expect that mature HIV-1 would be biased towards using the fusion pathway
The model we have developed considers only the rudimentary receptor engagement processes prior to fusion or
endocytosis Nonetheless many more complex mechanisms can be described by our model provided the eective
rate parameters are properly interpreted or the model is augmented to include other intermediary processes
For example consider the possibility that binding of the virus to a cell surface receptor activates an endocytic
pathway that increases the rate by which the virus is wrapped by the cell membrane The increased wrapping rate
may be the result of for example a decreased eective stiness of the cytoskeleton that allows the virus to more
easily enter the cell 46 An endocytotic pathway may also rely on the clustering cell surface receptors andor
coreceptors as observed in 47 resulting in a high local receptorcoreceptor concentration near the virus thereby
eectively increasing the rate of receptor and possibly coreceptor binding
Mechanisms of viral entry
1 and qi
Such a viral entry process can be incorporated within our model by assuming that prior to activation receptors
1 and that after activation receptors and coreceptors bind with rates pa
and coreceptors bind with rates pi
1  respectively We further assume that activation occurs some time a after the rst receptor binds And
for simplicity we will again consider that M  N and r  1 In the absence of an active endocytosis process
two conditions were required for endocytosis to occur 1 the virus had to reach the fully wrapped state and 2
endocytosis had to be faster than fusion in the fully wrapped state If however the cell must initiate an active
process for endocytosis an additional condition arises 3 the cell must reach the activated state without the
virus undergoing fusion All three conditions must be satised if activated endocytosis is to occur If activation
is important the inactivated receptor binding rate pi
1 is slow such that on average few receptors bind before
1M  1a In this case the third condition can be described in terms of the eective
activation occurs and pi
binding rates as follows
If the inactivated coreceptor binding rate is fast compared with the time scale on which activation occurs
1  1a the virus will survive to the activated state provided akf  1 If the inactivated coreceptor binding
rate is slow qi
1  1a it is unlikely that a coreceptor will bind before the activated state is reached and the
virus will become activated for any kf  The delay time a required to activate the cells endocytosis machinery
will be relevant if the third condition that the cell reaches the activated state before viral fusion is not met but
conditions 1 and 2 are In this case a model without the activation step would predict that the virus should
undergo endocytosis when it in fact will undergo fusion In Table 2 we summarize the criteria under which all
three activated endocytosis conditions are met
We can also consider the case in which cells undergo clathrin or caveolin-dependent endocytosis that competes
with the fusion process 40 48 49 In these cases the membrane adhesion or wrapping rate pmn is no longer
a function receptor concentration but is rather a function of the rate of assembly of clathrin subunits 50 or
calveolin M of which cover the virus This rate would be a function of clathrin or calveolin concentration or of
molecules that recruit them If the formation of clathrin pits or calveolae occurs successively in an approximately
axisymmetric manner we expect the functional form for pmn would be unchanged from Eq 3 Three variants of
our model could apply to fusion under clathrin or calveolin-mediated endocytosis 1 If coreceptors can continue
to bind viral spikes and induce fusion in regions of the membrane that are coated with clathrin or caveolin the
model described in this work is directly applicable
In this case monomeric clathrincaveolin are receptors
and M is the total number of monomers required to encapsulate the virus 2 If receptor binding but not
fusion is precluded in regions of the membrane coated by clathrincaveolin the coreceptor binding rate is no
longer given by qmn  q1nm  n
In this case coreceptors like monomers of clathrin or caveolin only
bind along the perimeter of the coated membrane region The coreceptor binding rate then has a form similar
to the receptor monomeric clathrincaveolin binding rate and is given by qmn  q1Nq1 cid01  2m
M cid12
other aspects of the model would remain unchanged 3 If coreceptors within a region of the membrane coated
by clathrincaveolin cannot induce fusion the virus can still undergo fusion if coreceptors bind to spikes along
the perimeter of the coated region and induce fusion before the coated region grows enough to cover the location
of the coreceptor When coreceptor binding is fast compared to the rate at which the protein scaold assembles
the instantaneous fusion rate is proportional to the number of spikes near the contact region Instead of nkf  the
eective mdependent fusion rate kf Nq1 cid01  2m
M cid12
arises The fusion rate depends only on the number m of
bound receptors and the total number N of coreceptors It is independent of the number n of bound coreceptors
rendering the state space eectively one-dimensional

Using specic forms for the receptor and coreceptor attachment rates pmn and qmn analytic expressions for the
wrapping and endocytosis probabilities can be obtained in the large spike number limit M  1   Assuming

where  is the incomplete lower Gamma function This expression was used to generate the analytic results plotted
in Fig 6
Besides our results obtained using the specic forms of receptor and coreceptor binding rates conditions
analogous to those in Eqs 12 and 13 can also be obtain for general coreceptor-independent binding rate pm by
using simple scaling arguments When coreceptor binding is fast q1  p1 the probability of fusion is approximately
kfhnfit where
is the mean conditional wrapping time and hnfi is the mean number of bound coreceptors before fusion For fast
coreceptor binding hnfi  N  and the necessary but not sucient condition for full virus wrapping PM  1 is
t 
 rkf M
pm  1
When coreceptor binding is slow hnfi  q1N t increases linearly with both time and the number of available
coreceptor-biding spikes In this case the necessary condition for virus wrapping becomes
kf q1N t2  rkf M q1  M
Upon inserting the smoothly varying forms for pm from Eq 3 into the above relationships they reduce to the
conditions 12 and 13 respectively

Figure 1 A schematic of the kinetic steps involved in receptor and coreceptor engagement which ultimately lead
to membrane fusion or endocytosis Receptors and coreceptors in the cell membrane are represented by black line
segments and red zig-zags respectively The projected contact area nucleated by the number of bound receptors
is also shown Only viral spikes that have a coreceptor bound can induce fusion Endocytosis can occur only
when the contact region grows to the surface area of the virus particle Left The receptors and coreceptors both
bind to the same viral spikes blue circles An example of such as virus is HIV-1 where spikes likely composed
of trimers of gp12041 bind to both CD4 and CCR5 Right An example such as Herpes Simplex Virus in
which coreceptors and receptors bind to dierent spikes with the ratio of receptor-binding spikes blue circles to
coreceptor-binding spikes yellow hexagons dened by r
Figure 2 Two-dimensional state space for receptor and coreceptor-mediated viral entry Each state corresponds
to a virus particle bound to m  M receptors and n  N  rM coreceptors In this example the fraction of
coreceptor-binding spikes to receptor-binding spikes is r  12 The probability uxes through the fusion and
endocytosis pathways are indicated by the red and green arrows respectively A representative trajectory of the
stochastic process that results in endocytosis is indicated by the blue dashed curve
Figure 3 A schematic of a partially wrapped virus particle The unbound spikes above the contact region are
represented by light blue circles while the receptor-bound spikes in the contact region are represented by the dark
blue circles Spikes that are bound to coreceptors are indicated by the red-lled circles The unbound receptors
and coreceptors on the cell membrane green are not shown
Figure 4 a The probability that the virus undergoes endocytosis is plotted as a function of the normalized fusion
rate kf p1 for dierent values of the normalized coreceptor binding rate q1p1 The probability of endocytosis
decreases with increasing fusion rate and for a given fusion rate the probability of endocytosis increases with
decreasing q1p1 In this example the normalized endocytosis rate kep1  1 b For q1p1  1 the probability
of endocytosis is plotted as a function of fusion rate for dierent values of the normalized endocytosis rate kep1
In both plots the number of receptor-binding spikes and the number of coreceptor-binding spikes are set to
M  N  100
Figure 5 Endocytosis rates are plotted as a function of M  N  During wrapping the fusion rate is proportional
to the number of bound coreceptors and increases with increasing N in this case equal to M  The probability
that the virus enters the cell through endocytosis decreases with increasing M  N

the wrapping probability PM is plotted as a function of the dimensionless expression rkf Mp1q1p1 In this
case the transition of PM from large to small values occurs at rkf Mp1q1p1  O1 In both plots only one
parameter was varied within a group of symbols of the same color and shape The number of spikes M was varied
within the groups of circles and the fusion rate kf was varied within the groups of triangles

Figure 10 Qualitative phase diagram showing the regimes of parameter space in which endocytosis is dominant
Diagrams ab and c correspond to fast intermediate and slow coreceptor binding respectively
diagrams parameters falling within the blue region left of the vertical thick dashed line favor full viral wrapping
before fusion occurs PM  1 In the yellow sector above the thin dashed curves the rate of endocytosis exceeds
the eective rate of fusion in the fully wrapped state In the green intersection of these regions the virus is likely
to reach the fully wrapped state and undergo endocytosis Note that when coreceptor binding is very slow c
the virus reaches the fully wrapped state for all values of kf
