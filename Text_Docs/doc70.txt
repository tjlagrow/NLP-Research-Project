1 Introduction 
The  study  of  natural  language  especially  Arabic  and  mechanisms  for  the 
implementation of automatic processing is a fascinating field of study with various 
potential applications The importance of tools for natural language processing is 
materialized  by  the  need  to  have  applications  that  can  effectively  treat  the  vast 
mass of information available nowadays on electronic forms Among these tools 
mainly driven by the necessity of a fast writing in alignment to the actual daily life 
speed our interest is on the writing auditors 
The morphological and syntactic properties of Arabic make it a difficult language 
to master and explain the lack in the processing tools for that language Among 
these properties  we can mention the complex structure of the Arabic word the 
agglutinative  nature  lack  of  vocalization  the  segmentation  of  the  text  the 
linguistic richness etc 
In that perspective our project aims to develop a system to detect errors in spelling 
structure and conjugation of the Arabic language In this article we will proceed as 
follows In the first section well present some approaches used for the correction 
of errors The second section will be devoted to detailed studies of our proposed 
system  In  the  last section  well  perform  experimental  tests  to  evaluate  the 
performance of our system

A  multi-agent  system  is  a  system  of  agents  group  that  communicate  with  one 
another to provide answers about a goal to achieve 
MASPAR is a system of analysis of Arabic texts based on the approach of multi-
agents It  consists  of  a  set  of  agents  using  a  direct  communication  by  sending 
messages These  agents  work  together  in  order  to  make  syntaxes  analysis  of  a 
sentence given by the user by determining its syntax composition tree je ne sais

211 MASPAR System Limits 
The  major  drawback  of  such  system  is  the  time  taken  by  the  agents  for 
communication and interaction 
One  might  also  note  that  the  MASPAR  system  does  not  detect  errors  of 
conjugation Also it has a non-ergonomic interface 
3 Proposed System 
31 General Description 
Our  system  Figure  1  is  designed  to  detect  errors  in  spelling  structure  and 
conjugation in a non- vowelized Arabic text It consists of five phases each uses 
the information received from the previous phase to finally get a text containing the 
least number of mistakes 
The segmentation phase consists on dividing the text into sentences and then into 
words The lexical phase subsequently receives the word and checks its existence 
in the database of words 
After  verifying  that  this  word  belongs  to  the  language  the  phase  labelling 
associates the word it has received the possible morph syntactic labels this makes 
the word ambiguous hence the need  to remove this ambiguity by passing phase 
disambiguation which in applying certain rules is used to assign to this word the 
most suitable label 
 232

To correct the word Wc we must compare it with the database of words that we 
have if this word belongs to our dictionary it means that Wc is a correct word 
otherwise our system will detect a misspelling 
The  algorithm  then  verify  the  proper  structure  of  this  sentence  otherwise  the 
system will detect a structure fault Finally our system is also capable to detect the 
faults of conjugation in a sentence 
We first introduce the general architecture of our system

32 Detailed Description 
When receiving an electronic text to analyze our system launches the first phase 
which  is  segmentation This  phase  begins  with  the  identification  of  the  text 
sentences  based  on  punctuation  signs  then  on  the  words  in  each  sentence 
Subsequently  the  words  in  each  sentence  will  be  transferred  one  by  one  to  the 
lexical phase 
This will verify whether the word belongs to the language or not by checking its 
existence  in  our  database  of  words Subsequently  the  word  is  sent  to  the  next 
phase   The  phase  label  is  responsible  for  providing  possible  morph  syntactic 
characteristics of each received word from the lexical phase This means that a 
word cant go to the labelling phase unless its belonging to our database has been 
confirmed within the lexical phase 
Because  each  word  can  have  several  labels  the  analysis  of  the  word  can  face 
certain  ambiguity  Thats  why  we  must  use 
ambiguity Therefore  disambiguation  phase  is  triggered  to  limit  the  number  of 
labels associated with the word and assign a single label at a time 
Once the ambiguity is removed we get into the final phase of the system which  
role  is  to  apply  rules  that  enable  to  compare  the  analyzed  structures This  helps 
detect errors in structure and conjugation

End For 
321 Segmentation 
This phase consists on dividing the text into sentences and the sentences into words 
based  on  markers  at the beginning  and  the  end  for example  points  semicolons 
colons 
322 Lexical Analysis 
This phase checks the belonging of each word to the language obtained from the 
segmentation phase based on the data base of the words available  
Verify  the  existence  of  the  base  in  the  lexicon    We  must  ensure  that  the  words 
introduced constitute the basics of the Arabic language For that reason we verify 
the existence of the base in the lexicon We have to consult the database of Arabic 
words if the extracted base coincides with a word from the database we conclude 
that the word exists in Arabic 
323 Labelling 
This operation aims to add to the words linguistic information with morphological 
or syntactic nature in order to identify them 
We  have  presented  several  possible tags  of  the  word  minimum  prefix    base  
suffix 
However  the  lack  of  vocalization  does  not  accurately  determine  the  proper 
etiquette of the word which causes a certain ambiguity To reduce this ambiguity 
we will proceed to the next step 
 235  
LES RESSOURCES LANGAGIERES  CONSTRUCTION ET EXPLOITATION 
324 Disambiguation 
A  disambiguation  is  needed  to  limit  the  number  of  labels  of  these  words  and 
subsequently improve the detection of grammatical errors 
Compatibility Rules It can reduce the ambiguity of a word by associating it with 
one type at a time so the sentence containing the ambiguous word has more than a 
structure  based  on  the  number  of  labels  that  word Subsequently  the  system 
associates to the word the suitable type according to the structural rules  
325 Detecting faults 
For  the  detection  of  faults  we  can  use  rules  of  grammar  These  rules  describe 
correct grammatical patterns For this we have defined a basic structure rules and 
another different basis for the conjugation rules If some text does not match any 
rule  a  structural  or  conjugal  error  is  detected To  detect  structural  faults  well 
compare  our  sentences  structure  with  the  basic  structural  rules  if  this  structure 
does not coincide with any rule then a lack of structure will be detected otherwise 
if  the  structure  is  correct  and  if  it  contains  a  verb  since  the  combination  only 
applies  to  the  verb  our  system  will  have  access  to  our  database  conjugation 
satisfies  a  certain  compatibility  between  pre-and  post-basic  core  that  typically 
accompany  the  verb if  our  sentence  presents  a  bad combination  when  a  fault  is 
detected  In  the  end  the  user  receives  a  text  containing  errors  detected  with 
staining of these faults each depending on the type of errors detected 
326The databases used in the system 
XML database for the detection of spelling errors 
 236  
LES RESSOURCES LANGAGIERES  CONSTRUCTION ET EXPLOITATION 
To detect if the spelling of a given word is correct or not the verification process 
run through the XML tree of the dictionary and compare the word with the word 
list file It sets out below a portion of our base words 
XML Data Base for the detection of structural faults 
After ascertaining that the specified words are spelled correctly we assess at this 
level  whether the  sentence  structure is  coherent  or  not  by  comparing  it  with the 
base of the structures we have created an XML file with the following form  
XXMMLL  DDaattaa  BBaassee  ffoorr  ddeetteeccttiinngg  ffaauullttss  ccoonnjjuuggaattiioonn 
Our system can also detect conjugation errors To handle this we used an XML file 
as follows 
4 Test and Validation 
We choose to assess the performance criteria that are available the ergonomics and 
the response time chosen by our system 
 237  
LES RESSOURCES LANGAGIERES  CONSTRUCTION ET EXPLOITATION 
Regarding ergonomics performance analyzers must have a user-friendly interface 
presenting  a  number  of  functionality  to  help users  better handle this interface  to 
manage the features offered by the system 
The speed of response is another important constraint for parsers for to be useful 
in the real world they must return a response very quickly 
41 Experiments 
Our  experiments  on  the  system  relate  texts  of  Arabic  literature  in  various 
fields We  introduced  those  relating  to  the  field  of  Medicine  Marketing 
Economics and Arabic grammar

To  evaluate  the  error  detection  we  use  the  rate  of  accuracy  standard  indicator 
classification 4 This indicator is between 0 and 1One being the perfect result 
To calculate this index we needed to appoint different sets 
Let D be the total set of words incorrect words D  and D-words correct D  and 
D-form a partition of D Let R be the set of words identified as erroneous Some 
words are part of R  D D-other 
The  precision  is  out  as  an  index  of  the  proportion  of  words  identified  as 
erroneous Its formula is 
Detection Accuracy   D   R    R  
42 Results and interpretations 
We  note  that  our  system  has  a  good  detection  for  errors  in  spelling  and 
structure Indicator precision  1 for the detection of spelling errors and 075 for 
structures Indeed we get a quick response if the word entered is incorrect or the 
structure  is  wrong We  therefore  have  a  very  high  proportion  of  errors  actually 
detected We can also note the good accuracy of the wrong word or structure which 
facilitates the coloration of errors 
We  can  also  note  that  our  system  has  a  medium  detection  for  errors  in 
conjugation Indicator accuracy  056 This is for several reasons 
Note  first  the  difficulty  of  the  Arabic  language  in  particular  as  regards  to  the 
conjugation 
Then our system took only where the verb is conjugated in the simple present and 
present  Negation  and  verifies  the  compatibility  between  pre-and  post-foundation 
bases with different personal pronouns By cons although the average conjugation 
fault  detection  our  system  provides  a  new  paradigm  as  it  has  treated  the  most 
difficult  
in the Arabic language is the conjugation

5 Conclusion and Perspectives 
The information retrieval and text mining in Arabic is a major challenge We are 
interested  in  this  work  to  develop  an  application  to  detect  errors  in  spelling 
structure and conjugation in the Arabic text 
The development of this project allowed us to familiarize ourselves with the Java 
language  a  language  in  the  promising  field  of  programming  technologies It 
allowed  us  to  consolidate  our  knowledge  on  various  techniques  including 
manipulation of XML 
The  work  we  have  done  is  a  response  to  the  objectives  set  at  the  outset  of  the 
project However it can evolve by considering several extension elements 
We can consider adding propositions for the wrong words in order to improve the 
performance of our system We can also add more functionality to our tool such as 
translating the input text from one language to another following the users choice 
We can also handle the case semantics and the texts vowels
