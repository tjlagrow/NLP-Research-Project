Abstract We extend the time dependent bias model of Tegmark  Peebles 1998 to predict the large-scale
evolution of the stochastic linear bias of dierent galaxy populations with respect to both the dark matter and each
other The resulting model equations contain a general expression coined the interaction term accounting for
the destruction or production of galaxies This term may be used to model couplings between dierent populations
that lead to an increase or decrease of the number of a galaxies belonging to a population eg passive evolution
or merging processes This is explored in detail using a toy model In particular it is shown that the presence
of such a coupling may change the evolution of the bias parameter compared to an interaction-free evolution
We argue that the observation of the evolution of the large-scale bias and galaxy number density with wide-eld
surveys may be used to infer fundamental interaction parameters between galaxy populations possibly giving an
insight in their formation and evolution

1 Introduction
The rst studies of large scale structure had to com-
pletely rely on galaxies as mass tracers of the large scale
Universe It became clear that in order to match the clus-
tering statistics of galaxies with models for gravitationally
driven structure formation - in particular with the SCDM
favoured in the early 90s - galaxies cannot be perfect trac-
ers of the overall mass density eld the concept of galaxy
biasing was born eg Bardeen et al 1986 BBKS here-
after Davis et al 1985
The rst bias description was introduced by Kaiser
1984 as a single parameter that rescales the two-point
correlation function 2PCF of the galaxy density eld
to yield the expected 2PCF for matter clustering Such a
rescaling can be achieved if the uctuation eld or density
contrast m  m m  1 of the matter density eld is a
linear function of the galaxy density contrast g  ngng
1 thus b  bm m and ng are the matter and galaxy
number density elds respectively The bar denotes the
mean density A possible reason for the enhancement of
clustering could be that galaxies are preferentially formed
in the peaks of the dark matter eld Kaiser 1984 BBKS
This linear biasing scheme was put in a more gen-
eral framework by Fry  Gaztanaga 1993 who pro-
posed g to be an arbitrary analytic local function of m
local Eulerian biasing opening the door to in prin-
cipal arbitrarily many bias parameters which however
can be measured if higher-order statistics is invoked
Moreover these parameters can be dierent if dierent
smoothing scales of the density elds are considered scale-
dependence of bias An alternative picture to the Eulerian
model is to assume that the galaxy distribution or a part
of it like recently formed galaxies is only a local function
of the dark matter eld at one particular time Lagrangian
bias eg Catelan et al 2000
In order to look at general features of the statistics
of transformed random elds Coles 1993 derived con-
straints for the clustering of galaxies that follow from a
local mapping of a Gaussian eld It was found that on
large scales where clustering is small - even for a non-local
mapping that however preserves the clustering hierarchy
Coles Melott  Munshi 1999 Scherrer  Weinberg 1998
- the shape of the 2PCF of the matter and the galaxies
is identical so that here a simple linear bias scheme may
still be used see also Narayanan Berlind  Weinberg
2000 and Mann Peacock  Heavens 1998
Another degree of freedom had to be inserted into
the biasing schemes once it was realised that the
relation between the matter and the galaxy density
eld is very likely to be a stochastic one Blanton
2000 Tegmark  Bromley 1999 Dekel  Lahav 1999
Matsubara 1999 Cen  Ostriker 1992 due to hidden
parameters of galaxy formationevolution that cannot be
incorporated into a simple picture that involves only the
densities Currently the description for stochastic nonlin-
ear biasing most commonly used is by Dekel  Lahav

Equivalently one can express the bias parameters in
terms of auto- and cross-correlation power
spectra
where g and m are the Fourier transforms of the density

gate1 For the Fourier space denition above the relevant
scale for the bias parameters is dened by the spatial fre-
quency considered whereas in the other denition a scale
is dened by smoothing the elds with a kernel of a cer-
tain size In the case of a strict positive correlation r  1

bias with only one free parameter b

Nowadays in a time of a concordance cosmological
model Spergel et al 2003 cosmic microwave background
and weak gravitational lensing studies provide informa-
tion on the matter distribution almost independent of
the galaxy distribution conrming the original paradigm
of structure formation in particular the CDM model
Conversely this also conrms the early suspicion that
galaxies are not perfect mass tracers Intriguingly in con-
trast to about ten years ago when SCDM was the favoured
cosmological model with CDM almost no bias in the lo-
cal Universe on large scales is required Verde et al 2002
However there is a need for bias on smaller scales scale-
dependent bias because in contrast to that of the dark
matter the 2PCF of the galaxies is a power law over sev-
eral orders of magnitude The exact scale-dependence of
the bias maybe even hold some information on the physics
of galaxy formation eg Benson et al 2000 Blanton et
al 1999
The evolution of bias has also become a matter of inter-
est there is evidence that galaxy clustering is a function of
redshift eg Carlberg et al 2000 Adelberger et al 1998
Le Fevre et al 1996 and even that the galaxy bias is a
decreasing function of redshift eg Blanton et al 2000
Magliocchetti et al 2000 Steidel et al 1998 Wechsler et
al 1998 Matarrese et al 1997

Tegmark  Peebles 1998 hereafter TP98 Fry 1996 here-
after F96 Nusser  Davis 1994 assume that galaxies pas-
sively follow the bulk ow of the dark matter eld which
then can be treated with conventional perturbation the-
ory Halo models Seljak 2000 Peacock  Smith 2000
Sheth  Lemson 1999 Bagla 1998 Catelan et al 1998
Mo  White 1996 on the other hand picture the dark
matter density eld to be made up out of typical haloes
that host galaxies so that the clustering of galaxies is re-
lated to the clustering of their hosts and typical halo prop-
erties Both concepts agree on a debiasing of the galaxy
eld with time but there are dierences in the details
Magliocchetti et al 2000
If one does not look at the galaxy population as a
whole which as noted above seems to trace the local mat-
ter distribution quite well on large scales there are more
interesting features It is also known that dierent types
of galaxies are dierently clustered with respect to each
other and consequently also with respect to the under-
lying dark matter eld eg Phleps  Meisenheimer 2003
and references therein Norberg et al 2002 Blanton et al
2000 At low redshift the correlation length - a measure
for the strength of clustering - is a function of morpho-
logical type and color Tucker et al 1997 Loveday et al
1995 Davis  Geller 1976 and maybe also depend on
the luminosity of the galaxy population Benoist et al
1996 Furthermore there are examples of galaxy popula-
tions whose relative clustering is known to have changed
with time For instance red and blue galaxies were almost
not biased with respect to each other at z  05 Le Fevre
et al 1996 but also see Phleps  Meisenheimer 2003 who
do not observe this bias but today early type galaxies
are more strongly clustered than late types eg Norberg
2002 Baker et al 1998
Thus it makes sense to conceive a model for bias evo-
lution that takes into account several distinct galaxy pop-
ulations

In this paper we extend the test particle model of
TP98 for the stochastic linear parameter evolution and
include several galaxy populations that are allowed to in-
teract with each other The rate of galaxy interaction is
assumed to be a function of all density elds changing
in general the number of members of a particular galaxy
population Treated is also the evolution of the relative
bias of the populations with respect to each other not
only the bias relative to the dark matter eld
Patrick Simon Bias model for interacting galaxies
In detail the second section develops a model based on
the bulk ow hypothesis including a general sinksource
term for galaxies We derive dierential equations for the
auto- and cross-correlation power spectra galaxy-galaxy
galaxy-dark matter valid on scales where the elds are
Gaussian thus on linear scales Sect 23 The equations
are then transformed to obtain dierential equations for
the stochastic linear bias parameters Sect 24 In Sect
3 we focus on linear and quadratic interaction rates and
work out the relevant terms needed for the bias model
equations based on this interaction table 1 We demon-
strate in Sect 4 for a few toy models the eect on the
evolution of the large scale bias in the presence of galaxy
interactions We conclude this paper with a discussion
2 Derivation of the bias model
21 Evolution of density contrasts
Here we derive dierential equations for the density con-
trasts of a set of galaxy species that are assumed to be
perfect velocity tracers meaning that their bulk velocities
are identical to the overall bulk mass ow
It is common practice to express the density elds -
dark matter m and galaxies ni i  1N - in terms of the
their mean density and the uctuation about this mean
the density contrast 
m  m 1  m ni  ni 1  i 
m  hmi and ni  hnii are the corresponding matter
and number density respectively obtained by taking the
volume average Under the usual hydrodynamic conditions
and cosmological assumptions Peebles 1980 the gravi-
tationally driven evolution of the dark matter density and
bulk ow v deviation from the Hubble ow is described
in comoving coordinates by

 H a  
a mv  0
H a  H0pma3  1  m   a2   
  v aH a is related to the curl free component
of the bulk ow On large scales this is the only compo-
nent in contrast to the vorticity that is not suppressed
by structure growth and therefore the only one relevant
for structure formation H a  aa is the Hubble pa-
rameter Solutions to Eqs 4-6 have been extensively
studied in the literature especially using the perturbation
approach eg Bernardeau et al 2001 for a review Goro
et al 1986 and therefore will not be discussed here We
simply assume that the solutions for m and v or  are
approximately known
The central assumption in this and similar models eg
TP98 F96 is that the velocity elds of the galaxies are
identical to that of the dark matter One thereby reduces
the treatment for the galaxy number density solely to the
number conservation equation which for a conserved num-
ber of galaxies looks as Eq 5 TP98
 H a  
a iv  0 
The term H a  can be removed by subtracting Eq 5
arriving at an equation that clearly shows how the galaxies
are coupled to the dark matter eld
a v m  i 
Our main modication consists of dropping the constraint
that the mean number of galaxies - expressed by ni - is
conserved We allow for a sinksource term i in the mass
conservation equation for the galaxy population ni that
incorporates galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-dark matter inter-
actions and is thought to be a function of all the density
elds Note that in this formalism interaction is equivalent
to a change in galaxy number density
In order to include i in Eq 7 and to eventually
obtain a modied formula 8 we have to start with the
number conservation equation for the galaxies plus the
new interaction rate i

Setting i  0 would result again in Eq 8 Substitution
of ni by the denition in 3 yields

For the last step we had to take into account that the
mean galaxy density ni is a function of time Compared to
Eq 7 we obviously have a new term on the right hand
side rhs that has to be cared for Again subtracting
Eq 5 from the last equation gives the time evolution
equation for the density contrasts of the galaxies but this

The terms cid10vmcid11 and cid10vicid11 vanish because the
cid10vcid11  cid10vcid11  cid10vcid11  0
of any species  over the whole volume has to be zero
since we work in the rest frame of the Hubble expansion
In particular Eq 12 has general validity and is not re-
stricted to Gaussian elds only
23 Linear scale evolution of correlation power spectra
We will primarily be interested in the evolution of the
linear stochastic bias which may be expressed in terms of
the cross- and auto-correlation power spectra Therefore
the next logical step is to work out the time dependence of
these power spectra For that reason we take the Fourier
transform

of Eq 11 to obtain the corresponding equation for the
Fourier coecients

where the irrelevant terms at k  0 have been neglected
For convenience we omit the arguments in the brackets
of the Fourier coecients By the asterisk  we denote
the convolution of two elds in Fourier space
cid16 f  gcid17 k 
23Z d3k f k g k  k
that enter when products of elds are Fourier transformed
A tilde    always denotes the Fourier transform of a
random eld or function beneath the tilde
We restrict ourselves to the case of strictly Gaussian
elds which is a reasonable assumption on linear scales
see eg Bernardeau et al 2002 As a consequence all
connected higher order correlation terms like bispectra
vanish which makes the following equations a lot simpler
Further in the cosmological context the density elds are
isotropic and homogeneous random elds
The correlation power spectrum P k between two
homogeneous random eld with the Fourier coecients
1 k and 2 k respectively is
23 D k  k P k cid101 k 
2 kcid11 
stating that homogeneity requires only the Fourier coef-
cients of the same k to be correlated This relation also
states that the power spectrum P k is related to the
correlator in the following way
P k Z d3k
23cid101 k 
2 kcid11 
Due to this relation we are going to use a slightly dierent
denitioncid10cid11
D1 k 
2 kE
of the ensemble average
Z d3k
23cid101 k 
2 kcid11 
which in the following is useful to derive the dierential
equations for the correlation power spectra We also in-
troduce the convention to omit the k arguments for the
correlators and the power spectra Instead we use the fol-
lowing notation Power spectra have as well as the rst
eld in the two-point correlator in the above denition
1 as argument always k whereas the second eld in the
correlator has the argument k For example according to
this convention the following two lines are identical

dom elds by

The terms on the left hand side lhs containing R t are
responsible for driving a biased galaxy distribution to-

24 Linear scale evolution of stochastic linear bias
We dene the bias parameters with one index thus ri and
bi to be the bias of the ith galaxy population with respect
to the dark matter whereas two indices bij and rij  denote
the bias between the ith and jth galaxy population

Using this denition we can write down dierential
equations for bi ri bij rij  based on Eqs 33 and 34

result there is the following set of equations the equation

completeness showing the evolution of the bias parame-
ters for any kind of interaction term i

For the next step we would like to approximate in Eqs

of m is sucient because we have restricted the model to
large linear scales where the cosmological elds may be
considered as Gaussian random elds Considering only

The interaction terms I 1
ij vanish for i  0
they are responsible for deviations from the interaction-
free evolution of the linear bias parameters In Eq 40
we equivalently expressed the interaction rate in terms of
the Fourier representation of i Depending on the def-
inition of i this representation can be mathematically
of advantage especially when derivatives or integrals are
involved
25 Bias evolution without interaction
i  0
t  ri
With no interaction present i  0 the model treats the
same case as in the second section of TP98 Fig 1 shows
a diagram similar to the one in their paper it can be
seen that an initially biased galaxy distribution is more
and more relaxing towards the dark matter distribution
asymptotically closing in to r  1 and b  1 debiasing
That this is indeed a stationary state ie bi
t  0
can be seen from Eqs 36 and 38 for which the only
stationary solutions are bi  ri  1 without interaction
hence I 1
The second solution with bi  ri  1 has to be ex-
cluded because the bias factor is by denition always posi-
tive The only possible way to be attracted by this station-
ary point is that we have ri  1 at all time For all other
values ri  1 the correlation parameter is an increas-
ing function with time inevitably approaching the other
stationary solution This peculiarity is therefore avoided
if we exclude ri  1 as initial condition
The bias between two galaxy populations also has a
stationary solution at bij  bibj  rij  1 This follows
from Eqs 37 and 39 I 2

illustration the evolution of the relative bias between two
galaxy populations while they are getting debiased with

following Ansatz for i namely a Taylor expansion in ni

This particular i is motivated by the idea that locally
the galaxy density may be changed - apart from converg-
ing or diverging bulk ows - by galaxy collisions or merg-
ers with interaction rates proportional to the product of
the density elds involved Drs
i  In addition
we also include all lower order terms like for instance
a constant rate of galaxy production Ai or a rate that is
i and Ci As the non-
linear with some density eld Br
linear quadratic couplings linear couplings may also have
a physical interpretation in this context a galaxy of one
population is with a constant probability - independent
of its environment- transformed into a member of another

not the i but the interaction terms in Eqs 41 Those
are mainly functions of the interaction correlatorsD i

whose evaluation can be found in Appendix

ume in Eq 40 too

where the mean dark matter density m has been absorbed
inside the coupling constants Appendix C Note that
the density contrasts here are in real space For linear
couplings only the evolution of the mean volume density
of galaxies is apparently independent from the way the
galaxies are clustered because then Eq 40 only depends
on ni Quadratic couplings however introduce the terms
likecid10ijcid11 so that the mean density evolution gets linked
to the correlations between i and m and the uctuations
of these elds The meaning of this is that under quadratic
couplings the mean density of highly clustered galaxies
evolves in a dierent way than a completely homogeneous

4 Toy models
In this section we present a few examples to illustrate
the impact of interactions on the evolution of the linear
bias parameters These include the bias of each galaxy
population with respect to both the dark matter and all
other populations For predicting the bias evolution on
large scales we incorporate the model Eqs 36 to 40
Owing to the large number of free parameters and ways
to combine them there are many models to look at To
explore some of them we focus on two galaxy populations
and switch on only one parameter out of Ai  F j
Eq 42 while setting the others to zero This allows us to
look at the eect of the coupling parameters separately
The evolution is plotted in redshift Therefore we have

Our cosmology in the examples stated here is a CDM

Furthermore a scale-invariant n  1 Harrison Zeldovich
spectrum for the primordial uctuations is assumed For
the 3-D power spectrum of the matter uctuations we
use the tting formula of Bardeen et al 1986 for the
transfer function and the Peacock  Dodds 1996 here-
after PD96 description for the evolution in the non-linear
regime The power spectrum normalisation is parame-
terised with 8  09 and the shape parameter assumed
to be   021 the 3-D matter uctuations spectrum is
needed for the quadratic coupling models only

41 Constraints on the correlation parameter
As initial condition one can set the bias parameter bi
freely The relative bias bij between the dierent galaxy
populations is thereby also xed namely bij  bibj
The choice of the initial conditions of the correlation
coecients ri rij  is not free however For example we
cannot demand population A to be 100 percent correlated
to both population B and population C but at the same
time population B to be not correlated to C To be more
general we arrange the density contrasts of the dark mat-
ter and N galaxy elds in terms of one single vector

For three random elds or two galaxy populations
plus the dark matter eld this statement is equivalent

if the denitions of C r1 r2 r12 are used calculation
not shown here It holds for all scales and the large-scale
parameter considered in particular Going back to the ex-
ample above it follows immediately from this equation
that if we x two of the three correlation coecients with
one say r1  r2  1 the third automatically is also forced
to be one Even more general if only one of the correla-
tions is set to one say r1 then the other two have to be
equal since we are told by the above constraint that
r2  r122  0 
Already for four random elds or three galaxy popula-
tions plus the dark matter eld this condition of positive
semi-deniteness becomes rather lengthy

By setting all correlations with the third population to
zero r3  r13  r23  0 one can see that this reduces
to the forgoing inequality 56 Thus the constraint for
three galaxy populations is a more general expression that
simplies to the condition for two populations if one of
the three galaxy populations is not all correlated to the
two others and the dark matter it is in a statistical sense
disconnected from the others
hereafter POPII has bII  2 and rII  0 at z  2 it
is thus initially not correlated to the dark matter The
relative correlation between POPI and POPII we set to
rIII  05 well below maximum possible value of rIII 
087 according to Eq 56 The number density of galaxies
is not constant due to the interaction not plotted
For the scenario MB we assume that POPI is coupled
to POPII such that galaxies are transfered from POPII
to POPI keeping the overall galaxy number unchanged
thus BII

we increase the initial number of POPII galaxies so that

sumed the same initial density for both populations

of the linear bias of two dierent galaxy populations

redshift z  2 a bias factor bI  4 and correlation rI  05

5 Discussion and conclusions
Taking the hypothesis for granted that the bulk ow of
galaxies is identical to the bulk ow of the dark matter
eld we derive a set of dierential equations that describe
the evolution of the two-point correlations between dier-
ent galaxy populations and the dark matter density eld
in terms of correlation power spectra Eqs 33 34 and 12
Patrick Simon Bias model for interacting galaxies
Incorporated into this model is an interaction i that
allows for the destruction or creation of galaxies in this
paper the term interaction is used equivalently to a local
change of the galaxy number density It may have explicit
time dependence
The model is valid only on scales where three point
correlations of all cosmological elds density and velocity
elds are negligible This is fullled on large scales where
the elds are Gaussian due to the initial conditions of
structure formation at high redshifts as seen in the CMB
and due to the fact that the eld evolution is essentially
linear on large scales On small scales this assumption
is denitely wrong because gravitational instability has
been destroying Gaussianity proceeding gradually from
smallest to larger scales The present stage of structure
formation in the local Universe is such that this transition
form linear to non-linear scales occurs at about 10 Mpc
h1 at earlier times this scale was smaller
i  Ci Drs
We closely study an interaction rate i that is a lo-
cal function of the smoothed dark matter density eld
and the galaxy number density elds up to second or-
der within the model the choice of the interaction is
completely free though With this interaction we intro-
duce the coupling constants Ai Br
i  Ei and F r
see Eq 42 Generally this interaction term may be pic-
tured as the Taylor expansion of some complicated inter-
action i nj  m up to second order Nevertheless some
of the terms associated with the coupling constants taken
alone bear a simple interpretation Drs
i may be used to
describe interaction rates of galaxy-galaxy collisions or
mergers Merging is an important process in the currently
favoured CDM Universe eg Lacey  Cole 1993 Linear
couplings between the galaxy elds Br
i  have a physi-
cal analogue as well they describe processes that trans-
fer a certain fraction of one galaxy population to another
population per volume and time making the local cre-
ationdestruction rate of galaxies proportional to the local
density of the other population passive evolution A con-
stant productiondestruction rate of galaxies Ai is just a
special case as it acts like a linear coupling to a completely
homogeneous eld of galaxies
The 2nd order couplings between dark matter and galaxy
elds Ei and F r
i  and the linear coupling between dark
matter and galaxies Ci may be used for instance to de-
scribe formation processes that directly require the pres-
ence of dark matter overdensities albeit the interpretation
of these terms alone is less clear At least one can say that
linear couplings to the dark matter eld produce galax-
ies that are not biased with respect to the dark matter
while a quadratic coupling makes relatively more galaxies
in overdensity regions
General descriptions of a local stochastic bias like the
one from Dekel  Lahav 1999 are based on the joint
pdf of the smoothed density contrasts of the considered
elds Therefore - however the dened bias parameters
may look like - they have to be function of the cumulants
iN cid11c of this pdf so that these are the basic quan-
tities that should be examined Due to the Gaussianity of
i1 nN
cid10n1
the elds on linear scales only the second order cumulants
are non-vanishing and hence only the stochastic linear bias
parameters in 2 are relevant the rst order cumulants
vanish according to the denition of the density contrasts
Their evolution is described by means of Eqs 36 to 40
Table 1 lists the interaction terms based on the interac-
tion correlators for the 2nd order Taylor expansion of i
Our model distinguishes between the linear bias bi ri of
a galaxy population with respect to the dark matter eld
and the linear bias bij rij  between two galaxy popula-
tions The bias factor b can be pictured as the ratio of
the clustering strengths of the two elds whereas the cor-
relation parameter r measures how strongly the peaks
and valleys of the density elds coincide Note however
that also a possible non-linearity in the relation between
i and j aects the correlation parameter Dekel  Lahav
1999 On the large smoothing scales considered by this
paper this is neglectable though
For all elds perfectly correlated to the dark matter
eld thus ri  rij  1 the interaction terms I 2
i and I 3
always vanish and therefore all correlations ri rij  are
frozen in according to Eqs 38 and 39 In that case
the model reduces basically to Eq 36 and 40 with all
correlations set to one bij  bibj
 R t

icid12cid12ririj 1 
The bias bi is then called deterministic since there is no
randomness in the relationship of the local density con-
trasts For highly correlated elds this can be a good ap-
proximation
With no interaction present Sect 25 we obtain as
TP98 and others a debiasing of an initially biased galaxy
eld this makes the galaxy distribution looking more and
more like the distribution of the underlying dark matter
distribution Figs 1 The bias factor bi  1 of a galaxy
population that is less correlated to the dark matter eld
declines faster than a more correlated population Fig 2
The gure also demonstrates that dierently correlated
galaxy populations can temporarily evolve a relative bias
factor bij 6 1 with respect to each other even though they
may have had bij  1 at some time and they are not in-
teracting with each other Moreover characteristic for an
only slightly correlated population ri  1 is an over-
shoot that makes the population antibiased ie bi  1
after some time Later on the bias factor increases again
thereby producing a relative minimum in bi This mini-
mum is clearly seen in Fig 2 according to Eq 36 it has
to occur at the time where ri  bi because bi
t vanishes
there On the other hand this means that a possible local
minimum of bi always has to be smaller than one since
ri  1 In the absence of any interaction the relative cor-
relation is a monotonic always increasing function this is
due to the rhs of Eq 38 which always has a positive sign
as long as R t  0

than the eld of the galaxies II In case of the formation
of galaxies I positive sign in I  this enriches the pop-
ulation I with new galaxies having the same correlations
as the galaxies in eld II Therefore the bias factor be-
tween I and II is being reduced while their correlation
is being increased A positive linear coupling to the dark
matter eld hence debiases a galaxy eld quicker than
without interaction like the populations POPI and POPII
in scenario MC The linear coupling of POPII to POPI
literally drags the population POPI towards POPII as
can be seen in MBI while POPII MBII even though
loosing galaxies shows the same behaviour as without in-
teraction in M0II this is because it is linearly coupled
to itself The interaction Ai creates or destroys galaxies
depending on the sign with the same rate everywhere
this can be pictured as a linear coupling to an absolutely
homogeneous uctuation free eld having b  0 with
respect to any other eld I 0
i in table 1 indeed re-
duces up to a constant to the I 0
i for Ai if we set bj  0 It
is therefore not surprising that a constant production of
galaxies pulls the bias towards zero see MAI and MAII
more and more suppressing the density uctuations
i for Bj
In conclusion a linear coupling of a eld II to eld
I only inuences the bias evolution of I if II is bi-
ased with regard to I In particular a new population
I being created solely from a linear coupling to some
other population II can never become biased with re-
spect to II Early type galaxies that may be formed
from spiral galaxies can therefore not be produced by a
linear coupling to the spiral galaxy eld if they are biased
with respect to spirals as observations imply Norberg et
al 2002 The fact that values for   06
m b derived from
the IRAS preferentially spiral galaxies and the ORS op-
tically selected galaxies are consistent if a relative bias of
bORSbIRAS  14 is assumed Baker et al 1998 also im-
plies a bias between spirals and ellipticals on large scales
If this is the case then following the above arguments
ellipticals cannot simply be passively evolved spirals
Quadratic interactions physically interpreted as colli-
sions or mergers could do the job however The reason
is that the eld of newly formed or recently destroyed
galaxies of type I coupled quadratically to II is pro-
portional to n2
II  These galaxies have therefore the bias
factor of n2

to model the distribution of point like galaxies as a continuum

the real space elds entering i like for instance ni and
nj in i  ninj This scale is determined by the physical
process underlying the interaction and therefore lies pre-
sumably deep in the non-linear regime Why are these ad-
ditional parameters needed for quadratic couplings This
can be seen by the following argument One could think of
the whole model volume being subdivided into small cu-
bic cells with side length Rint a cell contains Ni  niR3
particles ni Roughly speaking the model predicts the
evolution of the correlations between the particle num-
bers Ni of cells which are far apart large scale and the
mean number of particlescid10Nicid11 inside the cells taking into
account the gravitational eld of the dark matter its in-
creasing clustering and the background cosmology The
interaction term i changes the number of galaxies Ni
inside a particular cell depending on the number of galax-
ies andor dark matter mass present in the same cell by
dNi  R3
intidt For linear couplings i  nj the size
of these cells does not have an impact oncid10 Nicid11 and thus
cid10 nicid11 sincecid10icid11 depends only on the total number of par-
ticles of all cells hence Rint does not turn up in the model
Eq 40 For non-linear couplings however the mean in-
teraction rate indeed depends on how the particles are
distributed among the cells which is expressed by b
To be able to explore a toy model including quadratic
couplings we made the assumption that the small-scale
bias parameters are identical to the bias parameters on
large scales we hence assumed no scale-dependence for
the linear bias In fact this is not what is expected
The terms containing elements of b only have an im-
mcid11  1 see Eq

45 and if the correlationscid12cid12cid12 dbibjrijcid12cid12cid12 andcid12cid12cid12dbirjcid12cid12cid12 are signi-
cantly dierent from zero The strength of these terms can
change the evolution of the linear bias completely as can
be seen in Fig 7 There galaxies of a population I POPI
are created by the collisionmerger of galaxies of another
population II POPII The dierence between the mod-
mcid11
els MX and MY is that the former switches o thecid102
terms while the other takes them into account Both sce-
narios predict the emergence of a bias of POPI relative
to POPII at z  0 However in MX we nally at z  0
have bI  bII while in MY we have bI  bII  This demon-
strates that for 2nd order interactions the evolution of
the mean densities depends strongly on the homogeneity
of the soup of the interacting populations The mean
density of a completely homogeneous mixture of galaxies
evolves slower than for a mixture of galaxies with some
substructureclustering if the interacting populations are
highly correlated Fig 6 for an illustration Therefore to
predict the bias evolution in the context of quadratic in-
teractions the knowledge of bothcid102
bias may be crucial
mcid11 and the small-scale
Fitting the model presented in this paper to observed
large-scale bias parameters with the intention to look for
quadratic couplings states therefore a practical problem
the weighted bias b andcid102
mcid11 are required The weighted
bias parameters b however are beyond the scope of the
model of this paper since the model is valid only on large
scales However the knowledge of b is only needed for
the mean density evolution see Eq 40 In practice both
the bias parameter and the galaxy number densities are
at least principally an observable Therefore this problem
may be disarmed by directly estimating ni andcid10icid11   ni
through for instance tting generic functions to the ob-
served mean galaxy number density polynomials for ex-
ample An estimate of the number density4 however re-
quires the knowledge of the galaxy luminosity function at
dierent redshifts for every preferred galaxy population
which is a formidable task- but not impossible Bell et al
2004 Measuring the scale-dependence of the bias param-
eters eg Hoekstra et al 2002 H02 is here another op-
tion The bias at and about the scale of maximum weight
w k see Eq 47 could be used as an estimate for b which
then is inserted as a constraint into the tting procedure
for the large-scale biascid102

sities are comoving mean densities which for number conserved
populations is constant for all time
Patrick Simon Bias model for interacting galaxies
Compared to TP98 we did not include a random com-
ponent for the galaxy formation their Sect 3 the pro-
ductiondestruction of galaxies is always a deterministic
function of the density elds However such an random
element could by included by a coupling to an additional
eld that is only weakly or not all correlated to the dark
matter eld The eect of this is that a galaxy population
gets more and more polluted by newly formed galaxies
that are not or only weakly correlated to the dark matter
Thereby the relaxation to the dark matter eld gets re-
tarded or even reverted This scenario has a physical anal-
ogy if one imagines the newly formed galaxies as a con-
densate from a baryonic matter eld at places of high den-
sity but low temperature in order to meet the Jeans crite-
rion for self-collapse White  Frenk 1991 White  Rees
1978 At early time these places were inside dark matter
haloes massive enough to attract the appropriate amount
of baryonic matter and to let it cool eciently thus at po-
sitions highly correlated to the peaks of the dark matter
density eld Later on however the intergalactic medium
probably got too hot inside the haloes to form galaxies
so that the formation of galaxies may have been shifted
outside the highest density peaks Consequently the for-
mation sites of later formed galaxies maybe have not been
as much correlated to the dark matter eld as the sites
of the galaxies made earlier on Blanton et al 1999 The
construction of Appendix D may be used to mimic the
behaviour of this baryonic eld
The practical application of this or similar models may
be to work out the relation between galaxy populations
in terms of fundamental coupling constants attached to
the galaxies based on observations of the bias evolution
This parameters may help to disentangle the zoo of galaxy
types and to reconstruct evolutionary paths Such obser-
vations could be extracted for instance from weak grav-
itational lensing surveys H02 or from the redshift space
distortion in galaxy redshift surveys Pen 1998 In order
to recover the redshift evolution of the bias it is however
necessary to subdivide the data set into redshift bins and
even further into galaxy population bins Considering that
recent works H02 focus on the bias of the galaxies on the
whole at one average redshift it is clear that this cannot
be done with currently available data

For Gaussian elds the bispectrum vanishes so that on
linear scales contributions from these correlators can be

Where possible we absorb for convenience all m inside
the associated coupling constant removing the previously

m is supposed to be a constant and therefore produces in
this formalism a degeneracy between m and its associated

Appendix D Fields with constant bias
Here we consider a new class of density elds - static elds
- that may serve as a model source for producing galaxies
Their dierence to the already described elds i in Sect
2 is that they are supposed to have a constant bias with
respect to the dark matter for all time they are therefore
some sort of random component  as in TP98 They are
introduced therein in order to serve as a source for creating
new galaxies with a certain xed bias at the time of there
formation In contrast to the random component in TP98
the static elds here do not necessarily have to be totally
uncorrelated to the dark matter eld and do not have to
be coupled linearly only hence the static elds are a bit
more general
As we force this class of elds to have a constant bias
relative to the dark matter they certainly do not obey
Eq 15 and hence have to be treated dierently com-
pared to the common galaxy elds As before we restrict
ourselves to the linear regime To avoid confusion with the
already studied elds we use Greek letters as indices like
for example  and  for its Fourier coecients
Demanding the linear bias parameter b and r to be
constant immediately xes the equations for the correla-
tion power spectra P and P by virtue of the denition
P

The cross-correlation of  with one of the conventional
galaxy number density elds i Sect 2 is not equally
obvious to the eye Since the bias relative to the dark
matter stays constant we know that uctuations of the
static elds have to grow with the same rate as the dark
matter uctuations

where R t is the rate of structure growth on linear scales

the here introduced static elds since it trivially stays
unbiased with respect to itself all the time
