Abstract
Experiments show that cellular uptake of nanoparticles via receptor-mediated endocytosis
strongly depends on nanoparticle size There is an optimal size approximately 50 nm in diam-
eter at which cellular uptake is the highest In addition there is a maximum size approximately
200 nm beyond which uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis does not occur By comparing
results from dierent experiments we found that these sizes weakly depend on the type of cells
nanoparticles and ligands used in the experiments Here we argue that these observations are
consequences of the energetics and assembly dynamics of the protein coat that forms on the cy-
toplasmic side of the outer cell membrane during receptor-mediated endocytosis Specically we
show that the energetics of coat formation imposes an upper bound on the size of the nanoparti-
cles that can be internalized whereas the nanoparticle-size-dependent dynamics of coat assembly
results in the optimal nanoparticle size The weak dependence of the optimal and maximum sizes
on cell-nanoparticle-ligand type also follows naturally from our analysis

INTRODUCTION
In recent years there has been great interest in using nanoparticles NPs for various
biomedical applications including imaging biosensing and targeted genedrug delivery see
review articles 13 and references therein Successful realization of these applications
requires ecient cellular uptake of the NPs To this end the NPs are coated with ligands
that allow them to bind to specic cell surface receptors and be internalized via receptor-
mediated endocytosis An understanding of how the physical properties of NPs like their
size shape charge etc aect the internalization process is crucial for designing NPs for
biomedical purposes
Experiments show that the NP size is an important parameter that determines the mech-
anism of their cellular uptake In particular NPs smaller than approximately 200 nm are
internalized typically via receptor-mediated endocytosis whereas for larger NPs other mech-
anisms are involved 4 5 Furthermore the uptake rate of the NPs that are internalized
via receptor-mediated endocytosis is strongly size dependent There is an optimal NP size
approximately 50 nm in diameter at which the uptake rate is highest 411 In Table I we
collected data from various experiments designed to study size dependence of NP uptake
The experiments were performed using dierent kinds of cell lines NPs and ligands yet the
optimal size was found to be approximately the same This surprising observation suggests
that the optimal size weakly depends on the above mentioned factors
Several theoretical models of receptor-mediated endocytosis of NPs have been proposed
in the literature 1216 A common feature of these models is that they assume the uptake
is controlled by the formation of chemical bonds between receptors on the cell surface and
ligands attached to the NP Using such an approach these studies conclude that the optimal
NP size is a function of the receptor density on the cell membrane ligand density on the NP
and the receptor-ligand binding energy These parameters however can change signicantly
depending on the cell line and ligands used in the experiment Therefore in the framework of
these models it is dicult to explain the same optimal size observed in dierent experiments
Furthermore such an approach leads to the prediction that even micron sized NPs can
be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis 12 13 which has never been observed
experimentally
Along with the formation of chemical bonds between the NP ligands and cell surface
receptors receptor-mediated endocytosis involves the assembly of a protein coat on the
cytoplasmic side of the outer cell membrane
In the case of clathrin-mediated endocyto-
sis - which is a form of receptor-mediated endocytosis - the coat contains several proteins
including clathrin adaptor proteins membrane bending proteins like epsin amphiphysin
etc17 18 The coat assembly plays a vital role in internalization of cargo and any inter-
ference with this process drastically reduces the endocytic capacity of a cell For example
cellular uptake of NPs is signicantly reduced when the cells are pretreated with sucrose or
potassium-depleted medium 4 19 which are known to disrupt coat formation The above
mentioned models do not take the coat assembly into explicit consideration Therefore how
this key aspect of the cellular endocytic machinery aects the uptake of NPs remains to be
elucidated
In this paper we make a step in this direction Our main purpose is to demonstrate
that contrary to the current understanding the size-dependence of cellular uptake of NPs
is determined by the coat assembly To do so we use a previously developed coarse-grained
model of the coat assembly that focuses on vesicle formation during clathrin-mediated endo-
cytosis 20 The model was developed to explain the fates and lifetimes of clathrin coated

pits CCPs here we use it to study the size dependence of NP uptake In particular we cal-
culate the dependence of the NP internalization probability and the internalization time on
the NP size Our results show that the above-mentioned experimental observations namely
1 the optimal NP size 2 an upper bound on the size of NPs that can be internalized and
3 the weak dependence of these sizes on type of cells NPs and ligands used in dierent
experiments can be understood to be the consequence of the dynamics of coat assembly
This is the main result of our work
We start by describing the main steps involved in NP internalization via clathrin-mediated
endocytosis During clathrin-mediated endocytosis a ligand-coated NP rst binds to a spe-
cic receptor on the surface of the cell membrane see Fig 1 After binding the NP-receptor
complex binds adaptor proteins typically AP-2 which recruit other endocytic proteins and
clathrin-coated pit CCP assembly begins CCP assembly is a stochastic process which has
two possible nal outcomes 21 22 One is that the CCP grows in size and forms a vesi-
cle in which case the NP is completely wrapped and internalized The other possibility
is that the CCP grows only up to a certain size and then disassembles

FIG 1 Schematic diagram of NP internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis A NP rst
binds to a specic cell surface receptor forming a NP-receptor complex The complex binds the
coat proteins and CCP assembly begins The CCP either grows to form a vesicle in which case
the NP is internalized or grows only up to a certain size and then disassembles
NP-receptor complex becomes free of coat proteins and the assembly process starts once
again We assume that the binding of a NP to the cell membrane is irreversible and that
the dissociation of the NP-receptor complex may be neglected We discuss the restrictions
of this assumption below
Quantifying internalization eciency
Similar to other approaches 12 15 we characterize the NP internalization eciency by
the mean internalization time   dened as the mean time between the binding of a NP to
the membrane and its internalization As shown in Appendix A
  w  0  Pf f Pw
where 0 is the mean time required for the initiation of CCP assembly around a free NP-
receptor complex Pw and Pf  1Pw denote the probabilities of successful and unsuccessful
wrapping of a NP and w and f denote the mean durations of these processes Here w
and f indicate successful and failed wrapping of the NP respectively Our assumption that
the NP-receptor dissociation may be neglected is valid if Pw is not too small Otherwise 
becomes very large and the dissociation of the complex should be taken into consideration
In order to calculate the quantities appearing in Eq 1 we use the model of CCP assembly
developed in Ref 20 Here we briey describe the model and list the underlying assumptions
As mentioned earlier the coat that forms during CCP assembly contains several proteins
and has a complex structure Proteins like epsin and amphyphysin bind directly to the cell
membrane and impart a local curvature whereas clathrin triskelions three-legged pinwheel-
wheel shaped complexes bind with other clathrin triskelions to form a three-dimensional
scaold which is linked to the membrane through the adaptor proteins typically AP-2
The clathrin scaold imparts global curvature to the cell membrane
Incorporating this
complex structure of the coat into a model is an extremely complicated task To overcome
this diculty in Ref 20 we proposed a coarse-grained description of CCP assembly The
main idea was to replace the real protein coat by a coat made up of identical units referred
to as monomers Fig 2 We assumed that 1 the coat made up of monomers has its own
bending rigidity and a spontaneous curvature 2 the shape of the model CCP pit is a
spherical cap 3 the monomers are structureless which means that at the time of binding
the orientation of a monomer is not important Due to these assumptions certain details of
CCP assembly were lost but this is the price we had to pay for a tractable model which
still contained the essential features of the assembly process We validated this model by
showing that it was capable of explaining the experimentally measured lifetime distribution
of CCPs 20 Similar coarse-grained approaches for modeling the protein coat have been
used in Refs 23 and 24 for studying endocytic vesicle formation in yeast and COP vesicle
formation in the Golgi respectively

FIG 2 Coarse-grained model of a clathrin-coated pit CCP In a real CCP the protein coat
contains clathrin and several other proteins The model coat is made of identical monomeric units
The shape of the model CCP is assumed to be a spherical cap and the average area of a monomer
is chosen to be the same as that occupied by a clathrin triskelion in a real CCP
Using the coarse-grained model of CCP discussed above the dynamics of CCP assembly
around a NP-receptor complex can be described by the kinetic scheme shown in Fig 3 In
this kinetic scheme the symbol n is the number of monomers in a pit that forms around the
NP-receptor complex and N is the number of monomers needed for a complete vesicle N
is related to the NP diameter dN P by the relationship
N  dN P  2lb2
where lb is the typical length of the receptor-ligand bond between the NP and the cell
  
FIG 3 Kinetic scheme of pit assembly Symbols n and N refer to the number of monomers in
a pit and a vesicle respectively The rate constants n and n characterize the growth and decay
rates of a pit of size n k0 is the rate at which the rst monomer binds to the NP-receptor complex
and kN is the rate of scission of a vesicle from the membrane
membrane and  is the average area occupied by a monomer The rate constants n and
n characterize the growth and decay rates of a pit of size n k0  10 is the rate constant
for binding of the rst monomer to the NP-receptor complex and kN is the rate constant
for the scission of a vesicle from the membrane We assume that the forward and backward
rate constants are related through detailed balance
n  n1 exp F n  F n  1 n  2 3 N
where F n  F nkBT  F n is the formation free energy for a pit containing n
monomeric units kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature
We choose the forward rate constants to be of the form n  f n N n  1 2  N 1
where  is a kinetic parameter proportional to the product of the free monomers concentra-
tion and the bimolecular association rate constant between a free monomer and a pit The
function f n N gives the number of available binding sites on the edge of a pit of size n
Using that the shape of a pit is a spherical cap this function can be written as
where  is a dimensionless parameter see Appendix B

In terms of the kinetic scheme in Fig 3 the quantities Pw and Pf see Eq 1 are the
probabilities that a random walk starting from site n  1 eventually reaches sites n  N

which formally are conditional mean rst-passage times 25 26 Analytical expressions
for these quantities are well known 25

Free energy of pit formation
The free energy of pit formation can be written as 20 24 see details in Appendix C
F n N  ENn  pnN  nN
The free energy is mainly dominated by the rst term ENn which is proportional to the
number of monomers in the pit It includes the costs of the membrane and protein coat
distortions entropic cost of immobilizing the monomers and the binding energy gained due
to coat formation The second term is the line tension energy with  being the edge-energy
constant We use a Helfrich type expression 27 for the membrane and coat distortion
energy and assume that the spontaneous curvature of the cell membrane is zero and that of
the coat is nite In addition we assume that the binding energy and the entropic cost of
immobilizing the monomers are proportional to the number of monomers in the pit Based
on these assumptions we get
N  1 s N
 b 
where m and p are the bending rigidities of the cell membrane and the coat respectively
Np is the natural number of monomers in the coat - which is determined by the intrinsic
coat curvature and b is the eective monomer binding energy ie the dierence between
the binding energy and entropic cost
Parameter values
The values of the parameters used in our calculation are summarized in Table II These
values except for b are identical to those in Ref 20 The rationale behind the choices is
as follows The value of m typically lies between 10-25 kBT 28 we choose m  20 kB T 
In vitro clathrin triskelions assemble into baskets of dierent sizes The size distribution of
baskets is typically narrow and has a peak close to dp  90 nm in diameter 29 Using the
average area occupied by a clathrin molecule   310 nm2 and the relation Np  d2
we nd that a 90 nm basket would have approximately 80 clathrin triskelions So we choose
the natural coat size to be Np  80 The value of   310 nm2 was estimated using the
relation between diameters of clathrin baskets of dierent sizes and the number of clathrin

cargo present case the binding energy increases An approximate range for its value can
be determined using the following argument
for a clathrin-coated vesicle to be energet-

probability of monomer dissociation As a consequence the wrapping time is determined by
the rate of arrival of a new monomer For NPs larger than d
w up to approximately 85 nm
the inequality nn  1 holds true but the number of monomers needed to wrap a NP
increases As a consequence the wrapping time increases with NP size For NPs larger than
85 nm the dissociation of monomers becomes more frequent which causes the wrapping
time to increase drastically For NPs smaller than d
w the free energy EN rises sharply
and therefore the rate constants n and n become comparable Thus even though the
number of monomers needed to wrap a NP decreases the wrapping time increases due to
frequent dissociation of the monomers The mean time of failed attempts f  given in Eq 7
shows a trend very similar to that of w but its values are almost an order of magnitude
smaller
In Fig 5 we show the mean internalization time   calculated using Eq 1 with 0  20 sec
The mean internalization time includes the mean wrapping time w and the mean time
spent by the NP in failed attempts In the region where Pw is high and almost constant
see Fig 4 we nd Pww  Pf f  Equation 1 then simplies to   0Pw  w and
 is just the mean wrapping time w shifted by a constant 0Pw When dN P is close
to dmin or dmax Pw drops sharply and therefore  increases more rapidly than w The
mean internalization time has a minimum at dopt which corresponds to the NP size at
which the cellular uptake of the NPs is the fastest Our analysis predicts dopt  55 nm
which is close to the optimal NP size observed in dierent experiments see Table 1 In
the case of NPs the size dependence of internalization times at a single NP level has never
been measured therefore a direct comparison of our results with with experimental data is
not possible However internalization times of some viruses and virus-like particles entering
into cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis have been measured to be in the range 50-400 sec
21 32 35 36 which agrees with our analysis
Finally we look at sensitivity of our results to variations in coat parameter values In
Fig 6 we show plots of dmin dmax dopt and d
E as functions of the parameters p b and
Np The dependence of the optimal size dopt on the coat parameters has been determined
numerically while other dependences are are given by Eqs 10 and 11 Only the maximum
NP size dmax shows appreciable variation the other quantities show weak dependences on
the coat parameters This demonstrates that our main results are stable with respect to
small variations in the coat parameters around their chosen values

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this study we investigated how the assembly of the protein coat on the cytoplasmic
side of the plasma membrane aects the cellular uptake of NPs To address this question we
have used a previously developed model of clathrin-coated vesicle formation We have used
the mean internalization time of a NP   as the measure of its internalization eciency and
calculated the dependence of  on the NP size We found that the NP size has lower and
upper boundaries dmin and dmax at which the internalization time becomes very large ie
beyond these sizes internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis is highly improbable
We also found that there is an optimal NP size dopt at which the internalization time is a
minimum All these sizes are determined by the parameters of the coat assembly process
As described earlier dopt is determined by the dynamics of coat assembly Since the coat
parameters do not change appreciably between dierent cells and are also independent of
the details of the NP design an explanation for why the same optimal size was observed
in dierent experiments see Table I follows naturally from our analysis In contrast this
observation is dicult to rationalize using previous models which predict that optimal size
depends on the ligand density on the NP the density of the corresponding receptors on the
cell membrane and the receptor-ligand binding energy 1214 since these parameters can
vary signicantly depending on the cell line and ligand used in the experiment
Our calculation of the smallest NP size dmin  46 nm is based on the assumption that
the size of the NP is related to the size of its carrier vesicle through dmin
V  dmin  2lb which
gives dmin
 76 nm In principle however NPs with diameter slightly smaller than dmin
can be internalized in a vesicle of size dmin
 Also it has been shown that NPs much smaller
than dmin can be internalized in clusters multiple particles per vesicle in a vesicle of size
much larger than the size of individual NPs 19 Therefore a comparison of dmin with
experimental data is meaningless In this case it is more meaningful to compare dmin
the size of the smallest clathrin-coated vesicles Experimentally observed size of smallest
clathrin-coated vesicles is approximately 70 nm in diameter 37 which agrees very well with
our estimate
Our estimate of the largest NP size dmax  105 nm and the size of its carrier vesicle
 105  30  135 nm are smaller than their corresponding experimentally measured
values 200 nm 4 5 and 200 nm 37 respectively As shown in Fig 6 the value of dmax
is sensitive to the coat parameter values By changing their values slightly we can get
dmax close to experimentally observed values while keeping dopt the same For example for
p  150kB T and b  12kBT  we get dmax  140 nm dmax
V  170 nm dmin  40 nm and
dopt  50 nm However in this paper our aim is not to match the dierent sizes precisely
but rather to see the extent to which our previously developed model can explain the size
dependence of NP uptake without changing the parameter values Considering the fact that
most of the parameters were determined in a completely dierent context by tting lifetime
distribution of abortive CCPs we think that such a disparity is acceptable As mentioned
earlier other models that do not take coat assembly into consideration incorrectly predict
that very large micron size NPs can be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis
12 13
Although in our model the density of ligands on a NP the receptor density on the cell
membrane and the receptor-ligand binding energy do not appear explicitly these factors do
enter our model implicitly For example our initial assumption that the dissociation of the
NP from the membrane can be neglected would hold true only if either the receptor-ligand
binding energy is strong or the ligand and receptor densities are large enough so that a NP
quickly attaches to the cell membrane by multiple receptor-ligand bonds Multiple bonds
lead to an increased lifetime of NPs on the cell membrane 38 39 Also it has been shown
that CCP assembly is triggered when there is receptor clustering 40 which for our model
implies that a few receptor-ligand bonds probably have to form before the rst monomer
can arrive Thus the time 0 might be aected by the above mentioned parameters
Experimentally the question of how the ligand density on a NP and receptor density on
cell membrane aect cellular uptake is not clearly understood It has been observed that
increasing the ligand density increases cellular uptake due to an enhanced residence time of
the NP on the cell membrane and not due to an increase in the internalization rate 38 This
observation is consistent with our hypothesis that the internalization time is determined by
the kinetics of coat assembly The overall picture of NP internalization proposed in our model
can be tested experimentally with total internal reection uorescence TIRF microscopy
Using dual color TIRF where both NPs and CCPs are uorescent uptake of NPs at a single
particle level can be monitored This will allow simultaneous measurements of 0 w and
To conclude we show that several experimental observations related to size dependent
cellular uptake of NPs including the optimal NP size can be understood to be consequences
of the protein coat assembly process Therefore future eorts on modeling endocytosis of
NPs and designing NPs for biomedical applications must take the eect of the protein coat
assembly explicitly into consideration
APPENDICIES
Appendix A Mean internalization time 
Here we derive the expression for the mean internalization time  given in Eq 1 This
time is dened as the average time between the NP binding to the cell membrane and its
internalization assuming that the binding is irreversible Consider an ensemble of NP-
receptor complexes formed on the cell membrane at time t  0 The mean internalization
time  can be written as
  Pw0  w  Pf Pw20  f  w  P 2
f Pw30  2f  w  
The rst term in right hand side of this equality is the contribution from the fraction Pw of
complexes which are internalized on the rst attempt ie the complexes which bind to coat
protein and get internalized The second term is the contribution from the fraction Pf Pw
of complexes that are internalized on the second attempt ie they bind to coat proteins
dissociate from them bind to coat protein for the second time and then get internalized
Subsequent terms can be understood in the same way Upon summing the series we obtain
This expression for the mean internalization time  can be written in the form given in Eq 1

Appendix B Derivation of f n in Eq 4
Using spherical coordinates see Fig7 the surface area of the pit can be written as
A  2R21  cos  n
where R is the radius of a sphere having the same curvature as the pit This leads to the
relation between cos and the number of monomers n in the pit
cos  1

From the above equation we thus infer that the radius rn of the circular growing edge
of a pit is
rn  R sin  Rp1  cos1  cos scid18n

Introducing the average linear span of the monomer denoted by L we nd that the number
of available binding sites on the periphery of the pit is
