Abstract We highlight some results from disk galaxy evolution models
conceived within a cosmological context When disk mergers and strong
disk-halo feedback are omitted several properties and correlations of disk
galaxies seem to be related to initial conditions given by the CDM model
Motivation The ination-inspired cold dark matter CDM hierarchical
model has provided an invaluable theoretical framework for studies on galaxy
formation and evolution Nevertheless several aspects of this phenomenon can
not be treated as a simple deductive extrapolation of the hierarchical scenario
as is commonly done in some approaches We have developed an approach where
an inductive backward disk galaxy evolution model is combined with initial
and boundary conditions calculated from the hierarchical scenario Our main
goal is to nd the relevant initial factors and physical ingredients that determine
the main local and global properties correlations and evolutionary features of
disk galaxies In our approach Avila-Reese et al 1998 Avila-Reese  Firmani
2000a Firmani  Avila-Reese 2000 disks form inside-out within growing CDM
halos with a gentle gas accretion rate no mergers proportional to the hierarchi-
cal mass aggregation rate We follow locally the overall evolution of individual
disks in centrifugal equilibrium including self-regulated star formation SF by
feedback within the disk ISM no disk-halo feedback and population synthesis
Bulges are assumed to form via a secular mechanism At the same time as in
the semianalytical approach we are able to predict correlations and statistical
properties of the disk galaxy population
 The disk Hubble sequence We nd that the main properties and
correlations of disk galaxy models are mainly determined by the cosmological
conditions For a given mass the dark halo concentration the galaxy color index
and the disk gas fraction are basically related to the mass aggregation history
MAH while the disk surface brightness SB the bulge-to-disk ratio bd
and the shape of the rotation curve depend mainly on the spin parameter
 The mass does not inuence intensive properties Thus according to our
models the Hubble sequence is biparametrical the MAH and  being the two
driving physical factors The observational trends across the Hubble sequence
are indeed reproduced the redder and more concentrated is the disk the smaller
is the gas fraction and the larger is the bd ratio The disk mass fraction fd also
inuences the models we constrict its value to 003  fd  008 otherwise the

Tully-Fisher relation TFR of LSB and HSB galaxies would be very dierent
lower limit or the rotation curves would be too peaked upper limit
 Are the infrared TFRs cosmological or not For the popular at
  h  07 CDM cosmology the predicted slope and zero-point of the infrared
TFRs is within the range of observational determinations the agreement being
even better when shallow cores are introduced in the CDM halos In our models
and for the mentioned cosmology the maximum circular velocity increases on
average 20  25 after disk formation which is  2 times less than Steinmetz
 Navarro 1999 reported from their N-bodyhydrodynamic simulations the
angular momentum catastrophe problem This factor of 2 in velocity trans-
lates into a factor of  8 in mass or luminosity explaining why these authors
obtain a TFR zero-point 2 magnitudes fainter than observed The slope of our
modeled TFR  34 is essentially the slope of the halo mass-velocity rela-
tion variations in the disk mass fraction only scarcely aect this slope Since
observations seem to show nally an upper limit of  34 for the slope of the
most infrared TFR Tully  Pierce 1999 a similar slope was also found for
the baryonic TFR de Jong  Bell this volume our result suggest that there
is not room for intermediate astrophysical ingredients like a dependence of SF
eciency or halo gas reheating on mass Regarding the TFR scatter we nd it
to be between 038 and 031 mag for velocities ranking from 70 to 300 kms
We also nd that the LSB and HSB galaxies have roughly the same
TFR although for a given mass the Vmax of LSB galaxies is less than that of
HSB galaxies the disk luminosity is also less since the SF eciency depends
on disk surface density This also explains why the residuals of the TFR do
not correlate strongly with the disk lenghtscale or SB avoiding this way the
interpretation of Courteau  Rix 1997 of large amounts of dark matter in the
inner parts of disk galaxies which is at odds with observations showing the shape
of the rotation curves to correlate with SB for a given luminosity
Some evolutionary features see Avila-Reese  Firmani 2000b The
shape of the SF history SFH in our models depends on the MAH and  SB
For most of the cases this shape has a broad maximum at z  1525 and a fall
towards z  0 by factors 2-4 This factor is  6  10 in the measured global SFH
Then other galaxy populations than disk galaxies had to have contributed in
the past to the global SF rate The Bband luminosity is larger and the galaxy
colors become slightly bluer in the past The disk sizes strongly decrease towards
the past a factor of 2 at z 
 1 wrt z  0 while the SB increases
