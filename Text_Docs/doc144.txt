Abstract
I discuss Chandra X-ray Observatory measurements of cavities in galaxy clusters and their
implications for heating the intracluster gas The emerging paradigm for cooling ows has
important implications for understanding self-regulated galaxy formation
Introduction
Chandra X-ray images of galaxy cluster cores have revealed a wealth of struc-
ture Once thought to be relatively smooth quiescent environments cluster cores are now
known to be dynamically complex regions of the universe Examples of commonly observed
structures include sharp surface brightness edges associated with mergers Markevitch et al
2000 laments associated with cooling or dynamical wakes Fabian et al 2001 and the
topic of this discussion cavities or bubbles created by interactions between radio sources
and the hot gas surrounding them McNamara et al 2000
Properties of Cavities in Clusters
Cavities have been identied in at least a dozen clusters over the past three years
Brzan et al 2004 The archetypes Hydra A McNamara et al 2000 and Perseus
Bhringer et al 1993 Fabian et al 2000 are typical of most systems
twin surface
brightness depressions 10 - 20 kpc in diameter lying at distances of 10 - 30 kpc from the
nucleus of the cD The cavities are devoid of thermal gas at the characteristic temperature of
their surroundings They are lled however with radio-synchrotron emitting particles and
their accompanying magnetic eld The equipartition pressures within the cavities are gen-
erally between 5 - 10 times lower than their surroundings Nulsen et al 2002 Blanton et al
2001 which implies that they are short lived Their ubiquity and and apparently advanced
ages suggest otherwise
Cavity pairs harboring faint radio emission located well beyond their brighter central
radio sources dubbed ghost cavities have been discovered in several clusters eg Fabian
et al 2000 McNamara et al 2001 Propelled by buoyant forces the time required for
these cavities to rise to their current locations can approach  108 yr or several dynamical
timescales The cavities can survive against collapse to such an advanced age only if they are
supported by internal pressure and if they are hydrodynamically stable The source of this
internal pressure is unknown Candidates include a hot dilute thermal plasma a relativistic

gas or magnetic eld The temperature a thermal gas must have in order to support the
cavities against collapse and at the same time elude detection in existing Chandra images
is  15 keV Blanton et al 2001 Nulsen et al 2002 Synchrotron emission limits seem to
preclude magnetic eld as the sole source of internal pressure in the Perseus cavities Fabian
et al 2002 so they probably contain very hot possibly relativistic gas Their relatively
stable congurations must be aided by surface tension in the bubble rims Otherwise the
bubbles would quickly disintegrate by Rayleigh-Taylor forces Soker Blanton  Sarazin
2002 Magnetic elds are a likely source of surface tension De Young 2003
That the temperatures of the rims are as cool or cooler than the ambient gas was per-
haps Chandras most surprising discovery McNamara et al 2000 Nulsen et al 2002
Early theoretical models incorrectly predicted hot rims associated with shock fronts Heinz
Reynolds  Begelman 1998 The cool rims imply that the cavities behave like bubbles
Churazov et al 2001 rising buoyantly at or below the sound speed The cool gas along
the rims was probably lifted by the bubbles from the cooler central regions of the clusters
Nulsen et al 2002 Blanton et al 2001 This general picture has been bolstered by the
recent discovery of sound ripples emanating from the two inner cavities in the Perseus
cluster Fabian et al 2003
Cavity Demographics  Energetics
Cavities have been observed in giant elliptical galaxies such as M84 Finoguenov
 Jones 2001 groups such as HGG 62 and clusters Brzan et al 2004 Their energy
content ranges between pV  1055 erg s- 1 in isolated galaxies and groups to  1059 erg s- 1
in rich clusters their ages range between  107 yr- 108 yr The total energy associated with
the cavities can be four times this number if they are lled with a relativistic gas
Can Magnetic Bubbles Quench Cooling ows
The persistent symptom of the so-called cooling ow problem has been that the
cooling rates exceed the star formation rates by at least an order of magnitude This situation
has changed dramatically in recent years New XMM-Newton and Chandra observations
Peterson et al 2001 have placed limits on cooling to low temperatures that are factors
of 5 - 10 below the old Einstein and Rosat rates This reduction implies that the gas is
being maintained at keV temperatures by a persistent energy source Magnetic bubbles are
a plausible source of this energy
There is growing evidence that bubbles are produced periodically in cooling ow clusters
The older and radially distant ghost cavities in the Perseus cluster Fabian et al 2000 and the
Abell 2597 cluster McNamara et al 2001 were probably created by an earlier generation
of the central radio source The ghost cavities are associated with radio lobes that have since
detached from their jets and have traveled buoyantly to their current locations over the past
 108 yr In the mean time the rejuvenated central radio source has created a new set of
radio-lled cavities near the nucleus These and perhaps other systems launch cavities every
several tens of Myr Coupled with the fact that cD galaxies in cooling ows are radio audible
 70 of the time Burns 1990 the rising bubbles may deposit up to  1061 erg of energy
into the intracluster medium over their lives McNamara et al 2001 This would be enough
energy to impede or quench a moderately sized cooling ow The production rate required
to prevent cooling in the Perseus cluster for example is one bubble pair every  107 yr
Fabian et al 2003
B R McNamara
Bubble production may be able to retard or quench cooling in many systems but appar-
ently not throughout the lives of all systems For example the Abell 1068 cluster harbors
140 M yr- 1 Wise et al 2004 The star formation rate in
moderate cooling at a rate 
its cD galaxy is  70 M yr- 1 To within their uncertainties the cooling and star formation
rates are consistent with each other McNamara et al 2004 and there is no need to appeal
to heating Furthermore Abell 1068 has no cavities its radio source is weak conduction is
too inefcient to prevent cooling and supernovae associated with the starburst are incapable
of quenching the cooling ow Abell 1068 has the qualities of a classical cooling ow at
least at this stage of its life Therefore all cooling ows do not achieve a steady balance
between heating and cooling throughout their lives
Conclusions  Speculations about a New Cooling Flow Paradigm
Cooling ows are usually messy systems Even those in which bubble production is
energetically sufcient to prevent cooling cold gas and young stars abound Cooling to low
temperatures is probably occurring within cD galaxies along laments of cool gas located
near the sites of star formation McNamara et al 2000 Blanton et al 2003 McNamara et
al 2004 The star formation itself often occurs in bursts
The emerging cooling ow paradigm no longer supports the notion of long-term steady
cooling Instead a cooling cycle that fuels repeated episodes of star formation is established
followed by accretion onto the central black hole A radio outburst ensues creating bubbles
that reheat the cooling gas This cycle repeats Thermal conduction may play a critical role
in maintaining the feedback loop Ruszkowski  Begelman 2002 The existence of a trend
between the central X-ray luminosity and cavity energy Brzan et al 2004 suggests that
this process proceeds in a self-regulatory fashion
This primitive sketch of a cooling ow must include the essential physics of self-regulated
galaxy formation In this picture black holes regulate the rate at which bulges form Similar
processes may have been operating during the earliest phases of galaxy formation when the
relationship between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion was established Fer-
erese  Merritt 2000 Gebhardt et al 2000 In addition bubble production is a potential
source of preheating during the construction phases of groups and clusters
