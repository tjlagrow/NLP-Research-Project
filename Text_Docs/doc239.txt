Abstract We present the preliminary results of a two-phases description
of the ISM suited to NB-TSPH models of galaxy formation and evolution
Introduction The interstellar medium ISM of a galaxy is made by at least
four nearly independent gaseous phases i the very cold dense and clumpy
molecular clouds ii the warm neutral gas surrounding the molecular clouds
iii the hot fully ionized tenuous material iv and nally the very hot and
rareed coronal gas expelled by supernova SN explosions Furthermore stars
are observed to preferentially form inside the molecular component The four
phases cannot be properly described by the standard Smooth Particle Hydro-
dynamics SPH which is designed to deal with a one-phase medium Marri 
White 2003 and even more important the whole gas content cannot be used
to evaluate the star formation SF rate To model this complicated situation
with the Padua NB-TSPH code of galaxy formation and evolution Carraro et
al 1998 Merlin  Chiosi 2006 and references we consider and suitably mod-
ify the sticky particles algorithm of Levinson  Roberts 1981 in which the
cold particles are meant to represent self-gravitating clouds of molecular and
neutral hydrogen ie two of the above phases lumped together In brief a hot
gas particle is turned into a cold gas particle if it is cooler than a threshold tem-
perature denser than a threshold density belonging to a convergent ow and
losing thermal energy When a gas particle becomes cold it immediately loses
its SPH properties Therefore it can freely move across the tenuous ISM without
feeling drag forces A cold particle is supposed to be made of two components
of dierent temperature the very cold part corresponding to the molecular
core and the surrounding warm one The evolution of the two components by
thermal instability is conceived in such a way that as the warm part cools down
the mass of the very cold one increases so that their relative densities change
at given total volume of the particle A very cold particle is thus formed
This is similar to what has been suggested by Springel  Hernquist 2003 in
cosmological context The evolution of the very cold particles is then governed
only by gravity radiative cooling cloud-cloud collisions which dissipate kinetic
energy and SN feed-back A very cold gas particle is eventually turned into
a star particle according to the Schmidt 1959 law however interpreted in the
probabilistic manner proposed by Lia et al
2002 Star particles can later
be turned back into gas as a result of SN explosions SNs release energy and
metals to the ISM leading to the evaporation of the nearby clouds and thus
self-regulating the SF process

Results The above model has been used to simulate the formation and evolu-
tion of a galaxy whose initial conditions are derived from cosmological density
perturbations according to GRAFIC2 of Bertshinger 2001 see Merlin  Chiosi
2006 for details The proto-galaxy has total mass DMBM of  2  1011M
and radius of 20 kpc Each component is described by  7000 particles The BM
is initially in form of gas The cosmological scenario is the W-Map3 CDM The
proto-galaxy is framed into the conformal Hubble ow and it is followed from
the initial redshift z  60 down to z  1 Baryons follow the DM perturbations
until they heat up by mechanical friction radiative cooling becomes really e-
cient the rst cold clouds begin to form and eventually stars are born Owing
to the mass resolution each star particle has the mass size of a star cluster in
which real stars distribute according to a given initial mass function In a star
particle SN explosions may eventually occur They release energy thus causing
the evaporation of nearby clouds and eventually quenching SF Two important
features of the model are shown in Fig1 The left panel displays the SF rate
M per year vs age the right panel the spherically averaged star surface den-
sity prole at z  1 dots The SF consists of a single prominent episode at
high redshifts followed by a long tail The formation of the galaxy is completed
at z  15 The mean metallicity is about  75 solar Likely the stellar com-
ponent has already relaxed to the Sersic 1968 prole with m  43 solid line
Finally the hot gas heated by SN explosions causes strong galactic winds

Discussion Owing to the early intense burst of SF the present model may
reproduce many features of the so-called EROs see eg Bundy et al 2005
Fine tuning of the model parameters may yield results that closely t many
observational properties of early-type galaxies
