During these three years my work was extremely diversied and I had the opportunity to do widely
different things such as take a deep breath preparing proposals for observing time getting married
with you Carole observing at the telescope reducing data going out with people Ive met during
schools or meetings building empirical and analytical models or use numerical codes to interpret the
data doubting working on the JWSTMIRI instrument and being part of such a huge project as MIRI
running traveling and giving talks teaching at the University etc I am aware of having been lucky
and privileged and obviously all of this would not have been possible without all the people Ive been
working or interacting with So a big big thank you  
   to Franois Boulanger
for his enthusiastic supervi-
sion of this thesis Franois
it has been a pleasure to
work with you during these
three years
Ive learned
so much science at your
I greatly beneted
from your experience your
general vision of physical
processes in the interstellar
medium from your rigour
and work methods You al-
ways pushed me to the rst
line at the shock front
to do things by myself to
be responsible After three
years Im always impressed by your long-term vision of astrophysics and astropolitics by your ability
to raise new ideas and to question what we thought to understand I greatly appreciated your humility
your optimism and your breezy zestful character It is thus difcult to ask more from a supervisor
   to Guillaume Pineau des Forts my co-supervisor Despite your incredibly busy schedule you
were always available Im proud to had such an expert in shocks and chemistry on my side I greatly
appreciated the clarity of your explanations both during your masters courses and discussions about
gas physics we had together
   to the californians Phil Appleton Patrick Ogle and Michelle Cluver Thanks for having invited
me at Caltech and allowed me to join you for an observing run at Palomar to observe our favorite
 H2 in a cosmic shock 2009 Publication of the Marina del Rey LA Vol 2object Stephans Quintet Im grateful to Patrick and Phil for the postdoc position they offered me
and Im particularly glad to continue our fruitful collaboration Your team has opened a new H2
route so lets explore it together   Now Im looking forward to see your cosmic boat Phil It
looks really great Thanks Michelle for the energy you put in reducing all these new data
looking forward to meet you
   to Alain Abergel for pushing me into the MIRI project You have been always enthusiastic and
giving value to the work I was doing I do not forget the CEA team at Saclay in particular Samuel
Ronayette Jrme Amiaux Vincent Moreau Pierre-Olivier Lagage and Jean-Louis Augures I am par-
ticularly grateful to Thomas Rodet from the LSS for his skills in signal processing and deconvolution
algorithms
   to Vincent Guillet and Nicole Nesvadba You were postdoc at the beginning of my PhD and
now both of you have permanent positions Congratulations Thanks a lot Vincent for all the nice

Abstract
My main thesis work is to understand the origin of molecular Hydrogen H2 emission in ac-
tive phases of galaxy evolution Spitzer space telescope observations reveal a new class of
H2-luminous galaxies with enhanced H2 line emission but where star formation is strongly sup-
pressed This is in sharp contrast with what is observed in standard star forming galaxies
The Stephans Quintet SQ galaxy collision is a striking example I initially focus on We present
a scenario and a detailed model to account for the presence of H2 in the SQ giant shock to
characterize its physical state and to describe its role as a cooling agent of a violent phase of
galaxy interactions In this scenario the dissipation of the mechanical energy of the collision
produces a multiphase medium where molecular gas fragments coexist with a hot  5  106 K
X-ray emitting plasma Our model quanties the gas cooling dust destruction H2 formation and
emission in the postshock multiphase gas The dynamical interaction between the ISM phases
drives a cycle where H2 is formed out of atomic gas that cools and is excited repeatedly before
being destroyed A cascade of energy is associated with this cycle in which the mechanical energy
powers supersonic turbulence within the molecular gas The H2 emission is associated with the
dissipation of this turbulent energy
New results of mid-infrared and radio observations in the SQ shock are presented These obser-
vations reveal that dust and CO emission gas is associated with the warm cid38 100 K H2 seen
by Spitzer and that this gas is in an unusual physical state where star formation is suppressed
In addition to test the scenario proposed for the formation of H2 in the SQ shock I carry on a
detailed observational study and modeling of the dust emission from the H2 gas Observational
perspectives with the Herschel satellite are discussed
These observations suggest that H2 contributes signicantly to the energy bugdet of galaxies
which are in key phases of their evolution galaxy interaction gas accretion in galaxy clusters
starburst or AGN feedback My thesis work is a rst step to understand the role that molecular
gas plays in galaxy evolution Our model developped for SQ is extended to the context of radio
galaxies which allow for the rst time to peer at the impact of the AGN-driven jet on the mul-
tiphase ISM of the host galaxy A natural extension of this work is the characterization of the
energetics of galactic winds in the M82 starburst galaxy for instance and in AGN-driven winds
recently discovered in high-redshift radio-galaxies This thesis includes the tools to perform a
detailed modeling of Spitzer and upcoming Herschel data
Besides this work as a member of the JWSTMIRI consortium I also report my contribution to
the optical performance tests of the MIRI instrument which will extend the study of H2-luminous
galaxies to high redshifts The observational and theoretical work presented in this manuscript
may help to develop a phenomenological recipe of the impact of H2 on the energetics of galaxy
evolution This work will certainly be helpful for the preparation of future observing programs
aiming at testing this phenomenology directly thanks to spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies
with the JWST and SPICA missions

Molecules dust and galaxy evolution
Chapter 1
The discovery of a new population of H2-luminous objects
The most exciting phrase to hear in science the one that heralds
new discoveries is not Eureka but Thats funny
Isaac Asimov
Abstract
One of the surprising results obtained with the Spitzer space telescope is the discovery of a signi-
cant and diverse population of low-redshift objects where the mid-infrared rotational line emission
of molecular hydrogen is strongly enhanced while star formation is suppressed This is in sharp
contrast with previous observations where H2 was solely associated with star formation These
H2-luminous sources include galaxies that are in key-phases of their evolution dominated by
gas accretion galaxy interactions or galactic winds driven by star formation and active galactic
nuclei These observations open a new perspective on ISM physics and on the role that molecular
gas plays in active phases of galaxy evolution Why is H2 present in these violent environments
How is the H2 emission powered Why is the H2 gas unefcient at forming stars These questions
are the core issues addressed in my thesis work
11 Introduction
The molecular gas plays a central role in galaxy evolution In most galaxies it carries the bulk
of the mass of the interstellar matter and it is the fuel for star formation Stars are indeed made
from gravitationally unstable cores within molecular clouds Therefore the mass of molecular gas is
generally associated with the star formation rate by dening a star formation efciency1 see Schmidt
1959 The bulk of the molecular gas in most galaxies is known from molecular line spectroscopy
to be cold  10  20 K Fixsen et al 1999 Most of the present studies primarily rely on tracing
molecular gas through the observation of low rotational emission of carbon monoxyde CO in the
radio domain
The H2 molecule being the most abundant molecule in the Universe is the main constituent of
the molecular gas To be seen in emission the H2 gas temperature must be warmer than  100 K
Mid-infrared Mid-IR rotational line H2 emission traces what I will call warm H2 throughout my
manuscript at temperatures T  1023 K see chapter 3 Warm H2 was rst observed within galactic
star-forming regions and associated with the illumination of the surface of molecular clouds by UV
light from massive stars creating Photo-Dissociation Regions PDRs see eg Habart et al 2003 In
the Galaxy H2 is also observed in proto-stellar outows eg Neufeld et al 2006 Maret et al 2009
or supernovae remnants eg Hewitt et al 2009 where it is shock-heated

1 The discovery of a new population of H2-luminous objects
Figure 11 Relationship between H2 and IR emission from PAHs in nearby spatially resolved star-
forming SF galaxies dwarf galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei AGN The data is from Roussel
et al 2007 These galaxies belong to the SINGSa sample of galaxies observed with the Spitzer space
telescope The H2 luminosity is summed over the S0 to S3 rotational lines of H2
aSpitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey httpsingsstsciedu
The ISO2 and Spitzer3 IR satellites have started to peer at H2 emission from external galaxies
In star forming galaxies rotational H2 line emission is thought to come from PDRs Rigopoulou
et al 2002 Higdon et al 2006 Roussel et al 2007 A general relationship between the H2 and IR
luminosity is inferred from these data This correlation is shown for nearby galaxies observed with the
Spitzer space telescope on Fig 11 Note that the Active Galactic Nuclei AGN galaxies stand above
the tight correlation found for dwarf and star-forming SF galaxies Roussel et al 2007 indicate that
the H2 to PAH luminosity ratio in star forming galaxies is within the range of values that are expected
from PDR emission For the AGN sample Roussel et al 2007 suggest that the radiation from the
AGN is not sufcient to power the H2 emission
Recent mid-IR spectroscopy performed with the IRS4 onboard the Spitzer space telescope suggests
that our census of warm molecular gas in galaxies may be severely incomplete revealing a new class of
galaxies with strongly enhanced H2 rotational emission lines while classical star formation indicators
far-infrared continuum emission ionized gas lines polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs are
strongly suppressed These galaxies are called in this manuscript H2-luminous galaxies
In this chapter we paint the global observational framework of this PhD work Section 12 presents
the observational discovery of H2-luminous objects We point out the key astrophysical questions that
we address in this manuscript in sect 13 The main goal of my thesis work is to interpret these

surprising observations
12 H2-luminous galaxies
121 Global observational characteristics
The rst extragalactic mid-IR spectrum dominated by H2 rotational lines has been detected in the
Stephans Quintet hereafter SQ compact group of galaxies Appleton et al 2006 Strikingly the
H2 emission is detected outside the galactic disks of the group and is more powerful that the X-ray
emission from the hot gas lying in the group halo I started my PhD shortly after the publication of that
paper My research quickly focused on this object with the aim of explaining the origin of the H2 gas
and its power compared to that of the hot X-ray emitting gas To determine and model the excitation
mechanisms that can power the observed H2 emission was a driver to tackle the latter problem This
observational discovery and my interpretation and modeling work are detailed in chapters 5 and 6
The detection of H2 emission from SQ was the rst of a series of discoveries of powerful H2
emission in extragalactic sources that we present here Fig 12 gathers a sample of this new class
of extremely luminous H2 emission galaxies up to 1010 Lcid12 in pure rotational molecular hydrogen
emission lines and relatively weak total IR emission This plot shows how H2 galaxies stand out
above star forming galaxies from the SINGS5 survey when plotting the ratio of H2 rotational lines to
the PAH 77 m luminosities vs continuum luminosity at 24 m These H2-luminous galaxies are
therefore out of the correlation presented in Fig 11 Some of the sources have undetected 77 m
emission so lower limits for LH2LPAH77 are indicated
The global characteristics of H2-luminous galaxies are the following Ogle et al 2009 use em-
pirical criteria to dene H2-luminous galaxies6 H2-luminous galaxies have a large total H2 to IR
luminosity ratio
and more specically a large H2 to 77 m PAH luminosity
L24 m  10
LPAH77  004  10
The lower limit of 004 is an empirical value and also depends on the depth of the Spitzer observations
These ratios are up to two orders of magnitude greater than the median values for the normal star-
forming galaxies This is why they stand out of normal star-forming galaxies and luminous infrared
galaxies in the plot of Fig 12
H2-luminous galaxies point at a generic source of H2 emission not powered by star formation
The most contrasted examples show bright H2 emission lines with almost no spectroscopic signature
IR continuum of thermal dust emission or ionized gas lines of star formation For instance this
is the case in Stephans Quintet see chapter 6 and in the 3C326 radio-galaxy Ogle et al 2007
The spectrum of 3C326 is shown in Fig 12 on top of the standard spectrum of a starburst galaxy

Figure 12 H2-luminous galaxies in one plot Left Ratio of H2 rotational emission summed over
the 0-0 S0S3 lines to 77m PAH luminosity as a function of the 24m continuum luminosity
The ratio indicates the relative importance of mechanical heating and power by star formation At
all IR luminosities the observations reveal galaxies with excess H2 emission beyond that expected
from Star Formation SF The empty diamonds and the dashed line show the range spanned by
SF-dominated galaxies The H2-luminous galaxies include active galactic nuclei galaxies Seyferts
LINERs and radio galaxies cooling ows Perseus A ZW3146 and interacting galaxiesmergers
Stephans Quintet SQ and NGC 6240 The H2-luminous radio-galaxies are from the Ogle et al
2009 sample The excess H2 emission reveals large up to 1010 Mcid12  quantities of warm T 
150 K molecular gas On the right side we compare the spectrum of the 3C326 H2-luminous radio-
galaxy Ogle et al 2007 with that of starburst galaxies Brandl et al 2006
Note the absence of dust continuum and features in the H2-luminous 3C326 radio-galaxy spectrum as
compared to a star-forming galaxy
In many of these galaxies molecular gas has been detected through the mid-IR H2 rotational
lines prior to any CO observation This sample of H2-luminous objects comprises different types
of astrophysical sources We briey describe below some of the most important examples in each
category of sources
122 Examples among different types of H2-luminous astrophysical sources
Among the sample of H2-luminous objects Stephans Quintet is certainly the object where the astro-
physical context is clear enough to identify the dominant source of energy that powers the H2 emission

1 The discovery of a new population of H2-luminous objects
In Fig 13 we show two iconic infrared galaxies NGC 6240 and M82 that show strong H2 emis-
sion NGC 6240 is a ultra-luminous infrared merger LIR  6  1011 Lcid12 with optical and mid-IR
signatures of AGN activity The outstanding property of NGC 6240 is the presence of a double-AGN
Komossa et al 2003 Lutz et al 2003 report mid- and far-IR spectroscopy with the ISO SWS8
and LWS9 instruments and nd unusually strong H2 mid-IR lines This result is conrmed by Armus

et al 2006 who nd  2  109 Mcid12 of warm H2 within the 113cid48cid48
the IRS that include the two nuclei and part of an extended region where near-IR ro-vib H2 emission
is detected van der Werf et al 1993 Max et al 2005
The M82 starburst galaxy is not stricto sensu an H2 luminous galaxy but we show it in Fig 13
because it may provide insights for the interpretation of other H2-luminous objects The well-known
Spitzer image reveals the dust emission in the starburst-driven wind Interestingly H2 is detected in
the outow of the galaxy Engelbracht et al 2006 Veilleux et al 2009 also detected emission in
the H2 1-0S1 212 m rovibrational line from the starburst-driven wind M82 is clear example where
H2 gas and dust coexist with the hot plasma outowing gas
Up to now Stephans Quintet is the only example among the Hickson Compact Groups HCGs
catalog Hickson 1982 that show powerful emission Appleton et al 2006 Cluver et al 2009
HCGs are isolated high-surface-brightness galaxy groups containing at least 4 members within a nar-
row optical magnitude range  13  14 mag and almost all of them involve extreme galaxy tidal
interactions Hickson 1982 Sulentic et al 2001 A Spitzer observations have been carried on to
search for H2 in HCGs and the data are being analysed see chapter 9
Radio-galaxies
The rst H2-luminous radio-galaxy 3C326 was discovered by Ogle et al 2007 It is one of the most
extreme H2-luminous sources see Fig 12 We will discuss this object in more detail in chapter 9
3C326 is one example of a sample of H2-luminous radio-galaxies selected such that z  022 from
the 3CR11 catalog reported in Ogle et al 2009 They nd that among 57 sources 17  30
have strong H2 rotational lines These galaxies are the red triangles in Fig 12
In Fig 14 we
show four examples of IRS spectra Note the strong H2 lines as opposed to the weakness of the
PAH features and the absence of silicate absorption The summed H2 S0-S3 line luminosities are
LH2  1032  2  1035 W Ogle et al 2009 estimate the mass of warm molecular gas in these
galaxies to be12 M H2  105  2  1010 Mcid12
Radio-galaxies have an AGN and a source of mechanical energy that is the AGN-driven jet It is
not clear how the H2 luminosity is powered The large majority 1617 of these radio-galaxies seem
to belong to pairs or clusters see the HST images on the right of Fig 14 This suggests that galaxy

clusters The most striking examples shown on Fig 15 are the Zwicky 3146 Egami et al 2006

13 Main questions addressed in this dissertation
131 Astrophysical implications of observations of H2-galaxies
The observations of H2-luminous galaxies are puzzling for several reasons and raise these two main
astrophysical questions
Why is H2 present in violent phases of galaxy evolution
First in galaxy clusters or high-speed galaxy collisions like Stephans Quintet the presence of large
quantities of warm H2 gas in a hot gas environment is unexpected In starburst-driven winds like M82
or AGN-driven outows like radio-galaxies 3C326 in particular it is not clear whether the H2 gas
is molecular material that has been entrained from the galactic disk by radiation pressure andor the
outow ram pressure or whether it is formed in situ meaning formed out of warm outowing gas
Observations of H2-luminous galaxies thus raise the question of the origin and the physical state of
the molecular gas in these environments In particular is the warm H2 physically associated with a
more massive reservoir of cold T cid46 100 K molecular gas as it is the case in standard galaxies
How is the H2 emission powered
In H2-luminous galaxies H2 lines appear to have an unexpected contribution to the gas cooling The
energy source powering the H2 emission and the dominant H2 excitation mechanisms remains to be
identied In the Stephans Quintet galaxy collision the astrophysical context is clearer than in distant
objects essentially because it has been extensively observed from X-ray to radio wavelengths This
allows to study in more details the physics of the H2 formation and emission and to infer a physical
framework to interpret other observations of H2-luminous sources
In conclusion the core of this thesis is to understand the origin of the H2 emission in these H2-
luminous objects to identify and to study the underlying physical processes that drive H2 formation
and excitation in these hostile environments

1 The discovery of a new population of H2-luminous objects
Why is the H2 gas inefcient at forming stars
In the introduction we have stated that up to now H2 observations have been mostly associated
with stellar activity H2-luminous galaxies are revealing molecular gas in a physical state where it
is inefcient at forming stars which does not straigthforwardly t with our current understanding of
the link between molecular gas and star formation These H2 observations raise the question of the
identication of the physical processes that inhibit star formation in H2-luminous galaxies I have
addressed this question within the context of the Stephan Quintet galaxy collision see chapters 5 7
and 8 and the 3C326 radio galaxy chapter 9
132 What can we learn from H2 galaxies
A common characteristic links the heterogeneous sample of H2-luminous galaxies presented above
they are all in active and key phases of galaxy evolution dominated by accretion galaxy interactions
energy plus gas ejection due to star formation or to the action of the central black hole on its environ-
ment AGN feedback The exceptional H2 luminosities observed in this variety of sources suggest
that molecular gas is responding to these active phases of galaxy evolution The discovery of H2 lu-
minous galaxies then suggests that molecular gas has an important impact on the energetics of galaxy
formation and evolution which is up to now largely unexplored Most of the analytical models
or simulations that describe galaxy evolution within the context of cosmological structure formation
ignore the physics of the molecular gas
Although H2 emission does not trace the bulk of the molecular mass directly these H2 observa-
tions reveal key aspects of the energetic interplay between galaxies and the intergalactic medium and
between stars and their nascent clouds that are missed by CO observations The low star-formation
efciency observed in H2-luminous galaxies may also provide insights in the processes that trigger or
regulate star formation
To sum up H2-luminous objects may represent an unexplored step in galaxy evolution which
provide insights in the role molecular gas plays in galaxy evolution

21 Introduction
Although William Herschel and Edward Barnard produced the rst images of dark nebulae sil-
houetted against the background star eld of the galaxy eg Barnard 1919 the rst direct
detection of diffuse matter in interstellar space was made by Hartmann 1904 through absorption
spectroscopy of the K-line of calcium at 3934  toward the line of sight of the -Orionis star This
discovery lauched more than one century of studies on the interstellar medium henceforth ISM
2 Gas and dust in galaxies
The ISM the matter that exists between the stars plays a crucial role in astrophysics precisely
because of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales The study of the ISM is closely
related to the lifecycle of stars Stars form within molecular clouds and replenish the ISM with matter
and energy when they die through supernovae explosions planetary nebulae stellar winds etc This
interplay between stars and the ISM helps determine the rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous
content and therefore its lifespan of active star formation
Much of my PhD work is dedicated to the modeling of the formation of molecular hydrogen and
its emission in H2-luminous sources these sources have been introduced in chapter 1 This involves
the physics of the gas and dust in the ISM of these galaxies In particular this modeling is based on
the heating and cooling mechanisms of the gas and on the exchanges of energy between the different
phases of the ISM
This chapter is not an exhaustive review of ISM physics We direct the reader to the books by
Dopita and Sutherland 2003 Lequeux 2005 Tielens 2005 and to the review by Ferrire 2001 I
introduce here some of the key astrophysical processes on which we will rely in the following chapters
In section 22 we present the different gaseous phases of the ISM and their interactions Section 23
focuses on dust evolution in galaxies Then I focus on the modeling of the cooling of a dusty hot
plasma This calculation is illustrated within the context of H2 studies in the multiphase medium of
the Stephans Quintet galaxy collision see chapter 5 but i it can apply to many other astrophysical
situations and ii it provides interesting results on dust survival in the multiphase ISM
22 The multiphase interstellar medium ISM in galaxies
Interstellar matter comprises of gas mostly composed of hydrogen and solid particles of dust that
contain half of the elements heavier than Helium the so-called metals in astrophysics The matter
consists of about 99 gas and 1 dust by mass If the ISM lls most of the volume of a galaxy it
only represents a tiny fraction of its mass 5 of the stellar mass and 05 of the total mass of the
galaxy that is dominated by the dark matter
221 Constituents phases and structure of the ISM
Because of the variety of processes involved in the ISM an extremely wide range of physical con-
ditions are present in the interstellar gas The average density of the ISM is 1 particle per cm3 in
the Milky Way Galaxy1 but this value varies by 8 orders of magnitude from the hot T  106 K
tenuous plasma produced by supernovae shocks to cold T  10 K prestellar condensations
In table 21 we gather the physical conditions density temperature etc of the different compo-
nents of the ISM In the following I describe these components from an observational point of view
This description based on observations is very schematic the ISM properties being a continuuous
distribution
The Hot Ionized Medium HIM this hot ionized volume-lling phase has been introduced by
Spitzer 1956 to explain the stability of the cold clouds that are not gravitationally bound
This phase results mostly from supernovae explosions that produce hot 1057 K bubbles of
1This average density of 1 particle per cm3 in the ISM is 1019 less than the air we are breathing
22 The multiphase interstellar medium ISM in galaxies
Figure 21 The structure of the ISM as seen by McKee and Ostriker 1977 and the Spitzer telescope
In the schematic view left diffuse clouds have an onion-like structure in which teneous and hotter
phases are surrounding denser and colder phases The Spitzer image of the ISM in the Large Magel-
lanic Cloud right shows a contrasted view where the ISM is a complex network of laments sheets
and cavities structured by star formation

2 Gas and dust in galaxies
expanding gas or stellar winds The gas at  105 K is predominantly traced by soft  1 keV
X-ray emission and UV absorption lines OVI NV etc Hotter gas  106 K can be seen
through X-ray emission lines OVII OVIII This diffuse hot plasma phase is also characterized
by a thermal continuum free-free ot free-bound X-ray emission
The Warm Ionized Medium WIM this diffuse phase is mostly produced by the ionization of the
diffuse neutral medium by stellar radiation or shocks or by ejection of matter from HII regions
Yorke et al 1989 This gas at 1034 K is traced by recombination of forbidden line emission
In the McKee and Ostriker 1977 view the WIM is associated with the external shell of a cloud
H II regions unlike the HIM and the WIM this hot ionized gas phase is localized around the hot
stars O- or B-type that create ionized shells by their UV radiation An idealized model for
these regions is the Strmgren sphere which results from the equilibrium between the ionizing
ux  136 eV and the electronic recombination rate Some of these regions can be compact
less than 1 pc or extremely extended 1 kpc or more in case of very massive star clusters
These regions are traced by free-free or free-bound emission see the book by Osterbrock 1989
for details like in the HIM and by UV absorption and IR emission due to the heating of dust
by the star Diverse optical recombination lines are also produced like H and also forbidden
lines NII SII OIII etc
The Warm Neutral Medium WNM within the inner shells of the clouds the gas is shielded from
the background ionizing radiation and is mostly neutral while photoelectric heating maintains
the gas at temperatures around 8000 K This phase is mostly traced by H I 21 cm line emission
The Cold Neutral Medium CNM its atomic component is traced by the H I 21 cm line emission
while UV absorption spectroscopy reveals diffuse H2 gas Richter et al 2003 This gas is cold
because it is denser than the WNM
Molecular Clouds MCs these gravitationally bound structures result from the condensation of a
diffuse cloud under the effect of gravity These clouds are dense enough for hydrogen to be
molecular H2 MCs occupy a tiny fraction of the total ISM volume 1 but account for a
substantial fraction of the total mass of the ISM 30  60 Molecular clouds are structured
over a wide range of spatial scales from giant complexes GMCs of more than 106 Mcid12 and
sizes of 100 pc to smaller condensations of 50 Mcid12  1 pc
Classically the ISM has been modeled by a mixture of different phases Field et al 1969 put
forward a static two-phase equilibrium model to explain the observed properties of the ISM Their
modeled ISM consists of a cold dense phase T  300 K made of clouds of neutral and molecular
hydrogen and a warm intercloud phase T  104 K consisting of rareed neutral and ionized gas
McKee and Ostriker 1977 added a third phase that represents the hot T cid38 106 K gas which is
shock heated by supernovae and constitutes most of the volume of the ISM This schematic view
at the ISM is presented on the left panel of Fig 21 These phases are associated with temperatures
where heating and cooling can reach a stable equilibrium except for the hot phase which is metastable
and needs to be continuously replenished Their paper formed the basis for further study over the past
three decades
22 The multiphase interstellar medium ISM in galaxies
Today our view at the ISM is dynamical and based on numerical simulations The dynamical evo-
lution of the multiphase ISM in galaxies has been extensively investigated with numerical simulations
within the context of the injection of mechanical energy by star formation in particular supernovae
explosions de Avillez and Breitschwerdt 2005 Dib et al 2006 This injection of energy by su-
pernovae is shown to be able to maintain a fragmented multiphase and turbulent ISM in which the
gas phases are not in pressure equilibrium Theoretical studies and numerical simulations of a super-
sonically turbulent isothermal gas show that the pressure may vary over two orders of magnitude the
distribution function of the pressure values being lognormal with a dispersion that increases with the
Mach number Vazquez-Semadeni 1994 Padoan et al 1997 Passot and Vzquez-Semadeni 1998
Mac Low et al 2005
222 Structuring the ISM
The CNM WNM WIM and HIM form the diffuse ISM phases In the McKee and Ostriker 1977
equilibrium model the diffuse clouds are structured like onions or Russian dolls Due to heat
conduction the teneous phases surround the denser ones However as shown in Fig 21 the ISM
structure is much more complex It is organized in laments or sheets continuously stirred by tur-
bulent motions This structure is observed from large scales see the Spitzer image of the LMC2 in
Fig 21 to small scales around the solar neighbourhood This self-similar structure is also observed
within molecular clouds eg Falgarone 2002
It has often been proposed that the condensation of matter by thermal instability that will be dis-
cussed in sect 225 was the origin of the multiphase structure of the ISM eg McKee and Ostriker
1977 Wolre et al 1995 On the other hand since almost 30 years it is known that the ISM is a
turbulent medium Larson 1981 Scalo 1987 Measurements of line velocity dispersions Solomon
et al 1987 Caselli and Myers 1995 show that supersonic ows permanently skim through the ISM
These observations led to models where the ISM clouds are not the product of thermal condensation
but the result of short-lived over-densities due to turbulent motions It has even been proposed that the
pressure equilibrium between the ISM phases was not relevant for the ISM Ballesteros-Paredes et al
1999 Vzquez-Semadeni et al 2000 However these statements are moderated by Hennebelle and
Prault 1999 Audit and Hennebelle 2005 who show that thermal instability can be triggered by
large-scale motions in the ISM Therefore it seems that both thermal instability and turbulence are
not exclusive with each other in the role they play in the structuring of the ISM eg Dib and Burkert
223 Energy content of the ISM
The ISM is penetrated by photons and high-energy particles In addition it is dynamically tied to the
magnetic eld of the galaxy I briey summarize here the main energetic components of the ISM
In the solar neighbourhood the average total electromagnetic energy density is  1 eV cm3 This
radiation is dominated by the UV and visible stellar radiation and also the strong infrared radiation In
addition the cosmological blackbody radiation of the Universe at 27 K correspond to 026 eV cm3
2Large Magellanic Cloud
2 Gas and dust in galaxies
The average strength of the magnetic eld is B  5 G Heiles and Troland 2005 which cor-
responds to an average magnetic energy density of  1 eV cm3 Although partly organized at the
galactic scale the magnetic eld in the ISM comprises of a random component and a regular compo-
nent both of comparable strengths
Cosmic-rays are high-energy mostly relativistic particles electrons protons heavier atoms
propagating through the ISM gas with little interactions except at energies cid46 01 MeV Assuming
equipartition of energy between cosmic-ray and magnetic energy densities the average cosmic-ray
energy density derived from synchrotron emission is  1 eV cm3
The kinetic energy may be non-thermal for instance in case of supersonic motions of the gas or
thermal and the distribution between the two forms of kinetic energy depends on the gas phase In
the CNM the non-thermal energy is observed to dominate the thermal energy Assuming an average
density in the solar neighbourhood of nH cid39 25 cm3 and a temperature of T cid39 100 K the average
thermal energy is  03 eV cm3
All the energy densities listed above photons magnetic eld cosmic-rays random motions are
commensurate and of the order of 1 eV cm3 in the vicinity of the Sun This is not a fortuitous
coincidence but the result of energy transfers between this different forms of energy Consequently
although there are exceptions one cannot neglect any of these energies which makes the study of the
ISM so difcult so exciting
224 Mass and energy transfers between the ISM phases
The ISM is a restless medium None of the ISM components introduced above is static in time or
space A permanent exchange of matter between stars and the matter between them occurs in the
galactic disk but also between the galaxy and the intergalactic medium The interstellar matter is
thus constantly owing from one phase to another Depending on the physical process  and on the
spatial scale we consider the timescales associated with these mass and energy transfers can be very
different from eg 106 yr to form a protostar out of its parent molecular cloud to eg 109 yr to
consume all the molecular gas content by star formation on galactic scales
The lifecycle of interstellar matter
The cycle of interstellar matter sketched in Fig 22 is closely related to the lifecycle of stars Stars
are born in the densest regions of molecular clouds when the gravity takes over the turbulent motions
and condenses the gas During their life they emit UV radiation and hot winds that create local HII
regions and may eventually break through the parent cloud and fuel the WIM and HIM phases Some
of these stars at the end of their life explode in supernovae The supernovae shocks heat and ionized
the gas enriching the gas with metals and may eventually destroy the molecular cloud from which
they were born When the ionizing source has switched off recombination occurs and in turn the
WIM and HIM can cool Under the effect of gravitational contraction diffuse neutral and molecular
clouds may re-form Within this dynamical picture of the gas evolution the dust is also experiencing
a lifecycle which contributes to its evolution and this to the evolution of the galaxy properties in
general This will be discussed in sect 23
22 The multiphase interstellar medium ISM in galaxies
Figure 22 The cycle of the interstellar matter within a galaxy The ISM is not a passive substrate
within which stars evolve It constitutes their direct partner in the ecosystem of a galaxy continually
exchanging matter and energy with them
It is the spatial distribution ot the interstellar material
together with its thermal and chemical characteristics that determines the locations where new stars
form as well as their mass and luminosity spectra Therefore the lifecycle of interstellar matter
governs the overall structure and emission properties of a galaxy
To sum up the physical processes involved in the mass and energy transfers between ISM phases
can be splitted into two categories
Dynamical processes large- and small-scale uid motions in a multiphase medium transfer momen-
tum and kinetic energy from one phase to another Large-scale motions are dominated by galaxy
interactions disk-halo circulation galactic rotation stellar-driven winds and supernovae and
gravitational collapse of giant molecular complexes At small scales the dynamics of the ISM
is controlled by turbulence and uid instabilities Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor As
introduced in sect 221 the fact that the structure of the ISM is fragmented and self-similar3
3This property is true over four orders of magnitude in size from galactic to proto-stellar scales

2 Gas and dust in galaxies
suggest that turbulence plays an important role in the dynamical coupling between the different
scales of the ISM The kinetic energy cascade from the bulk motions on large scales to small-
scale turbulence is a key aspect of ISM dynamics that is still poorly understood see Elmegreen
and Scalo 2004 Scalo and Elmegreen 2004 for reviews about interstellar turbulence
Thermal processes thermal exchanges heating and cooling mechanisms correspond to a transfer
of thermal energy to or from atoms molecules and ions of the interstellar gas Most of the
heating mechanisms involves the release of a suprathermal particle electron molecule from a
gas or grain specie by an energetic particle or a photon This suprathermal particle heats the gas
by thermalization through collisions The cooling mechanisms mainly occur through inelastic
collisions between light gaseous colliders e H H etc and heavier atoms molecules or
grains If energy levels of these targets can be excited by the collider the collider loses kinetic
energy and the gas cools by thermalization with the collider The target then dissipates its
energy through the emission of radiation In the neutral ISM this line emission mostly occur in
the infrared rotational or ne-structure line emission of eg C C O H2 CO H2O etc in
the cold phase Except in dense molecular clouds the opacity of the medium is small in the
infrared so that the radiation can escape and the gas can effectively cool
The heat conduction allows to redistribute the thermal energy content from one thermal phase to
another Heat conduction occurs through electron conduction collisions or turbulent transport
We will study these processes in more detail in sect 452 when we will discuss the fate of
molecular gas in a hot plasma which is particularly relevant for H2 studies in the multiphase
ISM of H2 galaxies
Within a range of physical conditions density temperature the gas is thermally unstable
A dynamical or thermal perturbation can bring the gas from one stable phase to a thermally
unstable state which is sufciently far from its initial state that it evolves towards another stable
phase The thermal instability appears to be an important source of mass and energy exchange
between phases in the ISM This process is discussed in the next section sect 225
225 Thermal balance in the ISM
The ISM is shaped by the gas dynamics and thermal properties As introduced before the thermal
instability plays an important role in the physics and in structuring the ISM Thermal instabilities
arises from the properties of the thermal equilibrium of the gas I will not review here all the cooling
and heating mechanisms see eg the book by Lequeux 2005 but rather focus on the properties of a
thermally unstable gas

dominates the heating    Below    The bottom panel shows the main contributions to the
 and  functions
The rst discussion of thermal instability in low-density media like the ISM has been made in a
classical paper by Field 1965 I will follow his analysis to derive the thermal instability criterion
Let us consider a volume of interstellar gas the system in thermal equilibrium at P T and introduce
a perturbation of density or temperature while keeping constant another thermodynamic variable A
for instance the pressure or the density Since the entropy of the medium is dened by
cid20 S
E being the internal energy of the system The perturbation yields to a change L in the cooling
efciency
Rewriting Eq 22 the associated change S in the entropy can be expressed as follows
L  L  L
which can be re-written as
cid20 L
This equation gives the time-evolution of the perturbation of the entropy of the system If this per-
turbation S grows with time the thermal equilibrium of the system is unstable This criterion of
thermal instability can thus be written as
cid20 L
cid20 L
cid20 P
cid20 L
For the isobaric case A  P and since TdS  cPdT the instability criterion can be re-written as
The last form of the instability criterion4 can be interpreted by looking at the top panel of Fig 23 Let
us consider the green point located in the portion of the equilibrium curve where its slope is negative
If density increases the pressure of the system diminishes and becomes smaller than the ambient
external pressure Thus the system is compressed and the density further increases The equilibrium
is unstable in this zone This positive feedback will stop when the gas reaches a stable equilibrium
the black point to the right in this case
4This last form is obtained by using
cid18 d log P
cid18 L
cid18 L
23 Evolution of interstellar dust
When thermal instability becomes bi-stability
The thermal instability is the core of the Field et al 1969 two-phase model of the ISM and I have
sketched the principle of the bi-stability in the top panel of Fig 23 Let us consider again our green
point at cid104Pcid105 cid104nHcid105 Any perturbation will make the system leave this unstable equilibrium and
evolves toward a stable one If the pressure of the system falls within the Pmin Pmax range Fig 23
shows that there are three equilibrium congurations an unstable one green point and two stable
black points The stable congurations are identied as the warm intercloud medium and the cold
atomic clouds by Field et al 1969
A few remarks need to be given about this simple model First the range of pressures observed in
the ISM is not always compatible with the unstable part of the thermal equilibrium curve Secondly
the pressure equilibrium is not always reached This is the case at small scales because the timescale
of the propagation of the perturbation speed of sound times the length-scale is shorter than the
characteristic interval between two perturbation typically a few 105 yr for supernovae explosions
yielding to sizes of 04 pc for the CNM and 4 pc for the WNM Third in the warm medium the
cooling time is larger than the perturbation time and therefore the thermal equilibrium may not be
reached for the WNM In addition note that the criterion for thermal instability has to be modied for
dynamical systems out of thermal equilibrium The interested reader can refer to Balbus 1986 And
last depending on the coolingheating process at work the metallicity of the gas the presence of dust
or not the shape of the cooling function may vary as function of the environment and sometimes it
may not exhibit and unstable part We will come back to this point in sect 24
23 Evolution of interstellar dust
231 The importance of dust for our study of H2-luminous galaxies
Dust grains are nanometer- to micrometer-sized solid particles that are mixed with the interstellar
gas5 Although dust represents only  1 of the total mass of the ISM it plays a central role in the
physics and chemistry of this medium Dust grains are particularly important for our study for two
main reasons
H2 formation dust grains are the sites for H2 formation this will be discussed in chapter 3 More
generally dust grains act as catalysts for chemical reactions in the ISM
Thermal balance of the gas dust grains participate to the heating via the photoelectric effect and
the cooling of the hot gas via inelastic collisions with electrons
Within the cycle of interstellar matter sect 224 and Fig 22 dust is prone to evolutionary
processes being constructive and destructive which lead to an exchange of metals with the gas Dust

5At the end of the 18th century William Herschel made the rst observations of dark nebulae dusty interstellar
clouds It is only at the beginning of the 20th century that astronomers began to consider the absorption and scattering of
light by dusty clouds Today dust particles are known to be ubiquitous in galaxies

supernovae explosions where they experience processing in particular by shock-waves Dust is then
re-incorporated into newly-forming stars out of molecular clouds
In the multiphase ISM of H2-luminous galaxies we also expect dust destruction to occur On
the other hand the presence of dust is required for H2 formation Therefore within the framework
of my modeling of the gas cooling and H2 formation I have been driven to study and model dust
destruction processes I have carried on a detailed calculation of the time-dependent cooling of a
shock-heated dusty plasma taking into account dust destruction This calculation has been published
in the appendix of Guillard et al 2009c hereafter paper I  in the context of the Stephans Quintet
galaxy collision Before presenting these results that may apply to other astrophysical situations we
introduce the properties of interstellar dust that are relevant for dust evolution modeling sect 232
and the physical processes of dust destruction sect 233
232 Dust composition and size distribution
The composition of dust is only loosely constrained by observations The most direct information on
the composition of dust6 comes from spectral features observed in absorption or emission7
Dust extinction and size distribution
The left panel of Fig 24 shows the extinction law absorption plus scattering from the Weingartner
and Draine 2001 model The extinction A which is the ratio of the ux I after crossing the dust
cloud to the incident ux I0 is in terms of magnitude
I  I0 10
A25  I0 e
where   0921 A is the optical depth Observationally the extinction is mostly obtained by
comparing the reddened spectrum of stars to the relevant intrinsic spectrum from a library of spectral
models eg Fitzpatrick and Massa 1990 This gives a relative curve which is usually normalized
to the extinction in some broad spectral bands like B and V For instance A is often divided by the
color excess EB  V   AB  AV or simply by AV like in Fig 24
The extinction curve provides constrains on the size distribution of dust particles Mathis et al
1977 showed that the average interstellar extinction could be satisfactorily reproduced by a grain
model containing two components graphite grains and silicate grains Remarkably the extinction
curve was reproduced very well if both grain components had power-law size distribution so-called
M RN 8 distribution

where dni is the number of grains of the species i which radii between a and a  da nH is the
reference hydrogen nuclei density and Ai is a normalization constant This distribution is truncated at
a minimum grain size amin cid39 50  and a maximum size amax cid39 2500  The right panel of Fig 24

severe selection effects and cannot necessarily be considered representative of interstellar grains
7The amplitude of the radiated electromagnetic eld from small dust particles depends not only on the incident radiation
but also on the size shape refractive index and polarizability of the grain

treatment into the mid- and far-infrared In a more recent study Weingartner and Draine 2001 added
very small carbonaceous grains which play a role in the UV extinction and IR emission Fig 24

Composition of interstellar dust
Interstellar dust grain models have been improved for 30 years in order to t observational constraints
such as elemental abundances of the heavy elements UV visible and infrared absorption and scat-
tering properties infrared emission polarization properties of the absorbed and emitted light The
models include a mixture of silicate grains and carbonaceous grains each with a wide size distribu-
tion ranging from molecules containing tens of atoms to large grains cid38 01 m in diameter that can
be coated with ices in dense clouds Dsert et al 1990 Li and Draine 2001
Immediately following the discovery of the 2175  bump by Stecher 1965 Stecher and Donn
1965 pointed out that small graphite particles would produce absorption very similar to the observed
feature However the presence of crystalline grains is considered unlikely in interstellar space where
grains are exposed to cosmic rays Other forms of carbonaceous grains PAHS amorphous carbons
and organic mantles on silicate grains are being considered
The absorption feature at  97 m is due to interstellar silicate minerals these having strong
resonances near 10 m due to the Si-O stretching mode This conclusion is strengthened by the fact
that a 10 m emission feature is observed in outows from cool oxygen-rich stars which would be
expected to condense silicate dust but not in the outows from carbon-rich stars where silicates do
not form because all of the oxygen is locked up in CO There is also a broad feature at 18 m that is
presumed to be the O-Si-O bending mode in silicates McCarthy et al 1980
The extinction curve is strongly modied when one looks along different directions which probe
the spatial variations of the dust grain properties Some of these variations may correspond to the
coagulation into bigger grains Dominik and Tielens 1997 Stepnik et al 2003 or on the contrary
to some erosion or destruction of grains
233 Dust processing in shocks
I focus here on the dust destruction mechanisms relevant for the calculation of the cooling of a dusty
shock-heated plasma I direct the reader to the review by Jones 2004 and references therein for
an exhaustive presentation of all the destruction processes in the ISM evoked above For a detailed
modeling of dust evolution in shocks please see the PhD thesis of Guillet V 2008
The Fig 25 gathers the mechanisms responsible for dust processing in shocked gas Grain pro-
cessing arises from interactions between the grain and particles grain atom ion atomic nucleus
electron photon They can be destructive ie leading to a transfer of the grain atoms to the gas and
thus to a net mass loss from the grain or non-destructive the grain size distribution being modied but
the total dust mass conserved These processes are counterbalanced by formation like the accretion
and nucleation but also coagulation between grains
Destructive processes destructive interactions can expulse directly atoms and ions from the grain
surface via sputtering ion eld emission9 or direct Coulomb explosion via extreme charging
effects coming from electron-grain interactions or photoelectric effect or vaporizesublimate
the grain in case of cid38 20 km s1 grain-grain collisions Vaporisationsublimation via absorp-
tion of energetic photons UV  or interaction with cosmic rays may also be an important
destruction mechanism for volatile material such as ice mantles

23 Evolution of interstellar dust
Figure 25 Overview of the dust processing in shocksa The mechanisms are ordered as a function
of the impact velocity and separated in two groups those which modify the total dust mass forma-
tion or destruction and those which affect the size distribution while conserving the total dust mass
The small inset gures are from Borkowski and Dwek 1995 and show schematic description of the
processing of refractory grains sputtering craterisation with partial vaporization and catastrophic
fragmentation accompanied with total vaporization On the right of the cartoons the mass distribu-
tion of the fragments is sketched Note that the velocity threshold for coagulation that may lead to
formation of icy and organic mantles depends on the grain size
aThis gure is inspired from a slide of Vincent Guillet
Non-destructive processes Grain-grain collisions at velocities cid38 12 km s1 lead to fragmentation
or shattering of both grains see Fig 25 and Tielens et al 1994 The size distribution of the
fragments is a power-law suggesting that dust fragmentation in shocks is responsible for the
observed power-law MRN in the diffuse ISM By denition fragmentation is not a destructive
process It re-distributes the dust mass towards smaller grains increasing the total cross-section
of the distribution of grains and therefore the optical and UV extinction
In the following I will focus on the sputtering of grains by ion-grain interaction because it is the
dominant destructive process in a hot T  106  108 K plasma eg Draine and Salpeter 1979b

use in our calculation of the time-dependent cooling of a dusty plasma see sect 24 The solid line

dashed line show the exponential form Arrhenius law of Dwek and Smith 1996 that is practical
for analytical calculations Impacts with H He C N and O are considered in the calculations Below
106 K the sputtering of dust grains in a hot gas drops drastically
Sputtering of interstellar grains
Behind a shock gaseous ions impacting on a grain at high velocities will sputter atoms from the
surface layer We distinguish 2 cases of sputtering depending on the nature of the shock and physical
conditions of the environment
 For high velocity Vs  300 km s1 grains are dragged to rest with respect to the gas before the
postshock gas cools and compresses so that sputtering arises from the thermal motion of ions
in the gas It is then the most abundant H protons that dominate this thermal sputtering This
case happens in a hot gas T cid38 106 K for example in the postshock of a supernova-generated
bubble Therefore for Vs  300 km s1 thermal sputtering dominates over inertial sputtering
so we ignore inertial sputtering In this case the grain sputtering rate is nearly constant for
T cid38 3  106 K and strongly decreases at lower temperatures see Fig 26 and Draine and
Salpeter 1979b Tielens et al 1994 Dwek and Smith 1996 The rate of decrease in grain size
through sputtering is given by
Ai cid104Yi vcid105 
23 Evolution of interstellar dust
where msp and g are the average mass of the sputtered atoms and the density of the grain
material Ai the abundance of impacting ion i and Yi is the sputtering yield10 of ion i The
quantity cid104Yi vcid105 is the impacting ion velocities v times the velocity-dependent yield averaged
over the Maxwellian distribution Fig 26 shows the sputtering rates I use in my modeling
These yields are from Tielens et al 1994 Then assuming that the grains are spherical the
rate of grain mass destruction by sputtering ms can be easily calculated from ms  4a2g as
 For low velocity vs  300 km s1 shocks grains are moving at high velocities with respect to
the gas11 The relative gas-grain velocities result in atoms and ions collisions on grain surfaces
These collisions lead to the so-called nonthermal or inertial sputtering If a grain is moving
through a stationary gas all particles incident upon the grain have the same relative velocity
This occurs in shock waves where the gas is rapidly swept up but the dust lags due to its greater
inertia In general the He ions dominate the erosion process Tielens et al 1994 Jones and
Tielens 1994
In the case of inertial sputtering the parametrization of the erosion rate of
the grain is more complex I have followed the empirical approach detailed in Borkowski and
Dwek 1995 to compute the rate of destruction of a grain slowing down in a dusty gas In the
following I give the principle of this calculation
The deceleration of a grain through the gas by collisions with the atoms or ions of the gas can
be written as
  a2  v2
where vg is the grain velocity with respect to the gas m and a are its mass and radius  is the
gas density and  is the enhancement of the collisional drag in a plasma relative to that of a
neutral medium The initial grain velocity is set to 34 of the shock velocity Jones and Tielens
1994 We take   1 which maximizes the dust destruction12 Therefore our computation of
the dust survival is conservative As the grain is decelerating through the gas it also experiences
collisions with the other grains which results in craterization or complete vaporization of the
grain see Fig 25 Along its trajectory the rate of reduction of the grain mass is the sum of
the inertial sputtering and craterization rates

which can be written as fcmg where fc is the fraction of the target grain mass mg that is ejected
in the collision We have adopted fc  01 and Ecr  2 eV for silicate grains see Borkowski
and Dwek 1995 for details
I have described the physical processes that are taken into account for dust destruction and detailed
how I have calculated the evolution of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in the postshock gas This calculation
was based on previous studies Let us now couple this calculation to that of the cooling of shock-
heated gas
24 Time-dependent cooling of a dusty plasma
In the extreme environments of H2-luminous galaxies like the Stephans Quintet galaxy collision
starburst- or AGN-driven winds galaxy cluster cores the warm H2 gas is coexisting with a hot T 
106 K plasma I have computed the time-dependent cooling of a gas that is shock-heated to these
high temperatures Initially the gas is dusty with a Galactic dust-to-gas mass ratio The calculation of
dust destruction detailed above is coupled to that of the gas cooling This calculation is presented in
the appendix of Guillard et al 2009c I briey remind the principle of the calculation and summarize
the main results emphasizing some points that were not stressed in the paper
241 Calculation method
The time-dependent total cooling function is the sum of the dust cooling weighted by the remaining
fraction of dust mass at the time t and the gas cooling contributions From a range of postshock
temperatures up to more than 107 K the isobaric gas cooling is calculated by integrating the energy

2 Gas and dust in galaxies
Indeed at temperature hotter than 
gas is dusty the dust is initially the most efcient coolant
3106 K the dust cooling function blue curve on Fig 27 dominates the gas cooling This produces
a ash of IR emission The duration of this ash depends on the initial gas temperature and dust-
to-gas mass ratio This collisional heating of dust is likely to be responsible for the far-IR emission
in the intracluster medium of galaxy groups see Popescu et al 2000 for a model of dust emission
within the contet of the Virgo cluster
Signicant dust emission from a hot gas does not last forever As discussed in Smith et al 1996
and in Guillard et al 2009c paper I the dust cooling efciency drops with time because of the
reduction of dust mass black dashed line in Fig 27 When the grains are signicantly sputtered the
dust cooling efciency becomes lower than that of the gas This is why the total cooling curve red
line rejoins the gas cooling curve black line As a result the cooling times of the dusty plasma
are signicantly longer than those calculated with a constant dust-to-gas mass ratio see Fig B2 of
paper I Consequently the cooling timescale of the hot gas is longer than the survival timescale of
dust grains see Fig 2 of paper I
Looking at the cooling functions shown on Fig 27 we can see that the reduction of the dust-to-gas
mass ratio in a cooling plasma also favors the development of thermal instability If the dust-to-gas
mass ratio was constant the slope of the total total  dust  gas cooling function would be
almost always positive whereas in the case of dust destruction the total cooling curve has an unstable
part over a wide range of t emperatures between  105  107 K
Note that a signicant dust mass can still remain in the hot gas because very large grains may
survive sputtering in the hot gas These results are in very good agreement with that of Smith et al
1996 whom treat carefully the effect of the dust size distribution but only consider thermal sputter-
ing which is anyway the dominant destruction mechanism for shock-heated plasma by high velocity

The H2 molecule
Some scientists claim that hydrogen because it is so plentiful is
the basic building block of the universe I dispute that I say that
there is more stupidity than hydrogen and that is the basic
building block of the universe
Frank Zappa
Abstract
The hydrogen molecule H2 is the simplest and most abundant molecule in the Universe H2 has
a key-role in many astrophysical processes from galaxy formation in the primordial universe to
star and planet formation As an efcient coolant of the ISM it is an actor of the formation of
cold and dense molecular clouds the fuel for star formation and participates to the formation
of more complex molecules In this introductory chapter we review the basic properties of H2
highlighting its formation mechanisms and excitation processes We also present the tools for
observing molecular gas in space and detail how to derive key parameters of the gas physical
conditions temperature gas masses ortho-to-para ratio etc from observations

3 The H2 molecule
31 Introduction the role of H2 in the Universe
Today molecules are known to be ubiquitous in the Universe with more than 150 different
molecules detected in the interstellar medium henceforth ISM H2 is the simplest one and
the most abundant in the Universe From an astrophysical point of view H2 is an efcient cooling
agent in a large variety of environments which is perhaps the guiding thread of this PhD work
Therefore H2 occupies a central place in astrophysics from large- to small-scale processes It is im-
pressive how such a simple molecule can touch most of the important questions in astronomy In the
following list I briey summarize some of the hot topics where H2 has a word to say
 Stars are made from the gravitational condensation of molecular gas Then H2 can be viewed
as the fuel for star formation Consequently the star formation efciency in standard galaxies
correlates with the mass surface density of H2 gas This translates in a relationship between
H2 and IR luminosities which has been inferred from Spitzer data Furthermore these obser-
vations disclosed the existence of sources with enhanced H2 emission with weak spectroscopic
signatures dust or ionized gas lines of star formation the H2-luminous galaxies presented in
chapter 1 In these galaxies H2 seems to be a tracer of mechanical energy dissipation asso-
ciated with gas accretion galaxy collisions or feedback This is the core topic of this PhD
 H2 was the rst neutral molecule to be formed in the Universe and it had inuenced the collapse
of the rst cosmological objects and thus had an important impact on the energetics of the
formation of cosmological structures and galaxies see chapter 9 and Abel and Haiman 2000
for a short review
 Most of the baryons in the Universe are dark Indeed the mass of observed baryonic matter
stars and gas in galaxies makes up at most 8  of the total mass expected from dynamics
or weak lensing studies Fukugita and Peebles 2004 Although alternative scenarii are being
proposed H2 is now considered as a potential signicant contribution to the problem of missing
baryons in galaxies eg Pfenniger et al 1994 Combes and Pfenniger 1997 Some of the
missing baryons may be in the form of H2 lying beyond the optical galactic disk This gas
would have remained undetected in CO because it is metal poor clumpy or too cold to be seen
in emission First evidence for the presence of warm H2 in the outer parts of galaxies comes
from the detection of H2 S0 and S1 emission with T  80 K in the outer disk of NGC 891
as far out as 11 kpc Valentijn and van der Werf 1999
 For a star to be made the turbulent kinetic energy of the parent molecular cloud has to be dissi-
pated so that the gravity takes over and further condense the gas The ranges of gas temperatures
 1023 K and velocities  1  10 km s1 in the parent turbulent cloud make H2 a major
agent of the dissipation of this energy Once stars have formed they emit jets and winds that in
turn inject some turbulent kinetic energy in their nascent cloud This stellar feedback process
remains largely unexplored Again H2 as a tracer of dissipative processes is certainly a key to
understand what controls the star formation efciency The importance of H2 in star formation
is conrmed by observations of H2 in galactic star forming regions eg Orion in protostellar
molecular outows or infrared luminous galaxies
32 Portrait of the H2 molecule
 H2 is also a major ingredient of giant planet formation Planets are thought to form in the
circumstellar disks that surround proto-stars and pre-main-sequence stars Such disks a natural
outcome of the star formation process are composed of 99  of gas mostly H2 and 1  of
dust H2 is therefore the building block of giant planets H2 dominates the disk mass and
dynamics while the dust is the main source of opacity and controls the thermodynamics of the
disk H2 observations in protoplanetary disks may be used to constrain the scenario of planet
formation which is up to now not well determined
 H2 initiates a complex chemistry within the shielded interiors of dense clouds Some of these
reactions take place at the surface of dust grains and the formed molecules can become con-
stituents of protoplanetary disks where they contribute to the formation of icy planetesimals
such as the comets in our Solar System The richness of molecular chemistry in dense gas is
highlighted by observations of large organic molecules in proto-stellar cores heated by nascent
stars where ices return to the gas and in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars eg
Cernicharo et al 2001 H2 as tracer of the sites of formation of complex molecules may be
a key to elucidate the open question about the connection between molecular species present in
circumstellar environments and those present in the ISM
All these astrophysical questions are closely related to the dynamics and energetics of dense gas
of which H2 is the main consituent To understand why H2 is a probe as such a variety of astrophysical
processes this chapter introduces the basis of the radiative and collisional properties of H2 We will
rely on these properties in the next chapters Part of my PhD work is dedicated to the modeling of
H2 formation and excitation in the extreme environments of H2-luminous galaxies chapters 5 and 9
by mean of shock and chemical network models Flower et al 2003 described in chapter 4 While
going through H2 properties I will give details about how some specic processes are treated in our
shock model In particular we discuss the ortho-to-para ratio of H2 sect 322 and describe H2
formation sect 33 and excitation mechanisms sect 34 This chapter ends with a discussion about
how to observe molecular gas in space sect 35
32 Portrait of the H2 molecule
This section introduces some basic properties of the H2 molecule that are of astrophysical interest We
direct the reader to Shull and Beckwith 1982 for an historical review and to the specialized books
by Bransden and Joachin 1983 and Flower 2007 for a fully developed theory of rotational and vi-
brational excitation of linear molecules In this manuscript we will mainly focus on the rovibrational
transitions of H2 in its electronic ground state denoted1 X 1
321 H2 rovibrational transitions
H2 the simplest molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms linked by a covalent bond H2 is an
homonuclear molecule ie the barycenter of its electrical charges concides with its center of mass So
1The notation is 2S1 where S  0 or 1 is the total electronic spin and  is the projection of electronic orbital angular
momentum on the internuclear axis
3 The H2 molecule
Figure 31 Rovibrational energy level diagram for molecular hydrogen with rotational J states la-
beled The S0 to S7 transitions available to Spitzer IRS observations are indicated with solid lines
All S transitions are from the upper to lower J state with J  2 The v  1-0S1 transition com-
monly observed at 212 m is plotted as a das hed line Note that the S7 transition traces a higher
upper excitation state than the 1-0 S0 and S1 lines commonly observed in the near-infrared Taken
from Hewitt et al 2009
H2 has no permanent dipole moment and rovibrational transitions are forbidden electric quadrupole
transitions Molecular hydrogen thus exists in two different forms depending on the value of its
nuclear spin S
para H2 the S  0 singlet state where the two protons have opposite directions of spin anti-
parallel This corresponds to even values of J
ortho H2 the S  1 triplet state where the proton spins are parallel to each other This corresponds
to odd values of J
The the parity oddness or evenness of the rotational quantum number J is constrained by the fact
that the nuclear wave function must be asymmetric under exchange of protons
Another consequence of the absence of permanent dipole moment is that rovibrational transitions
within the X 1
g electronic ground state occur by electronic quadrupole radiation J  0 2
These quadrupole transitions do not allow to go from one H2 form to another from ortho to para
Because the electronic potential is anharmonic there are no selection rules for vibrational quantum

and  can be expressed as a spring pulsation
where  is the reduced mass here it is half the mass of an hydrogen atom   05mH and k is the

spaced The diagram of Fig 31 shows the level energies of the v  0 and v  1 vibrational states
of H2 with the relevant lines for our study The J  2 state lies 510 K above the J  0 state and
J  3 lies 845 K above J  1 Consequently the rotational excitation of H2 becomes important only
for temperatures T cid38 100 K The v  1 vibration level is  6000 K above the ground state so that
rovibrational excitation such as that at the 22 m line requires kinetic temperatures T  1000 K

for the ortho state
Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium LTE the level populations are pro-
portional to the statistical weight and the Boltzman factor so that the rotational partition function is
written
However because of the low temperature and density conditions in the ISM the LTE hypothesis is
not valid and the populations of the v J levels do not follow the Boltzman distribution
In this manuscript we will mostly focus on the rst pure rotational lines of H2 v  0
Table 31 we list the properties of the main rovibrational lines we will consider These transitions
are within the near- and mid-infrared part of the spectrum A transition is denoted by rst writing
the vibrational transition followed by the relevant branch and the lower rotational level Thus the
transition from v  1 to v  0 J  3 to J  1 is written 1-0S1 More generally the S-branch
corresponds to J  2 the Q-branch to J  0 and the O-branch to J  2 Table 31 also

322 H2 ortho-to-para ratio
Denition and LTE values
The local H2 ortho-to-para ratio hereafter op is the relative abundance of the ground state ortho-
and para-H2 In conditions of LTE this ratio can be written as
LTE T  
32J  1e
EJ kBT 
EJ kBT 
At high temperatures T cid38 300 K the op ratio tends towards the value of 3 which is the ratio of
the statistical weights of all the odd and even levels This is illustrated in Fig 32 where we show
the ortho-to-para ratio as a function of T  At low temperatures T cid46 50 K like in a quiet molecular
cloud only the levels v  0 J  0 1 are populated so that at low T and in LTE conditions the
ortho-to-para ratio can be written
LTE T cid46 50 K 
kBI  1705 K
where we get 2 B
The op ratio is an important astrophysical parameter to characterize the physical state and the
history of the molecular gas The op ratio of a given molecular cloud indeed depends on its age
and on the timescale of para-ortho conversion op If the age of the molecular cloud is longer than
the op conversion timescale the op ratio equals its LTE value at the given temperature Fig 32
Otherwise if the cloud age is shorter than the op conversion timescale the op ratio keeps its value
during the process of H2 formation Our model assumes that H2 molecules are formed with an op
ratio of 3 although this value is poorly constrained The conversion mechanisms are briey discussed
in the following paragraph

Because of the high activation energy of  3900 K this process is negligible in cold molecular
clouds In a cold dark cloud at T  10 K nH  104 cm3 for a typical cosmic-ray ionization

than 107 years to go from an op ratio of 3 to the equilibrium value at 10 K of  3 107 The
conversion timescale is only weakly dependent on density Kristensen et al 2007
However this mechanism can be important and even dominant when molecular gas is subject
to heating and compression by a shock wave Because the reaction 312 is rapid the op ratio
in the hot postshock gas may differ signicantly from the op ratio in the cold ambient medium
The evolution of the op ratio in shocks has been discussed by Wilgenbus et al 2000 For
application of these studies to H2 observations in star forming regions we direct the reader to
the PhD thesis by Kristensen 2007 The reactive collision rates used in the Flower et al 2003
shock model are more complex and are described in Le Bourlot et al 1999

dust grains Tielens and Allamandola 1987 An upper limit of the ortho-to-para conversion

1998 show that this mechanism is inefcient in low-velocity a few 10 km s1 molecular
4 the ortho to para conversion may occur when an H2 molecule is destroyed and then reformed
onto the surface of a dust grain However given that the H2 formation is slow this process is
negligible here
323 Critical densities H2 as a thermometer
The LTE hypothesis is valid when the density of the medium reaches a threshold density so-called
critical density ncrit above which collisionnal deexcitations dominate over radiative deexcitations
For a j  i transition this condition can be written
where Aji s1 is the probability of radiative deexcitation or so-called Einstein coefcient and
qji the probability of collisional deexcitation m3 s1 Aji is proportional to Ej  Ei5 so for
nqji cid29 Aji  ncritqji 
33 H2 formation and chemistry
Figure 33 Critical densities ncrit for the S0 to S7 H2 rotational lines and the 1-0S1 rovibra-
tional line The corresponding upper J levels are thermalized if the gas density is higher than ncrit
The collisional partner is H on the left plot and H2 on the right The critical densities are calculated at
100 500 1000 and 2000 K from Wrathmall et al 2007
high values of J we have Aji  J 5 which shows that the lowest energy levels with smallest J
values are thermalized rst
This is illustrated in Fig 33 which shows the critical densities ncrit at which the probabilities
of collisional and radiative deexcitation are equal for the rst 7 rotational lines of H2 and the 1-
0S1 rovibrational line The collisional partner is H on the left panel and H2 on the right2 At a
given temperature a given level is thermalized if the gas density is higher than ncrit On the other
hand if the gas density is much less than the critical density collisional excitation is followed by
radiative decay and so the collisional excitation rates determine the emission line intensities The
critical densities decrease with temperature because the collision rates also decrease with T  Note that
higher densities appear necessary to thermalize rovibrational not shown here as compared with pure
rotational transitions
The excitation and deexcitation collisional rates of H2 with H we use in our shock model are
discussed extensively in Le Bourlot et al 1999 2002 Wrathmall et al 2007 and we also refer
the reader to the PhD thesis by Gusdorf 2008 for more details and calculations of ncrit with other
collisional partners H H2 He
33 H2 formation and chemistry
In spite of the simplicity of the H2 molecule its formation process in space has been a source of
puzzles since more than 40 years and H2 formation is still an active research topic I summarize here
some of the basic ideas about H2 formation that are crucial to have in mind for the next chapters when
2Note that a similar gure can be found in Roussel et al 2007 but the collision rates used in that paper are outdated
which lead to signicant differences with the critical densities indicated here

H1s  H1s system at large internuclear separation R The singlet and triplet molecular states are
denoted 1 and 3 because the projection of the electronic orbital angular momentum   0 The
1 state is attractive whilst the 3 is repulsive Figure taken from the book by Flower 2007 with
kind permission
we will deal with H2 formation issues in the extreme environments of H2-luminous galaxies
331 H2 formation in the gas phase
We will briey demonstrate that the direct formation H2 with gaseous elements only cannot explain
the observed presence of molecular hydrogen in the ISM The rst process would consist in a radiative
association of two hydrogen atoms
H  H  H2  h 4478 eV
The Fig 34 shows the electronic potential energy curves of an association of two hydrogen atoms as
a function of their distance Initially H atoms are unbound and their total energy E is positive To
stabilize the system must lose energy so that E cid54 0 This formation process would be possible if the
molecule forms in a state that can deexcite to the ground state in order to lose its excess of energy by
the emission of a photon h However Fig 34 shows that a molecule formed by an encounted or two
H atoms may be formed in a repulsive state Transitions between the 3 and 1 levels are forbidden
to electronic dipole radiation because they would involve a change in the total spin quantum number
Rotational and vibrational transitions are also forbidden because H2 has no permanent dipole moment
33 H2 formation and chemistry
Therefore the molecule formed by radiative association can only dissociate H2 cannot be formed by
radiative association of two hydrogen atoms
The formation H2 in the gas phase meaning only with gaseous collision partners cannot occur
through three-body collisions because the probability of a simultaneous encounter between 3 Hydro-
gen atoms is extremely small When a sufciant abundance of electrons and ions exists ion-atom
reactions can be effective Two routes for H2 formation are then possible The H
2 route that is a
radiative association followed by a charge exchange reaction
The alternative route is through H with a radiative attachment followed by a associative detachment
H  H  H
2  H  H2  H
 H  H2  e
These reactions require very high densities comparable to the density of a star to be probable and
contribute signicantly to H2 formation Such processes are likely to be important for the chemistry
of the primordial Universe and we direct the reader to Stancil et al 1998 Galli and Palla 1998 for
more details in particular about the reaction rates However densities in the ISM even in the denser
molecular clouds are too small for this process to be probable
332 The H2 formation on interstellar dust grains
We have shown that the H2 formation in the ISM cannot occur only with gaseous contituants To
overcome this difculty it has been proposed by Gould and Salpeter 1963 Hollenbach and Salpeter
1971 Jura 1975 that interstellar dust grains play the role of catalysts for H2 formation
grain  H  H  grain  H2  Ef 4478 eV
The grain plays the role of the third-body in a three-body reaction The mechanism for H2 through
grain surface reactions is poorly known as well as the distribution of the energy released by the
formation Ef  45 eV among the internal kinetic and grain energy components The part that goes
into H2 internal energy contribute to H2 excitation and we will come back to this point in sect 343
Two main mechanisms exist for the heterogeneous catalysis on a solid
The Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction H2 is formed by physisorption ie through a reaction be-
tween two atoms or radicals that are already adsorbed on the grain surface
The Eley-Rideal reaction H2 is formed by chemisorption ie by the direct interaction of an ad-
sorbed radical with an atom hitting it upon arrival from the gas phase
In both cases the H2 formation rate per unit volume can be written as
RH2  Rf H2  nH  ngr
3 The H2 molecule
where Rf H2 cm3 s1 is the H2 formation rate nH is the gas hydrogen density and ngr is the
number density of grains Empirically the H2 formation rate cm3 s1 is often expressed as
vH  ST   f

cid18 8kBT
 ST   f  
cid28 ngragr
where  is the average cross-section cm2 of the interaction between H atoms and grains vH is the
velocity of H ST  is the temperature-dependent probability that an H atom sticks onto the grain
surface f is the probability that the incident H atom stays on the grain and migrates towards the
other adsorbed H atom and  is the probability of recombination to form H2  is calculated by
averaging the quantity
over the grain size distribution agr is the grain radius It is
generally assumed that the newly-formed H2 molecule has a probability of 1 to be ejected from the
grain because the potential wells of the physisorption  50 meV and chemisorption  1 eV are
much smaller than the energy released by the formation 45 eV
Several expressions have been proposed for the dependence of the sticking coefcient on the
temperature In our model we use the following expression given in Hollenbach and McKee 1979
1  004cid112T  Tgr  2  103 T  8  106 T 2
where T is the kinetic gas temperature and Tgr is the grain temperature
In addition we assume
From UV observations of diffuse interstellar clouds with the Copernicus satellite3 Jura 1975
estimates an H2 formation rate of Rf H2  3  1017 cm3 s1 at T  70 K For more details about
H2 formation and recent estimates of Rf H2 from photo-dissociation regions PDRs we direct the
reader to the the PhD thesis by Habart 2001 and to Habart et al 2004
Note that in cold clouds the dust grains may be covered by ices primarily composed of H2O and
CO whereas in hotter regions such as circumstellar environments or shock-heated gas the icy mantles
evaporate The nature of the grain surface affects the H2 formation rate and an active experimental
work is being done on this topic eg Pirronello et al 1997 Manic et al 2001 Hornekr et al
2003 Amiaud et al 2007
333 H2 initiator of an impressive molecular complexity
We have stated in the introduction that H2 initiates the formation of more complex molecules in cold
clouds Obviously I will not review here the full theory of the formation of heavy molecules in the
ISM see the book by Duley and Williams 1984 for details I will only briey give the tracks towards
this molecular complexity that we observe in the ISM
In fact the formation of molecules more complex than H2 requires the H

formed by cosmic-ray CR ionization of H2 Herbst and Klemperer 1973

Then the way for complex chemistry is open Heavier molecules can form via proton transfer reac-
tions Let us give one example of a chain of reactions which leads to the formation of CO The CO

can be summarized as

 H2O  H

CO is then formed The importance of the CO molecule is stressed in sect 35 and we will come
back to CO emission in Stephans Quintet in chapter 7
34 H2 excitation mechanisms and diagnostics
Excitation of rotation-vibration levels of H2 can occur through different mecanisms which can be
separated in three categories collisional excitation radiative UV pumping excitation or excitation
directly in the process of forming the molecule Obviously it would be impossible to give an exhaus-
tive review about each processes here We summarize the main ideas and classify these processes by
order of relevance for our astrophysical context I also give a few details about the chemical reaction
rates incorporated in the shock model we use in the following chapters in particular chap 4 and 5
341 Collisional excitation and dissociation
H2 levels may be excited by collisions in warm gas and the resulting spectrum is often invoked as
an indicator that shocks are occurring The calculation of the collisional rates is complex because
3 The H2 molecule
it involves detailed quantum mecanics calculations of the interaction potential between the collision
partner and the target For a comprehensice description of the collisional processes in the ISM we
direct the reader to the book by Flower 2007
H2 collisions with atoms or molecules
The most important collisional partners for H2 excitation with atoms or molecules are the light and
most abundant partners H He ortho- and para-H2 that lead to rotational and vibrational excitation of
H2 The cross sections for rovibrational transitions of H2 induced by collisions with H and He atoms
have been discussed in Le Bourlot et al 1999 2002 An update of H2-H collision rates is given
in Wrathmall and Flower 2007 H2-H2 collisions are treated in Flower 1998 For the particular
interest of this PhD work the reader will nd the cross-sections and rate coefcients that are used in
our models for collisional excitation of H2 rotational transitions in the appendices of Flower 2007
Collision with H can also lead to the dissociation of H2 The rate coefcient calculated by Dove
and Mandy 1986 can be tted as a function of the temperature of the neutral uid by the following
form Flower et al 1996

Cosmic-ray ionization of H2
H2 excitation by electrons is a process that occurs in the astrophysical context of the interaction of
cosmic rays or X-ray photons or cosmic rays with molecular gas When X-ray photons or cosmic ray
particles electrons protons and heavy nuclei penetrate into a molecular cloud photoelectrons or
secondary electrons are produced see Padovani et al 2009 for a review Let us consider the direct
ionization of H2 by a cosmic-ray particle electrons protons and heavy nuclei impact
H2  CR  H
The Fig 36 shows the theoretical and experimental cross-sections for the impact of electrons onto
H2 from Padovani et al 2009 The experimental data for electron-impact ionization of H2 have
been reviewed by Liu and Shemansky 2004 The curves show a semi-empirical model developped
by Rudd 1991 Note that the Bethe 1933 cross section for primary ionization of atomic hydrogen
multiplied by a factor of 2 reproduces very well the behavior of the ionization cross section at energies
above a few tens of keV
Collisional excitation of H2 by electrons
The scattering of these photoelectrons or secondary electrons on H2 molecules can lead to thermal
Lepp and McCray 1983 or non-thermal excitation to singlet and triplet electronic states of H2 The
triplet states lead to dissociation but in some fraction of the excitations the singlet states cascade down
3 The H2 molecule
by allowed radiation transitions into the array of rotation-vibration levels of the ground electronic
We will show below that the H2 excitation by thermal electrons can be very important in shocked
molecular gas because of the shock-induced rise of the electron temperature We give a brief review
of the theoretical studies about H2 excitation by collision with thermal and non-thermal electrons and
we give some key-examples of excitation rates incorporated in the shock code we use later The global
properties of the efciencies of H2 excitation by cosmic or X-rays will be addressed in section 342
The rate of production of secondary electrons by cosmic ray ionization of hydrogen is approx-
imately nH2 where  is the cosmic ray ionization rate a few 1017 s1 is a classical value in
molecular clouds and nH2 the number density of H2 molecules Typically  15  of the sec-
ondary electrons subsequently excite H2 molecules by collision Cravens et al 1975 Sternberg et al
1987 Therefore the rate of H2 excitation by secondary electrons is 015nH2
We consider now the H2 excitation by thermal electrons If we denote k1 the rate coefcient for
the excitation of the singlet states then the rate of excitation can be written as nenH2k1Te The
cross-sections for the excitation of singlet states of H2 by thermal electrons are linear as a function of
energy for the dominant B and C states Ajello et al 1984 Flower et al 1996 provide the following
form for the rate coefcient for electron excitation of the B and C states

This is the rate we use in our model for the H2 excitation by electrons In eq 336 we have assumed
that the gas is molecular so nH2  05nH For a gas of density nH  104 cm3 and fractional
ionization nenH  107 the H2 excitation rate by thermal electrons exceeds by a factor 106 the
cosmic ray electrons rate if we assume Te  105 K If Te  104 K the two contributions are com-
parable More generally because magneto-hydrodynamical shocks can easily increase the electron
temperature above 104 K the photodissociation and photoionization of molecular species induced by
a shock wave can greatly exceed the rate of cosmic ray-induced processes Flower et al 1996

the left illuminates a molecular cloud on the right As we penetrate into the XDR we indicate the
approximate temperature chemical composition and ionization fraction xe as a function of the ratio
of the local X-ray energy deposition rate per particule HX to the total hydrogen density nH
342 X-ray and cosmic-ray heating efciencies
The excitation by X-ray photons was quantied by a number of authors eg Voit 1991 Tine et al
1997 Dalgarno et al 1999 Let us estimate the maximum X-ray to H2 luminosity conversion factor
We consider that an X-ray source heats the H2 gas see Fig 37 for a sketch of an XDR by assuming
that 100  of the X-ray ux penetrates into the molecular gas Models of X-ray dissociation regions
XDRs show that 30  40  of the absorbed X-ray ux goes into photoelectron heating Maloney
et al 1996 The atomic photoelectric cross section is a steep decreasing function of the energy
E83 Photoionization in the energy range 1  30 keV are the most important At a temperature of
200 K for the H2 gas the cooling by H2 rotational lines in XDRs models is  2  of the total cooling
see Fig 3a and 5 of Maloney et al 1996 The maximum X-ray to H2 luminosity conversion factor
is therefore
LH2 0-0S0-S3
LX2  10 keV
This estimate will be useful in the next chapter to see whether X-rays can power the observed H2
emission in the extreme environments of H2-luminous galaxies
H2 heating by cosmic-ray ionization
We estimate the molecular heating associated with cosmic-ray ionizations see sect 341 for a de-
scription of the process Each ionization of a hydrogen molecule is associated on average with
401 eV energy loss by electrons of which 11  ends up as heat Dalgarno et al 1999 This gives a
heating energy of 4 eV per ionization This is the value adopted in the Meudon PDR code Le Petit

3 The H2 molecule
et al 2006 If we add the energy associated with the recombination of H
3 that may follow the H2
dissociation another 8 eV is released per recombination Maloney et al 1996 Thus each ionization
of a hydrogen molecule is associated with the deposition of 12 eV into the gas In the CLOUDY4
gas code last described by Ferland et al 1998 the heating efciency increases with the ionization
fraction of the gas For an ionization fraction of 104 a classical value for the diffuse ISM Shaw
et al 2005 the heating energy per H2 ionization is  7 eV  As the ionization rate per hydrogen
nucleus is half the H2 ionization rate H the heating rate per hydrogen nucleus nH is  14 eVH

343 Excitation during the H2 formation process
During the H2 formation process on grain surfaces see sect 332 the binding energy of H2 
45 eV or 51 000 K is released and partitioned among the grain internal heating kinetic energy of
the ejected H2 gas heating and internal energy in H2 ie the molecule is formed in a rovibrationally
excited state Therefore H2 excitation can also occur directly during the process of its formation
How is the H2 binding energy divided between the constituents What is the internal energy
distribution What the ortho-to-para ratio of the newly-formed molecule In spite of many theoretical
work and experiments eg Hornekr et al 2003 Amiaud et al 2007 all these questions remain
In our model we choose to distribute the H2 binding energy with equipartition one third of the
formation energy 14927 eV or 17249 K goes into internal energy of H2 and levels are populated
in proportion to the Boltzmann factor at a temperature of 17249 K Another third goes into kinetic
energy and the last third goes into grain heating In our model we assume that the H2 molecule is
formed with an ortho-to-para ratio of 3
Several surveys of cold dark clouds have been performed to observe directly the H2 excitation by
formation but so far without results see Tin et al 2003 and references therein
344 Radiative excitation of H2 UV pumping
When a UV source is present for instance in Photo-Dissociation Regions PDRs H2 may be ex-
cited rovibrationally by rst being UV-pumped to an electronically excited state Black and Dal-
garno 1973 Black and van Dishoeck 1987 via the Lyman and Werner transitions within the range
912  1110 see also Hollenbach and Tielens 1997 for a review about dense PDRs The excited
molecule will then deexcite uorescence back into vibrationally excited levels of the ground elec-
tronic state If the densities are not too large nH  ncrit  1045 cm3 these levels will cascade
down through rovibrational transitions The corresponding UV spectrum has been calculated by Stern-
berg 1989 This uorescence occurs with a probability of  90  If nH  ncrit the collisional

34 H2 excitation mechanisms and diagnostics
deexcitation of H2 contributes to heat the gas In  10  of the electronic excitations the molecule
will dissociate because the absorption of a UV photon is followed by a cascade towards rovibrational
levels of the ground electronic state
345 H2 excitation diagrams
Excitation diagrams are a way to represent the SED of the H2 emission that provides a practical visu-
alization of the physical conditions of the emitting medium We detail how one builds an excitation
diagram and we give canonical examples within the context of H2 emission in shocks
Building excitation diagrams
Excitation diagrams plot the logarithm of the column densities of the upper H2 rovibrational levels
v J divided by their statistical weights lnNvJ gJ  against their excitation energies EvJ kB
expressed in K The column density is expressed in cm2 The statistical weight gJ  gs 2J  1
is the product of the nuclear spin statistical weight gs which has value of 1 and 3 for even and odd
rotational levels J respectively and the rotational statistical weight which is 2J  1
Such diagrams are very useful to get a rst idea of the temperature conditions that exist in the
emitting gas If one assumes that a given line is optically thin to H2 emission one can calculate the
gas column density N from the observed brightness of the line I The probability for spontaneous
emission is given by the Einstein A-coefcient The measured H2 line intensities IvJ are converted
into column densities NvJ as follows
AvJ IvJ
where  is the central wavelength of the line transition AvJ the transition probability Einstein co-
efcient for the rovibrational level v J h is Plancks constant and c is the velocity of light in the
To estimate whether the assumption that the line is optically thin we may calculate the optical
depth  for a transition j  i between an upper j and lower i level
where v is the linewidth dispersion velocity and gj gi are the degeneracies of the upper and lower
levels respectively For the v  0-0 S1 transition we nd

Therefore the assumption that the line is optically thin to H2 emission is fullled for most of the
situations in the ISM
Column densities can then be compared with those expected from thermal excitation The method
is the following one In a thermal distribution NvJ is proportional to the statistical weight g of the
kBTexc  where EvJ is the excitation energy of the respective level
level and to the Boltzmann factor e

roughly estimate the temperature conditions in the emitting gas
From an observational point of view deriving the excitation temperature is a rough estimate of
the temperature conditions in the considered region With this diagram deviations from LTE can be
easily be probed Generally multiple temperature ts are done corresponding to several excitation
temperatures
In a shocked medium this reects the distribution of temperatures involved in the
postshock medium

35 Observing H2 in space
351 Direct H2 observations
The rst detection of H2 beyond the Solar System was made by Carruthers 1970 through absorption
spectroscopy of UV light with a rocket-borne UV spectrometer This discovery was followed by
UV observations with the Copernicus space mission that demonstrated the presence of the hydrogen
molecule in diffuse interstellar clouds for a rst review on this subject see Spitzer and Jenkins
1975 and references therein These observations revolutionized our understanding of the origin of
astronomical objects
A decade later Gautier et al 1976 detected H2 in emission for the rst time through near-infrared
rovibrational lines from a massive young stellar object in the Orion Nebula This demonstrated the
importance of H2 in dense environments as well However because of lack of sensitivity such obser-
vations remained of limited scope over the next three decades Today the near-infrared rovibrational
transitions are routinely imaged from ground-based telescopes
The H2 mid-infrared rotational transitions which trace warm  1023 K molecular gas must be
observed from space see Fig 39 right panel Indeed the Earths atmosphere is mostly opaque to the
mid-IR lines of ortho and para H2 For the transitions occurring at wavelengths where the atmosphere
is partially transparent the thermal background from the warm telescope its spectrometer and the sky
limit the sensitivity The H2 infrared lines were observed by ISO and Spitzer with limited imaging
capabilities and low spectral resolution The next future  2015 of mid-IR H2 observations will the

On a longer timecale the SPICA mission5 Swinyard et al 2009 an actively-cooled Herschel-like
telescope would be capable of doing MIR and FIR spectroscopy at high spectral resolution with an
unprecedent sensitivity

selected unfortunately
352 CO a proxy for H2
The bulk of the molecular hydrogen in a galaxy is cold 10  20 K too cold to be seen in emission
This is why the presence of cold H2 is inferred essentially from carbon monoxyde CO observations

3 The H2 molecule
Figure 39 Cold and warm molecular gas are observed with two different kinds of observatories
Cold molecular gas is essentially derived from CO ground-based observations with single-dish radio-
telescopes or interferometers On the other hand the IR emission from warm H2 must be observed
from space This gure shows a few examples past present and future of these observatories with
their basic characteristics wavelength coverage spatial and spectral resolution
CO is the most abundant molecule after H2 Its dipole moment is small 01 Debye so CO is easily
excited The emission of the CO1-0 line at 26 mm corresponding to its rst level at 552 K is
ubiquitous in galaxies
The CO lines mainly 1-0 at 115 GHz and 2-1 at 230 GHz are observed with radiotelescopes
see left panel of Fig 39 being single-dish or interferometers During my PhD I have made use of
the IRAM 30m single-dish telescope The high spectral resolution of radiotelescopes provides crucial
information about the molecular gas kinematics which in general cannot be inferred from mid-IR H2
line observations alone because of limited spectral resolution
In order to derive the cold H2 masses we generally assume a xed CO luminosity to H2 mass
conversion factor the so-called X  N H2ICO factor where N H2 is the column density of H2
and ICO the integrated CO line intensity Several methods are employed to derive the X factor see

Abstract
H2-luminous galaxies appear to be in active phases of their evolution galaxy collisions galaxy
cluster cooling ows starburst- or AGN-driven winds etc see chapter 1 that release a large
amount of kinetic energy in the interstellar medium  Shocks are thus expected to be ubiquitous in
these media and may account for a signicant if not dominant part of the powerful H2 emission
observed in these sources Consequently I have been driven to study H2 emission in shocks
and use MHD shock models to interpret these observations This has been done rst within the
context of the Stephans Quintet galaxy collision chapter 5 and 6 and is being extented to other
astrophysical objects chapter 9
In this chapter I present the necessary background on the
physics and chemistry of MHD shocks as well as a few results extracted from the grid of shock
models I have built to interpret the observations Then the discussion is extented to shocks in
inhomogeneous media I focus on two situations the evolution of a shocked dense cloud and
the collision between two gas streams The physical processes that control the evolution of the
shocked gas will be discussed as well as recent results for numerical simulations

41 Introduction
Shock waves are ubiquitous in the interstellar matter settled in galactic disks but also in the inter-
galactic medium They are produced by violent pressure disturbances such as star- or AGN-driven
jets and winds supernovae explosions collisions between molecular clouds or at larger scales be-
tween galaxies
A shock wave is an overpressure region that propa-
gates in the uid at a supersonic velocity These shock
waves accelerate heat and compress the gas This conden-
sation may lead to star formation as it is the case for giant
shock waves propagating in the spiral arms of a galaxy On
the other hand shocks may have destructive effects on the
molecular clouds thus quenching star formation as it is
perhaps the case in AGN jets driven in the ISM of their
host galaxy
Shocks have an important impact on the evolution
of the interstellar medium ISM from a dynamical but
also from a chemical point of view By heating the gas
shocks driven into molecular clouds initiate chemical reac-
tions that would not occur in peaceful cold molecular gas
These chemical processes play a role in the thermal bal-
ance of the shock which in turn has an impact on the gas
dynamics
H2 appears to be a dominant coolant of MHD shocks
H2-luminous galaxies chapter 1 are be precisely in some
of the energetic phases of strong dissipation of kinetic en-
ergy quoted above Therefore a large part of my modeling
work of the dissipation of mechanical energy involves the
physics and chemistry of shocks
In the multiphase environment of these H2-luminous
galaxies different types of shocks are expected Fast
shocks heating the gas to high T  106  108 K pro-
duce EUV and X-ray photons that photoionize the tenuous
medium These shocks are one source of energy that pro-
duce the HIM1 in galaxies On the other hand low-velocity
shocks typically cid46 50 km s1 are known to i initiate the

formation of molecules in the gas that cools behind the shock eg Hollenbach and McKee 1979 and
ii be a very efcient process to excite molecules especially H2 via collisions in the dense gas com-
pressed and heated by the shock
To interpret the H2 observations presented in chapter 1 I have been driven to study the formation
of H2 during the cooling of a shock-heated gas and H2 excitation in magnetohydrodynamical MHD
shocks driven into dense molecular gas
I have used the Flower et al 2003 shock model a 1-
D2 MHD code coupled to a extensive network of chemical reactions to build a large grid of shock
models for different values of key parameters such as the shock velocity the pre-shock density the
magnetic eld etc In particular the results of the modeled emission of molecular hydrogen whose
treatment is included inside the shock code to the observations
For a review about the physics and chemistry of interstellar shocks I direct the interested reader
to Draine 1980 McKee and Hollenbach 1980 Chernoff 1987 Hollenbach and McKee 1989
Draine and McKee 1993 Hartigan 2003 For a comprehensive and didactic presentation of hydro-
dynamical and MHD shocks the reader will consult the PhD thesis in french by Guillet V 2008
I assume that the reader is familiar with the basic properties of hydrodynamical shocks in which the
magnetic eld is absent B  0 This chapter rst focuses on the basic properties of MHD single-
uid or multi-uids shocks sect 42 I present the shock code and the grid of shock models I use in
the following chapters sect 43 and mainly discuss H2 cooling in MHD shocks sect 433 Then I
extend the discussion to shocks into multiphase media I describe the evolution of a cloud embedded
in a tenuous gas that is overrun by a shock wave from a theoretical and numerical simulation point
of view Finally I consider the collision between two gas stream and point out the main differences
between 1-D and 3-D models
42 Magnetohydrodynamic MHD shocks in an homogeneous medium
In the presence of a magnetic eld ubiquitous in the ISM the shock wave satises not only the
equations of the uid dynamics but also the Maxwells equations The magnetic eld does not interact
the same way with charged and neutral particles which can result in a decoupling of the charged ions
and electrons and neutral uids Indeed the magnetic eld modies directly the dynamics of the
charged particles3 ions electrons or grains whereas it affects only indirectly the neutrals through
collisions with the positive ions and electrons Therefore the magnetic eld and the ionization
fraction of the gas have thus an important impact on the structure of shock waves
Before discussing the structure of MHD shocks I shall recall the basic properties of the types of
MHD waves that can propagate in a plasma
421 Waves propagating into a plasma
In a magnetized plasma different types of waves can propagate at distinct velocities
2One dimension
3For instance if the magnetic eld is oriented parallel to the shock front the Lorentzs force will make the particles
girate around the magnetic eld lines thus leading to a coupling of the charged uid to the magnetic eld
4 Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Sound waves are longitudinal compression waves that propagate pressure disturbances at a speed
where  is the adiabatic index the heat capacity ratio with   53 for a monoatomic gas and
  75 for a diatomic gas T is the gas temperature and  is the mean molecular mass4 in
atomic mass unit amu
Alfvn waves are transverse waves that propagate the distortion of the magnetic eld lines along these
lines Alfven 1950 Alfvn waves are thus incompressible dispersionless waves The neutral
species can propagate Alfvn waves because of their coupling to the charged uid The Alfvn
speed of these waves are thus
for the neutrals and V c
for the charged uid 
where n and c are the mass density of the neutral and charged ions electrons grains uids
respectively
Magnetosonic waves are longitudinal compressible dispersionless waves that propagate pressure
variations in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic eld lines The propagation of these
waves involves variations of the strength of the magnetic eld In the neutral uid most of the
gas mass the magnetosonic speed is
4n cid39
In the charged uid magnetosonic waves can propagate at a speed
4c cid39
4c cid29 V n
In a typical molecular cloud c  102n because the dust grains are charged So V c
In the following I will only consider stationary shocks where the structure of the shock density
temperature proles in the reference shock frame do not evolve with time In addition the direction
of the magnetic eld is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave or parallel to the
shock front In this case the magnetic eld limits the compression of the gas at a maximum efciency
since the uid cannot ow along the magnetic eld lines

42 Magnetohydrodynamic MHD shocks in an homogeneous medium
422 C- and J- type shocks
Depending on the intensity of B and the ionization fraction of the gas we distinguish between two
types of MHD shocks C- and J-types
J-shocks if the B is weak or absent or if the ionization fraction of the gas is high the collisional
coupling between charged and neutral particles is strong These particles behave like a single
uid coupled to the magnetic eld The properties of these shocks are similar to that of the
hydrodynamical shocks Across the shock front the variables pressure density velocity etc
change abruptly see the top plot of Fig 41 The transition region which scale is of the order
of the mean free path is much narrower than the other dimensions in the gas This transition
is treated as a discontinuity where the change of the variables of the gas is discrete J being
for Jump The preshock and postshock values of the gas density pressure and temperature are
related by the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions see sect 422
C-shocks if the magnetic eld is present and the ionization fraction low typically xe  107108
in dense nH  103  104 cm3 molecular clouds the neutral and charged uids are decoupled
from each other These shocks are named multi-uids or Cshocks Mullan 1969 1971 C
being for Continuous because in this case the discontinuity is smoothed and the gas parameters
vary continuously across the shock front see details below and Fig 41
Structures of C- and J-shocks
The Rankine-Hugoniot relations are conservations laws between any points behind and ahead of the
shock front They do not give any information about the internal structure of the shock This structure
depends on the strength of the magnetic eld and the ionization fraction of the gas and has a direct
impact on the characteristics of the excitation of species in the shock in particular H2 This is why
I briey discuss here the Fig 41 which shows schematically the structure of a stationary shock as a
function of the preshock strength of the transverse magnetic eld
As shown in Eq 44 in a molecular cloud of density nH  104 cm3 and ionizing fraction
  105  109 magnetosonic waves propagate faster in the charged uid than the shock front
Typically for this medium we have
cs cid46 V n
A and V c
A  Vs cid28 V c
where cs is the sound speed Vs is the shock velocity V n
A being the Alfvn speed for the
neutral and charged uids respectively So if the strength of the magnetic eld is high enough the
information can be transported ahead of the shock by the charged uid and a so-called magnetic
precursor appears This precursor slows and compresses the charged uid of the preshock gas before
the arrival of the shock front on spatial scales much larger than the mean free path This magnetic
precursor decouples the neutral and charged uid generating ambipolar diffusion The resulting
friction between the uids heats mostly the charged uid The variables of the charged uid are
continuous across the shock front whereas those of the neutral uid are discontinuous Such a shock
is called J-shock with magnetic precursor This is the case c of Fig 41
4 Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Figure 41 Schematic structure of the velocity of a stationary shock wave in poorly ionized medium
as a function of the local magnetic eld strength B0 B0 increases from top to bottom The velocities
are given in the frame where the shock front is idle Vn is the neutral velocity in the propagation
direction of the shock Vi that of the ions and electrons The preshock medium is on the left hand side
of the shock front the postshock on its right hand side L is the shock length and Vims is the ions
magnetosonic speed given by Eq 44 the dust grains are ignored in this model Taken from Draine
If the magnetic eld is more intense the magnetosonic speed further increases and the length
of the magnetic precursor L too The exchanges of momentum and energy between the neutral
and the charged uids in the precursor are more important and the neutral uid itself is likely to be
heated compressed and slowed before the arrival of the shock front through elastic collisions with
42 Magnetohydrodynamic MHD shocks in an homogeneous medium
the charged uid Because of this slowing down the neutral uid also undergoes a velocity jump of
a smaller amplitude than in the situation where there is no magnetic eld This is the case d in
When the magnetic eld strength is higher than a critical value Bcrit the ow of the neutral uid
becomes continuous across the shock front The discontinuity vanishes and the shock turns into a C
shock case e in Fig 41
Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for an adiabatic MHD shock
The jump conditions across an MHD shock or discontinuity are referred as the Rankine-Hugoniot
equations for MHD Before giving these equations let us recall some thermodynamical relations and
denitions We denote by cP and cV the specic heats of the gas at constant pressure and volume
respectively The adiabatic index is dened by   cPcV In the case of a perfect gas the pressure
P density  and temperature T are connected by the classical equation
where R  831 J K1 mol1 is the universal gas constant  is the mean molecular mass in atomic
mass unit amu and mH is the mass of an hydrogen atom For an adiabatic evolution the additional
relation holds
where K is a constant Apart from a constant the entropy of a perfect gas is dened as
S  cV log
cid18 P
We place ourselves then in the reference frame of the shock the surface discontinuity is at rest
and we take the sufxes 1 and 2 to refer to the preshock and postshock regions respectively The jump
conditions are obtained by developing the conservation laws for mass momentum and enthalpy5
with the few relations above see eg the book by Shu 1991
1v1  2v2
where v the velocity of the ow in the reference frame of the shock  the mass density and P the
thermal pressure of the gas The term B28 is the magnetic pressure that is added to the thermal
pressure in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic eld lines The terms P  1 and B24
are the specic enthalpy6 and the magnetic energy respectively The conservation of momentum
5Because of the pressure forces on the uid element the enthalpy fux is conserved not the energy ux
6entropy per unit volume
4 Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Eq 410 can also be viewed as the conservation of the sum of the ram pressure v2 and the thermal
pressure P
We remind that the preshock respectively postshock ow is supersonic resp subsonic in the
reference frame of the shock front In this frame the gas appears to be decelerated Knowing the
Rankine-Hugoniot relations and considering the relation dening the entropy for a perfect gas see
above Eq 48 one can show that the entropy increases during the shock if and only if P2  P1
ie whenever a shock can form eg Zeldovich and Raizer 1966 It follows that all transverse shock
waves lead to compression of the gas In the reference frame of the preshock medium a uid parcel
that crosses the shock front is compressed P2  P1 accelerated and heated T2  T1 by the work
of the pressure forces applied by the postshock gas just behind the shock front
Frozen magnetic eld
In the interstellar medium the characteristic time of diffusion of the magnetic eld is generally much
longer than the characteristic time of advection One can therefore assume that the eld is frozen in the
charged uid The charged grains are also coupled to the magnetic eld because their slowing-down
time in the shock is longer than their timescale of gyration around the magnetic eld lines Pineau des
Forets et al 1997 For a one-dimension 1D transverse shock the jump relations for the magnetic
eld are the following
The compression of the magnetic eld follows that of the charged uid
Compression rate and postshock temperature
Roberge and Draine 1990 gives the compression factor of the gas
D2  4  12  M
D    1  2M
where Ms  Vsc1 is the sonic Mach number Vs being the shock velocity velocity of the shock front
in the reference frame of the preshock medium and c1 the sound speed in the preshock gas MA is
the Alfvn Mach number MA  VsVA
For a single-uid MHD shock the postshock temperature and thus the postshock pressure can
be expressed as a function of the compression factor   21 Roberge and Draine 1990
More generally in case of hydrodynamical shocks B  0 or single-uid MHD shocks the
physical preshock and postshock quantities can be expressed as a function of the pressures P1 and P2
or as a function of the Mach number of the shock Ms see Landau and Lifshitz 1959 Roberge and
Draine 1990
43 Modeling MHD shocks in molecular gas
43 Modeling MHD shocks in molecular gas
My interpretation work of H2 emission in H2-luminous galaxies has involved the use of a sophisticated
shock model developed by David Flower Guillaume Pineau des Forts and Jacques Le Bourlot The
rst paper describing the code is Flower et al 1985 and the most recent developments are published
in Le Bourlot et al 2002 Flower et al 2003 Flower and Pineau des Forts 2003
I run a grid of shock models that I use to t the observations see chapters 5 6 and 9 In this
section I present illustrative results for C and J shock models and focus on molecular emission
especially H2 in C shocks which are relevant for our study
431 The Flower et al code and the grid of shock model
In a few words this 1-D7 code integrates8 the dynamical and chemical rate equations together with
those for the level populations of the rovibrational levels of the electronic ground state of H2 In my
grid of models I use 137 chemical species connected by a set of 1040 chemical reactions The code
can be used to model hydrodynamic shocks or transverse MHD shocks C- or J-type
The code has been described extensively in many papers and PhD thesis so I will not repeat this
description in this manuscript The interested reader will consult Flower et al 1985 for a rst de-
scription of the equations solved by the code and to the PhD thesis by Guillet V 2008 for a detailed
formulation of these equations closer to the current version of the code For a description of the treat-
ment of H2 in the code please see Flower et al 1986 Le Bourlot et al 2002 and the PhD thesis
by Gusdorf et al 2008 for comparison of the model predictions with observations of proto-stellar
outows and a description of other chemical aspects For the treatment of dust grains see Flower
and Pineau des Forts 2003 and Guillet V 2008 Guillet et al 2009 for the implementation of a
sophisticated module that treats in details the dynamics and evolution of the dust
Hypothesis
In this section I consider MHD shocks without radiative precursor ie the shock velocities are low
enough typically Vs cid46 80 km s1 in molecular gas Hollenbach and McKee 1989 Shocks with
radiative precursor will be considered later in sect 44 In the following I list a few important features
and assumptions used in the MHD shock model I have been using
Stationary shock the model assumes that a stationary state is reached in the 1D ow at velocity
vnz neutrals velocity in the z-direction so that ddt  vnddz The ow time t of the
neutrals is thus related to the distance z by the relation
cid90 1
The following results often present the physical quantities as a function of the ow time

Preshock magnetic eld we adopt the classical scaling relation for the preshock magnetic eld
strength

where b is the magnetic scaling factor and nH the preshock hydrogen density nH  nH 
2nH2 This expression is in agreement with the Zeeman effect observations of galactic molec-
ular clouds that lead to B  n047008
Crutcher 1999 This observational result seems to be
in agreement with numerical simulations of the condensation of molecular clouds under the ef-
fect of ambipolar diffusion Fiedler and Mouschovias 1993 Hennebelle et al 2008 although
the densities considered in these studies prestellar cores are much higher than those we con-
sider here For the following illustrative results we adopt b  1 for C-shocks and b  0 for
J-shocks no magnetic eld
For C-type shocks the gas is treated as 3 uids consisting of neutral species positively and
negatively charged species We assume that the transverse magnetic eld remains frozen into
the charged uid of the preshock gas all through the shock see sect 422
H2 is treated in a detailed manner in the code The excitation mechanisms taken into account in
the model as well as associated hypothesis have been presented in chapter 3 We remind that
collisional excitation with H H2 and He is included When an H2 molecule forms on the surface
of a grain we assume that the binding energy of H2 is distributed with equipartition between
heating of the grain kinetic energy of the newly-formed H2 molecule and internal energy of
Dust grains are assumed to be composed of olivine-like material same stoechiometry as MgFeSiO4
The size distribution is assumed to be the MRN Mathis et al 1977 distribution dngada 
a35 where dnga is the density of grains having a radius between a and a  da The radius
is taken to be in the range of 10  300 nm The total mass density including mantles of the
grains is taken to be 85  103  14 nHmH where 85  103 is the dust-to-gas mass ratio
The grain temperature is not calculated in the models but remains constant at a user specied
value Here we use 15 K The rate coefcients for charge transfer with grains is also taken into
account into the model allowing for the grain charge distribution to be calculated for each step
of the model
In the version I use gas-grain collisions are also taken into account Flower and Pineau des
Forts 2003 which may lead to sputtering of icy mantles and grain cores It is possible to
release the grain core elements Mg Fe Si and O into the gas phase through sputtering Sput-
tering yields are given in May et al 2000 It is an important process both in J- and C-type
shocks In J-type shocks the high kinetic temperature ensures that sputtering is an efcient
process while in C-type shocks it is due to the velocity difference between neutral and charged
species
An articial viscosity is added to the terms of momentum and energy in the case of J-shocks This
allows rather than applying the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions at the shock discontinuity
to integrate and resolve the discontinuity

Description of the grid of models
I have run a grid of C- and J- shock models by varying the shock velocity preshock density magnetic
scaling factor initial H2 ortho-to-para ratio and dust-to-gas mass ratio This grid was primarily
designed to interpret the H2 observations in the Stephans Quintet galaxy collision where we expect
signicant dust destruction chapters 5 and 6 Note that the output also includes atomic lines such as
the intensity of the far-IR O I 632 m line to be observed with the Herschel Space Telescope The
Table 41 lists the range of physical parameters of the grid of shock models
The initial abundances of the 137 species are determined before any shock model calculation
by running a chemical steady-state model where we do not include adsorption on grains to avoid
complete freezeout of molecules onto grains The output abundances of this chemical steady-state
model are then used as input abundances in the shock models
I do not give here a complete review of all the model results of the grid but I rather comment a few
examples The comparison with observations is presented in the following chapters For a description
of an other extensive grid of models the interested reader may consult the PhD thesis by Kristensen
In the following illustrative results I have used the initial elemental abundances of Flower and

Pineau des Forts 2003 listed in Table 42 These abundances are those given by the output of the
steady-state calculation The initial repartition of the chemical species in the grain mantles can be
found in Table 2 of Flower and Pineau des Forts 2003 The preshock medium is molecular gas at
nH  104 cm3 The cosmic-ray ionization rate is the standard value   5  1017 s1
Impact of the chemistry on the shock structure
Fig 42 illustrates the impact of the chemical processes on the shock structure Chemistry plays a
role in the thermal balance of the shock which in turn impacts the number of reactions the shock can
initiate and the reaction rates Fig 42 shows the difference of the results obtained with or without
taking the chemistry into account
without chemistry the ionization fraction varies only through the differential compression of the
ionized and neutral uids by the shock wave and has the same value in the preshock and
postshock regions
with chemistry the ionization degree of the postshock in one order of magnitude lower This is
essentially due to the neutralization of C into C initiated by H2
followed by a chain of reactions which balance is
C  H2  CH  H
Consequently the ion-neutral coupling is weaker hence broadening the size of the precursor
the width of the shock is  5 times larger Since the energy is dissipated on a larger region
43 Modeling MHD shocks in molecular gas
Figure 43 Contributions of the kinetic thermal internal and magnetic energies as a function of the
ow time for J- left and C-shock right both at Vs  25 km s1 The two shocks have the
same total energy The preshock medium is molecular at a density nH  104 cm3 The preshock
magnetic strengh is B0  100 G for the C-shock and B0  0 for the J-shock The magnetic eld is
perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the shock
as compared to the rst case the maximum temperature is lower here approximately twice
This shows that chemistry and hydrodynamics are coupled and have to be treated in parallel
Dust grains through gas-grain interactions have also an important impact on the physical and
chemical properties of the shock They participate to the formation or removal of molecules of the
gas and their inertia can modify the propagation of the shock9 especially in the case of C-shocks
Some details about the nature and treatment of the grains in the model have been given in sect 431
A detailed review of the processes involving grains taken into account in the code as well as their
impact on the structure of C-shocks can be found in Flower and Pineau des Forts 2003 For detailed
calculations of the evolution of the dust size distribution in MHD shocks please consult the PhD thesis

433 Energetics and molecular emission in shocks
In this section a few results from my grid of models are presented
Energy budgets
Fig 43 compares the energy budgets for two types of shocks C and J of the same energy In the
reference frame of the shock front the energy of the preshock gas is pure bulk kinetic energy In
the hydrodynamic case J-shock with B0  0 when the gas crosses the shock front most 1516
of the bulk kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy Then at t  104 yr on the left panel
of Fig 43 the shock dissipates its energy in radiation form collisional excitation of species in the
shock followed by radiative deexcitation
9The mass of the dust grains makes the bulk of the mass of the ions
4 Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
In C-shocks the thermal energy stays low as compared to other forms of energy The reason is that
the dissipation of energy is not instantaneous and occurs over a timescale comparable to the cooling
time through radiation The heating of the neutral gas is due to inelastic collisions with the charged
uid Unlike hydrodynamic shocks part of the postshock gas energy is stored as magnetic energy
This magnetic energy can even dominate the postshock energy budget for very low-velocity shocks
 7 km s1 for nH  104 cm3 The internal energy corresponds to the excitation of molecules
essentially H2
Temperature velocity and abundance proles
Fig 44 compares two shocks of same energy one J- and one C-shock The proles show some
important physical quantities across the shock as a function of the ow time The reference frame
is the shock front On the left colum we show J-shock prole with no magnetic eld On the right
column we show C-shock proles with a preshock B0  100 G The models are the same than
those used to make Fig 43 In both cases the shock velocity is Vs  25 km s1 and the preshock gas
density nH  104 cm3 To facilitate the comparison the y-axis are the same for both shocks The
x-axis has been extended to much shorter ow times for the J-shock as the physical quantities start
to vary much faster than for C-shocks
The top panel of Fig 44 shows the temperature of the neutrals and velocities of the neutrals Vn
and the charged species Vi in the case of the multi-uids shock As discussed in sect 422 see also
Fig 41 the gas is slowed down abruptly when crossing the shock front whereas in C-shocks the
charged uid and then the neutrals by friction slow down progressively
In C-shocks the energy is dissipated over a longer timescale than in J-shocks which implies that
the maximum temperature attained in C-shocks  2000 K here is much lower than in J-shocks
 30 000 K For strong Ms cid29 1 shocks with B  0 the postshock temperature is given by see

where Vs is the velocity of the shock wave  the mean molecular weight kB the Boltzmann constant
and  the adiabatic index   75 in a fully molecular medium in which the internal rotational
degrees of freedom are thermalized In the second member of Eq 420 we indicate typical values for
shocks driven into molecular gas Thus we assume   233 amu and   144 since we take into
account the presence of atomic Helium10 with a fractional abundance nHenH  01
The middle panel of Fig 44 shows the evolution of the fractional abundances of a few important
species H2 O H2O H H in the shock The J-shock is fast enough to dissociate H2 45 eV
but not enough to ionize signicantly H 136 eV H2 molecules reform over a short timescale in the
postshock cooling gas which releases energy in the gas and induces a small knee at  300 K on
the temperature prole
Unlike J-shocks C-shocks do not generate signicant dissociation of molecular hydrogen as
shown on the proles of the fractional abundances11 The most active molecular chemistry takes
10instead of   14 for a pure H2 gas
11The fractional abundances shown here are dened relative to hydrogen nXnH

4 Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Figure 45 Contribution of the main coolants to the total cooling function as a function of the gas
temperature for 25 km s1 J- left and C- right shocks The models are the same than in Fig 43
and 44 The gas is cooling from the left to the right of the plots from the maximum postshock
temperature to 10 K
place within these shocks as the temperature jump is high enough to trigger endothermic chemical
reactions without disrupting the involved molecules Therefore I shall concentrate on C-shocks
Note that depletion of gaseous species onto dust grain surfaces in the postshock region reduces the
abundances of some of the newly formed molecules This affects the thermal balance of the shock
This is clearly seen for the cooling rates proles of the J-shock where cooling efciency of all the
molecules drops at about t  3  103 yr because of adsorption onto dust grains
Both kinds of shocks generate an intensive grain processing that is still the subject of studies
Flower et al 2003 Guillet et al 2007 and depletion onto dust grain surfaces in the postshock
region This depletion reduces the abundances of some of the newly formed molecules
Cooling functions and main coolants
We now discuss the radiative properties of the shock The bottom panel of Fig 44 shows the local
cooling rates of the main coolants relevant for our study as a function of the ow time Fig 45
shows these cooling efciencies as a function of the temperature of the cooling postshock gas More
generally the main coolants are O H2 H2O C OH CO Their relative contributions to the cooling
depend on the shock prole and determine the radiative properties of the shock which are very
different in J and C shocks
For J-shocks the cooling is rst dominated by H2 over very short period of time at high tem-
peratures where it experiences dissociation Then at  8000 K the O I6300  line takes over
When the gas has cooled down sufciently H2 H2O O and C dominate the cooling More pre-
cisely at T  1000 K the ne-structure line O I632 m dominates Other important lines in this
temperature range are C I N I5200  C II158 m N II1218 m S II6731  and Fe II
At lower temperatures the oxygen is converted into CO H2O and OH which become the dominant
coolants
For C-shock H2 is the main coolant for T  300 K which is the excitation range of the mid-IR
43 Modeling MHD shocks in molecular gas
Figure 46 Integrated line uxes as a function of shock velocity for J- left and C- right transverse
shocks The models are the same than in Fig 43 and 44 preshock density nH  104 cm3 The
integrated line uxes are calculated after a cooling down to 50 K
rotational lines in which we are interested for our study Remarkably the cooling is dominated by
H2O emission at T  200 K
Line uxes
The Fig 46 shows the integrated down to 50 K line intensities as a function of shock velocity
for the two types of shock C and J Note that in J-shocks the higher H2 rotational excitation
levels like the corresponding upper levels of the S5 and S7 lines are populated efciently for low-
velocity shocks For J-shocks of velocities such that 25  Vs  40 km s1 the integrated intensities
are roughly constant with shock velocity whereas for C-shocks line uxes increases smoothly with
shock velocity
Note that the O I 63 m and 145 m lines are good tracers to distinguish between the two types
of shock see Fig 46 These lines are particularly sensitive to low velocity Vs cid46 20 shocks where
their intensities are much higher for MHD shocks than for pure hydrodynamical shocks B0  0
Examples of H2 excitation diagrams for C- and J-type shock models
The Fig 48 shows theoretical H2 diagrams for our two shock models see chapter 3 sect 345 for
the denition and calculation of the diagram This diagram is computed at a temperature of 50 K in
the postshock gas If the gas temperature is below 50 K almost no H2 emission is produced The
integrated H2 line intensities at 50 K are converted into column densities using Eq 339 I only show
on the plot the rst 8 rotational levels relevant for our study corresponding to the upper levels of
the S0 to S7 transitions plus three rovibrational levels corresponding to the upper levels of the
4 Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Figure 47 H2 excitation diagram for 25 km s1 C- and J-shocks The preshock medium is molecular
at a density nH  104 cm3 The preshock magnetic strengh is B0  100 G for the C-shock and
B0  0 G for the J-shock The rst 8 rotational levels of H2 corresponding to the upper levels
of the S0 to S7 transitions plus three rovibrational levels corresponding to the upper levels of
the 1-0S0 1-0S1 and 2-1S1 lines these are the 3 blue points at the bottom of the plot for the
C-shock showing that pure rotational levels are not thermalized with rovibrational levels
1-0S0 1-0S1 and 2-1S1 lines The characteristics of these lines have been given in chapter 3
Table 31
This gure illustrates the impact of the type of shock on the excitation of H2 For the C-shock
the rotational lines are much brighter than for the J-shock because the temperature is lower and the
shock is broader thus increasing the column density of emitting gas see the bottom panel of Fig 44
The high temperatures reached in the J-shock favor the ro-vibrational lines Note that if the J-shock
velocity further increases the dissociation of H2 will be so important that the ro-vibrational excitation
will be much weaker
To conclude MHD low-velocity shocks driven into molecular gas are very efcient in channelling
the kinetic energy of the shock into the rotational H2 lines This characteristic is essential within the
framework of my interpretation of H2 emission in H2-luminous sources
I have used these diagrams to characterize the excitation characteristics in H2-luminous objects
such as the Stephans Quintet and the 3C326 radio galaxy This will be discussed in details in chap-
ters 5 6 and 9 Flower et al 2003 Giannini et al 2004 2006 provide examples of celestial sources
proto-stellar outows Herbig-Haro objects for which use was made of such excitation diagrams to
describe both the type of shock that is occuring and the physical parameters in these regions
43 Modeling MHD shocks in molecular gas
Figure 48 Evolution of the H2 ortho-to-para ratio and temperature in blue labeled on the right for
a 25 km s1 C-shock Two initial values of the op ratio are shown the Local Thermodynamical
Equilibrium LTE value at 10 K 35  107 and the high-temperature limit 3 The preshock
medium is molecular at a density nH  104 cm3 The preshock magnetic strengh is B  100 G
perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the shock
Evolution of the H2 ortho-to-para ratio in C-shocks
So far the initial H2 ortho-to-para ratio is assumed equal to the statistical equilibrium value of 3 in our
shock models I also adopt this value in the following chapters because the H2 excitation diagrams
observed in Stephans Quintet or in the 3C326 radio-galaxy do not show any signicant departure
from this value which would result in a systematic displacement of the ortho with respect to the para
levels zig-zag pattern
However we have shown in chapter 3 sect 322 that the LTE value of the op ratio is 35 107
at T  10 K and 003 at T  30 K To justify the high value of the initial op ratio I briey
discuss the timescale of H2 op conversion in shocks This point has been discussed in more details
by Wilgenbus et al 2000 and Kristensen et al 2007
Fig 48 illustrates the evolution of the H2 op ratio in a 25 km s1 C-shock for two initial values
of the op ratio 35  107 the LTE value at 10 K and 3 high-temperature limit In the case of
the low initial value the interconversion between para- and ortho-H2 starts when the temperature is
rising and excepted within the rst 103 years the evolution of the op ratio is similar for both cases
The timescale of thermalization of the H2 op ratio is long  4 106 yr in this case which is in good
agreement with Eq 310
As a result if the molecular gas experiences multiple shocks and if the time interval between two
shocks is smaller than the H2 op conversion timescale the op will not have time to thermalize to the
low equilibrium value in the cold H2 This may be the case in the H2-luminous objects I have studied
Note that there are objects that favor a low initial op value like proto-stellar bipolar outows for
4 Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
instance Wilgenbus et al 2000
The initial value of the H2 ortho-to-para ratio has an impact on the H2 line brightnesses Generally
speaking the lower the initial op ratio the lower the brightness is This impact is a timescale effect
and is more important in C-shocks than in J-shocks The fact that the ortho-H2 levels cannot begin to
be populated until the temperature reaches  800 K causes a delay This delay is responsible for the
lower brightness in transitions between ortho-levels at low initial op ratio Inversely the brightness
from transitions between para-levels is higher for low initial op ratio
44 Fast shock models
So far we have mostly discussed low-velocity shocks driven into dense molecular gas that power
molecular emission These shocks are well traced through rotational line emission of H2 Obviously
much faster shocks are likely to occur in the violent environments of H2-luminous galaxies Within
the framework of understanding their multi-wavelength observations I have been driven to use an
other shock model that describes fast shocks with radiative precursor This section briey discuss the
properties of these shocks very different from the shocks discussed above
441 Structure of a fast shock with radiative precursor
Fig 49 schematically illustrates the structure of the fast shocks we now consider In fast shocks the
shocked medium emits UV of soft X-ray radiation that propagates in all directions including that
of the preshock gas This UV emission produces a radiative precursor that heats dissociates for
Vs cid38 90 km s1 and ionizes for Vs cid38 120 km s1 the preshock gas before it is shocked see
Hollenbach and McKee 1989
442 The MAPPINGS shock model library
In my PhD work I have made use of the shock model library named MAPPINGS III described in
Allen et al 2008 which is an updated version of the MAPPINGS II code described in Sutherland and
Dopita 1993 I do not give a complete review of this model Here I only present a short description
of the basic properties and underlying physics included or not included in the model The theory of
fast photoionizing shocks is described in Sutherland and Dopita 1993 Dopita and Sutherland 1995
1996 I also direct the reader to the complementary book by Dopita and Sutherland 2003
Modeling technique
Shocks with radiative precursor are difcult to solve numerically because
1 the UV radiation inside the shock imposes to carry on radiative transfer calculations to compute
the ionization state of the gas as well as the excitation state of the species in the shock
2 the shock has a feedback effect on the preshock gas in which it propagates Therefore one
cannot integrate the shock structure meaning integrate the MHD and chemical rate reactions
starting from any point in the preshock
44 Fast shock models
Figure 49 Stationary prole of a shock with radiative precursor in the reference frame of the shock
front In this reference frame the preshock gas comes from the left at a high speed and is slowed
down in the shock front bottom compressed middle and heated top The radiative emission of
the postshock gas produces a radiative precursor that heats and ionize the gas ahead of the shock
Taken from Draine and McKee 1993
The MAPPINGS 1-D code couples an MHD shock code to a radiative transfer photoionizing
code At each time step of the integration of the dynamical conservation equations in the ow the
rate equations for non-equilibrium ionization recombination excitation and radiative transfer and
cooling are solved at each time step of the ow A total of four iterations shock integration followed
by calculation of the precursor are performed to allow the temperature and ionization state of the
precursor gas to stabilize at a constant value
The physics included in the code
The cooling and radiative emission is calculated using a very large atomic data set 16 atoms which
allows treatment of all ionization stages 225 ions up to fully ionized nickel
 The atomic processes affecting the ionization balance of the plasma taken into account in the
code are photoionization ionization by electron collision charge transfer reactions and various
forms of recombination channels including radiative and dielectronic recombination
 Radiative processes includes ne-structure inter-system and forbidden emission as well as
resonance transitions and continuum calculations Fine-structure inter-system and resonance
lines are approximated by a two-level system The model assumes that the resonance lines are
4 Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
primarily excited by collisions The continuum calculations includes free-free free-bound and
two-photon processes
 Additional heating and cooling processes including recombination and Compton heating are
integrated over the electron thermal distribution or the photon spectral distribution
Physically the ionizing radiation produced in the cooling zone behind the shock front shock is
mostly composed of thermal bremsstrahlung free-free continuum resonance lines bound-free con-
tinuum of hydrogen and the strong hydrogen two-photon continuum produced mostly by the down-
conversion of Ly  photons trapped in the recombination region of the shock structure Recombina-
tion lines and bound-free continuum from Helium and heavier elements are also contrinution to the
ionizing radiation of the precursor
The hydrogen ionizing radiation ux LUV integrated for all energies h  136 eV and over
2 sr follows the following scaling relation Allen et al 2008
LUV  244  10
which is almost scaled as nHV 3
What is not included shortcomings
cid19302cid16 nH
100 km s1
 Dust grains are ignored in these models The shocks propagate in a dust-free gas However we
have seen in sect 43 that grains have an important impact on the structure and thereby on the
emission of MHD shocks The main difference is that in fast  200 km s1 shocks the dust
destruction is expected to be very efcient As shown in chapter 2 sect 24 if the postshock
temperature is hotter than  106 K dust grains may affect the initial stages of the cooling of
the postshock gas and thus the structure of the shock However their cooling efciency will
drop rapidly because of thermal sputtering
 Molecules are not included although the computation of the shock structure is allowed to
proceed until the gas has cooled to 1000 K Therefore the cooling functions are valid for
T cid38 104 K
The shock model library is available online12 In my PhD work I have used this library to produce
diagnostics of mid-IR ne-structure line ratios in order to contrain the physical properties of the ion-
ized gas in the Stephans Quintet Examples of line ratio diagnostics and comparison to observations
are discussed in chapter 6
I have also used these shock models to obtain a synthetic ionizing spectrum to model the emission
from dust that would be heated by this radiation This modeling has been performed within the context
of the Stephans Quintet and this is discussed in chapter 8

45 Shocks propagating into an inhomogeneous medium
45 Shocks propagating into an inhomogeneous medium
So far we have considered the ideal case of a shock that propagates in an homogeneous medium
However as introduced in chapter 2 the interstellar or intergalactic media have a multiphase and a
self-similar structure The interaction of shock waves with density inhomogeneities I will call them
clouds in the ISM is thought to be an important dynamical process in a multiphase medium eg
McKee and Ostriker 1977 As discussed in chapter 2 it contributes to mass exchange between
the dense and diffuse phases On one hand it may trigger gravitational collapse and star formation
eg Elmegreen and Scalo 2004 On the other hand shocks may have a net destructive effects on
molecular clouds suppressing star formation
Chapter 5 and Guillard et al 2009c paper I discuss the formation and excitation of H2 in the
context of the Stephans Quintet galaxy collision where observations indicate that these processes
may be the response of a multiphase medium to a galactic-scale shock It would be impractical to
give an exhaustive review of the abundant litterature on such a vast topic
I will rather focus on
two situations that are relevant for the context of H2-galaxies but also in many other astrophysical
environments the evolution of a cloud hit by a strong shock wave sect 452 and the supersonic
collision between two gas streams of different densities and velocities sect 453 Before describing
these two situations and the associated physical processes I shall recall a few properties of a shock
wave that encounters a discontinuity of density
451 Reexion and transmission of a shock through a discontinuity
When the propagation medium in which the shock wave is going through changes the shock wave
may enter
1 a denser medium a reected shock wave is driven back into the postshock ow of the incident
wave A shock wave is transmitted into the dense medium and the initial discontinuity is
accelerated This case is schematically presented in Fig 410 The reected and transmitted
postshock gas separated by the contact discontinuity are in pressure equilibrium
2 a less dense medium or a medium that moves in the same direction of the shock a rarefac-
tion wave is reected into the postshock gas of the incident shock and a transmitted shock is
produced The contact discontinuity is also accelerated
In the following I shall consider the case 1 illustrated in Fig 410 I take the sufxes i and
c to refer to the inter-cloud and cloud media If the age of the incident shock is much shorter than
its cooling timescale adiabatic shock McKee and Cowie 1975 estimate that the velocity of the
transmitted shock into the cloud Vc is of the order of 13

Vc cid39
where Vi is the shock velocity in the inter-cloud medium and nc and ni are the densities of the cloud
and intercloud medium respectively The ratio between the densities in the two media is  
13This approximate relation is obtained from the conservation of the kinetic pressure V 2 More detailed expressions are
given in Klein et al 1994a

nH  nc The incident shock wave propagates in the tenuous inter-cloud medium ni cid28 nc The
incident shock is transmitted into the cloud and reected into the inter-cloud medium because of
the abrupt density contrast The initial contact discontinuity remains and is being accelerated at a
velocity Vcd in the direction of the propagation of the incident shock wave The postshock media of
the reected and transmitted shocks are in pressure equilibrium and propagate at the same velocity
Note that if the shock is isothermal ie
if the shock has cooled down through radiation sig-
nicantly to reach the preshock temperature and if the incident shock is fast enough such that

452 Evolution of a shocked molecular cloud
I will now introduce the relevant timescales for the description of the evolution of a cloud that is run
over by a fast shock wave illustrated in Fig 410 How does the shock wave propagate inside and
outside the cloud What happens to the cloud This section rst adresses these questions both from
an analytical and numerical point of view
This problem has been extensively studied by means of numerical simulations which is the only
quantitative way to study the development of instabilities that are produced when the ow of back-
ground gas establishes around the cloud and interacts with it The 2D dynamical evolution of such a
cloud has been described in many papers and I direct the interested reader to Klein et al eg 1994a
Mac Low et al eg 1994 Poludnenko et al eg 2002
It is important to realize that the evolution of a shocked cloud does not only depend only on the
dynamics but also on its thermal and radiative properties Thermal and radiative properties are just
being explored in multi-dimensional numerical simulations and have been largely neglected in the
past I will briey discuss these recent numerical results
I shall consider here the case of a spherical cooling cloud of radius Rc and mass density c 
mHnc The cloud is initially in pressure equilibrium with the inter-cloud medium background gas
The density contrast between the two media is   ci  1 The evolution of the shocked cloud
consists of three phases
1 Initially the shock runs over the cloud The time scale for this is the shock passing time

where Vi is the velocity of the passing shock in the inter-cloud medium
2 The second phase is the compression phase in which the cloud nds itself inside the high
pressure cocoon
It is now underpressured compared to its environment Shock waves are
transmitted into the cloud and start to travel into it from all sides The timescale for the cloud
compression is named the cloud crushing time and is simply given by

100 km s1
where Vc is the velocity of the shock travelling into the cloud which can be calculated from
Eq 422 see sect 451
3 The third phase starts when the transmitted shocks have passed over the cloud During this phase
the cloud is subject to both Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities Meanwhile
during phases 2 and 3 the radiative cooling of the cloud impacts the evolution of the gas which
may also become thermally unstable These processes lead to a fragmentation of the shocked
cloud and the fragments may end up mixed with the inter-cloud gas Taking a rst qualitative
look at Fig 411 one can clearly see the effect of fragmentation on the shocked cloud
4 Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
In the following I discuss the key physical processes introduced above that control the evolution
of the shocked cloud and its fragments
Cloud acceleration and growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities The growth of the Rayleigh-
Taylor instability15 is related to the acceleration of the cloud by the postshock background gas The
acceleration timescale is the amount of time it takes to accelerate the cloud gas to the velocity of the
postshock background Let us write the momentum transfer from an inter-cloud gas owing by a
spherical cloud of cross-sectional area R2
c  at a relative velocity Vpsi The postshock force acting
on the cloud can be written
where I have assumed the jump condition psi  4i with   53 Then the acceleration timescale
is given roughly by tacc  ViFMc Mc being the mass of the cloud We nd that

The above equation show that it is very difcult to couple dynamically dense gas with a background
ow of tenuous gas The crushing time to acceleration time ratio is tcrushtacc  34 which shows
that as soon as the density contrast is higher than  102 the cloud will be compressed on a timescale
much shorter than the acceleration time The growth timescale of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities is given
by tRT  a k12 where a is the acceleration of the cloud and k  1 is the wavenumber of the
perturbation Chandrasekhar 1961 In our case a  Vitacc so we obtain
tcrushk Rc  tcrush 
Perturbation wavelengths such that k Rc  1 are the most disruptive16 so we conclude that Rayleigh-
Taylor instabilities develop on a timescale comparable to the crushing timescale and more than one
order of magnitude shorter than the acceleration timescale for  cid38 100
Growth timescale of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities A similar analysis can be applied to derive the
growth timescale of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities17 tKH For a high density contrast  cid29 1
15The Rayleigh-Taylor instability after Lord Rayleigh and G I Taylor is an instability of an interface between two
uids of different densities which occurs when the lighter uid is pushing the heavier uid As the instability develops
downward-moving irregularities dimples are quickly magnied into sets of inter-penetrating Rayleigh-Taylor ngers
The upward-moving lighter material is shaped like mushroom caps This phenomenon is clearly visible in the Crab and
Helix nebulae

As Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities growth on a timescale comparable to
the cloud crushing time
To sum up if we assume an adiabatic evolution of the gas the timescales calculated above suggest
that the cloud is destroyed over a timescale comparable to the compression timescale or crushing
time Destruction is enhanced by the fact that the shocks travelling into the cloud meet and interact
or reach the opposite boundary of the cloud This produces a rarefaction wave travelling through the
shocked cloud material The cloud which was compressed by the hot cocoon now starts expanding
again This increases the pressure contrast between the compressed cloud and the postshock external
gas effectively accelerating the growth of destructive instabilities
Impact of the magnetic eld on the evolution of the shocked cloud Because of the coupling
between the magnetic eld and the cloud material the magnetic eld may have strong effects on the
cloud evolution and on the development of instabilities This effect is subtle because it depends on
the local orientation of the magnetic eld in the inter-cloud medium
If the background medium is magnetized then magnetic eld lines can become trapped in defor-
mations on the surface of the cloud As these eld lines are stretched the magnetic pressure along
the leading edge of the cloud can increase enough to accelerate the disruption of the cloud through
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability Gregori et al 1999 On the other hand tangled magnetic elds
within the clouds would act to resist compression potentially reducing cooling and enhancing cloud
destruction by shocks
The left panel of Fig 411 shows the results of two 3D MHD simulations one being for a weak
magnetic eld the other for a strong one Shin et al 2008 The effect of the magnetic eld seems
important only in the late stages of the evolution of the cloud This gure illustrates that at late times
strong elds substantially alter the dynamics of the cloud suppressing fragmentation and mixing by
stabilizing the interface at the cloud surface Even weak magnetic elds can drastically alter the
evolution of the cloud compared to the hydrodynamic case
In addition the topology of the magnetic eld has a strong impact on the thermal conduction for
clouds in hot  106 K gas because in this case the conduction is carried on by the electrons see
the discussion about the thermal conduction below Indeed the magnetic eld channels the electron
conductivity along the eld lines
Impact of the cooling of the cloud and thermal instability The above conclusion that clouds
are destroyed in a time comparable to the cloud crushing time is drastically changed if the cloud is
able to cool through radiative processes over a timescale tcool shorter than the dynamical timescale
of destruction tcrush Mellema et al 2002 Fragile et al 2004 Mellema et al 2002 dene a
cooling-dominated regime by tcool  tcrush

radiative processes A simple estimate of the cooling time Fragile et al 2004 leads to the following

Heating and cooling processes may generate thermally unstable gas in the cloud see Fig 23
or later in Fig 413 The thermal instability adds to the Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities and is an important fragmentation mechanism The thermal instability has been discussed
in chapter 2 sect 225 Below  106 K the gas is thermally unstable Numerical simulations
show that the thermal instability generates complex inhomogeneous structures dense regions that
cool and low density voids Sutherland et al 2003 Audit and Hennebelle 2005 This fragmentation

occurs on the gas cooling timescale In most numerical simulations the thermal instability is ignored
because simplifying assumptions are made on the equation of state of the gas adiabatic isothermal
or polytropic evolution
The lifetime of the fragments in the hot gas depends on their ability to cool An efcient gas
cooling stabilizes the clouds As H2 is a major coolant in the warm molecular gas it may have an
important impact on the survival of molecular clouds hitted by strong shocks This is illustrated in
the right panel of Fig 411 that shows numerical simulations of multiple clouds overtaken by a shock
wave that takes into account the radiative properties of the clouds as well as primordial gas-phase
formation of H2 These simulations show that the cloud rst breaks into fragments Because of the
cloud cooling these fragments become dense enough to be able to survive over a timescale of the
order of a few million years Mellema et al 2002 Fragile et al 2004
These numerical simulations ignore in particular the H2 formation on grains which may greatly
enhance the cooling efciency of the cloud provided that dust can survive the transmitted shock If it
is the case the cloud fragments may be even further stabilized
Thermal conduction and evaporation timescale The heat conduction has an important and subtle
impact on the evolution of the shock cloud Depending on how the heat ux is treated and whether
cloud cooling is included heat conduction may or may not lead to the evaporation of the cloud frag-
The heat ux is carried by electrons in hot or ionized gas and by H in cold or warm neutral gas
This heat ux is proportional to the temperature gradient Fouriers law
which denes the thermal conductivity18  In case of a steep temperature gradient between the cloud
and intercloud medium the heat ux is limited by the ability of the electrons or H atoms to diffuse
across the boundary If the spatial scale of the temperature variation is smaller than the mean free path
of the electrons the heat ux saturates and its value can be reduced up to a factor  10 as compared
with the classical heat ux given by Spitzer 1962 The saturation of the conduction thus reduces the
evaporation of the cloud Cowie and McKee 1977
In the case of saturated heat ux the rate at which the cloud evaporates can be written analytically

where i and ci are the mass density and sound speed in the inter-cloud medium One can dene an
evaporation timescale
 tcrush
which shows that for   102 the clouds will evaporate in a time comparable with the compression
timescale cloud crushing time
18The mean free path of the specie that carries the heat ux determines the temperature dependence of the thermal
conductivity   T 52 for electron conductivity and   T 08 for H Note that the charge transfer reactions strongly limits
the H mean free path Thereby ionization reduces conductivity in partially ionized warm gas
4 Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Vieser and Hensler 2007a performed numerical simulations of static clouds embedded within a
hot gas taking the saturated heat ux The main result is that the evaporation timescale is at least one
order of magnitude longer than the analytical value given by Eq 437 The reason is that a transition
zone forms at the cloud edge in which the steep temperature and density gradients are reduced This
results in a lower evaporation rate than predicted
Simulations that include both thermal conduction and radiative cooling and heating processes
show an even more dramatic effect The clouds can even gain material if radiative cooling exceeds
the energy input by heat conduction Vieser and Hensler 2007a show that matter from the hot inter-
cloud medium can condensate onto the clouds in a regime of cloud parameters where evaporation
is requested from the analytical approach The reason is that the additional energy driven by heat
conduction from the hot background gas into the cloud can be transported away from the interface
and radiated off efciently from the inner parts of the cloud
Turbulent mixing Another important mean to transport the energy from the hot background gas to
the cool medium is through mixing of gas phases at boundary layers This mixing is expected to occur
wherever there is a velocity shear is present at the interface of cloud phases A schematic description
of such a boundary layer is given in Fig 412 Such velocity shears occur in many astrophysical
situations including outows of hot gas driven into the ISM by supernovae explosions starburst or
AGN but also galaxy mergers etc
A turbulent mixing layer at the boundary of the cloud develops through the growth of Kelvin-
Helmholtz instabilities that drive transverse waves along the boundary between the two uids The
energy of these waves is dissipated at small scales and a layer of gas at intermediate temperatures
is produced at the interface see Begelman and Fabian 1990 Slavin et al 1993 The intermediate
temperature T in the turbulent mixing layer is determined by the temperatures of the hot Th and
cloud Tc phases the evaporation rate of the cold gas into the intercloud medium
mc and the
entrainment rate of hot gas into the mixing layer mh
mhTh  mcTc
where  is a dimensionless factor of the order of unity see Begelman and Fabian 1990 Typically
for warm T  104 K clouds embedded within a hot T  5 106 K the temperature of the mixing
layer is Tmix  10555 K
The intermediate-temperature gas may be thermally unstable and any dynamical disturbance will
cause the gas to rejoin the hot or warm phase see Fig 413 This length of the boundary layer is
obtained by assuming a stationary mixing layer in which the energy ux input by turbulent motions
is balanced by the cooling rate per unit area
The right panel of Fig 412 illustrates the situation of a cold neutram medium CNM cloud
embedded within a stream of hot gas The two sub-panels compare the results with our without
thermal conduction These simulations have been performed by J Slavin private communication
When thermal conduction is ignored right the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are developped The
comparison between the two gures clearly shows that the conduction reduces the growth rate of
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities When conduction is taken into account the evaporative outow pre-
vents instabilities from developing at the interface with the ow With conduction the cloud is less

discussion of the impact of thermal conduction on the evolution of a cloud embedded in hot gas
453 Supersonic collision between two gas streams
Let us consider now the collision between two gas streams at different densities and velocities This
situation may be relevant in the case of galaxy collisions where the ISM of the galaxies are colliding
with each other I briey discuss the plane-parallel situation which can be solved analytically and
move to a brief discussion of numerical simulations that provide some useful feeling about how the
gas and shocks behave in such collisions
Plane-parallel collision between two gas streams
We consider the situation of Fig 414 Two plane-parallel ows of preshock densities 1 and 2 are
colliding at t  0 which produces the contact discontinuity CD Fig 414 shows the situation where

ambient pressure is 3660 K cm3 No thermal conduction is included in these simulations
place ourselves in the case where the two ows are identical ie 1  2   1 The case presented
in Fig 414 is more general The corresponding equations for the general case can be found in Lee
et al 1996 Since the pressure and velocity are continuous across the surface discontinuity we have
P3  P4 
and v3  v4  vCD 
where vCD is the velocity of the contact discontinuity For this simplied case the bulk kinetic energy
to thermal energy conversion rate can be written as
which is the largest value attained for   53 when the two colliding ows are identical The fact
that R is greater than 1 is not surprising Since the postshock gas is at rest in the lab frame all the
bulk kinetic energy of the gas that passes through the shock is converted into thermal energy But the
shocks move outward from the discontinuity so R is actually the ratio between the shock velocity
relative to the upstream ow in region 1 to the shock velocity v1 which is 43 for   53
We will now consider the similar situation of the collision between two gas streams but from the
point of view of 3D simulations This allows to point out the main differences between the 1D and

postshock kinetic energy
3D simulations of an oblique collision between two gas streams
Fig 415 shows the result of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the oblique collision between two gas
streams These simulations are performed by Lee et al 1996 within the context of the collision
of gas streams produced by the disruption of a massive star around a black hole Obviously these
simulations do not directly apply to the SQ collision in particular because in the simulations the
gas ows are homogeneous and radiative processes are ignored However these simulations provide
interesting insights about the dynamical evolution of the ows and the geometry of the shock fronts
produced by the collision
The pressure map left panel of Fig 415 shows that oblique shocks are produced around the
initial contact surface The position of these shock fronts are indicated on Fig 415 by the solid red
arrows In the case of a one dimensional 1D collision of two stream at the same velocity vst the
two shocks produced at the discontinuity surface propagate back to the upstream ows at a velocity

is  vst and the shock fronts stand off near the initial contact surface because the shocked gas can
escape in the direction perpendicular to the stream ow For instance if we assume two identical gas

properties of the shocked gas are very different between 1D and 3D models
454 Concluding remarks and limitations of existing codes
The modeling of shocks in inhomogeneous media is very complex and this is due to the richness of
the physical processes at work listed above and the fact that they almost all operate on a comparable
timescale Here I would like to stress some key processes that one cannot ignore when describing the
survival on shocked molecular gas as it is one key aspect of the study presented here
So far most of the 3D numerical simulations focus on the development of hydrodynamical insta-
bilities and the effect of the magnetic eld They generally predict the complete destruction of clouds
by fast shocks in a timescale comparable with the compression crushing timescale of the cloud This
is essentially because these simulations do not include a realistic treatment of the thermal properties
of the shocked gas including H2 formation on dust and H2 cooling On the other hand models that
are used for the comparison with observations in which chemical processes are included are limited
to 1D geometry Here I summarize a few important points among which some of them remain largely
unexplored in numerical simulations
1 thermal processes have a very important impact on the fate of shocked gas perhaps more im-
portant than the effect of the magnetic eld The thermal instability so far ignored in numerical
simulations triggers gas cooling and thereby stabilizes the cloud phase Both cooling and
thermal conduction seem to limit evaporation of cold and dense gas embedded in the hot and
tenuous postshock medium In the case of molecular gas H2 as a main coolant of the gas may
be a key-actor In addition the production of thermally unstable gas in turbulent mixing layers
at the cloud-intercloud interface may also help in balancing the evaporation with condensation
of material from the hot to the warmcold phase
2 the 3D geometry also inuences the dynamical and thermal properties of the shocked gas One
should keep in mind that 1D models assume a maximum compression of the gas by the shock
leading to a maximum conversion of the bulk kinetic energy of the shock to thermal energy In
3D this conversion may be less efcient This is perhaps the main limitation of the models that
I have been using the Flower et al and the MAPPINGS shock codes to interpret observations
All the effects listed above would tend to increase the lifetime of shocked clouds compared to pure
hydrodynamical simulations

Powerful H2 emission from the Stephans Quintet
galaxy-wide shock
Life is a series of collisions with the future it is not the sum of
what we have been but what we yearn to be
Jose Ortega y Gasset
Abstract
The Stephans Quintet SQ is a compact group of interacting galaxies and a spectacular ex-
ample of H2 luminous source The Spitzer Space Telescope indeed detected a powerful mid-
infrared H2 line emission from the X-ray bright galaxy-wide shock created by the high-velocity
 1000 km s1 collision between a galaxy and the tidal tail of an other member of the group
Observations show that the H2 gas is extremely turbulent and that the H2 luminosity exceeds that
of the X-rays The core of my PhD work is dedicated to the interpretation and modeling of these
observations In this chapter I present the observational discovery of H2 in the shock and address
the following question Why is H2 present in such a violent environment I propose a scenario
where H2 forms out of shocked gas and present my results on the modeling of the cooling of the
multiphase postshock gas and associated H2 formation

51 Introduction
Stephans Quintet hereafter SQ is a fascinating example of an interacting galaxy system Fig 62
Perhaps not as famous as Arp 220 or M82 SQ is a well-known astrophysical target for amateur or
professional astronomers It is a nearby 94 Mpc compact group of galaxies situated in the Pegasus
constellation at about half a degree to the South-West of NGC 73311 SQ has been observed in almost
all wavebands and it keeps revealing surprises when being looked at by new instruments SQ belongs
to a peculiar class of interacting systems of galaxies the compact groups Hickson 1982 that are
characterized by aggregates of more than 4 galaxies in implied space densities as high as those in
galaxy cluster cores
SQ is a complex web of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-intragroup medium henceforth IGM interac-
tions that have triggered different types of phenomena related to the interactions including an IGM
starburst long tidal tails  100 kpc with tidal dwarf candidates and a large scale shock  40 kpc
long This shock is materialized by a giant X-ray and radio-bright ridge attributed to the collision of
an intruding galaxy with the tidal tail of another member of the group
In 2006 Spitzer Space Telescope observations revealed a powerful mid-IR H2 rotational line emis-
sion in the SQ shock structure This discovery makes SQ the rst known example of an H2-luminous
source amongst the emerging class of H2-galaxies presented in chapter 1 This was perhaps one of
the most exciting results of extragalactic spectroscopic observations carried out with the Spitzer mis-
This surprising observational result was published at the start of my PhD thesis Much of my
PhD work was dedicated to its interpretation I have devoted a signicant part of my time in building
a theoretical model that attempts to explain the formation and excitation of H2 in the SQ galaxy
collision within the broader framework of the numerous multi-wavelength observations of the system
It was not an easy task  and I will try to show that our current understanding is the result of a long
path along which several working hypothoses have been explored before coming to what we think to
be a coherent scenario
This work has been published in Guillard et al 2009c hereafter paper I In this manuscript I
will introduce the two questions of H2 formation and excitation almost independently In this chapter
I only discuss H2 formation The interpretation work carried out in paper I is based on the single-
pointing observations of Appleton et al 2006 After the publication of that paper we have obtained
new Spitzer observations that now cover the full area of the SQ ridge I have re-visited my previous
analysis of the H2 excitation in this extended region and complemented it by an analysis of mid-IR

next chapter chap 6
After reading chapters 5 and 6 I hope that the reader will be conviced that SQ is an outstanding
source to study in detail phenomena such as large scale shocks and high velocity galaxy collisions
SQ is a beautiful example of astrophysical source where detailed and rich micro-physics of the ISM
are needed to understand the global observational picture These studies have implications for our
understanding of the dynamics and energetics of the molecular gas in galaxy evolution

52 Observations of warm H2 gas in Stephans Quintet
The rst mid-IR spectroscopic observations of the SQ shock were performed by Appleton et al
2006 We present the observational discovery based on single-pointing observations sect 521
and their extension to new spectral maps are presented in chapter 6
521 The discovery an H2-bright giant shock
The Spitzer Infra-Red Spectrograph IRS observations of the SQ galaxy-wide collision led to the un-
expected detection of extremely bright mid-IR H2 rotational line emission from warm  50 103 K
molecular gas in the center of the X-ray emitting ridge Appleton et al 2006 The observational
results about the rst detection of H2 in the SQ shock are summarized in Fig 51 The left panel
shows the position of the IRS slits SH LH and SL modules see caption for the slit sizes overlaid
on a R-band image with radio VLA contours The high-resolution modules are placed close to the
center of the radio-bright ridge The SL slit is oriented along the radio lament that traces the shock
structure
The right panel of Fig 51 gathers the low- and high-resolution spectra extracted in the SQ shock
These spectacular spectra are dominated by the mid-IR rotational emission of H2 The 0-0 S0 to S5
lines are detected plus atomic lines of Ne II at 128 m and Si II at 348 m No PAH emission
is seen2 and the thermal dust continuum is very weak This is the rst time an almost pure H2 line
spectrum has been seen in an extragalactic object
of 3 and note no obvious deviations from this value in the data
A two-temperatures t of the observed H2 excitation diagram reproduces the data satisfactorily
and gives a rough estimation of the excitation temperatures of the gas The warm molecular gas is
constrained by the S0S1 line ratio and is consistent with Texc  185  30 K and an H2 column
density of 206  1020 cm2 The higher order S3S5 ortho transitions give Texc  675  80 K
and an H2 column density of 154  1018 cm2 Appleton et al 2006 assume an ortho-to-para ratio
The SL spectroscopy shows that the H2 emission is extended on the scale of 52 24 kpc Assum-
ing that the extra undetected H2 lines represent 40 of the ux detected by Spitzer Appleton et al
2006 derive an total H2 luminosity of 84  1033 W from the SH slit area 113  47 arcsec2
The bottom right inset of Fig 51 shows one of the remarkable results of these observations the
H2 17 m 0-0 S1 line is resolved though the relatively low resolution R  600 of the IRS The
S1 line is extremely broad with a FWHM linewidth of v  870 60 km s1 This is the broadest
H2 line ever observed The high velocity dispersion of the warm molecular gas suggest that the
postshock medium in the ridge is extremely turbulent This is a puzzling result since H2 is a fragile
molecule and easily dissociated in Vs  50 km s1 shocks
2this conclusion will be revised in chapter 6 New Spitzer IRS observations indeed show PAH emission in the
ridgeCluver et al 2009

We summarize the main unexpected results from the Appleton et al 2006 observational paper
1 the H2 gas is coexisting with a hot  5  106 K X-ray emitting plasma
2 the velocity dispersion of the H2 gas seems unusually large and of the order of the velocity of
the galaxy collision  900 km s1 which is of the order of the velocity of the galaxy collision
3 the total H2 line luminosity within the SH slit aperture exceeds that of the X-rays in this area by
a factor of 3
4 the spectroscopic signatures dust or ionized gas lines of star formation are much fainter than
the H2 emission This is unlike what is observed in star forming galaxies where the H2 lines
are much weaker than the mid-IR dust features Rigopoulou et al 2002 Higdon et al 2006

522 Astrophysical questions
These surprising observations raise the following questions
 Why is there H2 gas is the extreme environment of the SQ postshock gas
 How can we account for the H2 excitation characteristics
 Why is H2 a dominant coolant
Much of my thesis work has been driven by these astrophysical questions which are addressed in
Guillard et al 2009c paper I In the following I only discuss the scenario proposed to explain the
formation of H2 in the SQ shock The two last issues will be discussed in the next chapter chap 6
where I extend the analysis of paper I which was based on the single-pointing observations presented
above to the full area of the SQ ridge
53 How does H2 form in the Stephans Quintet giant shock
In this section we focus on the rst out of our three astrophysical questions the formation of H2 in
the SQ ridge We introduce the scenario presented in Guillard et al 2009c paper I I will rst
show that we have explored several working hypothesis before coming to this scenario Obviously
our scenario may not be the right solution but to our knowledge this is the rst quantitative model
that attempt to explain the H2 formation and emission within the broader context of multi-wavelength
observations of SQ Up to now it has not been invalidated by observations
531 A long route to a coherent scenario  
The main difculty in understanding the presence of H2 in the SQ shock is to explain how the gas can
cool and become molecular in a hot plasma and how it can survive in such a violent environment
Inspired by previous studies Appleton et al 2006 evoke two possibilities i an oblique shock
geometry and ii the presence of dust in the hot plasma Both ingredients will help diminishing
the gas temperature and make its cooling easier to form H2 within the age of the collision These
hypothesis may also explain why the gas temperature in the ridge is not much hotter than that of
the underlying halo see sect 633 and Trinchieri et al 2003 Xu et al 2003 OSullivan et al
2009b However these ingredients alone are not sufcient enough to explain the coexistence of
warm molecular gas with a hot plasma I will show that the multiphased nature of the shocked gas is
a key to interpret multi-wavelength observations of SQ
An oblique shock geometry
The collision between the new intruder NGC 7318b and the intra-group tidal tail is not necessarily
head-on The shock associated with this collision may be oblique ie the upstream uid crosses the
shock front with an incident angle  cid54 90see sect 453 for a description of oblique supersonic colli-
sions between two gas streams This hypothesis is considered by Trinchieri et al 2003 OSullivan
et al 2009b to explain with there is so little difference between the gas temperature in the radio
5 Powerful H2 emission from the Stephans Quintet galaxy-wide shock
ridge 69  106 K and outside in the halo 57  106 K Trinchieri et al 2003 OSullivan et al
2009b assume a shock velocity equal to the relative line-of-sight velocity between the new intruder
and NGC 7319s tidal tail 900  1000 km s1 In the case of a perpendicular shock a 1000 km s1
shock would lead to a post shock temperature of  14  107 K see Eq 64 which is twice the
temperature derived from X-ray observations in the ridge If the incoming ow forms an angle  with
the shock surface then the shock velocity is reduced by a factor sin  In this case the postshock
temperature can be written as
s sin2  cid39 69  106
1000 km s1
where Vs is the velocity of the shock wave  the mean particle mass equals to 1024 g for a fully
ionized gas kB the Boltzmann constant and   53 Therefore an incidence of   30would be
required to match the observed temperature of the hot gas in the ridge
The possibility that the large-scale shock is oblique may be an argument to reduce the X-ray power
with respect to the more luminous H2 emission in the ridge However it does not explain why part of
the gas has cooled down efciently to form H2 and part of the gas is still hot and emits X-rays
A signicant cooling of the hot gas by the dust
Based on ISO IR observations Xu et al 2003 suggest that dust grains are the main coolant of the hot
gas which produce FIR emission After subtraction of the IR emission from the individual sources
in the group they detect a residual IR emission from the shock The IR emission is extended its
morphology is similar to the radio emission in the ridge and is one order of magnitude more luminous
than the X-ray emission They interpret this IR emission by collisional heating of dust grains by the
hot electrons and ions of the plasma Assuming a constant dust-to-gas mass ratio of 6  103 they
estimate a cooling time scale of tcool  2  106 yr which is two orders of magnitude shorter than if
the plasma is dust-free see sect 24 They use the collisional heating model of Popescu et al 2000
and nd that the expected FIR luminosity is in agreement with observations
The problem is that the cooling timescale is so short that we should observe cool gas around the
shock which is not seen on the X-ray temperature maps OSullivan et al 2009b This scenario has
difculties to explain why we observed both a diffuse hot 6 7 106 K component in the ridge and
in its outskirts and warm 100  1000 K molecular gas In fact at the beginning of our study we
started to work in the direction of Xu et al 2003 to explain the cooling of the gas by the dust grains
in the ridge This is why I decided to carry on a detailed calculation of the time-dependant cooling
of the hot gas taking into account dust destruction This modeling has been presented in sect 24
and in paper I The results lead us to revise the conclusions of Xu et al 2003 and we discuss the
application of this modeling to the case of SQ in sect 532
We nd that the cooling timescale of the hot gas in the ridge is more than one order of magnitude
longer than the shock age We conclude that it is very unlikely that the H2 gas results from the direct
cooling of the hot gas This result has driven us to the idea that if the H2 formation was induced by the
galaxy collision it must have cooled down from much lower temperatures Then the gas in the ridge
must have been shocked by a wide distribution of shock velocities a thus of postshock temperatures
This is how we came to consider that the preshock medium was inhomogeneous In the following we
53 How does H2 form in the Stephans Quintet giant shock
present our scenario for H2 formation New IR observations and modeling of the dust emission in the
SQ shock within the framework of this scenario will be discussed in chapter 8
532 H2 formation out of multiphase postshock gas
The difculties evoked above suggest that it is very difcult to explain H2 formation from homoge-
neous shocked gas at high-speed In our view the presence of H2 in the SQ ridge is closely related to
the multiphase structure of the preshock gas and may result from two possibilities
1 molecular clouds are present in the preshock gas and embedded within the pre-existing halo of
hot gas Because of the density contrast between the tenous gas and the clouds slower shocks
are driven into the clouds see sect 45 and H2 molecules may or may not be dissociated
depending on the shock velocity If the shock transmitted into the cloud is dissociative H2
molecules may reform in the postshock medium see sect 42 and Hollenbach and McKee
1979 If gravitationally bound molecular clouds are present in the preshock medium we expect
the shock to trigger their collapse which would lead to star formation Jog and Solomon 1992
This process is perhaps what is happenning in the northern region of the shock SQ-A where
optical and IR imaging show that a starburst is occuring Xu et al 1999
The weakness of tracers of star formation in the region of the main shock Xu et al 2003
suggests that preshock GMCs are not a major source of the observed postshock H2 gas in the
ridge Although we do not exclude pre-existing molecular gas in the ridge we explore the
following second possibility
2 H2 gas forms out of preshock H I gas Appleton et al 2006 also evoke this scenario by propos-
ing that a large-scale shock overruns a clumpy preshock medium H2 molecules would form
in the denser regions that experience slower shocks compared with the high-speed shock in the
tenuous gas In the following we summarize and complete the results presented in our paper I
Supersonic collision between two inhomogeneous gas streams
Multiwavelength observations of SQ suggest that two multiphase gas ows are colliding see paper I
for an introduction to the past observations and to the astrophysical context that are relevant for our
study3 One stream is associated with the intruding galaxy NGC 7318b and the other is associated
with the tidal tail of NGC 7319 Both gas streams are likely to contain hot a few million K H I and
perhaps molecular clouds Therefore we consider the collision of two ows of multiphase dusty gas
The relative velocity between the ow is 900  1000 km s1 constrained by H I observations and
optical line spectroscopy Our model quanties the gas cooling dust destruction and H2 formation in
the postshock medium within this framework
If the colliding gas ows are inhomogeneous the rise of pressure in the hot tenuous gas drives
slower shocks into the denser clouds see sect 45 Each cloud density corresponds to a shock
velocity The galaxy collision generates a range of shock velocities and postshock gas temperatures
The state of the postshock gas is related to the preshock gas density Schematically low density
3A more complete review of SQ observations is differed to the sect 633 of chapter 6 because this observational context
is needed to interpret our new extended observations of SQ
5 Powerful H2 emission from the Stephans Quintet galaxy-wide shock
preshock at nH cid46 3  103 cm3 gas is shocked at high speed cid38 700 km s1 and accounts for
the X-ray emission Denser H I gas nH cid38 102 is heated to lower cid46 106 K temperatures The
g 1 of paper I sketches this scenario The rise of pressure in the hot gas triggers the compression of
the H I clouds that are the sites for H2 formation
In the following we compute the isobaric cooling the evolution of the dust-to-gas mass ratio and
the formation of molecules in this multi-temperature postshock gas see chapter 2 and chapter 4 for
a description of the microphysics included in the calculation We show that the hot plasma did not
have time to cool down signicantly since the collision was initiated whereas the denser gas has time
to cool and form H2
Gas cooling dust survival and H2 formation in the SQ ridge
We summarize here the context and main results of our calculation of the time-dependence of the gas
temperature and dust-to-gas mass ratio We start the computation with a galactic dust-to-gas mass
ratio and equilibrium ionization We assume that the metallicity of the gas is solar and that the cooling
gas is in pressure equilibrium with the hot volume-lling gas the average thermal pressure of the
possibility that the gas pressure vary around this average value see in particular Fig 3
hot plasma is PkB  2  105 K cm3 As the gas cools it condenses In paper I we explore the
The H2 formation gas cooling and dust destruction timescales are plotted as a function of the
postshock temperature in the key-gure 2 of paper I The gas cooling timescale is dened as the time
at which the temperatures coolds down to 104 K The H2 formation timescale is the time when the H2
fractional abundance reaches 90 of its nal end of cooling value including the gas cooling time
from the postshock temperature to 104 K The dust destruction timescale is the time when 90 of the
dust mass is destroyed and returned to the gas We remind that a given initial postshock temperature
is associated to a given preshock density The relative values of the timescales with respect to the
collision age dene three gas phases
The hot plasma the preshock gas at nH cid46 6  103 cm3 is shocked at Vs  500 km s1 and
therefore heated to temperatures Tps  5  106 K Our estimate of the cooling timescale of
the hot plasma takes into account the time-dependence of the dust-to-gas mass ratio Fig 2 of
paper I shows that because the dust grains are efciently sputtered in the hot gas the cooling
timescale is much longer tcool  2  107 yr for Tps  7  106 K than if one estimates it
for a constant dust-to-gas mass ratio tcool  2  106 yr as estimated by Xu et al 2003 The
cooling timescale of the hot gas is longer than the age of the collision so the tenuous shocked
gas has not yet cooled down signicantly This is the X-ray emitting plasma indicated by the
red thick line Note that this hot gas may still contain some dust because the largest grains
representing most of the mass may not have been completely sputtered within the collision
age However these grains are the less numerous so their contribution to the gas cooling is
weak see chapter 2 sect 23 and 24 for a quantitative discussion of these processes
The molecular gas The preshock gas at nH cid38 3  102 cm3 is shocked at Vs  250 km s1
and therefore heated to temperatures Tps cid46 8  105 K In this case the gas cooling timescale
to 104 K and the H2 formation timescale are shorter than the collision age whereas the dust
54 Summary and conclusions
destruction timescale is longer Therefore this gas keeps a signicant fraction of its initial dust
content and becomes H2 gas blue thick line within the age of the collision
Atomic and ionized gas for intermediate densities 6  103 cid46 nH cid46 3  102 and therefore
intermediate postshock temperatures 8  105  Tps  5  106 K the gas has time to cool
down but it loses its dust content and does not have time to form H2 within the collision age
This phase is indicated with the grey thick line and may represents H I and H II gas phases
This description of the multiphase postshock ignores the fragmentation of the clouds by ther-
mal and hydrodynamical instabilities Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz that develop when a
cloud is shocked As discussed in sect 452 this fragmentation can lead to the mixing evapora-
tion and therefore the destruction of the clouds with the background hot plasma The powerful
H2 emission in the SQ shock suggest that warm molecular gas is formed before the clouds mixing
timescale In sect 33 of paper I we compare the H2 formation timescale to the fragmentation and
mixing timescales The conclusions are the following
Cloud fragmentation we show that for a wide range and preshock cloud densities and sizes see
Fig 4 paper I the crushing time is longer than the cooling so the gas fragments by thermal
instability as the shock penetrates into the cloud H2 forms before the shock has crossed the
cloud and therefore before hydrodynamical instabilities start to develop
Cloud evaporation analytical and numerical studies suggest that the typical evaporation timescale
of warm  104 K H I clouds in hot  106 K gas is a few million years see sect 452 for a
description of turbulent mixing and references This is long enough for H2 to form within the
lifetime of the fragments The cloud lifetime may be even longer because they are stabilized by
the efcient H2 cooling Up to now none of the simulations include both the detailed micro-
physics realistic cooling functions and H2 formation on dust grains and the full dynamic
range of spatial scales and densities that are involved in the evolution of clouds embedded into
a ow of hot gas see sect 452 for the description of the state-of-art simulations
54 Summary and conclusions
One of the most interesting features of the Stephans Quintet compact group is the presence of a
galaxy-wide shock in the halo of the group created by an intruding galaxy colliding with a tidal tail at a
relative velocity of  1 000 km s1 Evidence for a group-wide shock comes from observations of X-
rays from the hot postshock gas in the ridge strong radio synchrotron emission from the radio emitting
plasma and shocked-gas excitation diagnostics from optical emission lines Spitzer observations show
that this gas also contains molecular hydrogen with an extreme velocity dispersion The H2 luminosity
is larger than the X-ray emission from the same region thus the H2 line emission dominates over X-
ray cooling in the shock As such it plays a major role in the energy dissipation and evolution of the
postshock gas
The interpretation of these observations is the core of my PhD work I present a scenario where H2
gas forms out of the postshock gas that results from the supersonic collision between two multiphase
gas streams This collision leads to a multiphase medium with a distribution of shock velocities
5 Powerful H2 emission from the Stephans Quintet galaxy-wide shock
related to the variations of the density in the preshock medium The H2 formation in the SQ ridge
environment is quantied by calculating the time-dependent isobaric cooling of the gas including
dust destruction mechanisms I show that H2 forms out of the dense regions where dust survives the
shocks The bulk kinetic energy of the molecular gas is the main energy reservoir of the postshock
gas and it has to be dissipated within the H2 gas to explain the poserful H2 excitation I propose that
supersonic turbulence is sustained within the molecular gas by a transfer of momentum induced by
cloud-cloud collisions and the relative shear motions between the molecular gas and the hot plasma
A phenomenological model of low-velocity MHD shocks driven into the dense H2 gas is capable of
explaining the observed excitation characteristics
Within this framework dust is a key ingredient
It is required for H2 formation Our model
has implications on the expected dust emission in the SQ halo and on dust survival in a multiphase
environment These points are adressed in chapter 8

Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephans Quintet
Its just like when youve got some coffee thats too black which
means its too strong What do you do You integrate it with
cream you make it weak But if you pour too much cream in it
you wont even know you ever had coffee It used to be hot it
becomes cool It used to be strong it becomes weak It used to
wake you up now it puts you to sleep

Abstract
The observations of H2 rotational line emission from the Stephans Quintet SQ galaxy collision
presented in chapter 5 are extended to a complete and high signal-to-noise spectral mapping of
the SQ giant shock We nd that the H2 line emission is extended over the full ridge  15 
35 kpc2 I present these recent observations and the new astrophysical questions they raise in
particular on the dynamical history of the group I thus introduce some observational background
needed to elucidate these questions Then I present an update of the mass and energy budgets
of the galaxy collision based on these new data I also performed a complete re-analysis of the
new data with shock models and discuss the issue of H2 excitation in the shock This analysis is
complemented by the use of fast shocks models to interpret the ne-structure line emission from
the ionized gas

61 Introduction
The interpretation of H2 observations presented in the previous chapter chap 5 and in Guillard
et al 2009c paper I is based on the single-pointing observations by Appleton et al 2006
6 Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephans Quintet
who rst detected H2 emission from the Stephans Quintet henceforth SQ shock The spectacular re-
sult of Appleton et al 2006 led us to propose a new set of Spitzer observations to obtain a full mid-IR
spectral map of the X-ray bright shock region I have participated in the preparation of this proposal
PI PN Appleton by performing the model calculations that support it It was accepted and ob-
served in December 2007 and January 2008 Both mid-infrared mid-IR imaging and spectroscopy
were performed
These new observations were reduced by M Cluver and P Appleton at the SSC and the results
are presented in Cluver et al 2009 hereafter paper II I have participated to the interpretation of
these data and to the writing of this paper Thanks to this new IRS spectral mapping of the SQ ridge
we have now an almost complete census of the mid-IR warm H2 emission ne-structure line and dust
emission in the SQ shock These observations allow to complement the mass and energy budget of
the collision presented in paper I which was resticted to a small area of the giant shock This energy
budget is the rst step to understand the mechanisms that produce the high H2 luminosity over such a
large area  40  15 kpc This leads me to do a complete re-analysis of the H2 data based on my
previous interpretation work I have also complemented this work by an interpretation of the emission
from the ionized gas in the group optical and ne-structure mid-IR lines
This chapter extends and re-visits the analysis presented in chapter 5 and in paper I for the full
area of the SQ shock In sect 62 I briey present the results of the spectral maps focussing on H2
Obviously these new observations raise new astrophysical questions formulated in sect 622 In
sect 623 I present an updated mass and energy budget in the SQ shock similar to that presented
in paper I but for the full extension of the ridge Section 63 describes past observations of SQ to
set the astrophysical observational context focusing on the complex dynamics of the galaxy group
This background seems crucial for the understanding of our new set of Spitzer observations Then I
extend my modeling of the H2 excitation for the whole ridge sect 64 Pursuing the work of paper I
I discuss the dynamical picture of the energy transfer between the ISM phases that emerges from
this interpretation and the physical mechanisms that may explain how the bulk kinetic energy of the
galaxy collision is transfered into the warm H2 sect 65 Then I complement the H2 analysis by a
study of the excitation of the mid-IR ne structure lines in sect 66 Section 67 comments about the
AGN member of the group NGC 7319 which shows an interesting H2 feature revealed by our new
IRS spectral maps A quick summary and concluding remarks end this chapter sect 68
The paper II is reproduced at the end of this chapter because it contains the gures I will rely on
in this chapter and a lot of information that I have intentionally not repeated in this manuscript
62 Spectral mapping of the H2 line emission in the SQ shock
The Spitzer IRS mapping strategy is summarized in Fig 61 The SL and LL modules were used to
map the entire shock region the SL slits being oriented along the shock structure and the LL slits
perpendicular to it The spectral mapping aims at spatially resolving the H2 and dust across the shock
621 H2 spatial distribution
The new spectral maps are reported in Cluver et al 2009 hereafter paper II We summarize here
the main observational results focusing on the distribution and characteristics of the H2 emission in

X-ray sources just on the right-edge of the SL region is associated with NGC 7318a
the SQ intra-group The main results regarded the mapping of other mid-IR ne-structure lines are
discussed later in sect 662
A remarkably extended H2 emission
Fig 2 of paper II shows contours of the H2 S0-S5 line emission overlaid on an R-band image
The S0 and S1 lines were mapped by the LL modules while S2 - S5 transitions were mapped
by the SL modules of the IRS These spectral maps show an extended emission from a giant lament
 40 kpc long oriented north-south along the direction of the main shock This H2 ridge
spatially correlates very well with the radio or the X-ray emission This provides an unambigious link
between the origin of the H2 emission and a large-scale high-speed shock generated by the galaxy
collision between NGC 7318b and the tidal tail of NGC 7319 We dene the main shock aperture
as a AMS  77cid48cid48

coordinates   22h35m596s   3358cid48057cid48cid48
H2 emission from the star forming region SQ-A as well as associated with NGC 7319 is also
detected We note that the 282 m S0 line emission appears to be concentrated towards the SQ-

main shock to NGC 7319 We call this the H2 bridge because it connects the ridge to the core of
NGC 7319 This feature is also visible in radio H  and is and faintly detected in X-rays The origin
of this bridge feature is not clear and we will come back to this point later sect 67
Enormous H2 uxes
The spectra see Fig 8 of paper II and the H2 line uxes see sect 4 and table 2 have been calculated
for different apertures in the ridge Fig 7 The spectra show the striking dominance of the H2 lines
in the mid-IR range of the IRS The thermal dust continuum is very weak in the center of the shock
and in the bridge structure whereas it is stronger for the northern region SQ-A where star formation
is likely occurring For the main shock structure the 0-0S1 line luminosity alone the sum of the
S0 to S5 and the total H2 accounting for  30  of the ux in undetected lines luminosities are
respectively
LS1H2  23  1034 W
LS0S5H2  7  1034 W
LtotH2  9  1034 W
This exceptional power in the molecular hydrogen lines is one order of magnitude brighter than the
next brightest mid-IR line Si II3482m with a line luminosity of LSiII  85  1033 W
The mid-IR spectral mapping will allow us to map the excitation of the H2 along and across the
X-ray shock We have started to work on a two-dimensional modelling of the H2 excitation We
will create maps the H2 excitation temperature across the shock and correlate this with dust emission
SEDs in order to test models we are developing to explain the extreme H2 power observed This work
will be pursued during my postdoc
622 Astrophysical questions raised by the new observations
The new spectral maps described above reveal the wide extension of the H2 emission in the halo of
the SQ group as well as the spatial distribution of the mid-IR emission from dust and ne-structure
lines They essentially raise the main following questions
 Why is the H2 emission so extended In particular what is the origin of the H2 emission in the
bridge feature between the main shock and the AGN NGC 7319 of the group
 Which mechanisms power the mid-IR ne-structure lines detected in the ridge Is H2 really the
dominant coolant in the shock
 Where does the emission come from From the hot gas in the halo of the group or from the
molecular gas
The rst issue is related to the geometry and dynamics of the galaxy interactions in the group
This is why we discuss this point in sect 63 The second point is discussed in paper II and I have
complemented this discussion in sect 66 The dust emission in SQ is tackled in chapter 8 Before
addressing the two rst questions it is important to assess the energy content of the extended SQ
63 A complex astrophysical context SQ observational constrains
623 Updated mass and energy budgets for the whole ridge
In Guillard et al 2009c we use the multiwavelength observations see sect 63 to estimate the
masses thermal and mechanical energy and luminosities in the preshock and postshock medium see
table 1 of paper I At that time only the single-pointing H2 observations by Appleton et al 2006
were available so the mass and energy budgets were calculated within the IRS SH slit aperture Now
that we have a complete spectral mapping of the ridge we are able to estimate the physical quantities
within the full shock region The details on how we determine the quantities from the observations
are given in sect 22 and 24 of paper I The new results for the whole ridge are gathered in table 61
All the quantities are estimated within the main shock 77cid48cid48

The conclusions are the same as those of Guillard et al 2009c In the preshock medium the
thermal energy of the hot plasma  3
TX is only a few percent of the bulk kinetic energy of the
H I gas In the postshock medium the main energy reservoir is the mechanical energy associated with
the high-velocity dispersion of the warm H2 gas All the mechanical energy of the collision is not
dissipated in the hot plasma but a substantial amount is carried by the warm H2 We show that the
bulk kinetic energy of the molecular gas is  2 times the thermal energy of the postshock plasma
63 A complex astrophysical context SQ observational constrains
I describe here the SQ group of galaxies and give an overview of its multi-wavelength data sect 63
This review is focused on the dynamics of the group and on the evidence for a high-speed galaxy-
wide shock This is crucial to understand the complexity of this interacting system and to set the
context for the interpretation of the extended H2 emission
631 Are there ve musicians playing in the Stephans Quintet
SQ was discovered in 1877 by the french astronomer Edouard Jean-Marie Stephan 1837  1923
at the Observatory of Marseille France Stephan 1877 He discovered a group of four elliptical
nebulae today known as SQ much earlier than anyone knew the existence of galaxies outside the
Milky Way When one looks at a SQ image one actually sees 6 galaxies NGC 7317 NGC 7318a
NGC 7318b NGC 7319 NGC 7320 and NGC 7320c see Fig 62 So how many galaxies belong to
the group 4 5 or 6
The rst estimates of the redshifts of the SQ members were done through optical spectroscopy
and observations show a wide range of values among the galaxies within the group Humason et al
1956 Ambartsumian 1958 Limber and Mathews 1960 Burbidge and Burbidge 1961a In partic-
ular NGC 7320 has a recession velocity of  6000 km s1 less than NGC 7317 NGC 7318a and
NGC 7319 that are at  6600 km s1 see table 62 In addition NGC 7318b and NGC 7320c have
respectively redshift  900 and  700 km s1 less than the three members at  6600 km s1 This
puzzling result was the start of a long debate about the population of Stephans Quintet Do all the
galaxies belong to the group How many galaxies are in gravitational interaction
Burbidge and Burbidge 1961b reported that the difference in redshift of  6000 km s1 between
the high- and low-redshift members of SQ could only means one of two things i NGC 7320 is a
foreground galaxy or ii NGC 7320 is literally exploding away from the other members They

ii is outside conventional ideas about the dynamics of galaxy groups Arp 1973b reports the

Arp and Lorre 1976 argued that NGC 7320 is physically associated with other SQ galaxies and this
was a prime case for the existence of non-Dopler redshift
Tammann 1970 Allen and Sullivan 1980 Moles et al 1997 provided counter arguments
against this claim First H I and H observations show no evidence for NGC 7320 interaction with
other SQ galaxies Second redshift independent estimates yield to distances consistent with the red-

shifts Third the redshift of NGC 7320 is close to that of NGC 7331 818  5 km s1 so NGC 7320
appear to be a member of a foreground loose galaxy group which includes the large spiral galaxy
NGC 7331 In the following we thus assume that NGC 7320 is a foreground galaxy and it will not be
further discussed hereafter Arp 1973a suggested that NGC 7320c the galaxy lying 4 arcmin to the
east of NGC 7319 see Fig 62 top panel is linked to the group by optical tidal tails Therefore the
quintet status is restored
In the bottom panel of Fig 62 we show a recent mosaic picture taken by Gallagher et al 2001
with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 WFPC2 onboard the Hubble Space Telescope HST on
Dec 30 1998 and June 17 1999 One clearly sees on the image that galaxy interactions have distorted
the galaxies shapes creating elongated spiral arms and long gaseous streamers Interestingly this
spectacular image reveals that star clusters are forming outside the galactic disks in the SQ halo
Some of these star cluster contain a few millions of stars
In the following we assume the distance to the SQ group to be 94 Mpc with a Hubble constant of
70 km s1 Mpc2 and a systemic velocity for the group as a whole of 6 600 km s1 At this distance

632 The complex dynamical history of Stephans Quintet
The rst deep optical images taken by Arp and Kormendy 1972 Arp 1973a Arp and Lorre 1976
show two concentrating parallel tidal tails both starting from NGC 7319 and extending to NGC 7320c
with the more diffuse one passing through the low redshift galaxy NGC 7320 Fig 63 presents an
example of a photographic plate taken at the 200-inch Palomar telescope where these two tidal tails
are clearly visible This is the rst indication of a long list of observations that show that the group
has a complex dynamical history

As its population the dynamical history of SQ has been a long debate that is not entirely solved
yet In the following we rst summarize the scenario of past and present dynamical interactions that
emerges from multi-wavelengths observations Then we detail the different arguments that support it
and we point out the remaining uncertainties
Summary of the scenario multiple galaxy collisions
In the past an old intruder NGC 7320c stripped most of the gas from group members essentially
NGC 7319 and NGC 7318a and a new intruder NGC 7318b is currently colliding with this gas and
triggering a large scale shock The old intruder passed the core of SQ twice rst  57108 yrs ago
and creating the old tail the southern tail in Fig 63 and second about 2  108 yrs ago triggering
the young tail the narrower one in Fig 63
Observational constrains on past interactions with NGC 7320c
The two-intruders scenario summarized above was clearly formulated by Moles et al 1997 and
further conrmed by Sulentic et al 2001 who discussed in detail the link between the two tidal tails
and the two passages of NGC 7320c through the kernel of the group
The HST image Fig 62 highlights that star birth occurs mainly in three dynamically-perturbed
sub-regions of the group the long sweeping tail and spiral arms of NGC 7319 left the gaseous
debris of the galaxy pair NGC 7318a and b bottom right and an area north of those galaxies the so-
called SQ-A starburst region top right Since galaxy interactions are known to trigger star formation
the SQ star formation history is closely linked to its dynamical history Photometric analysis of the
HST images shows that the ages of these star clusters span over a wide range spanning from 
2  106 yrs to  3  109 yrs which shows past and recent star formation Gallagher et al 2001
The southern diffuse tail mostly contains an old population of star clusters whereas the northern one
is comprised of younger stars
X-ray observations also support multiple episods of galaxy interaction in the SQ group A very
extended halo of hot  6  106 K gas was rst detected by Bahcall et al 1984 They state that
the extent of the halo is too big and its temperature too low to have been produced by the collision
of the new intruder They also show that the X-ray luminosity of the halo LX 01  3 keV 
5  1042 erg s1 is 10 times the expected luminosity from the combined ve SQ galaxies Later
Moles et al 1997 Sulentic et al 2001 OSullivan et al 2009b suggest that this X-ray emitting
hot intracluster gas was produced by previous galaxy encounters with NGC 7320c for instance We
will further discuss X-ray observations in sect 633
The discovery of a galaxy-wide shock in Stephans Quintet
The rst evidence for the recent collision between the intruder NGC 7318b and the IGM comes from
two discoveries in the radio band both made with the Westerbork Synthesis Telescope Netherlands
The rst is a giant  40 kpc long radio continuum ridge found in the IGM between NGC
7319 and NGC 7318b Allen and Hartsuiker 1972 Among other possible interpretations Allen
and Hartsuiker 1972 suggested this may be a large scale shock triggered by an on-going collision
between NGC 7318b the recent intruder and the rest of the group The collision velocity is about
63 A complex astrophysical context SQ observational constrains
one million mph 1000 km s1 A one hundred thousand light-year long giant shock is produced
Stephans Quintet is thus a multi-galaxy collision caught in action
The second Allen and Sullivan 1980 Shostak et al 1984 is the revelation that nearly all the
H I gas associated with SQ is lying outside galaxy disks in the group halo This represents a mass of
neutral gas of  1010 Mcid12 These observations suggest that this gas has been stripped from late type
galaxy disks due to an earlier interaction a few 108 yr ago either between NGC 7319 and NGC 7318a
Allen and Sullivan 1980 or between NGC 7319 and NGC 7320c Shostak et al 1984 In sect 633
we discuss more recent observations of the radio-emitting ridge
Ongoing debate about the origin of the young tidal tail
If most of the litterature now agrees on the origins of the old tail and of the main shock the origin
of the young tail is more debated Instead of the two step scenario proposed by Moles et al
1997 Sulentic et al 2001 Xu et al 2005 proposed a three-intruders scenario based on new
UV observations
They argue that it is unlikely that the young tail is also triggered by NGC 7320c This is because
the recently measured redshift of NGC 7320c 6583 km s1 Sulentic et al 2001 is almost identical
to that of NGC 7319 indicating a slow passage Sulentic et al 2001 rather than a fast passage
 700 km s1 Moles et al 1997 In order for NGC 7320c to move to its current position the
NGC 73197320c encounter must have occurred cid38 5  108 yr ago This is close to the age of the old
tail but older than that of the young tail They suggested that the young tail is triggered by a close
encounter between the elliptical galaxy NGC 7318a and NGC 7319 The projected distance between
NGC 7318a7319 is only  13 of that between NGC 7320c7319 Therefore the time argument is in
favor of the new scenario
Numerical N-body simulations are certainly needed to explore and test the dynamical scenarios
inferred from observations Recent work within the specic context of SQ has been made by Renaud
2007 and has to be pursued We will not further discussed this debate and shall concentrate on the
main shock
633 Further evidence for a galaxy-wide shock
In the following we further discuss multi-wavelength observations of Stephans Quintet These data
sets allow to establish the energy and mass budget of the SQ galaxy collision which is gathered in the
Table 1 of Guillard et al 2009c paper I

spectral index map We summarize the main results
 there is a bright north-south linear ridge of radio emission running in between NGC 7319 and
NGC 7318b The diffuse radio emission is more extended at lower frequencies including areas
west of the ridge The 14 GHz image shows that faint emission connects this extended ridge
to NGC 7319 A faint extension to the northwest coinciding with H emission Plana et al
1999 Sulentic et al 2001 is also detected The total ux density associated with the extended
radio ridge is 48  7 mJy Williams et al 2002
 The spectral index map shows that the southern part of the ridge has an index of 07  08
while the northern part has a steeper spectrum OSullivan et al 2009a Some of the brightest
spots of radio emission corresponds with knots of UV emission in the south-eastern spiral arm of
NGC 7318b In this region the spectral index is consistent with star formation so the underlying
extended radio emission arising from shocks may be enhanced by star formation in some areas
 the core of the Seyfert 2 NGC 7319 shows a radio source with a ux 28505 mJy Both images
also show that there is a radio source associated with the nucleus of NGC 7318a 095005 mJy
Xu et al 2003
 note that the bright source lying to the north of SQ-A is a backgroung distant binary source seen
in projection behind SQ van der Hulst and Rots 1981 Williams et al 2002
The total luminosity emitted by the radio ridge at 14 GHz is L14GHz  4  1031 W from a
volume extending about 90cid48cid48
 15cid48cid48 This luminosity is 10 times the radio-luminosity of all star-
forming regions in SQ NGC 7318a SQ-A and a possible non-AGN component from 7319 van der
Hulst and Rots 1981 proposed that the radio emission in the ridge is produced by an intra-cluster
starburst This would imply a star-formation rate of  30 Mcid12 yr1 which is uncompatible with
optical spectroscopy H imaging or mid-IR observations see chapter 8
The radio ridge must be associated with synchrotron emission of relativistic electron accelerated
in the giant shock created by the NGC 7318b galaxy that is entering into NGC 7319s tidal tail The
ridge is the interface between the interloper NGC 7318b and the group Indeed the shocked ionized
gas is predicted to produce signicant amounts of synchrotron emission van der Hulst and Rots
1981 Allen and Hartsuiker 1972 The synchrotron life time for the radiating electrons is estimated
to be rather short a few times 107 yr which is comparable to the crossing time for the collision
Assuming the equipartition of energy between gas internal energy cosmic rays and magnetic
energy Xu et al 2003 estimate the magnetic eld strength to be Beq cid39 10 G The corresponding
energy density of relativistic particles plus the magnetic elds is Umin  1011 erg cm3 This is
signicantly lower than the thermal energy density implied by X-ray observations see below

colors we show the radial velocities of the gas HI observations exhibit a large stream created by
tidal interactions between NGC 7320c and NGC 7319 Moles et al 1997 Sulentic et al 2001
This stream corresponds to the old tidal tail see Fig 63 and the velocity of the gas in the tail is
6600  6700 km s1 No H I gas is detected in the younger tail The SQ-A starburst region both
contains H I gas at the intragroup tidal tail velocity  6600 km s1 and at a velocity slightly
higher that the intruder velocity  6000 km s1 which suggests that this gas was accelerated by the
shock Some H I gas associated with the intruder velocity  5700 km s1 is detected to the south of
NGC 7318ab
The observed difference in radial velocities between the H I tidal tail and the intruder is about
1 000 km s1 On Fig 66 the 21 cm contours are overlaid on an H  Fabry-Prot image At the
velocity of the intra-group medium the H  image left panel clearly shows the linear feature asso-
ciated with the shock Over the shock region no H I gas is detected but optical line emission from
H II gas is observed at the H I tidal tail velocity This suggests that the H I gas present in the ridge
before the recent galaxy collision was ionized by the shock induced by the collision between the two
gas ows It is likely that the H I gas at  6600 km s1 in SQ-A was physically connected to the H I
tail We infer the preshock H I gas masses based on the I column densities observed on both sides of
the ridge see paper I
X-ray observations
The rst X-ray observations of SQ were performed with the Einstein Observatory and were reported
by Bahcall et al 1984 They found an extended halo but the spatial resolution was not high enough
to resolve the structure of the ridge The presence of shock-heated gas in the SQ halo was conrmed
by X-ray ROSAT Chandra and XMM observations X-ray maps Pietsch et al 1997 Sulentic et al
2001 revealed an extended and diffuse hot halo plus features associated with the radio ridge and

with galaxy members of the group The extent of the underlying X-ray emitting halo is too big to
have been produced by the new interaction of NGC 7318b with the tidal tail strongly suggesting that
it must have been heated during previous dynamical encounters Moles et al 1997 Sulentic et al

while the radio emission is brightest in the south

The width of the radio or X-ray emission in the shock is  5 kpc which is commensurate with
the width of the H  ridge Dividing the width of the ridge by the collision velocity assumed to be
1 000 km s1 we get a collision age of the order of tcoll  5  106 yr
Spectral energy distribution tting of Chandra and XMM observations of SQ show that the temper-
ature of the hot plasma in the ridge is TX  69106 K Trinchieri et al 2003 2005 OSullivan et al
2009b The postshock temperature for a perpendicular shock is given by see chapter 4 Eq 420 or
eg Draine and McKee 1993
s cid39 694  106
715 km s1
where Vs is the velocity of the shock wave  the mean particle mass equals to 1024 g for a fully
ionized gas kB the Boltzmann constant and   53 Therefore the postshock temperature of the
hot plasma allows us to estimate a shock velocity of  700 km s1 We expect the shock velocity to
be equal to the gas velocity in the center of mass frame If the volume-averaged gas densities are the
same on the intruder side and on the side of the tidal tail see sect 633 for details the shock velocity
would be approximately half of the observed relative velocity so 10002  500 km s1 This is
signicantly lower than the shock velocity we deduce from X-ray observations suggesting that the
mass of the gas in the intruding galaxy is higher than in the tidal tail
The fact that the shock velocity agrees with the line-of-sight relative velocity of the intruder sug-
gests that its transverse velocity component is small Sulentic et al 2001 also argue that the dis-
tribution of the H I and H II emissions support the idea of an ongoing collision of NGC 7318b with
the tidail tail almost parallel to the line of sight This conclusion has been revised by Trinchieri et al
2003 OSullivan et al 2009b who argued for an oblique shock geometry They nd that the tem-
perature in the ridge 69  106 K is close to that of the underlying hot halo 57  106 K As they
64 How can we account for the H2 excitation
are assuming a shock velocity of 900  1000 km s1 they conclude that the temperature in the ridge
is too low The hypothesis of an oblique shock may help to decrease the main shock velocity and
therefore the postshock temperature This will be further discussed in sect 531
The only sign for any interaction between NGC 7317 with other members of SQ is a common halo
linking it to the binary NGC 7318 found in the deep X-ray and optical R-band images Trinchieri
et al 2005
64 How can we account for the H2 excitation
In this section we address the question of the H2 excitation in the ridge Thanks to the IRS spectral
mapping of the ridge presented in sect 62 we have a complete census of the warm H2 excitation over
the extended region of the SQ ridge I have extended and re-visited the analysis presented in chapter 5
and in paper I for the full area of the SQ shock
641 Possible H2 excitation mechanisms in the SQ shock
H2 can be excited by several mechanisms X-ray heating cosmic-ray heating and shock excitation
We have discussed the micro-physics of these processes in sect 34 and we discuss here which are the
dominant processes for H2 excitation in the environment of the SQ ridge
X-ray heating
The physics of the H2 excitation by X-rays is discussed in sect 341 and 342 We show that the
energy conversion from X-ray ux to the bolometric H2 emission is at most 10  for a molecular
cloud that is optically thick to X-ray photons This excitation efciency may be even smaller because
the absorbed fraction of X-ray photons may be smaller than 1 We indeed expect that the surface
lling factor of the postshock H2 gas is smaller than 1
The Spitzer observations show that the H2 line luminosity domines the X-ray emission from the
SQ shock region This result is true for the whole SQ ridge but also for sub-regions extracted in the
center of the ridge or in the H2 bridge structure towards NGC 7319 see sect 62 and paper II For
the main shock the total X-ray ux is FX 0001 10 kev  28 1016 W m2 which corresponds
to a luminosity of LX 000110 kev  2951034 W Therefore we nd an H2 to X-ray luminosity
ratio of
LX 0001  10 keV  3
Given the X-ray to H2 ux conversion estimated previously this ratio shows that the H2 gas cannot
be predominantly excited by the X-ray photons of the hot plasma
Cosmic ray heating
Warm H2 gas may also be heated by relativistic particles in the radio ridge The physical processes
related to H2 excitation by cosmic-ray ionization have been discussed in sect 341 and 342 An
enhanced cosmic ray density has been proposed to account for the high temperatures of molecular
clouds in the Milky Way nuclear disk Yusef-Zadeh et al 2007 and for the mid-IR H2 emission in
6 Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephans Quintet
the laments of the Perseus A 3C 84 cool core cluster Ferland et al 2008 Is the cosmic-ray
heating can explain the powerful H2 emission in the SQ ridge
Let us estimate the cosmic-ray ionization rate  that is needed to balance the cooling of the gas
by H2 line emission In the SQ ridge the total H2 line luminosity is 9  1034 W see eq 63 and the
estimated total mass of H2 is 12  109 Mcid12 see sect 623 table 61 Therefore the average total
line emission per H2 molecule is
LH2SQ  13  10
We assume that each H2 ionization releases EionH2  7 eV of energy to heat the molecular gas see
sect 342 for the determination of this value Therefore the H2 line cooling is balanced by cosmic
ray heating for an ionization rate per hydrogen equal to
cid19cid18 7 eV
  12  10
13  1031 W
Therefore the cosmic-ray ionization rate needed to balance the H2 line cooling in the SQ ridge is
 5  103 times higher than the standard Galactic rate Shaw et al 2005 For a cosmic ray energy
density  5103 times higher the the Milky Way mean value the cosmic ray pressure would be a fac-
tor 400 higher than the mean cosmic ray pressure in the Milky Way disk PcosMW  104 K cm3 
Boulares and Cox 1990 and  20 times larger than the thermal gas pressure Such a high difference
in the pressures is unlikely on large scales It would imply large departures from the g as equilibrium
and from the equipartition of energy on a very large volume which does not seem to be conrmed by
radio observations see Xu et al 2003 OSullivan et al 2009a and paper I
However enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rates may be produced at small scales for instance in
turbulent mixing layers This turbulent mixing occurs when the ow of the background hot plasma in-
teracts with the molecular clouds At the interface cosmic-ray particles can be accelerated efciently
see Scalo and Elmegreen 2004 for a review of these processes For such a high value cosmic
rays are the main destruction mechanism of H2 molecules and the molecular gas fraction depend
on the ionization rate to gas density ratio nH The models by Ferland et al 2008 show that for
  1013 s1 the gas is molecular for nH  104 cm3 see their gure 2 Given that the warm
H2 temperature inferred from the S1 to S0 line ratio is  160 K see g 9 of paper II in the
main shock region the pressure of the warm molecular gas would be  2  106 K cm3 which is
physically possible in the SQ environment
H2 emission associated with its formation
The formation of H2 during the cooling of the dense postshock gas discussed in sect 532 must be
accompanied by H2 emission The excitation mechanism associated with H2 formation is discussed
in sect 343 Can this excitation explain the powerful H2 excitation in the SQ ridge To quantify this
we calculate the H2 emission associated with its formation during the isobaric cooling of the gas from
104 K to  10 K This calculation has been discussed in sect 5 of paper I and we summarize here our
results
Within the framework of a multiphase postshock medium we assume that the gas that is forming
H2 comes from hotter ionized gas that has recombined We nd that the observed H2 rotational line

ratios are well reproduced by the model Fig 5 of paper I shows that the shape of the H2 excitation
diagram associated with H2 formation during the gas cooling matches the observations very well blue

where Nrec is the number of hydrogen atoms that recombine per second EH is the energy of an H 
photon and LH is the H luminosity see Heckman et al 1989 for details To match the observed
H2 line uxes with this model would require a mass ow of recombining gas of  30300 Mcid12 yr1
which is not compatible with the mass rate derived from H observations  1260 Mcid12 yr1 This
model also fails to reproduce the OI 6300 line emission by a factor of 7 Therefore the cooling of
the warm H I gas produced by H II recombination cannot reproduce the observed H2 emission nor the
OI 6300 line emission A larger amount of energy needs to be dissipated within the molecular gas
to account for the H2 emission
In paper I we show that within the IRS SH slit aperture centered in the ridge the dominant energy
reservoir of the postshock gas is the bulk kinetic energy of the molecular gas In sect 623 we have
extended the mass and energy budget of the SQ galaxy collision and shown that the mechanical H2
energy is at least a factor of 2 higher than the thermal energy of the hot plasma for the whole shock If
we assume the equipartition of energy between cosmic rays and magnetic energy the mean magnetic
eld strength in the SQ shocked region is cid39 10 G Xu et al 2003 The magnetic energy and thereby

where lz is the dimension along the line-of-sight and AMS the area of the main shock region dened
in paper II and sect 62 Assuming lz  4 kpc OSullivan et al 2009b we conclude that the
equipartition energy of cosmic-rays is one order of magnitude smaller than the bulk kinetic energy of
the H2 gas So the bulk kinetic energy of the warm H2 gas greatly domines the overall energy budget
of the entire SQ ridge structure
This conclusion drives us to the following interpretation of the extreme H2 power in the SQ ridge
we propose that the H2 emission is powered by the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy into molecu-
lar gas In the turbulent postshock medium we expect that the relative motion between the backgroung
plasma and the H2 gas but perhaps also the relative motion between the molecular clouds themselves
supply supersonic turbulence in the H2 gas Since the postshock medium is magnetized as indicated
6 Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephans Quintet
by radio synchrotron observations see sect 633 we phenomenologically model this dissipation of
mechanic energy by shocks In sect 433 we have discussed extensively the molecular cooling in
shocks Non-dissociative MHD shocks are a very efcient way to channel the mechanical energy of
the shock to the rotational excitation of H2 Then we favor this process In the absence of a mag-
netic eld shocks are rapidly dissociative and much of the cooling of the shocked gas occurs through
atomic rather than H2 line emission
642 Low-velocity MHD shocks and H2 excitation
We quantify the required gas densities and shock velocities to account for the H2 rotational line uxes
In paper I we present in details the result for the single-pointing observations by Appleton et al
2006 Here we use our spectral mapping data to extend our analysis on the whole region of the SQ
ridge We compare these new results with our previous analysis in the center of the SQ shock
The H2 emission induced by low velocity shocks is calculated using an updated version of the
shock model of Flower et al 2003 presented in chapter 4 sect 43 We use the same grid of
models presented in paper I ie shock velocities from 3 to 40 km s1 with steps of 1 km s1
two values of the initial H2 ortho to para ratio 3 and 102 and three different preshock densities
nH  102 103 and 104 cm3 In this models we assume a standard value for the cosmic ray
ionization rate of   5  1017 s1 In its initial state the gas is molecular and cold  10 K with
molecular abundances resulting from the output of our model for the isobaric cooling see sect 532
and paper I for details We adopt the scaling of the preshock magnetic strength with the gas density
nH cm3 Crutcher 1999 Hennebelle et al 2008 In our models b  1 Since the
molecular gas colder than 50 K does not contribute to the H2 emission we stop the integration when
the gas has cooled to 50 K and we calculate the line uxes at this point
In paper I we present the result in terms of H2 excitation diagram see sect 345 for the details
about how it is calculated In this manuscript we present the observed and model spectral energy
distribution SED of the H2 line uxes for i the same data as in paper I and ii the new data of
paper II for the main shock region
We detail how we t the H2 line uxes with shock models In the models presented here the
preshock gas density is nH  104 cm3 The shock velocity is the only shock parameter that we
allow to vary From the output of the shock model we derive the H2 line brightnesses B50 KH2 at
50 K in units of W m2 sr1 We perform a least-squares t of the observed H2 line uxes to a
linear combination of two MHD shocks at different velocities Vs1 and Vs2 has been performed These
ts provide a scaling factor for each of the shocks which represents a mass ow M  dMdt the
amount of gas traversing the shocks per unit time The H2 gas luminosity is proportional to this mass

H2 line uxes for the Appleton et al 2006 data left panel corresponding to the g 5 of paper I
and for the main shock region data from paper II For a preshock density of 104 cm3 the best t
is obtained for a combination of 5 and  20 km s1 shocks 22 km s1 for the main shock region
with an initial value of the ortho to para ratio of 3 Note that no satisfactory t could be obtained with
the low value of the initial H2 ortho-to-para ratio The red line shows the weighted sum of the two
shock components best t The contributions of the 5 blue dashed line and  20 km s1 green
dashed line shocks to the total column densities are also plotted The 5 km s1 component dominates
the contribution to the column densities of the upper levels of S0 and S1 lines The 20 km s1
component has a major contribution for the upper levels of S3 to S5 For S2 the 2 contributions
are comparable
The g 610 shows the reduced chi-square contour maps of the two-velocities shock t for the two
apertures used These maps allow the visualize which are the best combinations of shock velocities to
t the data As compared to the small aperture in the center of the shock there are bigger discrepancies
between the best-t model and the data for the extended ridge aperture We note that the agreement
between the model and the data is very good for the odd J values of upper H2 levels whereas much
larger differences are seen for the even-levels The error bars on the H2 line uxes are also much
smaller for the main shock aperture because data is much deeper than the previous observations by
Appleton et al 2006 so the 2 value are thus much higher The extended ridge aperture is more
contaminated by star-forming regions than the small aperture see chapter 8 for a discussion of star
formation in the ridge which may explain why the t is poorer
Some of the key-parameters derived from the t are gathered in tables 63 and 64 for the two
sets of data We indicate the best-t shock velocities the mass ows M that are required to explain

Our grid of models shows that this solution is not unique If one decreases the density to 103 cm3
we nd that one can t the observations with a combination of MHD shocks at 9 and 35 km s1 If
one decreases the density to 102 cm3 the rotational H2 excitation cannot be tted satisfactorily At
such low densities MHD shocks fail to reproduce the S3 and S5 lines because the critical densities
for rotational H2 excitation increase steeply with the J rotational quantum number see sect 323
The warm H2 pressures  V 2 in the two shocks are 45  107 K cm3 and 56  108 K cm3 for
the 5 km s1 and 20 km s1 shocks respectively These pressure are much higher than the pressure
of the background hot plasma  2  105 K cm3 Both warm and dense ie high pressure gas is
needed to account for emission from the higher J levels
Though the t is not unique it gives an estimate of the relevant range of shock velocities required
to account for the H2 excitation The velocities  5  20 km s1 are remarkably low compared
to the SQ collision velocity  1000 km s1 and to the velocity dispersion of the warm molecular
gas  900 km s1 If our interpretation of the H2 emission in terms of shock-driven dissipation of
energy within the warm molecular gas is right such a contrast in velocities is a beautiful illustration
of turbulent cascade from high-velocities at large scales to low-velocity at small scales The fact that
energy dissipation occurs over this low velocity range is an essential key to account for the importance
of H2 cooling High velocity shocks  40  50 km s1 in dense nH  104 cm3 molecular gas
would dissociate H2 molecules However we are far from understanding in details how the transfer
of energy from the background plasma shocked at high speed  700 km s1 see sect 633 to the
molecular gas This is discussed qualitatively in sect 5 and 6 of paper I and we will come back to
this question in sect 65
643 Future observational tests near-IR H2 line emission
A missing piece of the puzzle of the SQ shock is the near-IR spectrum This would allow to have
access to both ro-vibrational H2 cooling lines and atomic lines and therefore to gain a more complete
64 How can we account for the H2 excitation
Figure 611 The excitation diagram of H2 emission in Stephans Quintet from observations black
symbols from Appleton et al 2006 compared with a model of the post-shock gas from Guil-
lard et al 2009c The model predicts uxes for the ro-vibrational lines in the range 02  14 
1018 W m2 over a solid angle of 5  10 arcsec2 depending on the kind of shock Observations in
the near-IR can signicantly limit the kinds of shocks capable of explaining the excitation diagram
These will inuence our picture of how eneregy is funnelled down to 20 km s1 shocks from the
large-shock Vs  600 km s1 which creates the X-ray emission
picture of the total line cooling in the SQ shock The near-IR ro-vibrational lines sample much hotter
H2 gas than the Spitzer data see chapter 3
In particular near-IR spectroscopy will allow us to
extend the H2 excitation diagram into the hotter regime where we can start to distinguish between
dissociative or non-dissociative type of shocks This would have important implications for how the
energy cascades down from the large scale turbulence to the small cloud fragments
A proposal has been written to perform near-IR spectroscopy with the TripleSpec instrument in-
stalled on the Palomar 200-inch telescope PI PN Appleton The spectral R  2600 or v 
115 km s1 and spatial 1 resolution of TripleSpec is far superior to that of the Spitzer IRS and is
crucial to determine if the large velocity spread seen in the Mid-IR H2 lines   800  900 km s1
represents a single broad line or two separate narrow lines indicating both pre-and post shocked ma-

the non-dissociative case because the gas reaches higher temperatures Near-IR spectroscopy should
provide constrains on the contribution from non-ionizing shocks to the H2 emission This would help
in determining if these shocks can contribute to other line emission like O I 6300 for instance
I participated to our rst observation run at Palomar observatory to perform near-IR spectroscopy
with the newly-commissioned TripleSpec instrument in November 2008 with Phil Appleton and
Patrick Ogle Unfortunately the weather was very bad and we have only detected through the clouds
some H2 emission from the NGC 7319 Seyfert galaxy The proposal was re-submitted and accepted
for a new observation run in August 2009
65 Why is H2 such an important coolant
Our interpretation of mid-IR line emission but also optical and X-ray emission within the context
of a multiphase postshock gas suggests that observations can be understood in terms of dynamical
interactions between the ISM phases sect 651 Exchanges of mass and energy between the gas
phases seem a key to elucidate why the H2 power is so high in the ridge An efcient transfer of the
bulk kinetic energy of the gas to turbulent motions of much lower velocities within molecular clouds
seems required to make H2 a dominant coolant of the postshock gas sect 652 Here we briey
summarize and update the discussion of paper I sect 5 and 6
651 Mass and energy cycle between ISM phases
In the Stephans Quintet shock region observations and modeling suggest that the dissipation of the
mechanical energy of the collision between a galaxy and a tidail tail is the main source to power the X-
ray emission the optical and mid-IR line emission from the gas in the ridge The relative luminosities
from the different gas components depend on the dynamical coupling between the gas phases In this
section we propose a scenario for the postshock gas evolution that sketches the dynamical interaction
between ISM phases This interpretation introduces a physical framework that may apply to other as-
trophysical situations AGN-driven jets in radio-galaxies supernova remnants starburst-driven winds
Fig 612 sketches our view at the mass and energy exchanges between the different gas phases
that control the evolution of the postshock gas This cartoon is the same as Fig 6 of paper I except
that the values of the mass ows are updated for the full SQ ridge Black and red arrows represent the
mass ows between the H II H I warm and cold H2 gas components of the post-shock gas The large
arrow to the left symbolizes the relative motion between the warm and cold gas and the surrounding
plasma Each of the black arrows is labeled with its main associated process gas recombination and
ionization arrow number 1 H2 formation 2 and H2 cooling 3 The values of the mass ows and
the associated timescales are derived from observations and our model calculations
The total mass ow associated with the low-velocity component of MHD shocks required to re-
produce the H2 line uxes is much larger  68000 Mcid12 yr1 than the mass ow of recombining gas
derived from H observations  1260 Mcid12 yr1 The mass rates needed to account for the H OI
and H2 luminosities increases Therefore one cannot explain the H2 luminosity with only a contin-
uous cycle through the gas components from H II to cold H2 Heating of the cold H2 gas towards
warmer gas states red arrows needs to occur
65 Why is H2 such an important coolant

warm and cold H2 gas components They are numbered for clarity The dynamical interaction between
gas phases drives the cycle The mass ow values and associated timescales are derived from the H
OI and H2 luminosities and model calculations Heating of the cold H2 gas red arrows is necessary
to account for the increasing mass ow from the ionized gas to cold H2 phases
The main energy reservoir that can power these red arrows is the mechanical energy of the galaxy
collision We propose that mass and energy are transfered from cold molecular gas via shocks The
post-shock molecular cloud fragments are likely to experience a distribution of shock velocities de-
pending on their size and density Arrow number 4 represents the low velocity magnetic shocks
excitation of H2 gas that can account for the H2 emission described in sect 642 More energetic
shocks may dissociate the molecular gas arrows number 5 They are necessary to account for the
low H to O I 6300  luminosity ratio Even more energetic shocks may ionize the molecular gas
arrow number 6 This would bring cold H2 directly into the H II reservoir
The H II gas can also be produced by the turbulent mixing of the warm and cold gas with the hot
background plasma see sect 452 for a description of turbulent mixing layers This is represented by
the thin blue and orange arrows from the cold and warm molecular gas reservoirs to the hot plasma
This mixing produces gas at intermediate temperature a few 105 K that is thermally instable At
these temperatures the thermal sputtering of the dust is uneffective so dust is preserved This gas
cools back to produce H II gas that re-enters the cycle thin green arrow
An important question is to know whether there is a signicant mass of cold  50 K molecular

gas associated with the warm H2 This cold gas does not contribute to the H2 emission The mass
accumulated in this cold H2 reservoir depends on the ratio between the timescale of mechanical energy
dissipation on which gas is excited by shocks through one of the red arrows 4 5 and 6 and the cooling
timescale along the black arrow 3
Following the calculation made in sect 6 of paper I we estimate the timescale of dissipation of
the turbulent energy tturb and compare it to the cooling time of the warm H2 gas We assume that
the dissipation of turbulent energy powers the H2 emission so the energy dissipation rate Pturb must
be at least equal to the power radiated by H2 LH2 Thus we write the turbulent dissipation timescale
as the ratio of the total turbulent energy of the warm H2 gas Eturb to the total H2 power

In Eq 616 MH2 is the total warm H2 mass and turb is the turbulent velocity dispersion within the
warm H2 gas Using the H2 luminosity and the warm H2 mass in Table 61 we estimate a turbulent
dissipation timescale of  104 yr for a typical dispersion velocity of  10 km s1 This estimate of
the turbulent dissipation timescale is a lower limit since the dissipated power Pturb may be larger if it
powers the dissociative and ionizing shocks represented by the arrows 5 and 6 in Fig 612 Therefore
cold H2 gas would be heated by turbulent dissipation on timescales comparable to the cooling time of
the warm H2 gas that accounts for the S0 and S1 line emission 18  104 yr see table 64 If this
is correct the cold molecular gas mass should not be much higher than the warm H2 mass inferred
from the Spitzer observations
We compare the turbulent dissipation timescale to the dissipation timescale of the total bulk kinetic
energy of the warm H2 gas tTDK which can be written as the ratio between the H2 gas bulk kinetic
energy and H2 luminosity
tTDK  57  108
The turbulence dissipation timescale tturb is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than tTDK

652 Physics of the energy transfer qualitative discussion
We have shown that the bulk kinetic energy of the gas accelerated by the shock induced by the galaxy
collision has to be transfered efciently within molecular gas to explain the powerful H2 emission
However how this energy transfer occurs is far from being known We discuss here two possible
processes i the momentum transfer induced by the motion of clouds in the hot plasma and ii the
production of cosmic rays in the turbulent mixing layers The rst process is discussed in more details
in sect 61 of paper I
65 Why is H2 such an important coolant
Supersonic turbulence sustained by the motion of clouds
We remind that in our interpretation of the H2 emission in the SQ halo the formation of H2 gas arises
from the compression of shocked H I gas The two pre-collision H I complexes one associated with
the intruding galaxy NGC 7318b and the other with NGC 7319s tidal tail move at a relative velocity
of  900 km s1 with respect to each other While they are compressed and becoming H2 clouds
the clouds move at high velocity with respect to the background plasma because they keep their
preshock momentum In the collision the clouds do not share the same dynamics as the lower density
intercloud gas and the kinetic energy recorded in the  900 km s1 H2 line width is dominated by
the bulk motion of the H2 clouds in the plasma rest frame
The background ow applies drag forces on the clouds Murray and Lin 2004 Because of the
viscosity of the uid the dynamical friction shear forces between the cloud and the hot ow also
lead to a transport of momentum from the fast ow into the cloud Analytical and numerical studies of
shock-cloud interactions or studies of the interaction between an outow and molecular clouds seem
to show that the injection of momentum within cloud can feed supersonic turbulence within clouds
eg Kornreich and Scalo 2000 Matzner 2007 Carroll et al 2009 The turbulent energy injected
into the clouds is dissipated by low-velocity shocks into the dense molecular material Besides the
relative motion between cloud fragments can lead to cloud-cloud collisions which results in the dis-
sipation of kinetic energy preferentially in the molecular gas because it is the coldest component with
the lowest sound speed
In addition to dynamics the thermodynamics of the multiphase gas is a key to understand the
energy transfers between the phases First the cooling of the gas transfers the turbulent energy of
the hotter H II and H I phases to the H2 gas Secondly the thermal instability is also an efcient
mechanism to convert the thermal energy to turbulent kinetic energy Numerical simulations Suther-
land et al 2003 Audit and Hennebelle 2005 show that the thermal instability inhibits energy-loss
through radiation from the warmer gas and feeds turbulence in the cooler gas The turbulent velocities
generated by the thermal instability are found to be of the order of the sound speed in the warmer gas
and are thus supersonic for the colder gas
H2 heating by cosmic rays produced in turbulent mixing layers
An alternative mecanism to transfer the bulk kinetic energy of the gas to H2 heating is the production
of cosmic-ray particles in the turbulent mixing layers that would scatter within the molecular clouds
and excite H2 molecules see sect 34 for a description of H2 excitation by cosmic rays In sect 641
we show that the average cosmic-ray ionization rate in the SQ ridge is likely to be too low to balance
the H2 cooling The advantage of cosmic-ray acceleration in mixing layers is that cosmic-ray particles
are produced locally and can diffuse into the H2 gas Cosmic rays are accelerated by the Fermi
mechanism and can in turn generate turbulence and MHD waves into the molecular gas if they are
accelerated to velocities faster than the local Alfvn speed These processes are reviewed by Scalo
and Elmegreen 2004 see their sect 4 and we direct the reader to this review for references
The two processes discussed above shocks induced by momentum transfer or cosmic ray excita-
tion produced by turbulent mixing are two alternative means to cascade the bulk kinetic energy of the
gas on large scales to small-scale dissipation withinthe H2 gas From an astrophysical point of view

the most important point is that the H2 emission traces the dissipation of the bulk kinetic energy of
the system
66 Optical and mid-IR ne structure line diagnostics
In the previous sections we have shown that the dominance of the H2 line cooling in the SQ shock
region would require an efcient cascade of energy from the large-scale bulk kinetic energy of the
gas to small-scale turbulent motions within the H2 gas However the H2 rotational lines observed
by Spitzer do not provide a complete budget of the kinetic energy dissipation in the SQ ridge These
low-excitation lines trace gas between  50 1000 K and therefore they only sample a narrow range
of shock velocities Within the framework of our interpretation of the H2 emission the high-speed
collision of two ows of multiphase gas we expect a broad distribution of shock velocities
Fast shocks may lead to the line emission from ionized gas which up to now has not been
considered This section adresses the following questions is the emission from the ionized gas an
important component of the energetics in the SQ ridge Is H2 really a dominant coolant We rst
describe optical imaging and spectroscopy as well as mid-IR ne-struture line maps from our new
Spitzer IRS observations We use line ratios diagnostics to infer the shock properties from the ionized

image is a combination of two images centered at 6569 280 km s1 and 6611 2200 km s1 and
thus mainly exhibits the NGC 7320 foreground galaxy The white contours clearly show an extended
and clumpy North-South H lament that spatially correlates with the radio emission in the ridge
as well as an East-West feature we called it the bridge that connects the nucleus of the Seyfert
2 NGC 7319 with the North-South ridge In addition emission-line regions associated with the new
intruder and with the northern SQ-A region are detected
The two background images on Fig 66 show H Fabry-Prot images from Sulentic et al 2001
centered at  6600 km s1 left panel and  5600 km s1 right panel These images show different
morphologies The 6600 km s1 image shows the North-South clumpy linear shock structure the
core of NGC 7319 and its bridge and the SQ-A starburst On the 5600 km s1 image the intra-
group emission has an arc shape with brighter emission in the southern region This southern arc
is comprised of a string of H knots that connects to the east end of the faint bar in the new intruder
NGC 7318b This southern arc may be material disrupted from NGC 7318b that has been compressed
by the shock This arc almost connects to a fainter string starting from the core of NGC 7318a then
forming a peculiar smily face the cores of NGC 7318 a and b would be the eyes of this giant
smiley also clearly visible on the UV see the central panel of Fig 65 and mid-IR see chapter 8
images Note that in some regions the two velocities components have similar morphologies see also
Fig 2 of Xu et al 1999 This emission may arise from gas at intermediate velocities  6000 km s1
that may be shock-accelerated material from the new intruder
Up to now very few high signal-to noise optical spectra in the SQ ridge have been published
Xu et al 2003 performed optical spectroscopy with the Palomar 200 telescope at several positions
along the SQ ridge In the center of the shock the ux ratios are
FO I 6300FH   N II  053
IS II 6717 6731IH   N II  109
IO III 5007IH   1 
These ratios are different from those observed in H II regions and suggest shock excitation Based
on the shock models by Dopita and Sutherland 1995 Xu et al 2003 conclude that these lines are
predominantly excited by fast Vs  100 km s1 shocks In fact the O I  H line ratio is so high
that it is difcult to explain this ratio only with fast shock models see sect 663
Optical emission lines are mainly detected at three velocities 6800 6100 and 6400 km s1 The
H  N II S II and O II lines are detected predominently at 6100 km s1 and the O III 5007
line is detected at 6800 km s1 The O I 6300  line is centered at 6400 km s1 and is remarkably
broad with a FWHM v cid39 1130 km s1 The width of the line is commensurate with the relative
velocity between the intruder and the tidal tail

energy is equivalent to the kinematic energy of  107 supernovae
662 Distribution of the ne-structure line emission
Appleton et al 2006 reported the detection of the Ne II 128 m and Si II 348 m lines
Thanks to the deeper spectral maps we have access to the spatial distribution of emission from the
Fe II 2599 m and O IV 2589 m blend S III 3348 m Si II 3482 m Ne II 128 m
and Ne III 1556 m lines
Fig 4 and 5 of paper II show the intensity contours of these ne-structure lines overlaid on H2
S1 and X-ray maps The strong Si II3482 m emission spatially correlates with the H2 and X-ray
emission whereas the Fe II2599 m line emission is only detected towards the AGN NGC 7319
and the center of the ridge where there is a bright spot of X-ray emission We direct the reader to
sect 32 of paper II for a detailed description of these ne-structure line emission maps We now
discuss the interpretation of these observations with models that allow to constrain the gas physical
conditions and the dominant excitation mechanisms shocks X-rays photoionization
663 Optical and mid-IR ne structure lines as shock diagnostics
The deep mid-IR spectral mapping data presented above allow to complement the analysis of the
rotational H2 lines with the ne-structure line emission from the SQ ridge see sect 62 for a descrip-
tion of the observational results These metal lines provide complementary diagnostics to probe the
physical conditions of the emitting gas and more energetic excitation mechanisms Since the main
shock region the X-ray ridge also contains star forming regions we have selected a sub-region of
our extended IRS spectral mapping so-called center because it is located in the central region of
the ridge that has less contamination by star-forming regions see sect 4 Fig 7 of paper II We
compare the line ratio diagnostics within these two apertures
Optical spectroscopy diagnostics show that the SQ shock can be classied as a LINER Low
Ionization Excitation Region We will show in this section that the gas must be heated to cid38 105 K by
collisional excitation to explain the optical and mid-IR ne-structure line emission
We use the Allen et al 2008 shock model library described in sect 44 to compare models with
the ne structure line ratios measured with Spitzer IRS data The model results depend on the preshock

Observed values are the horizontal solid lines in colors
magnetic parameter b  BnH where B is the magnetic eld strength and nH the preshock gas
density In the models presented here we assume b  1 which is slightly lower than the equipartition
value of 323 We compare the model results with and without the radiative precursor The radiative
precursor of a fast shock moving into low-density gas adds an emission component which has the
spectral characteristics of photoionized gas with a high ionization parameter To neglect the precursor
may be relevant if the shock is propagating in a clumpy medium because only a fraction of the ionizing
photons will interact with the molecular gas see sect 45
The S III lines ratios are shown on Fig 614 as a function of the shock velocity The bro-
coloured lines are the observed values The electron critical densities of the S III3348 m and
ken curves are the shock models for different preshock gas densities 1  1000 cm3 The solid
S III1871  lines are ne  12  103 cm3 and ne  104 cm3 respectively The observed ratio
for the full ridge 246 is close to the low density limit ne  100 cm3 see Fig 615 and details in
Martn-Hernndez et al 2002 The comparison with shock models show that the gas preshock den-
sity is smaller than  1 cm3 The lower limit for the shock sub-region is compatible with preshock
gas densities smaller than 100 cm3 and shock velocities 100  Vs  300 km s1 The S III
lines ratio diagnostic clearly shows that the mid-IR line emission from the ionized gas originates
from moderate shocks of the order of 100 km s1 in low-density  1 km s1 Faster shocks in
 2  105 K cm3
denser gas would not be compatible with the available ram pressure in the surrounding hot plasma

to X-rays see Fig 8 of Maloney et al 1996 XDRs models have been used to interpret the line
emission from AGN Powerfull Si II line emission can also be produced by shock excitation whereas
the S III mid-IR lines are mostly tracers of H II regions Therefore the Si II  S III line ratio
measures the ratio between the X-rays or shocks and photoionization excitation powers

not detected in the sub-region in the center of the shock so we indicate an lower limit for the line

The Si II  S III SQ line ratios stand out above typical values observed in star-forming regions

seems to be consistent with  100 km s1 shocks into nH cid39 10 cm3 gas Unlike the sub-region
the SQ-A starburst line ratios are consistent with the values observed in standard extragalactic star-
forming regions This shows that photoionization must be the dominant process in this region with a
minor contribution from shocks
The Fig 617 shows the Ne III1556  Ne II128 line ux ratio as a function of the shock
velocity left panel or as a function of the Si II  Ne II  Ne III line ratio For our range of
preshock densities 11000 cm3 the shock models show that the observed line ratios are consistent
with shock velocities of  100  200 km s1
Xu et al 2003 suggest that the optical lines ratios observed in the center of the ridge see
sect 661 are evidence for a dominant shock excitation The mid-IR ne structure lines detected
by Spitzer conrm this conclusion However the large value of the O I  H line ratio observed in
the ridge FO I 6300FH   N II  053 is difcult to explain with fast shocks models
Fig 618 shows the Ne II to Ne III ratio as a function of the O I  H optical line ratio In the left
panel where the precursor is included the observed value do not match with the models The mid-IR
Ne II to Ne III line ratio in SQ suggest a low ionization parameter whereas the radiative precursor
produces a highly-ionized medium ahead of the shock This apparent contradiction can be solved if
the SQ intragroup medium is clumpy In this case a large fraction of the ionizing photons can es-
cape from the medium without interacting with the dense phase If we neglect the radiative precursor
right panel we nd a much better agreement with the models The line ratios are reproduced for a
preshock density of nH  10  102 cm3 and a shock velocity of Vs  200  250 km s1 These
67 Remarks about the NGC 7319 Seyfert galaxy
conditions imply high values of the postshock pressure as compared with the ambient value Note that
a signicant contribution from non-ionizing J-shocks contribute to the optical lines in particular to
the O sc i 6300 line see sect 433 This will be further discussed in sect 651
In sect 6 of paper II we discuss the Fe II 2599 m and Si II3482 m line emission The
fact that the observed Fe II  Ne II and Si II  Ne II line ratios are both smaller than the shock
model values can be interpreted as evidence for Si and Fe depletion onto dust grains see Fig 11 of
paper II This supports our idea that dust survives in the dense gas phases that are the sites for H2
formation This will be further discussed in chapter 8 where we model the dust emission from the
molecular gas in SQ
664 Conclusion a distribution of shock velocities
The X-ray optical and mid-IR line emissions from the SQ shock suggest that the gas experiences a
wide distribution of shock velocities We relate this distribution of shock velocities with a distribution
of preshock gas densities due to the multiphasic nature of the preshock medium paper I The denser
gas phases are associated with the smaller shock velocities
Very fast shocks Vs  700 km s1 driven into preshock gas of a few 103 cm3 are responsible
for the bright X-ray emission in the ridge Optical lines and mid-IR ne-structure lines are likely to
be produced by intermediate 100  Vs  300 km s1 ionizing J-shocks A signicant contribution
from non-ionizing J-shocks can also contribute to these lines in particular to the O I 6300 which
may help in explaining the very high value of O I H  Fe II 2599 m and Si II3482 m
lines And last but not least low-velocity 5  20 km s1 non-dissociative C-shocks driven into
dense gas  103 cm3 are associated to the rotational H2 emission seen by Spitzer
67 Remarks about the NGC 7319 Seyfert galaxy
671 Observational context and AGN in the SQ group
In this short paragraph I gather some observational results about the NGC 7319 galaxy Although not
related to the SQ main shock itself these results are helpful to interpret our recent extended IR and
CO observations of SQ
van der Hulst and Rots 1981 rst detected the NGC 7319 AGN with radio continuum VLA
observations of SQ at 20cm They detected a bright compact source with a jet-like extension and
suggested this might be related to those found in Seyfert galaxies Huchra et al 1982 obtained the
optical spectrum which shows clearly Sy2-type emission-line features Based on the stellar velocity
dispersion Woo and Urry 2002 estimated a black hole mass of 24107 Mcid12 Aoki et al 1999 made
VLA A-array radio continuum observations complimented with an archival HST optical image They
found a chain of 3 radio sources interpreted as the nucleus and its two jets on opposite sides Optical
features are found in the HST image closely related to the radio jets interpreted as gas compressed
and excited by bow shocks driven into the ambient medium by the jets This is different from the
so-called extended emission line regions EELR which are supposedly excited by the AGN radiation
Aoki et al 1996
6 Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephans Quintet
Even higher resolution 016 radio continuum observations at 1658 MHz using MERLIN were
reported by Xanthopoulos et al 2004 They compared the data with an HSTACS U-band F330W
image and found extended UV emission around the nucleus and the northern jet They argued that this
indicates star formation triggered by the jetISM interaction By assuming the diffuse radio emission
outside the compact sources is due to the star formation they estimated that the SFR in the circum-
nuclear region is 84 Mcid12 yr1 However all of the optical spectra of emission line regions in the
circum-nuclear region show Seyfert or LINER line ratios and none is H II region-like Aoki et al
1996 indicating that most of the radio and UV radiation is related to the AGN andor the shocks
Comparing the UV and MIR observations Xu et al 2005 found the AGN and the surrounding
region is highly obscured with an FUV extinction of AFUV  54 mag consistent with the Sy2
classication
672 The H2 bridge AGN-driven outow or tidal interactions
Our new Spitzer spectral maps presented in sect 62 show that the H2 emission extends from the ridge
to the core of the AGN NGC 7319 This H2 bridge feature is also seen on the 14 GHz radio image
see Fig 64 and Williams et al 2002 on H  maps see Fig 613 and Xu et al 1999 Plana et al
1999 Sulentic et al 2001 Gutirrez et al 2002 and faintly detected in X-rays see Fig 68 and
Trinchieri et al 2003 2005 The distribution of the H2 emission seems to correlate with that of the
radio emission
The origin of the H2 bridge is unclear Is it related to the AGN activity of NGC 7319 or is
it related to past or recent galaxy interactions Optical spectroscopy Aoki et al 1996 and VLA
radio observations Aoki et al 1999 seem to support the rst hypothesis Indeed Aoki et al 1996
interpret the large velocity gradients between the AGN core and the South-West bridge as an high-
speed  500 km s1 jet-induced outow of gas The very high electron density in the outow 
600 cm3 twice that of the nucleus and the multiple radio structure in the jet suggest that the outow
is interacting with interstellar matter The H2 emission in this bridge may then be powered by jet-
driven shocks within dense clouds orand AGN radiation Cluver et al 2009 propose an alternative
explanation the bridge is a remnant of previous tidal interactions This scenario is suggested by the
similarity between the mid-IR spectrum and X-ray properties of the ridge and bridge regions This
picture ts in the context of multiple shock heating events proposed by Moles et al 1997 Sulentic
et al 2001 OSullivan et al 2009b The two scenarios AGN-driven outow and galaxy-wide
shock are difcult to disentangle because they lead to similar observational signatures Our new CO
observations in the ridge and in the bridge set a new light on this question and we will discuss this
further in sect 73
68 Summary and conclusions
One of the most interesting features of the Stephans Quintet compact group is the presence of a
galaxy-wide shock in the halo of the group created by an intruding galaxy colliding with a tidal tail at a
relative velocity of  1 000 km s1 Evidence for a group-wide shock comes from observations of X-
rays from the hot postshock gas in the ridge strong radio synchrotron emission from the radio emitting
plasma and shocked-gas excitation diagnostics from optical emission lines Spitzer observations show
69 Publication paper II
that this gas also contains molecular hydrogen with an extreme velocity dispersion The H2 luminosity
is larger than the X-ray emission from the same region thus the H2 line emission dominates over X-
ray cooling in the shock As such it plays a major role in the energy dissipation and evolution of the
postshock gas
The interpretation of these observations is the core of my PhD work I present a scenario where H2
gas forms out of the postshock gas that results from the supersonic collision between two multiphase
gas streams This collision leads to a multiphase medium with a distribution of shock velocities
related to the variations of the density in the preshock medium The H2 formation in the SQ ridge
environment is quantied by calculating the time-dependent isobaric cooling of the gas including
dust destruction mechanisms I show that H2 forms out of the dense regions where dust survives the
shocks The bulk kinetic energy of the molecular gas is the main energy reservoir of the postshock
gas and it has to be dissipated within the H2 gas to explain the poserful H2 excitation I propose that
supersonic turbulence is sustained within the molecular gas by a transfer of momentum induced by
cloud-cloud collisions and the relative shear motions between the molecular gas and the hot plasma
A phenomenological model of low-velocity MHD shocks driven into the dense H2 gas is capable of
explaining the observed excitation characteristics
Within this framework dust is a key ingredient
It is required for H2 formation Our model
has implications on the expected dust emission in the SQ halo and on dust survival in a multiphase
environment These points are adressed in chapter 8 as well as a discussion of star formation in the
SQ group

Cold molecular gas in Stephans Quintet
Continuous eloquence wearies Grandeur must be abandoned to
be appreciated Continuity in everything is unpleasant Cold is
agreeable that we may get warm
Blaise Pascal
Abstract
The warm  50 K H2 gas detected by Spitzer in the halo of the Stephans Quintet SQ group
does not provide a complete inventory of the molecular gas Gas colder than  50 K does not
contribute to the mid-IR H2 emission In order to determine the physical state the mass and
kinematics of the molecular gas in SQ it is crucial to look for cold molecular gas This chapter
presents the previous CO obervations of the group and the results of two observation campaigns
at the IRAM 30m telescope that I have conducted from the writing of the proposal to the data
analysis

71 Introduction
Within the evolutionary picture of the Stephans Quintet SQ postshock gas presented in sect 651
it is fundamental to know whether cold molecular gas  50 K is associated with the warm
H2 gas In star forming galaxies the warm molecular gas accounts for about a few percent of the total
cold H2 gas inferred from the CO luminosity Roussel et al 2007 What is the cold to warm H2
gas mass ratio in SQ This is a major open question about the physical state and mass budget of the
molecular gas
According to our model of formation of molecules in the SQ shock CO should form on the same
timescale as H2 However because the cold gas may be continuously energized by turbulent energy
dissipation the physical state of the shocked gas is likely to be different from that of GMCs in galactic
disks These observations are crucial to test our scenario of H2 formation in the postshock gas and to
obtain the kinematics of the molecular gas which cannot be obtained from the low-resolution Spitzer
observations of the H2 alone
Past interferometric observations do not show any CO signal associated with the H2-emitting
ridge Previous single-dish observations are mostly concentrated on the southern tidal features or on
the northern starburst region SQ-A Therefore we decided to embark on an observation campaign
with the IRAM 30-meter telescope to search for CO emission in the SQ ridge I have carried on this
campain from the beginning writing of the proposal to the end data reduction and analysis through
the observations at the telescope This was one of the great experiences I had the chance to live during
Before presenting our new observations with the IRAM 30-meter telescope sect 73 and some
preliminary results sect 74 I rst review the context of the previous CO observation in the SQ
72 Previous CO observations of Stephans Quintet molecular gas out-
side galaxies
Before the discovery of warm T  150 K molecular hydrogen in SQ sect 52 CO emitting gas
was detected in the group I summarize here the history and main results of these CO detections
The rst millimeter CO observations only allowed to detect cold molecular gas in NGC 7319 Yun
et al 1997 Verdes-Montenegro et al 1998 Leon et al 1998 which contains 48  109 Mcid12 Smith
and Struck 2001 Given its blue luminosity of LB  55  1010 Lcid12 Verdes-Montenegro et al

cfrom interferometric observations by Gao and Xu 2000 with the BIMA array The velocity of the CO clump do not
match with the optical redshift of the galaxy 5760 km s1 The emission is also offset from the nucleus of NGC 7318b

eforeground galaxy from Verdes-Montenegro et al 1998
1998 this yields a normal ratio of LBMH2  11 Lisenfeld et al 2002 Thanks to the BIMA1
interferometer Gao and Xu 2000 Petitpas and Taylor 2005 showed that 34 of the CO gas in
NGC 7319 is lying outside its nuclei mostly in an extended northern region
Molecular gas outside galactic disks associated with the IGM starburst SQ-A was rst detected
by Gao and Xu 2000 using BIMA Then single dish observations by Smith and Struck 2001
and Lisenfeld et al 2002 conrmed this spectacular result Fig 71 presents an overview of these
observations and table 71 gathers observational results from the litterature All the cold H2 masses
in this table are derived assuming a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor of N H2ICO  2 
1020 cm2 K km s11 which explains why the values quoted here may be different from those of
the litterature Two velocity components were detected one centered at  6000 km s1 and the other
at  6700 km s1 These velocities match the redshifts of the two H I gas systems found in the same
region see sect 633 Lisenfeld et al 2002 found that there is more molecular gas 31 109 Mcid12
in SQ-A than in the H I gas 16  109 Mcid12
Interestingly past observations with interferometers have not detected any CO gas in the main
shock region The single-dish observations by Lisenfeld et al 2002 with the IRAM 30m telescope
partially overlap the main shock region and show  3 detection of CO in the northern region of the
ridge We note that they include this emission in the SQ-A budget Their observations do not cover
entirely the shock region Gao and Xu 2000 Smith and Struck 2001 Petitpas and Taylor 2005

The gas metallicity in SQ-A and SQ-B is slightly higher than solar Xu et al 2003 Lisenfeld
et al 2004 This is a strong indication that the gas in these regions has been pulled out from the inner
part of a galaxy disk or maybe several disks by tidal interactions
73 New CO observations in the SQ ridge
Since none of the past CO observations in SQ yielded detections from the main area of interaction
between the new intruder NGC 7318b and the intragroup tidal tail we decided to search for the
CO counterpart of the warm H2 gas seen by Spitzer Our recent results are the result of an iterative
process that has involved three observing runs Before showing that these results signicantly change
our view at the molecular gas in SQ sect 74 I rst quickly review the history of our observing runs
731 History of our CO observations
In September 2007 we submitted a proposal PI P Guillard to observe the 2-1CO line from the SQ
shock with the multi-beam 3  3 pixels HERA receiver2 installed on the IRAM3 30-meter single-
dish telescope in Pico Veleta Spain The previous observations by Lisenfeld et al 2002 did not
cover entirely the SQ ridge Moreover based on the fact that the H2 emission is extended we argued
that much of the CO emission associated with the shock has been missed by previous interferometric
observations We thought that HERA would provide us both the spatial distribution and kinematics of
the molecular gas across the shock front
Franois and I performed the observations in January 2008 but we did not detect any obvious sig-
nal No line was clearly detected The Fig 72 shows the CO2-1 HERA spectra in red averaged on
the 9 pixels Only a constant baseline was subtracted in the data reduction In the eastern and western
A  1 mK and broad full width  500 km s1 lines
groupintruder regions there may be weak T 
at the right and left ends of the bandpass which was  1200 km s1 In the shock region these
observations set an upper limit on the cold component of the molecular gas of a few 1020 H2 cm2
for a standard H2CO conversion factor This upper limit is roughly the surface density of the warm
 200 K molecular gas detected by Spitzer
To conrm or not this puzzling result we wanted to make sure that the CO emission had not
been subtracted in the baseline in case it had a large linewidth cid38 1000 km s1 comparable to that
of the ionized gas as measured by optical lines eg the 6300 O I line Therefore we submitted
a DDT proposal PI P Guillard to observed the 1-0CO line with the single-pixel A-B receivers
arguing that we would double the bandwidth we had with HERA 2-1CO observations The proposal
was accepted and observed in March 2008 by an astronomer on duty However when writing up the
proposal we did not realize that the bandwidth of the A-B receivers is half 512 MHz the bandwidth
of HERA 1 GHz So we faced the same problem of baseline tting The top spectrum in Fig 72
shows the averaged CO1-0 spectrum obtained with the AB receivers The spectral resolution is
 13 km s1 Two very weak lines at 6050 and 6130 km s1 are perhaps detected but this hypothetic
detection is unreliable  3

732 Observations with the new EMIR reveiver at IRAM 30m telescope
In March-April 2009 a new heterodyne receiver EMIR 4 was installed and commissioned at the 30m
telescope It replaces the former ABCD single-pixel receivers EMIR provides a bandwidth of 4 GHz
in each of the two orthogonal linear polarizations for the 3 2 13 and 09 mm atmospheric windows
This increase in bandwith is crucial for our study since we expect that the CO line width to be broad
 1 000 km s1 The four EMIR bands are designated as E090 E150 E230 and E330 according to
their approximate center frequencies in GHz
A proposal was submitted in March 2009 PI P Guillard to observe the CO1-0 transition
We required 32 hours of observations Our goal was to reach a 03 mK rms noise on the T 
A scale
at 113 GHz for a spectral resolution of 100 kms The proposal was accepted but only 16h were
allocated I carried on the observations in June 28-30 2009 I briey give some observational details

Our observations were concentrated on the CO1-0 line because of summer weather conditions
In addition we were able to connect the third and fourth parts of the WILMA backend to the hori-
zontal and vertical polarizations of the E230 band So we observed the CO1-0 and CO2-1 lines at
11527 GHz and 23054 GHz To increase the redundance for the CO1-0 data we used in parallel
the 4 MHz lterbank with both polarizations connected to the E090 band The receivers were tuned
to 11286 GHz and 22572 GHz which corresponds to a redshift of 6400 km s1 The observations
were done in wobbler switching mode with a wobbler throw of 120 in azimuthal direction This ob-
servation mode provides accurate background subtraction and good quality baselines which is crucial
for our study Pointing and focus were monitored every 2h in stable conditions and every 1h during
A scale The forward effciency
of the telescope was 094 and 091 at 115 and 230 GHz and the beam effciency was 078 and 058
respectively Our half-power beam size was 22 at 115 GHz and 11 at 230 GHz
sunrise System temperatures were  150200 K at 115 GHz on the T 
The data was reduced with the IRAM GILDAS 5 software package version of July 2009 The
lowest quality spectra typically with  cid38 30 mK for a 3 min on-source integration were rejected We
only subtract a constant when doing baseline tting Unfortunately we experienced problems with
the vertical polarization These spectra show weird features and have been simply removed for this
preliminary analysis

the positions of our pointing blue circles of diameter 22 arcsec corresponding to the half-power

7 Cold molecular gas in Stephans Quintet
Coming back to the previous observation run  
The reason why we did not detect any clear signal during our previous observations with HERA or
the ABCD receivers is not completely clear for us The possible explanations are the following
First for the CO1-0 ABCD position see Fig 72 we may have missed the molecular gas rich
ridge because the position was not exactly centered on the H2 ridge The central beam position was
offset to the East of the Appleton et al 2006 position because we wanted to avoid the contamination
from star-forming regions However we did not have the full IRS mapping and the mid-IR imaging
at that time so did not have any idea about the extent of the CO emission So we may have offset our
central position too much thus diluting the signal in the beam This may explain the non detection
if the CO gas is conned to a  25cid48cid48-wide ridge However since the H2 emission seems a bit more
extended the beam dilution does not seem to be a very strong argument
Second during our rst run we had lots of problems with the WILMA backend Several pixels of
HERA were not usable especially pixels 9 and 7 which were unfortunately located in the ridge For
the second DDT run with the ABCD receiver a lot of spectra also show weird features and I had to
throw away  30 of spurious spectra These technical problems may also have entrained calibration
issues in the data
The non-detection in our previous HERA and ABCD observations led me to double-check my
data reduction for the new EMIR observations I have checked that the signal is reproductible from
one day of observation to another and search for any spurious features in the spectra These checks
and the fact that the line velocities are in very good agreement with H I velocities allow to conrm
our new results presented in the following
74 Preliminary results
Since the data has been taken very recently we present here a preliminary analysis that points out the
main observational results about the mass of molecular gas in the system and its kinematics
741 Distribution and mass of molecular gas
In Fig 73 we show the averaged CO1-0 spectra for each of the ve observed positions The spectra
are plotted over the full available bandwidth  8000 km s1 at 115 GHz at a spectral resolution
of 42 km s1 CO is detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio for all the pointings This result is in
sharp contrast with the previous interferometric observations where almost no CO was detected in the
ridge It shows that the CO emission is extended and associated with the extended H2 emission The
noise in the spectra are  05  07 mK at a resolution of 42 km s1 The CO2-1 is also detected
but the quality of the spectra is much poorer than the CO1-0 because of a shorter integration time
and moderate weather conditions This is why we only show the CO1-0 spectra here
The central velocity 0 km s1 on the plots corresponds to the recession velocity of 6400 km s1
at which the receivers were tuned The CO1-0 signal extends over the velocity range  5700 
7000 km s1 and perhaps until 7400 km s1 for the ridge 1 position see comment below Multiple
velocity components are detected pointing out the complexity of the kinematics of the CO gas in the
system see next paragraph below for a discussion of the kinematics The gures 74 and 75 shows a

mass of molecular gas in the ridge is at least 25  109 Mcid12 It is only a factor of 2 larger than
the total warm H2 mass seen by Spitzer in the ridge 12  109 Mcid12 see table 61 The mass of

that partially overlaps the north of the ridge However because of a limited bandwith they
only detect the 6000 and 6700 km s1 velocity components and they miss the higher velocity
component at 6900 km s1 that seem to contain almost half of the mass in the core region of SQ-
A see table 73 Based on our new IR maps we estimate the area of SQ-A to be  40cid48cid48
 40cid48cid48
If we scale the mass we nd in our aperture  to this larger aperture we nd a total mass of
cold H2 of 26  109 Mcid12 This is comparable to the mass derived by Lisenfeld et al 2002
which is the result of a lucky compensation between two effects the over-estimate of the mass
in SQ-A because of a large aperture and the under-estimate because of the non-detection of the
6900 km s1 component
CO in NGC 7319s bridge Summing over all velocities we nd MH2  12  109 Mcid12 within our
aperture  Note that our aperture matches quite well the width of the bridge but does not cover
its whole extension towards the AGN Therefore the total mass of molecular gas in the bridge
may be a factor of  2 larger Smith and Struck 2001 nd  5  109 Mcid12 within a half-power
beam of 55 centered on the nucleus of NGC 7319 This beam overlaps our bridge region
These observations represent a substantial revision of the mass and energy budgets of the collision
The rst striking result is that we detect in the ridge and in the bridge features a comparable amount
of molecular gas to that of SQ-A The CO emission in the intragroup medium is then very extended
and in total SQ-A  ridge  bridge cid38 65  109 Mcid12 of cold H2 gas is lying outside the galactic
disks of the group Although it represents a huge mass of molecular gas most of this gas appears to
be inefcient at forming stars except in SQ-A see chapter 8
Interestingly assuming a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor we nd that the ratio of the cold
to warm H2 masses is  2 in the ridge This ratio is much smaller than in galaxies where the mass
of cold molecular gas is 1  2 orders of magnitude greater than the warm H2 mass MH2cold 
10  100  MH2warm Roussel et al 2007 This preliminary result seems in agreement with our
interpretation of the H2 emission in terms of a continuous heating by dissipation of turbulent energy
see sect 651
742 Complex kinematics of the CO gas
Fig 73 clearly show the complexity of the kinematics of the CO gas in the SQ group The shape
of the spectra varies a lot from one position to another Multiple velocity components are detected
see Fig 74 and 75 for detailed view at the spectra with some reference velocities overlaid The
four main components are at 5700 6000 6700 and 6900 km s1 see table 73 for the precise central
line velocities derived from line tting Note that the H I velocities detected in SQ are 5700 6000
associated with the intruder gas and 6700 km s1 associated with the tidal tail to the south of
NGC 7319 The velocity component at 6900 km s1 is a new feature that we detect only in the SQ-A
region It was not seen before in CO or H I because of limited velocity coverage The main general
results are the following
 the gas associated with the intruder NGC 7318b 5700  6000 km s1 and with the intragroup
medium the tidal tail 6700 km s1 are both detected along the full North-South extension of
the ridge and in the bridge eastern feature towards NGC 7319 as well
7 Cold molecular gas in Stephans Quintet
 gas at intermediate velocities in between that of the intruder and that of the intragroup is
detected There is a broad component centered at  6400 km s1 in the ridge 1 2 and in
the bridge positions Interestingly this intermediate component seems to be absent or very
weak  2 in SQ-A and vanishes at the southern end of the main shock region ridge 3
The 6400 km s1 CO velocity component is consistent with the central velocity of the broad
resolved H2 S1 line at 6360 100 km s1 see Appendix B of paper II for a re-analysis of the
Appleton et al 2006 high-resolution IRS spectrum This is the rst time CO gas is detected at
these intermediate velocities and this gas is associated with the warm H2 seen by Spitzer This
detection support the idea that molecular gas is formed out of gas accelerated in the shock
 The CO line velocity components are very broad suggesting that the kinematics of the CO gas
is highly disturbed The FWHM of the main CO1-0 lines are of the order of 100400 km s1
with an even broader signal  1000 km s1 at intermediate velocities see coments below
This suggests that huge velocity gradients are present in this region These broad line widths
are in agreement with the Appleton et al 2006 interpretation that the mid-IR H2 lines are
intrinsically very broad and resolved by the high resolution module of the IRS
Some specic comments about each regions are given in the following
SQ ridge In the ridge the line widths are of the order of 100  400 km s1 and lines seem to be
broader in the center ridge 2 than at the edges ridge 1 and 3 In the ridge 1 position and
perhaps ridge 2 the underlying intermediate component at 6400 km s1 is extremely broad
 1000 km s1 comparable to the relative velocity between the intruder and the intragroup
medium with a hint of emission between 6900 and 7400 km s1 see ridge 1 spectrum on
SQ-A In SQ-A three velocity components are detected at 6000 6700 and 6900 km s1 The line
widths are of the order of 100 km s1 with the smallest dispersion for the 6000 km s1 line The
broadest component at 6700 km s1 seems to have a left wing extending towards 6400 km s1
Interestingly the CO1-0 line widths are signicantly smaller in SQ-A than in the bridge and
this is perhaps a clue to understand why there is much more star formation in this region than
in the ridge This observational picture ts within our interpretation of two colliding gas ows
presented in sect 532 where the shear velocities between the ows are maximum in the
central region of the contact discontinuity ridge and smaller at the edges of the main shock
structure see chapter 4 sect 453 and Fig 5 of Lee et al 1996
NGC 7319s bridge The spectrum in the bridge is perhaps the most striking It shows a very broad
signal in between the extreme velocities detected in SQ-A 6000 and 6900 km s1 see Fig 74
This prole is well tted by a sum of 3 gaussians As discussed in sect 67 the origin of the
molecular gas in the bridge structure is an open question If an outow from the AGN is present
as suggested by Aoki et al 1996 molecular may be entrained from the disk or formed directly
in the outow see also sect 67 for observational details about NGC 7319 The molecular gas
in the bridge may also be the result of a previous tidal interaction with NGC 7320c for instance
that would have stripped some material from the galactic disk Then the interaction between
75 Astrophysical questions raised by CO observations
the new intruder and this tidal bridge would trigger further molecular gas formation in this
region We do not see any clear-cut argument to favor one of the two possibilities
75 Astrophysical questions raised by CO observations
These CO observations essentially raise two open questions one related to the dynamical coupling of
the molecular gas to the lower density phases and the other related to star formation Here are the
tracks we are following to tackle these two issues
751 How is the molecular gas accelerated
Observations shows that some of the CO gas lies at intermediate velocities between that of the intruder
NGC 7318b and that of the target ie NGC 7319s tidal tail The CO line widths match that of the
O I 6300  line from warm atomic gas This suggests that the cold molecular gas is dynamically
coupled to the lower density components
If the picture of two colliding multiphase gas ows is
correct these observations mean that in the reference frame of the surface discontinuity between the
two gas streams which may be materialized by the X-ray bright ridge the dense clouds has been
signicantly decelerated
This coupling seems difcult to explain if most of the molecular gas was preshock gas The high
density contrast between cold clouds and the hot tenuous ow would lead to deceleration timescales
longer than the shock age see sect 452 and therefore a weak coupling In our model of H2 forma-
tion in the shock the molecular gas is formed out of moderate density medium that is compressed and
decelerated while becoming molecular Therefore in this context the coupling is much more efcient
because the density contrast is much lower This in-situ formation is perhaps a solution to explain
the high velocity dispersion seen in the spectra although we do not exclude the presence of preshock
dense clouds
752 Driving Schmidt-Kennicut into a corner
Many galaxy collisions are observed to trigger IR-luminous bursts of star formation This is not
the case in SQ although a large reservoir of cold molecular gas is present in the area of interaction
between the two galaxies Fig 76 shows a diagram similar to the classical Schmidt-Kennicutt rela-
tionship Based on the empirical correlation between PAH emission and star formation in starbursts
Calzetti et al 2007 Pope et al 2008 the 77 m PAH emission is used as a tracer of star formation
The cold H2 mass is derived from the standard CO1-0 intensity to H2 mass conversion factor see
chapter 3 Eq 344 The SQ point corresponds to the ridge 1 position The PAH luminosity in the SQ
shock is integrated over a 18cid48cid48
 15cid48cid48 region centered on the CO1-0 beam of the ridge 1 position see
chapter 8 for details about how the PAH luminosity is calculated
We nd that SQ is offset from the correlation obtained with the SINGs sources data taken from
Roussel et al 2007 Interestingly SQ has a similar offset as the H2-luminous radio galaxies 3C326N
and 3C293 see chapter 9 for a discussion of 3C326N This plot clearly shows that star formation is
suppressed in the center of the shock as compared to star forming galaxies
7 Cold molecular gas in Stephans Quintet
Figure 76 Star-formation efciency assumed to be traced by the surface luminosity of the PAH
emission as a function of mass of cold H2 derived from the CO1-0 line intensity The hatched
line shows the relationship obtained for the SINGS sample where empty diamonds and lled dots
mark dwarf galaxies star-forming galaxies and AGN The SINGS data is from Roussel et al 2007
The lled pentagon shows the center of the SQ shock For comparison the lled triangles mark the
H2-luminous radio galaxies 3C326 N and 3C293
The molecular gas is observed to be more turbulent in the ridge than in SQ-A where star formation
is occuring This suggests that the dissipation of the mechanical energy may be an important process
in heating the molecular gas and perhaps quenching star formation see paper I and chapter 8 for a
more detailed discussion of star formation in SQ
76 Concluding remarks
These new CO observations provide a more complete inventory of the molecular gas in the SQ in-
tragroup medium Large amounts of CO emitting gas is detected both in the main shock region
and in the eastern bridge feature This gas is coexisting with warm H2 H II gas and X-ray emitting
hot plasma The CO1-0 lines are intrinsically broader outside the SQ-A and southern star-forming
regions suggesting that the galaxy collision has disturbed its kinematics within the group halo
A more detailed analysis and a paper is in preparation to estimate as precisely as possible the
mass excitation characteristics in particular the CO2-1 to CO1-0 line ratio and the full kinetic
energy of the molecular gas in the SQ shock This will lead to re-evaluate our prior estimate of the
dissipation timescale through H2 line emission The velocity structure will be used to distinguish
76 Concluding remarks
between preshock molecular gas and molecular gas formed out of gas that has been shocked and
decelerated in the collision In addition we will use MHD shock models similar to those used to
interpret the H2 line emission to compute the CO emission in shocks and compare the results with
the observations presented here

Dust emission in Stephans Quintet

Abstract
Kerry Livgren Kansas
In chapters 5 and 6 I propose an interpretation to the surprisingly bright H2 rotational line
emission from the Stephans Quintet SQ shock in which H2 gas forms out of the multiphase
postshock gas In this scenario dust is a key-element because its presence is required for H2
to form Therefore we expect that some of the dust emission comes from molecular gas This
chapter is a brief introduction to the work I did on the analysis and modeling of new Spitzer
imaging and spectroscopy of dust emission in the SQ ridge The associated paper is reproduced
in the manuscript I have analysed the characteristics of the PAH emission in the shock built a
complete IR spectral energy distribution of the shock and compare it to that of the diffuse Galactic
ISM In order to try to constrain the physical structure of the molecular gas a detailed modeling
of the dust emission in the SQ ridge has been performed and the model results compared to
observations

8 Dust emission in Stephans Quintet
81 Introduction
Dust shapes the spectra of galaxies dust absorbs1 scatters stellar light and re-emits this energy
in the infrared domain It is estimated that 30 or more of the energy emitted as starlight in the
Universe is re-radiated by dust in the infrared see Lagache et al 2005 for a review about the cosmic
IR background
Molecular hydrogen forms on dust grains Therefore dust is a key-element for our interpretation
of H2 emission from the SQ X-ray bright shock structure In paper I we show that H2 gas can form
out of the dense gas that is shocked to velocities sufciently low Vs  300 km s1 for dust to
survive One of the consequences of this interpretation is that some of the dust emission comes from
molecular gas Therefore in order to test this prediction I have embarked on a study and modeling
of the dust emission from the SQ shock which has been written in paper III Guillard et al 2009a
which will be soon submitted to AA This chapter will not review the content of the paper but rather
introduce the context of the past observations of dust emission from SQ as well as their interpretation
sect 821 Then I briey present the context of the new Spitzer observations sect 822 as well as
the paper III The section 84 concludes this chapter by opening the discussion about dust survival in
the violent SQ environment and more generally in the multiphase ISM
82 Observations of dust emission from Stephans Quintet
821 Past observations ISO
IRAS rst detected SQ in the infrared Allam et al 1996 Yun et al 1997 but it was barely resolved
The rst quantitative study of dust emission in the SQ group was made possible by the ISO2 space
observatory Xu et al 1999 2003 reported ISO observations that show that most of the mid-IR 113
and 15 m and Far-IR 60 and 100 m emission comes from the disks of NGC 7319 and of the
foreground galaxy NGC 7320 see Fig 81 Two intra-group medium IGM starbursts SQ-A and
SQ-B both including several previously detected H II regions stand out in the 15 m image due to
their strong mid-IR emission There is evidence for dust emission in the shock front Xu et al 2003
have modeled the ISOPHOT3 maps at 60 and 100 m to isolate emission from the shock Fig 81
However the angular resolution is marginally sufcient to separate the shock itself from the SQ-A
and SQ-B star forming regions
Based on ISO observations the total dust luminosity of the shock front is Ldust  19  1035 W
Xu et al 2003 This is about an order of magnitude higher than the X-ray luminosity Xu et al
2003 concluded that dust cooling may be a signicant cooling mechanism for the shock They
propose that the hot gas is predominantly cooled by electronic collisions with dust grains This con-
clusion is based on the comparison between the sputtering time scale of dust grains and the gas cooling
1The existence of the extinction of stellar light by interstellar dust was found by Trumpler 1930 by measuring the
angular diameter of star clusters They introduce a corrective term A in their estimate of the distance to the source
in order to take into account its overestimation due to the presence of dust Stebbins 1934 1935 rst showed that the
extinction follows a 1 law in the U B V bands This law in the optical shows that the grain size is of the order of the
wavelength ie 01 to 05 m

sion background subtracted at 100 m are overlaid on the ISO 15 m image Left The contour levels

time Assuming a constant Galactic mass-to-dust ratio the sputtering time of an a  01 m grain
is 37  106 yr compared to the gas cooling time of 21  106 yr Hence the big grains can indeed
survive the shock long enough However as shown in Smith et al 1996 and Guillard et al 2009c
the sputtering of dust grains in the hot T  106 K phase should have reduced signicantly the dust
to gas mass ratio on a timescale shorter than the gas cooling time see chapter 2 and discussion later
in paper III
822 New Spitzer observations
ISO observations have been followed up by Spitzer observations Appleton et al 2006 release a
spectacular composite image with IRAC see the cover front of this manuscript at 36 45 58
and 8 m Images at 16 and 24 m were obtained by our team and presented in Cluver et al 2009
and Guillard et al 2009a Longer wavelength images at 70 and 160 m were obtained by Xu et al
2008 They claim to detect a signicant diffuse dust emission outside individual galaxies amounting
to more than 50 of the total L160 m of SQ see also Natale in preparation Because of the better
correspondence between the morphology of the 160 m map and that of the X-ray map compared to
that between 160 m and H I the authors favor the possibility that the grains are collisionally heated
in the hot intra-group medium
The presence of H2 gas in the intragroup set a new perspective on the origin of the dust emission
in the ridge As introduced above we expect some dust emission from the H2 gas My work presented
in paper III explore this possibility

84 Perspectives on revisiting dust survival timescales impact of the
multiphase ISM structure
Observations of dust from PAHs to BGs in the violent SQ galaxy collision is certainly a challenge for
dust evolution models and has potentially important consequences for the estimate of dust survival in
the ISM
So far dust survival timescales are estimated by assuming that the shocked medium is homoge-
neous Within the context of the SQ shock the temperature of the hot plasma in constrains the shock
velocity in the tenuous gas to be  700 km s1 If we assume that the shocked medium is homoge-
neous all the dusty gas is shocked at these very high velocities and thus the dust destruction timescale
would be much shorter than the dust re-formation time
This issue is also true in the galactic ISM Let us give a rough estimate of the dust survival
timescale in an homogeneous medium following Jones 2004 Once a dust grain nds itself in
the ISM it is subject to destruction by supernova shock waves We calculate the the timescale for SN
shock waves to destroy all the dust in the ISM tSN R If vs is the efciency of grain destruction
by a shock of velocity vs Msvs is the mass of gas shocked to a velocity of at least vs SN the
interval between supernovae and MISM the total mass of the galactic ISM then the timescale for
grain destruction is given by
vsdMsvs 
Ms100 km s1
where  is the mean grain destruction parameter and Ms100 km s1 corresponds to a typical SN
shock that affects a sufcient volume of the ISM Now to determine the mass shocked to a velocity of
at least vs we exploit the conservation of the energy E released by the explosion of the SN and write
McKee 1989 McKee 1989
and then tSN R  
MISM SN
s  4  108 yr

and SN  30 yr On the other hand Jones 2004 estimate the dust formation timescale to be
tf  3109 yr Clearly by comparing tf and tSN R dust destruction is faster than stardust formation
This timescale discrepancy is clearly at odds with the observations of dust in the ISM The conclusion
that is generally given is that dust must be reformed in situ in the ISM This may be true but the
exact way dust is re-accreted and re-coagulated is still poorly known 
Stephans Quintet observations may suggest an alternative solution to the issue of dust survival in
the ISM As discussed in paper I the density inhomogeneities in the preshock medium allow the dust
to survive provided that the density contrast is high enough to reduce the transmitted shock velocity
The multiphase nature of the ISM may increase signicantly the overall dust survival timescale

H2 in galaxy evolution
There are 1011 stars in the galaxy That used to be a huge number
But its only a hundred billion Its less than the national decit
We used to call them astronomical numbers Now we should call
them economical numbers

Abstract
Molecular gas is the reservoir for star formation and thus plays a key role in galaxy evolution
However so far the molecular gas has been largely ignored in the description of galaxy evolu-
tion in a cosmological context In particular the response of the molecular gas to gas accretion
onto galactic disks galaxy merging feedback and its impact on the energetics of these major
evolutionary phases have so far not been addressed in detail H2-luminous galaxies open a new
perspective for the study of molecular gas in active phases of galaxy evolution Our interpretation
of the H2 emission from the Stephans Quintet galaxy collision set a theoretical framework that
may apply to other astrophysical situations The H2-luminous radio-galaxy 3C326 is one exam-
ple where H2 observations allow for the rst time to peer at the impact of the AGN-driven jet
onto the molecular gas of the host galaxy Does the AGN feedback regulate or even suppress star
formation negative feedback or does it trigger star formation positive This is a key question
in galaxy evolution

91 Introduction
Understanding how galaxies formed and evolved is one of the major goals of modern extragalactic
astronomy This dissertation is a rst step to address the role of molecular gas within this context
The emerging population of H2-luminous galaxies with enhanced mid-IR H2 line emission and rela-
tively weak star formation includes galaxies in several key phases of their evolution dominated by
9 H2 in galaxy evolution
gas accretion galaxy interactions or galactic winds driven by star formation and AGN The analysis
presented in this manuscript suggests that the warm H2 contributes signicantly to the overall energy
budget of these galaxies and may potentially play a central role for galaxy evolution
This chapter introduces the role of the molecular gas for the energetics of star formation and
galaxy mass build-up sect 92 I point out some major astrophysical questions in this context with
an emphasis on AGN feedback sect 922 Then I present the case of 3C326 a spectacular example
of an H2-luminous radio-galaxy for which I have applied the same analytical and numerical approach
as for Stephans Quintet to model the H2 emission and derive gas masses in the system These results
together with a detailed analysis of the energetics of the system are gathered in Nesvadba et al 2009
hereafter paper IV submitted to AA The observational context of 3C326 is given in sect 931
and the paper is reproduced in sect 933 This chapter ends with a presentation of some observational
sect 131 and theoretical perspectives sect 132
92 H2 and feedback in galaxy evolution
Thanks to ever-improving cosmological simulations we now have a sound comprehension of structure
formation on the largest scales Spectacular progress is made in describing the structure of dark matter
and the history of star formation through cosmic time However describing galaxy evolution within
this picture is still a challenge
The reason is that the build-up of baryonic mass in galaxies is regulated by a complex interplay
between gravitational collapse and feedback related to AGN and star formation The dynamical in-
teractions between the ISM phases and their thermal properties play a key role in this regulation
Fig 91 illustrates schematically the mass and energy exchange between the ISM of a galaxy and its
halos environment In the context of galaxy baryonic mass build-up two processes compete On
one hand the activity of the black hole and the bursts of star formation create galactic winds or
superwinds on galactic scales eg Heckman et al 1990 that push the hotwarm gas and possibly
also molecular gas into the galactic corona or even further out to the intergalactic space outow
The relative importance between the impact of black holes or stars depends on the mass of the galaxy
more massive ones being dominated by the AGN activity eg Dekel and Silk 1986 On the other
hand part of this matter does not escape the gravitational potential well of the galaxy and falls back
onto the galactic disk In addition matter from the intergalactic medium or from a companion galaxy
is accreted onto the disk These processes are particularly important during the early phases of galaxy
evolution at high redshift when most of the stars in the universe were formed
In this picture of galaxy formation and evolution a lot of astrophysical questions remains We still
do not know how gas that falls within dark matter haloes is accreting onto the galactic disk and how
it comes to form stars On the other hand it is not clear what is the impact and efciency of feedback
processes from stars or black holes on the molecular gas and thus on star formation These questions
are related to the regulation of mass build-up in galaxies described above I will only focus on the
second aspect which is closely related to the theoretical framework developed in my PhD work What
is the impact of feedback on galaxy evolution
Since H2 formation is a natural outcome of gas cooling and since molecular gas represents the
reservoir for star formation H2 gas must play an important role in all the processes listed above
92 H2 and feedback in galaxy evolution
Figure 91 Sketch of the complex circulation of the multiphase interstellar matter during galaxy mass
build-up The gas disk of the galaxy is fed by infall from intergalactic space and by gas raining down
from the halo This gas ows inwards and fuel star formation as well as the activity of the central
black hole The blue and red arrows schematically outline these inows and outows and the gas
cooling and heating Observations show that H2 is a key actor in all stages Adapted from Boulanger
et al 2009
Therefore understanding the role that cold interstellar matter plays in the evolution of galaxies is a
key to elucidate the above questions However very little is known about its impact on the energetics
of feedback and its response to it In a sense the Spitzer Space Telescope has opened a new obser-
vational window into the molecular Universe through mid-infrared observations of warm H2 In
the following I will emphasize what can we learn from H2 observations that may help in answering
these questions I distinguish two types of feedback depending on the powering sources either star
formation or black hole
921 Feedback from star formation H2 in superwinds
Star formation is known from optical to X-ray observations of warm and hot gas to drive galactic
winds Heckman et al 1990 2000 Superwinds are generated when the kinetic energy from stellar
winds and supernovae is thermalized generating a region of very hot T  107108 K high-pressure
plasma in the ISM of a starburst galaxy Chevalier and Clegg 1985 As the bubble breaks out of the

disk of the galaxy the plasma expands producing a weakly-collimated bipolar outow into the galaxy
halo The outowing plasma sweeps up and shocks ambient material creating a superwind
To understand the impact of these winds on star formation and thereby on galaxy evolution in
general it is crucial to constrain their impact on the multiphase interstellar medium of galaxies Spitzer
mid-IR imaging and spectroscopy have revealed that winds are loaded with molecular gas and dust
see the illustration for the wind of M82 in Fig 13 However the origin of this molecular gas is
still unclear Is it material lifted up from the galactic disk or is the molecular gas formed in situ by
compression of dusty atomic gas that is advected in the ow We do not favor the rst interpretation
because the hot wind is too tenuous to lift up dense molecular clouds from the disk If one considers
a molecular cloud of radius 10 pc and density 104 cm3 entrained in a 500 km s1 superwind at
density 102 cm3 the acceleration timescale of the cloud would be Eq 430  3  1010 yr which
is much larger than the dynamical timescale of the outow  107 yr Following our scenario of H2
formation in the Stephans Quintet shock chapter 5 we favor the second interpretation in which the
H2 gas is formed outside galactic disks as the result of the dynamical interaction of the wind with gas
in the halo
The molecular component has previously been ignored in galactic winds studies Is the molecular
gas a dominant mass component of galactic winds Does it share the outward ow motion of the
lighter and warmer gas Does it fall back on the disk Is the emission from molecular gas the
main dissipative channel that sets the energetic efciency of galactic winds The answers to these
questions about molecular gas are essential to determine the impact of feedback from star formation
on the evolution of galaxies
922 H2 and AGN feedback
An even more powerful source for feedback is the central engine of AGN the supermassive black
hole in the center of the host galaxy A small fraction of the energy released by the growth of the
black hole if absorbed by interstellar matter in the host galaxy could regulate or even quench star
formation by heating and ejecting ambient gas from the disk of the host galaxy under the action of an
AGN-driven outow This is the so-called negative AGN feedback On the other hand the impact of
the AGN could in principle be also positive by triggering star formation through the interaction of the
AGN-driven jet with the ISM of the host galaxy
Monsters needed to break the hierarchy
This negative AGN feedback has been often invoked to explain the decline of star formation in mas-
sive early-type galaxies eg Silk and Rees 1998 Springel et al 2005 Croton et al 2006 Hopkins
et al 2006 The large majority of these galaxies appears to have formed most of their stars at high
redshift1 so that they are now old red and dead These observations are in apparent contradiction
with a gradual bottom-up mass assembly Under the assumption of hierarchical galaxy evolution
one would navely think that the gas cools and is accreted gradually onto massive halos So we should
1This is indicated by the redshift evolution of luminosity and mass functions of galaxies and by the characterization of
stellar populations chemical abundances and structural properties of giant ellipticals in the local universe Even a small
fraction of the gas returned by dying-stars gas should result in star formation rates much larger than observational estimates
92 H2 and feedback in galaxy evolution
nd many more massive blue star-forming galaxies particularly at the centers of groups and clus-
ters This is called the hierarchical problem AGN monsters are then called to break the hierarchical
scenario
It is worth mentioning that an other alternative mechanism called morphological quenching has
been recently proposed by Martig et al 2009 to account for red early-type galaxies Based on
cosmological simulations they propose that star formation is quenched when the galaxy experiences
a morphological transition from a rotating stellar disk to a pressure-dominated stellar spheroid which
induces a steeper potential well and reduces the disk selfgravity In their simulations this transition
results from the growth of a stellar spheroid for instance by galaxy merging The gas in the disk
of the galaxy becomes stable against fragmentation thus reducing star formation efciency Though
interesting this process may not be directly related to H2-luminous objects since it appears that a
powerful source of mechanical energy is needed to explain the H2 emission
H2-luminous galaxies as a tool to study AGN feedback
Despite its potential importance dixit Matthew D Lehnert AGN feedback has remained in the realm
of theoretical deus ex machina We still do not understand how the transfer of energy from the AGN
to the surrounding gas occurs In particular a major question is to determine the impact of the AGN-
driven jet to the molecular gas settled in the disk of the host galaxy Is the ISM of the host galaxy
blown up in the outow thus supressing star formation negative feedback Or does the jet trigger
shock-compression of clouds thus enhancing star formation positive feedback Or is it both
Evidences for AGN feedback are now growing Observations suggest that AGN feedback may be
associated mostly with radio-loud AGN Perhaps the most striking examples are nearby clusters of
galaxies in which the central black holes inject a huge amount of energy typically  1060 erg for
the most massive ones over a rather short timescale  107 yr which seems enough to prevent the
cooling of the gas through X-ray emission This may be an explanation to solve for the cooling ow
problem in which the amount of hot gas that cools radiatively inferred from soft X-ray observations
is much less than expected from the harder X-ray luminosity see McNamara and Nulsen 2007 and
references therein for a review A number of observations show that cool-core clusters contain large
amounts of molecular gas at their center H2 was rst detected through its near-IR ro-vibrational
lines Warm H2 has since also been observed through its mid-IR rotational lines with Spitzer see
chapter 1 sect 122 Fig 15 and eg Egami et al 2006 Numerous CO detections have also been
reported but the spatial distribution and kinematics of the cold molecular gas has only been imaged in
a few clusters For instance CO observations reveal a large amount  1011 Mcid12 of cold molecular gas
extending in the halo to several tens of kpc from the central elliptical galaxy NGC 1275 Salom et al
2006 in the Perseus A galaxy cluster This molecular gas is observed to be surprisingly inefcient at
forming stars
Radio galaxies are interesting targets to elucidate the physical mechanisms whereby the AGN can
regulate the star formation in its host galaxy Indeed radio-galaxies have an AGN and an obvious
source of mechanical energy which reaches large scales They also show signs of outows Nesvadba
et al 2006 2008b 2009 Holt et al 2008 strong turbulence and dissipation of mechanical energy
Ogle et al 2007 2009 For the rst time observations of warm molecular gas in radio-galaxies
allow to peer at the impact of the radio jet on the energetics of the dense molecular gas and thus on
9 H2 in galaxy evolution
star formation Ogle et al 2009 nd that about 30 of nearby powerful radio galaxies may fall into
the class of H2-luminous galaxies presented in chapter 1 which have signicant amounts of relatively
dense warm and surprisingly turbulent molecular gas but very little star formation
In the following I shall focus on the example of the 3C326 radio-galaxy which has been studied
in detail by applying the methods developed during my PhD work
93 Are we witnessing negative AGN feedback in the radio galaxy 3C326
The radio galaxy 3C326 is an outstanding source to study the impact of the radio jets on its molecular
gas and paper IV presents such a study We report new CO observations of that source that comple-
ment the mass and energy budget of the molecular gas in 3C326 We interpret line emission from the
ionized and molecular gas within the framework I have developed for the Stephans Quintet
The paper IV is reproduced at the end of this chapter I only give here a brief summary of the main
points as well as additional gures and results from my modeling of H2 excitation in that source We
nd that the ISM of this galaxy has very unusual properties the molecular gas budget is dominated
by warm gas at temperatures T  100 K while diagnostic line ratios suggest that the ionized and
molecular gas is mostly excited through shocks
We also identify a signicant outow of neutral gas which cannot be explained by star formation
We explain these observations through a common physical framework where a fraction of the me-
chanical energy of the radio jet is being dissipated on small scales within the molecular gas which
powers the observed H2 emission This is an extension of the classical cocoon model in which the
AGN-driven jet inates a cocoon of hot gas that accelerates the warm medium We now explicitly
take into account the multiphase character of the ISM and nd that only a small fraction  10
of the jet mechanical energy is need to power the H2 emission The timescale of dissipation of the
jet mechanical energy 107  108 yr suggests that the jet could heat the molecular on timescales
comparable or even longer than the jet lifetime thus limiting star formation over a long-lasting pe-
riod of time Studies of repeated jet activity in radio galaxies suggest that the phse of quiessence
between two activity cycles could be of similar duration Thus the physical gas conditions in AGN
host galaxies may play an important role in regulating this cyclical jet activity
To introduce the paper IV that presents a detailed analysis of the energetics of the molecular gas
in 3C326 I briey present the observational status of 3C326
931 Observational context
Two companions  
3C326 is one of the largest radio sources known Willis and Strom 1978 with an angular size of
195 19 Mpc
It is a system of two companions 3C326 N N being for North and 3C326 S
South at a redshift of z  0089  0001 Fig 92 shows a radio left and a mid-IR right image
of the pair It is not clear which of the two galaxies hosts the AGN that produced the Mpc-scale radio
lobes see Rawlings et al 1990
The galaxy 3C326 N has been classied as a LINER from optical spectroscopy Rawlings et al
It has strong O II H S II and weak O III lines whereas 3C 326 S has no detected
93 Are we witnessing negative AGN feedback in the radio galaxy 3C326
Figure 92 Radio VLA 14 GHz Klein et al 1994b Mack et al 1997 and Spitzer images Ogle
et al 2007 of the 3C326 radio-galaxy The system comprises of two galaxies 3C326 North and
South The projected separation between the two is 249 41 kpc It is not clear which one creates
the jet materialized by the Mpc-scale radio lobes seen on the VLA image
emission lines Rawlings et al 1990 Simpson et al 1996 Rawlings et al 1990 suggest that
3C 326N is more typical of FR II radio galaxy hosts than its South companion
   but one H2-luminous source
Based on this observational context Ogle et al 2007 targeted the northern companion 3C326 N
with the Spitzer IRS and found extraordinary powerful H2 rotational line emission The total emission-
line luminosity of 3C326 N is LH2  80  04  1034 W integrated over the lines S1 to S7
The ratio of the H2 luminosity of the 8  70 m integrated infrared luminosity is 017  002 which
is 1  2 orders of magnitude higher than normal star-forming galaxies see discussion in chapter 1
The optical and mid-IR spectra of 3C326 N see Fig 12 Fig 14 and Ogle et al 2007 2009
suggest a very weak star forming rate  007 Mcid12 yr1 although the galaxy holds a large mass of
H2 gas  109 Mcid12
932 H2 excitation in 3C326
Like in Stephans Quintet the H2 emission in 3C326 is associated with the dissipation of mechanical
energy I have used the grid of MHD shocks presented in chapter 4 to quantify the range of preshock

density and shock velocities that ts the oberved H2 line uxes
The results of the modeling of the H2 excitation are gathered in Tables 6 and 7 of paper IV To
complement these tables Fig 93 shows the observed and modeled H2 excitation diagram for 3C326
As discussed in chapter 6 these ts are not unique I show here the results for two preshock densities
nH  103 and 104 cm3 The lowest preshock density 103 cm3 is need to t the 0-0S0 line
where higher excitation lines S6 and S7 require higher densities or higher velocity shocks Please
see paper IV for a discussion of the results in particular the mass and energy budgets of the molecular
gas in this galaxy

101 Introduction
The James Webb Telescope hereafter JWST giant successor to the Hubble and Spitzer space
telescopes is in preparation since 20 years We are now in the phase where the ight model
instruments have been built and are being tested The french community led by the CEA Saclay IAS
10 The JWST observatory and its Mid-Infrared Instrument MIRI
Orsay Meudon and Marseille institutes took the responsibility of the mid-infrared 5  29 m cam-
era a sub-component of the Mid-InfraRed Instrument MIRI which is one of the four instruments
onboard the JWST
Six months after the beginning of my PhD Alain Abergel who had worked in collaboration with
CEA to the denition of the optical performance tests of the instrument offered me to be part of the
MIRI test team in order to participate in the optical test of the MIRI camera taking place at the CEA
Saclay Needless to say that I accepted without hesitating I was interested in opening my skills to
instrumentation but also in gaining knowledge of the MIRI instrument that will be a milestone of
future mid-IR astronomy and an ideal tool to study the H2-luminous objects we have been speaking
about in the previous chapters In a sense this project integrates very well in the science topic of this
thesis manuscript
I soon realized that I was a a tiny grain of sand in an enormous project In order to have my own
and little contribution to the project I decided to focus on the tests of the Point Spread Function of
the instrument one of the tests designed to check the optical quality of the instrument I participated
in the tests and took the lead of the data analysis of the PSF measurements This work is described in
the next chapter chap 11
In this chapter we provide the necessary background to the next two chapters that present my
contributions to the MIRI testing and to the preparation of scientic projects related to the physics of
the H2 emission in active phases of galaxy evolution chap 12 I rst give a brief overview of the
JWST mission with emphasis on its science instruments Then I describe in more detail the MIRI
instrument I have been working on sect 103 Imaging and spectroscopic observation modes and
sensitivities are discussed This chapter can also be viewed as an up-to-date working document useful
to prepare observations
102 JWST mission overview
Impressive numbers
The James Webb Space Telescope JWST is a large IR 06  28 m telescope with a 65 m primary
mirror see Gardner et al 2006 for a review of the JWST implementation The Fig 101 shows the
main components of the JWST observatory The launch is planned in 2014 on an Ariane 5 rocket
The JWST will be put in a Lissajous orbit around the Earth-Sun L2 point Here are a few more gures
just to say that its an enormous project The total mass of the observatory is  6 200 kg JWST is
an international collaboration between NASA the European Space Agency ESA and the Canadian
Space Agency CSA The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is managing the development effort
and the prime contractor is Northrop Grumman The Space Telescope Science Institute STScI will
operate JWST after launch The life-cycle cost of the project is estimated at about US45 billion for
a lifetime of 5 years minimum
The JWST project started in 1989 already 20 years ago when STScI decided to think about a
follow-up to the Hubble Space Telescope HST Prior to September 10 2002 the JWST was known
as the Next Generation Space Telescope NGST JWST was renamed to honor the NASAs sec-
ond administrator James Webb 1906-1992 who supervised the Gemini program pathnder to the
preparation of the Apollo moon program
102 JWST mission overview
Figure 101 The JWST observatory and its optical telescope
The JWST observatory is comprised of the following elements the spacecraft the optical tele-
scope element OTE and the integrated science instrument module ISIM
1022 The spacecraft
The JWST spacecraft is comprised of two elements the spacecraft bus and the sunshield see the top
right panel of Fig 101
1 The sunshield subsystem separates the observatory into a warm sun-facing side spacecraft bus
10 The JWST observatory and its Mid-Infrared Instrument MIRI
and a cold anti-sun side OTE and ISIM It enables passive cooling of telescope and instruments
the operating temperature has to be kept under 50 K The sunshield consists of ve layers of
thin membranes made from a polymer-based lm Kapton with aluminum and doped-silicon
coatings and supporting equipment such as spreader bars booms cabling and containment
shells When fully deployed the sunshield that will be about the size of a tennis court
2 The spacecraft bus provides the support functions for the operation of the JWST Observatory
The bus houses the six major subsystems needed to operate the spacecraft the Electrical Power
Subsystem the Attitude Control Subsystem the Communication Subsystem the Command and
Data Handling Subsystem the Propulsion Subsystem and the Thermal Control Subsystem
The JWST architecture its expected performance and the plans for integration and testing are
described in more detail in Nella et al 2004 Even though many details in the design have changed
since the article was written many of the design choices and procedures are still valid
1023 The eye of the JWST
The Fig 102 shows some views at the JWST mirror The JWST telescope has a three-mirror anas-
tigmatic design with a 25 m2 collecting area equivalent to a  6 m circular primary which is  7
times the collecting area of the HST The effective focal ratio is f 1667 and the effective focal length
is 1314 m The primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal segments  13 m at-to-at side in two
rings around the center resulting in a 65 m at-to-at diameter Each segment is made of Beryllium
and has the correct off-axis surface at the nominal cryogenic 40 K temperature of the primary The
mirrors are gold coated providing a broad spectral bandpass from 06 to 29 m
The wavefront sensing and control subsystem is used to align the segments so that their wavefronts
match properly creating a diffraction-limited image Each segment will have six actuators to change
its focal length The secondary mirror has 6-degrees of adjustment for collimation and overall focus
Once aligned about 2  3 months after launch the telescope is designed to be diffraction limited
at 2 m Strehl ratio of 080 and have an encircled energy of 75 within a 015 arcsecond radius at
1 m dominated by sub-segment errors It is estimated that the backplane will be sufciently stable
during slews that the wavefront control adjustments will be needed less than once every two weeks
1024 Deployment and commissioning
A 6 m telescope does not t into any launch rocket The JWST is thus a deployable satellite Fig 103
During transfer to L2 the different elements of JWST will be deployed and commissioning will start
The observatory has ve deployment stages1 involving the following elements 1 spacecraft ap-
pendages solar arrays high gain antenna 2 sunshield 3 extend tower 4 secondary mirror and 5
primary mirror All critical deployment points have heaters and can be unlatched and re-latched to
relieve any residual long term stress in the structure even in the cold of outer space
Deployment of the observatory will start fairly soon after launch with the sunshade unfolding
after 2 days and the secondary and primary mirror deploying after approximately 4 days First light
will occur at about 28 days after launch initiating wavefront sensing and control activities to align the

Figure 107 Schematic view of the MIRIs focal plane The biggest 1919 arcmin2 square is the im-
ager eld of view One quarter of the eld of view is devoted to coronagraphy with three 4-Quadrant
Phase Mask and one Lyot Mask coronographs a 5 arcsec wide strip is used for low-resolution spec-
troscopy LRS and the remaining 1419 arcmin2 is available for broad-band imaging The smallest

Coronagraphic mode one Lyot mask 23 m and three 4-Quadrant Phase-Masks 4QPM at 1065
114 155 m are xed in a sub-area of the focal plane The 4 corresponding pupil diaphragms
are located in the lter wheel The Lyot mask is a classical coronograph with an occulting
disk that blocks the direct starlight The 4QPM coronagraph is based the peculiar design of
binary phase mask 0  dividing the full eld of view at the focal plane in four quadrants
The mutual destructive interferences of the coherent light of a source perfectly centered on the
mask produce a total nulling within the pupil image see eg Rouan et al 2000 for details
The coronographic mode of MIRI will not be further discussed here
Low-Resolution Spectrometer The slit is xed in the focal plane and the dispersive element a

Alignment check mode a tool to check the alignment of MIRIM with respect to the telescope It
includes a fused silica lens in the lter wheel to defocus the image of an on-axis point source
on the detector
Fig 108 shows the whole Mid-Infrared Instrument MIRI and its structural design The MIRI
structure design uses a six-strut hexapod mount that provide the degrees of freedom for kinematic
mounting to the ISIM With the exception of the struts and some lters and prisms the instrument is
made entirely from 6061 aluminium alloy The nominal operating temperature for the MIRI is 7K
This level of cooling cannot be attained using the passive cooling Instead a cryocooler is used First a

1032 MIRIM broad-band imaging and coronography
Optical layout We briey describe the optical layout of the camera shown in Fig 1010 The
footprints of the beams for 3 different off-axis elds are overlaid on the mechanical layout The
JWST input beam enters MIRIMs focal plane via the Input Optics and Calibration unit IOC see
Fig 108 The cold MIRIM FOV is 7276 mm  7276mm at focal plane where the coronograph
masks are xed M1 is a collimating mirror focal length  352 mm and M2 is a at folding mirror
that directs the beam to the cold stop and the lter wheel The cold stop is a diaphragm required at the
OTE pupil image location to reduce the amount of stray light Because the shape of the diaphragms
used for imaging or coronography are different the use of a single cold stop for all the modes is not
possible Thus a pseudo cold stop is located 10 mm along the optical axis before the OTE pupil
image The diaphragms mean diameter value around 19 mm adapted for each mode and attached
to the lter wheel are located exactly at the OTE pupil image position The M3 M4 and M5 mirrors
form a Three-Mirror Anastigmatic TMA objective that reects the light on the detector array
Imager and coronographic lters The useful area for the imaging mode is 4779  7176 mm2
corresponding to 125  188  235 arcmin2 on the sky see Fig 1010 bottom The imager will
have a pixel scale of 011 arcsecpixel As the coronagraphic masks are transparent the area used for
the coronagraphic mode could be marginally used in the imaging mode The only moving part of the
imager is an 18-position lter wheel Filter positions are allocated as follows 12 lters for imaging
4 lter and diaphragm combinations for coronagraphy 1 ZnS-Ge double prism for the low-resolution
spectroscopic mode and 1 dark position The list and properties of the MIRIM lters are given in

Calibration A calibration facility is dispatched over the IOC and MIRIM The calibration is achieved
through a dedicated optical path by imaging a point source at the internal edge of the OTE pupil im-
age The light is reected through the TMA to illuminate uniformly the detector

The low resolution spectroscopic mode is achieved by a couple of Ge and ZnS prisms attached to
the lter wheel The rst Ge prism cancels the deviation due to the ZnS dispersive prism The slit
is located at the edge of the coronagraphic mask mounting see Fig 1010 bottom The spectrum
5 10 m is spread over  35 mm over the detector array so  140 pixels The nominal resolving
power at 75 m is R  985  60

1034 The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer MRS
The Medium Resolution Spectrometer MRS is an Integral Field Unit IFU that allows spectroscopy
to be carried out on a 2-dimensional area of sky in a single observation Fig 1012 illustrates its
working principle and Fig 1013 shows the optical and mechanical layout of the MRS The rectangular
eld of view is divided into narrow slices by mean of a image-slicer mirror The image slices are
arranged along the entrance slit mask bottom panel of Fig 1013 of a rst-order diffraction grating
which carries out the dispersion and imaged onto two 1024  1024 pixels SiAs chips
The band 5  29 m is divided into 4 IFU channels Fig 1013 which are observed simultane-
ously Each channel is equipped with an IFU image slicer designed to match the width of each slice to
the diffraction-limited point-spread function of the telescope at the wavelength of each channel The
spectral band of each IFU channel is subdivided into 3 sub-bands A B and C by means of dichroic
lters Thus an observation over the entire spectral band is carried out in a set of three exposures
The table 102 gathers the main functional parameters of the MRS The spectral resolution is
R  3000 over the 5  29 m wavelength range The eld of view ranges from 37  37 arcsec to
77  77 arcsec2 with increasing wavelength with pixel sizes from 02 to 065 arcsec Within this
overall eld of view the region of sky corresponding to a spatial sample is set by the slice width in

black bands between channels are those spectral regions where the wavelength coverage of adjacent
exposures overlap
the perpendicular to the slice direction across and by the pixel eld of view in the slice direction
along The slice widths have been chosen to have odd integer multiples of their half widths matched
The result is that a single telescope offset of 097 arcseconds in the across slice direction and a mul-
tiple of 010 arcseconds in the along-slice direction will provide full spatial sampling in all channels
simultaneously

bResponse Quantum Efciency
cThe efciency of the detector is smaller than the intrisic quantum efciency of the material because of the reection of
light on the Si layer An anti-reection coating is used to limit this loss

A group is a number of frames that are read and coadded together MIRI does not generally use
this feature so that there is only one frame per group An integration is the length of time the
detector is allowed to collect light before resetting to zero and is dened to be an integer number of
frame times in length Single integrations may range from 3 seconds 2755 to be precise up to 4 000
seconds An exposure is the length of time MIRI is allowed to collect light before some intervention
is needed eg dithering the telescope changing lters etc An exposure is the level at which MIRI
is commanded a command is sent with the number of frames groups and integrations that sets up
MIRI and a GO command is received to begin the actual exposure
Two readout modes are implemented the Fast and Slow modes They apply to different kinds
of astrophysical observations
Fast Mode For MIRI observations of bright objects and long wavelength imaging short source- or
background-limited exposures will be used Observations of the following types will utilize the
Fast Mode
10 The JWST observatory and its Mid-Infrared Instrument MIRI
 Broadband imaging at longer wavelengths   12 m
 Bright object imaging at all wavelengths
 Bright objects with MRS spectroscopy
Some examples of bright objects include nearby star forming regions the Galactic center and
more generally targets that lie in the Galactic plane The Fast Mode is simply reading out the
array at the fastest possible speed Each pixel is addressed during the 10 s window sampled
once after an appropriate amount of settling time and the digitised data is sent out to the ISIM
Frame times in fast mode are  3 seconds
Slow Mode For many MIRI observations involving faint objects deep imaging and MRS spec-
troscopy long background-limited exposures will be required to achieve the needed sensitivity
Observations using SLOWMode will include the following
 Broadband imaging at short wavelengths   12 m
 R  100 LRS spectroscopy
 MRS spectroscopy
The Slow Mode increases the overall integration time with the SCAs in the following way The
FPE dwells on a pixel for 10 sample periods or 100 s resulting in a frame time that is  30
seconds long The last eight samples are coadded and bit-shifted to a 16-bit value within the
FPE before being sent along to the ISIM the rst two samples are discarded This mode allows
the potential of reducing the power dissipation of the detectors quite a bit if it is found to be
necessary for stability concerns
MIRIs arrays have the ability to read out partial frames or subarrays through the manipulation of
the clocking patterns This facilitates target acquisition imaging and selective use of the four corona-
graph masks and allows a reduction in the frame time and integration times of  3 seconds Subarray
modes are only useful for the MIRI Imager The subarrays are shown in the bottom left panel of
Fig 1014 Four 256 256 subarrays are dened The four subarrays that match the coronagraphic lo-
cations are dened by the MIRI Imager optics and are approximately 256256 in size The 512512
quadrant subarrays position is determined by the user Subarrays can be dened in any part of the
imaging area with a minimum size of 64  64 pixels In order to ensure consistent calibration of
subarray modes only a few subarrays will be allowed and the user will select from these predened
1036 Observation modes operating MIRI
The basic principles underlying the operation of the MIRI focal plane system FPS are as follows
 the FPS enables four principal types of scientic observation imaging coronagraphic imaging
low-resolution slit spectroscopy and medium resolution integral eld spectroscopy
 all MIRI data are sent to the ISIM Focal Plane Array Processor cards for further processing
There is no processing within the FPS and on-orbit processing of the data is limited to frame
coaddition in some high data rate circumstances
103 The Mid-Infrared Instrument MIRI
Figure 1015 Left Comparison of the spectral sensitivities between MIRIMRS and other facilities
Right Relative time gain of JWST compared to a 30 m Giant Segmented Mirror Telescope GSMT
and Spitzer The vertical axis is in relative units where 10 means an observation with both JWST and
GSMT and Spitzer will take the same time to reach the same SN on a point source a larger number
means JWST is faster Both Y -axis are the same
 For bright object imaging and for imaging at the longest wavelengths ie largest background
emission from telescope the array is read out at the fastest rate possible and subarrays may be
 the MIRI imager and spectrograph may be run in parallel for calibration purposes or target
acquisitions
 Data are taken in a redundant fashion Sources will be dithered on the focal plane with the Fine
Steering Mirror so that each point on the sky is sampled by many different areas of the sen-
sor chip assembly SCA For the medium resolution Spectrometer MRS this accomplishes
spectral as well as spatial dithering
 Calibration of MIRI will be done periodically to monitor its stability and performance as well
as diagnostic tests and maintenance
1037 MIRIs sensitivity
All the sensitivities of the broad-band imager the low-resolution spectrometer and the medium-
resolution IFU spectrometer are gathered in tables 104 105 and 106 respectively These gures
are particularly helpful to prepare observation proposals see chapter 12 The results are from mod-
eling Swinyard et al 2004 that takes into account the different factors affecting the sensitivity the

efciency of the instrument etc The imaging channel of the instrument is limited by the zodiacal
background at wavelengths below  12 m and by the emission from the telescope and sunshields at
longer wavelengths In the case of the MRS spectrometer the instrument is almost entirely detector
noise limited except in the longest wavelength channel where the background is highest
In the left panel of Fig 1015 we compare the sensitivity of the MIRI Medium Resolution Spec-
trometer to other facilities In particular up to  20 m the MRS will be about two orders of mag-
nitude more sensitive than was the IRS spectrometer on-board Spitzer with a spectral resolution  5
times higher The right panel of Fig 1015 summarizes the relative time gain between JWST instru-
ments and Spitzer or an hypothetical 30 m ground-based telescope Such a gain in sensitivity will
certainly lead to unexpexted discoveries

111 Introduction
Ground tests are essential to ensure the functionality and the optical performance of the instrument
They often lead to design changes from the rst models built to the nal ight model FM The
characterization of the instrument stray light point spread function at eld etc has to be as
accurate as possible during ground test campaigns since these tests are extremely limited in space
In this chapter I present my contribution to the extensive test campaign of the MIRI imager
MIRIM see chap 10 for a description of the instrument The rst MIRIM optical performance
tests in the infrared at cryogenic temperatures were performed at CEA Saclay during the December
2008  April 2009 test campaign I had the chance to participate in these tests and I took the respon-
sability of the analysis of one of these tests so-called microscanning which allows to characterize
the Point Spread Function1 hereafter PSF of the instrument very accurately This was a great expe-
rience and I had the opportunity to interact with engineers and to attend meetings of the European
Consortium in which I had several opportunities to present my work
It would be impossible to review all the tests and results that were performed on MIRIM I will
rather focus on the PSF analysis After introducing some generalities about the PSF of the JWST and
the context of MIRI testing I describe in sect 112 the instrumental setup used to simulate the JWST
beam and to perform the cold tests Section 113 presents a very brief overview of the tests performed
on MIRIM at CEA Saclay In sect 114 we discuss the response curve of the detector and how we
correct the images for the non-linearity of the detector Then Sect 115 describes the microscanning
test and the method used to reconstruct the high-resolution PSF of MIRIM Sect 116 discusses the
PSF characteristics determined by the microscan analysis Sect 117 summarizes our results and in
sect 118 I briey give the next steps of MIRIJWST testing
Introduction to the PSF of the JWST
From a basic point of of view the PSF of an imaging system is determined by two things the pupil
shape and the WaveFront Errors henceforth WFE Often the shape of the pupil is well known and
relatively simple For instance in the case of a circular or annular aperture the PSF is an Airy disk
the square of a Bessel function However for more sophisticated and larger systems like the JWST
or the Keck telescope pupils are intrinsically a lot more complex In Fig 111 we illustrate how the
pupil shape affects the PSF building from an open circular pupil of diameter 65 m left a hexagonal
pupil of diameter 65 m center and a realistic representation of the JWST pupil right These PSF
have been computed with the JWPSF software described in Cox and Spaans 2006
Why is it important to characterize the PSF with precision
The PSF translates the optical quality of the system A careful measurement of the PSF characteristics
is rst needed to check the optical performance of the instrument in order to verify that the instrument
is nominally built This is the main goal of the tests described in this chapter A precise knowledge of
1The Point Spread Function is the image of a point source through the instrument The PSF characterizes the imaging
systems spatial response ie its spatial resolution In technical words this is the impulse-response of the optical system
111 Introduction
Figure 111 The PSF corresponding to each aperture is displayed on a logarithmic grayscale from
107 to 103 counts The total number of counts in each of these simulated PSFs is 1 These PSF
have been modeled with the JWPSF softwarea
ahttpwwwstsciedujwstsoftwarejwpsf
the PSF is also crucial for the photometric calibration of the instrument and for scientic applications
photometry source extraction etc
Before determining if the PSF of the instrument is nominal or not an important step is to study
the impact of aberrations on the PSF Errors in the wavefront can arise from a variety of sources
including imperfections in the systems optics or atmospheric variations in the case for ground-based
observations These WFE can be extremely difcult to determine The Fig 112 illustrates the impact
of variations of the WFE on the PSF at 2 m with the NirCam instrument see sect 1025 for a
description of the instrument Two realizations of the WFE and corresponding JWST PSFs are shown
These PSFs differ in the specic distribution of the wavefront error across the pupil As long as the
error budget is satised comparing these PSFs provides an estimate of the PSF differences that could
be encountered in the normal course of observations
A long path to the FM and a European adventure
To design and build an instrument like MIRI is a hard and long route The development and qualica-
tion of the optical bench of the MIRI imager MIRIM started in 2004 and the rst tests of the MIRIM
ight model henceforth FM started in December 2008 Some hardware parts of the MIRI FM are
still being and will be manufactured and tested in 2009-2010 MIRI is expected to be delivered to

associated PSFs bottom for a wavelength of 2 m OPDs are displayed on a linear grayscale from
400 to 400 nm while PSFs are displayed on a logarithmic grayscale from 106 to 103 The OPDs
include wavefront error WFE contributions from the JWST Optical Telescope Element OTE the
Integrated Science Instrument Module ISIM and the Near-Infrared Camera NIRCam The RMS
WFE of both OPDs is  110 nm While the differences in total RMS WFE are small the impact of
these differences on the resultant PSFs is measurable These PSF have been modeled with the JWPSF
software
NASA at the end of 2010 Then MIRI will be integrated into the Instrument Science Module at the
back of the JWST primary mirror see chapter 10 and basic testing alignment focus etc will be
performed in the giant cryogenic chamber at Johnson Space Center Houston USA see 118

Before the FM several models of MIRI were built A rst mechanical model the Structure and
Thermal Model STM was to test thermal balance integration and vibration at MIRI level The rst
optical model was the Verication model VM and it was used to test the integration procedures
and the optical performance Then the Engineering and Test Model ETM was an optically fully
representative model used to verify the optical performance and thermal behaviour of the instrument
at cryogenic temperatures at CEA The different steps leading to the FM integration of the Mid-
Infra Red IMager Optical Bench MIRIM-OB and the principal results associated with the two test
models the STM and the ETM were presented in Amiaux et al 2008 In this chapter I will focus
on the FM
The different parts of the MIRIM-OB system are built within the different institutes of the Eu-
ropean Consortium then gathered together and integrated at CEA-Saclay The lters are under the
responsibility of University of Sweden The Double Prism Assembly for the Low-Resolution Spec-
trometer LRS see  1033 is a Belgium CSL and a Germany University of Kln collaboration
The coronographic masks are manufactured at Observatoire de Meudon LESIA in France Optical
elements are then integrated onto the Filter Wheel Disk under CEA responsibility see  1032 for
a description of the lter wheel and its lters The Filter Wheel Disk is delivered to MPIA in Ger-
many for integration on the Filter Wheel cryo-mechanism Filter Wheel Assembly is then returned to
CEA-Saclay for further integration into MIRIM Optical Bench

ulator TS The warm TS is installed outside the cryostat in blue on the right panel that contains
MIRIM The TS simulates the JWST beam and pupil It allows the use of a point or extended source
in order to characterize MIRIM in image or coronographic mode
112 Instrumental setup the MIRIM test bench at CEA
The tests of the MIRIM optical quality have been performed with an ambient temperature Tele-
scope Simulator hereafter TS installed outside an helium-cooled cryostat that contains MIRIM-OB
Fig 113 The TS simulates the optical beam delivered by the JWST The optical conception of the
TS is based on two off-axis parabolic mirrors PM1 and PM2 and a pupil mask in between Fig 114
The pupil mask is the pupil of the telescope simulator so-called the STOP and it reproduces the
pupil of JWST It is mounted on motorised translation and rotation stages 4 axis 3 translations and
one rotation This allows ne adjustment to co-align the telescope simulator and MIRIM pupils
These degrees of freedom are also used to simulate pupil shear which occurs when the pupil stop is
mis-aligned with the telescope pupil image
The telescope simulator was mainly designed by Yuying Longval at IAS and installed at CEA
Saclay The eld of view of the TS is 80 mm 80 mm for a MIRIM eld of view of 72 mm 72 mm
An analysis of the image quality2 shows that the distortion amounts to 033 for the useful eld The
aperture is F20 in the image plane The exit pupil location is 30175 mm from the image plane for
a diameter of 1516 mm The pupil is 754 mm in diameter To implement the MIRIM cryostat in a
minimum space folding mirrors are used
An IR point source with a shutter is mounted on a remotely controlled hexapod that can be moved
in 3 directions X Y and Z The minimum diameter of the point source is 30 m and the temperature
of the source is 1150 K for the imaging mode or 2000 K for the coronographic mode An extended
black body source 400 K can also be used The 10K screen in the cryostat is tted with a neutral

density ND that reduces the ux due to the 295K background All the tests were performed when
the instrument is cold During each of the tests the temperature of the instrument must be between
5 and 7K and stable at 250 mK The detector temperature is 67K and is stable at 10 mK For a
more detailed description of the test bench see Amiaux et al 2008
At the time of the FM test campaign the lter wheel assembly was not available because of
vibration testing and only one lter 56 m was available The lter wheel was replaced by a mono-
lter wheel often called a cyclop tool Since there was no dark position available a chopper has
been used The different types of images produced are listed in Table 111 A measurement cycle
consists in two sub-cycles shutter closed shutter open The exposition time or the total duration of
a measurement Texp ie total time to get one INT image is calculated as follows
Texp  Ncycles  Tcycle 
where Tcycle is the duration of a cycle We have Ncycles  NNDIT where N is the total number of
DIT images see Table 111 for denition required to achieve a given signal ratio and NDIT is the
number of DIT images per half cycle The duration of a cycle is given by
Tcycle  2  NDITSKIP  NDIT  DIT  1fCHOP 
where NDITSKIP is the number of images to skip at the beginning of the cycle delay for the shutter
to close DIT the detector integration time and fCHOP the chopping frequency The factor of 2 is
because there are two half-cycles per cycle shutter close and shutter open
113 Overview of the MIRIM optical performance tests
The rst tests in the infrared at cryogenic temperatures were performed on the ETM at CEA between
February and April 2008 An overview of the optical performance tests is presented in the owchart of
Fig 115 The ETM model is fully representative in terms of optical path but not in terms of alignment
of the optical path Indeed the ETM FWA is a proto-type without requirements on alignment Below
is a brief description of these tests Similar tests have been performed on the Flight Model Dec

Distortion grid at ambient and cold temperatures
a grid of 87 87 pinholes 5 m in diameter
with a regular pitch is mounted at the entrance focal plane illuminated by an optical LED and imaged
with a 2048 2048 CCD chip This setup allows to measure the magnication and the distorsion over
the whole eld of view in one image at ambient temperature  300 K Shims3 are used to simulate
a possible telescope defocus The CCD camera tool is equipped with a micrometric translation stage
along the optical axis which allows to explore and to search the best focus position This test is also
performed at cryogenic temperatures and with infrared light which allows to assess image quality and
perform at eld measurements
Alignment check at ambient and cold The alignment consists in pointing the coronagraphic di-
aphragms with an alignment telescope that is coaligned with MIRIM optical axis A correction is
applied by shimming the M1 in order to minimize the shift between the optical axis and the centre of
the diaphragms This test has been performed at ambient and croygenic temperatures

For the microscanning the shutter is used in chopping mode see sect 112 A total of 8 DIT
frames is taken for each cycle openclose shutter A 72  64 sub-array is read out with a detector
integration time DIT  0827 s Thus according to Eq 112 the duration of a cycle is Tcycle 
1323 s For each cycle that is beginning the rst frame is skipped because during this frame the
shutter is closing Then the following 3 DIT frames are skipped because of latency effects on the
detector since the point source is very bright Therefore we use the last 4 frames of the cycle Each
exposure comprises 10 cycles so the exposure time is Texp  1323 s A median image is created
from these 10 cycles
1142 Linearity correction for the response of the detector
JPL and CEA performed tests of the response of the detector and it appears that the detector is non
linear over a wide range of ADU values To quantify the impact of the non-linear response curve on
the PSF measurements S Ronayette and myself provide two sets of test data one that is not corrected
for the detector response and the other which is corrected for the non-linearity I have performed the
PSF analysis on the two data sets to compare the results
The MIRIM detector is a 1024  1024 pixels SiAs array JPL has delivered a Raytheon SB305
detector to CEA The detector conguration will be a Sensor Chip Assembly SCA ie an ultra-light
mechanical  electrical housing CEA has developed an appropriate housing similar to the MIRI
focal plane to mount the IR detector onto the imager for the cold tests Thus qualitative analysis of
the optical properties including stray light performances are possible
Fig 116 presents the detector response Measurements have been done by V Moreau at CEA on
the SB305 detector at 5 K with an extended blackbody source in front of the detector The source is
at constant temperature 30 K and the integration time is the only parameter that changes The longer
the integration time the higher the signal in units of ADU The 30 K blackbody source does not
allow us to explore the linear part of the response curve at low ADU values since with the smallest
integration time 27 s see chapter 10 sect 1035 we reach a signal of 26 360 ADU see Fig 116

Fine measurements a low integrated uxes were performed with colder black body sources not
shown here An accurate sampling of the response curve at low ADU values shows that the response

black body sources It allows to do a ne sampling of the beginning of the response curve at low
levels where the response is approximately linear Fig 116 shows the read value as a function of the

To apply the linearity correction we derive Scor from Sread and correct all the individual images
Fig 117 compares the PSF proles when the linearity correction is applied or not The correction
enhances the highest values of the signal so it improves the sharpness of the PSFs
115 The micro-scanning test
In this section we rst describe the goals principle and experimental method to perform the mi-
croscanning Then results are discussed This test together with eld of view measurements led
to the discovery of a defect in the instrument after the rst FM1 test campaign This defect was a
tilt of the M4 mirror see Fig 1010 for the position of this mirror in the optical layout of the instru-
ment This anomaly was corrected and a second test campaign was performed FM2 We show the
differences in the optical quality of the instrument before and after correction for the two FM test
campaigns FM1 and FM2

Figure 118 Pattern of the microscan A 1111 points scanning grid has been performed correspond-
ing to a total scanning area of 1 pixel on the detector plane The source has been moved by steps of
7 m on the hexapod mount of the telescope simulator This corresponds to individual displacements
of 25 m on the detector plane
1151 Aims and experimental method
Since the physical size4 of the pixels is 25 m the Point Spread Function PSF of the instrument
is not Nyquist-sampled at a wavelength of 56 m the theoretical FWHM of the PSF at 56 m is
0185 ie is less than 2 pixels which is the shortest wavelength for MIRI and the most critical
for the assessment of the optical quality Therefore it is difcult to check the optical quality of the
instrument at this wavelength with a single point source image
The goal of the microscanning test is to obtain a high-resolution HR image of the PSF from
multiple low-resolution LR raw images In other words the microscanning aims at providing
a highly-sampled image of the PSF Such a resolution enhancement approach has been an active
research area in particular in image or video processing and it is sometimes called over-resolution
image reconstruction or simply resolution enhancement Here the HR PSFs are used to perform an
accurate measurement of the MIRIM image quality
The basis of the inversion method used to analyse the microscanning data has been developed to
perform high spectral and spatial resolution spectroscopy with Spitzer telescope InfraRed Spectrome-
ter IRS data Rodet et al 2009 This work relies on a fruitful collaboration between the LSS5 and
the IAS institutes in Orsay With the help of T Rodet LSS I have applied Matlab algorithms of data
inversion to process the microscanning data and analyse the results with standard tools IRAF IDL

optical PSF x to the low-resolution ones yk that we observe
The microscanning test is performed at cryogenic temperatures and at a wavelength of 56 m No
other lter was available at that time because the lter wheel was not delivered to CEA The method
consists in scanning a point source in a ne spatial resolution The microscan pattern is given in
Fig 118 A 11  11 points grid has been done corresponding to a total scanning area of 1 MIRIM
pixel on the detector plane ie an area of 102 pixels2 The source has been moved by steps of 7 m on
the hexapod mount This corresponds to individual displacements of 25 m on the detector plane In
the following sub-sections the method we apply to reconstruct the high-resolution images is detailed
1152 Direct and inverse problem
The total point spread function P SFtot of an imaging system consists of several components Firstly
the light is diffracted within the optics This part will be denoted P SFopt For instance P SFopt is
an Airy disk in case of a circular aperture Once the light has passed through the optical elements
mirrors lters gratings etc the signal is integrated on the sensor array composed of squared
detectors pixels Because the area of a pixel is not innitely small this causes blurring P SFdet
which can be modeled by a uniform square function if the spatial response of a pixel is at over its
entire area The total PSF can be computed by convolution of its different parts6
P SFtot  P SFopt cid63 P SFdet
The process of generation of the images is schematically shown on Fig 119 We denote x the high-
resolution HR optical PSF The aim of the deconvolution method is to deduce x from multiple
low-resolution images yk the observed data
Let us describe the direct problem by assuming that we start from the high-resolution image x
The high-resolution optical PSF x that we want to estimate is rst translated because of the motions of
the source Then the observed and translated images yk are the result of the convolution by the PSF
of the detector P SFdet In the schematic Fig 119 we separate the integration of the detector in two
6There are additional parts that contribute to the nal PSF that we do not consider here For instance motion of the
sensor platform causes blurring In addition the electronic components cause smoothing by applying a low-pass lter to
reduce noise

Figure 1110 Sketch of the different steps to reconstruct the high-resolution image inverse problem
steps 1 a convolution by the PSF of an over-sampled ne grid detector a detector that would have
smaller pixels than the real detector of the instrument and 2 a down-sampling operation needed
to degrade the resolution of the ne detector to the real low-resolution of the obervations The ratio
between the pixel size on the ne grid and the physical size on the real detector is named over-sampling
factor f which represents the gain in resolution
We formalize these operations by matrix multiplications We dene three matrices Tk R et
S which are associated with the operations of translation convolution by the impulse-response of a
pixel and down-sampling respectively Thus the direct problem can be summarized as
yk  SRTkx  nk
with k  1     N N is the total number of images taken at different positions on the detector n
is the noise whose level is assumed to be commesurate for all the images Note that in Eq 116 the
only operation that is different from an image to another is the translation Tk
To obtain high values of the over-sampling factor gain in resolution one needs to know very
precisely the translations between images Unfortunately this is not the case for our experimental
setup Although the hexapod where the point source is mounted is designed to allow ne mo-
tions of the source we note signicant mismatches between the expected position and the effective
observed location of the source Therefore we decided to estimate the relative positions between im-
ages by a technique which is independant of the mechanical control of the hexapod We perform
cross-correlation calculations between a reference images and the other translated images in order to
estimate the shifts between images This is the rst step of our inversion problem
Fig 1110 shows a sketch of the inverse problem To reconstruct a high-resolution image from N
low-resolution ones we proceed in three steps
1 we rst estimate the translation between the low-resolution LR images by cross correlation
see sect 1153 for details
2 then we co-add the LR images on a ne grid assuming that there is no convolution by the PSF
of the detector

3 nally we solve the deconvolution problem
This algorithm is a simplied version of a more complex algorithm developped by Rodet et al 2009
1153 Estimate of the translations between images and co-addition
Although the translation between the point source images is mechanically controlled we note that the
effective position of the source is slightly different from the expected position Therefore we compute
the shifts between a reference image and the current translated image and we compare the result to
the expected position that the hexapod should have given
We estimate the relative motions between the images with a cross-correlation technique To de-
termine sub-pixel translations between images we perform a bilinear interpolation on an HR grid at
a resolution equal to three times the over-sampling factor 3  f We dene the rst image as the
the reference image Iref and we search in an exhaustive manner the displacement that maximizes
the cross-correlation factor Cor between the reference image and the current translated one I The
cross-correlation is computed as
CorI Iref  
Ii j  cid104Icid105 Iref i j  cid104Irefcid105
In Eq 117 Iref and I are the standard deviations of the matrices Iref and I respectively cid104Irefcid105
and cid104Icid105 are the averages of Iref and I respectively
Then these motions are compared with the expected values measured with the hexapod A sub-
pixel precision is obtained Fig 1111 shows an example of the comparison between the read position
of the hexapod expected position in blue and the position estimated by cross-correlation in red
The agreement between expected and estimated positions for the displacement in the X-direction is
very good However a slight discrepancy is seen for the Y -direction The hexapod did not move at the
expected positions in this direction This issue is likely to be due to the control system of the hexapod
support which is not optimally designed to perform translations along the X and Y axis
The mismatch between estimated and expected relative motions between images introduces errors
in the reconstruction method if one uses the expected positions Therefore the estimated motions are
used to reconstruct the high resolution image We also compare the results if one uses the expected
motions
Assuming that the translations Tk are known we co-add low-resolution images yk onto an over-
resolved image ne grid We choose the over-sampling factor f such that 7 cid54 f cid54 10 Thus a HR
image z is created but it is still blurred because of the response of the detector The slight discrepancy
between expected and estimated positions Tk represents a lack of information in particular in the
Y -direction Some pixels of the HR image z are not present in the data yk
1154 Deconvolution
We denote z the LR image that have been over-sampled on a ne grid This image is still blurred
but its number of pixels is a factor f 2 higher than the observed LR image z is the convolution of the
HR image x that we want to calculate by the impulse-response PSF of the detector

Figure 1111 Expected vs Estimated displacements of the source in the X and Y directions during
the microscanning A slight discrepancy is seen between the estimated moves on the image and the

of the hexapod is difcult For the X-direction the agreement is excellent
Figure 1112 PSF data co-added on a ne grid for an over-sampling factor of 11 The white pixels
show the truncation of the data lack of information The left panel shows the co-added image when
the expected shifts between images are used Since the microscan comprises 10 shifts the truncation
of the data is a cross-hatching with 11 pixels between each white line On the right panel the effective
shifts estimated by cross-correlation are used Additional truncation can be seen due to the mismatch
of the expected and effective translations between images see text for details
One cannot apply the classical methods of deconvolution because part of the data is not observed due
to uncertainties on the translations see sect 1153 Indeed there are missing parts holes in the

data because the source is not exactly at its expected position on the ne grid image The Fig 1112
shows the PSF data co-added onto a ne grid with an over-sampling factor of 11 We illustrate the
truncation of the data by comparing the results of the co-addition when using the expected positions
of the source to the results when using the shifts estimated by cross-correlation The additional
truncation for the effective translations comes from the mismatch between expected and real position
of the source
We take into account the truncation of the data by introducing a matrix T in Eq B1
z  T Rx  n  Hx  n
T is a mask with pixels value of 1 where the data exists and 0 otherwise The operator H  T R
returns the measurements z from the HR image x
To solve the deconvolution problem a Bayesian formalism is used In practice the deconvolution
consists of minimizing a least-square criterion The formalism and the method used to solve the
deconvolution problem and estimate x is detailed in Appendix B
116 Results
We rst describe the results of the rst test campaign of the Flight Model FM1 and show that the
PSF characteristics of the intrument were out of specications After correction of the defect exhibited
with these tests we compare the results between the FM1 and FM2 test campaigns
1161 Analysis of the MIRIM PSF
The analysis of the 56 m images taken during the microscanning test was done with IDL routines
The results have been compared and complemented with the use of the IRAF software Different
measurements of the FWHM of the PSFs have been performed Gauss Bessel and moffat ts radial
proles etc I have written a technical document for the MIRI European Consortium EC about
the focus and FOV exploration with a point source tests was written document MIRI-TN-00743-
IAS In this document not reproduced here the techniques used to measure the FWHM of the PSF
are detailed Here we rather focus on the main results of the microscanning test These results are
gathered in an other EC document see Appendix C sect C3 for a list of these documents and I have
written a SPIE paper that will be submitted for the next SPIE conference Observational Frontiers of
Astronomy for the New Decade in June 2010
Fig 1114 shows an example of reconstructed HR PSF The linearity correction is applied and the
the size of a pixel is 36 m instead of 25 m for a standard
over-sampling factor is set to 7 ie
MIRI image The secondary Airy diffraction ring which is barely visible on low-resolution images
is exhibited on the HR images as well as the shape of the lobes The radial prole of the HR PSF is
shown on the right of Fig 1114
Different high-resolution PSF images and all the quantitative results for the FM1 tests are gathered
in Table 112 The results are shown for images that have been corrected for the detector response
linearity correction These images correspond to over-sampling factors equal to 7 10 and 11 The
rst value corresponds to a reasonable compromise between the gain in resolution and the introduction

Figure 1113 Comparison between Low- and High-Resolution images data in the upper panel sim-
ulations at the bottom The upper right image is the high-resolution image reconstructed from the
data with an over-sampling factor of 7 The bottom right image show a HR PSF image simulated
with Zemax Note that the shape of the secondary lobes agrees very well between the data and the
simulation
of artefacts in the reconstructed images The last one 11 is chosen to show the limits of the method
In this case the pixel size 23 m is smaller than the microscanning step 25 m For an over-
sampling factor of 7 resp 11 one original MIRIM pixel equals to 72 resp 112 pixels in the
super-resolution image The pixel sizes in the HR images are  36 m and  23 m respectively
Table 112 also shows the results of the simulations of MIRIM PSFs with Zemax These sim-
ulations are done at two resolutions the standard one 25 m  pixel and a ne re-sampled one
3125 m  pixel which allows the comparison with the HR reconstructed PSFs
The correction for the response of the detector decreases the width of the computed MIRIM PSFs
The reason is that the deviation to the linearity is greater at high uxes than that at low values see
Fig 116 and 117 The FWHM of the corrected PSFs are  5  lower than the raw ones The X Y 
or radial proles of the SR PSFs are well tted by an Airy disk Fig 1114 The measured FWHM

Figure 1114 Image of the HR PSF and its radial 1D prole The oversampling factor is 7 and the
linearity correction has been applied The pixel size equals to 36 m The radial prole has been
tted with an Airy disk function It gives a FWHM of 4716 m
with Airy ts on the HR PSF are of the order of 46  50 m for both X- and Y - directions Gaussian
ts to the core of the PSF give slightly lower values  44  47 m
HR PSF proles in the X- and Y - directions are shown on Fig 1115 1116 and 1117 For
comparison the PSF proles of one low-resolution image one single position MIRIM image is
plotted for the corresponding number of pixels Airy and Gaussian ts have been performed in the
X- and Y - directions We show on Fig 1115 and 1116 the results of the Airy ts on the data and
the Zemax simulations The better sampling of the PSF helps in reconstructing more accurately the
main peak of the PSF The secondary diffraction lobes are also resolved We note that the positions
and amplitudes of the secondary lobes do not match exactly with the Airy ts
For an over-sampling factor of 11 we reach the limit of the method and one can see artefacts on
the reconstructed image in both X- and Y - directions see Table 112 They may be due to errors
in the motions estimations signal-to-noise limitations and simplications made in the model of the
detector and of the pixels uniform response etc For an over-sampling factor of 7 most of the
artefacts are removed in the X- directions The remaining artefacts in the Y -direction are due to the
errors in the motion estimation see Fig 1111 The Y - direction prole exhibit a slight distorsion of
the shape of the main peak Fig 1117

Conclusion of the FM1 tests a defect in the instrument
From the results gathered in Table 112 we note that the FWHM of the HR PSFs are systematically
larger than the measured FWHM on the HR simulated Zemax PSF The discrepancy is about 8 m
after correction for the non-linearity of the detector This mismatch is out of the specications of the
instrument This out-of-specication issue was also revealed independently by an another test The
measurement of the MIRIM eld of view shows a vignetting issue which seems to conrm that a
defect is present in the instrument The left panel of Fig 1118 shows the eld of view of the imager
during the FM1 test campaign Note that the bottom of the FoV is lost
Motivated by these tests a new metrology analysis of the instrument was done by engineers from
the CEA Saclay and IAS Orsay The engineers from the IAS provided a Faro arm a special tool to
perfom the metrology It was rst thought that the root cause of the out-of-specication optical quality
of the instrument was due to a misalignment of the detector It turned out that this was not the case
In-depth investigations concluded to a slight interference between the structure of the Three-Mirror-
Anastigmatic TMA objective and the M4 mirror see Fig 1010 and sect 1032 for a description
of the optical layout of MIRIM This design problem caused a tilt of the M4 mirror with respect to
its nominal positioning The M4 mirror has been found damaged with some bending of its mounting
exible pad This tilt results in a degradation of the nominal PSF properties and the FoV area

resolution of 25 m  pixel 2 rst plots and a high-resolution of 3125 m  pixel 2 last plots Red

The cause of the interference between the TMA structure and the M4 mirror has been removed
manually The damaged M4 mirror was replaced by the Flight Spare model A second test campaign
FM2 was launched and we performed the same microscanning analysis to check the optical quality
of the PSF This story illustrates well the need to perform accurate tests on the ground Indeed the
discrepancy on the PSF characteristics could not have been exhibited without the deconvolution of
high-resolution images from the microscanning data
1162 Results of the FM2 tests after correction of the M4 tilt
Comparison between FM1 and FM2 tests
The results of the microscanning analysis and PSF measurements for the FM2 test campaign are
gathered in Table 113 Gaussian ts to the PSFs show that the FWHM are of the order of 44 m
019 arcsec at 56 m which brings this value inside the specication range7 The effect of the cor-
rection of the tilf of the M4 mirror is clearly visible on the HR reconstructed PSFs Note that this effect
is not measurable of the raw LR images which emphasizes the importance of this microscanning
test and analysis
7The specication on the PSF is not expressed in terms of FWHM but in terms of wavefront errors WFE A zemax
calculation performed by S Ronayette CEA was used to translate the WFE into FWHL tolerances

Encircled energy of a point source image
The encircled energy is another way of estimating the optical quality of the PSF The requirements for
MIRI are the following The MIRI imager data shall include more than 56  of the encircled energy
of the image of a point source at wavelengths longward of 56 m within the angular diameter of the
rst dark Airy ring Note that in the MIRI requirement document the encircled energy is dened
relative to the energy within a radius of 5 arcsec equivalent projected onto the sky
The encircled energy Er of a radially symmetric point spread function r can be dened as
the integral
cid90 r
For the purpose of comparison to the requirement document we wish to normalise Er to 1 at
r  5 arcseconds However our microscanning data acquisition was done for a sub-array of  2cid48cid48
so we have normalized the encircled energy to a 2 arcsec radius Therefore it is difcult to relate our
results to the specication requirements at 5 arcsec

the two curse is very good suggesting that the instrument is close to its nominal behaviour The
diameter of the rst dark ring can be interpreted as the rst point of inection in Er ie the value of
r for which d2Edr2  0 We nd an encircled energy of 73  inside the central lobe
Note that the measured variation of encircled energy with radial distance from a point image is
very sensitive to the ux levels at large radial distances One must ensure that dEdr cid62 0 for all
values of r for the measurement to make sense Here this condition is satised because we work at
high background values The telescope simulator is at ambient temperatures thus producing a high
thermal background
117 Summary and conclusions
This chapter reports the rst detailed analysis of the characteristics of the Point Spread Function PSF
of the Flight Model of the JWST Mid-InfraRed IMager MIRIM The data are taken at 56 m the
only lter available at that time We discuss the results of the microscanning test that has been
performed at cryogenic temperatures in December 2008 - March 2009 at CEA Saclay This high-
resolution HR technique is used to characterize the MIRIM optical quality The microscanning
consists in a ne sub-pixel scanning of a point source on the focal plane A deconvolution algorithm
is used to reconstruct HR PSFs The main results are the following
1 The microscanning test provides a signicant improvement for the analysis of the PSF charac-
teristics This test allows to resolve the diffraction pattern of MIRIM and to measure accurately
the width of the PSF for the FM We conrm the global shape of the PSF secondary lobes that
is seen on HR Zemax simulations
2 The FWHM of the high-resolution reconstructed images are  48  50 m ie 021  022 
for the rst test campaign We note a discrepancy of  8 m between the data and the high-
resolution Zemax simulations The microscanning test together with eld of view measure-
ments showed that a defect was present in the instrument The main cause for the mismatch
between simulations and MIRIM data has been identied Metrology measurements of the
MIRIM mechanical and optical layout have shown a out-of-specication tilt of the M4 mirror
This tilt was due to an interference between the MIRIM structure and the mirror This manufac-
turing fault has been corrected and a second test campaign began in February 2009 The results
show that the FWHM of the HR PSFs are 44  46 m ie 019cid48cid48
specications The FWHM are only  4 m compared to high-resolution simulations
 020cid48cid48 which is within the
3 Slight differences between the simulated PSF patterns and the MIRIM HR reconstructed data
are exhibited We discuss the limits of the method due to errors in the relative positions of
the images and the lack of information signal-to-noise limitations assumptions made on the
characteristics of the detector etc
4 The MIRI detector shows a non-linear response curve This result is conrmed by independant
measurements by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL responsible for the detector array We
show that the correction for the response of the detector improves the quality of the MIRIM
PSFs The FWHM of the corrected PSFs are  5  lower than the raw ones

121 Overview of the JWST scientic goals
The science of the JWST is denitively oriented towards high-redshift astrophysics If one looks at
NASAs website the JWST science drivers are divided into four main topics
1 First Light after the big bang To nd and study the rst luminous objects proto-galaxies
supernova black holes
2 Assembly of Galaxies To study the merging of proto-galaxies effects of black holes history
of star formations
3 Birth of Stars and Planetary Systems JWST will study how stars form in dust clouds and how
chemical elements are produced and re-circulated
4 Planetary Systems and Origin of Life To study the formation of planets and obtain direct ob-
servations of other planetary systems as well as study of outer solar system
Based on these themes several science working groups were created in January 2009 to start working
on precise proposals of observations with MIRI in preparation of the guaranteed time projects I
signed up into two of them the working group Galaxy evolution between z  06  6 led by P
Van Der Werf and the working group Interstellar medium led by Alain Abergel
With F Boulanger and N Nesvadba we started to work on a proposal to observe H2 luminous ob-
jects with MIRI The next section reproduces the proposal I have written and submitted to the Galaxy
Evolution group I also participated to a proposal written by Alain Abergel on the observations of
nearby PDRs to probe the gas and dust physics at the cloudinter-cloud interface
122 Tracing the kinetic energy dissipation associated with galaxy merg-
ing and AGN feedback at z  15  35 with MIRI
Here is the proposal I have written with F Boulanger and N Nesvadba and submitted to the Galaxy
Evolution working group
1221 Background
The build-up of baryonic mass in galaxies is regulated by a complex interplay between gravitational
collapse galaxy merging and feedback related to AGN and star formation Fig 91 These processes
may inject sufcient mechanical energy into the interstellar medium ISM to potentially have a major
impact on star formation and galaxy assembly This will be particularly important during the early
phases of galaxy evolution at high redshift when galaxies were gas-rich and most of the stars in the
universe were formed
The molecular gas plays a critical role in this context since it represents an important if not
dominant cooling agent in the energetics of galaxy merging and feedback Recent observations by the
InfraRed Spectrograph IRS onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope have discovered a signicant and
diverse population of low-z objects where the mid-infrared rotational line emission of H2 is strongly
enhanced LH2  1040  1043 erg s1 while star formation is suppressed Fig 12 This suggest
122 H2-luminous sources with MIRI
that shocks are the primary cause of the H2 emission Ogle et al 2007 Guillard et al 2009c This
sample of H2-luminous sources includes galaxies in several key phases of their evolution dominated
by gas accretion Egami et al 2006 galaxy interactions Appleton et al 2006 or galactic winds
driven by star formation eg M82 Engelbracht et al 2006 and AGN Ogle et al 2009
Constraining the impact of merging and AGN feedback on the formation and evolution of massive
galaxies can only be addressed through direct observations at z  2 near the cosmologically most
active period of star formation galaxy interactions and AGN activity By analogy to our models on
local H2-luminous objects Guillard et al 2009c we expect the mid-IR lines to be the dominant
cooling lines for warm 1023 K gas in the strongly shocked highly turbulent colliding ows in
galaxy interactions eg the galaxy-wide shock in Stephans Quintet but also eg in AGN-driven
outows High gas velocity dispersions measured in z  2 actively star-forming galaxies show that
the gas kinematics in these systems was strongly disturbed compared to galaxies today eg Lehnert
et al 2009 We expect the molecular gas to be highly turbulent and therefore the warm H2 emission
to be more frequent and more powerful than at low-z
1222 The proposal
The MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer MRS will be the rst IFU instrument to provide the
sensitivity and resolving power to spatially and spectrally resolve H2 and forbidden ionized gas lines
at rest-frame near-IR and mid-IR wavelengths out to z  15  35 For the rst time this will
allow us to directly investigate the physical state and the kinematics of the ionized gas and the warm
 150 K molecular gas that is dynamically heated by the dissipation of mechanical energy associated
with galaxy merging and AGN feedback We propose MIRIMRS observations of selected sources to
address the following questions
 Are AGN driving massive multiphase outows carrying away the bulk of the ISM of the galaxy
and therefore quenching star formation in the host galaxy If this is the case we should ob-
serve broad luminous H2 emission lines with widths of 1000 kms or more by analogy to
the large velocity shears and dispersions that have been revealed by near-infrared integral eld
spectroscopy of the rest-frame optical emission lines in HzRGs Nesvadba et al 2006 2008a
The propose MIRI observations will allow to quantify the energy radiated and carried away by
molecular outows
 Does the H2 emission trace pre-starburst phases of interacting galaxies Spitzer observa-
tions of the Stephans Quintet revealed that H2 line emission represents a major fraction of the
bolometric luminosity of the galaxy-wide shock Appleton et al 2006 This is a nearby ex-
ample of an H2-bright early phase of a galaxy interaction and we expect these systems to be
more frequent and more active at high-z The proposed MIRI spectroscopy will explore galaxy
evolution beyond the active starburst and obscuredunobscured AGN phases highlighted by
luminous dust emission and test whether H2 emission is scaled-up at high-z or not
Which lines will we look at To establish the energy budget of the warm molecular gas and shock
diagnostics we will use in most cases the full MIRI spectral range In particular
12 Science with the JWST and MIRI
 we will concentrate on the near-IR ro-vibrational lines eg
the H2 1-0 S1 212 m line
and the mid-IR pure rotational H2 0-0 S3 97 m and S5 69 m lines These lines will be
redshifted in the MRS spectral range 49  286 m for z  15  35
the molecular gas with that of the ionized gas
 the forbidden ionized gas lines eg Ne II Ne III will be used to compare the kinematics of
 the synergy with NIRSPEC will be helpful to observe the CO bandheads and Ca II triplet to
estimate the stellar kinematics This will allow to estimate the ratio between the bulk galaxy
rotation and the gas velocity dispersion in these high-z objects and provide an absolute rest-
frame in which to interpret the gas motions as blueshift or redshift
1223 The sample
We propose to observe a representative sample of order 20-30 strongly star forming and AGN host
galaxies at z  15  35 using the MIRI medium-resolution R  2200 spectrometer MRS
IFU mode Our sample will include powerful radio galaxies as well as radio-loud and radio-quiet
obscured and unobscured AGN We will also include powerful dusty starburst galaxies like sub-
millimeter galaxies and infrared-selected galaxies many of which will be mergers Suitable parent
samples already exist eg Nesvadba et al 2009 in preparation for HzRGs with deep rest-optical
IFU observations Greve et al 2005 for SMGs with CO observations Yan et al 2005 for powerful
infrared galaxies at z  2 Farrah et al 2008 for 24 m selected starbursts with PAH detections
etc and will be extended with the upcoming Herschel mission The development of our models will
also help in selecting high-z non IR-luminous interacting systems that may be pre-starbursts
1224 Observing mode and integration times
Galaxies at high-z are gas-rich and large gas velocity dispersions show that the gas is not fully settled
in a rotating disk This surplus in mechanical energy must be dissipated Therefore we expect H2
emission to be more powerful at high-z than for local sources
We base the required sensitivity on the H2 luminosity of the most luminous low-redshift sources at
low redshift a few 1043 erg s1 With the resolving power of the MRS R  2200 corresponding
to a resolution of FWHM  140 km s1 and typical observed line widths of FWHM  800 km s1
the lines will be resolved by a factor  6 Typical sizes of the outows are  5 for an IFU eld
of view of  8  8 for   17 m Given that the spatial sampling is 064 across the slice and
027 along the slice we will be able to resolve the molecular gas emission spatially and spectrally
and perform the rst spectral mappings of molecular AGN outows at high-redshift Using the MIRI
performance estimation and assuming a narrow line plus extended source we can reach an RMS of
1020 W m2 in 1 hour of on-source observing time for a  3  3 eld At z  25 this will
correspond to a 10  detection limit for an H2 luminosity of 3  1043 erg s1 for the integrated
spectrum The typical observing time will be  1 hr on-source per exposure ie 3 hrs to cover the
full wavelength range A B and C exposures The total observing time for this project excluding
overheads would be of the order of 60 hrs for  20 sources

Abstract
Observations of H2 luminous galaxies set molecular gas in a new context where one has to ac-
count for the presence of H2 outside galactic disks characterize its physical state and describe
its relation to star formation These observations and the theoretical framework presented in this
manuscript motivate new observations and theoretical studies that are discussed here In partic-
ular as for Stephans Quintet in many of the H2-luminous galaxies the molecular gas has been
detected through the mid-IR H2 rotational lines prior to any CO observation Thus we propose to
complement our knowledge of the mass and kinematics of the molecular gas in these sources by
CO observations Then I present the theoretical perspectives with emphasis on new numerical
studies that are needed to understand how the bulk kinetic energy released in the multiphase ISM
during violent phases of galaxy interactions is transferred into the warm molecular gas

131 Observational perspectives
This thesis work has rich observational perspectives The ow of the discovery of H2-luminous
galaxies and the observational and theoretical work presented in this manuscript has inspired a
large number of follow-up observations Here are a few examples that will complement our view of
molecular gas in galaxy evolution
1311 The search for molecular gas in active phases of galaxy evolution
A series of upcoming observations are proposed to search for warm H2 or associated CO gas in  
13 Perspectives
compact groups of galaxies a Spitzer proposal PI PN Appleton was prepared during my PhD
to search for H2 in HCGs1 This project has been motivated by the discovery of powerful H2
emission from the Stephans Quintet group It has been observed and the data is being reduced
I will participate to the interpretation of this data during my postdoc
radio-galaxies we propose to look for CO emission in a sample of radio-galaxies with the IRAM
30-m telescope PI M Lehnert The proposal has been submitted in September 2009 These
observations will determine the amount of kinetic energy carried by the cold molecular gas in
these radio-galaxies
Observations at high spatial resolution of two specic radio galaxies 3C293 and 3C433 with
the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer PdBI have been proposed PI N Nesvadba
These two sources where powerful H2 is detected are more complex than 3C326 because they
exhibit star formation
In addition a proposal has been submitted PI N Nesvadba to look at the Minkowskis
object a nearby and young starburst that might be triggered by the jet of a nearby radio galaxy
This is our best candidate for positive feedback The proposal aims at determining the mass
and kinematics of the cold molecular gas in order to check whether these objects veries the
Schmidt law We plan to complement these observations with VIMOS2 observations
the M82 starburst driven wind We have submitted PI F Boulanger a proposal in September
2009 to look for CO emission in the M82 superwind We obtained deep Spitzer IRS observations
of the warm molecular gas in the wind PI L Armus but the spectral resolution is not high
enough to measure outow velocities or line widths The CO data will allow to derive the
kinematics of the cold gas in the wind which will help in elucidating some of the questions
raised above
1312 Observing H2-luminous galaxies with the JWST
During my PhD work I have been working on the tests and the scientic preparation of the Mid-
Infrared Instrument MIRI that will be part of the scientic payload of the James Webb Space Tele-
scope see chapter 11 and 12
H2 in active phases of galaxy evolution at high-z
In particular I have proposed a specic project to look at high-z H2-luminous objects with MIRI
to the MIRI European Consortium The proposal is reproduced in chapter 12 It is specic to the
MIRI instrument and relies on the background presented in chapter 10 For the rst time MIRI will
allow us the study the kinematics and excitation of the warm H2 gas in high-z objects To collect
a sample of high-z objects we will use the analogy between the characteristics of VLTSINFONI3

Figure 131 Observing H2 lines at high-redshift with JWSTMIRI The observed wavelengths of some
H2 lines are shown as a function of the redshift The colored bars indicate the channels and bands of
the Medium Resolution Spectrometer MRS of the MIRI instrument One observation corresponds to
four sub-bands like 1A 2A 3A 4A for instance see sect 1034 for technical details about how the
MRS is working The vertical lines indicate the redshifts of some high-z radio-galaxies that might
be interesting to look at with MIRI
and JWSTMIRI I will use high-z radio-galaxies SINFONI and Spitzer data PI N Nesvadba co-
I P Guillard as a starting point to dene the observing strategy MIRI will allow integral eld
spectroscopy of redshifted optical or H2 lines Fig 131 at high spatial 1-2 kpcpix and spectral
  3 000 resolution This spectral resolution is crucial to measure the kinematics of the
The Fig 131 shows the visibility of the some H2 lines as a function of redshift I also indicate as
a function of redshift in which sub-band of the Medium Resolution Spectrometer MRS these lines
are falling This allows to congure the instrument for observations and estimate the integration time
Fig 131 is thus useful to prepare observation proposals
An infrared high-resolution look at Stephans Quintet with JWST
In addition in the near future I will propose an observational program to investigate Stephans Quintet
with NirCamNirSpec and MIRI the near-IR and Mid-IR instruments onboard JWST see chapter 10
for an introduction to these instruments The NirCam and MIRI imagers will provide an unprece-
dented spatial resolution comparable to the HST at 7 m to study small scales structures in the shock
13 Perspectives
MIRI will allow us to clearly separate the dust emission associated with star-forming regions from that
associated with the shock itself Multi-band imaging with NirCam and MIRI will allow to build a full
map of spectral energy distributions from 06 to 28 m This may be used to search for variations of
the dust properties across the shock These variations may be interpreted in terms of dust processing
in shocks and possibly related to velocity gradients in the warm molecular gas
The spectral resolution of NirSpec see sect 1025 for technical details and MIRIs Medium
Resolution Spectrometer sect 1034 will provide for the rst time the kinematics of the warm H2
gas across the shock This will allow us to map the relative velocities and dispersion velocities over
the SQ ridge which we will compare with the kinematics of the CO gas presented in chapter 7 This
comparison will be particularly useful to estimate the efciency of the dynamical coupling between
the warm and cold molecular gas
132 Theoretical perspectives
The detection of powerful H2 emission in a diverse set of extragalactic sources with little or no star
formation highlights the need to understand the role of H2 formation and cooling for the dissipation
of mechanical energy in a multiphase ISM The previous sections have shown that these observations
provide insights in the physics of galaxy interactions or of the regulation of star forming activity in
radio galaxies An efcient transfer of the bulk kinetic energy to molecular gas is required to make
H2 an important coolant and thus explain these observations The dissipation of mechanical energy
within cold molecular gas H2 formation and its collisional excitation play a key-role in the physics
of turbulent mixing of gas phases
1321 A novel numerical study of the dynamical interactions between gas phases
In my thesis work I reached a qualitative understanding on how the energy transfer may occur The
fragmented multiphase structure of the ISM is likely to be a main aspect The dynamical interactions
between gas phases drive a mass cycle which contributes to the energy transfer in two ways 1
Gas cooling transfers the turbulent energy of the warm H II and H I to the H2 gas 2 The thermal
instability induced by the gas cooling transfers a signicant fraction of the thermal energy of the gas
to turbulent energy The turbulent velocities of the motions generated by the thermal instability are
expected to be commensurate with the sound speed in the warmer gas and thus are supersonic for the
colder gas These non-linear aspects of the dynamical interaction between gas phases can only be
investigated quantatively with numerical simulations
Numerical simulations eg Audit and Hennebelle 2005 show that the thermal instability pre-
vents energy from being radiated by the warmer gas to feed turbulence in the cooler gas
started a collaboration with P Lesaffre and E Audit which I will pursue and extend during my post-
doc We will use the RAMSES magnetohydrodynamical MHD adaptive Mesh Renement AMR
3-D code It is essential to resolve thermal instability to quantify energy and mass exchanges This
can only be achieved by including chemical evolution and its impact on the cooling efciencies and
we are currently writing a routine to introduce time-dependent chemistry and thermal diffusion in the
code The main coolants are C O H2 and CO This code will be used to model mass cycling and
mechanical energy dissipation in a mutiphase ISM This will be the rst simulation of the physical
132 Theoretical perspectives
and chemical evolution of a thermally unstable multiphase gas including a self-consistent treatment
of the H2 HI HII and hot phases of the ISM Including all phases requires a large dynamic range and
is beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art computing We will hence describe the processes sequen-
tially starting at the large scales As we proceed to smaller scales we will include a more detailed
description of the thermal budget and chemistry of the gas
We will rst study the effects of a large scale shock on a set of HI clouds embedded in a hot plasma
Then we will study the fate of one of these clouds in greater details as it is being fragmented We will
pay special attention to the energy transfer between these phases Thanks to our AMR approach and
with a careful treatment of the thermal and chemical diffusion accross the boundaries between these
various phases this will be possible
We will also explore the momentum and energy transfer from a hot stream of gas into an initially
static molecular cloud In both stellar and AGN feedback it is of crucial importance to determine
whether the dynamical coupling between the tenuous outow and the cloud is efcient and whether
it can power the amount of H2 emission seen in these H2-luminous sources
Due to their proximity starburst-driven winds or galactic supernova remnants provide a unique
opportunity to confront the model with data in great detail Our interpretation will be based on the
physical conditions inferred from these numerical models They will serve as input for detailed calcu-
lations of gas cooling and chemistry in shock models This method relates the observational approach
sect 131 with our numerical and analytical models and will also be applied to extragalactic sources
1322 Towards a phenomenological prescription of the impact of H2 on the energetics
of galaxy evolution
Though H2 emission is related to small scale processes its formation and cooling power play a ma-
jor role in the overall energetics of violent phases of galaxy evolution Numerical studies of galaxy
formation cannot properly account for these processes Small scale simulations with sufcient reso-
lution to include the detailed multiphase gas physics do not include the overall context of feedback
processes Inversely large-scale simulations can only include gas physics through phenomenological
recipes
From the results obtained from the observational sect 1312 and numerical sect 1321 ap-
proach of feedback an ultimate goal would be to distill reasonably simple but robust phenomenolog-
ical equations which would approximate the physics of energy dissipation and allow to predict H2
emission as a function of the physical parameters of a galaxy These equations will represent a crucial
input to cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and the growth of structure Ultimately this
will allow to determine the role of the gas for the build-up of galaxies and the importance of starburst
and AGN driven winds on the growth and properties of the ensemble of galaxies across cosmic time
Since most of the galaxy mass build-up occurred at redshifts between 1 and 2 this prescription
will need to be tested with direct observations of sources in this redshift range This will become
possible with JWSTMIRI see sect 1312

A thesis What a shock
In fact if you think about it a thesis
is a shock To be a PhD student is to
be shocked You are in the shock front
between what you believe to know the
postshock medium and the unknown
the preshock medium
In this shock
front you are heated to high tempera-

Sometimes you feel like going in the
postshock stay there to cool down a lit-

to the known Of course what you did
in the shock front greatly affected the
postshock but also what youre doing
in the shock front affects the future sci-

Obviously la vie nest pas un long euve tranquille the preshock medium is inhomogeneous
multiphased full of surprises Sometimes you propagate fast smoothly in a teneous medium whereas
sometimes you hit a denser problem and your speed is reduced you need to think harder Your
physical state in the shock depends on your progression speed Be careful of not going too fast be

Appendix A
Modeling dust emission the DUSTEM code
Abstract
This appendix briey presents the code that I have used to model the dust emission from the
Stephans Quintet galaxy collision This code so-called DUSTEM is an update of the Dsert
et al 1990 model which computes from an input radiation eld the emission temperature
distribution absorption and scattering cross-sections as a function of the wavelength for a size
distribution of grains including stochastically heated PAHs and very small grains In the case of
optically thick to UV radiation molecular clouds the DUSTEM code is coupled to a radiation
transfer code to take into account in a self-consistent way both the extinction and the heating of
dust grains by their own IR emission
A1 Introduction
Since the 1970s a lot of models were built to reproduce the observations of interstellar dust The
Dsert et al 1990 model is one example among others Since this rst publications a lot of mod-
ications have been done The most recent ones are reported in Compigne et al 2008 In the
following I briey give the main features of the DUSTEM model and its key parameters The inter-
ested reader may consult the PhD thesis by Compigne M 2007 Flagey N 2007 and Gonzalez
Garcia M 2009 for a description of the updates included in the code
A2 Dust models populations and size distributions of grains
The DUSTEM model includes a mixture of three populations of dust grains with increasing sizes
which is the minimum number of components needed to account for interstellar extinction and IR
dust emission These components are the following
 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons PAHs of radius a  04  12 nm responsible for the
Aromatic Infrared Bands AIBs and the FUV non-linear rise in the extinction curve Much of
the PAH emission is concentrated in features at 33 62 77 86 113 and 17 m Duley and
Williams 1981 followed by Lger and Puget 1984 identied these features as the optically
active vibrational modes of PAH molecules
 Very Small Grains VSGs a  1 4 nm which are carbonaceous nanoparticles producing the
mid-IR continuum emission and the extinction bump at 2175 
 Big Grains BGs a  4  110 nm of silicates with carbonaceous mantles or inclusions which
account for the far IR emission and the 1 rise at visible and near-IR wavelengths

the items above The parameters of the grains used in the version of the code I use are gathered in
Table A1
A3 Updates and calculations
The model is designed to t both the interstellar extinction curve see chapter 2 sect 232 Fig 24
and the infrared dust emission in particular that of the diffuse interstellar medium The dust proper-
ties the dust-to-gas mass ratio and the exciting radiation eld are provided by the user The code then
calculates the dust SED S in units of erg s1 H1 the distribution of dust temperatures as well as
the UV to IR absorption and scattering cross-sections in units of cm2 g1 for each dust grain species
as a function of the wavelength
Since the original version of Dsert et al 1990 the absorption cross sections of the PAHs with
addition of new Aromatic Infrared Bands AIBs and those of the VSGs and BGs as well as the heat
capacities graphite PAH C-H silicate and amorphous carbon have been updated Compigne et al
In the diffuse interstellar medium small grains PAHs and VSGs undergo temperature uctua-
tions triggered by the discrete absorption of stellar photons see eg Draine 2003 for a review They
cool by emission in the near and mid-IR range The code computes the probability distribution of
temperatures resulting from the stochastic heating of these grains Conversely BGs which have a
longer cooling time and a shorter timescale between absorption of two photons because of their size
stay at constant temperature The code computes their emission as a grey body

A6 When DUSTEM cooperates with the Meudon PDR1 code  
The spectral energy distribution of the IR dust emission does not only depend on the radiation eld and
the grain properties It also depends on the physical structure of the molecular gas and in particular
on its optical thickness to UV radiation If a molecular cloud illuminated by a UV radiation eld is
optically thick to UV photons the radiation eld is attenuated as it penetrates into the cloud thus
reducing the dust heating In addition dust emission has a positive feedback on its own IR emission
The local IR dust emission contributes to the IR radiation eld and becomes a signicant heat source
within dark clouds where UV light is attenuated I briey describe how these two effects are taken
into account in our modeling of dust emission from the Stephans Quintet galaxy collision presented
in chapter 8
Modeling dust emission from optically thick to UV molecular clouds
To model the dust emission from a molecular cloud that is optically thick to UV radiation see chap-
ter 8 and paper III I have used the Meudon PDR Photon Dominated Region code2 to compute
1Photon-Dominated Region

incorporated in the Virtual Observatory
A Modeling dust emission the DUSTEM code
the radiative transfer through the cloud This 1-dimensional steady-state model considers a station-
ary plane-parallel slab of gas and dust illuminated by UV radiation The radiation eld output I
of the Meudon PDR code is used as input to the DUSTEM program to compute the spectral energy
distribution SED of the dust as a function of the optical depth into the cloud
This 2-step process is iterated to take into account dust heating by the dust IR emission The
interface between the DUSTEM code and the Meudon PDR code represents a signicant update
described in the PhD thesis by Gonzalez Garcia M 2009 In the present version so-called PDR-
DUSTEM the thermal balance of the grains resulting from the IR continuum emission of the dust
is now solved A rst run is done with the Meudon PDR code to solve for the radiative transfer
and compute the radiation eld I through the slab of gas Then the DUSTEM program is called
to compute the dust temperature distribution and the dust contribution to I This 2-step process is
iterated until the calculation of the dust emission has converged usually 4  5 iterations
Appendix B
Deconvolution of high-resolution PSF bayesian formalism
Abstract
In this appendix I give a brief description of the formalism used to devonvolve a high-resolution
image from several low-resolution ones I have applied this algorithm to reconstruct a high resolu-
tion PSF image from the data provided by the microscanning test see chapter 11 This algorithm
was developed by T Rodet at LSS Orsay
B1 The inverse problem
The aim of the deconvolution is to reconstruct a high-resolution image denoted by x from multiple
low-resolution images These low-resolution images are co-added on a ne grid We denote z the
LR image that have been over-sampled on a ne grid This image is still blurred but its number of
pixels is a factor f 2 higher than the observed LR image z is the convolution of the HR image x that
we want to calculate by the impulse-response PSF of the detector
z  Rx  n
One cannot apply the classical methods of deconvolution because part of the data is not observed due
to uncertainties on the translations see sect 1153 Indeed there are missing parts holes in the
data because the source is not exactly at its expected position on the ne grid image The Fig 1112
shows the PSF data co-added onto a ne grid with an over-sampling factor of 11 We illustrate the
truncation of the data by comparing the results of the co-addition when using the expected positions
of the source to the results when using the shifts estimated by cross-correlation The additional
truncation for the effective translations comes from the mismatch between expected and real position
of the source
We recall that because of truncation of the data we miss some part of the data on the highly-
sampled grid a truncation matrix T is introduced in Eq B1
z  T Rx  n  Hx  n
T is a mask with pixels value of 1 where the data exists and 0 otherwise The operator H  T R
returns the measurements z from the HR image x To solve the deconvolution problem a bayesian
formalism is used In the following I briey give the basis of the formalism we use to estimate x the
HR image
B Deconvolution of high-resolution PSF bayesian formalism
B2 Bayesian inference
Solving inverse problems involves statistical methods that have been used since many decades to
perform signal processing In practice these methods rely on the minimization of a quadratic criterion
that we will express below The estimator used to minimize this criterion can be interpreted in a
Bayesian framework The Bayesian inference process in which observations are used to infer the
probability that an hypothesis is true is based on the Bayes theorem We denote z the measured data
and C a variable that gathers the model of data acquisition and the parameters a priori The Bayes
law is expressed as
f xz C 
f zx C f xC
The terms of the Bayes theorem are the following f zx C is the likelihood ie the probability
distribution of the data if we know the physical quantity x This probability gathers all the information
about our knowledge on the data acquisition system and can be determined by solving the direct
the knowledge about
problem sect 1152 In Eq B3 f xC is the prior probability of x ie
x before doing the measurements It is the prior in the sense that it does not take into account any
infomation about z The Bayes formula gives f xz C the conditional probability of x given z
it represents all the information we have on the problem It is also called the posterior probability
because it is derived from the specied value of z f zC is the prior probability of z and acts as a
normalizing constant This constant is chosen as to make the integral of the function f xz C equal
to 1 so that it is indeed a probability density function Intuitively the Bayes theorem in this form
describes the way in which ones knowledge about observing the HR data x is updated by having
observed the LR data z
B3 Least-square criterion and minimization technique
The estimate of the value x is given by the argument of the maximum of the posterior probability
function often called posterior maximum likelihood
xML  arg maxf xy C
The noise n is assumed to be Gaussian independent and uniform over the whole image Therefore
we use a gaussian likelihood
Therefore we obtain the least-squares estimator

B3 Least-square criterion and minimization technique
 is the regularization parameter The last equation denes the regularized least-square estimator
where D is the nite differences operator Laplacian D has a size N  1  N and can be written
The least-square criterion QLS to minimize in Eq B10 is quadratic and can be re-written as
QLSx  y  Hxty  Hx  xtDtDx
The solution is explicit
xML  H tH  DtD
The main issue with this explicit solution is that the size of the matrix H tH can be large and its
inversion can be very time-consuming Since the criterion to minimize is quadratic it is convex and
has a unique minimizor We use a method called gradient descent or steepest descent which
consists in starting from whatever value for x and then converge to the solution in the direction of the
steepest slope opposite of the gradients direction At each step this algorithm ensures that after a
sufcient number of iterations we will approach the required minimum value of the criterion Thus
we calculate the gradient of the criterion to minimize
 2 H tHx  z  2DtDx
and we update the solution with the following equation
xk1  xk  optH tHxk  y  DtDxk 
where opt is the optimal step to ensure the most efcient descent is the opposite direction of the
gradient This step is calculated by cancelling the gradient with respect to  In our case we use
a variant of the gradient descent so-called conjugate gradient descent which consists in having
orthogonal directions at each descent steps

One of the most surprising results obtained with the Spitzer space telescope was the discovery
of powerful mid-IR H2 line emission from a signicant number of sources that are in active
phases of galaxy evolution The underlying physics may be a key ingredient to describe the
build-up of baryonic mass in galaxies and their evolution We focus here on the interpretation
of observations of interactingmerging systems and AGN host galaxies They provide insights
on the exchange of mass between galaxies and the intergalactic medium and the energetics
of galaxy formation The Stephans Quintet SQ a compact group of interacting galaxies
is a striking example showing that dust survives in a high-speed galaxy collision and that H2
forms in the halo of the group This is also true for galactic winds driven by AGN feedback or
starbursts In SQ and in H2-luminous galaxies in general we propose that the H2 emission is
powered by the dissipation of the mechanical energy provided by galaxy merging or feedback
Shocks driven into multiphase gas lead to efcient dissipation of this energy at small scales
within molecular gas

 Talk PNG Session H2 energetics in Galaxy-wide Shocks Insights on starburst trigger-
ing in galaxy collisions P Guillard F Boulanger G Pineau des Forts PN Appleton P
How the gas cools and fuels galaxy formation and what processes regulate star formation in
galaxies are some major questions of extragalactic astronomy We focus on galaxy collisions
and mergers which are observed to trigger IR-luminous bursts of star formation Recently
E The show must go on
Spitzer observations show that some interacting systems stand out for having a high H2 to IR
luminosity ratio We propose that these systems represent an intermediate phase in the evolution
of mergers prior to the starburst Observations and modeling contribute to dene a physical
framework of the mechanical energy dissipation in this H2-luminous stage The H2 excitation
show that highly-turbulent 10  50 kms molecular gas is formed within hot gas The cloud
turbulence is powered by a slow energy and momentum transfer from the gas bulk motion We
propose that the timescale to dissipate the collision kinetic energy represents the time necessary
for the molecular gas to settle in gravitationally bound clouds and therefore to form stars
 Poster PCMI Session H2 Formation and Excitation in the Stephans Quintet Galaxy-
Wide Shock P Guillard F Boulanger G Pineau des Forts PN Appleton
Spitzer has detected an extremely powerful L  1041 erg s1 shock-powered mid-IR H2
emission towards the Stephans Quintet SQ galaxy group Appleton et al 06 This is the rst
time an almost pure H2 line spectrum has been seen in an extragalactic object The luminosity
in the H2 lines exceeds by a factor of  2 the surface brightness in X-rays How can we explain
such a huge amount of molecular gas MH2  4  107 Mcid12 coexisting with a X-ray emitting
plasma How come there is no star formation associated with H2 We summarize in this poster
the main results of a scenario P Guillard et al 08 where the molecular gas is formed in the
shock The pre-shock gas is assumed to be inhomogeneous because the shock has induced
formation of both hot 5  106 K plasma and warm 1023 K H2 Our model P Guillard
et al 2008 computes the physical and chemical evolution of the shock heated gas including
density inhomogeneities in the pre-shock medium and dust destruction Schematically low
density preshock gas nH  001  0001 cm3 is shocked at high speed  1000 kms for
SQ and becomes a dust-free X-ray emitting plasma Denser gas nH  01 cm3 is heated
at lower temperatures and dust survives
In the context of the SQ shock this gas had time
to cool and become molecular Only a fraction of the collision energy is used to heat the hot
plasma Therefore a large fraction of the gas energy is stored in bulk gas motions We propose
that in such conditions the H2 emission must be powered by a slow transfer of energy from
fast bulk gas motions into low velocity  40 kms supersonic turbulent motions within the
molecular gas We phenomenologically model this turbulent motions by J-type and magnetic
C-type shocks into the newly-formed molecular gas We show that the observed H2 line uxes
are very well reproduced for densities nH  103  104 cm3 and shock velocities within the
5  35 kms range SQ is a unique object for studying the physics of galaxy-wide shocks and
understanding their key-role in the formation and excitation of H2 This detailed study of the SQ
shock denes a physical framework to interpret observations of H2-bright galaxies in general

 The Stephans Quintet a beautiful case of H2 formation in shocks
Recently Spitzer IRS Infra-Red Spectrometer observations led to the unexpected detection
of extremely bright mid-IR L  1041 erg s1 H2 rotational line emission Appleton et al
2006 from warm gas towards the group-wide shock in Stephans Quintet hereafter SQ This
E2 Seminars
rst result was quickly followed by the detection of bright H2 line emission from more distant
galaxies Egami et al 2006 Ogle et al 2007 and from the NGC 1275 and NGC 4696 cooling
ows Johnstone et al 2007
Because of the absence or relative weakness of star forming signatures dust features ionized
gas lines in the mid-infrared Spitzer spectra the H2 emission must be powered by large-scale
shocks associated with galaxy interactions but also possibly with gas infall and AGN feedback
But how can we explain such a huge amount of molecular gas coexisting with a hot plasma at
5  106 K  How come there is no or very few star formation associated with H2
I will focus this talk on SQ a group of four interacting galaxies The shock is created by the
galaxy NGC 7318b which is colliding with a tidal stream at a relative velocity of  1 000 kms
SQ is then a unique object where one can study the physics of galactic wide shocks I will
present the results of a model capable of interpreting the observations Two key-points of
our calculations of the physical and chemical evolution of the shock-heated dusty plasma will
be emphasized dust destruction and the inhomogeneity of the galaxy and intragroup gas
Schematically low density nH  01 cm3 gas is shocked at high speed It becomes the
X-ray emitting gas where dust is destroyed Higher density gas nH  1 cm3 is heated to
lower temperatures and the dust survives In the context of the SQ shock this gas had time to
cool and become molecular
In the near future this model will be extended to more distant objects belonging to this newly
discovered and potentially important population of H2-bright galaxies In particular these H2
mid-IR lines appear to be a powerful diagnostic of unexplored steps in galaxy evolution

 Talk PCMI Session Noble Gas Implantation into SiC Stardust Constraints on Astro-
physical Processes P Guillard A Jones AGGM Tielens
Primitive meteorites contain presolar grains that originated in stellar outows and supernovae
ejecta prior to the formation of the solar system We show that the measured elemental abun-
dances of noble gas atoms trapped into meteoritic SiC grains can be understood in terms of
ion irradiation and erosion in circumstellar and interstellar media A simple atom implantation
and grain erosion model has been developed that allows us to provide new insights on dust
processing and on the physical conditions that reign in these environments

 H2 Formation and Excitation in Galaxy-wide Shocks
Spitzer space telescope observations led to the surprising detection of a diverse set of extra-
galactic sources whose infrared spectra are dominated by line emission of molecular hydrogen
The absence or relative weakness of typical signs of star formation like dust features or lines
of ionized gas suggest the presence of large quantities of molecular gas with no or very little
associated star formation These observations set a new light on the contribution of H2 to the
cooling of the interstellar medium on the relation between molecular gas and star formation
and on the energetics of galaxy formation
I will focus on the striking example of the galaxy-wide shock in Stephans Quintet where a
galaxy is colliding with a tidal tail at a relative velocity of 1000 kms Observations show that
exceptionally turbulent H2 gas is coexisting with a hot X-ray emitting plasma The extreme
mid-IR H2 emission from the shock exceeds that of the X-rays I will present the observations
and show how they can be interpreted by considering that the shock is moving through an
inhomogeneous medium Observations suggest that most of the shock energy is transferred
to bulk kinetic energy of the H2 gas The turbulent energy of the post-shock gas drives a
mass cycle across the different gas phases where H2 is forming out of the hotwarm gas This
interpretation puts the H2 emission into a broader astrophysical context including optical and
X-ray observations
We propose that the turbulence in the clouds is powered by a slow energy and momentum
transfer from the bulk motion of the gas and that the dissipation of this turbulent energy in turn
is powering the H2 emission The timescale to dissipate the kinetic energy from the collision
may set the relaxation time for the molecular gas to settle in gravitationally bound clouds and
ultimately to form stars
Our detailed study of Stephans Quintet represents an important step in dening a physical
framework to describe the dissipation of mechanical energy in H2-luminous galaxies I will
discuss the relevance of H2 formation for the energetics of key processes that participate in
galaxy formation galaxy interactions gas accretion and AGN feedback
