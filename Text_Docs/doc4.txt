1 Introduction
This paper investigates the link between some population dynamics models and a
class of Hawkes processes We are interested in processes whose behavior is modied
by past events which are self-excited and externally excited The introduction of a
self-excited process with shot noise intensity is due to Hawkes 1971 and the famous
Hawkes process has been used until now for a variety of applications including
seismology neuroscience epidemiology insurance and nance to name but a few
The shot noise intensity of the Hawkes process Nt is expressed as

where the Tn are the times of jump of the Hawkes process N itself   0 and  is
a non-negative function In the Hawkes model when an event occurs at time Tn
the intensity grows by an amount t  Tn this models the self-exciting property
Also for many modeling purposes  returns to zero as t increases so that the self-
excitation vanishes after a long time On the whole each event excites the system as
it increases its intensity but this increase vanishes with time as it is natural to model
the fact that very old events have a negligible impact on the current behavior of the
process In the literature more recent contributions focused on processes with self-
exciting behavior and also some externally exciting component To our knowledge
the Hawkes process with general immigrants has been introduced in Brmaud and
Massouli 2002 and specic forms can also be found in recent studies motivated
by nancial applications such as Dassios and Zhao 2011 Wheatley et al 2014
and Rambaldi et al 2014 where external shocks news arrivals and contagion are
crucial to model In this paper we are interested in a class of Hawkes processes
with general immigrants see Brmaud and Massouli 2002 whose intensity is of
the form

t  t 
tt  Tn Xn 
tt  Sk Yk
In this model the Tn are the times of jump of N if an event occurs for the system
at time Tn the intensity grows by an amount tt  Tn Xn where Xn is some
mark This part models the self-exciting property In parallel external events occur
at times Sk and excites the system of interest with some amount tt Sk Yk this
is the externally excited component
Among the appealing properties of such models one of them comes from the shot-
noise form of the intensity This is called the cluster or branching representation
of the Hawkes process and it is based on the following remark if an event occured
at time Tn then t  Tn is nothing but the age of this event at time t Few
years later after the seminal work of Hawkes 1971 Hawkes and Oakes 1974
proposed the cluster representation of the self-exciting process They interpreted it
as an immigration-birth process with age they proved that under some stationarity
conditions it can be described as a branching Poisson process also called Poisson
cluster Also in Dassios and Zhao 2011 a denition of a dynamic contagion
process is given through its cluster representation Until now most studies on the
Hawkes process recalled the immigration-birth representation as follows immigrants
arrive at times given by a Poisson process with intensity  Then each immigrant
starts a new generation
it gives birth to new individuals with fertility function
 each one giving birth with same fertility function  This is often used as a
denition for the Hawkes process providing a good intuition on its behavior The
cluster representation of Hawkes and Oakes 1974 requires that the mean number
0 ada satises cid107cid107  1
of children per individual which is nothing but cid107cid107 cid82 
In our paper we exhibit the underlying immigration-birth dynamics which does not
require the stationary assumption Each individual in the population has an age
and a characteristic The virtue if this approach that combines an intensity process
denition and a branching representation is that the population age pyramid keeps
track of all past events This is used to compute new distribution properties for a
class of linear Hawkes process with general immigrants
In the literature the distribution properties of the Hawkes process have rst
been studied under stationary conditions Hawkes 1971 addressed second order
stationary properties whereas Adamopoulos 1975 derived the probability gener-
ating functional under stationarity by using the cluster representation of Hawkes
and Oakes 1974 In this work Adamopoulos 1975 expressed the probability gen-
erating function as a solution to some functional equation Furthermore Brmaud
and Massouli 2002 introduced the framework for studying moments of the sta-
tionary Hawkes process by means of the Bartlett spectrum Let us also mention
two recent studies of the distribution properties under stationarity The moment
generating function has been expressed in Saichev and Sornette 2011 as a solu-
tion to some transcendental equation In addition Jovanovi et al 2014 proposed
a graphical way to derive closed form expressions for cumulant densities leading
to the moments of the stationary Hawkes process
It is interesting to note that
such recent contributions rely the stationary branching representation of Hawkes
and Oakes 1974 Recently the computation of statistical properties has gained
attention under non-stationarity both for mathematical analysis and statistical es-
timation techniques However the recent studies in this framework only focus on
exponential fertility rates t  et The tool they rely on is the innitesimal gen-
erator of the intensity process t which is Markovian for such exponential fertility
rate see Oakes 1975 This includes the work of Errais et al 2010 At-Sahalia
et al 2010 Dassios and Zhao 2011 and Da Fonseca and Zaatour 2014 Our
paper generalizes these studies in a natural direction for a wider class of Hawkes
processes
Scope of this paper The aim of this paper is i
to introduce the concept of
age pyramid for general Hawkes processes and study its dynamics over time ii
to use this concept to compute new distribution properties for a class of fertility
functions which generalize the popular exponential case and iii to give a pathwise
representation of the general Hawkes processes and its underlying immigration-birth
dynamics We represent the population as a multi-type dynamics with ages includ-
ing immigration and births with mutations Our population point of view that
introduces the concept of age pyramid is inspired by Bensusan et al 20102015
see also Tran 2008 As highlighted in Bensusan et al 20102015 the key idea
is that the population structure in terms of ages and characteristics which keeps
track of past events provides much more information than the intensity itself and
allows to study the whole system In this way we address the computation of dis-
tribution properties of the Hawkes process with general immigrants for a wide class
of time-dependent fertility functions We also give the pathwise construction of the
age pyramid represented as a measure-valued process solution to a stochastic equa-
tion driven by a Poisson point measure which is the theoretical counterpart of the
thinning numerical procedure Our approach seems to reconcile the two denitions
of Hawkes processes through an intensity process or a branching dynamics
The paper is organized as follows Section 2 focuses on the standard Hawkes pro-
cess with time-independent fertility function On this particular case we give the
population point of view and study the dynamics of the age pyramid over time In
Section 3 we use this concept to compute new distribution properties as moments
and Laplace transform for a class of Hawkes processes which generalizes the popular
exponential case Section 4 details the pathwise contruction of the standard Hawkes
process and its underlying population Our general population representation and
results are given in Section 5 where we focus on Hawkes processes with general
immigrants In particular we derive its dynamics and Laplace transform for a wide
class of time-dependent fertility functions
2 Population point of view
The denition of the standard linear Hawkes process through its intensity is given
below Let A P be a probability space satisfying the usual conditions Recall
that the intensity process t of a counting process Nt is the F N
t -predictable
t  denotes
process such that Nt cid82 t
t - local martingale where F N
0 sds is an F N

with kernel  is a counting process with canonical ltration F N
t  which admits an
t -predictable intensity

t   
t  Tn   
t  sdNs
where   0 and the Tn are the times of jump of Nt
The previous denition provides the representation of the intensity process
which is interesting in order to study the behavior of the Hawkes process But
in fact the whole information on the dynamics is lost Indeed it is interesting to
go back to the branching representation of Hawkes and Oakes 1974 to have in
mind the underlying population dynamics First immigrants arrive according to
some Poisson process with parameter  Then each immigrant generates a cluster
of descendants with the following rule if an individual arrived or was born at some
time s it gives birth to new individuals with rate t  s at time t Note that in
fact ts is nothing but the age at time t of the individual born at time s The birth
mechanism can thus be reformulated as any individual with age a in the popula-
tion gives birth with rate a The whole dynamics describes an immigration-birth
process with age in which the immigration rate is  and the birth rate is a
Since the immigration-birth mechanism is crucial to understand the Hawkes
dynamics the aim now is to keep track of all ages in the population One way
to address this issue is to count the number of individuals with age below a  0
at time t denoted Zt0 a This can be computed as the number of individuals
arrived until time t without those arrived before t  a that is
Zt0 a  Nt  Nta 
1tsadNs
cid90
Ntcid88
The previous equation shows that with xed t this denes a measure on the space
R of ages that is an image of the jump measure dNt It can be written as
cid90
Ztda 
tsdadNs 
tTnda
Note that Ztda charges only 0 t since no individual born after time 0 can reach
an age greater than t Formally the measure Ztda puts a weight on the age of each
individual alive at time t therefore we call it age pyramid in reference to demographic
analysis In general demographic studies focus on the number of individuals per age
class of eg one year so the quantity of interest is eg Zta a  1 The virtue of
the measure representation is that one can compute a function f of the population
age structure by integrating it with respect to the age pyramid To do this we use
the notation
For example the Hawkes process can be computed as Nt  cid104Zt 1cid105 Also the
intensity process dened in Equation 1 can be rewritten using 3 as
f aZtda 
f t  sdNs

cid104Zt fcid105

t    cid104Zt cid105
The intensity is the sum of the migration intensity  and the individual birth inten-
sities this is indeed the intensity of an immigration-birth process with migration
rate  and birth rate a in which all individuals behave independently Viewed
as a stochastic process Ztdat0 is a measure-valued process In fact this age
pyramid process that is the measure-valued process Ztdat0 is a Markov process
see Tran 2006 Note however that its dierentiation in time is not straightfor-
ward see Bensusan et al 20102015 and Lemma 1 below The Markov property
of the age pyramid process shows that all the information needed is contained in the
population age structure Let us mention the seminal point of view of Harris 1963
for who it does seem intuitively plausible that we obtain a Markov process in an
extended sense if we describe the state of the population at time t not simply by
the number of objects present but by a list of the ages of all objects However in
practice this information is too large to perform tractable computations In the
next Section we illustrate how to identify some minimal components to add to the
Hawkes process in order to make the dynamics Markovian To do this we rst need
to address the time evolution of the age pyramid The following Lemma details the
dynamics of cid104Zt fcid105 in the case where f is dierentiable This is the key tool for our
results in Section 3

The decomposition 4 is classical in the eld of measure-valued population dy-
namics see Tran 2008 and Bensusan et al 20102015 The rst term refers to
the pure jump part of arrivals of individuals with age 0 whereas the second term of
transport type illustrates the aging phenomenon all ages are translated along the
time axis In particular this shows why the intensity process t    cid104Zt cid105 is
Markovian in the case where the fertility function is exponential see Oakes 1975
that is a  ea In this case cid48   and Equation 4 with f   leads to
the dierential form
dcid104Zt cid105  dNt  cid104Zt cid105dt
Note that dNt only depends on the past of t by means of the current value t
which proves the Markov property This remark is the starting point of our study
which extends the exponential case in a natural setting
3 The exponential case generalized
In this section the aim is to use the concept of age pyramid process introduced in
Section 2 in order to compute several distribution properties for the non-stationary
31 Assumption on the birth rate
Hawkes process In particular we provide ordinary dierential equations for rst and
second order moments and the Laplace transform All computations are performed
under some assumption on the birth rate  which naturally extends the popular
exponential case

there exists c  c1  cn1  Rn1 such that  statises

The birth rates that satisfy Assumption 1 include the exponential case but also
some fertility functions that are interesting for a variety of applications Let us
introduce the vector
m  1 m0  mn1T 
and the matrix C  Cij1ijn1 given by Cii1  1 for 0  i  n  2 and
Cn1j  cj for 1  j  n  1 all other components being zero Since it is fully
determined by the vector c we denote

written up to some constant ascid80p
Equation 5 can be rewritten cid48  C where   1   n1T  whose
solution is given by a  eaCm Then  can be recovered as the second component
k0 ckyk is split
with distinct roots y1  yp and corresponding multiplicity n1  np then  can be
i1 Piaeyia where Pi is a polynomial with degree
at most ni1 This is a suciently large set of functions to approximate any fertility
function outside of the range of Assumption 1 As an example the power law kernel
is of importance for many applications In the context of earthquakes the Omori law
describes the epidemic-type aftershock ETAS model it corresponds to a specic
form a  K

eg Hardiman et al 2013 found that high-frequency nancial activity is better
described by a Hawkes process with power law kernel rather than exponential The

power law kernel with cut o can be approximated as in Hardiman et al 2013 up
to a constant by the smooth function

where S is such that 0  0 In general one can use approximation theory to
construct a sequence of fertility functions which tends to the original one As a
result this constructs a sequence of Hawkes processes that approximate the original
Hawkes process
32 Dynamics
Let us go back to the dynamics of the age pyramid over time The key property
that will allow us to compute distribution properties is that the population enables
to identify the components to add to the Hawkes process and its intensity to make
the dynamics Markovian This is stated in the following proposition

with convention 1  1 This implies the dynamics 8 which also shows that X
is a Markov process cid5
The dynamics 8 for the n1-dimensional vector Xt gives a set of n equations
the rst component of X which is the Hawkes process N being free In Section 4 we
will give an equation on the Hawkes process N by means of stochastic representation
based on Poisson point measures This will provide a full system of equations for the
components of X as well as a pathwise representation For now we are interested
into deriving several distribution properties of the Hawkes process and its additional
components in X

4 Pathwise representation of Hawkes population
The aim of this Section is to detail the pathwise construction of the Hawkes process
and its underlying population This is done by means of stochastic dierential
equations driven by Poisson point measures The virtue of this approach is that it
seems to reconcile both the intensity process denition of the Hawkes process and its
branching representation We rst describe the construction of the Hawkes process
with reference to a Poisson measure then exhibit the system of equations driving the
generalized exponential case and nally address the pathwise population dynamics
for general birth rates
Construction of the Hawkes process One question which arises with Denition
1 refers to the construction of such process and the notion of pathwise uniqueness
An answer can be given by the thinning representation
which works as follows Consider a Poisson point measure Qds d with inten-
sity measure qds d  dsd on R  R see eg nlar 2011 for a denition
and denote F Q
t  the canonical ltration generated by Q Note that the intensity
measure q is not nite and only -nite which makes it impossible to order the points
in time of the Poisson point measure Q But this exible representation allows to rep-
resent a wide class of counting processes Let t be a F Q
t -predictable process such
0 sds   Then the following process Nt is a count-
ing process with F Q
10sQds d
Indeed N is clearly a counting process because each atom of Q is weighted 1 or 0
0 sds   the martingale property for Poisson point measures
t - local martingale
Now let us describe the construction of the Hawkes process Since the intensity in
1 is given as a particular form of the process itself the idea is to dene the Hawkes
process as the solution to the stochastic equation
that as for each t  0cid82 t
t -predictable intensity t Nt  cid82

ensures that Nt cid82 t

General results about existence and uniqueness for the Hawkes process even non-
linear can be found in Brmaud and Massouli 1996 and Massouli 1998 see
also Delattre et al 2014 and the books of Daley and Vere-Jones 2008 and nlar
2011 The thinning method to represent a counting process as the solution of
a stochastic equation is in fact classical This general mathematical representation
goes back to Kerstan 1964 and Grigelionis 1971 One often refers to the thinning
algorithms that have been proposed by Lewis and Shedler 1978 and Ogata 1981
which are very useful to perform numerical simulations for quite complex intensity
processes A rst advantage of the thinning formulation arises when one wants to
show the existence of the Hawkes process This is done by Picard iteration method
see Massouli 1998 one constructs a sequence N kk0 of counting processes
starting at N 0  0 and for k  0
10cid82
0s sudN k
u Qds d
cid90
cid90
One can show that the sequence N k is Cauchy and thus converges to the desired
process Moreover another advantage is to give strong uniqueness With this issue
it appears that the thinning representation has the virtue to use one noise once for
all and thus give pathwise construction and results This is interesting to note that
this approach is used by Delattre et al 2014 to show existence and uniqueness of an
innite graph of interacting Hawkes processes Due to the pathwise representation
and the iterative construction one can also identify each generation in the dynamics
Indeed one sees in the construction of the Cauchy sequence in 23 that N 1 counts
the number of immigrants whereas N 2  N 1 counts the children of immigrants
N 3  N 2 the grandchildren of immigrants and so on Generally N k1
the number of individuals in generation k born before time t This shows another
advantage of the pathwise construction what is called the thinning parameter
 gives additional information on the dynamics making it possible in particular
to study each generation separately Before giving the representation of the age
pyramid we rst go back to the extension of the exponential case
t  N k
Exponential case generalized We rst address the particular case where the
birth rate  satises Assumption 1 The dynamics of the n  1dimensional
vector Xt  Ntcid104Zt cid105 cid104Zt n1cid105T is given in 8 by dXt  dNtm  CXtdt
This gives in fact n equations the rst coordinate Nt being free The pathwise
representation 22 allows to derive the full system of equations by

where we recall the notation Xt  X 1

In the case where
Immigration-birth process with general fertility functions
the birth rate is general one has to represent the whole age pyramid that is to give
the thinning representation of the underlying immigration-birth process In the eld
of population dynamics this approach is used to construct extended birth-death pro-
cesses with age in particular in Bensusan et al 20102015 see also Fournier and
Mlard 2004 and Tran 2008 From Equations 3 and 22 we get the pathwise
representation

This illustrates the fact that the population at time t is nothing but all individuals
that arrived before time t immigration or birth if an individual arrived at time
s its age at time t is t  s Note that in this form the dierentiation is not
straightforward see Bensusan et al 20102015 But from Lemma 1 one can write
the following innite system of equations for each dierentiable f  R  R

This approach seems to reconcile the intensity process denition of the Hawkes
process with its branching representation Indeed the population age pyramid is
given through Equation 25 as a stochastic measure-valued process with its own
intensity Before going through the last Section on the Hawkes process with general
immigrants we briey discuss the existing cluster representation in the following
remark
Remark 1 We recall the denition of the Hawkes process in terms of a Poisson
cluster introduced in Hawkes and Oakes 1974 and surveyed in the book of Daley
and Vere-Jones 2003 Let Ncds be a Poisson point measure on R with intensity
measure ds this denes the cluster centers also called ancestors Let us introduce
a family of point processes  N dt  s s  R For each s N dt  s denes
the location of the osprings within the cluster of an ancestor located at s The
cluster process N counts the number of all osprings of all immigrants by N dt 
N dt  sNcds That is the number of all osprings up to time t is given by
cid82
cid90
N 0 t 
N 0 t  sNcds
Thus in the cluster representation the Hawkes process can be written as the sum of
the immigrants and their osprings by
Nc0 t  N 0 t
Note that the cluster representation has shown to facilitate the study of the
Hawkes process under stationarity by using results in the eld of branching pro-
cesses Our population representation seems to be the non-stationary counterpart
as it allows us to derive new distribution properties in this framework Our popula-
tion representation provides not only the size of the total progeny up to time t but
also a variety of quantities of interest depending on the population age structure
This has been used in Section 3 in order to identify the components needed to make
the dynamics Markovian This will be also used in the following Section to study a
class of Hawkes process with general immigrants
5 Towards more general Hawkes processes
In this Section we focus on a class of counting processes Nt named as Hawkes
processes with general immigrants see Brmaud and Massouli 2002 which is
dened below
Denition 2 A Hawkes process with general immigrants is a counting process Nt
whose intensity is given by
t  t 
tt  Tn Xn 
tt  Sk Yk
cid88
cid88
51 Description of the two-population dynamics
where the Tn are the times of jump of N the Sk are the jumps of a counting process
with deterministic intensity t and the Xn resp Yk are real positive iid with
distribution G resp H The Sk Yk and Xn are assumed to be independent
of each other
In this model the Tn are the times of jump of Nt
if an event occurs for the
system at time Tn the intensity grows by an amount tt  Tn Xn where Xn
is some mark This part models the self-exciting property
In parallel external
events occur at times Sk and excites the system of interest with some amount
tt  Sk Yk this is the externally excited component The standard Hawkes
process that have been studied in the previous Sections can be recovered by setting
ta x  a and ta x  0 The Hawkes process with general immigrants
has been introduced and studied under stationary conditions by Brmaud and Mas-
souli 2002 Due to their exibility and natural interpretation such models have
gained recent attention for nancial applications eg by Dassios and Zhao 2011
Wheatley et al 2014 and Rambaldi et al 2014 In particular distribution prop-
erties of such process have been investigated by Dassios and Zhao 2011 in the case
ta x  ta x  xea in which framework the intensity process is Markovian
The aim of this Section is to study the dynamics and characterize the distribution
of the non-stationary Hawkes process with general immigrants for a larger class
of fertility functions possibly time-dependent which extends the previous work of
Dassios and Zhao 2011 in this direction To do this we represent a two-population
immigration-birth dynamics with ages and characteristics
51 Description of the two-population dynamics
The aim is to construct populations of several individuals or particles each one
having an age a evolving over time and a characteristic x  R We construct
two populations the rst one represents external shocks whereas the second one
represents events for the Hawkes process
Each population i i  1 or 2 is represented at time t as a measure which puts a
weight on the age and characteristic of each individual denoted Z i
t da dx The
two populations are introduced based on Denition 2 as
cid88
cid88
da dx 
tSkYkda dx and Z 2
da dx 
tTnXnda dx
Since ages but also characteristics of individuals are involved we prefer to call Z i
population structure rather than age pyramid which is more specic As for the
standard Hawkes population representation one can compute functions of the whole
population structure which can even depend on time Consider a function fta x

This shows that the underlying population dynamics works as follows
i Let us rst describe the population 1 of external shocks
It is made with
immigrants that arrive in population 1 with rate t at arrival they have age 0
and some characteristic x drawn with distribution H Any individual a x at time
t that belongs to population 1 gives birth with rate ta x The newborn belongs
to population 2 it has age 0 and some characteristic drawn with distribution G
ii Let us now complete the description of population 2 In addition to births
from population 1 the population 2 evolves according to two other kind of events
immigration and internal birth Immigrants arrive in population 2 with rate t
with age 0 and a characteristic drawn with distribution G Any individual a x at
time t that belongs to population 2 gives birth with rate ta x The newborn
also belongs to population 2 it has age 0 and some characteristic drawn with
distribution G This dynamics is illustrated in Figure 1
As for our analysis of the standard Hawkes process a crucial step is to study the
dynamics of the population structure over time That is what is the dynamics of
the process cid104Z i

cid80
As for the standard Hawkes process it is possible to give a pathwise representation
of the Hawkes process with general immigrants and its underlying population To
do this let us rst extend the thinning construction in Section 4 to point processes
with marks Poisson point measures can be used not only to represent counting
processes but also general random point measures on R  E say ds dy 
n1 TnYnds dy where EE is some measurable space As for the Hawkes
process Tn is seen as the time at which an individual arrives in the population
immigration or birth In addition E represents the space of characteristics and
the mark Yn refers to the characteristic inherited by the individual that arrived at
time Tn Let us construct a random point measure ds dy with general intensity
this model events occur with intensity s cid55cid82
measure ds dy assuming that it admits a density ds dy  s y ds dy In
xE s xdx and if a birth occurs
at time Tn then the characteristics Yn of the newborn are drawn with distribution

Let Qds dy d be a Poisson point measure on RER with intensity measure

t  the canonical ltration generated by Q and
cid82
introduce P F Q

that t y is P F Q

This clearly denes a point measure and the martingale property for Q ensures that
the random point measure ds dy has intensity measure s ydsdy Such
construction can be found in Massouli 1998 we refer to this paper for more
details
We are now ready to construct the two point measures N 1 and N 2 given in
Equation 29 Let us introduce two independent Poisson point measures Q1dt dx d
and Q2dt dx d on the probability space F P enlarged if necessary with
same intensity measure dsdxd on R  R  R The rst point measure is im-
mediate to construct since its intensity does not depend on it
Indeed one can
dene
N 1dt dx 
10tHxQ1dt dx d
We emphasize that this is not an equation on N 1 since its intensity does not depend
on N 1 itself As for the second point process related to the Hawkes process the
intensity is given as a particular for of the process itself
Indeed the intensity
measure of the point measure N 2dt dx is given by tGx where t can be written

Such representations are used in the eld of stochastic population dynamics for
populations with ages andor characteristics see in particular Fournier and Mlard
2004 Tran 2008 and Bensusan et al 20102015 As for the standard Hawkes
process the pathwise representation has many advantages In particular it allows
to derive the full system of equations and to identify each generation see Section
4 More importantly this formulation makes the link between the Hawkes process
literature and the eld of stochastic population dynamics To further investigate
this link seems to be a promising direction for future research
Conclusion
We introduced the concept of age pyramid for a class of Hawkes processes with
general immigrants The virtue of this approach is to keep track of all past events
This allows tractable computations for the Hawkes process with general immigrants
whose fertility functions are time dependent generalizations of the popular expo-
nential case providing natural extensions of the existing results in this direction
In addition we illustrated the pathwise construction of the Hawkes dynamics and
its underlying population process On the whole our approach seems to reconcile
two denitions of Hawkes processes through an intensity process or a branching
dynamics This framework appears to be a promising direction for further research
As an example the large population asymptotics in the eld of measure-valued pop-
ulation dynamics could give further insights on the macroscopic behavior of Hawkes
processes

where the second equality comes from 52 Let us set A0T   2 and for 1  k 
n 1 AkT   0 One can show by 51 that the previous conditions are equivalent
to the terminal values GnT   1n12 and for 1  k  n  1 GkT   0
Note that by denition of G we also get GT   0 We thus get
