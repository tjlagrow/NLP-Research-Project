The diversity of T-cell receptors recognizing foreign pathogens is generated through a highly
stochastic recombination process making the independent production of the same sequence rare
Yet unrelated individuals do share receptors which together constitute a public repertoire of
abundant clonotypes The TCR repertoire is initially formed prenatally when the enzyme inserting
random nucleotides is downregulated producing a limited diversity subset By statistically analyzing
deep sequencing T-cell repertoire data from twins unrelated individuals of various ages and cord
blood we show that T-cell clones generated before birth persist and maintain high abundances in
adult organisms for decades slowly decaying with age Our results suggest that large low-diversity
public clones are created during pregnancy and survive over long periods providing the basis of the
public repertoire
The adaptive immune system relies on the diversity
of T-cell receptor TCR repertoires to protect us from
many possible pathogenic threats This diversity is pro-
duced by a VDJ recombination machinery that assem-
bles the repertoire de novo in each individual adding a
large degree of randomness to combinations of genomic
templates The diversity is encoded not only in the set
of specic receptors expressed in a given individual but
also in their relative abundances the size of T-cell clones
expressing each of them which can dier by orders of
magnitude These dierences are partially attributed to
antigenic stimulation infection vaccination implying
that clones increase their sizes in response to common or
recurring infections Despite this great diversity dierent
individualsregardless of their degree of relatednessdo
express a subset of the exact same receptors called the
public repertoire 1 This overlap is often interpreted as
the convergence of individual repertoire evolutions in re-
sponse to common antigenic challenges 2 Accordingly
some public TCRs are known to respond for common
pathogens such as the cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr
virus 3 However this interpretation is challenged by
the observation that these two propertieslarge dier-
ences in clone sizes and public repertoiresare also ob-
served in naive repertoires for which antigenic stimula-
tion is not expected to be important 4 5
An alternative explanation for public clones which
does not invoke convergent repertoire evolution is that
both abundant and public receptors are more likely to
be produced by rearrangement and just occur by coin-
cidence 1 6 This idea is backed by some compelling
evidence First the extent of sharing of clonotypes be-
tween pairs of individuals can be accurately predicted in
both naive and memory pools from statistical models of
sequence generation 7 Second the likelihood that a
clonotype sequence is shared by individuals has been re-
ported to correlate with its abundance 6 8 However
the origin of this correlation remains elusive In addition
public clonotypes often have few or no randomly inserted
N nucleotides which limits their diversity Terminal de-
oxynucleotidyl transferase TdT the enzyme responsi-
ble for random nucleotide insertions is not active in in-
variant T-cell subsets 9 and in some fetal T-cell clones
and these subsets could contribute to the emergence of
the public repertoire Another confounding factor is the
ageing of repertoires and the concomitant loss of diver-
sity which is expected to aect the structure of clonal
abundances as well as the repertoires sharing properties
How do all these eects shape the structure and diversity
of TCR repertoires and control their functional capabil-
ities Here we propose and test the hypothesis that a
sizeable fraction of public clonotypes are created before
birth These clonotypes have low diversity because of
reduced TdT activity making them more likely to be
shared among unrelated invididuals Their large abun-
dances due to reduced homeostatic pressures in the early
stages of repertoire development allows them to survive
over long periods
We rst examined in detail the question of clonotype
sharing between individuals To avoid confounding ef-
fects due to convergent selection we rst focused on out-
of-frame receptor sequences resulting from unsuccessful
recombination events which give us direct insight into
the raw VDJ recombination process 10 11 free of
clonal selection eects The number of shared clonotypes
between two clonesets is approximately proportional to
the product of the cloneset sizes 8 11 12 We call the
ratio of the two the normalized sharing number Under
the assumption that sharing occurs by pure chance this
number can be predicted using data-driven generative
probabilistic models of VDJ recombination accounting
for the frequencies of the assembled V D and J gene
segments and the probabilities of insertions and deletions
between them 7 11 13 We can estimate sharing either
of the entire nucleotide chain alpha or beta or of a
restricted portion of it called the Complementarity De-
termining Region 3 CDR3 which concentrates most
of the chains diversity and determines antigen speci-
city Genetically identical individuals may be expected
to have more similar recombination statistics 8 14 15
and therefore share more sequences To assess these ge-
netic eects we looked at the sharing of TCR alpha
and beta-chain receptor repertoires between three pairs
of monozygous twins We synthesized cDNA libraries of
TCR alpha and beta chains from the donors peripheral
blood mononuclear cells and sequenced them on the Illu-
mina HiSeq platform see Fig S1 and SI Text For each
pair of individuals the normalized number of shared out-
of-frame alpha sequences was compared to the prediction
from the recombination model as shown in Fig 1 see
also Figs S2 for similar results on sharing of CDR3 se-
quences Sharing in unrelated individuals black circles
was well predicted by the model Pearsons R  0976
up to a constant multiplicative factor of 207 probably
due to dierences in eective cloneset sizes While twins
did share more sequences than unrelated individuals red
circles this excess could not be explained by their re-
combination process being more similar The model pre-
diction was obtained by generating sequences from mod-
els inferred using each individuals cloneset as input 13
mirroring their specic recombination statistics see SI
Materials and methods The normalized sharing number
departed signicantly from the model prediction only in
twins calling for another explanation than coincidence in
that case The same result was obtained for beta out-of-
frame CDR3 sequences Fig S3 although less markedly
because of a lower signal-to-noise ratio due to smaller
numbers of shared sequences Most of beta out-of-frame
sequences shared among the highest-sharing twin pair as-
sociated with CD8 CD45RO memory phenotype in
both individuals This observation is surprising because
the non-functionality of these sequences excludes conver-
gent selection as an explanation for it see SI for details
We then examined the sharing of in-frame CDR3 se-
quences Most of in-frame sequences are functional and
have passed thymic and peripheral selection Since these
selection steps involve HLA types and are therefore ex-
pected to be similar in related individuals we wondered
whether the functional repertoires of twins also displayed
excess sharing Remarkably we found some excess shar-
ing in the in-frame beta repertoire Fig S4 but none
in the in-frame alpha reperoire Fig S5 However the
failure to observe excess sharing in this last case can be
explained by the much higher expected number of shared
sequences in the alpha in-frame repertoire due to both
in-frame sequences being more numerous than out-of-
frame ones and to the lower diversity of alpha chains
compared to beta chains which could mask this excess
in twins see SI Text
To investigate the origin of excess sharing between
twins we looked at the statistical properties of shared
alpha out-of-frame sequences from Fig 1 Shared clono-
types between non-twins which happen by coincidence
should have a higher probability Pgen to have been pro-
duced by VDJ rearrangement compared to non-shared
clonotypes
Indeed the distribution of Pgen among
shared sequences can be calculated from the probabilistic
model of generation Fig 2 blue curve and the predic-
tion agrees very well with the data between non-twins
red curves By contrast shared sequences between
twins deviate from the prediction green curve espe-
cially in the tail of low-probability sequences but are
consistent with a mixture of 18 3 of regular sequences
black curve and the rest of coincidentally shared se-
quences blue curve These numbers agree well with the
excess sharing in twins which amounts to 17  3 of
non-coincidentally shared sequences as estimated from
Fig 1 Sequences shared between twins also have higher
numbers of insertions and are therefore longer than those
shared between unrelated individuals or according to the
model Fig S6  a trend that is even more pronounced
in memory cells Fig S7 Note these observations about
recombination probabilities and number of insertions are
related sequences with many insertions each have a low
generation probability because of the multiplicity of in-
serted nucleotides
Taken together these observations support the exis-
tence of another source of shared sequences than coin-
cidence in twins Since the sharing of cord blood be-
tween twins is the only natural instance when the im-
mune systems of two individuals share cells we propose
that the increased sharing of private TCRs between iden-
tical twins dates back to the sharing of cord blood cells
and that these shared clones persist into late age
FIG 1 TCR out-of-frame repertoire sharing in
monozygous twins is higher than in unrelated indi-
viduals or than predicted by stochastic models of
recombination The number of shared out-of-frame alpha
TCR clonotypes between all 15 pairs among 6 donors con-
sisting of 3 twin pairs ordinate is compared to the model
prediction abscissa To be able to compare pairs of datasets
of dierent sizes the sharing number was normalized by the
product of the cloneset sizes The three outstanding red cir-
cles represent the twin pairs while the black circles refer to
pairs of unrelated individuals The model prediction is based
on a generative stochastic model of VJ recombination 13
inferred separately for each donor to account for dierences
between individuals It agrees well with the data from unre-
lated individuals up to a common multiplicative factor but
systematically underestimates sharing in twins Error bars
show one standard deviation
To verify this hypothesis we characterized the in-frame
beta-chain repertoire of human cord blood see SI Ma-
terials and methods One feature of the rearranged
chains is the number of insertions at the junctions be-
tween the gene segments VD and DJ in the case of beta
chains We ranked beta TCR clonotypes from human
cord blood data by decreasing abundances and plotted
the mean number of insertions inferred iteratively and
averaged over groups of 3000 clonotypes see SI Meth-
ods as a function of this abundance rank Fig 3A The
most abundant clones in cord blood had markedly smaller
numbers of insertions black line The naive repertoire
of a young adult blue line showed a much weaker de-
pendence on abundance than the cord blood repertoire
but followed a similar trend The dependence was even
further reduced in older adults purple and green lines

FIG 2 TCR sequences shared between twins are sta-
tistically dierent from sequences shared between un-
related individuals Distribution of log10 Pgen with Pgen
the probability that a sequence is generated by the VJ recom-
bination process for shared out-of-frame TCR alpha clono-
types between one individual and the other ve While the
distribution of shared sequences between unrelated individu-
als red curves is well explained by coincidental convergent
recombination as predicted by our stochastic model blue
sequences shared between two twins green have an excess of
low probability sequences For comparison the distribution of
Pgen in regular not necessarily shared sequences is shown in
lines did not depend of the abundance of these cells
This observation can be explained by the resetting of
the size of memory clones following an infection erasing
features of the abundance distribution inherited from fe-
tal life Looking more closely into the distribution of
the number of insertions Fig 3B reveals that low mean
numbers of insertions are associated with an enrichment
in clonotypes with zero insertions Accordingly the frac-
tion of naive zero-insertion sequences generally decreased
with abundance rank Fig 3C with again a stronger de-
pendency in cord blood and young adults Fewer num-
bers of insertions in the cord blood are expected because
TdT the enzyme responsible for random insertions is
initially strongly downregulated in prenatal development
16 This enrichment in low-insertion sequences persists
and shows weak signatures in the adult naive repertoire
suggesting long lifetimes of cord blood clonotypes al-
though not necessarily of individual cells
The enrichment of zero-insertion sequences in large
clonotypes can be used to verify the hypothesis of long
lived fetal clonotypes originating from the cord blood

sequences the probability of having zero insertions is high both for adult naive and cord blood samples For middle-ranking
sequences the probability of 0 insertions is much lower and distributions are similar for adult naive and cord-blood samples
C Fraction of clonotypes with zero insertions for dierent abundance classes Error bars show one standard deviation
dierent ages 17 we observed a slow decay of abundant
zero-insertion clonotypes with age with a characteristic
time of 37 years Fig 4 However the excess of abun-
dant TdT- clonotypes of fetal origin only aects naive
cells Figs 3 and S10 whose relative fraction is also
known to decrease with time 17 To assess the impor-
tance of this confounding eect we t an exponential
decay model for the percentage of naive cells and found
a characteristic decay time of 67 years Therefore the
attrition of the naive pool alone cannot explain the de-
crease of zero-insertion clonotypes which we attribute
instead to the progressive extinction of clones of fetal
origin consistently with our hypothesis
Fetal clones are directly exchanged between twins
through cord blood and then persist with age explaining
the enhanced sharing between them At the same time
TdT- zero-insertion clonotypes are also most likely to be
shared by chance than regular TdT sequences because
of their fewer number of insertions and reduced diversity
What are the implications of this observation for sharing
between non-twins Since zero-insertion sequences are
overrepresented among abundant clonotypes Fig 3 we
predict that abundant out-of-frame clones are more likely
to be shared To make our prediction quantitative we
built a mixture model of the out-of-frame alpha reper-
toire see SI Text for details We assumed that clono-
types of a given abundance C are made up of a certain
fraction F C of TdT- zero-insertion clonotypes and a
complementary fraction 1F C of regular TdT clono-
types Because TdT clonotypes may also have no inser-
tions the fraction of the TdT and TdT- sets had to be
learned in a self-consistent manner Sequences were gen-
erated by the model for each abundance class C and their
sharing compared to the data The model accurately
predicts the normalized sharing number of out-of-frame
alpha-chain CDR3s as a function of clonotype abundance
Fig 5 up to the common multiplicative factor of 17 by
which the non-mixture model generally underestimates
CDR3 sharing see Fig S2 Thus the enhanced shar-
ing of high-abundance clonotypes is entirely attributable
to their higher propensity to have no insertions making
them more likely to be shared by chance
Our results on the biological contamination of T cells in
twins are robust to possible experimental artefacts First
our framework relies on the accurate counting of TCR
cDNA sequences using unique molecule identiers18
To exclude the possibility of contamination during the
PCR and sequencing process we double barcoded each
cDNA library To further exclude the possibility of early
contamination of the blood samples we performed repli-
cate experiments at dierent times using dierent library
preparation protocols Comparison of repertoire over-
laps from such replicate experiments for the same set of
twins shows no dierence and rules out experimental con-
tamination as a confounding eect see SI We also ob-
served the same eects in previously and independently
collected datasets 8 further excluding the possibility of
experimental artefacts Fig S8

zero-insertion clonotypes of fetal origin
Cord blood sharing between twin embryos could have
important implications on twin immunity they could
share and respond with private clonotypes which would
otherwise not be likely to be produced independently
This could possibly include sharing of malignant 1921
or autoimmune clones leading to disease in both indi-
viduals This mechanism of sequence sharing is very dif-
ferent from sharing by convergent recombination 6 be-
cause it also implies the sharing of the second TCR chain
and of the cell phenotype Paired repertoires studies
which combine alpha and beta chains together 22 23
could be used to track clones shared between twins more
precisely and distinguish them from convergently recom-
bined ones
We conclude that fetal clonotypes are long-lived based
on the analysis of over-abundant zero-insertion clono-
types Invariant T-cells MAIT Mucosal-Associated In-
variant T-cells and iNKT Invariant Natural Killer T-
cells are intrinsically insertion-less have restricted VJ
usage for alpha chain and are often abundant These
cells are produced in adulthood and could in princi-
ple constitute a substantial fraction of our zero-insertion
dataset confounding our analysis Since our abundant
zero-insertion clonotypes have a very diverse usage of VJ
genes we can exclude that the majority of them are from
invariant T-cells although we did identify a small num-

Our current data clearly shows that clonotypes that
originated in the cord blood tend to be among the most
abundant in the naive repertoire but we cannot unam-
biguously point to the source of this eect One possi-
bility is convergent recombination 6 high clonotypes
abundances could be due to the accumulation of mul-
tiple convergent recombination events made more likely
by the limited recombination diversity during fetal devel-
opment An alternative explanation is that these clones
have had more time to expand than others Fetal cells
come from dierent precursors and mature in a dierent
environment the fetal liver than post-natal cells 24
In vitro experiments have shown that fetal T-cells have a
dierent proliferation potential than post-fetal cells 25
Additionally a vacant ecological niche eect may play a
role When these clones rst appeared the repertoire had
not reached its carrying capacity set by homeostatic reg-
ulation leaving room for future expansion These clones
may have initially lled the repertoire later to be grad-
ually replaced by post-fetal clonotypes Consequently
fetal clones including those whose TCR was recombined

with no TdT would be expected to have larger sizes
Clones with non-zero numbers of insertions could also
originate in the cord blood as TdT is upregulated how-
ever we have no way of distinguishing them from postna-
tal clones Quantitative TCR repertoire proling prefer-
ably with the use of unique molecular identiers for accu-
rate data normalization and error correction performed
for species with no TdT activity in the embryo such as
mice as well as novel cell lineage tracking techniques 26
could be used to investigate the detailed dynamics of fetal
clones This large initial expansion of fetal clones could
protect them from later extinction This would suggest
that the estimated 37-year lifetime of zero-insertion fetal
clonotypes could be longer than that of regular clones
produced after birth
The proposed large initial expansion of fetal clones
could protect them from later extinction This would
suggest that the estimated 37-year lifetime of zero-
insertion fetal clonotypes could be longer than that of
regular clones produced after birth Sharing of beta
TCRs has previously been shown to decrease with age
17 Depletion of fetal clonotypes which are more likely
to be shared could contribute to this phenomenon Our
results also predict that the excess sharing of clonotypes
between twins due to the biological contamination of fetal
cells should decrease with age In general the observed
abundance of large zero-insertion clonotypes and their
persistence through signicant part of our life should
have important consequences for the adaptive immunity
regulation both in pre- and post-fetal period
Lastly our general framework for analyzing the overlap
between dierent repertoires has far-reaching practical
implications for the tracking of T-cell clonotypes in the
clinic In particular the analysis of overlap between pre-
and post-treatment repertoires using probabilistic char-
acteristics of clonotypes sharing could help determine the
host or donor origin of clonotypes after hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation HSCT and also increase reli-
ability of malignant clones identication in minimal resid-
ual disease follow-up

with modications The cDNA rst strand was pro-
duced from the total RNA using the SmartScribe kit
Clontech USA and universal primers specic for the C-
segment see Fig S1 A Custom cap-switching oligonu-
cleotides with unique molecular identiers UMI and
sample barcodes were used to introduce the universal
primer binding site to the 3 end of the cDNA molecules
see Fig S1 B Each tube contained 500 ng of total RNA
1x SmartScribe buer dNTP 1 mM each 10pcmol of
BCuniR4vvshort and TRACR2 primers see Table S1 for
sequences and 1 l of SmartScribe reverse transcriptase
5mkg of the total RNA was used for the cDNA synthe-
sis for each sample 10 tubes per sample The cDNA
synthesis product was treated 45 min 37oC with 1 l
of 5ul UDG NEB USA to digest the cap-switching
oligonucleotide and puried with the Quigen PCR puri-
cation kit After the cDNA synthesis two steps of PCR
amplication were used to amplify the cDNA and also
introduce Illumina TruSeq adapters as well as the sec-
ond sample barcode After both steps the PCR product
was puried using the Quigen PCR purication kit ac-
cording to the manufacturers protocol The rst PCR
step see Fig S1 C consists of 16 cycles of 94 oC for
20 sec 60oC for 15 sec 72oC for 60 sec Each tube con-
tained total reaction volume 15 l 1x Q5 polymerase

F Learning recombination statistics
that sequence Pgensequence cid80
We built a generative model that describes the prob-
ability of generation of recombined sequences following
the theoretical framework described in 11 13 The gen-
eration probability for each sequence is calculated as the
sum over all recombination scenarios r that can produce
r Prearrr For TCR
alpha chains the model assumes the following factorized
form for a recombination scenario dened by the choice
of genes V and J P V J deletions delV and delJ
P delV V  and P delJJ and insertions ins P ins
rearrr  P V JP delV V P delJJP ins
The parameters of the models the dierent probabili-
ties in the factorized formula were inferred by maximiz-
ing the likelihood of the observed out-of-frame sequences
given the model using Expectation-Maximization 11
For alpha chains the model was reformulated as a Hid-
den Markov Model and the parameters were learned ef-
ciently using a Baum-Welch algorithm as described in
For beta chains the model describes probabilities for
V D and J choices with possible deletions and insertions
at each of the two junctions
The parameters for the beta chain model were in-
ferred directly using the Expectation-Maximization algo-
rithm by enumerating all possible recombination scenar-
ios that can produce each sequence using the procedure
described in 11
This procedure allows us to learn the features of the re-
combination statistics with great accuracy in particular
the distribution of number of insertions at the junctions
even though the recombination events themselves can-
not be unambiguously be determined for each sequence
because of convergent recombination
G Distribution of insertions for each beta chains
abundance class
We applied the procedure described in the previous
section separately for each abundance class of the beta-
chain sequences However given the small size of the
datasets 2000 or 3000 sequences we did not learn the
full model for each class Instead we used a previously
inferred universal beta-chain recombination model 11
for the VDJ gene usages and their deletion proles and
we learned the insertion distributions P insV D and
P insDJ for each class separately while keeping the
other parameters constant The distribution of insertions
thus inferred are used to plot the results of Figs 3 and 4
of the main text
Inference of selection factors
In-frame sequences statistically dier from out-of-
frame sequences besides their frameshift because in-
frame sequences are functional and have passed thymic
selection For each sequence we dened a selection factor
Q as the ratio of the probability of observing the sequence
in the in-frame set to the probability of recombining the
sequence according to out-of-frame statistics as inferred
above The overal selection factor Q is assumed to be
the product of several independent factors q acting on
the CDR3 length L and on the identity of amino acid ai
at each position i of the CDR3 7

J Out-of-frame sharing prediction
To predict sharing for each individual we generated
sequences using our recombination model Pgen alpha or
beta with individually inferred model parameters Nor-
malized sharing of the TCR sequences between two clone-
sets is dened as the number of the same unique TCR
nucleotide sequences observed in both of them divided
by the product of the total numbers of unique TCR nu-
cleotide sequences in the two datasets
We calculated sharing of either whole chains or of their
CDR3 dened as the sub-sequence going from the con-
served cystein at the end of the V region to the conserved
phenylalanine in the J region
The alpha chain results for whole-chain sharing are
plotted in the main text in Fig 1 and the data shows
good agreement with the model The results for CDR3
sharing are shown in Fig S2 The model systemati-
cally underestimates the normalized sharing by a com-
mon multiplicative factor of 17 for non-twins with a
Pearson correlation coecient of 08 between the data
and the model prediction Absolute numbers of shared
CDR3 sequences for alpha chains varied from 400 to 1200
For beta chain sequences the prediction of out-of-
frame sharing is more dicult because of the low numbers
of out-of-frame sequences in the RNA data which com-
bined to a lower mean Pgen results in a much lower num-
ber of shared out-of-frame sequences We also identied
and removed from the dataset 26 out-of-frame sequences
shared between more than two individuals These se-
quences are likely to arise due to reproducible aligner
errors or technology artifacts  some of them contained
intronic sequences etc Absolute numbers of shared beta
CDR3 sequences varied from 0 to 82 Nevertheless the
number of shared beta out-of-frame CDR3 sequences for
twins exceeded the model prediction see Fig S3 con-
rming our hypothesis of biological contamination during
pregnancy
In-frame sharing prediction
To accurately predict the normalized sharing num-
ber for in-frame nucleotide clonotypes we generated se-
quences from Pgen as we did for out-of-frame sequences
but weighted them by their selection factor Q to account
for thymic selection The predicted normalized sharing
number was then calculated as

over sequences s found in both samples
For both the beta and the alpha chains the prediction
agrees very well with the data Fig S4 and Fig S5 For
the beta chain twins share more CDR3 sequences than
non-twin pairs while no such eect was observed for the
alpha chain sequences This fact could be explained by
the much higher number of clonotypes shared due to con-
vergent recombination in the alpha in-frame dataset than
in the beta in-frame and alpha and beta out-of-frame
datasets Excess of shared CDR3 nucleotide sequences
due to biological contamination in twins is lower than the
amount of convergent recombination noise in the alpha
in-frame shared CDR3 nucleotide sequences Absolute
numbers of shared in-frame CDR3 sequences for alpha
chains varied from 30000-50000 sequences depending of
the pair and 5000-9000 for beta chains
L Mixed model inference
We hypothesized that the larger amount of zero inser-
tion clonotypes is responsible for the increase in shar-
ing between the most abundant clonotypes of the out-
of-frame repertoires of unrelated individuals To test
this hypothesis we constructed a mixture model for each
abundance class each class containing 2000 clonotypes
ranked by decreasing abundance
We assume that abundance class C contains a fraction
F C of clonotypes generated with zero insertions and
1  F C of regular clonotypes Obtaining F C is not
straightforward because regular clonotypes can also zero
insertions In addition the number of insertions cannot
be determined with certainty  for example a deletion
followed by an insertion matching the germline sequence
can be wrongly interpreted as a case of no insertions
To circumvent this problem we determine for each
abundance class a simpler quantity to estimate namely
the fraction F0C of clonotypes that are consistent with
zero insertions ie that can be entirely matched to the
germline genes Because of the reasons outlined above
F0C is not equal to F C However F0C is a linear
function of F C F0C  A  BF C Therefore if we
can generate synthetic sequences such that their F0C
agrees with data then we are guaranteed that their F C
will coincide with the data as well even if we do not know
the explicit mixing parameters F C
To obtain this mixture we generated many sequences
from our recombination model Pgen To determine which
generated sequences were consistent with zero insertions
we aligned them to all possible V and J genomic tem-
plates We then separated out the sequences consistent
with zero insertions from the others and created for each
abundance class C and articial dataset with a fraction
F0C of such sequences and 1  F0C of the other
sequences not consistent with zero insertions where
F0C is given by the data
We then calculated normalized sharing in the synthetic
data by including an increasing number of abundance
classes starting with the most abundant ones and com-
pared to data in Fig 5

II SUPPLEMENTARY RESULTS
A Distinctive properties of shared clonotypes
between twins
Shared clonotypes in unrelated individuals appear in
the process of convergent recombination Sequences with
a higher Pgen are thus more likely to be shared and we
can calculate accurately the distribution of Pgen among
shared sequences see Fig 2 We observe that sequences
shared between twins violate this prediction consistent
with our hypothesis that some of these sequences are due
to biological contamination To conrm this we used a
sequence feature that is negatively correlated with Pgen
11 the number of insertions in the CDR3 region The
number of insertions in CDR3 sequences shared between
unrelated individuals was indeed lower Fig S6 than
the mean number of insertions in non-shared sequences
However the mean number of insertions in sequences
shared between twins black boxes is higher than in un-
related individuals The same and even stronger eect is
observed for memory CD45RO cells Fig S7
B The phenotype of beta chain out-of-frame
shared clonotypes
Two individuals displayed the most prominent excess
of shared beta out-of-frame sequences Since the model
prediction for the number of shared sequences is close to
zero we suppose that most of these shared sequences did
not arise due to convergent recombination These out-
of-frame clones bear a second functional allele otherwise
they would have been ltered by selection in a thymus
and they also should have either the CD4 or the CD8 phe-
notype To attribute these clonotypes a phenotype we
separately sequenced CD4 CD8 and CD45RO positive
subsets for the two donors and searched for the 84 out-
of-frame CDR3s shared between the unpartitioned out-
of-frame repertoires 44 CDR3s were found in the CD8
subsets of both individuals and only 5 sequences were
found in the CD4 subsets of both individuals 25 out of
the 44 CD8 and 3 out of the 5 sequences were also found
in the 45RO compartment Only 3 sequences were
mapped discordantly eg CD4 in one twin and CD8
in the second twin and 2 sequences were absent from
the CD4 CD8 and CD45RO compartments of both indi-
viduals For the other 32 sequences the CD4CD8 status
could be determined only for one individual most prob-
ably due to the sequencing depth limitations In case of
convergent recombination it is unlikely that shared non-
productive sequences would have the same phenotype in
dierent donors The phenotypic study thus conrms the
biological contamination hypothesis
C Our results are reproducible using previously
published data
We tested the robustness of our results on previously
published twin data from 8 We observed the same ex-
cess of low-probability shared sequences in twins com-
pared to unrelated individuals as in Fig 2 see Fig S8
These data also allowed us to control for possible exper-
imental contamination One of the twin pairs that par-
ticipated in the present study was sequenced three years
ago using a dierent technology described in 8 exclud-
ing the possibility of any contamination between the old
and new samples Out of 84 beta out-of-frame clono-
types shared between two new twin samples 59 were also
shared between the new sample of one twin and the old
sample of the second twin Therefore the out-of-frame
sequences shared between the twins are reproducible and
could not be result of experimental contamination with
PCR-products or RNA
Invariant T-cell alpha clonotypes in the data
It was previously shown that mucosal-associated in-
variant T-cells MAIT and natural killer T-cells NKT
have an invariant alpha chain with very low diversity 33
Specic V-J combinations are chosen TRAV10TRAJ18
for NKTs and TRAV1-2TRAJ33 for MAIT and no nu-
cleotides are inserted in the recombination process of
these clonotypes To see whether these clonotypes could
potentially confound our analysis we searched for pub-
lished NKT and MAIT sequences in our datasets 25
out of the 27 known MAIT sequences were found in the
datasets at least once 21 out of them in the all six in-
dividuals and 8 out of the 13 known NKT sequences
2 of them in the all six individuals MAIT and NKT
sequences are present in our data but only a few shared
sequences could be explained by them The majority
of shared zero insertion sequences could thus not be at-
tributed to known MAIT or NKT subsets
