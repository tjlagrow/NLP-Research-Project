Front page : The Universe is smiling! This spectacular picture shows the Stephan’s Quintet, a
compact group of interacting galaxies. A violent galaxy collision is occurring, which creates a giant
shock wave highlighted in green (Hα) on the image. This is a composite image made up of optical,
Hα and infrared observations.

During these three years my work was extremely diversiﬁed and I had the opportunity to do widely
different things such as (take a deep breath!) preparing proposals for observing time, getting married
with you Carole, observing at the telescope, reducing data, going out with people I’ve met during
schools or meetings, building empirical and analytical models, or use numerical codes to interpret the
data, doubting, working on the JWST/MIRI instrument and being part of such a huge project as MIRI,
running, traveling and giving talks, teaching at the University, etc! I am aware of having been lucky
and privileged, and obviously all of this would not have been possible without all the people I’ve been
working or interacting with. So, a big big thank you. . .

Abstract
My main thesis work is to understand the origin of molecular Hydrogen (H2) emission in ac-
tive phases of galaxy evolution. Spitzer space telescope observations reveal a new class of
H2-luminous galaxies with enhanced H2 line emission but where star formation is strongly sup-
pressed. This is in sharp contrast with what is observed in standard star forming galaxies.
The Stephan’s Quintet (SQ) galaxy collision is a striking example I initially focus on. We present
a scenario and a detailed model to account for the presence of H2 in the SQ giant shock, to
characterize its physical state, and to describe its role as a cooling agent of a violent phase of
galaxy interactions. In this scenario, the dissipation of the mechanical energy of the collision
produces a multiphase medium where molecular gas fragments coexist with a hot (∼ 5 × 106 K),
X-ray emitting plasma. Our model quantiﬁes the gas cooling, dust destruction, H2 formation and
emission in the postshock multiphase gas. The dynamical interaction between the ISM phases
drives a cycle where H2 is formed out of atomic gas that cools, and is excited repeatedly before
being destroyed. A cascade of energy is associated with this cycle, in which the mechanical energy
powers supersonic turbulence within the molecular gas. The H2 emission is associated with the
dissipation of this turbulent energy.
New results of mid-infrared and radio observations in the SQ shock are presented. These obser-
vations reveal that dust and CO emission gas is associated with the warm ((cid:38) 100 K) H2 seen
by Spitzer, and that this gas is in an unusual physical state where star formation is suppressed.
In addition, to test the scenario proposed for the formation of H2 in the SQ shock, I carry on a
detailed observational study and modeling of the dust emission from the H2 gas. Observational
perspectives with the Herschel satellite are discussed.
These observations suggest that H2 contributes signiﬁcantly to the energy bugdet of galaxies
which are in key phases of their evolution (galaxy interaction, gas accretion in galaxy clusters,
starburst or AGN feedback). My thesis work is a ﬁrst step to understand the role that molecular
gas plays in galaxy evolution. Our model developped for SQ is extended to the context of radio
galaxies, which allow for the ﬁrst time to peer at the impact of the AGN-driven jet on the mul-
tiphase ISM of the host galaxy. A natural extension of this work is the characterization of the
energetics of galactic winds (in the M82 starburst galaxy for instance) and in AGN-driven winds
recently discovered in high-redshift radio-galaxies. This thesis includes the tools to perform a
detailed modeling of Spitzer and upcoming Herschel data.
Besides this work, as a member of the JWST/MIRI consortium, I also report my contribution to
the optical performance tests of the MIRI instrument, which will extend the study of H2-luminous
galaxies to high redshifts. The observational and theoretical work presented in this manuscript
may help to develop a phenomenological ”recipe” of the impact of H2 on the energetics of galaxy
evolution. This work will certainly be helpful for the preparation of future observing programs
aiming at testing this phenomenology directly, thanks to spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies
with the JWST and SPICA missions.
Abstract
Ce travail est dédié à la compréhension de l’émission du dihydrogène (H2) dans les phases ac-
tives de l’évolution des galaxies. La découverte d’une nouvelle population de sources extragalac-
tiques avec un spectre dans l’infrarouge moyen dominé par les raies d’émission de H2 est un
résultat inattendu des observations spectroscopiques du satellite Spitzer. La faiblesse des bandes
d’émission des poussières et des raies du gaz ionisé par rapport à celles de H2 indique la présence
de grandes quantités de gaz H2 (jusqu‘à 1010 M(cid:12) au centre des amas de galaxies) avec peu de
formation d’étoiles, contrairement à ce qui est observée dans les galaxies standard.
Une interprétation physique de l’émission H2 associée à une collision à grande vitesse (1000
km/s) entre galaxies dans le Stephan’s Quintet (SQ) est d’abord présentée. La dissipation de
l’énergie cinétique de la collision crée un milieu multi phases où des fragments de gaz molécu-
laire coexistent avec un plasma de gaz chaud (∼ 5× 106 K) émetteur en rayons X. Notre interpré-
tation relie la structure multi phases du gaz post-choc à la structure en densité du gaz pré-choc.
L’interaction dynamique entre les phases entretient un cycle où H2 se forme à partir de gaz atom-
ique chaud qui se refroidit puis est excité de manière répétée avant d’être détruit. A ce cycle est
associée une cascade énergétique où l’énergie cinétique du gaz alimente une turbulence super-
sonique dans le gaz moléculaire. Le rayonnement H2 est associé à la dissipation de l’énergie
turbulente.
Les résultats de nouvelles observations moyen-infrarouge et radio dans le choc de SQ sont présen-
tés. L’émission de la poussière et du gaz CO associé au gaz H2 est détectée. Le gaz CO est
extrêmement turbulent, ce qui pourrait expliquer pourquoi la formation stellaire est si peu efﬁ-
cace dans cet environnement. Pour tester notre interprétation de l’émission de H2, les résultats
de la modélisation de l’émission de la poussière associée au gaz H2, ainsi que les perspectives
observationelles apportées par le satellite Herschel, sont discutés.
Ces observations et ce travail théorique inscrivent l’étude du gaz moléculaire dans le cadre de
la formation et de l’évolution des galaxies. Les mêmes caractéristiques d’émission H2 sont ob-
servées dans les interactions entre galaxies, la rétroaction de la formation stellaire et celle des
noyaux actifs de galaxies sur le milieu interstellaire, ainsi que l’accrétion de gaz dans les amas.
Un dénominateur commun de ces phases violentes de l’évolution des galaxies est la libération
d’énergie mécanique en quantité sufﬁsante pour affecter globalement le milieu interstellaire.
Cette interprétation est étendue à l’émission H2 des radio-galaxies où le jet relativiste est la
source d’énergie mécanique. Dans les deux cas, le gaz moléculaire apparaît comme un acteur de
l’évolution dynamique des galaxies en amont de la formation stellaire.
Cette thèse présente également un travail d’analyse des tests de qualité optique réalisés au CEA
sur l’instrument MIRI, une caméra moyen-infrarouge qui sera intégrée sur le futur télescope spa-
tial JWST. Cet instrument permettra d’étendre ce travail de thèse à haut redshift, pour comprendre
l’impact du gaz moléculaire sur l’évolution des galaxies lorsque l’Univers était plus jeune. Cette
étude servira de base pour de futurs programmes d’observations avec le JWST.

À ces belles nuits claires passées la tête en l’air
A ma famille et ma belle-famille pour m’avoir transmis l’amour
de la nature, de la science, et la passion du vin
A ces joyeux gosiers qui me servent d’amis
A l’appellation d’origine contrôlée “L’étoile”
A Carole, pour son sourire
L’Univers, c’est un peu comme un grand vin. . .
Levez les yeux au ciel lors d’une belle nuit. Vous voyez d’abord sa belle robe scintillante. Quelques
milliers d’étoiles, sur les cent milliards que contient notre galaxie. Regardez plus attentivement.
Un nuage laiteux traverse le ciel, il s’agit d’un des bras spiraux de notre “Voie Lactée”, où la concen-
tration des étoiles est telle que notre œil ne peut les distinguer. Arrêtez-y vous un instant. Des reﬂets,
des zones plus sombres se dévoilent. C’est le milieu interstellaire, “entre les étoiles”, qui n’est pas
vide, comme on l’a longtemps cru. Ce milieu est constitué d’un mélange de gaz (atomes, molécules)
et de poussières, représentant environ 5 − 10% de la masse d’une galaxie.
Tout apparait si tranquille, si calme. Vous commencez juste à sentir les parfums enivrants de votre
nectar. Mais maintenant goutez-y. Pour cela, imaginez que vos yeux soient équipés des plus puissants
instruments capables d’explorer tout le domaine du spectre électromagnétique. Vous découvrez une
explosion de saveurs, un Univers bouillonnant, violent, explosif !
Les galaxies sont loin d’être des objets “statiques”, immuables. Elles évoluent d’un point de vue
dynamique et chimique. La matière interstellaire joue précisément un rôle très important dans cette
évolution, à petite échelle (celle d’une étoile), mais aussi à l’échelle de la galaxie toute entière. La
gaz moléculaire, la phase la plus froide du milieu interstellaire (MIS), est le matériau de base pour
la formation des étoiles. Celles-ci se forment dans les régions les plus denses des nuages molécu-
laires. Au cours de leur vie, les étoiles émettent du rayonnement UV, façonnent des “bulles” dans
leur nuage parent, et lorsque ces bulles crèvent, le gaz chaud éjecté peut nourrir la phase ionisée du
MIS. La chimie de ce vin évolue lentement avec le temps, développant des arômes de plus en plus
complexes. Certaines étoiles massives explosent en supernovae, et participent à l’évolution chim-
ique du gaz en enrichissant la phase chaude du MIS en éléments plus lourds que l’Hélium. Lorsque
Contents
cette source d’ionization s’éteint, le gas chaud peut se recombiner, pour reformer du gaz neutre, et
éventuellement du gaz moléculaire. Une galaxie est donc une machine “écologique” à recycler la
matière interstellaire! Ce vin, si tranquille et si simple au premier coup d’œil, se révèle d’une extraor-
dinaire richesse, d’une incroyable complexité! L’Univers, c’est comme un grand vin, plus on l’étudie,
plus on l’apprécie!
L’évolution des galaxies, qui forme le cadre général de cette thèse, met en jeu des phases extrême-
ment énergétiques, comme par exemple la collision entre deux galaxies. Une quantité phénoménale
d’énergie mécanique est libérée. Comment le MIS réagit-il à ces phénomènes énergétiques? Que
devient ce cycle de la matière interstellaire, et comment la formation stellaire est-elle affectée? Ces
questions sont au cœur de ce travail, et sont clés pour comprendre comment les galaxies, telles que
nous les voyons aujourd’hui, se sont formées.
Mais mon petit, qu’as-tu cherché?
Le sujet de cette thèse a pour point de départ la découverte observationnelle d’une émission extraor-
dinairement puissante de H2, la molécule la plus simple et la plus abondante de l’Univers, dans un
groupe compact de galaxies en interaction, appelé le Quintette de Stephan. Cette découverte obser-
vationnelle a été suivi par la détection d’autres objets, comme des radio-galaxies, ou des ﬂots de gaz
dans les amas de galaxies, présentant les mêmes caractéristiques spectroscopiques dans le domaine
moyen-infrarouge. Le spectre de ces objets est dominé par les raies rotationelles de H2, avec de faibles
signatures de formation stellaire (émission de la poussière ou du gaz ionisé), contrairement à ce qui
est observé dans les galaxies classiques (par exemple les spirales), formant des étoiles. De grandes
quantités de gaz moléculaire sont détectés, mais avec étonnamment peu de formation stellaire. Une
partie de mon travail a été de donner une interprétation physique de cette émission.
et donc, qu’as-tu fait exactement?
J’ai cherché à comprendre la formation et l’émission du H2 dans ces phases actives de l’évolution
des galaxies, en me focalisant d’abord sur le Quintette de Stephan. Ce travail a été très varié. J’ai
développé et utilisé des outils théoriques pour calculer le refroidissement du gaz dans ces environ-
nements astrophysiques, la formation et l’émission de H2. Les observations existantes et ce travail
de modélisation ont conduit à de nouvelles propositions d’observations. J’ai conduit plusieurs cam-
pagnes d’observations au radiotélescope de 30m de l’IRAM2 pour chercher le gaz CO (monoxyde de
Carbone, gaz moléculaire “froid”, i.e. ∼ 10 − 20 K) associé au gaz H2 “chaud” (∼ 100 − 1000 K)
détecté dans le Quintette en infrarouge. Mon travail inclue la réduction de ces données radio et leur
interprétation.
En parallèle, j’ai eu la chance de participer au projet spatial JWST, le James Webb Space Tele-
scope, qui succèdera au télescope spatial Hubble. Une partie de mon travail est dédié aux tests de
performance optique d’une caméra infrarouge, MIRI, qui sera un des 5 instruments embarqués à bord
du JWST. Cette instrument sera sans nul doute le futur proche des observations du gaz moléculaire,

notamment de H2, dans le domaine moyen-infrarouge. Il permettra de tester si les galaxies lumineuses
en H2 sont présentes à haut décalage vers le rouge, c’est-à-dire lorsque l’Univers était plus jeune.
Cette thèse a aussi été une aventure humaine internationale, faite de rencontres, lors d’écoles,
de conférences, ou de séminaires. J’ai eu la chance de voyager et d’interagir avec de nombreuses
personnes. Vous l’aurez compris, j’ai pris beaucoup de plaisir pendant ces trois années de thèse. De
manière plus générale, comme tout travail de recherche, la thèse est parsemée de moments de doute,
mais aussi d’euphorie où l’on croit avoir compris ou découvert quelque chose, pour ﬁnalement le
remettre en question et douter à nouveau !
Tu as cherché, soit. . . et as-tu “trouvé” au moins?
La notion de “découverte”, de “trouvaille”, est très subjective en astrophysique! Les “grandes” dé-
couvertes sont rarement le fruit d’un programme préétabli, elles apparaissent très souvent de manière
inattendue. Les percées théoriques sont aussi, bien souvent, le fruit d’un long travail et d’une grande
expérience. Guidé par mon directeur de thèse, François Boulanger, j’ai essayé de produire un travail
théorique qui ne soit jamais trop éloigné des observations, c’est-à-dire qui puisse interpréter des don-
nées existantes, ou bien être vériﬁé par de futures observations. Je vous invite maintenant à lire cette
aventure dans les “quelques” pages qui suivent. . .

The discovery of a new population of H2-luminous objects
The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds
new discoveries, is not "Eureka!" but "That’s funny..."
Isaac Asimov
Abstract
One of the surprising results obtained with the Spitzer space telescope is the discovery of a signiﬁ-
cant and diverse population of low-redshift objects where the mid-infrared rotational line emission
of molecular hydrogen is strongly enhanced, while star formation is suppressed. This is in sharp
contrast with previous observations, where H2 was solely associated with star formation. These
“H2-luminous sources” include galaxies that are in key-phases of their evolution, dominated by
gas accretion, galaxy interactions, or galactic winds driven by star formation and active galactic
nuclei. These observations open a new perspective on ISM physics, and on the role that molecular
gas plays in active phases of galaxy evolution. Why is H2 present in these violent environments?
How is the H2 emission powered? Why is the H2 gas unefﬁcient at forming stars? These questions
are the core issues addressed in my thesis work.
1.1 Introduction
The molecular gas plays a central role in galaxy evolution. In most galaxies, it carries the bulk
of the mass of the interstellar matter and it is the fuel for star formation. Stars are indeed made
from gravitationally unstable cores within molecular clouds. Therefore, the mass of molecular gas is
generally associated with the star formation rate by deﬁning a star formation efﬁciency1 (see Schmidt,
1959). The bulk of the molecular gas in most galaxies is known from molecular line spectroscopy
to be cold (≈ 10 − 20 K, Fixsen et al., 1999). Most of the present studies primarily rely on tracing
molecular gas through the observation of low rotational emission of carbon monoxyde (CO) in the
radio domain.
The H2 molecule, being the most abundant molecule in the Universe, is the main constituent of
the molecular gas. To be seen in emission, the H2 gas temperature must be warmer than ≈ 100 K.
Mid-infrared (Mid-IR) rotational line H2 emission traces what I will call “warm H2” throughout my
manuscript, at temperatures T ≈ 102−3 K (see chapter 3). Warm H2 was ﬁrst observed within galactic
star-forming regions, and associated with the illumination of the surface of molecular clouds by UV
light from massive stars, creating Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs, see e.g. Habart et al., 2003). In
the Galaxy, H2 is also observed in proto-stellar outﬂows (e.g. Neufeld et al., 2006; Maret et al., 2009)
or supernovae remnants (e.g. Hewitt et al., 2009), where it is shock-heated.

Figure 1.1: Relationship between H2 and IR emission from PAHs in nearby (spatially resolved) star-
forming (SF) galaxies, dwarf galaxies, and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The data is from Roussel
et al. (2007). These galaxies belong to the SINGSa sample of galaxies observed with the Spitzer space
telescope. The H2 luminosity is summed over the S(0) to S(3) rotational lines of H2.
aSpitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey, http://sings.stsci.edu/.
The ISO2 and Spitzer3 IR satellites have started to peer at H2 emission from external galaxies.
In star forming galaxies, rotational H2 line emission is thought to come from PDRs (Rigopoulou
et al., 2002; Higdon et al., 2006; Roussel et al., 2007). A general relationship between the H2 and IR
luminosity is inferred from these data. This correlation is shown for nearby galaxies observed with the
Spitzer space telescope on Fig. 1.1. Note that the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) galaxies stand above
the tight correlation found for dwarf and star-forming (SF) galaxies. Roussel et al. (2007) indicate that
the H2 to PAH luminosity ratio in star forming galaxies is within the range of values that are expected
from PDR emission. For the AGN sample, Roussel et al. (2007) suggest that the radiation from the
AGN is not sufﬁcient to power the H2 emission.
Recent mid-IR spectroscopy performed with the IRS4 onboard the Spitzer space telescope suggests
that our census of warm molecular gas in galaxies may be severely incomplete, revealing a new class of
galaxies with strongly enhanced H2 rotational emission lines, while classical star formation indicators
(far-infrared continuum emission, ionized gas lines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) are
strongly suppressed. These galaxies are called in this manuscript H2-luminous galaxies.
In this chapter we paint the global observational framework of this PhD work. Section 1.2 presents
the observational discovery of H2-luminous objects. We point out the key astrophysical questions that
we address in this manuscript in sect. 1.3. The main goal of my thesis work is to interpret these

surprising observations.
1.2 H2-luminous galaxies
1.2.1 Global observational characteristics
The ﬁrst extragalactic mid-IR spectrum dominated by H2 rotational lines has been detected in the
Stephan’s Quintet (hereafter SQ) compact group of galaxies (Appleton et al., 2006). Strikingly, the
H2 emission is detected outside the galactic disks of the group, and is more powerful that the X-ray
emission from the hot gas lying in the group halo. I started my PhD shortly after the publication of that
paper. My research quickly focused on this object, with the aim of explaining the origin of the H2 gas
and its power compared to that of the hot, X-ray emitting gas. To determine and model the excitation
mechanisms that can power the observed H2 emission was a driver to tackle the latter problem. This
observational discovery and my interpretation and modeling work are detailed in chapters 5 and 6.
The detection of H2 emission from SQ was the ﬁrst of a series of discoveries of powerful H2
emission in extragalactic sources that we present here. Fig. 1.2 gathers a sample of this new class
of extremely luminous H2 emission galaxies, up to 1010 L(cid:12) in pure rotational molecular hydrogen
emission lines and relatively weak total IR emission. This plot shows how H2 galaxies stand out
above star forming galaxies from the SINGS5 survey when plotting the ratio of H2 rotational lines to
the PAH 7.7 µm luminosities vs. continuum luminosity at 24 µm. These H2-luminous galaxies are
therefore out of the correlation presented in Fig. 1.1. Some of the sources have undetected 7.7 µm
emission, so lower limits for LH2/LPAH7.7 are indicated.
The global characteristics of H2-luminous galaxies are the following. Ogle et al. (2009) use em-
pirical criteria to deﬁne H2-luminous galaxies6. H2-luminous galaxies have a large total H2 to IR
luminosity ratio:
−3 − 10
and more speciﬁcally a large H2 to 7.7 µm PAH luminosity:
νLν(24 µm) ≈ 10
LPAH7.7 ≈ 0.04 − 10
The lower limit of 0.04 is an empirical value and also depends on the depth of the Spitzer observations.
These ratios are up to two orders of magnitude greater than the median values for the normal star-
forming galaxies. This is why they stand out of normal star-forming galaxies and luminous infrared
galaxies in the plot of Fig. 1.2.
H2-luminous galaxies point at a generic source of H2 emission not powered by star formation.
The most contrasted examples show bright H2 emission lines with almost no spectroscopic signature
(IR continuum of thermal dust emission, or ionized gas lines) of star formation. For instance, this
is the case in Stephan’s Quintet (see chapter 6) and in the 3C326 radio-galaxy (Ogle et al., 2007).
The spectrum of 3C326 is shown in Fig. 1.2, on top of the standard spectrum of a starburst galaxy.

1. The discovery of a new population of H2-luminous objects
Figure 1.2: H2-luminous galaxies in one plot. Left: Ratio of H2 rotational emission summed over
the 0-0 S(0)−S(3) lines to 7.7µm PAH luminosity, as a function of the 24µm continuum luminosity.
The ratio indicates the relative importance of mechanical heating and power by star formation. At
all IR luminosities, the observations reveal galaxies with excess H2 emission beyond that expected
from Star Formation (SF). The empty diamonds and the dashed line show the range spanned by
SF-dominated galaxies. The H2-luminous galaxies include active galactic nuclei galaxies (Seyferts,
LINERs and radio galaxies), cooling ﬂows (Perseus A, ZW3146) and interacting galaxies/mergers
(Stephan’s Quintet –SQ– and NGC 6240). The H2-luminous radio-galaxies are from the Ogle et al.
(2009) sample. The excess H2 emission reveals large (up to 1010 M(cid:12) ) quantities of warm (T >
150 K) molecular gas. On the right side we compare the spectrum of the 3C326 H2-luminous radio-
galaxy (Ogle et al., 2007) with that of starburst galaxies (Brandl et al., 2006).
Note the absence of dust continuum and features in the H2-luminous 3C326 radio-galaxy spectrum as
compared to a star-forming galaxy.
In many of these galaxies, molecular gas has been detected through the mid-IR H2 rotational
lines prior to any CO observation. This sample of H2-luminous objects comprises different types
of astrophysical sources. We brieﬂy describe below some of the most important examples in each
category of sources.
1.2.2 Examples among different types of H2-luminous astrophysical sources
Among the sample of H2-luminous objects, Stephan’s Quintet is certainly the object where the astro-
physical context is clear enough to identify the dominant source of energy that powers the H2 emission
(chapter 6) and to associate this H2 emission with the mechanical energy released in a galaxy colli-

energy source is less clear.
Interacting and infrared galaxies
The ﬁrst H2 luminous galaxy, NGC 6240, was identiﬁed from ground based near-IR H2 spectroscopy
by Joseph et al. (1984). Later, Hawarden et al. (2002) report the discovery of four Seyfert 2 galaxies

1. The discovery of a new population of H2-luminous objects
In Fig. 1.3 we show two iconic infrared galaxies, NGC 6240 and M82 that show strong H2 emis-
sion. NGC 6240 is a ultra-luminous infrared merger (LIR ≈ 6 × 1011 L(cid:12)) with optical and mid-IR
signatures of AGN activity. The outstanding property of NGC 6240 is the presence of a double-AGN
(Komossa et al., 2003). Lutz et al. (2003) report mid- and far-IR spectroscopy with the ISO SWS8
and LWS9 instruments, and ﬁnd unusually strong H2 mid-IR lines. This result is conﬁrmed by Armus
× 4.7(cid:48)(cid:48) aperture of the SH10 slit of
et al. (2006), who ﬁnd ≈ 2 × 109 M(cid:12) of warm H2 within the 11.3(cid:48)(cid:48)
the IRS, that include the two nuclei and part of an extended region where near-IR ro-vib H2 emission
is detected (van der Werf et al., 1993; Max et al., 2005).
The M82 starburst galaxy is not stricto sensu an H2 luminous galaxy, but we show it in Fig. 1.3
because it may provide insights for the interpretation of other H2-luminous objects. The well-known
Spitzer image reveals the dust emission in the starburst-driven wind. Interestingly, H2 is detected in
the outﬂow of the galaxy (Engelbracht et al., 2006). Veilleux et al. (2009) also detected emission in
the H2 1-0S(1) 2.12 µm rovibrational line from the starburst-driven wind. M82 is clear example where
H2 gas and dust coexist with the hot plasma outﬂowing gas.
Up to now, Stephan’s Quintet is the only example among the Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs)
catalog (Hickson, 1982) that show powerful emission (Appleton et al., 2006; Cluver et al., 2009).
HCGs are isolated high-surface-brightness galaxy groups containing at least 4 members within a nar-
row optical magnitude range (≈ 13 − 14 mag), and almost all of them involve extreme galaxy tidal
interactions (Hickson, 1982; Sulentic et al., 2001). A Spitzer observations have been carried on to
search for H2 in HCGs and the data are being analysed (see chapter 9).
Radio-galaxies
The ﬁrst H2-luminous radio-galaxy, 3C326, was discovered by Ogle et al. (2007). It is one of the most
extreme H2-luminous sources (see Fig. 1.2). We will discuss this object in more detail in chapter 9.
3C326 is one example of a sample of H2-luminous radio-galaxies (selected such that z < 0.22) from
the 3CR11 catalog, reported in Ogle et al. (2009). They ﬁnd that, among 57 sources, 17 (≈ 30%)
have strong H2 rotational lines. These galaxies are the red triangles in Fig. 1.2.
In Fig. 1.4 we
show four examples of IRS spectra. Note the strong H2 lines, as opposed to the weakness of the
PAH features and the absence of silicate absorption. The summed H2 S(0)-S(3) line luminosities are
L(H2) = 1032 − 2 × 1035 W. Ogle et al. (2009) estimate the mass of warm molecular gas in these
galaxies to be12 M (H2) = 105 − 2 × 1010 M(cid:12).
Radio-galaxies have an AGN and a source of mechanical energy that is the AGN-driven jet. It is
not clear how the H2 luminosity is powered. The large majority (16/17) of these radio-galaxies seem
to belong to pairs or clusters (see the HST images on the right of Fig. 1.4). This suggests that galaxy

interaction may also play a role in powering the H2 emission, although radio activity may be triggered
by interactions.

Figure 1.5: The Perseus A (NGC 1275) and Zwicky galaxy clusters illustrate the presence of H2 in
the gas that ﬂows in/out galaxies. Left: In the Perseus A cooling ﬂow, luminous H2 line emission
(see inset spectrum, Johnstone et al., 2007) is associated with the network of ﬁlaments of ionized gas
in the halo ( Hα image Conselice et al., 2001). These observations suggest that the cooling of the
inter-cluster gas may occur through a phase transition from hot to molecular gas. Right: the top panel
shows an R-band image of the z = 0.3 cluster Z3146 taken with the ESO 3.6-m telescope with X-ray
ROSAT contours overlaid from Allen et al. (1996). The mid-IR spectrum shows powerful H2 line
emission (Egami et al., 2006).
Cooling ﬂows in clusters of galaxies
Spitzer observations reveal that warm (≈ 102−3 K) H2 is present in the central regions of galaxy
clusters. The most striking examples, shown on Fig. 1.5, are the Zwicky 3146 (Egami et al., 2006)
and the Perseus A (NGC 1275) (Johnstone et al., 2007) clusters. In the case of Perseus A, the H2
emission seems to be associated with an extended network of optical line ﬁlaments (see the beautiful
Hα image in Fig. 1.5), the so-called “cooling ﬂows”. These ﬁlaments are commonly found in X-ray

luminous clusters (e.g. Heckman et al., 1989), but their origin is still debated. de Messières et al.
(2009) report the detection with Spitzer IRS of strong H2 rotational line emission from nine cool-core
galaxy clusters, with surprisingly weak dust features in 6 (out of 9) of them. Again, the H2 detection
in these hostile environments show that warm molecular gas is coexisting with the hot (a few million
K) intra-cluster gas.
Elliptical galaxies
Kaneda et al. (2008) report the detection of strong H2 emission in a sample of dusty elliptical galax-
ies. These galaxies are reported in the left plot of Fig. 1.2 (light blue open circles). They also show
an enhancement of the
νLν (24 µm) luminosity ratio with respect to star-forming galaxies, in spite of
prominent PAH features. Many of them have radio-loud AGN. These elliptical galaxies were previ-
ously detected by the IRAS13 satellite (Goudfrooij and de Jong, 1995).
1.3 Main questions addressed in this dissertation
1.3.1 Astrophysical implications of observations of H2-galaxies
The observations of H2-luminous galaxies are puzzling for several reasons, and raise these two main
astrophysical questions:
Why is H2 present in violent phases of galaxy evolution?
First, in galaxy clusters or high-speed galaxy collisions like Stephan’s Quintet, the presence of large
quantities of warm H2 gas in a hot gas environment is unexpected. In starburst-driven winds like M82,
or AGN-driven outﬂows like radio-galaxies (3C326 in particular), it is not clear whether the H2 gas
is molecular material that has been entrained from the galactic disk by radiation pressure and/or the
outﬂow ram pressure, or whether it is formed in situ, meaning formed out of warm outﬂowing gas.
Observations of H2-luminous galaxies thus raise the question of the origin and the physical state of
the molecular gas in these environments. In particular, is the warm H2 physically associated with a
more massive reservoir of cold (T (cid:46) 100 K) molecular gas, as it is the case in “standard” galaxies?
How is the H2 emission powered?
In H2-luminous galaxies, H2 lines appear to have an unexpected contribution to the gas cooling. The
energy source powering the H2 emission and the dominant H2 excitation mechanisms remains to be
identiﬁed. In the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy collision, the astrophysical context is clearer than in distant
objects, essentially because it has been extensively observed, from X-ray to radio wavelengths. This
allows to study in more details the physics of the H2 formation and emission, and to infer a physical
framework to interpret other observations of H2-luminous sources.
In conclusion, the core of this thesis is to understand the origin of the H2 emission in these H2-
luminous objects, to identify and to study the underlying physical processes that drive H2 formation
and excitation in these hostile environments.

1. The discovery of a new population of H2-luminous objects
Why is the H2 gas inefﬁcient at forming stars?
In the introduction, we have stated that, up to now, H2 observations have been mostly associated
with stellar activity. H2-luminous galaxies are revealing molecular gas in a physical state where it
is inefﬁcient at forming stars, which does not straigthforwardly ﬁt with our current understanding of
the link between molecular gas and star formation. These H2 observations raise the question of the
identiﬁcation of the physical processes that inhibit star formation in H2-luminous galaxies. I have
addressed this question within the context of the Stephan Quintet galaxy collision (see chapters 5, 7
and 8), and the 3C326 radio galaxy (chapter 9).
1.3.2 What can we learn from H2 galaxies?
A common characteristic links the heterogeneous sample of H2-luminous galaxies presented above:
they are all in active and key phases of galaxy evolution, dominated by accretion, galaxy interactions,
energy plus gas ejection due to star formation or to the action of the central black hole on its environ-
ment (AGN feedback). The exceptional H2 luminosities observed in this variety of sources suggest
that molecular gas is “responding” to these active phases of galaxy evolution. The discovery of H2 lu-
minous galaxies then suggests that molecular gas has an important impact on the energetics of galaxy
formation and evolution, which is, up to now, largely unexplored. Most of the analytical models
or simulations that describe galaxy evolution within the context of cosmological structure formation
ignore the physics of the molecular gas.
Although H2 emission does not trace the bulk of the molecular mass directly, these H2 observa-
tions reveal key aspects of the energetic interplay between galaxies and the intergalactic medium, and
between stars and their nascent clouds, that are missed by CO observations. The low star-formation
efﬁciency observed in H2-luminous galaxies may also provide insights in the processes that trigger or
regulate star formation.
To sum up, H2-luminous objects may represent an unexplored step in galaxy evolution, which
provide insights in the role molecular gas plays in galaxy evolution.
1.4 Outline of the dissertation
The three following chapters present the background needed to tackle the problems raised above.
Chapter 2 discusses the dynamics and thermal properties of the multiphase ISM, as well as the result
of the calculation of the time-dependent cooling of a dusty plasma, taking into account dust destruc-
tion processes. In Chapter 3 I describe the properties of the H2 molecule, focusing on its excitation
mechanisms. The physics and chemistry of shocks in a multiphase ISM are presented in chapter 4. In
particular, the codes used to interpret the observations are introduced, with emphasis on some results
about molecular emission in MHD shocks.
In the second part of this dissertation, I essentially focus on the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy collision.
Chapter 5 presents the observational discovery of H2 emission in the group, and the scenario I propose
to explain the presence of H2 in this violent environment. Then I address the question of H2 excitation
(chapter 6), and extend the analysis to the emission from the ionized gas in the SQ shock. Chapter 7
present the results of an observational campaign I have conducted to search for the CO counterpart of
1.4. Outline of the dissertation
the H2 emission, and chapter 8 discusses dust emission. This part ends with chapter 9, which presents
an extension of this work to the H2-luminous radio galaxy 3C326, and discusses the role molecular
gas plays in galaxy evolution.
The third part of this thesis is dedicated to MIRI, the Mid-IR Instrument that will be part of the
scientiﬁc payload of the James Webb Telescope. Chapter 10 introduces the JWST and describes the
MIRI instrument, and chapter 11 presents my contribution to the testing of the instrument, focusing
on the analysis of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the instrument. In the context of the scien-
tiﬁc preparation of the guaranteed time projects for MIRI, we have proposed to use MIRI to study
high-redshift H2-luminous sources (chapter 12). Finally, I discuss the observational and theoretical
perspectives of this work (chapter 13).

Abstract
The astrophysical questions raised by the observational discovery of H2-luminous galaxies in-
volve the rich physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM). The presence and excitation
of molecular gas (H2) in the ISM heated by the release of mechanical energy on galactic scales
(e.g. galaxy interactions, starburst and AGN feedback, cooling ﬂows in galaxy cluster cores, etc.)
is related to thermal and dynamical interactions between the phases of the ISM. This chapter
gives an overview of the ISM phases and of the dynamical and thermal processes that drive mass
and energy exchange between these phase. As H2 forms on the surface of interstellar grains, dust
evolution processes are also described in the context of this dynamical picture. This chapters ends
with a description of the calculation of the cooling of a dusty, hot plasma. This result provides
interesting results on dust survval in a multiphase ISM, and will be used in chapter 5 to interpret
the observations of Stephan’s Quintet.

2.1 Introduction
Although William Herschel and Edward Barnard produced the ﬁrst images of dark nebulae sil-
houetted against the background star ﬁeld of the galaxy (e.g. Barnard, 1919), the ﬁrst direct
detection of diffuse matter in interstellar space was made by Hartmann (1904) through absorption
spectroscopy of the K-line of calcium at 3934 Å toward the line of sight of the δ-Orionis star. This
discovery lauched more than one century of studies on the interstellar medium (henceforth ISM).
2. Gas and dust in galaxies
The ISM, the matter that exists between the stars, plays a crucial role in astrophysics precisely
because of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales. The study of the ISM is closely
related to the lifecycle of stars. Stars form within molecular clouds, and replenish the ISM with matter
and energy when they die, through supernovae explosions, planetary nebulae, stellar winds, etc. This
interplay between stars and the ISM helps determine the rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous
content, and therefore its lifespan of active star formation.
Much of my PhD work is dedicated to the modeling of the formation of molecular hydrogen and
its emission in H2-luminous sources (these sources have been introduced in chapter 1). This involves
the physics of the gas and dust in the ISM of these galaxies. In particular, this modeling is based on
the heating and cooling mechanisms of the gas, and on the exchanges of energy between the different
phases of the ISM.
This chapter is not an exhaustive review of ISM physics. We direct the reader to the books by
(Dopita and Sutherland, 2003; Lequeux, 2005; Tielens, 2005) and to the review by Ferrière (2001). I
introduce here some of the key astrophysical processes on which we will rely in the following chapters.
In section 2.2 we present the different gaseous phases of the ISM and their interactions. Section 2.3
focuses on dust evolution in galaxies. Then I focus on the modeling of the cooling of a dusty, hot
plasma. This calculation is illustrated within the context of H2 studies in the multiphase medium of
the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy collision (see chapter 5), but (i) it can apply to many other astrophysical
situations, and (ii) it provides interesting results on dust survival in the multiphase ISM.
2.2 The multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies
Interstellar matter comprises of gas, mostly composed of hydrogen, and solid particles of dust that
contain half of the elements heavier than Helium, the so-called “metals” in astrophysics. The matter
consists of about 99% gas and 1% dust by mass. If the ISM ﬁlls most of the volume of a galaxy, it
only represents a tiny fraction of its mass (5% of the stellar mass, and 0.5% of the total mass of the
galaxy that is dominated by the dark matter).
2.2.1 Constituents, phases, and structure of the ISM
Because of the variety of processes involved in the ISM, an extremely wide range of physical con-
ditions are present in the interstellar gas. The average density of the ISM is 1 particle per cm3 in
the Milky Way Galaxy1, but this value varies by 8 orders of magnitude, from the hot (T > 106 K),
tenuous plasma produced by supernovae shocks, to cold (T < 10 K) prestellar condensations.
In table 2.1 we gather the physical conditions (density, temperature, etc.) of the different compo-
nents of the ISM. In the following I describe these components from an observational point of view.
This description, based on observations, is very schematic, the ISM properties being a continuuous
distribution.
The Hot Ionized Medium (HIM): this hot, ionized, volume-ﬁlling phase has been introduced by
Spitzer (1956) to explain the stability of the cold clouds that are not gravitationally bound.
This phase results mostly from supernovae explosions, that produce hot (105−7 K) bubbles of

In the schematic view (left), diffuse clouds have an onion-like structure, in which teneous and hotter
phases are surrounding denser and colder phases. The Spitzer image of the ISM in the Large Magel-
lanic Cloud (right) shows a contrasted view, where the ISM is a complex network of ﬁlaments, sheets
and cavities, structured by star formation.

2. Gas and dust in galaxies
expanding gas, or stellar winds. The gas at ≈ 105 K is predominantly traced by soft (< 1 keV)
X-ray emission and UV absorption lines (OVI, NV, etc.). Hotter gas (≈ 106 K) can be seen
through X-ray emission lines (OVII, OVIII). This diffuse, hot plasma phase is also characterized
by a thermal continuum (free-free ot free-bound) X-ray emission.
The Warm Ionized Medium (WIM): this diffuse phase is mostly produced by the ionization of the
diffuse neutral medium (by stellar radiation or shocks) or by ejection of matter from HII regions
(Yorke et al., 1989). This gas at 103−4 K is traced by recombination of forbidden line emission.
In the McKee and Ostriker (1977) view, the WIM is associated with the external shell of a cloud.
H II regions: unlike the HIM and the WIM, this hot, ionized gas phase is localized around the hot
stars (O- or B-type) that create ionized shells by their UV radiation. An idealized model for
these regions is the Strömgren sphere, which results from the equilibrium between the ionizing
ﬂux (> 13.6 eV) and the electronic recombination rate. Some of these regions can be compact
(less than 1 pc) or extremely extended (1 kpc or more) in case of very massive star clusters.
These regions are traced by free-free or free-bound emission (see the book by Osterbrock, 1989,
for details), like in the HIM, and by UV absorption and IR emission due to the heating of dust
by the star. Diverse optical recombination lines are also produced (like Hα) and also forbidden
lines ([NII], [SII], [OIII], etc.).
The Warm Neutral Medium (WNM): within the inner shells of the clouds, the gas is shielded from
the background ionizing radiation and is mostly neutral, while photoelectric heating maintains
the gas at temperatures around 8000 K. This phase is mostly traced by H I 21 cm line emission.
The Cold Neutral Medium (CNM): its atomic component is traced by the H I 21 cm line emission,
while UV absorption spectroscopy reveals diffuse H2 gas (Richter et al., 2003). This gas is cold
because it is denser than the WNM.
Molecular Clouds (MCs): these gravitationally bound structures result from the condensation of a
diffuse cloud under the effect of gravity. These clouds are dense enough for hydrogen to be
molecular (H2). MCs occupy a tiny fraction of the total ISM volume (1%), but account for a
substantial fraction of the total mass of the ISM (30 − 60%). Molecular clouds are structured
over a wide range of spatial scales, from giant complexes (GMCs) of more than 106 M(cid:12) and
sizes of 100 pc, to smaller condensations of 50 M(cid:12) (< 1 pc).
Classically, the ISM has been modeled by a mixture of different phases. Field et al. (1969) put
forward a static two-phase equilibrium model to explain the observed properties of the ISM. Their
modeled ISM consists of a cold dense phase (T < 300 K), made of clouds of neutral and molecular
hydrogen, and a warm intercloud phase (T ≈ 104 K), consisting of rareﬁed neutral and ionized gas.
McKee and Ostriker (1977) added a third phase that represents the hot (T (cid:38) 106 K) gas which is
shock heated by supernovae and constitutes most of the volume of the ISM. This schematic view
at the ISM is presented on the left panel of Fig. 2.1. These phases are associated with temperatures
where heating and cooling can reach a stable equilibrium, except for the hot phase which is metastable
and needs to be continuously replenished. Their paper formed the basis for further study over the past
three decades!
2.2. The multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies
Today, our view at the ISM is dynamical and based on numerical simulations. The dynamical evo-
lution of the multiphase ISM in galaxies has been extensively investigated with numerical simulations,
within the context of the injection of mechanical energy by star formation, in particular supernovae
explosions (de Avillez and Breitschwerdt, 2005; Dib et al., 2006). This injection of energy by su-
pernovae is shown to be able to maintain a fragmented, multiphase and turbulent ISM, in which the
gas phases are not in pressure equilibrium. Theoretical studies and numerical simulations of a super-
sonically turbulent isothermal gas show that the pressure may vary over two orders of magnitude, the
distribution function of the pressure values being lognormal, with a dispersion that increases with the
Mach number (Vazquez-Semadeni, 1994; Padoan et al., 1997; Passot and Vázquez-Semadeni, 1998;
Mac Low et al., 2005).
2.2.2 Structuring the ISM
The CNM, WNM, WIM and HIM form the diffuse ISM phases. In the McKee and Ostriker (1977)
equilibrium model, the diffuse clouds are structured like “onions”, or “Russian dolls”. Due to heat
conduction, the teneous phases surround the denser ones. However, as shown in Fig. 2.1, the ISM
structure is much more complex. It is organized in ﬁlaments, or sheets, continuously stirred by tur-
bulent motions. This structure is observed from large scales (see the Spitzer image of the LMC2 in
Fig. 2.1) to small scales around the solar neighbourhood. This self-similar structure is also observed
within molecular clouds (e.g. Falgarone, 2002).
It has often been proposed that the condensation of matter by thermal instability, that will be dis-
cussed in sect. 2.2.5, was the origin of the multiphase structure of the ISM (e.g. McKee and Ostriker,
1977; Wolﬁre et al., 1995). On the other hand, since almost 30 years, it is known that the ISM is a
turbulent medium (Larson, 1981; Scalo, 1987). Measurements of line velocity dispersions (Solomon
et al., 1987; Caselli and Myers, 1995) show that supersonic ﬂows permanently skim through the ISM.
These observations led to models where the ISM clouds are not the product of thermal condensation,
but the result of short-lived over-densities due to turbulent motions. It has even been proposed that the
pressure equilibrium between the ISM phases was not relevant for the ISM (Ballesteros-Paredes et al.,
1999; Vázquez-Semadeni et al., 2000). However, these statements are moderated by Hennebelle and
Pérault (1999); Audit and Hennebelle (2005), who show that thermal instability can be triggered by
large-scale motions in the ISM. Therefore, it seems that both thermal instability and turbulence are
not exclusive with each other in the role they play in the structuring of the ISM (e.g. Dib and Burkert,
2.2.3 Energy content of the ISM
The ISM is penetrated by photons and high-energy particles. In addition, it is dynamically tied to the
magnetic ﬁeld of the galaxy. I brieﬂy summarize here the main energetic components of the ISM
In the solar neighbourhood, the average total electromagnetic energy density is ≈ 1 eV cm−3. This
radiation is dominated by the UV and visible stellar radiation, and also the strong infrared radiation. In
addition, the cosmological blackbody radiation of the Universe at 2.7 K correspond to 0.26 eV cm−3.
2Large Magellanic Cloud
2. Gas and dust in galaxies
The average strength of the magnetic ﬁeld is B ≈ 5 µG (Heiles and Troland, 2005), which cor-
responds to an average magnetic energy density of ≈ 1 eV cm−3. Although partly organized at the
galactic scale, the magnetic ﬁeld in the ISM comprises of a random component and a regular compo-
nent, both of comparable strengths.
Cosmic-rays are high-energy (mostly relativistic) particles (electrons, protons, heavier atoms)
propagating through the ISM gas with little interactions (except at energies (cid:46) 0.1 MeV). Assuming
equipartition of energy between cosmic-ray and magnetic energy densities, the average cosmic-ray
energy density derived from synchrotron emission is ≈ 1 eV cm−3.
The kinetic energy may be non-thermal (for instance in case of supersonic motions of the gas) or
thermal, and the distribution between the two forms of kinetic energy depends on the gas phase. In
the CNM, the non-thermal energy is observed to dominate the thermal energy. Assuming an average
density in the solar neighbourhood of nH (cid:39) 25 cm−3 and a temperature of T (cid:39) 100 K, the average
thermal energy is ≈ 0.3 eV cm−3.
All the energy densities listed above (photons, magnetic ﬁeld, cosmic-rays, random motions) are
commensurate, and of the order of 1 eV cm−3 in the vicinity of the Sun. This is not a fortuitous
coincidence, but the result of energy transfers between this different forms of energy. Consequently,
although there are exceptions, one cannot neglect any of these energies, which makes the study of the
ISM so difﬁcult so exciting!
2.2.4 Mass and energy transfers between the ISM phases
The ISM is a restless medium. None of the ISM components introduced above is static in time or
space. A permanent exchange of matter between stars and the matter between them occurs in the
galactic disk, but also between the galaxy and the intergalactic medium. The interstellar matter is
thus constantly ﬂowing from one phase to another. Depending on the physical process , and on the
spatial scale we consider, the timescales associated with these mass and energy transfers can be very
different, from e.g. 106 yr to form a protostar out of its parent molecular cloud, to e.g. 109 yr to
consume all the molecular gas content by star formation on galactic scales.
The lifecycle of interstellar matter
The cycle of interstellar matter, sketched in Fig. 2.2, is closely related to the lifecycle of stars. Stars
are born in the densest regions of molecular clouds, when the gravity takes over the turbulent motions
and condenses the gas. During their life, they emit UV radiation and hot winds that create local HII
regions, and may eventually break through the parent cloud and fuel the WIM and HIM phases. Some
of these stars, at the end of their life, explode in supernovae. The supernovae shocks heat and ionized
the gas, enriching the gas with metals, and may eventually destroy the molecular cloud from which
they were born. When the ionizing source has switched off, recombination occurs and, in turn, the
WIM and HIM can cool. Under the effect of gravitational contraction, diffuse neutral and molecular
clouds may re-form. Within this dynamical picture of the gas evolution, the dust is also experiencing
a lifecycle, which contributes to its evolution and this to the evolution of the galaxy properties in
general. This will be discussed in sect. 2.3.
2.2. The multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies
Figure 2.2: The cycle of the interstellar matter within a galaxy. The ISM is not a passive substrate
within which stars evolve. It constitutes their direct partner in the “ecosystem of a galaxy”, continually
exchanging matter and energy with them.
It is the spatial distribution ot the interstellar material
together with its thermal and chemical characteristics that determines the locations where new stars
form as well as their mass and luminosity spectra. Therefore, the lifecycle of interstellar matter
governs the overall structure and emission properties of a galaxy.
To sum up, the physical processes involved in the mass and energy transfers between ISM phases
can be splitted into two categories:
Dynamical processes: large- and small-scale ﬂuid motions in a multiphase medium transfer momen-
tum and kinetic energy from one phase to another. Large-scale motions are dominated by galaxy
interactions, disk-halo circulation, galactic rotation, stellar-driven winds and supernovae, and
gravitational collapse of giant molecular complexes. At small scales, the dynamics of the ISM
is controlled by turbulence and ﬂuid instabilities (Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor). As
introduced in sect. 2.2.1, the fact that the structure of the ISM is fragmented and self-similar3,
3This property is true over four orders of magnitude in size, from galactic to proto-stellar scales.

2. Gas and dust in galaxies
suggest that turbulence plays an important role in the dynamical coupling between the different
scales of the ISM. The kinetic energy cascade from the bulk motions on large scales to small-
scale turbulence is a key aspect of ISM dynamics that is still poorly understood (see Elmegreen
and Scalo, 2004; Scalo and Elmegreen, 2004, for reviews about interstellar turbulence).
Thermal processes: thermal exchanges (heating and cooling mechanisms) correspond to a transfer
of thermal energy to or from atoms, molecules and ions of the interstellar gas. Most of the
heating mechanisms involves the release of a suprathermal particle (electron, molecule) from a
gas or grain specie by an energetic particle or a photon. This suprathermal particle heats the gas
by thermalization through collisions. The cooling mechanisms mainly occur through inelastic
collisions between light gaseous colliders (e−, H, H+, etc.) and heavier atoms, molecules, or
grains. If energy levels of these targets can be excited by the collider, the collider loses kinetic
energy and the gas cools by thermalization with the collider. The target then dissipates its
energy through the emission of radiation. In the neutral ISM, this line emission mostly occur in
the infrared (rotational or ﬁne-structure line emission of e.g. C+, C, O, H2, CO, H2O, etc. in
the cold phase). Except in dense molecular clouds, the opacity of the medium is small in the
infrared, so that the radiation can escape and the gas can effectively cool.
The heat conduction allows to redistribute the thermal energy content from one thermal phase to
another. Heat conduction occurs through electron conduction (collisions) or turbulent transport.
We will study these processes in more detail in sect. 4.5.2 when we will discuss the fate of
molecular gas in a hot plasma, which is particularly relevant for H2 studies in the multiphase
ISM of H2 galaxies.
Within a range of physical conditions (density, temperature), the gas is thermally unstable.
A dynamical or thermal perturbation can bring the gas from one stable phase to a thermally
unstable state which is sufﬁciently far from its initial state that it evolves towards another stable
phase. The thermal instability appears to be an important source of mass and energy exchange
between phases in the ISM. This process is discussed in the next section (sect. 2.2.5).
2.2.5 Thermal balance in the ISM
The ISM is shaped by the gas dynamics and thermal properties. As introduced before, the thermal
instability plays an important role in the physics and in structuring the ISM. Thermal instabilities
arises from the properties of the thermal equilibrium of the gas. I will not review here all the cooling
and heating mechanisms (see e.g. the book by Lequeux, 2005), but rather focus on the properties of a
thermally unstable gas.
Thermal instability
I will deﬁne the global cooling function [erg s−1 H−1], i.e. the net heat loss function, by:
L(ρ, T) = Λ − Γ ,
where Λ and Γ are the total cooling and heating rates, respectively. At thermal equilibrium we have
L(ρ, T) = Λ − Γ = 0, which determines the temperature of the medium for a given density. This

condition is plotted in the top panel of Fig. 2.3. Above the thermal equilibrium curve, the cooling
dominates the heating: Λ > Γ. Below, Λ < Γ. The bottom panel shows the main contributions to the
Λ and Γ functions.
The ﬁrst discussion of thermal instability in low-density media like the ISM has been made in a
classical paper by Field (1965). I will follow his analysis to derive the thermal instability criterion.
Let us consider a volume of interstellar gas (the system) in thermal equilibrium at (P, T) and introduce
a perturbation of density (or temperature) while keeping constant another thermodynamic variable, A,
for instance the pressure or the density. Since the entropy of the medium is deﬁned by
(cid:20) ∂S
(cid:21)
E being the internal energy of the system. The perturbation yields to a change δL in the cooling
efﬁciency:
Rewriting Eq. 2.2, the associated change δS in the entropy can be expressed as follows
L −→ L + δL
which can be re-written as
d(ln|δS|)
d(δS) = −
δL dt ,
(cid:21)
(cid:20) δL
This equation gives the time-evolution of the perturbation of the entropy of the system. If this per-
turbation δS grows with time, the thermal equilibrium of the system is unstable. This criterion of
thermal instability can thus be written as
(cid:21)
(cid:20) δL
(cid:21)
(cid:20) δL
(cid:20) δP
(cid:21)
(cid:21)
(cid:20) δL
For the isobaric case, A = P, and since TdS = cPdT, the instability criterion can be re-written as
< 0 ⇐⇒
< 0 ⇐⇒
The last form of the instability criterion4 can be interpreted by looking at the top panel of Fig 2.3. Let
us consider the green point, located in the portion of the equilibrium curve where its slope is negative.
If density increases, the pressure of the system diminishes, and becomes smaller than the ambient,
external pressure. Thus the system is compressed, and the density further increases. The equilibrium
is unstable in this zone. This positive feedback will stop when the gas reaches a stable equilibrium
(the black point to the right in this case).

2.3. Evolution of interstellar dust
When thermal instability becomes bi-stability
The thermal instability is the core of the Field et al. (1969) two-phase model of the ISM, and I have
sketched the principle of the bi-stability in the top panel of Fig. 2.3. Let us consider again our green
point, at ((cid:104)P(cid:105), (cid:104)nH(cid:105)). Any perturbation will make the system leave this unstable equilibrium and
evolves toward a stable one. If the pressure of the system falls within the [Pmin, Pmax] range, Fig. 2.3
shows that there are three equilibrium conﬁgurations: an unstable one (green point), and two stable
(black points). The stable conﬁgurations are identiﬁed as the warm intercloud medium and the cold
atomic clouds by Field et al. (1969).
A few remarks need to be given about this simple model. First, the range of pressures observed in
the ISM is not always compatible with the unstable part of the thermal equilibrium curve. Secondly,
the pressure equilibrium is not always reached. This is the case at small scales, because the timescale
of the propagation of the perturbation (speed of sound times the length-scale) is shorter than the
characteristic interval between two perturbation (typically a few 105 yr for supernovae explosions,
yielding to sizes of 0.4 pc for the CNM and 4 pc for the WNM). Third, in the warm medium, the
cooling time is larger than the perturbation time, and therefore the thermal equilibrium may not be
reached for the WNM. In addition, note that the criterion for thermal instability has to be modiﬁed for
dynamical systems, out of thermal equilibrium. The interested reader can refer to Balbus (1986). And
last, depending on the cooling/heating process at work, the metallicity of the gas, the presence of dust
or not, the shape of the cooling function may vary as function of the environment, and sometimes it
may not exhibit and unstable part. We will come back to this point in sect. 2.4.
2.3 Evolution of interstellar dust
2.3.1 The importance of dust for our study of H2-luminous galaxies
Dust grains are nanometer- to micrometer-sized solid particles that are mixed with the interstellar
gas5. Although dust represents only ≈ 1% of the total mass of the ISM, it plays a central role in the
physics and chemistry of this medium. Dust grains are particularly important for our study for two
main reasons:
H2 formation: dust grains are the sites for H2 formation (this will be discussed in chapter 3). More
generally, dust grains act as catalysts for chemical reactions in the ISM.
Thermal balance of the gas: dust grains participate to the heating (via the photoelectric effect) and
the cooling of the hot gas (via inelastic collisions with electrons).
Within the cycle of interstellar matter (sect. 2.2.4 and Fig. 2.2), dust is prone to evolutionary
processes, being constructive and destructive, which lead to an exchange of metals with the gas. Dust
nucleation occurs in cool atmospheres of dying stars, in supernovae, and dust grains grow in size
in the ISM by condensation of metals. They are released to the diffuse medium by stellar winds or
5At the end of the 18th century, William Herschel made the ﬁrst observations of “dark nebulae” (dusty interstellar
clouds). It is only at the beginning of the 20th century that astronomers began to consider the absorption and scattering of
light by dusty clouds. Today, dust particles are known to be ubiquitous in galaxies.
2. Gas and dust in galaxies
supernovae explosions, where they experience processing (in particular by shock-waves). Dust is then
re-incorporated into newly-forming stars out of molecular clouds.
In the multiphase ISM of H2-luminous galaxies, we also expect dust destruction to occur. On
the other hand, the presence of dust is required for H2 formation. Therefore, within the framework
of my modeling of the gas cooling and H2 formation, I have been driven to study and model dust
destruction processes. I have carried on a detailed calculation of the time-dependent cooling of a
shock-heated dusty plasma, taking into account dust destruction. This calculation has been published
in the appendix of Guillard et al. (2009c) (hereafter paper I ) in the context of the Stephan’s Quintet
galaxy collision. Before presenting these results, that may apply to other astrophysical situations, we
introduce the properties of interstellar dust that are relevant for dust evolution modeling (sect. 2.3.2),
and the physical processes of dust destruction (sect. 2.3.3).
2.3.2 Dust composition and size distribution
The composition of dust is only loosely constrained by observations. The most direct information on
the composition of dust6 comes from spectral features observed in absorption or emission7.
Dust extinction and size distribution
The left panel of Fig 2.4 shows the extinction law (absorption plus scattering) from the Weingartner
and Draine (2001) model. The extinction Aλ, which is the ratio of the ﬂux I(λ) after crossing the dust
cloud to the incident ﬂux I0(λ), is, in terms of magnitude,
I(λ) = I0(λ) 10
−Aλ/2.5 = I0(λ) e
−τλ ,
where τλ = 0.921 Aλ is the optical depth. Observationally, the extinction is mostly obtained by
comparing the reddened spectrum of stars to the relevant intrinsic spectrum from a library of spectral
models (e.g. Fitzpatrick and Massa, 1990). This gives a relative curve, which is usually normalized
to the extinction in some broad spectral bands, like B and V. For instance, Aλ is often divided by the
color excess E(B − V ) = AB − AV or simply by AV like in Fig. 2.4.
The extinction curve provides constrains on the size distribution of dust particles. Mathis et al.
(1977) showed that the average interstellar extinction could be satisfactorily reproduced by a grain
model containing two components: graphite grains and silicate grains. Remarkably, the extinction
curve was reproduced very well if both grain components had power-law size distribution, so-called
M RN 8 distribution:
dni = AinH a
−3,5da ,
where dni is the number of grains of the species i which radii between a and a + da, nH is the
reference hydrogen nuclei density, and Ai is a normalization constant. This distribution is truncated at
a minimum grain size amin (cid:39) 50 Å and a maximum size amax (cid:39) 2500 Å. The right panel of Fig 2.4
6Although meteorites provide us with genuine specimens of interstellar grains for examination, these are subject to
severe selection effects, and cannot necessarily be considered representative of interstellar grains.
7The amplitude of the radiated electromagnetic ﬁeld from small dust particles depends not only on the incident radiation,
but also on the size, shape, refractive index and polarizability of the grain.

shows the MRN mass distribution, overlaid on calculations by Kim et al. (1994). Although big grains
are less numerous than small ones, they carry the bulk of the dust mass.
The extinction curve is often represented by plotting the optical depth per unit total hydrogen
column density NH. This quantity is linked to the extinction by the relation between the color excess
and the hydrogen column density: NH /E(B − V ) = 5.8× 1021 atoms cm−2 mag−1. We brieﬂy give
the principle of the theoretical calculation of the extinction law. The optical depth can be written as
(cid:90) amax
(cid:88)
Qe(ai, λ)πa2
i Ni(ai)dai ,
where Ni(ai) is the grain column density for the species i and Qe is the extinction efﬁciency. For
spherical particles of radius a, these quantities can be expressed from the absorption and scattering
cross sections: σa = πa2Qa and σs = πa2Qs. The calculation of Qa and Qs as a function of the
grain properties and the wavelength was ﬁrst performed by Mie (1908). The success of the Mathis
et al. (1977) grain model led Draine and Lee (1984) to reﬁne the optical constants and extend the
treatment into the mid- and far-infrared. In a more recent study, Weingartner and Draine (2001) added
very small carbonaceous grains which play a role in the UV extinction and IR emission (Fig. 2.4).

2. Gas and dust in galaxies
Composition of interstellar dust
Interstellar dust grain models have been improved for 30 years in order to ﬁt observational constraints
such as elemental abundances of the heavy elements, UV, visible and infrared absorption and scat-
tering properties, infrared emission, polarization properties of the absorbed and emitted light. The
models include a mixture of silicate grains and carbonaceous grains, each with a wide size distribu-
tion ranging from molecules containing tens of atoms to large grains (cid:38) 0.1 µm in diameter that can
be coated with ices in dense clouds (Désert et al., 1990; Li and Draine, 2001).
Immediately following the discovery of the 2175 Å bump by Stecher (1965), Stecher and Donn
(1965) pointed out that small graphite particles would produce absorption very similar to the observed
feature. However, the presence of crystalline grains is considered unlikely in interstellar space where
grains are exposed to cosmic rays. Other forms of carbonaceous grains (PAHS, amorphous carbons,
and organic mantles on silicate grains) are being considered.
The absorption feature at ∼ 9.7 µm is due to interstellar silicate minerals, these having strong
resonances near 10 µm due to the Si-O stretching mode. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact
that a 10 µm emission feature is observed in outﬂows from cool oxygen-rich stars (which would be
expected to condense silicate dust) but not in the outﬂows from carbon-rich stars (where silicates do
not form because all of the oxygen is locked up in CO). There is also a broad feature at 18 µm that is
presumed to be the O-Si-O bending mode in silicates (McCarthy et al., 1980).
The extinction curve is strongly modiﬁed when one looks along different directions, which probe
the spatial variations of the dust grain properties. Some of these variations may correspond to the
coagulation into bigger grains (Dominik and Tielens, 1997; Stepnik et al., 2003), or on the contrary
to some erosion or destruction of grains.
2.3.3 Dust processing in shocks
I focus here on the dust destruction mechanisms relevant for the calculation of the cooling of a dusty,
shock-heated plasma. I direct the reader to the review by Jones (2004) and references therein for
an exhaustive presentation of all the destruction processes in the ISM evoked above. For a detailed
modeling of dust evolution in shocks, please see the PhD thesis of Guillet, V. (2008).
The Fig. 2.5 gathers the mechanisms responsible for dust processing in shocked gas. Grain pro-
cessing arises from interactions between the grain and “particles” (grain, atom, ion, atomic nucleus,
electron, photon). They can be destructive, i.e. leading to a transfer of the grain atoms to the gas and
thus to a net mass loss from the grain, or non-destructive, the grain size distribution being modiﬁed but
the total dust mass conserved. These processes are counterbalanced by formation, like the accretion
and nucleation, but also coagulation between grains.
Destructive processes: destructive interactions can expulse directly atoms and ions from the grain
surface (via sputtering, ion ﬁeld emission9 or direct Coulomb explosion via extreme charging
effects, coming from electron-grain interactions or photoelectric effect), or vaporize/sublimate
the grain in case of (cid:38) 20 km s−1 grain-grain collisions. Vaporisation/sublimation via absorp-
tion of energetic photons (UV, γ) or interaction with cosmic rays, may also be an important
destruction mechanism for volatile material, such as ice mantles.

2.3. Evolution of interstellar dust
Figure 2.5: Overview of the dust processing in shocksa. The mechanisms are ordered as a function
of the impact velocity and separated in two groups: those which modify the total dust mass (forma-
tion or destruction), and those which affect the size distribution while conserving the total dust mass.
The small inset ﬁgures are from Borkowski and Dwek (1995) and show schematic description of the
processing of refractory grains: sputtering, craterisation (with partial vaporization), and catastrophic
fragmentation (accompanied with total vaporization). On the right of the cartoons the mass distribu-
tion of the fragments is sketched. Note that the velocity threshold for coagulation (that may lead to
formation of icy and organic mantles) depends on the grain size.
aThis ﬁgure is inspired from a slide of Vincent Guillet.
Non-destructive processes: Grain-grain collisions at velocities (cid:38) 1−2 km s−1 lead to fragmentation
(or shattering) of both grains (see Fig. 2.5 and Tielens et al., 1994). The size distribution of the
fragments is a power-law, suggesting that dust fragmentation in shocks is responsible for the
observed power-law (MRN) in the diffuse ISM. By deﬁnition, fragmentation is not a destructive
process. It re-distributes the dust mass towards smaller grains, increasing the total cross-section
of the distribution of grains, and therefore the optical and UV extinction.
In the following I will focus on the sputtering of grains by ion-grain interaction because it is the
dominant destructive process in a hot (T = 106 − 108 K) plasma (e.g. Draine and Salpeter, 1979b;
Dwek and Smith, 1996).

use in our calculation of the time-dependent cooling of a dusty plasma (see sect. 2.4). The solid line
shows the sputtering rates I adopt in my modeling (from Tielens et al., 1994). For comparison, the
dashed line show the exponential form (Arrhenius law) of Dwek and Smith (1996) that is practical
for analytical calculations. Impacts with H, He, C, N and O are considered in the calculations. Below
106 K, the sputtering of dust grains in a hot gas drops drastically.
Sputtering of interstellar grains
Behind a shock, gaseous ions impacting on a grain at high velocities will sputter atoms from the
surface layer. We distinguish 2 cases of sputtering, depending on the nature of the shock and physical
conditions of the environment.
• For high velocity (Vs > 300 km s−1), grains are dragged to rest with respect to the gas before the
postshock gas cools and compresses, so that sputtering arises from the thermal motion of ions
in the gas. It is then the most abundant H+ protons that dominate this thermal sputtering. This
case happens in a hot gas (T (cid:38) 106 K), for example in the postshock of a supernova-generated
bubble. Therefore, for Vs > 300 km s−1, thermal sputtering dominates over inertial sputtering,
so we ignore inertial sputtering. In this case, the grain sputtering rate is nearly constant for
T (cid:38) 3 × 106 K and strongly decreases at lower temperatures (see Fig. 2.6 and Draine and
Salpeter, 1979b; Tielens et al., 1994; Dwek and Smith, 1996). The rate of decrease in grain size
through sputtering is given by
(cid:88)
Ai (cid:104)Yi v(cid:105) ,
2.3. Evolution of interstellar dust
where msp and ρg are the average mass of the sputtered atoms and the density of the grain
material, Ai the abundance of impacting ion i and Yi is the sputtering yield10 of ion i. The
quantity (cid:104)Yi v(cid:105) is the impacting ion velocities v times the velocity-dependent yield averaged
over the Maxwellian distribution. Fig. 2.6 shows the sputtering rates I use in my modeling.
These yields are from Tielens et al. (1994). Then, assuming that the grains are spherical, the
rate of grain mass destruction by sputtering, ˙ms, can be easily calculated from ˙ms = 4πa2ρg ˙as.
• For low velocity (vs ≤ 300 km s−1) shocks, grains are moving at high velocities with respect to
the gas11. The relative gas-grain velocities result in atoms and ions collisions on grain surfaces.
These collisions lead to the so-called nonthermal or inertial sputtering. If a grain is moving
through a stationary gas, all particles incident upon the grain have the same relative velocity.
This occurs in shock waves where the gas is rapidly swept up but the dust lags due to its greater
inertia. In general, the He+ ions dominate the erosion process (Tielens et al., 1994; Jones and
Tielens, 1994).
In the case of inertial sputtering, the parametrization of the erosion rate of
the grain is more complex. I have followed the empirical approach detailed in Borkowski and
Dwek (1995) to compute the rate of destruction of a grain slowing down in a dusty gas. In the
following, I give the principle of this calculation.
The deceleration of a grain through the gas by collisions with the atoms or ions of the gas can
be written as
β π a2 ρ v2
where vg is the grain velocity with respect to the gas, m and a are its mass and radius, ρ is the
gas density, and β is the enhancement of the collisional drag in a plasma relative to that of a
neutral medium. The initial grain velocity is set to 3/4 of the shock velocity (Jones and Tielens,
1994). We take β = 1, which maximizes the dust destruction12. Therefore, our computation of
the dust survival is conservative. As the grain is decelerating through the gas, it also experiences
collisions with the other grains, which results in craterization or complete vaporization of the
grain (see Fig. 2.5). Along its trajectory, the rate of reduction of the grain mass is the sum of
the inertial sputtering and craterization rates:
= ˙mis + ˙mcr
For a given initial grain size, I have calculated the evolution of the dust-to-gas mass ratio by
integrating Eq. 2.12 and 2.13. The inertial mass sputtering rate is given by (Tielens et al., 1994)
˙mis = 2πa2msp vg nH
(cid:88)
and the mass erosion rate due to cratering collisions with dust particles (ﬁeld) of mass mf and
mass distribution n(mf ) can be expressed as (Borkowski and Dwek, 1995)
gvgYcr = −n(mf )πa2vgfcmg ,
˙mcr = −AmHn(mf )πa2
10The yield is the number of atoms ejected from the grain surface per incident particle.
11In this case, charged grains are betatron-accelerated, because of their gyration around the magnetic ﬁeld lines.
12The collisional drag of the grain in an ionized plasma can be enhanced (β > 1) because of charge effects (see Shull,
1978; Draine and Salpeter, 1979a)
2. Gas and dust in galaxies
where ag and mg are the radius and mass of the target grain, and vg is the relative velocity
between the target grain and the impinging dust particles (mf ). A is the mean atomic mass in
a.m.u. of a constituent atom of the fragments. Ycr is a dimensionless cratering yield equal to
mf v2/2Ecr, where Ecr is the speciﬁc energy in eV atom−1 for the ejection of one atom in a
cratering event. The quantity AmHYcr represents the average mass excavated in each collision,
which can be written as fcmg, where fc is the fraction of the target grain mass mg that is ejected
in the collision. We have adopted fc = 0.1 and Ecr = 2 eV for silicate grains (see Borkowski
and Dwek, 1995, for details).
I have described the physical processes that are taken into account for dust destruction and detailed
how I have calculated the evolution of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in the postshock gas. This calculation
was based on previous studies. Let us now couple this calculation to that of the cooling of shock-
heated gas.
2.4 Time-dependent cooling of a dusty plasma
In the extreme environments of H2-luminous galaxies, like the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy collision,
starburst- or AGN-driven winds, galaxy cluster cores, the warm H2 gas is coexisting with a hot (T >
106 K) plasma. I have computed the time-dependent cooling of a gas that is shock-heated to these
high temperatures. Initially, the gas is dusty, with a Galactic dust-to-gas mass ratio. The calculation of
dust destruction detailed above is coupled to that of the gas cooling. This calculation is presented in
the appendix of Guillard et al. (2009c). I brieﬂy remind the principle of the calculation and summarize
the main results, emphasizing some points that were not stressed in the paper.
2.4.1 Calculation method
The time-dependent total cooling function is the sum of the dust cooling (weighted by the remaining
fraction of dust mass at the time t) and the gas cooling contributions. From a range of postshock
temperatures up to more than 107 K, the isobaric gas cooling is calculated by integrating the energy

where µ is the mean particle weight (µ = 0.6 a.m.u for a fully ionized gas), ne is the electron density,
kB the Boltzman constant, fdust the dust-to-gas mass ratio, Λdust and Λgas are respectively the dust
and gas cooling efﬁciencies per unit mass of dust and gas, respectively. For the gas cooling efﬁciency,
Λgas, I use the recent non-equilibrium, isobaric cooling curves calculated by Gnat and Sternberg
(2007). The dust cooling efﬁciency (dust heating by electrons), Λdust is calculated following the
method of Dwek (1987). The calculation is stopped when the gas has cooled to 104 K.
At each time step, the fraction of dust remaining in the gas fdust, is computed in parallel to the
postshock gas cooling:

2. Gas and dust in galaxies
Indeed, at temperature hotter than ≈
gas is dusty, the dust is initially the most efﬁcient coolant.
3×106 K, the dust cooling function (blue curve on Fig. 2.7), dominates the gas cooling. This produces
a “ﬂash” of IR emission. The duration of this “ﬂash” depends on the initial gas temperature and dust-
to-gas mass ratio. This collisional heating of dust is likely to be responsible for the far-IR emission
in the intracluster medium of galaxy groups (see Popescu et al., 2000, for a model of dust emission
within the contet of the Virgo cluster).
Signiﬁcant dust emission from a hot gas does not last forever. As discussed in Smith et al. (1996)
and in Guillard et al. (2009c) (paper I), the dust cooling efﬁciency drops with time because of the
reduction of dust mass (black dashed line in Fig. 2.7). When the grains are signiﬁcantly sputtered, the
dust cooling efﬁciency becomes lower than that of the gas. This is why the total cooling curve (red
line) “rejoins” the gas cooling curve (black line). As a result, the cooling times of the dusty plasma
are signiﬁcantly longer than those calculated with a constant dust-to-gas mass ratio (see Fig. B.2 of
paper I). Consequently, the cooling timescale of the hot gas is longer than the survival timescale of
dust grains (see Fig. 2 of paper I).
Looking at the cooling functions shown on Fig. 2.7, we can see that the reduction of the dust-to-gas
mass ratio in a cooling plasma also favors the development of thermal instability. If the dust-to-gas
mass ratio was constant, the slope of the total (Λtotal = Λdust + Λgas) cooling function would be
almost always positive, whereas in the case of dust destruction, the total cooling curve has an unstable
part over a wide range of t emperatures, between ≈ 105 − 107 K.
Note that a signiﬁcant dust mass can still remain in the hot gas, because very large grains may
survive sputtering in the hot gas. These results are in very good agreement with that of Smith et al.
(1996), whom treat carefully the effect of the dust size distribution, but only consider thermal sputter-
ing (which is anyway the dominant destruction mechanism for shock-heated plasma by high velocity
(Vs (cid:38) 300 km s−1) shocks.

The H2 molecule
Some scientists claim that hydrogen, because it is so plentiful, is
the basic building block of the universe. I dispute that. I say that
there is more stupidity than hydrogen, and that is the basic
building block of the universe!

Abstract
The hydrogen molecule, H2, is the simplest and most abundant molecule in the Universe. H2 has
a key-role in many astrophysical processes, from galaxy formation in the primordial universe to
star and planet formation. As an efﬁcient coolant of the ISM, it is an actor of the formation of
cold and dense molecular clouds, the fuel for star formation, and participates to the formation
of more complex molecules. In this introductory chapter, we review the basic properties of H2,
highlighting its formation mechanisms and excitation processes. We also present the tools for
observing molecular gas in space, and detail how to derive key parameters of the gas physical
conditions (temperature, gas masses, ortho-to-para ratio, etc.) from observations.

3. The H2 molecule
3.1 Introduction: the role of H2 in the Universe
Today, molecules are known to be ubiquitous in the Universe, with more than 150 different
molecules detected in the interstellar medium (henceforth ISM). H2 is the simplest one, and
the most abundant in the Universe. From an astrophysical point of view, H2 is an efﬁcient cooling
agent in a large variety of environments, which is perhaps the “guiding thread” of this PhD work.
Therefore, H2 occupies a central place in astrophysics, from large- to small-scale processes. It is im-
pressive how such a simple molecule can touch most of the important questions in astronomy! In the
following list, I brieﬂy summarize some of the “hot topics” where H2 has a word to say.
• Stars are made from the gravitational condensation of molecular gas. Then H2 can be viewed
as the fuel for star formation. Consequently, the star formation efﬁciency in “standard” galaxies
correlates with the mass surface density of H2 gas. This translates in a relationship between
H2 and IR luminosities, which has been inferred from Spitzer data. Furthermore, these obser-
vations disclosed the existence of sources with enhanced H2 emission with weak spectroscopic
signatures (dust or ionized gas lines) of star formation (the H2-luminous galaxies presented in
chapter 1). In these galaxies, H2 seems to be a tracer of mechanical energy dissipation asso-
ciated with gas accretion, galaxy collisions, or feedback. This is the core topic of this PhD
• H2 was the ﬁrst neutral molecule to be formed in the Universe, and it had inﬂuenced the collapse
of the ﬁrst cosmological objects, and thus had an important impact on the energetics of the
formation of cosmological structures and galaxies (see chapter 9 and Abel and Haiman, 2000,
for a short review).
• Most of the baryons in the Universe are “dark”. Indeed, the mass of observed baryonic matter
(stars and gas) in galaxies makes up at most 8 % of the total mass expected from dynamics
or weak lensing studies (Fukugita and Peebles, 2004). Although alternative scenarii are being
proposed, H2 is now considered as a potential signiﬁcant contribution to the problem of missing
baryons in galaxies (e.g. Pfenniger et al., 1994; Combes and Pfenniger, 1997). Some of the
missing baryons may be in the form of H2 lying beyond the optical galactic disk. This gas
would have remained undetected in CO because it is metal poor, clumpy, or too cold to be seen
in emission. First evidence for the presence of warm H2 in the outer parts of galaxies comes
from the detection of H2 S(0) and S(1) emission with T ∼ 80 K in the outer disk of NGC 891,
as far out as 11 kpc (Valentijn and van der Werf, 1999).
• For a star to be made, the turbulent kinetic energy of the parent molecular cloud has to be dissi-
pated so that the gravity takes over and further condense the gas. The ranges of gas temperatures
(≈ 102−3 K) and velocities (≈ 1 − 10 km s−1) in the parent turbulent cloud make H2 a major
agent of the dissipation of this energy. Once stars have formed, they emit jets and winds that in
turn inject some turbulent kinetic energy in their nascent cloud. This stellar feedback process
remains largely unexplored. Again, H2, as a tracer of dissipative processes, is certainly a key to
understand what controls the star formation efﬁciency. The importance of H2 in star formation
is conﬁrmed by observations of H2 in galactic star forming regions (e.g. Orion), in protostellar
molecular outﬂows, or infrared luminous galaxies.
3.2. Portrait of the H2 molecule
• H2 is also a major ingredient of giant planet formation. Planets are thought to form in the
circumstellar disks that surround proto-stars and pre-main-sequence stars. Such disks, a natural
outcome of the star formation process, are composed of 99 % of gas (mostly H2) and 1 % of
dust. H2 is therefore the building block of giant planets. H2 dominates the disk mass and
dynamics while the dust is the main source of opacity and controls the thermodynamics of the
disk. H2 observations in protoplanetary disks may be used to constrain the scenario of planet
formation, which is, up to now, not well determined.
• H2 initiates a complex chemistry within the shielded interiors of dense clouds. Some of these
reactions take place at the surface of dust grains, and the formed molecules can become con-
stituents of protoplanetary disks, where they contribute to the formation of icy planetesimals
such as the comets in our Solar System. The richness of molecular chemistry in dense gas is
highlighted by observations of large organic molecules in proto-stellar cores heated by nascent
stars, where ices return to the gas, and in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars (e.g.
Cernicharo et al., 2001). H2, as tracer of the sites of formation of complex molecules, may be
a key to elucidate the open question about the connection between molecular species present in
circumstellar environments and those present in the ISM.
All these astrophysical questions are closely related to the dynamics and energetics of dense gas,
of which H2 is the main consituent. To understand why H2 is a probe as such a variety of astrophysical
processes, this chapter introduces the basis of the radiative and collisional properties of H2. We will
rely on these properties in the next chapters. Part of my PhD work is dedicated to the modeling of
H2 formation and excitation in the extreme environments of H2-luminous galaxies (chapters 5 and 9)
by mean of shock and chemical network models (Flower et al., 2003) described in chapter 4. While
going through H2 properties, I will give details about how some speciﬁc processes are treated in our
shock model. In particular, we discuss the ortho-to-para ratio of H2 (sect. 3.2.2), and describe H2
formation (sect. 3.3) and excitation mechanisms (sect. 3.4). This chapter ends with a discussion about
how to observe molecular gas in space (sect. 3.5).
3.2 Portrait of the H2 molecule
This section introduces some basic properties of the H2 molecule that are of astrophysical interest. We
direct the reader to Shull and Beckwith (1982) for an historical review, and to the specialized books
by Bransden and Joachin (1983) and Flower (2007) for a fully developed theory of rotational and vi-
brational excitation of linear molecules. In this manuscript, we will mainly focus on the rovibrational
transitions of H2 in its electronic ground state, denoted1 X 1Σ+
3.2.1 H2 rovibrational transitions
H2, the simplest molecule, consists of two hydrogen atoms linked by a covalent bond. H2 is an
homonuclear molecule, i.e. the barycenter of its electrical charges concides with its center of mass. So
1The notation is 2S+1Λ, where S = 0 or 1 is the total electronic spin and Λ is the projection of electronic orbital angular
momentum on the internuclear axis
3. The H2 molecule
Figure 3.1: Rovibrational energy level diagram for molecular hydrogen with rotational J states la-
beled. The S(0) to S(7) transitions available to Spitzer IRS observations are indicated with solid lines.
All “S” transitions are from the upper to lower J state with ∆J = 2. The v = 1-0S(1) transition com-
monly observed at 2.12 µm is plotted as a das hed line. Note that the S(7) transition traces a higher
upper excitation state than the 1-0 S(0) and S(1) lines commonly observed in the near-infrared. Taken
from Hewitt et al. (2009).
H2 has no permanent dipole moment and rovibrational transitions are forbidden electric quadrupole
transitions. Molecular hydrogen thus exists in two different forms, depending on the value of its
nuclear spin, S:
para H2 the S = 0 singlet state, where the two protons have opposite directions of spin (anti-
parallel). This corresponds to even values of J.
ortho H2 the S = 1 triplet state, where the proton spins are parallel to each other. This corresponds
to odd values of J.
The the parity (oddness or evenness) of the rotational quantum number J is constrained by the fact
that the nuclear wave function must be asymmetric under exchange of protons.
Another consequence of the absence of permanent dipole moment is that rovibrational transitions
within the X 1Σ+
g electronic ground state occur by electronic quadrupole radiation (∆J = 0, ±2).
These quadrupole transitions do not allow to go from one H2 form to another (from ortho to para).
Because the electronic potential is anharmonic, there are no selection rules for vibrational quantum

energy of the rovibrational levels are given by

(cid:19)
(cid:18)
(cid:115)
where B is the rotational constant of the molecule and ω is characteristic vibration pulsation, and
 = h/2π the reduced Planck’s constant. B is related to the moment of inertia of the molecule, I,
and ω can be expressed as a spring pulsation:
and ω =
where µ is the reduced mass (here it is half the mass of an hydrogen atom, µ = 0.5mH) and k is the
spring force constant of the Hooke’s law. Because H2 is a light molecule, it has a small moment of
inertia, and therefore a large rotational constant B/kB = 85.25 K. Its rotational levels are thus widely
spaced. The diagram of Fig. 3.1 shows the level energies of the v = 0 and v = 1 vibrational states
of H2, with the relevant lines for our study. The J = 2 state lies 510 K above the J = 0 state, and
J = 3 lies 845 K above J = 1. Consequently, the rotational excitation of H2 becomes important only
for temperatures T (cid:38) 100 K. The v = 1 vibration level is ≈ 6000 K above the ground state, so that
rovibrational excitation (such as that at the 2.2 µm line) requires kinetic temperatures T > 1000 K.
The statistical weight of a given level is
g(J)g(I) = (2J + 1)(2I + 1)
gJ = 2J + 1
= 3 × (2J + 1)
for the para state
for the ortho state
Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the level populations are pro-
portional to the statistical weight and the Boltzman factor, so that the rotational partition function is
written
(cid:88)
−E(v, J)
However, because of the low temperature and density conditions in the ISM, the LTE hypothesis is
not valid, and the populations of the (v, J) levels do not follow the Boltzman distribution.
In this manuscript, we will mostly focus on the ﬁrst pure rotational lines of H2 (v = 0).
Table 3.1 we list the properties of the main rovibrational lines we will consider. These transitions
are within the near- and mid-infrared part of the spectrum. A transition is denoted by ﬁrst writing
the vibrational transition followed by the relevant branch and the lower rotational level. Thus the
transition from v = 1 to v = 0, J = 3 to J = 1 is written 1-0S(1). More generally, the S-branch
corresponds to ∆J = −2, the Q-branch to ∆J = 0, and the O-branch to ∆J = +2. Table 3.1 also
list the Einstein coefﬁcients (see Eq. 3.14) and line ratios assuming LTE (see Eq. 3.6) for 4 different
gas temperatures.

3.2.2 H2 ortho-to-para ratio
Deﬁnition and LTE values
The local H2 ortho-to-para ratio (hereafter o/p) is the relative abundance of the ground state ortho-
and para-H2. In conditions of LTE, this ratio can be written as
(LTE, T ) =
3(2J + 1)e
−EJ /(kBT )
(2J + 1)e
−EJ /(kBT )
(cid:88)
(cid:88)
At “high” temperatures, T (cid:38) 300 K, the o/p ratio tends towards the value of 3, which is the ratio of
the statistical weights of all the odd and even levels. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.2, where we show
the ortho-to-para ratio as a function of T . At low temperatures, T (cid:46) 50 K like in a quiet molecular
cloud, only the levels (v = 0, J = 0, 1) are populated, so that, at low T and in LTE conditions, the
ortho-to-para ratio can be written
(LTE, T (cid:46) 50 K) =
kBI = 170.5 K.
where we get 2 B

Z(J = 0)
= 9 × e
−170.5
The o/p ratio is an important astrophysical parameter to characterize the physical state, and the
history of the molecular gas. The o/p ratio of a given molecular cloud indeed depends on its age
and on the timescale of para-ortho conversion, τo/p. If the age of the molecular cloud is longer than
the o/p conversion timescale, the o/p ratio equals its LTE value at the given temperature (Fig. 3.2).
Otherwise, if the cloud age is shorter than the o/p conversion timescale, the o/p ratio keeps its value
during the process of H2 formation. Our model assumes that H2 molecules are formed with an o/p
ratio of 3, although this value is poorly constrained. The conversion mechanisms are brieﬂy discussed
in the following paragraph.
Ortho to para conversion
The conversion ortho-H2 ←→ para-H2 can occur through four main mechanisms:
3 , or other cations (Dalgarno et al., 1973):
H2(J = 1) + H+ (cid:29) H2(J = 0) + H+(+170.5 K)

3. The H2 molecule
Flower and Watt (1984) carried on detailed calculations of the evolution of the o/p ratio as
a function of the cosmic-ray ionization rate, which has an impact on the proton density, and
therefore on the rate of Eq. 3.9, and on the chemical history of the cloud.
2. the atom exchange between H2 and H:
H2(para) + H (cid:29) H2(ortho) + H
Schoﬁeld (1967) give an estimate of the collision rate of the order of
kH,H2 (cid:39) 8 × 10
−3900
−1] .
Because of the high activation energy of ≈ 3900 K, this process is negligible in cold molecular
clouds. In a cold dark cloud at T = 10 K, nH = 104 cm−3, for a typical cosmic-ray ionization
rate ζ = 5 × 10−17 s−1 H−1, and an initial degree of ionization of ≈ 10−8, it will take more
than 107 years to go from an o/p ratio of 3 to the equilibrium value at 10 K of ≈ 3× 10−7. The
conversion timescale is only weakly dependent on density (Kristensen et al., 2007).
However, this mechanism can be important, and even dominant, when molecular gas is subject
to heating and compression by a shock wave. Because the reaction 3.12 is rapid, the o/p ratio
in the hot postshock gas may differ signiﬁcantly from the o/p ratio in the cold ambient medium.
The evolution of the o/p ratio in shocks has been discussed by Wilgenbus et al. (2000). For
application of these studies to H2 observations in star forming regions, we direct the reader to
the PhD thesis by Kristensen (2007). The reactive collision rates used in the Flower et al. (2003)
shock model are more complex, and are described in Le Bourlot et al. (1999).
3. the interaction of the H2 nuclear spin with the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld at the surface of
dust grains (Tielens and Allamandola, 1987). An upper limit of the ortho-to-para conversion
rate by this process is given by the accretion rate of H2 onto dust grains, and Timmermann
(1998) show that this mechanism is inefﬁcient in low-velocity (a few 10 km s−1) molecular
shocks.
4. the ortho to para conversion may occur when an H2 molecule is destroyed and then reformed
onto the surface of a dust grain. However, given that the H2 formation is slow, this process is
negligible here.
3.2.3 Critical densities: H2 as a thermometer
The LTE hypothesis is valid when the density of the medium reaches a threshold density, so-called
critical density, ncrit, above which collisionnal deexcitations dominate over radiative deexcitations.
For a j → i transition, this condition can be written
where Aj→i [s−1] is the probability of radiative deexcitation (or so-called Einstein coefﬁcient), and
qj→i the probability of collisional deexcitation [m3 s−1]. Aj→i is proportional to (Ej − Ei)5, so for
nqj→i (cid:29) Aj→i = ncritqj→i ,
3.3. H2 formation and chemistry

tional line. The corresponding upper J levels are thermalized if the gas density is higher than ncrit.

high values of J, we have Aj→i ∝ J 5, which shows that the lowest energy levels (with smallest J
values) are thermalized ﬁrst.
This is illustrated in Fig. 3.3, which shows the critical densities, ncrit, at which the probabilities
of collisional and radiative deexcitation are equal, for the ﬁrst 7 rotational lines of H2 and the 1-
0S(1) rovibrational line. The collisional partner is H on the left panel and H2 on the right2. At a
given temperature, a given level is thermalized if the gas density is higher than ncrit. On the other
hand, if the gas density is much less than the critical density, collisional excitation is followed by
radiative decay, and so the collisional excitation rates determine the emission line intensities. The
critical densities decrease with temperature because the collision rates also decrease with T . Note that
higher densities appear necessary to thermalize rovibrational (not shown here) as compared with pure
rotational transitions.
The excitation and deexcitation collisional rates of H2 with H we use in our shock model are
discussed extensively in Le Bourlot et al. (1999, 2002); Wrathmall et al. (2007), and we also refer
the reader to the PhD thesis by Gusdorf (2008) for more details and calculations of ncrit with other
collisional partners (H, H2, He).
3.3 H2 formation and chemistry
In spite of the simplicity of the H2 molecule, its formation process in space has been a source of
puzzles since more than 40 years, and H2 formation is still an active research topic. I summarize here
some of the basic ideas about H2 formation that are crucial to have in mind for the next chapters, when
2Note that a similar ﬁgure can be found in Roussel et al. (2007), but the collision rates used in that paper are outdated,
which lead to signiﬁcant differences with the critical densities indicated here.

1Σ state is attractive whilst the 3Σ is repulsive. Figure taken from the book by Flower (2007), with
kind permission.
we will deal with H2 formation issues in the extreme environments of H2-luminous galaxies.
3.3.1 H2 formation in the gas phase?
We will brieﬂy demonstrate that the direct formation H2 with gaseous elements only cannot explain
the observed presence of molecular hydrogen in the ISM. The ﬁrst process would consist in a radiative
association of two hydrogen atoms:
H + H −→ H2 + hν (4.478 eV)
The Fig. 3.4 shows the electronic potential energy curves of an association of two hydrogen atoms as
a function of their distance. Initially, H atoms are unbound and their total energy E is positive. To
stabilize, the system must lose energy so that E (cid:54) 0. This formation process would be possible if the
molecule forms in a state that can deexcite to the ground state in order to lose its excess of energy by
the emission of a photon hν. However, Fig. 3.4 shows that a molecule formed by an encounted or two
H atoms may be formed in a repulsive state. Transitions between the 3Σ and 1Σ levels are forbidden
to electronic dipole radiation because they would involve a change in the total spin quantum number.
Rotational and vibrational transitions are also forbidden because H2 has no permanent dipole moment.
3.3. H2 formation and chemistry
Therefore, the molecule formed by radiative association can only dissociate. H2 cannot be formed by
radiative association of two hydrogen atoms.
The formation H2 in the gas phase (meaning only with gaseous collision partners) cannot occur
through three-body collisions, because the probability of a simultaneous encounter between 3 Hydro-
gen atoms is extremely small. When a sufﬁciant abundance of electrons and ions exists, ion-atom
reactions can be effective. Two routes for H2 formation are then possible. The “H+
2 route”, that is a
radiative association followed by a charge exchange reaction:
The alternative route is through H−, with a radiative attachment followed by a associative detachment:
H + H+ −→ H+
2 + hν
2 + H −→ H2 + H+
−→ H
+ H −→ H2 + e
These reactions require very high densities (comparable to the density of a star) to be probable and
contribute signiﬁcantly to H2 formation. Such processes are likely to be important for the chemistry
of the primordial Universe, and we direct the reader to Stancil et al. (1998); Galli and Palla (1998) for
more details, in particular about the reaction rates. However, densities in the ISM, even in the denser
molecular clouds, are too small for this process to be probable.
3.3.2 The H2 formation on interstellar dust grains
We have shown that the H2 formation in the ISM cannot occur only with gaseous contituants. To
overcome this difﬁculty, it has been proposed by Gould and Salpeter (1963); Hollenbach and Salpeter
(1971); Jura (1975) that interstellar dust grains play the role of catalysts for H2 formation:
grain + H + H −→ grain + H2 + Ef (4.478 eV)
The grain plays the role of the third-body in a three-body reaction. The mechanism for H2 through
grain surface reactions is poorly known, as well as the distribution of the energy released by the
formation, Ef ≈ 4.5 eV, among the internal, kinetic and grain energy components. The part that goes
into H2 internal energy contribute to H2 excitation, and we will come back to this point in sect. 3.4.3.
Two main mechanisms exist for the heterogeneous catalysis on a solid:
The Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction: H2 is formed by physisorption, i.e. through a reaction be-
tween two atoms (or radicals) that are already adsorbed on the grain surface.
The Eley-Rideal reaction: H2 is formed by chemisorption, i.e. by the direct interaction of an ad-
sorbed radical with an atom hitting it upon arrival from the gas phase.
In both cases, the H2 formation rate per unit volume can be written as
R(H2) = Rf (H2) × nH × ngr
−1] ,
3. The H2 molecule
where Rf (H2) [cm3 s−1] is the H2 formation rate, nH is the gas hydrogen density, and ngr is the
number density of grains. Empirically the H2 formation rate [cm3 s−1] is often expressed as:
Rf (H2) =
σvH × S(T ) × f × η
(cid:19)1/2
(cid:18) 8kBT
× S(T ) × f × η
(cid:29)
(cid:28) ngr(agr)
where σ is the average cross-section [cm2] of the interaction between H atoms and grains, vH is the
velocity of H, S(T ) is the temperature-dependent probability that an H atom sticks onto the grain
surface, f is the probability that the incident H atom stays on the grain and migrates towards the
other adsorbed H atom, and η is the probability of recombination to form H2. σ is calculated by
averaging the quantity
over the grain size distribution (agr is the grain radius). It is
generally assumed that the newly-formed H2 molecule has a probability of 1 to be ejected from the
grain because the potential wells of the physisorption (≈ 50 meV) and chemisorption (≈ 1 eV) are
much smaller than the energy released by the formation (4.5 eV).
Several expressions have been proposed for the dependence of the sticking coefﬁcient on the
temperature. In our model we use the following expression, given in (Hollenbach and McKee, 1979):
S(T ) =
1 + 0.04(cid:112)T + Tgr + 2 × 10−3 T + 8 × 10−6 T 2
where T is the kinetic gas temperature and Tgr is the grain temperature.
f = η = 1.
In addition, we assume
From UV observations of diffuse interstellar clouds with the Copernicus satellite3, Jura (1975)
estimates an H2 formation rate of Rf (H2) ≈ 3 × 10−17 cm3 s−1 at T = 70 K. For more details about
H2 formation and recent estimates of Rf (H2) from photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), we direct the
reader to the the PhD thesis by Habart (2001) and to Habart et al. (2004).
Note that, in cold clouds, the dust grains may be covered by ices, primarily composed of H2O and
CO, whereas in hotter regions, such as circumstellar environments or shock-heated gas, the icy mantles
evaporate. The nature of the grain surface affects the H2 formation rate, and an active experimental
work is being done on this topic (e.g. Pirronello et al., 1997; Manicò et al., 2001; Hornekær et al.,
2003; Amiaud et al., 2007).
3.3.3 H2, initiator of an impressive molecular complexity
We have stated in the introduction that H2 initiates the formation of more complex molecules in cold
clouds. Obviously, I will not review here the full theory of the formation of heavy molecules in the
ISM (see the book by Duley and Williams, 1984, for details). I will only brieﬂy give the tracks towards
this molecular complexity that we observe in the ISM.
In fact, the formation of molecules more complex than H2 requires the H+
3 ion, which is primarily
formed by cosmic-ray (CR) ionization of H2 (Herbst and Klemperer, 1973):

in a low UV radiation ﬁeld. Destruction is still dominated by photo-dissociation. From Nehmé et al.
(2008).
This reaction is rapidly followed by
2 + H2 −→ H+
Then, the way for complex chemistry is open. Heavier molecules can form via proton transfer reac-
tions. Let us give one example of a chain of reactions which leads to the formation of CO. The CO
formation routes are schematically illustrated in Fig. 3.5. One of the possibilities, the “H2O route”,
can be summarized as:
2O+ + 3H2 −→ 2H3O+
H3O+ + e
−→ H2O + H
C+ + H2O −→ HCO+ + H
HCO+ + e
−→ CO + H
CO is then formed! The importance of the CO molecule is stressed in sect. 3.5, and we will come
back to CO emission in Stephan’s Quintet in chapter 7.
3.4 H2 excitation mechanisms and diagnostics
Excitation of rotation-vibration levels of H2 can occur through different mecanisms, which can be
separated in three categories: collisional excitation, radiative (UV pumping) excitation, or excitation
directly in the process of forming the molecule. Obviously, it would be impossible to give an exhaus-
tive review about each processes here. We summarize the main ideas and classify these processes by
order of relevance for our astrophysical context. I also give a few details about the chemical reaction
rates incorporated in the shock model we use in the following chapters (in particular chap. 4 and 5).
3.4.1 Collisional excitation and dissociation
H2 levels may be excited by collisions in warm gas, and the resulting spectrum is often invoked as
an indicator that shocks are occurring. The calculation of the collisional rates is complex because
3. The H2 molecule
it involves detailed quantum mecanics calculations of the interaction potential between the collision
partner and the target. For a comprehensice description of the collisional processes in the ISM, we
direct the reader to the book by Flower (2007).
H2 collisions with atoms or molecules
The most important collisional partners for H2 excitation with atoms or molecules are the light and
most abundant partners H, He, ortho- and para-H2, that lead to rotational and vibrational excitation of
H2. The cross sections for rovibrational transitions of H2, induced by collisions with H and He atoms
have been discussed in Le Bourlot et al. (1999, 2002). An update of H2-H collision rates is given
in Wrathmall and Flower (2007). H2-H2 collisions are treated in (Flower, 1998). For the particular
interest of this PhD work, the reader will ﬁnd the cross-sections and rate coefﬁcients that are used in
our models for collisional excitation of H2 rotational transitions in the appendices of Flower (2007).
Collision with H can also lead to the dissociation of H2. The rate coefﬁcient calculated by Dove
and Mandy (1986) can be ﬁtted as a function of the temperature of the neutral ﬂuid, by the following
form (Flower et al., 1996):
diss.(Tn) = 10
−10 × e
−5.2 × 104
−1] ,
where the temperature of 5.2 × 104 K in the exponential corresponds to the dissociation energy of
H2 (4.48 eV). In our model, the above expression has been adapted to allow for the excitation energy
E(v, J) of the initial rovibrational level (v, J). The following rate is adopted in the code (Le Bourlot
et al., 2002):
diss.(Tn) =
10−10
(cid:88)
−(56 644 − E(v, J))
n(v, J)e
−1] ,
(cid:88)
where E(v = 4, J = 29) = 56 644 K is the energy of the highest bound level of H2, relative to the
v = 0, J = 0 ground state (Dabrowski, 1984). n(v, J) is the level population density. By deﬁnition,
n(H2) =
n(v, J) .
The rate coefﬁcient for the collisional dissociation of H2 by H2 is taken to be (Jacobs et al., 1967):
The rate coefﬁcient for the collisional dissociation of H2 by He is taken to be (Le Bourlot et al., 2002):

Cosmic-ray ionization of H2
H2 excitation by electrons is a process that occurs in the astrophysical context of the interaction of
cosmic rays or X-ray photons or cosmic rays with molecular gas. When X-ray photons or cosmic ray
particles (electrons, protons, and heavy nuclei) penetrate into a molecular cloud, photoelectrons or
secondary electrons are produced (see Padovani et al., 2009, for a review). Let us consider the direct
ionization of H2 by a cosmic-ray particle (electrons, protons, and heavy nuclei) impact:
H2 + CR −→ H+
The Fig. 3.6 shows the theoretical and experimental cross-sections for the impact of electrons onto
H2 from Padovani et al. (2009). The experimental data for electron-impact ionization of H2 have
been reviewed by Liu and Shemansky (2004). The curves show a semi-empirical model developped
by Rudd (1991). Note that the Bethe (1933) cross section for primary ionization of atomic hydrogen,
multiplied by a factor of 2, reproduces very well the behavior of the ionization cross section at energies
above a few tens of keV.
Collisional excitation of H2 by electrons
The scattering of these photoelectrons or secondary electrons on H2 molecules can lead to thermal
(Lepp and McCray, 1983) or non-thermal excitation to singlet and triplet electronic states of H2. The
triplet states lead to dissociation but in some fraction of the excitations the singlet states cascade down
3. The H2 molecule

We will show below that the H2 excitation by thermal electrons can be very important in shocked
molecular gas because of the shock-induced rise of the electron temperature. We give a brief review
of the theoretical studies about H2 excitation by collision with thermal and non-thermal electrons, and
we give some key-examples of excitation rates incorporated in the shock code we use later. The global
properties of the efﬁciencies of H2 excitation by cosmic or X-rays will be addressed in section 3.4.2.
The rate of production of secondary electrons by cosmic ray ionization of hydrogen is approx-
imately ζn(H2), where ζ is the cosmic ray ionization rate (a few 10−17 s−1 is a classical value in
molecular clouds) and n(H2) the number density of H2 molecules. Typically, ∼ 15 % of the sec-
ondary electrons subsequently excite H2 molecules by collision (Cravens et al., 1975; Sternberg et al.,
1987). Therefore the rate of H2 excitation by secondary electrons is 0.15ζn(H2).
We consider now the H2 excitation by thermal electrons. If we denote k1 the rate coefﬁcient for
the excitation of the singlet states, then the rate of excitation can be written as nen(H2)k1(Te). The
cross-sections for the excitation of singlet states of H2 by thermal electrons are linear as a function of
energy for the dominant B and C states (Ajello et al., 1984). Flower et al. (1996) provide the following
form for the rate coefﬁcient for electron excitation of the B and C states:

Therefore, the total rate of H2 excitation by (thermal + non-thermal) electrons, R1(Te) [cm−3 s−1],

This is the rate we use in our model for the H2 excitation by electrons. In eq. 3.36 we have assumed
that the gas is molecular, so n(H2) = 0.5nH. For a gas of density nH = 104 cm−3 and fractional
ionization ne/nH = 10−7, the H2 excitation rate by thermal electrons exceeds by a factor 106 the
cosmic ray electrons rate if we assume Te = 105 K. If Te = 104 K, the two contributions are com-
parable. More generally, because magneto-hydrodynamical shocks can easily increase the electron
temperature above 104 K, the photodissociation and photoionization of molecular species induced by
a shock wave can greatly exceed the rate of cosmic ray-induced processes (Flower et al., 1996).

the left) illuminates a molecular cloud (on the right). As we penetrate into the XDR, we indicate the
approximate temperature, chemical composition and ionization fraction xe as a function of the ratio
of the local X-ray energy deposition rate per particule, HX, to the total hydrogen density nH.
3.4.2 X-ray and cosmic-ray heating efﬁciencies
The excitation by X-ray photons was quantiﬁed by a number of authors (e.g. Voit, 1991; Tine et al.,
1997; Dalgarno et al., 1999). Let us estimate the maximum X-ray to H2 luminosity conversion factor.
We consider that an X-ray source heats the H2 gas (see Fig. 3.7 for a sketch of an XDR), by assuming
that 100 % of the X-ray ﬂux penetrates into the molecular gas. Models of X-ray dissociation regions
(XDRs) show that 30 − 40 % of the absorbed X-ray ﬂux goes into photoelectron heating (Maloney
et al., 1996). The atomic photoelectric cross section is a steep decreasing function of the energy
(E−8/3). Photoionization in the energy range 1 − 30 keV are the most important. At a temperature of
200 K for the H2 gas, the cooling by H2 rotational lines in XDRs models is ∼ 2 % of the total cooling
(see Fig 3a and 5 of Maloney et al., 1996). The maximum X-ray to H2 luminosity conversion factor
is therefore
L(H2 0-0S(0)-S(3))
LX(2 − 10 keV)
< 8 × 10
This estimate will be useful in the next chapter to see whether X-rays can power the observed H2
emission in the extreme environments of H2-luminous galaxies.
H2 heating by cosmic-ray ionization
We estimate the molecular heating associated with cosmic-ray ionizations (see sect. 3.4.1 for a de-
scription of the process). Each ionization of a hydrogen molecule is associated on average with
40.1 eV energy loss by electrons, of which 11 % ends up as heat (Dalgarno et al., 1999). This gives a
heating energy of 4 eV per ionization. This is the value adopted in the Meudon PDR code (Le Petit

et al., 2006). If we add the energy associated with the recombination of H+
3 that may follow the H2
dissociation, another 8 eV is released per recombination (Maloney et al., 1996). Thus, each ionization
of a hydrogen molecule is associated with the deposition of 12 eV into the gas. In the CLOUDY4
gas code, last described by Ferland et al. (1998), the heating efﬁciency increases with the ionization
fraction of the gas. For an ionization fraction of 10−4, a classical value for the diffuse ISM (Shaw
et al., 2005), the heating energy per H2 ionization is ≈ 7 eV . As the ionization rate per hydrogen
nucleus is half the H2 ionization rate ζH, the heating rate per hydrogen nucleus Γ/nH is ≈ 14 eV×ζH,
Γ/nH = 2.2 × 10
Using the cooling rates calculated by Neufeld et al. (1995) for n(H) = 104 cm−3 and N (H)/∆v =
1022 cm−2 km−1 s, the equilibrium temperatures are approximately 50, 150, and 300 K for ζH =
10−15, 10−14, and 10−13 s−1, respectively.
10−15 s−1 W .
3.4.3 Excitation during the H2 formation process
During the H2 formation process on grain surfaces (see sect. 3.3.2), the binding energy of H2 (≈
4.5 eV, or 51 000 K) is released and partitioned among the grain (internal heating), kinetic energy of
the ejected H2 (gas heating), and internal energy in H2 (i.e. the molecule is formed in a rovibrationally
excited state). Therefore, H2 excitation can also occur directly during the process of its formation.
How is the H2 binding energy divided between the constituents? What is the internal energy
distribution? What the ortho-to-para ratio of the newly-formed molecule? In spite of many theoretical
work and experiments (e.g. Hornekær et al., 2003; Amiaud et al., 2007), all these questions remain
In our model, we choose to distribute the H2 binding energy with equipartition: one third of the
formation energy (1.4927 eV, or 17249 K) goes into internal energy of H2 and levels are populated
in proportion to the Boltzmann factor at a temperature of 17249 K. Another third goes into kinetic
energy and the last third goes into grain heating. In our model we assume that the H2 molecule is
formed with an ortho-to-para ratio of 3.
Several surveys of cold dark clouds have been performed to observe directly the H2 excitation by
formation, but so far without results (see Tiné et al., 2003, and references therein).
3.4.4 Radiative excitation of H2 (UV pumping)
When a UV source is present, for instance in Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs), H2 may be ex-
cited rovibrationally by ﬁrst being UV-pumped to an electronically excited state (Black and Dal-
garno, 1973; Black and van Dishoeck, 1987) via the Lyman and Werner transitions within the range
912 − 1110 Å(see also Hollenbach and Tielens, 1997, for a review about dense PDRs). The excited
molecule will then deexcite (ﬂuorescence) back into vibrationally excited levels of the ground elec-
tronic state. If the densities are not too large (nH < ncrit ≈ 104−5 cm−3) these levels will cascade
down through rovibrational transitions. The corresponding UV spectrum has been calculated by Stern-
berg (1989). This ﬂuorescence occurs with a probability of ≈ 90 %. If nH > ncrit, the collisional
4http://www.nublado.org/
3.4. H2 excitation mechanisms and diagnostics
deexcitation of H2 contributes to heat the gas. In ≈ 10 % of the electronic excitations, the molecule
will dissociate because the absorption of a UV photon is followed by a cascade towards rovibrational
levels of the ground electronic state.
3.4.5 H2 excitation diagrams
Excitation diagrams are a way to represent the SED of the H2 emission that provides a practical visu-
alization of the physical conditions of the emitting medium. We detail how one builds an excitation
diagram and we give canonical examples within the context of H2 emission in shocks.
Building excitation diagrams
Excitation diagrams plot the logarithm of the column densities of the upper H2 rovibrational levels
(v, J) divided by their statistical weights, ln(NvJ /gJ ), against their excitation energies, EvJ /kB,
expressed in K. The column density is expressed in cm−2. The statistical weight gJ = gs (2J + 1)
is the product of the nuclear spin statistical weight, gs, which has value of 1 and 3 for even and odd
rotational levels J, respectively, and the rotational statistical weight, which is 2J + 1.
Such diagrams are very useful to get a ﬁrst idea of the temperature conditions that exist in the
emitting gas. If one assumes that a given line is optically thin to H2 emission, one can calculate the
gas column density, N from the observed brightness of the line, I. The probability for spontaneous
emission is given by the Einstein A-coefﬁcient. The measured H2 line intensities IvJ are converted
into column densities NvJ as follows:
AvJ IvJ
where λ is the central wavelength of the line transition, AvJ the transition probability (Einstein co-
efﬁcient) for the rovibrational level (v; J), h is Planck’s constant, and c is the velocity of light in the
vacuum.
To estimate whether the assumption that the line is optically thin, we may calculate the optical
depth, τ, for a transition j → i between an upper j and lower i level:
λ3 NvJ
where ∆v is the linewidth (dispersion velocity) and gj, gi are the degeneracies of the upper and lower
levels, respectively. For the v = 0-0 S(1) transition we ﬁnd
(cid:18) 10 km s−1
(cid:19)(cid:18) NH
(cid:19)
τ = 3.94 × 10
1020 cm−2
Therefore the assumption that the line is optically thin to H2 emission is fulﬁlled for most of the
situations in the ISM.
Column densities can then be compared with those expected from thermal excitation. The method
is the following one. In a thermal distribution, NvJ is proportional to the statistical weight g of the

where ν is the frequency associated to the j → i transition, and n the level populations associated
to the connected levels. In a situation of local thermal equilibrium, the excitation temperature equals
that of the gas. For a uniform excitation temperature, the values ln NvJ = gJ should thus all fall
on a straight line plotted versus EvJ, with a slope proportional to T −1
exc. This diagram thus allows to
roughly estimate the temperature conditions in the emitting gas.
From an observational point of view, deriving the excitation temperature is a rough estimate of
the temperature conditions in the considered region. With this diagram, deviations from LTE can be
easily be probed. Generally, multiple temperature ﬁts are done, corresponding to several excitation
temperatures.
In a shocked medium, this reﬂects the distribution of temperatures involved in the
postshock medium.
Examples of observed H2 excitation diagrams
For illustration, we show in Fig. 3.8 two examples of observed excitation diagrams of pure rota-
tional H2 lines in very different environments. NGC 1333 (on the left) is a Galactic star forming
region comprising mutiple outﬂows (Neufeld et al., 2006; Maret et al., 2009). The diagrams show
a “zigzag” pattern, indicating that the ortho-to-para ratio is lower than 3, the high-temperature limit
(see sect. 3.2.2). In addition, the curvature of the diagram show that the observed values cannot be

ﬁtted with a single LTE excitation temperature. This suggest that the gas, shocked by the proto-stellar
outﬂows, is a mixture of multiple temperature gas components.
NGC 6240, an IR-luminous merger, shows the same non-linear decline of the H2 excitation dia-
gram than what is commonly seen in shocks within the Galaxy, as well as in external galaxies (e.g.
Rigopoulou et al., 2002; Lutz et al., 2003).
3.5 Observing H2 in space
3.5.1 Direct H2 observations
The ﬁrst detection of H2 beyond the Solar System was made by Carruthers (1970) through absorption
spectroscopy of UV light with a rocket-borne UV spectrometer. This discovery was followed by
UV observations with the Copernicus space mission that demonstrated the presence of the hydrogen
molecule in diffuse interstellar clouds (for a ﬁrst review on this subject, see Spitzer and Jenkins,
1975, and references therein). These observations revolutionized our understanding of the origin of
astronomical objects.
A decade later, Gautier et al. (1976) detected H2 in emission for the ﬁrst time through near-infrared
rovibrational lines from a massive young stellar object in the Orion Nebula. This demonstrated the
importance of H2 in dense environments as well. However, because of lack of sensitivity, such obser-
vations remained of limited scope over the next three decades. Today, the near-infrared rovibrational
transitions are routinely imaged from ground-based telescopes.
The H2 mid-infrared rotational transitions, which trace warm (≈ 102−3 K) molecular gas, must be
observed from space (see Fig. 3.9, right panel). Indeed, the Earth’s atmosphere is mostly opaque to the
mid-IR lines of ortho and para H2. For the transitions occurring at wavelengths where the atmosphere
is partially transparent, the thermal background from the warm telescope, its spectrometer, and the sky,
limit the sensitivity. The H2 infrared lines were observed by ISO and Spitzer with limited imaging
capabilities and low spectral resolution. The next future (≈ 2015) of mid-IR H2 observations will the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST, see Fig. 3.9) in which I am involved (see chapters 10 to 12).
On a longer timecale, the SPICA mission5 (Swinyard et al., 2009), an actively-cooled Herschel-like
telescope, would be capable of doing MIR and FIR spectroscopy at high spectral resolution with an
unprecedent sensitivity.
Boulanger et al. (2009) have proposed a mission to the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 call, so-called
× 20(cid:48)) observations of the lowest H2 rotational transition lines, S(0)
H2Ex, dedicated to wide-ﬁeld (20(cid:48)
to S(3), at high spectral resolution (up to λ/∆λ ≈ 30 000, in our Galaxy and up to redshift 2 − 3.
Actually, the start of my PhD work about modeling H2 formation and emission in active phases of
galaxy evolution was motivated by the preparation of this Cosmic Vision proposal, which was not

The bulk of the molecular hydrogen in a galaxy is cold (10 − 20 K), too cold to be seen in emission.
This is why the presence of cold H2 is inferred essentially from carbon monoxyde (CO) observations.
5Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics
3. The H2 molecule
Figure 3.9: Cold and warm molecular gas are observed with two different kinds of observatories.
Cold molecular gas is essentially derived from CO ground-based observations with single-dish radio-
telescopes or interferometers. On the other hand, the IR emission from warm H2 must be observed
from space. This ﬁgure shows a few examples (past, present and future) of these observatories, with
their basic characteristics (wavelength coverage, spatial and spectral resolution).
CO is the most abundant molecule after H2. Its dipole moment is small (0.1 Debye), so CO is easily
excited. The emission of the CO(1-0) line at 2.6 mm (corresponding to its ﬁrst level at 5.52 K) is
ubiquitous in galaxies.
The CO lines (mainly 1-0 at 115 GHz and 2-1 at 230 GHz) are observed with radiotelescopes
(see left panel of Fig. 3.9), being single-dish or interferometers. During my PhD, I have made use of
the IRAM 30m single-dish telescope. The high spectral resolution of radiotelescopes provides crucial
information about the molecular gas kinematics which, in general, cannot be inferred from mid-IR H2
line observations alone because of limited spectral resolution.
In order to derive the cold H2 masses, we generally assume a ﬁxed CO luminosity to H2 mass
conversion factor, the so-called X = N (H2)/ICO factor, where N (H2) is the column density of H2
and ICO the integrated CO line intensity. Several methods are employed to derive the X factor (see
Solomon and Barrett, 1991), leading to similar results. In our Galaxy, the most common value is

In extragalactic environments, the CO(1-0) line luminosity seems also to be a reliable mass tracer (e.g.
Dickman et al., 1986; Solomon and Barrett, 1991). This allows us to convert the integrated line ﬂux
of CO(1-0) line into molecular gas mass. Including a factor of 1.36 to account for helium, the gas

Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Nothing shocks me. I’m a scientist.

Abstract
H2-luminous galaxies appear to be in active phases of their evolution (galaxy collisions, galaxy
cluster cooling ﬂows, starburst- or AGN-driven winds, etc., see chapter 1) that release a large
amount of kinetic energy in the interstellar medium . Shocks are thus expected to be ubiquitous in
these media, and may account for a signiﬁcant, if not dominant, part of the powerful H2 emission
observed in these sources. Consequently, I have been driven to study H2 emission in shocks,
and use MHD shock models to interpret these observations. This has been done ﬁrst within the
context of the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy collision (chapter 5 and 6), and is being extented to other
astrophysical objects (chapter 9).
In this chapter, I present the necessary background on the
physics and chemistry of MHD shocks, as well as a few results extracted from the grid of shock
models I have built to interpret the observations. Then the discussion is extented to shocks in
inhomogeneous media. I focus on two situations: the evolution of a shocked dense cloud, and
the collision between two gas streams. The physical processes that control the evolution of the
shocked gas will be discussed, as well as recent results for numerical simulations.

4.1 Introduction
Shock waves are ubiquitous in the interstellar matter settled in galactic disks, but also in the inter-
galactic medium. They are produced by violent pressure disturbances such as star- or AGN-driven
jets and winds, supernovae explosions, collisions between molecular clouds or, at larger scales, be-
tween galaxies.
A shock wave is an overpressure region that propa-
gates in the ﬂuid at a supersonic velocity. These shock
waves accelerate, heat and compress the gas. This conden-
sation may lead to star formation, as it is the case for giant
shock waves propagating in the spiral arms of a galaxy. On
the other hand, shocks may have destructive effects on the
molecular clouds, thus quenching star formation, as it is
perhaps the case in AGN jets driven in the ISM of their
host galaxy.
Shocks have an important impact on the evolution
of the interstellar medium (ISM), from a dynamical but
also from a chemical point of view. By heating the gas,
shocks driven into molecular clouds initiate chemical reac-
tions that would not occur in peaceful, cold molecular gas.
These chemical processes play a role in the thermal bal-
ance of the shock, which in turn has an impact on the gas
dynamics.
H2 appears to be a dominant coolant of MHD shocks.
H2-luminous galaxies (chapter 1) are be precisely in some
of the energetic phases of strong dissipation of kinetic en-
ergy quoted above. Therefore, a large part of my modeling
work of the dissipation of mechanical energy involves the
physics and chemistry of shocks.
In the multiphase environment of these H2-luminous
galaxies, different types of shocks are expected. Fast
shocks, heating the gas to high (T ≈ 106 − 108 K), pro-
duce EUV and X-ray photons that photoionize the tenuous
medium. These shocks are one source of energy that pro-
duce the HIM1 in galaxies. On the other hand, low-velocity
shocks (typically (cid:46) 50 km s−1) are known to (i) initiate the
1Hot Ionized Medium, see chapter 2, sect. 2.2.1.

(ii) be a very efﬁcient process to excite molecules, especially H2, via collisions in the dense gas com-
pressed and heated by the shock.
To interpret the H2 observations presented in chapter 1, I have been driven to study the formation
of H2 during the cooling of a shock-heated gas, and H2 excitation in magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)
shocks driven into dense molecular gas.
I have used the Flower et al. (2003) shock model, a 1-
D2 MHD code coupled to a extensive network of chemical reactions, to build a large grid of shock
models for different values of key parameters such as the shock velocity, the pre-shock density, the
magnetic ﬁeld, etc. In particular, the results of the modeled emission of molecular hydrogen (whose
treatment is included inside the shock code) to the observations.
For a review about the physics and chemistry of interstellar shocks, I direct the interested reader
to Draine (1980); McKee and Hollenbach (1980); Chernoff (1987); Hollenbach and McKee (1989);
Draine and McKee (1993); Hartigan (2003). For a comprehensive and didactic presentation of hydro-
dynamical and MHD shocks, the reader will consult the PhD thesis (in french) by Guillet, V. (2008).
I assume that the reader is familiar with the basic properties of hydrodynamical shocks (in which the
magnetic ﬁeld is absent B = 0). This chapter ﬁrst focuses on the basic properties of MHD (single-
ﬂuid or multi-ﬂuids) shocks (sect. 4.2). I present the shock code and the grid of shock models I use in
the following chapters (sect. 4.3), and mainly discuss H2 cooling in MHD shocks (sect. 4.3.3). Then I
extend the discussion to shocks into multiphase media. I describe the evolution of a cloud (embedded
in a tenuous gas) that is overrun by a shock wave, from a theoretical and numerical simulation point
of view. Finally, I consider the collision between two gas stream and point out the main differences
between 1-D and 3-D models.
4.2 Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks in an homogeneous medium
In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, ubiquitous in the ISM, the shock wave satisﬁes not only the
equations of the ﬂuid dynamics, but also the Maxwell’s equations. The magnetic ﬁeld does not interact
the same way with charged and neutral particles, which can result in a decoupling of the charged (ions
and electrons) and neutral ﬂuids. Indeed, the magnetic ﬁeld modiﬁes directly the dynamics of the
charged particles3 (ions, electrons or grains), whereas it affects only indirectly the neutrals through
collisions with the positive ions (and electrons). Therefore, the magnetic ﬁeld and the ionization
fraction of the gas have thus an important impact on the structure of shock waves.
Before discussing the structure of MHD shocks, I shall recall the basic properties of the types of
MHD waves that can propagate in a plasma.
4.2.1 Waves propagating into a plasma
In a magnetized plasma, different types of waves can propagate at distinct velocities:
2One dimension
3For instance, if the magnetic ﬁeld is oriented parallel to the shock front, the Lorentz’s force will make the particles
girate around the magnetic ﬁeld lines, thus leading to a coupling of the charged ﬂuid to the magnetic ﬁeld.
4. Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Sound waves are (longitudinal) compression waves that propagate pressure disturbances at a speed
(cid:115)
where γ is the adiabatic index (the heat capacity ratio, with γ = 5/3 for a monoatomic gas and
γ = 7/5 for a diatomic gas). T is the gas temperature and ¯µ is the mean molecular mass4 in
atomic mass unit (amu).
Alfvn waves are transverse waves that propagate the distortion of the magnetic ﬁeld lines along these
lines (Alfven, 1950). Alfvn waves are thus incompressible, dispersionless waves. The neutral
species can propagate Alfvn waves because of their coupling to the charged ﬂuid. The Alfvn
speed of these waves are thus
(cid:115)
(cid:115)
for the neutrals and V c
for the charged ﬂuid ,
where ρn and ρc are the mass density of the neutral and charged (ions, electrons, grains) ﬂuids,
respectively.
Magnetosonic waves are longitudinal, compressible, dispersionless waves that propagate pressure
variations in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld lines. The propagation of these
waves involves variations of the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. In the neutral ﬂuid (most of the
gas mass), the magnetosonic speed is
(cid:115)
(cid:115)
4πρn (cid:39)
√4πρn
In the charged ﬂuid, magnetosonic waves can propagate at a speed
4πρc (cid:39)
√4πρc (cid:29) V n
In a typical molecular cloud, ρc ≈ 10−2ρn because the dust grains are charged. So V c
In the following I will only consider stationary shocks, where the structure of the shock (density,
temperature proﬁles) in the reference shock frame do not evolve with time. In addition, the direction
of the magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave, or parallel to the
shock front. In this case, the magnetic ﬁeld limits the compression of the gas at a maximum efﬁciency,
since the ﬂuid cannot ﬂow along the magnetic ﬁeld lines.

4.2. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks in an homogeneous medium
4.2.2 C- and J- type shocks
Depending on the intensity of B and the ionization fraction of the gas, we distinguish between two
types of MHD shocks, C- and J-types:
J-shocks: if the B is weak or absent, or if the ionization fraction of the gas is high, the collisional
coupling between charged and neutral particles is strong. These particles behave like a single
ﬂuid, coupled to the magnetic ﬁeld. The properties of these shocks are similar to that of the
hydrodynamical shocks. Across the shock front, the variables (pressure, density, velocity, etc.)
change abruptly (see the top plot of Fig. 4.1). The transition region, which scale is of the order
of the mean free path, is much narrower than the other dimensions in the gas. This transition
is treated as a discontinuity, where the change of the variables of the gas is discrete (J being
for Jump). The preshock and postshock values of the gas density, pressure and temperature are
related by the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions (see sect. 4.2.2).
C-shocks: if the magnetic ﬁeld is present and the ionization fraction low (typically xe = 10−7−10−8
in dense nH = 103 − 104 cm−3 molecular clouds), the neutral and charged ﬂuids are decoupled
from each other. These shocks are named multi-ﬂuids or C−shocks (Mullan, 1969, 1971), C
being for Continuous, because in this case the discontinuity is smoothed and the gas parameters
vary continuously across the shock front (see details below and Fig. 4.1).
Structures of C- and J-shocks
The Rankine-Hugoniot relations are conservations laws between any points behind and ahead of the
shock front. They do not give any information about the internal structure of the shock. This structure
depends on the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld and the ionization fraction of the gas, and has a direct
impact on the characteristics of the excitation of species in the shock, in particular H2. This is why
I brieﬂy discuss here the Fig. 4.1, which shows schematically the structure of a stationary shock as a
function of the preshock strength of the (transverse) magnetic ﬁeld.
As shown in Eq. 4.4, in a molecular cloud of density nH = 104 cm−3 and ionizing fraction
χ ≈ 10−5 − 10−9, magnetosonic waves propagate faster in the charged ﬂuid than the shock front.
Typically for this medium we have:
cs (cid:46) V n
A and V c
A < Vs (cid:28) V c
where cs is the sound speed, Vs is the shock velocity, V n
A being the Alfvn speed for the
neutral and charged ﬂuids, respectively. So, if the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld is high enough, the
information can be transported ahead of the shock by the charged ﬂuid, and a so-called magnetic
precursor appears. This precursor slows and compresses the charged ﬂuid of the preshock gas before
the arrival of the shock front, on spatial scales much larger than the mean free path. This magnetic
precursor decouples the neutral and charged ﬂuid, generating ambipolar diffusion. The resulting
friction between the ﬂuids heats mostly the charged ﬂuid. The variables of the charged ﬂuid are
continuous across the shock front, whereas those of the neutral ﬂuid are discontinuous. Such a shock
is called J-shock with magnetic precursor. This is the case (c) of Fig. 4.1.
4. Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Figure 4.1: Schematic structure of the velocity of a stationary shock wave in poorly ionized medium,
as a function of the local magnetic ﬁeld strength B0. B0 increases from top to bottom. The velocities
are given in the frame where the shock front is idle: Vn is the neutral velocity in the propagation
direction of the shock, Vi that of the ions and electrons. The preshock medium is on the left hand side
of the shock front, the postshock on its right hand side. L is the shock length, and Vims is the ions
magnetosonic speed given by Eq. 4.4 (the dust grains are ignored in this model). Taken from Draine
(1980).
If the magnetic ﬁeld is more intense, the magnetosonic speed further increases and the length
of the magnetic precursor, L, too. The exchanges of momentum and energy between the neutral
and the charged ﬂuids in the precursor are more important, and the neutral ﬂuid itself is likely to be
heated, compressed and slowed before the arrival of the shock front, through elastic collisions with
4.2. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks in an homogeneous medium
the charged ﬂuid. Because of this slowing down, the neutral ﬂuid also undergoes a velocity jump of
a smaller amplitude than in the situation where there is no magnetic ﬁeld. This is the case (d), in
Fig. 4.1.
When the magnetic ﬁeld strength is higher than a critical value, Bcrit, the ﬂow of the neutral ﬂuid
becomes continuous across the shock front. The discontinuity vanishes, and the shock turns into a C
shock (case (e) in Fig. 4.1).
Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for an adiabatic MHD shock
The jump conditions across an MHD shock or discontinuity are referred as the Rankine-Hugoniot
equations for MHD. Before giving these equations, let us recall some thermodynamical relations and
deﬁnitions. We denote by cP and cV the speciﬁc heats of the gas at constant pressure and volume
respectively. The adiabatic index is deﬁned by γ = cP/cV. In the case of a perfect gas, the pressure
P, density ρ and temperature T are connected by the classical equation
¯µ mH
where R = 8.31 J K−1 mol−1 is the universal gas constant, ¯µ is the mean molecular mass in atomic
mass unit (amu) and mH is the mass of an hydrogen atom. For an adiabatic evolution, the additional
relation holds:
where K is a constant. Apart from a constant, the entropy of a perfect gas is deﬁned as
S = cV log
P = Kργ
(cid:18) P
(cid:19)
We place ourselves then in the reference frame of the shock (the surface discontinuity is at rest),
and we take the sufﬁxes 1 and 2 to refer to the preshock and postshock regions, respectively. The jump
conditions are obtained by developing the conservation laws for mass, momentum, and enthalpy5,
with the few relations above (see e.g. the book by Shu, 1991):
(cid:18)
1 + P1 +
γ − 1
ρ1v1 = ρ2v2
= ρ2v2
(cid:18)
(cid:19)
2 + P2 +
γ − 1
(cid:19)
where v the velocity of the ﬂow in the reference frame of the shock, ρ the mass density, and P the
thermal pressure of the gas. The term B2/8π is the magnetic pressure that is added to the thermal
pressure in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld lines. The terms γP/(γ − 1) and B2/4π
are the speciﬁc enthalpy6 and the magnetic energy, respectively. The conservation of momentum

6entropy per unit volume.
4. Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
(Eq. 4.10) can also be viewed as the conservation of the sum of the ram pressure (ρv2) and the thermal
pressure P.
We remind that the preshock (respectively postshock) ﬂow is supersonic (resp. subsonic) in the
reference frame of the shock front. In this frame, the gas appears to be decelerated. Knowing the
Rankine-Hugoniot relations, and considering the relation deﬁning the entropy for a perfect gas (see
above Eq. 4.8), one can show that the entropy increases during the shock if and only if P2 > P1,
i.e. whenever a shock can form (e.g. Zeldovich and Raizer, 1966). It follows that all transverse shock
waves lead to compression of the gas. In the reference frame of the preshock medium, a ﬂuid parcel
that crosses the shock front, is compressed (P2 > P1), accelerated and heated (T2 > T1) by the work
of the pressure forces applied by the postshock gas, just behind the shock front.
Frozen magnetic ﬁeld
In the interstellar medium, the characteristic time of diffusion of the magnetic ﬁeld is generally much
longer than the characteristic time of advection. One can therefore assume that the ﬁeld is frozen in the
charged ﬂuid. The charged grains are also coupled to the magnetic ﬁeld because their slowing-down
time in the shock is longer than their timescale of gyration around the magnetic ﬁeld lines (Pineau des
Forets et al., 1997). For a one-dimension (1D) transverse shock, the jump relations for the magnetic
ﬁeld are the following:
B2 = B1
The compression of the magnetic ﬁeld follows that of the charged ﬂuid.
Compression rate and postshock temperature
Roberge and Draine (1990) gives the compression factor of the gas:
(cid:113)
2(γ + 1)
D2 + 4(γ + 1)(2 − γ)M
s + γM
D = (γ − 1) + 2M
where Ms = Vs/c1 is the sonic Mach number, Vs being the shock velocity (velocity of the shock front
in the reference frame of the preshock medium) and c1 the sound speed in the preshock gas. MA is
the Alfvn Mach number MA = Vs/VA.
For a single-ﬂuid MHD shock, the postshock temperature (and thus the postshock pressure) can
be expressed as a function of the compression factor χ = ρ2/ρ1 (Roberge and Draine, 1990):
(cid:18)
¯µ2V 2
(cid:19)
(1 − χ2)
More generally, in case of hydrodynamical shocks (B = 0), or single-ﬂuid MHD shocks, the
physical preshock and postshock quantities can be expressed as a function of the pressures P1 and P2,
or as a function of the Mach number of the shock Ms (see Landau and Lifshitz, 1959; Roberge and
Draine, 1990).
4.3. Modeling MHD shocks in molecular gas
4.3 Modeling MHD shocks in molecular gas
My interpretation work of H2 emission in H2-luminous galaxies has involved the use of a sophisticated
shock model developed by David Flower, Guillaume Pineau des Forts and Jacques Le Bourlot. The
ﬁrst paper describing the code is Flower et al. (1985), and the most recent developments are published
in Le Bourlot et al. (2002); Flower et al. (2003); Flower and Pineau des Forêts (2003).
I run a grid of shock models that I use to ﬁt the observations (see chapters 5, 6 and 9). In this
section, I present illustrative results for C and J shock models, and focus on molecular emission
(especially H2) in C shocks, which are relevant for our study.
4.3.1 The Flower et al. code and the grid of shock model
In a few words, this 1-D7 code integrates8 the dynamical and chemical rate equations, together with
those for the level populations of the rovibrational levels of the electronic ground state of H2. In my
grid of models, I use 137 chemical species, connected by a set of 1040 chemical reactions. The code
can be used to model hydrodynamic shocks or transverse MHD shocks (C- or J-type).
The code has been described extensively in many papers and PhD thesis, so I will not repeat this
description in this manuscript. The interested reader will consult Flower et al. (1985) for a ﬁrst de-
scription of the equations solved by the code, and to the PhD thesis by Guillet, V. (2008) for a detailed
formulation of these equations closer to the current version of the code. For a description of the treat-
ment of H2 in the code, please see Flower et al. (1986), Le Bourlot et al. (2002) and the PhD thesis
by Gusdorf et al. (2008) for comparison of the model predictions with observations of proto-stellar
outﬂows and a description of other chemical aspects. For the treatment of dust grains, see Flower
and Pineau des Forêts (2003) and Guillet, V. (2008); Guillet et al. (2009) for the implementation of a
sophisticated module that treats in details the dynamics and evolution of the dust.
Hypothesis
In this section I consider MHD shocks without radiative precursor, i.e. the shock velocities are low
enough (typically Vs (cid:46) 80 km s−1 in molecular gas Hollenbach and McKee, 1989). Shocks with
radiative precursor will be considered later in sect. 4.4. In the following, I list a few important features
and assumptions used in the MHD shock model I have been using.
Stationary shock: the model assumes that a stationary state is reached in the 1D ﬂow at velocity
vn(z) (neutrals velocity) in the z-direction, so that d/dt = vnd/dz. The ﬂow time, t, of the
neutrals is thus related to the distance, z, by the relation:
(cid:90) 1
The following results often present the physical quantities as a function of the ﬂow time.
7The Flower et al. code is a one dimensional code, i.e. it considers a plane-parallel geometry.
8The algorithm is base on the VODE integrator (Brown et al., 1989).
4. Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Preshock magnetic ﬁeld: we adopt the classical scaling relation for the preshock magnetic ﬁeld
strength:
(cid:114) nH
1 cm−3 ,
where b is the magnetic scaling factor and nH the preshock hydrogen density (nH = n(H) +
2n(H2). This expression is in agreement with the Zeeman effect observations of galactic molec-
ular clouds that lead to B ∝ n0.47±0.08
(Crutcher, 1999). This observational result seems to be
in agreement with numerical simulations of the condensation of molecular clouds under the ef-
fect of ambipolar diffusion (Fiedler and Mouschovias, 1993; Hennebelle et al., 2008), although
the densities considered in these studies (prestellar cores) are much higher than those we con-
sider here. For the following illustrative results, we adopt b = 1 for C-shocks, and b = 0 for
J-shocks (no magnetic ﬁeld).
For C-type shocks, the gas is treated as 3 ﬂuids consisting of neutral species, positively and
negatively charged species. We assume that the transverse magnetic ﬁeld remains frozen into
the charged ﬂuid of the preshock gas all through the shock (see sect. 4.2.2).
H2 is treated in a detailed manner in the code. The excitation mechanisms taken into account in
the model, as well as associated hypothesis, have been presented in chapter 3. We remind that
collisional excitation with H, H2 and He is included. When an H2 molecule forms on the surface
of a grain, we assume that the binding energy of H2 is distributed with equipartition between
heating of the grain, kinetic energy of the newly-formed H2 molecule, and internal energy of
Dust grains are assumed to be composed of olivine-like material, (same stoechiometry as MgFeSiO4).
The size distribution is assumed to be the MRN (Mathis et al., 1977) distribution dng(a)/da ∝
a−3.5, where dng(a) is the density of grains having a radius between a and a + da. The radius
is taken to be in the range of 10 − 300 nm. The total mass density (including mantles) of the
grains is taken to be 8.5 × 10−3 × 1.4 nHmH, where 8.5 × 10−3 is the dust-to-gas mass ratio.
The grain temperature is not calculated in the models but remains constant at a user speciﬁed
value. Here we use 15 K. The rate coefﬁcients for charge transfer with grains is also taken into
account into the model, allowing for the grain charge distribution to be calculated for each step
of the model.
In the version I use, gas-grain collisions are also taken into account (Flower and Pineau des
Forêts, 2003), which may lead to sputtering of icy mantles and grain cores. It is possible to
release the grain core elements (Mg, Fe, Si and O) into the gas phase through sputtering. Sput-
tering yields are given in May et al. (2000). It is an important process both in J- and C-type
shocks. In J-type shocks the high kinetic temperature ensures that sputtering is an efﬁcient
process, while in C-type shocks it is due to the velocity difference between neutral and charged
species.
An artiﬁcial viscosity is added to the terms of momentum and energy in the case of J-shocks. This
allows, rather than applying the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions at the shock discontinuity,
to integrate and resolve the discontinuity

Description of the grid of models
I have run a grid of C- and J- shock models by varying the shock velocity, preshock density, magnetic
scaling factor, initial H2 ortho-to-para ratio, and dust-to-gas mass ratio. This grid was primarily
designed to interpret the H2 observations in the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy collision, where we expect
signiﬁcant dust destruction (chapters 5 and 6). Note that the output also includes atomic lines such as
the intensity of the far-IR [O I]λ 63.2 µm line to be observed with the Herschel Space Telescope. The
Table 4.1 lists the range of physical parameters of the grid of shock models.
The initial abundances of the 137 species are determined before any shock model calculation,
by running a chemical steady-state model where we do not include adsorption on grains to avoid
complete freezeout of molecules onto grains. The output abundances of this chemical steady-state
model are then used as input abundances in the shock models.
I do not give here a complete review of all the model results of the grid, but I rather comment a few
examples. The comparison with observations is presented in the following chapters. For a description
of an other extensive grid of models, the interested reader may consult the PhD thesis by Kristensen
(2007).
In the following illustrative results, I have used the initial elemental abundances of Flower and

steady-state calculation. The initial repartition of the chemical species in the grain mantles can be
found in Table 2 of Flower and Pineau des Forêts (2003). The preshock medium is molecular gas at
nH = 104 cm−3. The cosmic-ray ionization rate is the standard value ζ = 5 × 10−17 s−1.
Impact of the chemistry on the shock structure
Fig. 4.2 illustrates the impact of the chemical processes on the shock structure. Chemistry plays a
role in the thermal balance of the shock, which in turn impacts the number of reactions the shock can
initiate and the reaction rates. Fig. 4.2 shows the difference of the results obtained with or without
taking the chemistry into account:
without chemistry, the ionization fraction varies only through the differential compression of the
ionized and neutral ﬂuids by the shock wave, and has the same value in the preshock and
postshock regions.
with chemistry, the ionization degree of the postshock in one order of magnitude lower. This is
essentially due to the neutralization of C+ into C, initiated by H2:
followed by a chain of reactions, which balance is
C+ + H2 −→ CH+ + H
CH+ + e
−→ C + H
Consequently, the ion-neutral coupling is weaker, hence broadening the size of the precursor
(the width of the shock is ≈ 5 times larger). Since the energy is dissipated on a larger region

as compared to the ﬁrst case, the maximum temperature is lower (here approximately twice
lower).
This shows that chemistry and hydrodynamics are coupled, and have to be treated in parallel.
Dust grains, through gas-grain interactions, have also an important impact on the physical and
chemical properties of the shock. They participate to the formation or removal of molecules of the
gas, and their inertia can modify the propagation of the shock9, especially in the case of C-shocks.
Some details about the nature and treatment of the grains in the model have been given in sect. 4.3.1.
A detailed review of the processes involving grains taken into account in the code, as well as their
impact on the structure of C-shocks can be found in Flower and Pineau des Forêts (2003). For detailed
calculations of the evolution of the dust size distribution in MHD shocks, please consult the PhD thesis
by Guillet, V. (2008).
4.3.3 Energetics and molecular emission in shocks
In this section, a few results from my grid of models are presented.
Energy budgets
Fig. 4.3 compares the energy budgets for two types of shocks (C and J) of the same energy. In the
reference frame of the shock front, the energy of the preshock gas is pure bulk kinetic energy. In
the hydrodynamic case (J-shock with B0 = 0), when the gas crosses the shock front, most (15/16)
of the bulk kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy. Then, at t ≈ 10−4 yr on the left panel
of Fig. 4.3, the shock dissipates its energy in radiation form (collisional excitation of species in the
shock, followed by radiative deexcitation).
9The mass of the dust grains makes the bulk of the mass of the ions.
4. Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
In C-shocks, the thermal energy stays low as compared to other forms of energy. The reason is that
the dissipation of energy is not instantaneous and occurs over a timescale comparable to the cooling
time through radiation. The heating of the neutral gas is due to inelastic collisions with the charged
ﬂuid. Unlike hydrodynamic shocks, part of the postshock gas energy is stored as magnetic energy.
This magnetic energy can even dominate the postshock energy budget for very low-velocity shocks
(< 7 km s−1 for nH = 104 cm−3). The internal energy corresponds to the excitation of molecules,
essentially H2.
Temperature, velocity and abundance proﬁles
Fig. 4.4 compares two shocks of same energy, one J- and one C-shock. The proﬁles show some
important physical quantities across the shock as a function of the ﬂow time. The reference frame
is the shock front. On the left colum we show J-shock proﬁle with no magnetic ﬁeld. On the right
column, we show C-shock proﬁles with a preshock B0 = 100 µG. The models are the same than
those used to make Fig. 4.3. In both cases, the shock velocity is Vs = 25 km s−1 and the preshock gas
density nH = 104 cm−3. To facilitate the comparison, the y-axis are the same for both shocks. The
x-axis has been extended to much shorter ﬂow times for the J-shock, as the physical quantities start
to vary much faster than for C-shocks.
The top panel of Fig. 4.4 shows the temperature of the neutrals and velocities (of the neutrals, Vn,
and the charged species, Vi in the case of the multi-ﬂuids shock). As discussed in sect. 4.2.2 (see also
Fig. 4.1), the gas is slowed down abruptly when crossing the shock front, whereas in C-shocks the
charged ﬂuid, and then the neutrals by friction, slow down progressively.
In C-shocks, the energy is dissipated over a longer timescale than in J-shocks, which implies that
the maximum temperature attained in C-shocks (≈ 2000 K here) is much lower than in J-shocks
(≈ 30 000 K). For strong (Ms (cid:29) 1) shocks with B = 0, the postshock temperature is given by (see
e.g. Draine and McKee, 1993):
(cid:18)
(cid:19)2
2(γ − 1)
(γ + 1)2
s (cid:39) 2.6 × 104
25 km s−1
where Vs is the velocity of the shock wave, µ the mean molecular weight, kB the Boltzmann constant
and γ the adiabatic index. γ = 7/5 in a fully molecular medium in which the internal (rotational)
degrees of freedom are thermalized. In the second member of Eq. 4.20, we indicate typical values for
shocks driven into molecular gas. Thus we assume ¯µ = 2.33 a.m.u. and γ = 1.44, since we take into
account the presence of atomic Helium10, with a fractional abundance n(He)/nH = 0.1.
The middle panel of Fig. 4.4 shows the evolution of the fractional abundances of a few important
species (H2, O, H2O, H, H+) in the shock. The J-shock is fast enough to dissociate H2 (4.5 eV),
but not enough to ionize signiﬁcantly H (13.6 eV). H2 molecules reform over a short timescale in the
postshock cooling gas, which releases energy in the gas, and induces a small “knee” at ≈ 300 K on
the temperature proﬁle.
Unlike J-shocks, C-shocks do not generate signiﬁcant dissociation of molecular hydrogen, as
shown on the proﬁles of the fractional abundances11. The most active molecular chemistry takes
10instead of γ = 1.4 for a pure H2 gas.
11The fractional abundances shown here are deﬁned relative to hydrogen: n(X)/nH.

temperature to 10 K.
place within these shocks, as the temperature jump is high enough to trigger endothermic chemical
reactions without disrupting the involved molecules. Therefore I shall concentrate on C-shocks.
Note that depletion of gaseous species onto dust grain surfaces in the postshock region reduces the
abundances of some of the newly formed molecules. This affects the thermal balance of the shock.
This is clearly seen for the cooling rates proﬁles of the J-shock, where cooling efﬁciency of all the
molecules drops at about t = 3 × 103 yr because of adsorption onto dust grains.
Both kinds of shocks generate an intensive grain processing, that is still the subject of studies
(Flower et al., 2003; Guillet et al., 2007), and depletion onto dust grain surfaces in the postshock
region. This depletion reduces the abundances of some of the newly formed molecules.
Cooling functions and main coolants
We now discuss the radiative properties of the shock. The bottom panel of Fig. 4.4 shows the local
cooling rates of the main coolants relevant for our study, as a function of the ﬂow time. Fig. 4.5
shows these cooling efﬁciencies as a function of the temperature of the cooling postshock gas. More
generally, the main coolants are O, H2, H2O, C+, OH, CO. Their relative contributions to the cooling
depend on the shock proﬁle, and determine the radiative properties of the shock, which are very
different in J and C shocks.
For J-shocks, the cooling is ﬁrst dominated by H2 over very short period of time, at high tem-
peratures where it experiences dissociation. Then, at ≈ 8000 K, the [O I]λ6300 Å line takes over.
When the gas has cooled down sufﬁciently, H2, H2O, O and C+ dominate the cooling. More pre-
cisely, at T ≈ 1000 K, the ﬁne-structure line [O I]λ63.2 µm dominates. Other important lines in this
temperature range are [C I], [N I]λ5200 Å, [C II]λ158 µm, [N II]λ121.8 µm, [S II]λ6731 Å and [Fe II].
At lower temperatures, the oxygen is converted into CO, H2O, and OH, which become the dominant
coolants.
For C-shock, H2 is the main coolant for T > 300 K, which is the excitation range of the mid-IR

rotational lines in which we are interested for our study. Remarkably, the cooling is dominated by
H2O emission at T < 200 K.
Line ﬂuxes
The Fig. 4.6 shows the integrated (down to 50 K) line intensities as a function of shock velocity,
for the two types of shock (C and J). Note that in J-shocks, the higher H2 rotational excitation
levels, like the corresponding upper levels of the S(5) and S(7) lines, are populated efﬁciently for low-
velocity shocks. For J-shocks of velocities such that 25 < Vs < 40 km s−1, the integrated intensities
are roughly constant with shock velocity, whereas for C-shocks, line ﬂuxes increases smoothly with
shock velocity.
Note that the [O I]λ 63 µm and 145 µm lines are good tracers to distinguish between the two types
of shock (see Fig. 4.6). These lines are particularly sensitive to low velocity (Vs (cid:46) 20) shocks, where
their intensities are much higher for MHD shocks than for pure hydrodynamical shocks (B0 = 0).
Examples of H2 excitation diagrams for C- and J-type shock models
The Fig. 4.8 shows theoretical H2 diagrams for our two shock models (see chapter 3, sect. 3.4.5 for
the deﬁnition and calculation of the diagram). This diagram is computed at a temperature of 50 K in
the postshock gas. If the gas temperature is below 50 K, almost no H2 emission is produced. The
integrated H2 line intensities at 50 K are converted into column densities using Eq. 3.39. I only show
on the plot the ﬁrst 8 rotational levels relevant for our study, corresponding to the upper levels of
the S(0) to S(7) transitions, plus three rovibrational levels, corresponding to the upper levels of the

B0 = 0 µG for the J-shock. The ﬁrst 8 rotational levels of H2, corresponding to the upper levels

C-shock, showing that pure rotational levels are not thermalized with rovibrational levels).
1-0S(0), 1-0S(1), and 2-1S(1) lines. The characteristics of these lines have been given in chapter 3,
Table 3.1.
This ﬁgure illustrates the impact of the type of shock on the excitation of H2. For the C-shock,
the rotational lines are much brighter than for the J-shock, because the temperature is lower and the
shock is broader, thus increasing the column density of emitting gas (see the bottom panel of Fig. 4.4).
The high temperatures reached in the J-shock favor the ro-vibrational lines. Note that if the J-shock
velocity further increases, the dissociation of H2 will be so important that the ro-vibrational excitation
will be much weaker.
To conclude, MHD low-velocity shocks, driven into molecular gas, are very efﬁcient in channelling
the kinetic energy of the shock into the rotational H2 lines. This characteristic is essential within the
framework of my interpretation of H2 emission in H2-luminous sources.
I have used these diagrams to characterize the excitation characteristics in H2-luminous objects,
such as the Stephan’s Quintet and the 3C326 radio galaxy. This will be discussed in details in chap-
ters 5, 6 and 9. Flower et al. (2003); Giannini et al. (2004, 2006) provide examples of celestial sources
(proto-stellar outﬂows, Herbig-Haro objects) for which use was made of such excitation diagrams to
describe both the type of shock that is occuring and the physical parameters in these regions.
4.3. Modeling MHD shocks in molecular gas
Figure 4.8: Evolution of the H2 ortho-to-para ratio and temperature (in blue, labeled on the right) for
a 25 km s−1 C-shock. Two initial values of the o/p ratio are shown: the Local Thermodynamical
Equilibrium (LTE) value at 10 K (3.5 × 10−7), and the high-temperature limit (3). The preshock
medium is molecular, at a density nH = 104 cm−3. The preshock magnetic strengh is B = 100 µG,
perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the shock.
Evolution of the H2 ortho-to-para ratio in C-shocks
So far, the initial H2 ortho-to-para ratio is assumed equal to the statistical equilibrium value of 3 in our
shock models. I also adopt this value in the following chapters because the H2 excitation diagrams
observed in Stephan’s Quintet or in the 3C326 radio-galaxy do not show any signiﬁcant departure
from this value, which would result in a systematic displacement of the ortho with respect to the para
levels (“zig-zag pattern”).
However, we have shown in chapter 3, sect. 3.2.2 that the LTE value of the o/p ratio is 3.5× 10−7
at T = 10 K, and 0.03 at T = 30 K. To justify the high value of the initial o/p ratio, I brieﬂy
discuss the timescale of H2 o/p conversion in shocks. This point has been discussed in more details
by Wilgenbus et al. (2000) and Kristensen et al. (2007).
Fig. 4.8 illustrates the evolution of the H2 o/p ratio in a 25 km s−1 C-shock, for two initial values
of the o/p ratio: 3.5 × 10−7 (the LTE value at 10 K) and 3 (high-temperature limit). In the case of
the low initial value, the interconversion between para- and ortho-H2 starts when the temperature is
rising, and, excepted within the ﬁrst 103 years, the evolution of the o/p ratio is similar for both cases.
The timescale of thermalization of the H2 o/p ratio is long, ≈ 4× 106 yr in this case, which is in good
agreement with Eq. 3.10.
As a result, if the molecular gas experiences multiple shocks, and if the time interval between two
shocks is smaller than the H2 o/p conversion timescale, the o/p will not have time to thermalize to the
low equilibrium value in the cold H2. This may be the case in the H2-luminous objects I have studied.
Note that there are objects that favor a low initial o/p value, like proto-stellar bipolar outﬂows for
4. Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
instance (Wilgenbus et al., 2000).
The initial value of the H2 ortho-to-para ratio has an impact on the H2 line brightnesses. Generally
speaking, the lower the initial o/p ratio, the lower the brightness is. This impact is a timescale effect,
and is more important in C-shocks than in J-shocks. The fact that the ortho-H2 levels cannot begin to
be populated until the temperature reaches ≈ 800 K causes a delay. This delay is responsible for the
lower brightness in transitions between ortho-levels at low initial o/p ratio. Inversely, the brightness
from transitions between para-levels is higher for low initial o/p ratio.
4.4 Fast shock models
So far, we have mostly discussed low-velocity shocks driven into dense molecular gas, that power
molecular emission. These shocks are well traced through rotational line emission of H2. Obviously,
much faster shocks are likely to occur in the violent environments of H2-luminous galaxies. Within
the framework of understanding their multi-wavelength observations, I have been driven to use an
other shock model that describes fast shocks with radiative precursor. This section brieﬂy discuss the
properties of these shocks, very different from the shocks discussed above.
4.4.1 Structure of a fast shock with radiative precursor
Fig. 4.9 schematically illustrates the structure of the fast shocks we now consider. In fast shocks, the
shocked medium emits UV of soft X-ray radiation that propagates in all directions, including that
of the preshock gas. This UV emission produces a radiative precursor that heats, dissociates (for
Vs (cid:38) 90 km s−1) and ionizes (for Vs (cid:38) 120 km s−1) the preshock gas before it is shocked (see
Hollenbach and McKee, 1989).
4.4.2 The MAPPINGS shock model library
In my PhD work, I have made use of the shock model library named MAPPINGS III, described in
Allen et al. (2008), which is an updated version of the MAPPINGS II code described in Sutherland and
Dopita (1993). I do not give a complete review of this model. Here I only present a short description
of the basic properties and underlying physics included or not included in the model. The theory of
fast, photoionizing shocks is described in Sutherland and Dopita (1993); Dopita and Sutherland (1995,
1996). I also direct the reader to the complementary book by Dopita and Sutherland (2003).
Modeling technique
Shocks with radiative precursor are difﬁcult to solve numerically because
1. the UV radiation inside the shock imposes to carry on radiative transfer calculations to compute
the ionization state of the gas, as well as the excitation state of the species in the shock
2. the shock has a feedback effect on the preshock gas in which it propagates. Therefore, one
cannot integrate the shock structure (meaning integrate the MHD and chemical rate reactions)
starting from any point in the preshock.
4.4. Fast shock models
Figure 4.9: Stationary proﬁle of a shock with radiative precursor, in the reference frame of the shock
front. In this reference frame, the preshock gas comes from the left at a high speed, and is slowed
down in the shock front (bottom), compressed (middle) and heated (top). The radiative emission of
the postshock gas produces a radiative precursor that heats and ionize the gas ahead of the shock.
Taken from Draine and McKee (1993).
The MAPPINGS 1-D code couples an MHD shock code to a radiative transfer photoionizing
code. At each time step of the integration of the dynamical conservation equations in the ﬂow, the
rate equations for non-equilibrium ionization, recombination, excitation, and radiative transfer and
cooling are solved at each time step of the ﬂow. A total of four iterations (shock integration followed
by calculation of the precursor) are performed to allow the temperature and ionization state of the
precursor gas to stabilize at a constant value.
The physics included in the code
The cooling and radiative emission is calculated using a very large atomic data set (16 atoms) which
allows treatment of all ionization stages (225 ions), up to fully ionized nickel.
• The atomic processes affecting the ionization balance of the plasma taken into account in the
code are photoionization, ionization by electron collision, charge transfer reactions, and various
forms of recombination channels, including radiative and dielectronic recombination,
• Radiative processes includes ﬁne-structure, inter-system, and forbidden emission, as well as
resonance transitions and continuum calculations. Fine-structure, inter-system and resonance
lines are approximated by a two-level system. The model assumes that the resonance lines are
4. Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
primarily excited by collisions. The continuum calculations includes free-free, free-bound and
two-photon processes.
• Additional heating and cooling processes, including recombination and Compton heating, are
integrated over the electron thermal distribution or the photon spectral distribution.
Physically, the ionizing radiation produced in the cooling zone behind the shock front shock is
mostly composed of thermal bremsstrahlung (free-free) continuum, resonance lines, bound-free con-
tinuum of hydrogen, and the strong hydrogen two-photon continuum produced mostly by the down-
conversion of Ly α photons trapped in the recombination region of the shock structure. Recombina-
tion lines and bound-free continuum from Helium and heavier elements are also contrinution to the
ionizing radiation of the precursor.
The hydrogen ionizing radiation ﬂux, LUV, integrated for all energies hν > 13.6 eV, and over
2π sr follows the following scaling relation (Allen et al., 2008):
(cid:18)
LUV = 2.44 × 10
which is almost scaled as nHV 3
What is not included: shortcomings

100 km s−1
1 cm−3
• Dust grains are ignored in these models. The shocks propagate in a dust-free gas. However, we
have seen in sect. 4.3 that grains have an important impact on the structure, and thereby on the
emission, of MHD shocks. The main difference is that in fast (> 200 km s−1 shocks, the dust
destruction is expected to be very efﬁcient. As shown in chapter 2, sect. 2.4, if the postshock
temperature is hotter than ≈ 106 K, dust grains may affect the initial stages of the cooling of
the postshock gas, and thus the structure of the shock. However, their cooling efﬁciency will
drop rapidly because of thermal sputtering.
• Molecules are not included although the computation of the shock structure is allowed to
proceed until the gas has cooled to 1000 K. Therefore, the cooling functions are valid for
T (cid:38) 104 K.
The shock model library is available online12. In my PhD work, I have used this library to produce
diagnostics of mid-IR ﬁne-structure line ratios in order to contrain the physical properties of the ion-
ized gas in the Stephan’s Quintet. Examples of line ratio diagnostics and comparison to observations
are discussed in chapter 6.
I have also used these shock models to obtain a synthetic ionizing spectrum to model the emission
from dust that would be heated by this radiation. This modeling has been performed within the context
of the Stephan’s Quintet, and this is discussed in chapter 8.

4.5. Shocks propagating into an inhomogeneous medium
4.5 Shocks propagating into an inhomogeneous medium
So far, we have considered the ideal case of a shock that propagates in an homogeneous medium.
However, as introduced in chapter 2, the interstellar or intergalactic media have a multiphase and a
self-similar structure. The interaction of shock waves with density inhomogeneities (I will call them
“clouds”) in the ISM is thought to be an important dynamical process in a multiphase medium (e.g.
McKee and Ostriker, 1977). As discussed in chapter 2, it contributes to mass exchange between
the dense and diffuse phases. On one hand, it may trigger gravitational collapse and star formation
(e.g. Elmegreen and Scalo, 2004). On the other hand, shocks may have a net destructive effects on
molecular clouds, suppressing star formation.
Chapter 5 and Guillard et al. (2009c) (paper I) discuss the formation and excitation of H2 in the
context of the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy collision, where observations indicate that these processes
may be the response of a multiphase medium to a galactic-scale shock. It would be impractical to
give an exhaustive review of the abundant litterature on such a vast topic.
I will rather focus on
two situations that are relevant for the context of H2-galaxies, but also in many other astrophysical
environments: the evolution of a cloud hit by a strong shock wave (sect. 4.5.2), and the supersonic
collision between two gas streams of different densities and velocities (sect. 4.5.3). Before describing
these two situations and the associated physical processes, I shall recall a few properties of a shock
wave that encounters a discontinuity of density.
4.5.1 Reﬂexion and transmission of a shock through a discontinuity
When the propagation medium in which the shock wave is going through changes, the shock wave
may enter
1. a denser medium: a reﬂected shock wave is driven back into the postshock ﬂow of the incident
wave. A shock wave is transmitted into the dense medium, and the initial discontinuity is
accelerated. This case is schematically presented in Fig. 4.10. The reﬂected and transmitted
postshock gas, separated by the contact discontinuity, are in pressure equilibrium.
2. a less dense medium, or a medium that moves in the same direction of the shock: a rarefac-
tion wave is reﬂected into the postshock gas of the incident shock, and a transmitted shock is
produced. The contact discontinuity is also accelerated.
In the following I shall consider the case (1), illustrated in Fig. 4.10. I take the sufﬁxes i and
c to refer to the inter-cloud and cloud media. If the age of the incident shock is much shorter than
its cooling timescale (adiabatic shock), McKee and Cowie (1975) estimate that the velocity of the
transmitted shock into the cloud, Vc, is of the order of 13

where Vi is the shock velocity in the inter-cloud medium, and nc and ni are the densities of the cloud
and intercloud medium, respectively. The ratio between the densities in the two media is χ =

given in Klein et al. (1994a)

Figure 4.10: Reﬂexion and transmission of a shock through a discontinuity of density (cloud of density
nH = nc). The incident shock wave propagates in the tenuous inter-cloud medium (ni (cid:28) nc). The
incident shock is transmitted into the cloud and reﬂected into the inter-cloud medium because of
the abrupt density contrast. The initial contact discontinuity remains and is being accelerated at a
velocity Vcd in the direction of the propagation of the incident shock wave. The postshock media of
the reﬂected and transmitted shocks are in pressure equilibrium and propagate at the same velocity
Note that if the shock is isothermal, i.e.
if the shock has cooled down through radiation sig-

To conclude, a shock wave that hits a medium that is denser than its propagation medium, is
slowed down at the boundary of the dense medium (adiabatic phase) and then travels into the denser
inner regions of the cloud at a quasi-constant velocity (isothermal phase).

of the piston is lower than the shocked cloud (4ρi < χρi).

4.5.2 Evolution of a shocked molecular cloud
I will now introduce the relevant timescales for the description of the evolution of a cloud that is run
over by a fast shock wave, illustrated in Fig. 4.10. How does the shock wave propagate inside and
outside the cloud? What happens to the cloud? This section ﬁrst adresses these questions, both from
an analytical and numerical point of view.
This problem has been extensively studied by means of numerical simulations, which is the only
quantitative way to study the development of instabilities that are produced when the ﬂow of back-
ground gas establishes around the cloud and interacts with it. The 2D dynamical evolution of such a
cloud has been described in many papers, and I direct the interested reader to Klein et al. (e.g. 1994a);
Mac Low et al. (e.g. 1994); Poludnenko et al. (e.g. 2002).
It is important to realize that the evolution of a shocked cloud does not only depend only on the
dynamics, but also on its thermal and radiative properties. Thermal and radiative properties are just
being explored in multi-dimensional numerical simulations, and have been largely neglected in the
past. I will brieﬂy discuss these recent numerical results.
I shall consider here the case of a spherical, cooling cloud, of radius Rc and mass density ρc =
mHnc. The cloud is initially in pressure equilibrium with the inter-cloud medium (background gas).
The density contrast between the two media is χ = ρc/ρi > 1. The evolution of the shocked cloud
consists of three phases:
1. Initially, the shock runs over the cloud. The time scale for this is the shock passing time,
(cid:39) 2 × 105
(cid:18) Rc
(cid:19)(cid:18)
100 km s−1
(cid:19)−1
where Vi is the velocity of the passing shock in the inter-cloud medium.
2. The second phase is the compression phase, in which the cloud ﬁnds itself inside the high
pressure cocoon.
It is now underpressured compared to its environment. Shock waves are
transmitted into the cloud, and start to travel into it from all sides. The timescale for the cloud
compression is named the cloud crushing time and is simply given by
tcrush = Rc/Vc (cid:39) √χ
= 3.1 × 106(cid:16) χ
(cid:17)1/2(cid:18) Rc
(cid:19)(cid:18)
100 km s−1
(cid:19)−1
where Vc is the velocity of the shock travelling into the cloud, which can be calculated from
Eq. 4.22 (see sect. 4.5.1).
3. The third phase starts when the transmitted shocks have passed over the cloud. During this phase
the cloud is subject to both Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Meanwhile,
during phases 2 and 3, the radiative cooling of the cloud impacts the evolution of the gas, which
may also become thermally unstable. These processes lead to a fragmentation of the shocked
cloud, and the fragments may end up mixed with the inter-cloud gas. Taking a ﬁrst, qualitative
look at Fig. 4.11, one can clearly see the effect of fragmentation on the shocked cloud.
4. Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
In the following I discuss the key physical processes introduced above that control the evolution
of the shocked cloud and its fragments.
Cloud acceleration and growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities The growth of the Rayleigh-
Taylor instability15 is related to the acceleration of the cloud by the postshock background gas. The
acceleration timescale is the amount of time it takes to accelerate the cloud gas to the velocity of the
postshock background. Let us write the momentum transfer from an inter-cloud gas ﬂowing by a
spherical cloud (of cross-sectional area πR2
c ) at a relative velocity Vps,i. The postshock force acting
on the cloud can be written
F = πR2
cρi V 2
where I have assumed the jump condition ρps,i = 4ρi with γ = 5/3. Then the acceleration timescale
is given roughly by tacc = Vi/(F/Mc), Mc being the mass of the cloud. We ﬁnd that
(cid:39) 1.3 × 108(cid:16) χ
√χ tcrush
(cid:17)(cid:18) Rc
(cid:19)(cid:18)
100 km s−1
(cid:19)−1
The above equation show that it is very difﬁcult to couple dynamically dense gas with a background
ﬂow of tenuous gas. The crushing time to acceleration time ratio is tcrush/tacc = 3/4√χ, which shows
that as soon as the density contrast is higher than ≈ 102, the cloud will be compressed on a timescale
much shorter than the acceleration time. The growth timescale of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities is given
by tRT = (a k)−1/2, where a is the acceleration of the cloud and k = 1/λ is the wavenumber of the
perturbation (Chandrasekhar, 1961). In our case, a ∼ Vi/tacc, so we obtain
tcrush√k Rc ≈ tcrush .
Perturbation wavelengths such that k Rc ∼ 1 are the most disruptive16, so we conclude that Rayleigh-
Taylor instabilities develop on a timescale comparable to the crushing timescale, and more than one
order of magnitude shorter than the acceleration timescale for χ (cid:38) 100.
Growth timescale of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities A similar analysis can be applied to derive the
growth timescale of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities17, tKH. For a high density contrast (χ (cid:29) 1),
15The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (after Lord Rayleigh and G. I. Taylor), is an instability of an interface between two
ﬂuids of different densities, which occurs when the lighter ﬂuid is pushing the heavier ﬂuid. As the instability develops,
downward-moving irregularities (“dimples”) are quickly magniﬁed into sets of inter-penetrating Rayleigh-Taylor “ﬁngers”.
The upward-moving, lighter material is shaped like mushroom caps. This phenomenon is clearly visible in the Crab and
Helix nebulae.
16The growth rate of the RT instabilities is highest for the shortest wavelengths (λ (cid:28) Rc), but the amplitude of these

sufﬁcient velocity difference across the interface between two ﬂuids.
4.5. Shocks propagating into an inhomogeneous medium
tKH = √χ/kvrel, where vrel is the relative velocity between the postshock background and the cloud
(Chandrasekhar, 1961). Assuming that vrel ≈ Vps,i =
Vi, we obtain:
tKH (cid:39)
tcrush√k Rc ≈ tcrush .
As Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities growth on a timescale comparable to
the cloud crushing time.
To sum up, if we assume an adiabatic evolution of the gas, the timescales calculated above suggest
that the cloud is destroyed over a timescale comparable to the compression timescale, or crushing
time. Destruction is enhanced by the fact that the shocks travelling into the cloud meet and interact,
or reach the opposite boundary of the cloud. This produces a rarefaction wave travelling through the
shocked cloud material. The cloud, which was compressed by the hot cocoon, now starts expanding
again. This increases the pressure contrast between the compressed cloud and the postshock external
gas, effectively accelerating the growth of destructive instabilities.
Impact of the magnetic ﬁeld on the evolution of the shocked cloud Because of the coupling
between the magnetic ﬁeld and the cloud material, the magnetic ﬁeld may have strong effects on the
cloud evolution and on the development of instabilities. This effect is subtle, because it depends on
the local orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld in the inter-cloud medium.
If the background medium is magnetized, then magnetic ﬁeld lines can become trapped in defor-
mations on the surface of the cloud. As these ﬁeld lines are stretched, the magnetic pressure along
the leading edge of the cloud can increase enough to accelerate the disruption of the cloud through
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (Gregori et al., 1999). On the other hand, tangled magnetic ﬁelds
within the clouds would act to resist compression, potentially reducing cooling and enhancing cloud
destruction by shocks.
The left panel of Fig. 4.11 shows the results of two 3D MHD simulations, one being for a weak
magnetic ﬁeld, the other for a strong one (Shin et al., 2008). The effect of the magnetic ﬁeld seems
important only in the late stages of the evolution of the cloud. This ﬁgure illustrates that at late times,
strong ﬁelds substantially alter the dynamics of the cloud, suppressing fragmentation and mixing by
stabilizing the interface at the cloud surface. Even weak magnetic ﬁelds can drastically alter the
evolution of the cloud compared to the hydrodynamic case.
In addition, the topology of the magnetic ﬁeld has a strong impact on the thermal conduction for
clouds in hot (> 106 K) gas, because in this case the conduction is carried on by the electrons (see
the discussion about the thermal conduction below). Indeed, the magnetic ﬁeld channels the electron
conductivity along the ﬁeld lines.
Impact of the cooling of the cloud and thermal instability The above conclusion that clouds
are destroyed in a time comparable to the cloud crushing time is drastically changed if the cloud is
able to cool through radiative processes over a timescale tcool shorter than the dynamical timescale
of destruction, tcrush (Mellema et al., 2002; Fragile et al., 2004). Mellema et al. (2002) deﬁne a
cooling-dominated regime by tcool < tcrush
10 , in which the evolution of the cloud is dominated by
radiative processes. A simple estimate of the cooling time (Fragile et al., 2004) leads to the following
4. Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM

but a smooth density gradient. The density contrast between the cloud and the inter-cloud medium is

The initial cloud density is ρc = 1.7 × 10−24 g cm−3 (nc = 1 cm−3), with a density contrast of χ =
103. The bottom plot shows contours of the logarithm of gas density, in units of 6.7 × 10−27 g cm−3

which shows that cooling will generally govern evolution for moderate cloud densities and shock
velocities. However, sufﬁciently high shock velocities (Vi (cid:38) 104 km s−1) can suppress the effect of
cooling over the cloud destruction time. Cooling is also negligible at low densities (nc (cid:46) 10−4 cm−3
for Vi (cid:38) 103 km s−1).
Heating and cooling processes may generate thermally unstable gas in the cloud (see Fig. 2.3
or later in Fig. 4.13). The thermal instability adds to the Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities, and is an important fragmentation mechanism. The thermal instability has been discussed
in chapter 2, sect. 2.2.5). Below ∼ 106 K, the gas is thermally unstable. Numerical simulations
show that the thermal instability generates complex inhomogeneous structures, dense regions that
cool and low density voids (Sutherland et al., 2003; Audit and Hennebelle, 2005). This fragmentation

Shocks propagating into an inhomogeneous medium
occurs on the gas cooling timescale. In most numerical simulations, the thermal instability is ignored
because simplifying assumptions are made on the equation of state of the gas (adiabatic, isothermal
or polytropic evolution).
The lifetime of the fragments in the hot gas depends on their ability to cool. An efﬁcient gas
cooling stabilizes the clouds. As H2 is a major coolant in the warm molecular gas, it may have an
important impact on the survival of molecular clouds hitted by strong shocks. This is illustrated in
the right panel of Fig. 4.11, that shows numerical simulations of multiple clouds overtaken by a shock
wave that takes into account the radiative properties of the clouds, as well as primordial gas-phase
formation of H2. These simulations show that the cloud ﬁrst breaks into fragments. Because of the
cloud cooling, these fragments become dense enough to be able to survive over a timescale of the
order of a few million years Mellema et al. (2002); Fragile et al. (2004).
These numerical simulations ignore in particular the H2 formation on grains, which may greatly
enhance the cooling efﬁciency of the cloud, provided that dust can survive the transmitted shock. If it
is the case, the cloud fragments may be even further stabilized.
Thermal conduction and evaporation timescale The heat conduction has an important and subtle
impact on the evolution of the shock cloud. Depending on how the heat ﬂux is treated and whether
cloud cooling is included, heat conduction may or may not lead to the evaporation of the cloud frag-
The heat ﬂux is carried by electrons in hot or ionized gas, and by H in cold or warm neutral gas.
This heat ﬂux is proportional to the temperature gradient (Fourier’s law):
˙q = −κ∇T ,
which deﬁnes the thermal conductivity18 κ. In case of a steep temperature gradient between the cloud
and intercloud medium, the heat ﬂux is limited by the ability of the electrons or H atoms to diffuse
across the boundary. If the spatial scale of the temperature variation is smaller than the mean free path
of the electrons, the heat ﬂux saturates, and its value can be reduced up to a factor ∼ 10 as compared
with the classical heat ﬂux given by Spitzer (1962). The saturation of the conduction thus reduces the
evaporation of the cloud (Cowie and McKee, 1977).
In the case of saturated heat ﬂux, the rate at which the cloud evaporates can be written analytically
(Cowie and McKee, 1977; Klein et al., 1994a):
˙Mc ≈ 4πR2
c ρi ci
where ρi and ci are the mass density and sound speed in the inter-cloud medium. One can deﬁne an
evaporation timescale
˙Mc ≈
√χ tcrush
which shows that for χ ∼ 102, the clouds will evaporate in a time comparable with the compression
timescale (cloud crushing time).
18The mean free path of the specie that carries the heat ﬂux determines the temperature dependence of the thermal
conductivity: κ ∝ T 5/2 for electron conductivity and κ ∝ T 0.8 for H. Note that the charge transfer reactions strongly limits
the H mean free path. Thereby, ionization reduces conductivity in partially ionized warm gas.
4. Shocks and chemistry in the multiphase ISM
Vieser and Hensler (2007a) performed numerical simulations of static clouds embedded within a
hot gas, taking the saturated heat ﬂux. The main result is that the evaporation timescale is at least one
order of magnitude longer than the analytical value given by Eq. 4.37. The reason is that a transition
zone forms at the cloud edge in which the steep temperature and density gradients are reduced. This
results in a lower evaporation rate than predicted.
Simulations that include both thermal conduction and radiative cooling (and heating) processes
show an even more dramatic effect. The clouds can even gain material if radiative cooling exceeds
the energy input by heat conduction. Vieser and Hensler (2007a) show that matter from the hot inter-
cloud medium can condensate onto the clouds in a regime of cloud parameters where evaporation
is requested from the analytical approach. The reason is that the additional energy driven by heat
conduction from the hot background gas into the cloud can be transported away from the interface
and radiated off efﬁciently from the inner parts of the cloud.
Turbulent mixing Another important mean to transport the energy from the hot background gas to
the cool medium is through mixing of gas phases at boundary layers. This mixing is expected to occur
wherever there is a velocity shear is present at the interface of cloud phases. A schematic description
of such a boundary layer is given in Fig. 4.12. Such velocity shears occur in many astrophysical
situations, including outﬂows of hot gas driven into the ISM by supernovae explosions, starburst or
AGN, but also galaxy mergers, etc.
A turbulent mixing layer at the boundary of the cloud develops through the growth of Kelvin-
Helmholtz instabilities, that drive transverse waves along the boundary between the two ﬂuids. The
energy of these waves is dissipated at small scales, and a layer of gas at intermediate temperatures
is produced at the interface (see Begelman and Fabian, 1990; Slavin et al., 1993). The intermediate
temperature, ¯T, in the turbulent mixing layer is determined by the temperatures of the hot (Th) and
cloud (Tc) phases, the evaporation rate of the cold gas into the intercloud medium,
˙mc, and the
entrainment rate of hot gas into the mixing layer, ˙mh:
(cid:112)
˙mhTh + ˙mcTc
˙mh + ˙mc
where ζ is a dimensionless factor of the order of unity (see Begelman and Fabian, 1990). Typically,
for warm (T ≈ 104 K) clouds embedded within a hot (T ≈ 5× 106 K), the temperature of the mixing
layer is Tmix ≈ 105−5.5 K.
The intermediate-temperature gas may be thermally unstable and any dynamical disturbance will
cause the gas to rejoin the hot or warm phase (see Fig. 4.13). This length of the boundary layer is
obtained by assuming a stationary mixing layer, in which the energy ﬂux input by turbulent motions
is balanced by the cooling rate per unit area.
The right panel of Fig. 4.12 illustrates the situation of a cold neutram medium (CNM) cloud
embedded within a stream of hot gas. The two sub-panels compare the results with our without
thermal conduction. These simulations have been performed by J. Slavin (private communication).
When thermal conduction is ignored (right), the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are developped. The
comparison between the two ﬁgures clearly shows that the conduction reduces the growth rate of
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. When conduction is taken into account, the evaporative outﬂow pre-
vents instabilities from developing at the interface with the ﬂow. With conduction, the cloud is less

performed by Vieser and Hensler (2007b,a), and we direct the reader to those papers for a detailed
discussion of the impact of thermal conduction on the evolution of a cloud embedded in hot gas.
4.5.3 Supersonic collision between two gas streams
Let us consider now the collision between two gas streams at different densities and velocities. This
situation may be relevant in the case of galaxy collisions, where the ISM of the galaxies are colliding
with each other. I brieﬂy discuss the plane-parallel situation, which can be solved analytically, and
move to a brief discussion of numerical simulations that provide some useful feeling about how the
gas and shocks behave in such collisions.
Plane-parallel collision between two gas streams
We consider the situation of Fig. 4.14. Two plane-parallel ﬂows of preshock densities ρ1 and ρ2 are
colliding at t = 0, which produces the contact discontinuity (CD). Fig. 4.14 shows the situation where
ρ1 = 4ρ2, P1 = P2 and v1 = −v2. To simplify the expressions of the post-collision quantities, we

ties of a CNM cloud being destroyed by turbulent mixing in a WNM ﬂow. Points are gas parcels from
the hydro-dynamical simulation shown on Fig. 4.12, at t = 3.5 × 105 yr (J. Slavin, private communi-
cation). Part of the gas is located on the thermally unstable branch of the equilibrium cooling curve.
Dynamical processes (turbulent mixing) lead to departures from equilibrium (stable or unstable). The
WNM gas has a speed of 5 km s−1 relative to the cloud and a temperature 6 300 K. The initial cloud
density is nH = 55 cm−3 and its radius 0.1 pc. The cloud to hot gas density contrast is χ ∼ 100. The
ambient pressure is 3660 K cm−3. No thermal conduction is included in these simulations.
place ourselves in the case where the two ﬂows are identical, i.e. ρ1 = ρ2 (χ = 1). The case presented
in Fig. 4.14 is more general. The corresponding equations for the general case can be found in Lee
et al. (1996). Since the pressure and velocity are continuous across the surface discontinuity, we have:
P3 = P4 =
and v3 = v4 = vCD ,
where vCD is the velocity of the contact discontinuity. For this simpliﬁed case, the bulk kinetic energy
to thermal energy conversion rate can be written as
3 ρ1v3
2 ρ2v3
2 ρ1v3
which is the largest value attained for γ = 5/3 when the two colliding ﬂows are identical. The fact
that R is greater than 1 is not surprising. Since the postshock gas is at rest in the lab frame, all the
bulk kinetic energy of the gas that passes through the shock is converted into thermal energy. But the
shocks move outward from the discontinuity, so R is actually the ratio between the shock velocity
relative to the upstream ﬂow in region 1 to the shock velocity v1, which is 4/3 for γ = 5/3.
We will now consider the similar situation of the collision between two gas streams, but from the
point of view of 3D simulations. This allows to point out the main differences between the 1D and

postshock kinetic energy.
3D simulations of an oblique collision between two gas streams
Fig. 4.15 shows the result of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the oblique collision between two gas
streams. These simulations are performed by Lee et al. (1996) within the context of the collision
of gas streams produced by the disruption of a massive star around a black hole. Obviously, these
simulations do not directly apply to the SQ collision, in particular because in the simulations the
gas ﬂows are homogeneous and radiative processes are ignored. However, these simulations provide
interesting insights about the dynamical evolution of the ﬂows and the geometry of the shock fronts
produced by the collision.
The pressure map (left panel of Fig. 4.15) shows that oblique shocks are produced around the
initial contact surface. The position of these shock fronts are indicated on Fig. 4.15 by the solid red
arrows. In the case of a one dimensional (1D) collision of two stream at the same velocity vst, the
two shocks produced at the discontinuity surface propagate back to the upstream ﬂows at a velocity

is ∼ vst and the shock fronts stand off near the initial contact surface because the shocked gas can
escape in the direction perpendicular to the stream ﬂow. For instance, if we assume two identical gas

(right panel) show that the shocked gas is accumulated in a dense ridge (red rectangle) between the
shocks and accelerated into the ambient medium. This hot gas is expanding adiabatically and drives
other shocks in the background medium (dashed red arrows).
We have discussed above the conversion of the mechanical energy of the colliding gas ﬂows into
thermal energy of the gas for a plane-parallel (1D) collision. We remind that the ratio of the thermal
energy ﬂux produced by the shock to the ﬂux of kinetic energy, R, is maximum (R = 4/3) for a 1D
collision between two identical stream ﬂows. Lee et al. (1996) ﬁnd drastic differences between one-
and three-dimensional cases. In 3D, most of the bulk kinetic energy of the ﬂows is converted into
the kinetic energy of the accelerating hot gas instead of thermal energy. For the 3D simulations, Lee
et al. (1996) compute the time-dependent energy conversion rate, R(t), as the ratio of the increase in
the total thermal energy of the gas in the computational box to the kinetic energy added in the box
through the discontinuity:
Eth(t) − Eth(0)
2 (ρ2σ2v2t)v2
2 (ρ1σ1v1t)v2
where ρ1, v1 and ρ2, v2 are the pre-collision mass densities and the velocities of the gas ﬂows. σ1 and
σ2 are the cross-sections of the two colliding streams, so the quantity ρ σ v t represents the mass of gas
that passes through the boundary within the simulation time t. For the model shown on Fig. 4.15, Lee
et al. (1996) ﬁnd R ∼ 0.1 at the end of the simulation. This value is one order of magnitude smaller
than the one-dimensional model. This is due to the possibility for the gas to expand in directions
perpendicular to the gas streams. This illustrative result suggests that the dynamical and thermal

4.5.4 Concluding remarks and limitations of existing codes
The modeling of shocks in inhomogeneous media is very complex, and this is due to the richness of
the physical processes at work (listed above), and the fact that they almost all operate on a comparable
timescale. Here I would like to stress some key processes that one cannot ignore when describing the
survival on shocked molecular gas, as it is one key aspect of the study presented here.
So far, most of the 3D numerical simulations focus on the development of hydrodynamical insta-
bilities and the effect of the magnetic ﬁeld. They generally predict the complete destruction of clouds
by fast shocks in a timescale comparable with the compression (crushing) timescale of the cloud. This
is essentially because these simulations do not include a realistic treatment of the thermal properties
of the shocked gas, including H2 formation on dust and H2 cooling. On the other hand, models that
are used for the comparison with observations, in which chemical processes are included, are limited
to 1D geometry. Here I summarize a few important points among which some of them remain largely
unexplored in numerical simulations:
1. thermal processes have a very important impact on the fate of shocked gas, perhaps more im-
portant than the effect of the magnetic ﬁeld. The thermal instability, so far ignored in numerical
simulations, triggers gas cooling and thereby stabilizes the cloud phase. Both cooling and
thermal conduction seem to limit evaporation of cold and dense gas embedded in the hot and
tenuous postshock medium. In the case of molecular gas, H2, as a main coolant of the gas, may
be a key-actor. In addition, the production of thermally unstable gas in turbulent mixing layers
(at the cloud-intercloud interface) may also help in balancing the evaporation with condensation
of material from the hot to the warm/cold phase.
2. the 3D geometry also inﬂuences the dynamical and thermal properties of the shocked gas. One
should keep in mind that 1D models assume a maximum compression of the gas by the shock,
leading to a maximum conversion of the bulk kinetic energy of the shock to thermal energy. In
3D, this conversion may be less efﬁcient. This is perhaps the main limitation of the models that
I have been using (the Flower et al. and the MAPPINGS shock codes) to interpret observations.
All the effects listed above would tend to increase the lifetime of shocked clouds compared to pure
hydrodynamical simulations.

Powerful H2 emission from the Stephan’s Quintet
galaxy-wide shock
Life is a series of collisions with the future; it is not the sum of
what we have been, but what we yearn to be.
Jose Ortega y Gasset
Abstract
The Stephan’s Quintet (SQ) is a compact group of interacting galaxies and a spectacular ex-
ample of H2 luminous source. The Spitzer Space Telescope indeed detected a powerful mid-
infrared H2 line emission from the X-ray bright galaxy-wide shock created by the high-velocity
(∼ 1000 km s−1) collision between a galaxy and the tidal tail of an other member of the group.
Observations show that the H2 gas is extremely turbulent and that the H2 luminosity exceeds that
of the X-rays. The core of my PhD work is dedicated to the interpretation and modeling of these
observations. In this chapter I present the observational discovery of H2 in the shock, and address
the following question: Why is H2 present in such a violent environment? I propose a scenario
where H2 forms out of shocked gas, and present my results on the modeling of the cooling of the
multiphase postshock gas and associated H2 formation.

5. Powerful H2 emission from the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy-wide shock
5.1 Introduction
Stephan’s Quintet (hereafter SQ) is a fascinating example of an interacting galaxy system (Fig. 6.2).
Perhaps not as famous as Arp 220 or M82, SQ is a well-known astrophysical target for amateur or
professional astronomers. It is a nearby (94 Mpc) compact group of galaxies situated in the Pegasus
constellation, at about half a degree to the South-West of NGC 73311. SQ has been observed in almost
all wavebands, and it keeps revealing surprises when being looked at by new instruments. SQ belongs
to a peculiar class of interacting systems of galaxies: the compact groups (Hickson, 1982) that are
characterized by aggregates of more than 4 galaxies in implied space densities as high as those in
galaxy cluster cores.
SQ is a complex web of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-intragroup medium (henceforth IGM) interac-
tions that have triggered different types of phenomena related to the interactions, including an IGM
starburst, long tidal tails (> 100 kpc) with tidal dwarf candidates, and a large scale shock (∼ 40 kpc
long). This shock is materialized by a giant X-ray and radio-bright ridge, attributed to the collision of
an intruding galaxy with the tidal tail of another member of the group.
In 2006, Spitzer Space Telescope observations revealed a powerful mid-IR H2 rotational line emis-
sion in the SQ shock structure. This discovery makes SQ the ﬁrst known example of an “H2-luminous
source”, amongst the emerging class of H2-galaxies presented in chapter 1. This was perhaps one of
the most exciting results of extragalactic spectroscopic observations carried out with the Spitzer mis-
This surprising observational result was published at the start of my PhD thesis. Much of my
PhD work was dedicated to its interpretation. I have devoted a signiﬁcant part of my time in building
a theoretical model that attempts to explain the formation and excitation of H2 in the SQ galaxy
collision within the broader framework of the numerous multi-wavelength observations of the system.
It was not an easy task (!), and I will try to show that our current understanding is the result of a long
path, along which several working hypothoses have been explored before coming to what we think to
be a “coherent” scenario.
This work has been published in Guillard et al. (2009c) (hereafter paper I). In this manuscript, I
will introduce the two questions of H2 formation and excitation almost independently. In this chapter,
I only discuss H2 formation. The interpretation work carried out in paper I is based on the single-
pointing observations of Appleton et al. (2006). After the publication of that paper, we have obtained
new Spitzer observations that now cover the full area of the SQ ridge. I have re-visited my previous
analysis of the H2 excitation in this extended region, and complemented it by an analysis of mid-IR
ﬁne-structure lines diagnostics. These new observations and the modeling results are presented in the
next chapter (chap. 6).
After reading chapters 5 and 6, I hope that the reader will be conviced that SQ is an outstanding
source to study in detail phenomena such as large scale shocks and high velocity galaxy collisions.
SQ is a beautiful example of astrophysical source where detailed and rich micro-physics of the ISM
are needed to understand the global observational picture. These studies have implications for our
understanding of the dynamics and energetics of the molecular gas in galaxy evolution.
In this chapter, I present the observational discovery of H2 emission in SQ (sect. 5.2), and point

out the set of astrophysical questions raised by these observations (sect. 5.2.2). Then sect. 5.3 adresses
the question of the H2 formation in the SQ shock. I present the long route that drove us to our current
interpretation of these observations and introduce our paper I. A quick summary of the results and
concluding remarks end this chapter (sect. 5.4)
5.2 Observations of warm H2 gas in Stephan’s Quintet
The ﬁrst mid-IR spectroscopic observations of the SQ shock were performed by Appleton et al.
(2006). We present the observational discovery based on single-pointing observations (sect. 5.2.1),
and their extension to new spectral maps are presented in chapter 6.
5.2.1 The discovery: an H2-bright giant shock!
The Spitzer Infra-Red Spectrograph (IRS) observations of the SQ galaxy-wide collision led to the un-
expected detection of extremely bright mid-IR H2 rotational line emission from warm (∼ 50− 103 K)
molecular gas in the center of the X-ray emitting ridge (Appleton et al., 2006). The observational
results about the ﬁrst detection of H2 in the SQ shock are summarized in Fig. 5.1. The left panel
shows the position of the IRS slits (SH, LH and SL modules; see caption for the slit sizes) overlaid
on a R-band image with radio VLA contours. The high-resolution modules are placed close to the
“center” of the radio-bright ridge. The SL slit is oriented along the radio ﬁlament that traces the shock
structure.
The right panel of Fig. 5.1 gathers the low- and high-resolution spectra extracted in the SQ shock.
These spectacular spectra are dominated by the mid-IR rotational emission of H2. The 0-0 S(0) to S(5)
lines are detected, plus atomic lines of [Ne II] at 12.8 µm and [Si II] at 34.8 µm. No PAH emission
is seen2 and the thermal dust continuum is very weak. This is the ﬁrst time an almost pure H2 line
spectrum has been seen in an extragalactic object.
of 3 and note no obvious deviations from this value in the data.
A two-temperatures ﬁt of the observed H2 excitation diagram reproduces the data satisfactorily
and gives a rough estimation of the excitation temperatures of the gas. The warm molecular gas is
constrained by the S(0)/S(1) line ratio and is consistent with Texc = 185 ± 30 K and an H2 column
density of 2.06 × 1020 cm−2. The higher order S(3)/S(5) [ortho] transitions give Texc = 675 ± 80 K
and an H2 column density of 1.54 × 1018 cm−2. Appleton et al. (2006) assume an ortho-to-para ratio
The SL spectroscopy shows that the H2 emission is extended on the scale of 52” (24 kpc). Assum-
ing that the extra, undetected H2 lines represent 40% of the ﬂux detected by Spitzer, Appleton et al.
(2006) derive an total H2 luminosity of 8.4 × 1033 W from the SH slit area (11.3 × 4.7 arcsec2).
The bottom right inset of Fig. 5.1 shows one of the remarkable results of these observations: the
H2 17 µm 0-0 S(1) line is resolved, though the relatively low resolution (R = 600) of the IRS. The
S(1) line is extremely broad, with a FWHM linewidth of ∆v = 870± 60 km s−1. This is the broadest
H2 line ever observed! The high velocity dispersion of the warm molecular gas suggest that the
postshock medium in the ridge is extremely turbulent. This is a puzzling result since H2 is a fragile
molecule and easily dissociated in Vs > 50 km s−1 shocks.
2this conclusion will be revised in chapter 6. New Spitzer IRS observations indeed show PAH emission in the
ridge(Cluver et al., 2009)

lines (R = 600) in the planetary nebula NGC 6543 at 15.6 and 18.7 µm that bracket the H2 line (gray
We summarize the main unexpected results from the Appleton et al. (2006) observational paper:
1. the H2 gas is coexisting with a hot (∼ 5 × 106 K), X-ray emitting plasma.
2. the velocity dispersion of the H2 gas seems unusually large and of the order of the velocity of
the galaxy collision ∼ 900 km s−1, which is of the order of the velocity of the galaxy collision.
3. the total H2 line luminosity within the SH slit aperture exceeds that of the X-rays in this area by
a factor of 3.
4. the spectroscopic signatures (dust or ionized gas lines) of star formation are much fainter than
the H2 emission. This is unlike what is observed in star forming galaxies where the H2 lines
are much weaker than the mid-IR dust features (Rigopoulou et al., 2002; Higdon et al., 2006;
Roussel et al., 2007).

5.2.2 Astrophysical questions
These surprising observations raise the following questions:
• Why is there H2 gas is the extreme environment of the SQ postshock gas?
• How can we account for the H2 excitation characteristics?
• Why is H2 a dominant coolant?
Much of my thesis work has been driven by these astrophysical questions, which are addressed in
Guillard et al. (2009c) (paper I). In the following, I only discuss the scenario proposed to explain the
formation of H2 in the SQ shock. The two last issues will be discussed in the next chapter (chap. 6),
where I extend the analysis of paper I, which was based on the single-pointing observations presented
above, to the full area of the SQ ridge.
5.3 How does H2 form in the Stephan’s Quintet giant shock?
In this section we focus on the ﬁrst out of our three astrophysical questions: the formation of H2 in
the SQ ridge. We introduce the scenario presented in Guillard et al. (2009c) (paper I). I will ﬁrst
show that we have explored several working hypothesis before coming to this scenario. Obviously,
our scenario may not be the right solution, but, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst quantitative model
that attempt to explain the H2 formation and emission within the broader context of multi-wavelength
observations of SQ. Up to now, it has not been invalidated by observations.
5.3.1 A long route to a coherent scenario. . .
The main difﬁculty in understanding the presence of H2 in the SQ shock is to explain how the gas can
cool and become molecular in a hot plasma, and how it can survive in such a violent environment.
Inspired by previous studies, Appleton et al. (2006) evoke two possibilities: (i) an oblique shock
geometry, and (ii), the presence of dust in the hot plasma. Both ingredients will help diminishing
the gas temperature and make its cooling easier to form H2 within the age of the collision. These
hypothesis may also explain why the gas temperature in the ridge is not much hotter than that of
the underlying halo (see sect. 6.3.3 and Trinchieri et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2003; O’Sullivan et al.,
2009b). However, these ingredients alone are not sufﬁcient enough to explain the coexistence of
warm molecular gas with a hot plasma. I will show that the multiphased nature of the shocked gas is
a key to interpret multi-wavelength observations of SQ.
An oblique shock geometry?
The collision between the new intruder, NGC 7318b, and the intra-group tidal tail is not necessarily
head-on. The shock associated with this collision may be oblique, i.e. the upstream ﬂuid crosses the
shock front with an incident angle φ (cid:54)= 90˚(see sect. 4.5.3 for a description of oblique supersonic colli-
sions between two gas streams). This hypothesis is considered by Trinchieri et al. (2003); O’Sullivan
et al. (2009b) to explain with there is so little difference between the gas temperature in the radio
5. Powerful H2 emission from the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy-wide shock
ridge (6.9 × 106 K) and outside, in the halo (5.7 × 106 K). Trinchieri et al. (2003); O’Sullivan et al.
(2009b) assume a shock velocity equal to the relative line-of-sight velocity between the new intruder
and NGC 7319’s tidal tail (900 − 1000 km s−1). In the case of a perpendicular shock, a 1000 km s−1
shock would lead to a post shock temperature of ∼ 1.4 × 107 K (see Eq. 6.4), which is twice the
temperature derived from X-ray observations in the ridge. If the incoming ﬂow forms an angle φ with
the shock surface, then the shock velocity is reduced by a factor sin φ. In this case, the postshock
temperature can be written as
(cid:18)
(cid:19)2
(cid:19)
(cid:18) φ
2(γ − 1)
(γ + 1)2
s sin2 φ (cid:39) 6.9 × 106
1000 km s−1
where Vs is the velocity of the shock wave, µ the mean particle mass (equals to 10−24 g for a fully
ionized gas), kB the Boltzmann constant and γ = 5/3. Therefore, an incidence of φ ∼ 30˚would be
required to match the observed temperature of the hot gas in the ridge.
The possibility that the large-scale shock is oblique may be an argument to reduce the X-ray power
with respect to the more luminous H2 emission in the ridge. However, it does not explain why part of
the gas has cooled down efﬁciently to form H2, and part of the gas is still hot and emits X-rays.
A signiﬁcant cooling of the hot gas by the dust?
Based on ISO IR observations, Xu et al. (2003) suggest that dust grains are the main coolant of the hot
gas, which produce FIR emission. After subtraction of the IR emission from the individual sources
in the group, they detect a residual IR emission from the shock. The IR emission is extended, its
morphology is similar to the radio emission in the ridge, and is one order of magnitude more luminous
than the X-ray emission. They interpret this IR emission by collisional heating of dust grains by the
hot electrons and ions of the plasma. Assuming a constant dust-to-gas mass ratio of 6 × 10−3, they
estimate a cooling time scale of tcool ∼ 2 × 106 yr, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than if
the plasma is dust-free (see sect. 2.4). They use the collisional heating model of Popescu et al. (2000)
and ﬁnd that the expected FIR luminosity is in agreement with observations.
The problem is that the cooling timescale is so short that we should observe cool gas around the
shock, which is not seen on the X-ray temperature maps (O’Sullivan et al., 2009b). This scenario has
difﬁculties to explain why we observed both a diffuse hot (6− 7× 106 K) component in the ridge and
in its outskirts, and warm (100 − 1000 K) molecular gas. In fact, at the beginning of our study, we
started to work in the direction of Xu et al. (2003) to explain the cooling of the gas by the dust grains
in the ridge. This is why I decided to carry on a detailed calculation of the time-dependant cooling
of the hot gas, taking into account dust destruction. This modeling has been presented in sect. 2.4
and in paper I. The results lead us to revise the conclusions of Xu et al. (2003), and we discuss the
application of this modeling to the case of SQ in sect. 5.3.2.
We ﬁnd that the cooling timescale of the hot gas in the ridge is more than one order of magnitude
longer than the shock age. We conclude that it is very unlikely that the H2 gas results from the direct
cooling of the hot gas. This result has driven us to the idea that, if the H2 formation was induced by the
galaxy collision, it must have cooled down from much lower temperatures. Then the gas in the ridge
must have been shocked by a wide distribution of shock velocities, a thus of postshock temperatures.
This is how we came to consider that the preshock medium was inhomogeneous. In the following, we
5.3. How does H2 form in the Stephan’s Quintet giant shock?
present our scenario for H2 formation. New IR observations and modeling of the dust emission in the
SQ shock within the framework of this scenario will be discussed in chapter 8.
5.3.2 H2 formation out of multiphase postshock gas
The difﬁculties evoked above suggest that it is very difﬁcult to explain H2 formation from homoge-
neous shocked gas at high-speed. In our view, the presence of H2 in the SQ ridge is closely related to
the multiphase structure of the preshock gas and may result from two possibilities:
1. molecular clouds are present in the preshock gas and embedded within the pre-existing halo of
hot gas. Because of the density contrast between the tenous gas and the clouds, slower shocks
are driven into the clouds (see sect. 4.5), and H2 molecules may or may not be dissociated,
depending on the shock velocity. If the shock transmitted into the cloud is dissociative, H2
molecules may reform in the postshock medium (see sect. 4.2 and Hollenbach and McKee,
1979). If gravitationally bound molecular clouds are present in the preshock medium, we expect
the shock to trigger their collapse, which would lead to star formation (Jog and Solomon, 1992).
This process is perhaps what is happenning in the northern region of the shock, SQ-A, where
optical and IR imaging show that a starburst is occuring (Xu et al., 1999).
The weakness of tracers of star formation in the region of the main shock (Xu et al., 2003)
suggests that preshock GMCs are not a major source of the observed postshock H2 gas in the
ridge. Although we do not exclude pre-existing molecular gas in the ridge, we explore the
following second possibility.
2. H2 gas forms out of preshock H I gas. Appleton et al. (2006) also evoke this scenario by propos-
ing that a large-scale shock overruns a clumpy preshock medium. H2 molecules would form
in the denser regions that experience slower shocks compared with the high-speed shock in the
tenuous gas. In the following we summarize and complete the results presented in our paper I.
Supersonic collision between two inhomogeneous gas streams
Multiwavelength observations of SQ suggest that two multiphase gas ﬂows are colliding (see paper I
for an introduction to the past observations and to the astrophysical context that are relevant for our
study3). One stream is associated with the intruding galaxy (NGC 7318b), and the other is associated
with the tidal tail of NGC 7319. Both gas streams are likely to contain hot (a few million K), H I and
perhaps molecular clouds. Therefore we consider the collision of two ﬂows of multiphase dusty gas.
The relative velocity between the ﬂow is 900 − 1000 km s−1, constrained by H I observations and
optical line spectroscopy. Our model quantiﬁes the gas cooling, dust destruction, and H2 formation in
the postshock medium within this framework.
If the colliding gas ﬂows are inhomogeneous, the rise of pressure in the hot, tenuous gas drives
slower shocks into the denser clouds (see sect. 4.5). Each cloud density corresponds to a shock
velocity. The galaxy collision generates a range of shock velocities and postshock gas temperatures.
The state of the postshock gas is related to the preshock gas density. Schematically, low density
3A more complete review of SQ observations is differed to the sect. 6.3.3 of chapter 6 because this observational context
is needed to interpret our new extended observations of SQ.
5. Powerful H2 emission from the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy-wide shock
(preshock at nH (cid:46) 3 × 10−3 cm−3) gas is shocked at high speed ((cid:38) 700 km s−1) and accounts for
the X-ray emission. Denser H I gas (nH (cid:38) ×10−2) is heated to lower ((cid:46) 106 K) temperatures. The
ﬁg. 1 of paper I sketches this scenario. The rise of pressure in the hot gas triggers the compression of
the H I clouds that are the sites for H2 formation.
In the following we compute the isobaric cooling, the evolution of the dust-to-gas mass ratio, and
the formation of molecules in this multi-temperature postshock gas (see chapter 2 and chapter 4 for
a description of the microphysics included in the calculation). We show that the hot plasma did not
have time to cool down signiﬁcantly since the collision was initiated, whereas the denser gas has time
to cool and form H2.
Gas cooling, dust survival and H2 formation in the SQ ridge
We summarize here the context and main results of our calculation of the time-dependence of the gas
temperature and dust-to-gas mass ratio. We start the computation with a galactic dust-to-gas mass
ratio and equilibrium ionization. We assume that the metallicity of the gas is solar and that the cooling
gas is in pressure equilibrium with the hot, volume-ﬁlling gas (the average thermal pressure of the
possibility that the gas pressure vary around this average value (see in particular Fig. 3).
hot plasma is P/kB = 2 × 105 K cm−3). As the gas cools, it condenses. In paper I we explore the
The H2 formation, gas cooling, and dust destruction timescales are plotted as a function of the
postshock temperature in the key-ﬁgure 2 of paper I. The gas cooling timescale is deﬁned as the time
at which the temperatures coolds down to 104 K. The H2 formation timescale is the time when the H2
fractional abundance reaches 90% of its ﬁnal (end of cooling) value, including the gas cooling time
from the postshock temperature to 104 K. The dust destruction timescale is the time when 90% of the
dust mass is destroyed and returned to the gas. We remind that a given initial postshock temperature
is associated to a given preshock density. The relative values of the timescales with respect to the
collision age deﬁne three gas phases:
The hot plasma: the preshock gas at nH (cid:46) 6 × 10−3 cm−3 is shocked at Vs > 500 km s−1 and
therefore heated to temperatures Tps > 5 × 106 K. Our estimate of the cooling timescale of
the hot plasma takes into account the time-dependence of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. Fig. 2 of
paper I shows that, because the dust grains are efﬁciently sputtered in the hot gas, the cooling
timescale is much longer (tcool = 2 × 107 yr for Tps = 7 × 106 K) than if one estimates it
for a constant dust-to-gas mass ratio (tcool = 2 × 106 yr as estimated by Xu et al., 2003). The
cooling timescale of the hot gas is longer than the age of the collision, so the tenuous, shocked
gas has not yet cooled down signiﬁcantly. This is the X-ray emitting plasma indicated by the
red thick line. Note that this hot gas may still contain some dust because the largest grains
(representing most of the mass) may not have been completely sputtered within the collision
age. However, these grains are the less numerous, so their contribution to the gas cooling is
weak (see chapter 2, sect. 2.3 and 2.4 for a quantitative discussion of these processes).
The molecular gas: The preshock gas at nH (cid:38) 3 × 10−2 cm−3 is shocked at Vs < 250 km s−1
and therefore heated to temperatures Tps (cid:46) 8 × 105 K. In this case, the gas cooling timescale
to 104 K and the H2 formation timescale are shorter than the collision age, whereas the dust

destruction timescale is longer. Therefore, this gas keeps a signiﬁcant fraction of its initial dust
content and becomes H2 gas (blue thick line) within the age of the collision.
Atomic and ionized gas: for intermediate densities (6 × 10−3 (cid:46) nH (cid:46) 3 × 10−2) and therefore
intermediate postshock temperatures (8 × 105 < Tps < 5 × 106 K), the gas has time to cool
down but it loses its dust content and does not have time to form H2 within the collision age.
This phase is indicated with the grey thick line and may represents H I and H II gas phases.
This description of the multiphase postshock ignores the fragmentation of the clouds by ther-
mal and hydrodynamical instabilities (Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz) that develop when a
cloud is shocked. As discussed in sect. 4.5.2, this fragmentation can lead to the mixing (evapora-
tion), and therefore the destruction, of the clouds with the background hot plasma. The powerful
H2 emission in the SQ shock suggest that warm molecular gas is formed before the clouds mixing
timescale. In sect. 3.3 of paper I we compare the H2 formation timescale to the fragmentation and
mixing timescales. The conclusions are the following:
Cloud fragmentation: we show that for a wide range and preshock cloud densities and sizes (see
Fig. 4, paper I), the crushing time is longer than the cooling, so the gas fragments by thermal
instability as the shock penetrates into the cloud. H2 forms before the shock has crossed the
cloud, and therefore before hydrodynamical instabilities start to develop.
Cloud evaporation: analytical and numerical studies suggest that the typical evaporation timescale
of warm (∼ 104 K) H I clouds in hot (> 106 K) gas is a few million years (see sect. 4.5.2 for a
description of turbulent mixing and references). This is long enough for H2 to form within the
lifetime of the fragments. The cloud lifetime may be even longer because they are stabilized by
the efﬁcient H2 cooling. Up to now, none of the simulations include both the detailed micro-
physics (realistic cooling functions and H2 formation on dust grains), and the full dynamic
range of spatial scales and densities that are involved in the evolution of clouds embedded into
a ﬂow of hot gas (see sect. 4.5.2 for the description of the state-of-art simulations).
5.4 Summary and conclusions
One of the most interesting features of the Stephan’s Quintet compact group is the presence of a
galaxy-wide shock in the halo of the group, created by an intruding galaxy colliding with a tidal tail at a
relative velocity of ∼ 1 000 km s−1. Evidence for a group-wide shock comes from observations of X-
rays from the hot postshock gas in the ridge strong radio synchrotron emission from the radio emitting
plasma and shocked-gas excitation diagnostics from optical emission lines. Spitzer observations show
that this gas also contains molecular hydrogen with an extreme velocity dispersion. The H2 luminosity
is larger than the X-ray emission from the same region, thus the H2 line emission dominates over X-
ray cooling in the shock. As such, it plays a major role in the energy dissipation and evolution of the
postshock gas.
The interpretation of these observations is the core of my PhD work. I present a scenario where H2
gas forms out of the postshock gas that results from the supersonic collision between two multiphase
gas streams. This collision leads to a multiphase medium with a distribution of shock velocities,
5. Powerful H2 emission from the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy-wide shock
related to the variations of the density in the preshock medium. The H2 formation in the SQ ridge
environment is quantiﬁed by calculating the time-dependent isobaric cooling of the gas, including
dust destruction mechanisms. I show that H2 forms out of the dense regions where dust survives the
shocks. The bulk kinetic energy of the molecular gas is the main energy reservoir of the postshock
gas, and it has to be dissipated within the H2 gas to explain the poserful H2 excitation. I propose that
supersonic turbulence is sustained within the molecular gas by a transfer of momentum induced by
cloud-cloud collisions and the relative shear motions between the molecular gas and the hot plasma.
A phenomenological model of low-velocity MHD shocks driven into the dense H2 gas is capable of
explaining the observed excitation characteristics.
Within this framework, dust is a key ingredient.
It is required for H2 formation. Our model
has implications on the expected dust emission in the SQ halo and on dust survival in a multiphase
environment. These points are adressed in chapter 8.

Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephan’s Quintet
It’s just like when you’ve got some coffee that’s too black, which
means it’s too strong. What do you do? You integrate it with
cream, you make it weak. But if you pour too much cream in it,
you won’t even know you ever had coffee. It used to be hot, it
becomes cool. It used to be strong, it becomes weak. It used to
wake you up, now it puts you to sleep.

The observations of H2 rotational line emission from the Stephan’s Quintet (SQ) galaxy collision
presented in chapter 5 are extended to a complete, and high signal-to-noise spectral mapping of
the SQ giant shock. We ﬁnd that the H2 line emission is extended over the full ridge (≈ 15 ×
35 kpc2). I present these recent observations and the new astrophysical questions they raise, in
particular on the dynamical history of the group. I thus introduce some observational background
needed to elucidate these questions. Then, I present an update of the mass and energy budgets
of the galaxy collision based on these new data. I also performed a complete re-analysis of the
new data with shock models, and discuss the issue of H2 excitation in the shock. This analysis is
complemented by the use of fast shocks models to interpret the ﬁne-structure line emission from
the ionized gas.

6.1 Introduction
The interpretation of H2 observations presented in the previous chapter (chap. 5) and in Guillard
et al. (2009c) (paper I) is based on the single-pointing observations by Appleton et al. (2006),
6. Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephan’s Quintet
who ﬁrst detected H2 emission from the Stephan’s Quintet (henceforth SQ) shock. The spectacular re-
sult of Appleton et al. (2006) led us to propose a new set of Spitzer observations to obtain a full mid-IR
spectral map of the X-ray bright shock region. I have participated in the preparation of this proposal
(P.I.: P.N. Appleton) by performing the model calculations that support it. It was accepted and ob-
served in December 2007 and January 2008. Both mid-infrared (mid-IR) imaging and spectroscopy
were performed.
These new observations were reduced by M. Cluver and P. Appleton at the SSC and the results
are presented in Cluver et al. (2009) (hereafter paper II). I have participated to the interpretation of
these data and to the writing of this paper. Thanks to this new IRS spectral mapping of the SQ ridge,
we have now an almost complete census of the mid-IR warm H2 emission, ﬁne-structure line and dust
emission in the SQ shock. These observations allow to complement the mass and energy budget of
the collision presented in paper I, which was resticted to a small area of the giant shock. This energy
budget is the ﬁrst step to understand the mechanisms that produce the high H2 luminosity over such a
large area (≈ 40 × 15 kpc). This leads me to do a complete re-analysis of the H2 data, based on my
previous interpretation work. I have also complemented this work by an interpretation of the emission
from the ionized gas in the group (optical and ﬁne-structure mid-IR lines).
This chapter extends and re-visits the analysis presented in chapter 5 and in paper I for the full
area of the SQ shock. In sect. 6.2 I brieﬂy present the results of the spectral maps, focussing on H2.
Obviously, these new observations raise new astrophysical questions, formulated in sect. 6.2.2. In
sect. 6.2.3, I present an updated mass and energy budget in the SQ shock, similar to that presented
in paper I, but for the full extension of the ridge. Section 6.3 describes past observations of SQ to
set the astrophysical observational context, focusing on the complex dynamics of the galaxy group.
This background seems crucial for the understanding of our new set of Spitzer observations. Then I
extend my modeling of the H2 excitation for the whole ridge (sect. 6.4). Pursuing the work of paper I,
I discuss the dynamical picture of the energy transfer between the ISM phases that emerges from
this interpretation, and the physical mechanisms that may explain how the bulk kinetic energy of the
galaxy collision is transfered into the warm H2 (sect. 6.5). Then I complement the H2 analysis by a
study of the excitation of the mid-IR ﬁne structure lines in sect. 6.6. Section 6.7 comments about the
AGN member of the group, NGC 7319, which shows an interesting H2 feature revealed by our new
IRS spectral maps. A quick summary and concluding remarks end this chapter (sect. 6.8).
The paper II is reproduced at the end of this chapter because it contains the ﬁgures I will rely on
in this chapter, and a lot of information that I have intentionally not repeated in this manuscript.
6.2 Spectral mapping of the H2 line emission in the SQ shock
The Spitzer IRS mapping strategy is summarized in Fig. 6.1. The SL and LL modules were used to
map the entire shock region, the SL slits being oriented along the shock structure and the LL slits
perpendicular to it. The spectral mapping aims at spatially resolving the H2 and dust across the shock.
6.2.1 H2 spatial distribution
The new spectral maps are reported in Cluver et al. (2009) (hereafter paper II). We summarize here
the main observational results, focusing on the distribution and characteristics of the H2 emission in

the SQ intra-group. The main results regarded the mapping of other mid-IR ﬁne-structure lines are
discussed later in sect. 6.6.2.
A remarkably extended H2 emission!
Fig. 2 of paper II shows contours of the H2 S(0)-S(5) line emission overlaid on an R-band image.
The S(0) and S(1) lines were mapped by the LL modules, while S(2) - S(5) transitions were mapped
by the SL modules of the IRS. These spectral maps show an extended emission from a giant ﬁlament
(∼ 40 kpc long) oriented north-south along the direction of the “main shock”. This “H2 ridge”
spatially correlates very well with the radio or the X-ray emission. This provides an unambigious link
between the origin of the H2 emission, and a large-scale high-speed shock generated by the galaxy
collision between NGC 7318b and the tidal tail of NGC 7319. We deﬁne the main shock aperture
as a AMS = 77(cid:48)(cid:48)
× 30(cid:48)(cid:48) rectangular aperture, corresponding to ∼ 13.7 × 35.1 kpc2, centered on the
coordinates α = 22h35m59.6s, δ = +33˚58(cid:48)05.7(cid:48)(cid:48).
H2 emission from the star forming region, SQ-A, as well as associated with NGC 7319 is also
detected. We note that the 28.2 µm S(0) line emission appears to be concentrated towards the SQ-
A northern region. The maps also show an H2 structure running eastward, from the center of the

main shock to NGC 7319. We call this the “H2 bridge”, because it connects the ridge to the core of
NGC 7319. This feature is also visible in radio, H α, and is and faintly detected in X-rays. The origin
of this bridge feature is not clear, and we will come back to this point later (sect. 6.7).
Enormous H2 ﬂuxes!
The spectra (see Fig. 8 of paper II) and the H2 line ﬂuxes (see sect. 4 and table 2) have been calculated
for different apertures in the ridge (Fig. 7). The spectra show the striking dominance of the H2 lines
in the mid-IR range of the IRS. The thermal dust continuum is very weak in the center of the shock
and in the bridge structure, whereas it is stronger for the northern region SQ-A where star formation
is likely occurring. For the main shock structure, the 0-0S(1) line luminosity alone, the sum of the
S(0) to S(5), and the total H2 (accounting for ≈ 30 % of the ﬂux in undetected lines) luminosities are
respectively
LS(1)(H2) ≈ 2.3 × 1034 W
LS(0)−S(5)(H2) ≈ 7 × 1034 W
Ltot.(H2) ≈ 9 × 1034 W
This exceptional power in the molecular hydrogen lines is one order of magnitude brighter than the
next brightest mid-IR line, [Si II]λ34.82µm, with a line luminosity of L(SiII) = 8.5 × 1033 W.
The mid-IR spectral mapping will allow us to map the excitation of the H2 along and across the
X-ray shock. We have started to work on a two-dimensional modelling of the H2 excitation. We
will create maps the H2 excitation temperature across the shock, and correlate this with dust emission
SEDs, in order to test models we are developing to explain the extreme H2 power observed. This work
will be pursued during my postdoc.
6.2.2 Astrophysical questions raised by the new observations
The new spectral maps described above reveal the wide extension of the H2 emission in the halo of
the SQ group, as well as the spatial distribution of the mid-IR emission from dust and ﬁne-structure
lines. They essentially raise the main following questions:
• Why is the H2 emission so extended? In particular, what is the origin of the H2 emission in the
bridge feature between the main shock and the AGN (NGC 7319) of the group?
• Which mechanisms power the mid-IR ﬁne-structure lines detected in the ridge? Is H2 really the
dominant coolant in the shock?
• Where does the emission come from? From the hot gas in the halo of the group, or from the
molecular gas?
The ﬁrst issue is related to the geometry and dynamics of the galaxy interactions in the group.
This is why we discuss this point in sect. 6.3. The second point is discussed in paper II and I have
complemented this discussion in sect. 6.6. The dust emission in SQ is tackled in chapter 8. Before
addressing the two ﬁrst questions, it is important to assess the energy content of the extended SQ
6.3. A complex astrophysical context: SQ observational constrains
6.2.3 Updated mass and energy budgets for the whole ridge
In Guillard et al. (2009c), we use the multiwavelength observations (see sect. 6.3) to estimate the
masses, thermal and mechanical energy, and luminosities in the preshock and postshock medium (see
table 1 of paper I). At that time, only the single-pointing H2 observations by Appleton et al. (2006)
were available, so the mass and energy budgets were calculated within the IRS SH slit aperture. Now
that we have a complete spectral mapping of the ridge, we are able to estimate the physical quantities
within the full shock region. The details on how we determine the quantities from the observations
are given in sect. 2.2 and 2.4 of paper I. The new results for the whole ridge are gathered in table 6.1.
All the quantities are estimated within the “main shock” 77(cid:48)(cid:48)
× 30(cid:48)(cid:48) aperture deﬁned above.
The conclusions are the same as those of Guillard et al. (2009c). In the preshock medium, the
thermal energy of the hot plasma ( 3
TX) is only a few percent of the bulk kinetic energy of the
H I gas. In the postshock medium, the main energy reservoir is the mechanical energy associated with
the high-velocity dispersion of the warm H2 gas. All the mechanical energy of the collision is not
dissipated in the hot plasma, but a substantial amount is carried by the warm H2. We show that the
bulk kinetic energy of the molecular gas is > 2 times the thermal energy of the postshock plasma.
6.3 A complex astrophysical context: SQ observational constrains
I describe here the SQ group of galaxies and give an overview of its multi-wavelength data (sect. 6.3).
This review is focused on the dynamics of the group and on the evidence for a high-speed, galaxy-
wide shock. This is crucial to understand the complexity of this interacting system and to set the
context for the interpretation of the extended H2 emission.
6.3.1 Are there ﬁve musicians playing in the Stephan’s Quintet?
SQ was discovered in 1877 by the french astronomer Edouard Jean-Marie Stephan (1837 − 1923)
at the Observatory of Marseille, France (Stephan, 1877). He discovered a group of four “elliptical
nebulae”, today known as SQ, much earlier than anyone knew the existence of galaxies outside the
Milky Way! When one looks at a SQ image, one actually sees 6 galaxies: NGC 7317, NGC 7318a,
NGC 7318b, NGC 7319, NGC 7320 and NGC 7320c (see Fig. 6.2). So how many galaxies belong to
the group, 4, 5 or 6?
The ﬁrst estimates of the redshifts of the SQ members were done through optical spectroscopy,
and observations show a wide range of values among the galaxies within the group (Humason et al.,
1956; Ambartsumian, 1958; Limber and Mathews, 1960; Burbidge and Burbidge, 1961a). In partic-
ular, NGC 7320 has a recession velocity of ∼ 6000 km s−1 less than NGC 7317, NGC 7318a and
NGC 7319 that are at ∼ 6600 km s−1 (see table 6.2). In addition, NGC 7318b and NGC 7320c have
respectively “redshift” ∼ 900 and ∼ 700 km s−1 less than the three members at ∼ 6600 km s−1. This
puzzling result was the start of a long debate about the population of Stephan’s Quintet. Do all the
galaxies belong to the group? How many galaxies are in gravitational interaction?
Burbidge and Burbidge (1961b) reported that the difference in redshift of ∼ 6000 km s−1 between
the high- and low-redshift members of SQ could only means one of two things: (i) NGC 7320 is a
foreground galaxy, or (ii) NGC 7320 is literally exploding away from the other members. They

estimated the probability of (i) being true is ∼ 1/1500. On the other hand, they stated that conclusion
(ii) “is outside conventional ideas about the [dynamics] of galaxy groups”. Arp (1973b) reports the
ﬁrst Hα interference ﬁlter images of SQ. These images clearly separate the low- and high-redshifts
systems, associated with the foreground galaxy NGC 7320 (∼ 800 km s−1) and the SQ group (∼
6000 km s−1). Based on the analysis of the distribution and diameters of the H II regions, Arp (1973b);
Arp and Lorre (1976) argued that NGC 7320 is physically associated with other SQ galaxies, and this
was a prime case for the existence of non-Dopler redshift.
Tammann (1970); Allen and Sullivan (1980); Moles et al. (1997) provided counter arguments
against this claim. First, H I and Hα observations show no evidence for NGC 7320 interaction with
other SQ galaxies. Second, redshift independent estimates yield to distances consistent with the red-

shifts. Third, the redshift of NGC 7320 is close to that of NGC 7331 (818 ± 5 km s−1), so NGC 7320
appear to be a member of a foreground loose galaxy group which includes the large spiral galaxy
NGC 7331. In the following, we thus assume that NGC 7320 is a foreground galaxy and it will not be
further discussed hereafter. Arp (1973a) suggested that NGC 7320c, the galaxy lying 4 arcmin to the
east of NGC 7319 (see Fig. 6.2, top panel) is linked to the group by optical tidal tails. Therefore the
“quintet” status is restored!
In the bottom panel of Fig. 6.2 we show a recent mosaic picture taken by Gallagher et al. (2001)
with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), on
Dec. 30, 1998 and June 17, 1999. One clearly sees on the image that galaxy interactions have distorted
the galaxies’ shapes, creating elongated spiral arms and long, gaseous streamers. Interestingly, this
spectacular image reveals that star clusters are forming outside the galactic disks, in the SQ halo.
Some of these star cluster contain a few millions of stars.
In the following, we assume the distance to the SQ group to be 94 Mpc (with a Hubble constant of
70 km s−1 Mpc−2) and a systemic velocity for the group as a whole of 6 600 km s−1. At this distance,
10 arcsec= 4.56 kpc.
6.3.2 The complex dynamical history of Stephan’s Quintet
The ﬁrst deep optical images taken by Arp and Kormendy (1972); Arp (1973a); Arp and Lorre (1976)
show two concentrating parallel tidal tails, both starting from NGC 7319 and extending to NGC 7320c,
with the more diffuse one passing through the low redshift galaxy NGC 7320. Fig. 6.3 presents an
example of a photographic plate taken at the 200-inch Palomar telescope, where these two tidal tails
are clearly visible. This is the ﬁrst indication of a long list of observations that show that the group
has a complex dynamical history.

6. Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephan’s Quintet
As its population, the dynamical history of SQ has been a long debate that is not entirely solved
yet. In the following, we ﬁrst summarize the scenario of past and present dynamical interactions that
emerges from multi-wavelengths observations. Then we detail the different arguments that support it,
and we point out the remaining uncertainties.
Summary of the scenario: multiple galaxy collisions
In the past, an “old intruder”, NGC 7320c, stripped most of the gas from group members (essentially
NGC 7319 and NGC 7318a), and a new intruder, NGC 7318b is currently colliding with this gas and
triggering a large scale shock. The old intruder passed the core of SQ twice, ﬁrst ∼ 5−7×108 yrs ago
and creating the “old tail” (the southern tail in Fig. 6.3), and second about 2 × 108 yrs ago, triggering
the “young tail” (the narrower one in Fig. 6.3).
Observational constrains on past interactions with NGC 7320c
The “two-intruders” scenario summarized above was clearly formulated by Moles et al. (1997) and
further conﬁrmed by Sulentic et al. (2001), who discussed in detail the link between the two tidal tails
and the two passages of NGC 7320c through the kernel of the group.
The HST image (Fig. 6.2) highlights that star birth occurs mainly in three dynamically-perturbed
sub-regions of the group: the long, sweeping tail and spiral arms of NGC 7319 [left]; the gaseous
debris of the galaxy pair NGC 7318a and b [bottom right]; and an area north of those galaxies, the so-
called SQ-A starburst region [top right]. Since galaxy interactions are known to trigger star formation,
the SQ star formation history is closely linked to its dynamical history. Photometric analysis of the
HST images shows that the ages of these star clusters span over a wide range, spanning from ∼
2 × 106 yrs to ∼ 3 × 109 yrs, which shows past and recent star formation (Gallagher et al., 2001).
The southern, diffuse tail mostly contains an old population of star clusters, whereas the northern one
is comprised of younger stars.
X-ray observations also support multiple episods of galaxy interaction in the SQ group. A very
extended halo of hot (∼ 6 × 106 K) gas was ﬁrst detected by Bahcall et al. (1984). They state that
the extent of the halo is too big and its temperature too low to have been produced by the collision
of the new intruder. They also show that the X-ray luminosity of the halo (LX (0.1 − 3 keV) =
5 × 1042 erg s−1) is 10 times the expected luminosity from the combined ﬁve SQ galaxies. Later,
Moles et al. (1997); Sulentic et al. (2001); O’Sullivan et al. (2009b) suggest that this X-ray emitting
hot intracluster gas was produced by previous galaxy encounters (with NGC 7320c for instance). We
will further discuss X-ray observations in sect. 6.3.3.
The discovery of a galaxy-wide shock in Stephan’s Quintet
The ﬁrst evidence for the recent collision between the intruder NGC 7318b and the IGM comes from
two discoveries in the radio band, both made with the Westerbork Synthesis Telescope, Netherlands.
The ﬁrst is a giant (∼ 40 kpc long) radio continuum ridge found in the IGM between NGC
7319 and NGC 7318b (Allen and Hartsuiker, 1972). Among other possible interpretations, Allen
and Hartsuiker (1972) suggested this may be a large scale shock triggered by an on-going collision
between NGC 7318b (the recent intruder) and the rest of the group. The collision velocity is about
6.3. A complex astrophysical context: SQ observational constrains
one million mph (1000 km s−1)! A one hundred thousand light-year long giant shock is produced!
Stephan’s Quintet is thus a multi-galaxy collision caught in action!
The second (Allen and Sullivan, 1980; Shostak et al., 1984) is the revelation that nearly all the
H I gas associated with SQ is lying outside galaxy disks, in the group halo. This represents a mass of
neutral gas of ∼ 1010 M(cid:12). These observations suggest that this gas has been stripped from late type
galaxy disks due to an earlier interaction (a few 108 yr ago) either between NGC 7319 and NGC 7318a
(Allen and Sullivan, 1980), or between NGC 7319 and NGC 7320c (Shostak et al., 1984). In sect. 6.3.3
we discuss more recent observations of the radio-emitting ridge.
Ongoing debate about the origin of the “young” tidal tail
If most of the litterature now agrees on the origins of the old tail and of the main shock, the origin
of the “young tail” is more debated. Instead of the “two step” scenario proposed by Moles et al.
(1997); Sulentic et al. (2001), Xu et al. (2005) proposed a “three-intruders” scenario based on new
UV observations.
They argue that it is unlikely that the young tail is also triggered by NGC 7320c. This is because
the recently measured redshift of NGC 7320c (6583 km s−1 Sulentic et al., 2001) is almost identical
to that of NGC 7319, indicating a slow passage (Sulentic et al., 2001) rather than a fast passage
(∼ 700 km s−1 Moles et al., 1997). In order for NGC 7320c to move to its current position, the
NGC 7319/7320c encounter must have occurred (cid:38) 5 × 108 yr ago. This is close to the age of the old
tail, but older than that of the young tail. They suggested that the young tail is triggered by a close
encounter between the elliptical galaxy NGC 7318a and NGC 7319. The projected distance between
NGC 7318a/7319 is only ∼ 1/3 of that between NGC 7320c/7319. Therefore the time argument is in
favor of the new scenario.
Numerical N-body simulations are certainly needed to explore and test the dynamical scenarios
inferred from observations. Recent work within the speciﬁc context of SQ has been made by Renaud
(2007), and has to be pursued. We will not further discussed this debate and shall concentrate on the
main shock.
6.3.3 Further evidence for a galaxy-wide shock
In the following we further discuss multi-wavelength observations of Stephan’s Quintet. These data
sets allow to establish the energy and mass budget of the SQ galaxy collision, which is gathered in the
Table 1 of Guillard et al. (2009c) (paper I).
Radio observations
The galaxy-wide radio ridge discovered by Allen and Sullivan (1980) has been conﬁrmed by VLA1
observations by van der Hulst and Rots (1981); Williams et al. (2002); Xu et al. (2003). Fig. 6.4
presents radio observations of SQ at 1.416 and 4.86 GHz. O’Sullivan et al. (2009a) extend these
observations to lower frequencies (327 and 610 MHz) with the GMRT telescope. Fig. 6.5 shows

GMRT radio contours overlaid on optical and UV images of the group core, and on a 1400−610 MHz
spectral index map. We summarize the main results:
• there is a bright north-south linear ridge of radio emission running in between NGC 7319 and
NGC 7318b. The diffuse radio emission is more extended at lower frequencies, including areas
west of the ridge. The 1.4 GHz image shows that faint emission connects this extended ridge
to NGC 7319. A faint extension to the northwest, coinciding with Hα emission (Plana et al.,
1999; Sulentic et al., 2001), is also detected. The total ﬂux density associated with the extended
radio ridge is 48 ± 7 mJy (Williams et al., 2002).
• The spectral index map shows that the southern part of the ridge has an index of 0.7 − 0.8,
while the northern part has a steeper spectrum (O’Sullivan et al., 2009a). Some of the brightest
spots of radio emission corresponds with knots of UV emission in the south-eastern spiral arm of
NGC 7318b. In this region the spectral index is consistent with star formation, so the underlying
extended radio emission arising from shocks may be enhanced by star formation in some areas.
• the core of the Seyfert 2 NGC 7319 shows a radio source with a ﬂux 28.5±0.5 mJy. Both images
also show that there is a radio source associated with the nucleus of NGC 7318a (0.95±0.05 mJy
Xu et al., 2003).
• note that the bright source lying to the north of SQ-A is a backgroung distant binary source seen
in projection behind SQ (van der Hulst and Rots, 1981; Williams et al., 2002).
The total luminosity emitted by the radio ridge at 1.4 GHz is L1.4GHz ∼ 4 × 1031 W from a
volume extending about 90(cid:48)(cid:48)
× 15(cid:48)(cid:48). This luminosity is 10 times the radio-luminosity of all star-
forming regions in SQ (NGC 7318a, SQ-A, and a possible non-AGN component from 7319). van der
Hulst and Rots (1981) proposed that the radio emission in the ridge is produced by an intra-cluster
starburst. This would imply a star-formation rate of ∼ 30 M(cid:12) yr−1, which is uncompatible with
optical spectroscopy, Hα imaging, or mid-IR observations (see chapter 8).
The radio ridge must be associated with synchrotron emission of relativistic electron accelerated
in the giant shock created by the NGC 7318b galaxy that is entering into NGC 7319’s tidal tail. The
ridge is the interface between the interloper NGC 7318b and the group. Indeed, the shocked, ionized
gas is predicted to produce signiﬁcant amounts of synchrotron emission (van der Hulst and Rots,
1981; Allen and Hartsuiker, 1972). The synchrotron life time for the radiating electrons is estimated
to be rather short, a few times 107 yr, which is comparable to the crossing time for the collision.
Assuming the equipartition of energy between gas internal energy, cosmic rays and magnetic
energy, Xu et al. (2003) estimate the magnetic ﬁeld strength to be Beq (cid:39) 10 µG. The corresponding
energy density of relativistic particles plus the magnetic ﬁelds is Umin ∼ 1011 erg cm−3. This is
signiﬁcantly lower than the thermal energy density implied by X-ray observations (see below).

discussed later, in sect. 6.6.1. On Fig. 6.7, the H I contours are overlaid on an optical R-image. In
colors we show the radial velocities of the gas. HI observations exhibit a large stream created by
tidal interactions between NGC 7320c, and NGC 7319 (Moles et al., 1997; Sulentic et al., 2001).
This stream corresponds to the “old tidal tail” (see Fig. 6.3) and the velocity of the gas in the tail is
6600 − 6700 km s−1. No H I gas is detected in the younger tail. The SQ-A starburst region both
contains H I gas at the intragroup (tidal tail) velocity (∼ 6600 km s−1) and at a velocity slightly
higher that the intruder velocity (∼ 6000 km s−1), which suggests that this gas was accelerated by the
shock. Some H I gas associated with the intruder velocity (∼ 5700 km s−1) is detected to the south of
NGC 7318a/b.
The observed difference in radial velocities between the H I tidal tail and the intruder is about
1 000 km s−1. On Fig. 6.6, the 21 cm contours are overlaid on an H α Fabry-Pérot image. At the
velocity of the intra-group medium, the H α image (left panel) clearly shows the linear feature asso-
ciated with the shock. Over the shock region, no H I gas is detected, but optical line emission from
H II gas is observed at the H I tidal tail velocity. This suggests that the H I gas present in the ridge
before the recent galaxy collision was ionized by the shock induced by the collision between the two
gas ﬂows. It is likely that the H I gas at ∼ 6600 km s−1 in SQ-A was physically connected to the H I
tail. We infer the preshock H I gas masses based on the I column densities observed on both sides of
the ridge (see paper I).
X-ray observations
The ﬁrst X-ray observations of SQ were performed with the Einstein Observatory and were reported
by Bahcall et al. (1984). They found an extended halo but the spatial resolution was not high enough
to resolve the structure of the ridge. The presence of shock-heated gas in the SQ halo was conﬁrmed
by X-ray ROSAT, Chandra and XMM observations. X-ray maps (Pietsch et al., 1997; Sulentic et al.,
2001) revealed an extended and diffuse hot halo, plus features associated with the radio ridge and

with galaxy members of the group. The extent of the underlying X-ray emitting halo is too big to
have been produced by the new interaction of NGC 7318b with the tidal tail, strongly suggesting that
it must have been heated during previous dynamical encounters (Moles et al., 1997; Sulentic et al.,
2001; O’Sullivan et al., 2009b). One third of the total X-ray luminosity, LX = 5 × 1041 erg s−1, is
associated with the intergalactic ridge. The comparison of the relative structures in radio and X-ray
bands (Fig. 6.4 and 6.8) show that the X-ray emission is brightest in the northern part of the ridge,
while the radio emission is brightest in the south.
High spatial resolution maps (Trinchieri et al., 2003, 2005; O’Sullivan et al., 2009b) and optical
narrow-band Hα/[N II] maps (Vilchez and Iglesias-Paramo, 1998; Ohyama et al., 1998; Xu et al.,
1999; Plana et al., 1999; Sulentic et al., 2001) show a similar structure, in both the hot gas and the
ionized gas. The left panel of Fig. 6.8 shows a spectacular Chandra image (blue) overlaid on an
optical CFHT image.The right panel shows a zoomed gray-scale B-band image overlaid with Chandra

The width of the radio or X-ray emission in the shock is ∼ 5 kpc, which is commensurate with
the width of the H α ridge. Dividing the width of the ridge by the collision velocity (assumed to be
1 000 km s−1), we get a collision age of the order of tcoll ∼ 5 × 106 yr.
Spectral energy distribution ﬁtting of Chandra and XMM observations of SQ show that the temper-
ature of the hot plasma in the ridge is TX = 6.9×106 K (Trinchieri et al., 2003, 2005; O’Sullivan et al.,
2009b). The postshock temperature for a perpendicular shock is given by (see chapter 4, Eq. 4.20 or
e.g. Draine and McKee, 1993):
(cid:18)
(cid:19)2
2(γ − 1)
(γ + 1)2
s (cid:39) 6.94 × 106
715 km s−1
where Vs is the velocity of the shock wave, µ the mean particle mass (equals to 10−24 g for a fully
ionized gas), kB the Boltzmann constant and γ = 5/3. Therefore, the postshock temperature of the
hot plasma allows us to estimate a shock velocity of ∼ 700 km s−1. We expect the shock velocity to
be equal to the gas velocity in the center of mass frame. If the volume-averaged gas densities are the
same on the intruder side and on the side of the tidal tail (see sect. 6.3.3 for details), the shock velocity
would be approximately half of the observed relative velocity, so 1000/2 = 500 km s−1. This is
signiﬁcantly lower than the shock velocity we deduce from X-ray observations, suggesting that the
mass of the gas in the intruding galaxy is higher than in the tidal tail.
The fact that the shock velocity agrees with the line-of-sight relative velocity of the intruder sug-
gests that its transverse velocity component is small. Sulentic et al. (2001) also argue that the dis-
tribution of the H I and H II emissions support the idea of an ongoing collision of NGC 7318b with
the tidail tail almost parallel to the line of sight. This conclusion has been revised by Trinchieri et al.
(2003); O’Sullivan et al. (2009b) who argued for an oblique shock geometry. They ﬁnd that the tem-
perature in the ridge (6.9 × 106 K) is close to that of the underlying hot halo (5.7 × 106 K). As they
6.4. How can we account for the H2 excitation?
are assuming a shock velocity of 900 − 1000 km s−1, they conclude that the temperature in the ridge
is too low. The hypothesis of an oblique shock may help to decrease the main shock velocity and
therefore the postshock temperature. This will be further discussed in sect. 5.3.1.
The only sign for any interaction between NGC 7317 with other members of SQ is a common halo
linking it to the binary NGC 7318, found in the deep X-ray and optical R-band images (Trinchieri
et al., 2005).
6.4 How can we account for the H2 excitation?
In this section we address the question of the H2 excitation in the ridge. Thanks to the IRS spectral
mapping of the ridge presented in sect. 6.2, we have a complete census of the warm H2 excitation over
the extended region of the SQ ridge. I have extended and re-visited the analysis presented in chapter 5
and in paper I for the full area of the SQ shock.
6.4.1 Possible H2 excitation mechanisms in the SQ shock
H2 can be excited by several mechanisms: X-ray heating, cosmic-ray heating and shock excitation.
We have discussed the micro-physics of these processes in sect. 3.4 and we discuss here which are the
dominant processes for H2 excitation in the environment of the SQ ridge.
X-ray heating
The physics of the H2 excitation by X-rays is discussed in sect. 3.4.1 and 3.4.2. We show that the
energy conversion from X-ray ﬂux to the bolometric H2 emission is at most 10 % for a molecular
cloud that is optically thick to X-ray photons. This excitation efﬁciency may be even smaller because
the absorbed fraction of X-ray photons may be smaller than 1. We indeed expect that the surface
ﬁlling factor of the postshock H2 gas is smaller than 1.
The Spitzer observations show that the H2 line luminosity domines the X-ray emission from the
SQ shock region. This result is true for the whole SQ ridge, but also for sub-regions extracted in the
center of the ridge or in the “H2 bridge structure” towards NGC 7319 (see sect. 6.2 and paper II). For
the main shock, the total X-ray ﬂux is FX (0.001− 10 kev) ≈ 2.8× 10−16 W m−2, which corresponds
to a luminosity of LX (0.001−10 kev) ≈ 2.95×1034 W. Therefore, we ﬁnd an H2 to X-ray luminosity
ratio of
Ltot.(H2)
LX (0.001 − 10 keV) ≈ 3
Given the X-ray to H2 ﬂux conversion estimated previously, this ratio shows that the H2 gas cannot
be predominantly excited by the X-ray photons of the hot plasma.
Cosmic ray heating
Warm H2 gas may also be heated by relativistic particles in the radio ridge. The physical processes
related to H2 excitation by cosmic-ray ionization have been discussed in sect. 3.4.1 and 3.4.2. An
enhanced cosmic ray density has been proposed to account for the high temperatures of molecular
clouds in the Milky Way nuclear disk (Yusef-Zadeh et al., 2007) and for the mid-IR H2 emission in
6. Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephan’s Quintet
the ﬁlaments of the Perseus A (3C 84) cool core cluster (Ferland et al., 2008). Is the cosmic-ray
heating can explain the powerful H2 emission in the SQ ridge?
Let us estimate the cosmic-ray ionization rate ζ that is needed to balance the cooling of the gas
by H2 line emission. In the SQ ridge, the total H2 line luminosity is 9 × 1034 W (see eq. 6.3) and the
estimated total mass of H2 is 1.2 × 109 M(cid:12) (see sect 6.2.3, table 6.1). Therefore, the average total
line emission per H2 molecule is
LH2(SQ) ≈ 1.3 × 10
−31 W H
We assume that each H2 ionization releases Eion.(H2) ≈ 7 eV of energy to heat the molecular gas (see
sect. 3.4.2 for the determination of this value). Therefore, the H2 line cooling is balanced by cosmic
ray heating for an ionization rate per hydrogen equal to
(cid:18)
(cid:19)(cid:18) 7 eV
(cid:19)
Eion.(H2)
ζ = 1.2 × 10
LH2(SQ)
1.3 × 10−31 W
Therefore, the cosmic-ray ionization rate needed to balance the H2 line cooling in the SQ ridge is
≈ 5 × 103 times higher than the standard Galactic rate (Shaw et al., 2005). For a cosmic ray energy
density ≈ 5×103 times higher the the Milky Way mean value, the cosmic ray pressure would be a fac-
tor 400 higher than the mean cosmic ray pressure in the Milky Way disk (Pcos(MW) ≈ 104 K cm−3 ,
Boulares and Cox, 1990) and ≈ 20 times larger than the thermal gas pressure. Such a high difference
in the pressures is unlikely on large scales. It would imply large departures from the g as equilibrium
and from the equipartition of energy on a very large volume, which does not seem to be conﬁrmed by
radio observations (see Xu et al., 2003; O’Sullivan et al., 2009a, and paper I).
However, enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rates may be produced at small scales, for instance in
turbulent mixing layers. This turbulent mixing occurs when the ﬂow of the background hot plasma in-
teracts with the molecular clouds. At the interface, cosmic-ray particles can be accelerated efﬁciently
(see Scalo and Elmegreen, 2004, for a review of these processes). For such a high value, cosmic
rays are the main destruction mechanism of H2 molecules, and the molecular gas fraction depend
on the ionization rate to gas density ratio ζ/nH. The models by Ferland et al. (2008) show that for
ζ ≈ 10−13 s−1, the gas is molecular for nH > 104 cm−3 (see their ﬁgure 2). Given that the warm
H2 temperature inferred from the S(1) to S(0) line ratio is ≈ 160 K (see ﬁg. 9 of paper II) in the
main shock region, the pressure of the warm molecular gas would be > 2 × 106 K cm−3, which is
physically possible in the SQ environment.
H2 emission associated with its formation
The formation of H2 during the cooling of the dense postshock gas (discussed in sect. 5.3.2) must be
accompanied by H2 emission. The excitation mechanism associated with H2 formation is discussed
in sect. 3.4.3. Can this excitation explain the powerful H2 excitation in the SQ ridge? To quantify this,
we calculate the H2 emission associated with its formation during the isobaric cooling of the gas from
104 K to ≈ 10 K. This calculation has been discussed in sect. 5 of paper I and we summarize here our
results.
Within the framework of a multiphase postshock medium, we assume that the gas that is forming
H2 comes from hotter, ionized gas that has recombined. We ﬁnd that the observed H2 rotational line
6.4. How can we account for the H2 excitation?
ratios are well reproduced by the model. Fig. 5 of paper I shows that the shape of the H2 excitation
diagram associated with H2 formation during the gas cooling matches the observations very well (blue
dashed curve). However, we ﬁnd that the mass ﬂow of cooling gas (the mass of gas that recombines
˙Mrec = dMrec/dt) needed to reproduce the absolute level of H2 emission in the SQ
per unit time,
shock is 25 times larger than the mass ﬂow derived from Hα observations. We use the following
expression to derive
˙Mrec. from the Hα luminosity:
˙Mrec = mH × ˙Nrec
= mH × LHα
= 1263 ×
0.45 × E Hα
6.5 × 1033 W
M(cid:12) yr
where ˙Nrec is the number of hydrogen atoms that recombine per second, EHα is the energy of an H α
photon and LHα is the Hα luminosity (see Heckman et al., 1989, for details). To match the observed
H2 line ﬂuxes with this model would require a mass ﬂow of recombining gas of ≈ 30300 M(cid:12) yr−1,
which is not compatible with the mass rate derived from Hα observations (≈ 1260 M(cid:12) yr−1). This
model also fails to reproduce the [OI] 6300Å line emission by a factor of 7. Therefore, the cooling of
the warm H I gas produced by H II recombination cannot reproduce the observed H2 emission nor the
[OI] 6300Å line emission. A larger amount of energy needs to be dissipated within the molecular gas
to account for the H2 emission.
In paper I we show that, within the IRS SH slit aperture centered in the ridge, the dominant energy
reservoir of the postshock gas is the bulk kinetic energy of the molecular gas. In sect. 6.2.3 we have
extended the mass and energy budget of the SQ galaxy collision and shown that the mechanical H2
energy is at least a factor of 2 higher than the thermal energy of the hot plasma for the whole shock. If
we assume the equipartition of energy between cosmic rays and magnetic energy, the mean magnetic
ﬁeld strength in the SQ shocked region is (cid:39) 10 µG (Xu et al., 2003). The magnetic energy and thereby
the cosmic ray energy

446 kpc2
where lz is the dimension along the line-of-sight and AMS the area of the main shock region deﬁned
in paper II and sect. 6.2. Assuming lz ≈ 4 kpc (O’Sullivan et al., 2009b), we conclude that the
equipartition energy of cosmic-rays is one order of magnitude smaller than the bulk kinetic energy of
the H2 gas. So the bulk kinetic energy of the warm H2 gas greatly domines the overall energy budget
of the entire SQ ridge structure.
This conclusion drives us to the following interpretation of the extreme H2 power in the SQ ridge:
we propose that the H2 emission is powered by the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy into molecu-
lar gas. In the turbulent postshock medium, we expect that the relative motion between the backgroung
plasma and the H2 gas, but perhaps also the relative motion between the molecular clouds themselves,
supply supersonic turbulence in the H2 gas. Since the postshock medium is magnetized (as indicated
6. Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephan’s Quintet
by radio synchrotron observations, see sect. 6.3.3), we phenomenologically model this dissipation of
mechanic energy by shocks. In sect. 4.3.3 we have discussed extensively the molecular cooling in
shocks. Non-dissociative MHD shocks are a very efﬁcient way to channel the mechanical energy of
the shock to the rotational excitation of H2. Then we favor this process. In the absence of a mag-
netic ﬁeld, shocks are rapidly dissociative and much of the cooling of the shocked gas occurs through
atomic, rather than H2, line emission.
6.4.2 Low-velocity MHD shocks and H2 excitation
We quantify the required gas densities and shock velocities to account for the H2 rotational line ﬂuxes.
In paper I, we present in details the result for the single-pointing observations by Appleton et al.
(2006). Here we use our spectral mapping data to extend our analysis on the whole region of the SQ
ridge. We compare these new results with our previous analysis in the center of the SQ shock.
The H2 emission induced by low velocity shocks is calculated using an updated version of the
shock model of Flower et al. (2003), presented in chapter 4, sect. 4.3. We use the same grid of
models presented in paper I, i.e. shock velocities from 3 to 40 km s−1 with steps of 1 km s−1,
two values of the initial H2 ortho to para ratio (3 and 10−2), and three different preshock densities
(nH = 102, 103, and 104 cm−3). In this models, we assume a standard value for the cosmic ray
ionization rate of ζ = 5 × 10−17 s−1. In its initial state, the gas is molecular and cold (∼ 10 K), with
molecular abundances resulting from the output of our model for the isobaric cooling (see sect. 5.3.2
and paper I for details). We adopt the scaling of the preshock magnetic strength with the gas density,
nH [cm−3] (Crutcher, 1999; Hennebelle et al., 2008). In our models, b = 1. Since the
B(µG) = b
molecular gas colder than 50 K does not contribute to the H2 emission, we stop the integration when
the gas has cooled to 50 K, and we calculate the line ﬂuxes at this point.
(cid:112)
In paper I we present the result in terms of H2 excitation diagram (see sect. 3.4.5 for the details
about how it is calculated). In this manuscript we present the observed and model spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the H2 line ﬂuxes for (i) the same data as in paper I, and (ii) the new data of
paper II for the main shock region.
We detail how we ﬁt the H2 line ﬂuxes with shock models. In the models presented here, the
preshock gas density is nH = 104 cm−3. The shock velocity is the only shock parameter that we
allow to vary. From the output of the shock model we derive the H2 line brightnesses B50 K(H2) at
50 K, in units of [W m−2 sr−1]. We perform a least-squares ﬁt of the observed H2 line ﬂuxes to a
linear combination of two MHD shocks at different velocities Vs1 and Vs2 has been performed. These
ﬁts provide a scaling factor for each of the shocks which represents a mass ﬂow ˙M = dM/dt, the
amount of gas traversing the shocks per unit time. The H2 gas luminosity is proportional to this mass
ﬂow. For a given H2 line of upper rotational level J, the model line ﬂux is derived as follows:
4πB50 K
where d is the distance to the source (94 Mpc for SQ), mH is the mass of an hydrogen atom,
the hydrogen mass ﬂow [kg s−1], and nHVs represents the ﬂow of hydrogen atoms per unit surface
[H m−2 s−1].

The data cannot be ﬁtted with a single shock. For the six H2 lines detected S(0)−S(5), we obtain a
good ﬁt for two different shock velocities, Vs1 and Vs2. The Fig. 6.9 shows the observed and modeled
H2 line ﬂuxes for the Appleton et al. (2006) data (left panel, corresponding to the ﬁg. 5 of paper I)
and for the main shock region (data from paper II). For a preshock density of 104 cm−3, the best ﬁt
is obtained for a combination of 5 and ≈ 20 km s−1 shocks (22 km s−1 for the main shock region)
with an initial value of the ortho to para ratio of 3. Note that no satisfactory ﬁt could be obtained with
the low value of the initial H2 ortho-to-para ratio. The red line shows the weighted sum of the two
shock components (best ﬁt). The contributions of the 5 (blue dashed line) and ≈ 20 km s−1 (green
dashed line) shocks to the total column densities are also plotted. The 5 km s−1 component dominates
the contribution to the column densities of the upper levels of S(0) and S(1) lines. The 20 km s−1
component has a major contribution for the upper levels of S(3) to S(5). For S(2), the 2 contributions
are comparable.
The ﬁg. 6.10 shows the reduced chi-square contour maps of the two-velocities shock ﬁt for the two
apertures used. These maps allow the visualize which are the best combinations of shock velocities to
ﬁt the data. As compared to the small aperture in the center of the shock, there are bigger discrepancies
between the best-ﬁt model and the data for the extended ridge aperture. We note that the agreement
between the model and the data is very good for the odd J values of upper H2 levels, whereas much
larger differences are seen for the even-levels. The error bars on the H2 line ﬂuxes are also much
smaller for the main shock aperture because data is much deeper than the previous observations by
Appleton et al. (2006), so the χ2 value are thus much higher. The extended ridge aperture is more
contaminated by star-forming regions than the small aperture (see chapter 8 for a discussion of star
formation in the ridge), which may explain why the ﬁt is poorer.
Some of the key-parameters derived from the ﬁt are gathered in tables 6.3 and 6.4 for the two
sets of data. We indicate the best-ﬁt shock velocities, the mass ﬂows ˙M that are required to explain
the absolute H2 line ﬂuxes, and the gas cooling times tcool. at 150 K and 50 K. The gas masses are
derived from M = ˙M × tcool.. For the main shock region, we ﬁnd a mass of gas at temperatures
larger than T = 150 K of 9.8 × 108 M(cid:12), which is a factor of 2 larger than the mass derived from
a three-temperatures ﬁt of the excitation diagram (see sect. 4 of paper II, ﬁg. 9). This difference

because some of the mechanical energy of the shock is transferred to the magnetic energy. The H2

value ( 8.0 ± 0.2 × 1034 W).
Our grid of models shows that this solution is not unique. If one decreases the density to 103 cm−3,
we ﬁnd that one can ﬁt the observations with a combination of MHD shocks (at 9 and 35 km s−1). If
one decreases the density to 102 cm−3, the rotational H2 excitation cannot be ﬁtted satisfactorily. At
such low densities, MHD shocks fail to reproduce the S(3) and S(5) lines because the critical densities
for rotational H2 excitation increase steeply with the J rotational quantum number (see sect. 3.2.3).
The warm H2 pressures ρ V 2 in the two shocks are 4.5 × 107 K cm−3 and 5.6 × 108 K cm−3) for
the 5 km s−1 and 20 km s−1 shocks, respectively. These pressure are much higher than the pressure
of the background hot plasma (≈ 2 × 105 K cm−3). Both warm and dense (i.e. high pressure) gas is
needed to account for emission from the higher J levels.
Though the ﬁt is not unique, it gives an estimate of the relevant range of shock velocities required
to account for the H2 excitation. The velocities (≈ 5 − 20 km s−1) are remarkably low compared
to the SQ collision velocity (≈ 1000 km s−1) and to the velocity dispersion of the warm molecular
gas (≈ 900 km s−1). If our interpretation of the H2 emission in terms of shock-driven dissipation of
energy within the warm molecular gas is right, such a contrast in velocities is a beautiful illustration
of turbulent cascade, from high-velocities at large scales, to low-velocity at small scales. The fact that
energy dissipation occurs over this low velocity range is an essential key to account for the importance
of H2 cooling. High velocity shocks (> 40 − 50 km s−1) in dense (nH > 104 cm−3) molecular gas
would dissociate H2 molecules. However, we are far from understanding in details how the transfer
of energy from the background plasma (shocked at high speed, ≈ 700 km s−1, see sect. 6.3.3) to the
molecular gas. This is discussed qualitatively in sect. 5 and 6 of paper I, and we will come back to
this question in sect. 6.5.
6.4.3 Future observational tests: near-IR H2 line emission
A missing piece of the puzzle of the SQ shock is the near-IR spectrum. This would allow to have
access to both ro-vibrational H2 cooling lines and atomic lines, and therefore to gain a more complete

lard et al., 2009c). The model predicts ﬂuxes for the ro-vibrational lines in the range 0.2 − 14 ×
10−18 W m−2 over a solid angle of 5 × 10 arcsec2, depending on the kind of shock. Observations in
the near-IR can signiﬁcantly limit the kinds of shocks capable of explaining the excitation diagram.
These will inﬂuence our picture of how eneregy is funnelled down to 20 km s−1 shocks from the

picture of the total line cooling in the SQ shock. The near-IR ro-vibrational lines sample much hotter
H2 gas than the Spitzer data (see chapter 3).
In particular, near-IR spectroscopy will allow us to
extend the H2 excitation diagram into the hotter regime, where we can start to distinguish between
dissociative or non-dissociative type of shocks. This would have important implications for how the
energy cascades down from the large scale turbulence to the small cloud fragments.
A proposal has been written to perform near-IR spectroscopy with the TripleSpec instrument in-
stalled on the Palomar 200-inch telescope (P.I.: P.N. Appleton). The spectral (R = 2600 or ∆v =
115 km s−1) and spatial (1”) resolution of TripleSpec is far superior to that of the Spitzer IRS, and is
crucial to determine if the large velocity spread seen in the Mid-IR H2 lines (σ ≈ 800 − 900 km s−1)
represents a single broad line or two separate narrow lines indicating both pre-and post shocked ma-
terial.
Fig 6.11 shows example of dissociative and non-dissociative shock predictions from the shock
model grid presented in paper I. The blue dotted curve is our best ﬁt model for C-shocks presented
in sect. 6.4.2, Fig. 6.9 (left panel). The red curve is a model where the higher velocity component

the non-dissociative case because the gas reaches higher temperatures. Near-IR spectroscopy should
provide constrains on the contribution from non-ionizing shocks to the H2 emission. This would help
in determining if these shocks can contribute to other line emission, like [O I] 6300Å for instance.
I participated to our ﬁrst observation run at Palomar observatory to perform near-IR spectroscopy
with the newly-commissioned TripleSpec instrument in November 2008 with Phil Appleton and
Patrick Ogle. Unfortunately the weather was very bad and we have only detected, through the clouds,
some H2 emission from the NGC 7319 Seyfert galaxy. The proposal was re-submitted and accepted
for a new observation run in August 2009.
6.5 Why is H2 such an important coolant?
Our interpretation of mid-IR line emission, but also optical and X-ray emission, within the context
of a multiphase postshock gas, suggests that observations can be understood in terms of dynamical
interactions between the ISM phases (sect. 6.5.1). Exchanges of mass and energy between the gas
phases seem a key to elucidate why the H2 power is so high in the ridge. An efﬁcient transfer of the
bulk kinetic energy of the gas to turbulent motions of much lower velocities within molecular clouds
seems required to make H2 a dominant coolant of the postshock gas (sect. 6.5.2). Here we brieﬂy
summarize and update the discussion of paper I (sect. 5 and 6).
6.5.1 Mass and energy cycle between ISM phases
In the Stephan’s Quintet shock region, observations and modeling suggest that the dissipation of the
mechanical energy of the collision between a galaxy and a tidail tail is the main source to power the X-
ray emission, the optical, and mid-IR line emission from the gas in the ridge. The relative luminosities
from the different gas components depend on the dynamical coupling between the gas phases. In this
section we propose a scenario for the postshock gas evolution that sketches the dynamical interaction
between ISM phases. This interpretation introduces a physical framework that may apply to other as-
trophysical situations (AGN-driven jets in radio-galaxies, supernova remnants, starburst-driven winds,
Fig. 6.12 sketches our view at the mass and energy exchanges between the different gas phases
that control the evolution of the postshock gas. This cartoon is the same as Fig. 6 of paper I except
that the values of the mass ﬂows are updated for the full SQ ridge. Black and red arrows represent the
mass ﬂows between the H II, H I, warm and cold H2 gas components of the post-shock gas. The large
arrow to the left symbolizes the relative motion between the warm and cold gas and the surrounding
plasma. Each of the black arrows is labeled with its main associated process: gas recombination and
ionization (arrow number 1), H2 formation (2) and H2 cooling (3). The values of the mass ﬂows and
the associated timescales are derived from observations and our model calculations.
The total mass ﬂow associated with the low-velocity component of MHD shocks required to re-
produce the H2 line ﬂuxes is much larger (≈ 68000 M(cid:12) yr−1) than the mass ﬂow of recombining gas
derived from Hα observations (≈ 1260 M(cid:12) yr−1). The mass rates needed to account for the Hα, OI,
and H2 luminosities increases. Therefore, one cannot explain the H2 luminosity with only a contin-
uous cycle through the gas components, from H II to cold H2. Heating of the cold H2 gas towards
warmer gas states (red arrows) needs to occur.
6.5. Why is H2 such an important coolant?
Figure 6.12: Schematic view at the gas evolutionary cycle proposed in our interpretation of Stephan’s
Quintet optical and H2 observations. Arrows represent the mass ﬂows between the H II, warm H I,
warm and cold H2 gas components. They are numbered for clarity. The dynamical interaction between
gas phases drives the cycle. The mass ﬂow values and associated timescales are derived from the Hα,
OI, and H2 luminosities and model calculations. Heating of the cold H2 gas (red arrows) is necessary
to account for the increasing mass ﬂow from the ionized gas to cold H2 phases.
The main energy reservoir that can power these red arrows is the mechanical energy of the galaxy
collision. We propose that mass and energy are transfered from cold molecular gas via shocks. The
post-shock molecular cloud fragments are likely to experience a distribution of shock velocities, de-
pending on their size and density. Arrow number 4 represents the low velocity magnetic shocks
excitation of H2 gas that can account for the H2 emission (described in sect. 6.4.2). More energetic
shocks may dissociate the molecular gas (arrows number 5). They are necessary to account for the
low Hα to [O I] 6300 Å luminosity ratio. Even more energetic shocks may ionize the molecular gas
(arrow number 6). This would bring cold H2 directly into the H II reservoir.
The H II gas can also be produced by the turbulent mixing of the warm and cold gas with the hot
background plasma (see sect. 4.5.2 for a description of turbulent mixing layers). This is represented by
the thin blue and orange arrows from the cold and warm molecular gas reservoirs to the hot plasma.
This mixing produces gas at intermediate temperature (a few 105 K) that is thermally instable. At
these temperatures, the thermal sputtering of the dust is uneffective, so dust is preserved. This gas
cools back to produce H II gas that re-enters the cycle (thin green arrow).
An important question is to know whether there is a signiﬁcant mass of cold (< 50 K) molecular

gas associated with the warm H2. This cold gas does not contribute to the H2 emission. The mass
accumulated in this cold H2 reservoir depends on the ratio between the timescale of mechanical energy
dissipation (on which gas is excited by shocks through one of the red arrows 4, 5 and 6) and the cooling
timescale along the black arrow 3.
Following the calculation made in sect. 6 of paper I, we estimate the timescale of dissipation of
the turbulent energy, tturb, and compare it to the cooling time of the warm H2 gas. We assume that
the dissipation of turbulent energy powers the H2 emission, so the energy dissipation rate Pturb must
be at least equal to the power radiated by H2, LH2. Thus we write the turbulent dissipation timescale
as the ratio of the total turbulent energy of the warm H2 gas, Eturb, to the total H2 power:
tturb =

(cid:17)2(cid:18) 1035 W
(cid:19)
1.2 × 109 M(cid:12)
In Eq. 6.16, MH2 is the total warm H2 mass and σturb is the turbulent velocity dispersion within the
warm H2 gas. Using the H2 luminosity and the warm H2 mass in Table 6.1, we estimate a turbulent
dissipation timescale of ≈ 104 yr for a typical dispersion velocity of ≈ 10 km s−1. This estimate of
the turbulent dissipation timescale is a lower limit since the dissipated power Pturb may be larger if it
powers the dissociative and ionizing shocks represented by the arrows 5 and 6 in Fig. 6.12. Therefore,
cold H2 gas would be heated by turbulent dissipation on timescales comparable to the cooling time of
the warm H2 gas that accounts for the S(0) and S(1) line emission (1.8 × 104 yr, see table 6.4). If this
is correct, the cold molecular gas mass should not be much higher than the warm H2 mass inferred
from the Spitzer observations.
We compare the turbulent dissipation timescale to the dissipation timescale of the total bulk kinetic
energy of the warm H2 gas, tTDK, which can be written as the ratio between the H2 gas bulk kinetic
energy and H2 luminosity:
tTDK = 5.7 × 108
The turbulence dissipation timescale tturb is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than tTDK.
Therefore, the dissipation of the mechanical energy of the galaxy collision must involve a large ((cid:38)
1 000) number of cycles where H2 gas fragments are accelerated and dissipate their kinetic energy in
shocks.

6.5.2 Physics of the energy transfer: qualitative discussion
We have shown that the bulk kinetic energy of the gas accelerated by the shock induced by the galaxy
collision has to be transfered efﬁciently within molecular gas to explain the powerful H2 emission.
However, how this energy transfer occurs is far from being known. We discuss here two possible
processes: (i) the momentum transfer induced by the motion of clouds in the hot plasma, and (ii) the
production of cosmic rays in the turbulent mixing layers. The ﬁrst process is discussed in more details
in sect. 6.1 of paper I.
6.5. Why is H2 such an important coolant?
Supersonic turbulence sustained by the motion of clouds
We remind that in our interpretation of the H2 emission in the SQ halo, the formation of H2 gas arises
from the compression of shocked H I gas. The two pre-collision H I complexes, one associated with
the intruding galaxy NGC 7318b and the other with NGC 7319’s tidal tail, move at a relative velocity
of ≈ 900 km s−1 with respect to each other. While they are compressed and becoming H2 clouds,
the clouds move at high velocity with respect to the background plasma because they keep their
preshock momentum. In the collision, the clouds do not share the same dynamics as the lower density
intercloud gas, and the kinetic energy recorded in the ≈ 900 km s−1 H2 line width is dominated by
the bulk motion of the H2 clouds in the plasma rest frame.
The background ﬂow applies drag forces on the clouds (Murray and Lin, 2004). Because of the
viscosity of the ﬂuid, the dynamical friction (shear forces) between the cloud and the hot ﬂow also
lead to a transport of momentum from the fast ﬂow into the cloud. Analytical and numerical studies of
shock-cloud interactions, or studies of the interaction between an outﬂow and molecular clouds seem
to show that the injection of momentum within cloud can feed supersonic turbulence within clouds
(e.g. Kornreich and Scalo, 2000; Matzner, 2007; Carroll et al., 2009). The turbulent energy injected
into the clouds is dissipated by low-velocity shocks into the dense molecular material. Besides, the
relative motion between cloud fragments can lead to cloud-cloud collisions, which results in the dis-
sipation of kinetic energy preferentially in the molecular gas because it is the coldest component with
the lowest sound speed.
In addition to dynamics, the thermodynamics of the multiphase gas is a key to understand the
energy transfers between the phases. First, the cooling of the gas transfers the turbulent energy of
the hotter H II and H I phases to the H2 gas. Secondly, the thermal instability is also an efﬁcient
mechanism to convert the thermal energy to turbulent kinetic energy. Numerical simulations (Suther-
land et al., 2003; Audit and Hennebelle, 2005) show that the thermal instability inhibits energy-loss
through radiation from the warmer gas and feeds turbulence in the cooler gas. The turbulent velocities
generated by the thermal instability are found to be of the order of the sound speed in the warmer gas
and are thus supersonic for the colder gas.
H2 heating by cosmic rays produced in turbulent mixing layers
An alternative mecanism to transfer the bulk kinetic energy of the gas to H2 heating is the production
of cosmic-ray particles in the turbulent mixing layers that would scatter within the molecular clouds
and excite H2 molecules (see sect. 3.4 for a description of H2 excitation by cosmic rays). In sect. 6.4.1
we show that the average cosmic-ray ionization rate in the SQ ridge is likely to be too low to balance
the H2 cooling. The advantage of cosmic-ray acceleration in mixing layers is that cosmic-ray particles
are produced locally and can diffuse into the H2 gas. Cosmic rays are accelerated by the Fermi
mechanism and can in turn generate turbulence and MHD waves into the molecular gas if they are
accelerated to velocities faster than the local Alfvén speed. These processes are reviewed by Scalo
and Elmegreen (2004) (see their sect. 4) and we direct the reader to this review for references.
The two processes discussed above (shocks induced by momentum transfer or cosmic ray excita-
tion produced by turbulent mixing) are two alternative means to cascade the bulk kinetic energy of the
gas on large scales to small-scale dissipation withinthe H2 gas. From an astrophysical point of view,

the most important point is that the H2 emission traces the dissipation of the bulk kinetic energy of
the system.
6.6 Optical and mid-IR ﬁne structure line diagnostics
In the previous sections we have shown that the dominance of the H2 line cooling in the SQ shock
region would require an efﬁcient cascade of energy from the large-scale, bulk kinetic energy of the
gas to small-scale turbulent motions within the H2 gas. However, the H2 rotational lines observed
by Spitzer do not provide a complete budget of the kinetic energy dissipation in the SQ ridge. These
low-excitation lines trace gas between ≈ 50− 1000 K, and therefore they only sample a narrow range
of shock velocities. Within the framework of our interpretation of the H2 emission (the high-speed
collision of two ﬂows of multiphase gas), we expect a broad distribution of shock velocities.
Fast shocks may lead to the line emission from ionized gas, which, up to now, has not been
considered. This section adresses the following questions: is the emission from the ionized gas an
important component of the energetics in the SQ ridge? Is H2 really a dominant coolant? We ﬁrst
describe optical imaging and spectroscopy, as well as mid-IR ﬁne-struture line maps from our new
Spitzer IRS observations. We use line ratios diagnostics to infer the shock properties from the ionized

a chaotic morphology of emission-line regions and complex H II gas kinematics. The left panel of

bination of four narrowband ﬁlter images centered at different wavelengths (from 6667Å to 6737Å),
covering the full velocity range of the SQ galaxies (4760− 7960 km s−1). The grey-scale background
image is a combination of two images centered at 6569Å (280 km s−1) and 6611Å (2200 km s−1), and
thus mainly exhibits the NGC 7320 foreground galaxy. The white contours clearly show an extended
and clumpy North-South Hα ﬁlament that spatially correlates with the radio emission in the ridge,
as well as an East-West feature (we called it the “bridge”) that connects the nucleus of the Seyfert
2 NGC 7319 with the North-South ridge. In addition, emission-line regions associated with the new
intruder and with the northern SQ-A region are detected.
The two background images on Fig. 6.6 show Hα Fabry-Pérot images from Sulentic et al. (2001),
centered at ∼ 6600 km s−1 (left panel) and ∼ 5600 km s−1 (right panel). These images show different
morphologies. The 6600 km s−1 image shows the North-South clumpy, linear shock structure, the
core of NGC 7319 and its “bridge”, and the SQ-A starburst. On the 5600 km s−1 image, the intra-
group emission has an “arc shape”, with brighter emission in the southern region. This southern arc
is comprised of a string of Hα knots that connects to the east end of the faint bar in the new intruder
NGC 7318b. This southern arc may be material disrupted from NGC 7318b that has been compressed
by the shock. This arc almost connects to a fainter string starting from the core of NGC 7318a, then
forming a peculiar “smily face” (the cores of NGC 7318 a and b would be the eyes of this giant
smiley!), also clearly visible on the UV (see the central panel of Fig. 6.5) and mid-IR (see chapter 8)
images. Note that in some regions, the two velocities components have similar morphologies (see also
Fig. 2 of Xu et al., 1999). This emission may arise from gas at intermediate velocities (∼ 6000 km s−1)
that may be shock-accelerated material from the new intruder.
Up to now, very few high signal-to noise optical spectra in the SQ ridge have been published.
Xu et al. (2003) performed optical spectroscopy with the Palomar 200” telescope at several positions
along the SQ ridge. In the center of the shock the ﬂux ratios are:
F([O I] λ6300)/F(H α + [N II]) = 0.53
I([S II] λ6717, λ6731)/I(H α + [N II]) = 1.09
I([O III] λ5007)/I(H β) > 1 .
These ratios are different from those observed in H II regions, and suggest shock excitation. Based
on the shock models by Dopita and Sutherland (1995), Xu et al. (2003) conclude that these lines are
predominantly excited by fast (Vs > 100 km s−1) shocks. In fact, the [O I] / Hα line ratio is so high
that it is difﬁcult to explain this ratio only with fast shock models (see sect. 6.6.3).
Optical emission lines are mainly detected at three velocities (6800, 6100, and 6400 km s−1). The
H α, [N II], [S II] and [O II] lines are detected predominently at 6100 km s−1, and the [O III] λ5007
line is detected at 6800 km s−1. The [O I] λ6300 Å line is centered at 6400 km s−1, and is remarkably
broad, with a FWHM ∆v (cid:39) 1130 km s−1. The width of the line is commensurate with the relative
velocity between the intruder and the tidal tail.

From X-ray observations, Trinchieri et al. (2003, 2005); O’Sullivan et al. (2009b) estimate the average
postshock density is about 4 times the preshock density (sect. 4.2), so we estimate a preshock density
hydrogen density of the hot plasma in the ridge to be nH (cid:39) 1.17 × 10−2 cm−3. For a fast shock, the
of the tenuous gas of nH (cid:39) 3.2× 10−3 cm−3. The total mechanical energy ﬂux for the SQ main shock
is thus Ftot (cid:39) 2.6 × 10−6 W m−2.
If we assume that this luminosity is radiated over a galaxy crossing time (the shock age) of 5 ×
106 yr, the intruder/IGM collision deposits ∼ 8.7 × 1057 erg of energy in the SQ shock region. This
energy is equivalent to the kinematic energy of ∼ 107 supernovae.
6.6.2 Distribution of the ﬁne-structure line emission
Appleton et al. (2006) reported the detection of the [Ne II] λ12.8 µm and [Si II] λ34.8 µm lines.
Thanks to the deeper spectral maps, we have access to the spatial distribution of emission from the
[Fe II] λ25.99 µm and [O IV] λ25.89 µm blend, [S III] λ33.48 µm, [Si II] λ34.82 µm, [Ne II] λ12.8 µm
and [Ne III] λ15.56 µm lines.
Fig. 4 and 5 of paper II show the intensity contours of these ﬁne-structure lines overlaid on H2
S(1) and X-ray maps. The strong [Si II]λ34.82 µm emission spatially correlates with the H2 and X-ray
emission, whereas the [Fe II]λ25.99 µm line emission is only detected towards the AGN NGC 7319
and the center of the ridge, where there is a bright spot of X-ray emission. We direct the reader to
sect. 3.2 of paper II for a detailed description of these ﬁne-structure line emission maps. We now
discuss the interpretation of these observations with models that allow to constrain the gas physical
conditions and the dominant excitation mechanisms (shocks, X-rays, photoionization).
6.6.3 Optical and mid-IR ﬁne structure lines as shock diagnostics
The deep mid-IR spectral mapping data presented above allow to complement the analysis of the
rotational H2 lines with the ﬁne-structure line emission from the SQ ridge (see sect. 6.2 for a descrip-
tion of the observational results). These metal lines provide complementary diagnostics to probe the
physical conditions of the emitting gas and more energetic excitation mechanisms. Since the main
shock region (the X-ray ridge) also contains star forming regions, we have selected a sub-region of
our extended IRS spectral mapping, so-called “center” because it is located in the central region of
the ridge, that has less contamination by star-forming regions (see sect. 4, Fig. 7 of paper II). We
compare the line ratio diagnostics within these two apertures.
Optical spectroscopy diagnostics show that the SQ shock can be classiﬁed as a LINER (Low
Ionization Excitation Region). We will show in this section that the gas must be heated to (cid:38) 105 K by
collisional excitation to explain the optical and mid-IR ﬁne-structure line emission.
We use the Allen et al. (2008) shock model library described in sect. 4.4 to compare models with
the ﬁne structure line ratios measured with Spitzer IRS data. The model results depend on the preshock

magnetic parameter b = B/√nH, where B is the magnetic ﬁeld strength and nH the preshock gas
density. In the models presented here, we assume b = 1, which is slightly lower than the equipartition
value of 3.23. We compare the model results with and without the radiative precursor. The radiative
precursor of a fast shock moving into low-density gas adds an emission component which has the
spectral characteristics of photoionized gas with a high ionization parameter. To neglect the precursor
may be relevant if the shock is propagating in a clumpy medium because only a fraction of the ionizing
photons will interact with the molecular gas (see sect. 4.5).
The [S III] lines ratios are shown on Fig. 6.14 as a function of the shock velocity. The bro-
coloured lines are the observed values. The electron critical densities of the [S III]λ33.48 µm and
ken curves are the shock models for different preshock gas densities (1 − 1000 cm−3). The solid
[S III]λ18.71 µ lines are ne = 1.2 × 103 cm−3 and ne = 104 cm−3, respectively. The observed ratio
for the full ridge (2.46) is close to the low density limit (ne < 100 cm−3, see Fig. 6.15 and details in
Martín-Hernández et al., 2002). The comparison with shock models show that the gas preshock den-
sity is smaller than ∼ 1 cm−3. The lower limit for the shock sub-region is compatible with preshock
gas densities smaller than 100 cm−3 and shock velocities 100 < Vs < 300 km s−1. The [S III]
lines ratio diagnostic clearly shows that the mid-IR line emission from the ionized gas originates
from moderate shocks (of the order of 100 km s−1) in low-density (≈ 1 km s−1). Faster shocks in

to X-rays (see Fig. 8 of Maloney et al., 1996). XDRs models have been used to interpret the line
emission from AGN. Powerfull [Si II] line emission can also be produced by shock excitation, whereas
the [S III] mid-IR lines are mostly tracers of H II regions. Therefore, the [Si II] / [S III] line ratio
measures the ratio between the X-rays or shocks and photoionization excitation powers.

/ [S III]λ33.48 µm and [S III]λ33.48 µm / [S III]λ18.71 µm line ﬂux ratios as a function of the shock
velocity, and for different preshock gas densities (1 − 1000 cm−3). The [S III]λ33.48 µm line is
not detected in the sub-region in the center of the shock, so we indicate an lower limit for the line
ratios (red line). For comparison, the average line ratios observed in local AGN and extragalactic
star-forming regions (from the SINGS3 survey) are shown.
The [Si II] / [S III] SQ line ratios stand out above typical values observed in star-forming regions
or AGN, and cannot be accounted for by PDRs or XDRs models. They are rather consistent with the
line ratios observed in supernova remnants (see sect. 5 of paper II), suggesting shock-excitation. The

seems to be consistent with ∼ 100 km s−1 shocks into nH (cid:39) 10 cm−3 gas. Unlike the sub-region,
the SQ-A starburst line ratios are consistent with the values observed in standard extragalactic star-
forming regions. This shows that photoionization must be the dominant process in this region, with a
minor contribution from shocks.
The Fig. 6.17 shows the [Ne III]λ15.56 / [Ne II]λ12.8 line ﬂux ratio as a function of the shock
velocity (left panel) or as a function of the [Si II] / ([Ne II] + [Ne III]) line ratio. For our range of
preshock densities (1−1000 cm−3), the shock models show that the observed line ratios are consistent
with shock velocities of ∼ 100 − 200 km s−1.
Xu et al. (2003) suggest that the optical lines ratios observed in the center of the ridge (see
sect. 6.6.1) are evidence for a dominant shock excitation. The mid-IR ﬁne structure lines detected
by Spitzer conﬁrm this conclusion. However, the large value of the [O I] / Hα line ratio observed in
the ridge, F([O I] λ6300)/F(H α + [N II]) = 0.53, is difﬁcult to explain with fast shocks models.
Fig. 6.18 shows the [Ne II] to [Ne III] ratio as a function of the [O I] / Hα optical line ratio. In the left
panel, where the precursor is included, the observed value do not match with the models. The mid-IR
[Ne II] to [Ne III] line ratio in SQ suggest a low ionization parameter, whereas the radiative precursor
produces a highly-ionized medium ahead of the shock. This apparent contradiction can be solved if
the SQ intragroup medium is clumpy. In this case, a large fraction of the ionizing photons can es-
cape from the medium without interacting with the dense phase. If we neglect the radiative precursor
(right panel), we ﬁnd a much better agreement with the models. The line ratios are reproduced for a
preshock density of nH = 10 − 102 cm−3 and a shock velocity of Vs = 200 − 250 km s−1. These
6.7. Remarks about the NGC 7319 Seyfert galaxy
conditions imply high values of the postshock pressure as compared with the ambient value. Note that
a signiﬁcant contribution from non-ionizing J-shocks contribute to the optical lines, in particular to
the [O sc i] 6300Å line (see sect. 4.3.3). This will be further discussed in sect. 6.5.1.
In sect. 6 of paper II we discuss the [Fe II] λ25.99 µm and [Si II]λ34.82 µm line emission. The
fact that the observed [Fe II] / [Ne II] and [Si II] / [Ne II] line ratios are both smaller than the shock
model values can be interpreted as evidence for Si and Fe depletion onto dust grains (see Fig. 11 of
paper II). This supports our idea that dust survives in the dense gas phases that are the sites for H2
formation. This will be further discussed in chapter 8 where we model the dust emission from the
molecular gas in SQ.
6.6.4 Conclusion: a distribution of shock velocities
The X-ray, optical and mid-IR line emissions from the SQ shock suggest that the gas experiences a
wide distribution of shock velocities. We relate this distribution of shock velocities with a distribution
of preshock gas densities, due to the multiphasic nature of the preshock medium (paper I). The denser
gas phases are associated with the smaller shock velocities.
Very fast shocks (Vs ∼ 700 km s−1) driven into preshock gas of a few 10−3 cm−3 are responsible
for the bright X-ray emission in the ridge. Optical lines and mid-IR ﬁne-structure lines are likely to
be produced by intermediate (100 < Vs < 300 km s−1) ionizing J-shocks. A signiﬁcant contribution
from non-ionizing J-shocks can also contribute to these lines, in particular to the [O I] 6300Å (which
may help in explaining the very high value of [O I]/ H α), [Fe II] λ25.99 µm and [Si II]λ34.82 µm
lines. And last but not least, low-velocity (5 − 20 km s−1), non-dissociative C-shocks driven into
dense gas (> 103 cm−3) are associated to the rotational H2 emission seen by Spitzer.
6.7 Remarks about the NGC 7319 Seyfert galaxy
6.7.1 Observational context: and AGN in the SQ group
In this short paragraph I gather some observational results about the NGC 7319 galaxy. Although not
related to the SQ main shock itself, these results are helpful to interpret our recent, extended IR and
CO observations of SQ.
van der Hulst and Rots (1981) ﬁrst detected the NGC 7319 AGN with radio continuum VLA
observations of SQ at 20cm. They detected a bright compact source with a jet-like extension, and
suggested this might be related to those found in Seyfert galaxies. Huchra et al. (1982) obtained the
optical spectrum which shows clearly Sy2-type emission-line features. Based on the stellar velocity
dispersion, Woo and Urry (2002) estimated a black hole mass of 2.4×107 M(cid:12). Aoki et al. (1999) made
VLA A-array radio continuum observations, complimented with an archival HST optical image. They
found a chain of 3 radio sources, interpreted as the nucleus and its two jets on opposite sides. Optical
features are found in the HST image closely related to the radio jets, interpreted as gas compressed
and excited by bow shocks driven into the ambient medium by the jets. This is different from the
so-called extended emission line regions (EELR) which are supposedly excited by the AGN radiation
(Aoki et al., 1996).
6. Mapping the mid-IR line cooling in Stephan’s Quintet
Even higher resolution (0.16”) radio continuum observations at 1658 MHz, using MERLIN, were
reported by Xanthopoulos et al. (2004). They compared the data with an HST/ACS U-band (F330W)
image, and found extended UV emission around the nucleus and the northern jet. They argued that this
indicates star formation triggered by the jet/ISM interaction. By assuming the diffuse radio emission
outside the compact sources is due to the star formation, they estimated that the SFR in the circum-
nuclear region is 8.4 M(cid:12) yr−1. However, all of the optical spectra of emission line regions in the
circum-nuclear region show Seyfert or LINER line ratios and none is H II region-like (Aoki et al.,
1996), indicating that most of the radio and UV radiation is related to the AGN and/or the shocks.
Comparing the UV and MIR observations, Xu et al. (2005) found the AGN and the surrounding
region is highly obscured, with an FUV extinction of AFUV = 5.4 mag, consistent with the Sy2
classiﬁcation.
6.7.2 The H2 bridge: AGN-driven outﬂow or tidal interactions?
Our new Spitzer spectral maps presented in sect. 6.2 show that the H2 emission extends from the ridge
to the core of the AGN NGC 7319. This “H2 bridge” feature is also seen on the 1.4 GHz radio image
(see Fig. 6.4 and Williams et al., 2002), on H α maps (see Fig. 6.13 and Xu et al., 1999; Plana et al.,
1999; Sulentic et al., 2001; Gutiérrez et al., 2002), and faintly detected in X-rays (see Fig. 6.8 and
Trinchieri et al., 2003, 2005). The distribution of the H2 emission seems to correlate with that of the
radio emission.
The origin of the “H2 bridge” is unclear. Is it related to the AGN activity of NGC 7319, or is
it related to past or recent galaxy interactions? Optical spectroscopy (Aoki et al., 1996) and VLA
radio observations (Aoki et al., 1999) seem to support the ﬁrst hypothesis. Indeed, Aoki et al. (1996)
interpret the large velocity gradients between the AGN core and the South-West bridge as an high-
speed (∼ 500 km s−1) jet-induced outﬂow of gas. The very high electron density in the outﬂow (∼
600 cm−3, twice that of the nucleus) and the multiple radio structure in the jet suggest that the outﬂow
is interacting with interstellar matter. The H2 emission in this bridge may then be powered by jet-
driven shocks within dense clouds or/and AGN radiation. Cluver et al. (2009) propose an alternative
explanation: the bridge is a remnant of previous tidal interactions. This scenario is suggested by the
similarity between the mid-IR spectrum and X-ray properties of the ridge and bridge regions. This
picture ﬁts in the context of multiple shock heating events proposed by Moles et al. (1997); Sulentic
et al. (2001); O’Sullivan et al. (2009b). The two scenarios (AGN-driven outﬂow and galaxy-wide
shock) are difﬁcult to disentangle because they lead to similar observational signatures. Our new CO
observations in the ridge and in the bridge set a new light on this question, and we will discuss this
further in sect. 7.3.
6.8 Summary and conclusions
One of the most interesting features of the Stephan’s Quintet compact group is the presence of a
galaxy-wide shock in the halo of the group, created by an intruding galaxy colliding with a tidal tail at a
relative velocity of ∼ 1 000 km s−1. Evidence for a group-wide shock comes from observations of X-
rays from the hot postshock gas in the ridge strong radio synchrotron emission from the radio emitting
plasma and shocked-gas excitation diagnostics from optical emission lines. Spitzer observations show
6.9. Publication: paper II
that this gas also contains molecular hydrogen with an extreme velocity dispersion. The H2 luminosity
is larger than the X-ray emission from the same region, thus the H2 line emission dominates over X-
ray cooling in the shock. As such, it plays a major role in the energy dissipation and evolution of the
postshock gas.
The interpretation of these observations is the core of my PhD work. I present a scenario where H2
gas forms out of the postshock gas that results from the supersonic collision between two multiphase
gas streams. This collision leads to a multiphase medium with a distribution of shock velocities,
related to the variations of the density in the preshock medium. The H2 formation in the SQ ridge
environment is quantiﬁed by calculating the time-dependent isobaric cooling of the gas, including
dust destruction mechanisms. I show that H2 forms out of the dense regions where dust survives the
shocks. The bulk kinetic energy of the molecular gas is the main energy reservoir of the postshock
gas, and it has to be dissipated within the H2 gas to explain the poserful H2 excitation. I propose that
supersonic turbulence is sustained within the molecular gas by a transfer of momentum induced by
cloud-cloud collisions and the relative shear motions between the molecular gas and the hot plasma.
A phenomenological model of low-velocity MHD shocks driven into the dense H2 gas is capable of
explaining the observed excitation characteristics.
Within this framework, dust is a key ingredient.
It is required for H2 formation. Our model
has implications on the expected dust emission in the SQ halo and on dust survival in a multiphase
environment. These points are adressed in chapter 8, as well as a discussion of star formation in the
SQ group.

Cold molecular gas in Stephan’s Quintet
Continuous eloquence wearies. Grandeur must be abandoned to
be appreciated. Continuity in everything is unpleasant. Cold is
agreeable, that we may get warm.
Blaise Pascal
Abstract
The warm (> 50 K) H2 gas detected by Spitzer in the halo of the Stephan’s Quintet (SQ) group
does not provide a complete inventory of the molecular gas. Gas colder than ≈ 50 K does not
contribute to the mid-IR H2 emission. In order to determine the physical state, the mass and
kinematics of the molecular gas in SQ, it is crucial to look for cold molecular gas. This chapter
presents the previous CO obervations of the group, and the results of two observation campaigns
at the IRAM 30m telescope that I have conducted from the writing of the proposal to the data
analysis.

7.1 Introduction
Within the evolutionary picture of the Stephan’s Quintet (SQ) postshock gas presented in sect. 6.5.1,
it is fundamental to know whether cold molecular gas (< 50 K) is associated with the warm
H2 gas. In star forming galaxies, the warm molecular gas accounts for about a few percent of the total
cold H2 gas inferred from the CO luminosity (Roussel et al., 2007). What is the cold to warm H2
gas mass ratio in SQ? This is a major open question about the physical state and mass budget of the
molecular gas.
According to our model of formation of molecules in the SQ shock, CO should form on the same
timescale as H2. However, because the cold gas may be continuously energized by turbulent energy
dissipation, the physical state of the shocked gas is likely to be different from that of GMCs in galactic
disks. These observations are crucial to test our scenario of H2 formation in the postshock gas and to
obtain the kinematics of the molecular gas, which cannot be obtained from the low-resolution Spitzer
observations of the H2 alone.
Past interferometric observations do not show any CO signal associated with the H2-emitting
ridge. Previous single-dish observations are mostly concentrated on the southern tidal features or on
the northern starburst region (SQ-A). Therefore we decided to embark on an observation campaign
with the IRAM 30-meter telescope to search for CO emission in the SQ ridge. I have carried on this
campain from the beginning (writing of the proposal) to the end (data reduction and analysis), through
the observations at the telescope. This was one of the great experiences I had the chance to live during
my PhD!
Before presenting our new observations with the IRAM 30-meter telescope (sect. 7.3) and some
preliminary results (sect. 7.4), I ﬁrst review the context of the previous CO observation in the SQ
7.2 Previous CO observations of Stephan’s Quintet: molecular gas out-
side galaxies
Before the discovery of warm (T > 150 K) molecular hydrogen in SQ (sect. 5.2), CO emitting gas
was detected in the group. I summarize here the history and main results of these CO detections.
The ﬁrst millimeter CO observations only allowed to detect cold molecular gas in NGC 7319 (Yun
et al., 1997; Verdes-Montenegro et al., 1998; Leon et al., 1998), which contains 4.8 × 109 M(cid:12) Smith
and Struck (2001). Given its blue luminosity of LB = 5.5 × 1010 L(cid:12) (Verdes-Montenegro et al.,

interferometer, Gao and Xu (2000); Petitpas and Taylor (2005) showed that 3/4 of the CO gas in
NGC 7319 is lying outside its nuclei, mostly in an extended northern region.
Molecular gas outside galactic disks, associated with the IGM starburst SQ-A, was ﬁrst detected
by Gao and Xu (2000) using BIMA. Then, single dish observations by Smith and Struck (2001)
and Lisenfeld et al. (2002) conﬁrmed this spectacular result. Fig. 7.1 presents an overview of these
observations and table 7.1 gathers observational results from the litterature. All the cold H2 masses
in this table are derived assuming a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor of N (H2)/ICO = 2 ×
1020 cm−2 [K km s−1]−1, which explains why the values quoted here may be different from those of
the litterature. Two velocity components were detected, one centered at ∼ 6000 km s−1, and the other
at ∼ 6700 km s−1. These velocities match the redshifts of the two H I gas systems found in the same
region (see sect. 6.3.3). Lisenfeld et al. (2002) found that there is more molecular gas (3.1× 109 M(cid:12))
in SQ-A than in the H I gas (1.6 × 109 M(cid:12)).
Interestingly, past observations with interferometers have not detected any CO gas in the main
shock region. The single-dish observations by Lisenfeld et al. (2002) with the IRAM 30m telescope
partially overlap the main shock region and show > 3σ detection of CO in the northern region of the
ridge. We note that they include this emission in the SQ-A budget. Their observations do not cover
entirely the shock region. Gao and Xu (2000); Smith and Struck (2001); Petitpas and Taylor (2005)
reported CO emission close to NGC 7318b nucleus (see table 7.1) and from several other regions in
the group.
An other interesting feature of SQ is the presence of a CO-rich (Braine et al., 2001; Lisenfeld et al.,
2002, 2004, 7× 108 M(cid:12)) region, SQ-B, located within the young tidail tail, to the south of NGC 7319.

overlaid on an HST image. Levels are 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, etc [Jy beam−1 km s−1.] The black contours are

This region is also bright in mid-IR (Xu et al., 1999), Hα (Arp, 1973a) and UV (Xu et al., 2005). The
H2 to H I gas mass ratio of 0.5 indicates that SQ-B is a tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG) candidate, i.e. a
small galaxy which is in the process of formation from the material of the NGC 7319’s tidail tail.
TDGs will not be further discussed, so we direct the reader to the concise review by Xu (2006) and

The gas metallicity in SQ-A and SQ-B is slightly higher than solar (Xu et al., 2003; Lisenfeld
et al., 2004) This is a strong indication that the gas in these regions has been pulled out from the inner
part of a galaxy disk (or maybe several disks) by tidal interactions.
7.3 New CO observations in the SQ ridge
Since none of the past CO observations in SQ yielded detections from the main area of interaction
between the new intruder (NGC 7318b) and the intragroup tidal tail, we decided to search for the
CO counterpart of the warm H2 gas seen by Spitzer. Our recent results are the result of an iterative
process that has involved three observing runs! Before showing that these results signiﬁcantly change
our view at the molecular gas in SQ (sect. 7.4), I ﬁrst quickly review the history of our observing runs.
7.3.1 History of our CO observations
In September 2007, we submitted a proposal (P.I.: P. Guillard) to observe the (2-1)CO line from the SQ
shock with the multi-beam (3 × 3 pixels) HERA receiver2 installed on the IRAM3 30-meter single-
dish telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain. The previous observations by Lisenfeld et al. (2002) did not
cover entirely the SQ ridge. Moreover, based on the fact that the H2 emission is extended, we argued
that much of the CO emission associated with the shock has been missed by previous interferometric
observations. We thought that HERA would provide us both the spatial distribution and kinematics of
the molecular gas across the shock front.
François and I performed the observations in January 2008 but we did not detect any obvious sig-
nal. No line was clearly detected. The Fig. 7.2 shows the CO(2-1) HERA spectra (in red) averaged on
the 9 pixels. Only a constant baseline was subtracted in the data reduction. In the eastern and western
A ∼ 1 mK) and broad (full width ∼ 500 km s−1) lines
(group/intruder) regions there may be weak (T ∗
at the right and left ends of the bandpass, which was ∼ 1200 km s−1. In the shock region, these
observations set an upper limit on the cold component of the molecular gas of a few 1020 H2 cm−2
for a standard H2/CO conversion factor. This upper limit is roughly the surface density of the warm
(∼ 200 K) molecular gas detected by Spitzer.
To conﬁrm or not this puzzling result, we wanted to make sure that the CO emission had not
been subtracted in the baseline in case it had a large linewidth ((cid:38) 1000 km s−1) comparable to that
of the ionized gas as measured by optical lines (e.g. the 6300Å O I line). Therefore, we submitted
a DDT proposal (P.I.: P. Guillard) to observed the (1-0)CO line with the single-pixel A-B receivers,
arguing that we would double the bandwidth we had with HERA (2-1)CO observations. The proposal
was accepted and observed in March 2008 by an astronomer on duty. However, when writing up the
proposal, we did not realize that the bandwidth of the A-B receivers is half (512 MHz) the bandwidth
of HERA (1 GHz). So we faced the same problem of baseline ﬁtting! The top spectrum in Fig. 7.2
shows the averaged CO(1-0) spectrum obtained with the AB receivers. The spectral resolution is
≈ 13 km s−1. Two very weak lines at 6050 and 6130 km s−1 are perhaps detected, but this hypothetic
detection is unreliable (< 3σ).

paper II, which was not available at the time of these ﬁrst CO observations. The central velocity is
6400 km s−1 on the spectra. Weak lines at 6050 and 6130 km s−1 are perhaps detected (< 3σ) on the
CO(1-0) spectrum. On the HERA CO(2-1) spectrum no clear detection of CO gas is seen.
7.3.2 Observations with the new EMIR reveiver at IRAM 30m telescope
In March-April 2009, a new heterodyne receiver, EMIR 4, was installed and commissioned at the 30m
telescope. It replaces the former ABCD single-pixel receivers. EMIR provides a bandwidth of 4 GHz
in each of the two orthogonal linear polarizations for the 3, 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm atmospheric windows.
This increase in bandwith is crucial for our study since we expect that the CO line width to be broad
(≈ 1 000 km s−1). The four EMIR bands are designated as E090, E150, E230, and E330 according to
their approximate center frequencies in GHz.
A proposal was submitted in March 2009 (P.I.: P. Guillard) to observe the CO(1-0) transition.
We required 32 hours of observations. Our goal was to reach a 0.3 mK rms noise on the T ∗
A scale
at 113 GHz, for a spectral resolution of 100 km/s. The proposal was accepted but only 16h were
allocated. I carried on the observations in June 28-30, 2009. I brieﬂy give some observational details
here and some preliminary results are given in the next paragraph, sect. 7.4.

Our observations were concentrated on the CO(1-0) line, because of summer weather conditions.
In addition, we were able to connect the third and fourth parts of the WILMA backend to the hori-
zontal and vertical polarizations of the E230 band. So we observed the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) lines at
115.27 GHz and 230.54 GHz. To increase the redundance for the CO(1-0) data, we used in parallel
the 4 MHz ﬁlterbank with both polarizations connected to the E090 band. The receivers were tuned
to 112.86 GHz and 225.72 GHz, which corresponds to a “redshift” of 6400 km s−1. The observations
were done in wobbler switching mode, with a wobbler throw of 120” in azimuthal direction. This ob-
servation mode provides accurate background subtraction and good quality baselines, which is crucial
for our study. Pointing and focus were monitored every 2h in stable conditions and every 1h during
A scale. The forward effciency
of the telescope was 0.94 and 0.91 at 115 and 230 GHz and the beam effciency was 0.78 and 0.58,

The data was reduced with the IRAM GILDAS 5 software package (version of July 2009). The
lowest quality spectra (typically with σ (cid:38) 30 mK for a 3 min on-source integration) were rejected. We
only subtract a constant when doing baseline ﬁtting. Unfortunately, we experienced problems with
the vertical polarization. These spectra show weird features and have been simply removed for this
preliminary analysis.
The results are beyond our expectations! The quality of the data was such that we were able to

the positions of our pointing (blue circles of diameter 22 arcsec, corresponding to the half-power
CO(1-0) beam) overlaid on a Spitzer 24 µm MIPS image of SQ. The three positions in the ridge are
designated as “Ridge 1, 2 and 3”, from North to South. The two other positions are centered on SQ-A
and the middle of the bridge feature in between NGC 7319 and the ridge. The black line shows the
4σ contours of the H2 0-0S(3) line emission detected by Spitzer (see sect. 6.2). Note that the half
power beam width at 115 GHz matches very well the width of the H2 emission in the ridge. The

7. Cold molecular gas in Stephan’s Quintet
Coming back to the previous observation run. . .
The reason why we did not detect any clear signal during our previous observations with HERA or
the ABCD receivers is not completely clear for us. The possible explanations are the following.
First, for the CO(1-0) ABCD position (see Fig. 7.2) we may have missed the molecular gas rich
ridge, because the position was not exactly centered on the H2 ridge. The central beam position was
offset to the East of the Appleton et al. (2006) position because we wanted to avoid the contamination
from star-forming regions. However, we did not have the full IRS mapping and the mid-IR imaging
at that time, so did not have any idea about the extent of the CO emission. So we may have offset our
central position too much, thus diluting the signal in the beam. This may explain the non detection
if the CO gas is conﬁned to a ≈ 25(cid:48)(cid:48)-wide ridge. However, since the H2 emission seems a bit more
extended, the beam dilution does not seem to be a very strong argument.
Second, during our ﬁrst run, we had lots of problems with the WILMA backend. Several pixels of
HERA were not usable, especially pixels 9 and 7, which were, unfortunately, located in the ridge. For
the second DDT run with the ABCD receiver, a lot of spectra also show weird features, and I had to
throw away ≈ 30% of spurious spectra. These technical problems may also have entrained calibration
issues in the data.
The non-detection in our previous HERA and ABCD observations led me to double-check my
data reduction for the new EMIR observations. I have checked that the signal is reproductible from
one day of observation to another, and search for any spurious features in the spectra. These checks,
and the fact that the line velocities are in very good agreement with H I velocities, allow to conﬁrm
our new results presented in the following.
7.4 Preliminary results
Since the data has been taken very recently, we present here a preliminary analysis that points out the
main observational results about the mass of molecular gas in the system and its kinematics.
7.4.1 Distribution and mass of molecular gas
In Fig. 7.3 we show the averaged CO(1-0) spectra for each of the ﬁve observed positions. The spectra
are plotted over the full available bandwidth (≈ 8000 km s−1 at 115 GHz) at a spectral resolution
of 42 km s−1. CO is detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio for all the pointings. This result is in
sharp contrast with the previous interferometric observations, where almost no CO was detected in the
ridge. It shows that the CO emission is extended and associated with the extended H2 emission. The
noise in the spectra are ≈ 0.5 − 0.7 mK at a resolution of 42 km s−1. The CO(2-1) is also detected
but the quality of the spectra is much poorer than the CO(1-0) because of a shorter integration time
and moderate weather conditions. This is why we only show the CO(1-0) spectra here.
The central velocity (0 km s−1 on the plots) corresponds to the recession velocity of 6400 km s−1
at which the receivers were tuned. The CO(1-0) signal extends over the velocity range ≈ 5700 −
7000 km s−1 (and perhaps until 7400 km s−1 for the ridge 1 position, see comment below). Multiple
velocity components are detected, pointing out the complexity of the kinematics of the CO gas in the
system (see next paragraph below for a discussion of the kinematics). The ﬁgures 7.4 and 7.5 shows a

derive the total mass of molecular gas, one has to multiply MH2 by a factor 1.36 to take into account
Helium. In the following we brieﬂy discuss the masses of molecular gas detected in the three main
area, the ridge, SQ-A, and the bridge.
CO in the SQ ridge Summing over all the velocity components, we derive ≈ 6 × 108 and 109 M(cid:12)
of cold molecular gas in the positions “ridge 1” and 2. For the “ridge 3” position, the spec-
trum is more noisy because of limited integration time, and we detect ≈ 7 M(cid:12) of cold H2 at
5700 km s−1. Our pointings do not cover entirely the ridge, but we can safely say that the total
mass of molecular gas in the ridge is at least 2.5 × 109 M(cid:12). It is only a factor of 2 larger than
the total warm H2 mass seen by Spitzer in the ridge (1.2 × 109 M(cid:12), see table 6.1). The mass of
molecular gas in the SQ shock is larger than in the Milky Way!

of 9.2× 108 M(cid:12). Lisenfeld et al. (2002) ﬁnd ≈ 3× 109 M(cid:12) over a much larger area (60(cid:48)(cid:48)

that partially overlaps the north of the ridge. However, because of a limited bandwith, they
only detect the 6000 and 6700 km s−1 velocity components, and they miss the higher velocity
component at 6900 km s−1 that seem to contain almost half of the mass in the core region of SQ-
A (see table 7.3). Based on our new IR maps, we estimate the area of SQ-A to be ≈ 40(cid:48)(cid:48)
× 40(cid:48)(cid:48).
If we scale the mass we ﬁnd in our aperture Ω to this larger aperture, we ﬁnd a total mass of
cold H2 of 2.6 × 109 M(cid:12). This is comparable to the mass derived by Lisenfeld et al. (2002),
which is the result of a lucky compensation between two effects, the over-estimate of the mass
in SQ-A because of a large aperture, and the under-estimate because of the non-detection of the
6900 km s−1 component.
CO in NGC 7319’s bridge Summing over all velocities, we ﬁnd MH2 = 1.2 × 109 M(cid:12) within our
aperture Ω. Note that our aperture matches quite well the width of the bridge, but does not cover
its whole extension towards the AGN. Therefore, the total mass of molecular gas in the bridge
may be a factor of ≈ 2 larger. Smith and Struck (2001) ﬁnd ≈ 5 × 109 M(cid:12) within a half-power
beam of 55” centered on the nucleus of NGC 7319. This beam overlaps our bridge region.
These observations represent a substantial revision of the mass and energy budgets of the collision.
The ﬁrst striking result is that we detect in the ridge and in the bridge features a comparable amount
of molecular gas to that of SQ-A. The CO emission in the intragroup medium is then very extended,
and in total (SQ-A + ridge + bridge), (cid:38) 6.5 × 109 M(cid:12) of cold H2 gas is lying outside the galactic
disks of the group. Although it represents a huge mass of molecular gas, most of this gas appears to
be inefﬁcient at forming stars, except in SQ-A (see chapter 8).
Interestingly, assuming a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor, we ﬁnd that the ratio of the cold
to warm H2 masses is ≈ 2 in the ridge. This ratio is much smaller than in galaxies, where the mass
of cold molecular gas is 1 − 2 orders of magnitude greater than the warm H2 mass: MH2(cold) =
10 − 100 × MH2(warm) (Roussel et al., 2007). This preliminary result seems in agreement with our
interpretation of the H2 emission in terms of a continuous heating by dissipation of turbulent energy
(see sect. 6.5.1).
7.4.2 Complex kinematics of the CO gas
Fig. 7.3 clearly show the complexity of the kinematics of the CO gas in the SQ group. The shape
of the spectra varies a lot from one position to another. Multiple velocity components are detected
(see Fig. 7.4 and 7.5 for detailed view at the spectra with some reference velocities overlaid). The
four main components are at 5700, 6000, 6700 and 6900 km s−1 (see table 7.3 for the precise central
line velocities derived from line ﬁtting). Note that the H I velocities detected in SQ are 5700, 6000
(associated with the intruder gas), and 6700 km s−1 (associated with the tidal tail to the south of
NGC 7319). The velocity component at 6900 km s−1 is a new feature that we detect only in the SQ-A
region. It was not seen before in CO or H I because of limited velocity coverage. The main general
results are the following:
• the gas associated with the intruder NGC 7318b (5700 − 6000 km s−1) and with the intragroup
medium (the tidal tail, 6700 km s−1) are both detected along the full North-South extension of
the ridge, and in the bridge eastern feature towards NGC 7319 as well.
7. Cold molecular gas in Stephan’s Quintet
• gas at intermediate velocities, in between that of the intruder and that of the intragroup, is
detected. There is a broad component centered at ≈ 6400 km s−1 in the ridge 1, 2 and in
the bridge positions. Interestingly, this intermediate component seems to be absent (or very
weak, ≈ 2σ) in SQ-A and vanishes at the southern end of the main shock region (ridge 3).
The 6400 km s−1 CO velocity component is consistent with the central velocity of the broad,
resolved H2 S(1) line at 6360± 100 km s−1 (see Appendix B of paper II for a re-analysis of the
Appleton et al. (2006) high-resolution IRS spectrum). This is the ﬁrst time CO gas is detected at
these intermediate velocities, and this gas is associated with the warm H2 seen by Spitzer. This
detection support the idea that molecular gas is formed out of gas accelerated in the shock.
• The CO line velocity components are very broad, suggesting that the kinematics of the CO gas
is highly disturbed. The FWHM of the main CO(1-0) lines are of the order of 100−400 km s−1,
with an even broader signal (≈ 1000 km s−1) at intermediate velocities (see coments below).
This suggests that huge velocity gradients are present in this region. These broad line widths
are in agreement with the Appleton et al. (2006) interpretation that the mid-IR H2 lines are
intrinsically very broad and resolved by the high resolution module of the IRS.
Some speciﬁc comments about each regions are given in the following:
SQ ridge In the ridge, the line widths are of the order of 100 − 400 km s−1, and lines seem to be
broader in the center (ridge 2) than at the edges (ridge 1 and 3). In the ridge 1 position (and
perhaps ridge 2), the underlying intermediate component at 6400 km s−1 is extremely broad
(≈ 1000 km s−1, comparable to the relative velocity between the intruder and the intragroup
medium), with a hint of emission between 6900 and 7400 km s−1 (see ridge 1 spectrum on
Fig. 7.4).
SQ-A In SQ-A, three velocity components are detected at 6000, 6700 and 6900 km s−1. The line
widths are of the order of 100 km s−1, with the smallest dispersion for the 6000 km s−1 line. The
broadest component at 6700 km s−1 seems to have a left wing extending towards 6400 km s−1.
Interestingly, the CO(1-0) line widths are signiﬁcantly smaller in SQ-A than in the (b)ridge, and
this is perhaps a clue to understand why there is much more star formation in this region than
in the ridge. This observational picture ﬁts within our interpretation of two colliding gas ﬂows
(presented in sect. 5.3.2), where the shear velocities between the ﬂows are maximum in the
central region of the contact discontinuity (ridge), and smaller at the edges of the main shock
structure (see chapter 4, sect. 4.5.3 and Fig 5 of Lee et al., 1996).
NGC 7319’s bridge The spectrum in the bridge is perhaps the most striking. It shows a very broad
signal in between the extreme velocities detected in SQ-A (6000 and 6900 km s−1), see Fig. 7.4.
This proﬁle is well ﬁtted by a sum of 3 gaussians. As discussed in sect. 6.7, the origin of the
molecular gas in the bridge structure is an open question. If an outﬂow from the AGN is present
(as suggested by Aoki et al., 1996), molecular may be entrained from the disk or formed directly
in the outﬂow (see also sect. 6.7 for observational details about NGC 7319). The molecular gas
in the bridge may also be the result of a previous tidal interaction (with NGC 7320c for instance)
that would have stripped some material from the galactic disk. Then the interaction between
7.5. Astrophysical questions raised by CO observations
the new intruder and this “tidal bridge” would trigger further molecular gas formation in this
region. We do not see any clear-cut argument to favor one of the two possibilities.
7.5 Astrophysical questions raised by CO observations
These CO observations essentially raise two open questions, one related to the dynamical coupling of
the molecular gas to the lower density phases, and the other related to star formation. Here are the
tracks we are following to tackle these two issues.
7.5.1 How is the molecular gas accelerated?
Observations shows that some of the CO gas lies at intermediate velocities between that of the intruder
(NGC 7318b) and that of the target, i.e. NGC 7319’s tidal tail. The CO line widths match that of the
[O I] λ6300 Å line from warm atomic gas. This suggests that the cold molecular gas is dynamically
coupled to the lower density components.
If the picture of two colliding multiphase gas ﬂows is
correct, these observations mean that, in the reference frame of the surface discontinuity between the
two gas streams (which may be materialized by the X-ray bright ridge), the dense clouds has been
signiﬁcantly decelerated.
This coupling seems difﬁcult to explain if most of the molecular gas was preshock gas. The high
density contrast between cold clouds and the hot, tenuous ﬂow would lead to deceleration timescales
longer than the shock age (see sect. 4.5.2), and therefore a weak coupling. In our model of H2 forma-
tion in the shock, the molecular gas is formed out of moderate density medium that is compressed and
decelerated while becoming molecular. Therefore, in this context, the coupling is much more efﬁcient
because the density contrast is much lower. This in-situ formation is perhaps a solution to explain
the high velocity dispersion seen in the spectra, although we do not exclude the presence of preshock
dense clouds.
7.5.2 Driving Schmidt-Kennicut into a corner
Many galaxy collisions are observed to trigger IR-luminous bursts of star formation. This is not
the case in SQ, although a large reservoir of cold molecular gas is present in the area of interaction
between the two galaxies. Fig. 7.6 shows a diagram similar to the classical Schmidt-Kennicutt rela-
tionship. Based on the empirical correlation between PAH emission and star formation in starbursts
(Calzetti et al., 2007; Pope et al., 2008), the 7.7 µm PAH emission is used as a tracer of star formation.
The cold H2 mass is derived from the standard CO(1-0) intensity to H2 mass conversion factor (see
chapter 3, Eq. 3.44). The SQ point corresponds to the ridge 1 position. The PAH luminosity in the SQ
shock is integrated over a 18(cid:48)(cid:48)
× 15(cid:48)(cid:48) region centered on the CO(1-0) beam of the ridge 1 position (see
chapter 8 for details about how the PAH luminosity is calculated).
We ﬁnd that SQ is offset from the correlation obtained with the SINGs sources (data taken from
Roussel et al., 2007). Interestingly, SQ has a similar offset as the H2-luminous radio galaxies 3C326N
and 3C293 (see chapter 9 for a discussion of 3C326N). This plot clearly shows that star formation is
suppressed in the center of the shock as compared to star forming galaxies.
7. Cold molecular gas in Stephan’s Quintet
Figure 7.6: Star-formation efﬁciency (assumed to be traced by the surface luminosity of the PAH
emission) as a function of mass of cold H2, derived from the CO(1-0) line intensity. The hatched
line shows the relationship obtained for the SINGS sample, where empty diamonds and ﬁlled dots
mark dwarf galaxies, star-forming galaxies, and AGN. The SINGS data is from Roussel et al. (2007).
The ﬁlled pentagon shows the center of the SQ shock. For comparison, the ﬁlled triangles mark the
H2-luminous radio galaxies 3C326 N and 3C293.
The molecular gas is observed to be more turbulent in the ridge than in SQ-A, where star formation
is occuring. This suggests that the dissipation of the mechanical energy may be an important process
in heating the molecular gas and perhaps quenching star formation (see paper I and chapter 8 for a
more detailed discussion of star formation in SQ).
7.6 Concluding remarks
These new CO observations provide a more complete inventory of the molecular gas in the SQ in-
tragroup medium. Large amounts of CO emitting gas is detected, both in the main shock region
and in the eastern bridge feature. This gas is coexisting with warm H2, H II gas, and X-ray emitting
hot plasma. The CO(1-0) lines are intrinsically broader outside the SQ-A and southern star-forming
regions, suggesting that the galaxy collision has disturbed its kinematics within the group halo.
A more detailed analysis and a paper is in preparation to estimate as precisely as possible the
mass, excitation characteristics (in particular the CO(2-1) to CO(1-0) line ratio), and the full kinetic
energy of the molecular gas in the SQ shock. This will lead to re-evaluate our prior estimate of the
dissipation timescale through H2 line emission. The velocity structure will be used to distinguish
7.6. Concluding remarks
between preshock molecular gas and molecular gas formed out of gas that has been shocked and
decelerated in the collision. In addition, we will use MHD shock models (similar to those used to
interpret the H2 line emission) to compute the CO emission in shocks, and compare the results with
the observations presented here.

Dust emission in Stephan’s Quintet

Dust in the wind

Abstract
Kerry Livgren, Kansas
In chapters 5 and 6, I propose an interpretation to the surprisingly bright H2 rotational line
emission from the Stephan’s Quintet (SQ) shock, in which H2 gas forms out of the multiphase
postshock gas. In this scenario, dust is a key-element because its presence is required for H2
to form. Therefore we expect that some of the dust emission comes from molecular gas. This
chapter is a brief introduction to the work I did on the analysis and modeling of new Spitzer
imaging and spectroscopy of dust emission in the SQ ridge. The associated paper is reproduced
in the manuscript. I have analysed the characteristics of the PAH emission in the shock, built a
complete IR spectral energy distribution of the shock, and compare it to that of the diffuse Galactic
ISM. In order to try to constrain the physical structure of the molecular gas, a detailed modeling
of the dust emission in the SQ ridge has been performed, and the model results compared to
observations.

8. Dust emission in Stephan’s Quintet
8.1 Introduction
Dust shapes the spectra of galaxies: dust absorbs1, scatters stellar light, and re-emits this energy
in the infrared domain. It is estimated that 30% or more of the energy emitted as starlight in the
Universe is re-radiated by dust in the infrared (see Lagache et al., 2005, for a review about the cosmic
IR background).
Molecular hydrogen forms on dust grains. Therefore, dust is a key-element for our interpretation
of H2 emission from the SQ X-ray bright shock structure. In paper I, we show that H2 gas can form
out of the dense gas that is shocked to velocities sufﬁciently low (Vs < 300 km s−1) for dust to
survive. One of the consequences of this interpretation is that some of the dust emission comes from
molecular gas. Therefore, in order to test this prediction, I have embarked on a study and modeling
of the dust emission from the SQ shock, which has been written in paper III (Guillard et al., 2009a),
which will be soon submitted to A&A. This chapter will not review the content of the paper, but rather
introduce the context of the past observations of dust emission from SQ, as well as their interpretation
(sect 8.2.1). Then, I brieﬂy present the context of the new Spitzer observations (sect 8.2.2, as well as
the paper III. The section 8.4 concludes this chapter by opening the discussion about dust survival in
the violent SQ environment, and more generally in the multiphase ISM.
8.2 Observations of dust emission from Stephan’s Quintet
8.2.1 Past observations (ISO)
IRAS ﬁrst detected SQ in the infrared (Allam et al., 1996; Yun et al., 1997), but it was barely resolved.
The ﬁrst quantitative study of dust emission in the SQ group was made possible by the ISO2 space
observatory. Xu et al. (1999, 2003) reported ISO observations that show that most of the mid-IR (11.3
and 15 µm) and Far-IR (60 and 100 µm) emission comes from the disks of NGC 7319 and of the
foreground galaxy NGC 7320 (see Fig. 8.1). Two intra-group medium (IGM) starbursts SQ-A and
SQ-B, both including several previously detected H II regions, stand out in the 15 µm image due to
their strong mid-IR emission. There is evidence for dust emission in the shock front. Xu et al. (2003)
have modeled the ISOPHOT3 maps at 60 and 100 µm to isolate emission from the shock (Fig. 8.1).
However, the angular resolution is marginally sufﬁcient to separate the shock itself from the SQ-A
and SQ-B star forming regions.
Based on ISO observations, the total dust luminosity of the shock front is Ldust = 1.9 × 1035 W
(Xu et al., 2003). This is about an order of magnitude higher than the X-ray luminosity. Xu et al.
(2003) concluded that dust cooling may be a signiﬁcant cooling mechanism for the shock. They
propose that the hot gas is predominantly cooled by electronic collisions with dust grains. This con-
clusion is based on the comparison between the sputtering time scale of dust grains and the gas cooling
1The existence of the extinction of stellar light by interstellar dust was found by Trumpler (1930) by measuring the
angular diameter of star clusters. They introduce a corrective term, Aλ, in their estimate of the distance to the source,
in order to take into account its overestimation due to the presence of dust. Stebbins (1934, 1935) ﬁrst showed that the
extinction follows a λ−1 law in the U, B, V bands. This law in the optical shows that the grain size is of the order of the
wavelength, i.e. 0.1 to 0.5 µm.

sion (background subtracted) at 100 µm are overlaid on the ISO 15 µm image. Left: The contour levels
for the 100 µm map are 0.8, 1.12, 1.6, 2.24, 3.2, 4.48, 6.4 MJy sr−1. Right: 100 µm emission after the

time. Assuming a constant, Galactic mass-to-dust ratio, the sputtering time of an a = 0.1 µm grain
is 3.7 × 106 yr, compared to the gas cooling time of 2.1 × 106 yr. Hence the big grains can indeed
survive the shock long enough. However, as shown in Smith et al. (1996) and Guillard et al. (2009c),
the sputtering of dust grains in the hot (T > 106 K) phase should have reduced signiﬁcantly the dust
to gas mass ratio on a timescale shorter than the gas cooling time (see chapter 2 and discussion later
in paper III).
8.2.2 New Spitzer observations
ISO observations have been followed up by Spitzer observations. Appleton et al. (2006) release a
spectacular composite image with IRAC (see the cover front of this manuscript!) at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8
and 8 µm. Images at 16 and 24 µm were obtained by our team and presented in Cluver et al. (2009)
and Guillard et al. (2009a). Longer wavelength images at 70 and 160 µm were obtained by Xu et al.
(2008). They claim to detect a signiﬁcant diffuse dust emission outside individual galaxies, amounting
to more than 50% of the total L160 µm of SQ (see also Natale, in preparation). Because of the better
correspondence between the morphology of the 160 µm map and that of the X-ray map, compared to
that between 160 µm and H I, the authors favor the possibility that the grains are collisionally heated
in the hot intra-group medium.
The presence of H2 gas in the intragroup set a new perspective on the origin of the dust emission
in the ridge. As introduced above, we expect some dust emission from the H2 gas. My work presented
in paper III explore this possibility.

8. Dust emission in Stephan’s Quintet
8.4 Perspectives on revisiting dust survival timescales: impact of the
multiphase ISM structure
Observations of dust, from PAHs to BGs, in the violent SQ galaxy collision is certainly a challenge for
dust evolution models, and has potentially important consequences for the estimate of dust survival in
the ISM.
So far, dust survival timescales are estimated by assuming that the shocked medium is homoge-
neous. Within the context of the SQ shock, the temperature of the hot plasma in constrains the shock
velocity in the tenuous gas to be ≈ 700 km s−1. If we assume that the shocked medium is homoge-
neous, all the dusty gas is shocked at these very high velocities, and thus the dust destruction timescale
would be much shorter than the dust re-formation time.
This issue is also true in the galactic ISM. Let us give a rough estimate of the dust survival
timescale in an homogeneous medium, following Jones (2004). Once a dust grain ﬁnds itself in
the ISM, it is subject to destruction by supernova shock waves. We calculate the the timescale for SN
shock waves to destroy all the dust in the ISM, tSN R. If (vs) is the efﬁciency of grain destruction
by a shock of velocity vs, Ms(vs) is the mass of gas shocked to a velocity of at least vs, τSN the
interval between supernovae, and MISM the total mass of the galactic ISM, then the timescale for
grain destruction is given by:
(cid:90)
(vs)dMs(vs) ≈
¯Ms(100 km s−1)
where ¯ is the mean grain destruction parameter, and Ms(100 km s−1) corresponds to a typical SN
shock that affects a sufﬁcient volume of the ISM. Now, to determine the mass shocked to a velocity of
at least vs, we exploit the conservation of the energy E released by the explosion of the SN and write
(McKee 1989, McKee (1989)):
Ms(vs) =
and then tSN R = σ
MISM τSN
s ≈ 4 × 108 yr ,
where σ = 0.736 (Ostriker & McKee 1988), and E = 1044 J. I use ¯ = 0.5, , MISM = 5 109 M(cid:12)
and τSN = 30 yr. On the other hand, Jones (2004) estimate the dust formation timescale to be
tf ≈ 3×109 yr. Clearly, by comparing tf and tSN R, dust destruction is faster than stardust formation.
This timescale discrepancy is clearly at odds with the observations of dust in the ISM! The conclusion
that is generally given is that dust must be (re)formed in situ in the ISM. This may be true, but the
exact way dust is re-accreted and re-coagulated is still poorly known .
Stephan’s Quintet observations may suggest an alternative solution to the issue of dust survival in
the ISM. As discussed in paper I, the density inhomogeneities in the preshock medium allow the dust
to survive, provided that the density contrast is high enough to reduce the transmitted shock velocity.
The multiphase nature of the ISM may increase signiﬁcantly the overall dust survival timescale.

H2 in galaxy evolution
There are 1011 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number.
But it’s only a hundred billion. It’s less than the national deﬁcit!
We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call
them economical numbers.

Abstract
Molecular gas is the reservoir for star formation, and thus plays a key role in galaxy evolution.
However, so far, the molecular gas has been largely ignored in the description of galaxy evolu-
tion in a cosmological context. In particular, the response of the molecular gas to gas accretion
onto galactic disks, galaxy merging, feedback, and its impact on the energetics of these major
evolutionary phases have so far not been addressed in detail. H2-luminous galaxies open a new
perspective for the study of molecular gas in active phases of galaxy evolution. Our interpretation
of the H2 emission from the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy collision set a theoretical framework that
may apply to other astrophysical situations. The H2-luminous radio-galaxy 3C326 is one exam-
ple, where H2 observations allow for the ﬁrst time to peer at the impact of the AGN-driven jet
onto the molecular gas of the host galaxy. Does the AGN feedback regulate or even suppress star
formation (negative feedback), or does it trigger star formation (positive)? This is a key question
in galaxy evolution.

9.1 Introduction
Understanding how galaxies formed and evolved is one of the major goals of modern extragalactic
astronomy. This dissertation is a ﬁrst step to address the role of molecular gas within this context.
The emerging population of H2-luminous galaxies (with enhanced mid-IR H2 line emission and rela-
tively weak star formation), includes galaxies in several key phases of their evolution, dominated by
9. H2 in galaxy evolution
gas accretion, galaxy interactions, or galactic winds driven by star formation and AGN. The analysis
presented in this manuscript suggests that the warm H2 contributes signiﬁcantly to the overall energy
budget of these galaxies, and may potentially play a central role for galaxy evolution.
This chapter introduces the role of the molecular gas for the energetics of star formation and
galaxy mass build-up (sect. 9.2). I point out some major astrophysical questions in this context, with
an emphasis on AGN feedback (sect. 9.2.2). Then I present the case of 3C326, a spectacular example
of an H2-luminous radio-galaxy for which I have applied the same analytical and numerical approach
as for Stephan’s Quintet to model the H2 emission and derive gas masses in the system. These results,
together with a detailed analysis of the energetics of the system, are gathered in Nesvadba et al. (2009)
(hereafter paper IV), submitted to A&A. The observational context of 3C326 is given in sect. 9.3.1
and the paper is reproduced in sect. 9.3.3. This chapter ends with a presentation of some observational
(sect. 13.1) and theoretical perspectives (sect. 13.2).
9.2 H2 and feedback in galaxy evolution
Thanks to ever-improving cosmological simulations, we now have a sound comprehension of structure
formation on the largest scales. Spectacular progress is made in describing the structure of dark matter,
and the history of star formation through cosmic time. However, describing galaxy evolution within
this picture is still a challenge.
The reason is that the build-up of baryonic mass in galaxies is regulated by a complex interplay
between gravitational collapse and feedback related to AGN and star formation. The dynamical in-
teractions between the ISM phases and their thermal properties play a key role in this regulation.
Fig. 9.1 illustrates schematically the mass and energy exchange between the ISM of a galaxy and its
halo’s environment. In the context of galaxy baryonic mass build-up, two processes compete. On
one hand, the activity of the black hole, and the bursts of star formation, create “galactic winds”, or
“superwinds” on galactic scales (e.g. Heckman et al., 1990) that push the hot/warm gas, and possibly
also molecular gas, into the galactic corona, or even further out to the intergalactic space (outﬂow).
The relative importance between the impact of black holes or stars depends on the mass of the galaxy,
more massive ones being dominated by the AGN activity (e.g. Dekel and Silk, 1986). On the other
hand, part of this matter does not escape the gravitational potential well of the galaxy, and falls back
onto the galactic disk. In addition, matter from the intergalactic medium, or from a companion galaxy,
is accreted onto the disk. These processes are particularly important during the early phases of galaxy
evolution at high redshift, when most of the stars in the universe were formed.
In this picture of galaxy formation and evolution, a lot of astrophysical questions remains. We still
do not know how gas that falls within dark matter haloes is accreting onto the galactic disk, and how
it comes to form stars. On the other hand, it is not clear what is the impact and efﬁciency of feedback
processes from stars or black holes on the molecular gas, and thus on star formation. These questions
are related to the regulation of mass build-up in galaxies described above. I will only focus on the
second aspect, which is closely related to the theoretical framework developed in my PhD work: What
is the impact of feedback on galaxy evolution?
Since H2 formation is a natural outcome of gas cooling, and since molecular gas represents the
reservoir for star formation, H2 gas must play an important role in all the processes listed above.
9.2. H2 and feedback in galaxy evolution
Figure 9.1: Sketch of the complex circulation of the multiphase interstellar matter during galaxy mass
build-up. The gas disk of the galaxy is fed by infall from intergalactic space and by gas raining down
from the halo. This gas ﬂows inwards and fuel star formation as well as the activity of the central
black hole. The blue and red arrows schematically outline these inﬂows and outﬂows, and the gas
cooling and heating. Observations show that H2 is a key actor in all stages. Adapted from Boulanger
et al. (2009).
Therefore, understanding the role that cold interstellar matter plays in the evolution of galaxies is a
key to elucidate the above questions. However, very little is known about its impact on the energetics
of feedback, and its response to it. In a sense, the Spitzer Space Telescope has opened a new obser-
vational window into the “molecular Universe” through mid-infrared observations of warm H2. In
the following I will emphasize what can we learn from H2 observations that may help in answering
these questions. I distinguish two types of feedback, depending on the powering sources: either star
formation or black hole.
9.2.1 Feedback from star formation: H2 in “superwinds”
Star formation is known from optical to X-ray observations of warm and hot gas to drive galactic
winds (Heckman et al., 1990, 2000). Superwinds are generated when the kinetic energy from stellar
winds and supernovae is thermalized, generating a region of very hot (T ≈ 107−108 K) high-pressure
plasma in the ISM of a starburst galaxy (Chevalier and Clegg, 1985). As the bubble breaks out of the

disk of the galaxy, the plasma expands producing a weakly-collimated bipolar outﬂow into the galaxy
halo. The outﬂowing plasma sweeps up and shocks ambient material, creating a superwind.
To understand the impact of these winds on star formation, and thereby on galaxy evolution in
general, it is crucial to constrain their impact on the multiphase interstellar medium of galaxies. Spitzer
mid-IR imaging and spectroscopy have revealed that winds are loaded with molecular gas and dust
(see the illustration for the wind of M82 in Fig. 1.3). However, the origin of this molecular gas is
still unclear. Is it material lifted up from the galactic disk, or is the molecular gas formed in situ, by
compression of dusty atomic gas that is advected in the ﬂow? We do not favor the ﬁrst interpretation
because the hot wind is too tenuous to lift up dense molecular clouds from the disk. If one considers
a molecular cloud of radius 10 pc and density 104 cm−3, entrained in a 500 km s−1 superwind at
density 10−2 cm−3, the acceleration timescale of the cloud would be (Eq. 4.30) ∼ 3 × 1010 yr, which
is much larger than the dynamical timescale of the outﬂow (∼ 107 yr). Following our scenario of H2
formation in the Stephan’s Quintet shock (chapter 5), we favor the second interpretation, in which the
H2 gas is formed outside galactic disks as the result of the dynamical interaction of the wind with gas
in the halo.
The molecular component has previously been ignored in galactic winds studies. Is the molecular
gas a dominant mass component of galactic winds? Does it share the outward ﬂow motion of the
lighter and warmer gas? Does it fall back on the disk? Is the emission from molecular gas the
main dissipative channel that sets the energetic efﬁciency of galactic winds? The answers to these
questions about molecular gas are essential to determine the impact of feedback from star formation
on the evolution of galaxies.
9.2.2 H2 and AGN feedback
An even more powerful source for feedback is the central engine of AGN, the supermassive black
hole in the center of the host galaxy. A small fraction of the energy released by the growth of the
black hole, if absorbed by interstellar matter in the host galaxy, could regulate or even quench star
formation by heating and ejecting ambient gas from the disk of the host galaxy under the action of an
AGN-driven outﬂow. This is the so-called negative AGN feedback. On the other hand, the impact of
the AGN could in principle be also positive, by triggering star formation through the interaction of the
AGN-driven jet with the ISM of the host galaxy.
Monsters needed to break the hierarchy!
This negative AGN feedback has been often invoked to explain the decline of star formation in mas-
sive, early-type galaxies (e.g. Silk and Rees, 1998; Springel et al., 2005; Croton et al., 2006; Hopkins
et al., 2006). The large majority of these galaxies appears to have formed most of their stars at high
redshift1, so that they are now “old, red, and dead”. These observations are in apparent contradiction
with a gradual, “bottom-up”, mass assembly. Under the assumption of hierarchical galaxy evolution,
one would naïvely think that the gas cools and is accreted gradually onto massive halos. So we should
1This is indicated by the redshift evolution of luminosity and mass functions of galaxies, and by the characterization of
stellar populations, chemical abundances, and structural properties of giant ellipticals in the local universe. Even a small
fraction of the gas returned by dying-stars gas should result in star formation rates much larger than observational estimates.
9.2. H2 and feedback in galaxy evolution
ﬁnd many more massive, blue, star-forming galaxies, particularly at the centers of groups and clus-
ters. This is called the hierarchical problem. AGN “monsters” are then called to break the hierarchical
scenario!
It is worth mentioning that an other alternative mechanism, called morphological quenching, has
been recently proposed by Martig et al. (2009) to account for “red” early-type galaxies. Based on
cosmological simulations, they propose that star formation is quenched when the galaxy experiences
a morphological transition from a rotating stellar disk to a pressure-dominated stellar spheroid, which
induces a steeper potential well and reduces the disk selfgravity. In their simulations, this transition
results from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for instance by galaxy merging. The gas in the disk
of the galaxy becomes stable against fragmentation, thus reducing star formation efﬁciency. Though
interesting, this process may not be directly related to H2-luminous objects since it appears that a
powerful source of mechanical energy is needed to explain the H2 emission.
H2-luminous galaxies as a tool to study AGN feedback
Despite its potential importance, dixit Matthew D. Lehnert, “AGN feedback has remained in the realm
of theoretical deus ex machina”. We still do not understand how the transfer of energy from the AGN
to the surrounding gas occurs. In particular, a major question is to determine the impact of the AGN-
driven jet to the molecular gas settled in the disk of the host galaxy. Is the ISM of the host galaxy
blown up in the outﬂow, thus supressing star formation (negative feedback)? Or does the jet trigger
shock-compression of clouds, thus enhancing star formation (positive feedback)? Or is it both?
Evidences for AGN feedback are now growing. Observations suggest that AGN feedback may be
associated mostly with radio-loud AGN. Perhaps the most striking examples are nearby clusters of
galaxies, in which the central black hole(s) inject a huge amount of energy (typically ≈ 1060 erg for
the most massive ones) over a rather short timescale (≈ 107 yr), which seems enough to prevent the
cooling of the gas through X-ray emission. This may be an explanation to solve for the “cooling ﬂow
problem”, in which the amount of hot gas that cools radiatively (inferred from soft X-ray observations)
is much less than expected from the harder X-ray luminosity (see McNamara and Nulsen, 2007, and
references therein for a review). A number of observations show that cool-core clusters contain large
amounts of molecular gas at their center. H2 was ﬁrst detected through its near-IR ro-vibrational
lines. Warm H2 has since also been observed through its mid-IR rotational lines with Spitzer (see
chapter 1, sect. 1.2.2, Fig. 1.5 and e.g. Egami et al., 2006). Numerous CO detections have also been
reported but the spatial distribution and kinematics of the cold molecular gas has only been imaged in
a few clusters. For instance CO observations reveal a large amount (≈ 1011 M(cid:12)) of cold molecular gas
extending in the halo to several tens of kpc from the central elliptical galaxy NGC 1275 (Salomé et al.,
2006) in the Perseus A galaxy cluster. This molecular gas is observed to be surprisingly inefﬁcient at
forming stars.
Radio galaxies are interesting targets to elucidate the physical mechanisms whereby the AGN can
regulate the star formation in its host galaxy. Indeed, radio-galaxies have an AGN and an obvious
source of mechanical energy which reaches large scales. They also show signs of outﬂows (Nesvadba
et al., 2006, 2008b, 2009; Holt et al., 2008), strong turbulence, and dissipation of mechanical energy
(Ogle et al., 2007, 2009). For the ﬁrst time, observations of warm molecular gas in radio-galaxies
allow to peer at the impact of the radio jet on the energetics of the dense molecular gas, and thus on

star formation. Ogle et al. (2009) ﬁnd that about 30% of nearby powerful radio galaxies may fall into
the class of H2-luminous galaxies presented in chapter 1, which have signiﬁcant amounts of relatively
dense, warm, and surprisingly turbulent molecular gas, but very little star formation.
In the following I shall focus on the example of the 3C326 radio-galaxy, which has been studied
in detail by applying the methods developed during my PhD work.
9.3 Are we witnessing negative AGN feedback in the radio galaxy 3C326?
The radio galaxy 3C326 is an outstanding source to study the impact of the radio jets on its molecular
gas, and paper IV presents such a study. We report new CO observations of that source that comple-
ment the mass and energy budget of the molecular gas in 3C326. We interpret line emission from the
ionized and molecular gas within the framework I have developed for the Stephan’s Quintet.
The paper IV is reproduced at the end of this chapter. I only give here a brief summary of the main
points, as well as additional ﬁgures and results from my modeling of H2 excitation in that source. We
ﬁnd that the ISM of this galaxy has very unusual properties: the molecular gas budget is dominated
by warm gas at temperatures T > 100 K, while diagnostic line ratios suggest that the ionized and
molecular gas is mostly excited through shocks.
We also identify a signiﬁcant outﬂow of neutral gas which cannot be explained by star formation.
We explain these observations through a common physical framework where a fraction of the me-
chanical energy of the radio jet is being dissipated on small scales within the molecular gas, which
powers the observed H2 emission. This is an extension of the classical “cocoon” model, in which the
AGN-driven jet inﬂates a “cocoon” of hot gas that accelerates the warm medium. We now explicitly
take into account the multiphase character of the ISM and ﬁnd that only a small fraction (∼ 10%)
of the jet mechanical energy is need to power the H2 emission. The timescale of dissipation of the
jet mechanical energy (107 − 108 yr) suggests that the jet could heat the molecular on timescales
comparable, or even longer, than the jet lifetime, thus limiting star formation over a long-lasting pe-
riod of time. Studies of repeated jet activity in radio galaxies suggest that the phse of “quiessence”
between two activity cycles could be of similar duration. Thus, the physical gas conditions in AGN
host galaxies may play an important role in regulating this cyclical jet activity.
To introduce the paper IV that presents a detailed analysis of the energetics of the molecular gas
in 3C326, I brieﬂy present the observational status of 3C326.
9.3.1 Observational context
Two companions. . .
3C326 is one of the largest radio sources known (Willis and Strom, 1978), with an angular size of
19.5” (1.9 Mpc).
It is a system of two companions, 3C326 N (N being for North) and 3C326 S
(South), at a redshift of z = 0.089 ± 0.001. Fig. 9.2 shows a radio (left) and a mid-IR (right) image
of the pair. It is not clear which of the two galaxies hosts the AGN that produced the Mpc-scale radio
lobes (see Rawlings et al., 1990).
The galaxy 3C326 N has been classiﬁed as a LINER from optical spectroscopy (Rawlings et al.,
It has strong [O II], Hα, [S II], and weak [O III] lines, whereas 3C 326 S has no detected

emission lines (Rawlings et al., 1990; Simpson et al., 1996). Rawlings et al. (1990) suggest that
3C 326N is more typical of FR II radio galaxy hosts than its South companion.
. . . but one H2-luminous source
Based on this observational context, Ogle et al. (2007) targeted the northern companion, 3C326 N,
with the Spitzer IRS, and found extraordinary powerful H2 rotational line emission. The total emission-
line luminosity of 3C326 N is L(H2) = 8.0 ± 0.4 × 1034 W (integrated over the lines S(1) to S(7)).
The ratio of the H2 luminosity of the 8 − 70 µm integrated infrared luminosity is 0.17 ± 0.02, which
is 1 − 2 orders of magnitude higher than normal star-forming galaxies (see discussion in chapter 1).
The optical and mid-IR spectra of 3C326 N (see Fig. 1.2, Fig. 1.4 and Ogle et al., 2007, 2009)
suggest a very weak star forming rate (∼ 0.07 M(cid:12) yr−1) although the galaxy holds a large mass of
H2 gas (≈ 109 M(cid:12)).
9.3.2 H2 excitation in 3C326
Like in Stephan’s Quintet, the H2 emission in 3C326 is associated with the dissipation of mechanical
energy. I have used the grid of MHD shocks presented in chapter 4 to quantify the range of preshock

density and shock velocities that ﬁts the oberved H2 line ﬂuxes.
The results of the modeling of the H2 excitation are gathered in Tables 6 and 7 of paper IV. To
complement these tables, Fig. 9.3 shows the observed and modeled H2 excitation diagram for 3C326.
As discussed in chapter 6, these ﬁts are not unique. I show here the results for two preshock densities,
nH = 103 and 104 cm−3. The lowest preshock density (103 cm−3) is need to ﬁt the 0-0S(0) line,
where higher excitation lines S(6) and S(7) require higher densities or higher velocity shocks. Please
see paper IV for a discussion of the results, in particular the mass and energy budgets of the molecular
gas in this galaxy.

Abstract
Shortly after the beginning of my PhD, I got involved in the european consortium of the Mid-
InfraRed Instrument (MIRI), part of the scientiﬁc payload of the James Webb Telescope (JWST). I
participated to the cryogenic tests of the instrument and to the preparation of a science proposal
related to the physics of H2 emission in distant galaxies. This chapter present the necessary back-
ground needed for the next chapters that discuss my contribution to the testing of MIRI (chap. 11)
and to its science applications (chap. 12). The JWST is a large (6.5 m in diameter) near- and
mid-infrared space telescope that will succeed to the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes. We
present an overview of the JWST and its science instruments, with emphasis on MIRI. MIRI pro-
vides imaging, coronagraphy and spectroscopy over the 5− 28 µm band. Its characteristics (data
acquisition, observing modes, etc.) and performance (sensitivity) are described.

10.1 Introduction
The James Webb Telescope (hereafter JWST), giant successor to the Hubble and Spitzer space
telescopes, is in preparation since 20 years. We are now in the phase where the ﬂight model
instruments have been built and are being tested. The french community, led by the CEA Saclay, IAS
10. The JWST observatory and its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)
Orsay, Meudon and Marseille institutes, took the responsibility of the mid-infrared (5 − 29 µm) cam-
era, a sub-component of the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI), which is one of the four instruments
onboard the JWST.
Six months after the beginning of my PhD, Alain Abergel, who had worked in collaboration with
CEA to the deﬁnition of the optical performance tests of the instrument, offered me to be part of the
MIRI test team, in order to participate in the optical test of the MIRI camera taking place at the CEA,
Saclay. Needless to say that I accepted without hesitating! I was interested in opening my skills to
instrumentation, but also in gaining knowledge of the MIRI instrument, that will be a milestone of
future mid-IR astronomy, and an ideal tool to study the H2-luminous objects we have been speaking
about in the previous chapters. In a sense, this project integrates very well in the science topic of this
thesis manuscript.
I soon realized that I was a a tiny grain of sand in an enormous project! In order to have my own
and little contribution to the project, I decided to focus on the tests of the Point Spread Function of
the instrument, one of the tests designed to check the optical quality of the instrument. I participated
in the tests and took the lead of the data analysis of the PSF measurements. This work is described in
the next chapter (chap. 11).
In this chapter we provide the necessary background to the next two chapters that present my
contributions to the MIRI testing and to the preparation of scientiﬁc projects related to the physics of
the H2 emission in active phases of galaxy evolution (chap. 12). I ﬁrst give a brief overview of the
JWST mission, with emphasis on its science instruments. Then I describe in more detail the MIRI
instrument I have been working on (sect. 10.3). Imaging and spectroscopic observation modes and
sensitivities are discussed. This chapter can also be viewed as an up-to-date working document useful
to prepare observations.
10.2 JWST mission overview
Impressive numbers!
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large IR (0.6 − 28 µm) telescope with a 6.5 m primary
mirror (see Gardner et al., 2006, for a review of the JWST implementation). The Fig. 10.1 shows the
main components of the JWST observatory. The launch is planned in 2014, on an Ariane 5 rocket.
The JWST will be put in a Lissajous orbit around the Earth-Sun L2 point. Here are a few more ﬁgures
just to say that it’s an enormous project! The total mass of the observatory is ∼ 6 200 kg. JWST is
an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian
Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is managing the development effort
and the prime contractor is Northrop Grumman. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) will
operate JWST after launch. The life-cycle cost of the project is estimated at about US$4.5 billion, for
a lifetime of 5 years minimum.
The JWST project started in 1989 (already 20 years ago!), when STScI decided to think about a
follow-up to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Prior to September 10, 2002, the JWST was known
as the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). JWST was renamed to honor the NASA’s sec-
ond administrator, James Webb (1906-1992), who supervised the Gemini program, pathﬁnder to the
preparation of the Apollo moon program.
10.2. JWST mission overview
Figure 10.1: The JWST observatory and its optical telescope
The JWST observatory is comprised of the following elements: the spacecraft, the optical tele-
scope element (OTE), and the integrated science instrument module (ISIM).
10.2.2 The spacecraft
The JWST spacecraft is comprised of two elements, the spacecraft bus and the sunshield (see the top
right panel of Fig. 10.1):
1. The sunshield subsystem separates the observatory into a warm sun-facing side (spacecraft bus)
10. The JWST observatory and its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)
and a cold anti-sun side (OTE and ISIM). It enables passive cooling of telescope and instruments
(the operating temperature has to be kept under 50 K). The sunshield consists of ﬁve layers of
thin membranes made from a polymer-based ﬁlm (Kapton with aluminum and doped-silicon
coatings) and supporting equipment such as spreader bars, booms, cabling, and containment
shells. When fully deployed, the sunshield that will be about the size of a tennis court!
2. The spacecraft bus provides the support functions for the operation of the JWST Observatory.
The bus houses the six major subsystems needed to operate the spacecraft: the Electrical Power
Subsystem, the Attitude Control Subsystem, the Communication Subsystem, the Command and
Data Handling Subsystem, the Propulsion Subsystem, and the Thermal Control Subsystem.
The JWST architecture, its expected performance and the plans for integration and testing are
described in more detail in Nella et al. (2004). Even though many details in the design have changed
since the article was written, many of the design choices and procedures are still valid.
10.2.3 The eye of the JWST
The Fig. 10.2 shows some views at the JWST mirror. The JWST telescope has a three-mirror anas-
tigmatic design, with a 25 m2 collecting area (equivalent to a ∼ 6 m circular primary), which is ∼ 7
times the collecting area of the HST. The effective focal ratio is f /16.67, and the effective focal length
is 131.4 m. The primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal segments (∼ 1.3 m ﬂat-to-ﬂat side), in two
rings around the center, resulting in a 6.5 m ﬂat-to-ﬂat diameter. Each segment is made of Beryllium,
and has the correct off-axis surface at the nominal cryogenic 40 K temperature of the primary. The
mirrors are gold coated, providing a broad spectral bandpass, from 0.6 to 29 µm.
The wavefront sensing and control subsystem is used to align the segments so that their wavefronts
match properly, creating a diffraction-limited image. Each segment will have six actuators to change
its focal length. The secondary mirror has 6-degrees of adjustment for collimation and overall focus.
Once aligned (about 2 − 3 months after launch), the telescope is designed to be diffraction limited
at 2 µm (Strehl ratio of 0.80) and have an encircled energy of 75% within a 0.15 arcsecond radius at
1 µm (dominated by sub-segment errors). It is estimated that the backplane will be sufﬁciently stable
during slews that the wavefront control adjustments will be needed less than once every two weeks.
10.2.4 Deployment and commissioning
A 6 m telescope does not ﬁt into any launch rocket! The JWST is thus a deployable satellite (Fig. 10.3).
During transfer to L2 the different elements of JWST will be deployed and commissioning will start.
The observatory has ﬁve deployment stages1 involving the following elements: 1) spacecraft ap-
pendages (solar arrays, high gain antenna), 2) sunshield, 3) extend tower, 4) secondary mirror, and 5)
primary mirror. All critical deployment points have heaters and can be unlatched and re-latched to
relieve any residual long term stress in the structure, even in the cold of outer space.
Deployment of the observatory will start fairly soon after launch, with the sunshade unfolding
after 2 days and the secondary and primary mirror deploying after approximately 4 days. First light
will occur at about 28 days after launch, initiating wavefront sensing and control activities to align the

be ready for normal science operations approximately 6 months after launch.

10.2.5 Science instruments on-board JWST
Fig. 10.4 shows the four science instruments gathered into the integrated science instrument module
(ISIM):
NIRCam: A Near-Infrared Camera (0.6 − 5 µm), provided by the University of Arizona. It consists
of two broad- and intermediate-band imaging modules, each with a 2.16 × 2.16 arcmin ﬁeld of
view. The modules have a short and a long wavelength channel, taking images simultaneously
with light split by a dichroic at about 2.35 µm. The short wavelength channel (0.6 − 2.3 µm) is
sampled at 4096 × 4096 pixels (0.0317 arcsec/pixel), the long wavelength channels by 2048 ×
2048 pixels (0.0648 arcsec/pixel). The short and long wavelength arms are Nyquist sampled
at 2 and 4 µm respectively. NIRCam has ten mercury-cadmium-telluride (HgCdTe) detector
arrays, analogous to CCDs found in ordinary digital cameras. Coronagraphs are available in
both modules. At the same time it serves as a wavefront sensor for the observatory, measuring
the alignment of the 18 mirror pieces of the 6.5m primary mirror.
NIRSpec: A Near-Infrared Spectrograph (0.6 − 5 µm), mainly provided by the European Space
Agency, under an industrial contract with Astrium. NIRSpec provides 3 observing modes: a
low resolution R ∼ 100 prism mode, an R ∼ 1000 multi-object mode and an R ∼ 3000
integral ﬁeld unit or long-slit spectroscopy mode.
In the R ∼ 100 and R ∼ 1000 modes, NIRSpec uses a micro-electromechanical system
(MEMS) to provide dynamic aperture shutter masks ("microshutter array"). These masks al-
low to obtain simultaneous spectra of more than 100 objects in a > 9 arcmin2 ﬁeld of view

Guidance Sensor and Tunable Filter Imager (FGS-TFI), the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), The

the instruments (blue cover behind the telescope, and zoom inset).
(∼ 3.4 × 3.4 arcmin2 at 1 µm). At R ∼ 100 one prism spectrum covers the full 0.6 − 5 µm
wavelength range. At R ∼ 1000, three gratings cover 1 − 5 µm. NIRSpec detectors are two
HgCdTe arrays.
MIRI: A Mid-InfraRed Instrument, developed by a European consortium of more than 20 scien-
tiﬁc institutes, nationally funded, with IR detectors and the active cooling system provided by
NASA/JPL. MIRI provides imaging and spectroscopy over the 5 − 27 µm wavelength range.
Its design consists of two main modules, an imager and an Integral Field Unit (IFU) medium
resolution spectrograph (MRS). Section 10.3 describes the instrument in more details.
FGS-TFI: The Fine Guidance Sensor, provided by the Canadian Space Agency, contains a dedicated
Guider and a Tunable Filter Camera. The guider is a sensitive camera that provides support for
the observatory’s attitude control system (ACS). It is used for both "guide star" acquisition and
ﬁne pointing. The sensor operates over a wavelength range of 1 to 5 µm and has two HgCdTe
detector arrays. The camera can image two adjacent ﬁelds of view, each approximately 2.4×2.4

of view (FOV) is shown. Instruments share a ∼ 166 arcmin2 FOV. The orange area shows where the
wavefront error (WFE), that results from residuals in the optical design, is smaller than 131 nm rms.
This is required for the NIRCam ﬁeld, to be diffraction-limited at 2 µm. The outer black area in the
ﬁgure represents portions of the ﬁeld of view that have some amount of vignetting.
arcmin2 in size.
A science instrument known as the FGS Tunable Filter Imager (FGS-TFI) is packaged with the
guide camera, but is functionally independent. The FGS-TFI will be used solely for science
observations. It has a selectable band of resolution R ∼ 100 across its 2.2 × 2.2 arcmin2 ﬁeld
between 1.5− 5 µm, with a gap between 2.6 and 3.1 micrometers. Tunable Fabry-Perot etalons
illuminate the detector array with a single order of interference at a user-selected wavelength.
The camera has a single HgCdTe detector array.
10.3 The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)
10.3.1 Overview of MIRI
Fig. 10.7 shows the whole ﬁeld of view (FOV) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) focal plane.
MIRI is comprised of an imager (henceforth MIRIM) and an IFU spectrograph (MRS, § 10.3.4) that
cover the wavelength range ∼ 5 − 28 µm. MIRIM features three observing modes plus an alignment
check mode:

Figure 10.7: Schematic view of the MIRI’s focal plane. The biggest 1.9×1.9 arcmin2 square is the im-
ager ﬁeld of view. One quarter of the ﬁeld of view is devoted to coronagraphy (with three 4-Quadrant
Phase Mask and one Lyot Mask coronographs), a 5 arcsec wide strip is used for low-resolution spec-
troscopy (LRS), and the remaining 1.4×1.9 arcmin2 is available for broad-band imaging. The smallest
square on the bottom left is the ﬁeld of view of the medium resolution spectrometer. (From Gardner
et al., 2006).
Coronagraphic mode: one Lyot mask (23 µm) and three 4-Quadrant Phase-Masks (4QPM at 10.65,
11.4, 15.5 µm) are ﬁxed in a sub-area of the focal plane. The 4 corresponding pupil diaphragms
are located in the ﬁlter wheel. The Lyot mask is a classical coronograph with an occulting
disk that blocks the direct starlight. The 4QPM coronagraph is based the peculiar design of
binary phase mask (0, π) dividing the full ﬁeld of view at the focal plane in four quadrants.
The mutual destructive interferences of the coherent light of a source, perfectly centered on the
mask, produce a total nulling within the pupil image (see e.g. Rouan et al., 2000, for details).
The coronographic mode of MIRI will not be further discussed here.
Low-Resolution Spectrometer: The slit is ﬁxed in the focal plane and the dispersive element (a
double prism) in the ﬁlter wheel (LRS, § 10.3.3).
Alignment check mode: a tool to check the alignment of MIRIM with respect to the telescope. It
includes a fused silica lens in the ﬁlter wheel to defocus the image of an on-axis point source
on the detector.
Fig. 10.8 shows the whole Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and its structural design. The MIRI
structure design uses a six-strut (hexapod) mount that provide the degrees of freedom for kinematic
mounting to the ISIM. With the exception of the struts and some ﬁlters and prisms, the instrument is
made entirely from 6061 aluminium alloy. The nominal operating temperature for the MIRI is 7K.
This level of cooling cannot be attained using the passive cooling. Instead, a cryocooler is used. First, a

pulse tube precooler gets the instrument down to 18K, and then a Joule-Thomson loop heat exchanger
cools it down to 7K. The cryocooler compressor assembly and control electronics are housed in the
Spacecraft Bus (see Fig. 10.1).
10.3.2 MIRIM: broad-band imaging and coronography
Optical layout We brieﬂy describe the optical layout of the camera, shown in Fig. 10.10. The
footprints of the beams for 3 different off-axis ﬁelds are overlaid on the mechanical layout. The
JWST input beam enters MIRIM’s focal plane via the Input Optics and Calibration unit (IOC, see
Fig. 10.8). The cold MIRIM FOV is 72.76 mm × 72.76mm at focal plane, where the coronograph
masks are ﬁxed. M1 is a collimating mirror (focal length = 352 mm), and M2 is a ﬂat folding mirror
that directs the beam to the cold stop and the ﬁlter wheel. The cold stop is a diaphragm required at the
OTE pupil image location to reduce the amount of stray light. Because the shape of the diaphragms
used for imaging or coronography are different, the use of a single cold stop for all the modes is not
possible. Thus, a “pseudo cold stop” is located 10 mm along the optical axis before the OTE pupil
image. The diaphragms (mean diameter value around 19 mm), adapted for each mode and attached
to the ﬁlter wheel, are located exactly at the OTE pupil image position. The M3, M4 and M5 mirrors
form a Three-Mirror Anastigmatic (TMA) objective that reﬂects the light on the detector array.
Imager and coronographic ﬁlters The useful area for the imaging mode is 47.79 × 71.76 mm2,
corresponding to 1.25 × 1.88 = 2.35 arcmin2 on the sky (see Fig. 10.10, bottom). The imager will
have a pixel scale of 0.11 arcsec/pixel. As the coronagraphic masks are transparent, the area used for
the coronagraphic mode could be marginally used in the imaging mode. The only moving part of the
imager is an 18-position ﬁlter wheel. Filter positions are allocated as follows: 12 ﬁlters for imaging,
4 ﬁlter and diaphragm combinations for coronagraphy, 1 ZnS-Ge double prism for the low-resolution
spectroscopic mode, and 1 dark position. The list and properties of the MIRIM ﬁlters are given in

mode will not be detailed here, and we direct the reader to Boccaletti et al. (2005) for details.
Calibration A calibration facility is dispatched over the IOC and MIRIM. The calibration is achieved
through a dedicated optical path, by imaging a point source at the internal edge of the OTE pupil im-
age. The light is reﬂected through the TMA to illuminate uniformly the detector.
10.3.3 MIRIM: the Low-Resolution Spectrometer (LRS)
The low resolution spectroscopic mode is achieved by a couple of Ge and ZnS prisms, attached to
the ﬁlter wheel. The ﬁrst Ge prism cancels the deviation due to the ZnS dispersive prism. The slit
is located at the edge of the coronagraphic mask mounting (see Fig. 10.10, bottom). The spectrum
(5− 10 µm) is spread over ∼ 3.5 mm over the detector array, so ∼ 140 pixels. The nominal resolving
power at 7.5 µm is R = 98.5 ± 6.0.

Observatory.
10.3.4 The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS)
The Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) is an Integral Field Unit (IFU) that allows spectroscopy
to be carried out on a 2-dimensional area of sky in a single observation. Fig. 10.12 illustrates its
working principle and Fig. 10.13 shows the optical and mechanical layout of the MRS. The rectangular
ﬁeld of view is divided into narrow slices by mean of a image-slicer mirror. The image slices are
arranged along the entrance slit mask (bottom panel of Fig. 10.13) of a ﬁrst-order diffraction grating,
which carries out the dispersion, and imaged onto two 1024 × 1024 pixels Si:As chips.
The band (5 − 29 µm) is divided into 4 IFU channels (Fig. 10.13), which are observed simultane-
ously. Each channel is equipped with an IFU image slicer designed to match the width of each slice to
the diffraction-limited point-spread function of the telescope, at the wavelength of each channel. The
spectral band of each IFU channel is subdivided into 3 sub-bands (A, B and C) by means of dichroic
ﬁlters. Thus, an observation over the entire spectral band is carried out in a set of three exposures.
The table 10.2 gathers the main functional parameters of the MRS. The spectral resolution is
R ∼ 3000 over the 5 − 29 µm wavelength range. The ﬁeld of view ranges from 3.7 × 3.7 arcsec to
7.7 × 7.7 arcsec2 with increasing wavelength, with pixel sizes from 0.2 to 0.65 arcsec. Within this
overall ﬁeld of view, the region of sky corresponding to a spatial sample is set by the slice width in

exposures overlap.
the perpendicular to the slice direction (across), and by the pixel ﬁeld of view in the slice direction
(along). The slice widths have been chosen to have odd integer multiples of their half widths matched.
The result is that a single telescope offset (of 0.97 arcseconds in the across slice direction and a mul-
tiple of 0.10 arcseconds in the along-slice direction) will provide full spatial sampling in all channels
simultaneously.
10.3.5 MIRI’s detectors, chip readout and sub-arrays
MIRI has three 1024 × 1024 pixels Arsenic-doped Silicon (Si:As) sensor chip arrays (SCA), two for
the MRS, one for the imager (Fig. 10.14, top left). With 25 µm × 25µm pixels, the detecting area in
approximately 1 inch × 1 inch. The previous generation’s similar IR detectors at these wavelengths
(5 − 28 µm) were the 256 × 256 pixels, 30 µm-pitch, Si:As devices built for the IRAC instrument
on-board Spitzer. The main characteristics of the MIRI detector are gathered in table 10.3. We direct
the reader to Love et al. (2005, 2006) for more details.

calculated from that time base. This time between pixel samples, td = 10 µs, is set by the Focal Plane
Electronics master 100 kHz clock. A “frame”, the next unit of time, is the number of clock cycles
needed to scan through the array, which represents
tframe = (256 pixels + 8 for references + 5 for reset) × (1024 rows) × 10 µs = 2.755 s
A “group” is a number of frames that are read and coadded together. MIRI does not generally use
this feature, so that there is only one frame per group. An “integration” is the length of time the
detector is allowed to collect light before resetting to zero, and is deﬁned to be an integer number of
frame times in length. Single integrations may range from 3 seconds (2.755 to be precise) up to 4 000
seconds. An “exposure” is the length of time MIRI is allowed to collect light before some intervention
is needed, e.g. dithering the telescope, changing ﬁlters, etc. An exposure is the level at which MIRI
is commanded: a command is sent with the number of frames, groups, and integrations that sets up
MIRI, and a “GO” command is received to begin the actual exposure.
Two readout modes are implemented, the “Fast” and “Slow” modes. They apply to different kinds
of astrophysical observations:
Fast Mode For MIRI observations of bright objects and long wavelength imaging, short source- or
background-limited exposures will be used. Observations of the following types will utilize the
Fast Mode:
10. The JWST observatory and its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)
• Broadband imaging at longer wavelengths (λ > 12 µm)
• Bright object imaging at all wavelengths
• Bright objects with MRS spectroscopy
Some examples of bright objects include nearby star forming regions, the Galactic center, and
more generally targets that lie in the Galactic plane. The Fast Mode is simply reading out the
array at the fastest possible speed. Each pixel is addressed during the 10 µs window, sampled
once after an appropriate amount of settling time, and the digitised data is sent out to the ISIM.
Frame times in fast mode are ∼ 3 seconds.
Slow Mode For many MIRI observations involving faint objects, deep imaging and MRS spec-
troscopy, long background-limited exposures will be required to achieve the needed sensitivity.
Observations using SLOWMode will include the following:
• Broadband imaging at short wavelengths (λ < 12 µm)
• R ∼ 100 LRS spectroscopy
• MRS spectroscopy
The Slow Mode increases the overall integration time with the SCAs in the following way. The
FPE dwells on a pixel for 10 sample periods (or 100 µs) resulting in a frame time that is ∼ 30
seconds long. The last eight samples are coadded and bit-shifted to a 16-bit value within the
FPE before being sent along to the ISIM; the ﬁrst two samples are discarded. This mode allows
the potential of reducing the power dissipation of the detectors quite a bit if it is found to be
necessary for stability concerns.
MIRI’s arrays have the ability to read out partial frames, or subarrays, through the manipulation of
the clocking patterns. This facilitates target acquisition imaging and selective use of the four corona-
graph masks, and allows a reduction in the frame time and integration times of < 3 seconds. Subarray
modes are only useful for the MIRI Imager. The subarrays are shown in the bottom left panel of
Fig. 10.14. Four 256× 256 subarrays are deﬁned The four subarrays that match the coronagraphic lo-
cations are deﬁned by the MIRI Imager optics and are approximately 256×256 in size. The 512×512
quadrant subarray’s position is determined by the user. Subarrays can be deﬁned in any part of the
imaging area, with a minimum size of 64 × 64 pixels. In order to ensure consistent calibration of
subarray modes, only a few subarrays will be allowed and the user will select from these predeﬁned
10.3.6 Observation modes: operating MIRI
The basic principles underlying the operation of the MIRI focal plane system (FPS) are as follows:
• the FPS enables four principal types of scientiﬁc observation: imaging, coronagraphic imaging,
low-resolution slit spectroscopy, and medium resolution integral ﬁeld spectroscopy.
• all MIRI data are sent to the ISIM Focal Plane Array Processor cards for further processing.
There is no processing within the FPS, and on-orbit processing of the data is limited to frame
coaddition in some high data rate circumstances.

means JWST is faster. Both Y -axis are the same.

• Data are taken in a redundant fashion. Sources will be dithered on the focal plane with the Fine
Steering Mirror so that each point on the sky is sampled by many different areas of the sen-
sor chip assembly (SCA). For the medium resolution Spectrometer (MRS), this accomplishes
spectral as well as spatial dithering.
• Calibration of MIRI will be done periodically to monitor its stability and performance, as well
as diagnostic tests and maintenance.
10.3.7 MIRI’s sensitivity
All the sensitivities of the broad-band imager, the low-resolution spectrometer, and the medium-
resolution IFU spectrometer are gathered in tables 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6, respectively. These ﬁgures
are particularly helpful to prepare observation proposals (see chapter 12). The results are from mod-
eling (Swinyard et al., 2004) that takes into account the different factors affecting the sensitivity: the
background ﬂux from the telescope and surrounding structure, from the instrument optics and struc-
ture, and from the zodiacal light, the cosmic ray hitting rate, the detector characteristics, the optical

background at wavelengths below ∼ 12 µm and by the emission from the telescope and sunshields at

noise limited, except in the longest wavelength channel where the background is highest.
In the left panel of Fig. 10.15 we compare the sensitivity of the MIRI Medium Resolution Spec-
trometer to other facilities. In particular, up to ∼ 20 µm, the MRS will be about two orders of mag-

times higher. The right panel of Fig. 10.15 summarizes the relative time gain between JWST instru-
ments and Spitzer, or an hypothetical 30 m ground-based telescope. Such a gain in sensitivity will

Abstract
This chapter presents my contribution to the testing of the Mid Infra Red Instrument (MIRI), part
of the scientiﬁc payload that will be integrated onto the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
The ﬁrst tests at cryogenic temperatures and infrared wavelengths were performed on the Flight
Model (FM) of the Mid-InfraRed IMager (MIRIM), from December 2008 to April 2009 at CEA,
France. My work is focused on the “microscanning” test, which allows us to characterize the
MIRIM optical quality with an unprecedent accuracy. I describe the instrumental test setup and
discuss the results of the microscanning analysis that allows to obtain a “high-resolution” Point
Spreag Function of the instrument. This analysis is of particular importance, not only for the
optical quality check and the MIRI calibration, but also for potential scientiﬁc applications.

11. First results from JWST/MIRI testing
11.1 Introduction
Ground tests are essential to ensure the functionality and the optical performance of the instrument.
They often lead to design changes from the ﬁrst models built to the ﬁnal ﬂight model (FM). The
characterization of the instrument (stray light, point spread function, ﬂat ﬁeld, etc.) has to be as
accurate as possible during ground test campaigns since these tests are extremely limited in space.
In this chapter I present my contribution to the extensive test campaign of the MIRI imager
(MIRIM, see chap. 10 for a description of the instrument). The ﬁrst MIRIM optical performance
tests in the infrared, at cryogenic temperatures, were performed at CEA, Saclay, during the December
2008 − April 2009 test campaign. I had the chance to participate in these tests, and I took the respon-
sability of the analysis of one of these tests, so-called microscanning, which allows to characterize
the Point Spread Function1 (hereafter PSF) of the instrument very accurately. This was a great expe-
rience, and I had the opportunity to interact with engineers, and to attend meetings of the European
Consortium, in which I had several opportunities to present my work.
It would be impossible to review all the tests and results that were performed on MIRIM. I will
rather focus on the PSF analysis. After introducing some generalities about the PSF of the JWST and
the context of MIRI testing, I describe in sect. 11.2 the instrumental setup used to simulate the JWST
beam and to perform the cold tests. Section 11.3 presents a very brief overview of the tests performed
on MIRIM at CEA, Saclay. In sect 11.4, we discuss the response curve of the detector and how we
correct the images for the non-linearity of the detector. Then, Sect. 11.5 describes the microscanning
test and the method used to reconstruct the high-resolution PSF of MIRIM. Sect. 11.6 discusses the
PSF characteristics determined by the microscan analysis. Sect. 11.7 summarizes our results and in
sect. 11.8 I brieﬂy give the next steps of MIRI/JWST testing.
Introduction to the PSF of the JWST
From a basic point of of view, the PSF of an imaging system is determined by two things: the pupil
shape and the WaveFront Errors (henceforth WFE). Often, the shape of the pupil is well known and
relatively simple. For instance, in the case of a circular or annular aperture, the PSF is an Airy disk
(the square of a Bessel function). However, for more sophisticated and larger systems, like the JWST
or the Keck telescope, pupils are intrinsically a lot more complex. In Fig. 11.1, we illustrate how the
pupil shape affects the PSF, building from an open circular pupil of diameter 6.5 m (left), a hexagonal
pupil of diameter 6.5 m (center), and a realistic representation of the JWST pupil (right). These PSF
have been computed with the JWPSF software described in Cox and Spaans (2006).
Why is it important to characterize the PSF with precision?
The PSF translates the optical quality of the system. A careful measurement of the PSF characteristics
is ﬁrst needed to check the optical performance of the instrument, in order to verify that the instrument
is nominally built. This is the main goal of the tests described in this chapter. A precise knowledge of
1The Point Spread Function is the image of a point source through the instrument. The PSF characterizes the imaging
system’s spatial response, i.e. its spatial resolution. In technical words, this is the impulse-response of the optical system.
11.1. Introduction
Figure 11.1: The PSF corresponding to each aperture is displayed on a logarithmic grayscale from
10−7 to 10−3 counts. The total number of counts in each of these simulated PSFs is 1. These PSF
have been modeled with the JWPSF softwarea.
ahttp://www.stsci.edu/jwst/software/jwpsf
the PSF is also crucial for the photometric calibration of the instrument and for scientiﬁc applications
(photometry, source extraction, etc.).
Before determining if the PSF of the instrument is nominal or not, an important step is to study
the impact of aberrations on the PSF. Errors in the wavefront can arise from a variety of sources,
including imperfections in the system’s optics or atmospheric variations in the case for ground-based
observations. These WFE can be extremely difﬁcult to determine. The Fig. 11.2 illustrates the impact
of variations of the WFE on the PSF at 2 µm with the NirCam instrument (see sect. 10.2.5 for a
description of the instrument). Two realizations of the WFE and corresponding JWST PSFs are shown.
These PSFs differ in the speciﬁc distribution of the wavefront error across the pupil. As long as the
error budget is satisﬁed, comparing these PSFs provides an estimate of the PSF differences that could
be encountered in the normal course of observations.
A long path to the FM, and a European adventure!
To design and build an instrument like MIRI is a hard and long route! The development and qualiﬁca-
tion of the optical bench of the MIRI imager (MIRIM) started in 2004, and the ﬁrst tests of the MIRIM
ﬂight model (henceforth FM) started in December 2008. Some hardware parts of the MIRI FM are
still being, and will be, manufactured and tested in 2009-2010. MIRI is expected to be delivered to

associated PSFs (bottom) for a wavelength of 2 µm. OPDs are displayed on a linear grayscale from
−400 to 400 nm, while PSFs are displayed on a logarithmic grayscale from 10−6 to 10−3. The OPDs

Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam). The RMS
WFE of both OPDs is ≈ 110 nm. While the differences in total RMS WFE are small, the impact of
these differences on the resultant PSFs is measurable. These PSF have been modeled with the JWPSF
software.
NASA at the end of 2010. Then MIRI will be integrated into the Instrument Science Module, at the
back of the JWST primary mirror (see chapter 10), and basic testing (alignment, focus, etc.) will be
performed in the giant cryogenic chamber at Johnson Space Center, Houston, USA (see 11.8).
11.2. Instrumental setup: the MIRIM test bench at CEA
Figure 11.3: Photos of the test bench for testing of MIRIM at CEA, Saclay. The telescope simulator
(TS) is lying next to the cryostat where MIRIM is installed. The IR blackbody source is mounted on
an hexapod that allows ﬁne motion scanning in the object plane of the TS.
Before the FM, several models of MIRI were built. A ﬁrst mechanical model (the Structure and
Thermal Model, STM) was to test thermal balance, integration and vibration at MIRI level. The ﬁrst
optical model was the Veriﬁcation model (VM), and it was used to test the integration procedures
and the optical performance. Then, the Engineering and Test Model (ETM) was an optically fully
representative model, used to verify the optical performance and thermal behaviour of the instrument
at cryogenic temperatures at CEA. The different steps leading to the FM integration of the Mid-
Infra Red IMager Optical Bench (MIRIM-OB), and the principal results associated with the two test
models, the STM and the ETM, were presented in Amiaux et al. (2008). In this chapter, I will focus
on the FM.
The different parts of the MIRIM-OB system are built within the different institutes of the Eu-
ropean Consortium, then gathered together and integrated at CEA-Saclay. The ﬁlters are under the
responsibility of University of Sweden. The Double Prism Assembly for the Low-Resolution Spec-
trometer (LRS, see § 10.3.3) is a Belgium (CSL) and a Germany (University of Köln) collaboration.
The coronographic masks are manufactured at Observatoire de Meudon (LESIA) in France. Optical
elements are then integrated onto the Filter Wheel Disk under CEA responsibility (see § 10.3.2 for
a description of the ﬁlter wheel and its ﬁlters). The Filter Wheel Disk is delivered to MPIA in Ger-
many for integration on the Filter Wheel cryo-mechanism. Filter Wheel Assembly is then returned to
CEA-Saclay for further integration into MIRIM Optical Bench.

ulator (TS). The warm TS is installed outside the cryostat (in blue on the right panel) that contains
MIRIM. The TS simulates the JWST beam and pupil. It allows the use of a point or extended source,
in order to characterize MIRIM in image or coronographic mode.
11.2 Instrumental setup: the MIRIM test bench at CEA
The tests of the MIRIM optical quality have been performed with an ambient temperature Tele-
scope Simulator (hereafter TS), installed outside an helium-cooled cryostat that contains MIRIM-OB
(Fig. 11.3). The TS simulates the optical beam delivered by the JWST. The optical conception of the
TS is based on two off-axis parabolic mirrors (PM1 and PM2) and a pupil mask in between (Fig. 11.4).
The pupil mask is the pupil of the telescope simulator (so-called the “STOP”) and it reproduces the
pupil of JWST. It is mounted on motorised translation and rotation stages (4 axis: 3 translations and
one rotation). This allows ﬁne adjustment to co-align the telescope simulator and MIRIM pupils.
These degrees of freedom are also used to simulate pupil shear, which occurs when the pupil stop is
mis-aligned with the telescope pupil image.
The telescope simulator was mainly designed by Yuying Longval at IAS, and installed at CEA,
Saclay. The ﬁeld of view of the TS is 80 mm× 80 mm for a MIRIM ﬁeld of view of 72 mm× 72 mm.
An analysis of the image quality2 shows that the distortion amounts to 0.33% for the useful ﬁeld. The
aperture is F/20 in the image plane. The exit pupil location is 3017.5 mm from the image plane for
a diameter of 151.6 mm. The pupil is 75.4 mm in diameter. To implement the MIRIM cryostat in a
minimum space, folding mirrors are used.
An IR point source with a shutter is mounted on a remotely controlled hexapod, that can be moved
in 3 directions (X, Y and Z). The minimum diameter of the point source is 30 µm, and the temperature
of the source is 1150 K for the imaging mode, or 2000 K for the coronographic mode. An extended
black body source (400 K) can also be used. The 10K screen in the cryostat is ﬁtted with a neutral

density (ND) that reduces the ﬂux due to the 295K background. All the tests were performed when
the instrument is cold. During each of the tests, the temperature of the instrument must be between
5 and 7K and stable at ±250 mK. The detector temperature is 6.7K and is stable at ±10 mK. For a
more detailed description of the test bench, see Amiaux et al. (2008).
At the time of the FM test campaign, the ﬁlter wheel assembly was not available because of
vibration testing, and only one ﬁlter (5.6 µm) was available. The ﬁlter wheel was replaced by a “mono-
ﬁlter wheel” (often called a “cyclop tool”). Since there was no dark position available, a chopper has
been used. The different types of images produced are listed in Table 11.1. A measurement cycle
consists in two sub-cycles (shutter closed, shutter open). The exposition time, or the total duration of
a measurement, Texp, (i.e. total time to get one INT image) is calculated as follows:
Texp = Ncycles × Tcycle ,
where Tcycle is the duration of a cycle. We have Ncycles = N/NDIT, where N is the total number of
DIT images (see Table 11.1 for deﬁnition) required to achieve a given signal ratio and NDIT is the
number of DIT images per half cycle. The duration of a cycle is given by
Tcycle = 2 × (NDITSKIP + NDIT) × DIT = 1/fCHOP ,
where NDITSKIP is the number of images to skip at the beginning of the cycle (delay for the shutter
to close), DIT the detector integration time, and fCHOP the chopping frequency. The factor of 2 is
because there are two half-cycles per cycle: shutter close and shutter open.
11.3 Overview of the MIRIM optical performance tests
The ﬁrst tests in the infrared, at cryogenic temperatures, were performed on the ETM at CEA, between
February and April 2008. An overview of the optical performance tests is presented in the ﬂowchart of
Fig. 11.5. The ETM model is fully representative in terms of optical path, but not in terms of alignment
of the optical path. Indeed, the ETM FWA is a proto-type without requirements on alignment. Below
is a brief description of these tests. Similar tests have been performed on the Flight Model (Dec.
2008−April 2009).

Distortion grid at ambient and cold temperatures:
a grid of 87× 87 pinholes (5 µm in diameter),
with a regular pitch, is mounted at the entrance focal plane, illuminated by an optical LED, and imaged
with a 2048× 2048 CCD chip. This setup allows to measure the magniﬁcation and the distorsion over
the whole ﬁeld of view in one image, at ambient temperature (∼ 300 K). Shims3 are used to simulate
a possible telescope defocus. The CCD camera tool is equipped with a micrometric translation stage
along the optical axis, which allows to explore and to search the best focus position. This test is also
performed at cryogenic temperatures and with infrared light, which allows to assess image quality and
perform ﬂat ﬁeld measurements.
Alignment check at ambient and cold: The alignment consists in pointing the coronagraphic di-
aphragms with an alignment telescope that is coaligned with MIRIM optical axis. A correction is
applied by shimming the M1 in order to minimize the shift between the optical axis and the centre of
the diaphragms. This test has been performed at ambient and croygenic temperatures.

11.4 Data reduction
11.4.1 Basic reduction steps
For the microscanning, the shutter is used in chopping mode (see sect. 11.2). A total of 8 DIT
frames is taken for each cycle (open−close shutter). A 72 × 64 sub-array is read out, with a detector
integration time DIT = 0.827 s. Thus, according to Eq. 11.2, the duration of a cycle is Tcycle =
13.23 s. For each cycle that is beginning, the ﬁrst frame is skipped because during this frame the
shutter is closing. Then, the following 3 DIT frames are skipped because of latency effects on the
detector since the point source is very bright. Therefore, we use the last 4 frames of the cycle. Each
exposure comprises 10 cycles, so the exposure time is Texp = 132.3 s. A median image is created
from these 10 cycles.
11.4.2 Linearity correction for the response of the detector
JPL and CEA performed tests of the response of the detector and it appears that the detector is non
linear over a wide range of ADU values. To quantify the impact of the non-linear response curve on
the PSF measurements, S. Ronayette and myself provide two sets of test data: one that is not corrected
for the detector response, and the other which is corrected for the non-linearity. I have performed the
PSF analysis on the two data sets to compare the results.
The MIRIM detector is a 1024 × 1024 pixels SiAs array. JPL has delivered a Raytheon SB305
detector to CEA. The detector conﬁguration will be a Sensor Chip Assembly (SCA), i.e. an ultra-light
mechanical & electrical housing. CEA has developed an appropriate housing (similar to the MIRI
focal plane) to mount the IR detector onto the imager for the cold tests. Thus, qualitative analysis of
the optical properties, including stray light performances, are possible.
Fig. 11.6 presents the detector response. Measurements have been done by V. Moreau at CEA on
the SB305 detector at 5 K, with an extended blackbody source in front of the detector. The source is
at constant temperature (30 K) and the integration time is the only parameter that changes. The longer
the integration time, the higher the signal in units of ADU. The 30 K blackbody source does not
allow us to explore the linear part of the response curve, at low ADU values, since with the smallest
integration time (2.7 s, see chapter 10, sect. 10.3.5), we reach a signal of 26 360 ADU (see Fig. 11.6).
11. First results from JWST/MIRI testing
Figure 11.6: The response curve of the MIRI SB305 detector obtained at CEA. Measurements have
been done at 5 K. The back curve show the average read ADU values of the pixels in the center of the
ﬁeld as a function of the corrected values (see text for details). The red curve indicates an exponential
ﬁt (see § 11.4.2, Eq. 11.4).
Fine measurements a low integrated ﬂuxes were performed with colder black body sources (not
shown here). An accurate sampling of the response curve at low ADU values shows that the response
is linear for ADU values lower than ≈ 16 000 (V. Moreau, private communication) and follows the
Slin = α × tint + β ,
where Slin is the signal in ADU in the linear part of the response, α = 3067 ADU s−1 is the slope of
the linear response and β = 18030 ADU the offset.
The low background signal (18 030 ADU on Fig. 11.6) is measured more accurately with colder
black body sources. It allows to do a ﬁne sampling of the beginning of the response curve, at low
levels, where the response is approximately linear. Fig. 11.6 shows the read value as a function of the
corrected value. To estimate the corrected value, the difference between the linear response (linear
ﬁt done at low signal given by Eq. 11.3) and the read value is calculated. To perform the linearity

correction, I have ﬁtted the response curve by an exponential function:
Sread = A − B e
−Scor/C ,
where Sread is the read signal in ADU and Scor the corrected one. I found A = 56 418.5, B =
62 939.1 and C = 35 990.5 ADU. The red line on Fig. 11.6 shows the result of the ﬁt.
To apply the linearity correction, we derive Scor from Sread and correct all the individual images.
Fig. 11.7 compares the PSF proﬁles when the linearity correction is applied or not. The correction
enhances the highest values of the signal, so it improves the sharpness of the PSFs.
11.5 The micro-scanning test
In this section we ﬁrst describe the goals, principle and experimental method to perform the mi-
croscanning. Then, results are discussed. This test, together with ﬁeld of view measurements, led
to the discovery of a defect in the instrument after the ﬁrst FM1 test campaign. This defect was a
tilt of the M4 mirror (see Fig. 10.10 for the position of this mirror in the optical layout of the instru-
ment). This anomaly was corrected and a second test campaign was performed (FM2). We show the
differences in the optical quality of the instrument, before and after correction for the two FM test
campaigns (FM1 and FM2).
11. First results from JWST/MIRI testing
Figure 11.8: Pattern of the microscan. A 11×11 points scanning grid has been performed, correspond-
ing to a total scanning area of 1 pixel on the detector plane. The source has been moved by steps of
7 µm on the hexapod mount of the telescope simulator. This corresponds to individual displacements
of 2.5 µm on the detector plane.
11.5.1 Aims and experimental method
Since the physical size4 of the pixels is 25 µm, the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the instrument
is not Nyquist-sampled at a wavelength of 5.6 µm (the theoretical FWHM of the PSF at 5.6 µm is
0.185”, i.e. is less than 2 pixels), which is the shortest wavelength for MIRI, and the most critical
for the assessment of the optical quality. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to check the optical quality of the
instrument at this wavelength with a single point source image.
The goal of the microscanning test is to obtain a “high-resolution” (HR) image of the PSF from
multiple “low-resolution” (LR) raw images. In other words, the microscanning aims at providing
a highly-sampled image of the PSF. Such a resolution enhancement approach has been an active
research area, in particular in image or video processing, and it is sometimes called over-resolution
image reconstruction, or simply resolution enhancement. Here, the HR PSFs are used to perform an
accurate measurement of the MIRIM image quality.
The basis of the inversion method used to analyse the microscanning data has been developed to
perform high spectral and spatial resolution spectroscopy with Spitzer telescope InfraRed Spectrome-
ter (IRS) data (Rodet et al., 2009). This work relies on a fruitful collaboration between the LSS5 and
the IAS institutes in Orsay. With the help of T. Rodet (LSS), I have applied Matlab algorithms of data
inversion to process the microscanning data, and analyse the results with standard tools (IRAF, IDL).

11.5. The micro-scanning test
Figure 11.9: Sketch of the direct problem of generation of images. This ﬁgure links the high-resolution
optical PSF x to the low-resolution ones yk that we observe.
The microscanning test is performed at cryogenic temperatures and at a wavelength of 5.6 µm. No
other ﬁlter was available at that time because the ﬁlter wheel was not delivered to CEA. The method
consists in scanning a point source in a ﬁne spatial resolution. The microscan pattern is given in
Fig. 11.8. A 11 × 11 points grid has been done, corresponding to a total scanning area of 1 MIRIM
pixel on the detector plane, i.e. an area of 102 pixels2. The source has been moved by steps of 7 µm on
the hexapod mount. This corresponds to individual displacements of 2.5 µm on the detector plane. In
the following sub-sections the method we apply to reconstruct the high-resolution images is detailed.
11.5.2 Direct and inverse problem
The total point spread function P SFtot of an imaging system consists of several components. Firstly,
the light is diffracted within the optics. This part will be denoted P SFopt. For instance, P SFopt is
an Airy disk in case of a circular aperture. Once the light has passed through the optical elements
(mirrors, ﬁlters, gratings, etc.), the signal is integrated on the sensor (array) composed of squared
detectors (pixels). Because the area of a pixel is not inﬁnitely small, this causes blurring (P SFdet)
which can be modeled by a uniform square function if the spatial response of a pixel is ﬂat over its
entire area. The total PSF can be computed by convolution of its different parts6:
P SFtot = P SFopt (cid:63) P SFdet
The process of generation of the images is schematically shown on Fig. 11.9. We denote x the high-
resolution (HR) optical PSF. The aim of the deconvolution method is to deduce x from multiple
low-resolution images yk (the observed data).
Let us describe the direct problem by assuming that we start from the high-resolution image x.
The high-resolution optical PSF x that we want to estimate is ﬁrst translated because of the motions of
the source. Then, the observed and translated images yk are the result of the convolution by the PSF
of the detector, P SFdet. In the schematic Fig. 11.9, we separate the integration of the detector in two
6There are additional parts that contribute to the ﬁnal PSF that we do not consider here. For instance, motion of the
sensor platform causes blurring. In addition the electronic components cause smoothing by applying a low-pass ﬁlter to
reduce noise.

Figure 11.10: Sketch of the different steps to reconstruct the high-resolution image (inverse problem).
steps: (1) a convolution by the PSF of an over-sampled (ﬁne grid) detector (a detector that would have
smaller pixels than the real detector of the instrument), and (2) a down-sampling operation needed
to degrade the resolution of the ﬁne detector to the real, low-resolution of the obervations. The ratio
between the pixel size on the ﬁne grid and the physical size on the real detector is named over-sampling
factor, f, which represents the gain in resolution.
We formalize these operations by matrix multiplications. We deﬁne three matrices, Tk, R et
S, which are associated with the operations of translation, convolution by the impulse-response of a
pixel, and down-sampling, respectively. Thus, the direct problem can be summarized as
yk = SRTkx + nk
with k ∈ {1, . . . , N}. N is the total number of images taken at different positions on the detector. n
is the noise, whose level is assumed to be commesurate for all the images. Note that in Eq. 11.6, the
only operation that is different from an image to another is the translation Tk.
To obtain high values of the over-sampling factor (gain in resolution), one needs to know very
precisely the translations between images. Unfortunately, this is not the case for our experimental
setup. Although the hexapod (where the point source is mounted) is designed to allow ﬁne mo-
tions of the source, we note signiﬁcant mismatches between the expected position and the effective
observed location of the source. Therefore we decided to estimate the relative positions between im-
ages by a technique which is independant of the mechanical control of the hexapod. We perform
cross-correlation calculations between a reference images and the other translated images in order to
estimate the shifts between images. This is the ﬁrst step of our inversion problem.
Fig. 11.10 shows a sketch of the inverse problem. To reconstruct a high-resolution image from N
low-resolution ones, we proceed in three steps:
1. we ﬁrst estimate the translation between the low-resolution (LR) images by cross correlation
(see sect. 11.5.3 for details).
2. then, we co-add the LR images on a ﬁne grid, assuming that there is no convolution by the PSF
of the detector.

3. ﬁnally, we solve the deconvolution problem.
This algorithm is a simpliﬁed version of a more complex algorithm developped by Rodet et al. (2009).
11.5.3 Estimate of the translations between images and co-addition
Although the translation between the point source images is mechanically controlled, we note that the
effective position of the source is slightly different from the expected position. Therefore, we compute
the shifts between a reference image and the current translated image, and we compare the result to
the expected position that the hexapod should have given.
We estimate the relative motions between the images with a cross-correlation technique. To de-
termine sub-pixel translations between images, we perform a bilinear interpolation on an HR grid at
a resolution equal to three times the over-sampling factor (3 × f). We deﬁne the ﬁrst image as the
the reference image Iref and we search, in an exhaustive manner, the displacement that maximizes
the cross-correlation factor, Cor, between the reference image and the current translated one, I. The
cross-correlation is computed as:
(cid:88)
(cid:88)
σIref σI
Cor(I, Iref ) =
(Ii, j − (cid:104)I(cid:105)) (Iref, i, j − (cid:104)Iref(cid:105))
In Eq. 11.7, σIref and σI are the standard deviations of the matrices Iref and I, respectively. (cid:104)Iref(cid:105)
and (cid:104)I(cid:105) are the averages of Iref and I, respectively.
Then, these motions are compared with the expected values measured with the hexapod. A sub-
pixel precision is obtained. Fig. 11.11 shows an example of the comparison between the read position
of the hexapod (expected position in blue) and the position estimated by cross-correlation (in red).
The agreement between expected and estimated positions for the displacement in the X-direction is
very good. However, a slight discrepancy is seen for the Y -direction. The hexapod did not move at the
expected positions in this direction. This issue is likely to be due to the control system of the hexapod
support, which is not optimally designed to perform translations along the X and Y axis.
The mismatch between estimated and expected relative motions between images introduces errors
in the reconstruction method if one uses the expected positions. Therefore, the estimated motions are
used to reconstruct the high resolution image. We also compare the results if one uses the expected
motions.
Assuming that the translations Tk are known, we co-add low-resolution images yk onto an over-
resolved image (ﬁne grid). We choose the over-sampling factor f such that 7 (cid:54) f (cid:54) 10. Thus, a HR
image z is created but it is still blurred because of the response of the detector. The slight discrepancy
between expected and estimated positions Tk represents a lack of information, in particular in the
Y -direction. Some pixels of the HR image z are not present in the data yk.
11.5.4 Deconvolution
We denote z the LR image that have been over-sampled on a ﬁne grid. This image is still “blurred”,
but its number of pixels is a factor f 2 higher than the observed LR image. z is the convolution of the
HR image x that we want to calculate by the impulse-response (PSF) of the detector:
z = Rx + n
11. First results from JWST/MIRI testing
Figure 11.11: Expected vs. Estimated displacements of the source in the X and Y directions during
the microscanning. A slight discrepancy is seen between the estimated moves on the image and the
expected position of the source for the Y -direction because, in practice, to control the absolute position
of the hexapod is difﬁcult. For the X-direction, the agreement is excellent.
Figure 11.12: PSF data co-added on a ﬁne grid for an over-sampling factor of 11. The white pixels
show the truncation of the data (lack of information). The left panel shows the co-added image when
the expected shifts between images are used. Since the microscan comprises 10 shifts, the truncation
of the data is a cross-hatching with 11 pixels between each white line. On the right panel, the effective
shifts estimated by cross-correlation are used. Additional truncation can be seen, due to the mismatch
of the expected and effective translations between images (see text for details).
One cannot apply the classical methods of deconvolution because part of the data is not observed (due
to uncertainties on the translations, see sect. 11.5.3). Indeed, there are missing parts, “holes”, in the

data because the source is not exactly at its expected position on the ﬁne grid image. The Fig. 11.12
shows the PSF data co-added onto a ﬁne grid with an over-sampling factor of 11. We illustrate the
truncation of the data by comparing the results of the co-addition when using the expected positions
of the source, to the results when using the shifts estimated by cross-correlation. The additional
truncation for the effective translations comes from the mismatch between expected and real position
of the source.
We take into account the truncation of the data by introducing a matrix T in Eq. B.1:
z = T Rx + n = Hx + n
T is a mask with pixels value of 1 where the data exists, and 0 otherwise. The operator H = T R
returns the measurements z from the HR image x.
To solve the deconvolution problem, a Bayesian formalism is used. In practice, the deconvolution
consists of minimizing a least-square criterion. The formalism and the method used to solve the
deconvolution problem and estimate x is detailed in Appendix B.
11.6 Results
We ﬁrst describe the results of the ﬁrst test campaign of the Flight Model (FM1), and show that the
PSF characteristics of the intrument were out of speciﬁcations. After correction of the defect exhibited
with these tests, we compare the results between the FM1 and FM2 test campaigns.
11.6.1 Analysis of the MIRIM PSF
The analysis of the 5.6 µm images taken during the microscanning test was done with IDL routines.
The results have been compared and complemented with the use of the IRAF software. Different
measurements of the FWHM of the PSFs have been performed (Gauss, Bessel and moffat ﬁts, radial
proﬁles, etc). I have written a technical document for the MIRI European Consortium (EC) about
the focus and FOV exploration with a point source tests was written (document MIRI-TN-00743-
IAS). In this document (not reproduced here), the techniques used to measure the FWHM of the PSF
are detailed. Here we rather focus on the main results of the microscanning test. These results are
gathered in an other EC document (see Appendix C, sect. C.3 for a list of these documents) and I have
written a SPIE paper that will be submitted for the next SPIE conference “Observational Frontiers of
Astronomy for the New Decade” in June 2010.
Fig. 11.14 shows an example of reconstructed HR PSF. The linearity correction is applied and the

is exhibited on the HR images, as well as the shape of the lobes. The radial proﬁle of the HR PSF is

Different high-resolution PSF images and all the quantitative results for the FM1 tests are gathered
in Table 11.2. The results are shown for images that have been corrected for the detector response
(linearity correction). These images correspond to over-sampling factors equal to 7, 10 and 11. The
ﬁrst value corresponds to a reasonable compromise between the gain in resolution and the introduction

of artefacts in the reconstructed images. The last one (11) is chosen to show the limits of the method.
In this case, the pixel size (2.3 µm) is smaller than the microscanning step (2.5 µm). For an over-
sampling factor of 7 (resp. 11), one original MIRIM pixel equals to 72 (resp. 112) pixels in the
super-resolution image. The pixel sizes in the HR images are ∼ 3.6 µm and ∼ 2.3 µm, respectively.
Table 11.2 also shows the results of the simulations of MIRIM PSFs with Zemax. These sim-
ulations are done at two resolutions, the standard one (25 µm / pixel) and a ﬁne, re-sampled one
(3.125 µm / pixel) which allows the comparison with the HR reconstructed PSFs.
The correction for the response of the detector decreases the width of the computed MIRIM PSFs.
The reason is that the deviation to the linearity is greater at high ﬂuxes than that at low values (see
Fig. 11.6 and 11.7). The FWHM of the corrected PSFs are ∼ 5 % lower than the raw ones. The X, Y ,
or radial proﬁles of the SR PSFs are well ﬁtted by an Airy disk (Fig. 11.14). The measured FWHM

ﬁts to the core of the PSF give slightly lower values (∼ 44 − 47 µm).
HR PSF proﬁles in the X- and Y - directions are shown on Fig. 11.15, 11.16 and 11.17. For
comparison, the PSF proﬁles of one low-resolution image (one single position MIRIM image) is
plotted for the corresponding number of pixels. Airy and Gaussian ﬁts have been performed in the
X- and Y - directions. We show on Fig. 11.15 and 11.16 the results of the Airy ﬁts on the data and
the Zemax simulations. The better sampling of the PSF helps in reconstructing more accurately the
main peak of the PSF. The secondary diffraction lobes are also resolved. We note that the positions
and amplitudes of the secondary lobes do not match exactly with the Airy ﬁts.
For an over-sampling factor of 11, we reach the limit of the method, and one can see artefacts on
the reconstructed image (in both X- and Y - directions, see Table 11.2). They may be due to errors
in the motions estimations, signal-to-noise limitations, and simpliﬁcations made in the model of the
detector and of the pixels (uniform response, etc.). For an over-sampling factor of 7, most of the
artefacts are removed in the X- directions. The remaining artefacts in the Y -direction are due to the
errors in the motion estimation (see Fig. 11.11). The Y - direction proﬁle exhibit a slight distorsion of
the shape of the main peak (Fig. 11.17).

Conclusion of the FM1 tests: a defect in the instrument
From the results gathered in Table 11.2, we note that the FWHM of the HR PSFs are systematically
larger than the measured FWHM on the HR simulated Zemax PSF. The discrepancy is about +8 µm
after correction for the non-linearity of the detector. This mismatch is out of the speciﬁcations of the
instrument. This out-of-speciﬁcation issue was also revealed independently by an another test. The
measurement of the MIRIM ﬁeld of view shows a vignetting issue, which seems to conﬁrm that a
defect is present in the instrument. The left panel of Fig. 11.18 shows the ﬁeld of view of the imager
during the FM1 test campaign. Note that the bottom of the FoV is lost.
Motivated by these tests, a new metrology analysis of the instrument was done by engineers from
the CEA, Saclay and IAS, Orsay. The engineers from the IAS provided a “Faro arm”, a special tool to
perfom the metrology. It was ﬁrst thought that the root cause of the out-of-speciﬁcation optical quality
of the instrument was due to a misalignment of the detector. It turned out that this was not the case.
In-depth investigations concluded to a slight interference between the structure of the Three-Mirror-
Anastigmatic (TMA) objective and the M4 mirror (see Fig. 10.10 and sect. 10.3.2 for a description
of the optical layout of MIRIM). This design problem caused a tilt of the M4 mirror with respect to
its nominal positioning. The M4 mirror has been found damaged, with some bending of its mounting
ﬂexible pad. This tilt results in a degradation of the nominal PSF properties and the FoV area.

dashed lines are the results of the Airy ﬁts.
The cause of the interference between the TMA structure and the M4 mirror has been removed
manually. The damaged M4 mirror was replaced by the Flight Spare model. A second test campaign
(FM2) was launched, and we performed the same microscanning analysis to check the optical quality
of the PSF. This story illustrates well the need to perform accurate tests on the ground! Indeed, the
discrepancy on the PSF characteristics could not have been exhibited without the deconvolution of
high-resolution images from the microscanning data.
11.6.2 Results of the FM2 tests after correction of the M4 tilt
Comparison between FM1 and FM2 tests
The results of the microscanning analysis and PSF measurements for the FM2 test campaign are
gathered in Table 11.3. Gaussian ﬁts to the PSFs show that the FWHM are of the order of 44 µm
(0.19 arcsec) at 5.6 µm, which brings this value inside the speciﬁcation range7. The effect of the cor-
rection of the tilf of the M4 mirror is clearly visible on the HR reconstructed PSFs. Note that this effect
is not measurable of the raw (LR) images, which emphasizes the importance of this microscanning
test and analysis.
7The speciﬁcation on the PSF is not expressed in terms of FWHM, but in terms of wavefront errors (WFE). A zemax
calculation, performed by S. Ronayette (CEA), was used to translate the WFE into FWHL tolerances.

Encircled energy of a point source image
The encircled energy is another way of estimating the optical quality of the PSF. The requirements for
MIRI are the following. The MIRI imager data shall include more than 56 % of the encircled energy
of the image of a point source at wavelengths longward of 5.6 µm within the angular diameter of the
ﬁrst dark Airy ring. Note that in the MIRI requirement document, the encircled energy is deﬁned
relative to the energy within a radius of 5 arcsec equivalent projected onto the sky.

so we have normalized the encircled energy to a 2 arcsec radius. Therefore it is difﬁcult to relate our
results to the speciﬁcation requirements at 5 arcsec.

(no black stripe anymore). Note that for the FM2 tests, the coronograph masks are not mounted.

the two curse is very good, suggesting that the instrument is close to its nominal behaviour. The
diameter of the ﬁrst dark ring can be interpreted as the ﬁrst point of inﬂection in E(r), i.e the value of
r for which d2E/dr2 = 0. We ﬁnd an encircled energy of 73 % inside the central lobe.
Note that the measured variation of encircled energy with radial distance from a point image is
very sensitive to the ﬂux levels at large radial distances. One must ensure that dE/dr (cid:62) 0 for all
values of r for the measurement to make sense. Here, this condition is satisﬁed because we work at
high background values. The telescope simulator is at ambient temperatures, thus producing a high
thermal background.
11.7 Summary and conclusions
This chapter reports the ﬁrst detailed analysis of the characteristics of the Point Spread Function (PSF)
of the Flight Model of the JWST Mid-InfraRed IMager (MIRIM). The data are taken at 5.6 µm, the
only ﬁlter available at that time. We discuss the results of the “microscanning” test that has been
performed at cryogenic temperatures in December 2008 - March 2009 at CEA, Saclay. This high-
resolution (HR) technique is used to characterize the MIRIM optical quality. The microscanning
consists in a ﬁne, sub-pixel scanning of a point source on the focal plane. A deconvolution algorithm
is used to reconstruct HR PSFs. The main results are the following.
1. The microscanning test provides a signiﬁcant improvement for the analysis of the PSF charac-
teristics. This test allows to resolve the diffraction pattern of MIRIM and to measure accurately
the width of the PSF for the FM. We conﬁrm the global shape of the PSF secondary lobes that
is seen on HR Zemax simulations.
2. The FWHM of the high-resolution, reconstructed images are ∼ 48 − 50 µm, i.e. 0.21 − 0.22 "
for the ﬁrst test campaign. We note a discrepancy of ∼ +8 µm between the data and the high-
resolution Zemax simulations. The microscanning test, together with ﬁeld of view measure-
ments, showed that a defect was present in the instrument. The main cause for the mismatch
between simulations and MIRIM data has been identiﬁed. Metrology measurements of the
MIRIM mechanical and optical layout have shown a out-of-speciﬁcation tilt of the M4 mirror.
This tilt was due to an interference between the MIRIM structure and the mirror. This manufac-
turing fault has been corrected, and a second test campaign began in February 2009. The results
show that the FWHM of the HR PSFs are 44 − 46 µm, i.e. 0.19(cid:48)(cid:48)
speciﬁcations. The FWHM are only ∼ +4 µm compared to high-resolution simulations.
− 0.20(cid:48)(cid:48), which is within the
3. Slight differences between the simulated PSF patterns and the MIRIM HR reconstructed data
are exhibited. We discuss the limits of the method due to errors in the relative positions of
the images and the lack of information (signal-to-noise limitations, assumptions made on the
characteristics of the detector, etc.).
4. The MIRI detector shows a non-linear response curve. This result is conﬁrmed by independant
measurements by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), responsible for the detector array. We
show that the correction for the response of the detector improves the quality of the MIRIM
PSFs. The FWHM of the corrected PSFs are ∼ 5 % lower than the raw ones.

well as functional tests and basic optical performance checks will be performed.

MIRI testing is not ﬁnished! Today (end of august), the instrument is still at CEA and will be tested
with the ﬁlter wheel. MIRIM will be delivered to RAL8 for additional testing (functional and optical
performance tests with a cold telescope simulator, as opposed to the warm simulator used at CEA).
After testing of the Optical System at RAL, the Optical Bench Assembly (OBA, see sect. 10.3)
will be delivered to NASA Goddard, where the MIRI OBA will be integrated into the Integrated
Science Instrument Module (see sect. 10.3) for testing at cryogenic temperatures (see Fig. 11.20).
Then, the ISIM is mounted onto the whole telescope (Optical Telescope Element, OTE), and the 6m
telescope is tested in the giant cryo test facility at the Johnson Space Center (JSC), in Houston (see

I’ll be there!

Science with the JWST and MIRI
They spend their time mostly looking forward to the past.

Abstract
In addition to my participation to the tests of the Mid-InfraRed instrument (MIRI) onboard the
JWST, I am involved in the scientiﬁc preparation of MIRI, as a member of the European Science
Team. The MIRI instrument will be next future of mid-IR infrared observations, and a ideal tool to
look at H2 in active phases of galaxy evolution. This chapter presents a speciﬁc proposal (“white
paper”) I have submitted to the working group “Galaxy evolution between z = 0.6 − 6”, in
preparation of the guaranteed time observations. This proposal is based on our on-going program
addressing the multiphase gas physics during highly dissipative phases of galaxy evolution at low
and high redshift, which was introduced in chapter 9.

11.6 Results
12. Science with the JWST and MIRI
12.1 Overview of the JWST scientiﬁc goals
The science of the JWST is deﬁnitively oriented towards high-redshift astrophysics. If one looks at
NASA’s website, the JWST science drivers are divided into four main topics:
1. First Light (after the big bang); To ﬁnd and study the ﬁrst luminous objects; proto-galaxies,
supernova, black holes
2. Assembly of Galaxies; To study the merging of proto-galaxies, effects of black holes, history
of star formations
3. Birth of Stars and Planetary Systems; JWST will study how stars form in dust clouds, and how
chemical elements are produced and re-circulated.
4. Planetary Systems and Origin of Life; To study the formation of planets and obtain direct ob-
servations of other planetary systems, as well as study of outer solar system.
Based on these themes, several science working groups were created in January 2009, to start working
on precise proposals of observations with MIRI, in preparation of the guaranteed time projects. I
“signed up” into two of them: the working group “Galaxy evolution between z = 0.6 − 6”, led by P.
Van Der Werf and the working group “Interstellar medium” led by Alain Abergel.
With F. Boulanger and N. Nesvadba we started to work on a proposal to observe H2 luminous ob-
jects with MIRI. The next section reproduces the proposal I have written and submitted to the “Galaxy
Evolution” group. I also participated to a proposal written by Alain Abergel on the observations of
nearby PDRs to probe the gas and dust physics at the cloud/inter-cloud interface.
12.2 Tracing the kinetic energy dissipation associated with galaxy merg-
ing and AGN feedback at z ∼ 1.5 − 3.5 with MIRI
Here is the proposal I have written with F. Boulanger and N. Nesvadba and submitted to the “Galaxy
Evolution” working group.
12.2.1 Background
The build-up of baryonic mass in galaxies is regulated by a complex interplay between gravitational
collapse, galaxy merging and feedback related to AGN and star formation (Fig. 9.1). These processes
may inject sufﬁcient mechanical energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) to potentially have a major
impact on star formation and galaxy assembly. This will be particularly important during the early
phases of galaxy evolution at high redshift, when galaxies were gas-rich and most of the stars in the
universe were formed.
The molecular gas plays a critical role in this context since it represents an important, if not
dominant, cooling agent in the energetics of galaxy merging and feedback. Recent observations by the
InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope have discovered a signiﬁcant and
diverse population of low-z objects where the mid-infrared rotational line emission of H2 is strongly
enhanced (LH2 ∼ 1040 − 1043 erg s−1), while star formation is suppressed (Fig. 1.2). This suggest
12.2. H2-luminous sources with MIRI
that shocks are the primary cause of the H2 emission (Ogle et al., 2007; Guillard et al., 2009c). This
sample of H2-luminous sources includes galaxies in several key phases of their evolution, dominated
by gas accretion (Egami et al., 2006), galaxy interactions (Appleton et al., 2006), or galactic winds
driven by star formation (e.g. M82 Engelbracht et al., 2006) and AGN (Ogle et al., 2009).
Constraining the impact of merging and AGN feedback on the formation and evolution of massive
galaxies can only be addressed through direct observations at z ∼ 2, near the cosmologically most
active period of star formation, galaxy interactions and AGN activity. By analogy to our models on
local H2-luminous objects (Guillard et al., 2009c), we expect the mid-IR lines to be the dominant
cooling lines for warm, 102−3 K, gas in the strongly shocked, highly turbulent, colliding ﬂows in
galaxy interactions (e.g. the galaxy-wide shock in Stephan’s Quintet), but also, e.g., in AGN-driven
outﬂows. High gas velocity dispersions measured in z ∼ 2 actively star-forming galaxies show that
the gas kinematics in these systems was strongly disturbed compared to galaxies today (e.g. Lehnert
et al., 2009). We expect the molecular gas to be highly turbulent and therefore the warm H2 emission
to be more frequent and more powerful than at low-z.
12.2.2 The proposal
The MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) will be the ﬁrst IFU instrument to provide the
sensitivity and resolving power to spatially and spectrally resolve H2 and forbidden ionized gas lines
at rest-frame near-IR and mid-IR wavelengths, out to z = 1.5 − 3.5. For the ﬁrst time, this will
allow us to directly investigate the physical state and the kinematics of the ionized gas and the warm
(> 150 K) molecular gas that is dynamically heated by the dissipation of mechanical energy associated
with galaxy merging and AGN feedback. We propose MIRI/MRS observations of selected sources to
address the following questions:
• Are AGN driving massive multiphase outﬂows carrying away the bulk of the ISM of the galaxy
and therefore quenching star formation in the host galaxy? If this is the case, we should ob-
serve broad, luminous H2 emission lines, with widths of 1000 km/s or more, by analogy to
the large velocity shears and dispersions that have been revealed by near-infrared integral ﬁeld
spectroscopy of the rest-frame optical emission lines in HzRGs (Nesvadba et al., 2006, 2008a).
The propose MIRI observations will allow to quantify the energy radiated and carried away by
molecular outﬂows.
• Does the H2 emission trace “pre-starburst” phases of interacting galaxies? Spitzer observa-
tions of the Stephan’s Quintet revealed that H2 line emission represents a major fraction of the
bolometric luminosity of the galaxy-wide shock (Appleton et al., 2006). This is a nearby ex-
ample of an H2-bright, early phase of a galaxy interaction, and we expect these systems to be
more frequent and more active at high-z. The proposed MIRI spectroscopy will explore galaxy
evolution beyond the active starburst and obscured/unobscured AGN phases, highlighted by
luminous dust emission, and test whether H2 emission is scaled-up at high-z or not.
Which lines will we look at? To establish the energy budget of the warm molecular gas and shock
diagnostics, we will use, in most cases, the full MIRI spectral range. In particular:
12. Science with the JWST and MIRI
• we will concentrate on the near-IR ro-vibrational lines, e.g.
the H2 1-0 S(1) 2.12 µm line,
and the mid-IR pure rotational H2 0-0 S(3) 9.7 µm and S(5) 6.9 µm lines. These lines will be
redshifted in the MRS spectral range (4.9 − 28.6 µm) for z = 1.5 − 3.5.
the molecular gas with that of the ionized gas.
• the forbidden ionized gas lines (e.g. [Ne II], [Ne III]) will be used to compare the kinematics of
• the synergy with NIRSPEC will be helpful to observe the CO bandheads and Ca II triplet to
estimate the stellar kinematics. This will allow to estimate the ratio between the bulk galaxy
rotation and the gas velocity dispersion in these high-z objects, and provide an absolute rest-
frame in which to interpret the gas motions as blueshift or redshift.
12.2.3 The sample
We propose to observe a representative sample of order 20-30 strongly star forming and AGN host
galaxies at z ∼ 1.5 − 3.5, using the MIRI medium-resolution (R ∼ 2200) spectrometer (MRS,
IFU mode). Our sample will include powerful radio galaxies, as well as radio-loud and radio-quiet
obscured and unobscured AGN. We will also include powerful, dusty starburst galaxies like sub-
millimeter galaxies and infrared-selected galaxies, many of which will be mergers. Suitable parent
samples already exist, e.g. Nesvadba et al. 2009, in preparation for HzRGs with deep rest-optical
IFU observations; Greve et al. (2005) for SMGs with CO observations; Yan et al. (2005) for powerful
infrared galaxies at z ∼ 2; Farrah et al. (2008) for 24 µm selected starbursts with PAH detections,
etc), and will be extended with the upcoming Herschel mission. The development of our models will
also help in selecting high-z, non IR-luminous, interacting systems that may be “pre-starbursts”.
12.2.4 Observing mode and integration times
Galaxies at high-z are gas-rich and large gas velocity dispersions show that the gas is not fully settled
in a rotating disk. This surplus in mechanical energy must be dissipated. Therefore, we expect H2
emission to be more powerful at high-z than for local sources.
We base the required sensitivity on the H2 luminosity of the most luminous low-redshift sources at
low redshift (a few 1043 erg s−1). With the resolving power of the MRS, (R ∼ 2200), corresponding
to a resolution of FWHM ∼ 140 km s−1, and typical observed line widths of FWHM ∼ 800 km s−1,
the lines will be resolved by a factor ∼ 6. Typical sizes of the outﬂows are ∼ 5”, for an IFU ﬁeld
of view of ∼ 8” × 8” for λ > 17 µm. Given that the spatial sampling is 0.64” across the slice and
0.27” along the slice, we will be able to resolve the molecular gas emission spatially and spectrally
and perform the ﬁrst spectral mappings of molecular AGN outﬂows at high-redshift. Using the MIRI
performance estimation, and assuming a narrow line plus extended source, we can reach an RMS of
10−20 W m−2 in 1 hour of on-source observing time for a ∼ 3” × 3” ﬁeld. At z ∼ 2.5 this will
correspond to a 10 σ detection limit for an H2 luminosity of 3 × 1043 erg s−1, for the integrated
spectrum. The typical observing time will be ∼ 1 hr on-source per exposure, i.e. 3 hrs to cover the
full wavelength range (A, B and C exposures). The total observing time for this project, excluding
overheads, would be of the order of 60 hrs for ∼ 20 sources.

Abstract
Observations of H2 luminous galaxies set molecular gas in a new context where one has to ac-
count for the presence of H2 outside galactic disks, characterize its physical state and describe
its relation to star formation. These observations and the theoretical framework presented in this
manuscript motivate new observations and theoretical studies that are discussed here. In partic-
ular, as for Stephan’s Quintet, in many of the H2-luminous galaxies the molecular gas has been
detected through the mid-IR H2 rotational lines prior to any CO observation. Thus we propose to
complement our knowledge of the mass and kinematics of the molecular gas in these sources by
CO observations. Then I present the theoretical perspectives, with emphasis on new numerical
studies that are needed to understand how the bulk kinetic energy released in the multiphase ISM
during violent phases of galaxy interactions is transferred into the warm molecular gas.

13.1 Observational perspectives
This thesis work has rich observational perspectives. The ﬂow of the discovery of H2-luminous
galaxies, and the observational and theoretical work presented in this manuscript, has inspired a
large number of follow-up observations. Here are a few examples that will complement our view of
molecular gas in galaxy evolution.
13.1.1 The search for molecular gas in active phases of galaxy evolution
A series of upcoming observations are proposed to search for warm H2 or associated CO gas in. . .
13. Perspectives
compact groups of galaxies: a Spitzer proposal (P.I.: P.N. Appleton) was prepared during my PhD
to search for H2 in HCGs1. This project has been motivated by the discovery of powerful H2
emission from the Stephan’s Quintet group. It has been observed and the data is being reduced.
I will participate to the interpretation of this data during my postdoc.
radio-galaxies: we propose to look for CO emission in a sample of radio-galaxies with the IRAM
30-m telescope (P.I.: M. Lehnert). The proposal has been submitted in September 2009. These
observations will determine the amount of kinetic energy carried by the cold molecular gas in
these radio-galaxies.
Observations at high spatial resolution of two speciﬁc radio galaxies, 3C293 and 3C433, with
the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) have been proposed (P.I.: N. Nesvadba).
These two sources, where powerful H2 is detected, are more complex than 3C326 because they
exhibit star formation.
In addition, a proposal has been submitted (P.I.: N. Nesvadba) to look at the “Minkowski’s
object”, a nearby and young starburst that might be triggered by the jet of a nearby radio galaxy.
This is our best candidate for “positive” feedback. The proposal aims at determining the mass
and kinematics of the cold molecular gas, in order to check whether these objects veriﬁes the
Schmidt law. We plan to complement these observations with VIMOS2 observations.
the M82 starburst driven wind: We have submitted (P.I.: F. Boulanger) a proposal in September
2009 to look for CO emission in the M82 superwind. We obtained deep Spitzer IRS observations
of the warm molecular gas in the wind (P.I: L. Armus) but the spectral resolution is not high
enough to measure outﬂow velocities or line widths. The CO data will allow to derive the
kinematics of the cold gas in the wind, which will help in elucidating some of the questions
raised above.
13.1.2 Observing H2-luminous galaxies with the JWST
During my PhD work, I have been working on the tests and the scientiﬁc preparation of the Mid-
Infrared Instrument (MIRI) that will be part of the scientiﬁc payload of the James Webb Space Tele-
scope (see chapter 11 and 12).
H2 in active phases of galaxy evolution at high-z
In particular, I have proposed a speciﬁc project to look at high-z H2-luminous objects with MIRI
to the MIRI European Consortium. The proposal is reproduced in chapter 12. It is speciﬁc to the
MIRI instrument and relies on the background presented in chapter 10. For the ﬁrst time, MIRI will
allow us the study the kinematics and excitation of the warm H2 gas in high-z objects. To collect
a sample of high-z objects, we will use the analogy between the characteristics of VLT/SINFONI3

13.1. Observational perspectives
Figure 13.1: Observing H2 lines at high-redshift with JWST/MIRI. The observed wavelengths of some
H2 lines are shown as a function of the redshift. The colored bars indicate the channels and bands of
the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) of the MIRI instrument. One observation corresponds to
four sub-bands, like 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A for instance (see sect. 10.3.4 for technical details about how the
MRS is working). The vertical lines indicate the redshifts of some high-z radio-galaxies that might
be interesting to look at with MIRI.
and JWST/MIRI. I will use high-z radio-galaxies SINFONI and Spitzer data (PI: N. Nesvadba, co-
I: P. Guillard) as a starting point to deﬁne the observing strategy. MIRI will allow integral ﬁeld
spectroscopy of redshifted optical or H2 lines (Fig. 13.1), at high spatial (1-2 kpc/pix) and spectral
(λ/∆λ ∼ 3 000) resolution. This spectral resolution is crucial to measure the kinematics of the
The Fig. 13.1 shows the visibility of the some H2 lines as a function of redshift. I also indicate, as
a function of redshift, in which sub-band of the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) these lines
are falling. This allows to conﬁgure the instrument for observations and estimate the integration time.
Fig. 13.1 is thus useful to prepare observation proposals.
An infrared high-resolution look at Stephan’s Quintet with JWST
In addition, in the near future, I will propose an observational program to investigate Stephan’s Quintet
with NirCam/NirSpec and MIRI, the near-IR and Mid-IR instruments onboard JWST (see chapter 10
for an introduction to these instruments). The NirCam and MIRI imagers will provide an unprece-
dented spatial resolution (comparable to the HST at 7 µm) to study small scales structures in the shock.
13. Perspectives
MIRI will allow us to clearly separate the dust emission associated with star-forming regions from that
associated with the shock itself. Multi-band imaging with NirCam and MIRI will allow to build a full
map of spectral energy distributions from 0.6 to 28 µm. This may be used to search for variations of
the dust properties across the shock. These variations may be interpreted in terms of dust processing
in shocks, and possibly related to velocity gradients in the warm molecular gas.
The spectral resolution of NirSpec (see sect. 10.2.5 for technical details) and MIRI’s Medium
Resolution Spectrometer (sect. 10.3.4) will provide for the ﬁrst time the kinematics of the warm H2
gas across the shock. This will allow us to map the relative velocities and dispersion velocities over
the SQ ridge, which we will compare with the kinematics of the CO gas presented in chapter 7. This
comparison will be particularly useful to estimate the efﬁciency of the dynamical coupling between
the warm and cold molecular gas.
13.2 Theoretical perspectives
The detection of powerful H2 emission in a diverse set of extragalactic sources with little or no star
formation highlights the need to understand the role of H2 formation and cooling for the dissipation
of mechanical energy in a multiphase ISM. The previous sections have shown that these observations
provide insights in the physics of galaxy interactions or of the regulation of star forming activity in
radio galaxies. An efﬁcient transfer of the bulk kinetic energy to molecular gas is required to make
H2 an important coolant and thus explain these observations. The dissipation of mechanical energy
within cold molecular gas, H2 formation and its collisional excitation, play a key-role in the physics
of turbulent mixing of gas phases.
13.2.1 A novel numerical study of the dynamical interactions between gas phases
In my thesis work, I reached a qualitative understanding on how the energy transfer may occur. The
fragmented, multiphase structure of the ISM is likely to be a main aspect. The dynamical interactions
between gas phases drive a mass cycle which contributes to the energy transfer in two ways: (1)
Gas cooling transfers the turbulent energy of the warm H II and H I to the H2 gas. (2) The thermal
instability induced by the gas cooling transfers a signiﬁcant fraction of the thermal energy of the gas
to turbulent energy. The turbulent velocities of the motions generated by the thermal instability are
expected to be commensurate with the sound speed in the warmer gas and thus are supersonic for the
colder gas. These non-linear aspects of the dynamical interaction between gas phases can only be
investigated quantatively with numerical simulations.
Numerical simulations (e.g. Audit and Hennebelle, 2005) show that the thermal instability pre-
vents energy from being radiated by the warmer gas to feed turbulence in the cooler gas.
started a collaboration with P. Lesaffre and E. Audit which I will pursue and extend during my post-
doc. We will use the RAMSES magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) adaptive Mesh Reﬁnement (AMR)
3-D code. It is essential to resolve thermal instability to quantify energy and mass exchanges. This
can only be achieved by including chemical evolution and its impact on the cooling efﬁciencies, and
we are currently writing a routine to introduce time-dependent chemistry and thermal diffusion in the
code. The main coolants are C+, O, H2, and CO. This code will be used to model mass cycling and
mechanical energy dissipation in a mutiphase ISM. This will be the ﬁrst simulation of the physical
13.2. Theoretical perspectives
and chemical evolution of a thermally unstable multiphase gas including a self-consistent treatment
of the H2, HI, HII and hot phases of the ISM. Including all phases requires a large dynamic range and
is beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art computing. We will hence describe the processes sequen-
tially, starting at the large scales. As we proceed to smaller scales we will include a more detailed
description of the thermal budget and chemistry of the gas.
We will ﬁrst study the effects of a large scale shock on a set of HI clouds embedded in a hot plasma.
Then we will study the fate of one of these clouds in greater details as it is being fragmented. We will
pay special attention to the energy transfer between these phases. Thanks to our AMR approach and
with a careful treatment of the thermal and chemical diffusion accross the boundaries between these
various phases, this will be possible.
We will also explore the momentum and energy transfer from a hot stream of gas into an initially
static molecular cloud. In both stellar and AGN feedback, it is of crucial importance to determine
whether the dynamical coupling between the tenuous outﬂow and the cloud is efﬁcient, and whether
it can power the amount of H2 emission seen in these H2-luminous sources.
Due to their proximity, starburst-driven winds or galactic supernova remnants provide a unique
opportunity to confront the model with data in great detail. Our interpretation will be based on the
physical conditions inferred from these numerical models. They will serve as input for detailed calcu-
lations of gas cooling and chemistry in shock models. This method relates the observational approach
(sect. 13.1) with our numerical and analytical models, and will also be applied to extragalactic sources.
13.2.2 Towards a phenomenological prescription of the impact of H2 on the energetics
of galaxy evolution
Though H2 emission is related to small scale processes, its formation and cooling power play a ma-
jor role in the overall energetics of violent phases of galaxy evolution. Numerical studies of galaxy
formation cannot properly account for these processes. Small scale simulations with sufﬁcient reso-
lution to include the detailed multiphase gas physics do not include the overall context of feedback
processes. Inversely, large-scale simulations can only include gas physics through phenomenological
recipes.
From the results obtained from the observational (sect. 13.1.2) and numerical (sect 13.2.1) ap-
proach of feedback, an ultimate goal would be to distill reasonably simple, but robust phenomenolog-
ical equations, which would approximate the physics of energy dissipation, and allow to predict H2
emission as a function of the physical parameters of a galaxy. These equations will represent a crucial
input to cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and the growth of structure. Ultimately, this
will allow to determine the role of the gas for the build-up of galaxies, and the importance of starburst
and AGN driven winds on the growth and properties of the ensemble of galaxies across cosmic time.
Since most of the galaxy mass build-up occurred at redshifts between 1 and 2, this prescription
will need to be tested with direct observations of sources in this redshift range. This will become
possible with JWST/MIRI (see sect. 13.1.2).

In this shock
front, you are heated to high tempera-

Sometimes you feel like going in the

Obviously, la vie n’est pas un long ﬂeuve tranquille, the preshock medium is inhomogeneous,

sometimes you hit a denser problem, and your speed is reduced, you need to think harder! Your

Modeling dust emission: the DUSTEM code
Abstract
This appendix brieﬂy presents the code that I have used to model the dust emission from the
Stephan’s Quintet galaxy collision. This code, so-called DUSTEM, is an update of the Désert
et al. (1990) model, which computes, from an input radiation ﬁeld, the emission, temperature
distribution, absorption and scattering cross-sections, as a function of the wavelength, for a size
distribution of grains including stochastically heated PAHs and very small grains. In the case of
optically thick (to UV radiation) molecular clouds, the DUSTEM code is coupled to a radiation
transfer code to take into account in a self-consistent way both the extinction and the heating of
dust grains by their own IR emission.
A.1 Introduction
Since the 1970’s, a lot of models were built to reproduce the observations of interstellar dust. The
Désert et al. (1990) model is one example among others. Since this ﬁrst publications, a lot of mod-
iﬁcations have been done. The most recent ones are reported in Compiègne et al. (2008). In the
following, I brieﬂy give the main features of the DUSTEM model, and its key parameters. The inter-
ested reader may consult the PhD thesis by Compiègne, M. (2007), Flagey, N. (2007) and Gonzalez
Garcia, M. (2009) for a description of the updates included in the code.
A.2 Dust models: populations and size distributions of grains
The DUSTEM model includes a mixture of three populations of dust grains with increasing sizes;
which is the minimum number of components needed to account for interstellar extinction and IR
dust emission. These components are the following.
• Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) of radius a = 0.4 − 1.2 nm, responsible for the
Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs) and the FUV non-linear rise in the extinction curve. Much of
the PAH emission is concentrated in features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 17 µm. Duley and
Williams (1981), followed by Léger and Puget (1984), identiﬁed these features as the optically
active vibrational modes of PAH molecules.
• Very Small Grains (VSGs, a = 1− 4 nm), which are carbonaceous nanoparticles producing the
mid-IR continuum emission and the extinction bump at 2175 Å.
• Big Grains (BGs, a = 4 − 110 nm) of silicates with carbonaceous mantles or inclusions, which
account for the far IR emission and the 1/λ rise at visible and near-IR wavelengths.

of the DUSTEM model (it is assumed that n(a) ∝ a−α with a between amin and amax), the mass density ρ of the grains,
and their maximum albedo β.
bThe grain populations are: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Very Small Grains (VSGs), and Big Grains
The version of the DUSTEM code I have used assumes the size distributions of all the dust populations
to be a power-law, n(a) ∝ a−3.5 (Mathis et al., 1977), with minimum and maximum radii listed in
the items above. The parameters of the grains used in the version of the code I use are gathered in
Table. A.1.
A.3 Updates and calculations
The model is designed to ﬁt both the interstellar extinction curve (see chapter. 2, sect. 2.3.2, Fig. 2.4)
and the infrared dust emission, in particular that of the diffuse interstellar medium. The dust proper-
ties, the dust-to-gas mass ratio, and the exciting radiation ﬁeld are provided by the user. The code then
calculates the dust SED νSν in units of erg s−1 H−1, the distribution of dust temperatures, as well as
the UV to IR absorption and scattering cross-sections in units of cm2 g−1, for each dust grain species,
as a function of the wavelength.
Since the original version of Désert et al. (1990), the absorption cross sections of the PAHs (with
addition of new Aromatic Infrared Bands, AIBs) and those of the VSGs and BGs, as well as the heat
capacities (graphite, PAH C-H, silicate and amorphous carbon) have been updated (Compiègne et al.,
In the diffuse interstellar medium, small grains (PAHs and VSGs) undergo temperature ﬂuctua-
tions triggered by the discrete absorption of stellar photons (see e.g. Draine, 2003, for a review). They
cool by emission in the near and mid-IR range. The code computes the probability distribution of
temperatures resulting from the stochastic heating of these grains. Conversely, BGs, which have a
longer cooling time and a shorter timescale between absorption of two photons because of their size,
stay at constant temperature. The code computes their emission as a grey body.
A.4 Inputs of the DUSTEM code
The inputs of the code are the following:
Grain properties: a ﬁle, named grain.dat list the types of grains and their density in [g cm−3]
for all types except the PAHs which are in g cm−2. The types of grains may be chosen from

the following list: 1 = graphite grain (Mie theory for spherical grains in the 1/3 − 2/3 approx-
imation, see Draine and Lee, 1984). 2 = PAH, 3 = BG (Désert et al., 1990), 4 = VSGs (Désert
et al., 1990), 5 = astro-silicates (Mie theory for spherical grains)
The ﬁle propmass.dat sets the mass abundance of the grains relative to H, calor.dat
lists the heat capacities for the different available grain species, and taille.dat deﬁnes the
size distribution for each grain population.
Incident radiation ﬁeld: the ﬁle isrf.dat contains the ﬂux of the input radiation ﬁeld in units of
erg s−1 cm−2 Hz−1, and lambda.dat is the associated wavelength grid in µm.
Absorption and scattering coefﬁcients are listed in the QABS_*.dat, one ﬁle for each type of
grains.
A.5 Outputs of the DUSTEM code
The code provides the following outputs:
Dust emissivity: the ﬁle dustem.res gives the dust emissivity in units of erg s−1 per Hydrogen
atom, as a function of the wavelength, for each population of grains.
Absorption and scattering cross-sections are listed, in units of [cm2 g−1], as a function of the wave-
length in secteffir.res for the infrared domain, and in secteffuv.res for the UV
domain.
A.6 When DUSTEM cooperates with the Meudon PDR1 code. . .
The spectral energy distribution of the IR dust emission does not only depend on the radiation ﬁeld and
the grain properties. It also depends on the physical structure of the molecular gas, and in particular
on its optical thickness to UV radiation. If a molecular cloud illuminated by a UV radiation ﬁeld is
optically thick to UV photons, the radiation ﬁeld is attenuated as it penetrates into the cloud, thus
reducing the dust heating. In addition, dust emission has a positive feedback on its own IR emission.
The local IR dust emission contributes to the IR radiation ﬁeld, and becomes a signiﬁcant heat source
within dark clouds where UV light is attenuated. I brieﬂy describe how these two effects are taken
into account in our modeling of dust emission from the Stephan’s Quintet galaxy collision presented
in chapter 8.
Modeling dust emission from optically thick (to UV) molecular clouds
To model the dust emission from a molecular cloud that is optically thick to UV radiation (see chap-
ter 8 and paper III), I have used the Meudon PDR (Photon Dominated Region) code2 to compute
1Photon-Dominated Region
2This code, fully described in Le Petit et al. (2006), is available on the web on http://aristote.obspm.fr/MIS and will be
incorporated in the Virtual Observatory.
A. Modeling dust emission: the DUSTEM code
the radiative transfer through the cloud. This 1-dimensional, steady-state model considers a station-
ary plane-parallel slab of gas and dust, illuminated by UV radiation. The radiation ﬁeld output Iν
of the Meudon PDR code is used as input to the DUSTEM program to compute the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the dust as a function of the optical depth into the cloud.
This 2-step process is iterated to take into account dust heating by the dust IR emission. The
interface between the DUSTEM code and the Meudon PDR code represents a signiﬁcant update,
described in the PhD thesis by Gonzalez Garcia, M. (2009). In the present version, so-called PDR-
DUSTEM, the thermal balance of the grains resulting from the IR continuum emission of the dust
is now solved. A ﬁrst run is done with the Meudon PDR code to solve for the radiative transfer
and compute the radiation ﬁeld Iν through the slab of gas. Then, the DUSTEM program is called
to compute the dust temperature distribution and the dust contribution to Iν. This 2-step process is
iterated until the calculation of the dust emission has converged (usually 4 − 5 iterations).
Appendix B
Deconvolution of high-resolution PSF: bayesian formalism
Abstract
In this appendix I give a brief description of the formalism used to devonvolve a high-resolution
image from several low-resolution ones. I have applied this algorithm to reconstruct a high resolu-
tion PSF image from the data provided by the microscanning test (see chapter 11). This algorithm
was developed by T. Rodet at LSS, Orsay.
B.1 The inverse problem
The aim of the deconvolution is to reconstruct a high-resolution image, denoted by x, from multiple
low-resolution images. These low-resolution images are co-added on a ﬁne grid. We denote z the
LR image that have been over-sampled on a ﬁne grid. This image is still “blurred”, but its number of
pixels is a factor f 2 higher than the observed LR image. z is the convolution of the HR image x that
we want to calculate by the impulse-response (PSF) of the detector:
z = Rx + n
One cannot apply the classical methods of deconvolution because part of the data is not observed (due
to uncertainties on the translations, see sect. 11.5.3). Indeed, there are missing parts, “holes”, in the
data because the source is not exactly at its expected position on the ﬁne grid image. The Fig. 11.12
shows the PSF data co-added onto a ﬁne grid with an over-sampling factor of 11. We illustrate the
truncation of the data by comparing the results of the co-addition when using the expected positions
of the source, to the results when using the shifts estimated by cross-correlation. The additional
truncation for the effective translations comes from the mismatch between expected and real position
of the source.
We recall that, because of truncation of the data (we miss some part of the data on the highly-
sampled grid), a truncation matrix T is introduced in Eq. B.1:
z = T Rx + n = Hx + n
T is a mask with pixels value of 1 where the data exists, and 0 otherwise. The operator H = T R
returns the measurements z from the HR image x. To solve the deconvolution problem, a bayesian
formalism is used. In the following, I brieﬂy give the basis of the formalism we use to estimate x, the
HR image.
B. Deconvolution of high-resolution PSF: bayesian formalism
B.2 Bayesian inference
Solving inverse problems involves statistical methods that have been used since many decades to
perform signal processing. In practice, these methods rely on the minimization of a quadratic criterion,
that we will express below. The estimator used to minimize this criterion can be interpreted in a
Bayesian framework. The Bayesian inference process, in which observations are used to infer the
probability that an hypothesis is true, is based on the Bayes’ theorem. We denote z the measured data
and C a variable that gathers the model of data acquisition and the parameters a priori. The Bayes’
law is expressed as:
f (x|z, C) =
f (z|x, C) f (x|C)
f (z|C)
The terms of the Bayes’ theorem are the following. f (z|x, C) is the likelihood, i.e. the probability
distribution of the data if we know the physical quantity x. This probability gathers all the information
about our knowledge on the data acquisition system, and can be determined by solving the direct
the knowledge about
problem (sect. 11.5.2). In Eq. B.3, f (x|C) is the prior probability of x, i.e.
x before doing the measurements. It is the prior in the sense that it does not take into account any
infomation about z. The Bayes’ formula gives f (x|z, C), the conditional probability of x, given z.
it represents all the information we have on the problem. It is also called the posterior probability
because it is derived from the speciﬁed value of z. f (z|C) is the prior probability of z, and acts as a
normalizing constant. This constant is chosen as to make the integral of the function f (x|z, C) equal
to 1, so that it is indeed a probability density function. Intuitively, the Bayes’ theorem in this form
describes the way in which one’s knowledge about observing the HR data (x) is updated by having
observed the LR data (z).
B.3 Least-square criterion and minimization technique
The estimate of the value ˆx is given by the argument of the maximum of the posterior probability
function, often called posterior maximum likelihood:
ˆxML = arg max(f (x|y, C))
The noise n is assumed to be Gaussian, independent and uniform over the whole image. Therefore
we use a gaussian likelihood:
Therefore we obtain the least-squares estimator:
f (z|x, C) = K e
− (z−Hx)2
ˆxML = arg max(f (z|x, C))
− (z−Hx)2
= arg max
(cid:18)
(cid:18)
(cid:19)
(cid:19)
(z − Hx)2
= arg max
= arg min((z − Hx)2)
= arg min((cid:107)z − T Rx(cid:107)2 + µ(cid:107)Dx(cid:107)2)
B.3. Least-square criterion and minimization technique
µ is the regularization parameter. The last equation deﬁnes the regularized least-square estimator,
where D is the ﬁnite differences operator (Laplacian). D has a size (N − 1) × N and can be written


0 ···
0 ···
The least-square criterion, QLS, to minimize in Eq. B.10 is quadratic and can be re-written as:
QLS(x) = (y − Hx)t(y − Hx) + µxtDtDx
The solution is explicit:
ˆxML = (H tH + µDtD)
−1H tz
The main issue with this explicit solution is that the size of the matrix H tH can be large and its
inversion can be very time-consuming. Since the criterion to minimize is quadratic, it is convex and
has a unique minimizor. We use a method called “gradient descent” or “steepest descent”, which
consists in starting from whatever value for x, and then converge to the solution in the direction of the
steepest slope (opposite of the gradient’s direction). At each step, this algorithm ensures that, after a
sufﬁcient number of iterations, we will approach the required minimum value of the criterion. Thus
we calculate the gradient of the criterion to minimize:
∂QLS(x)
= 2 H t(Hx − z) + 2µDtDx
and we update the solution with the following equation:
xk+1 = xk − αopt(H t(Hxk − y) + µDtDxk) ,
where αopt is the optimal step to ensure the most efﬁcient descent is the opposite direction of the
gradient. This step is calculated by cancelling the gradient with respect to α. In our case, we use
a variant of the gradient descent, so-called “conjugate gradient descent”, which consists in having
orthogonal directions at each descent steps.

One of the most surprising results obtained with the Spitzer space telescope was the discovery
of powerful mid-IR H2 line emission from a signiﬁcant number of sources that are in active
phases of galaxy evolution. The underlying physics may be a key ingredient to describe the
build-up of baryonic mass in galaxies and their evolution. We focus here on the interpretation
of observations of interacting/merging systems and AGN host galaxies. They provide insights
on the exchange of mass between galaxies and the intergalactic medium and the energetics
of galaxy formation. The Stephan’s Quintet (SQ), a compact group of interacting galaxies,
is a striking example showing that dust survives in a high-speed galaxy collision and that H2
forms in the halo of the group. This is also true for galactic winds driven by AGN feedback or
starbursts. In SQ and in H2-luminous galaxies in general, we propose that the H2 emission is
powered by the dissipation of the mechanical energy provided by galaxy merging or feedback.
Shocks driven into multiphase gas lead to efﬁcient dissipation of this energy at small scales,
within molecular gas.

How the gas cools and fuels galaxy formation and what processes regulate star formation in
galaxies are some major questions of extragalactic astronomy. We focus on galaxy collisions
and mergers which are observed to trigger IR-luminous bursts of star formation. Recently,
E. The show must go on!
Spitzer observations show that some interacting systems stand out for having a high H2 to IR
luminosity ratio. We propose that these systems represent an intermediate phase in the evolution
of mergers, prior to the starburst. Observations and modeling contribute to deﬁne a physical
framework of the mechanical energy dissipation in this H2-luminous stage. The H2 excitation
show that highly-turbulent (10 − 50 km/s) molecular gas is formed within hot gas. The cloud
turbulence is powered by a slow energy and momentum transfer from the gas bulk motion. We
propose that the timescale to dissipate the collision kinetic energy represents the time necessary
for the molecular gas to settle in gravitationally bound clouds and therefore to form stars.
• Poster, PCMI Session: “H2 Formation and Excitation in the Stephan’s Quintet Galaxy-
Wide Shock”, P. Guillard, F. Boulanger, G. Pineau des Forêts, P.N. Appleton
Spitzer has detected an extremely powerful (L > 1041 erg s−1), shock-powered, mid-IR H2
emission towards the Stephan’s Quintet (SQ) galaxy group (Appleton et al. 06). This is the ﬁrst
time an almost pure H2 line spectrum has been seen in an extragalactic object. The luminosity
in the H2 lines exceeds by a factor of ≈ 2 the surface brightness in X-rays. How can we explain
such a huge amount of molecular gas (MH2 ≈ 4 × 107 M(cid:12)) coexisting with a X-ray emitting
plasma? How come there is no star formation associated with H2? We summarize in this poster
the main results of a scenario (P. Guillard et al. 08) where the molecular gas is formed in the
shock. The pre-shock gas is assumed to be inhomogeneous because the shock has induced
formation of both hot (5 × 106 K) plasma and warm (102−3 K) H2. Our model (P. Guillard
et al. 2008) computes the physical and chemical evolution of the shock heated gas, including
density inhomogeneities in the pre-shock medium and dust destruction. Schematically, low
density preshock gas (nH < 0.01 − 0.001 cm−3) is shocked at high speed (≈ 1000 km/s for
SQ) and becomes a dust-free X-ray emitting plasma. Denser gas (nH > 0.1 cm−3) is heated
at lower temperatures and dust survives.
In the context of the SQ shock, this gas had time
to cool and become molecular. Only a fraction of the collision energy is used to heat the hot
plasma. Therefore, a large fraction of the gas energy is stored in bulk gas motions. We propose
that, in such conditions, the H2 emission must be powered by a slow transfer of energy from
fast bulk gas motions into low velocity (< 40 km/s) supersonic turbulent motions within the
molecular gas. We phenomenologically model this turbulent motions by J-type and magnetic
C-type shocks into the newly-formed molecular gas. We show that the observed H2 line ﬂuxes
are very well reproduced for densities nH = 103 − 104 cm−3 and shock velocities within the
5 − 35 km/s range. SQ is a unique object for studying the physics of galaxy-wide shocks and
understanding their key-role in the formation and excitation of H2. This detailed study of the SQ
shock deﬁnes a physical framework to interpret observations of H2-bright galaxies in general.

• The Stephan’s Quintet: a beautiful case of H2 formation in shocks
Recently, Spitzer IRS (Infra-Red Spectrometer) observations led to the unexpected detection
of extremely bright mid-IR (L > 1041 erg s−1) H2 rotational line emission (Appleton et al.
2006) from warm gas towards the group-wide shock in Stephan’s Quintet (hereafter SQ). This
E.2. Seminars
ﬁrst result was quickly followed by the detection of bright H2 line emission from more distant
galaxies (Egami et al. 2006, Ogle et al. 2007) and from the NGC 1275 and NGC 4696 cooling
ﬂows (Johnstone et al. 2007).
Because of the absence or relative weakness of star forming signatures (dust features, ionized
gas lines) in the mid-infrared Spitzer spectra, the H2 emission must be powered by large-scale
shocks, associated with galaxy interactions but also possibly with gas infall and AGN feedback.
But how can we explain such a huge amount of molecular gas coexisting with a hot plasma at
5 × 106 K ? How come there is no (or very few) star formation associated with H2?
I will focus this talk on SQ, a group of four interacting galaxies. The shock is created by the
galaxy NGC 7318b which is colliding with a tidal stream at a relative velocity of ∼ 1 000 km/s.
SQ is then a unique object where one can study the physics of galactic wide shocks. I will
present the results of a model capable of interpreting the observations. Two key-points of
our calculations of the physical and chemical evolution of the shock-heated dusty plasma will
be emphasized: dust destruction and the inhomogeneity of the galaxy and intragroup gas.
Schematically, low density (nH < 0.1 cm−3) gas is shocked at high speed. It becomes the
X-ray emitting gas where dust is destroyed. Higher density gas (nH > 1 cm−3) is heated to
lower temperatures and the dust survives. In the context of the SQ shock, this gas had time to
cool and become molecular.
In the near future, this model will be extended to more distant objects belonging to this newly
discovered and potentially important population of H2-bright galaxies. In particular, these H2
mid-IR lines appear to be a powerful diagnostic of unexplored steps in galaxy evolution.

• Talk, PCMI Session: “Noble Gas Implantation into SiC Stardust: Constraints on Astro-
physical Processes”. P. Guillard, A. Jones, A.G.G.M. Tielens
Primitive meteorites contain presolar grains that originated in stellar outﬂows and supernovae
ejecta prior to the formation of the solar system. We show that the measured elemental abun-
dances of noble gas atoms trapped into meteoritic SiC grains can be understood in terms of
ion irradiation and erosion in circumstellar and interstellar media. A simple atom implantation
and grain erosion model has been developed that allows us to provide new insights on dust
processing and on the physical conditions that reign in these environments.

• H2 Formation and Excitation in Galaxy-wide Shocks
Spitzer space telescope observations led to the surprising detection of a diverse set of extra-
galactic sources whose infrared spectra are dominated by line emission of molecular hydrogen.
The absence or relative weakness of typical signs of star formation (like dust features or lines
of ionized gas) suggest the presence of large quantities of molecular gas with no (or very little)
associated star formation. These observations set a new light on the contribution of H2 to the
cooling of the interstellar medium, on the relation between molecular gas and star formation,
and on the energetics of galaxy formation.
I will focus on the striking example of the galaxy-wide shock in Stephan’s Quintet, where a
galaxy is colliding with a tidal tail at a relative velocity of 1000 km/s. Observations show that
exceptionally turbulent H2 gas is coexisting with a hot, X-ray emitting plasma. The extreme
mid-IR H2 emission from the shock exceeds that of the X-rays. I will present the observations
and show how they can be interpreted by considering that the shock is moving through an
inhomogeneous medium. Observations suggest that most of the shock energy is transferred
to bulk kinetic energy of the H2 gas. The turbulent energy of the post-shock gas drives a
mass cycle across the different gas phases where H2 is forming out of the hot/warm gas. This
interpretation puts the H2 emission into a broader astrophysical context including optical and
X-ray observations.
We propose that the turbulence in the clouds is powered by a slow energy and momentum
transfer from the bulk motion of the gas, and that the dissipation of this turbulent energy in turn
is powering the H2 emission. The timescale to dissipate the kinetic energy from the collision
may set the relaxation time for the molecular gas to settle in gravitationally bound clouds and
ultimately to form stars.
Our detailed study of Stephan’s Quintet represents an important step in deﬁning a physical
framework to describe the dissipation of mechanical energy in H2-luminous galaxies. I will
discuss the relevance of H2 formation for the energetics of key processes that participate in
galaxy formation: galaxy interactions, gas accretion, and AGN feedback.
