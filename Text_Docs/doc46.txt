Abstract Part of Speech POS is a very vital topic in Natural 
Language  Processing  NLP  task  in  any  language  which 
involves  analysing  the  construction  of  the  language  behaviours 
and the  dynamics of  the language the  knowledge  that could  be 
utilized  in  computational  linguistics  analysis  and  automation 
applications  In  this  context  dealing  with  unknown  words 
words do not appear in the lexicon referred as unknown words 
is  also  an  important  task  since  growing  NLP  systems  are  used 
in  more  and  more  new  applications  One  aid  of  predicting 
lexical  categories  of  unknown  words  is  the  use  of  syntactical 
knowledge of the language   The  distinction  between open class 
words and closed class words together with  syntactical features 
of the language used in this research to predict lexical categories 
of  unknown  words  in  the  tagging  process  An  experiment  is 
performed  to  investigate  the  ability  of  the  approach  to  parse 
unknown  words  using  syntactical  knowledge  without  human 
intervention This experiment shows that the performance of the 
tagging process is enhanced when word class distinction is used 
together  with  syntactic  rules  to  parse  sentences  containing

I  INTRODUCTION 
Part  of  speech  tagging  is  one  of  the  pivotal  steps  in  the 
knowledge  acquiring  process  in  natural  language  processing 
task  The  fundamental  processing  step  in  tagging  consists  of 
assigning  POS  tags  to  every  token  in  the  text  with  a 
corresponding  POS  tag  like  noun  verb  preposition  etc 
based  both  on  its  definition  as  well  as  its  context 
Appearance of an unknown is the one of the problems that is 
facing  in  natural  language  parsing  systems  ie  the  words 
that  appear  in  sentences  but  are  not  contained  within  the 
lexicon  New  words  are  continually  coined  to  the  language 
and  people  will  often  use  words  is  parsing  that  the  system 
may  not expect This problem get  worse  when NLP systems 
are used for more and more on-line computer applications  
This  paper  will  discuss  how  well  a  distinction  of  Sinhala 
word classes syntactic rules can be used in parsing sentences 
containing  unknown  words  in  natural  language  processing 
tasks  The  distinction  between  closed  class  and  open  class 
words  should  help  to  refine  the  possibilities  for  unknown 
words  then  syntactic  knowledge  can  be  used  to  aid  in  the 
analysis of unknown words sentence structure which can be 
a  strong  evidence  for  the  possible  part  of  speech  of  an 
unknown word We expect that these two knowledge sources 
will  greatly  improve  tagging  ability  to  process  and  handle 
with words that are not in the system corpus 
this  paper  we  presents 
importance  of  handling 
unknown  word  in  part  of  speech  tagging  process  and  an 
approach  is suggested Section II of  this paper gives an  idea 
of  the  background  of  the  problem  and  details  of  previous 
research    Section  III  describes  distinction  of  open  class  and 
closed class words in Sinhala language and section IV gives 
details  of  morphological  and  syntactical  analysis  of  the 
current  text  corpus  Section  V  discusses  about  the  approach 
that  we  have  proposed  for  guessing  parts  of  speech  for 
unknown words  Section VI and VII discuss the Evaluation 
testing  and  the  results  and  section  VIII  concludes  the  paper 
and describes the future work 
II  BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM  OF UNKNOWN WORDS 
Appearance  of  unknown  words  is  one  of  the  frequently 
occurring problems facing in part of speech tagging process 
ie the words that appear in sentences but are not contained 
within  the  training  corpus  New  words  are  continually 
entering  the  language  Acronyms  and  proper  names  are 
created very often and new nouns and verbs are adding to the 
language  in  a  surprising  rate  So  it  is  impossible  to  train  the 
tagger for every possible word in the language So unknown 
words are non-negligible in POS tagging Therefore in order 
to build a complete tagger tagger must be incurred with some 
knowledge of suggesting the tag for an unknown word  
There  are  two  approaches  to handle  unknown  words  The 
first  approach  is  to  attempt  to  construct  a  complete  lexicon 
then deal with unknown words in a simple way For example 
rejecting  the  input  The  second  approach  is  to  attempt  to 
analyse the word at the time of encounter with using a set of 
human defined rules This would allow the tagger to process 
sentences containing unknown words  
Before  examining  the  problem  in  detail  it  is  useful  to 
consider  work 
that  has  already  been  done  by  other 
researchers  There  have  been  several  attempts  to  study  the 
problem  of  learning  unknown  words  These  attempts  have 
followed  several  different  methodologies  and  have  focused 
on various aspects of the unknown words 
Previous  techniques  reported  for  other  languages  such  as 
English have mostly utilize the guessing rules to analyse the 
word  features  by  looking  at  leading  and  trailing  characters 
Most  of  them  employ  the  analysis  of  trailing  characters  and 
other  features  such  as  capitalization  and  hyphenation  Some 
of  them  use  more  morphologically  oriented  word  features 
such  as  suffixes  prefixes  and  character  lengths  The 
guessing  rules  are  usually  use  knowledge  of  morphology  of 
the language  
The  simple  possible  way  that  suggested  2  is  to  consider 
each  unknown  word  that  is  ambiguous  among  all  possible 
tags  with equal probability and then  using contextual POS-
trigram from the corpus to suggest the proper tag  
There  are  more  complex  methods  which  have  been  tried 
out  by  other  researchers  for  dealing  with  unknown  words 
using morphological and syntactical features of the language 
Eric  Brill  3  make  use  of  morphology  to  handle  unknown 
words  during  part  of  speech  tagging  process  Brills  tagger 
begins  by  tagging  unknown  words  as  proper  noun  if 
capitalized  as  common  noun  if  not  Then  the  tagger  learns 
various transformational rules in the training process from the 
tagged corpus Then it applies these rules to unknown words 
to tag with the appropriate parts of speech category Scott M 
Thede  and  Mary  Harper  5  in  their  paper  presented  an 
approach  using  morphology  and  syntactic  parsing  rules  in 
post-mortem  method  for  determining  the  probable  lexical 
classes of words Tetsuji Taku Kudoh and Yuji 6 proposed 
a  POS  tagging  approach  for  unknown  English  words  using 
Support  Vector  Machines  SVM  SVM  classifiers  are 
created  for  each  POS  tag  using  all  words  in  the  training  set 
then  POS  tags  to  unknown  words  predict  using  those 
classifiers 
But  an  agglutinative  language  presents  more  serious 
problems  with  unknown  words  unlike  English  Gary 
Jeongwon Jong-Hyeok 4 have proposed a syllable-pattern-
based  generalized  unknown-morpheme  estimation  method 
using  a  morpheme  pattern  dictionary  in  their  statistical  and 
rule-based hybrid POS tagging system for Korean language 
Since Sinhala is also a complex morphologically rich and 
agglutinative  language  information  about  morphology  or 
how word is spelled is very difficult to use in unknown word 
prediction algorithms  
III OPEN CLASS VS CLOSED CLASS WORDS 
Traditionally 
the  definition  of  POS 
is  based  on 
morphological  and  syntactic  functions  Similar  to  most  of 
other languages POS in Sinhala language also can be divided 
into  two  broad  categories  closed  class  type  and  open  class 
type  Closed  classes  are  those  that  have  relatively  fixed 
membership  Closed  class  words  are  generally  function 
words  which  tend  to  be  very  short  occur  frequently  and 
play an important role in grammar  By contrast open class is 
the  type  that  lager  number  of  words  are  belong  in  any 
language and new words are continually coined or borrowed 
from  other  languages  The  words  that  are  usually  containing 
main  content  of  a  sentence  are  belonged  to  open  word  class 
category 
In Sinhala all  Nouns and Verbs can be categorized under 
open  word  class  But  Nipatha  and  Upasarga  behave 
differently in Sinhala grammar Words belong to Nipatha and 
Upasarga  are  not  changed  according  to  time  and  gender 
Upasarga  always  join  with  nouns  and  provide  additional 
improved meaning to the noun therefore Upasarga are not 
categorized  under  any  of  word  class  but  Nipatha  can  be 
categorized as closed class words based on their existence 
In-addition  to  that  Sinhala  Pronouns  can  be  classified  as 
open  class  words  based  on  their  morphological  properties 
but  Pronouns  also  can  be  classified  as  closed  class  words 
based on their existence of fixed membership in the language  
IV ANALYSIS OF MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTICAL 
NLP based language analysis mainly aid by morphological 
and  syntactical  features  analysis  of  a  language  and  the 
availability  of  lexical  resources  is  essential  in  this  tasks  So 
having  a  corpus  for  a  language  is  an  important  lexical 
resource  in  the  field  of  NLP  In  order  to  make  the  corpora 
more useful for doing linguistic research they are required to 
annotate  with  respective  knowledge  sources  to  make  it 
suitable to process with linguistics applications One example 
of  annotating  a  corpus  is  part  of  speech  tagging  in  which 
information  about  each  words  part  of  speech  verb  noun 
adjective etc is added to the corpus in the form of tags 
the  Corpus  developed  by 
The corpus that we use in this research is the beta version 
the  UCSC  under  PAN 
Localization project in 2005 7 which contains around 2754 
sentences and 90551 words tagged with corresponding part of 
speech tag that comprise of data drawn from different kinds 
of  Sinhala  newspaper  articles  under  different  classifications 
mainly form Art Sports Science Indigenous knowledge and 
Religion  
We  performed  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  corpus  to 
understand what rules govern the language and what patterns 
occur  Empirical  results  of  the  analysis  is  described  in  this 
paper  in  detail  A  substantial  effort  was  made  at  the  corpus 
preparation  phase  to  correct  issues  encountered  in  the 
formatting of the text in the corpus   
 In order to further analysis of the corpus word frequency 
distribution and the tag frequency distribution  were obtained 
from  the  corpus  by  running  a  simple  tokenizing  program 
Tags  with 
tokens 
numbers  foreign  words  etc  were  removed  from  the  list 
after manual inspection 
typographical  errors  and 
irrelevant 
A  Most Frequent Words in Sinhala Text Corpus 
This analysis was performed to observe the words and Part 
of  Speech  categories  that  are  more  frequent  in  Sinhala  text 
corpus  In  order  to  observe  most  frequent  words  a  distinct 
word  list  with  frequencies  were  obtained  from  the  corpus 
along  with  possible  part  of  speech  tags  For  simplicity  only 
top  20  words  were  considered  in  the  analysis  Table  I 
contains the list of words with frequencies and possible part 
of speech categories 
It  is  observed  that  most  frequent  words  in  Sinhala 
language  are  function  words  which  belong  to  closed  class 
category 11 out of 20 words belong to Nipatha which all are 
function words 6 frequent verbs are also within the list It is 
also  observed  that  tagging  ambiguity  exists  among  high 
frequent  words  though  they  are  function  words  There  are 
two words among top 20 words  and  that are not 
properly classified into respective parts of speech categories  
B  Zipfs Law Analysis 
Zipfs  Law  states  that  the  frequency  of  occurrence  of  an 
instance  of  a  class  is  roughly  inversely  proportional  to  the 
rank  of  that  class  in  the  frequency  list  for  example 
occurrences of  words in a document So the goal of this test 
was  to  observe  parts  of  speech  distribution  within  Sinhala 
language displays the Zipfs Law behavior 
Suppose  that a  word occurs f times and that in the list of 
word  frequencies  it  has  a  certain  rank  r  if  Zipfs  Law  holds 
we have for all words f  arb where a and b are constants 
and b is close to  minus 1 -1 Taking the logarithm of each 
side of the equation we get

The  objective  of  this  test  is  to  observe  the  Likelihood 
distribution of parts of speech tags in Sinhala text corpus and 
understand  which  tags  are  most  likely  to  appear  Table  III 
contains  tag  distribution  obtained  from  the  corpus  Tag 
frequency and number of distinct words  with respect to each 
tag were counted from the corpus The Likelihood Estimates 
were calculated for each tag based on number of occurrences

we  can  observe  that  the  tag  frequencies  are  roughly  form  a 
line from the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner of the

According to Fig II NNN Common Noun Neuter seems 
to  be  the  most  frequent  tag  in  the  corpus  and  it  seems  to 
appear  about  three  times  more  frequently  than  VP  Verb 
Participle It is also noticed that more than 50 of words are 
noun  in  the  corpus  around  10  belongs  to  verbsverbal 
parses  So  in  general  we  can  say  around  60  of  words  in 
Sinhala language are belong to open class type while around 
40 of words belongs to the closed class type 
D  Words distribution by Tag 
The objective of this test is to analyze what type of words 
are exist mostly in Sinhala language  Fig III is plotted based 
on  data  presented  in  Table  III  which  shows  the  distribution 
of  number  of  distinct  words  by  POS  category  in  the  corpus  
It is observed that most of the words in Sinhala language are 
nouns which is 13047 words are nouns out of total of 18957 
distinct words in the corpus that is almost around 68 of the 
total number of words in the corpus

V  GUESSING PART OF SPEECH FOR UNKNOWN WORDS 
Tagging data with unknown words is also an essential task 
in the tagger When the system reach  an unknown  word the 
initial  version  of  the  tagger  doesnt  cater  unknown  words 
thus  tagger  fails  to  propose  a  tag  since  the  system  is  not 
trained for that word and the tagging algorithm doesnt have 
enough intelligence to propose tags for untrained words  
language 
in  which 
Since  Sinhala  is  a  complex  morphologically  rich  and 
agglutinative 
information  about 
morphology  or  how  word  spelled  is  very  difficult  to  use  in 
unknown  word  prediction  algorithms  unlike  English    So  in 
our  research  the  important  source  of  information  that  we 
have  used  the  distribution  of  words  and  parts  of  speech  So 
improvements  of  the  algorithm  focused  on  words  belong  to 
sub  categories  of  open  class  words  such  as  noun  verbs  and 
pronouns  Due  to  fixed  number  of  membership  in  closed 
class word category we can assume that the words belong to 
closed  class  category  are  well  defined  in  Sinhala  grammar 
and  that  is  fixed  Hence  improvement  could  be  done  by 
incurring  knowledge  of  distinction  between  closed  class  and 
open class words Syntactic knowledge can be used to aid in 
the  analysis  of  unknown  words  sentence  structure  Then 
suggest  corresponding  part  of  speech  and  calculate  the 
trigram  using  Hidden  Markov  Model  HMM  for  unknown 
words 
Considering the fact that the tag likelihood distribution and 
the  word  frequency  distribution  of  the  language  it  is  clear 
that NNN is the most frequent part of speech in the language 
The  NNN  tag  likelihood  is  the  highest  likelihood  and  it  is  3 
times  greater  than  VP    By  considering  word  frequency 
distribution by tags in Fig III provide evidence that the most 
of  the  words  in  the  language  are  NNNs  which  is  5  times 
more  than  NNPI  Based  on  above  two  factors  the  simplest 
way  that  could  handle  unknown  words  we  can  assume  and 
guess  NNN  as  part  of  speech  tag  for  each  new  word 
encountered in the tagging process 
  More  advanced  approach  of  guessing  parts  of  speech  is 
the consideration of the distinction between closed class and 
open  class  words  This  distinction  can  simplified  the 
unknown  prediction  algorithm  by  distinguishing 
syntactical  categories  into  separate  groups  that  can  greatly 
simplify the task of processing unknown words in a sentence  
Closed class parts of  speech  are those that  have relatively 
fixed membership in the language and that may not normally 
be assigned to new words Closed class words are words with 
a  closed  class  part  of  speech  For  example  words  belong  to 
Nipatha in Sinhala language are the member of closed class 
which  has  fixed  membership  in  the  language  it  is  very  rare 
that  a  new  Conjunctions  CC  Determiners  DET  or 
Postpositions  POST  are  added  to  the  language  In  addition 
to that words belong to Pronoun PRP are also considered as 
fixed in its existence in the language and new Pronouns are 
very  rarely  created  So  Pronouns  are  also  considered  as 
closed  class  parts  of  speech  in  this  research  Table  IV 
contains  a  list  of  parts  of  speech  tags  that  are  considered  as 
closed class categories in this research and will be avoided in 
guessing for unknown words 
Based  on  morphological  and  syntactical  features  of 
Sinhala  language  open  class  words  are  comprised  of  words 
with  the  following  parts  of  speech  nouns  verbs  Noun  in 
Kriya  Mula  and  Adjective  in  Kriya  Mula  Adjectives 
adverbs  and  Verb  Participle  are  also  considered  under  this 
classification in this research Table V contains the complete 
list of parts of speech tags considered as open class category 
since those words are syntactically used to modify nouns and 
verbs  
TABLE IV

this  research  we  assume 
that  each  new  word 
encountered in the part of speech tagging process of Sinhala 
language  belong  to  open  word  class  category  hence  the 
unknown  word  algorithm  is  to  pretend  that  each  unknown 
word is ambiguous among all open class part of speech tags 
with  equal  probability  Then  the  tagger  computes  the  tag 
sequence  probability  and  maximum  likelihood  probabilities 
rely  on  text  corpus  and  suggest  the  proper  tag    Further 
foreign  words  and  numerals  were  handled  separately  since 
they do not form any syntactical relationship  with other part 
of speech categories in the language 
VI EVALUATION 
The  evaluation  of  the  system  was  mainly  driven  by 
training  the  system  using  the  Sinhala  text  corpus  that 
comprised of 2754 sentences and 90551 words in which data 
drown from Sinhala newspaper articles from various genres  
For  the  test  data  set  data  were  carefully  selected  aiming 
for testing three different versions of the tagger The first set 
was collected from the training corpus aiming to test Version 
1  of  the  tagger  that  comprised  of  621  words  only  known  to 
the  system  and  36  sentences  The  second  test  set  was  also 
collected aiming to test Version 2 and 3 of the tagger which 
data  were  drown  from  Sinhala  text  corpus  outside  from  the 
trained  data  set  The  second  test  set  comprised  of  51 
sentences  1024  words  Out  of  1024  words  171  words  were 
unknown  to  the  system  To  evaluate  the  performance  of  the 
tagger two gold standard test sets were created

The tagger evaluated by comparing the tagged output with 
the Gold standard test set  The accuracy was calculated using 
number  of  correct  tags  proposed  by  the  system  and  total 
number of words in the sentences by the following formula 
RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
The  performance  of  the  tagger  was  measured  using  three 
different  versions  of  progressively  upgraded 
tagging 
mechanisms Version 1 is the simplest form of the tagger that 
performs  well  only  with  known  words  that  rejects  all 
unknown words as tagging failures Version 2 is a somewhat 
upgraded version that treats all unknown words as nouns and 
suggest  NNN  to  each  new  word  encountered  in  the  tagging 
process  Version  3  is  the  full  version  of  the  tagger  that  uses 
statistical  technique  to  guess  the  best  tag  for  unknown  word 
by considering the context of surrounding words  
  Table VI shows our systems performance for these three 
different versions of tagging mechanisms and the experiment 
verifies  the  effectiveness  of  our  unknown  word  guessing 
techniques    As  shown  by  the  performance  of  each  tagging 
approach  Version  2  shows  a  drop  in  the  accuracy  with 
compared to other two  versions That indicates the approach 
followed  in  Version  2  in  guessing  parts  of  speech  for 
unknown words is not a reliable method for Sinhala language 
Version 3 shows 9150 of accuracy that shows considering 
the distinction between closed and open class in guessing part 
of  speech  for  unknown  words  is  proved  to  be  useful  and  an 
effective way for Sinhala language  
Fig  IV  presents  the  confusion  matrix  which  summarized 
the  performance  of  Version  3  of  the  tagger      where  row 
labels indicate the correct tags and column labels indicate the 
tags  predicted  by  the  system  In  this  confusion  matrix  all 
correct  predictions  are  located  in  the  diagonal  of  the  table 
Most of the deviations are shown in predicting tags for words 
belong to Common Noun Neuter category

However  the  overall  accuracy  of  the  tagger  have  shown 
that the distinction between closed class and open class word 
category is a power full tool in handling unknown  words for 
Sinhala  language  But  the  tagging  accuracy  is  still  close  to 
92 and that shows more work need to be carried out to fine 
tune  the  accuracy  of  the  tagger  So  improvement  can  be 
suggested  to  the  tagger  in  handling  unknown  words  Mainly 
morphological  recognition  can  also  be  helpful  in  predicting 
possible  parts  of  speech  for  many  unknown  words  So  the 
overall performance of the tagger can be improved by using a 
hybrid  approach  with  incurring  above  knowledge  to  the 
system by set of hand written rules Further to make sure this 
approach  more  accurate  the  output  generated  by  the  system 
need  to  be  manually  verified  and  retraining  the  tagger  to 
make  sure  if  the  word  encountered  again  later  that  word 
would get properly tagged 
and  syntactic  knowledge  are  reliable  sources  of  information 
for  handling  unknown  words  in  part  of  speech  tagging  of 
Sinhala language  
Though  this  research  proposed  a  reliable  approach  to 
handle  unknown  words 
further 
enhancements  are  required  to  improve  and  optimize  the 
algorithm  Hence  several  directions  are  suggested  here  for 
future work

Abstract Part of Speech POS is a very vital topic in Natural 
Language  Processing  NLP  task  in  any  language  which 
involves  analysing  the  construction  of  the  language  behaviours 
and the  dynamics of  the language the  knowledge  that could  be 
utilized  in  computational  linguistics  analysis  and  automation 
applications  In  this  context  dealing  with  unknown  words 
words do not appear in the lexicon referred as unknown words 
is  also  an  important  task  since  growing  NLP  systems  are  used 
in  more  and  more  new  applications  One  aid  of  predicting 
lexical  categories  of  unknown  words  is  the  use  of  syntactical 
knowledge of the language   The  distinction  between open class 
words and closed class words together with  syntactical features 
of the language used in this research to predict lexical categories 
of  unknown  words  in  the  tagging  process  An  experiment  is 
performed  to  investigate  the  ability  of  the  approach  to  parse 
unknown  words  using  syntactical  knowledge  without  human 
intervention This experiment shows that the performance of the 
tagging process is enhanced when word class distinction is used 
together  with  syntactic  rules  to  parse  sentences  containing 
unknown words in Sinhala language

I  INTRODUCTION 
Part  of  speech  tagging  is  one  of  the  pivotal  steps  in  the 
knowledge  acquiring  process  in  natural  language  processing 
task  The  fundamental  processing  step  in  tagging  consists  of 
assigning  POS  tags  to  every  token  in  the  text  with  a 
corresponding  POS  tag  like  noun  verb  preposition  etc 
based  both  on  its  definition  as  well  as  its  context 
Appearance of an unknown is the one of the problems that is 
facing  in  natural  language  parsing  systems  ie  the  words 
that  appear  in  sentences  but  are  not  contained  within  the 
lexicon  New  words  are  continually  coined  to  the  language 
and  people  will  often  use  words  is  parsing  that  the  system 
may  not expect This problem get  worse  when NLP systems 
are used for more and more on-line computer applications  
This  paper  will  discuss  how  well  a  distinction  of  Sinhala 
word classes syntactic rules can be used in parsing sentences 
containing  unknown  words  in  natural  language  processing 
tasks  The  distinction  between  closed  class  and  open  class 
words  should  help  to  refine  the  possibilities  for  unknown 
words  then  syntactic  knowledge  can  be  used  to  aid  in  the 
analysis of unknown words sentence structure which can be 
a  strong  evidence  for  the  possible  part  of  speech  of  an 
unknown word We expect that these two knowledge sources 
will  greatly  improve  tagging  ability  to  process  and  handle 
with words that are not in the system corpus 
this  paper  we  presents 
importance  of  handling 
unknown  word  in  part  of  speech  tagging  process  and  an 
approach  is suggested Section II of  this paper gives an  idea 
of  the  background  of  the  problem  and  details  of  previous 
research    Section  III  describes  distinction  of  open  class  and 
closed class words in Sinhala language and section IV gives 
details  of  morphological  and  syntactical  analysis  of  the 
current  text  corpus  Section  V  discusses  about  the  approach 
that  we  have  proposed  for  guessing  parts  of  speech  for 
unknown words  Section VI and VII discuss the Evaluation 
testing  and  the  results  and  section  VIII  concludes  the  paper 
and describes the future work 
II  BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM  OF UNKNOWN WORDS 
Appearance  of  unknown  words  is  one  of  the  frequently 
occurring problems facing in part of speech tagging process 
ie the words that appear in sentences but are not contained 
within  the  training  corpus  New  words  are  continually 
entering  the  language  Acronyms  and  proper  names  are 
created very often and new nouns and verbs are adding to the 
language  in  a  surprising  rate  So  it  is  impossible  to  train  the 
tagger for every possible word in the language So unknown 
words are non-negligible in POS tagging Therefore in order 
to build a complete tagger tagger must be incurred with some 
knowledge of suggesting the tag for an unknown word  
There  are  two  approaches  to handle  unknown  words  The 
first  approach  is  to  attempt  to  construct  a  complete  lexicon 
then deal with unknown words in a simple way For example 
rejecting  the  input  The  second  approach  is  to  attempt  to 
analyse the word at the time of encounter with using a set of 
human defined rules This would allow the tagger to process 
sentences containing unknown words  
Before  examining  the  problem  in  detail  it  is  useful  to 
consider  work 
that  has  already  been  done  by  other 
researchers  There  have  been  several  attempts  to  study  the 
problem  of  learning  unknown  words  These  attempts  have 
followed  several  different  methodologies  and  have  focused 
on various aspects of the unknown words 
Previous  techniques  reported  for  other  languages  such  as 
English have mostly utilize the guessing rules to analyse the 
word  features  by  looking  at  leading  and  trailing  characters 
Most  of  them  employ  the  analysis  of  trailing  characters  and 
other  features  such  as  capitalization  and  hyphenation  Some 
of  them  use  more  morphologically  oriented  word  features 
such  as  suffixes  prefixes  and  character  lengths  The 
guessing  rules  are  usually  use  knowledge  of  morphology  of 
the language  
The  simple  possible  way  that  suggested  2  is  to  consider 
each  unknown  word  that  is  ambiguous  among  all  possible 
tags  with equal probability and then  using contextual POS-
trigram from the corpus to suggest the proper tag  
There  are  more  complex  methods  which  have  been  tried 
out  by  other  researchers  for  dealing  with  unknown  words 
using morphological and syntactical features of the language 
Eric  Brill  3  make  use  of  morphology  to  handle  unknown 
words  during  part  of  speech  tagging  process  Brills  tagger 
begins  by  tagging  unknown  words  as  proper  noun  if 
capitalized  as  common  noun  if  not  Then  the  tagger  learns 
various transformational rules in the training process from the 
tagged corpus Then it applies these rules to unknown words 
to tag with the appropriate parts of speech category Scott M 
Thede  and  Mary  Harper  5  in  their  paper  presented  an 
approach  using  morphology  and  syntactic  parsing  rules  in 
post-mortem  method  for  determining  the  probable  lexical 
classes of words Tetsuji Taku Kudoh and Yuji 6 proposed 
a  POS  tagging  approach  for  unknown  English  words  using 
Support  Vector  Machines  SVM  SVM  classifiers  are 
created  for  each  POS  tag  using  all  words  in  the  training  set 
then  POS  tags  to  unknown  words  predict  using  those 
classifiers 
But  an  agglutinative  language  presents  more  serious 
problems  with  unknown  words  unlike  English  Gary 
Jeongwon Jong-Hyeok 4 have proposed a syllable-pattern-
based  generalized  unknown-morpheme  estimation  method 
using  a  morpheme  pattern  dictionary  in  their  statistical  and 
rule-based hybrid POS tagging system for Korean language 
Since Sinhala is also a complex morphologically rich and 
agglutinative  language  information  about  morphology  or 
how word is spelled is very difficult to use in unknown word 
prediction algorithms  
III OPEN CLASS VS CLOSED CLASS WORDS 
Traditionally 
the  definition  of  POS 
is  based  on 
morphological  and  syntactic  functions  Similar  to  most  of 
other languages POS in Sinhala language also can be divided 
into  two  broad  categories  closed  class  type  and  open  class 
type  Closed  classes  are  those  that  have  relatively  fixed 
membership  Closed  class  words  are  generally  function 
words  which  tend  to  be  very  short  occur  frequently  and 
play an important role in grammar  By contrast open class is 
the  type  that  lager  number  of  words  are  belong  in  any 
language and new words are continually coined or borrowed 
from  other  languages  The  words  that  are  usually  containing 
main  content  of  a  sentence  are  belonged  to  open  word  class 
category 
In Sinhala all  Nouns and Verbs can be categorized under 
open  word  class  But  Nipatha  and  Upasarga  behave 
differently in Sinhala grammar Words belong to Nipatha and 
Upasarga  are  not  changed  according  to  time  and  gender 
Upasarga  always  join  with  nouns  and  provide  additional 
improved meaning to the noun therefore Upasarga are not 
categorized  under  any  of  word  class  but  Nipatha  can  be 
categorized as closed class words based on their existence 
In-addition  to  that  Sinhala  Pronouns  can  be  classified  as 
open  class  words  based  on  their  morphological  properties 
but  Pronouns  also  can  be  classified  as  closed  class  words 
based on their existence of fixed membership in the language  
IV ANALYSIS OF MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTICAL 
NLP based language analysis mainly aid by morphological 
and  syntactical  features  analysis  of  a  language  and  the 
availability  of  lexical  resources  is  essential  in  this  tasks  So 
having  a  corpus  for  a  language  is  an  important  lexical 
resource  in  the  field  of  NLP  In  order  to  make  the  corpora 
more useful for doing linguistic research they are required to 
annotate  with  respective  knowledge  sources  to  make  it 
suitable to process with linguistics applications One example 
of  annotating  a  corpus  is  part  of  speech  tagging  in  which 
information  about  each  words  part  of  speech  verb  noun 
adjective etc is added to the corpus in the form of tags 
the  Corpus  developed  by 
The corpus that we use in this research is the beta version 
the  UCSC  under  PAN 
Localization project in 2005 7 which contains around 2754 
sentences and 90551 words tagged with corresponding part of 
speech tag that comprise of data drawn from different kinds 
of  Sinhala  newspaper  articles  under  different  classifications 
mainly form Art Sports Science Indigenous knowledge and 
Religion  
We  performed  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  corpus  to 
understand what rules govern the language and what patterns 
occur  Empirical  results  of  the  analysis  is  described  in  this 
paper  in  detail  A  substantial  effort  was  made  at  the  corpus 
preparation  phase  to  correct  issues  encountered  in  the 
formatting of the text in the corpus   
 In order to further analysis of the corpus word frequency 
distribution and the tag frequency distribution  were obtained 
from  the  corpus  by  running  a  simple  tokenizing  program 
Tags  with 
tokens 
numbers  foreign  words  etc  were  removed  from  the  list 
after manual inspection 
typographical  errors  and 
irrelevant 
A  Most Frequent Words in Sinhala Text Corpus 
This analysis was performed to observe the words and Part 
of  Speech  categories  that  are  more  frequent  in  Sinhala  text 
corpus  In  order  to  observe  most  frequent  words  a  distinct 
word  list  with  frequencies  were  obtained  from  the  corpus 
along  with  possible  part  of  speech  tags  For  simplicity  only 
top  20  words  were  considered  in  the  analysis  Table  I 
contains the list of words with frequencies and possible part 
of speech categories 
It  is  observed  that  most  frequent  words  in  Sinhala 
language  are  function  words  which  belong  to  closed  class 
category 11 out of 20 words belong to Nipatha which all are 
function words 6 frequent verbs are also within the list It is 
also  observed  that  tagging  ambiguity  exists  among  high 
frequent  words  though  they  are  function  words  There  are 
two words among top 20 words  and  that are not 
properly classified into respective parts of speech categories  
B  Zipfs Law Analysis 
Zipfs  Law  states  that  the  frequency  of  occurrence  of  an 
instance  of  a  class  is  roughly  inversely  proportional  to  the 
rank  of  that  class  in  the  frequency  list  for  example 
occurrences of  words in a document So the goal of this test 
was  to  observe  parts  of  speech  distribution  within  Sinhala 
language displays the Zipfs Law behavior 
Suppose  that a  word occurs f times and that in the list of 
word  frequencies  it  has  a  certain  rank  r  if  Zipfs  Law  holds 
we have for all words f  arb where a and b are constants 
and b is close to  minus 1 -1 Taking the logarithm of each 
side of the equation we get

we  can  observe  that  the  tag  frequencies  are  roughly  form  a 
line from the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner of the

According to Fig II NNN Common Noun Neuter seems 
to  be  the  most  frequent  tag  in  the  corpus  and  it  seems  to 
appear  about  three  times  more  frequently  than  VP  Verb 
Participle It is also noticed that more than 50 of words are 
noun  in  the  corpus  around  10  belongs  to  verbsverbal 
parses  So  in  general  we  can  say  around  60  of  words  in 
Sinhala language are belong to open class type while around 
40 of words belongs to the closed class type 
D  Words distribution by Tag 
The objective of this test is to analyze what type of words 
are exist mostly in Sinhala language  Fig III is plotted based 
on  data  presented  in  Table  III  which  shows  the  distribution 
of  number  of  distinct  words  by  POS  category  in  the  corpus  
It is observed that most of the words in Sinhala language are 
nouns which is 13047 words are nouns out of total of 18957 
distinct words in the corpus that is almost around 68 of the 
total number of words in the corpus   
Fig III Plot of word distribution by Tag  
V  GUESSING PART OF SPEECH FOR UNKNOWN WORDS 
Tagging data with unknown words is also an essential task 
in the tagger When the system reach  an unknown  word the 
initial  version  of  the  tagger  doesnt  cater  unknown  words 
thus  tagger  fails  to  propose  a  tag  since  the  system  is  not 
trained for that word and the tagging algorithm doesnt have 
enough intelligence to propose tags for untrained words  
language 
in  which 
Since  Sinhala  is  a  complex  morphologically  rich  and 
agglutinative 
information  about 
morphology  or  how  word  spelled  is  very  difficult  to  use  in 
unknown  word  prediction  algorithms  unlike  English    So  in 
our  research  the  important  source  of  information  that  we 
have  used  the  distribution  of  words  and  parts  of  speech  So 
improvements  of  the  algorithm  focused  on  words  belong  to 
sub  categories  of  open  class  words  such  as  noun  verbs  and 
pronouns  Due  to  fixed  number  of  membership  in  closed 
class word category we can assume that the words belong to 
closed  class  category  are  well  defined  in  Sinhala  grammar 
and  that  is  fixed  Hence  improvement  could  be  done  by 
incurring  knowledge  of  distinction  between  closed  class  and 
open class words Syntactic knowledge can be used to aid in 
the  analysis  of  unknown  words  sentence  structure  Then 
suggest  corresponding  part  of  speech  and  calculate  the 
trigram  using  Hidden  Markov  Model  HMM  for  unknown 
words 
Considering the fact that the tag likelihood distribution and 
the  word  frequency  distribution  of  the  language  it  is  clear 
that NNN is the most frequent part of speech in the language 
The  NNN  tag  likelihood  is  the  highest  likelihood  and  it  is  3 
times  greater  than  VP    By  considering  word  frequency 
distribution by tags in Fig III provide evidence that the most 
of  the  words  in  the  language  are  NNNs  which  is  5  times 
more  than  NNPI  Based  on  above  two  factors  the  simplest 
way  that  could  handle  unknown  words  we  can  assume  and 
guess  NNN  as  part  of  speech  tag  for  each  new  word 
encountered in the tagging process 
  More  advanced  approach  of  guessing  parts  of  speech  is 
the consideration of the distinction between closed class and 
open  class  words  This  distinction  can  simplified  the 
unknown  prediction  algorithm  by  distinguishing 
syntactical  categories  into  separate  groups  that  can  greatly 
simplify the task of processing unknown words in a sentence  
Closed class parts of  speech  are those that  have relatively 
fixed membership in the language and that may not normally 
be assigned to new words Closed class words are words with 
a  closed  class  part  of  speech  For  example  words  belong  to 
Nipatha in Sinhala language are the member of closed class 
which  has  fixed  membership  in  the  language  it  is  very  rare 
that  a  new  Conjunctions  CC  Determiners  DET  or 
Postpositions  POST  are  added  to  the  language  In  addition 
to that words belong to Pronoun PRP are also considered as 
fixed in its existence in the language and new Pronouns are 
very  rarely  created  So  Pronouns  are  also  considered  as 
closed  class  parts  of  speech  in  this  research  Table  IV 
contains  a  list  of  parts  of  speech  tags  that  are  considered  as 
closed class categories in this research and will be avoided in 
guessing for unknown words 
Based  on  morphological  and  syntactical  features  of 
Sinhala  language  open  class  words  are  comprised  of  words 
with  the  following  parts  of  speech  nouns  verbs  Noun  in 
Kriya  Mula  and  Adjective  in  Kriya  Mula  Adjectives 
adverbs  and  Verb  Participle  are  also  considered  under  this 
classification in this research Table V contains the complete 
list of parts of speech tags considered as open class category 
since those words are syntactically used to modify nouns and 
verbs

this  research  we  assume 
that  each  new  word 
encountered in the part of speech tagging process of Sinhala 
language  belong  to  open  word  class  category  hence  the 
unknown  word  algorithm  is  to  pretend  that  each  unknown 
word is ambiguous among all open class part of speech tags 
with  equal  probability  Then  the  tagger  computes  the  tag 
sequence  probability  and  maximum  likelihood  probabilities 
rely  on  text  corpus  and  suggest  the  proper  tag    Further 
foreign  words  and  numerals  were  handled  separately  since 
they do not form any syntactical relationship  with other part 
of speech categories in the language 
VI EVALUATION 
The  evaluation  of  the  system  was  mainly  driven  by 
training  the  system  using  the  Sinhala  text  corpus  that 
comprised of 2754 sentences and 90551 words in which data 
drown from Sinhala newspaper articles from various genres  
For  the  test  data  set  data  were  carefully  selected  aiming 
for testing three different versions of the tagger The first set 
was collected from the training corpus aiming to test Version 
1  of  the  tagger  that  comprised  of  621  words  only  known  to 
the  system  and  36  sentences  The  second  test  set  was  also 
collected aiming to test Version 2 and 3 of the tagger which 
data  were  drown  from  Sinhala  text  corpus  outside  from  the 
trained  data  set  The  second  test  set  comprised  of  51 
sentences  1024  words  Out  of  1024  words  171  words  were 
unknown  to  the  system  To  evaluate  the  performance  of  the 
tagger two gold standard test sets were created

The tagger evaluated by comparing the tagged output with 
the Gold standard test set  The accuracy was calculated using 
number  of  correct  tags  proposed  by  the  system  and  total 
number of words in the sentences by the following formula 
RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
The  performance  of  the  tagger  was  measured  using  three 
different  versions  of  progressively  upgraded 
tagging 
mechanisms Version 1 is the simplest form of the tagger that 
performs  well  only  with  known  words  that  rejects  all 
unknown words as tagging failures Version 2 is a somewhat 
upgraded version that treats all unknown words as nouns and 
suggest  NNN  to  each  new  word  encountered  in  the  tagging 
process  Version  3  is  the  full  version  of  the  tagger  that  uses 
statistical  technique  to  guess  the  best  tag  for  unknown  word 
by considering the context of surrounding words  
  Table VI shows our systems performance for these three 
different versions of tagging mechanisms and the experiment 
verifies  the  effectiveness  of  our  unknown  word  guessing 
techniques    As  shown  by  the  performance  of  each  tagging 
approach  Version  2  shows  a  drop  in  the  accuracy  with 
compared to other two  versions That indicates the approach 
followed  in  Version  2  in  guessing  parts  of  speech  for 
unknown words is not a reliable method for Sinhala language 
Version 3 shows 9150 of accuracy that shows considering 
the distinction between closed and open class in guessing part 
of  speech  for  unknown  words  is  proved  to  be  useful  and  an 
effective way for Sinhala language  
Fig  IV  presents  the  confusion  matrix  which  summarized 
the  performance  of  Version  3  of  the  tagger      where  row 
labels indicate the correct tags and column labels indicate the 
tags  predicted  by  the  system  In  this  confusion  matrix  all 
correct  predictions  are  located  in  the  diagonal  of  the  table 
Most of the deviations are shown in predicting tags for words 
belong to Common Noun Neuter category

Version 3 
However  the  overall  accuracy  of  the  tagger  have  shown 
that the distinction between closed class and open class word 
category is a power full tool in handling unknown  words for 
Sinhala  language  But  the  tagging  accuracy  is  still  close  to 
92 and that shows more work need to be carried out to fine 
tune  the  accuracy  of  the  tagger  So  improvement  can  be 
suggested  to  the  tagger  in  handling  unknown  words  Mainly 
morphological  recognition  can  also  be  helpful  in  predicting 
possible  parts  of  speech  for  many  unknown  words  So  the 
overall performance of the tagger can be improved by using a 
hybrid  approach  with  incurring  above  knowledge  to  the 
system by set of hand written rules Further to make sure this 
approach  more  accurate  the  output  generated  by  the  system 
need  to  be  manually  verified  and  retraining  the  tagger  to 
make  sure  if  the  word  encountered  again  later  that  word 
would get properly tagged 
and  syntactic  knowledge  are  reliable  sources  of  information 
for  handling  unknown  words  in  part  of  speech  tagging  of 
Sinhala language  
Though  this  research  proposed  a  reliable  approach  to 
handle  unknown  words 
further 
enhancements  are  required  to  improve  and  optimize  the 
algorithm  Hence  several  directions  are  suggested  here  for 
future work 
in  POS 
tagging 
  Language  specific  morphological  features  can  be 
helpful in predicting possible parts of speech for most 
of the verbs 
Incorporation of named entity recognition techniques   
information  about  identifying  named  entity  could  be 
possible clue in predicting parts of speech for most of 
the nouns 
Instead  of  using  only  HMM  following  a  hybrid 
approach with incurring above key knowledge to the 
system by a set of hand written rules 
Increasing  the  size  of  the  corpus  and  accuracy  of 
tagged data

In this paper  we have  described two types of  methods for 
dealing  with  unknown  words  in  POS  tagging  Sinhala 
language The application of the methods in Hidden Markov 
Model based part of speech tagging approach which we have 
previously  developed  1  was  evaluated  and  results  were 
presented  The  implementation  was  tested  against  90551 
words 2754 sentences of Sinhala text corpus and that showed 
915 accuracy in the tagging process with predicting tags to 
unknown words So that the performance of the tagger prove 
that  distinction  between  closed  class  and  open  class  words
