Abstract Advances in extragalactic astronomy have prompted the development of
increasingly realistic models which aim to describe the formation and evolution of
galaxies We review the philosophy behind one such technique called semi-analytic
modelling and explain the relation between this approach and direct simulations of
gas dynamics Finally we present model predictions for the evolution of the stellar
mass of galaxies in a universe in which structure formation is hierarchical
1 Modelling the formation and evolution of galaxies
An incredibly wide range of physical processes are believed to be inuential
in the formation of galaxies Some of these processes are well understood for
example the build up of dark matter haloes through mergers or the accretion of
smaller units the formation of haloes has been studied extensively using N-body
simulations and can be described analytically with a reasonable degree of success
eg Lacey  Cole 1993 1994 On the other hand we are still some distance
away from being able to simulate the formation of stars An impressive initial
step in this direction has been taken by Abel et al  2002 with a simulation that
leads up to the formation of the rst star in the universe However the conditions
in this calculation are much simpler than would be typical for the formation
of the bulk of the stars in the universe and the simulation is stopped once
additional physics not currently included in the calculation such as radiative
transfer become important
The absence of a complete theory of star formation need not be an obstacle
to the development of a theory of galaxy formation One can take a phenomeno-
logical approach in which a physically motivated recipe is adopted to describe
star formation within a galaxy The recipe will inevitably contain one or more
uncertain parameters but these can be xed by comparing model predictions
with observational data
Adopting this pragmatic approach two techniques have been developed to
model the formation and evolution of galaxies The rst of these is the direct
simulation of gravitational instability and gas dynamics The second class of
technique is semi-analytic modelling Kaumann et al  1993 Cole et al  1994
In such models the merger trees of dark matter haloes can either be grown
using a Monte-Carlo algorithm or they can be extracted from an N-body simu-
lation The gas physics namely shock heating radiative cooling star formation
Baugh et al
and supernova feedback along with galaxy mergers is followed using approxi-
mations and simple rules
The two techniques have complementary pros and cons Direct simulations do
not require the specialised assumptions that are necessary in the semi-analytic
models eg the imposition of spherical symmetry in the calculation of the gas
cooling time On the other hand semi-analytic models are fast and exible
allowing a wide range of parameter space to be explored The modular structure
of the semi-analytic models means that new prescriptions for processes such as
star formation can be readily evaluated
In certain respects the two techniques are actually very similar The direct
simulation approach necessarily breaks down at some level because of the nite
resolution that is attainable It is not possible to achieve the sub-parsec resolution
needed to simulate star formation in a cosmologically representative volume
Coupled with the lack of knowledge of the relevant micro-physics this means
that recipes like those used in the semi-analytic models have to be deployed in
order to produce a fully specied model
The rst comparisons of the two techniques have recently been carried out
Benson et al  2001a Helly et al  2002  Yoshida et al  2002 These studies con-
sidered the rate at which gas cools in SPH simulations and in stripped-down
semi-analytic models in which star formation and feedback have been switched
o The two approaches are in remarkably good agreement which inspires con-
dence in the cooling model adopted in the semi-analytic schemes
2 Constructing a model
In the phenomenological approach to galaxy formation the values of the param-
eters in the recipes that describe processes such as star formation and feedback
have to be specied to produce model predictions This task is performed by
comparing the model predictions to a subset of the available observational data
Dierent groups of modellers have dierent priorities when attempting to repro-
duce the data The Munich group for example has attached most importance
to matching the slope and zero point of Tully  Fishers 1977 correlation be-
tween the luminosity and rotation speed of disk dominated galaxies The Durham
group instead try hardest to match the form of the present day galaxy luminos-
ity function The luminosity function is the most basic description of the galaxy
population and is now known to a high level of accuracy in the optical from the
2dFGRS Norberg et al  2002 and SDSS Blanton et al  2000 and in the near-
infrared from 2MASS photometry Cole et al  2001 Kochanek et al  2001 The
predictions of the ducial model of Cole et al  2000 are compared with these
recent estimates of the local luminosity function in Fig 1
Although most weight is given to reproducing the luminosity function when
setting model parameters matching other datasets such as the Tully-Fisher
relation the distribution of disk scale lengths the metallicity of gas in spiral disks
and of stars in ellipticals and the gas fraction in spiral disks is also important
This greatly restricts the viable range of parameter space of the models
The evolution of galaxy mass
Fig 1 The local galaxy luminosity function in the bJ - and KS- bands The predictions
of the ducial model from Cole et al  2000 are shown by the solid line in each panel
In the left panel the symbols shows an estimate of the luminosity function from the
2dFGRS Norberg et al  2002 The shaded region shows an estimate based on the anal-
ysis of SDSS data in Blanton et al  2000 see Norberg et al  2002 for full details In
the right panel a combination of 2dFGRS redshifts and 2MASS photometry was used
to estimate the near infrared luminosity function Cole et al  2001 The shaded region
shows another observational estimate which also uses 2MASS photometry Kochanek
et al  2001
One criticism levelled at semi-analytic models that has entered into popular
folklore is the inability of the models to match the zeropoint of the Tully-Fisher
relation at the same time as reproducing the break in the luminosity function
at L The Tully-Fisher relation of the ducial model of Cole et al  is compared
with the observed relation in Fig 2 The solid line shows the model prediction
when the rotation speed at the half-mass radius of the disk is plotted the dashed
line shows how the zeropoint shifts when the rotation speed of the halo at the
virial radius is plotted instead which is much closer to the observed zeropoint
The shift is around 20 - 30 which is comparable to the accuracy one might
expect in the calculation of the rotation speed at the half-mass radius This
depends upon several eects such as the self gravity of the baryons and their
gravitational inuence on the halo dark matter

from the sample of Mathewson Ford  Buchhorn 1992 The dashed line shows the
model prediction for the Tully-Fisher relation when the rotation speed of the halo at
the virial radius is plotted The solid line shows the predictions when the rotation speed
at the half mass radius is plotted instead
3 Model predictions - an example
Now that we have arrived at a fully specied model by comparing the output
against a subset of the observations to x the model parameters we can make
predictions for other quantities Benson et al  2000ab 2001b populated a high
resolution N-body simulation with galaxies using the semi-analytic model of Cole
et al   The simulation gives the spatial distribution of galaxies and allows their
clustering to be measured Remarkably without any further adjustment to the
model parameters Benson et al  found that the ducial CDM model of Cole
et al  predicts a correlation function that is in extremely good agreement with
that measured for APM galaxies Baugh 1996 This is particularly noteworthy
as the galaxy correlation function is close to a power law whereas the correlation
function of the dark matter shows considerable curvature

measured correlation function r  r0r  plotted as a function of luminosity The
solid line shows the model predictions taken from Benson et al  2001b The dotted
lines show the Poisson errors derived from the pair counts The symbols show the sub-
sequent measurements made from the 2dFGRS Norberg et al  2001 In this case the
errors are estimated from mock 2dFGRS catalogues constructed from N-body simula-
tions and include sample variance
Benson et al  2000b 2001 presented predictions for the dependence of clus-
tering strength on luminosity in the same model and found an approximately
linear dependence of correlation length on luminosity galaxies six times more
luminous than L have a correlation length 50 longer than that predicted for
L galaxies At the time the picture emerging from the data was unclear This
has now been resolved by measurements from the 2dFGRS Norberg et al  2001
and SDSS Zehavi et al  2002 which are in reasonable agreement with the trend
predicted by the semi-analytic models
4 The evolution of the stellar mass of galaxies
Advances in detectors that operate in the near infrared have led to a huge in-
crease in the size of K selected samples over the past decade The rst direct
estimate of the K-band luminosity function from a K-selected sample used  500
galaxies Gardner et al  1997 the estimate of the KS-band luminosity function
Baugh et al
Fig 4 Top The evolution of the stellar mass function with redshift The lines show the
model predictions at dierent redshifts as indicated by the key The datapoints show
the present day stellar mass function inferred from the KS-band luminosity function by
Cole et al  2001 Bottom The evolution with redshift of the observer frame KS-band
luminosity function The symbols and shaded region show the present day KS-band
luminosity function estimated with 2MASS photometry
The evolution of galaxy mass
by Cole et al  2001 using 2MASS photometry and 2dFGRS redshifts was made
from over 17000 galaxies The K-band luminosity of a galaxy gives a reasonable
indication of its stellar mass The output from the semi-analytic model suggests
that the scatter in the stellar massK-band magnitude relation is a factor of
 2 showing the relative insensitivity to star formation history
It is important to make a fair comparison between observational estimates
and theoretical predictions for stellar mass The stellar mass inferred from the
K-band light is sensitive to the choice of IMF Also one needs to be clear
whether recycling of gas is included ie whether the quantity under consideration
is the mass locked up in stars or the total mass that had been turned into stars
some of which is subsequently expelled in stellar winds and supernovae Cole
et al  2001 estimated the stellar mass function from the KS-band luminosity
function shown by the symbols in Fig 4 and found that only a small fraction
of the baryons in the universe perhaps as little as 5 is actually locked up in
stars Similar results were obtained by Kochanek et al  2001
We plot the evolution of the stellar mass function in Fig 4 There is a steady
increase in the typical stellar mass with time the value of M increases by a
factor of  2 between z  1 and the present The observable counterpart to the
stellar mass function the observer frame K band luminosity function shows
more complex evolution Fig 5 This is due to band shifting
Summary We have given an outline of the semi-analytic approach to mod-
elling galaxy formation This technique is complementary to direct simulation of
the relevant gas dynamic processes In fact both methods rely upon physically
motivated recipes to deal with star formation and feedback The model predicts
strong evolution in the mass of stellar systems with more than an order of mag-
nitude increase in the abundance of 1011h2M systems between z  1 and
the present day Constraints on these predictions are now beginning to emerge
with the advent of the rst results from deep near-infrared photometry see

et al  to this volume
