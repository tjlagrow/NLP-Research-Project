Abstract
The basic principles underlying galactic chemical evolution and the most important results of
chemical evolution models are discussed In particular the chemical evolution of the Milky
Way galaxy for which we possess the majority of observational constraints is described
Then it is shown how different star formation histories inuence the chemical evolution
of galaxies of different morphological type Finally the role of abundances and abundance
ratios as cosmic clocks is emphasized and a comparison between model predictions and
abundance patterns in high redshift objects is used to infer the nature and the age of these
systems
Introduction
In order to build a chemical evolution model one needs to specify some basic pa-
rameters such as the boundary conditions namely whether the system is closed or open
and whether the gas is primordial or already chemically enriched Then the stellar birthate
function which is generally expressed as the product of two independent functions the star
formation rate SFR and the initial mass function IMF namely
Bmt  tm
where the SFR is assumed to be only a function of time and the IMF only a function of the
stellar mass The stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis are also necessary ingredients for
modelling chemical evolution and in particular we need to specify the stellar yields pim
Then one can include in the chemical evolution model some supplementary ingredients
such as the the infall of extragalactic material radial ows and galactic winds which can
play a more or less important role depending on the galactic system under study In par-
ticular gas infall and radial ows can be important in describing the chemical evolution of
spiral disks whereas galactic outows are probably important in elliptical galaxies where
the SFR was very high in the past and there is no cold gas at the present time as well as
in dwarf galaxies which possess a smaller potential well In fact galactic outows which
eventually can transform into galactic winds are determined by two main processes the
supernova feedback namely how much energy is transferred from SNe into the interstellar
medium ISM and the galactic potential well
F Matteucci
In this paper I will recall the most popular approximations used to describe both the
basic and the supplementary ingredients involved in galactic chemical evolution Then I
will describe detailed numerical models which can follow the evolution in space and time
of the abundances of the most abundant chemical species I will show some applications of
such models to the Milky Way galaxy and then to galaxies of different morphological type
focussing on the fact that abundances and abundance ratios are very useful tools to infer the
history of star formation in galaxies to impose constraints on the stellar nucleosynthesis and
to derive information on the nature and the age of high redshift objects
The star formation rate
The SFR is one of the most important drivers of galactic chemical evolution it
describes the rate at which the gas is turned into stars in galaxies Since the physics of the
star formation process is still not well known several parametrizations are used to describe
the SFR A common aspect to the different formulations of the SFR is that they include a
dependence upon the gas density Here I recall the most commonly used parametrizations
for the SFR adopted so far in the literature
An exponentially decreasing SFR provides an easy to handle formula
SFR  e- t
with   5- 15 Gyr in order to obtain a good t to the properties of the solar neighbourhhood
Tosi 1988 and   1 - 2Gyr- 1 being the so-called efciency of star formation which is
expressed as the inverse of the timescale of star formation
However the most famous formulation and most widely adopted for the SFR is the
Schmidt 1955 law
SFR  k
which assumes that the SFR is proportional to some power of the volume or surface gas
density The exponent suggested by Schmidt was k  2 but Kennicutt 1998 suggested that
the best t to the observational data on spiral disks and starburst galaxies is obtained with an
exponent k  14  015
A more complex formulation including a dependence also from the total surface mass
density which is induced by the SN feedback was suggested by the observations of Dopita
 Ryder 1994 who proposed the following formulation
SFR  k1
totk2
with 15  k1  k2  25
Kennicutt suggested also an alternative law to the Schmidt-like one discussed above in
particular a law containing the angular rotation speed of gas gas
SFR  0017gasgas  R- 1gas
A similar law for the SFR taking into account star formation induced by spiral density
waves was proposed by Wyse  Silk 1989 and it can be expressed as Prantzos 2002
SFR  V RR- 115
F Matteucci
where V R is the rotational velocity in the disk and R is the galactocentric distance It is
worth noting that the SFRs expressed by eqs 14 15 and 16 contain a stronger depen-
dence on the radial properties of the disk than the simple Schmidt law and this characteristic
is required to best t the disk properties see next sections
The IMF
The most common parametrization for the IMF is that proposed by Salpeter 1955
which assumes a one-slope power law with x  135 in particular
M  cM- 1x
is the number of stars with masses in the interval M MdM and c is a normalization con-
The IMF is generally normalized as
MMdM  1
More recently multi-slope x1 x2 expressions of the IMF have been adopted since they
are better describing the luminosity function of the main sequence stars in the solar vicinity
Scalo 1986 1998 Kroupa et al 1993 Generally the IMF is assumed to be constant in
space and time with some exceptions such as the one suggested by Larson 1998 which
adopts a variable slope
x  1351  mm1- 1
where m1 is variable with time and associated to the Jeans mass The effects of a variable
IMF on the galactic disk properties have been studied by Chiappini et al
2000 who
concluded that only a very ad hoc variation of the IMF can reproduce the majority of
observational constraints thus favoring chemical evolution models with IMF constant in
space and time
Infall and outow
Depending on the galactic system the infall rate can be assumed to be constant in
space and time or more realistically the infall rate can be variable in space and time
IR  ARe- t R
with R constant or varying along the disk The parameter AR is derived by tting the
present time total surface mass density in the disk of the Galaxy tottG Otherwise for the
formation of the Galaxy one can assume two independent episodes of infall during which
the halo and perhaps part of the thick-disk formed rst and then the thin-disk respectively
IR  ARe- tHR  BRe- t- tmaxDR
as in the two-infall model of Chiappini et al
1997 Here H is the timescale for the
formation of the halothick disk and DR is the timescale for the formation of the thin-
disk This latter is assumed to increase linearly with galactocentric distance Matteucci 
Franois 1989 Chiappini et al 1997 Boissier  Prantzos 1999 For the rate of gas outow
or galactic wind there are no specic prescriptions but generally one simply assumes that the
F Matteucci
wind rate is proportional to the star formation rate through a suitable parameter Hartwick
1976 Matteucci  Chiosi 1983
W  - SFR
with  being a free parameter
Stellar Yields
The stellar yields are fundamental ingredients in galactic chemical evolution In
order to introduce the stellar yields we recall some useful concepts and dene the yield per
stellar generation
Under the assumption of Instantaneous Recycling Approximation IRA we dene the
yield per stellar generation of a given element i as Tinsley 1980
1 - RZ 
mpimmdm
where pim is the stellar yield of the element i namely the newly formed and ejected mass
fraction of the element i by a star of initial mass m It is worth noting that the expression
113 is an oversemplication and it does not have much meaning when considering chem-
ical elements formed on long timescales The quantity R is the returned fraction
R Z 
m - Mremmdm
where Mrem is the remnant mass of a star of mass m In the past ten years a large number
of calculations of the stellar yields pim has become available for stars of all masses and
metallicities However uncertainties in stellar yields are still present especially in the yields
of Fe-peak elements This is due to uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates treatment of
convection mass cut explosion energies neutron uxes and possible fall-back of matter on
the proto-neutron star Moreover the 14N nucleosynthesis and its primary andor secondary
nature are still under debate The most recent calculations are summarized below
 Low and Intermediate mass stars 08  MM  80 Marigo et al 1996 van den Hoeck
 Groenewegen 1997 Meynet  Maeder 2002 Ventura et al 2002 Siess et al 2002
These stars produce 4He C N and some s-process A  90 elements
 Massive stars M  10M Woosley  Weaver 1995 Langer  Henkel 1995 Thielemann
et al 1996 Nomoto et al 1997 Rauscher et al 2002 Limongi  Chief 2003
These stars produce mainly -elements O Ne Mg Si S Ca some Fe-peak elements
s-process elements A  90 and r-process elements
 Type Ia SNe Nomoto et al 1997 Iwamoto et al 1999 produce mainly Fe-peak elements
 Very massive objects M  100M if they exist should produce mostly oxygen Portinari
et al 1998 Umeda  Nomoto 2001 Nakamura et al 2001
In Figures 11 and 12 we show a comparison between the yields produced in massive stars
of two -elements O and Mg and Fe respectively as predicted by different authors As
is evident from Fig 11 the O yields from different sources seem to be in good agreement
with one another The yields of Mg especially the most recent ones seem to be also in good
agreement with each others whereas for the yields of Fe Figure 12 there is not yet an
agreement among different authors Observational estimates of Fe produced in type II SNe
Elmhamdi et al 2003 can help in constraining the Fe yields in massive stars

Analytical models of chemical evolution
The simplest model of galactic chemical evolution is the so-called Simple Model
for the evolution of the solar neighbourhood We dene the solar neighbourhood or solar
vicinity as a cylinder centered in the Sun with 1 kpc radius
The basic assumptions of the Simple Model can be summarized as follows
 the system is one-zone and closed no inows or outows
 the initial gas is primordial no metals
 the instantaneous recycling approximation holds IRA
 m is constant in time and space
 the gas is well mixed at any time IMA
Let Xi be the abundance of an element i and   Mgas
the ratio between the mass of gas
and the total mass of the system If Xi  1 which is generally true for metals then we can
Xi  yiln
which is the well known solution for the Simple Model where yi is the yield per stellar
generation as dened in eq 113 In particular the yield appearing in eq 115 is usually
referred to as the effective yield If Xi is not much lower than 1 as is the case for XHe Maeder
1992 a more precise expression for the solution of the Simple Model is given by
Xi  1 - yi
It is worth noting that generally in IRA we can assume

mann et al 1996 four-point stars Rauscher et al 2002
namely that the abundance ratios are equivalent to the yield ratios and this holds also in
analytical models with infall andor outow Clearly eq 117 can be used safely only for
elements produced on short timescales such as -elements but it fails if applied to elements
produced on long timescales such as Fe and N These days the Simple Model is rarely used
in describing the chemical evolution of the Milky Way since it does not reproduce the G-
dwarf metallicity distribution the G-dwarf problem as well as the elements produced on
long timescales such as Fe Matteucci 2001
Numerical models of chemical evolution
In the last years a great number of models relaxing IRA and the closed box as-
sumption but retaining the constancy of the IMF and the IMA have appeared in the litera-
ture As an example of the basic equations adopted in such models I show the formulation of
Matteucci  Greggio 1986 which is based on the original formulations of Talbot  Arnett
1971 and Chiosi 1980
Let Gi be the mass fraction of gas in the form of an element i itottG we can write
Git  - tXit Z MBm

f t - m2QmiXit - m2ddm 
F Matteucci
t - mQmiXit - mmdm

t - mQmiXit - mmdm  XAiIRt - XiW t
where A is a constant parameter chosen in order to t the present time SN Ia rate and it
lies in the range A005-009 The SNIa rate should be based on the existing theories on
SN Ia progenitors which I will summarize in the next section In the equations above the
type Ia SNe are assumed to originate from C-O white dwarfs WD in binary systems and
M1M2  see
f  represents the distribution of mass ratios in such binary systems  
Matteucci  Recchi 2001 for more details The star formation rate t and all the rates in
this equations are expressed as functions of the fraction of gas G  gas
tottG  The quantities
IRt and W t represent the rate of gas accretion and the rate of galactic outow wind
respectively and XAi are the abundances of the accreting material which are usually assumed
to be primordial no metals Generally in describing the solar neighbourhood and the
Galactic disk one assumes W t  0 whereas the infall of mostly primordial material is most
likely to be responsible for the formation of the disk
Type Ia SN progenitors
The single degenerate scenario is the classical scenario originally proposed by
Whelan and Iben 1973 namely C-deagration in a C-O WD reaching the Chandrasekhar
mass limit MCh  144M after accreting material from a red giant companion The pro-
genitors of C-O WDs lie in the range 08-80M therefore the most massive binary system
of two C-O WDs is the 8M 8 M one The clock of the system in this scenario is provided
by the lifetime of the secondary star ie the less massive one in the binary systemThis im-
plies that the minimum timescale for the appearence of the rst type Ia SNe is the lifetime
of the most massive secondary star In this case the time is tSNIamin003 Gyr Greggio and
Renzini 1983a Matteucci  Greggio 1986 Matteucci  Recchi 2001
The double degenerate scenario consists in the merging of two C-O WDs due to loss of
angular momentum occuring as a consequence of gravitational wave radiation which then
explode by C-deagration when the MCh is reached Iben and Tutukov 1984 In this case
the minimum timescale for the appearence of type Ia SNe is the lifetime of the most massive
secondary star plus the gravitational time delay which depends on the original separation
of the two WDs and which is computed according to Landau  Lifschitz 1962 namely
tSNIamin  003  tgrav003 015 Gyr Tornamb  Matteucci 1986 We recall that the
gravitational time delay can be as long as several Hubble times
The model by Hachisu et al 1999 is based on the classical scenario of Whelan 
Iben 1973 but with a metallicity effect implying that no type Ia systems can form for
FeH - 10dex in the ISM This implies a much longer time delay for the rst type Ia SNe
to occur also because the maximum masses of the secondary stars in the binary systems are
assumed to be  26M Therefore in this case tSNIamin  033 Gyr  metallicity delay due
to the chemical evolution of the considered system In this scenario type Ia SNe are not
associated with young stellar populations contrary to what is suggested by a recent search
for SNe Ia in starburst galaxies see Mannucci et al 2003 which seem to favor the scenario
where the progenitors of type Ia SNe can be as high as 8M
Clearly tSNIamin is a very important parameter for computing galactic chemical evolution
F Matteucci
since the abundance patterns will depend strongly on this timescale although the most im-
portant timescale is the one for which the type Ia SNe have an impact on the abundances
of the ISM In succesful models of galactic chemical evolution of the solar vicinity this
timescale is 10-15 Gyr in the framework of the single degenerate model Matteucci 
Greggio 1986 In the other two scenarios this time is longer especially in the one includ-
ing the metallicity effect and it varies with different histories of star formationsee Matteucci
 Recchi 2001 and sect 113
Different approaches to the formation and evolution of the Galaxy
In the past years several approaches to the calculation of the chemical evolution of
the Galaxy were proposed they are
i the serial formation where the halo thick and thin disk form in a sequence as a
continuous process eg Matteucci  Franois 1989
ii The parallel formation where the various Galactic components start forming at the
same time and from the same gas but evolve at different rates This approach predicts over-
lapping of stars belonging to the different components eg Pardi Ferrini  Matteucci
1995 but it does not provide a good t to the G-dwarf metallicity distribution and the halo
star metallicity distribution simultaneously as discussed in Matteucci 2001
iii The two-infall approach where the halo and disk form out of two separate infall
episodes from extragalactic gas Also in this case we predict an overlap in metallicity be-
tween the different galactic components eg Chiappini et al 1997 Chang et al 1999 A
threshold density th  7Mpc- 2 in the star formation process is also included in the model
of Chiappini et al 1997
iv The stochastic approach where the assumption is made that in the early halo phases
mixing was not efcient and pollution from single SNe would dominate the galactic enrich-
ment Tsujimoto et al 1999 Argast et al 2000 Oey 2000 In this case a large spread in
the abundances and abundance ratios at low metallicities is predicted This predicted spread
however is much larger than observed especially for -elements
Observational Constraints
A good model of chemical evolution should be able to reproduce a minimum num-
ber of observational constraints and the number of observational constraints should be larger
than the number of free parameters which are H D k1 k2  the IMF slopes and the
parameter describing the wind if adopted
The main observational constraints in the solar vicinity that a good model should repoduce
see Chiappini et al 2001 are
 The present time surface gas density G  13  3M pc- 2
 The present time surface star density   48  9M pc- 2
 The present time total surface mass density tot  51  6M pc- 2
 The present time SFR o  2 - 5M pc- 2Gyr- 1
 The present time infall rate 03 - 15M pc- 2Gyr- 1
 The present day mass function PDMF
 The solar abundances namely the chemical abundances of the ISM at the time of birth of
the solar system 45 Gyr ago and the present time abundances

 The age-metallicity relation
And nally a good model of chemical evolution of the Milky Way should reproduce the
distributions of abundances gas and star formation rate along the disk as well as the average
SNII and Ia rates along the disk SNII12  08 100yr- 1 and SNIa03  02 100yr- 1
Time-delay model interpretation
The difference in the timescales for the occurrence of SNII and Ia produces a time-
delay in the Fe production relative to the -elements Tinsley 1979 Greggio  Renzini
1983b Matteucci 1986 On this basis we can interpret all the observed abundance ratios
plotted as functions of metallicity In particular this interpretation is known as time-delay
model and can be easily illustrated by Figure 13 where we show the predictions of the two-
infall model for the chemical evolution of the solar vicinity concerning the OFe vs FeH
relation We show the standard case in which both the contributions to Fe enrichment from
type II and Ia are taken into account as well as the cases where only one type of SN at the
time is assumed to contribute to Fe enrichment Both data and models are normalized to the
solar abundances Anders  Grevesse 1989 From the Figure 13 is evident that only type
Ia SNe as Fe producers would predict a continuous decrease of the OFe ratio from low to
high metallicities upper curve whereas only type II SNe would create a roughly constant
OFe ratio Therefore only a model including both contributions in the percentages of
30 SNII and 70SNIa can reproduce the data
The time-delay model with the assumption of an IMF constant in time can explain the
different abundance patterns in the halo disk and bulge see Matteucci 2001

1997 whereas the data are from Franois
et al 2003 The models are normalized to the predicted solar abundances The
predicted abundance ratios at the time of the Sun formation are shown in each panel
and indicate a good t
Common Conclusions from Galaxy Models
Most of the more recent chemical evolution models agree on several important
issues which are i the G-dwarf metallicity distribution can be reproduced only by assuming
that the formation of the local disk occurred by infall of extragalactic gas on a long timescale
of the order of d  6 - 8 Gyr Chiappini et al 1997 Boissier and Prantzos 1999 Chang et
al 1999 Chiappini et al 2001 Alibs et al 2001
ii The relative abundance ratios XiFe vs FeH interpreted as being due to time-delay
between type Ia and II SNe allow one to reproduce the observed relations see Figure 14
and to infer the timescale for the halo-thick disk formation corresponding to FeH- 10
dex which should be of the order of h  15Gyr Matteucci and Greggio 1986 Matteucci
and Franois 1989 Chiappini et al 1997 On the other hand the external halo formed more
slowly perhaps on timescales of the order of 3-4 Gyr see Matteucci  Franois 1992 In
Figure 14 we show the predictions of the model developed by Chiappini et al 1997 by
adopting the yields of Woosley  Weaver 1995 for type II SNe with the exception of the
Mg yields which have been articially increased by a factor of 5 to obtain a good agreement
with the solar abundance of Mg and those of Nomoto et al 1997 for type Ia SNe their
case W7The Mg yield in type Ia SNe had also to be increased in order to t the solar
abundances Franois et al 2003 in preparation The problem of Mg underproduction
in nucleosynthesis models is well known and it was pointed out by Thomas et al 1998
Figure 14 shows clearly that the agreement between the model predictions and data for
-elements is quite good and support the time-delay model

have formed inside-out variable D and the SFR should be a strongly varying function of
the galactocentric distance as in eqs 14 15 and 16 Matteucci  Franois 1989
Chiappini et al 19972001 Portinari  Chiosi 1999 Goswami  Prantzos 2000 Alibs et
al 2001
Specic Conclusions from Galaxy Models
The assumed threshold in the SFR Chiappini et al 1997 produces naturally a gap
in the star formation process between the end of the halo-thick disk phase and the beginning
of the thin disk phase Such a gap lasts for  1 Gyr and it seems to be indicated by the
observations Gratton et al 2000 In particular in Figure 15 we show the observed and
predicted FeO vs OH where it appears that at around OH - 03 dex there is a lack
of stars and then the FeO ratio rises sharply This is a clear indication on the basis of the
time-delay model that there has been a period when only Fe was produced in other words a
halt in the SFR This gap seems to be observed also in the FeMg vs MgH Furhmann
1998 However more data are necessary before drawing rm conclusions on this important
point see also Chiappini  Matteucci this conference
No agreement on the behaviour of gradients in time exists among different authors In
particular some authors eg Boissier and Prantzos 1998 Portinari  Chiosi 1999 Alibs
et al 2001 nd a attening of abundance gradients with time whereas others Matteucci 
Franois 1989 Chiappini et al 2001 predict a steepening of the abundance gradients in
agreement with results from chemo-dynamical models Samland et al 1997 The difference
between the two different approaches assumed by the various authors could perhaps reside
in the different star formation andor infall laws adopted for the Galactic disk see Tosi 2000
for a discussion of this point Data from planetary nebulae PNe of different ages can help
in solving this problem recently Maciel et al 2002 suggested a attening of the gradients
with time In any case all the models predict a very small evolution in the last 5 Gyr

represents the model prediction after 2 Gyr from the beginning of star formation in
the thin-disk The upper curve represent the predicted gradient at the present time
Star formation rate in galaxies
It is very important to understand that different histories of star formation determine
the abundance patterns in galaxies In particular the XiFe vs FeH relations are strongly
inuenced by the SFR which inuences the temporal growth of the Fe abundance
In other words the time-delay model coupled with different SF histories implies different
timescales for the bulk of Fe production from type Ia SNe thus producing different Fe
vs FeH relations in different objects The typical timescale for type Ia SN enrichment can
be dened as the time when the SN Ia rate reaches the maximum tSNIa Matteucci  Recchi
2001 This timescale depends upon the progenitor lifetimes the IMF and the SFR For an
elliptical galaxy or a bulge of a spiral with high SFR the maximum in the type Ia SN rate is
reached at tSNIa  03 - 05 Gyr whereas for a spiral like the Milky Way a rst maximum in
the SNIa rate is reached at tSNIa  15 Gyr and a second maximum if one uses the two-infall
model at tSNIa  4- 5 Gyr Therefore for the Milky Way 1-15 Gyr is the time at which SNe
Ia are no more negligible in the process of chemical enrichment and it corresponds to the
change in slope observed in the elFe vs FeH relations Figure 14 and to the end of the
halo phase For an irregular galaxy where the SFR is assumed to proceed more slowly than
in the solar vicinity the timescale for SN Ia enrichment is tSNIa  7 - 8 Gyr Therefore it is
worth repeating that the tSNIa is different in different galaxies since often in the literature it
is adopted a universal timescale of 1 Gyr On the basis of that we expect that objects where
the SFR proceeds very fast such as in the spheroids bulges and ellipticals the Fe ratio
stays at for a larger metallicity interval than in systems with slower star formation such as
the Milky Way and that eventually the Fe ratios in irregulars where the star formation
rate has been less efcient than in spiral decreases almost continuously as shown in Figure
17 The models shown in Figure 17 contain the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions and
differ for the star formation history

bulge the LMC and Damped Lyman- systems are shown for comparison
114 High-redshift objects
In Figure 17 we show also some observational data relative to the Galactic bulge
the LMC and some Damped Lyman- systems DLA As one can see our predictions seem
to reproduce the data for the Galactic bulge and for LMC and also suggest that DLAs could
be the progenitors of the present day irregular galaxies since most of DLAs once their
abundances are corrected for the effect of dust show low Fe ratios at low metallicities
Vladilo 2002 Calura et al 2003 On the other hand Lyman-break galaxies such as
cB58 Pettini et al 2002 show an abundance pattern compatible with a young spheroid
either a galactic bulge or a small elliptical suffering a galactic outow as recently shown
by Matteucci  Pipino 2002 Therefore the XiFe vs FeH diagram represents a very
useful tool to infer the nature of high redshift objects of which we know just the abundances
and abundance ratios
