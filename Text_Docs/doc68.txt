Abstract 
Ligands for only two human olfactory receptors are known One of them OR1D2 binds to Bourgeonal 
Malnic B Godfrey P-A Buck L-B 2004 The human olfactory receptor gene family Proc Natl Acad 
Sci  U  S  A  101  2584-2589  and  Erratum  in  Proc  Natl  Acad  Sci  U  S  A  2004  101  7205  OR1D2 
OR1D4  and  OR1D5  are  three  full  length  olfactory  receptors  present  in  an  olfactory  locus  in  human 
genome  These  receptors  are  more  than  80  identical  in  DNA  sequences  and  have  108  base  pair 
mismatches  among  them  We  have  used  L-system  mathematics  and  have  been  able  to  show  a  closely 
related subfamily of OR1D2 OR1D4 and OR1D5  
Introduction 
Olfactory  receptors  ORs  loci  in  human  genome  occur  in  clusters  ranging  from  51-105  and  they  are 
unevenly spread over 21 chromosomes 1 2 A conservative estimate suggests that 339 full length OR 
genes  and  297  OR  pseudogenes  are  present  in  these  clusters  1  Theoretically  there  are  two  possible 
ways  of  OR-odorant  molecular  binding  viz  i each OR  binds  to  a large  number  of  different  odorants 
and ii each OR binds to a small number of odorants In either case odorant detection at the OR level 
follows  a  combinatorial  rule  though  the  stringency  of  the  rule  would  differ  in  the  two  alternatives 
Experimentally  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  each  OR  recognizes  a  large  number  of  odorants  and 
perhaps  a  large  class  of  various  concentrations  of  the  odorants  tested  3  OR  gene  conceptually 
translated to protein sequences family 40 amino acid identity can be divided into subfamily 60 
identity and sub-family members might have more than 90 identity 4 Subfamily members are highly 
similar in DNA and protein sequences but they are capable of recognizing different odorant molecules  
database 
httpgenomeweizmannacilhorde OR1D2 Gene length 936 bp OR1D4 Gene length 936 bp 
and  OR1D5  Gene length  936  bp  were  downloaded  from  the  HORDE  database  OR1D2  OR1D4  and 
OR1D5 were aligned using ClustalW and was found to contain 108 base pair mismatches out of 936 base 
pairs available data not shown OR1D2 OR1D4 and OR1D5 are highly related sequences therefore a 
canonical  sequence  for  this  subfamily  termed  as  star  model  of  OR  sequence  was  made  by  using  a 
computer  C  program  where  108  gaps  were  introduced  in  respective  positions  following  a  computer 
algorithm given at the end of the paper in reference Fig 1a and Fig 1b

Following aforesaid production rule 1st and 2nd iteration would give  03 bp and CCACCACTG 09

mismatches Five such iterations generate the following 243 bp sequence-

Using a C computer program nucleotides present in sequence i was introduced from 5- end of 
the sequence into the star model gaps shown in Fig 1 sequentially Briefly the  
Step 1 First in all the gaps with 1 bp 2 bp 3 bp and 4 bp in star model only one nucleotide 
would be inserted 
Step 2 1 bp gaps in star model would become 0 gap Then in the remaining gaps 1 bp 2 bp and 
3 bp would be filled up and the process would be repeated until all gaps are filled  
The resultant OR sequence is shown in ii below

 Sequence  ii  was  blasted  using  DNA-DNA  and  translated  protein-protein  Blastx  search  engines  in 
HORDE and NCBI database from where initial OR1D2 OR1D4 and OR1D5 sequences were obtained 
Results of blast searches show that with the search parameters available in the HORDE website which 
could  not  be  changed  by  remote  user  the  ii  sequence  showed  92  92  and  91  identity  with 
OR1D2 OR1D4 and OR1D5 respectively Significantly these insertions do not produce any stop codon 
in the exon sequence Therefore it is clear from the above result that close relative of OR1D2 OR1D4 
and OR1D5 subfamily can be generated by this approach In the next paper we have shown that 
L-system  can  also  be  used  to  generated  for  generating  close  relative  of  a  single  pseudogene 
present in the same loci that of OR1D2 OR1D4 and OR1D5 
In summary in this paper we report that close relatives of OR1D2 OR1D4 and OR1D5  can be generated 
by using L-system mathematics  
Appendix 
While writing the computer programme L-System satisfied following rules- A To fill the single gap of the Star 
Model  System  will  check  two  previous  states  as  well  as  the  two  past  states  of  the  gap-  a  If  the  second 
previous is T and the first previous is A and the first past is A and the second past is either A or G then 
the chosen L-System must produce C at the gap eg TAAAG  b If the second previous is T and 
the  first  previous  is  A  and  the  first  past  is  G  and  the  second  past  is  A  then  the  chosen  L-System  must 
produce C at the gap eg TAGA c If the second previous is T and the first previous is A and the 
first past is either T or C then the chosen L-System must produce C or T at the gap eg TATC  
d If the second previous is T and the first previous is G and the first past is A and the second past is either 
A  or  G  then  the  chosen  L-System  must  produce  C  or  G  at  the  gap  eg  TGAAG  e  If  the 
second previous is T and the first previous is G and the first past is G and the second past is A then the 
chosen L-System must produce C or G at the gap eg TGGA f If the second previous is T and the 
first previous is G and the first past is either T or C then the chosen L-System must produce C or G or 
T at the gap eg TGTC g If the first previous is T and the first past is A and the second past is 
either C or T then the chosen L-System must produce T or C at the gap eg TACT  h If the 
first previous is T and the first past is A and the second past is either A or G then the chosen L-System 
must produce C at the gap eg TAAG  i If the first previous is T and the first past is G and the 
second past is A then the chosen L-System must produce G or C at the gap eg TGA j If the first 
previous is T and the first past is G and the second past is C or T or G then the chosen L-System must 
produce T or C or G at the gap eg TGCTG h If the first previous is C and the first past is 
A and the second past is either A or G then the chosen L-System  must produce C or G or A at the 
gap eg CAAG  i If the first previous is C and the first past is G and the second past is A then 
the chosen L-System must produce C or G or A at the gap eg CGA j Else the gap can be filled 
by any state like A or C or T or G B To fill the double or more than double gap of the Star Model one 
gap fill at a time System should check only two previous states of the gap- a If the second previous is T and 
the first previous is A then the chosen L-System must produce C or T at the gap eg TA  b If 
the second previous is T and the first previous is G then the chosen L-System must produce C or T or 
G at the gap eg TG  c Else the gap can be filled by any state like A or C or T or G This rule 
would be applicable until the number of gap becomes one When the no of gap becomes one then the rule A 
is applicable
