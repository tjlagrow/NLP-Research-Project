Summary We show autoconsistent chemical and spectro-photometric evolution
models applied to spiral and irregular galaxies Evolutionary synthesis models usu-
ally used to explain the stellar component spectro-photometric data are combined
with chemical evolution models to determine precisely the evolutionary history of
spiral and irregular galaxies In this piece of work we will show the results obtained
for a wide grid of modeled theoretical galaxies
1 Introduction
It is well known that galaxies have dierent spectral energy distributions SEDs
depending on their morphological type 2 These SEDs and other data related to
the stellar phase are usually analysed through evolutionary synthesis models see
5 7 for a recent and updated review about these models based on single stellar
populations SSPs created by an instantaneous burst of star formation SF These
codes compute the SED S and the corresponding colors surface brightness andor
spectral absorption indices emitted by a SSP of metallicity Z and age   from the
sum of spectra of all stars created and distributed along a HR diagram convolved
with an initial mass function This SED given  and Z is characteristic of each SSP
SF however does not always take place in a single burst as occurs in spiral
and irregular galaxies where star formation is continuous or in successive bursts In
that case the characteristic  and Z found after tting a SSP model to an observed
SED represent only averaged values leading to a loss of information Our aim is to
obtain the time evolution of the galaxy given by the SF history SFH and the age-
metallicity relation AMR When more than a single generation of stars exists in a
region or galaxy the nal SED F corresponds to the light emitted by successive
generations of stars It may be calculated as the sum of several SSP SEDs S being
weighthed by the created stellar mass in each time stepimplying a convolution with
the SFH  t

This requires to us make hypotheses about the shape and the intensity of the
SFH eg an exponentially decreasing function of time is usually assumed The t
will give the best parameters that are needed to dene the assumed function In
fact in order to avoid bias one would need to consider also other possible SFHs and
their parameters ts but computational resources precluded the study of such large
model grids Moreover an important point usually forgotten when this technique
is applied is that S Z  S Zt that is the metallicity changes with time
since stars form and die continously It is not clear which Z must be selected at each
time step without knowing this function Zt Usually only one Z is used for the
whole integration which may be an over-simplication
A better method 1 is to perform a least square technique to nd the best
superposition of these SSPs which will t the data This gives the proportions of
stellar mass created at a given metallicity and age that better reproduce observa-
tions thus providing the SFH  t and the AMR Zt as results This technique
although essentially correct produces at the moment poor evolutionary histories
having low time resolution due to large bin widths
In summary it is clear that spiral and irregular galaxies are systems more
complex than those represented by SSPs and that in particular their chemical
evolution must be taken into account for a precise interpretation of the spectro-
photometric data On the plus side for these objects the gas phase data are also
available and may be used as constraint What is required then is to determine the
possible evolutionary paths followed by a galaxy that arrive at the observed present
state while simultaneously reproducing the average photometric properties dened
by the possible subjacent stellar populations
2 Chemical evolution models
The information coming from the gas phase such as density abundance and ac-
tual star formation rate is usually analysed using chemical evolution models They
describe how the proportion of heavy elements present in the interstellar medium
ISM increases starting from primordial abundances when stars evolve and die

Synthesis models for spiral galaxies
Modern codes solve numerically the system of equations used to describe a scenario
based on initial conditions for the total mass of the region the existence of infall
or outow of gas and the initial mass function IMF Stellar mean-lifetimes and
yields known from stellar evolutionary tracks are also included Finally a SF law
is assumed The best model for a galaxy will of course be the one which reproduces
the observational data as closely as possible

We use here the multiphase chemical evolution model described in 3 4 9 We
have computed in 8 a large grid of models for 44 theoretical galaxies with variable
initial masses and sizes obtained with the universal rotation curve of 11 The mass
in each modeled galaxy initially in the form of gas is in a protohalo from which it
falls onto an equatorial plane leading to the formation of the disc The gas infall rate
or its inverse the collapse-time scale depends on the total mass For each of these 44
galaxies we assumed 10 possible molecular cloud and SF eciencies  which may
take values in the range 01 and which are distinguished by the number N In this
way we computed models in the whole plane Vrot N or Vrot- Within this plane
the bright galaxies are located on the diagonal axis where the most massive spiral
galaxies are usually those of earliest morphological types 12 which in turn need
the highest star formation eciencies see Fig4 from 8 Furthermore there exist
other well dened zones in this plane corresponding to other classes of galaxies such
as the low mass dwarf galaxies Vrot  70 kms1
This grid reproduces well the generic data trends for the normal bright spiral
and irregular galaxies in particular the radial distributions observed for the gas
the stars the SFR and the elemental abundances in particular galaxies see 8
for details Each model produces the time evolution within a galaxy that is the
resulting SFH and AMR for several radial regions We show these evolutionary
histories in Fig 1 for the selected models given in Table 1 In this table we give the
number of the mass distribution N dis and its corresponding rotation velocity V rot
in columns 1 and 2 the number N which denes the SF eciency in column 3 and
the disk radius Ropt and collapse time scale col in columns 4 and 5 The SF as we
may see in panel a of Fig1 has a maximum max  with which we have normalized
the curves of panel a at a given time tmax which is dierent for each model
Both values are given in columns 6 and 7 of the same table In column 8 we give the
present time Iron abundance FeHp Each one of these models is representative of
a well known galaxy as those referenced in column 9 as checked in 8

3 Evolutionary synthesis models
From the results of the above section we take the SFH and the AMR as inputs in
Eq 1 to compute the SED of each galaxy The set of SSPs SEDs used are those
from the evolutionary synthesis code described in 10 For each stellar generation
created in the time step t a SSP-SED S  from this set is chosen taking into
account its age   t  t from the time t in which it was created until the present
t and the metallicity Zt reached by the gas After convolution with the SFH
 t the nal SED F  is obtained
The resulting F reproduce reasonably well the SEDs of galaxies such as can
be seen in Fig 2 There we compare our resulting spectra for the models of the
known galaxies of Table 1 to the dierent morphological type templates from 2
In order to use our model grid we may therefore to select the best model able
to t a given observed SED and then see if the corresponding SFH and the AMR
of this model are also able to reproduce the present time observational data of SFR
and metallicity of the galaxy
We show an example of this method in Fig 3 where some SEDs from 6 of
BCD galaxies are compared with the best model chosen for each one of them In
Fig 4 we show the corresponding SFH and AMR with which the modeled SEDs
were computed The nal values are within the error bars of observations for these
same galaxies compiled by the same authors 6 Since each SED is well tted
and simultaneously the corresponding presenttime data of the galaxy by the same

chemical evolution model we may be condent that these SFH and AMR give to
us a reliable characterization of the evolutionary history of each galaxy

4 Conclusions
We have computed a grid of 440 chemical evolution models for spiral and irregular
galaxies of dierent sizes and masses Vrot  40400 kms1
For each one of them we assumed 10 dierent SF eciencies and the correspond-
ing time evolutionary histories as given by the SFH and the AMR were then used
as inputs to obtain the SED through Eq1
In this way we have obtained spectral energy distributions colors surface bright-
ness and absorption spectral indices for each theoretical galaxy of the grid
This combination of techniques allows the use of two data types the ones pro-
ceeding from the gas phase as well as that coming from spectro-photometry If a
model is able to reproduce simultaneously both sets of observations for a given
galaxy the SFH and the AMR resulting from the corresponding chemical evolu-
