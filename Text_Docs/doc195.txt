ABSTRACT
Recent morphological studies of QSO host galaxies by the Hubble Space
Telescope HST have revealed that a sizable fraction of QSO host galaxies
possess close small companion galaxies It is however not clear why and how
these companion galaxies are physically associated with the activation of QSO
nucleus and the formation of QSO hosts We here demonstrate that QSO
companion galaxies are tidally formed by a gas-rich major galaxy merger and
then orbit the merger remnant based on the results of numerical simulations
which investigate both gas fueling to the central seed massive black holes in
the merger and global morphological evolution of the merger We furthermore
suggest that some of companion galaxies tidally formed in a major merger can
evolve eventually into small compact elliptical galaxies observed frequently in
the present-day bright massive galaxies Thus our numerical simulations not
only clarify the origin of companion galaxies observed in low and intermediate
redshift QSOs but also provide an evolutionary link between QSO companion
galaxies and the present-day compact elliptical galaxies located in the vicinity
of giant elliptical galaxies

Introduction
Since faint nebulosity around quasars was discovered Matthews  Sandage 1963
Sandage  Miller 1966 morphological studies of QSO host galaxies have revealed the
evolutionary link between the formation of QSO hosts and the activation of QSO nucleus
Hutchings et al 1982 Malkan 1984 Margon Downes  Chanan 1984 Smith et al 1986
Heckman et al 1991 Photometric and spectroscopic studies of QSO hosts furthermore
provided valuable clues to the nature of stellar populations of QSO host MacKenty 
Stockton 1984 Boronson Perrson  Oke 1985 Stockton  Rigeway 1991 Dunlop et
al 1993 McLeod  Rieke 1994 One of the most remarkable observational evidences is
that galaxy interaction and merging can trigger the nuclear activities of QSOs Stockton
1982 Hutchings  Campbell 1983 Stockton  Mackenty1983 Hutchings  Ne 1992
Bahcall et al 1997 In particular the recent high-resolution morphological studies of
QSO host galaxies by the Hubble Space Telescope HST and large grand-based ones
found that a sizable fraction of QSO hosts have close companion galaxies likely to be
interacting or merging with the hosts Bahcall et al 1995 Disney et al 1995 Although
these observational studies strongly suggest that close companion galaxies in QSO hosts
play a vital role in triggering QSO activities Bahcall et al 1995 it is still theoretically
unclear why QSO host galaxies so frequently have companions and how QSO activities are
physically associated with the formation and the evolution of such companion galaxies
In this Letter we numerically investigate both gas fueling to the seed black holes
located in the central part of two disks in a gas-rich merger and the morphological evolution
of the merger in order to present a plausible interpretation on the origin of small companion
galaxies frequently observed in QSO host galaxies We here demonstrate that the observed
QSO companion galaxies are formed in the outer part of strong tidal tails during gas-rich
major galaxy merging and then become self-gravitating compact galaxies orbiting elliptical
 4 
galaxies formed by merging We furthermore demonstrate that such companion galaxies
are located within a few tens kpc of elliptical galaxies when ecient gas fueling to the
central seed QSO black holes continues We thus suggest that both the formation of QSO
companion galaxies and the activation of QSO nucleus result from one physical process of
gas-rich major galaxy merging We furthermore discuss whether such companion galaxies
formed in QSO hosts can nally become compact elliptical galaxies that are frequently
observed in the present-day bright massive galaxies
2 Model
We construct models of galaxy mergers between gas-rich disk galaxies with equal mass
by using Fall-Efstathiou model 1980 The total mass and the size of a progenitor disk
are Md and Rd respectively From now on all the mass and length are measured in units
of Md and Rd respectively unless specied Velocity and time are measured in units of
v  GMdRd12 and tdyn  R3
dGMd12 respectively where G is the gravitational
constant and assumed to be 10 in the present study If we adopt Md  60  1010 M and
Rd  175 kpc as a ducial value then v  121  102 kms and tdyn  141  108 yr
respectively In the present model the rotation curve becomes nearly at at 035 Rd with
the maximum rotational velocity vm  18 in our units The corresponding total mass Mt
and halo mass Mh are 50 and 40 in our units respectively The radial R and vertical
Z density prole of a disk are assumed to be proportional to expRR0 with scale
length R0  02 and to sech2ZZ0 with scale length Z0  004 in our units respectively
The Toomres parameter Binney  Tremaine 1987 for the initial disks is set to be 12
The collisional and dissipative nature of the interstellar medium is modeled by the sticky
particle method Schwarz 1981 Star formation is modeled by converting the collisional
gas particles into collisionless new stellar particles according to the Schmidt law Schmidt
 5 
1959 with the exponent of 20 The initial gas mass fraction fg is considered to be a free
parameter ranging from 01 corresponding to a gas poor disk to 05 a very gas-rich one
We here present the result of the model with fg  05 because this model most clearly
shows the typical behavior of QSO companion formation The dependence of the details of
QSO companion formation on fg will be described by our future paper Bekki 1999
The orbital plane of a galaxy merger is assumed to be the same as xy plane and the
initial distance between the center of mass of merger progenitor disks is 80 in our units
140 kpc Two disks in the merger are assumed to encounter each other parabolically with
the pericentric distance of 10 in our units 175 kpc The intrinsic spin vector of one
galaxy in a merger is exactly parallel with z axis whereas that of the other is tilted by 30
from z axis The present study describes the QSO companion formation only for a nearly
prograde-retrograde merger in which only one intrinsic spin vector of a merger progenitor
galaxy is nearly parallel with orbital spin vector of the merger The dependence of the
details of QSO companion formation processes on the initial orbital congurations of galaxy
mergers will be given by Bekki 1999 The number of particles used in a simulation is
20000 for dark halo components 20000 for stellar ones and 20000 for gaseous ones All the
calculations including the dissipative and dissipationless dynamics and star formation have
been carried out on the GRAPE board Sugimoto et al 1990 at Astronomical Institute of
Tohoku University The parameter of gravitational softening is set to be xed at 003 in all
the simulations
By using this merger model we rstly investigate morphological and dynamical
evolution of a gas-rich major galaxy merger with a particular emphasis on the formation of
close small companions dwarf-like galaxy in the merger Secondly we investigate when
and how QSO activities are triggered by major galaxy merging by counting total mass
of interstellar gas accumulated within the central 100 pc of a galaxy merger In order to
 6 
estimate the gas mass in a explicitly self-consistent manner we initially place a collisionless
particle with the mass equal to 30  106 in the mass center of a disk and regard this particle
as a seed black hole We then investigate both the time evolution of the orbit of the
seed black hole and the total gas mass transferred to the central 100 pc around the black
hole Here we hypothetically assume that interstellar gas transferred to the central 100 pc
around the seed black hole can be furthermore fueled to the central sub-pc region where
a massive black hole gravitationally dominates and utilizes gas falling onto the accretion
disk for a QSO activity The reason for our adopting this assumption is that we regard a
certain mechanism for gas fueling to the sub-pc region such as the so-called bars within
bars proposed by Shlosman Frank  Begelman 1989 as being occurred naturally in
the high-density self-gravitating central regions of galaxy mergers The above two-fold
investigation just allows us to address questions as to when and how galaxy merging not
only forms small companions but also triggers QSO nuclear activities

3 Result
Figure 1 describes how a QSO companion galaxy is formed by gas-rich major galaxy
merging As two gas-rich disks merge to form a tidal tail composed of gas and stars the
time T  11 Gyr the stellar components in the tail rst collapse to form a self-gravitating
dwarf-like object Gaseous components are then swept into the deep gravitational potential
well of the dwarf galaxy to form a massive gaseous clump owing to the enhanced gaseous
 7 
dissipation in the shocked region of the tidal tail and the dwarf Star formation proceeds
very eciently in the high density gas clump and consequently new stellar components
are formed in the dwarf galaxy T  17 Gyr The physical processes of the dwarf galaxy
formation in the present star-forming galaxy merger are essentially the same as those
described by Barnes  Hernquist 1992 This self-gravitating dwarf galaxy can then orbit
an elliptical galaxy formed by galaxy merging without signicant radial orbital decay due
to dynamical friction between the dwarf and the host elliptical and tidal destruction by
the elliptical T  23 and 28 Gyr Total mass in the dwarf at T  23 Gyr is roughly
estimated to be  27  109M corresponding to 45  of the initial disk mass The gas
mass fraction of the dwarf is rather large  25 which reects the fact of the dwarfs
being formed in the gas-rich tidal tail About 45  of stellar components of the dwarf are
very young stars formed from gaseous components of the tidal tail which implies that this
dwarf galaxy can be observed to show very blue colors until its hot and massive stars died
out Considering that the present gas-rich star-forming merger model also shows ecient
gas fueling to the central seed black holes as is described later we regard the above results
as demonstrating clearly that the dwarf galaxy formed in galaxy merging can be observed
as a companion galaxy in a QSO host galaxy
Figure 2 shows the star formation history of the merger and the time evolution of gas
mass located within the central 100pc around the seed black holes of the merger Star
formation rate becomes maximum  378Myr at T  13 Gyr when two disks nally
merge to form an elliptical galaxy and the ecient redistribution of angular momentum and
gaseous dissipation by cloud-cloud collisions cooperate to form the extremely high-density
gaseous regions in the central part of the merger After the intense secondary starburst
the star formation then rapidly declines owing to the ecient gas consumption by the
starburst Gas fueling to the central seed black holes becomes maximum 65  108M at T
 13 Gyr which is the same as the maximum starburst of the merger Gas supply for the
 8 
seed black holes is greatly controlled by the rapid gas consumption by star formation and
consequently gas fueling gradually declines after the completion of the secondary starburst
The gas fueling in the present study tends to be more ecient in the late phase of galaxy
merging T  13 Gyr than in the early one T  13 Gyr Assuming that all of the
gas transferred to the central 100pc around the seed black holes can be directly accreted
onto the accretion disk of the black holes we can estimate that the mean accretion rate
in the merger late phase 13 Gyr  T  23 Gyr is 63Myr The derived accretion
rate is sucient enough to trigger the typical magnitude of QSO activity eg Rees 1984
These results imply that secondary massive starburst and QSO nuclear activity AGN can
be observed to coexist in a QSO host galaxy which is consistent with the observational
evidence that some of QSO host galaxies show very bluer colors and spectroscopic properties
indicative of the past starburst MacKenty  Stockton 1984 Boronson Perrson  Oke
1985 Stockton  Rigeway 1991
Thus Figure 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that gas-rich major galaxy merging not only
contributes to the formation of a companion galaxy orbiting a merger remnant but also
triggers QSO nuclear activities Accordingly our numerical study can naturally explain why
QSO host galaxies some of which are actually observed to be ongoing mergers and elliptical
galaxies eg Bahcall et al 1997 are more likely to have close small companion galaxies
This is essentially because both QSO host galaxies with pronounced nuclear activities and
their companions result from one physical process of major galaxy merging Our numerical
studies furthermore provide the following three predictions on physical properties of QSO
companions and hosts First prediction is that the luminosity of a QSO companion galaxy
is roughly proportional to that of the QSO host principally because the mass of tidal
debris that is a progenitor of a QSO companion depends strongly on the initial mass of a
galaxy merger Second is that a QSO companion has very young stellar population formed
in secondary starburst of galaxy merging and thus shows photometric and spectroscopic
 9 
properties indicative of starburst or post-starburst Third is that not all of galaxy mergers
can create QSO companions galaxies essentially because nearly retrograde-retrograde
mergers can not produce strong tidal tails indispensable for the formation of companion
galaxies because of the weaker tidal perturbation of the mergers The details of the physical
conditions required for the formation of QSO companions will be described in Bekki 1999
We suggest that future observational studies on the dependence of the luminosity-ratio of
QSO hosts to QSO companions on QSO host luminosity age and metallicity distribution of
stellar populations of QSO companions and the probability that QSO host galaxies have
companion galaxies physically associated with them can verify the above three predictions
and thereby can determine whether major galaxy merging is a really plausible model of
QSO companion formation
4 Discussion and Conclusion
The fate of QSO companion galaxies is an interesting problem of the present merger
scenario of QSO companion formation We here propose that some of the companions
nally evolve into compact elliptical galaxies cE that have typical blue magnitude
MB ranging from -18 mag to -14 mag truncated de Vaucouleurs luminosity prole
color-magnitude relation of giant ellipticals typically solar-metallicity and higher degree of
global rotation Faber 1973 Wirth  Gallagher 1984 Nieto  Prugniel 1987 Freedman
1989 Bender  Nieto 1990 Burkert 1994 The essential reason of this proposal is
described as follows Burkert 1994 numerically investigated the dynamical evolution of
proto-galaxies experiencing an initial strong starburst and the subsequent violent relaxation
in the tidal external gravitational eld of a massive elliptical galaxy and revealed that the
observed peculiar properties of cEs are due to the external tidal eld around progenitor
proto-galaxies of cEs Burkert 1994 accordingly proposed a scenario in which satellite
 10 
proto-galaxies revolving initially around a bright elliptical galaxy eventually form cEs after
violent cold collapse and strong starburst around the galaxy Although his model of cE
formation is not directly related to physical processes of gas-rich major galaxy merging
the physical environment of cE formation in his model is very similar to that of gas-rich
galaxy merging Tidal debris collapses to form a self-gravitating small galaxy in the rapidly
changing external gravitational eld of two merging disk galaxies in the present study
Accordingly it is not unreasonable to consider that some of companion galaxies created in
tidal tails nally become cEs orbiting elliptical galaxies formed by major galaxy merging
The observational fact that cEs exist almost exclusively as satellites of bright massive
galaxies Faber 1973 Burkert 1994 strengthens the validity of the proposed evolutionary
link between QSO companions and cEs Furthermore the larger degree of global rotation
in kinematics observed in cEs eg Bender  Nieto 1990 seems to be consistent with the
proposed scenario since QSO companions are created in the tidal debris of rotationally
supported disk galaxies in the scenario The present numerical study unfortunately cannot
investigate in detail structural and kinematical properties of companion galaxies formed in
galaxy mergers because of very small particle number of the simulated companion  800
Our future high resolution simulations with the total particle number of  107 will enable
us to compare the numerical results of structural kinematical and chemical properties of
QSO companions formed in major mergers with observational ones of cEs located near
giant ellipticals in an explicitly self-consistent manner and thereby answer the question as
to the evolutionary link between intermediate and high redshift QSO companions and the
present-day cEs
The most important observational test to assess the validity of the proposed formation
scenario of QSO companion galaxies is to investigate whether a QSO companion galaxy
has younger stellar populations formed by secondary starburst and thus shows photometric
and spectroscopic properties indicative of starburst or post-starburst Canalizo  Stockton
 11 
1997 recently investigated spectroscopic properties of companion galaxies in three QSOs
3CR 3231 PG 1700518 PKS 2135-147 and found that the spectra of a companion
galaxy in QSO PG 1700518 shows both strong Balmer absorption lines from a relatively
young stellar population and Mg I b absorption feature and the 4000 A break from an
old stelar population Stockton Canalizo  Close 1998 furthermore demonstrated that
the time that has elapsed since the end of the most recent major starburst event in the
companion of QSO PG 1700518 is roughly 0085 Gyr based on the spectral energy
distribution derived from adaptive-optics image in J and H band These observational
results on the post-starburst signature of QSO companions are consistent reasonably
well with the proposed scenario which predicts that a QSO companion galaxy contains
both relatively old stellar populations previously located in merger progenitor disks and
very younger stellar populations formed in gas-rich tidal tails Detailed spectroscopic
studies of QSO companion galaxies such as Canalizo  Stockton 1997 and Stockton
Canalizo  Close 1998 have not been yet so accumulated Future extensive spectroscopic
studies of companions in each of intermediate and high redshift QSOs will clarify the age
distribution of stellar populations of the companions and thus determine whether most of
QSO companions are really formed in major galaxy mergers
We conclude that gas-rich major galaxy merging can naturally explain the prevalence
of small companion galaxies in QSO hosts The essential reason for the origin of QSO
companions is that strong tidal gravitational eld of major galaxy merging both triggers
the formation of companions and provides ecient fuel for QSO nuclear activities
This explanation of QSO companion formation is consistent reasonably well with the
observational fact that QSO nucleus are already activated though the companions are still
located in the vicinity of the QSO hosts  a few tens kpc from the center of the hosts
Our numerical simulations accordingly suggest that the observed companion galaxies in
QSO hosts are not the direct cause of QSO nuclear activities but the result of gas-rich
 12 
major galaxy merging Although minor galaxy merging between small companion galaxies
and giant elliptical galaxies or disk ones is demonstrated to be closely associated with
secondary massive starburst in disks Mihos  Hernquist 1995 and strong starburst in
shell galaxies Hernquist  Weil 1992 the present study implies that this minor merging
is probably less important in the activation of QSO nucleus and the formation of QSO
companions The present study provides only one scenario of QSO companion formation
thus we lastly stress that physical processes related to the companion formation are likely
to be more variously dierent and complicated than is described in the present study

Note that the simulated morphology at T  11 Gyr and that at T  28 Gyr are remarkably
similar to the QSO 1403434 Hutchings  Morris 1995 which is observed to have a dwarf-
like companion galaxy within a tidal tail associated with the QSO and to the intermediate
redshift QSO PKS2128-123 Disney et al 1995 which is observed to have a close compact
companion around the well relaxed elliptical host galaxy respectively
