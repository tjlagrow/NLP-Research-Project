Vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF signaling is involved in the process of blood vessel de-
velopment and maintenance Signaling is initiated by binding of the bivalent VEGF ligand to the
membrane-bound receptors VEGFR which in turn stimulates receptor dimerization Herein we
discuss experimental evidence that VEGF receptors localize in caveloae and other regions of the
plasma membrane and for other receptors it has been shown that receptor clustering has an im-
pact on dimerization and thus also on signaling Overall receptor clustering is part of a complex
ecosystem of interactions and how receptor clustering impacts dimerization is not well understood
To address these questions we have formulated the simplest possible model We have postulated
the existence of a single high afnity region in the cell membrane which acts as a transient trap for
receptors We have dened an ODE model by introducing high- and low-density receptor variables
and introduce the corresponding reactions from a realistic model of VEGF signal initiation Finally
we use the model to investigate the relation between the degree of VEGFR concentration ligand
availability and signaling In conclusion our simulation results provide a deeper understanding of
the role of receptor clustering in cell signaling
1 Introduction
The topic of the spatial organization of the cell membrane and its impact on receptor clustering and sig-
nal initiation are part of a complex and very active eld illustrating the challenges faced by quantitative
systems biology There are ultimately two different levels of spatial and mathematical detail involved
Signaling in response to the presence of VEGF occurs on the level of the entire cell Factors that enhance
or inhibit signaling are of crucial importance in the quest to understand and control the progression of
various types of cancer At the other end of the spectrum the detailed topography of the cell membrane
the mobility and binding characteristics of individual receptors occur at scales of a few tens of nanome-
ters literally thousands of times smaller than the size of the cell These aspects are actively investigated
by various microscopy modalities which provide a wealth of extremely detailed data
One of the tasks of meaningful modeling is to bridge the gap between these scales and to identify
rational approaches to abstractions and approximations that can connect data and insights from different
scales Hybrid systems result naturally when continuous degrees of freedom are abstracted into discrete
states or regimes Here we discuss a continuous model that results as the ultimate abstraction of the

complex biological system mentioned above Our starting point is the microscopic observation that
receptors tend to concentrate in small patches The distribution size and physical characteristics of these
patches can be inferred from microscopic observations In other work 9 17 we performed detailed
spatial simulations of receptors in a network of high- and low- density membrane patches These models
are naturally abstracted to a network of patches that act as well-mixed communicating containers The
nal abstraction is one where all high density patches are treated as a single well mixed compartment
in contact with another one that represents the rest of the membrane
In this paper we focus on the nal top level abstraction which becomes quite complex when one
combines it with a realistic kinetic model of signal initiation We use a recently developed approach 7
to identify and investigate the steady states of the model and discuss the implications of high density
patches on the phenomenology of signaling
This rest of this paper is organized as follows We rst provide some background on the role of VEGF
its signaling mechanism and the potential modulation of VEGF signaling by the spatial structure of the
cell membrane The following subsection is devoted to the phenomenology of receptor clustering and the
available experimental data We conclude the introduction by sketching the sequence of abstractions and
approximations required to extract high cell level behaviors from the detailed microscopic observations
Sec 2 is devoted to the denition of the model and to the derivation of analytical expressions for the
steady states that require solving a one dimensional algebraic equation Section 3 discusses results
obtained by numerically solving the steady state expressions
Background
Angiogenesis the growth of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels is switched on or off by the
dynamic balance among numerous angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors the angiogenesis switch hy-
pothesis 2 8 Among the various growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and its
receptors VEGFR have received much attention because of their fundamental role in tumorigenesis and
other pathologies 21019 Initially identied as a vascular permeability factor that increased leakiness
of blood vessels 25 the role of VEGF in regulating angiogenesis was discovered later 4 21
Signaling by VEGFR is initiated by binding of the ligand dimer to the extracellular domain of the
receptor which stimulates receptor homo- and hetero-dimerization 14 23 27 Receptor dimerization
is followed by protein kinase activation trans-autophosphorylation recruitment of signaling molecules
and activation of distinct pathways Due to its bivalence VEGF binding may precede and induce the
dimerization of its receptors by the binding of a second receptor to the free binding site of the ligand
see Figure 1 for the explicit process Ligand-induced or -enhanced receptor dimerization is a feature
present in several other receptor-ligand families including EGF and immune receptors
Mathematical models of VEGF binding 5 generally represent the cell membrane as a single homo-
geneous entity equivalent to a well-mixed compartment whose state is sufciently characterized by a
single concentration value for each of the substances of interest This is justied if there are no signicant
inhomogeneities and all molecules can diffuse and mix freely over the entire membrane surface as in
the classic Singer-Nicholson uid mosaic model 26 However our understanding of the cell membrane
has evolved signicantly since 1972 The current picture 28 is more structured with microdomains
of lipids and proteins 6 13 24 Modern microscopy techniques 22 29 provide direct evidence of the
effect of these structures on membrane receptor localization and movement 11820 revealing receptor
clusters in static images and intervals of connement in small areas separated by jumps or hops in
single particle tracking
Spatial organization in the membrane can potentially have a major impact on signaling pathways

Figure 1 The dimerization and ligand binding reactions form a network of 7 reactions in the VEGF signal initiation model of 5 Receptors
R may bind one of the two poles of a VEGF ligand V  and may form a direct bond with another receptor In the ligand-induced dimerization
LID sequence receptors can not form a direct bond outside a pre-existing complex signal initiation progresses through reactions 765 In
the dynamic pre-dimerization DPD sequence receptors may dimerize before binding ligand adding reactions 1 and 2
that rely on interaction between membrane-bound molecules Receptor dimerization either through
ligand-dependent or independent direct receptor-receptor binding or by crosslinking through ligands
requires the collision of two membrane-bound receptors and is thus inuenced by the mobility and
possible connement of receptors In turn receptor dimerization is a necessary step in signal initiation
and therefore the mobility and spatial organization of membrane receptors must be part of the quantitative
understanding of many cell signaling pathways
The microscopic picture
VEGF receptors share many properties of other receptor tyrosine kinases Similarly to EGF receptors
they form ligand-bound dimers in order to activate their intracellular tyrosine kinase domains 12 Ex-
perimental and theoretical investigation of EGF binding 3 9 17 emphasized the importance of spatial
distribution of receptors Ample experimental evidence indicates that EGF receptors can have a highly in-
homogeneous distribution characterized by small areas of high density 30 and exhibit anomalous diffu-
sion 20 There are other examples of receptors that exhibit clustering and anomalous diffusion 1 Re-
ceptor accumulation in high density patches has an impact on dimerization and on signaling 391517
The data analysis pipeline in this case begins with detailed microscopic observations that provide
either static images of a large fraction of the receptors of interest or in the case of single particle
tracking SPT time histories of the positions of a small fraction of the receptors
In the rst case
Fig 2 the imaging modality is transmission electron microscopy TEM receptors are tagged with
small 6-10 nanometer sized gold particles and one image covers a few m2 capturing up to a few
hundred receptors In the second case SPT tracking is typically performed using uorescent tags but
the technique can only identify the position of well separated molecules this modality provides up to
several hundred snapshots covering a few seconds yielding a few tens of trajectories
Static images of receptors even in the absence of ligand typically reveal a clustering pattern where
receptors tend to accumulate in groups ranging from a few to a few tens of receptors This occurs for
VEGFR and also other receptor types for which there is no evidence of a collective binding mechanism
The generally accepted explanation is that receptors accumulate in microdomains small physically

delimited areas of the cell membrane that result from partitioning by actin laments elements of the
cytoskeleton or are formed by local aggregations of specic types of lipids and  or membrane proteins
However there is no clear understanding of the mechanism of receptor accumulation One hypothesis is
that some microdomains have a specic molecular composition that results in an afnity for the receptors
receptors may diffuse in and out of them but the crossing probability is asymmetric This hypothesis
of conning microdomains is supported by time resolved tracking data that reveals anomalous non-
Brownian diffusion and under some circumstances spatial connement
From microscopic details to global behavior
Our model building program relies on a sequence of models with three different levels of detail Ab-
stractions andor average behaviors obtained from one level serve as inputs to the next higher level We
use the idea of high afnity patches as a working hypothesis
1 At the microscopic level we investigate the localization motion and interactions of individual
receptors Static distributions Fig 2 exhibit clusters that are not consistent with a random distribution
The identication of clusters can be done by a hierarchic clustering algorithm The distribution of nearest
neighbor distances as well as other statistical measures point toward a structure of high density patches
essentially identied with the observed clusters Receptors are distributed randomly within the patches
and the patches themselves also appear to be distributed randomly
The observed receptor trajectories exhibit anomalous diffusion We model this with random walks
in the presence of various geometries of semi-permeable barriers Comparisons of simulated and ex-
perimental step size distributions also support the high density patch hypothesis In summary the mi-
croscopic data combined with a Brownian motion model can provide estimations of the individual and
combined size as well as the attractiveness of the high density patches In addition direct measurements
based on SPT can provide exit and entrance rates as well as dimerization and dissociation rates for
molecular species of interest
2 The information on the size and properties of high afnity patches is used at the intermediate
mesoscopic level to simulate the reactions and interchange of receptors and receptor-ligand complexes
At this level each high density patch is abstracted into a single well mixed compartment Since recep-
tors tend to diffuse quickly through the non-attractive region until they are retrapped by an attractive
patch the entire non-attractive region is represented as a single compartment The mesoscopic model
Y Chen C Short A M Halasz J S Edwards
Figure 3 ab Attractive microdomains occupy a small fraction of the cell membrane and their measurements may be extracted from ex-
perimental images c Although the receptors can move through the non-attractive regions they tend to remain in the smaller clusters d
In the mesoscopic approach each microdomain as well as the rest of the membrane the normal region are represented as well-mixed
compartments that may exchange particles
is an abstraction of the microscopic models where spatial degrees of freedom have been discretized
Mobility information is encapsulated in the particle exchange rates between domains the capacity of the
corresponding compartments as well as the effective dimerization rates with the compartments In terms
of implementation this level requires the composition of a spatial network of domains dened by an
oriented weighted adjacency graph and a chemical reaction network
3 The third highest level of abstraction is obtained by 1 merging all attractive patches into a
single one and 2 making the continuum approximation The resulting ODE system is discussed in the
remainder of this paper
2 Model
Consistent with the emerging experimental picture we make two assumptions First we assume that
a fraction f  1 of the membrane is covered by domains that have a physical afnity for receptors As
receptors diffuse throughout the membrane the probability of crossing the boundary of such an attractive
domain is asymmetric - all else being equal inbound crossing is   1 times more likely than outbound
We will consider the aggregate of the high afnity patches as a single high density domain and refer
to the rest as the low density domain or sector Second we will set the mobility of receptor dimers
lower than that of monomers These two ingredients result in the preferential accumulation of receptors
in the high density patches We investigate the effect of this accumulation clustering on dimerization
and signal initiation We are especially interested in establishing whether there is a postive feed-back
between dimerization and receptor clustering

We follow the mathematical modeling framework of MacGabhann Popel and coworkers 5 to describe
free R and ligand-bound VR receptors receptor dimers RR and three ligand-bound dimer com-
plexes VRR RVR  the ligand is considered constant Their structure and reactions among them are
illustrated in Figure 1 For simplication we assume that there is a region in the membrane with high
afnity for VEGF receptors and describe the rest as a secondnormal or low afnity one Each of the
six species is presented in both domains similary each of the 7 reactions has a copy in each domain see

Figure 5 Schematic and notations for the high- and low-density areas on the cell surface We assume that a fraction of the membrane area A1
has a higher afnity for VEGF receptors than the rest of the membrane This translates into asymmetric rate constants for the in and out
uxes
in domain x x  12 divided by the total area of the cell membrane Acell We will refer to the usual
concentrations as physical Sxphys Generally the meaning of the concentrations and rate constants is
similar to the standard approach in 5 with some important differences as discussed below
Consider rst the exchange reactions D1    D6 in eq2  exemplied by reaction D1  R1 cid42cid41 R2
Let the fraction of the area that has high afnity to VEGF receptors be f  The size of the high VEGF
density area is A1  f Acell and the remaining area is A2  1 f Acell see Figure 5 Let us derive the
ux of unbound receptors R between A1 and A2 represented by the reaction R1 cid42cid41 R2 Let R1phys and
R2phys be the physical concentrations of R in A1 and A2 respectively dened as the amount in fmol
of R in A1 respectively A2 divided by the area A1 resp A2 The effective concentrations denoted as
R1eff R2eff resp are the amounts of R in A1 A2 resp but divided by the total area Acell Therefore
R1phys 
R1eff
and R2phys 
R2eff

with units of fmolcm2 for all concentrations
We assume that the ux of receptors out amount of substance per unit time and boundary length in
fmolcm s in our case from A1 to A2 is proportional to the physical concentration out  outR1phys
similarly the receptor ux into A1 is in  inR2phys The factors in and out reect the physical
permeability of the boundary and have units of cms We dene the attractiveness   inout to reect
the asymmetry of the permeabilities so we have in  inR2phys  outR2phys and   1 means
that a receptor or a dimer is more easily transferred into the high concentration area A1 than into A2
Consequently the exchange uxes between the two domains will balance when the ratio of the respective
physical concentrations is  ie in  out  outR2phys  outR1phys  R2phys  R1phys
Consider the net rate of change of concentrations R1phys and R2phys due to the exchange of recep-
tor monomers between the two compartments we have

are the same as above for ligand-bound monomer species V Rx For dimer species RRx V RRx RV Rx and

As R2 and VR1 are expressed as algebraic functions with variable R1 all the variables in XF 
R1 R2 R12 R22 R1VR1 can be represented as an explicit function of R1 and consequently
all the solutions of 13 can be rewritten as functions of R1 We expressed all 12 variables as functions

we can solve the equation for R1 numerically for any given value of Rtotal For all parameter values used
in this paper the dependence on R was consistent with a single real root leading us to the conclusion
that the system had a unique steady state This does not exclude the possibility of multiple steady states
for other parameter sets

tions as outlined above for various values of the relative size of the high density area  f  5   30
the attractiveness parameter   1   10 and for VEGF concentrations ranging from 001 nM to 5 nM
We considered three situations for the relative mobility of dimers   050250 note that the   05
case corresponds to equivalent monomer and dimer mobilities
We rst performed calculations using the full model of 5 The equilibrium values for the total
number of receptors and signaling complexes in the two domains as a function of the three parameters

relative size f of the HD area results in an increasing fraction of receptors and signaling complexes in
the high density area Increasing the concentration of VEGF leads to overall increased singaling but no
signicant shifts between the domains
In Figure 7 the total amount of signaling complexes increases only weakly as a function of the attrac-
tiveness parameter  This set calculations was performed including both the ligand-induced dimeriza-
tion as well as the pre-dimerization DPD mechanism of the Mac Gabhann-Popel model The DPD rate

the attractiveness factor  the relative size of the HD domain f  and the concentration of VEGF ligand V0 The values for the xed parameters
were   5 f  01V0  01 nM Solid lines correspond to the case when dimers are not allowed to cross domain boundaries and dashed
lines correspond to fully mobile dimers The total signal black lines depends weakly on the afnity and size of the attractive domain due to
the combined effects of the relatively high V0  01 nM VEGF concentration value used in the calculations as well as due to the presence of
strong ligand-independent dimerization DPD in the model
We were especially interested in the effect of dimerization on the preferential accumulation of recep-
tors While the results in Fig 7 and 8 indicate that the accumulation effect is stronger when dimers are
not allowed to cross domain boundaries the ligand dose response curves rightmost panels show only a
marginal effect due to the presence of ligand
The explanation for the weakness of these effects is the presence of ligand-independent dimerization
or pre-dimerization in the Mac Gabhann-Popel model as well as the high value of the on-surface
VEGF-receptor binding constant aS The effect of dimerization on clustering is revealed when pre-
dimerization is turned off by setting b  00001 in the rate laws and the on-surface ligand binding
rate as is reduced These results are shown in Fig 9 and 10 The signal is clearly increased as the
afnity of the HD domain increases There is an optimum in the size of the HD area middle panel
Fig 9 The effect on the signal persists when dimers are allowed to move While the dependence of
localization on attractiveness and domain size are similar to the previous set the depedendence on V0 is
dramatically different in Fig 10 showing a signicant increase in the number of receptors in the HD
area as V0 is increased This effect is completely absent when dimers are allowed to move at the same
rate as monomers and is very signicantly weakened at the intermediate mobility value we used those
results not shown

Figure 8 Total number of receptors in the high-afnity red and normal blue domains in the same set of calculations as in Figure 7 The
afnity and size of the HD domain strongly inuence clustering represented by the accumulation of receptors in the HD domain however
the effect of VEGF is marginal because the model includes ligand-independent dimerization DPD
Figure 9 Signaling complexes RV R and  in the high-afnity red and normal blue domains as well as total signal black as a function of
the attractiveness factor  the relative size of the HD domain f  and the concentration of VEGF ligand V0 The values for the xed parameters
were   5 f  01V0  01 nM Solid lines correspond to the case when dimers are not allowed to cross domain boundaries and dashed
lines correspond to fully mobile dimers This calculation used signicantly reduced on-surface dimeriztion rates namely as  00021 and
b  00001 essentially eliminating DPD By contrast with Figure 7 the afnity of the HD domain strongly enhances the signal as dimers are
formed at a higher rate in the HD domain
In summary our simple model shows a positive feedback between dimerization  signaling and recep-
tor clustering Accumulation of receptors in a high afnity patch enhances dimerization and signaling
On the other hand increased dimerization in the presence of ligand inceased the accumulatin of re-
ceptors in the high afnity patch The latter effect also requires a dramatic reduction in the mobility of
dimers Finally we should point out that the empirically obtained model parameters lead to dimerization

VEGF Signaling with One Receptor Cluster
Figure 10 Total number of receptors in the high-afnity red and normal blue domains in the same set of calculations as in Figure 9 By
contrast with Figure 8 the presence of VEGF strongly promotes the accumulation of receptors in the HD domain Dimers are formed at a
higher rate in the HD domain and become trapped causing the HD domain to act as a receptor sink
rates that are so high that the effects we described here would be marginal however the empirically
determined parameters are what one would observe as a result of afnity-induced clustering In other
words in the presence of high density domains signicanly lower dimerization rate constants may be
sufcient to achieve the observed signaling
