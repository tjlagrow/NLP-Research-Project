1 Introduction
Despite the recent developments in observational cosmology one of
the main unsolved issues remains how and when the present-day mas-
sive elliptical galaxies Mstars  1011 M built up and what type of
evolution characterized their growth across the cosmic time
There are two main proposed scenarios In the rst such systems
formed at high redshifts eg z  23 through a monolithic collapse
accompanied by a violent burst of star formation then followed by a
passive and pure luminosity evolution PLE of the stellar population to
nowadays Eggen Lynden-Bell  Sandage 1962 Tinsley 1972 Larson
1974 van Albada 1982 Such a scenario makes some critical and rigid
predictions that can be tested with the observations i the comoving
number density of massive spheroids should be conserved through cos-
mic times ii massive galaxies should evolve only in luminosity iii
old passively evolving spheroids should exist at least up to z  1  15
iv there should be a population of progenitors at z  2  3 charac-
terized by large amounts of gas and dust and strong star formation
rates in order to be compatible with the rapid formation scenario and
with the properties eg masses ages metallicities of the present-day
fossils resulting from that formation process
In a diametrically opposed scenario massive spheroids formed at
later times through a slower process of hierarchical merging of smaller
galaxies eg White  Rees 1978 Kauman White  Guiderdoni
1993 Kaumann 1996 characterized by moderate star formation rates
thus reaching the nal masses in more recent epochs eg z  1  15
eg Baugh et al 1996 1998 Cole et al 2000 Baugh et al 2002
As a consequence the hierarchical merging models HMMs predict

that massive systems should be very rare at z  1 with the comoving
density of Mstars  1011 M galaxies decreasing by almost an order of
magnitude from z  0 to z  1 Baugh et al 2002 Benson et al 2002
Several observations were designed over the recent years in order to
test such two competing models
One possibility is to search for the starburst progenitors expected at
z  2  3 in the monolithicPLE scenario In this respect submm
and mm continuum surveys unveiled a population of high-z dusty star-
bursts which may represent the ancestors of the present-day massive
galaxies see Blain et al 2002 for a recent review
The other possibility is to search for passively evolving spheroids to
the highest possible redshifts and to study their properties both in clus-
ters and in the eld This latter approach provided so far controversial
results
Because of their color evolution fundamental plane and stellar pop-
ulation properties cluster ellipticals are now generally believed to form
a homogeneous population of old systems formed at high redshifts eg
Stanford et al 1998 see also Renzini 1999 Renzini  Cimatti 1999
Peebles 2002 for recent reviews
However the question of eld spheroids is still actively debated It is
now established that old passive and massive systems exist in the eld
out to z  15 eg Spinrad et al 1997 Stiavelli et al 1999 Waddington
et al 2002 but the open question is what are their number density and
physicalevolutionary properties with respect to the model predictions
Some surveys based on color or morphological selections found a
decit of z  1  14 elliptical candidates eg Kaumann et al 1996
Zepf 1997 Franceschini et al 1998 Barger et al 1999 Rodighiero et
al 2001 Smith et al 2002 Roche et al 2002 whereas others did not
conrm such result out to z  1  2 eg Totani  Yoshii 1998 Benitez
et al 1999 Daddi et al 2000b Im et al 2002 Cimatti et al 2002a
Part of the discrepancies can be ascribed to the strong clustering hence
eld-to-eld variations of the galaxies with the red colors expected for
high-z elliptical candidates Daddi et al 2000a
Other approaches made the picture even more controversial For in-
stance Menanteau et al 2001 found that a fraction of morphologically
selected eld spheroidals show internal color variations incompatible
with a traditional PLE scenario and stronger than cluster spheroidals
at the same redshifts Similar results have been obtained with photo-
metric spectroscopic and fundamental plane studies of eld ellipticals
to z  07  1 eg Kodama et al 1999 Schade et al 1999 Treu et
al 2002 Such observations suggest that despite the mass of massive
spheroids seems not to change signicantly from z  1 to z  0 Brinch-
mann  Ellis 2000 eld early-type systems at z  05  1 do not

form an entirely homogeneous population some looking consistent with
the PLE scenario whereas others with signatures of recent secondary
episodes of star formation see also Ellis 2000 for a review
A more solid and unbiased approach is to investigate the evolution
of massive galaxies by means of spectroscopic surveys of eld galaxies
selected in the K-band eg Broadhurst et al 1992 and to push the
study of massive systems to z  1 Since the rest-frame optical and
near-IR light is a good tracer of the galaxy stellar mass Gavazzi et
al 1996 K-band surveys provide the important possibility to select
galaxies according to their mass up to z  2 The advantages of the
K-band selection also include the small k-corrections with respect to
optical surveys which are sensitive to the star formation activity rather
than to the stellar mass and the minor eects of dust extinction Once
a sample of faint eld galaxies has been selected in the K-band deep
spectroscopy with 8-10m class telescopes can then be performed to
shed light on their nature and on their redshift distribution Several
spectroscopic surveys of this kind have been and are being performed
eg Cowie et al 1996 Cohen et al 1999 Stern et al 2001 see also
Drory et al 2001 although mostly based on photometric redshifts
In this paper the main results obtained so far with a new spectro-
scopic survey for K-selected eld galaxies are reviewed concentrating
on the redshift distribution the evolution of the near-IR luminosity
function and luminosity density the very red galaxy population and
on the comparison with the predictions of the most recent scenarios of
galaxy formation and evolution H0  70 km s1 Mpc1 m  03
and   07 are adopted
2 The K20 survey
Motivated by the above open questions we started an ESO VLT Large
Program dubbed K20 survey based on 17 nights distributed over
two years 1999-2000 see Cimatti et al 2002c for details
The prime aim of such a survey was to derive the redshift distribu-
tion and spectral properties of 546 Ks-selected objects with the only
selection criterion of Ks  20 Vega Such a threshold is critical be-
cause it selects galaxies over a broad range of masses ie Mstars  1010
M and Mstars  4  1010 M for z  05 and z  1 respectively
according to the mean MstarsL ratio in the local universe and adopt-
ing Bruzual  Charlot 2000 spectral synthesis models with a Salpeter
IMF The Ks  20 selection has also the observational advantage
that most galaxies have magnitudes still within the limits of optical
spectroscopy of 8m-class telescopes R  25

The targets were selected from Ks-band images ESO NTTSOFI
of two independent elds covering a total area of 52 arcmin2 One of the
elds is a sub-area of the Chandra Deep Field South CDFS Giacconi
et al 2001 Optical multi-object spectroscopy was made with the ESO
VLT UT1 and UT2 equipped with FORS1 and FORS2 A fraction of
the sample was also observed with near-IR spectroscopy with VLT
UT1ISAAC in order to attempt to derive the redshifts of the galaxies
which were too faint for optical spectroscopy andor expected to be
in a redshift range for which no strong features fall in the observed
optical spectral region eg 15  z  20 In addition to spectroscopy
U BV RIzJKs imaging was also available for both elds thus providing
the possibility to estimate photometric redshifts for all the objects
in the K20 sample to optimize them through a comparison with the
spectroscopic redshifts and to assign a reliable photometric redshift to
the objects for which it was not possible to derive the spectroscopic z
The overall spectroscopic redshift completeness is 94 92 87 for
Ks  190 195 200 respectively The overall redshift completeness
spectroscopic  photometric redshifts is 98
The K20 survey represents a signicant improvement with respect
to previous surveys for faint K-selected galaxies eg Cowie et al
1996 Cohen et al 1999 thanks to its larger sample the coverage of
two independent elds thus reducing the cosmic variance eects the
availability of optimized photometric redshifts and the spectroscopic
redshift completeness in particular for the reddest galaxies
3 The redshift distribution of Ks  20 galaxies
The observed dierential and cumulative redshift distributions for the
K20 sample are presented in Fig 1 see Cimatti et al 2002b together
with the predictions of dierent scenarios of galaxy formation and
evolution including both hierarchical merging models HMMs from
Menci et al 2002 M02 Cole et al 2000 C00 Somerville et al
2001 S01 and pure luminosity evolution models PLE based on
Pozzetti et al 19961998 PPLE and Totani et al 2001 TPLE
The redshift distribution can be retrieved from httpwwwarcetri
astroitk20releases The spike at z  07 is due to two clusters
or rich groups at z  067 and z  073 The median redshift of
N z is zmed  0737 and zmed  0805 respectively with and without
the two clusters being included Without the clusters the fractions of
galaxies at z  1 and z  15 are 138424 325 and 39424 92
respectively The high-z tail extends beyond z  2 The contribution
of objects with only a photometric redshift becomes relevant only for

z  15 The fractional cumulative distributions displayed in Fig 1
bottom panels were obtained by removing the two clusters mentioned
above in order to perform a meaningful comparison with the galaxy
formation models which do not include clusters PLE models or are
averaged over very large volumes hence diluting the eects of redshift
spikes HMMs No best tuning of the models was attempted in this
comparison thus allowing an unbiased blind test with the K20 obser-
vational data The model predicted N z are normalized to the K20
survey sky area
Fig 1a shows a fairly good agreement between the observed N z
distribution and the PLE models with the exception of PPLE with
Salpeter IMF although such models slightly overpredict the number
 12 However if the photometric selection eects
of galaxies at z 
present in the K20 survey Cimatti et al 2002b are taken into account
the PLE models become much closer to the observed N z thanks to
the decrease of the predicted high-z tail According to the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test the PLE models are acceptable at 95 condence level
with the exception of the PPLE model with Salpeter IMF

ous line and the corresponding poissonian 3 condence region dotted lines The
PPLE Scalo IMF and the M02 models are corrected for the photometric biases
On the other side all the HMMs underpredict the median redshift
zmed059 070 and 067 for the C00 M02 and S01 models respec-
tively overpredict the total number of galaxies with Ks  20 by
factors up to 50 as well as the number of galaxies at z  05 and
underpredict the fractions of z  115 galaxies by factors of 24 Fig
1b Fig 1b bottom panels illustrates that in the fractional cumulative
distributions the discrepancy with observations appears systematic at
all redshifts The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that all the HMMs
are discrepant with the observations at  99 level The inclusion
of the photometric biases exacerbates this discrepancy as shown in
Fig 1b right panels for the M02 model the discrepancy for the C00
and S01 models becomes even stronger The decit of high-redshift
objects is well illustrated by Fig 2 where the PPLE model is capable to
reproduce the cumulative number distribution of galaxies at 1  z  3
within 1-2 whereas the M02 model is always discrepant at  3 level
up to  5 for 15  z  25 This conclusion is not heavily based
on the objects with only photometric redshifts estimates as the mere
presence of 7 galaxies with spectroscopic redshift z  16 is already
in substantial contrast with the predictions by HMMs of basically no
galaxies with Ks  20 and z  16

4 The evolution of the luminosity function
The luminosity function LF of galaxies has been estimated in the
rest-frame Ks-band and in three redshift bins which avoid the clusters
at z  07 zmean05115 see Fig 3 Pozzetti et al 2003 using
both the 1Vmax Schmidt 1968 Felten 1976 and the STY Sandage
Tammann  Yahil 1979 formalisms The LF observed in the rst two
redshift bins is fairly well t by Schechter functions A comparison with
the local Ks-band LF of Cole et al 2001 shows a mild luminosity
evolution of LFz out to z  1 with a brightening of about -05
magnitudes from z  0 to z  1 Fig 3 Similar results have been
found by Drory et al 2001 Cohen 2002 Bolzonella et al 2002
and Miyazaki et al 2002 see also Cowie et al 1996
The study of the LF by galaxy spectral or color types shows that red
early-type galaxies dominate the bright-end of the LF already at z  1
and that their number density shows only a small decrease from z  0
to z  1 Pozzetti et al 2003 This is consistent with the independent
study of Im et al 2002 based on morphologically selected spheroidals
Fig 4 shows a comparison of the observed luminosity function with
PLE and HMM predictions The PLE models describe reasonably well
the shape and the evolution of the luminosity function up to the highest
redshift bin zmean  15 with no evidence for a strong decline of the
most luminous systems with L  L This is in contrast especially
in the highest redshift bin with the prediction by the HMMs of a
decline in the number density of luminous ie massive systems with
redshift Moreover hierarchical merging models namely M02 and C00
result in a signicant overprediction of faint subL galaxies at 0 
z  13 This problem also hinted by the comparison of N z between
models and data is probably related to the so called satellite problem
egPrimack 2002
However it is interesting to note that at z  1 the HMMs seem not
to be in strong disagreement with the observations relative to the bright
end of the galaxy luminosity function with the possible exception of
the highest luminosity point Thus the key issue is to verify whether
the bright L  L galaxies in the K20 survey have the same nature of
the luminous galaxies predicted by the HMMs in particular for their
mass to light ratios MstarsL

of galaxies with 075  z  13 a bin dominated by spectroscopic
redshifts as observed in our survey to the predictions of the GIF1

that a relevant discrepancy is present between the two distributions
real galaxies with MK  5logh70  245 in the K20 sample have a
median color of R  Ks  5 whereas the GIF simulated galaxies have
R  Ks  4 and the two distributions have very small overlap Given
that red galaxies have old stellar populations and higher MstarsL
ratios the apparent agreement with HMM predictions of the z  1
bright end of the luminosity function Fig 4 is fortuitous and probably
results from an underestimate of the MstarsL present in the same
models This is equivalent to say that the number density of massive
galaxies at z  1 is underpredicted by HMMs and the predicted colors
ages and star formation rates do not agree with the observations

the global evolution of the galaxy population Indeed it is independent
of the details of galaxy evolution and depends mainly on the star
formation history of the universe Lilly et al 1996 Madau Pozzetti
 Dickinson 1998 Attempts to reconstruct the cosmic evolution of
the comoving luminosity density have been made previously mainly in
the UV and optical bands ie focusing on the star formation history
activity of galaxies Lilly et al 1996 Cowie et al 1999
Our survey oers for the rst time the possibility to investigate it in
the near-IR using a LF extended over a wide range in luminosity thus
providing new clues on the global evolution of the stellar mass density
Pozzetti et al 2003 Using the local luminosity density at z  0
as derived from Cole et al 2001 complemented with the estimates
at higher redshifts based on the K20 survey it is found that the rest-
frame Ks-band luminosity density up to z  13 is well represented by a
power law with z  z  01  z with   037 Compared to
the optical rest-frame UV-blue bands the near-IR luminosity density
evolution is much slower   39  27 from 028 to 044 m by Lilly et
al 1996 and   15 at 015-028 m by Cowie et al 1999 for m  1
The slow evolution of the observed Ks-band luminosity density suggests
that the stellar mass density should also evolve slowly at least up to
z  13 This is in agreement with a recent analysis by Bolzonella et
al 2002 see also Cowie et al 1996 and Brinchmann  Ellis 2000

6 Extremely Red Objects EROs
Extremely Red Objects EROs R  K  5 are critical in the context
of galaxy formation and evolution because their colors allow to select
old and passively evolving galaxies at z  09
For a fraction of EROs 70 to Ks  192 present in the K20
sample it was possible to derive a spectroscopic redshift and a spectral
classication Cimatti et al 2002a Two classes of galaxies at z  1
contribute nearly equally to the ERO population old stellar systems
with no signs of star formation and dusty star-forming galaxies

61 Old EROs
The colors and spectral properties of old EROs are consistent with 3
Gyr old passively evolving stellar populations assuming solar metal-
licity and Salpeter IMF requiring a formation redshift zf  24 The
number density is 63  18  104h3Mpc3 for Ks  192 consistent
with the expectations of PLE models for passively evolving early-type
galaxies with similar formation redshifts Cimatti et al 2002a HMMs
predict a signicant decit of such old red galaxies at z  1 ranging
from a factor of  3 Kaumann et al 1999 to a factor of  5 Cole et
al 2000 Preliminary analysis of recent HSTACS imaging shows that
old EROs have indeed spheroidal morphologies with surface brightness
proles typical of elliptical galaxies
62 Dusty star-forming EROs
The spectra of star-forming EROs suggest a dust reddening of EB 
V   051 adopting the Calzetti 2001 extinction law implying typ-
ical star-formation rates of 50-150 Myr1 and a signicant contribu-
tion  20  30 to the cosmic star-formation density at z  1 see
cimattitex 19112013 737 p11
Andrea Cimatti
also Smail et al 2002 A recent analysis based on their X-ray emission
provided a similar estimate of the SFRs Brusa et al 2002
The comoving density of dusty EROs is again  6  104 h3Mpc3
at Ks  192 The GIF simulations Kaumann et al 1999 predict
a comoving density of red galaxies with SF R  50 Myr1 that is a
factor of 30 lower than the observed density of dusty EROs
Such moderate SFRs suggest that the far-infrared luminosities of
dusty star-forming EROs are generally below LF IR  1012 L and
would then explain the origin of the low detection rate of EROs with
Ks  20  205 in submm continuum observations eg Mohan et
al 2002 see also Smail et al 2002 However the fraction of dusty
ultraluminous infrared systems may be higher in ERO samples selected
at fainter Ks-band magnitudes eg Wehner et al 2002
63 Clustering
Taking advantage of the spectroscopic redshift information for the two
ERO classes we compared the relative 3D clustering in real space
Daddi et al 2002 The comoving correlation lengths of dusty and
old EROs are constrained to be r0  25 and 55  r0  16 h1 Mpc
comoving respectively implying that old EROs are the main source of
the ERO strong angular clustering It is important to notice that the
strong clustering measured for the old EROs is in agreement with the
predictions of hierarchical clustering scenarios Kaumann et al 1999
7 Summary and discussion
The high level of completeness of the K20 survey and the relative set
of results presented in previous sections provide new implications for a
better understanding of the evolution of mass-selected eld galaxies
1 The redshift distribution of Ks  20 eld galaxies has a median
redshift of zmed  08 and a high-z tail extended beyond z  2 The
current models of hierarchical merging do not match the observed me-
dian redshift because they signicantly overpredict the number of low
luminosity hence low mass galaxies at z  04  05 and underpredict
the fraction of objects at z  1  15 Instead the redshift distributions
predicted by PLE models are in reasonable agreement with the observa-
tions It is relevant to recall here that early predictions of the expected
fraction of galaxies at z  1 in a Ks  20 sample indicated respectively
 60 and  10 for a PLE case and for a then standard m  1
CDM model Kaumann  Charlot 1998 This version of PLE was
then ruled out by Fontana et al 1999 The more recent PLE models
cimattitex 19112013 737 p12
Evolution of massive galaxies
and HMMs consistently show that for z  1 the dierence between the
predictions of dierent scenarios is much less extreme These results
come partly from the now favored CDM cosmology which pushes most
of the merging activity in hierarchical models at earlier times compared
to  CDM and SCDM models with m  1 structures form later in
a matter-dominated universe thus resulting in an even lower fraction
of galaxies at high-z and partly to dierent recipes for merging and
star formation modes which tend to narrow the gap between HMMs
and the PLE case eg Somerville et al 2001 Menci et al 2002 In
this respect the observed N z provides an additional evidence that
the universe is not matter-dominated m  1
2 The rest-frame Ks-band luminosity function shows a mild lumi-
nosity evolution up to at least z  1 with a brightening of about 05
magnitudes Signicant density evolution is ruled out up to z  1
Current hierarchical merging models fail in reproducing the shape and
evolutionary properties of the LF because they overpredict the number
of sub-L galaxies and predict a substantial density evolution PLE
models are in good agreement with the observations up to z  1
3 At odds with the HMMs the bright-end of the LF at z  1 is
dominated by red and luminous hence old and massive galaxies
4 The rest-frame Ks-band luminosity density hence the stellar mass
density evolves slowly up to z  13
5 Old passive systems and dusty star-forming galaxies both at z  1
equally contribute to the ERO population with Ks  192
6 The number luminosities and ages of old EROs imply that massive
spheroids formed at z  24 and that were already fully assembled at
z  1 consistently with a PLE scenario
7 Dusty EROs allow to select in a way complementary to other sur-
veys for star-forming systems a population of galaxies which contribute
signicantly to the cosmic star formation budget at z  1
8 HMMs strongly underpredict the number of both ERO classes
Overall the results of the K20 survey show that galaxies selected
in the Ks-band are characterized by little evolution up to z  1
and that the observed properties can be successfully described by a
PLE scenario In contrast HMMs fail in reproducing the observations
because they predict a sort of delayed scenario where the assembly of
massive galaxies occurs later than what is actually observed We recall
here that the discrepancies of HMMs in accounting for the properties of
even z  0  1 early-type galaxies have been already emphasized in
the past eg Renzini 1999 Renzini  Cimatti 1999 Moreover among
low-redshift galaxies there appears to be a clear anti-correlation of the
specic star formation rate with galactic mass Gavazzi et al 1996
Boselli et al 2001 the most massive galaxies being old the low-mass
cimattitex 19112013 737 p13
Andrea Cimatti
galaxies being instead dominated by young stellar populations This is
just the opposite than expected in the traditional HMMs where the
most massive galaxies are the last to form The same anti-correlation
is observed in the K20 survey at z  1
It is important to stress here that the above results do not necessarily
mean that the whole framework of hierarchical merging of CDM halos
is under discussion For instance the strong clustering of old EROs
and the clustering evolution of the K20 galaxies irrespective of colors
seem to be fully consistent with the predictions of CDM models of large
scale structure evolution Daddi et al 2001 Firth et al 2002 Daddi et
al in preparation
It is also important to stress that the K20 survey allows to perform
tests which are sensitive to the evolutionary modes of galaxies rather
than to their formation mechanism This means that merging as the
galaxy main formation mechanism is not ruled out by the present ob-
servations Also it should be noted that PLE models are not a physical
alternative to the HMMs but rather tools useful to parameterize the
evolution of galaxies under three main assumptions high formation
redshift conservation of number density through cosmic times passive
luminosity evolution of the stellar populations
Thus if we still accept the CDM scenario of hierarchical merg-
ing of dark matter halos as the basic framework for structure and
galaxy formation the observed discrepancies highlighted by the K20
survey may be ascribed to how the baryon assembly is treated and in
particular to the heuristic algorithms adopted for the star formation
processes and their feedback both within individual galaxies and in
their environment Our results suggest that HMMs should have galaxy
formation in a CDM dominated universe to closely mimic the old-
fashioned monolithic collapse scenario This requires enhancing merging
 2  3
and star formation in massive halos at high redshift say z 
while in the meantime suppressing star formation in low-mass halos
For instance Granato et al 2001 suggested the strong UV radiation
feedback from the AGN activity during the era of supermassive black
hole formation to be responsible for the suppression of star formation in
low-mass halos hence imprinting a anti-hierarchical behavior in the
baryonic component The same eect may well result from the feedback
by the starburst activity itself see also Ferguson  Babul 1998
In summary the redshift distribution of Ks  20 galaxies together
with the space density nature and clustering properties of the ERO
population and the redshift evolution of the rest-frame near-IR lu-
minosity function and luminosity density provide a new set of ob-
servables on the galaxy population in the z  1  2 universe thus
bridging the properties of z  0 galaxies with those of Lyman-break

Evolution of massive galaxies
and submmmm-selected galaxies at z  23 This set of observables
poses a new challenge for theoretical models to properly reproduce
Deeper spectroscopy coupled with HSTACS imaging and SIRTF
photometry will allow us to derive additional constraints on the nature
and evolution of massive stellar systems out to higher redshifts
