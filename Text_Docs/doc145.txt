ABSTRACT
We investigate the redshift evolution of the O iiiH  nebular emission line ratio for
a sample of galaxies spanning the redshift range 0  z  4 We compare the observed
evolution to a set of theoretical models which account for the independent evolution
of chemical abundance ionization parameter and interstellar-medium ISM pressure
in star-forming galaxies with redshift Accounting for selection eects in the combined
datasets we show that the evolution to higher O iiiH  ratios with redshift is a
real physical eect which is best accounted for by a model in which the ionization
parameter is elevated from the average values typical of local star-forming galaxies
with a possible simultaneous increase in the ISM pressure We rule out the possibil-
ity that the observed O iiiH  evolution is purely due to metallicity evolution We
discuss the implications of these results for using local empirical metallicity calibra-
tions to measure metallicities at high redshift and briey discuss possible theoretical
implications of our results

1 INTRODUCTION
In the local Universe thanks to the large statistical galaxy
sample provided by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS
key physical properties of the star-forming galaxy popula-
tion have been investigated for  105 galaxies For example
the position of the star-forming abundance sequence of lo-
cal galaxies in the O iiiH  vs N iiH  diagram Baldwin
et al 1981 hereafter BPT diagram has become well estab-
lished eg Kaumann et al 2003 Kewley et al 2006 This
abundance sequence is a key diagnostic of the physical con-
ditions in star-forming galaxies due to its dependence on
the global gas-phase metallicity distribution the stellar ion-
izing radiation eld and various properties of the ISM within
galaxies such as the geometrical distribution of gas and elec-
tron density see eg Kewley et al 2013a
Since the BPT diagram is constructed from the
strongest rest-frame optical emission lines most readily ob-
servable at high redshifts it is possible to trace the BPT

abundance sequence across cosmic time Therefore with new
ground-based multi-object spectrographs such as KMOS
Sharples et al 2013 and MOSFIRE McLean et al 2012
the BPT diagram is beginning to be studied with large sta-
tistical samples out to z cid38 22 eg Steidel et al 2014
Shapley et al 2015 Interestingly it has become apparent
that the BPT abundance sequence dened by local galaxies
evolves out to high redshift suggesting an evolution in the
physical conditions of star-forming regions Kewley et al
2013b Steidel et al 2014 Shapley et al 2015 Specically
from the growing sample of galaxies at z  1 an evolution
away from the local abundance sequence toward higher val-
ues of the O iiiH  andor N iiH  ratio is observed see
eg Kewley et al 2013b Cullen et al 2014 Holden et al
2014 Steidel et al 2014 Shapley et al 2015 Kewley et al
2015 for discussions Steidel et al 2014 have denitively
conrmed this abundance sequence trend using MOSFIRE
observations of 179 star-forming galaxies at z  23 show-
ing that these galaxies form a distinct yet similarly tight
locus in the BPT plane compared to SDSS galaxies see also
Shapley et al 2015 Masters et al 2014
The cause of the abundance sequence evolution is still
F Cullen
not fully resolved Kewley et al 2013a have investigated
theoretically how this evolution may be related to a change
in physical conditions in galaxies at high redshift They sug-
gest more extreme ISM conditions in high redshift H ii re-
gions will result in the abundance sequence at a given red-
shift being oset from the one dened locally However the
precise nature of these extreme conditions is still a matter
of debate Kewley et al 2013a show how the independent
eects of a harder ionizing radiation eld an increase in the
reservoir of ionizing photons more stars forming within a
given volume and an increasing electron density or equiv-
alently ISM pressure can shift the position of galaxies in
the BPT diagram in a similar way to that observed Kewley
et al 2013b conclude that star-forming galaxies at high
redshift are consistent with having some combination of a
larger ionization parameter larger electron density andor
harder ionizing radiation eld Steidel et al 2014 using
an independent model reach a similar conclusion and also
suggest that variations in the NO ratio at xed OH in
high redshift galaxies may also be responsible in part for
the observed shift in locus in the BPT diagram Sanders
et al 2016 argue that high redshift galaxies are consistent
with having the same ionization parameter as local galaxies
at xed metallicity and that the primary driver of the BPT
diagram oset is an elevated NO ratio at xed OH Most
recently Kashino et al 2016 have concluded that the line
ratio evolution is caused by a combination of an increase
in the electron density and ionization parameter where the
increase in ionization parameter out to z  17
In this paper motivated by the high redshift BPT
studies we investigate the physical conditions in high red-
shift galaxies by comparing the redshift evolution of the
O iiiH  nebular emission line ratio to theoretical models
of star-forming galaxies The advantage of focusing solely
on the O iiiH  ratio is two-fold Firstly the evolution of
O iiiH  is independent of any NO variations and thus
mitigates any problems related to the degeneracy between
evolving ionization conditions and evolving NO Secondly
it also allows us to extend the observed data out to z  35
beyond where the N iiH  ratio can be measured with cur-
rent instrumentation Recently Kewley et al 2015 have
shown that in the redshift range 02  z  06 the O iiiH 
rises by 02 - 03 dex and attribute this evolution to an in-
crease in the ionization parameter over this redshift range
due to an larger ratio of young to old stars in galaxies In
this paper we are able to extend the O iiiH  analysis
over a larger redshift baseline
Primarily we utilize an independent reduction of 3D-
HST survey data Brammer et al 2012 Momcheva et al
2015 to constrain the line ratio evolution in the redshift
range 13  z  23 With the 3D-HST data we are able
to account for any selection eects resulting from redshift-
dependent line luminosity thresholds the importance of
which has been recently highlighted in the literature For ex-
ample Juneau et al 2014 nd that using a sample of SDSS
galaxies it is possible to re-create the abundance sequence
oset at high redshift by applying increasing O iii and H 
luminosity cuts to the sample and emphasize the impor-
tance of comparing emission-line-luminosity matched sam-
ples when comparing local and high redshift galaxies see
also Cowie et al 2016 We address the issue of complete-
ness and selection biases in the 3D-HST sample in Section
2 Once these luminosity completeness eects within 3D-
HST have been accounted for we are able to supplement
these data with z cid39 35 observations from the AMAZELSD
surveys Maiolino et al 2008 Mannucci et al 2009 Tron-
coso et al 2014 and a sample of galaxies from Holden et al
2014
We then compare the evolution of the O iiiH  ratio
between the SDSS 3D-HST  and z cid39 35 samples across
 107 Gyr of cosmic time to the theoretical models intro-
duced in Kewley et al 2013a We describe how these mod-
els are applied in the context of the present work in Section
4 These models allow dierent scenarios for the physical
evolution of the star-forming regions with redshift to be dis-
tinguished Specically we are able to separate the eects on
the line ratio due to global evolution in metallicity ioniza-
tion parameter and ISM pressure The results are presented
in Section 5 Finally in Section 6 we discuss the practical
implication of the results with respect to accurately measur-
ing the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies at high redshift and
explore some theoretical interpretations of our results
Throughout we refer to the O iii5007 nebular emis-
sion line as O iii unless explicitly stated otherwise We as-
sume a cosmology with m  03   07 and H0  70
km s1 Mpc1
The data analysed in this paper are drawn from a variety
of separate star-forming galaxy catalogues across the red-
shift range 0  z  4 The objective behind this selection
is to sample the O iiiH  vs redshift relation across the
widest redshift baseline possible Below we describe the sep-
arate samples All datasets are cut to only include galaxies
with logMM  90 for consistent comparison with the
theoretical models described in Section 4
21 3D-HST
The primary dataset presented in this paper in the sense
that it is the largest dataset used to constrain the evolution
of the O iiiH  ratio at z cid38 1 is a sample of galaxies
drawn from an independent reduction of the 3D-HST survey
Brammer et al 2012 Momcheva et al 2015 Below we give
details of the 3D-HST sample selection and spectroscopic
analysis relevant to this study however see Cullen et al
2014 for a more detailed description of the data reduction
process
211 3D-HST sample selection
The 3D-HST galaxy sample is drawn from three of the ve
survey elds GOODS-S COSMOS and UDS and for the
analysis presented in this paper we only consider galaxies
in the redshift range 13 cid54 z cid54 23 where both the O iii
and H  lines are observable in the grism spectra All galax-
ies are selected visually from the reduced 2D and 1D spec-
tra in each eld In the visual inspection we check each
spectrum for contamination by nearby sources rejecting
emission-line spectra where the emission lines are severely
contaminated or the contamination model leaves clearly er-
roneous residual features in the continuum As described in
MNRAS 000 113 2016
Cullen et al 2014 we use existing CANDELS catalogues
for the GOODS-S and UDS elds as described in Guo et al
2013 and Galametz et al 2013 respectively For COS-
MOS we produce a custom catalogue the details of which
are described in Bowler et al 2012 Stellar masses for the
3D-HST galaxies are measured from rest-frame UV to mid-
IR photometry using the publicly available code lephare
Ilbert et al 2006 We run lepahre with solar-metallicity
Bruzual  Charlot 2003 templates assuming exponentially
declining  model star-formation histories with   03 1
2 3 5 10  15 30 Gyr and a Chabrier initial mass function
IMF The Calzetti et al 2000 attenuation law is used
to account for dust extinction with EB  V  values rang-
ing from 0 to 06 The age of the model is allowed to vary
between 005 Gyr and the age of the Universe at the spectro-
scopic redshift of the galaxy We remove AGN contaminants
and exclude galaxies with a  3 detection in O iii as de-
scribed below This leaves a nal 3D-HST sample of N211
galaxies down to a minimum O iii line ux of 12 x 1017
ergscm2s
212 Continuum and line ux tting
For each individual galaxy in the sample we rst t the con-
tinuum by masking the emission lines in the grism spectra
then using a least-squares minimization technique we nd
the best-tting normalization between the grism continuum
and the best-tting BC03 model returned from SED-tting
The normalized BC03 model is then taken as the continuum
of the galaxy and subtracted from the grism spectrum This
method of continuum subtraction accounts for the H  ab-
sorption in the stellar continuum through the BC03 models
We then t the O iii and H  line using a triple gaussian
function To estimate the errors on line measurements we
perturb each spectrum at each wavelength pixel by draw-
ing a random number from a Gaussian distribution with a
standard deviation equal to the error value in that pixel The
continuum and line ts are then performed on the perturbed
spectrum This process is repeated 103 times and for each
line O iii and H  the nal line ux and error is taken as
mean and standard deviation of the resulting distributions
213 AGN removal
The theoretical models for O iiiH  evolution explored in
this paper assume the ionizing radiation responsible for the
nebular emission has a stellar origin Therefore to facili-
tate an accurate comparison between models and data care
must be taken to account for the eect of AGN contamina-
tion in our sample Unfortunately the wavelength coverage
sensitivity and resolution of the grism spectra do not al-
low us to detect simultaneously enough emission lines to
use classical AGN diagnostic diagrams eg the BPT di-
agram Therefore the most reliable method for AGN re-
moval applicable to our sample is X-ray detection We use
the 4Ms GOODS-S Xue et al 2011 catalogue and 18Ms
COSMOS Civano et al 2012 catalogue to remove N17 X-
ray selected AGN from our sample We do not apply a com-
mon threshold to account for the dierent catalog depths
N1217 and N517 AGN were identied in GOODS-S
and COSMOS respectively We could not perform a simi-
lar selection in UDS due to the lack of a suciently deep

O iiiH  evolution between 0  z  4
X-ray catalogue We choose not to apply other optical emis-
sion line diagnostics for example the MEx AGN diagnostic
Juneau et al 2014 as the premise of this study is based
on investigating the idea that conditions in star-forming re-
gions become more extreme at high redshift Therefore by
using traditional optical methods we risk removing genuine
extreme star-forming galaxies from our sample Moreover
Coil et al 2015 nd that the MEx diagram does not ro-
bustly identify AGN at z  2 Moreover we nd that only
N16313 galaxies would be classied as AGN via the MEx
classication and have checked that removing these galaxies
has no eect on the nal results
In summary we have identied and removed N17 X-
ray selected AGN  5 of the original sample This is
slightly lower than previous studies at similar redshifts eg
Stott et al 2013 Zahid et al 2014 which nd  10 AGN
contamination Based on the number of AGN identied in
the GOODS-S x-ray catalogue and assuming a constant
number of AGN per unit area of sky we estimate that our
sample may be contaminated by  5 and 10 unidentied
AGN in COSMOS and UDS respectively These numbers
are also be consistent with the  10 contamination frac-
tion found in other studies Therefore we cannot rule out
residual AGN contamination in our nal sample primarily
due to the lack of a suciently deep X-ray catalogue UDS
and to insucient line diagnostic tools However we are
able to account for this residual AGN contamination in our
stacked spectra via a bootstrapping technique described in
Section 214 Moreover we have veried that removing the
N68211 UDS galaxies from our sample does not change
any of the results presented in this paper
214 Stacking procedure
To reduce the uncertainty in the measured line ratios due
to the lower signal-to-noise of the weaker H  line we must
stack the 3D-HST spectra Throughout this paper we stack
the galaxies in redshift space A redshift bin is dened and
within each bin the galaxy spectra were interpolated to a
common wavelength grid We then determine the inverse
variance weighted mean or median ux within each wave-
length bin across all the galaxies in that bin
We estimate errors on line ux measurements in the
stacked spectra by bootstrapping the data Any large scat-
ter induced by AGN contamination will also be accounted
for by bootstrapping For each stack we randomly select N
galaxies with replacement where N is the number of galax-
ies in the stack We then recombine the spectra and measure
the line uxes as described above This process is repeated
103 times and the ux and error are taken as the mean stan-
dard deviation of the nal distribution for each line
22 SDSS
When discussing the evolution of physical conditions in H ii
regions with redshift we require a comparison sample with
which to estimate values of a given parameter eg metal-
licity ionization parameter ISM pressure typical of galax-
ies in the local Universe For the local galaxy sample we
use a Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS catalogue contain-
ing N51262 star-forming galaxies from Zahid et al 2013
F Cullen
this sample of star-forming galaxies is selected in the redshift
range 002  z  012 with an aperture covering fraction cid38
20  to minimize aperture eects and with AGN removed
using the Kewley et al 2006 optical classication scheme
The emission-line uxes in this catalogue are taken from
the JHUMPA catalogues1 where the line uxes have been
corrected for underlying stellar absorption Stellar masses
for the SDSS sample are calculated from the SDSS ugriz
photometry as described in Zahid et al 2013
23 AMAZELSD
We utilize a sample of N40 star-forming galaxies at
3  z  4 median z  34 taken from Troncoso et al
2014 The data compiled in Troncoso et al 2014 were
taken as part of the AMAZE Maiolino et al 2008 and LSD
Mannucci et al 2009 surveys undertaken with the SIN-
FONI instrument at the VLT The galaxies were selected
to exclude AGN based either on their UV spectra X-ray
data or MIPS 24m ux see Maiolino et al 2008 for de-
tails We select galaxies from the Troncoso et al 2014
catalogue with a 3 detection in O iii The nal sample
contains N3340 galaxies
Troncoso et al 2014 did not perform a correction for
underlying H  absorption concluding the correction would
be negligible due to the non-detection of a continuum in
the majority of sources Stellar masses for this sample were
derived from either 14-band UV - Spitzer -IRAC photometry
or optical photometric data U G R I plus Spitzer IRAC
and MIPS bands This is the only sample with stellar masses
derived using a Salpeter IMF Salpeter 1955 so we convert
the quoted values to a Chabrier IMF Chabrier 2003 by
dividing by 18
24 Holden et al 2014
We increase the z  3 sample size using the Holden et al
2014 dataset consisting of N18 Lyman-break selected
star-forming galaxies at z  32  37 with O iiiH  ratios
measured using the MOSFIRE instrument on the Keck-I
telescope AGN contamination is ruled out based on the
rest-frame UV spectra and X-ray data Again no correc-
tion has been made for the underlying H  absorption but
again no spectra have reliably detected continua and thus
as argued by Troncoso et al 2014 the correction would
most likely be negligible We select galaxies from the Holden
et al 2014 catalogue with a 3 detection in O iii The -
nal sample contains N1518 galaxies In combination with
the AMAZELSD galaxies this gives a total of N48 galax-
ies at z  3 with a median signal-to-noise ratio of 4 in the
O iiiH  ratio
3 O iii LUMINOSITY COMPLETENESS
Before investigating the O iiiH  versus redshift relation
it is important to understand any selection biases present
in the above dataset which can aect the measurement of
line ratios As has been recently pointed out by Juneau et al

2014 any observed evolution of line ratios could be a result
of larger line luminosity limits at high redshift Cosmologi-
cal ux dimming will cause the minimum observable O iii
luminosity to increase with redshift and if O iiiH  cor-
relates with O iii luminosity an evolution to a higher ratio
with redshift could be an artifact of the increasing O iii
luminosity detection threshold
31 OIII luminosity evolution compared to
We rst explore how this aects any observed evolution
compared to galaxies in the local Universe Juneau et al
2014 nd using an SDSS sample of 300 000 star-forming
galaxies that by imposing a minimum line luminosity to
O iii and H  they can produce sub-samples in the SDSS
data that mimic the BPT evolution observed at z  1 For
the purposes of our results the implication is that as the
line detection luminosity threshold is increased an arti-
cial evolution towards higher O iiiH  is observed We in-
vestigate whether the luminosity of O iii correlates with
O iiiH  in our SDSS sample in Fig 1 We nd in agree-
ment with Juneau et al 2014 that the O iiiH  increases
with O iii luminosity

for the stack is taken as the median of the EB  V  values
for each individual galaxy in the stack derived from the SED
tting We assume an extra extinction for nebular lines fol-
lowing the Wuyts et al 2013 prescription It can be seen
from Fig 1 that even in the case of no dust correction our
sample lies at the extreme end of the SDSS sample in terms
of LOIII and O iiiH  Fig 1 indicates that a compari-
son of the 3D-HST sample to the total SDSS star-forming
sample will be biased by the line luminosity detection limit
of 3D-HST  Any observed O iiiH  evolution in this case
could simply be an artifact of the clear correlation between
LOIII and O iiiH  Instead we must take care to select
galaxies from SDSS with comparable LOIII To establish the
detection limit in O iii luminosity in the 3D-HST sample
we perform a set of simulations as described below
32 3D-HST simulations
We use the highest-redshift galaxies in our 3D-HST sample
z  2 to determine the O iii luminosity threshold of the
full sample By using only galaxies with LOIII above this
level we can minimize any completeness biases which are
introduced when comparing data at dierent redshifts To
determine this minimum O iii luminosity we run a set of
simulations using the software package aXeSIM a dedicated
simulation package for HST grism data We rst create syn-
thetic emission line spectra at z  215 median redshift of
the z  2 galaxies spanning O iii luminosities in the range
400  logLO iii  430 with O iiiH  5 which is ap-
proximately the average ratio for the stacked galaxy spectra
at z  2 These synthetic spectra are then injected into a
simulated G141 grism image with noise properties governed
by the input exposure time to the simulation
Once the synthetic grism images are created they are
fed through the same aXe pipeline used for reducing the
observed data and 1D spectra extracted in the same way
These spectra are visually inspected and either recovered or
rejected in an identical way to the real data From this we
estimate the recovery fraction as a function of logLOIII
and this is shown as the black solid line in Fig 2 From
the t to the recovery fraction shown in Fig 2 we infer
90 75 50 completeness limits at z  2 of respectively
logLOIII  4187 4177 and 4170 Also shown in Fig 2 are
the logLOIII distributions for the z cid62 2 purple hatched
histogram and z  2 orange lled histogram galaxies in
the sample normalized to a peak value of 1 It can be seen
that as expected a signicant fraction of galaxies at z 
2 fall below the detection threshold at z cid62 2 Therefore
for investigating the evolution of O iiiH  with redshift
in Section 5 we limit all samples to include only galaxies
at O iii luminosities brighter than the above completeness
limits Clearly our results will be most robust for the 90
completeness cut but it is also instructive to investigate how
dierent completeness limits aect the measurements
Another more subtle bias that could be introduced into
our data is the non-selection of galaxies with high O iiiH 
ratios at the lowest redshifts in the 3D-HST sample Such
a bias would articially decrease the average O iiiH  at

lower redshifts and could arise because the sensitivity of the
G141 grism falls o at shorter wavelengths For any given
redshift at a large enough O iiiH  ratio the H  line will
not be visible in the spectrum below a given O iii ux Due
to the decreased sensitivity at short wavelengths this ux
limit will be lower at lower redshift Without a visible H  it
becomes less likely the galaxy will be visually selected based
on the single line detection of O iii Therefore galaxies with
large O iiiH  may not be selected We run a further set of
simulations to check whether galaxies with O iiiH   5
typical of our z  2 galaxies would be visually selected at
z  15 The recovery fraction as a function of logLOIII is
shown by the black dot-dashed line in Fig 2 We nd that
above the completeness limit for z  2 galaxies discussed
above we are also complete in galaxies with high O iiiH 
ratios at the lowest redshifts in our sample
Finally we note that though our method of matching
samples by O iii luminosity provides the simplest way of
ensuring no articial evolution of the O iiiH  ratio it
would also be desirable to compare the evolution of the ra-
tio in bins of various dierent physical properties However
we have conrmed that these luminosity cuts do not produce
biases in the global properties of the SDSS sample with re-
spect to the z  2 galaxies Specically the median masses
of the SDSS and 3D-HST samples using the 90 threshold
are consistent logMMcid12  936 and 949 respectively as
are the median SFRs logMcid12yr1  092 and 083 respec-
tively The SDSS SFRs are derived from the H  luminos-
ity corrected for dust redenning using the H H  ratio

and the 3D-HST SFRs are taken from the best-tting SED
model Therefore by applying an increasing O iii luminos-
ity cut to the SDSS sample we are selecting a population of
low mass highly star-forming galaxies similar to those ob-
served at z  15 Nevertheless one way of extending this
analysis in the future would be to select samples at dierent
redshift matched in bins of various physical properties such
as stellar mass SFR sSFR etc We intend to explore this
topic in more detail in a future work
To summarize we run simulations to account for two
sources of bias in the 3D-HST sample i an increasing
lower limit to LOIII as a function of redshift ii possible
non-detection of high O iiiH  ratio galaxies at the lowest
redshifts To mitigate i we calculate the LOIII limit at
z  2 and apply this cut-o to all data which investigate
the O iiiH  evolution in Section 5 We also conrm that
above the LOIII limit imposed by this cut the 3D-HST
sample is still complete for large O iiiH  ratios at the
lowest redshifts
4 THEORETICAL MODELS
In Section 5 we compare the observed redshift evolution of
the O iiiH  ratio to models described in a companion
paper Kewley et al in prep The redshift evolution of the
O iiiH  ratio is derived by combining stellar spectral syn-
thesis and photoionization modeling of star-forming regions
with a prescription for the chemical abundance evolution of
galaxies with redshift We briey describe these models here
but refer readers to Kewley et al 2013ab and Kewley et
al 2015 in prep for a detailed description
To account for the evolution of the gas-phase chemi-
cal abundance a prescription is taken from the cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations of Dave et al 2011ab A 3rd
order polynomial is tted to the change in chemical abun-
dance logOH between z  3 and z  0 for galaxies
with M  109 assuming momentum-driven winds and is
given by
logOH  00013  02287z  00627z2
00070z3
This equation clearly assumes a mass-invariant metal-
licity change for galaxies with M  109 Mcid12 and this
may be a simplistic assumption However in Fig 3 we show
that this evolution is a reasonable parameterization of the
global metallicity evolution from z  0 to z  2 In this g-
ure we compare the the evolution in metallicity using data
from Zahid et al 2013 and Cullen et al 2014 where
since Eq 1 is independent of stellar mass the metallicity at
a given redshift is calculated as an average over all stellar
masses We take the line measurements from Cullen et al
2014 and re-calculate the metallicity using the Kobulnicky

To explore the evolution of the O iiiH  line ratios
with redshift four dierent scenarios are envisaged 1 no
evolution in the ISM pressure or ionization parameter ie
purely chemical abundance evolution 2 only the ISM
pressure evolves with redshift 3 only the ionization pa-
rameter evolves with redshift 4 both the ISM pressure
and ionization parameter evolve with redshift Specically
for the ISM pressure we assume a simple but extreme model
in which ISM pressure increases by two orders-of-magnitude
from z  007 mean redshift of the SDSS to z  4 In
an ionized gas with an isobaric density distribution the ISM
pressure is simply determined by the electron density Do-
pita et al 2006 and recent work has shown that by z  23
the typical electron density in H ii regions has increased by
one order of magnitude Shirazi et al 2014 Steidel et al
2014 Sanders et al 2016 Crucially it is unlikely that our
model underestimates the eect of ISM pressure evolution
The evolution of ionization parameter is modeled by an
order-of-magnitude increase in the same redshift range This
is consistent with recent measurements of ionization param-
eter out to z  3 Nakajima  Ouchi 2014 The equations

with further discussion of their motivation In each case the
reference values of ionization parameter and ISM pressure
for SDSS galaxies is derived using on those galaxies which
conform to the chosen O iii luminosity threshold
41 Ionization parameter denition
Conventionally the ionization parameter is dened as the ra-
tio of the number of ionizing photons passing through a unit
area of ISM per second divided by the hydrogen atom den-
sity The hydrogen atom density in a fully ionized plasma is
approximately equivalent to the electron density However
since we are separately constraining the ionization param-
eter and ISM pressure or electron density in our models
it is important to note that the increasing ionization pa-
rameter models represent an increase at xed ISM pressure
There are two ways to increase the ionization parameter in
this way Firstly the relative fraction ionizing photons can
be increased by assuming a hotter stellar population which
results in a harder EUV radiation eld Secondly the EUV
radiation eld can be scaled by for example having a larger
number of stars forming within a H ii region Detailed ex-
planations of these two eects are discussed in Kewley et al
2013a 2015 In our models we increase the ionization pa-
rameter by scaling the radiation eld and therefore the phys-
ical interpretation of a larger ionization parameter in this
work is an increase in the number of hydrogen ionizing pho-
tons incident on a unit area of the ISM per second due to
more stars forming within a given ISM volume
Moreover it is worth noting that since the prescription
for metallicity evolution given in Eq 1 is included in all mod-
els the increase in ionization parameter due to a decrease
in chemical abundance is naturally accounted for through
the choice of lower metallicity Starburst99 stellar evolution
models This anti-correlation between ionization parameter
and chemical abundance has been observed locally Perez-
Montero 2014 Sanchez et al 2015 and recently Sanders
et al 2016 have evidence for a similar correlation at z  2
Thus models 3 and 4 represent an increase in the ionization
parameter over and above that expected due to the decrease
in chemical abundance predicted from Equation 1
5 REDSHIFT EVOLUTION OF O iiiH 
We now compare the observed redshift evolution of the
O iiiH  ratio to the theoretical models described above
in each of the four scenarios The models are run for O iii
luminosity limits of logLOIII cid62 4187 4177 and 4170
as discussed above In the four main datasets we utilize in
the comparison SDSS 3D-HST  AMAZELSD Holden et
al 2014 we select the subset of each sample which adheres
to the luminosity threshold Fig 4 shows the O iiiH  vs
redshift relation for the four samples which when combined
span the redshift range 0  z  4 The SDSS data points
are not explicitly shown in Fig 4 but can be inferred from
the z  0 origin of all the models
Each panel in Fig 4 shows the results for each of the
dierent luminosity cuts in O iii In each panel the four
model scenarios are plotted where the initial ionization pa-
rameter and ISM pressure has been calculated for the sub-

set of SDSS galaxies which adhere to the stated luminosity
threshold For the 3D-HST data we measure the O iiiH 
ratio from both a mean and median stack in three redshift
bins as well as the mean and median of a stack of all the 3D-
HST spectra between 13  z  23 For the AMAZELSD
and Holden et al 2014 data we simply plot the mean and
median values of the individual O iiiH  ratios at the me-
dian redshift of the given samples All means are shown as
lled symbols and all medians are shown as open symbols
The rst result of note is that the data rule out the
model in which ionization parameter and ISM pressure re-
main constant solid black curve with only the metallicity
of H ii regions evolving with redshift Therefore an impor-
tant result of this work is that the evolution of the O iiiH 
line ratio for the luminosity thresholds applied cannot be
accounted for purely by the evolution of metallicity This
implies that the observed line ratios at high redshift are af-
fected by the evolution in other physical parameters in H ii
regions Importantly this observation is independent of any
variations in the NO ratio An evolving NO ratio has been
suggested by some authors in order to explain emission-line
ratios at high redshift particularly in reference to the BPT
diagram eg Masters et al 2014 Shapley et al 2015 Stei-
del et al 2014 Sanders et al 2016 This is not to say that
there is no NO evolution but rather that any NO evolu-
tion must occur simultaneously with an evolution of other
physical parameters
The data also strongly disfavour the model in which
ISM pressure evolves and ionization parameter remains con-
stant pink dashed curve For the most robust sub-set 90
completeness only one data point is within 1 of this model
and across all panels the data are consistently in better
agreement with either of the two remaining models Over-
all the Pk evolution model is not sucient to explain the
majority of measured line ratios and despite some of the in-
dividual measurements being formally consistent within 1
all are consistently systemically higher than the Pk evolu-
tion model prediction Moreover this model is clearly ruled
by the stack across the full redshift range of the 3D-HST
spectra
The remaining two models - ionization parameter only
evolution blue dot-dashed curve and ionization parame-
ter  ISM pressure evolution yellow dotted curve - are
both favoured and are dicult to distinguish with the qual-
ity of data currently available However this still permits us
to conclude from the models that at a minimum the ion-
ization parameter of H ii regions is evolving with redshift
To recall the ionization parameter is dened in our models
as the number of hydrogen ionizing photons incident on a
unit area of the ISM per second It is not at present possi-
ble to conclusively say whether this is accompanied by an
increase in the ISM pressure Particularly in the redshift
range 15  z  25 covered by the 3D-HST data the two
models are indistinguishable given the size of the uncertain-
ties The only notable exception is the 3D-HST stack across
the full redshift range for the logLOIII cid62 4187 threshold
nevertheless no strong conclusions can be made on the basis
of this one measurement At z  3 the models are more sepa-
rated however over all luminosity limits the AMAZELSD
and Holden et al 2014 data still do not allow us to robustly
distinguish between either scenario In Section 6 we discuss

ways in which this situation can be improved with future
observations
To summarize the data rule out the scenario in which
the evolution of the O iiiH  line ratio is driven purely by
metallicity evolution In addition they require an evolution
in the ionization parameter to higher values with redshift
This rise in ionization parameter may also be accompanied
by a simultaneous increase of the ISM pressure however the
data do not allow us to conrm or rule out ISM pressure

51 Comparison with the literature
In this section we compare our results to a selection of recent
observational studies which have also addressed the issue of
evolving physical conditions in star-forming galaxies at high
redshift
Sanders et al 2016 have investigated ionization pa-
rameter and electron density evolution of galaxies out to
z  23 based on a sample of  200 galaxies from the MOS-
DEF survey Kriek et al 2015 Via a comparison with lo-
cal galaxies across a wide range of line ratio diagnostic dia-
grams involving the O iii O ii3727 H  H  N ii and
S ii emission lines Sanders et al conclude that the typical
electron density and ionization parameter increases between
z  0 and z  23 Sanders et al argue that the evolu-
tion to larger ionization parameters is solely a result of the
lower metallicities of the high redshift galaxies and that the
ionization parameter of galaxies at xed metallicity does
not evolve with redshift In this scenario the evolution of
galaxies in the BPT diagram is primarily attributed to an
increase in the NO ratio at xed OH see also Masters
et al 2014 Shapley et al 2015 In terms of our models
the Sanders et al conclusions would correspond to the pink
dashed curve in Fig 4 This is clearly inconsistent with the
results presented here However while Sanders et al rule
out a scenario in which the ionization parameter increases
due to a harder ionization spectrum they do not investigate
case presented here in which the ionization parameter is
increased by scaling the ionizing spectrum
Kashino et al 2016 have analysed the excitation prop-
erties a sample of 701 H -selected galaxies at 14 cid54 z cid54 17
taken from the FMOS-COSMOS survey Silverman et al
2015 Using line ratio diagnostics based around the O iii
H  H  N ii and S ii emission lines Kashino et al have
concluded that the evolution of emission lines properties is
due to both higher electron densities and ionization param-
eters at high redshift Furthermore based on the suppres-
sion of the S iiH  ratio at xed O iiiH  compared to
local Universe galaxies Kashino et al conclude that the in-
crease in ionization parameter is caused by a scaling up of
the radiation eld as opposed to an increase in the hard-
ness in agreement with the results presented here However
Kashino et al do not measure the O ii3727 emission lines
and are therefore unable to comprehensively address the
NO at xed OH issue
At lower redshifts Kewley et al 2015 have measured
the evolution in the O iiiH  between 02  z  06 us-
ing a sample of galaxies from the SHELS survey Geller
et al 2016 Kewley et al conclude that the evolution of
the O iiiH  ratio at these redshifts is dominated by an
increase in the ionization parameter caused by a scaling of
the radiation eld ruling out either an increase in the hard-
ness of the radiation eld or an increase in electron den-
sity at these redshifts based on measurements of S iiH 
and the S ii doublet ratio respectively Kewley et al also
demonstrate that this evolution is independent of stellar
mass within the range 92  logMMcid12  106 Again the
Kewley et al results are consistent with the results presented

6 DISCUSSION
In this section we discuss some of the practical and theoreti-
cal implications of the results presented here as well as how
our ndings compare with results published in the recent
literature If the evolution in ionization parameter andor
ISM pressure in star-forming regions at high redshift is real
this will have important consequences both for how strong-
line ratios are applied in high redshift galaxies to measure
physical parameters and perhaps more fundamentally on
our theoretical understanding of the nature of H ii regions
and the stars that power them
61 Impact of ionization parameter on
metallicities inferred from strong line ratios
In Fig 5 we show an illustrative example of how failing
to account for an evolving ionization parameter will bias
metallicity diagnostics based on strong emission line ratios
We use two commonly adopted emission lines diagnostics
for the illustration R23  O ii3727 O iii5007H 
top row and N2  N iiH  bottom row The left-hand
panel in each row shows the metallicity calibration for four
dierent values of the ionization parameter taken from Kew-
ley  Dopita 2002 It can be seen that depending on the
value of the ionization parameter adopted the metallicity
solution can be signicantly dierent for both the R23 and
N2 diagnostics
This is explicitly shown in the right-hand panels of each
row where we show the dierence in inferred metallicity
12  logOH as a function of ionization parameter for
dierent values of the two line ratios2 The values of 12
 logOH are measured relative to a reference ionization
parameter value of logU32 typical of SDSS galaxies
Liang et al 2006 Kewley  Ellison 2008 Positive values
indicate that the metallicity inferred from the line ratio will
be overestimated if the typical SDSS ionization parameter
is assumed and vice versa The ionization parameter values
typical of current measurements of z  2 galaxies both from
the Cullen et al 2014 3D-HST spectra at z  2 and the
z  2  3 LBGs from Nakajima  Ouchi 2014 is shown as
the grey hatched region
Across the range of R23 and N2 ratios shown in the
gure the inferred metallicity for a given ratio becomes in-
creasingly oset with increasing ionization parameter For
the R23 ratio the dierence can be of the order 006 dex
at values of the ionization parameter typical of z  2 galax-
ies while for N2 the dierence is more pronounced with
osets of order -03 dex Clearly the N2 ratio will signi-
cantly underestimate the metallicity of galaxies at z  2 if
an ionization parameter typical of local galaxies is assumed
Interestingly most observational studies have concluded that
the N2 ratio overestimates metallicities by up to factor 3 at
high redshift eg Liu et al 2008 Newman et al 2014 Stei-
del et al 2014 This would suggest that other factors such
as increasing ISM pressure the presence of shocks andor
an evolving NO ratio may also be aecting this line ratio
at high redshift On the other hand the oset of the R23

branch logOH12 cid38 86 for simplicity

indicator is comparable to the estimated uncertainties due
to modeling inaccuracies  01 dex Kewley  Dopita 2002
however the R23 indicator suers from other signicant sys-
tematic issues namely the choice of upper or lower branch
and sensitivity to the dust correction Fig 5 illustrates how
not accounting for the ionization parameter of a galaxy can
have a large impact on the inferred metallicity particularly
for calibrations based on the N iiH  ratio We therefore
recommend that in order to obtain reliable metallicities at
high redshift ionization parameter and metallicity should
be simultaneously solved for
62 Improving the model constraints at high
redshift
As discussed in Section 5 with the data currently avail-
able at high redshift it is not possible to robustly dis-
tinguish between the models for ionization-parameter only
evolution and ionization-parameter  ISM pressure evolu-
tion It is perhaps worth illustrating how this situation can
be improved with future observations As previously dis-
cussed the theoretical curves are dependent on the luminos-
ity thresholds applied to the SDSS data as this determines
the reference values of ISM pressure and ionization param-
eter used as input to the models Fig 6 shows the model
evolution from z  0 to z  4 for two cases the top panel
shows the 3D-HST 90 completeness luminosity thresh-
old and the bottom panel shows the model evolution when
the full SDSS sample is used to calculate the initial values
of the physical parameters corresponding to logLOIII 
402 ergss
Fig 6 illustrates how raising the luminosity threshold
makes it increasingly more dicult to distinguish between
the models There is a much larger O iiiH  separation be-
tween the models when the lower luminosity threshold of full
SDSS sample is used Therefore deeper spectroscopic obser-
vation across a wider LOIII baseline will allow a more ro-
bust distinction between the two currently indistinguishable
scenarios Unfortunately SDSS-depth surveys at z  1 are
not currently possible Nevertheless state-of-the-art ground-
based near-IR surveys such as MOSDEF will able to improve
the situation by pushing down to 5 detections of logLOIII
 415 410 ergs at z  23 15 respectively Kriek et al
2015 Even deeper spectroscopic observations will then be
possible using future ground and space-based near-IR in-
struments such as JW ST and E-ELT

that the average star-formation rate of galaxies increases
out to z  2 and beyond eg Whitaker et al 2012 Pan-
nella et al 2015 if these stars form in similar volumes to
local galaxies there will be an excess of ionizing photons at
high redshift and consequently a higher ionization parame-
ter Such dense star-forming clusters are commonly referred
to as super star clusters They have been theoretically in-
vestigated see eg Elmegreen 1998 Hopkins et al 2013 and
have been observed in local dwarf galaxies and galaxy merg-
ers eg Shioya et al 2001 Woord et al 2014 However to
date no comprehensive statistical study of the ionization pa-
rameter in these clusters has been made nor any detailed
investigation into their prevalence at high redshift
The eective ionization parameter is also aected by
the geometrical distribution of the gas in HII regions for
example clumpy HII regions allow more ionizing photons
to escape and hence lower the eective ionization param-
eter Nakajima  Ouchi 2014 The dierence between a
radiation bounded HII region where the nebula ends where
hydrogen is completely recombined and a density bounded
HII region where the entire nebula is ionized by the stars
is also important In a density bounded HII region the O iii
zone closest to the star will likely remain unaected but
the Hydrogen recombination zone which extends to larger
radii could be shortened thus resulting in an increase in the
O iiiH  ratio Some evidence exists for density bounded
HII regions at high-z see Kewley et al 2013a for a detailed
discussion of the geometrical eects
7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have investigated the O iiiH  vs redshift relation for a
sample of galaxies in the redshift range 0  z  4 by combin-
ing data from SDSS 3D-HST  AMAZELSD and Holden
et al 2014 We have compared the O iiiH  evolution to
the theoretical models described in Kewley et al 2013a
that account for the eects of an evolving ionization param-
eter and ISM pressure in order to further understand the
evolution in the physical conditions of star-forming galax-
ies over the last  11 billion years of cosmic time We have
explored how line luminosity selection limits can aect any
observed trends and carefully accounted for these selection
biases in all datasets We have nally discussed some of the
practical and theoretical implications of the ndings Below
is a summary of the results
i We rst show using the SDSS sample that there is
a positive correlation between O iiiH  ratio and O iii
luminosity as pointed out by Juneau et al 2014 This
relationship could potentially bias any results since the ob-
served evolution of the O iiiH  ratio could simply be an
artifact of the increasing line luminosity threshold with red-
shift Therefore we conclude that the luminosity detection
limit of all samples must be carefully accounted for when
comparing to models of line-ratio evolution
ii We correct for any biases introduced from an O iii
luminosity detection limit by restricting all samples to galax-
ies with logLOIII  4187 4177 and 4170 corresponding
to completeness limits in the 3D-HST sample of respec-
tively 90 75 and 50 We show that after applying

oretical curves The curves are plotted as in Fig 4 The top panel
shows the models for the 90 completeness threshold used in this
paper and the bottom panel shows the case for the lower lumi-
nosity limit of the full SDSS sample logLOIII  402 ergss
It is clear from the gure how deeper observations will be better
able to dierentiate between models at all redshifts
63 Theoretical Implications
Finally we briey discuss some of the possible theoretical
explanations of the results presented here Since our data
favour models in which at least the ionization parameter in-
creases with redshift but cannot distinguish whether this is
also accompanied by a simultaneous increase in ISM pres-
sure we limit our discussion to the possible causes of a
higher ionization parameter
An increased ionization parameter requires from the
models an increased number of ionizing photons per unit
area per unit time incident on the ISM One way of achiev-
ing this is to scale the ionizing radiation eld by raising the
star-formation rate within a given ISM volume It is known

these luminosity thresholds the 3D-HST stacks are consis-
tent with an increase in the O iiiH  ratio at 13  z  23
relative to SDSS galaxies Therefore we conclude this evolu-
tion is real and unaected by the luminosity detection bias
highlighted in Juneau et al 2014
iii We compare the O iiiH  redshift evolution to the-
oretical models described in Section 4 based on the models
of Kewley et al 2015 in prep From these models we rule
out the possibility that the line ratio increase is a direct
result of metallicity evolution
iv We nd the observed line ratio evolution is best ac-
counted for by at least an increase in the ionization param-
eter with redshift In the context of our models this ioniza-
tion parameter increase is a result of scaling up the incident
EUV radiation eld Unfortunately the data cannot yet dis-
tinguish whether this ionization parameter increase is also
accompanied by an increase in ISM pressure These conclu-
sions are independent of the line luminosity limits imposed
v Finally we discuss how assuming an increase in ion-
ization parameter and ISM pressure at high redshift locally
calibrated metallicity diagnostics will be biased when ap-
plied to high redshift galaxies This highlights the need for
the proper treatment of other physical parameters and cer-
tainly the ionization parameter when estimating the metal-
licity of high redshift galaxies
