ABSTRACT
We introduce a novel technique for empirically understanding galaxy evolution We
use empirically determined stellar evolution models to predict the past evolution of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS-II Luminous Red Galaxy LRG sample without
any a-priori assumption about galaxy evolution By carefully contrasting the evolu-
tion of the predicted and observed number and luminosity densities we test the passive
evolution scenario for galaxies of dierent luminosity and determine minimum merger
rates We nd that the LRG population is not purely coeval with some of galaxies
targeted at z  023 and at z  034 showing dierent dynamical growth than galaxies
targeted throughout the sample Our results show that the LRG population is dynami-
cally growing and that this growth must be dominated by the faint end For the most
luminous galaxies we nd lower minimum merger rates than required by previous
studies that assume passive stellar evolution suggesting that some of the dynamical
evolution measured previously was actually due to galaxies with non-passive stellar
evolution being incorrectly modelled Our methodology can be used to identify and
match coeval populations of galaxies across cosmic times over one or more surveys
Key words galaxies evolution - cosmology observations - surveys
INTRODUCTION
The most recent observational evidence points towards a
model of structure and galaxy formation that is hierarchi-
cal in nature small uctuations in the matter density eld
grow via gravity with their dynamics being governed in
detail by dark matter and dark energy Baryons trace the
dark matter and in regions of sucient gravitational depth
they accumulate and form stars and galaxies White  Rees
1978 As the matter eld continues to evolve dynamically -
largely oblivious to this process - the stellar content of galax-
ies grows via a combination of two modes forming new stars
from cold gas and merging with other galaxies
LRGs are extensively used as cosmological probes eg
Reid et al 2010 Percival et al 2010 and are also inter-
esting from a galaxy evolution perspective as they domi-
nate the galaxy mass function at the massive end For these
reasons the stellar and dynamical evolution of LRGs and
early-type galaxies ETGs has been studied extensively see
Tojeiro  Percival 2010 Tojeiro et al 2011 - henceforth T11
- for a summary and list of references Studies that address
one of these growing modes however traditionally assume
a model for the other In this paper we propose and apply

a new methodology that solves for these two modes inde-
pendently In brief we use the fossil record of local galax-
ies to predict number and luminosity densities at past red-
shifts The dierences between the predicted and the ob-
served quantities under some simple assumptions can be
interpreted as a merger history
The idea of inferring the properties of galaxies at a
dierent cosmic time from the one they are observed at
and comparing them to the in-situ properties of galaxies at
those cosmic times has been proposed before Most notably
Drory  Alvarez 2008 use the galaxy stellar mass function
GSMF of galaxies in the FORS Deep Field Drory et al
2005 and estimates of the instantaneous star-formation rate
as a function of observed stellar mass to separate the evolu-
tion of the GSMF in terms of its merging and star formation
components Our approach diers from theirs in terms of
the observables we focus on number and luminosity densi-
ties as opposed to the GSMF but mainly in how we eec-
tively link the galaxies at dierent cosmic times We rely on
the fossil record of local galaxies to reconstruct their past
stellar build-up which we get from VESPA Tojeiro et al
2007 in a non-parametric way Drory  Alvarez 2008 use
parametric functions for the evolution of the GSMF and for
the instantaneous star-formation rate which they integrate
over past cosmic time to predict a mass build up due to
Tojeiro et al
star-formation only In other words we use present-day in-
formation to predict the past Universe whilst they use past
information to predict the present-day Universe Our recon-
struction of stellar mass build-up is less parametric but ar-
guably more dependent on the underlying stellar population
synthesis SPS models The two results are not comparable
due to the sample of galaxies studied but the approaches
are similar in terms of philosophy An approach more simi-
lar to ours was very recently presented in Eskew  Zaritsky
2011 where the authors use published estimates of the
past star formation histories of three local group galaxies
obtained using resolved stellar populations to infer where
these galaxies would sit in popular diagnostic plots at previ-
ous times in their cosmic history The work we present this
paper is similar in terms of concept but is vastly dierent in
terms of the size and type of galaxies used as well as overall
This paper is organised as follows in Section 2 we in-
troduce the data set we use in Section 3 we introduce our
methodology and in Section 4 we dene our observables We
present our results in Section 5 which we interpret and dis-
cuss in Section 6 We summarise and conclude in Section 7
Throughout this paper we use assume a WMAP7 cosmology
Komatsu et al 2011
The SDSS is a photometric and spectroscopic survey un-
dertaken using a dedicated 25m telescope in Apache Point
New Mexico For details on the hardware software and
data-reduction see York et al 2000 and Stoughton et al
2002 In summary the survey was carried out on a mo-
saic CCD camera Gunn et al 1998 two 3-arcsec bre-fed
spectrographs and an auxiliary 05m telescope for photo-
metric calibration Photometry was taken in ve bands
u g r i and z and Luminous Red Galaxies LRGs were
selected for spectroscopic follow-up according to the target
algorithm described in Eisenstein et al 2001 In this pa-
per we analyse the latest SDSS LRG sample data release 7
Abazajian et al 2009 which includes around 180000 ob-
jects with a spectroscopic footprint of around 8000 sq de-
grees and a redshift range 015  z  05
The target selection was designed to follow a passive
stellar population in colour and apparent magnitude space
and it targets LRGs below and above z  04 with two
distinct cuts Cut I targets low redshift LRGs by using the
following cuts
rp  131  ck03
rp  192
c  02
rp  242 mag arcsec2
rpsf  rmodel  03
where the two colours ck and c are dened as
ck  07g  r  12r  i  018
c  r  i  g  r4  018
Model magnitudes are used for the colours and pet-
rosian magnitudes for the apparent magnitude and surface
brightness cuts Cut II targets LRGs at z  04 following
rp  195
c  045  g  r6
g  r  13  025r  i
rp  242 mag arcsec2
rpsf  rmodel  05
Two separate cuts are necessary as the passive stellar
population turns sharply in a g  r vs r  i colour plane
when the 4000A break moves through the lters This bend
in the colour selection results in a broader colour range of
targets around it
3 METHOD
Our approach consists of tapping into the fossil record of
low-redshift z  025 LRGs to measure their stellar evo-
lution in terms of their past star-formation and metallicity
history out to z  045 T11 As discussed in T11 using
the fossil record allows us to explore past star-formation his-
tories in a way that is completely decoupled from the sur-
veys selection function Although the SDSS selection was
designed to follow a passively evolving stellar population it
is not true that all galaxies that pass the selection criteria
follow this model
With the full knowledge of how the selection function
of the survey changes with redshift we predict the number
and luminosity densities of LRGs at higher redshifts based
on low-redshift samples In the absence of mergers the pre-
dicted and observed number and luminosity densities should
match at high redshift In Section 6 we show how by mak-
ing a few simple assumptions the dierence between the two
quantities can be interpreted as a minimum merger history
31 Evolving galaxies back in time
For each galaxy we consider the past history and at which
epochs it would have been included in the survey To do this
we need to consider the following
i the stellar evolution of the galaxy
ii the selection function of the survey
iii changes in the photometric errors with redshift
For i we use the stellar evolution models for the LRGs
of Tojeiro et al 2011 and refer the reader to that paper
for full details of how these models were obtained For com-
pleteness we present a summary in Section 32
To account for ii we run the evolution of each indi-
vidual galaxy through the selection cuts of the LRG sample
see Section 2 and Eisenstein et al 2001 between the red-
shift of the galaxy and z  045 and we construct a vector
that tells us exactly when any individual galaxy would have
been observed within the survey were it to exist on our past
light cone at all epochs We call this vector Vobsz and we
set it to unity if the galaxy would have been observed at
that redshift and to zero otherwise
To incorporate the changing photometric errors iii
into our colour modelling we take the following steps First
we compute the average photometric errors in colour as a
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Disentangling star formation and merger growth in the evolution of Luminous Red Galaxies
function of apparent rband cmodel magnitude using all
LRGs in the sample Second for each galaxy we compute
the g  r and r  i osets with respect to their assigned
model at the redshift of the galaxy - note that these are
not expected to match as each cell used to compute the 124
stacks has a nite width in colour and redshift We then add
a term to their predicted colour evolution which keeps the
ratio between this oset and the typical observational error
at that redshift constant throughout its whole evolution For
example to predict the gr colour of a galaxy observed with
a redshift zobs at any other redshift z  zobs we compute
g  rpredz  g  rmodelz  g  r
grrz
grrzobs
where g  rmodel is given by the stellar evolution models
g  r  g  robs  g  rmodelzobs and rz is the pre-
dicted apparent rband cmodel magnitude at that redshift
When z  zobs this simply returns the observed colour and
the eect at z  zobs is to correctly match wider areas of
colour space at larger redshift with narrower cells at low red-
shift Note that if there was no change in photometric errors
with redshift there would be no need to widen the cells
32 The stellar evolution models Ke corrections
and absolute magnitudes
We follow Tojeiro  Percival 2010 to compute Ke cor-
rections and obtain Ke corrected rest-frame absolute mag-
nitudes - see Section 21 of that paper for details - with
two dierences First we do not assume the passive evolu-
tion model of Maraston et al 2009 but rather the stellar
evolution models of T11 which computed directly from the
fossil record of LRGs This allows us to proceed without
making any assumptions about this evolution - thus mak-
ing the results scientically very robust Secondly a conse-
quence of not wishing to make unsupported assumptions to
construct evolutionary models is that we cannot predict how
any galaxy would look like at z  zobs We therefore Ke
correct all galaxies to a redshift that is larger than the high-
redshift tail of our distribution and we choose zc  0525
made to coincide with one of the redshift nodes at which
the kE corrections are explicitly computed
There are many technical dierences between the mod-
els of T11 and Maraston et al 2009 eg Maraston et al
2009 uses broadband optical colours whereas T11 uses op-
tical spectra the tting philosophies are dierent For the
current work the primary dierence is that T11 uses the
fossil record of galaxies at a given redshift to infer their past
star formation history In contrast Maraston et al 2009
ts a model to the colours of galaxies observed over a range
of redshifts To do so they have to apply kE corrections to
all galaxies in order to construct a sample that is potentially
coeval The risk of such an approach is that the inferences
about the evolution of the sample reect the assumptions
used to dene it entered here via the kE corrections - they
only retained galaxies at a certain redshift that they predict
would have been observed at any other redshift given the
surveys selection function and the assumed stellar evolu-
tion model thus potentially considering a biased subsample
of galaxies In our approach however evolutionary colour
paths that stray from the colour selection box are accept-
able and crucially important for the results of our paper
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
In T11 we assumed that that LRGs do not necessarily
share the same stellar evolution or dust content and they
naturally allow for any intrinsic variation in LRGs according
to their luminosity observed r  i colour and redshift
Briey the T11 models are computed by running
VESPA Tojeiro et al 2007 2009 on 124 high signal-to-
noise stacks of LRG spectra constructed based on the ob-
served r  i colour luminosity and redshift of the galaxies
VESPA returns a star-formation and metallicity history as
well as a present-day dust content for each of the 124 stacks
These stellar evolutionary paths are turned into a spectral
energy distribution which can be computed at any redshift
larger than the redshift of the stack and provide any set of
colours magnitudes stellar masses or rest-frame luminosi-
An added subtlety lies in modelling the evolution the
surface brightness of the galaxy which is needed to fully
characterise the survey selection function This relies on
modelling the physical size of a galaxy with redshift Here
we simply assume the physical size of the galaxy does not
change with time and we let the apparent size change with
the angular diameter distance In practice we know this is
likely to be a simplication as a growing body of literature
discusses a potential size evolution of early-type galaxies see
the Introduction of Saracco et al 2011 and references within
for a summary These studies focus on the detection of a
population of compact early-type galaxies at z  1 with
eective radii a few times smaller than the eective radii
of their local counterparts of the same stellar mass eg
van Dokkum et al 2008 This does not seem to necessarily
be a problem theoretically as hydrodynamical simulations
show that minor mergers can act to increase the eective
radius of a galaxy by a factor of a few between z  3 and
the present day Naab et al 2009 Nonetheless the di-
culty in characterising the small samples and making the
measurements at high redshift as well as the detection of a
population of compact early-type galaxies in the local Uni-
verse eg Cappellari et al 2009 makes any realistic mod-
elling of the size of LRGs with redshift unfeasible Given the
small redshift range of our sample and crucially the small
number of objects that are discarded solely due to failing the
surface brightness cut  001 assuming no evolution in
the physical size of our LRGs has a negligible eect on our
results
4 MEASURED QUANTITIES
The statistics that we use to test the evolution of the galaxies
are the galaxy number and luminosity densities both as a
function of redshift As in Tojeiro  Percival 2010 we use
a proxy for the luminosity of the galaxy as L  10Mi25
where Mi is Ke corrected to zc  0525 and we work in
arbitrary units of luminosity density throughout
41 The observed quantities
We compute
nobsz 
Vz Xgz
Tojeiro et al
obsz 
Vz Xgz
where cg is an estimate of the spectroscopic completeness at
the location of each galaxy and corrects for the small frac-
tion of galaxies in the target sample that were not observed
Percival et al 2007 z is the width in redshift in which
nz and z are computed We sample nz and z in
around 50 bins between zmin  02 and zmax  045
42 The predicted quantities
We begin by dening a redshift range at low redshift that
we use to predict the number and luminosity densities to
higher redshifts This redshift bin which we denote zbase
contains galaxies with redshifts in an interval can be varied
in order to learn more about the evolution of LRGs For
each redshift greater than those in this bin we compute
npredz 
Vzbase Xgzbase
Vobsgz
predz 
Vzbase Xgzbase
Vobsgz
43 Rates of change
We dene a number loss rate as
rnz 
t cid181 
npredz
nobsz cid19 
where t  tz  tzbase and a luminosity loss rate as
rz 
t cid181 
predz
obsz cid19 
We can compute the average luminosity lost per galaxy
rgz 
t cid181 
npredzpredz
nobszobsz cid19 
This is also the best estimate for the true merger rate of the
galaxies that are the progenitors of the galaxies in zbase
assuming that any contaminants at redshift z have the same
luminosity distribution as the progenitors
5 RESULTS
In this Section we show our results for a selection of zbase
and magnitude ranges of local galaxies If the full sample
was made of a coeval population of galaxies changing these
values would have no eect on the derived merger rates
From previous work we know this assumption is likely to
fail on two accounts the targeting is less robust at z  02
as can be seen by the fact galaxies at these redshifts tend to
have small amounts of recent to intermediate star formation
and show an upturn in dust content Tojeiro et al 2011
and the fainter objects show stronger evidence of a non-
zero merger history Tojeiro  Percival 2010 As our stellar
evolution models are independent of the selection function
to larger redshift each of these two eects should become
apparent as we vary the magnitude and the redshift of our
local sample Our interpretation is presented in Section 6
Figure 1 The observed and the predicted number and luminos-
ity densities rst and second panel from the top respectively
Number density in units of 104 Mpc3h3 and the luminosity
density in arbitrary units and Mpc3h3 The observed values are
in black and the predicted values are in red for the number and
blue for the luminosity densities The shaded area shows the red-
shift range used to compute the predicted values The third panel
shows the loss rates in numbers red and luminosity blue given
by Eqs 9 and 10 Bottom the galaxy luminosity loss rate given
by Eq 11 All rates are in Gyr1
We begin by making no selection in luminosity and
comparing observed and predicted densities from galaxies
with zbase  020 022 in the top two panels of Fig 1
On the data side we see a roughly constant number den-
sity from z  023 to 033 an excess relative to this plateau
at z  023 a bump at z  034 and a steep decline on-
wards The roughly constant densities are a direct result of
the targeting algorithm which aimed to select LRGs up to a
xed number density by following a passively evolving stel-
lar population The fact that these are roughly constant can
in itself put some constraints on the dynamical evolution of
the sample Wake et al 2006 2008 The excess at low red-
shift is likely to be contamination to the sample where the
target algorithm has less distinguishing power The bump at
z  034 is a result of the widening colour cuts at that red-
shift as we move from cut I to cut II in the target selection
The steep decline after that is dominated by the apparent
magnitude cuts with the decline in the observed number
and luminosity densities being steeper than that predicted
from the low redshift data
The loss rates given by Eqs 9 and 10 are shown on the
third panel of Fig 1 and we combine the information in
all four observables to compute the merger rate or galaxy
luminosity loss rate given by Eq 11 which we show on the
bottom panel of the same Figure The merger rate is roughly
constant and of the order of 3-4 up to the point where the
sample is dominated by the apparent magnitude limit
In Fig 2 we show how the predicted quantities change
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Disentangling star formation and merger growth in the evolution of Luminous Red Galaxies
if we instead compute them from galaxies in dierent ranges
zbase Note that dierences in the predicted quantities in
the blue and red lines across the dierent plots provides
information about the nature and evolution of the galaxies
at each of the redshift intervals - this is discussed further in
Section 6
We can also investigate how the loss rates change with
the magnitude of the galaxies As all absolute magnitudes
are Ke corrected a at cut in Mi with redshift selects
the same population of galaxies in the absence of mergers
In Fig 3 we show how the observed and predicted quan-
tities change when we restrict the analysis to galaxies with
Mi  23 this corresponds roughly to the top 30 bright-
est galaxies in the LRG sample On the data side we see
many features in the redshift distributions disappear lead-
ing to a atter curve The exception is at low redshift where
the excess in density is still present We show the same red-
shift ranges of zbase as explored in Figs 1 and 2 Once
again the observed curves are the same across all four pan-
els with dierences in the red and blue curves holding infor-
mation on the evolution of bright LRGs We interpret and
discuss these results in the next Section
51 Errors
The errors quoted throughout this paper are Poisson and
assume that our ability to compare predicted with observed
quantities depends only how many objects we have available
to do so We account for the change in photometric errors
using Eq 4 which is folded into the predicted quantities
It is particularly hard to estimate the eect of errors
from the recovered star-formation histories on the computed
merger rates In T11 we presented an extensive analysis of
the errors see their Section 34 which we summarise here
for completeness There are two sources of errors that can
aect the recovered star formation histories from VESPA
photon noise which perturbs the spectra in way that we
assume we understand and systematic errors in models or
parametrization which are the result of our imperfect ability
to correctly model certain stages of stellar evolution chem-
ical enrichment or dust extinction The former is easily es-
timated via a Monte Carlo approach that we explain in
Tojeiro et al 2009 In this case we are in the regime of
extremely high signal-to-noise spectra and photon error is
negligible In order to understand systematic errors in T11
we estimated these using the residuals of the best t solution
to the data see their Fig 3 - we found these errors to be
at least 10 times larger We use this error vector to obtain
the SFHs used in the current analysis
The eect of the uncertainties in the SFH on the mea-
sured rates comes from how many galaxies leave the surveys
selection window as a function of redshift and how bright
they are The window function of the survey is designed
to follow a passive evolution so only star-formation histo-
ries that depart signicantly from this model will aect the
rates An episode of recent to intermediate star formation of
anything larger than 5 by mass is enough to take galax-
ies out of the survey box for up to and around 1Gyr the
exact number depends on the length of episode the Stel-
lar Population Synthesis SPS models used the metallicity
and the exact age of the burst and even though none of our
formal error estimates allow for a discrepancy of this size
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
solutions obtained with dierent SPS models can dier by
a few times this amplitude - we explicitly address the eect
of using dierent SPS models in our results in Section 64
The eect on the merger rate in turn depends on how
many galaxies are removed from the sample Our assumption
in T11 is that all galaxies within a cell follow the SFH given
by the stack that represents that cell Each of our zbase
samples is typically represented by 4 to 12 stacks depend-
ing on the luminosity range of the sample and if one stack
predicts a signicant star-formation event  5 by mass
then 112 to 14 of the galaxies will be predicted to leave the
sample for a signicant period This means that the eect
on the merger rates are somewhat quantised rather than a
smooth function of an error in the SFHs The eect can ob-
viously be quite dramatic and at its extreme it can predict
that almost all galaxies would leave the sample suggesting
that the observed red sequence is an intricate combination of
galaxies becoming red and blue throughout cosmic history
see Section 64 for an example
6 DISCUSSION
61 Interpreting the observables
If the sample of SDSS-II LRGs was not aected by mergers
and assuming the SFHs are correct see Section 51 then
the observed luminosity and the number densities would ob-
viously match the extrapolated values Any deviations from
this implies merger activity andor a non-zero net ow of
galaxies into the sample We cannot determine a balance
between mergers into and out of the sample However by
comparing number and luminosity evolution we can start to
understand the evolution that we do see
Fig 4 shows schematically the simplest interpretation
for three scenarios
a npred  nobs and pred  obs - the simplest inter-
pretation is that galaxies within the sample have merged
together to decrease the predicted number density of ob-
jects whilst retaining the sample luminosity This assumes
no luminosity loss to the intra-cluster medium
b shows how contamination from objects at a given red-
shift could also act to give npred  nobs in the same way
as internal mergers By contaminants here we refer to ob-
jects that would enter the sample for a short time only and
do not evolve to be present in the sample at low redshift
However the comparison between obs and pred helps to
dierentiate the two scenarios as in this case we expect the
excess in the observed number density due to contamination
to be matched by an excess of luminosity density The two
excesses will be matched in amplitude provided the contami-
nants have the same luminosity function as the galaxies that
evolve through the sample
c npred  nobs and pred  obs This scenario requires
an enrichment of the sample towards lower redshift - ei-
ther by the merging of fainter galaxies becoming brighter
and crossing over the faint magnitude cuts bluer galaxies
turning redder and crossing over the colour cuts or a com-
bination of both
Note that in the case of fainter galaxies merging together to
become brighter and entering the sample by crossing over

Disentangling star formation and merger growth in the evolution of Luminous Red Galaxies
shown in Fig 1 we see the predicted number and luminos-
ity densities both fall short of the observed values up to
z  038 suggesting a combination of scenarios a and b
The bump at z  034 is not reproduced by the stellar evo-
lution of present-day galaxies strongly suggesting that is it
caused by contamination of galaxies as the colour cuts widen
- in other words the wider breadth of colour in the sample
at those redshifts is not predicted by the stellar evolution of
more local galaxies Therefore the signal here is likely dom-
inated by scenario b Finally the sample of local galaxies
predicts a much shallower slope in the number densities as
we go towards higher redshifts suggesting that they were
still being assembled in a dynamical sense at those epochs
- in other words had the local galaxies still be in one piece
at z  04 they would have been bright enough to be in the
sample This puts us in a regime likely to be dominated by
scenario c at these high redshifts
Moreover at the high-redshift tail where scenario c
dominates we note that the number loss rate is higher in
amplitude than the luminosity loss rate In other words
the typical luminosity per object at z  038 is lower than
expected This suggests that the LRG growth due to ex-
ternal merging is happening predominantly at the fainter
end of the sample We will investigate this hypothesis fur-
ther in Section 622 Note that if this growth was constant
with luminosity then both loss rates would have a negative
value but would be matched in amplitude - resulting in a
zero galaxy luminosity loss rate interpreted in this case as
a zero internal merger rate
621 Changing zbase
We now consider the eect of changing the low redshift inter-
vals zbase from which we infer the galaxy evolution from
high redshift as shown in Fig 2 Changes in the inferred
loss and merger rates as we change our low-redshift sample
are sensitive to dierences in the low redshift population of
galaxies
We nd no signicant dierence in the evolution of
galaxies observed between z  023 and z  027 - see the
rst two panels of Fig 2 - but comparing the rate of lumi-
nosity loss per galaxy lower panels in the gures to those
in Fig 1 suggests that the lower redshift galaxies experi-
ence a more pronounced growth This is consistent with a
hypothesis in which the low redshift end of the sample is
not as pure as the rest of the sample - the targeting algo-
rithm is less robust at these redshifts Eisenstein et al 2001
Tojeiro et al 2011 Furthermore the sample will naturally
be more enriched towards fainter galaxies which could have
a dierent growth rate - see Section 622 for more details
Similarly galaxies observed at redshifts between 033
and 035 are seen to have a dierent growth compared with
galaxies at lower redshifts This is not unexpected as the
bump in number and luminosity density at z  034 is not
predicted by galaxies at low redshifts These results suggest
that the wider colour selection of cut II selects galaxies not
only with a dierent stellar evolution but also a dierent
merger growth rate - essentially a dierent population of
galaxies For the same reasons as before we argue that this
growth must be happening predominantly at the faint end
Figure 4 Diagram of possible interpretations for discrepancies in
the observed and predicted quantities The middle column shows
the observed luminosity and number densities The solid arrows
show the prediction given by the stellar evolution from VESPA
and the surveys window function and they lead to the left hand
side column that shows the predicted luminosity and number den-
sities Note that whereas VESPA can only predict changes in the
luminosity density the window function can also aect the num-
ber densities The window function is fully known and introduces
no ambiguity when computing the predicted quantities - in here
we show the numbers being conserved just for simplicity The
right hand side column shows the observed number and lumi-
nosity densities and the dotted arrows represent our proposed
interpretation See Section 61 for more details
the magnitude cuts scenarios a and c represent the same
physical process - the only dierence between is where the
surveys magnitude cut lies We explore this fact in a little
more detail in Section 63
Obviously we can expect multiple scenarios such as
those in Fig 4 to happen simultaneously If this is the case
under the assumption that the luminosity function of the
contaminants matches that of the objects in the sample and
that luminosity is conserved in a merger event Eq 11 gives
the best estimate for the merger rate required for galaxies
within the sample between z and zbase In fact even
if these assumptions are broken Eq 11 still acts as a lower
limit on the true merger rate This is mostly easily seen from
Equation 11 - we are eectively under-estimating pred as
some luminosity has been lost to the intracluster medium
resulting in an under-estimation of rg
62 Interpreting the results
Using the results of Section 5 we can identify redshift inter-
vals that are likely to be dominated by each of the scenarios
shown in Fig 4 Starting with the results for all LRGS

622 Changing the luminosity
In Fig 3 we restrict our analysis to galaxies with a Ke cor-
rected Mi  23 which corresponds roughly to the bright-
est third of the galaxies in the sample We show results for
the same four ranges of zbase as before It is immediately
clear that a lot of the features in the observed quantities
are less pronounced - the bump at z  034 almost dis-
appears and the high-redshift tail attens out as we re-
strict ourselves to what is close to magnitude-limited sam-
ple colour cuts excluded The exception is the bump at
low redshifts which combined with the measured loss and
merger rates for zbase  020 022 suggests the luminous
galaxies observed at low redshift are still growing and this
growth is approximately matches that of lower luminosity
objects Clearly this also ts with the hypothesis that the
lower redshift galaxies form a population with more dynam-
ical evolution than the higher redshift galaxies within the
sample
For all other cases of zbase we nd a picture that is
consistent with passive dynamical growth with the only -
and marginal - evidence for external growth coming for the
galaxies in zbase  033 035 perhaps suggesting that
not even the brightest galaxies are purely coeval across the
two LRG colour cuts described in Section 2
63 Probing the typical luminosity of mergers
We noted in Section 61 that scenarios a and c represent
the same physical merger process but can be distinguished
as c caused objects to cross the apparent magnitude cut on
the sample In Section 62 we suggested than c dominates
at high redshift while a dominates at low redshift We can
use the information available to dene a typical luminosity
for the dominant merger process happening
For each case of zbase we take the redshift at which
the number and luminosity loss rates cross the zero line and
compute the absolute magnitude that would correspond to
the apparent petrosian magnitude equal to the surveys limit
of rp  195 - in other words the faintest absolute magnitude
observed at that redshift These are the galaxies that are
beginning to enter the sample when dynamical growth tran-
sitions from external to internal Note that the two growth
rates change sign at very similar epochs so we can use ei-
ther without signicant eect on our results In Fig 5 we
show how this transitional absolute magnitude changes for
the four dierent cases of zbase those shown in Figs 1 and
Once again our result is that the dynamical growth is
happening predominantly at the faint end for galaxies ob-
served in all the four intervals of zbase we studied
64 Robustness to SPS models
In Tojeiro et al 2011 we showed how the measured stellar
evolution of LRGs depends on the SPS models used - see Fig
6 in that paper for a summary of the dierences The results
presented in this paper thus far assume the stellar and colour
evolution given by the Flexible Stellar Population Synthe-
sis FSPS models of Conroy et al 2009 Conroy  Gunn
2010 which gave better ts to the spectral data and re-
sulted in the more passive stellar evolution model in our
Figure 5 The dots show the transitional absolute magnitude as
a function of zbase on the right-hand side y-axis - see Sec-
tion 63 This is the absolute r  band magnitude that corre-
sponds to the rp  195 cut on petrosian magnitude of cut II
Eisenstein et al 2001 at the redshifts for which we infer a tran-
sition from external to external growth For context we also show
the distribution of absolute magnitudes of galaxies in the sample
on the left-hand side y-axis
previous study However as we could not conclusively de-
cide which set of SPS models gives a more accurate descrip-
tion of the real stellar evolution of LRGs in this section
we discuss how the stellar evolution given by other models
would change the interpretation given above The results on
the recovered merger rate and interpretation of the dynam-
ical evolution can be dramatically aected by events of star
formation
In the case of the Maraston et al 2011 models M10
submitted the amount of recent to intermediate star for-
mation dominates only in galaxies at z  03 The resulting
interpretation is that contamination of the LRG sample ex-
tends to a larger redshift than what would be assumed using
the FSPS models and that these local galaxies are not the
evolutionary products of the LRGs observed at higher red-
shifts At z  03 however the recovered dynamical evolu-
tion is qualitatively similar to that obtained with the FSPS
models although with slightly larger rates
The interpretation using the stellar evolution given by
the models of Bruzual  Charlot 2003 BC03 however
is incompatible with the hypothesis that the LRGs form a
coeval population of galaxies since z  045 The signicant
and continuous with redshift amount of recent to interme-
diate star formation lead to a consistently under-prediction
of the number and luminosity densities at high redshifts from
more local samples in a way that is only explained by a con-
tinuous amount of contamination in the sample
65 Comparison with previous results
The results in this paper are in qualitative agreement with
those in Tojeiro  Percival 2010 where we used the lu-
minosity weighted power-spectrum to argue that the LRG
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Disentangling star formation and merger growth in the evolution of Luminous Red Galaxies
population is growing via external mergers at the faint end
Quantitatively however the rates we nd in this paper are
lower by roughly a factor of two The main dierence be-
tween the two approaches lies on the treatment of the stellar
evolution - whilst in Tojeiro  Percival 2010 we assumed
that the passive stellar evolution model of Maraston et al
2009 was suitable for all galaxies in the sample in here
we instead use the stellar evolution models of Tojeiro et al
2011 which use the fossil record of LRGs of dierent colour
luminosity and redshift to infer the most-likely stellar evolu-
tion Furthermore in Tojeiro  Percival 2010 we assumed
that the scatter in colour and magnitude was due to intrin-
sic or photometric errors which is a byproduct of assuming
that all LRGs in the sample share the same stellar evolution
Instead the analysis presented in this paper makes no such
assumption and is robust to an inux andor an outux of
objects if we interpret the measured rates as a lower limit
It is the independent treatment of the stellar evolution and
the detailed comparison of predicted with observed quanti-
ties that allows us to make an assessment on the nature of
the mergers without the need for a clustering analysis
Comparisons with other works is less trivial due to the
typically dierent samples used We refer the reader to Sec-
tion 8 of Tojeiro  Percival 2010 for a summary of recent
results and comparison We continue to argue that merg-
ing at the faint end of the LRG population is a more likely
explanation published for the published evidence for both

7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have demonstrated how we can use the fossil
record of galaxies to extrapolate from low redshift samples
to match samples selected at higher redshift By compar-
ing against the observed number and luminosities we can
measure growth and consider where the dynamical evolu-
tion of galaxies is required We have applied this technique
to consider the dynamical evolution of galaxies in the SDSS-
II LRG sample although the technique could be used to link
dierent surveys at low and high redshift
For the SDSS-II LRG sample we have previously pre-
dicted the stellar evolution in Tojeiro et al 2011 by us-
ing the fossil record encoded in the spectra of LRGs This
allowed us to compute the most likely stellar evolution of
observed LRGs in a way that was decoupled from the sur-
veys selection function We used this information to make
predictions on the number and luminosity of LRGs at higher
redshift from a local sample of galaxies and we showed how
dierences in these quantities can be interpreted as a mini-
mum merger rate Our main conclusions can be summarised
as the two following points
 the LRG population is not purely coeval with some of
galaxies targeted at z  022 and at z  034 showing dif-
ferent dynamical growth than galaxies targeted throughout
the sample
Based on these results we argue that a coeval popu-
lation of galaxies that has been dynamically passive to less
than 1-2 can be robustly selected from the LRG sample by
imposing a cut on the Ke corrected absolute magnitude
and by selecting galaxies with z  023 045 This merger
rate is lower than those previously measured by roughly a
factor of two because by using empirically determined evo-
lutionary tracks we no longer need to assume passive evolu-
tion and this previously led to incorrect evolutionary tracks
for some galaxies
We caution against interpreting these results beyond
the limits of the stellar population models and once again
stress the important of good models and statistically good
ts for analyses of this type However given the power in-
herent in the type of approach and improvements in SPS
modelling due in the future we consider this analysis to be
a forerunner of signicant future work
