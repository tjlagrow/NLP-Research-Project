Recent research shows that Hawking radiation can be treated as a quantum tun-
nelling process and Hawking temperature of Dirac particles across the horizon of a
black hole can be correctly recovered via fermions tunnelling method In this paper
motivated by fermions tunnelling method we attempt to apply the analysis to de-
rive Hawking radiation of Dirac particles via tunnelling from black ring solutions of
5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity theory Finally it is interesting to
nd as in black hole cases fermions tunnelling can also result in correct Hawking
temperatures for the rotating neutral dipole and charged black rings

INTRODUCTION
Since Hawking had proved that a black hole can radiate particles characterized by the
thermal spectrum with the temperature T  12 where  is the surface gravity of the
black hole many papers appear to correctly derive Hawking temperature via dierent meth-
ods such as gravity collapsing method1 temperature Green function2 path integral3
Euclidean action integral4 second quantum method5 renormalization energy-momentum
tensor6 and more recently developed technique called generalized tortoise coordinate trans-
formationGTCT to deal with Hawking radiation of an evaporating black holes7 8 etc
The study of Hawking radiation has long been attracted a lot of attentions of theoretical
physicists The reason is partly due to the fact that a deeper understanding of Hawking
radiation may shed some lights on seeking the underlying quantum gravity and on the other
hand it is the key to make the second law of thermodynamics in spacetimes involving black
holes consistent

In recent years a semi-classical quantum tunnelling method rst put forward by Kraus
and Wilczek9 and then elaborated by Parikh and Wilczek10 has already attracted many
peoples attentions 11 12 Here derivation of Hawking temperature mainly depends on
the computation of the imaginary part of the action for the classically forbidden process
of s-wave emission across the horizon Normally there are two approaches to obtain the
imaginary part of the action One rst used by Parikh and Wilczek10 and later broadly
discussed by many papers11 12 is called as the Null Geodesic method where the con-
tribution to the imaginary part of the action only comes from the integration of the radial
momentum pr for the emitted particles The other method regards the action of the emitted
particles satises the relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi equation and solving it yields the imagi-
nary part of the action13 which is an extension of the complex path analysis proposed by
Padmanabhan et al14 In the two tunnelling modes they use the fact that the tunnelling
rate for the classically forbidden trajectory from inside to outside the horizon is given by
  exp  2
Where these two methods dier is in how the action is calculated Ref15 has given a
ImI where I is the classical action of the trajectory to leading order in 
detailed comparison between the Hamilton-Jacobi ansatz and the Null Geodesic method
Although the tunnelling method is shown very robust to successfully derive Hawking
radiation of black holes and even black rings most papers have only considered scalar
particles tunnelling radiation
In fact a black hole can radiate all types of particles at
the Hawking temperature and the true emission spectrum should contain contributions
of both scalar particles and fermions with all spins Recently applications of quantum
tunnelling methods to fermions case has rst been presented in Ref16 to correctly describe
Hawking radiation of fermions with spin 12 via tunnelling from Rindler space-time and
that from the uncharged spherically symmetric black holes Later to further prove the
robustness of fermions tunnelling method some papers appear to discuss Hawking radiation
of fermions via tunnelling from BTZ black hole17 dynamical black hole18 Kerr black
hole19 Kerr-Newman black hole20 and more general and complicated black holes21
These involved black holes share in taking 3 or 4dimensional spacetimes For spacetimes
with dierent horizon topology and dierent dimensions choosing a set of appropriate 
matrices for general covariant Dirac equation is critical for fermions tunnelling method In
3-dimensional cases as the Pauli matrices ii  1 2 3 behave independent each other we
can only introduce the matrices i to act as  functions for the covariant Dirac equation 17
However for 4-dimensional spacetimes we need four independent matrices to well describe
the matrices  for the Dirac equation and a detailed choice for the four matrices  see
Refs16 18 19 20 21 Then how to choose the  matrices for 5-dimensional cases To
the best of our knowledge ve independent matrices should be involved in our discussion
On the other hand the horizon topology also has an important impact on the choice for
the matrices 20 In SecII and III we will successfully introduce a set of appropriate
matrices  for the 5-dimensional neutral dipole and charged black rings with the horizon
topology S1  S2 to well describe Dirac particles tunnelling radiation
Black rings in ve dimensions have many unusual properties not shared by Myers-Perry
black holes with spherical topology for instance their event horizon topology is S1 S2 not
spherical for the neutral dipole and charged black rings Actually some topological black
holes also have nontrivial topology see for example 22 Therefore it is very interesting
to study Hawking radiation from these black ring solutions In Ref23 scalar particles via
tunnelling from black rings has already been discussed by using the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi
method And in 24 following recently hot discussion on anomalous derivation of Hawking
radiation the authors attempt to recover Hawking temperature of black rings via gauge
and gravitational anomalies at the horizon However when reducing the higher dimensional
theory to the eective two dimensional theory they also only consider scalar eld near the
horizon As far as I know till now there is no references to report Hawking radiation of
Dirac particles across black rings So it is interesting to see if fermions tunnelling method is
still applicable in such exotic spacetime and how to choose the matrices  for the covariant
Dirac equation of 5-dimensional black rings In this paper we shall concentrate ourselves on
Dirac particles tunnelling radiation from 5-dimensional black rings via fermions tunnelling
method We nally nd as in black hole cases fermions tunnelling result in correct Hawking
temperatures for the rotating neutral dipole and charged black rings
The remainders of this paper is organized as follows
In SecII Hawking radiation of
Dirac particles via tunnelling from the 5-dimensional rotating neutral black ring has been
studied by improving fermions tunnelling method Here to make a following analysis on the
rotating dipole and charged black rings in a more unied form in SecIII we deduce a general
5-dimensional metric from the rotating neutral black ring and discuss its Hawking radiation
of Dirac particles In fact the involved 5-dimensional metric is not arbitrarily taken and
after some substitutions has a unied form as the rotating neutral dipole and charged black
ringssee Ref23 SecIII is devoted to once again check the validity of fermions tunnelling
method for the rotating dipole and charged black rings SecIV contains some conclusions
and discussions
II DIRAC PARTICLES TUNNELLING FROM NEUTRAL BLACK RING
In this section we focus on studying Hawking radiation of Dirac particles via tunnelling
from 5-dimensional neutral black ring In this paper black rings involved are only special
solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity model EMD in 5-dimensions and the
corresponding action takes the forms as
16Z d5xgcid18R

eF 2cid19 
where F is a three-form eld strength and  is a dilaton Black ring solutions of the
action 1 have special characters 1 they all have horizon of topology S1  S2 2 there
exist three Killing coordinates to determine their local symmetries 3 there exists innitely
many dierent black rings solutions carrying the same mass angular momentum and electric
charge etc In this paper the rotating neutral dipole and charged black rings accompanied
by the action 1 are involved in our discussion First we consider the case of the 5-
dimensional neutral black ring The neutral black ring in 5-dimensional EMD theory has
been given by25

The parameters  and  are dimensionless and takes values in the range 0      1
and to avoid the conical singularity also at x  1  and  must be related to each other
via   21  2 The coordinate  and  are two cycles of the black ring and x and y
takes the range as 1  x  1 and   y  1 The constant R has the dimensional of
length and for thin large rings corresponds roughly to the radius of the ring circle26 The
horizon is located at y  yh  1 The mass of the black ring is M  3R241  
and its angular momentum takes J  R3p  1  21  2 In addition the
spacetime contains three Killing coordinates t  and  Next we shall study Dirac particles
tunnelling from the above neutral black ring For simplicity we take

Now the new form of neutral black ring 2 changes as

At the event horizon of the neutral black ring the coecients in Eq3 obviously obey
Mx yh  N x yh  0 N x yh  h
where y  yh is the event horizon of the neutral black ring and h is the angular velocity
of the black ring at the event horizon Throughout this paper the 5-dimensional spacetime
coordinates are always chosen as x  t y  x 
Now we focus on studying Dirac particles tunnelling from the rotating neutral black ring
In curved spacetime Dirac particles motion equation satises the following covariant Dirac
equation

As Dirac particles taking spin 12 when measuring spin along y direction there would
be two cases One is spin up case which shares the same direction as y and the otherspin
down case takes the opposite direction In the Pauli matrix 3 representation they can
explicitly expressed by the eigenvectors  and the corresponding eigenvalues are 1  1
In this paper we only refer to spin eld for the upper case  In fact after a completely
same step for spin down  case we can also get the same result We employ the following
ansatz for Dirac eld with spin up case as
t y  x

Substituting the above ansatz 10 for upper-spinning state into the covariant Dirac
equation 6 then applying WKB approximation and keeping the prominent terms we can
get the following equations

In fact the derivatives of A and B and the components 1
 ab are all of order O
and according to WKB approximation have already been neglected for the above equations
Considering the symmetries of the rotating neutral black ring we employ the following
I  Et  J   L  Wx y  K
where E J and L are all real constants which respectively represent the emitted particles
energy and angular momentum corresponding to the angles  and   and K is a complex
constantwhere we consider only the positive frequency contributions without loss of gen-
erality Inserting the ansatz 15 into Eqs11121314 and expanding the resulting
equations near the event horizon of the black ring we have

Here Myx yh  yMx yyyh and Nyx yh  yN x yyyh Now we carry on an
explicit analysis on the above equations From Eqs17 and 19 can we obtain
xWx y  is gxxx yh

And from Eqs16 and 18 one can easily see the two equations have a non-trivial solution
for A and B if and only if the determinant of the coecient matrix vanishes so we have
yWx y  rcid16E  hJcid172

 Myx yhy  yhcid16m2  L2
pMyx yhNyx yhy  yh
It should be noted that Eq20 implies near the horizon of the black ring xWx y has no
explicit y dependence On the other hand in Eq21 Myx yh and Nyx yh are both
related to the coordinate x but their product Myx yh  Nyx yh is independent of x
So near the horizon y  yh yWx y is independent of x Now the function Wx y can
be separated as Wx y  Wx  Wy which means near the horizon of the black ring
xWx y  xWx and yWx y  yWy
The WKB approximation tells us the tunnelling rate for the classically forbidden tra-
jectory from inside to outside the horizon is related to the imaginary part of the emitted
particles action across the event horizon Now our rst job is to nd the imaginary part of
the action From Eq15 we nd only Wx y and K yield contributions to the imaginary
part of the action As K is a complex constant all is focus on computing Wx and Wy
In fact after an integration on Eq20 Wx must be given by a complex constant so will
yield a contribution to the imaginary part of the action From Eq21 yields

where  sign corresponds to outgoingincoming solutions As we all know the tunnelling
probabilities is proportional to the imaginary part of the action So when particles tunnel
across the horizon each way the outgoing and ingoing rates are respectively given by

Noted that any particles classically enter the horizon with no barrier that means the tun-
nelling rate should be unity for incoming particles crossing the horizon In our case that
implies ImWy  ImWx  ImK Set  to unity and the tunnelling probability of
Dirac particles crossing from inside to outside horizon is naturally written as

which results in the expected temperature of the rotating neutral black ring
T  pMyx yhNyx yh
This result is exactly consistent with that in Refs23 24 25 where respectively present
the correct Hawking temperature of the rotating neutral black ring by using the so-called
Hamilton-Jacobi method anomalous cancellation method and the original denition of the
surface gravity Noted that the resulting temperature 25 is only for Dirac particles with
spin up For spin down case taking a manner fully analogous to the spin up case will result
the same result which means both spin up and spin down particles are emitted at the same
rate So such treatment does not loss the generality of fermions tunnelling method
addition the tunnelling rate 24 is derived by neglecting the higher terms about E and J 
and the resulting spectrum is purely thermal If we consider energy and angular momentum
conservation when particles tunnelling out from the horizon the higher terms will be present
in the tunnelling rate and the radiation spectrum is not thermal and related to the change
of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy which discussed a lot in Refs10 11 12 23 In the next
section to further verify the validity of application of fermions tunnelling method to black
rings we additionally take dipole and charged black ring as an example to discuss their
Hawking radiation of Dirac particles
III DIRAC PARTICLES TUNNELLING FROM DIPOLE AND CHARGED
BLACK RINGS
In the section we will discuss Hawking radiation of Dirac particles via tunnelling from
dipole and charged black rings and expect to result in correct Hawking temperatures
A Dipole black ring
Dipole black ring shares the same action 1 as neutral black ring so they physically take
many similar characters The ve dimensional dipole black rings was rst constructed in
25 its metric takes the form as

where F  G and C  are of the same form as neutral black ring and H  1

of   0 in Eq26 this solution degenerates into neutral black ring25 In suitable limits

dipole black ring also contains Myers-Perry black hole27 This metric 26 takes the same
form as 2 so we can apply the same procedure in SecII to correctly recover Hawking
temperature of dipole black ring Before that we take

which results in the metric 26 taking the same form as 4 At the horizon the functions

and the tetrad e
a 9 into the covariant Dirac equation 6 and then adopting the same
procedure present in SecII one can reads out Hawking temperature of Dirac particles via
tunnelling from dipole black ring

This result has been identically derived by using Hamilton-Jacobi method 23 and anoma-
lous cancellation method 24 where particles across the horizon are only for scalar cases
Note that dipole black ring actually contains a gauge eld Here we do not consider its eect
because it is magnetic and its electric dual are two-form elds that do not couple to point
particlessee Chen and Hes paper in 24 In the next subsection we will further study
Hawking radiation of a rotating black ring with a single electric charge by using fermions
tunnelling method
B Charged black ring
In this subsection we consider Hawking radiation from black ring with only one single
electric charge 28 For black rings with two or three charges 29 we can take the similar
procedure to get the correct results The metric of black ring with a single electric charge
can be written in the form consistent with neutral and dipole cases as

where some tricks are needed to reduce the original metric of black ring with a single electric
charge to the form as 29 refer to Chen and Hes paper in 24 Here F  and G are
dened as before and Kx y  1  x  y sinh2 F x where  is the parameter

the metric 29 has the same form as 4 In the spacetime gauge elds 30 couple to Dirac

This result is exactly consistent with Hawking temperature derived by cancelling gauge and
gravitational anomalies at the horizon of the charged black ring Chen and Hes paper in
24 Here to reduce the higher dimensional theory to the eective two dimensional theory
a dimensional reduction technique is carried out by using scalar eld near the horizon of the
charged black ring So the resulting Hawking temperature is only for scalar particles across
the horizon Now we can also conclude that scalar and Dirac particles can tunnel across the
horizon of black rings at the same Hawking temperature
IV CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
Hawking radiation of scalar particles across black holes or black rings have been dis-
cussed a lot via dierent methods such as recently hot discussing tunnelling method and
anomalous cancellation method etc And Hawking radiation of Dirac particles across 3- or
4-dimensional black holes have also been presented in recent papers via fermions tunnelling
method In this paper choosing a set of appropriate matrices  for the the 5-dimensional
neutral diploe and charged black rings we successfully recover Hawking temperatures of
these black rings via fermions tunnelling method
Fermions tunnelling method has already been successfully applied to derive Hawking ra-
diation of Dirac particles across stationary back holes16 17 19 20 21 and black rings
appeared in this paper For a non-stationary black hole although 18 has discussed
fermions tunnelling from Barddeen-Vaidya and cosmological black holes there is no cou-
pling eect between the spin of Dirac particles and the angular momentum of the black hole
in the tunnelling rate That is because the involved non-stationary black holes in 18 is of
spherical symmetry and have no angular momentum for themselves So we expect when
Dirac particles tunnelling from non-stationary black holes with one or more angular momen-
tum the spin coupling eect will be present This is our next job In addition noted that
choosing a set of appropriate matrices  is a important technique for fermions tunnelling
method or we can not correctly recover Hawking temperature we expected Finally it is
need to say that in SecII and III we only consider the case of Dirac particles with spin
up In fact adopting a similar procedure we will nd the same result for Dirac particles
with spin down That meas both spin up and spin down Dirac particles tunnel across the
horizon at the same Hawking temperature20 and such handling does not loss its generality
