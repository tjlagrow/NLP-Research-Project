Abstract Cells often have tens of thousands of receptors even though only a few
activated receptors can trigger full cellular responses Reasons for the overabundance
of receptors remain unclear We suggest that in certain conditions the large number
of receptors results in a competition among receptors to be the rst to activate the cell
The competition decreases the variability of the time to cellular activation and hence
results in a more synchronous activation of cells We argue that in simple models
this variability reduction does not necessarily interfere with the receptor specicity to
ligands achieved by the kinetic proofreading mechanism Thus cells can be activated
accurately in time and specically to certain signals We predict the minimum number
of receptors needed to reduce the coecient of variation for the time to activation
following binding of a specic ligand Further we predict the maximum number of
receptors so that the kinetic proofreading mechanism still can improve the specicity
of the activation These predictions fall in line with experimentally reported receptor
numbers for multiple systems

1 Introduction
Cellular responses to changes in the surrounding world are mediated by protein signaling
pathways These pathways are typically activated by modication of cell surface
receptors For example receptors on the surface of immune cells are a key component
in detecting pathogens and activating cellular proliferation degranulation and other
immune responses The number of such receptors on the cell surface typically is
104    106 1 2 3 Surprisingly sometimes as few as a hundred or even fewer bound
 These and subsequent numbers have to be taken with a grain of salt since rst of all they represent
a compilation of dierent systems in dierent organisms and cell lines Secondly a variety of processes
Large number of receptors may reduce cellular response time variation
receptors are needed to fully activate a cell For example T-cells can be activated by
1   10 receptors at the T-cellB-cell synapse 10 11 Rat basophilic leukemia cells
require fewer than 5 active Fc-RI receptors to degranulate 12 This is not unique
to immune receptors For example cellular response can be triggered by only a few
active estrogen receptors 13 This phenomenon of cells having an excessive number of
receptors compared to what is needed for activation has been known for a while as a
problem of spare receptors 14 15
Functional importance of this overabundance of receptors is not understood and
several explanations can be considered One possibility is that the chemical information
may not be distributed uniformly in space requiring receptors at multiple locations on
the cell surface An example is the T-cell which is commonly activated by antigen-
presenting cells through a localized synapse 16 Alternatively the number of ligands
may be very low and then the probability of receptor-ligand binding is increased by
having many receptors even in the well-mixed chemical kinetics limit 10 Finally large
number of receptors facilitates clustering promoting collective response which may lead
to signal amplication 17 18
Here we suggest that in an alternative regime of a high ligand concentration the
large number of receptors may play an additional role For example for biological
processes such as the immune response synchronous and short cellular activation
times would allow a concerted defense against an infection and may be functionally
advantageous Similarly concerted response is important in growth receptor signaling
We suggest that such improvement in the accuracy of the activation time may be
achieved through a competition among many receptors
We envision a receptor that when activated produces an active messenger
molecule A few and maybe just one of such molecules are sucient to start
transcription or otherwise activate the whole cell Each receptor takes an extended
and variable amount of time to activate Then the rst few receptors out of many that
have achieved full activation will activate the cell The variability of the activation time
of these fastest receptors can be smaller than that of a typical receptor To build an
intuition think about the distribution of nish times for runners in a marathon
this analogy each cell is a marathon with many receptors representing runners They
all start at about the same time launched into the activation race by an abundant
ligand and activated receptors are represented by runners who have nished the race
In large marathons with thousands of participants the time it takes to reach the nish
line for the rst few runners is much smaller than the mean of the nishing times More
importantly for an individual marathon the variability in nish times among all the
complicate the picture For example prior ligand exposure history may inuence the number of
receptors and of associated kinases hence controlling the systems gain 4 5 Further receptors
may form aggregates that activate collectively so that the ability of a receptor to activate a cell is a
function of its physical context 6 7 8 Finally serial engagement allows multiple receptor and cell
activations by the same ligand molecule 9 Nonetheless we believe these numbers to be correct within
an order of magnitude and hence illustrative
Large number of receptors may reduce cellular response time variation
runners can be fairly large of order of several hours And yet the distribution of times of
the winners of many marathons has the variability of the order of minutes In a similar
manner the receptors that are activated rst in dierent cells might have activation
times with small variance leading to a more synchronous response
In this work we approach the problem in the context of simplied receptor models
The receptor activation is rst modeled as a linear chain of L states such as ligand
binding conformational changes dimerization etc Ligand presentation starts the
progression along the chain and the nal state represents receptor activation With
this model the probability distribution of time to activation of the rst receptor out
of N receptors with N cid29 1 is given by a Weibull distribution which has a small
coecient of variation When m 1 cid28 m cid28 N  receptors are needed to activate the
cell the coecient of variation decreases even further This racing to activation
results in a short and less variable time to activation
Finally we point out that to activate specically to a certain ligand cells often
use kinetic proofreading 19 20 21 We show that a large number of receptors
does not necessarily interfere with the ability to proofread
It enables cells to be
activated temporally precisely but also specically to certain ligands Using biologically
reasonable parameter values we predict the number of receptors that allows for both of
these properties

are needed to activate a receptor b Kinetic proofreading denoted by the backwards
transitions with the rate  allows the receptor preferentially by a correct ligand
2 Multistep Activation
A simplied model of receptor activation consists of a linear chain of L irreversible
events where the receptor undergoes biochemical transformations that ultimately lead
to activation see Fig 1a In this gure the multistep activation process begins at the
diamond site i  0 and at each site the system can transit one step towards activation
with a forward rate k Reaching the right-most site i  L will lead to the receptor
activation irreversible on the time scales considered In order to simplify the algebraic

expressions we assume an equal forward rate for all sites This simplication may
reduce the generality of our results somewhat but it does not change their dependence
on L provided none of the rates k are small enough to form a bottleneck
The probability distribution of the time to complete each single step in the process
of the multistep activation is an exponential distribution with rate k

notably in the context of vertebrate vision 22

One can envision a situation where a cooperative action of a few receptors or
more precisely of their activated messages is needed to activate the whole cell We

where the last approximation comes from the rst few terms in the asymptotic expansion
of 1m  1m  12m2  124m3 assuming m cid29 1 Thus the coecient of variation
for cooperative activation is further reduced compared to the activation by the rst
receptor
The results of the three discussed cases single receptor the rst out of many
receptors and the rst m out of many receptors needed for activation are summarized
in Table 1 The racing to activation mechanism with a large number of participating
receptors can reduce the coecient of variation of the activation time to below 5 for
reasonable parameters This could mean a more synchronous activation of cells
3 Multistep activation with kinetic proofreading
Receptors can bind many non-specic ligands and they employ kinetic proofreading
to increase specicity and activate predominantly following binding of a specic ligand
21 23 Our model of kinetic proofreading follows Ref 24 and is shown in Fig 1b We
assume that there are two branches of sequential events in the receptor state diagram
a correct branch and a wrong one The two branches represent activation sequences
following binding of a specicnonspecic ligand molecules with rates k1 and k2 for
the correctwrong branches respectively For both branches kinetic proofreading is
represented by possible jumps back to the initial state with rates 1 and 2 respectively
These jumps can correspond to ligand unbinding from the receptor followed by return of
the receptor into the initial fully inactive state If 2 cid29 1 that is a nonspecic ligand
unbinds faster than the specic one then the receptor has a much lower probability
to reach the nal absorbing state along the wrong branch than along the correct one
Large number of receptors may reduce cellular response time variation
hence increasing the specicity While this model is crude it nonetheless captures the
basic physical properties of the kinetic proofreading process
Kinetic proofreading typically leads to a near-exponential distribution of completion
times 24 25 which has cv  1 The distribution is dierent from the exponential
only over a very short initial time period since it is dicult to traverse the sequence of L
steps to activation quickly see Fig 3 This has a potential of interfering with the racing
to activation mechanism for improving temporal precision Indeed a receptor with an
exponentially distributed activation time is equivalent to a single-step receptor L  1
In this case the corresponding  and the Weibull distributions are exponential as well
providing no reduction in the coecient of variation
However if the number of receptors is suciently large then the rst few receptors
will have a substantial chance to activate during the initial nonexponential phase of the
completion time distribution That is they will activate quickly in a linear sequence
of events as in the previous Section having no time to revert back to the initial state
through the proofreading mechanism Thus if the number of receptors is sucient
to complete so quickly along the correct branch the temporal precision will increase
through the racing to activation mechanism On the other hand since 2 is larger
the receptor trying to activate over the same time along the wrong branch may have
sucient time to revert to the initial state repeatedly falling into the exponential part
of the completion time distribution This suggests that the number of receptors on
the cell surface should also be limited from above so that wrong activation has a low
probability of happening in the pre-exponential part of the activation distribution
Mathematically we can summarize these arguments as follows Following Ref 25
we approximate the probability distribution of completing along a single branch of the
state space as
tL1 exp    k t 
P t  kL
L  1
P t  1

Here the short-time limit starts as the -distribution and there is an additional decrease
in probability of completing at time t by expt because of kinetic proofreading This
approximation is valid to the left of its maximum
Further  is the mean activation time calculated in Ref 25 to be
L  1

The approximation is illustrated in Fig 3
The variance reduction along the correct branch requires that the rst receptors
Large number of receptors may reduce cellular response time variation

maximum probability On left side of this line the curves are in log-log scale while the
curves on the right are in log-linear scale Solid line comes from a numerical solution
of the master equation describing the receptor We see the power law distribution
when t is small and the exponential distribution when t is large These are illustrated
with the right tail exponential asymptotic Eq 17 dash-dotted line the left tail

where as before the subscript 1 stands for the correct branch Using the standard
expressions for the incomplete -function we thus derive the minimum number Nmin of

This sets the lower bound on the number of receptors on the cell surface However
if the number of receptors was too high some of the ones bound by incorrect ligands
would activate in the left tail of the distribution before the kinetic proofreading has
a chance to kick in The requirement that the probability of early activation over the
wrong branch among all receptors is negligible sets the upper limit on the receptor

While we do not expect that the bounds derived from our manifestly oversimplied
model predict the real number of receptors on the cell surface it is still worthwhile
to verify if the obtained bounds are meaningful so that kinetic proofreading over a
wrong branch can be consistent with narrow activation time over the correct one As
in Ref 25 we choose L  16 and k1  k2  1 the same for both the correct and
the incorrect branches To choose the kinetic proofreading rates 12 we note that they
correspond for example to unbinding of a ligand from the receptor complex so that
the log-ratio of the rates are related to the dierence of the binding free energies G12
of the correct and the incorrect ligands
G1  G2  kBT ln
Assuming the dierence in the binding free energies of a few thermal energies we get
 2    10
Now choosing 1  07 we get the minimum number of receptors Nmin  104 and
the maximum number Nmax  107 or more The window between Nmin and Nmax
is suciently large to allow the choice of receptor number that satises both the
proofreading and the narrow activation time Further these numbers are realistic in
the context of biological receptor numbers which range between 104 and 106
4 Conclusion
Biological systems must operate under constraints posed by the physical world One of
such constraints is robustness to intrinsic noise that comes about from the small number
of stochastically activated molecular components in cellular networks Performing
averages of dierent kinds over time space or dierent molecular species is essentially
the only way of ensuring such robustness In this context it has been understood for
many years that sequential activation of L molecular components averages the times of
the activation steps and reduces the coecient of variation of the time to activation
which scales then as  1
L 26 This has been observed experimentally in the context
of vertebrate phototransduction 22 Here we propose a mechanism that can further
reduce the variability to  1L and even  1L
m where m is the cooperativity of
the activation process which may be a substantial improvement for long activation
sequences and large cooperativities The reduction of variability is achieved by having
many equivalent multi-step entities competing to be the rst one to activate the whole
system We believe that this mechanism which we call racing to activation has not
been reported previously in the literature
Large number of receptors may reduce cellular response time variation
Our focus here is on the general noise suppression mechanism and not on any
specic biological system Nonetheless
it is clear that various receptor-mediated
signaling systems are likely to be examples of where this mechanism will be applicable
The fact that receptors exist on cell surfaces in very large numbers far in excess of what
is needed to fully activate a cell is encouraging However the large number of receptors
needed for reduction of the temporal noise in the racing to activation mechanism can
come in conict with the specicity of signaling It is therefore reassuring that within
our model there is a range of receptor numbers that allows cells to maintain specicity
to certain ligands and yet be activated precisely in time
Another possible application of our model is in development There a crucial
question is the precision of position determination aorded by morphogen gradients
27 28 29 While most analyses are done for steady state gradients cells may need
to make developmental commitments based on pre-steady state transients 30 Adding
reverse reactions to Fig 1a with rates kreverse  k our model can be interpreted as
a biased nonequilibrium random walk of a morphogen particle in the physical space
where the rst m of such particles that reach a morphogen detector at L activate it
Our arguments suggest that such temporal rst-passage triggering of developmental
commitments can be made very precise
While too coarse for specic details our results can be used to make general
veriable predictions about relations between the number of receptors the similarity of
specic and non-specic ligands the cooperativity of receptor action on the one hand
and the variability of the activation time on the other Such data when available will
shed light on whether the proposed mechanism is used in cellular processes and to
which extent
