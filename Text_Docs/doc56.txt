Biological cells sense external chemical stimuli in their environment using cell-surface receptors
To increase the sensitivity of sensing receptors often cluster This process occurs most noticeably in
bacterial chemotaxis a paradigm for sensing and signaling in general While amplication of weak
stimuli is useful in the absence of noise its usefulness is less clear in the presence of extrinsic input
noise and intrinsic signaling noise Here exemplied in a bacterial chemotaxis system we combine
the allosteric Monod-Wyman-Changeux model for signal amplication by receptor complexes with
calculations of noise to study their interconnectedness
Importantly we calculate the signal-to-
noise ratio describing the balance of benecial and detrimental eects of clustering for the cell
Interestingly we nd that there is no advantage for the cell to build receptor complexes for noisy
input stimuli in the absence of intrinsic signaling noise However with intrinsic noise an optimal
complex size arises in line with estimates of the size of chemoreceptor complexes in bacteria and
protein aggregates in lipid rafts of eukaryotic cells
INTRODUCTION
Biological cells can sense and respond to various chem-
icals in their environment However the precision with
which a cell can measure and internally evaluate the con-
centration of a specic ligand molecule is negatively af-
fected by many sources of noise 1 2 There is external
input noise extrinsic noise from the random arrival of
ligand molecules at the cell-surface receptors by diusion
35 as well as various sources of intracellular signal-
ing noise intrinsic noise due eg to receptor dynam-
ics adaptation and signal transduction 6 all relying
on random chemical events Nonetheless several biologi-
cal examples exist in which measurements are performed
with surprisingly high sensitivity
In bacterial chemo-
taxis for instance the bacterium Escherichia coli can
respond to changes in concentration as low as 32 nM
7 corresponding to only three molecules in the cell vol-
ume High sensitivity is observed also in spatial sensing
by single cell eukaryotic organisms such as during aggre-
gation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum 8
and during mating of Saccharomyces cerevisiae budding
yeast 9 Furthermore axon growth cones of neurons re-
spond to an estimated change in concentration of about
one molecule in the volume of the growth cone 10 and T
cells of our immune system respond to a single peptide-
major histocompatibility complex on a target cell 11
How can this sensitivity be understood despite the vari-
ous sources of noise
The best characterized signal-transduction pathway is
the bacterial chemotaxis pathway allowing cells to swim
to sources of nutrients such as sugars and amino acids
and away from toxins 12 Cells are equipped with dif-
ferent receptor types with Tar among the most abun-
dant receptors hundreds to thousands of copies per cell
Tar specically binds aspartate or its non-metabolizable
analogue MeAsp An increase in ligand concentration
as occurring eg when the cell swims towards the source
of an attractant inhibits receptor signaling activity and
keeps the cell on course In contrast a decrease in at-
tractant concentration as occurring eg when the cell
swims in the wrong direction increases receptor signal-
ing activity This enhances the probability for the cell
to randomly nd a new and hopefully better direction of
swimming Cells are further equipped with an adaptation
mechanism which allows them to sense changes in ligand
concentration over a wide range of background concen-
tration Specically cells adapt their signaling activity
by receptor methylation and demethylation Methylation
by enzyme CheR increases the receptor signaling activity
while demethylation by enzyme CheB decreases receptor
activity
Receptor clustering is well documented in bacterial
chemotaxis 13 and is known to amplify tiny changes
in ligand concentration similar to an antenna Exper-
imental evidence for clustering is based on structural
approaches 14
imaging by uorescence microscopy
including photo-activated localization microscopy
PALM 16 as well as cryo-electron microscopy 17 18
Receptor clusters form predominantly at the cell poles
as illustrated in Fig 1 possibly due to the increased
membrane curvature 19 At a smaller scale receptor
clusters are composed of smaller signaling complexes
The notion of receptor complexes is supported by high-
resolution imaging with PALM 16 as well as by the ex-
tracted sensitivity and cooperativity from dose-response
curves activity changes in response to ligand stimuli

fer FRET As an example Fig 2a shows previously
published dose-response curves of the receptor activity

to only express the Tar receptor Dierent curves corre-
spond to dierent modication adaptation states of the

regulates the agellated rotary motors for cell motility
Wyman-Changeux MWC model 21 was used to suc-
cessfully describe signaling by two-state receptor com-
plexes Fig 1a 20 2224 The complex size ie the
number of strongly coupled receptors in a complex was
estimated to be about 10-20 receptors Alternative recep-
tor models later found to be inconsistent with the FRET
data 25 are based on the Ising lattice where moder-
ate receptor-receptor coupling provides a mechanism for
signal amplication and integration 26 27 Fits of the
MWC model to the data are shown in Fig 2a which indi-
cates an increase in complex size with receptor methyla-
tion level and hence ligand concentration Fig 2b This
result is consistent with the observed destabilization of
polar receptor clusters by receptor demethylation or ad-
dition of attractant 19 However it is unknown what
determines complex size
Complex size could be limited by an imperfect physical
clustering mechanism as proteins and lipids are soft ma-
terials undergoing substantial thermal motion Further-
more larger complexes may not form due to the presence
of other proteins in the membrane which may constitute
impurities in the receptor cluster The dynamic aspect
of receptors is supported by experiments using uores-
cence recovery after photobleaching FRAP This indi-
cates that receptor-cluster associated proteins as well as
components of the motors are relatively dynamic 28 29
Alternatively complex size might be determined by en-
gineering principles functionality and hence be opti-
mal for sensing This work supports the latter view
Fig 3 illustrates some of the advantages and disad-
vantages of receptor clustering On the one hand more
receptor cooperativity ie larger complexes amplify sig-
nals better in the absence of input noise top panels On
the other hand random uctuations in ligand concen-
tration also become amplied by the complex bottom
panels Furthermore the closer the proximity between
receptors in a cluster the larger the uctuations in ligand
concentration for the cell because nearby receptor com-
plexes measure previously bound ligand molecules due
to rebinding Hence clustering may render complexes
highly prone to noise and reduce the cells signal process-
ing capabilities Indeed sources of noise are ubiquitous
in biological sensing
Extrinsic input noise arises from the random arrival
of ligand molecules at the cell-surface receptors consti-
tuting the fundamental physical limit on concentration
sensing derived by Berg  Purcell in 1977 3 and sub-
sequently by others 5 3033 Specically Bialek  Se-
tayeshgar applied the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem
FDT 34 to derive the uncertainty in ligand sensing by
receptors from the uctuations in receptor occupancy
Furthermore if previously bound ligand molecules are
removed the uncertainty is signicantly decreased 5
Such removal prevents ligand molecules from rebinding
the receptors and hence overcounting of the same ligand
molecules by the cell A potential mechanism for ligand
removal is receptor internalization eg by endocytosis
of ligand-bound receptors in eukaryotic cells 35
In addition to extrinsic noise there is intrinsic noise
in the signaling pathway including the random receptor-
complex switching between the on active and o in-
active states similar to ickering of ion channels as
well as random receptor methylation and demethylation
events 36 Since the concentrations of methylation en-
zyme CheR and demethylation enzyme CheB are low
ie about a hundred copies per cell 37 the uctuations
aggregates in eukaryotic cells
The paper is organized as follows In Section II we
describe amplication of stimuli and extrinsic noise by
receptor complexes In section III we derive the uncer-
tainty in ligand concentration sensing by multiple recep-
tor complexes in the cell In section IV we combine the
information provided in sections II and III to derive an
optimal complex size determined by the balance between
signal and noise amplication by the receptor complexes
We conclude with nal comments and discussion in sec-
tion V Furthermore appendix A provides details on our
model and starting from the Master equation derives
the noise terms using the van Kampen expansion Ap-
pendix B is devoted to summarizing the parameter values
used In appendix C we examine the eect of receptor
distribution on the uncertainty of sensing
STIMULUS AND NOISE AMPLIFICATION
Signaling in bacterial chemotaxis is quantitatively in-
terpreted within the MWC model
In this model re-
ceptors form signaling complexes believed to consist of
about 10-20 receptors Due to strong receptor-receptor
coupling within a complex a complex is an eective two-
state system with all receptors either on or o together
Specically we consider MeAsp-binding to complexes of
the Tar receptor in line with recent experiments 20
Since MeAsp binds more favorably to the receptor o
than to the receptor on state ligand generally tends to
turn the receptor activity o whereas receptor methy-
lation favors the on state and so compensates for ligand
binding during adaptation
In the MWC model the probability that a receptor
complex is active ie the receptor activity A depends
only on the free-energy dierence F free energy from
now on between its on and o states 20 24
with energies in units of thermal energy kBT 
In this
model for a complex size of N receptors the complex
free energy is simply N times the free energy of a single
receptor

icant 38 To compensate for their small numbers en-
zymes were found to transiently tether to the receptors
This allows them to act on groups of 6-8 receptors 39
reducing the noise in receptor methylation level due to
the larger number of available modication sites 40 In
addition to these random biochemical events there are
further downstream signaling events ultimately the ran-
dom switching of the motors between its two rotational
states
How is signaling by receptor complexes aected by ex-
trinsic and intrinsic noise In this work we use the well-
characterized example of bacterial chemotaxis to com-
bine the allosteric MWC model for signaling by receptor
complexes 20 24 with calculations of noise to study
their interconnectedness Using the FDT 30 34 we
calculate the uncertainty in ligand concentration sensing
by the cell Specically we consider the eects of the
random arrival of ligand molecules at the receptors by
diusion and rebinding switching of the receptor com-
plexes and receptor methylationdemethylation While
these eects have been described individually before we
combine these to address signaling by multiple receptor
complexes in a cell Based on a simplied model we
then calculate the signal-to-noise ratio SNR summa-
rizing the balance of benecial and detrimental eects of
clustering for the cell Interestingly we nd that there is
no advantage for the cell to assemble receptor complexes
for noisy input stimuli in the absence of intrinsic signal-
ing noise However with such intrinsic noise included an
optimal complex size arises in line with estimates of the
sizes of chemoreceptor complexes in bacteria and protein

The mechanism for the cell to achieve precise adaptation
was originally proposed by Barkai  Leibler 42 and was
later identied as integral feedback control 43 Briey if
the dynamics of the methylation level are independent of
the available modication sites and external ligand con-
centration then the adapted steady-state activity only
depends on cell-specic parameters Specically the dy-
namics of adaptation were recently determined 44

where kR kB is the rate constant of methylation
demethylation by enzymes CheR CheB Eq 5 as-
sumes that CheR only methylates active receptors and
CheB only demethylates inactive receptors in line with
experimental observation Furthermore for demethyla-
tion CheB needs to be activated by phosphorylation and
may act cooperatively with other CheB enzymes ex-
plaining the A3 dependence in Eq 5 44
For initially adapted cells signal amplication is ob-
tained by expanding the activity in terms of a small stim-

tainty in ligand concentration using a single MWC com-
plex as a biological measurement device 45
In their
model the slow compared to ligand binding and unbind-
ing random switching between the on and o states of
the complex leads to a release or uptake of several N n
ligand molecules since both states are characterized by
dierent ligand dissociation constants Here we rst ex-
tend the model by Bialek  Setayeshgar 45 to multiple
MWC complexes of Tar receptors Subsequently we ap-
ply the method to intrinsic methylation noise and also
discuss the other noise contributions to the uncertainty

III UNCERTAINTY OF SENSING
uncertainty has the form cid104c2cid105  cid80
The uncertainty in sensing ligand concentration stems
from extrinsic noise random arrival of ligand molecules
at receptors by diusion and their rebinding as well as
intrinsic signaling noise receptor complex switching and
methylationdemethylation projected outside the cell
in form of extrinsic noise in disguise If we neglect cross
correlations in this section for illustrative purposes the

contributions k and  an averaging time of the noise due
to slower downstream signaling The aim of this section
is to demonstrate how the dierent contributions are af-
fected by receptor complex size Specically we show
which contributions are amplied and which ones are not
This will help classifying noise sources more eectively
and guide the investigation of the optimal complex size

The rst term on the right-hand side represents the
uncertainty in ligand concentration due to the release
and uptake of N n ligand molecules induced by the
randomly switching receptor complexes S The second
term is due to diusion and represents the additional
uncertainly from rebinding of previously bound ligand
molecules R Due to this term the uncertainty depends
on the spatial distribution of the receptor complexes on
the cell surface Specically the term proportional to
1a describes the rebinding of ligand molecules to the
same receptor complex while the term proportional to 
describes the rebinding to the other receptor complexes
This latter contribution becomes the larger the smaller
the proximity of the receptor complexes eg in the polar
receptor cluster appendix C Fast ligand diusion or
removal of bound ligand molecules by an ecient cellular
uptake mechanism reduces this term 35 Furthermore
in Eq 20 the number of receptor complexes NC in the
denominators reduces the uncertainty by spatial averag-
The FDT method can also be used to calculate the
uncertainty in ligand concentration from random recep-
tor methylation and demethylation events The rate of
change of a small deviation of the receptor-complex ac-
tivity A due to a change in total receptor methylation

where the rst term on the right hand side describes
the contribution from random receptor methylation and
demethylation events M respectively leading to a re-
lease and take-up of ligand molecules This term is in-
versely proportial to N 2 and hence is not amplied by
receptor cooperativity cf Eq
6 in analogy to the
intrinsic ligand noise arising from random switching of
the receptor complex in Eq 20 The second term in
Eq 23 is idential to Eq 20 and describes the con-
tribution from diusion R as released and taken up
ligand molecules lead to additional uncertainty in ligand
concentration
So far the contribution to the uncertainty from ran-
dom binding and unbinding of ligand molecules L to
the receptor complex is still missing To avoid the com-
plexity of dierent rates for the on and o states we
assume diusion-limited binding to the receptor cluster
and write for the additional uncertainty 31 35

calculated from Poisson statistics and the diusive ux
to an absorbing sphere of radius Rs which represents the
dimension of the receptor cluster Eq 24 is considered
the fundamental physical limit of sensing as it cannot be
reduced by any intracellular sensing mechanism This
extrinsic noise is amplied due to the absence of a N 2
factor in the denominator
In summary
uncertainty of sensing dierently
intrinsic and extrinsic noise aect the
only extrinsic
noise is amplied
In the next section we consider an
integrative model of extrinsic ligand noise and intrinsic
noise from receptor methylationdemethylation noise
The receptor-complex switching noise is much smaller
due to the large switching rates and hence is assumed
to be averaged out By using the receptor activity
of the whole cell as a read-out of signaling we are
able to compare the properties of stimulus and noise
transmission

rst consider the linear regime of the activity as this can
be solved analytically In this case Eqs 28 and 29

using Eq 6 As a result the SNR scales as N1 and
hence decreases for increasing complex size This indi-
cates that a single receptor is better than a complex of
multiple receptors for signaling due to the more rapid
increase of the Noise with complex size than the Signal
Note also that the SNR is proportional to the total num-
ber of receptors NT in a cell
In order to consider the full non-linear activity of the
receptors we numerically integrate Eqs 28 and 29
with m set to m and P c instead of P c m Fig 5

a function of complex size and ligand concentration In

with   Fm The rst term on the right-hand
side of Eq 34 represents the intrinsic methylation noise
which is independent of complex size consistent with the
amplied version of Eq 23 The reason for this N -
independence is that a large complex has more enzymes
bound to the receptors and hence suers from larger noise
than a small complex However a large complex also has
an increased relaxation rate kR  3kB A2 restoring the
average methylation level more quickly The second term

We next consider how the cells Signal and the Noise
scale with complex size First
in the linear activity
regime the Signal is again given by Eq 32 Analoguous
to the case with ligand noise only the receptor complex
is able to fully amplify the stimulus The only dierence
is that the Signal is saturated by the stimulus or noise at
smaller complex sizes due to the noise contribution from
methylationdemethylation In contrast the Noise has
a new regime in the presence of additional noise from
methylationdemethylation

For small complex sizes the ligand-induced N -dependent

on the right-hand side of Eq 34 is the ligand-induced
methylation noise with its characteristic N 2-dependence

Furthermore the covariance between the ligand con-

Together with the variances this equation allows the cal-
culation of the previously mentioned correlation coe-
cient  Its value is zero if uctuations in methylation
level are independent of uctuations in ligand concentra-
tion and one if there are no ligand-independent uctu-
ations in the methylation level In our model the cor-
relation coecient turns out to be rather small ie no
larger than 00001 for the parameter values used
To check the validity of the small-noise approxima-
tion we compare the intrinsic methylation noise from
the analytical calculation rst term on the right-hand
side of Eq 34 with simulations of the Master equa-
tion using the exact Gillespie algorithm 46
the methylation noise is signicantly larger than the
ligand noise and hence is used for this test Speci-
cally the algorithm requires two random numbers The
rst determines whether to methylate the complex with
rate kR1  AM  or whether to demethylate with rate
kBAM 3 where M  a3m is the current methylation
level the dependence on the constant external ligand
Similar to the previous two cases the Signal behaves
as Eq 32 ie scales as N 2 due to stimulus amplica-
tion in the linear activity regime However since the
methylationdemethylation noise is independent of com-
plex size only the stimulus and not the noise can satu-
rate the Signal for large complex sizes The Noise scales
as N from the prefactor in Eq 29 since the methyla-
tiondemethylation noise is independent of complex size
As a result the SNR is proportional to the complex size
Hence large complexes are always better for signaling
than small complexes provided the amplied stimulus is
not saturating the Signal This analysis is conrmed by
numerical integration in Figs 10 and 11
In summary
intrinsic and extrinsic noise have pro-
foundly dierent eects on sensing Only in the presence
of both does an optimal complex size emerge This re-
sult is intuitively clear Amplication of extrinsic noise is
worse than amplication of the stimulus as receptor com-
plexes behave incoherently for noise amplication and be-
come fewer in number for increasing complex size How-
ever amplication of extrinsic noise is acceptable as long
as it stays below the intrinsic noise and does not satu-
rate receptor activity Only when the amplied extrinsic
noise becomes larger than the intrinsic noise does its ef-
fect become detrimental
V DISCUSSION
Here we investigated the conditions under which an op-
timal receptor complex size emerges in order to provide
a potential explanation for the observed receptor coop-
erativity Fig 2 and complexes sizes as imaged by high-
resolution microscopy 16 Specically we considered
the signal-to-noise ratio SNR ie
the ratio between
the Signal in response to a small stimulus in ligand con-
centration and the Noise from random uctuations of the
activity based on all the receptor complexes in a cell Us-
ing the MWC model for signaling by receptor complexes
we include amplication of both stimulus and extrinsic
ligand noise as well as the eects of intrinsic noise from
random receptor methylationdemethylation Also in-
cluded are correlations between the ligand and methy-
lationdemethylation noise since uctuations in ligand
concentration can induce an adaptational response and
hence uctuations in methylation level Note however
that very slow uctuations in ligand concentration are
fully removed by perfect adaptation
By setting up the Master equation and applying the
small-noise approximation we found that only including
extrinsic ligand noise leads to a decrease in SNR with
complex size as the Noise inceases more rapidly with
complex size than the Signal When instead only con-
sidering intrinsic noise there is no penalty for the cell
to make larger and larger complexes and the SNR in-
creases with increasing complex size However including
both noise sources introduces a complex size-independent
noise oor from the intrinsic noise Hence an increase in

tiondemethylation introduces a noise oor below which
it is advantageous for the cell to increase the complex
size However once amplied ligand noise becomes com-
parable to the noise oor for large complexes the Noise
increases more rapidly than the Signal with further in-
creasing complex size
To address the behavior for the non-linear activity
Figs 8 and 9 show the results from the numerical eval-
uation of the double integrals in Eqs
28 and 29
conrming our analysis of the scaling For large com-
plex sizes deviations from the linear regime can be ob-
served The shape of the optimal complex-size curve as
a function of ligand concentration is ultimately deter-
mined by the functional dependence of n on c Eq 7
which describes the sensitivity of the receptor occupancy
to changes in ligand concentration
C Methylation noise

fectively reduces to the Normal distribution P m

complex size is benecial until the amplied and hence
size-dependent extrinsic noise increases beyond the noise
oor An optimal complex size for complexes with more
than one receptor is the consequence Figs 8 and 9
Extrinsic ligand noise results from the random bind-
ing as well as rebinding of previously measured ligand
molecules Importantly the latter contribution depends
on the distribution of the receptors
In particular the
smaller the complex-complex proximity in clusters the
larger the increase in uncertainty in sensing ligand con-
centration For ligand diusion in aqueous solution the
eect of rebinding is generally negligible appendix C A
ligand molecule just released from a receptor is quickly
removed by diusion hence preventing it from rebinding
However diusion can be much slower in biologically rel-
evant circumstances For instance in E coil chemorecep-
tors are localized in the inner membrane which is sur-
rounded by the dense viscous periplasm separating the
inner and outer cell membranes Here the ligand diu-
sion constant can be a thousand times smaller 47 and
rebinding of previously bound ligand molecules could be
signicant
As demonstrated recently the detrimental eect of lig-
and rebinding can be reduced by internalization of ligand-
bound receptors such as frequently occurs in eukaryotic
cells 35 Receptor internalization eectively turns the
cell into an absorber of ligand molecules which increases
the accuracy of sensing 5 35 While chemoreceptors in
bacteria are not internalized transporters for uptake of
sugars and amino acids could colocalize with the recep-
tors to simulate the eect of internalization Specically
the uptake of sugars and amino acids is mainly conducted
by periplasmic permeases which are ABC-like trans-
porters 48 The best studied permease is the maltose
system in E coli Maltose enters the outer membrane
through the LamB pores Subsequently it is sensed by ei-
ther directly binding the Tar receptor or maltose-binding
protein MalE which is then either bound by the Tar re-
ceptor for sensing or by the permease for transport of
maltose into the cell Additional work will be required
to better understand the role of the periplasm in the ac-
curacy of sensing
While our model is able to explain the observed com-
plex sizes from FRET data there are a number of simpli-
fying model assumptions First we calculated the Signal
and Noise at the receptor level neglecting downstream
signaling events such as phosphorylation and dephospho-
rylation reactions However such reactions are known to
be very fast 50  1000 s1 44 and hence their noise
is quickly averaged out by the motor Second for our
calculation of the noise to be computationally feasible
we assume diusion-limited binding to avoid diculties
with the two dierent receptor complex states Third
fast intrinsic noise from random receptor switching be-
tween its two activity states is assumed to be averaged
out and hence is also neglected
A remaining question is if optimization principles hold
for cellular subsystems here receptor sensing There
might be tradeos potentially leading to suboptimal so-
lutions for parts of the cell Furthermore receptor sens-
ing is not the nal cells output here swimming on
which natural selection may operate However as recep-

tors enable cells to gather information about their en-
vironment and information can only be lost not gained
during signal transduction it appears to be a reason-
able assumption to conserve this information as much as
possible if energy and resources are not limiting To
instead optimize chemotaxis signaling at the level of cell
swimming not only swimming up typical gradients but
also staying on top of gradients at the maximum con-
centration 49 and the dynamics of gradients 50 would
need to be considered
Our model can readily be extended from Tar-only re-
ceptor complexes to mixed complexes of multiple recep-
tor types 24 If ligand binds specically to one recep-
tor type only the receptor fraction of each type in a
mixed complex should be optimal in size with specics
depending on the ligand dissociation constants only Fur-
thermore our work may be applicable to other recep-
tors as well While receptor clustering may be re-
stricted to receptors with high sensing accuracy most
well-characterized sensory receptors are believed to clus-
ter or to oligomerize These include the eukaryotic B-
cell T-cell Fc synaptic as well as G-protein-coupled
and ryanodine receptors 51 Specically T-cell recep-
tors form micro-clusters of 7-30 receptors 52 Such re-
ceptor aggregates are often associated with lipid rafts
islands of specic lipids with particular anity for cer-
tain membrane proteins
Interestingly lipid rafts were
found to be small containing mostly about 6-12 proteins
53 and were recently even observed in bacteria 54 Our
work may indicate that this number represents an opti-
mal size for signal amplication where size is restricted
by extrinsic and intrinsic noise

expansion
In this appendix we set up the Master equation of
the simplied problem of a receptor complex whose ac-
tivity is determined by the external ligand concentration
and receptor methylation level The dynamics of the lat-
ter are determined by adaptation To solve for the rst
and second moments of the joint probability distribu-
tion from the Master equation we apply van Kampens
 expansion where  is the reaction volume allowing
one to introduce a large expansion parameter 55 We
neglect fast processes such as receptor-complex switch-
ing between dierent activity states and ligand-receptor

processes

To estimate the magnitude of the structure factor  in
Eqs 20 and 23 and hence the importance of ligand
rebinding to the uncertainty of sensing ligand concen-
tration we apply the following algorithm for uniformely
distributing NC points complexes on a sphere The al-
gorithm divides the sphere in NC parallels and places a
point on each parallel at positions given by the following
equations in spherical coordinates 58

The number 36 in the algorithm can in principle be ad-
justed appropriately for the application at hand but de-
rives essentially from best packing algorithms The sim-
ple algorithm adopted here distributes the points spirally
around the sphere and gives a good results in accordance
with more sophisticated algorithms based on energy min-
imization between point charges on the sphere or best
packing criteria as long as NC  100 and NC  12000
To represent the polar receptor cluster we choose a
small sphere of radius RS  75nm 18 As a result
the structure factor for the small sphere is given by
S  477  109m1
In contrast to represent recep-
tor complexes evenly distributed over the cell surface we
use a large sphere of radius RL  12 m which leads to
a smaller structure factor given by L  573  108m1
Compared to rebinding to the same receptor which is
proportional to 1a  107m1 in Eq 20 the polar re-
ceptor cluster can signicantly worsen the uncertainty of
sensing However for fast ligand diusion in aqueous
solution the rebinding terms are negligible compared to
the other contributions to the uncertainty
