Abstract
We investigated the evolution of clusters of galaxies using self-consistent N -body simulations We varied
the initial model of galaxies and clusters and studied the dependence of evolution on initial conditions
We found that the growth rate of the common halo depends only weakly on galaxy models On the other
hand the growth rate depends strongly on cluster models Initially the growth rate is higher for cluster
models with higher central density However this high growth rate drops in a few crossing times of the
cluster and after several crossing times roughly half of the total mass is in the common halo in all models
we considered In the central region of clusters density cusps with the prole   r12 develops regardless
of the models of clusters and galaxies We also found that the galaxies evolved so as to satisfy the relation
between the masses of galaxies mgx and their velocity dispersion gx expressed as mgx  34
for all galaxy
models as a consequence of their dynamical evolution through galaxygalaxy interactions We discuss the
relation between our result and the observed FaberJackson relation

Introduction
alized
In recent years observations of structures of galaxies
in clusters at high-z z  1 have become possible due
to the advances in telescopes related instruments and
methods of analysis Such observations of high-z clusters
allow us to study the evolution of clusters and galaxies in
clusters by comparing high- and low-z clusters Using an
I-band magnitude-selected sample of 81 conrmed clus-
ter members covered by HST WFPC2 van Dokkum et
al 1999 reported that the fraction of mergers in clusters
is high in high-z region and the fraction drops quickly in
low-z clusters In the eld merger fraction seems to drop
more slowly than that in clusters Their result suggests
that mergings of galaxies take place mainly in the forma-
tion epoch of a cluster After the cluster virialized or in
the region where the galaxies have virialized mergings of
galaxies become rare
However merging is not the only way for galaxies in
clusters to evolve Ellipticals and S0 galaxies are much
more abundant in clusters than those in the eld They
are more abundant in clusters in low-z than in high-z
eg Couch et al 1998 and especially in central high
density regions in such clusters density-morphology re-
lation Dressler 1980 These observations suggest that
galaxies dynamically evolve after their parent cluster viri-
In this paper we investigate how clusters of galaxies
and their member galaxies evolve after the formation of
clusters themselves
N -body simulation is a powerful tool to study the for-
mation and evolution of clusters of galaxies Two types
of N -body simulations of clusters of galaxies have been
One is cosmological N -body simulations in which the
formation process of galaxies and clusters is simulated
in the general framework of CDM cosmologies Many
cosmological simulations have been carried out to study
how clusters of galaxies were formed from initial density
uctuations Bertschinger 1998 for a review and to de-
termine the best t values of cosmological parameters
such as  H0  and so on
Due to the advances in computer technologies and al-
gorithms the number of particles in simulations have sig-
nicantly increased from  103 in the late 1970s Miyoshi
and Kihara 1975 Fall 1978 Aarseth and Fall 1980 to
 106 Moore et al 1998 Ghigna et al 1998 Okamoto
and Habe 1999 at present In 1980s galaxies are treated
as point particles in cosmological simulations of clusters
However recently there are some studies in which both
the formation of a cluster and that of galaxies in it are
followed self-consistently in a single large simulation In

these simulations it is expected that a cluster has a hi-
erarchical structure and small clumps of particles can be
regarded as galactic halos formed in the clusters They
tried to compare properties of galactic halos such as
density proles or velocity dispersions with those of ob-
served cluster galaxies
However the cosmological simulation is not a univer-
sal tool which allows us to study all aspects of evolution
of clusters In cosmological N -body simulations dynam-
ical processes with dierent spatial and time scales take
place simultaneously For example galaxies in the cen-
tral virialized region of a cluster collide with each other in
high speed As a result they decrease their masses due
to stripping At the same time newly formed galaxies
fall into the cluster and some of infalling galaxies might
merge with each other because of low relative velocity It
is therefore dicult to understand the essential phys-
ical mechanisms of the formation and evolution of the
structure of clusters in these simulations Even if these
simulations reproduce the present-day structure it is not
clear how the present-day structure is formed Without
the understanding of essential physical mechanisms it is
dicult to understand what are the common properties
of clusters and galaxies and why they are
The reliability of simulations is also a problem Even
if the number of particles is large enough to express the
overall structure of a typical galactic halo on average it
is still far from sucient to resolve dwarfs galaxies in
central regions of clusters or central regions of typical
galaxies
In order to understand how galaxies evolve after viri-
alization of the parent cluster it is helpful to perform
the other type of simulations in which we simulate the
evolution of model clusters of galaxies eg Funato et al
1993 Bode et al 1994 Garijo et al 1997 Sensui et al
1999 paper I
By constructing the model clusters and model galaxies
appropriately as initial conditions we can quantitatively
and separately study the eect of each dynamical process
such as mass stripping merging dynamical friction tidal
disruption due to the mean eld of the parent clusters and
so on Using understanding of these individual dynamical
processes obtained from model cluster simulations we
can improve interpretation of the result of cosmological
simulations Understanding these individual dynamical
processes obtained from model cluster simulations and
results of cosmological simulations complementarily help
us to understand evolution of galaxies and clusters
This paper is the second of the series of papers in which
we study the evolution of model clusters In our study
paper I and present paper we set the initial condition
of cluster models so that the eect of galaxygalaxy in-
teraction is clearly visible since interactions seem to be
the dominant mechanism for the dynamical evolution of
clusters of galaxies We obtained quantitative results on
how the mass of galaxies and the structure of individual
galaxies and that of a cluster evolve
In paper I we used a Plummer model for both a galaxy
model and a cluster model We found that more than
half of the total mass escaped from individual galaxies
and that a common halo was formed The growth rate
of the common halo depended on the size of the cluster
only weakly We also found that the density prole of the
cluster is expressed as   r12 in the central region
We however cannot draw a general conclusion from
simulations with the Plummer model only Since fre-
quency of the galaxygalaxy interaction is aected by
distribution of galaxies within a cluster the global struc-
ture of the cluster such as a core radius or a density
prole may aect the results Furthermore the Plum-
mer model is not appropriate as a model of a real galaxy
or a real cluster as this model has a core much larger
than those of observed galaxies or clusters Therefore
studies with other models for galaxies and clusters are
necessary to understand the evolution of real clusters
In this study we adopted a Plummer model King
models and a Hernquist model Hernquist 1990 as mod-
els of galaxies and clusters to study how the initial proles
of the cluster and galaxies aect the result By perform-
ing the simulations for dierent model galaxies and clus-
ters with dierent density structures we can study the ef-
fect of the initial model on the result systematically We
investigated the growth timescale of the common halo
the density prole of clusters and the evolution of the
mass and structure of galaxies
In section 2 we describe initial conditions which we
used in our simulations Time integration method and
galaxy identication method are described in section 3
In section 4 we present the results A summary and dis-
cussions are given in section 5
Initial Conditions
21 Units
We used a system of units in which m  G  1 and
e  14 where G is the gravitational constant and m
and e are the mass and the energy of one initial galaxy
Heggie and Mathieu 1986 Assuming that the mass
unit corresponds to 1012M and the length unit to 30
kpc we nd that the time unit corresponds to 110 Myr
Initial Models of Galaxies and Clusters
For models of galaxies we adopted a Plummer model
King models whose non-dimensional potential depth are
3 7 and 9 and a Hernquist model For all galaxy mod-
els the mass m and the virial radius r0 are 1 and the
velocity dispersion gx is 12 All galaxy models com-
prise 2048 particles so the mass of a particle is 12048
As we showed in paper I this number of particles per

one galaxy is suciently large to suppress the two-body
relaxation as far as the evolution of the masses of the in-
dividual galaxies and the structure of the common halo
are concerned
We adopted a Plummer model King models whose
non-dimensional potential depth are 3 5 and 7 and a
Hernquist model as cluster models A King model with
a deeper central potential and a high central concen-
tration gives a better tting for a real cluster than a
Plummer model
For all cluster models the number of galaxies is 128
and all of the mass was initially attached to galaxies The
total mass M of a cluster is therefore 128 in all runs

dispersion cl the total energy E and the crossing time

Under the same conversion factors as used for galax-
ies the total mass of the cluster corresponds to 128 
1014M The velocity dispersion of galaxies in the clus-
ter is 480 kmsec the virial radius of the cluster is 06
Mpc and the crossing time is 25 Gyr
In table 1 we summarize the initial models which
we used The suxes of King models denote the non-
dimensional potential depth of King models 02

is the mean one-dimensional velocity dispersion of the

3 Numerical Methods
31 Time Integration
The total number of particles N is 262144 In order
to carry out calculations with this large number of par-
ticles fast we used GRAPE-4 Makino et al 1997 and
GRAPE-5 Kawai et al 2000 with the BarnesHut tree
algorithm Barnes and Hut 1986 Makino 1991 Athanas-
soula et al 1998 The softening parameter  was 0025
the opening angle  was 075 and the time step t
was 164 One time step took about 14 seconds with
GRAPE-4 and 5 seconds with GRAPE-5
In all runs the time integration was carried out using
the leap-frog method The errors in the total energy
EE0 were of the order of 103 in all runs
32 Galaxy Recognition
The method of recognition of individual galaxies is the
same as that used in paper I except for the treatment
of mergers We added an automatic procedure to au-
tomatically recognize mergers which we will explain in
section 33
To study how galaxies evolve in a cluster we need to
determine which particles have escaped from them We
dene a galaxy as a self-gravitating bound object
practice we calculated the number of escapers by the
following procedure
Initially each particle belongs to one unique galaxy
We call this galaxy as a parent galaxy At each time
step we calculated the binding energy of each particle
in its parent galaxy
If the binding energy was posi-
tive we regarded that particle as having escaped from its
parent galaxy The binding energy was calculated using
those particles that were still bound to the parent galaxy
Thus we needed to iterate this calculation several times
to stabilize the membership Using this algorithm we
could trace the identity of a galaxy even after 90 of the
mass had escaped The limitation of the present method
is that we cannot deal with the exchange of particles be-
tween galaxies Since the fraction of mass exchanged is
expected to be negligible neglecting the exchange would
not aect our result
Note that this procedure is applied to each galaxy af-
ter possible mergers are identied Otherwise a galaxy
which merged with others might be regarded as com-
pletely disrupted
33 Merger Identication
To nd merger candidates we used the method similar
to that used by Athanassoula et al 1997 We dened
the center of a galaxy as
iri n
where n is the number of particles in the galaxy i is
the local density of particle i calculated using the sixth
nearest neighbor in the galaxy Casertano and Hut 1985
and ri is the position of particle i We calculated the

rgx vuut
iri  rc2 n
We also calculated the central velocity dispersion of a
galaxy gx by taking the root-mean-squared velocity of
particles within 2 rgx in the galaxy
Using these two characteristic values rgx and gx we
regard two galaxies as merged if the following criteria
Rij  05 minrgxi  rgxj
Vij  05 mingxi  gxj
rgxi  rgxj  rcrit
are satised Here Rij is the relative distance of two
galaxies Vij is the relative velocity of them and rcrit is a
criterion radius The rst two criteria examine whether
two galaxies are close enough to merge
The last criterion examines whether they can be still
recognized as galaxies or they have been already dis-
rupted Athanassoula et al 1997 did not use this last
criterion because they were interested in the evolution of
small groups of galaxies and used only ve galaxies for
all runs On the other hand we used 128 galaxies for
all runs and some galaxies were disrupted through their
evolutions The particles which originally belonged to
these disrupted galaxies are distributed throughout the
whole cluster as part of the common halo Thus if we do
not use the last criterion these disrupted galaxies with
large radius are identied as merged In other words the
common halo itself is recognized as a huge merger
Physically speaking when more than 50 of the to-
tal mass goes to the common halo it becomes a self-
gravitational system in its own right and it is correct
that the common halo is recognized as a merger How-
ever here we regard mergers in a more conventional sense
that the remnant of the merging events of several galax-
ies and analyze the common halo as a distinct object so
we introduced the last criterion to exclude the common
halo We set rcrit to 3 for runs K9P PK7 and PH and 5
for the others
We carried out this check for all galaxy pairs and if
more than two galaxies merged to one galaxy we re-
garded them as a multiple merger

the panels in the right-hand side show particles escaped
from galaxies to the intracluster space We can see from

is small the growth rate of the common halo is slightly
larger for runs with galaxy models with high central den-
sities eg K9P than that for runs with galaxy models

more extended envelope than a galaxy with a low cen-
tral density The mass in the outer part of a galaxy can
escape easily from individual galaxies to the intracluster
space through galaxygalaxy interactions A galaxy with
a more extended halo loses its mass more easily than that
with a less extended halo
After t  3 Tcr the growth rate of a common halo
becomes almost the same for all runs except for the run
K3P but the dierence is small In other words after a
large fraction of the mass in the outer part of a galaxy is
lost the growth rate of a common halo becomes almost
independent of the internal structure of the initial galaxy
Figure 3 shows the evolution of the common halo for
runs with dierent cluster models We can see two impor-
tant results in gure 3 The rst one is that the growth
rate of runs PK7 and PH are much faster than the oth-
ers in early phase t  1 Tcr and the second one is that
MhaloMcluster  05 in all runs at t  4 Tcr We will
return to these issues in section 51
For the run PK7 the fractional mass of the common
halo decreases occasionally This is caused by our crite-
rion to recognize merging events We sometimes found a
massive virialized system which is actually the central re-
gion of the common halo in particular for the runs with
centrally concentrated cluster models As we described in
section 33 this is physically correct since we are really
looking at a compact self-gravitating object However
this does cause some large uctuation on the mass of the
common halo as we can see in gure 3

sity increases to realize   r12 cusps while the prole

our results with other proles proposed for clusters and

time we measured the ratio between the mass in galaxies
and the total mass within given radii
In gure 8 we
show the result for three epochs for the run PP The
relative mass in galaxies at the central region increases
even though the total mass in galaxies decreases This
result implies that galaxies sink towards the center of the
cluster due to the dynamical friction
In other words
gure 8 suggests that the formation of the shallow cusps
is caused by thermal relaxation of the cluster
We can get some insights on how the central cusp
forms from the studies of the evolution of star clusters
When the mass of the stars are all equal the central
density of a star cluster increases through the thermal
evolution of the cluster and the central cusp would de-
velop through the gravothermal catastrophe Antonov
1962 Lynden-Bell and Wood 1968
In this case the
slope is around 22 deeper than the isothermal This
is because the velocity dispersion goes up in the central
region as the result of the gravothermal catastrophe
When the mass of stars are dierent the dynamical
friction causes heavy stars to sink toward the center and
accelerates the collapse In these unequal-mass star clus-
ters a cusp with a slope shallower than that of the
singular isothermal distribution is formed Inagaki and
Wiyanto 1984 Here the shallow cusp implies that the
velocity dispersion goes down toward the center How-

panel we used the same b and rb for all proles Fitting
parameters are shown in table 2 The parameter set for
the run PP is an example of typical proles and that for
the run PK7 is an exceptional one for the initial cluster
model with very high central density Here even though
there is the central cusp region the best-t result says
  0 simply because the cusp region is too narrow
Figure 7 shows the density proles at the core region
of the total cluster galaxies and the halo for the run PP
at t  89 Tcr We can see that the galaxy component is
dominant for the density prole at the core region of the
cluster This tendency is observed in all models including

ever the temperature still goes up towards the center
since the average mass goes up towards the center as the
result of the mass segregation caused by the dynamical
friction Apparently our clusters of galaxies evolve in
the same way as the star clusters with stars with dier-
ent masses
Takahashi et al 2000 followed the evolution of clus-
ters by solving FokkerPlanck hereafter FP equations
numerically They found the same slope as what we ob-
tained by N -body simulation is realized in their FP sim-
ulation Their result clearly demonstrates that the cusp
is formed through the thermal evolution since only the
thermal evolution can occur in FP calculations
43 Evolution of Galaxies
In gure 9 the velocity dispersions of galaxies are plot-
ted against their masses for runs PP PK7 and PH at
t  45 Tcr The velocity dispersions for galaxies are
shifted downwards by a factor of two for the run PK7
and by a factor of four for the run PH to make it easy
to distinguish them from those of the run PP Figure 9
shows that the m relation does not depend on the ini-
tial cluster model and that the galaxies in a cluster evolve
along a line   m1314
Figure 10 is the same as gure 9 but for runs PP
K9P and HP It is remarkable that for runs K9P and
HP the velocity dispersions were almost constant for the
galaxies with m  04 K9P or m  05 HP and for
those smaller than those conditions they are distributed
along the lines   m1314
This sharp contrast between centrally concentrated
models and less concentrated models are understood as
follows How the mass and the velocity dispersion of a
galaxy change through encounters with another galaxy
Fig 10 Same as gure 9 but for runs PP squares K9P circles
and HPtriangles Velocity dispersions are shifted by a factor
of two for the run K9P and by a factor of four for the run HP
For runs K9P and HP only the galaxies with m  04 K9P
or m  05 HP are used to t
depends on the structure of the galaxy The dierence in
evolution of the massvelocity dispersion relation of three
galaxy models in gure 10 therefore should be the result
of the dierence in initial structures of galaxy models
Figure 11 shows examples of density proles of a galaxy
for runs PP and K9P We chose a galaxy with mgx  05
as a sample galaxy for each run at t  45 Tcr From
gure 11a we can see that for the case of the Plum-
mer model the central density decreases as the mass de-
creases On the other hand for the case of the King 9
model gure 11b the decrease of density is limited to
the outer region It means that for a King model galaxy
the kinetic structure in its inner region is self-gravitating
itself so as to change slowly in response to encounters

On the other hand to remove stars from the Plummer
model we need to supply much larger energy input even
in the outer region Since a signicant fraction of this
energy is spent to heat up the stars which will remain
bound Funato and Makino 1999 the galaxy as a whole
expands in the case of the Plummer model resulting in
the decrease in both the velocity dispersion and the cen-
tral density
In fact for a Plummer model galaxy gure 11a also
shows that the steep cut-o of density prole in outer
region disappeared and a moderately extended halo de-
velops so as to be expressed as   r4 It means that
when the galaxy model was heated up some particles es-
cape to the intracluster space while many other heated
particles still remain in the galaxy Therefore its specic
kinetic energy becomes small and its velocity dispersion
decreased
After around 50 of its mass is removed even a King 9
model galaxy no longer has an extended halo Thus fur-
ther removal of its mass is associated with the net heat-
ing resulting in the decrease in the velocity dispersion
According to the above argument the Hernquist model
should behave similarly to the King 9 model since it
also has an extended halo In fact as we can see from
gure 10 their evolution tracks are very similar
To summarize no matter what is the initial prole
of the galaxies their dynamical evolution driven by the
encounters with other galaxies follows the direction  
m1314 at least after a signicant fraction of the initial
mass has been removed from them
Note that this evolutionary track is consistent with
the observed FaberJackson relation Faber and Jackson
1976 hereafter FJ relation between the luminosity L
and velocity dispersion  of cluster ellipticals The FJ
relation is expressed as L  4 Of course we need to
assume that ML is constant to relate our numerical re-
sult on the relation between the mass and the velocity
dispersion and FJ relation between the luminosity and
the velocity dispersion This might sound unreasonable
since the outskirts of the galaxy must be dominated by
the dark matter However as we have seen in gure 10
while the mass in the outskirts is removed the veloc-
ity dispersion remain almost constant Therefore we
can conclude that the dynamical evolution of galaxies
through encounters is consistent with the observed FJ
relation We will make more detailed assessment on this
subject in section 52
5 Summary and Discussion
We investigated the evolution of clusters of galaxies
using self-consistent N -body simulations We used dif-
ferent models for a galaxy and a cluster to see how the
results depend on the initial model
Fig 11 Density proles of a galaxy in a the run PP and b
the run K9P Solid curves are at t  0 and dashed curves are
at t  45 Tcr
In each panel the downward arrow indicates
initial half-mass radius of the galaxy while the upward arrow
indicates half-mass radius of the galaxy at t  45 Tcr
with other galaxies
Initially both Plummer and King 9 model galaxies have
the same virial radii However due to the dierence in
the central concentration between them the half-mass
radii are dierent The initial half-mass radius of the
Plummer model is 073 and that of the King 9 model is
about 1 shown by downward arrows in gure 11
From these dierences the specic binding energy of
a halo star is smaller for the King 9 model than for the
Plummer model if we compare them at the same mass
coordinate In other words we can remove large mass
from the King 9 model with very little energy input as
far as we are taking out the outer region say outside
the half-mass radius Even the particles only slightly
heated up are so easily escaped from the galaxy that
the remaining particles do not change their energy much
Thus the change in the velocity dispersion is initially

plotted against their masses at t  45 Tcr for the run K9P
In all runs with dierent galaxy models and dierent
cluster models we found that about half of the total mass
of a cluster escapes from individual galaxies to the intra-
cluster space by about 4 Tcr This escaped matter forms
a common halo However while the cluster is young
the growth rate of the common halo strongly depends on
the initial cluster model The dependence on the galaxy
model is somewhat weaker
The density prole of the evolved cluster has an ap-
proximately r12 cusp at the core region for a Plummer
model cluster The size of this cusp region is roughly the
same as the core radius of the initial cluster model
We also found that the evolution track of individual
galaxies in the massvelocity dispersion plane is consis-
tent with the FJ relation for all galaxy models after a
fair fraction of the total mass is removed For models
with extended halos such as the King 9 model and the
Hernquist model the velocity dispersion remains almost
constant until about half of the total mass escaped to the
cluster
In the following we rst discuss the relation between
the initial growth rate of common halos and initial den-
sity proles of cluster models Then we discuss the evolu-
tion of individual galaxies in connection with FJ relation
51 Growth Rate of Common Halos
As shown in section 42 the initial growth rate of
the common halo depends rather strongly on the ini-
tial density prole of the cluster Here we give semi-
quantitative analytic interpretation on this dierence
In paper I we showed that the mass-loss rate from
individual galaxy was expressed as
dt  m52nr12
h V 2
The growth rate of the common halo is given by inte-
grating the above formula over all galaxies Here let us
concentrate on the early phase of the evolution where we
can regard rh as constant
When we change the cluster model we can ignore the
dierence in Vc since all cluster models have the same ve-
locity dispersion Therefore the growth rate of the com-
mon halo dMdt is simply proportional to the number
density of galaxies ngx integrated over all galaxies
other words we have
dt Z d3x n2
This form is the same as the emission measure for the
total X-ray luminosity of the cluster if we replace ngx
by the electron number density ne
In both case we
essentially count the number of collisions per unit time
The initial value of Z d3x n2
gx is 044 for the cluster
of the Plummer model and 082 for the cluster of the
King 7 model which means that the initial growth rate
for a King 7 cluster is about twice as large as that for a
Plummer cluster Table 3 shows the mean growth rates of
common halos dMdt for runs PP and PK7 in t  1 Tcr
as well as the initial theoretical values We can see that
the agreement is excellent
In a few crossing times of the cluster many galaxies
have disrupted and many others lose large fraction of
their initial masses As a result the growth rate of the
common halo in the cluster drops This drop is faster
for cluster models with high central concentration be-
cause of the following two reasons First the galaxies
in the central high density region have lost most of the
mass Therefore there is not much mass left to escape
Second these cluster models also have extended halos
which means a fair fraction of galaxies are in very low
density region These galaxies cannot lose much mass
These combined eect explains why the growth rate of
the common halo in the late phase is slower for models
with high central density
52 m Relation of Individual Galaxies
As we have seen in section 43 the relation  
m1314 develops for a cluster with Plummer model
galaxies as galaxies evolve In the case of clusters with
King 9 or Hernquist model galaxies the same relation
No 
Evolution of Clusters of Galaxies II Dependence on Initial Cluster Model
also develops after galaxies lost about more than half of
their masses
In the following we discuss how the FJ relation is real-
ized in observed clusters of galaxies under the standard
CDM model and the hierarchical structure formation sce-
When galaxies are initially formed they should have
the dark matter more extended than the luminous mat-
ter since the dark matter is dissipationless while the
baryonic matter from which the stars will eventually be
formed is dissipational Recent high-resolution simula-
tions of formation of dark-matter halos Fukushige and
Makino 1997 Moore et al 1998 Fukushige and Makino
2000 suggest that the dark-matter halos have the cen-
tral cusp slightly shallower than isothermal   r15
which smoothly connect to the outer halo with   r3
In other words they have a rather extended nearly
isothermal region
In the cluster environment the outer halo is quickly
stripped through encounters with other galaxies to form
a steeper halo with   r4 as we have seen in the case
of the King 9 model During this period however the
luminosity and the velocity dispersion of the luminous
matter would suer very little change since the luminous
matter is more centrally concentrated
When the luminous matter starts to be stripped
through encounters the morphology of the galaxy it-
self starts to change since the stellar disk would be
heated up by encounters As a result they would become
ES0 galaxies from spirals Once the galaxy reached this
regime we can regard its ML to be roughly constant
since the luminous matter bears a large fraction of the
total mass anyway Therefore further stripping would
result in the relation   m14 which can be regarded
as the FJ relation
To see what we would see for the true L   relation
in gure 12 we plot the relation between the luminos-
ity and the velocity dispersion for the run PK9 Here
we simply assumed that particles which were within 25
mass radius at t  0 are all luminous matters and re-
maining 75 is dark We see that the slope is rather
steep when the mass luminosity is still large but
it becomes shallower to approach 14 as the mass be-
comes smaller Best t for the result shown in gure 12
lum  m043
lum  is signicantly steeper than the observed
FJ relation
Qualitatively this implies that our scenario described
above works ne By limiting the luminous matter to the
central region we eliminated the region in gure 11b
where the velocity dispersion is almost constant Unfor-
tunately our simple model is a bit too successful result-
ing in the relation too steep when the mass is still large
The reason why we obtained steeper relation in g-
ure 12 is probably that our model for the luminous mat-
ter has a cuto which is too sharp Since the cuto is
sharp the luminosity cannot change until the stripping
reacheppps to the very central region while the veloc-
ity dispersion starts to decrease when dark matters just
outside the luminous matter are removed We need to
employ more realistic model for the distribution of the
luminous matter However at least qualitatively we can
conclude that the mass loss through encounters is consis-
tent with the observed FJ relation
We are not arguing that the mass loss through encoun-
ters is the only mechanism to produce the FJ relation
The merging of two galaxies also drives the evolution of
galaxies along the line of m  4 on m plane Farouki
et al 1983 Hierarchical merging predicted in CDM sce-
nario therefore would also result in the m   relation
which is consistent with the FJ relation
The important point is that the dynamical evolution
and interaction between galaxies would not break the FJ
relation even if the dynamical environment is so violent
Our result shows that the FJ relation is very robust re-
lation against dynamical evolution of galaxies
