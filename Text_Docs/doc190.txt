ABSTRACT
We follow the evolution of the galaxy population in a CDM cosmology by means
of high-resolution N-body simulations in which the formation of galaxies and their
observable properties are calculated using a semi-analytic model We display images
of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the simulations that illustrate its evolution
and provide a qualitative understanding of the processes responsible for various biases
that develop We consider three specic statistical measures of clustering at z  1
and z  0 the correlation length in real- and redshift-space of galaxies of dierent
luminosity the morphology-density relation and the genus curve of the topology of
galaxy isodensity surfaces For galaxies with luminosity below L the z  0 corre-
lation length depends very little on the luminosity of the sample but for brighter
galaxies it increases very rapidly reaching values in excess of 10h1Mpc The accel-
erated dynamical evolution experienced by galaxies in rich clusters which is partly
responsible for this eect also results in a strong morphology-density relation Re-
markably this relation is already well-established at z  1 The genus curves of the
galaxies are signicantly dierent from the genus curves of the dark matter but this
is not due to genuine topological dierences but rather to the sparse sampling of the
density eld provided by galaxies The predictions of our model at z  0 will be tested
by forthcoming data from the 2dF and Sloan galaxy surveys and those at z  1 by
the DEEP and VIRMOS surveys
INTRODUCTION
Studies of the large-scale distribution of galaxies have tra-
ditionally focussed on problems such as testing hypotheses
for the identity of the dark matter the nature of the ini-
tial density perturbations and the mechanism of structure
growth Properties of the observed large-scale structure are
also often used to estimate the values of fundamental cos-
mological parameters Although none of these issues can be
regarded as settled there is now a growing consensus that
cold dark matter CDM is the most likely candidate for the
dark matter that cosmic structure grew by the gravitational
amplication of random-phase initial density uctuations of
inationary origin and that the fundamental cosmological
parameters have the following values density parameter
0  03 cosmological constant term 0  07 and Hubble
constant in units of 100 km s1 Mpc1 h  07
Cosmological constraints reect only one aspect of the
information encoded in the pattern of galaxy clustering An-
other equally interesting aspect concerns the processes re-
sponsible for the formation and evolution of galaxies To
extract this kind of information requires very extensive
ccid13 0000 RAS
datasets and these are only now becoming available in the
form of a new generation of galaxy surveys like 2dF Pea-
cock et al 2001 Sloan Blanton et al 2000 and 2MASS
Jarret et al
2000 The expectation is that these new
datasets will provide in addition to further cosmological
constraints some understanding of how the physics of galaxy
formation manifests itself in the clustering of galaxies as a
function of internal properties such as morphology luminos-
ity colour or star formation rate Not only is this important
for testing models of galaxy formation but it is also required
for extracting accurate cosmological information from the
new surveys Although it seems plausible that on very large
scales the galaxy distribution traces the underlying mass in
a simple way Coles 1993 Cole et al 1998 complex biases
are predicted to be present on small and intermediate scales
Kaumann et al 1999a Benson et al 2000a
To extract useful information from observational data
of the quality and size of the new surveys it is necessary
to have detailed theoretical predictions In this area too
there have been signicant advances in recent years largely
through the development of increasingly realistic ab initio
calculations of galaxy formation and evolution Two strate-
A J Benson C S Frenk C M Baugh S Cole  C G Lacey
1994 Frenk et al
gies have been developed for this purpose In the rst one
cosmological N-bodygasdynamics simulations are used to
follow the coupled evolution of dark matter and gas in par-
ticular the cooling of gas in galactic dark matter halos eg
Katz Hernquist  Weinberg 1992 Evrard Summers 
1996 Weinberg Hernquist 
Katz 1997 Blanton et al 1999 Pearce et al 1999 A phe-
nomenological model is employed to decide when and where
stars and galaxies form from this cooled gas and to include
the associated feedback eects In the second strategy only
the evolution of the dark matter component is simulated di-
rectly or the assembly history of halos is obtained with a
Monte-Carlo method and the behaviour of the gas is calcu-
lated by solving a simple analytical spherically symmetric
cooling-ow model As in the direct simulation approach
star formation and feedback are included in a phenomeno-
logical way
The two strategies oer dierent advantages Direct
simulations solve the evolution equations for gravitationally
coupled dark matter and dissipative gas without imposing
any restrictions on geometry However limited resolution re-
stricts the range of length and mass scales that can be stud-
ied and the expense of large simulations makes it imprac-
tical to carry out extensive parameter space explorations
Because of its simplied treatment of gas dynamics semi-
analytic modelling can follow an essentially unlimited range
of length and mass scales and is suciently exible that
the eects of varying assumptions and parameter values can
be readily explored Additional processes that cannot cur-
rently be easily investigated at the resolution available in
direct simulations such as those determining galaxy mor-
phology or the eects of dust obscuration can be readily
incorporated into the semi-analytic models by straightfor-
ward extensions to the phenomenological model of star for-
mation and feedback The numerical resolution and physical
content of a typical N-bodygasdynamic simulation can be
mimicked in a semi-analytic model and Benson et al 2001
have shown that at least in the case where only the simplest
gas physics are modelled the two techniques give reassur-
ingly similar statistical results
In this paper we combine large N-body simulations with
the semi-analytic model of Cole et al 2000 to investigate
certain properties of the galaxy distribution that are rele-
vant to the new generation of galaxy redshift surveys We
begin by displaying images that illustrate the evolution of
the galaxy population in a representative volume of a simu-
lated CDM universe These images furnish some qualitative
understanding of the mechanisms responsible for establish-
ing the spatial distribution of galaxies of dierent kinds We
then focus specically on the dependence of the two-point
correlation function on galaxy luminosity the morphology-
density relation and the topology of the galaxy distribution
as measured by the genus and on the evolution of these
properties with redshift The dependence of clustering on
luminosity and colour have previously been considered us-
ing similar techniques by Kaumann Nusser  Steinmetz
1997 Kaumann et al 1999a and Benson et al 2000c
The rst and last of these studies found a weak increase in
the correlation function with luminosity on large scales but
the second failed to detect any eect These papers used sim-
ulations of relatively small volumes and so were unable to
investigate the clustering of the brightest galaxies for which
luminosity-dependent eects are expected to be strongest
The new generation of redshift surveys will include large
samples of very bright galaxies and may well be able to mea-
sure this kind of eect In this paper we extend earlier work
and investigate clustering at the bright end of the galaxy
luminosity function Closely related to the dependence of
clustering strength on luminosity is the morphology-density
relation which we also quantify in our simulations both at
the present day and at z  1 Finally we provide the rst
determination of the genus curves predicted for galaxies in
a CDM model previous simulations had only been able to
address the genus curves of the dark matter distribution
Although our model predictions are directed at the new sur-
veys we carry out limited comparisons with available obser-
vational data
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows In
2 we describe our simulation and modelling techniques In
3 we present colour images of the evolution of a slice of our
simulated volume these images are publically available at
httpwwwastrocaltecheduabensonMocksmockshtml
In 4 we present quantitative estimates of clustering namely
the correlation length-luminosity and morphology-density
relations and the genus statistic and compare our results
to observations Finally we present our conclusions in 5
2 METHOD
The need for realistic modelling of galaxy formation as a
prerequisite for deriving reliable clustering predictions has
been emphasised by Benson et al 2000a who showed for
example that the form of the two-point correlation func-
tion on small scales is strongly inuenced by the physical
processes governing galaxy formation Such processes are
readily taken into account when the techniques of semi-
analytic modelling are grafted into N-body simulations of
the dark matter Kaumann Nusser  Steinmetz 1997
Kaumann et al 1999ab Diaferio et al 1999 Benson et
al 2000ac Somerville et al 2001 Monte-Carlo implemen-
tations of the semi-analytic model can also be used directly
for clustering studies without N-body simulations but they
only work well on scales larger than the Lagrangian radii of
the dark matter halos which host galaxies in practice on
scales in excess of a few Mpc although see Seljak 2000
for which the bias can be calculated using the analytic for-
mula of Mo  White 1996 see for example Baugh et al
1999 Modelling the visible properties of galaxies explicitly
allows simulated samples to be selected according to crite-
ria closely patterned on observational selection procedures
eg by magnitude colour morphology etc thus allowing
rigorous comparisons with observations to be made
In this paper we use the techniques introduced by
Kaumann Nusser  Steinmetz 1997 and extended by
Benson et al
2000a to graft our semi-analytic model
of galaxy formation onto N-body simulations Full details
of our semi-analytic model and the extensions required to
study galaxy clustering are given in Cole et al 2000 and
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Benson et al
2000ac respectively Briey dark matter
halos are identied in the simulation at the redshift of inter-
est using the friends-of-friends algorithm with the standard
linking length of 02 Davis et al 1985 After cleaning the
halo catalogue in the manner described below the mass of
each halo is input into the semi-analytic model By means of
simple physically-motivated prescriptions described in de-
tail in Cole et al 2000 the model calculates the amount
of gas that cools in a virialized halo of that mass to make a
galaxy as well as the star formation rate the reheating of
left-over gas by stellar winds and supernovae and the chem-
ical evolution of the gas and stars Galaxies are allowed to
merge within common dark matter halos producing ellipti-
cal galaxies and bulges from stellar disks The spectropho-
tometric evolution of the galaxies is calculated using a stan-
dard stellar population synthesis model Bruzual  Charlot
1993 Bruzual  Charlot 2001 Extinction by dust is in-
cluded using the models of Ferrara et al 1999 The most
massive galaxy in each halo is identied with the central
galaxy and placed at the centre of mass and given the pe-
culiar velocity of the centre of mass Other galaxies satel-
lites are assigned the position and peculiar velocity of a ran-
domly chosen dark matter particle within the halo In this
way satellite galaxies always trace the dark matter within
a given halo Modelling of this kind has been successfully
applied to study a large variety of properties of the galaxy
population eg Cole et al 1994 Kaumann Guiderdoni
 White 1994 Baugh Cole  Frenk 1996ab Kaumann
1996 Baugh et al 1998 Somerville  Primack 1999 Cole
et al 2000 Granato et al 2000
We consider only dark matter halos in the simulation
containing ten or more particles Since we are interested in
galaxies of all luminosities including the faint ones that oc-
cupy halos with masses close to the ten-particle limit it is
important to check that small halos are actually bound ob-
jects For this we calculate the total energy of each halo by
summing the kinetic energy measured relative to the centre
of mass of the halo and the gravitational energy due to the
interaction between all of the particles in the halo If a halo
is found to have positive energy and so to be unbound
we remove the least bound particle and recompute the to-
tal energy This process is repeated until either the energy
becomes negative in which case we now have a bound halo
with a lower mass than the original or there are fewer than
ten particles left in the halo in which case we discard it
In this way we construct a new halo catalogue containing
only bound objects
Typically approximately 10 of the halos from the orig-
inal catalogue fail the binding energy test and are excluded
A slightly smaller fraction have particles removed but re-
main in the catalogue Most of the excluded halos come
from the low mass end of the distribution with the excluded
fraction dropping rapidly as the halo mass increases We
nd many examples of halos contaminated by interlopers
for which removal of a small number of the least bound par-
ticles results in a bound object Note that since the binding
energy test only aects halos near the resolution limit of the
N-body simulation it does not alter any of the results of
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
The evolution of the galaxy distribution
Benson et al 2000a who considered only bright galaxies
that form in halos well above the resolution limit
We adopt similar values for the parameters of the semi-
analytic model as did Cole et al
2000 except that the
parameters describing the normalisation and shape of the
power spectrum 8 and  see below are set to the ac-
tual values used in the simulation The parameters of the
semi-analytic model are slightly dierent from those used in
Benson et al 2000a but the dierences in the predictions
are negligible Furthermore since the dark matter halo mass
function in the simulations diers somewhat from the Press-
Schechter form assumed by Cole et al 2000 we nd that
the model works better if the value of  the ratio of total to
visible stellar mass which depends on the fraction of brown
dwarfs is set equal to 1 rather than 14 as in Cole et al
2000 The recycled fraction in the calculation of the chem-
ical enrichment is modied accordingly Cole et al 2000
Benson et al 2000a showed that in a CDM cosmology
this model produces a real-space two-point galaxy correla-
tion function which is remarkably similar to that measured
in the APM survey by Baugh 1996 in contrast to the
 CDM cosmology which fails to match the observed two-
point correlation function on all scales Furthermore Ben-
son et al
2000a showed that clustering predictions are
robust to changes in the semi-analytic parameters provided
that the model matches the bright end of the local galaxy
luminosity function The evolution of the galaxy correlation
function with redshift is in good agreement with SPH sim-
ulations of galaxy formation Pearce et al 1999 Benson et
al 2001 In this paper we consider only the CDM model
We have checked that the parameters we have adopted do
produce a correlation function of L galaxies identical to
that of Benson et al 2000a
We use two dierent N-body simulations The rst one
is the GIF CDM simulation a full description of which
may be found in Jenkins et al 1998 and Kaumann et al
1999a This is a 17 million dark matter particle simulation
in a cubic volume of side 1413h1Mpc with cosmological
parameters 0  03 0  07 h  07   021 and
8  09 where  is the power spectrum shape parameter
and 8 is the linearly extrapolated rms mass uctuation in
a sphere of radius 8h1 Mpc The mass of the smallest re-
solved halo in this simulation is 14  1011h1M We also
analyse the 5123 simulation described by Jenkins et al
2001 and Benson et al 2000c which has identical cosmo-
logical parameters to the GIF simulation although a slightly
dierent transfer function for the input power spectrum
The particle mass in this simulation is larger by a factor
of roughly 5 than in the GIF simulation so that only dark
matter halos more massive than 71011h1M are resolved
but the volume is approximately 40 times larger than in the
GIF simulation The 5123 simulation is ideal for studying
the brightest galaxies which are only found in very massive
halos and have low abundance Benson et al 2000c noted
that the dark matter correlation function in the 5123 simula-
tion diered slightly from that in the GIF simulation due to
the large-scale power which is included in the larger volume
but is missing in the smaller one Throughout this paper
we apply a small correction to all the correlation functions

tity r  5123 r  GIFr where 5123 and GIF are
the correlation functions of the dark matter in real or red-
shift space as appropriate in the 5123 and GIF simulations
respectively The required correction is not necessarily the
same for galaxies and dark matter of course However the
correction is at most 20 in r over the range of scales
considered in this work and furthermore ignoring it does
not alter any of our conclusions
IMAGES OF THE GALAXY DISTRIBUTION
Fig 1 shows the distributions of dark matter and galaxies
in slices through the GIF N-body simulation volume at six
dierent redshifts Each slice has dimensions 1413 1413
8h3Mpc3 The dark matter is represented by the greyscale
obtained by adaptively smoothing the N-body mass distri-
bution The shade intensity is proportional to the logarithm
of the dark matter density in each pixel the darker the pixel
the greater the projected density of the slice Each galaxy
brighter than MB  5 log h  19 that formed in this re-
gion is depicted as a circle whose size is proportional to the
rest-frame B-band absolute magnitude and whose colour in-
dicates the rest-frame B-V colour as given by the scales at
the top of the gure Fig 2 displays zoomed images at three
redshifts of the areas delineated by the coloured boxes in
Fig 1 the region around a supercluster left and a more
typical region right
31 The biased galaxy distribution
The images in Fig 1 illustrate what a realistic distribution
of galaxies might look like At z  0 this patch of universe is
populated by galaxies with a wide range of colours The dark
matter has acquired the lamentary appearance characteris-
tic of gravitational growth from cold dark matter initial con-
ditions The galaxies light up the laments and superclus-
ters of the dark matter distribution but are conspicuously
absent from regions in which the density of dark matter is
low The emptiness of the voids is quite striking cf Peebles
2001 The voids would not be as empty of galaxies as they
are if instead of using the semi-analytic model galaxies
Figure 3 Top panel the real-space correlation functions of
galaxies brighter than rest-frame MB  5 log h  19 for dif-
ferent redshifts are shown by lines with redshifts as indicated in
the legend The separation r is in comoving coordinates Filled
squares give the value of the correlation function of dark matter

were simply identied with randomly selected dark matter
particles Such a Poisson process inevitably places a small
fraction of galaxies in voids but the physics of galaxy forma-
tion do not allow this at the magnitude limit appropriate
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
to Figs 1 and 2 voids are truly voids no galaxies form in
1999a and Benson et al
While to the eye the distribution of galaxies in the g-
ures may appear to follow the broad features of the dark
matter distribution it is impossible to judge in this way how
faithful this tracing really is That galaxies in CDM models
might not be perfect tracers of the mass has been suspected
for some time Davis et al 1985 Bardeen et al 1986
and was demonstrated explicitly for the GIF simulations
by Kaumann et al
2000a
These studies showed for example that on scales below a
few megaparsecs galaxies in the simulations are less strongly
clustered than the dark matter or anti-biased relative to
the mass The upper panel in Fig 3 shows the correlation
functions of the galaxies for the dierent redshifts shown in
Fig 1 and demonstrates one aspect of the bias The cor-
relation functions of these galaxies have remarkably similar
amplitudes in contrast to the correlation function of dark
matter whose value at r  5h1Mpc is shown as solid points
in Fig 3 the amplitude of which evolves rapidly with red-
shift In Fig 3 we also compare our determinations of the
correlation function to those derived from an analytical ap-
proach to the bias cf Baugh et al 1999 For this we
compute the eective bias of the galaxy population as
bMi z
where N is the number of galaxies in the simulation Mi is
the mass of the halo in which the ith galaxy is found and
bM z is the bias of dark matter halos of mass M and red-
shift z which we calculate using the tting formula of Jing
1998 which is based on the model of Mo  White 1996
An approximation to the galaxy correlation function is then
bz2DMr z where DM is the correlation function of dark
matter For the galaxy samples in our simulation we nd
bz  107 124 147 205 291 and 521 for z  00 05
10 20 30 and 50 respectively In the lower panel of Fig 3
we plot the ratio of the galaxy correlation functions in the
simulation to the analytical approximation On scales above
a few megaparsecs the analytical bias approach works well
it does slightly underestimate the correlation functions but
given the large biases present in our high-redshift samples
the approximation is actually rather good but as expected
it fails on smaller scales where our model predicts a scale de-
pendent bias
Certain kinds of bias are readily apparent to the eye
in Fig 1 For example the largest dark matter clumps at
z  0 are preferentially populated by red galaxies while
the eld contains a mixture of galaxy colours Similarly
the brightest galaxies in the region are also preferentially
found at the centres of rich clusters The rst of these bi-
ases the colour-density relation is intimately related to
a morphology-density relation and is a natural outcome
of hierarchical clustering as we will discuss in more detail
below It has been investigated before in these simulations
in a somewhat dierent form by Kaumann et al 1999a
and Benson et al
2000c who found that the two-point
correlation function of elliptical galaxies is higher than that
of spirals on small scales This kind of bias is of course
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
The evolution of the galaxy distribution
known to occur in the real universe eg Davis  Geller
1976 Loveday et al 1995
Biases in the distribution of galaxies are the inevitable
by-product of the complex physics of galaxy formation They
aect galaxies of dierent types in dierent ways and need to
be understood before attempting to interpret cosmological
observations
32 The evolution of the galaxy population
The evolution of galaxies is driven by a number of processes
The most obvious one is the aging of the stellar populations
Even if galaxies lived in isolation stellar evolution would
cause their luminosities and colours to evolve However no
galaxy is an island accretion mergers and interactions are
common Many galaxies are observed to be forming stars to-
day possibly by converting new gas supplied externally al-
though see Benson et al 2000b thus increasing their mass
and size Others are observed to be expelling gas through
galactic winds and tidal encounters Nucleosynthesis in stars
causes the metallicity of galactic gas and stars to evolve and
this in turn aects the integrated stellar spectra
The nett eects of the various processes driving galaxy
evolution are readily apparent in Fig 1 Since young stars
produce copious amounts of blue light galaxies with high
star formation rates relative to their total stellar mass ap-
pear bluer than galaxies with low relative star formation
rates At z  0 the majority of the galaxies in the simulation
are quite red because they have low relative star formation
rates and are made primarily of old stars As we look into
the past the appearance of the population rapidly changes
By z  1 galaxies are much bluer because the typical rel-
ative star formation rate is higher than at z  0 and the
average stellar age is younger Beyond z  1 the galaxies
remain blue reecting the youth of their stellar populations
The apparent star formation rate per unit volume declines
at high redshift because fewer galaxies are seen above our
magnitude selection even though those that are seen still
have high star formation rates The detailed star formation
history in our model is discussed in Cole et al
2000 It
is broadly in agreement with the star formation history of
the Universe as inferred from observations by amongst oth-
ers Lilly et al 1996 Madau et al 1996 and Steidel et
1999 Although many quantitative details of the ob-
servations remain uncertain due to complications arising
for example from dust obscuration the general behaviour
seems to consist of a rapid rise in star formation rate be-
tween z  0 and z  1 followed by a slowly declining or
perhaps constant star formation rate at higher redshifts
This is the kind of behaviour exhibited by our simulations
As the images in Fig 1 illustrate in hierarchical mod-
els of galaxy formation the number of galaxies is constantly
changing Galaxies are born as new dark matter halos form
and gas is able to cool in them and turn into stars The pop-
ulation is depleted when galaxies merge together Of course
the number of galaxies detected in a particular survey will
depend crucially on the selection criteria All these eects
can be clearly seen in the images of our simulations At
z  5 there are very few galaxies present because only a
A J Benson C S Frenk C M Baugh S Cole  C G Lacey
handful of massive dark halos have had time to collapse
In those that have galaxies have had little time to form
stars while feedback from supernovae has strongly sup-
pressed star formation in small halos The majority of the
galaxies seen in the images at this epoch occur in halos of
mass 101112h1M and have stellar masses of a few times
109h1M the very brightest galaxies are found in the tail
of halos extending to masses close to 1013h1M By z  3
the number of galaxies has increased signicantly as more
halos have collapsed and more galaxies have been able to
form At this epoch several extremely bright in the B-band
galaxies are visible The increased number of galaxies in the
image is due in part to our selection in the B-band which
is sensitive to the star formation rate At z  2 there is
a noticeable increase in the abundance of galaxies as struc-
tures continue to form The most obvious change from z  2
to z  1 is a substantial reddening of the galaxies a trend
which continues to z  0 as star formation rates decline and
stellar populations age
Many faint blue galaxies are formed in the lamentary
network of the dark matter In the comoving coordinates of
Fig 1 galaxies move rather little between z  5 and the
present For example the progenitor of the large superclus-
ter marked by a red box at z  0 is already clearly visible at
z  3 as a concentration of young galaxies In other words
by virtue of forming in the highest density regions galaxies
are strongly biased at birth This is a fundamental outcome
of hierarchical clustering Kaiser 1984 Davis et al 1985 It
underlies the results of Baugh et al 1998 and Governato et
al 1998 who argued that Lyman-break galaxies at z  3
would be expected to be strongly clustered as was subse-
quently found to be the case observationally Adelberger et
al 1998
4 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS AND
COMPARISONS WITH OBSERVATIONS
In this section we compare the properties of our model
with the limited observational data currently available More
stringent comparisons will be possible with the forthcoming
2dF and Sloan galaxy redshift surveys We consider in turn
the variation of the clustering length with the luminosity of
a sample the morphology-density relation and the topology
of the galaxy distribution
41 Correlation length versus separation
The evolution of the two-point correlation function of dark
matter in CDM models is now well established In the linear
regime it evolves according to the linear growth factor in
the non-linear regime its evolution can be calculated accu-
rately using N-body simulations see for example Jenkins et
al 1998 By contrast the evolution of the two-point corre-
lation function of galaxies has only begun to be investigated
in detail recently In Fig 4 we plot the redshift-space corre-
lation lengths s0 top panel and the real-space correlation
lengths r0 middle panel of galaxies brighter than a partic-
ular rest-frame dust-extinguished B-band magnitude as a
function of their mean separation d at z  0 solid line
z  10 dashed line and z  3 dot-dashed line For ref-
erence the lower panel of Fig 4 shows the relation between
mean separation and absolute B-band magnitude Statisti-
cal errors obtained by assuming Poisson counting statis-
tics to estimate the error in r and propagating this error
through to the determination of r0 are shown by the error
bars At small pair separations we show results from the
GIF simulation applying the small correction for nite vol-
ume eects discussed above and at large pair separations
we use the 5123 simulation which is more accurate on large
scales The sudden decrease in the size of the errorbars at
 15h1Mpc is due to this change of simulation volume
For reference we show the correlation lengths of the dark
matter at z  0 and z  1 as horizontal arrows at z  3
the dark matter correlation length is 11 and 15h1Mpc in
real and redshift-space respectively
We compare our model predictions with results from
the Southern Sky Redshift Survey 2 SSRS2 Benoist et al
1996 which are shown by lled squares in Fig 4 These data
exhibit a nearly constant redshift-space clustering length for
galaxies fainter than MB5 log h  20 followed by a rapid
increase at brighter magnitudes Benoist et al 1996 com-
pared their data to two simple models of galaxy bias In
the rst they assigned a dark matter halo mass to galaxies
in their sample using the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson
relations and then applied the techniques of Mo  White
1996 to compute the bias of these halos and hence of the
galaxies which occupy them This model provides a reason-
able match to the observed behaviour of the faint galaxies in
the survey but it is unable to reproduce the strong luminos-
ity dependent bias observed for galaxies brighter than L
Their second model is based upon the work of Bernardeau
 Schaeer
1992 who developed a description of bias
from the non-linear evolution of the density eld This model
is able to match the luminosity dependent bias for bright
galaxies but predicts too strong a relation for faint galaxies
and so is also ruled out by the data Our model of galaxy
clustering on the other hand does produce a trend simi-
lar to that observed namely a relatively constant clustering
length for small d followed by a rise in correlation length for
the rarest objects From Fig 4 it appears that our model is
not consistent with the data over the whole range of separa-
tions However this discrepancy may result from sampling
variance in the observations as we discuss below First we
explain how this trend arises in our models
It is well known that dark matter halos are biased rel-
ative to the underlying mass with the most massive halos
being the most strongly clustered eg Frenk et al 1988 Mo
 White 1996 Thus for the brightest galaxies to be the
most strongly clustered it is necessary that they should pref-
erentially inhabit more massive dark matter halos than those
occupied by their lower luminosity counterparts In Fig 5 we
show mass functions of dark matter halos weighted by the
number of occupant galaxies solid lines and unweighted
dashed lines for three values of d In each panel the
solid histogram gives the galaxy-weighted halo mass func-
tion when galaxies are selected by their dust-extinguished B-
band magnitudeThe vertical arrow in each panel shows the

dashed histograms The vertical arrow in each panel shows the location of M dened by M  c
location of M dened by M  c where M  is the
mass variance in spheres containing a mass M on average
and c is the critical overdensity for collapse in the spher-
ical top-hat model A simple understanding of the galaxy
bias for each sample may be gained from this gure For the
two smaller values of d the relative numbers of galaxies in
highly-biased cluster-sized halos Mhalo 1014h1M and
in weakly-biased galaxy-sized halos Mhalo  1012h1M
are comparable in the two samples As a result these two
samples have quite similar correlation lengths However for
the sparser sample with d  25h1Mpc the relative num-
ber in cluster-sized halos is much higher than in the two
other cases As a result this sample has a larger correlation
length than the other two For this very bright sample we
nd that many galaxies occupying halos near the peak mass
of Mhalo  1014h1M have undergone a recent burst of
star formation
As noted above our model is not in perfect agreement
with the data of Benoist et al
1996 The SSRS2 sur-
vey however covers a relatively small volume and so sam-
ple variance may not be negligible Benoist et al
estimated the eects of sample variance on their results and
concluded that the luminosity dependence of s0 for faint
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
sub-L galaxies could well be due to sample variance while
that for brighter galaxies seemed to be a real eect We can
estimate the size of this uncertainty directly from our simu-
lations which cover a much larger volume than the real sur-
vey For a given value of d we extract from the simulation
fty randomly placed cubic regions of volume equal to that
of a volume-limited SSRS2 catalogue cut at the same abso-
lute magnitude We then measure the correlation length in
each of the fty cubes In Fig 4 we plot the median correla-
tion lengths from the cubes as open circles with error-bars
indicating the 10 and 90 intervals of the distribution
We note that even for the largest value of d shown the
number of independent SSRS2 volumes that t within the
5123 simulation cube is still reasonably large  20 and so
our estimates of sample variance at these separations should
still be accurate Evidently sample variance in a survey the
size of the SSRS2 is large and this can account for the dif-
ferences with our model At the smallest values of d the
median value of s0 from the subsamples is biased low rela-
tive to that measured in the full simulation volume because
a large fraction of the clustering signal comes from galax-
ies in and around a few large clusters and these are often
missing from small volumes cut out of the simulation box
A J Benson C S Frenk C M Baugh S Cole  C G Lacey
At larger separations the main source of sample variance is
the low abundance of the brightest galaxies Our estimate of
sample variance conrm the conclusion reached by Benoist
et al 1996 namely that the luminosity dependence of s0
observed for sub-L galaxies in the SSRS2 is due to sample
variance while that for brighter galaxies is real
The evolution of the redshift-space correlation lengths
of galaxies of dierent abundance is also illustrated in Fig 4
For samples selected according to our specic criteria ie
according to rest-frame B-band absolute magnitude the
correlation lengths at z  1 and z  3 are slightly smaller
than at z  0 This variation however is much smaller than
the variation in the correlation length of the dark matter as
indicated by the horizontal arrows in Fig 4 Thus galaxies
selected according to our criteria are more strongly biased
at z  1 and z  3 than at z  0 even for quite small
values of d The images of the galaxy distribution displayed
in Fig 1 show exactly how this eect arises The galaxies
present at the highest redshift z  3 have formed in regions
that are destined to become incorporated into clusters or su-
perclusters of galaxies by the present day Such regions are
amongst the most overdense at high redshift and so small-
scale density uctuations tend to collapse earlier there than
in less overdense regions Kaiser 1984 Davis et al 1985
Bardeen et al 1986 Forming as they do in the most highly
biased regions of the universe galaxies at high redshift nat-
urally end up being strongly biased themselves Our model
predicts a strong luminosity dependence of clustering length
for the brightest galaxies from z  0 to 3 an eect which is
seen in both real and redshift-space
42 Morphology-density relation
The existence of a correlation between galaxy morphol-
ogy and local environment is a remarkable feature of the
galaxy population Dressler 1980 showed that the fraction
of galaxies of dierent morphological types is strongly corre-
lated with the local galaxy density elliptical and S0 galaxies
are found preferentially in high density regions while spiral
galaxies are found preferentially in low density regions
Early N-body simulations suggested that a morphology-
density relation is a natural outcome of hierarchical cluster-
ing from CDM initial conditions Frenk et al 1985 1988
This was explicitly shown to be the case by Monte-Carlo
based semi-analytic modelling Kaumann 1995 Baugh
Cole  Frenk 1996b These calculations had no informa-
tion on the spatial distribution of galaxies and so the rela-
tion they established is one between morphology and cluster
mass rather than between morphology and galaxy density
The implementation of semi-analytic techniques in high res-
olution N-body simulations allowed the radial distributions
of dierent kinds of galaxies inside large clusters to be cal-
culated for the rst time Springel et al 2001 Okamoto 
Nagashima 2001 This work has shown for example that
galaxies of dierent colours are spatially segregated within
the cluster
The emergence of a colour-density relation is clearly
illustrated in the images of Fig 1 Redder galaxies with
B V 07 which in our model are primarily ellipticals or

S0s see Fig 12 of Cole et al 2000 are over-abundant in
the most overdense regions relative to the eld eg the large
supercluster in the middle of the left-hand edge or the large
cluster near the centre of the bottom edge The correlation
between galaxy colour or morphology and environment is
a byproduct of the biases discussed in the preceding subsec-
tion the oldest reddest galaxies form in the highest density
regions where the production of elliptical galaxies by merg-
ers is also favoured
To quantify the morphology-density relation apparent
in Fig 1 we proceed in a manner analogous to the analysis
of an observational sample We use a technique patterned on
that employed by Postman  Geller 1984 First we ap-
ply a friends-of-friends group-nding algorithm to the real-
space distribution of model galaxies brighter than a partic-
ular B-band absolute magnitude using dierent values of
the linking length Postman  Geller 1984 applied their
group nder in redshift-space but used an anisotropic link-
ing length to account for distortions in the redshift direction
Since we have a galaxy catalogue in real-space we perform
group nding there avoiding the complications of redshift-
space distortions In this manner we build up nested sets
of groups as a function of the enclosed density we consider
three or more galaxies linked together to be a group For
very large linking lengths all galaxies will belong to a group
but as the linking length is decreased each galaxy will at
some point no longer be a member of a group We assign each
galaxy a local density corresponding to the surface density
of the group of which it was last a member The local den-
sity at the surface of a group formed with a linking length r
is approximately n  32r3 eg Lacey  Cole 1994 The
morphological type of the galaxy is assigned according to
our standard denitions based on dust-extinguished B-band
bulge-to-total luminosity ratios galaxies with BTB  04
are labelled as spirals while those with BTB  04 are la-
belled as ES0 Cole et al 2000 We constructed density-
morphology relations for samples with dierent limiting ab-
solute magnitudes In each case the measured densities were
corrected to the density of galaxies at MB  5 log h  175
using the CfA survey luminosity function as was done by
Postman  Geller 1984 namely we multiply the densities
by a factor

that our model does display a morphology-density relation

high density environments For high densities  100 galax-
ies h3Mpc3 our model shows no relation since by con-
struction no morphology-density relation can exist within
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
The evolution of the galaxy distribution
individual halos because of the way in which we assign galax-
ies to dark matter particles We do not plot model results
for densities greater than 1000h3Mpc3 since these begin to
probe single dark matter halos in our simulation resulting
in a poor determination of the morphology-density relation
The right-hand panel of Fig 6 shows that our model pre-
dicts a very similar morphology-density relation at z  1 as
at z  0
We can now elaborate a little on the cause of the
morphology density relation in our model focusing on the
morphology-density relation at low densities where the spa-
tial distribution of morphological types within individual
halos is unimportant and the local density is typically de-
termined by averaging over regions containing many dark
matter halos The morphological mix of galaxies in a single
dark matter halo can depend only upon the mass of that
halo since this statistically determines the merger history
and galaxy formation history in the halo Therefore for a
morphology-density relation to exist i there must be a re-
lation between dark matter halo mass and local galaxy den-
sity and ii there must be a dependence of morphological
fraction on halo mass The rst of these requirements is nat-
urally met in hierarchical cosmologies since the most massive
halos are preferentially found in the densest environments
The left-hand panel of Fig 7 shows the local galaxy number
density for galaxies brighter than MB  5 log h  195 but
corrected to 175 as before at the centres of dark mat-
ter halos as a function of the halo mass ie we plot the
density of the three-particle group as dened above which
contains the central galaxy Clearly the densest regions of
the galaxy population are associated with cluster-sized ha-
los The right-hand panel of Fig 7 shows that our model
also meets the second requirement This gure shows the
dark matter halo mass function weighted by the number of
galaxies of a particular morphological class per halo The
halo mass function for ES0 galaxies is shifted to higher
mass halos relative to that for S galaxies The resulting de-
pendence of morphological mix on halo mass merely reects
the fact that galaxy formation in clusters is accelerated rel-
ative to the eld allowing enough time for galaxy-galaxy
mergers to produce a large population of elliptical galaxies
Fig 6 also shows that the model morphology-density
relation depends upon the absolute magnitude at the which
the galaxies are selected This property is simply a reec-
tion of a morphology-luminosity relation that is present in
our model This property complicates the comparison with
observational data since existing analyses are usually based
on apparent magnitude limited samples In the gure we
compare our model predictions with the density-morphology
relation measured in the CfA survey by Postman  Geller
1984 For densities less than 100h3Mpc3 indicated by
the vertical arrow we plot the ES0 fraction in groups
dened as associations of 3 to 9 galaxies by Postman 
Geller 1984 and for larger densities we plot the fraction
in clusters associations of 10 or more galaxies This shows
that our model displays qualitatively similar behaviour to
the observational data A more detailed comparison may be
possible with the new generation of large redshift surveys
Finally another important prediction of our model is

1984 for densities less than 100h3Mpc3 as indicated by the vertical arrow and their cluster fractions for higher densities where
they dene groups and clusters as associations of 3-9 and 10 galaxies respectively In the left-hand panel the heavy solid line is our
model prediction for the ES0 fraction ie galaxies with a dust-extincted B-band bulge-to-total ratio BTB  04 at z  0 obtained
from the galaxy distribution in real-space The galaxies themselves are selected to have MB  5 log h  195 but the densities are
extrapolated to MB  5 log h  175 using the CfA survey luminosity function of Postman  Geller 1984 Dotted and dashed lines are
the corresponding model results for galaxies brighter than the completeness limits of the GIF and 5123 simulations MB  5 log h  181
and MB  5 log h  205 respectively and are also corrected to MB  5 log h  175 In the right-hand panel the heavy solid line
shows the model result at z  10 for galaxies above the simulation completeness limit but here the densities are left uncorrected and
so correspond to MB  5 log h  184 The thin solid line shows the relation at z  0 for galaxies brighter than MB  5 log h  184
for comparison Error bars are 1 deviations
that there should be a strong morphology-density relation
well-established already at z  1 as shown in the right-hand
panel of Fig 6 At this high redshift the model relation is
qualitatively similar to that at z  0
43 The genus curve for the topology of the
galaxy distribution
The two-point correlation function contains only low order
information about the spatial distribution of galaxies To
fully specify this distribution requires determining its higher
order clustering properties Alternatively the genus a mea-
sure of the topology of a smooth density eld provides a
statistic that is sensitive to all of the higher order moments
of the distribution Gott Melott  Dickinson 1986 Gott
Weinberg  Melott 1987
The genus is dened as the number of topological holes
minus the number of isolated regions of an isodensity sur-
face By varying the density at which this surface is placed
a genus curve can be constructed The genus curve has the
interesting property that an exact analytic expression ex-
ists for the special case of a Gaussian random density eld
g  A1   2 expcid18
2 cid19 
where g is the genus per unit volume and  is dened by
  2erf 11  2f 
where f is the fraction of the volume above the density
threshold and erf 1 is the inverse of the error function For
a Gaussian random eld but not for any other eld this
denition implies that  2 is the variance of the eld The
amplitude A depends only on the second moment of the
power spectrum of the smoothed density eld In general if
the eld is not Gaussian the shape of the genus curve may
dier from eqn 3 With the above denition for  the
genus curve remains the same under any dynamical evolu-
tion or biasing in which the initial and nal densities at each
Eulerian point are related by a monotonic one-to-one map-
ping Thus this topological measure provides in principle
a method for testing whether or not density uctuations in
the early universe were originally random and Gaussian as
predicted in generic inationary models
The genus curve has been determined for both N-body
simulations of dark matter and for surveys of galaxies in
the real Universe by many authors eg Gott et al 1989
Moore et al 1992 Park Gott  da Costa 1992 Rhoads

The genus curve for galaxies would be identical to that of
the underlying dark matter if the galaxy and dark matter
density elds were related by a monotonically varying factor
the bias The bias relation ie the galaxy overdensity as a
function of dark matter overdensity in our model is shown
in Fig 8 for galaxies brighter than MB  5 log h  185 It
is qualitatively similar to the relations found by Somerville
2001 using similar techniques The symbols show
the median relation which is clearly monotonic However
there is substantial scatter around this relation as a result
of which it is no longer guaranteed that the genus curve for
galaxies will be identical to that of the dark matter
We have used the technique described by Coles Davies
 Pearson 1996 to measure the genus of both dark matter
and galaxies in our simulation Fig 9 shows the results for
galaxies dashed lines brighter than MB  5 log h  185
at z  0 upper panels and z  10 lower panels and also
for dark matter solid lines These curves were calculated
by smoothing the dark matter and galaxies in redshift-space
onto a 1283 grid using a Gaussian lter of the form

as is conventional in the literature on this subject Smooth-
ing lengths of e  60 and e  80h1 Mpc were chosen
to match those used by Vogeley et al 1994 in their anal-
ysis of the CfA surveys These smoothing lengths are over
ve times larger than the size of the grid cells on which the
elds are tabulated and so the nite resolution of the grid
has no eect on the calculation of the genus curve Springel

in redshift space Errorbars on the model galaxy genus curves are the standard deviations from thirty bootstrap resamplings of the
galaxy distribution Note however that the line indicates the genus curve of the actual distribution not the mean of the bootstrapped
samples
et al 1998 Note that the mean comoving separation of
galaxies in our simulation is 43 and 56h1 Mpc at z  0
and z  10 respectively corresponding to 34000 and 16000
galaxies in the simulation volume At z  1 this is just
smaller than the minimum smoothing scale thereby provid-
ing the greatest number of independent resolution elements
without allowing discreteness eects to become too large
Weinberg Gott  Melott 1987 We estimate the errors
on each genus curve by bootstrap resampling of the galaxy
catalogues Moore et al
1992 nd that this procedure
produces slightly larger errors than those estimated by con-
sidering several realizations of a mock catalogue
In a CDM cosmology N-body simulations have shown
that the genus curve for the dark matter displays both a
bubble shift ie a shift to the right with respect to the
Gaussian random phase genus curve and an amplitude re-
duction relative to a Gaussian random density eld hav-
ing the same power spectrum Springel et al 1998 These
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
two eects can be seen by comparing the dark matter genus
curve to the two random phase genus curves ie with the
shape given by eqn 3 shown in Fig 9 by dotted and dot-
dashed lines The amplitude of the dotted curve is chosen to
best t in a least-squares sense the measured dark matter
genus curve while the amplitude of the dot-dashed curve is
that expected for a Gaussian random eld with the same
power spectrum as the dark matter The dark matter genus
curve is displaced to the right of the dotted curve showing
the bubble shift and has smaller amplitude than the dot-
dashed curve showing the amplitude drop The genus curve
for galaxies brighter than MB  5 log h  185 shows def-
inite dierences from that for the dark matter Firstly no
bubble shift exists for the galaxy genus curve which instead
exhibits a small meatball shift ie shift to the left The
galaxy curve also has a systematically larger amplitude than
the dark matter curve Canavezes et al 1998 advocate the
amplitude drop dened as the ratio of the amplitudes of
the best-t random phase genus curved for the actual den-
sity eld and that of a Gaussian random eld with the same
power spectrum as a useful measure of the degree of phase
correlation in the galaxy density eld To measure the ampli-
tude drop we Gaussianise the galaxy density eld ie we
take it to Fourier space randomise the phases subject to the
reality condition k  
k and then restore it to real space
The amplitude drop is then simply the ratio of amplitudes
of the best-t random phase genus curves for the original
and Gaussianized density elds At z  0 we nd amplitude
drops of R  070 and R  084 for the dark matter in
redshift-space for e  60 and 80h1Mpc respectively In
real-space we measure amplitude drops of 060 and 067 for
the same two smoothing lengths in good agreement with
the determinations of Springel et al 1998 For galaxies at
z  0 we nd R  084  002 and R  090  002 also
for these same two smoothing scales At z  1 lower pan-
els in Fig 9 the amplitude drops are somewhat smaller
R  090  003 and R  093  007 for e  60 and
80h1Mpc respectively as phase correlations due to non-
linear growth of structure have not had as long to develop
as at z  0
As noted above galaxies would have exactly the same
genus curve as the dark matter if there were a one-to-one
mapping between dark matter and galaxy density elds
which preserved the density ranking However we do see
signicant dierences between the galaxy and dark matter
genus curves This must be due either to the scatter in the
biasing relation between galaxies and dark matter or to sys-
tematic biases arising from the relatively small number of
galaxies  104 compared to dark matter particles  107
in our samples To test this latter possibility we extracted
twenty random samples of dark matter particles with the
same abundance as the galaxies in our catalogue and com-
puted their genus curves We nd that this sparse sampling
is the primary cause of the dierences between the galaxy
and dark matter genus curves Just as for the galaxy sample
the sparsely sampled dark matter shows no evidence for a
bubble shift and agrees closely with the galaxy genus curve
for   0 and also shows a higher genus curve amplitude
compared to the fully sampled dark matter distribution We
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
The evolution of the galaxy distribution
conclude therefore that any dierences between the genus
curves for dark matter and galaxies due to the stochastic
bias of Fig 8 are negligible compared to the eects of sparse
sampling of the galaxy density eld This sparse sampling at
present severely limits the usefulness of the genus statistic
for quantifying the Gaussianity of the initial dark matter
distribution
We also show in Fig 9 the genus curve measured for
the CfA surveys by Vogeley et al 1994 While our model
results are in reasonable agreement with these data the pro-
nounced features in the data suggest that the CfA surveys
do not have a suciently large volume to avoid signicant
sample variance eects Indeed when we extract CfA sur-
vey volumes from random locations in our simulations and
measure their genus curves we nd that excursions such as
those seen in Fig 9 are very common
5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We have implemented a semi-analytic model of galaxy for-
mation in high resolution N-body simulations of the CDM
cosmology in order to study the spatial distribution of galax-
ies and its evolution The semi-analytic model requires set-
ting values for a number of parameters which describe the
physical processes that are modelled such as gas cooling
star formation and the associated feedback mechanisms and
chemical evolution galaxy merging the evolution of stellar
populations etc In keeping with the general philosophy of
our work in the subject we have xed all the model param-
eters by requiring a match to a handful of global properties
of the local galaxy population with the largest number of
constraints coming from the local B-band and K-band lumi-
nosity functions No further adjustment to these parameter
values was allowed in the clustering study carried out in this
paper Thus our clustering results are genuine predictions
of the model and oer an opportunity to test the validity of
the physical assumptions it requires as well as the realism
of the CDM model as a whole In this paper we have con-
sidered three specic statistical measures of clustering the
correlation length in real- and redshift-space of samples
of galaxies of dierent luminosity the morphology-density
relation and the genus curve At z  0 our model may be
tested by forthcoming data from the 2dF and Sloan surveys
at z  1 it may tested by planned surveys such as DEEP

agreement with observations In Benson et al 2000c we

1999a and at high redshift Kaumann et al 1999b as
well as the clustering of groups Diaferio et al 1999 On
the whole these two independent analyses agree quite well
and the dierences that do exist can be readily understood
in terms of dierences in the detailed assumptions for the
physics of galaxy formation see Benson et al 2000c for a
detailed discussion of dierences between the two models
The evolution of clustering has also been studied using sim-
ilar semi-analyticN-body techniques by Governato et al
1998 and more recently by Wechsler et al 2001
Images of our simulation clearly illustrate many of the
salient features of galaxy growth by hierarchical clustering
They show that galaxies approximately trace the lamen-
tary structure and avoid the lowest density regions of the
dark matter distribution that the redder galaxies tend to
predominate in the most massive dark halos and that the
brightest galaxies occur almost exclusively in regions of high
dark matter density A series of time slices shows how the
galaxy population changes in abundance and colour with
the passage of time and demonstrates the primary eect
behind biased galaxy formation the formation of the rst
bright galaxies in regions of exceptionally high dark matter
density
From quantitative studies of the galaxy distribution we
reach the following three conclusions
i The correlation length of galaxies in real and redshift-
space increases rapidly with galaxy luminosity for galaxies
brighter than L both at z  0 and at high redshifts z3
ii A strong morphology-density relation in the same
sense as observed is a natural outcome of hierarchical clus-
tering from CDM initial conditions and radpidly develops
in our simulation A clear morphology-density relation is
predicted to be already in place at least since z  1
iii The topology of the galaxy distribution as measured
by the genus statistic diers signicantly from that of the
dark matter However the dierences are due almost entirely
to sparse sampling eects the stochastic biasing between
galaxies and dark matter is at most a minor eect
We now discuss these points more detail
The variation of the correlation length with luminosity
or equivalently with mean inter-galaxy separation is one
of the most striking results of our analysis The correlation
length is virtually insensitive to the mean separation within
the sample out to separations of around 10h1Mpc cor-
responding to luminosities of MB  5 log h  205 but
for brighter sparser samples it increases very rapidly Thus
the redshift-space clustering length of galaxies of luminos-
ity 7L is predicted to be over twice as large as that of L
galaxies The pattern is similar in real- and redshift-space
Owing to the large volume of our simulations this is the
rst time that this rapid increase in correlation length at
the brightest luminosities has been unambiguously demon-
strated The main cause of this behaviour is the prepon-
derance of such galaxies at the centres of massive clusters
These galaxies experience enhanced merger rates at early
times and are the beneciaries of late accretion of cool gas
which in our model is always funnelled onto the central
galaxy in each halo Our predictions for the dependence of
clustering strength on galaxy luminosity are in broad agree-
ment with existing datasets but these are rather small and
thus subject to considerable sampling uncertainties A bet-
ter test of these predictions should be forthcoming shortly
from the 2dF and Sloan surveys
Our simulations develop a strong morphology-density
relation similar to that observed in the local universe el-
lipticalS0 galaxies predominate in rich clusters while spi-
rals predominate in the eld We have used a technique
patterned after observational procedures to characterise the
morphology-density relation in our simulations and nd that
it quantitatively agrees rather well with observations The
cause of the morphology-density relation is closely related to
the reasons behind the luminosity dependence of clustering
In rich clusters galaxy evolution is accelerated relative
to more ordinary regions of space thus allowing sucient
time for mergers and interactions to build up a large popu-
lation of bright ellipticalS0 galaxies Remarkably a strong
morphology-density relation is already well-established by
Finally we have investigated the topology of the galaxy
distribution providing the rst theoretical prediction for the
genus curve of galaxies rather than merely of dark matter
Of course if galaxy density were monotonically related to
dark matter density the two curves would be the same In
the simulations there is on average a monotonic relation be-
tween the two but it has such large scatter that it does
not preclude dierences in the respective genus curves We
do actually nd a dierence in our simulations the dark
matter genus curve has a bubble shift whereas the galaxy
genus curve has a meatball shift and also a higher ampli-
tude It turns out however that the dierences are not due
to genuine topological dierences but rather to the sparse
sampling of the density eld provided by galaxies The con-
fusing eects of sampling have been pointed out by previous
authors eg Canavezes et al 1998 Springel et al 1998
Our simulations show that in order to measure an unbi-
ased genus curve for a clustered galaxy distribution par-
ticularly at low overdensity several hundred galaxies per
smoothing volume are required This is unlikely to be prac-
tical even with the new generation of large surveys and so
we will have to live with these biases The best approach
for comparing models and data is therefore to analyse each
in identical ways so as to cancel out any systematic eects
Mock galaxy catalogues such as those presented here will be
crucial for this approach
To summarise the combination of high-resolution N-
body simulations of dark matter and semi-analytic mod-
elling of galaxies provides a powerful technique for turning
cosmological and galaxy formation theory into realistic re-
alizations of the galaxy population that can be compared
in detail with observations Tests of this sort will become
increasingly common with the new generation of galaxy sur-
veys In this way it will be possible to extract not only the
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
cosmological information encoded in the clustering pattern
but also valuable information regarding the physics of galaxy
formation
